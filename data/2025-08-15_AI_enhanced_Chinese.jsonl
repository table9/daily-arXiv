Likewise, active space selection is a key to\nunlock the potential of contemporary quantum computing in quantum chemistry.\nAlbeit recent progress, there remains a lack of a unified, robust, and fully\nautomated framework for active space selection that performs reliably across a\nwide range of molecular systems.\n  In this work, we present a novel approach inspired by both the AVAS (Atomic\nValence Active Space) and AutoCAS methods. Our method unifies orbital entropy\nanalysis with atomic orbital projections to guide the construction of\nchemically and physically meaningful active spaces. This integrated scheme\nenables a more consistent and flexible selection of active orbitals while\nretaining automation and scalability. We validate our approach on a set of\nmolecular systems relevant to photodynamic therapy, in particular a set of\nRu(II)-complexes, selected to span increasing levels of electron correlation\nand structural complexity. These molecules serve as challenging test cases due\nto the presence of strong static correlation and the need for highly accurate\nelectronic structure descriptions. Our results demonstrate that the method can\nreliably identify compact, chemically intuitive active spaces that capture the\nessential physics, making it suitable for both classical and quantum\ncomputational frameworks.\n  Furthermore, we have developed this approach in a package that is intuitive\nto use for users and can be interfaced with both standard quantum chemistry and\nquantum computing applications, making it accessible to a broad research\ncommunity."}
