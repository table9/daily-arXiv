Two methods extract exchange parameters directly: one via total-energy\ndifferences using the four-state mapping ($\\Delta E$), and the other via the\nmagnetic force theorem (MFT) using infinitesimal spin rotations. Magnon\ndispersions are then obtained from a Heisenberg Hamiltonian through linear\nspin-wave theory (LSWT). The third approach, time-dependent density-functional\nperturbation theory with $U$ (TDDFPT+$U$), yields magnon dispersions directly\nfrom the dynamical spin susceptibility, with exchange parameters fitted a\nposteriori, for comparison, via LSWT.

The results show\nthat, for Si/SiC, Si/Diamond, and GaN/Diamond interfaces, introducing defects\nweakens heat transport.

For the GaN/SiC\ninterface, defects in GaN reduce ITC, while defects in SiC enhance ITC. At a\ndefect concentration of 0.05, ITC decreases by 54.1% when defects are present\nin GaN, but increases by 57.2% when defects are present in SiC.

Among the\nQMC techniques, Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) is widely regarded as the most\nreliable, since it provides the projection onto the ground state of a given\nHamiltonian under the fixed-node approximation. One practical realization of\nDMC is the Lattice Regularized Diffusion Monte Carlo (LRDMC) method, which\ndiscretizes the Hamiltonian within the Green's Function Monte Carlo framework.\nDMC methods - including LRDMC - employ the so-called branching technique to\nstabilize walker weights and populations.

The\nconventional LRDMC algorithm intrinsically suffers from such load imbalance,\nwhich grows as $\\log(N_w)$, rendering it less efficient on modern parallel\narchitectures. In this work, we present an LRDMC algorithm that inherently\naddresses the load imbalance issue and achieves significantly improved\nweak-scaling parallel efficiency.

Here, we present an angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy\n(ARPES) and density functional theory (DFT) study of Co1/4TaSe2, a compound we\nidentify as a layered altermagnetic material. Magnetic susceptibility\nmeasurements confirm type A antiferromagnetic ordering with a Neel temperature\nof 178 K. Our ARPES measurements reveal an electronic band structure in\nexcellent agreement with DFT calculations, demonstrating clear signatures of\naltermagnetic spin splitting at the Fermi surface. Furthermore, temperature\ndependent ARPES reveals a reconstructed valence band structure, with observable\nband shifts and the closing of energy gaps upon heating above the Neel\ntemperature (TN), consistent with the suppression of altermagnetic order. These\nfindings establish Co1/4TaSe2 as a promising platform for exploring\naltermagnetic phenomena."}

In this work, a microscale\nthermal transport model is developed by combining first-principles calculations\nwith Monte Carlo simulations, explicitly accounting for the effects of defects.\nThe effects of defect concentration and location on thermal transport\ncharacteristics are investigated for four heterointerfaces: Si/SiC, GaN/SiC,\nSi/Diamond, and GaN/Diamond. Temperature distribution, spectral thermal\nconductance, average phonon scattering numbers, and interfacial thermal\nconductance (ITC) are compared under different conditions. The results show\nthat, for Si/SiC, Si/Diamond, and GaN/Diamond interfaces, introducing defects\nweakens heat transport.

For the GaN/SiC\ninterface, defects in GaN reduce ITC, while defects in SiC enhance ITC. At a\ndefect concentration of 0.05, ITC decreases by 54.1% when defects are present\nin GaN, but increases by 57.2% when defects are present in SiC.

Prior studies have\nreported both enhanced and suppressed water self-dissociation relative to the\nbulk, but without a consistent explanation. Here, using enhanced sampling\nmolecular dynamics with machine-learned potentials trained at first-principles\naccuracy, we investigate dissociation behavior in water confined within 2D slit\npores and nanodroplets, using graphene and hexagonal boron nitride as model\nmaterials. We find that reactivity is extremely sensitive to water density,\nconfinement width, geometry, material flexibility, and surface chemistry.\nDespite this complexity, we show that chemical potential -- together with\ninterfacial interactions -- governs dissociation trends and explains the\nvariability observed in prior studies. This thermodynamic perspective\nreconciles previous contradictions and reveals how nanoscale environments can\ndrastically shift water reactivity. Our findings provide molecular-level\ninsight and offer a design lever for modulating water chemistry at the\nnanoscale."}

Yet most existing methods fall short:\ndensity functional theory (DFT), although widely used for its computational\nefficiency, often lacks the accuracy needed for adsorption and reaction\nenergetics at heterogeneous metal surfaces. Wavefunction-based theories, in\ncontrast, are more accurate in principle but remain prohibitively costly when\napplied to realistic catalytic systems. Here we introduce FEMION (Fragment\nEmbedding for Metals and Insulators with Onsite and Nonlocal correlation), a\nquantum embedding framework that resolves the long-standing challenge of\naccurately describing partially filled electronic states in metals while\nretaining accuracy for insulators. FEMION combines highly accurate solvers such\nas auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo to capture many-body effects at\ncatalytic sites, together with a global random phase approximation treatment of\nnonlocal screening, providing a scalable and systematically improvable\nframework for accurate quantum simulations. We demonstrate chemical accuracy\nfor two long-standing challenges in heterogeneous catalysis: the preference\nsite of CO adsorption and the H2 desorption barrier on the Cu(111) surface,\nwhere conventional methods have struggled for decades. Beyond achieving\nquantitative accuracy, FEMION offers a many-body bonding analysis that reveals\nwhy DFT fails to capture the CO adsorption preference, highlighting the\ncritical role of electron correlation in governing surface energetics. FEMION\nthus establishes a robust route to predictive, first-principles modeling of\ncomplex catalytic systems."}
