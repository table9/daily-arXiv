Two methods extract exchange parameters directly: one via total-energy\ndifferences using the four-state mapping ($\\Delta E$), and the other via the\nmagnetic force theorem (MFT) using infinitesimal spin rotations. Magnon\ndispersions are then obtained from a Heisenberg Hamiltonian through linear\nspin-wave theory (LSWT). The third approach, time-dependent density-functional\nperturbation theory with $U$ (TDDFPT+$U$), yields magnon dispersions directly\nfrom the dynamical spin susceptibility, with exchange parameters fitted a\nposteriori, for comparison, via LSWT. Our results show that TDDFPT+$U$ and the\nHeisenberg model based on $\\Delta E$-derived parameters align well with\nexperimental neutron scattering data, whereas the MFT-based approach shows\nlarger discrepancies, possibly due to some inherent approximations and\nlimitations of the particular implementation used. This study benchmarks the\naccuracy of state-of-the-art first-principles techniques for spin-wave modeling\nand contributes to advancing reliable computational tools for the study and\ndesign of magnetic materials."}

Here, we present an angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy\n(ARPES) and density functional theory (DFT) study of Co1/4TaSe2, a compound we\nidentify as a layered altermagnetic material. Magnetic susceptibility\nmeasurements confirm type A antiferromagnetic ordering with a Neel temperature\nof 178 K. Our ARPES measurements reveal an electronic band structure in\nexcellent agreement with DFT calculations, demonstrating clear signatures of\naltermagnetic spin splitting at the Fermi surface. Furthermore, temperature\ndependent ARPES reveals a reconstructed valence band structure, with observable\nband shifts and the closing of energy gaps upon heating above the Neel\ntemperature (TN), consistent with the suppression of altermagnetic order.

Crucially, linear excitations in the system map to a Rice-Mele model\nand display topological boundary modes localized at these kinks. Using methods\nfrom nonlinear dynamics, we show that instabilities in these boundary modes are\nthe driving mechanism behind the observed kink motion. While the transport\nresembles that of a linear Thouless pump, it cannot be fully captured by\nconventional topological indices. Instead, the behavior is more akin to a\ntopological ratchet: robust, directional, and reproducible, yet fundamentally\nnonlinear. Furthermore, by introducing multiple pumping parameters, we\ndemonstrate fine control over multiple kink trajectories, as well as soliton\nmotion, suggesting applications in information transport. Our results unify\nconcepts from linear topology and nonlinear dynamics to establish a framework\nfor quantized transport in nonlinear media."}

The interplay of strain, CA, and charge\nand thermomagnetic transport in SOC-NCMs, however, remains unexplored. Here we\nresolve this gap. Using a tight-binding model for SOC-NCMs, we first\ndemonstrate that strain in SOC-NCMs induces anisotropy in the spin-orbit\ncoupling and generates an axial electric field. Then, using the quasi-classical\nBoltzmann transport formalism with momentum-dependent intraband and interband\nscattering processes, we show that strain in the presence of external magnetic\nfield can generate temperature gradients via the Nernst-Ettingshausen effect,\nwhose direction and behavior depends the on interplay of multiple factors: the\nangle between the applied strain and magnetic field, the presence of the chiral\nanomaly, the Lorentz force, and the strength of interband scattering.

The activity of\ncolumbite appears to be experimentally higher than that of the anatase phase.\nDFT calculations revealed that columbite does not have a narrow electronic\nbandgap, but its optical bandgap and light absorbance are improved by oxygen\nvacancies more significantly compared to anatase. Moreover, the water\nadsorption energy is higher and the surface activation energy for water\nsplitting on the (101) atomic plane of columbite is lower than that for the\nactive planes of anatase. In conclusion, although columbite is not a\nlow-bandgap semiconductor, its large light absorbance and high surface\ncatalytic activity make it a promising candidate for photocatalytic reactions."}

Temperature distribution, spectral thermal\nconductance, average phonon scattering numbers, and interfacial thermal\nconductance (ITC) are compared under different conditions. The results show\nthat, for Si/SiC, Si/Diamond, and GaN/Diamond interfaces, introducing defects\nweakens heat transport. Higher defect concentration leads to lower ITC.\nFurthermore, when defects are in SiC or Diamond, which have broader phonon\nspectral distributions, their impact on ITC is weaker. For the GaN/SiC\ninterface, defects in GaN reduce ITC, while defects in SiC enhance ITC. At a\ndefect concentration of 0.05, ITC decreases by 54.1% when defects are present\nin GaN, but increases by 57.2% when defects are present in SiC.

At the branching step, walkers must\nbe synchronized globally; any imbalance in per-walker workload can leave CPU or\nGPU cores idle, thereby degrading overall hardware utilization. The\nconventional LRDMC algorithm intrinsically suffers from such load imbalance,\nwhich grows as $\\log(N_w)$, rendering it less efficient on modern parallel\narchitectures. In this work, we present an LRDMC algorithm that inherently\naddresses the load imbalance issue and achieves significantly improved\nweak-scaling parallel efficiency. Using the binding energy calculation of a\nwater-methane complex as a test case, we demonstrated that the conventional and\nload-balanced LRDMC algorithms yield consistent results. Furthermore, by\nutilizing the Leonardo supercomputer equipped with NVIDIA A100 GPUs, we\ndemonstrated that the load-balanced LRDMC algorithm can maintain extremely high\nparallel efficiency ($\\sim$98\\%) up to 512 GPUs (corresponding to $N_{\\rm w}=\n51200$), together with a speedup of $\\times~1.24$ if directly compared with the\nconventional LRDMC algorithm with the same number of walkers."}

Bi2 Bi2Se3 is a topological semimetal composed of a 2D\nbismuthene sheet and a Bi2Se3 quintuple layer, forming an intrinsic\nsuperlattice. This study investigates the electronic structure and edge states\nof Bi2 Bi2Se3 [001] oriented films under ambient conditions through conducting\natomic force microscopy (C-AFM). Point I-V spectroscopy and current imaging are\nused to characterize the surface and local transport properties of bismuthene\nand Bi2Se3 terminated layers. Our measurements reveal force dependent shifts in\nconduction mechanisms in both bismuthene and Bi2Se3, transitioning from direct\ntunneling (DT) at low forces and low biases, to Fowler Nordheim tunneling (FNT)\nat low forces and high biases, and eventually to a more ohmic like behavior at\nthe highest forces. Under DT conditions on the bismuthene termination, we\nobserved the Dirac cone in the dI/dV spectroscopy. Edge states are observed\nalong the perimeter of the (001) terraces for both terminations, and are\nobserved to have higher conductivity than the local terrace. Force-dependent\nimaging revealed an increase in the width of the edge state as force increased,\nuntil the conductive edge state appeared to cover the entire terrace.\nFurthermore, terrace heights display a force dependent distortion from the high\ntip forces, which indicates that the transition to the ohmic-like contact\nregime on either termination results from a complex interplay between strain\nand tip induced effects. All measurements were performed under ambient\nconditions, which demonstrates the robustness of the topological and edge\nstates to ambient conditions."}

In this work, a microscale\nthermal transport model is developed by combining first-principles calculations\nwith Monte Carlo simulations, explicitly accounting for the effects of defects.\nThe effects of defect concentration and location on thermal transport\ncharacteristics are investigated for four heterointerfaces: Si/SiC, GaN/SiC,\nSi/Diamond, and GaN/Diamond. Temperature distribution, spectral thermal\nconductance, average phonon scattering numbers, and interfacial thermal\nconductance (ITC) are compared under different conditions. The results show\nthat, for Si/SiC, Si/Diamond, and GaN/Diamond interfaces, introducing defects\nweakens heat transport.

For the GaN/SiC\ninterface, defects in GaN reduce ITC, while defects in SiC enhance ITC. At a\ndefect concentration of 0.05, ITC decreases by 54.1% when defects are present\nin GaN, but increases by 57.2% when defects are present in SiC.

A comprehensive FTJ model integrating\nferroelectric (FE) switching, DT, FN tunneling, and TAT mechanisms is\ndeveloped, enabling detailed analyses of the trap conditions and their impact\non performance. Through systematic optimization of trap parameters and device\nstructure, the TAT-based FTJ achieves ultra-high JON and a remarkable on-off\ncurrent ratio, meeting the nanoscale IMC requirements. The results highlight\nthe potential of TAT-based FTJs as high-performance memory solutions for IMC\napplications."}

Our findings provide molecular-level\ninsight and offer a design lever for modulating water chemistry at the\nnanoscale."}

Yet most existing methods fall short:\ndensity functional theory (DFT), although widely used for its computational\nefficiency, often lacks the accuracy needed for adsorption and reaction\nenergetics at heterogeneous metal surfaces. Wavefunction-based theories, in\ncontrast, are more accurate in principle but remain prohibitively costly when\napplied to realistic catalytic systems. Here we introduce FEMION (Fragment\nEmbedding for Metals and Insulators with Onsite and Nonlocal correlation), a\nquantum embedding framework that resolves the long-standing challenge of\naccurately describing partially filled electronic states in metals while\nretaining accuracy for insulators. FEMION combines highly accurate solvers such\nas auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo to capture many-body effects at\ncatalytic sites, together with a global random phase approximation treatment of\nnonlocal screening, providing a scalable and systematically improvable\nframework for accurate quantum simulations. We demonstrate chemical accuracy\nfor two long-standing challenges in heterogeneous catalysis: the preference\nsite of CO adsorption and the H2 desorption barrier on the Cu(111) surface,\nwhere conventional methods have struggled for decades. Beyond achieving\nquantitative accuracy, FEMION offers a many-body bonding analysis that reveals\nwhy DFT fails to capture the CO adsorption preference, highlighting the\ncritical role of electron correlation in governing surface energetics. FEMION\nthus establishes a robust route to predictive, first-principles modeling of\ncomplex catalytic systems."}
