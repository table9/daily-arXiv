In this work, we employ the\nDFT-1/2 method to address these deficiencies while maintaining computational\nefficiency allowing us to reach supercells of up to 4096 atoms. We develop a\npractical procedure for applying DFT-1/2 to shallow defects and demonstrate its\neffectiveness for group V donors in silicon (P, As, Sb, Bi).

A\nkey criterion for obtaining an accurate method is conservation of the Quantum\nBoltzmann Distribution (QBD). For a single surface, Matsubara dynamics is known\nto conserve the QBD, as a consequence of truncating the dynamics in the higher\nnormal modes of the imaginary-time path integral. Recently, a Non-Adiabatic\nMatsubara (NA-Mats) dynamics has been proposed (J. Chem. Phys., 2021, 154,\n124124) which truncates in the normal modes of the nuclear variables but not in\nthe electronic variables, which are described with the Meyer-Miller-Stock-Thoss\n(MMST) representation. Surprisingly, this NA-Mats method does not appear to\nconserve the QBD for a general system. This poses the question of the effect of\ntruncating the higher normal modes of the electronic variables in the MMST\nrepresentation. In this article, we present what we believe is the first study\nof electronic normal modes of the MMST representation. We find that observables\nare not usually a function of a finite number of normal modes and that the\nhigher normal modes are not constrained by the distribution, unlike in\nconventional nuclear normal modes. While for an ensemble of trajectories,\ntruncation in MMST normal modes appears to numerically conserve the QBD, this\nis not the case for a single trajectory. When considering a correlation\nfunction, all MMST normal modes are required to obtain reasonable dynamics.\nOverall, this suggests that MMST variables are not optimal for obtaining an\naccurate, QBD conserving nonadiabatic dynamics method."}

FMT accurately captures key features of\nthree- and four-body structure, particularly at low and intermediate\nwavevectors. We show that the dominant contributions to the four-point\nstructure factor arise from direct triplet correlations, allowing evaluation of\nfour-point correlations to be greatly simplified. In glass-forming liquids at\nhigh volume fractions, FMT correctly reproduces deviations from the convolution\napproximation, highlighting FMT's ability to capture growing structural\nmultipoint correlations upon supercooling."}
