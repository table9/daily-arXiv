Our results demonstrate that orbital-selective pairing drives the\nobserved two-gap superconductivity in CsV3Sb5. Specifically, the two distinct\ngaps exhibit strong orbital dependence: a large, highly anisotropic gap\n(average magnitude ~0.64 meV) primarily originates from V-3d orbitals, while a\nsmall, isotropic gap (~0.25 meV) is associated with the Sb-5pz orbital. The\nV-3d orbitals strongly couple to the in-plane V-V bond-stretching and\nout-of-plane V-Sb bending phonon modes, whereas the kagome-plane Sb-5pz orbital\nweakly interacts with Cs shearing phonon mode. Moreover, our calculations\nreveal EPC-induced band renormalization, manifested as kinks at approximately\n-13 meV and -30 meV in the electronic dispersion, consistent with prior\nexperimental observations. These findings provide fundamental insights into the\norbital-selective superconductivity and EPC mechanisms in kagome CsV3Sb5."}

However, fully first-principles, self-consistent\ncalculations with these dynamical functionals remain a major challenge,\nultimately limiting their application to thermodynamic quantities, and\nrestricting spectral predictions to one-shot calculations. In this paper, we\npresent a fully self-consistent treatment of the electronic structure of solids\nusing a dynamical functional. Our approach leverages the so-called dynamical\nHubbard functional, which generalizes the DFT+$U$ correction by incorporating\nfrequency-dependent screening, augmenting the static density functional to\naccurately describe both spectral and thermodynamic properties of materials\nwith $d$- or $f$-localized orbitals near the Fermi level. To enable this, we\nemploy the algorithmic-inversion method based on a sum-over-poles\nrepresentation, resulting in a numerically accurate self-consistent scheme for\nfrequency-integrated properties, while keeping real-axis spectral resolution\nfor dynamically-resolved quantities. Using this framework, we study the\nparadigmatic correlated solid SrVO$_3$, accurately reproducing its spectral\nfeatures, essentially confirming previous one-shot predictions, and improving\nthe description of its equilibrium properties, such as the equilibrium volume\nand bulk modulus, bringing these significantly closer to experimental\nmeasurements."}

This is further confirmed by\nSTEM imaging of strategically prepared, partially switched\nAl$_{0.75}$Sc$_{0.25}$N thin films. Our simulations reveal that switching\nproceeds through collective, column-by-column atomic displacements, directly\nexplaining the emergence of zigzag-shaped domain walls, and is consistent with\nthe nucleation-limited switching behavior observed in experimental switching\ndynamic measurements. Furthermore, we show that increasing Sc content\nsystematically lowers domain wall energy and associated nucleation barrier,\nthereby reducing the switching field in agreement with experimental trends.\nThese findings establish a direct connection between local domain wall\nstructure, switching kinetics, and macroscopic ferroelectric behavior."}

The Gaussian kernel models\nthe spatial averaging effects of pump and probe beams, while k-means clustering\nof high-resolution structural images reduces the parameter space for inverse\nmodeling. A physics-informed neural network jointly minimizes phase-data error\nand deviation from analytically recovered conductivity maps, enabling the\ndetection of grain boundary thermal conductivity drops visually obscured in\nconventional FDTR inversions. Demonstrated on finite element-generated\nsynthetic data, the framework recovers bulk values within less than 0.5% error\nand qualitatively resolves grain boundary effects despite limited image\nresolution.

Here we demonstrate that these generally-applicable models\ncan also be built to predict explicitly the electronic structure of materials\nand molecules. We focus on the electronic density of states (DOS), and develop\nPET-MAD-DOS, a rotationally unconstrained transformer model built on the Point\nEdge Transformer (PET) architecture, and trained on the Massive Atomistic\nDiversity (MAD) dataset. We demonstrate our model's predictive abilities on\nsamples from diverse external datasets, showing also that the DOS can be\nfurther manipulated to obtain accurate band gap predictions. A fast evaluation\nof the DOS is especially useful in combination with molecular simulations\nprobing matter in finite-temperature thermodynamic conditions. To assess the\naccuracy of PET-MAD-DOS in this context, we evaluate the ensemble-averaged DOS\nand the electronic heat capacity of three technologically relevant systems:\nlithium thiophosphate (LPS), gallium arsenide (GaAs), and a high entropy alloy\n(HEA). By comparing with bespoke models, trained exclusively on system-specific\ndatasets, we show that our universal model achieves semi-quantitative agreement\nfor all these tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fine-tuning can be\nperformed using a small fraction of the bespoke data, yielding models that are\ncomparable to, and sometimes better than, fully-trained bespoke models."}
