The sense of the community has\nbeen that, given a prospective metal hydride and pressure, the energy landscape\ncan be surveyed computationally for thermodynamic and dynamic stability, the\nEliashberg spectral function with its required input (energy bands, phonon\nmodes, coupling matrix elements) can be calculated, and the critical\ntemperature T$_c$ obtained. Satisfyingly large values of the electron-phonon\ncoupling strength $\\lambda$=2-3 at high mean frequency are obtained, giving\nvery reasonable agreement with existing high T$_c$ hydrides. Typically 80-85\\%\nof $\\lambda$ is attributable to high frequency H vibrations. This much was\nenvisioned by Ashcroft two decades ago, so why should there be any angst? This\npaper addresses more specifically the question {\\it why hydrogen?} Light mass\nis indeed a factor, but with possibilities not yet explored. This paper\nprovides a concise overview of related formal developments occurring\nsporadically over several decades that, when implemented, could resolve the\nquestion of {\\it why hydrogen, why so high T$_c$.} The dearth of success of\nnumerous high throughput searches proposing higher T$_c$ materials, especially\nhydrides, is touched on briefly.

In 3D heterostructures,\nstates that occupy different planes can simultaneously contribute to the signal\ndetected by the microscope probe, which complicates image analysis and\ninterpretation.

Since the chirality of the edge states and sign\nof the Chern number are determined by the underlying ferromagnetic\npolarization, manipulation of ferromagnetism would realize control of the\nCI/FCI states.

In this context, drag refers to the appearance of a\nstationary voltage in the passive wire in response to a current bias applied to\nthe active one. Quantum phase slips (QPS) in the biased wire generate voltage\nfluctuations that can be transmitted to the other. Using perturbative and\nsemiclassical approaches, we show that when both wires are superconducting the\ninduced voltage vanishes due to exact cancellation of plasmon contributions. By\ncontrast, when the second wire is tuned below the superconductor-insulator\ntransition and develops a mass gap, this cancellation is lifted and a finite\ndrag voltage emerges. The drag coefficient exhibits a crossover from weak drag\nin short wires to a maximal value set by the mutual capacitance in long wires.\nA semiclassical picture of voltage pulse propagation clarifies the physical\norigin of the effect: the mass term synchronizes plasmon modes and prevents\ncomplete cancellation of induced signals. Our results establish a mechanism of\nmass-induced Coulomb drag in low-dimensional superconductors and suggest new\nroutes for probing nonlocal transport near quantum criticality."}
