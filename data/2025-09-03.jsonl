In doped Hund's\nmetals, such as the iron-based superconductors, effects like charge doping and\nchemical pressure are often considered dominant. Here, we investigate spin\nexcitations in Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Cr$_x$)$_2$As$_{2}$ (CrBFA) by high-resolution\nResonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) for samples with $x = 0, 0.035,$ and\n$ 0.085$. In CrBFA, Cr acts as a hole dopant, but also introduces localized\nspins that compete with Fe-derived magnetic excitations. We found that the\nFe-derived magnetic excitations are softened primarily by damping, becoming\noverdamped for $x = 0.085$. At this doping level, complementary angle-resolved\nphotoemission spectroscopy measurements (ARPES) show the absence of electronic\nstructure reconstruction effects such as the nematic band splitting.

Due to the limited availability of suitable\nchiral-crystal materials, their unconventional superconductivity (SC) remains\nlargely unexplored. Here, we report the discovery of unconventional SC in the\nLa(Rh,Ir)Si family of materials by combining muon-spin spectroscopy,\nband-structure calculations, and perturbation theory. This family,\ncharacterized by a double-helix chiral structure, hosts exotic multifold\nfermions that are absent in other topological chiral crystals. While LaRhSi\nbehaves as a fully-gapped superconductor, the substitution of 4$d$-Rh by\n5$d$-Ir significantly enhances the SOC and leads to the emergence of\ntopological nodal-line SC in LaIrSi. The developed model shows that the\nnodal-line SC arises from an isotropic SOC with a specific strength.

Using analytical\ncalculations in a general two-band, we show that the quantum geometric\ncontribution to the Meissner response from odd-frequency pairs is always\ndiamagnetic for its interband processes, while intraband processes always yield\na paramagnetic response. With odd-frequency pairing itself generated by\ninterband pairing, an overall diamagnetic response may often be anticipated.

To\nbetter understand the many-body normal state from which superconductivity\narises, it is important to ascertain the nature and role of correlations in its\nelectronic structure. To provide insights into this question, we use a fully\ncharge self-consistent DFT+e-DMFT (eDMFT) approach to study La327 at several\ncompressive strain levels. At the strain level where superconductivity has been\nobserved experimentally (-2\\%), in contrast with DFT and DFT+$U$ results, the\nso-called $\\gamma$ pocket emerges and the associated band, of mostly $d_{z^2}$\ncharacter, crosses the Fermi level exhibiting `flat band''-like features when\ndynamical correlations are included.

Key\nparameters include cathode electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) and\ncatalyst layer thickness. Halving catalyst layer thickness increases FE to C2H4\nby 2% and lowers the cell voltage by 40 mV. In contrast, a tenfold decrease in\nECSA results increases the FE to C2H4 by 7% but leads increase cell voltage at\na given current density by 150 mV. This tradeoff occurs because the potential\ndistribution within the cathode catalyst layer is the primary driving force for\nC2H4 formation. Increased cell voltage also raises the energy cost of C2H4\nproduction. This model framework enables techno-economic assessments and\nidentifies key factors that must be optimized to enable economically viable\nproduction of C2H4 via electrochemical reduction of CO2."}

Here we demonstrate reentrant\nsuperconductivity as a function of both temperature and magnetic field, tuned\nby radio frequency (RF) power in a relatively simple system: granular aluminum\n(grAl), which exhibits the properties of a naturally occurring Josephson\njunction array. At low temperatures, giant Shapiro steps emerge, exhibiting\ncharacteristics of a single Josephson junction. Coherent phase locking across\nthe array's multiple junctions amplifies the quantized voltage, enabling\ntunability at radio frequencies, as observed in artificially designed Josephson\narrays. We show that our system can be tuned from a coherent superconducting\n(stiff-phase) to an insulating (phase-fluctuating) state using RF power.

If memory decays as\n$1/\\tau$ or slower, where $\\tau$ is the time backward into the past, the\nlocalized solutions are the same as with perfect, non-decaying memory and they\nare linearly stable. If forgetting is faster than $1/\\tau$, for instance\nexponential, an unusual regime of intermittent localization is observed, where\nwell localized periods of exponentially distributed duration are interspersed\nwith intervals of diffusive motion. At the transition between the two regimes,\nfor a kernel in $1/\\tau$, the approach to the stable localized state is the\nfastest, opposite to the expected critical slowing down effect.

In this paper, we mitigate this restriction by introducing a new\nclass of observables that do not exhibit the exact antisymmetry but only change\nthe sign under time reversal. We call it generalized time reversal and derive a\nbroadly applicable thermodynamic uncertainty relation for observables with this\ncondition. The generalization is achieved by direct statistical arguments on\nthe probability distributions of dissipation and the observable, and holds for\nboth deterministic and stochastic dynamics. We demonstrate the derived\nthermodynamic uncertainty relation in a quantum refrigeration model, showing\nthat the precision of generalized observables remains expressible in terms of\nthe heat-dissipation cost. The result extends the scope of thermodynamic\nuncertainty relations beyond what was reached by frameworks relying on strong\nsymmetries imposed by fluctuation theorems."}

In flat band systems, where geometric effects dominate, the\ndiamagnetic odd-frequency response can even exceed the even-frequency\ncontribution, making odd-frequency pairs the primary source of the diamagnetic\nMeissner response. In a dispersive two-band system with finite quantum\ngeometry, we similarly find a robust diamagnetic contribution from\nodd-frequency pairing, even when the total response turns paramagnetic due to\neven-frequency contributions. These results establish that quantum geometry\nstabilizes odd-frequency superconductivity and also identify flat-band\nmaterials as candidates for realizing odd-frequency superconductivity with a\ndiamagnetic Meissner effect."}

While both\nmethods are theoretically exact in the limit of large bond dimensions, a recent\nstudy reported up to 60% discrepancy in their calculations for exciton\ndissociation. To resolve this inconsistency, we conduct a systematic comparison\nusing Renormalizer, a unified software framework for matrix product states\n(MPS) and tree tensor network states (TTNS). By revisiting the benchmark\nP3HT:PCBM heterojunction model, we show that the observed discrepancies arise\nprimarily from insufficient bond dimensions. By increasing bond dimensions, we\nfirst reduce the difference to less than 10%. Further refinement using an\nextrapolation scheme and an optimized tensor network structure lowers the\ndifference to approximately 2%. Our results confirm both methods converge to\nnumerically exact solutions when bond dimensions are adequately scaled. This\nwork not only validates the reliability of both methods but also provides\nhigh-accuracy benchmark data for future developments in quantum dynamics\nsimulations."}

In this method, the Kohn-Sham (KS) wave functions\nare propagated forward in time, and in principle, one can extract any\nobservable at any given time. Alternatively, by taking a Fourier transform,\nspectroscopic quantities can be extracted. There are many publicly available\ncodes implementing rt-TDDFT, which differ in their numeric solution of the KS\nequations, their available exchange-correlation functionals, and in their\nanalysis capabilities. For users of rt-TDDFT, this is an inconvenient situation\nbecause they may need to use a numerical method that is available in one code,\nbut an analysis method available in another. Here, we introduce rhodent, a\nmodular Python package for processing the output of rt-TDDFT calculations. Our\npackage can be used to calculate hot-carrier distributions, energies, induced\ndensities, and dipole moments, and various decompositions thereof. In its\ncurrent version, rhodent handles calculation results from the gpaw code, but\ncan readily be extended to support other rt-TDDFT codes. Additionally, under\nthe assumption of linear response, rhodent can be used to calculate the\nresponse to a narrow-band laser, from the response to a broad-band\nperturbation, greatly speeding up the analysis of frequency-dependent\nexcitations. We demonstrate the capabilities of rhodent via a set of examples,\nfor systems consisting of Al and Ag clusters and organic molecules."}

Recently, we demonstrated the\nhighly selective synthesis of kekulene (>99%) on Cu(111) and isokekulene (92%)\non Cu(110) from the same molecular precursor (Ruan et al., Angew. Chem. Int.\nEd. 2025, e202509932). Scanning tunneling microscopy with CO-functionalized\ntips can identify the single molecules on the basis of their geometric\nstructure at a low coverage on Cu(110), but it also detects complex features\ndue to electronic contributions close to the Fermi energy. Here, we investigate\nthe origin of these features by simulating STM images based on a weighted sum\nof multiple molecular orbitals, for which we employ weights based on the\ncalculated molecular-orbital projected density of states. This allows for an\nexperimental confirmation of charge transfer from the surface into multiple\nformerly unoccupied molecular orbitals for single molecules of kekulene as well\nas isokekulene in its two nonplanar adsorption configurations. In comparison,\nthe area-integrating photoemission orbital tomography technique confirms the\ncharge transfer as well as the high selectivity for the formation of a full\nmonolayer of mainly isokekulene on Cu(110). Our STM-based approach is\napplicable to a wide range of adsorbed molecular systems and specifically also\nsuited for strongly interacting surfaces, nonplanar molecules, and such\nmolecules which can only be prepared at extremely low yields."}

However, it remains\nunclear how such environmental variation influences adaptation, what is learned\nin the process, and whether memory of past conditions is retained. In this\nwork, we investigate these questions using athermal disordered systems that are\nsubject to cyclic inverse design, enabling them to attain target elastic\nproperties spanning a chosen range. We demonstrate that such systems evolve\ntoward a marginally absorbing manifold (MAM), which encodes memory of the\ntraining range that closely resembles return-point memory observed in\ncyclically driven systems. We further propose a general mechanism for the\nformation of MAMs and the corresponding memory that is based on gradient\ndiscontinuities in the trained quantities. Our model provides a simple and\nbroadly applicable physical framework for understanding how adaptive systems\nlearn under environmental change and how they retain memory of past\nexperiences."}

This is\nachieved by introducing mathematical and computational methods that estimate\nthe probability of transmission trees by combining generative models that\njointly determine the number of infected hosts, the probability of infection\nbetween them depending on location and genetic information, and their time of\ninfection and sampling. We introduce a suitable Markov Chain Monte Carlo method\nthat we show to sample trees according to their probability. Statistics\nperformed over the sampled trees lead to probabilistic estimations of network\nproperties and other quantities of interest, such as the number of unobserved\nhosts and the depth of the infection tree. We confirm the validity of our\napproach by comparing the numerical results with analytically solvable\nexamples. Finally, we apply our methodology to data from COVID-19 in Australia.\nWe find that network properties that are important for the management of the\noutbreak depend sensitively on the type of data used in the inference."}
