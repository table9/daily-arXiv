Below its Curie\ntemperature, Mn3Si2Te6 hosts chiral orbital currents (COC) that circulate\nwithin the crystal lattice and give rise to collective electronic behavior [1].\nBy applying a magnetic field along the hard c axis and driving the system with\nlow-frequency currents, we uncover a giant inductive response up to millihenry\nscale, originating from first-order reconfigurations of COC domains. These\ndomains act as coherent mesoscopic inductive elements that resist reversal upon\ncurrent reduction, producing a large electromotive force and sharply increasing\nvoltage. This emergent inductance defies classical models, occurs without\nsuperconductivity or engineered nanostructures, and opens a new frontier in\norbital-based quantum functionality and device concepts."}

This phenomenon is understood\nby the supposition that such an antiferromagnet undergoes field-induced\npartitioning of its spin lattice into ferrimagnetic fragments. We searched for\na theoretical basis for this supposition by investigating how external magnetic\nfields affect the magnetic entropy of such an antiferromagnet, to find that the\nfield region of the magnetization plateau has a single magnetic phase, but a\nnonzero slope region of the magnetization curve has two magnetic phases of\ndifferent magnetic entropy, and that the magnetic entropy of a single-phase\nregion does not depend on magnetic field but that of a two-phase region does.\nWe tested these predictions by carrying out magnetization and specific heat\nmeasurements for g-Mn3(PO4)2. It was found that the magnetic entropy of the\ntwo-phase region increases with field, indicating that field-induced breaking\nof magnetic bonds and hence field-induced partitioning of an antiferromagnetic\nspin lattice are time-averaged results of all allowed spin arrangements that\noccur repeatedly during static magnetization measurements. The\ntemperature-dependent magnetic specific heats of g-Mn3(PO4)2 between 2 - 6 K\nshows a larger excitation gap when measured at 9 T than at 0 T, suggesting that\nthese energy gaps reflect the two successive local excitations of linear\nMn2+-Mn2+-Mn2+ ferrimagnetic trimers embedded in the antiferromagnetic spin\nlattice of g-Mn3(PO4)2 and arise from the Boltzmann factor associated with\nthese excitations"}

However, systematic investigations of the fast dynamics and\nfundamental speed limits of martensitic transformations are scarce. Especially\nfor ultrashort time transformations, the temperature evolution throughout the\ntransformation is not measured, which is a substantial shortcoming as\ntemperature is the intrinsic force driving the transformation. Here, we present\na synchrotron-based time-resolved X-ray diffraction study of a 270 fs\nlaser-induced martensitic transformation in a Ni-Mn-Ga-based epitaxial thin\nfilm.

Our findings reveal that the\nluminescence intensity is higher by up to 40% for circularly polarized\nexcitation compared to linearly polarized excitation for laser energy above the\nfree carrier gap. We show that this spin-dependent exciton emission is a\nfingerprint of the bimolecular formation process. Importantly, we observe that\nexciton linear polarization (valley coherence) persists even for laser\nexcitation energies exceeding the gap. We demonstrate that it is the result of\na fraction of excitons formed by a geminate process. This shows that two\nformation processes coexist for excitation energies above the gap, where both\nmechanisms operate concurrently."}

The\nmanipulation of domain switching behaviour is moderately attainable in\nepitaxial heterostructures by exploiting the valence or lattice mismatch at\nheterointerfaces, which is generally constrained by the necessity for two\ndimensional architectures. In this study, domain-engineered bulk ferroelectric\nheterostructures (DE-BFH), constructed via elemental partitioning, are employed\nto unleash full potential of bulk ferroelectrics, providing comprehensive\ncontrol of domain switching characteristics and adjustable reversibility within\nthe entire range of ferroelectric texture space. Exemplar DE-BFH ceramics\nexhibit unprecedented enhancement in reversible electrostrain and stability in\nboth axial and shear modes, including a record high peak to peak shear strain\nup to 0.9% at intermediate field levels, confirmed by digital image correlation\nmeasurements and in-situ synchrotron XRD studies. The advancement of domain\nswitching behaviour in DE-BFH could also promote development of new types of\nlead-free piezoelectric devices, including actuators, energy harvesters,\nmultiple state memory devices, and domain wall switch. Moreover, design concept\nof DE-BFH could contribute to the creation of distinctive ferroelastic,\nferromagnetic, and multiferroic materials by broadening its scope to the entire\nferroic family, encompassing polycrystalline, single-crystal, and thin-film\nforms."}

Here, combining angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy\n(ARPES) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we demonstrate that\n3R alpha-In2Se3 phase exhibits a robust inversion of the valence band\nparabolicity at the Gamma point forming a bow-shaped dispersion with a depth of\n140 +- 10 meV between the valence band maximum (VBM) along the GammaK direction\nof the Brillouin zone (BZ). Moreover, we unveil an indirect band gap of about\n1.25 eV, as well as a highly electron doping of approximatively 5.1012\nelectrons per cmsquare at the surface. This leads to surface band bending and\nthe formation of a prominent electron accumulation layer. These findings allow\na deeper understanding of the rhombohedral alpha-In2Se3 electronic properties\nunderlying the potential of III/VI semiconductors for electronic and photonic\ntechnologies."}

However, systematic investigations of the fast dynamics and\nfundamental speed limits of martensitic transformations are scarce. Especially\nfor ultrashort time transformations, the temperature evolution throughout the\ntransformation is not measured, which is a substantial shortcoming as\ntemperature is the intrinsic force driving the transformation. Here, we present\na synchrotron-based time-resolved X-ray diffraction study of a 270 fs\nlaser-induced martensitic transformation in a Ni-Mn-Ga-based epitaxial thin\nfilm. We observe the transformation from martensite to austenite within about\n100 ps, just limited by the synchrotron probe pulse duration. Furthermore, a\nfull transformation cycle from martensite to austenite and back to martensite\ncan almost be finished within 5 ns, which is the fastest martensitic\ntransformation reported so far. Measurements and calculations of the\ntemperature evolution allow us to analyse the influence of temperature on\ntransformation time.

We discover\nthat the low-energy spin waves emerge from the $M$ points -- transverse to the\nmagnetic Bragg peaks -- providing direct evidence of anisotropic magnetic\ninteractions in $\\alpha$-RuCl$_{3}$. The intrinsic spin-wave spectrum imposes\nstringent constraints on the extended Kitaev Hamiltonian, yielding a refined,\nquantitatively consistent set of exchange couplings for the zigzag ground state\nand its low-energy dynamics.
