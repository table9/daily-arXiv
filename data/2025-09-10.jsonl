Concretely, we consider a Kitaev ladder model in a uniform\nmagnetic field, whose spin degrees of freedom fractionalize into visons and\nspinons.

These systems, dubbed altermagnets,\nhave been the subject of intense study with direct spectroscopic evidence, from\nARPES and RIXS, techniques reported in a handful of materials in the last year.\nInelastic neutron scattering (INS) is one of the most powerful direct probes of\nmagnetism and has recently been used to witness a splitting of magnon bands in\nMnTe that is compatible with altermagnetism although the nature and origin of\nthe splitting remain to be fully characterized. However, the full power of\nneutron scattering for such systems comes from using polarized neutrons to\nmeasure the chirality of the magnon bands. Such a measurement provides a direct\ncharacterization of altermagnetism directly from the spin wave excitations. In\nthis article, we present results on MnF$_2$ once thought to be an archetypal\nantiferromagnet. We present a polarized INS data that demonstrate the material\nis, in fact, altermagnetic. It had long been realized that the magnon bands in\nthis material should have a weak splitting coming from the long-range dipolar\ncoupling. Our data is the first to visualize this splitting directly. While the\ndipolar splitting on its own is not altermagnetic, using a domain biased\nsample, the data reveals a nonzero chirality in the neutron scattering cross\nsection that reverses sign between the two magnon modes. It is this feature\nthat clearly demonstrates altermagnetism in MnF$_2$. This finding highlights\nthe potential for polarized INS to characterize altermagnets not least through\nits exquisite sensitivity to fine-structure in the magnon spectrum."}

The electron spin susceptibility obtained from the gauge\ntheory shares many features with experimental observations in the pseudogap\nregime of cuprate superconductors: the dynamical spin susceptibility\n$S(\\mathbf{q},\\omega)$ has a spin gap, the static uniform spin susceptibility\n$\\kappa_s$ decreases strongly with temperature below $T^*$, and the NMR\nrelaxation rate $T_1^{-1}$ vanishes exponentially in the low temperature limit\nif the ground state is quantum disordered. At low hole doping,\n$S(\\mathbf{q},\\omega)$ exhibits nematicity below a transition temperature\n$T_{\\rm nem} < T^*$, and at larger hole doping in the entire pseudogap regime\nbelow $T^*$."}

One of the most\npopular techniques to qualify the SOTs is the switching angle shift, where the\napplied direct current was assumed to shift, via domain wall depinning during\nthe anti-domain expansion, the switching angle of a perpendicular magnetization\nin a linear proportion manner under a large rotating magnetic field. Here, we\nreport that, for the most commonly employed perpendicular magnetization\nheterostructures in spintronics (e.g., those based on FeCoB, Co, and Co/Ni\nmultilayers), the switching angle shift considerably misestimates the SOT\nwithin the domain wall depinning analysis of the slope of the linear-in-current\nscaling and may also have a non-zero residual value at zero direct current. Our\nexperiments and simulations unveil that the switching angle shift is most\nlikely dominated by the chiral asymmetric nucleation rather than the expansion\nof the anti-domains. The in-plane field from external magnet and\ncurrent-induced SOTs lower the perpendicular nucleation field and thus the\nrequired switching angle, ultimately leading to underestimation of the SOTs by\nthe domain wall depinning analysis. These results have advanced the\nunderstanding of magnetization switching of spintronic devices."}

Motivated by this, we extend the theory of the\nEliashberg effect, originally developed for superconducting phases, to\ncharge-density-wave phases. Starting from a minimal electronic model where\nsuperconductivity and charge-density-wave order are equivalent at equilibrium,\nwe introduce coupling to cavity photons, which are in turn coupled to an\nenvironment at a temperature different from the one of the electronic\nenvironment. This drives the system into a non-thermal steady state, which\nbreaks the equivalence between superconductivity and charge-density-wave order.\nIn the superconducting case, we recover the known behavior: a shift from\ncontinuous to discontinuous phase transitions with bistability. In contrast,\nthe charge-density-wave case displays richer behavior: tuning the cavity\nfrequency induces both continuous and discontinuous transitions, two distinct\nordered phases, and a bistable regime ending at a critical point. These\nfindings demonstrate that the scope of cavity-based non-thermal control of\nquantum materials is broader than at thermal equilibrium, and strongly depends\non the targeted phases."}
