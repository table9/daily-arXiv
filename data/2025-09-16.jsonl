Accurate modeling requires an integrated\nnumerical framework capable of resolving large relative motions, multiphase\ninteractions, and nonlinear contact responses. Building on our previously\ndeveloped fully Eulerian fluid structure formulation, we introduce a phase\nfield based formulation for dynamic frictional contact in 3D. Contact detection\nis achieved via the overlap of diffuse interfaces of colliding solids. The\nnormal contact response is defined as a volumetric body force proportional to\nthe overlap parameter, while the tangential response is computed using the\nCoulomb friction model. The direction of the friction forces are derived by\nprojecting phase-averaged relative velocities onto the local tangent plane of\ncolliding bodies. This proposed unified treatment enables the computation of\nboth normal and frictional forces within a single momentum balance equation,\navoiding separate velocity fields for individual solids. We present several\ntest cases with increasing complexity to verify and demonstrate our proposed\nfrictional contact model. Verification against the Hertzian contact problem\nshows excellent agreement with the analytical solution, with errors below $3\\%$\nin the traction profile. In the sliding block benchmark, the computed\ndisplacement profiles closely follow the analytical solution for point-mass\nsystems across multiple friction coefficients. The ironing problem demonstrates\nstable force predictions under finite deformation, with normal and tangential\nforces matching kinetic friction laws. The robustness and scalability of the\nproposed formulation are further demonstrated through a representative ship ice\ninteraction scenario with free surface and frictional sliding effects."}

This Haldane state, arising\nfrom underscreening of the $S=3/2$ chain, is stable against small $D$ and\ncharacterized by topological edge modes. The nature of the $D$-driven\ntransitions out of this state depends on the environment. Coupling to a metal\n(semi-metal) is a relevant (irrelevant) perturbation at the decoupled fixed\npoint between the spin-1 chain and the two-dimensional electron gas. In the\nlarge positive $D$ limit, the system maps onto an anisotropic spin-$1/2$ Kondo\nsystem. For large negative $D$, in the Ising phase, spins are frozen. For small\n$J_k$, the nature of the metallic phase dominates. On a two-dimensional\nsemi-metal, the Kondo coupling is irrelevant at the decoupled fixed point\n($J_k= 0$), leading to a Kondo breakdown phase at weak coupling, irrespective\nof $D$. In contrast, on a two-dimensional metal, the resulting dissipative\nOhmic bath is a marginally relevant perturbation, inducing antiferromagnetic\nordering along the chain. In this case, $D$ drives a spin-flop transition\nbetween Ising and XY ordered phases. At $D=0$, we observe continuous\ntransitions between the Kondo breakdown or dissipation-induced long-range\nordered phases and the underscreened Haldane phase. These phase diagrams are\nsupported by scaling arguments and sign-free auxiliary-field quantum Monte\nCarlo simulations."}

Atomic\nlattice vibrations (phonons) are often a key contributor to the formation of\nlong-range dipole textures based on ferroelectrics and impact the properties of\nthe emergent phases. Here, using monochromated, momentum-resolved electron\nenergy-loss spectroscopy (qEELS) with nanometer spatial resolution and\nmeV-spectral-precision, we demonstrate that polar vortex lattices in PbTiO$_3$\nspatially modulate the material's vibrational spectrum in patterns that\ndirectly reflect the overlying symmetry of the topological patterns. Moreover,\nby combining experiments with molecular dynamics simulations using machine\nlearned potentials we reveal how these structures modify phonon modes across\nthe vibrational spectrum. Beyond simple intensity modulation, we find that the\nchirality of the vortex topology imparts its unique symmetry onto phonons,\nproducing a distinctive asymmetrical spectral shift across the vortex unit\ncell. Finally, the high spatial resolution of the technique enables topological\ndefects to be probed directly, demonstrating a return to trivial PbTiO$_3$\nmodes at vortex dislocation cores.

Unlike atomic crystals, in\nnanocrystal superlattices a single misplaced particle can affect the positions\nof neighbors over long distances, leading to cumulative disorder. This elusive\nform of collective particle displacement leaves clear signatures in\ndiffraction, but little is known about how it accumulates and propagates\nthroughout the superlattice. Here we rationalize propagation and accumulation\nof disorder in a series of CsPbBr3 nanocrystal superlattices by using\nsynchrotron grazing incidence small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering. CsPbBr3\nnanocrystals of colloidal softness S in the range of 0.3-0.7 were obtained by\npreparing particles with different sizes and ligand mixtures, consisting of\noleic acid and primary amines of variable lengths. Most diffraction patterns\nshowed clear signatures of anisotropic disorder, with multilayer diffraction\ncharacteristics of high structural coherence visible only for the {100} axial\ndirections and lost in all other directions. As the softness decreased, the\nsuperlattices transitioned to a more ordered regime where small-angle\ndiffraction peaks became resolution-limited, and superlattice multilayer\ndiffraction appeared for the (110) diagonal reflections.

Importantly, the\nformation of localized Ce3+ polarons introduces occupied 4f states that\nstrongly hybridize with surface O 2p orbitals, resulting in new occupied\nelectronic states below the Fermi level. This orbital hybridization activates\nthe O 2p states, enhances their electron-donating capacity, and facilitates the\ndissociation of adsorbed molecules such as H2O.

Recently, a simple\nformula has been conjectured to shortcut this last step, and compute the\ncumulant generating function of different observables (integrated current or\nposition of a tracer) without the need to compute any integral. In this work,\nwe prove this simple formula, and extend it to more general observables. We\nthen illustrate the efficiency of this approach by applying it to compute the\nvariance of a generalised current in the semi-infinite symmetric exclusion\nprocess and the joint properties of two occupation times in any diffusive\nsystem. In the case of the integrated current, our formula can be interpreted\nas a generalisation of Fick's law to obtain all the cumulants of the current\nbeyond the average value."}

The van\nder Waals interaction is shown to be crucial for determining the adsorption\nenergy. Some electrons transfer from the substrate to the molecules upon\nsurface adsorption, resulting in a reduction of the magnetic anisotropy energy\nof Mn$_{12}$. Since the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of Mn$_{12}$ is\nclose to the valence band of MoS$_2$, a negative electric field is more\neffective in modulating charge transfer and energy band alignment, and thus\naltering the magnetic anisotropy energy, compared with a positive electric\nfield. A significant increase in the magnetic anisotropy energy of Mn$_{12}$\nwith the ligand R=CHCl$_2$ or R=C$_6$H$_5$ under a sufficiently high electric\nfield has been predicted. Our calculations show that the molecules remain\nintact on the surface both before and after the electric field is applied.\nFinally, a two-level system formed by different adsorption configurations is\nevaluated, and the tunability of its energy barrier under an electric field is\ndemonstrated. Our study sheds light on tuning the properties of single-molecule\nmagnets using an electric field, when the molecules are supported on a surface."}

The ANC geometry enables strong\ndipolar coupling at sub-50 nm separations while preserving independent current\nbias for each oscillator. We first characterize the auto-oscillation of a\nsingle ANC-SHNO, revealing a broad frequency tuning range and a\nfield-controlled crossover between negative and positive nonlinearities. We\nthen demonstrate that two such oscillators can mutually synchronize solely via\ndipolar stray fields, without electrical or spin-wave coupling. Depending on\nthe bias conditions, the coupled pair exhibits robust in-phase (0{\\deg}) or\nout-of-phase (180{\\deg}) locking. Notably, we find a bias-dependent amplitude\ncorrelation: when the oscillators sustain comparable amplitudes, both in-phase\nand out-of-phase synchronization are accessible, whereas amplitude imbalance\ndrives the system into an out-of-phase state accompanied by suppression of the\nweaker oscillator. By combining strong conservative coupling with independent\nfrequency and gain control, the ANC-SHNO platform provides a scalable route\ntoward phased oscillator arrays, neuromorphic computing architectures, and\nexperimental exploration of non-Hermitian spintronic dynamics."}

For small skyrmion clusters in\nthe conical phase, three-body interactions make a substantial contribution to\nthe cohesive energy, comparable to that of pairwise terms, while four-body\nterms become relevant only at small magnetic fields. As the system approaches\nthe ferromagnetic phase, these higher-order contributions vanish, and the\ninteractions become essentially pairwise.

Our setup comprises of a bilayer system where a $d$-wave AM\nis proximity coupled to an ordinary $s$-wave superconductor (SC). We calculate\nthe thermoelectric current carried by the quasiparticles applying a finite\nthermal bias accross the junction. The behavior of the thermoelectric current\nwith the system's base temperature and chemical potential is very similar to\nthat in traditional SC heterostructures.
