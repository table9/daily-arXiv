However, the validity of interchanging the infinite-time and\ninfinite-particle limits is not guaranteed.

In many complex systems, however,\ndiffusion deviates from classical Brownian behaviour, exhibiting striking\nphenomena such as Brownian yet non-Gaussian diffusion (BYNGD) and anomalous\ndiffusion. BYNGD describes a frequently observed statistical feature\ncharacterised by the coexistence of linear mean-square displacement (MSD) and\nnon-Gaussian displacement distributions. Anomalous diffusion, in contrast,\ninvolves a nonlinear time dependence of the MSD and often reflects mechanisms\nsuch as trapping, viscoelasticity, heterogeneity, or active processes.

To accomplish this,\nwe build upon our previous work on physics-aware recurrent convolutions (PARC).\nPARC embeds knowledge of underlying physics into its neural network\narchitecture for more robust and accurate prediction of evolving physical\nfields.

In many complex systems, however,\ndiffusion deviates from classical Brownian behaviour, exhibiting striking\nphenomena such as Brownian yet non-Gaussian diffusion (BYNGD) and anomalous\ndiffusion. BYNGD describes a frequently observed statistical feature\ncharacterised by the coexistence of linear mean-square displacement (MSD) and\nnon-Gaussian displacement distributions.

A theoretical model based on lack of inversion symmetry and\nfinite-range attraction reproduces the observed multi-gap structure as a mixed\nsinglet-triplet state. These results establish misfit compounds as a powerful\nplatform for studying unconventional superconductivity in isolated 1H layers\nand for realizing multiple uncoupled superconductors within a single crystal."}

However,\nconsensus understanding of their distinct photophysical and electroluminescent\ndynamics remains elusive. This work correlates the chemical and electronic\nchanges occurring in a QLED during operation using depth-resolved and operando\ntechniques. The results indicate that oxygen vacancy forms in the ZnMgO layer\nduring operation, with important implications on the charge injection and\nelectrochemical dynamics.

To address this gap, we introduce a new set of OPs, called\nPoint Group Order Parameters (PGOPs), designed to continuously quantify point\ngroup symmetry order. We demonstrate the strength and utility of PGOP in\ndetecting order across different crystalline systems and compare its\nperformance to commonly used bond-orientational order metrics. PGOP\ncalculations for all non-infinite point groups are implemented in the\nopen-source package SPATULA (Symmetry Pattern Analysis Toolkit for\nUnderstanding Local Arrangements), written in parallelized C++ with a Python\ninterface. The code is publicly available on GitHub."}

Phys. Chem. B 105, 3093 (2001)], UAM-I [J. Mol. Liq.\n323, 114576 (2021)] and OPLS/2016 [J. Chem. Phys. 145, 034508 (2016)]. The\neffects of pressure, between 1 bar and 6 kbar, have been evaluated on total\nscattering structure factors, partial radial distribution functions, as well as\non collective characteristics such as ring size distributions and cluster size\ndistributions. Agreement with experimental density is nearly quantitative for\nall the three force fields, and major trends observed for recent pressure\ndependent neutron diffraction data are reproduced qualitatively. The OPLS/2016\nforce field, in general, generates properties that are markedly different from\nresults originating from the other potentials. Pressure effects are hardly\nnoticeable on most partial radial distribution functions and on the\ndistribution of the number of hydrogen bonded neighbours. On the other hand,\ncollective structural properties, like cluster- and ring size distributions\nexhibit significant changes with increasing pressure: larger clusters become\nmore numerous, whereas the number of cyclic clusters, i.e., rings, decrease.\nThe self-diffusion coefficient decreases with increasing pressure, and the same\nis valid for the average lifetime of hydrogen bonds."}

The thermostat schemes considered include the Nos\\'e--Hoover\nthermostat and its chain generalisation, the Bussi velocity rescaling method,\nand several implementations of the Langevin dynamics. Using a binary\nLennard-Jones liquid as a model glass former, we investigated how the sampling\nof physical observables, such as particle velocities and potential energy,\nresponds to changes in time step across these thermostats. While the\nNos\\'e--Hoover chain and Bussi thermostats provide reliable temperature\ncontrol, a pronounced time-step dependence was observed in the potential\nenergy. Amongst the Langevin methods, the Gr{\\o}nbech-Jensen--Farago scheme\nprovided the most consistent sampling of both temperature and potential energy.\nNonetheless, Langevin dynamics typically incurs approximately twice the\ncomputational cost due to the overhead of random number generation, and\nexhibits a systematic decrease in diffusion coefficients with increasing\nfriction. This study presents a broad comparison of thermostat methods using a\nbinary Lennard-Jones glass-former model, offering practical guidance for the\nchoice of thermostats in classical molecular dynamics simulations.

This method integrates\nmemory kernel coupling theory (MKCT) with the density matrix renormalization\ngroup (DMRG), extending our recent work on MKCT to strongly correlated systems.\nThe method establishes that correlation functions can be derived from the\nmoments. Within our framework, operators and wavefunctions are represented as\nmatrix product operators (MPOs) and matrix product states (MPSs), respectively.\nCrucially, the repeated application of the Liouville operator is achieved\nthrough an iterative procedure analogous to the DMRG algorithm itself. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of MKCT-DMRG by computing the\nspectral function of the Hubbard model. Furthermore, we successfully apply the\nmethod to compute the electronic friction in the Hubbard-Holstein model. In all\ncases, the results show excellent agreement with time-dependent DMRG (TD-DMRG)\nbenchmarks. The advantage of MKCT-DMRG over TD-DMRG is the computational\nefficiency, which avoids expensive real-time propagation in TD-DMRG. These\nfindings establish MKCT-DMRG as a promising and accurate framework for\nsimulating challenging dynamical properties in strongly correlated quantum\nsystems."}
