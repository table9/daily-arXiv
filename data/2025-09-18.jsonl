A particularly striking experimental observation is the recurring\ncorrelation between nematicity in the normal state -- manifested by spontaneous\nbreaking of the underlying $C_3$ symmetry -- and the stabilization of robust\nsuperconducting phases. Despite its ubiquity across different materials,\ndevices and experiments, this trend has thus far lacked a clear microscopic\nexplanation. In this work, we identify a concrete mechanism linking nematic\norder to enhanced superconductivity. We demonstrate that $C_3$-symmetry\nbreaking strongly reshapes the Bloch wavefunctions near the Fermi level,\nproducing a pronounced enhancement and redistribution of the so-called quantum\nmetric. This effect drastically amplifies superconducting pairing mediated by\nthe quantum geometric Kohn-Luttinger mechanism [G.

In addition to strongly bound excitons, we find\nthat linearly polarized light selectively excites valley spin-polarized\nexcitons. Moreover, due to the interplay between altermagnetic spin symmetry\nand electronic orbital character, we predict that applying uniaxial strain can\nlift valley degeneracy and enable the selective excitation of spin-polarized\nexcitons, an effect not achievable in previously studied transition-metal\ndichalcogenides. These spin-valley-locked excitonic states and their strain\ntunability offer a robust mechanism for four-fold symmetric altermagnets to\nencode, store, and read valley/spin information."}

These are materials with near equiatomic mixing of five or\nmore principal elements, and such compositional complexity often leads to\nimprovements in mechanical properties and high thermal stability, etc. Thus,\nhigh-entropy alloys have found their applications in domains like aerospace,\nbiomedical, energy storage, catalysis, electronics, etc. However, the vast\ncompositional design and experimental exploration of high-entropy alloys are\nboth time consuming and expensive and require a large number of resources.\nMachine learning techniques have thus become essential for accelerating high\nentropy alloys discovery using data driven predictions of promising alloy\ncombinations and their properties. Hence, this work employs a machine learning\nframework that predicts high entropy alloy hardness from elemental descriptors\nsuch as atomic radius, valence electron count, bond strength, etc. Machine\nlearning regression models, like LightGBM, Gradient Boosting Regressor, and\nTransformer encoder, were trained on experimental data. Additionally, a\nlanguage model was also fine tuned to predict hardness from elemental\ndescriptor strings. The results indicate that LightGBM has better accuracy in\npredicting the hardness of high entropy alloys compared to other models used in\nthis study. Further, a combinatorial technique was used to generate over 9\nmillion virtual high entropy alloy candidates, and the trained machine learning\nmodels were used to predict their hardness.

A particularly striking experimental observation is the recurring\ncorrelation between nematicity in the normal state -- manifested by spontaneous\nbreaking of the underlying $C_3$ symmetry -- and the stabilization of robust\nsuperconducting phases. Despite its ubiquity across different materials,\ndevices and experiments, this trend has thus far lacked a clear microscopic\nexplanation. In this work, we identify a concrete mechanism linking nematic\norder to enhanced superconductivity. We demonstrate that $C_3$-symmetry\nbreaking strongly reshapes the Bloch wavefunctions near the Fermi level,\nproducing a pronounced enhancement and redistribution of the so-called quantum\nmetric. This effect drastically amplifies superconducting pairing mediated by\nthe quantum geometric Kohn-Luttinger mechanism [G.

PSCs have\nenormous potential; in just ten years, their efficiency increased from 3.8% to\n25.2%, and research into new developments is still ongoing. Thermal instability\nis PSCs' main disadvantage, despite their high efficiency, flexibility, and\nlightweight nature. This paper looks at how temperature affects the ways that\nhole transport layers (HTLs) like spiro-OMeTAD and perovskite layers,\nespecially MAPbI3, degrade. Elevated temperatures cause MAPbI3 to degrade into\nPbI2, CH3I, and NH3, with decomposition rates affected by moisture, oxygen, and\nenvironmental factors. Mixed cation compositions, such as Cs-MA-FA, have higher\nthermal stability, whereas MA+ cations break-down faster under heat stress.\nHTLs deteriorate due to morphological changes and the hydrophilicity of dopant\nadditions like Li-TFSI and t-BP. Alternative dopant-free HTMs, such as P3HT and\ninorganic materials including CuSCN, NiOx, and Cu2O, have shown improved\nthermal stability and efficiency. Hybrid HTLs, dopant-free designs, and\ninterface tweaks are all viable solutions for increasing the stability of PSC.\nAddressing thermal stability issues remains crucial for the development of more\nreliable and efficient PSC technology."}

The formation of highly transparent superconducting platinum\ngermanosilicide (PtSiGe) contacts to Ge/SiGe heterostructures by solid-phase\nepitaxy between Pt and SiGe has recently been reported, although with a\nrelatively low critical temperature $<1\\,\\mathrm{K}$. Here, we present a\ncomparative study of the superconducting properties of Pt, Pd, Rh, and Ir\ngermanides, along with an in-depth characterization of Ir(Si)Ge films formed by\nsolid-phase epitaxy.

Kafle", "Zhen-Fei Liu"], "title": "Phonon-assisted photoluminescence of bilayer MoS$_2$ from first principles", "comment": "12 pages, 6 figures", "summary": "In indirect band gap materials, phonon-assisted processes are key mechanisms\nfor photoluminescence (PL). Using a first-principles many-body approach, we\nsystematically investigate the phonon-assisted PL in bilayer MoS$_2$ and its\ndependence on temperature and external tensile strain. The effects of phonons\nare accounted for using a supercell approach: we identify the phonon momenta\nthat are important to PL, construct supercells that are commensurate with these\nphonons, and examine the changes in the optical absorption after explicit\ndisplacements of atoms along each phonon mode. The PL intensity is then\nobtained via the van Roosbroeck-Shockley relationship from the optical\nabsorption spectra. This approach enables us to investigate phonon-absorption\nand phonon-emission processes separately and how each process depends on\ntemperature. Our results reveal that optical phonons associated with\nout-of-plane vibrations of S atoms and in-plane vibrations of Mo atoms\ncontribute most to the indirect PL for unstrained bilayer MoS$_2$.\nAdditionally, we also discuss how the PL spectra and the phonon contributions\nevolve with strain. In particular, we show that at high strain, additional\nphonon channels become available due to the modulation of the electronic band\nstructure."}

This surprising coexistence of oppositely charged solitons\nremarkably circumvents their anticipated annihilation. We demonstrate the\nformation and evolution of this phase in Fe films on C1v -symmetric (110)\nsurfaces of GaAs and CdTe semiconductors. Specifically, we reveal a series of\nmagnetic field-induced phase transitions: cycloidal spin-spiral to\nskyrmion-antiskyrmion lattice to conical spin-spiral to ferromagnet. The\nremarkable stability of the net-zero lattice is attributed to symmetry-enforced\nanisotropic magnetic interactions. Lowering interfacial symmetry to C1v thus\nenables frustrated chiral magnets, uniquely manifesting in thermodynamically\nstable net-zero topological soliton lattices, as revealed by our findings."}

They\nare different from Pickering emulsions, which are also surfactant-free but\nstabilized with colloidal particles. In contrast to previous studies, we\nmonitor the kinetics of the initial stages of emulsion formation. We conducted\nsuch tests in an open setup when samples are open to air and CO2 content in the\nwater varies, and in closed setup when samples are isolated with fixed CO2\ncontent. For the open setup, sonication and initial pH > 9 leads to emulsions\nwith high zeta potential and sub-micron droplet size. There are two evolution\npatterns: short- and long-terms. The short term lasts about 1 day and has\nchanging pH and zeta potential, but almost constant droplet size. The long term\nis is over several days or even weeks, with droplet size increase toward\nsaturation value (rate dependent on mixing conditions), with pH and zeta\npotential remaining constant. Emulsification at the closed setup is much less\npronounced and pH remains constant. This difference points to the importance of\nadsorbed CO2 and related carbonate ions in the formation of pristine emulsions\nand charging droplets interfaces. We hypothesize the existence of structured\nwater molecule layer at the interface, following Eastoe and Ellis. The Electric\nDouble Layer exerts a (dielectrostatic) force on the water dipole moments in\nthis layer that compensates the Kelvins pressure. The droplet size from this\nmodel is close to our measurements. Also, there is a repulsion of the water\ndipole moments, which compensates for the surface tension parallel to the\ninterface. After ruling out alternative hypotheses with our data, we conclude\nthat the model suggested for explaining the stability of nano-bubbles is also\nconsistent with our results for these pristine emulsions."}

Here we introduce a machine learning interatomic potential framework\nthat incorporates long-range electrostatics, enabling nanosecond simulations of\nmetal-electrolyte interfaces under applied electric bias with\nnear-quantum-mechanical accuracy. At the benchmark Pt(111)/water and\nPt(111)/aqueous KF electrolyte interfaces, we resolve the molecular structure\nof the EDL, reveal proton-transfer mechanisms underlying anodic water\ndissociation and the diffusion of ionic water species, and compute differential\ncapacitance. We find that the nominally inert K+ and F- ions, while leaving\ninterfacial water structure largely unchanged, screen bulk fields, slow proton\ntransfer, and generate a prominent capacitance peak near the potential of zero\ncharge.

Combining\naccurate electronic structure theory, enhanced sampling, and machine learning,\nwe fine-tune the MACE-MP0 foundation model and apply the resulting machine\nlearning potentials to obtain statistically converged free energy profiles and\nreaction rates. We confirm that the level of electronic structure theory is\nimportant, and inaccurate density functionals can overestimate the reaction\nrate by up to nine orders of magnitude.

For\nthe surface reaction, we find and characterize a new, ultrafast decomposition\npathway wherein the carbonyl is deeply inserted into the lithium surface and\nbent by about 70$^\\circ$. This reaction, which occurs in a few tens of\npicoseconds, generates a ring-opened intermediate that is a precursor for CO or\nCO$_2$ formation; by contrast, an alternative pathway that yields CO$_3^{2-}$\nand ethylene is found to be non-competitive, occurring on a timescale of tens\nof nanoseconds."}
