However, their luminescent performance is often\nattenuated by pi-pi stacking-driven excimer formation and molecular oxygen\nquenching. To mitigate these undesirable effects, a novel class of\n7-tert-butylpyren-2-ol derivatives with extended 'arm-like' substituents at the\n1,3-positions have been synthesized and their luminescent properties in\nsolution have been thoroughly investigated. While the 2- and 7-positions of the\npyrene core are frequently modified with hydroxyl and tert-butyl groups, this\nwork presents the first introduction of 'arm-like' substituents at the\n1,3-positions. The stretched-out 'arm-like' substituents not only introduce\nsteric bulk to suppress excimer formation but also change the symmetry class of\npyrene and modulate electron density at its 1,2,3,7-positions. These effects\ntune pyrene's energy levels, demonstrating moderate (0.4) to high (0.7)\nfluorescence quantum yields and shorter-lived fluorescence lifetimes ranging\nfrom ca. 20 to 40 ns. These shorter lifetimes lead to a reduction of the pyrene\nderivatives' susceptibility to energy scavenging by molecular oxygen. In\naddition, the specific form of the 'arms' are important. Alkyl-containing arms\nand alkenyl-containing arms exhibit different decay pathways, which is\nreflected by their disparate nonradiative rates. Thus, the introduction of\n'arm-like' modifications represents a promising approach to modulate the\nphotophysical behaviours of annulenes, highlighting their applicability in\nnext-generation electronic and optoelectronic systems."}

The\nrotational speed is estimated by calculating the rate limiting step, the\nthermal helix inversion, as well as the competing backward transition using\nharmonic transition state theory with energy and atomic forces obtained from\ndensity functional theory. First, a methyl group at the stereogenic center is\nreplaced with a tert-butyl (tBu) group and the rotational speed is found to\nincrease due to reduced lifetime of the metastable state. For two of the\nrotors, comparison can be made with experimental measurements and the\ncalculated half-life is in close agreement. Secondly, the effect of\nsubstituting the nine hydrogen atoms in the tBu group with fluorine atoms is\nstudied and this is found to increase the rotational rate further without\nsignificantly altering the molecular structure. The excitation wavelength of\nboth the stable and metastable states is calculated and the separation of the\nabsorption peaks is found to increase by the tBu substitution and even more so\nby the fluorinated tBu substitution, up to 40 nm. These findings can help\ndevelop a strategy for designing molecular motors with a rotational speed that\nbest fits a given application."}

We find that\nbias voltage, molecular length, and spin-orbit coupling (SOC) strongly\ninfluence the spin current dynamics: higher bias enhances spin current but\nreduces polarization, while longer molecules and stronger SOC amplify transient\npolarization. Including electron-phonon coupling modifies current-voltage\ncharacteristics, enhancing spin currents at intermediate bias but suppressing\nthem at high bias, while leaving the polarization dynamics largely unchanged.\nThese findings highlight the interplay between electronic and vibrational\neffects in CISS and provide guidance for designing molecular spintronic\ndevices."}

This formulation has garnered much\nattention for several reasons: opening the door to new approximations, for\navoiding vertex divergences associated with local moment formation plaguing the\ntraditional parquet decomposition, and for its interpretative advantage in its\nbuilt-in diagrammatic identification of bosons without resorting to\nHubbard-Stratonovich transformations.

We explore Laughlin charge pumping in junctions composed\nof a chiral topological superconductor sandwiched between two quantum anomalous\nHall insulators, driven by an adiabatically varying magnetic flux. Here, charge\npumping can be mediated merely by chiral Dirac modes or by the interplay of\nchiral Dirac and chiral Majorana modes (CMMs).

We leverage the manifold hypothesis to assert that microstructural\noutcomes lie on a low-dimensional latent space controlled by only a few\nparameters. Using phase-field simulations of spinodal decomposition as a model\nmaterial system, we compare multiple microstructure descriptors (two-point\nstatistics, chord-length distributions, and persistent homology) in terms of\ntwo criteria: (1) intrinsic dimensionality of the latent space, and (2)\ninvertibility of the processing-to-structure mapping. The results demonstrate\nthat distribution-based descriptors can recover a two-dimensional latent\nstructure aligned with the true processing parameters, yielding an invertible\nand physically interpretable mapping between processing and microstructure. In\ncontrast, descriptors that do not account for microstructure variability either\noverestimate dimensionality or lose predictive fidelity.

A key innovation is treating\nmicrostructure as a stochastic process, defined as a distribution of\nmicrostructural instances rather than a single image, enabling the extraction\nof material state descriptors that capture the essential process-dependent\nfeatures. We leverage the manifold hypothesis to assert that microstructural\noutcomes lie on a low-dimensional latent space controlled by only a few\nparameters. Using phase-field simulations of spinodal decomposition as a model\nmaterial system, we compare multiple microstructure descriptors (two-point\nstatistics, chord-length distributions, and persistent homology) in terms of\ntwo criteria: (1) intrinsic dimensionality of the latent space, and (2)\ninvertibility of the processing-to-structure mapping. The results demonstrate\nthat distribution-based descriptors can recover a two-dimensional latent\nstructure aligned with the true processing parameters, yielding an invertible\nand physically interpretable mapping between processing and microstructure. In\ncontrast, descriptors that do not account for microstructure variability either\noverestimate dimensionality or lose predictive fidelity.
