In these cases, analogues of viscous\nfluid phenomena have been experimentally observed. However, experimental\nstudies of electron hydrodynamics have so far been limited to the low velocity,\nlinear response regime. At velocities approaching the speed of sound, the\nelectronic fluid is expected to exhibit compressible behaviour where nonlinear\neffects and discontinuities such as shocks and choked flow have long been\npredicted. This compressible regime remains unexplored in electronic systems,\ndespite its promise of strongly nonlinear flow phenomena. Here, we demonstrate\ncompressible electron flow in bilayer graphene through an electronic de Laval\nnozzle, a structure that accelerates charge carriers past the electronic speed\nof sound, until they slow down suddenly in a shock. Discontinuities in\ntransport measurements and local flattening of potential in Kelvin probe\nmeasurements are consistent with a viscous electron shock front and the\npresence of supersonic electron flow, and are not consistent with Ohmic or\nballistic flow.

Recently, a moir\\'e superstructure formed by two coexisting charge\ndensity wave (CDW) orders with slightly mismatched wavevectors has been\nrealized. These incommensurate CDWs can collectively exhibit commensurability,\nresulting in the jointly commensurate CDW (JC-CDW). This JC-CDW hosts phenomena\nincluding electronic anisotropy and phase-modulated hysteresis, and holds\npromise for non-volatile optoelectronic memory devices. Realizing such\nfunctionality requires understanding how the spatial periodicity, coherence,\nand amplitude of this order evolve under perturbations. Here, we address these\nquestions using time- and momentum-resolved techniques to probe light-induced\ndynamics in EuTe$_4$. Our time-resolved diffraction results show that under\nintense photoexcitation, the JC-CDW wavevector and coherence length remain\nlocked along the CDW direction, indicating preserved moir\\'e periodicity while\nthe moir\\'e potential depth is suppressed.

Through a combined experimental (uniaxial, center-notched,\npure shear tests) and computational approach, we analyze freestanding HDPE and\nHDPE-SEPS-HDPE trilayer laminates. Finite element simulations reveal that\nfailure in free-standing HDPE is not governed by a maximum stretch criterion.\nInstead, it is driven by ductile damage, modeled using a damage parameter that\ndepends on stress-triaxiality and plastic strain.

Modern\nmolecular ML models typically include state information by adding it to\nmolecular fingerprint vectors or by embedding explicit (semi-empirical)\nthermodynamic relations.

We refer to our approach as\nDeepEOSNet, as this idea is based on the DeepONet architecture [Lu et al.\n(2021), Nat. Mach.

We investigate the\npredictive performance of DeepEOSNet by means of three case studies, which\ninclude the prediction of vapor pressure as a function of temperature, and\nmixture molar volume as a function of composition, temperature, and pressure.\nOur results show superior performance of DeepEOSNet for predicting vapor\npressure and comparable performance for predicting mixture molar volume\ncompared to state-of-research graph-based thermodynamic prediction models from\nour earlier works.

We\ndemonstrate our methodology by combining path integral molecular dynamics and\nMarcus-Hush-Chidsey theory to calculate the rate of electron transfer from a\nFerrocyanide complex to a gold electrode. We consider the dependence of this\nrate on electron transfer distance and applied potential. We find that when the\nelectron is represented explicitly via path integral molecular dynamics, as\nopposed to implicitly via fixed atomic partial charges, the rates and\nthermodynamics are more consistent with experimental findings. We then apply\nour methodology to explore the role of bridging spectator cations in modifying\nelectron transfer rates. We find, once again, that the path integral approach\nproduces specific cation effects that are more consistent with experiment than\nthose in which the transferring electron is represented implicitly."}

In correlated\nelectronic states, observation of size-dependent nucleation and melting is\nrarely reported, likely due to the extremely small length scales necessary to\nobserve such effects for electronic states. Here, using 1T-TiSe$_2$ nanoflakes\nas a prototypical two-dimensional (2D) charge density wave (CDW) system, we\nperform in-situ cryogenic electron microscopy with temperature down to 20 K and\nobserve size-dependent nucleation and melting of CDWs. Specifically, we observe\na melting point depression of CDW for 1T-TiSe$_2$ flakes with lateral sizes\nless than 100 nm. By fitting experimental data to a Ginzburg-Landau model, we\nestimate a zero-temperature correlation length of 10--50 nm, which matches the\nreported CDW domain size for 1T-TiSe$_2$. As the flake size approaches the\ncorrelation length, the divergence of the CDW correlation length near the\ntransition is cut off by the finite flake size, limiting long-range order and\nthereby lowering the transition temperature. For very small flakes whose size\nis close to the correlation length, we also observe absence of CDWs, as\npredicted by the model.

Our experiments show that they fail prematurely\nnot at the point of maximum stretch, but at the boundary of a necked region or\nnotch-tip plastic zone. This study investigates this counter-intuitive failure\nmechanism and demonstrates how an elastomeric interlayer can mitigate it to\nenhance toughness. Through a combined experimental (uniaxial, center-notched,\npure shear tests) and computational approach, we analyze freestanding HDPE and\nHDPE-SEPS-HDPE trilayer laminates. Finite element simulations reveal that\nfailure in free-standing HDPE is not governed by a maximum stretch criterion.\nInstead, it is driven by ductile damage, modeled using a damage parameter that\ndepends on stress-triaxiality and plastic strain. This damage localizes\ninitially at the notch or neck center, but migrates into a \"hotspot\" at the\nneck/plastic zone boundary, matching the observed crack initiation site. The\naddition of a soft SEPS interlayer fundamentally alters this behavior by\nsuppressing the ductile damage, causing the failure mechanism to switch from\nbeing damage-driven at the neck/plastic zone boundary to being stretch-driven\nat the notch tip. This switch enhances flaw tolerance and stretchability by\nrelocating and delaying fracture initiation in both defect-free and notched\ngeometries.

MoS$_2$ can exist in both\nthe semiconducting 1H phase and the metallic 1T phase, enabling\nphase-engineered homojunctions within a single material. First-principles\nelectronic structure and quantum transport calculations show that\nphase-engineered 1T/1H/1T--MoS$_2$ homojunctions exhibit pronounced\nMIM-diode-like rectification originating from interfacial charge transfer at\nasymmetric 1T/1H interfaces. The charge transfer establishes interface dipole\nsteps that impose a built-in potential drop across the 1H barrier, thereby\ngenerating a trapezoidal tunnel barrier at zero bias. In contrast, symmetric\n1T/1H interfaces do not form interface dipoles and show no rectification. To\nclarify the microscopic origin, a lateral\ngraphene/hexagonal-boron-nitride/graphene junction is analyzed as a minimal MIM\ndiode analogue with a simple interface and well-defined barrier, confirming\nthat interface-induced dipoles, rather than work-function difference, enable\nthe effect. The mechanism operates entirely within a single monolayer material\nsystem and does not rely on out-of-plane stacking, highlighting compatibility\nwith phase patterning in 2D semiconductors. These results establish lateral\n1T/1H/1T--MoS$_2$ as a fully 2D, single-material platform for MIM-diode-like\nrectification and position interface-dipole engineering as a general strategy\nfor ultrathin in-plane diodes, high-frequency detectors, and energy-harvesting\ntunnel devices."}
