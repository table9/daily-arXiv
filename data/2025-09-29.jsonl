In this work, we systematically\ninvestigate the effects of non-Hermitian pairing terms on both equilibrium and\nnonequilibrium phenomena in the Kitaev chain. Our analysis focuses on two\nrepresentative forms of pairing imbalance: uniform and staggered. We\ndemonstrate that a uniform imbalance induces only minor perturbations to the\nspectrum and dynamical properties, without significantly affecting its\nequilibrium phase or nonequilibrium steady behavior. In contrast, even a slight\nstaggered imbalance leads to drastic changes. At the symmetry point, it enables\nthe resonant generation of two distinct superconducting states through critical\ndynamics, with the realized state determined by the direction of the bias. Both\nstates exhibit exact off-diagonal long-range order (ODLRO) in the thermodynamic\nlimit. Our results emphasize the fragility of coherent dynamics in\nnon-Hermitian topological systems and elucidate the interplay among\nnon-Hermiticity, topology, and dynamical criticality in quench processes."}

In this\nstudy, the resonator geometry and absorption efficiency were estimated using\nelectromagnetic simulations in CST Microwave Studio for a lumped-element\nmeander structure. Simulations were performed for the 12 to 50 um wavelength\nrange, corresponding to the Infrared Free Electron Laser (IR FEL) at RRCAT,\nIndore. Absorption in the meander inductor was influenced by the substrate\nmaterial, thickness, and impedance matching between the detector and incident\nphoton medium. The results indicate that SiO2 and diamond substrates are\nsuitable for developing lumped-element kinetic inductance detectors (LEKID) in\nthis range. Optimized meander geometries on diamond substrates demonstrated\nabsorption efficiencies of up to 95% for narrow bandwidths and over 50% for\nwide bandwidths. A 30-pixel LEKID structure was fabricated using electron beam\nlithography on a 500 um SiO2 coated Si substrate, with a 20 nm thick Ti40V60\nalloy resonator.

With dipole magnitudes as\nthe primary target and assuming only scalar dipole values are available without\nvector components we examine whether incorporating lower quality labels that do\nnot quantitatively reproduce the target property can still enhance model\naccuracy. Mulliken charges were chosen intentionally as an auxiliary task,\nsince they lack quantitative accuracy yet encode qualitative physical\ninformation about charge distribution. Our results show that including Mulliken\ncharges with a small weight in the loss function yields up to a 30% improvement\nin dipole prediction accuracy. This multitask approach enables the model to\nlearn a more physically grounded representation of charge distributions,\nthereby improving both the accuracy and consistency of dipole magnitude\npredictions.

Systematic errors associated with charged functional groups\n(notably ammonium and carboxylates) were also evident, resulting in\nroot-mean-squared errors (RMSEs) greater than 6.12 kcal/mol across all models.\nAlthough the GB models did not achieve reliable accuracy across all systems,\nthey may be practical when all ligands contain the same functional groups.\nFurthermore, a linear correction based on these functional groups reduced RMSE\nvalues to within 1 kcal/mol of experiment, and our error analysis suggests\nspecific changes for future GB models to improve accuracy. Overall, the Python\nworkflow demonstrates promise for fast, reliable absolute binding free energy\ncalculations by leveraging the sampling efficiency of GB in a fully automated\napplication."}

Motivated by these observations,\nwe consider the fate of the phase transition between (a chiral) Landau Fermi\nliquid (LFL) metal and a Composite Fermi Liquid (CFL) metal in the presence of\nattractive interactions. These are parent states, respectively, for the\nsuperconductor and the fractional quantum Hall states. For weak attractive\ninteractions, the LFL is usually unstable to superconductivity while the CFL is\nstable. This raises the possibility of a direct continuous phase transition\nbetween the chiral superconductor and the CFL. However, we show that\ngenerically the LFL close to the transition to the CFL is stable against\nsuperconductivity. Thus the evolution between the CFL and chiral superconductor\ngoes through an intermediate stable LFL phase for weak attractive interactions.\nWith stronger interactions, the evolution can instead go through a non-Abelian\npaired quantum Hall state."}

The core idea of this letter is, that the essential physics\ndetermining the topological invariants across the phase transition is localized\nnear $N$-fold band-crossing points (BCPs) in the interaction-induced exciton\nband structure. The construction of the continuum theory around these BCPs\nneeds only the information of exciton states that build up these BCPs at both\n$\\mathbf{Q}=0$ and finite $\\mathbf{Q}$ points, and not the numerically\nchallenging solution of the Bethe-Salpeter equation over the full exciton\nBrillouin zone.

Recent experiments have\ndemonstrated SC at the nanometer scale, where strongly confined polaritons,\nrather than photons, couple to quantum emitters or molecular vibrations.\nCoupling with the latter is generally referred to as vibrational SC (VSC) and\nis of significant fundamental and technological interest, as it can be an\neffective tool for modifying molecular properties. However, the implementation\nof VSC, especially at the nanoscale, depends on the development of tuning\nmechanisms that allow control over the coupling strength and, eventually, its\ndirectionality, opening the door for the selective coupling of specific\nmolecular vibrations. Here we report the observation of directional VSC.\nSpecifically, we show nanoscale images of propagating hyperbolic phonon\npolaritons (PhPs) coupled to pentacene molecules revealing that the fingerprint\nof VSC for propagating polaritons -- a marked anti-crossing in their dispersion\nat the vibrational resonance -- can be modulated as a function of the direction\nof propagation.

The isothermal entropy change and the\nadiabatic temperature change are key figures of merit for magnetocaloric\nperformance. Here, we investigate spin systems of realistic molecular\nstructures comprising four spins. In view of possible large spin quantum\nnumbers as for gadolinium we model these spin systems by a combination of\nHeisenberg and dipolar spin-spin interactions. It turns out that a tetrahedral\nstructure with ferromagnetic exchange interactions yields the best figures of\nmerit."}
