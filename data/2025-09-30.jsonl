While intriguing given that metals favor\ncentrosymmetry, these materials also exhibit potential functional properties\nrelevant to memory, optoelectronic, catalytic, and other applications. The\ndistortive polar metal (DPM) subclass forms through a centrosymmetry-lifting\nphase transformation into a polar crystal structure. In the process, domains\nwith uniform geometric polar directions form, oftentimes separated by domain\nboundaries with polarity discontinuities arranged in \"charged\" head-to-head\n(H-H) or tail-to-tail (T-T) morphologies. To date, only metallic oxide DPM\nmicrostructures have been studied. Here we reveal in the intermetallic DPM\nMn5Al8 different chemical reactivity and surface interactions at domain\nboundaries depending on their H-H or T-T character.

This behavior is unintuitive in a metal where electrostatic\nde-polarizing fields should not account for fluctuations in carrier densities.\nThese findings suggest that metallic DPMs may offer functionalizable domain\nboundary behavior and deserve increased attention.

A system unifying these properties has remained\nelusive. Here, we propose and validate a novel platform that harnesses the\nMeissner effect in a topological insulator (TI) nanowire partially covered by a\nsuperconducting (SC) layer. Under an external magnetic field, Meissner\nscreening currents in the SC induce a spatially varying Doppler shift on the TI\nsurface. This effect generates a highly anisotropic effective g-factor, which\nselectively drives a topological phase transition localized on the nanowire's\nbottom surface. This mechanism is crucial as it spatially separates the\ntopological phase from the SC/TI interface, permitting strong proximity-induced\nsuperconductivity while preventing detrimental band renormalization at the\ninterface from closing the topological gap. Furthermore, by confining the\ntopological superconducting phase to the gate-tunable bottom surface, our\nplatform fully leverages the intrinsic disorder resilience of the TI's\ntopologically protected surface states. Through a combination of supercurrent\nsimulations, self-consistent Schr\\\"odinger-Poisson calculations, and\nlarge-scale tight-binding computations, we validate the platform's robustness.\nOur work establishes a practical pathway toward Meissner-mediated topological\nsuperconductivity for realizing robust MZMs in SC/TI hybrid systems."}
