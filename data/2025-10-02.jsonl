In this work, we consider an 8-band minimal model, which\nincludes V, and the two types of Sb, both within and above/below the kagome\nplane. This model captures the Fermi surface pocket with significant in-plane\nSb contribution near the zone center, and also has the two types of van Hove\nsingularities (VHS), one of which has a strong out of plane Sb weight. By\nincluding V-V and V-planar Sb nearest-neighbor Coulomb interactions, we obtain\nthe susceptibilities for fluctuating bond-order and loop-current in both charge\nand spin channels, and examine the resulting superconducting instabilities. In\nparticular, we find that the time-reversal odd (even) charge-loop-current\n(charge bond-order) fluctuations favor unconventional (conventional) pairing\nsymmetry such as $s_{+-}$ and $d+id$ ($s_{++}$).

This perspective, motivated by the\nquestion of when oxides are metallic, employs electronic structure calculations\non metallic oxides to identify the typical feature in the electronic structures\nthat promote metallic behavior.

In this study, we\nreport magneto-absorption measurements on the yellow-exciton series in Cu2O\nusing pulsed magnetic fields of up to 500 T. The strong low energy absorption\nfeatures are assigned to the spin Zeeman split 2p0 and 3p0 exciton states. The\nhigh field data provides a value for the reduced effective mass of the exciton\nu* = 0.415 \\pm 0.01me. Intriguingly, the broadening of the 2p0 ground state\ntransition exhibits a sudden increase for ultrahigh magnetic fields above 300\nT, providing possible evidence for Harper broadening - an indication of the\nbreakdown of the effective mass approximation when the magnetic length becomes\ncomparable to the lattice constant of the crystal."}

Usually as temperature increases, T2 decreases due to the thermal\nbath. Observations of electron-paramagnetic resonance and direct systematic\nmeasurements of T2 has seen an anomaly where T2 increases with increasing\ntemperature. In this work, we investigate the mechanisms that cause the T2\ntemperature anomaly. We find that due to a spontaneous symmetry lowering from a\nmotional Jahn-Teller distortion, a polaron quasi-particle is generated from the\nvibronic coupling. Initially, for temperatures from 8 to 20 - 40K, the\ncoherence temperature dependence is dominated by phonon-assisted spin\nrelaxation. At temperatures around 20 - 40K, depending on the vacancy, a\nthermally activated polaron hopping turns on and motional narrowing dominates\nand increases T2 with increasing temperature. As temperatures reach 120 - 160K,\nthe energy barrier gets high enough to slow the polaron hopping. At this point\nthe Larmor precession dominates, leading to decoherence. Our calculated\ntemperature-dependent coherence agrees with what has been seen experimentally,\ngiving a full theoretical framework for the mechanisms that cause the T2\ntemperature anomaly of increasing T2 with increasing temperature.

Achieving high efficiency under zero magnetic field is a key\nrequirement. The Josephson junction constitutes a versatile SDE platform for\nexploiting quantum materials that exhibit ferromagnetism, topology, or\nunconventional superconductivity. However, a single two-dimensional material\nsystem that inherently offers these properties and allows for precise interface\nengineering, such as twisting, remains elusive. Here we report a record-high,\nfield-free diode efficiency of ~30% in twist van der Waals Josephson\nheterostructures of the sign-change iron-chalcogenide superconductor\nFeTe0.55Se0.45 and the conventional transition-metal dichalcogenide\nsuperconductor 2H-NbSe2. The diode response shows a striking twist-angle\ndependence: the efficiency peaks at crystallographic alignment and collapses\nwith a small misorientation of ~7 deg. Importantly, the twist-angle evolution\nof superconducting interference measurements reveals that efficient\nnonreciprocity arises from asymmetric edge supercurrents, whereas bulk\ntransport suppresses the effect. These findings establish edge states as the\ndriving mechanism of the unconventional SDE, linking it to exotic pairing and\ntopology in multiband iron-based superconductors.

Here,\nwe perform fully ab-initio calculations of the electron excitation spectra in\nTiSe$_2$ with electron-hole excitonic effects included via Bethe-Salpeter\nequations. In the normal high-temperature phase the excitation spectra is\ndominated by the exciton mode at 1.6 eV, while no well-defined soft electronic\nmodes that could support the EI phase are present. In the CDW phase, the\nstructural distortions induce a CDW band-gap opening between Ti-$d$ and Se-$p$\nstates, which supports the formation of the two low-energy excitonic modes in\nthe optical spectrum at 0.4 eV and 80 meV.

The emergence of large\nlanguage model offers new approaches for the reliability prediction of material\nsynthesis processes. However, its development is limited by the lack of\npublicly available datasets of material synthesis processes. To address this,\nwe present the Material Synthesis 2025 (MatSyn25), a large-scale open dataset\nof 2D material synthesis processes. MatSyn25 contains 163,240 pieces of\nsynthesis process information extracted from 85,160 high-quality research\narticles, each including basic material information and detailed synthesis\nprocess steps. Based on MatSyn25, we developed MatSyn AI which specializes in\nmaterial synthesis, and provided an interactive web platform that enables\nmultifaceted exploration of the dataset (https://matsynai.stpaper.cn/).\nMatSyn25 is publicly available, allowing the research community to build upon\nour work and further advance AI-assisted materials science."}

In the device research field, photoelectron\nyield spectroscopy (PYS) has been widely used to evaluate such states, and its\nderivative is commonly employed to estimate the density of states (DOS).\nHowever, low-energy photons in PYS can generate excitons and anions in organic\nsemiconductors, raising questions about whether derivative PYS spectra truly\nrepresent the DOS.

Because the BEE signal\nmasks the DOS, derivative PYS can misestimate the DOS of in-gap states. In\ncontrast, constant final state yield spectroscopy (CFS-YS) can reliably\ndetermine the DOS.

Observations of electron-paramagnetic resonance and direct systematic\nmeasurements of T2 has seen an anomaly where T2 increases with increasing\ntemperature. In this work, we investigate the mechanisms that cause the T2\ntemperature anomaly.

As temperatures reach 120 - 160K,\nthe energy barrier gets high enough to slow the polaron hopping. At this point\nthe Larmor precession dominates, leading to decoherence. Our calculated\ntemperature-dependent coherence agrees with what has been seen experimentally,\ngiving a full theoretical framework for the mechanisms that cause the T2\ntemperature anomaly of increasing T2 with increasing temperature.

Departing from conventional models with\nuncorrelated disorder, we introduce quenched noise fields characterized by a\ntunable Hurst exponent H, allowing systematic control over the spatial\nstructure of the background medium. The interface evolution is governed by a\nquenched Kardar Parisi Zhang equation modified to account for correlated\ndisorder, namely QKPZ. Through analytical scaling analysis, we uncover how the\npresence of long-range correlations reshapes the depinning transition, alters\nthe critical force Fc, and gives rise to a family of critical exponents that\ndepend continuously on H. Our findings reveal a rich interplay between disorder\ncorrelations and the non-linearity term in QKPZ, leading to a breakdown of\nconventional universality and the emergence of nontrivial scaling behaviors.\nThe exponents are found to change by H in the anticorrelation regime, while\nthey are nearly constant in the correlation regime, suggesting a\nsuper-universal behavior for the latter. By a comparison with the quenched\nEdwards Wilkinson model, we study the effect of the non linearity term in the\nQKPZ model. This work provides new insights into the physics of driven systems\nin complex environments and paves the way for understanding transport in\ncorrelated disordered media."}

The QAH phase hosts\nunidirectional transport channels known as chiral edge states, while the\nmetallic phase exhibits non-reciprocal transport due to unbalanced\nbidirectional edge states. Utilizing the chiral edge states in Cr-doped (Bi,\nSb)2Te3 sandwich structures, we realize non-Hermitian conductance matrices in a\none-dimensional Corbino chain with well-defined chirality. By tuning the\nboundary conditions from open to periodic, we reveal the non-Hermitian skin\neffect, where eigenstates localize exponentially at one end of the chain. In\nthe metallic phase, we further observe asymmetric, bidirectional coupling\nbetween the neighboring sites in the conductance matrix, a direct consequence\nof the system's intrinsic non-reciprocity.

Among the multitudinous applications of QD solids, there has\nbeen great success in exploiting the tunable optical properties for LED\ndisplays, lighting, bioimaging and diagnostics. Applications dependent on\nelectrical properties such as solar cells, photodetectors, and transistors have\nfallen short of their full potential because of poor control over electrical\nproperties, and some of applications with the most promise for novelty, such as\na solid-state quantum simulator for quantum computation and spintronics, are\nstagnant. Lack of clarity on the charge transport mechanism has been a\nsignificant barrier to progress, particularly as numerous sources of disorder\nare present. In this work, we make advancements in a nano-patterning technique\nto fabricate a 70-nm wide QD solid that is also free of several sources of\nstructural defects. Owing to the small size and structural integrity, we\nisolate the charge dynamics of a single conductance channel within a\npercolation network. We tune parameters to measure ~10 channels, and with a\ntime-resolved measurement, we find conductance noise that exceeds 100% of the\naverage current. From observation of the long-time dynamics of the charge\ntransport, including random telegraph noise, colored noise and attractor\nstates, we model the transport with stochastic quasi-one-dimensional\npercolation paths. With this insight into the charge transport of QD solids\nunimpeded by structural defects, we provide a path for the rational design of a\nQD solid with electrical properties that reflect the underlying tunable,\nperiodic potential."}
