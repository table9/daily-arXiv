Here, we investigate how slow lattice vibrations\n(phonons) influence both the intrinsic and externally induced spin\npolarizations in two-dimensional $d$-wave altermagnets. For the induced spin\npolarizations, we employ a Rashba continuum model with electron-phonon coupling\n(EPC) treated at the static-Holstein level and analyze the spin Edelstein\neffect using the Kubo linear-response formalism. We find that\nmoderate-to-strong EPC progressively suppresses the induced polarization via\nboth intraband and interband channels, with a critical coupling marking the\nonset of complete spin Edelstein depolarization. The depolarization transition\narises from a phonon-induced energy renormalization that pushes the spin-split\nbands anisotropically above the chemical potential, leading to a complete\ncollapse of the Fermi surface. While (de)polarization can occur even in the\nRashba non-altermagnetic phase, it remains isotropic.

In addition to the practical challenges posed by\nworking in a high pressure environment, typical samples exhibit anomalously\nweak diamagnetic responses, which have been conjectured to reflect\ninhomogeneous `filamentary' superconducting states. We perform wide-field,\nhigh-pressure, optically detected magnetic resonance spectroscopy to image the\nlocal diamagnetic responses of as grown La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ samples \\emph{in\nsitu}, using nitrogen vacancy quantum sensors embedded in the diamond anvil\ncell. These maps confirm significant inhomogeneity of the functional\nsuperconducting responses at the few micron scale. By spatially correlating the\ndiamagnetic Meissner response with both the local tensorial stress environment,\nalso imaged \\emph{in situ}, and stoichiometric composition, we unravel the\ndominant mechanisms suppressing and enhancing superconductivity. Our wide-field\ntechnique simultaneously provides a broad view of sample behavior and excellent\nlocal sensitivity, enabling the rapid construction of multi-parameter phase\ndiagrams from the local structure-function correlations observed at the\nsub-micron pixel scale."}

These exotic phases, marked by the\nabsence of magnetic ordering even at zero temperature, support fractionalized\nexcitations and emergent gauge fields. A particularly compelling feature of the\nKitaev model is its exact solvability, which reveals low-energy excitations in\nthe form of itinerant Majorana fermions-quasiparticles that obey non-Abelian\nstatistics and are of central interest in topological quantum computation due\nto their inherent robustness against local perturbations and decoherence.\nDespite extensive theoretical advancements, the experimental identification of\nQSLs remains challenging, as conventional magnetic probes fail to detect their\ndefining properties. In this work, we present a theoretical investigation of\nspin current injection from a superconducting metal into a Kitaev quantum spin\nliquid. By employing a spintronic framework, we derive the dynamics of the\ninjected spin current and demonstrate how its signatures can be traced back to\nthe underlying Majorana excitations in the spin liquid phase. Superconductivity\nplays a pivotal role in this context, not only as a source of coherent\nquasiparticles but also as a platform with potential for interfacing with\ntopological quantum devices. Our analysis contrasts the Kitaev-superconductor\ninterface with conventional ferromagnetic junctions, where spin transport is\ncarried by magnons, and highlights distinctive features in the spin current\nresponse.

Here, we investigate how slow lattice vibrations\n(phonons) influence both the intrinsic and externally induced spin\npolarizations in two-dimensional $d$-wave altermagnets. For the induced spin\npolarizations, we employ a Rashba continuum model with electron-phonon coupling\n(EPC) treated at the static-Holstein level and analyze the spin Edelstein\neffect using the Kubo linear-response formalism. We find that\nmoderate-to-strong EPC progressively suppresses the induced polarization via\nboth intraband and interband channels, with a critical coupling marking the\nonset of complete spin Edelstein depolarization. The depolarization transition\narises from a phonon-induced energy renormalization that pushes the spin-split\nbands anisotropically above the chemical potential, leading to a complete\ncollapse of the Fermi surface. While (de)polarization can occur even in the\nRashba non-altermagnetic phase, it remains isotropic. The presence of\naltermagnetism makes it anisotropic and breaks the conventional antisymmetry\nbetween spin susceptibilities that occurs with pure spin-orbit coupling,\nrendering the effect highly relevant for spintronic applications. We further\ninvestigate how the phonon coupling to the altermagnetic order, Rashba\nspin-orbit strength, and carrier doping collectively tune the depolarization\ntransition.

However, this relationship has often been oversimplified, leading to\nconceptual misunderstandings, particularly when attempts are made to directly\ncorrelate structural handedness with optical rotatory power. In reality, the\nrelationship between chirality and NOA is more nuanced: optical activity can\narise in both chiral and achiral crystal structures, and the sign of the\nrotation cannot necessarily be inferred from the handedness of the space group.\n% In this work, we conduct a first-principles investigation of natural optical\nactivity in SiO$_2$ and AlPO$_4$ crystals, focusing on their enantiomorphic\nstructural phase transition from high-symmetry hexagonal ($P6_422$ or $P6_222$)\nto low-symmetry trigonal ($P3_121$ or $P3_221$) space groups.

Here, we demonstrate that\npolycrystalline multialkali Na$_{2}$KSb(Cs,Sb) photocathodes with negative\neffective electron affinity (NEA) have MTE values at room temperature by a\nfactor of 2 lower than those of monocrystalline \\textit{p}-GaAs(Cs,O)\nphotocathodes. These low MTE values are due to the electron refraction on the\njump in mass, between a small effective mass in Na$_{2}$KSb and free electron\nmass in vacuum. It is proved that, at the NEA state, up to half of\nphotoelectrons are emitted in a narrow-angle cone with the fractional MTE of\n9\\,meV at room temperature. We also showed that the transition from NEA to\npositive effective affinity results in the subthermal total MTE of the\nNa$_{2}$KSb(Cs,Sb) photocathode, along with quantum efficiency of about\n10$^{-2}$. The physical reasons for the manifestation of the refraction effect\nin multialkali photocathodes are discussed, opening up opportunities for the\ndevelopment of high-brightness and ultracold robust electron sources."}
