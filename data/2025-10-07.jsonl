Previous studies have proposed an effective d$_{x^2-y^2}$-orbital\nbilayer $t-J_{\\parallel}-J_{\\perp}$ model, in which the electrons of the\nd$_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital are charge carriers, which are subject to the intralayer\nantiferromagnetic (AFM) superexchange $J_{\\parallel}$ and the large interlayer\nAFM superexchange $J_{\\perp}\\approx 2J_{\\parallel}$, with the latter\ntransferred from the nearly half-filled and hence localized $d_{z^2}$ orbital\nthrough the strong Hund's rule coupling. Here we study this model by the\nvariational Monte Carlo (VMC) simulation and find a dominant interlayer s-wave\npairing, in which the SC order parameters have a drastic improvement compared\nwith those of the mean field (MF) type of theories. In real materials, the\nHund's coupling is finite, leading to reduced $J_{\\perp}$, dictating that the\nMF-type theories have difficulty explaining the HTSC. However, our VMC\ncalculations find that even for effective $J_{\\perp}$ as weak as\n$J_{\\perp}=J_{\\parallel}$, the interlayer pairing is still considerably large\nand can be compared with the $T_c$ observed in experiments, which is very weak\nin MF-type theories. This result indicates the important role of the Gutzwiller\nprojection in improving the $T_c$, which is ignored in the MF-type theories. In\naddition, our results show that suppressed interlayer hopping can promote\ninterlayer pairing, which is consistent with the fact that the interlayer\nhopping of the d$_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is very weak.

Recent advances in statistical\nphysics -- particularly in stochastic thermodynamics -- enable precise\ncharacterizations of work, heat, and entropy production in\ninformation-processing systems driven far from equilibrium by time-dependent\ncontrol protocols. A key open question is then how to design protocols that\nminimize thermodynamic cost while ensur- ing correct outcomes. To this end, we\ndevelop a unified framework to identify optimal protocols using fluctuation\nresponse relations (FRR) and machine learning. Unlike previous approaches that\noptimize either distributions or protocols separately, our method unifies both\nusing FRR-derived gradients. Moreover, our method is based primarily on\niteratively learning from sampled noisy trajectories, which is generally much\neasier than solving for the optimal protocol directly from a set of governing\nequations. We apply the framework to canonical examples -- bit erasure in a\ndouble-well potential and translating harmonic traps -- demonstrating how to\nconstruct loss functions that trade-off energy cost against task error. The\nframework extends trivially to underdamped systems, and we show this by\noptimizing a bit-flip in an underdamped system. In all computations we test,\nthe framework achieves the theoretically optimal protocol or achieves work\ncosts comparable to relevant finite time bounds.

In transition-metal and rare-earth magnetic\ncompounds, the configuration of the ligands around each magnetic center and the\nconnectivity of the ligand cages are therefore pivotal -- for example, the\nmutual interaction of magnetic species connected through one single ligand is\nqualitatively different from the case of two bridging anions. Two bridging\nligands are encountered in Kitaev magnets. The latter represent one of the\nrevelations of the 21st century in magnetism research: they feature highly\nanisotropic intersite couplings with seemingly counterintuitive directional\ndependence for adjacent pairs of magnetic sites and unique quantum spin-liquid\nground states that can be described analytically. Current scenarios for the\noccurrence of pair-dependent magnetic interactions as proposed by Kitaev rely\non $indirect$ exchange mechanisms based on intersite electron hopping.\nAnalyzing the wavefunctions of Kitaev magnetic bonds at both single- and\nmulti-configuration levels, we find however that $direct$, Coulomb exchange may\nbe at least as important, in 5$d$ and 4$d$ $t_{2g}^5$, 3$d$ $t_{2g}^5e_g^2$,\nand even rare-earth 4$f^1$ Kitaev-Heisenberg magnets.

While initial studies have successfully\napplied LLMs to tasks involving pure crystal generation or coordinate\nunderstandings, a standardized benchmark to systematically evaluate their core\nreasoning abilities across diverse atomic structures has been notably absent.\nTo address this gap, we introduce the AtomWorld benchmark to evaluate LLMs on\ntasks based in Crystallographic Information Files (CIFs), a standard structure\nrepresentation format. These tasks, including structural editing, CIF\nperception, and property-guided modeling, reveal a critical limitation: current\nmodels, despite establishing promising baselines, consistently fail in\nstructural understanding and spatial reasoning. Our experiments show that these\nmodels make frequent errors on structure modification tasks, and even in the\nbasic CIF format understandings, potentially leading to cumulative errors in\nsubsequent analysis and materials insights.

Recent advances in statistical\nphysics -- particularly in stochastic thermodynamics -- enable precise\ncharacterizations of work, heat, and entropy production in\ninformation-processing systems driven far from equilibrium by time-dependent\ncontrol protocols. A key open question is then how to design protocols that\nminimize thermodynamic cost while ensur- ing correct outcomes. To this end, we\ndevelop a unified framework to identify optimal protocols using fluctuation\nresponse relations (FRR) and machine learning. Unlike previous approaches that\noptimize either distributions or protocols separately, our method unifies both\nusing FRR-derived gradients. Moreover, our method is based primarily on\niteratively learning from sampled noisy trajectories, which is generally much\neasier than solving for the optimal protocol directly from a set of governing\nequations. We apply the framework to canonical examples -- bit erasure in a\ndouble-well potential and translating harmonic traps -- demonstrating how to\nconstruct loss functions that trade-off energy cost against task error. The\nframework extends trivially to underdamped systems, and we show this by\noptimizing a bit-flip in an underdamped system. In all computations we test,\nthe framework achieves the theoretically optimal protocol or achieves work\ncosts comparable to relevant finite time bounds. In short, the results provide\nprincipled strategies for designing thermodynamically efficient protocols in\nphysical information-processing systems.

Of particular interest\nis whether the 1/2 FQHS in this system has a one-component (1C) or\ntwo-component (2C) origin; these are typically identified as the Pfaffian\n(non-Abelian) or the $\\Psi_{331}$ (Abelian) FQHSs, respectively. We report here\nour experimental study of the evolution of the correlated states of an\nultrahigh-quality 2DES confined to a 72.5-nm-wide GaAs quantum well. At the\nlowest densities, the 2DES displays only odd-denominator FQHSs, and the ground\nstate at $\\nu = 1/2$ is a composite fermion Fermi sea. As the density is\nincreased, a FQHS emerges at $\\nu = 1/2$, and becomes very strong. In a finite\ndensity range where the 1/2 FQHS is strongest, we also observe its daughter\nFQHSs at $\\nu = 8/17$ and 7/13, consistent with the theoretically expected\ndaughter states of a Pfaffian 1/2 FQHS. At the highest densities, the 2DES\nbecomes 2C, signaled by the emergence of a bilayer Wigner crystal state and the\ntransitions of FQHSs flanking $\\nu=1/2$. The 1/2 FQHS remains robust near this\ntransition and, notably, its charge transport energy gap exhibits an\n\\textit{upward} cusp with a maximum value of about 6 K on the 1C side of the\ntransition; this is the largest gap reported for any even-denominator FQHS. Our\nobservation of the transition of the 2DES ground states near $\\nu=1/2$ to 2C\nstates at high densities, and our measurements of the robustness of the 1/2\nFQHS against charge distribution asymmetry, suggest that the 1/2 FQHS also\nmakes a transition from 1C to 2C.

This makes the model self-consistent, as it\nincorporates a form of particle interactions, mediated by the environment, that\ndrives the system toward some kind of stationary state. Although indirect and\nlong-range interactions do not necessarily promote thermodynamic states,\ninteractions are necessary for energy to be shared among the elementary\nconstituents of matter, enabling the establishment of equipartition, which is a\nprerequisite for defining temperature.

These interactions preserve\nintegrability while opening controllable gaps at resonant quasienergies and\npinning the emergent quasienergy modes that are responsible for subharmonics.\nWe demonstrate that the DTC phase is rigid in the parameter space of transverse\nfield and an additional interaction like NNN coupling strength, with the drive\nfrequency optimized to produce the strongest subharmonic response. We also\nprovide a detailed phase portrait of the model, exhibiting a variety of new\ndynamical phases, such as a fragile time crystal and both spin-liquid and\nparamagnetic phases, as well as sharp quantum phase transitions between them.\nFinite-size scaling of the Floquet quasienergy splitting between the emergent\nsubharmonic mode and its conjugate shows that the DTC lifetime diverges\nexponentially with system size. Our work thus establishes a novel mechanism for\nrealizing robust, long-lived DTCs in one dimension, and paves the way for their\nexperimental realization in near-term quantum simulators. Motivation for this\nwork stems from the limitations of disorder-based stabilization schemes that\nrely on many-body localization and exhibit only prethermal or finite-lived\nplateaus, eventually restoring ergodicity. Disorder-free routes are therefore\nhighly desirable. Integrable (or Floquet-integrable) systems provide an\nattractive alternative because their extensive set of conserved quantities and\nconstrained scattering strongly restrict thermalization channels. Our\nconstruction exploits these integrable restrictions together with short-range\nNNN engineering to produce a clean, robust DTC that avoids the prethermal\nfragility of disordered realizations."}

Here, we present a comprehensive first-principles study of more than\n60 MA$_2$Z$_4$ monolayers, encompassing semiconducting, metallic,\ncold-metallic, magnetic, and topological phases. Using the constrained random\nphase approximation (cRPA), we compute material-specific effective Coulomb\ninteraction parameters $U$, $U'$, and $J$, including their spatial dependence\nacross distinct correlated subspaces defined by local coordination and crystal\nsymmetry. In semiconducting compounds, long-range nonlocal interactions\npersist, revealing unconventional screening and suggesting strong excitonic\neffects beyond simple dielectric models. In cold-metallic systems, sizable\nlong-range Coulomb interactions remain despite the presence of free carriers,\nhighlighting their atypical metallic screening. Among 33-valence-electron\ncompounds, we find $U_{\\mathrm{eff}} > W$ in the $\\beta_2$ phase, indicating\nproximity to charge-density-wave or Mott instabilities. Several V- and Nb-based\nsystems exhibit intermediate-to-strong correlation strength, with $U/W > 1 $ in\nmultiple cases.
