However,\nnon-invasive probing of light-induced surface potential dynamics at these\ninterfaces remains challenging due to limited surface sensitivity. Here, we\nintroduce a nanophotonic approach that amplifies second harmonic generation\n(SHG) from nanostructured solid-liquid interfaces by over two orders of\nmagnitude, providing real-time, all-optical access to light-driven interfacial\nphenomena. Using in-situ SHG at silicon-oxide-electrolyte interfaces, we\nuncover two concurrent pathways for light-mediated modulation: (i)\nlow-intensity illumination induces photocharging via carrier generation and\ntrapping, while (ii) high-intensity excitation leads to photothermal heating\nthat modifies surface group dissociation through temperature-dependent reaction\nequilibria. We further show that nanostructured semiconductor interfaces\ndeviate markedly from the monotonic electrolyte-concentration dependence\npredicted by Gouy-Chapman theory. Instead, the surface potential exhibits a\npronounced non-monotonic behavior governed by interfacial geometry, consistent\nwith prior device-level observations. Importantly, SHG measurements reveal that\nthis concentration-dependent modulation of surface potential directly alters\nthe electronic polarizability of silicon, exposing the underlying\nion-electronic coupling at the solid-liquid boundary.

Here, we employ direct coexistence molecular dynamics\nsimulations and free energy calculations to elucidate how glycine-a prevalent\nsynthesis byproduct-modulates glyphosate solubility and crystal growth in\naqueous solutions.

In the second part of the article, we examine\nsuperconducting phenomena that stem from this shared mechanism, focusing on\nsuperconductivity in systems with spin-momentum locked Fermi surfaces. We\nhighlight a rich variety of unconventional superconducting states, including\nfinite-momentum pairing, $d$-wave and spin-triplet superconductivity, and\ntopological Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces, among others. Additional related topics\nare addressed in the concluding section. Overall, this work offers both an\naccessible introduction to the newly identified magnetic order known as\naltermagnetism and a conceptual guide for researchers aiming to harness the\nensuing unconventional superconductivity in the development of future quantum\ntechnologies."}

It is assumed to be a proton-blocking\ncatalyst with only surface-limited adsorption of the reaction intermediates.\nHere, we critically evaluate the bulk interaction of Pt with hydrogen (H), and\nits heavier isotope deuterium (D), by monitoring operando mass change of the Pt\nelectrode during galvanostatic heavy/water splitting by employing an\nelectrochemical quartz crystal microbalance. Unexpectedly, we observe an\nirreversible temporal mass gain and a change in the reaction's overpotential,\narising from diffusion of H/D into Pt, confirmed by atom probe tomography and\nthermal desorption spectroscopy. Sub-surface concentration of at least ca. 15\nat. % of D in Pt was observed, diffusing down to a depth of more than 10 nm.\nAnalytical description quantified the diffusion coefficient of D in Pt to be\n3.2X10^-18 cm2Xs-1. These findings challenge the existing credence of Pt-proton\ninteraction being limited to the surface, prompting the expansion of the\ncatalyst design strategies to account for property-modifying bulk diffusion of\nH/D in the Pt matrix"}

In particular, the absorption of circularly-polarized light in\nbulk Ge generates a spin-oriented population of electrons in the conduction\nband with a spin-polarization up to 50%, whereas the hole spin-polarization,\nopposite to the electron one, can even reach values up to 83%. In this letter,\nwe theoretically investigate the optical injection of orbital polarization by\nmeans of circularly-polarized light in bulk Ge and we show that the latter\nconsiderably exceeds 100% for holes and photon energies close to the direct Ge\ngap. These results suggest that Ge is a convenient platform for future\ndevelopment of orbitronics and opto-orbitronic devices."}

Although platinum\nserves as the benchmark catalyst, its scarcity and high cost hinder large-scale\ndeployment. In this study, we propose a newly predicted SnSiGeN4 MXene-family\nmonolayer as a promising candidate for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER),\noxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Using\nfirst-principles calculations, we systematically investigated its electronic,\nvibrational, and optical properties across multiple exchange-correlation\nfunctionals, including hybrid approaches, revealing a wide and tunable band\ngap. Simulated infrared and Raman spectra further confirm the dynamical\nstability and the presence of catalytically active sites. Guided by these\nfindings, we studied photocatalytic reaction analyses that demonstrate that the\ncomputed overpotentials for OER, ORR, and HER are comparable to those of\nPt-based catalysts and outperform Ir-based systems, positioning SnSiGeN4 as a\nsustainable, high-performance platform for next-generation\nUV-visible-light-driven photocatalysis."}

Understanding this process at the molecular scale\nis critical for optimizing production, ensuring product quality, and assessing\nenvironmental impact. Here, we employ direct coexistence molecular dynamics\nsimulations and free energy calculations to elucidate how glycine-a prevalent\nsynthesis byproduct-modulates glyphosate solubility and crystal growth in\naqueous solutions. Our simulations identify two major mechanisms by which\nglycine hinders crystallization. First, direct coexistence simulations show\nthat glycine preferentially adsorbs at crystal surfaces, hindering glyphosate\nattachment and slowing growth. Second, free energy calculations demonstrate\nthat glycine enhances glyphosate solubility, reducing the supersaturation\ndriving force to incorporate into the crystal phase. Experimental measurements\ncorroborate our predictions, confirming both enhanced solubility and reduced\ncrystallization kinetics in glycine-bearing systems. These findings establish\nthat glycine-typically considered an inert impurity-actively disrupts\nglyphosate crystallization by promoting its dissolution. More broadly, this\nintegrated computational-experimental approach highlights the power of\nmolecular simulations to disentangle impurity effects, interfacial phenomena,\nand solution thermodynamics in crystallization, providing molecular-level\ninsights for optimizing industrial protocols and predicting agrochemical\nbehavior under relevant environmental conditions."}
