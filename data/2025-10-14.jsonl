Structural-property\nrelationships reveal that high charge density and bridging capability of N3-\nenhance network disorder, shorten metal coordinating atom distances, and\noptimize Li+ diffusion pathway connectivity. ASSBs employing 0.533Li3N-HfCl4\nretain 81.87% capacity after 2000 cycles at 1000 mA g-1 with high cathode\nloading (6.24 mg cm-2), demonstrating engineering viability. This work provides\na paradigm for rational design of high-performance amorphous SSEs."}

The set-ups are simple enough to enable effective modeling, however,\novercoming the grand failures of the theoretical efforts, thus far, and\nformulating a theory which is founded on microscopic modeling appears to be a\nchallenge.

Both probes show a\nchirality reversal at a critical hc ~ 0.9--1. Motivated by this consistency we\npropose a defect-scale toy model whose low energy states reverse their\nchirality at hc' ~ 0.87. Remarkably, the same pair of zero energy bound states\nalso generate the critical point hc in the full impurity projected T-matrix.\nOur results show how the chirality reversal produced by an impurity can be\nobserved either in local probes or in the global topology and suggest a\npossible role of the microscopic defect structure at the critical point."}

Bead-Fourier RPMD", "comment": null, "summary": "Feynman path integrals (PIs) have found many uses in approximate quantum\ndynamics methods that are able to efficiently calculate real-time quantum\ncorrelation functions. The PIs typically take the form of discrete imaginary\ntime slices over a closed path, where the slices form the ``beads'' of a ring\npolymer (RP) necklace. Some methods, such as centroid molecular dynamics (CMD),\nuse the RP to generate an effective potential for the dynamics, while others,\nlike RP molecular dynamics (RPMD), directly utilize the RP in real-time\ndynamics in order to incorporate quantum effects. The standard, discretized\nbead forms of CMD and RPMD can require a large number of RP beads to provide\naccurate results for systems where quantum effects are strong, such as at low\ntemperatures. In Paper I, we introduced the bead-Fourier (BF) CMD method, where\nwe utilized the inclusion of a Fourier sine series to reduce the number of\nbeads needed to converge the CMD effective potential up to eightfold. In this\nwork, we extend RPMD to incorporate BF-PIs in the form of BF-RPMD. We study a\nnumber of different implementations of the method through the calculation of\ncorrelation functions for both linear and non-linear operators. The\neffectiveness of the BF-RPMD method is sensitive to both the system and form of\nthe operators being studied, but we show that this method is able to produce\nresults on par with standard RPMD, with at worst twofold and up to eightfold\nreduction in the number of beads by including two to three Fourier components."}

Quantum computation has the potential to offer advantages\nin memory footprint and computational scaling. However, general and practical\nquantum algorithms for simulating large-scale materials are still lacking. We\npropose and implement random-state quantum algorithms to calculate\nelectronic-structure properties of real materials. Using a random state circuit\nwith only a few qubits, we employ real-time evolution with first-order Trotter\ndecomposition and Hadamard test to obtain electronic density of states, and we\ndevelop a modified quantum phase estimation algorithm to calculate real-space\nlocal density of states via direct quantum measurements. Furthermore, we\nvalidate these algorithms by numerically computing the density of states and\nspatial distributions of electronic states in graphene, twisted bilayer\ngraphene quasicrystals, and fractal lattices, covering system sizes from\nhundreds to thousands of atoms. Our results manifest that the random-state\nquantum algorithms provide a general and qubit-efficient route to simulating\nelectronic properties of large-scale periodic and aperiodic materials on\nquantum computers."}

At the\nmolecular origin of life, such machinery was absent, implying the need for\nsimple yet robust physical mechanisms to harvest energy from the environment\nand perform chemical work or produce chemical power. However, the mechanisms\ninvolved in harvesting energy from a macroscopic cyclic environment to drive\nchemical processes on the molecular scale remain elusive. In this work, we\npropose a theory that describes the kinetics of chemical reactions in a system\nsubject to a cyclic reservoir with varying properties. We compare cycles of\nsolvent (wet-dry cycles), with cycles of a component participating in a\nchemical reaction (reactant cycle). We find that for both wet-dry and reactant\ncycles, resonance frequencies exist at which the chemical power is maximal. We\nidentify which cycle type is more beneficial in harvesting chemical power for\ndifferent molecular interactions. Our findings of harvest efficiencies around\nten percent suggest that the cyclic environment could have played a key role in\ncatalyzing the metabolic molecular machinery at the molecular origin of life."}

Many parallelisation schemes with varying degrees of complexity have\nbeen proposed to accelerate such sampling simulations. In this study, several\nwidely used schemes are benchmarked - both in isolation and in combination - to\nestablish best practice. The schemes studied include energy domain\ndecomposition with both static sizing of energy sub-domains, as well as a\ndynamic sub-domain sizing scheme which we propose. We also assess the benefits\nboth of replica exchange and of including multiple random walkers per\nsub-domain, to determine which factors have the largest impact on parallel\nefficiency. Additionally, the influence of the choice of size of energy\nsub-domain overlap regions is discussed. As an illustrative test case, we\nimplement and apply the aforementioned strategies to a lattice-based model\ndescribing the internal energies of the AlTiCrMo refractory high-entropy\nsuperalloy, which is understood to crystallographically order into a B2 (CsCl)\nstructure with decreasing temperature. We find that - while all of the proposed\nstrategies confer a non-negligible speedup - parallelisation across energy\ndomains which are non-uniform in size offers the most appreciable performance\nimprovements.
