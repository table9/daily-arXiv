NQR and NMR spectral measurements at the two non-equivalent Ge\nsites reveal electric field gradient tensors and the directions of their\nprincipal axes relative to the hexagonal basal plane. The spin-lattice\nrelaxation rate $1/T_1$ experiments reveal a clear critical slowing down\napproaching the ferromagnetic transition. $1/T_1$ in the paramagnetic state is\nfound to be predominantly caused by fluctuating 4$f$-local moments. The Knight\nshift shows Curie-Weiss behavior at high temperature and a deviation from this\nbelow $T^\\ast$ $\\approx$ 25 K possibly due to a mixture of crystalline electric\nfield effects and Kondo screening. Order-parameter-like behavior of hyperfine\nfields at the Ge sites and ferromagnetic signal enhancement are observed in\nZeeman-perturbed NQR, with uniform ferromagnetic order and a small ordered\nmoment of $\\approx$ 0.26 $\\mu_B$/Ce confined within the $ab$-plane. The ordered\nmoment shows a notable in-plane magnetic stiffness against out-of-plane\nradiofrequency fields and has an (XY-type) in-plane isotropic nature.

Progress in this topic\nhas been limited by a lack of single-defect-resolved experimental measurements\nas well as accurate theoretical tools to enable realistic experiment-theory\ncomparison. Here we overcome these limitations by combining atomically-resolved\nscanning tunneling microscopy (STM) with quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulation\nof disordered 2D electron WSs. STM was used to image the electron density\n($n_e$) dependent evolution of electron WSs in gate-tunable bilayer MoSe$_2$\ndevices with varying long-range ($n_\\mathrm{LR}$) and short-range\n($n_\\mathrm{SR}$) disorder densities. These images were compared to QMC\nsimulations using realistic disorder maps extracted from experiment, thus\nallowing the roles of different disorder types to be disentangled. We identify\ntwo distinct physical regimes for disordered electron WSs that depend on the\nmagnitude of $n_\\mathrm{SR}$. For $n_\\mathrm{SR} \\lesssim n_e$ the WS behavior\nis dominated by long-range disorder and features extensive mixed solid-liquid\nphases, a new type of re-entrant melting-crystallization, and prominent Friedel\noscillations.

The prevailing understanding is\nthat the enhanced thermal resistance (TR) observed in NHs originates from long\nmean free path (MFP) phonons, whose MFPs are much larger than the hotspot size,\nthereby limiting their ability to recognize hotspots and transport heat\neffectively. In this study, we revisit this problem by employing the Boltzmann\ntransport equation (BTE) with a full phonon dispersion model (FPDM) to capture\nmode-resolved velocities, scattering processes, and nonequilibrium phonon\npopulations in silicon. The analysis demonstrates that the increase in TR near\nNHs is not caused by the long MFP itself but by the low specific heat of\nlong-MFP phonons that do not scatter directly with optical modes. These phonons\nheat readily when energy is supplied, steepening the local temperature gradient\nnear the NH and thereby enhancing TR.

In this work, we use\nnonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations and stochastic thermodynamics to\ninvestigate energy transport in a well-studied nanoscale system, a molecular\njunction, subjected to a time-periodic temperature gradient. The primary\nobservation is that molecular junctions can exhibit heat transport hysteresis,\na phenomenon in which the heat flux through a system depends not only on the\ninstantaneous value of a time-dependent temperature bias but also on the\ntemporal history of that bias. The presented findings illustrate that molecular\njunctions can exhibit the specific memory effect, heat transport hysteresis,\nthat is essential for the design of thermal neuromorphic computers. This work\nelucidates a potential pathway toward the realization of such devices."}

The prevailing understanding is\nthat the enhanced thermal resistance (TR) observed in NHs originates from long\nmean free path (MFP) phonons, whose MFPs are much larger than the hotspot size,\nthereby limiting their ability to recognize hotspots and transport heat\neffectively. In this study, we revisit this problem by employing the Boltzmann\ntransport equation (BTE) with a full phonon dispersion model (FPDM) to capture\nmode-resolved velocities, scattering processes, and nonequilibrium phonon\npopulations in silicon. The analysis demonstrates that the increase in TR near\nNHs is not caused by the long MFP itself but by the low specific heat of\nlong-MFP phonons that do not scatter directly with optical modes. These phonons\nheat readily when energy is supplied, steepening the local temperature gradient\nnear the NH and thereby enhancing TR.

Superconducting infinite-layer nickelates provide a\nnew arena to test this paradigm but are constrained to thin films, precluding\ncalorimetry. We use the Seebeck coefficient as a low-temperature proxy for\nentropy per carrier and uncover a clear quantum-critical thermodynamic\nsignature: in La$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_2$ at the onset of $T$-linear resistivity\n($x=0.20$), $S/T$ diverges logarithmically upon cooling, $S/T \\propto \\log T$.\nBoltzmann transport based on ARPES-derived band structure reproduces the\nhigh-temperature magnitude and sign of $S/T$ and reveals a threefold mass\nrenormalization at the Fermi level. To identify the terminating phase, we\nanalyze Hall data across Nd$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_2$ and show that its temperature\nevolution is quantitatively captured by a minimal two-band model in which a\nstrongly correlated Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ Fermi surface exhibits Planckian\n$T$-linear scattering while the rare-earth Nd-$s$ pocket remains\nFermi-liquid-like. Inverting the zero-temperature Hall response reveals a\ncollapse of the Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ band carrier density from $1+p$ to $p$ holes\nacross the critical doping, without long-range magnetic order -- mirroring the\ncuprate pseudogap transition in cuprates. These results establish a quantum\ncritical point at the end of a pseudogap-like phase in infinite-layer\nnickelates and unify the broader paradigm among correlated superconductors that\nstrange metal behaviour is intimately linked to quantum criticality."}
