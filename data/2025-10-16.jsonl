We find that periodic buckling in large-angle TBG\ninitially enhances band flattening compared to monolayer graphene, but for\nsufficiently strong buckling, it instead increases the band dispersion. This\noccurs both because of the presence of interlayer coupling, which reduces the\nin-plane kinetic energy, and due to the opening of a gap at the Dirac point\nresulting from inversion-symmetry breaking. Additionally, we find that\nbuckling-induced band flattening competes with twist-induced band flattening.\nWhile the former breaks sublattice symmetry, generating a sublattice\npolarization, the latter prefers to preserve it.

In this work, we demonstrate a two-step pathway for enantiomer\nselectivity in layered chiral NbOX$_2$ (X = Cl, Br, I) crystals based on\nphotostriction-driven phase transitions. Ab-initio simulations reveal that\noptical excitation is capable of inducing a structural phase transition in\nNbOX$_2$ from the monoclinic ($C2$) ground state to the higher-symmetry\n($C2/m$) structure. In the resulting transient high-symmetry state, an applied\nelectric field breaks the residual inversion-symmetry degeneracy, selectively\nstabilizing one enantiomeric final state configuration over the other. Our\nresults establish a combined optical-electrical control scheme for chiral\nmaterials, enabling reversible and non-contact enantiomer selection with\npotential applications in ultrafast switching, optoelectronics, and chiral\ninformation storage."}

It has been demonstrated\nthat, by incorporating modern machine learning algorithms, one can predict\nmaterial properties with practically acceptable accuracy. However, one of the\nmost significant limitations that restrict the widespread application of\nmachine learning is its lack of transferability, as a given framework is\ntypically applicable only to a specific property. The origin of this limitation\nis rooted in the fact that a material's properties are determined by multiple\ndegrees of freedom -- and their complex interplay -- associated with nuclei and\nelectrons, such as atomic type, structural symmetry, and the number and quantum\nstates of the valence electrons, among others. The inherent complexity rules\nout the possibility of a single machine learning framework providing a full\ndescription of these critical quantities.

Nevertheless, the magnetic ground state of RuO$_2$\nremains contentious, as several recent experiments report no evidence of\nmagnetic order. To address this discrepancy, we performed resonant elastic\nscattering measurements on a series of epitaxial RuO$_2$ thin films grown on\nthe (100)-plane of TiO$_2$ substrates across a range of strain states.\nLeveraging full polarization control and azimuthal scans of the structurally\nforbidden 100 Bragg reflection, we systematically tested for signatures of\ncolinear antiferromagnetic order. We found that the resonant elastic scattering\nsignal in RuO$_2$ thin films likely originates from anisotropic charge\nscattering, not long-range antiferromagnetic order. Using angle-resolved\nphotoemission spectroscopy we uncover a band structure without altermagnetic\nband splitting that is consistent with a nonmagnetic phase. Similarly,\nanisotropic magnetoresistance results show no evidence of magnetism. The\ncombination of three independent measurements suggests the absence of\naltermagnetism in RuO$_2$."}

In h-BN, the presence of a\nnitrogen monovacancy significantly lowers the work function from 5.97 eV to\n3.45 eV, one of the lowest values reported for any 2D material. Additionally,\nthis defect reduces the band gap from 4.6 eV to 0.64 eV, driving the material\ntoward half-metallic behavior. This is accompanied by the emergence of flat\nbands near the Fermi level, indicative of strong electron-electron\ninteractions. In g-C$_3$N$_4$, nitrogen vacancies lead to a decrease in work\nfunction and band gap, with double nitrogen vacancies rendering the material\nnearly metallic. In BeN$_4$, nitrogen vacancies result in minimal charge\nredistribution and a slight increase in work function, highlighting the\nmaterial's unique electronic behavior.

We find that periodic buckling in large-angle TBG\ninitially enhances band flattening compared to monolayer graphene, but for\nsufficiently strong buckling, it instead increases the band dispersion. This\noccurs both because of the presence of interlayer coupling, which reduces the\nin-plane kinetic energy, and due to the opening of a gap at the Dirac point\nresulting from inversion-symmetry breaking. Additionally, we find that\nbuckling-induced band flattening competes with twist-induced band flattening.\nWhile the former breaks sublattice symmetry, generating a sublattice\npolarization, the latter prefers to preserve it.

The results show that the observed resonant diffraction\nin RuO$_2$ is fully consistent with a resonant charge anisotropy signal of\nstructural origin permitted by the parent (non-magnetic) rutile $P4_2/mnm$\nspace group. These results significantly constrain the magnetic contribution to\nthe resonant diffraction signal and indicate the unlikely existence of\n$\\mathbf{k} = 0$ antiferromagnetic order in RuO$_2$."}

We assume the GQD edges are saturated with hydrogen atoms,\neffectively making it a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) such as coronene.\nBy combining the GQD spectrum calculated from a time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) with\nthe dynamical behavior of a QD model derived from QED, we calculate the main\noptical characteristics of the GQD, such as its transition frequencies, the\ndipole moment associated to each of those transitions, life-time and the\npopulation dynamics of the molecular levels. Owing to the close match between\nthe calculated spectrum and experimental results, our results represent a\nsignificant contribution to research on quantum treatments of light-matter\ninteractions in realistic 2D nanomaterials."}

Nevertheless, the magnetic ground state of RuO$_2$\nremains contentious, as several recent experiments report no evidence of\nmagnetic order. To address this discrepancy, we performed resonant elastic\nscattering measurements on a series of epitaxial RuO$_2$ thin films grown on\nthe (100)-plane of TiO$_2$ substrates across a range of strain states.\nLeveraging full polarization control and azimuthal scans of the structurally\nforbidden 100 Bragg reflection, we systematically tested for signatures of\ncolinear antiferromagnetic order. We found that the resonant elastic scattering\nsignal in RuO$_2$ thin films likely originates from anisotropic charge\nscattering, not long-range antiferromagnetic order. Using angle-resolved\nphotoemission spectroscopy we uncover a band structure without altermagnetic\nband splitting that is consistent with a nonmagnetic phase. Similarly,\nanisotropic magnetoresistance results show no evidence of magnetism. The\ncombination of three independent measurements suggests the absence of\naltermagnetism in RuO$_2$."}

The method operates in a two-stage loop of self-sampling and model\nrefinement, progressively improving its ability to target low-energy\nstructures.
