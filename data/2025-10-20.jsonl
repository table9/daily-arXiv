While\ndeterministic models (partial differential equations) of such processes are\nwell established, their inability to capture inherent randomness, and the\nassumption of a large number of particles, hinders their applicability. To\naddress these issues, we present several equivalent (discrete-space\ndiscrete-time) random walk models of diffusion described by a\nspatially-invariant tensor on a two-dimensional domain with no-flux boundary\nconditions. Our approach involves discretising the deterministic model in space\nand time to give a homogeneous Markov chain governing particle movement between\n(spatial) lattice sites over time. The spatial discretisation is carried out\nusing a vertex-centred element-based finite volume method on rectangular and\nhexagonal lattices, and a forward Euler discretisation in time yields a\nnearest-neighbour random walk model with simple analytical expressions for the\ntransition probabilities. For each lattice configuration, analysis of these\nexpressions yields constraints on the time step duration, spatial steps and\ndiffusion tensor to ensure the probabilities are between zero and one. We find\nthat model implementation on a rectangular lattice can be achieved with a\nconstraint on the diffusion tensor, whereas a hexagonal lattice overcomes this\nlimitation (no restrictions on the diffusion tensor).

While topological magnons in honeycomb ferromagnets\nwith weak next-nearest-neighbor Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions (DMI) have\nbeen extensively investigated, the strong-DMI regime remains largely\nunexplored.

Accounting for pinning is a key requirement\nfor predictive modeling of skyrmion systems, as it impacts the systems'\ndynamics and introduces randomizing effects. In this article, we use\nmagneto-optical Kerr microscopy to image skyrmions in a magnetic thin film\nsystem in real time and analyze their hopping dynamics within the non-flat\nenergy landscape. To achieve a fully quantitative model, we utilize skyrmion\ndiffusion and dwell times at pinning sites to extrapolate the pinning energy\nlandscape into regions that cannot be sampled on reasonable experimental time\nscales. For evaluation with a coarse-grained Thiele model, we perform long-time\nmeasurements of skyrmion diffusion and then develop a two-step procedure to\ndetermine simulation parameters by comparing them to experimentally accessible\nbehavior. This provides a direct conversion between simulation and experimental\nunits, which is the missing key step that has previously prevented quantitative\nquasiparticle modeling. We demonstrate the predictive power of our approach by\nmeasuring the experimentally unexplored density dependence of skyrmion\ndiffusion and show that it is in excellent agreement with simulation\npredictions.

It is natural to expect that the\nassociated electronic angular momentum drives a rotation when the current is\nturned on. As intuitive as this relation might seem, it is also incomplete\nbecause a formal definition of helicality in terms of a physical observable has\nnot yet been given.

We\nexemplify the relation between helicality and angular momentum in H\\\"uckel\nmodels of linear carbon chains (cumulenes and oligoynes). We attribute the\npreviously reported opposite helicality sense of frontier orbitals (HOMO and\nLUMO) to the approximate sub-lattice symmetry.

Compared to traditional XAS analysis methods,\nAI/ML approaches offer dramatic improvements in efficiency and help eliminate\nhuman bias. To advance this field, we advocate an AI-driven XAS analysis\npipeline that features several inter-connected key building blocks: benchmarks,\nworkflows, databases, and AI/ML models. Specifically, we present two case\nstudies for XAS ML. In the first study, we demonstrate the importance of\nreconciling the discrepancies between simulation and experiment using spectral\ndomain mapping (SDM). Our ML model, which is trained solely on simulated\nspectra, predicts an incorrect oxidation state trend for Ti atoms in a\ncombinatorial zinc titanate film. After transforming the experimental spectra\ninto a simulation-like representation using SDM, the same model successfully\nrecovers the correct oxidation state trend.

While such measurements are routinely performed on\natoms and molecules in the gas phase, spectroscopy of adsorbed species on\nsurfaces is faced with challenges. As a result, previous studies of\nsurface-adsorbed molecules have fallen short of the ultimate resolution, where\nthe transition linewidth is determined by the lifetime of the excited state. In\nthis work, we conceive a new approach to surface deposition and report on\nFourier-limited electronic transitions in single dibenzoterrylenes adsorbed\nonto the surface of an anthracene crystal. By performing spectroscopy and\nsuper-resolution microscopy at liquid helium temperature, we shed light on\nvarious properties of the adsorbed molecules. Our experimental results pave the\nway for a new class of experiments in surface science, where high spatial and\nspectral resolution can be combined."}

Here, a mechanism driving the rotation is\npresented based on electron current through helical orbitals on a $\\pi$-bonded\ncarbon chain. Such electron current through helical orbitals has been shown to\nbe circulating around the carbon chain. It is natural to expect that the\nassociated electronic angular momentum drives a rotation when the current is\nturned on. As intuitive as this relation might seem, it is also incomplete\nbecause a formal definition of helicality in terms of a physical observable has\nnot yet been given. Such a definition is proposed here. Based on this\ndefinition, we show how helicality determines the motor's sense of rotation. We\nexemplify the relation between helicality and angular momentum in H\\\"uckel\nmodels of linear carbon chains (cumulenes and oligoynes). We attribute the\npreviously reported opposite helicality sense of frontier orbitals (HOMO and\nLUMO) to the approximate sub-lattice symmetry. For oligoynes, this symmetry is\nhidden in the sense that it does not reduce to a mere labeling of atoms.\nSub-lattice symmetry, combined with time-reversal invariance, allows us to\nderive Onsager-type reciprocal relations of various linear response\ncoefficients, dictating e.g. an odd energy dependence of angular momentum\nresponse to voltage bias. We propose an observable consequence of the\napproximate sub-lattice symmetry: If the carbon chain is employed as an axle of\na molecular rotor, the sense of rotation is independent on the direction of the\ncurrent."}

By considering the unique charge carrier mobility in\nperovskites, this study introduces three new ABO3-type high-entropy perovskites\n(Ba1/2Sr1/2)(Ti1/3Zr1/3Hf1/3)O3, (Ba1/2Sr1/2)(Ga1/3In1/3Sn1/3)O3 and\n(Ba1/2Sr1/2)(Ti1/3Zr1/3Sn1/3)O3 for cocatalyst-free photocatalysis. The three\ncatalysts, having a single-phase cubic structure, are designed by considering\nconfigurational entropy, tolerance factor, octahedral factor, ionic radius\ndeviation and valence deviation of >1.5R (R: gas constant), 0.9-1.0, 0.4-0.8,\n>0.3 and >0.3, respectively. The perovskites exhibit similar valence band tops,\nwhile their bandgaps vary slightly depending on the composition at the B-site\n(slightly lower bandgap by including d10 cations). Additionally, all three\nmaterials demonstrate effective hydrogen generation without the need for added\ncocatalysts. This investigation confirms that high-entropy oxide perovskites\ncan offer significant potential for cocatalyst-free photocatalytic reactions."}
