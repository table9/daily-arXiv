Conventional\nneutralizer performance is typically evaluated using the $N_it$ product, which\nassumes quasi-neutral conditions and neglects electric fields from small charge\nimbalances. We demonstrate that internal electric fields become increasingly\nimportant at high aerosol concentrations and significantly influence\nneutralization dynamics. We develop a coupled ion--aerosol transport model in a\ntwo-dimensional axisymmetric geometry that includes ion generation, convection,\ndiffusion, recombination, attachment to aerosols, and wall loss, with\nself-consistent electric fields obtained from the Poisson equation. Results\nshow that even small net charges generate electric fields that enhance ion\ndrift and accelerate neutralization, effects not captured by traditional\n$N_it$-based approaches. Using a neutralization time metric, we find that\nneutralization becomes slower with increasing aerosol number concentration\n$N_p$, higher initial particle charge $q_0$, and smaller particle diameter\n$d_p$ when space charge is absent. When space charge is included, the influence\nof $q_0$ and $d_p$ diminishes, while $N_p$ becomes the dominant factor\ngoverning neutralization behavior.

Traditional treatments, such as ghost particles and\nsemi-analytical wall corrections, restore kernel completeness but add\nsignificant computational cost and complexity, especially for irregular\ngeometries. We propose a physics-informed machine learning (ML) framework that\ndirectly predicts boundary correction terms for particle approximations,\neliminating the need for ghost particles or analytical corrections. The\nframework is based on a hybrid convolutional neural network-multilayer\nperceptron (CNN-MLP) trained on physics-informed features that capture local\ngeometry, particle states, and kernel properties. Once trained, it provides\nconsistent boundary contributions across all spatial differential operators,\nincluding gradients, divergences, and Laplacians. The approach is demonstrated\nwith MPS but is readily extensible to other particle methods such as SPH.

This effect can be achieved for skyrmions moving in a\nchannel with a sawtooth potential on one side and a reversed sawtooth potential\non the other side. We consider the cases of both spin-transfer torque (STT) and\nspin-orbit torque (SOT) driving. When the magnetic field is held fixed, the\nvelocity response of the skyrmion is the same for current applied in either\ndirection for both STT and SOT driving, so there is no current diode effect.\nWhen the magnetic field is reversed, under STT driving the velocity of the\nskyrmion reverses and its absolute value changes. Under SOT driving, the\nvelocity remains in the same direction but drops to a much lower value,\nresulting in negative differential conductivity. For a fixed current, we find a\nnonreciprocal skyrmion velocity as a function of positive and negative applied\nfields, in analogy to the velocity-current curves observed in the usual diode\neffect. The nonreciprocity is generated by the Magnus force, which causes\nskyrmions to interact preferentially with one side of the channel. Since the\nchannel sides have opposite asymmetry, a positive magnetic field can cause the\nskyrmion to interact with the \"hard\" asymmetry side of the channel, while a\nnegative magnetic field causes the skyrmion to interact with the easy asymmetry\nside.

Rational\napproximations of these operators need to properly map their spectra onto the\ncomplex plane, accurately handling propagating modes while annihilating\nevanescent ones. Standard approaches for stable and accurate rational\napproximations include rotating the branch cut of the operators or imposing\nstability constraint equations, and have yielded accurate results for wave\npropagation in a variety of fluid, elastic, and fluid-elastic waveguides. The\nstability constraint method, however, does not yield operators that are stable\nfor all fluid-elastic waveguides, and a recent study of waveguides comprised of\na thin elastic layer overlaying a thick fluid layer revealed instabilities in\nthe approximations derived from rotated operators. In this paper, we\ndemonstrate the applicability of a different rational approximation method, the\nrecently-developed adaptive Antoulas-Anderson (AAA) algorithm, to simulations\nof wave propagation using the fluid-elastic parabolic equation. We find that\nsimulations using operators approximated using the AAA algorithm provide\nexcellent agreement with reference solutions, with errors in transmission loss\ncomparable to, and often less than, that of simulations using the rotated\noperator method.

This effect can be achieved for skyrmions moving in a\nchannel with a sawtooth potential on one side and a reversed sawtooth potential\non the other side. We consider the cases of both spin-transfer torque (STT) and\nspin-orbit torque (SOT) driving. When the magnetic field is held fixed, the\nvelocity response of the skyrmion is the same for current applied in either\ndirection for both STT and SOT driving, so there is no current diode effect.\nWhen the magnetic field is reversed, under STT driving the velocity of the\nskyrmion reverses and its absolute value changes. Under SOT driving, the\nvelocity remains in the same direction but drops to a much lower value,\nresulting in negative differential conductivity. For a fixed current, we find a\nnonreciprocal skyrmion velocity as a function of positive and negative applied\nfields, in analogy to the velocity-current curves observed in the usual diode\neffect. The nonreciprocity is generated by the Magnus force, which causes\nskyrmions to interact preferentially with one side of the channel. Since the\nchannel sides have opposite asymmetry, a positive magnetic field can cause the\nskyrmion to interact with the \"hard\" asymmetry side of the channel, while a\nnegative magnetic field causes the skyrmion to interact with the easy asymmetry\nside.

Employing a\nfully three-dimensional tight-binding formalism benchmarked against density\nfunctional theory calculations we predict the semimetal-semiconductor\ntransition to occur in van der Waals carbyne crystals composed by the chains of\nabout 42 atoms long. The semiconductor phase is characterized by a hyperbolic\nvan Hove singularity which gives rise to unconventional hyperbolic exciton\nstates.

The exciton\noscillator strength is found to be strongly sensitive to the length of carbon\nchains: our experiments show that it decreases with the increasing chain\nlength. This tendency, confirmed by the theoretical modeling, manifests the\nevolution of the hyperbolic exciton state on the way to the\nsemiconductor-semimetal crossover.

The interplay between these two distinct\nforms of modulation-temporal and spatial-opens a new frontier in\nelectronic-phase-dependent Floquet engineering.

This impact is underpinned by the exceptional\nproperties of MHPs, including tuneable band gaps, high absorption coefficients,\nlong carrier diffusion lengths and combined with uncomplicated synthesis\nmethods. However, current MHP production relies on the toxic solvents, which\npose significant environmental and health risks. Moreover, these methods often\nrequire complex multi component solvent systems and thermal processing to\nachieve the desired material phases, further hindering scalability and\nsustainability. Overcoming these challenges is critical to the future\ndevelopment of MHP-based technologies. Overcoming these challenges is critical\nto the future development of MHP-based technologies. Here, we present a novel\nwater-based solvent system and synthetic approach for the preparation of\nsize-controlled CsPbBr3 perovskite nanocrystals in ambient air and at room\ntemperature. The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of CsPbBr3 erovskite\nnanocrystals (PNCs) exceeds 60 precent. To demonstrate the light to current\nconversion ability of our PNCs a series of photoconductors were prepared, with\nthe best performing devices achieving a specific detectivity (D*) of 1.2 x\n10^11 Jones. Thus, this green, scalable, and low-cost approach offers a\nsustainable pathway for precise size and compositional control of MHP\nnanocrystals, opening new possibilities for environmentally friendly\noptoelectronic applications."}
