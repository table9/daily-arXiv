This challenge becomes especially\napparent in molecular-level particle simulations, where high spatial and\ntemporal resolution leads to rapidly increasing computational demands. To\novercome these limitations, hybrid methods that combine simulations with\ndifferent levels of resolution offer a promising solution. In this context, we\npresent a machine learning-based decision model that dynamically selects\nbetween simulation methods at runtime. The model is built around a Multilayer\nperceptron (MLP) that predicts the expected discrepancy between particle and\ncontinuum simulation results, enabling the localized use of high-fidelity\nparticle simulations only where they are expected to add value. This concurrent\napproach is applied to the simulation of membrane fabrication processes, where\na particle simulation is coupled with a continuum model. This article describes\nthe architecture of the decision model and its integration into the simulation\nworkflow, enabling efficient, scalable, and adaptive multiscale simulations."}

To overcome this issue, two types of solutes are added\nto the Cu matrix: A first solute with a strong vacancy binding energy (B-type\nspecies) and another solute that binds to 'B' and is a slow diffuser in Cu\n(C-type species). Using DFT, 21 synergistic solute pairs are screened, with\n'B'=Zr, Ge, Sn and 'C'=Fe, Co, Mo, Ni, Nb, W, Cr.

Cylindrical structures typical of GSB antenna complexes,\nand the dimeric baseplate comparable to natural size have been considered. Our\nanalysis shows that under natural sunlight, in photosynthetic antennae of GSB\nthe number of excitations reaching the RC per unit time matches the RC closure\nrate and the internal efficiency shows values close to $\\sim 80\\%$. We also\nconsidered cylindrical structures where the orientation of the dipoles does not\nreflect the natural one. Specifically, we vary continuously the angle of the\ntransition dipole with respect to the cylinder main axis, focusing on the case\nwhere all dipoles are parallel to the cylinder axis. We also consider the\nimportant case where the dipoles are randomly oriented. In all cases the\nlight-harvesting efficiency is lower than in the natural structure, showing the\nhigh sensitivity of light harvesting to the specific orientation of the dipole\nmoments. Our results allow for a better understanding of the relationship\nbetween structure and functionality in photosynthetic antennae of GSB and could\ndrive the design of efficient light-harvesting devices."}

The mean, variance, and\ntwo-time correlations are computed exactly and lead to a picture of\nquasiparticles as drifting Brownian particles. For the case of a homogeneous\nbackground, we show that the motion of two tagged quasiparticles is strongly\ncorrelated, and they move like a rigid rod at late times. Apart from a\nmicroscopic derivation based on the mapping to point particles, we provide an\nalternate derivation which emphasizes that quasiparticle fluctuations are\nrelated to initial phase-space fluctuations, which are carried over in time by\nEuler scale dynamics. For the homogeneous state, we use the Brownian motion\npicture to develop a Dean-Kawasaki-type fluctuating hydrodynamic theory,\nformally having the same structure as that derived recently by Ferrari and\nOlla.
