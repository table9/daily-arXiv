However, the\nmegabar pressures required for synthesize and maintain its state present\nextraordinary challenges for experiments, particularly in characterizing its\nMeissner effect (3, 4). The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond has emerged\nas a promising quantum probe to address this problem (5-8), but a gap remains\nbetween its working pressure and the pressure required to study the\nsuperconducting state of lanthanum hydride (9-12). In this work, using neon gas\nas the pressure transmitting medium, the working pressure of NV centers is\nextended to nearly 200 GPa. This quantum probe is then applied to study the\nMeissner effect of a LaH$_{9.6}$ sample, synthesized by laser heating ammonia\nborane and lanthanum. A strong magnetic shielding effect is observed, with the\ntransition temperature beginning at around 180 K and completing at 220 K. In\naddition, magnetic field imaging after field cooling reveals strong flux\ntrapping and significant inhomogeneities within the sample.

Both of these contributions arise from the dual\nmirror symmetry breaking from the surface and from the dc applied field. Our\ncalculations show that the resulting Kerr rotation is due to the dc electric\nfield modification of the optical conductivity within a couple of nanometers\nfrom the surface, consistent with the dependence on the local mirror symmetry\nbreaking at the surface.

Computing these moments is expensive\nbecause the integrands are highly oscillatory, even when the bubble dynamics\nare linear. Ensemble-averaged models compute these moments at each grid point\nand time step, making cost reduction important for large-scale bubbly flow\nsimulations. Traditional methods evaluate the integrals via traditional\nquadrature rules. This approach requires a large number of quadrature nodes in\nthe equilibrium bubble size, each equipped with its own advection partial\ndifferential equation (PDE), resulting in significant computational expense. We\nformulate a Levin collocation method to reduce this cost. Given the\ndifferential equation associated with the integrand, or moment, the method\napproximates it by evaluating its derivative via polynomial collocation. The\ndifferential matrix and amplitude function are well-suited to numerical\ndifferentiation via collocation, and so the computation is comparatively cheap.\nFor an example excited polydisperse bubble population, the first moment is\ncomputed with the presented method at $10^{-3}$ relative error with 100 times\nfewer quadrature nodes than the trapezoidal rule.

When $J_D>J_S,J_D>0$, the valley\ndoublet only couples via pair-hopping processes to the conduction electrons, in\nsharp contrast to the conventional Kondo scenario. Upon increasing $J_D$, there\nis a quantum phase transition of the BKT universality class, from a Fermi\nliquid to an anisotropic doublet phase, the latter exhibiting power-law\nsusceptibilities with non-universal exponents. On the other hand, when\n$J_S>J_D,J_S>0$, increasing $J_S$ induces a second-order phase transition from\nFermi liquid to a local singlet phase, which involves a non-Fermi liquid as an\nintermediate fixed point. Near the transition towards the anisotropic doublet\n(local singlet) phase, the renormalized interaction of the Fermi liquid becomes\nattractive, favoring doublet (singlet) pairing.

All modes have energy contributions of\nboth indium and oxygen lattice sites, except for one, which corresponds to a\npure oxygen vibrational state. Applying Raman spectroscopy, those results could\nbe verified experimentally with excellent agreement. Investigated samples\nconsisted of a bulk single crystal with $^{16}$O isotopes and a MBE grown thin\nfilm as the $^{18}$O sample. Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry\nconfirms the purity of the oxygen isotope in the sample.

The resulting backaction reduces the plasmon group velocity and\ncan suppress the apparent thermal conductance by an amount consistent with\nexperiment.

We interpret its average velocity as a bit and show that depending\non the memory time characterizing the viscoelastic bath the particle can be\neither in one of two stable states representing the bit values or in a chaotic\nstate in which the information is erased and a new bit can be generated. We\nanalyze randomness of the so obtained bit sequence and assess the stability of\nthe produced values. Our study provides a blueprint for storing and processing\ninformation in a microscopic system using its memory."}

We derive a complete phase diagram and\nanalytically solve the impurity problem at several fixed points using\nbosonization and refermionization techniques. When $J_D>J_S,J_D>0$, the valley\ndoublet only couples via pair-hopping processes to the conduction electrons, in\nsharp contrast to the conventional Kondo scenario. Upon increasing $J_D$, there\nis a quantum phase transition of the BKT universality class, from a Fermi\nliquid to an anisotropic doublet phase, the latter exhibiting power-law\nsusceptibilities with non-universal exponents. On the other hand, when\n$J_S>J_D,J_S>0$, increasing $J_S$ induces a second-order phase transition from\nFermi liquid to a local singlet phase, which involves a non-Fermi liquid as an\nintermediate fixed point. Near the transition towards the anisotropic doublet\n(local singlet) phase, the renormalized interaction of the Fermi liquid becomes\nattractive, favoring doublet (singlet) pairing.

However, the mechanism of\nelectrical conduction through such complex systems is still poorly understood.\nTo identify structural parameters that govern the electrical current in CNT\nfilms, we employed coarse-grained molecular dynamics to construct dense\nmesoscale CNT film models, where we considered CNTs with different chiralities\nand lengths. The effects of CNT geometrical features on the film morphologies\nwere quantified by devising a set of structural descriptors and analyzing their\nmutual correlations. The impact of varying the concentration of amorphous\ncarbon (aC) inclusions on the film structure was assessed. Finally, we employed\na nodal analysis framework to compute the electrical current across the\nnetworks and correlate the charge transport characteristics to the underlying\nstructural descriptors. Transport is found to be enhanced in films that exhibit\nhigh curvature and buckling, low bundling, and strong connectivity, with\namorphous carbon components playing a nontrivial configuration-dependent role.\nThese findings provide a framework for the rational design of CNT-based\nmemristor architectures and highlight the potential of mesoscale modeling to\nguide the engineering of advanced nanostructured materials."}

While vertical IPs can be accessed directly from electronic\nexcitations at fixed nuclear geometries, the computation of adiabatic IPs\nrequires nuclear gradients of the ionized states, posing a major theoretical\nand computational challenge, especially within correlated frameworks. Among the\nmost promising approaches for IP calculations is the many-body Green's function\n$GW$ method, which provides a balanced compromise between accuracy and\ncomputational efficiency. Furthermore, it is applicable to both finite and\nextended systems. Recent work has established formal connections between $GW$\nand coupled-cluster doubles (CCD) theory, leading to the first derivation of\nanalytic $GW$ nuclear gradients via a unitary CCD framework. In this work, we\npresent an alternative, fully analytic formulation of $GW$ nuclear gradients\nbased on a modified version of the traditional equation-of-motion CCD\nformalism, enabling the inclusion of missing correlation effects in the\ntraditional CCD methods."}
