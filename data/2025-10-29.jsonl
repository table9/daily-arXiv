Here, we report the first\ndirect observation of a hcp ice phase using synchrotron x-ray diffraction in\nlaser-heated diamond anvil cells. Between 80 and 200 GPa, we observe the\ncoexistence of fcc and hcp ice, arising from stacking disorder in the fcc\noxygen layers, similar to phenomena seen in compressed noble gases. Above 200\nGPa, the hcp phase becomes dominant and is recovered at 300 K, indicating its\nincreased thermodynamic stability at ultrahigh pressures.

The presented\napproach integrates green chemistry principles with an operator-friendly,\nlow-cost, and practical solution for spatial and temporal pH measurement. CQDs\nfunctionalized with m-aminophenylboronic acid enable highly sensitive and\nreversible pH readouts through two complementary mechanisms: ratiometric\nmonitoring of emission band intensities, and direct visual observation of\ncolorimetric changes reflected in the CIE1931 chromaticity coordinates. The\nsystem achieves maximal sensitivities of 137 percent per pH unit and 49.5\npercent per pH unit, respectively, while simultaneously maintaining high\nmeasurement resolution and full reproducibility of the readouts, placing it\namong the most effective CQD-based pH sensors reported to date.

Under boundary\nlubrication, Si-doped DLC (Si-DLC) exhibited the lowest coefficient of friction\n($\\approx$0.045) and nearly 45% lower wear than undoped DLC. Co-DLC showed\nmoderate improvement, while Ag-DLC provided no significant benefit.\nCross-sectional FIB-TEM revealed thin tribofilms, 12-17 nm in thickness, on Si-\nand Co-doped surfaces. As reported for Si-DLC, these films incorporate\ncopolymer-derived fragments, suggesting a similar composition for Co-DLC. These\nresults indicate that dopant-polymer interactions are key to the development of\nself-organized boundary layers. To gain atomic-level insight, first-principles\ncalculations were carried out on the adsorption of the dimethylaminoethyl\nmethacrylate (DMAEMA) unit, the copolymer's functional group. The calculated\nadsorption energies were $-$2.27 to $-$0.57 eV for Si-DLC, $-$1.73 to $-$1.49\neV for Co(0001), and $-$1.21 to $-$1.08 eV for Ag(111). The order of stability\n(Si $>$ Co $>$ Ag) was consistent with the experimental tribological ranking.\nChemical bonding dominated for Si-DLC, while Ag showed mainly weak\nphysisorption. Simulated pull-off forces further reflected this hierarchy, with\nN-Si bonds requiring about twice the force of N-Co and nearly five times that\nof N-Ag. The correspondence between adsorption strength and tribological\nresponse highlights the decisive role of dopant species in tribofilm formation.\nThese findings provide guidance for designing durable low-friction surfaces in\napplications such as electric drivetrains and precision mechanical systems."}

Here, we introduce a modular, graph-based simulator that\nacts as a digital surrogate for a semiconductor quantum dot device, where\ncomputationally expensive processes are accelerated using deep learning. We\ndemonstrate its potential by estimating crosstalk effects between gate\nelectrodes and applying these estimates to construct virtual gates in a quantum\ndot device. We validate our approach through comparison with experiments on a\ndouble quantum dot defined in a Ge/SiGe heterostructure.

However, HR factors remain\nchallenging to calculate from first principles, complicated by convergence\nissues in excited-state relaxation and time consuming phonon calculations. Even\nwhen calculated, HR factors lack a rational design principle. Here we show that\nan orbital-based descriptor can be used to rationalize and efficiently estimate\nHR factors. Combining this descriptor with a ground state deformation technique\nallows circumventing both excited state relaxation and full phonon\ncalculations. Specifically, our descriptor for HR factors is constructed using\nbonding character differences obtained from ground state density functional\ntheory, measured using crystal orbital Hamilton populations. We demonstrate\nthis descriptor for prototypical hBN defects and the diamond NV center.

In fact,\nsuch memory-induced LRO (MILRO) arises in a wide range of physical systems.\nHere, we show that MILRO can be transferred to coupled systems that have no\nmemory of their own. As an example, we consider a stack of layers of spins with\nlocal feedforward couplings: only the first layer contains memory, while\ndownstream layers are memory-free and locally interacting. Analytical arguments\nand simulations reveal that MILRO can indeed drag across the layers, enabling\ndownstream layers to sustain intra-layer LRO despite having neither memory nor\nlong-range interactions. This establishes a simple, yet generic mechanism for\npropagating collective activity through media without fine tuning to\ncriticality, with testable implications for neuromorphic systems and laminar\ninformation flow in the brain cortex."}

XPS analysis revealed\nsignificant energy shifts (-1.5 to -1.8 eV) and broadening of the PE lines for\nall atoms upon polymerization, indicating a major redistribution of valence\nelectron density between the monomer fragments. In the oxidized polymer, new\nfeatures in the Ni 2p and O 1s PE spectra were associated with the formation of\npolarons with weakened Ni-O bonds; this effect diminished upon reduction as the\nnumber of polarons decreased. Quantum-chemical calculations attributed the\nvalence band broadening to enhanced C 2p contributions from $\\pi$-conjugation\nbetween monomers.

We discuss in particular the challenge of\nself-consistent field optimisation in calculations related to the regularised\nnoninteracting Hohenberg--Kohn map.
