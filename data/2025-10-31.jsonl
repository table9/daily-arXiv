Reconstructing an effective Hamiltonian\ndirectly from experimental data is challenging due to the complex relationship\nbetween Hamiltonian parameters and observables. Complimentary to ARPES, which\nprobes surface electronic properties, bulk-sensitive techniques based on HHG\nand HSG have shown strong potential for Hamiltonian reconstruction. Here, we\nreconstruct an effective three-band electron-hole Hamiltonian in bulk GaAs\nbased on HSG. Based on previous understanding of HSG in bulk GaAs in terms of\nBloch-wave interferometry, an analytic model is derived to quantitatively\nconnect the Hamiltonian parameters with the measured sideband electric fields\nunder strong, low-frequency THz fields. Assuming that the exciton reduced mass\nand the parameter that defines the hole Bloch wavefunctions in bulk GaAs are\nknown from existing absorbance and HSG experiments, we show that the bandgap of\nGaAs, two dephasing constants associated with two electron-hole species, and an\nadditional Hamiltonian parameter that determines the electron-hole reduced\nmasses, can be simultaneously and unambiguously determined through Bloch-wave\ninterferometry.

In this work we point\nout the possibility of a symmetric pseudogap metal with small hole pockets,\ndubbed as second Fermi liquid (sFL). In the sFL phase at $\\nu=-2-x$, there is a\ntwo-component picture: two electrons mainly localize on the AA sites and form a\npaired singlet due to anti-Hund's coupling mediated by the optical phonon,\nwhile additional holes form small Fermi surfaces. The sFL phase corresponds to\nan intrinsically strongly interacting fixed point and violates the perturbative\nLuttinger theorem. We develop a unified framework to describe both a\nrenormalized Fermi liquid (FL) and an sFL phase. We propose that the normal\nstate of the TBG superconductor is the sFL phase, but it evolves toward the FL\nphase under increasing hole doping. The superconducting phase emerges from the\nsFL phase by transferring pairing of local moments to the mobile carriers.\nInterestingly, the superconducting gap can exhibit a nematic nodal\n$p_x$-pairing symmetry.

Reconstructing an effective Hamiltonian\ndirectly from experimental data is challenging due to the complex relationship\nbetween Hamiltonian parameters and observables. Complimentary to ARPES, which\nprobes surface electronic properties, bulk-sensitive techniques based on HHG\nand HSG have shown strong potential for Hamiltonian reconstruction. Here, we\nreconstruct an effective three-band electron-hole Hamiltonian in bulk GaAs\nbased on HSG. Based on previous understanding of HSG in bulk GaAs in terms of\nBloch-wave interferometry, an analytic model is derived to quantitatively\nconnect the Hamiltonian parameters with the measured sideband electric fields\nunder strong, low-frequency THz fields. Assuming that the exciton reduced mass\nand the parameter that defines the hole Bloch wavefunctions in bulk GaAs are\nknown from existing absorbance and HSG experiments, we show that the bandgap of\nGaAs, two dephasing constants associated with two electron-hole species, and an\nadditional Hamiltonian parameter that determines the electron-hole reduced\nmasses, can be simultaneously and unambiguously determined through Bloch-wave\ninterferometry. We thus demonstrate the full capability of Hamiltonian\nreconstruction by combining absorbance spectroscopy and HSG experiments. We\nfind that the extracted bandgap of GaAs is approximately 13\\,meV higher than\nthe expected value based on previous absorbance measurements. Quantum kinetic\nanalysis suggests that, in the HSG experiments, the electron-hole energy could\nhave been renormalized through Fr\\\"ohlich interaction that is modified by the\nstrong THz fields. We also show that the energy threshold in emission of\noptical phonons can be suppressed by applying a strong THz field, leading to\nnearly constant dephasing rates."}

Low-temperature Hall\nmeasurements confirm that electron mobility decreases with increasing interface\nroughness, with the highest mobility observed in the structure with a thin AlN\nbuffer. Transient thermoreflectance measurements show that thermal conductivity\n(ThC) of the AlN buffer increases with the thickness, reaching 188 W/m.K at 300\nK for the 2 {\\mu}m buffer layer, which is approximately 60% of the bulk AlN ThC\nvalue.

We\ninvestigate this competition on a two-leg ladder model with a p-wave-like\nhybridisation between the legs. This model hosts a symmetry-protected\ntopological phase in its non-interacting limit. Using the density-matrix\nrenormalisation group algorithm, we compute the comprehensive quantum phase\ndiagram in the presence of a repulsive inter-leg density-density interaction.\nOur analysis, based on entanglement entropy and the entanglement spectrum,\nreveals a fascinating dichotomy in the stability of the topological phase. We\nfind a non-trivial change in the value of the edge entanglement entropy as we\ninclude interaction. Furthermore, we find that the phase boundary separating a\ntrivial insulator phase and a topological one with winding number two remains\nrobustly pinned at its non-interacting location, irrespective of the\ninteraction strength. Variation of the effective conformal field theory's\ncentral charge near the critical line explains the robustness of the gap. In\ncontrast, the transition to an insulating phase with winding number one is\nheavily renormalised, with the critical line shifting significantly as the\ninteraction increases. By successfully mapping the phase diagram and\nidentifying the distinct behaviours of the phase boundaries, our work clarifies\nhow interactions can selectively preserve or destroy different aspects of a\ntopological phase."}

Here, we\npropose a microscopic lattice model with a nematic superconducting ground state\nand show that it supports a rich set of vestigial phases at elevated\ntemperature, including a charge-$4e$ phase and a quasi-long-range nematic\nphase, by performing large-scale Monte Carlo simulations. Combining theoretical\nanalysis with Monte Carlo simulations, we uncover the nature of these phases\nand show that the phase transitions are governed by the proliferation of\ndistinct topological defects: half superconducting vortices,\n$(\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2})$ vortices, integer nematic vortices, and\ndomain-wall excitations. In particular, we demonstrate that domain-wall\nproliferation is crucial for the quasi-nematic phase and should be carefully\naccounted for in phase transitions associated with vestigial charge-$4e$ order."}

This\nstudy investigates the effects of controlled atomic hydrogen exposure on young\nand mature soot nanoparticles, generated in premixed ethylene-air flames, and\ndeposited on substrates. We employed a multi-technique approach to characterize\nthe chemical, mechanical, and electrical evolution of the films. In-situ\ninfrared spectroscopy revealed non-monotonic behavior: an initial increase in\naliphatic CH bonds was observed, followed by a decrease at higher hydrogen\nfluences. This was accompanied by a continuous decrease in the aromatic C=C\nsignal. Atomic force microscopy showed a significant increase in the Young's\nmodulus of the film for both sample types after hydrogenation. This mechanical\nchange was correlated with an increase in the I(D)/I(G) ratio from Raman\nspectroscopy. Furthermore, both macroscopic current vs. voltage and local\nscanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements demonstrated a notable increase in\nelectrical conductivity. For single just-formed soot particles, moreover, a\nhydrogen-induced transformation from a semiconductive to a semi-metallic nature\nwas observed. The collective evidence points towards an H-induced CC\ncross-linking mechanism within the nanoparticle films. We propose that atomic\nhydrogen facilitates the formation of radical sites, which promotes covalent\nbond formation between adjacent particles or molecular units, creating a more\ninterconnected and rigid network, with smaller interlayer distance. These\nfindings provide crucial insights into the structural evolution of carbonaceous\nmaterials in hydrogen-rich environments, with direct implications for\nunderstanding soot formation and for the tailored design of carbon-based\nmaterials."}

Charge order in cuprates is characterized by\nshort-range coherence while competing with superconductivity, and as such, it\nprovides a representative case to study the role of phase fluctuation in\ncoupled order parameter dynamics. In this work, we investigated the intertwined\nevolution of charge order and superconductivity in cuprate/manganite\nheterostructures using time-resolved resonant X-ray scattering. The resulting\ndynamics are analyzed within a space- and time-dependent nonperturbative model\ncapturing both amplitude and phase dynamics. At low fluence, photo-induced\nsuppression of superconductivity results in a nonthermal enhancement of charge\norder, underscoring the dynamic competition between charge order and\nsuperconductivity. With increasing fluence, the slowing down of melting and\nrecovery dynamics is observed, indicating a critical role of phase\nfluctuations. At high fluence, both charge order and superconductivity remain\nsuppressed for an extended time window due to decoupling between amplitude and\nphase dynamics and the delayed recovery of phase coherence. Our work\nunderscores the importance of phase fluctuation for understanding the dynamic\ncompetition between order parameters in cuprates."}

In this work, we report the\nformation of a spin polaron in a context that doesn't fall cleanly into either\nof these paradigms. In particular, we study the one-dimensional Mielke-Tasaki\nchain, a paradigmatic model of flat band ferromagnetism, which has an exact\nferromagnetic ground state, trivial band topology, and quenched kinetic energy\nin its lowest band. Despite these features, our density matrix renormalization\ngroup simulations reveal the presence of spin polarons upon electron doping\nthis model. More surprisingly, combining these numerics with analytic\ncalculations, we show that polaron binding occurs when the interaction-induced\nkinetic energy of the model is zero -- contrary to intuition from kinetic\nmagnetism -- and the glue binding the electrons and spin-flips arises from weak\nmixing with the model's dispersive band -- contrary to what occurs in\ntopological flat bands. Our results open the doors to exploring how the quantum\ngeometry of flat bands drives the formation of exotic charge carriers."}

The most\nintriguing question is about the nature of the normal state: is the Cooper pair\nformed from small Fermi surface or large Fermi surface? In this work we point\nout the possibility of a symmetric pseudogap metal with small hole pockets,\ndubbed as second Fermi liquid (sFL). In the sFL phase at $\\nu=-2-x$, there is a\ntwo-component picture: two electrons mainly localize on the AA sites and form a\npaired singlet due to anti-Hund's coupling mediated by the optical phonon,\nwhile additional holes form small Fermi surfaces. The sFL phase corresponds to\nan intrinsically strongly interacting fixed point and violates the perturbative\nLuttinger theorem. We develop a unified framework to describe both a\nrenormalized Fermi liquid (FL) and an sFL phase. We propose that the normal\nstate of the TBG superconductor is the sFL phase, but it evolves toward the FL\nphase under increasing hole doping. The superconducting phase emerges from the\nsFL phase by transferring pairing of local moments to the mobile carriers.\nInterestingly, the superconducting gap can exhibit a nematic nodal\n$p_x$-pairing symmetry. This work provides, to our knowledge, the first unified\ntheory that explains both the pseudogap metal above $T_c$ and the two-gap\nnematic superconductivity below it."}
