Here, we apply a\nchemical informed transfer learning framework based on pre-trained deep neural\nnetworks, which achieves high accuracy in predicting the molecular modulator's\neffect on the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs. This framework is\nestablished through systematical benchmarking of diverse molecular\nrepresentations, enabling lowcost and high-throughput virtual screening over\n79,043 commercially available molecules. Furthermore, we leverage\ninterpretability techniques to visualize the learned chemical representation\nand experimentally characterize the resulting modulator-perovskite\ninteractions. The top molecular modulators identified by the framework are\nsubsequently validated experimentally, delivering a remarkably improved\nchampion PCE of 26.91% in PSCs."}

To demonstrate its effectiveness, we apply SAAM to study the\nspin ladder of iron-sulfur clusters, a long-standing challenge for many-body\nmethods due to their dense spectrum of nearly degenerate spin states. Our\nresults reveal accurate resolution of low-lying spin states and spin gaps in\n[Fe$_2$S$_2$] and [Fe$_4$S$_4$] clusters, offering new insights into their\nelectronic structures. In sum, these findings establish SAAM as a robust,\nhyperparameter-free standard for spin-adapted NNQMC, particularly for strongly\ncorrelated systems."}

However, for the (1-x)Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-xPbTiO3 solid\nsolution system this information is contradictory. Different\ncomposition-temperature phase diagrams have been reported for this system in\nliterature based on the investigations of single crystals and ceramics using\nvarious experimental techniques. In this work we apply polarized light\nmicroscopy (PLM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and dielectric spectroscopy to study\nthe crystal structure and phase transitions in the\n0.68Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.32PbTiO3 single crystal. We confirm the monoclinic MB\nsymmetry (space group Cm) of the room-temperature phase. According to PLM, it\ntransforms with increasing temperature into a triclinic (Tr) phase rather than\nthe previously reported monoclinic MC or tetragonal phase. XRD data are\nconsistent with the presence of Tr phase. The Tr phase transforms to the\nmonoclinic MC (Pm) phase and then to the cubic phase. Ergodic relaxor behavior\nis observed above the Curie temperature. The unit cell in the MC phase is\npseudotetragonal with the lattice parameters a = b < c and small monoclinic\nangle. In the MB phase the direction of spontaneous polarization is temperature\nindependent and close to the <111> pseudocubic direction. In the Tr and MC\nphases it changes with temperature so that near the Curie point it is close to\n[001] axis. No significant anomalies in the dielectric properties or changes in\nthe domain structure are observed at the MB to Tr and Tr to MC phase\ntransitions. The domain structure changes dramatically when the temperature\nvaries within the Tr phase, causing a sharp change in birefringence."}

The A-AFM KAgF$_3$ presents distinct altermagnetic responses,\nincluding: (i) prominent anomalous transport effects, such as anomalous Hall\nconductivity (AHC), anomalous Nernst conductivity (ANC), and thermal anomalous\nHall conductivity (TAHC); and (ii) strong magneto-optical responses, manifested\nthrough pronounced Kerr and Faraday effects.

In this study, we investigate the electronic\ntransport and switching behavior of single-crystalline\n$\\beta$-Na$_{0.33}$V$_2$O$_5$, focusing on low-frequency resistance noise\ndynamics of charge-order-driven resistive switching. Using electrical\ntransport, low frequency noise spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction, we probe\nelectron dynamics across the Na-ion-ordering (IO) and charge-ordering (CO)\ntransitions. Near room temperature, the weak temperature dependence of the\nnoise spectral density points to a dominance of nearest-neighbor polaron\nhopping. Below IO transition temperature (\\( T_{IO} \\sim 240 \\, \\text{K} \\)),\nstructural analysis reveals that Na-ions adopt a zig-zag occupancy pattern,\nbreaking the two-fold rotational symmetry and influencing the electronic ground\nstate. Subsequently, a sharp drop in resistance noise below the CO transition\ntemperature (\\( T_{CO} \\sim 125 \\, \\text{K} \\)) indicates the emergence of\ncorrelated electron behavior. Furthermore, application of sufficient electric\nfield leads to the destabilization of the CO state, and a transition to a\nhigh-conducting state.

The amplitudes of PES corrugations\non the order of 0.4 and 0.03 $\\mu$eV per atom of one layer, respectively, are\nobtained. The account of structural relaxation doubles this value for the (2,1)\npattern, while causing only minimal changes for the (3,1) pattern. We show that\ndifferent from aligned graphene layers, for moir\\'e patterns, PES minima and\nmaxima can switch their positions upon changing the interlayer distance. The\nPES shape is closely described by the first spatial Fourier harmonics both with\nand without account of structural relaxation.

Through large-scale data analysis, we statistically validate key\ndesign principles, confirming the superior performance of Donor-Acceptor-Donor\n(D-A-D) architectures and identifying an optimal D-A torsional angle range of\n\\qtyrange{50}{90}{\\degree} for efficient TADF. Principal Component Analysis\nreveals that the complex property space is fundamentally low-dimensional, with\nthree components capturing nearly \\qty{90}{\\percent} of the variance.

The findings, combined with the simplified operational procedure\nrelative to other conventional interacting spin-wave methodologies, suggest\nthat QSCHA is a promising tool for advancing research in quantum magnetism and\nspintronics."}

The performance of on-chip\ndevices based on thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) is presently limited by\nfabrication imperfections such as sidewall surface roughness and geometry\ninhomogeneities over the chip. Atomic layer etching (ALE) could potentially be\nused to overcome these difficulties. Although an isotropic ALE process for LN\nhas been reported, performing LN fabrication completely with ALE faces several\nchallenges, including the lack of a directional ALE process for pattern\ntransfer and the redeposition of involatile compounds. Here, we report a\ndirectional ALE process for LN consisting of sequential exposures of\nHBr/BCl$_3$/Ar plasma for surface modification and Ar plasma for removal. The\nHBr chemistry is found to decrease redeposition compared to F- and Cl-based\nplasmas, which we attribute to the higher vapor pressures of Br-based products.\nA grating pattern etched entirely by the process (total etch depth of 220 nm)\nexhibits no aspect ratio dependent etching (ARDE) down to the smallest tested\ngap of 150 nm, in contrast to ion milling in which ARDE manifests even at 300\nnm gaps for the same etch depth. The HBr plasma chemistry is also found to\nsupport an isotropic process consisting of sequential exposures of H$_2$ plasma\nand HBr/BCl$_3$/Ar plasma. These processes could be used together to perform\nthe complete fabrication process for TFLN devices, eliminating imperfections\narising from ion milling."}

We argue that these conclusions were based on static,\nperturbative approaches that overlooked essential time-dependent and\nnonperturbative electron-lattice physics. In fact ``phonons'' are not the best\ntarget for discussion, just like ``photons'' are not the best way to think\nabout Maxwell's equations. Quantum optics connects photons and\nelectromagnetism, as developed 60 years ago by Glauber and others. We have been\ndeveloping the parallel world of quantum acoustics. Far from being only of\nacademic interest, the new tools are rapidly exposing the secrets of the\nstrange metals, revealing strong vibronic (vibration-electronic) interactions\nplaying a crucial role forming polarons and charge density waves, linear-in-$T$\nresistivity at the Planckian rate over thousands of degrees, resolution of the\nDrude peak infrared anomaly, and the absence of a $T^4$ low-temperature\nresistivity rise in 2D systems, and of a Mott-Ioffe-Regel resistivity\nsaturation. We derive Planckian transport, polarons, CDWs, and pseudogaps from\nthe Fr\\\"ohlich model. The ``new physics'' has been hiding in this model all\nalong, in the right parameter regime, if it is treated nonperturbatively. In\nthe course of this work we have uncovered the generalization of Anderson\nlocalization to dynamic media: a universal Planckian diffusion emerges, a\n``ghost'' of Anderson localization. Planckian diffusion is clearly defined and\nis more fundamental than the popular but elusive, model dependent concept of\n``Planckian speed limit''."}
