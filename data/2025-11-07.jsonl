This research\naddresses this gap by proposing two novel enforcement methods: (i) a\nleast-squares optimization with non-negativity rectification (NNR) and small\npositive value avoidance (SPVA), and (ii) an iterative enforcement algorithm.\nTo ensure consistency across different discretization levels, this work also\nintroduces the multi-node surface model relations to formalize the connection\nbetween sub-face, face, and node representations of view factors and REFs. A\nsimple case study demonstrates a substantial reduction in mean absolute error\n(MAE): the least-squares method achieves an 81% MAE reduction, while the\niterative method offers the best balance of accuracy (56% MAE reduction) and\ncomputational efficiency. A second case study shows that including diffuse\nreflections decreases the steady-state temperature of a plate by $4^{\\circ}C$,\nreinforcing that reflected radiation reduces net absorption. This work\nintroduces and validates computationally efficient methods for integrating\ndiffuse reflectivity into space thermal analyses and for consistently coupling\nmulti-node surface radiative models. The results enable more accurate and\nrobust thermal predictions for spacecraft systems."}

We study two families of bilayer models with distinct internal\nsymmetries and, hence, different phase diagram topologies. A traditional\nbilayer model in which the interlayer interaction is Heisenberg so that the two\nlayers can exchange spin (and energy) with each other, making it possible to\nachieve a simple dimerized valence bond liquid-like state. The resulting phase\ndiagram is rich with N\\'eel, valence bond solid and simple dimer phases, and\nboth first-order and continuous transitions, which we demonstrate are\nconsistent with the conventional Landau theory of order parameters. In the\nsecond family of models in which the layers can exchange only energy but no\nspin (reminiscent of the Ashkin-Teller coupling), the simple dimer state cannot\noccur. The phase diagrams reveal a number of phase transitions that are\naccessed for the first time. We find that the phase transition between N\\'eel\nand VBS is first order in both the spin-spin and energy-energy coupled models,\nalthough they have strikingly distinct finite-size scaling behavior and that\nthe transition from VBS to dimer in the spin-spin coupling model deviates from\nthe expected scenario of an XY model with dangerously irrelevant four-fold\nanisotropy."}

Precisely for n=1 and 3, and at variance with the n=0\nand 2 cases (whose numerical exponents are consistent with non-renormalization\nof the vertex), numerical strong coupling exponent values are obtained which\nsuggest vertex renormalization, akin to that reported for the celebrated\nconserved KPZ equation.
