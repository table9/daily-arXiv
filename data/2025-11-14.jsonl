Hamed Majedi"], "title": "Microwave Dressed States and Vacuum Fluctuations in a Superconducting Condensate", "comment": null, "summary": "Microwave dressed states are found to emerge within the superconducting condensate when coupled to a quantized electromagnetic field due to photon-Cooper pair entanglement. The renormalized energy separation between these states exceeds the prediction of BCS theory, with the enhancement depending on the number of photons and also arising from electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations. Our work introduces an equilibrium quantum model of microwave-enhanced superconductivity, expanding the theoretical description beyond Eliashberg's non-equilibrium theory. We further demonstrate that the superconducting condensate exerts a back-action on the electromagnetic field, suppressing electric field fluctuations, including those from the vacuum state. This result is consistent with Glauber and Lewenstein's field quantization in dielectric media."}

Includes Supplementary Information (3 figures, 4 tables)", "summary": "The origin of the four-fold Tc amplification in A_xFe_{2-y}Se_2 (>30 K) compared to FeSe (8 K) remains a central puzzle, complicated by a debate over the true superconducting (SC) parent phase--the I4/m (245) insulating matrix or a supposed I4/mmm metallic phase. Here, we resolve this ambiguity by identifying a novel \"stripe-type orthorhombic phase\" as the true parent phase of the high-Tc state, whose diffraction signature is the d2 peaks. Through decisive experiments, we demonstrate that this d2 parent phase is not intrinsically superconducting. Instead, superconductivity emerges only after this stripe phase undergoes a subsequent structural distortion, the definitive signature of which is the asymmetric broadening of the d1 main peaks. Our findings establish that the d2 peaks signal the formation of the parent phase, while the broadening of d1 peaks signals the transition into the superconducting state. This discovery of a two-step transition--formation of a stripe parent phase, followed by a superconducting distortion--provides a new mechanism for Tc amplification via controlled heterogeneity."}

Although it is common to treat the superconducting component as a mere Cooper-pair reservoir, it was recently pointed out that such an approximation breaks down in the presence of driving, due to the emergence of level broadening. Here, we go beyond these recent works and prescribe how to construct the Floquet topological invariants for such driven hybrids. Specifically, we propose to first obtain the midgap quasi-energy spectra by including the hermitian part of the semiconductor's self-energy and, subsequently, read out the respective level broadenings by projecting the anti-hermitian part of the self-energy onto the quasi-energy eigenvectors. We exemplify our approach for a Rashba nanowire coupled to a superconductor and a time-dependent Zeeman field. Using our method, we obtain the Floquet band structure, the respective level broadenings, and the topological invariants. Our analysis reinforces the need to properly account for the self-energy, and corroborates that broadening effects can hinder the observation of the Floquet topological phases and especially of those harboring Majorana $π$ modes."}

Furthermore, the code has been parallelized for CPUs with MPI, and GPU computing has been added using CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture). For the latter, symbolic expressions are compiled into optimized CUDA kernels, allowing large-scale simulations to execute entirely on the GPU. For large systems ($32,768^2$ in 2D and $1,024^3$ in 3D with double precision), speedups up to $\\sim \\!\\!1,000 \\times$ were obtained compared to the first version of SymPhas using multi-threaded CPU execution on a single system.

This is especially true in 1+1 dimensions, where such theories have an infinite-dimensional parameter space induced by their conformal symmetry. We reveal the associated quantum geometry by considering finite systems driven by time-dependent conformal transformations. For small deformations, perturbation theory predicts absorption rates and linear responses that are intrinsically related to components of the quantum geometric tensor. For arbitrarily large but adiabatic deformations, we show that periodic drives give rise to nontrivial return amplitudes involving the quantum metric, beyond the familiar leading order that only features a Berry phase. Our field-theoretic findings are universal, comprising general relations between measurable quantities and quantum geometry that only depend on the central charge of the conformal symmetry. This is supported by both analytical results for quantum dynamics under certain Floquet drives, and numerical simulations of gapless lattice models."}

Meanwhile, state space model (e.g., Mamba) has recently emerged as a promising mechanism for long sequence modeling and has achieved remarkable results in various language and vision tasks. However, towards molecular ground-state conformation prediction, exploiting Mamba to understand molecular structure is underexplored. To this end, we strive to design a generic and efficient framework with Mamba to capture critical components. In general, molecular structure could be considered to consist of three elements, i.e., atom types, atom positions, and connections between atoms. Thus, considering the three elements, an approach of Mamba-driven multi-perspective structural understanding (MPSU-Mamba) is proposed to localize molecular ground-state conformation. Particularly, for complex and diverse molecules, three different kinds of dedicated scanning strategies are explored to construct a comprehensive perception of corresponding molecular structures. And a bright-channel guided mechanism is defined to discriminate the critical conformation-related atom information. Experimental results on QM9 and Molecule3D datasets indicate that MPSU-Mamba significantly outperforms existing methods. Furthermore, we observe that for the case of few training samples, MPSU-Mamba still achieves superior performance, demonstrating that our method is indeed beneficial for understanding molecular structures."}

Boron powders served as the starting material, and the intense thermal gradients during synthesis led to incomplete chemical reactions. As a result, the surface of the resulting nanoparticles is covered with a thin layer of sassolite, followed by boron oxides, beneath which lies a boron nitride shell. The subsurface contains boron-rich nitride phases, while the core consists of elemental boron. For reference, commercial platelet-like h-BN powders from the \"Chempur\" company were also analyzed. Initially, all synthesized nanopowders displayed pronounced electrostatic charging, photoluminescence (PL), and paramagnetic activity, attributable to high surface defect densities and unsaturated chemical bonds. However, after two years of exposure to ambient air, these nanopowders exhibited complete loss of electrostatic charging, absence of photoluminescence (PL), and disappearance of the characteristic single EPR resonance line. Similarly, commercial h-BN nanopowder from the \"Chempur\" company does not exhibit a single EPR resonance line too. FTIR analysis revealed progressive surface oxidation and hydroxylation of this powder, suggesting that atmospheric moisture and oxygen effectively passivated defect states. These findings underscore the critical role of surface chemistry in governing the electrostatic, optical, and magnetic behavior of BN-based nanomaterials and highlight the importance of defect stabilization for preserving functional properties over time."}

The exponential of the free energy difference is expressed in terms of ensemble averages of the Hamiltonian of mean force (HMF) shift and the chi-squared divergence between the initial and final marginal probability distribution of the open system. A trajectory counterpart of this relation follows from an asymptotic equilibration postulate, which treats relaxation to the final stationary canonical state as a boundary condition rather than as a consequence of constraints on the driven dynamics. In the frozen-coupling regime, the HMF shift reduces to the bare-system Hamiltonian shift, yielding a clear heat-work decomposition. The Jarzynski equality (JE) is recovered under the assumption of Hamiltonian dynamics for the combined system. We validate the theory on a dissipative, phase-space-compressing drive followed by an underdamped Langevin relaxation, where the assumptions underlying the JE break down, whereas our equality reproduces the exact free energy differences."}

They have gained significant interest due to their potential as alternative energy resources and their applications in gas storage, transportation, and carbon sequestration. However, the fundamental mechanisms governing their formation, especially the influence of gas bubbles, remain poorly understood. In this study, we use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to examine how methane nanobubble size modulates hydrate formation in supercooled water. Nanobubbles of different sizes are generated by modulating the methane concentration in a methane-water mixture during equilibration under high-temperature and low-pressure conditions, followed by quenching to low temperature and high pressure to induce gas hydrate nucleation and subsequent growth. The simulations reveal a strong correlation between nanobubble size and the extent of hydrate formation. Specifically, the extent of hydrate formation increases with bubble size in the small-to-intermediate regime. However, beyond a critical bubble size threshold, the hydrate formation efficiency declines. The work provides new molecular-level insight into how nanobubble size modulates gas hydrate nucleation and growth dynamics."}

A stochastic thermodynamics framework is employed to analyze a fluctuation theorem for the first-passage time of the observable process under nonequilibrium steady-state conditions. Based on a generic kinetic model, we demonstrate that, along first-passage trajectories, entropy production remains constant when the changes in stochastic entropy and free energy of the machine are balanced, which corresponds to zero net hidden flux through the initial state manifold. Under this condition, which we define quite generally, this first-passage time fluctuation theorem can be established, with its violation serving as an experimentally detectable signature of hidden detailed balance breaking (which we subsequently characterize). In addition, using an enzymatic model, we show that the violation of our first-passage time fluctuation theorem can be thought of as a consequence of the breakdown of local detailed balance in the steps linking coarse-grained states that correspond to the initial and intermediate state manifolds. In the absence of hidden current, the fluctuation theorem is restored, and a mesoscopic local detailed balance condition can be established, which has implications for the thermodynamic analysis of driven, coarse-grained systems. This work sheds significant light on the unique connections between stochastic thermodynamic quantities and kinetic measurements in complex cooperative networks."}

For disordered alloys, due to the lack of periodicity, it has been challenging to calculate and study their material properties. Special quasi-random structure (SQS) method has been developed and widely used to treat this issue by matching averaged atomic correlation functions to those of ideal random alloys, enabling accurate predictions of macroscopic material properties such as total energy and volume. However, in AxB1-x alloys, statistically allowed local concentration fluctuations can give rise to defect-like minority configurations, such as bulk-like AX or BX regions in the extreme, which could strongly affect calculation of some of the material properties such as semiconductor bandgap, if it is not defined properly, leading to significant discrepancies between theory and experiment. In this work, taking the bandgap as an example, we demonstrate that the calculated alloy bandgap can be significantly underestimated in standard SQS calculations when the SQS cell size is increased to improve the structural model and the bandgap is defined conventionally as the energy difference between the lowest unoccupied state and the highest occupied state, because the rare event motifs can lead to wavefunction localization and become the dominant factor in determining the \"bandgap\", contrary to experiment. To be consistent with experiment, we show that the bandgap of the alloy should be extracted from the majority configurations using a density-of-states fitting (DOSF) method. This DOSF approach resolves the long-standing issue of calculating electronic structure of disordered semiconductor alloys. Similar approaches should also be developed to treat material properties that depends on localized alloy wavefunctions."}

Here, we systematically investigate the quantum conductance corrections of spin-polarized 2DEGs formed at the interfaces between two insulating oxides, ferromagnetic EuTiO3 (ETO) films and (111)-oriented KTaO3 (KTO) substrates. The anomalous Hall effect and hysteretic magnetoresistance provide clear evidence for long-range ferromagnetic order in the 2DEGs, which could be attributed to interfacial Eu doping in combination with the magnetic proximity effect of the ETO layer. The breaking of time-reversal symmetry by ferromagnetism in the 2DEGs, and with the assistance of spin-orbit coupling effect, gives rise to a nontrivial Berry phase. This results in a competition between weak localization (WL) and weak antilocalization (WAL) in the quantum transport of Dirac-like fermions at the KTO (111) interfaces.

While flow-based models are fast, they often produce geometrically inaccurate structures, as they have difficulty capturing the multimodal distributions of molecular conformations. In contrast, denoising diffusion models are more accurate but suffer from slow sampling, a limitation attributed to sub-optimal integration between diffusion dynamics and SE(3)-equivariant architectures. To address this, we propose VEDA, a unified SE(3)-equivariant framework that combines variance-exploding diffusion with annealing to efficiently generate conformationally accurate 3D molecular structures. Specifically, our key technical contributions include: (1) a VE schedule that enables noise injection functionally analogous to simulated annealing, improving 3D accuracy and reducing relaxation energy; (2) a novel preconditioning scheme that reconciles the coordinate-predicting nature of SE(3)-equivariant networks with a residual-based diffusion objective, and (3) a new arcsin-based scheduler that concentrates sampling in critical intervals of the logarithmic signal-to-noise ratio. On the QM9 and GEOM-DRUGS datasets, VEDA matches the sampling efficiency of flow-based models, achieving state-of-the-art valency stability and validity with only 100 sampling steps. More importantly, VEDA's generated structures are remarkably stable, as measured by their relaxation energy during GFN2-xTB optimization. The median energy change is only 1.72 kcal/mol, significantly lower than the 32.3 kcal/mol from its architectural baseline, SemlaFlow. Our framework demonstrates that principled integration of VE diffusion with SE(3)-equivariant architectures can achieve both high chemical accuracy and computational efficiency."}

We combine density functional theory (DFT) and finite-element magnetostatics to bridge these scales in Ni-Mn-Ga. DFT calculations on supercells containing planar APBs show that the lowest-energy configuration comprises a pair of parallel APBs enclosing a nanoscale region - only three Mn-Ga atomic layers thick - whose magnetization is antiparallel to the surrounding matrix due to strong antiferromagnetic exchange across each APB (in contrast to ferromagnetic coupling in bulk martensite). According to our magnetostatic finite element model, this thin region with antiparallel magnetization generates the characteristic MFM contrast extending approx. 100 nm from the APB pair. When the APBs are further apart than 50 nm, dipole-dipole penalties outweigh exchange gains, preventing formation of an extended antiparallel domain, in agreement with experimental evidence. These results identify APB pairs as the origin of the observed MFM contrast and offer an interpretation of the modest strengths of domain-wall pinning by APBs, informing the design of magnetic shape-memory alloys with tailored coercivity."}

In most 2D FET studies, the gate overlaps with the source and drain electrodes, allowing the gate potential to modulate the 2D semiconductor underneath the electrodes and ultimately effect carrier transport at the metal-semiconductor interface - a phenomenon known as contact gating. Here, a symmetric dual-gate structure with independently addressable back and top gates is employed to elucidate the impact of contact gating on a monolayer MoS2 channel. Unlike previous studies of contact gating, this symmetric structure enables quantification of the phenomena through a contact gating factor, revealing a 2x enhancement in on-state performance in long-channel devices. At scaled dimensions (50 nm channel and 30 nm contact length), the influence of contact gating becomes amplified, yielding a 5x increase in on-state performance and a 70% reduction in transfer length when contact gating is present. Since many reported record-performance 2D FETs employ back-gate geometries that inherently include contact gating, these results establish contact gating as a critical and previously underappreciated determinant of device performance in the 2D FET landscape."}

Electron paramagnetic resonance confirms nearly a tenfold decrease in Na-related donor states, resulting in the lowest doping level reported in Si clathrates to date. Following passivation, the integrated photoluminescence intensity increases by a factor of 40, accompanied by a blue shift of the main emission peak, consistent with a transition closer to the intrinsic band edge. A new emission peak at 930 nm, attributed to hydrogen-related recombination centers, also appears. These improvements remain stable up to 400 oC. Altogether, this work establishes hydrogen passivation as a viable strategy for enhancing light emission in Si clathrates and opens a new pathway toward their application in Si-based light-emitting diodes and other direct-bandgap optoelectronic devices."}

Here we report on the dynamics of charge density wave (CDW) in NbSe$_{3}$ nanowires induced by surface acoustic waves (SAWs). Clear peaks in the differential resistance were observed at the resonant frequency of the SAW device. These peaks known as Shapiro steps are typically observed by applying an rf current to NbSe$_{3}$ nanowires. We found that the Shapiro steps induced by SAWs show several distinct features from the ones induced by an rf current. Our detailed study revealed that a strain induced by SAWs plays a significant role in the Shapiro steps. The result clearly demonstrates the importance of the strain in CDW materials and paves the way for strain-induced device applications."}

Rather than a single \"average coverage\" site, the working interface is a potential-gated statistical ensemble of 34 interconverting adsorbate motifs between -0.10 and -1.00 V (vs. SHE). Potential-driven shifts in motif populations produce a volcano-shaped activity trend peaking at -0.70 V, where the site-normalized turnover frequency reaches 0.015 s-1 with nearly 100% Faradaic efficiency to ammonia. The activation barriers across >150 transition states collapse into a single linear relationship with the excess charge on the reacting Cu atoms (ΔqCu), identifying interfacial charge redistribution as a unifying kinetic descriptor. The maximum activity arises not from uniform moderate coverage but from a 2NO/2NH2 quadrilateral microensemble that tunes ΔqCu to an intermediate value, simultaneously lowering the N-O cleavage and N-H formation barriers. Reconceptualizing \"coverage\" as an ensemble of local microenvironments decouples thermodynamic stability from catalytic productivity. This perspective furnishes a parameter-free strategy by controlling motif populations and interfacial charge via the potential to program high-coverage electrocatalysis beyond the NO3RR."}

In a frustrated bosonic model on the honeycomb lattice in the cluster-charging regime at fractional filling, this mechanism protects a conserved global quantum number, the sublattice polarization $\\tilde{N} = N_A - N_B$.

Based on hetero- thin film architectures, such devices can exhibit a surprising power generation characteristic which is non-additive between the two energy-scavenging effects. For example, when the thermoelectric and piezoelectric effects are strongly coupled by their proximal fields, the efficacy of energy scavenging can be made to exceed that of the two effects independently. In this review of such effects, a basic coupled heat engine model is shown to provide insight into the origins of synergistic power generation. These models however, suggest the emergence of other combined thermodynamic properties such as the kinetic Peltier-Caloric Effect (PCE) traced to Onsager reciprocity.

The exponential of the free energy difference is expressed in terms of ensemble averages of the Hamiltonian of mean force (HMF) shift and the chi-squared divergence between the initial and final marginal probability distribution of the open system. A trajectory counterpart of this relation follows from an asymptotic equilibration postulate, which treats relaxation to the final stationary canonical state as a boundary condition rather than as a consequence of constraints on the driven dynamics. In the frozen-coupling regime, the HMF shift reduces to the bare-system Hamiltonian shift, yielding a clear heat-work decomposition. The Jarzynski equality (JE) is recovered under the assumption of Hamiltonian dynamics for the combined system. We validate the theory on a dissipative, phase-space-compressing drive followed by an underdamped Langevin relaxation, where the assumptions underlying the JE break down, whereas our equality reproduces the exact free energy differences."}

These fabricated devices were tested at both room and cryogenic temperatures to characterize their UV-detection performance in a custom test stand using a 365 nm UV LED source. We observe a higher UV-induced voltage signal for Sample II in comparison to Sample I at both temperature regimes. Grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) measurements showed approximately 40% higher residual stress in Sample II than in Sample I. A higher residual stress suggests a higher induced piezopotential in Sample II, explaining the enhancement in the UV-induced signal. Our results demonstrate that through appropriate in-device stress engineering, UV photoinduced signals can be enhanced, increasing detector sensitivity.

Remarkably, we observe the emergence of pronounced insulating states at charge neutrality point (CNP), full and half moiré fillings in lattice-aligned armchair SWNT/hBN heterostructures by low-temperature electrical transport measurements. In strong contrast, armchair SWNT devices without hBN alignment do not show any of these insulating behaviors, providing compelling evidence for the significant 1D moiré effect. Our density functional theory (DFT) and tight-binding calculations reveal that synergetic nanotube partial flattening and in-plane lattice reconstruction at 1D moiré interface expand the most stable AB' stacking regions (carbon on top of boron) and open sizable band gaps at both CNP and full moiré fillings at the single-particle level. Our one-body theory predicts no band gaps at half moiré fillings, suggesting that electron correlation and/or electron-phonon interaction may give rise to these emergent insulating behaviors in our 1D moiré systems.

Here we combine inelastic neutron scattering, Raman spectroscopy, and ab initio calculations to study the evolution of soft polar phonons across the strain-induced ferroelectric transition in STO and KTO. We find that the modes remain underdamped and at nonzero energy, consistent with a first-order quantum phase transition. We also reveal a strong violation of the well-known Lyddane-Sachs-Teller relation between the phonon energies and static dielectric permittivities in insulating KTO and STO, which is not captured by ab initio calculations and points to the presence of slow mesoscale fluctuations induced by long-range interactions. In metallic STO, we uncover a first-order transition at a remarkably low critical stress, in qualitative agreement with recent theoretical predictions.

We compute the longitudinal conductivity and quantum Hall conductivity using the Kubo formalism based on linear response theory. We find that the usual Shubnikov-de Haas oscillation in longitudinal conductivity appears that can be made purely spin polarized by adjusting the Fermi level suitably. We observe a beating pattern in the Shubnikov-de Hass oscillation in the intra-spin branches, which arises due to the superposition of Shubnikov-de Hass oscillations corresponding to two bands in each spin branch. This is contrary to the conventional Rashba system, where such beating is due to the superposition of Shubnikov-de Hass oscillations corresponding to the two spin-branches.

A stochastic thermodynamics framework is employed to analyze a fluctuation theorem for the first-passage time of the observable process under nonequilibrium steady-state conditions. Based on a generic kinetic model, we demonstrate that, along first-passage trajectories, entropy production remains constant when the changes in stochastic entropy and free energy of the machine are balanced, which corresponds to zero net hidden flux through the initial state manifold. Under this condition, which we define quite generally, this first-passage time fluctuation theorem can be established, with its violation serving as an experimentally detectable signature of hidden detailed balance breaking (which we subsequently characterize). In addition, using an enzymatic model, we show that the violation of our first-passage time fluctuation theorem can be thought of as a consequence of the breakdown of local detailed balance in the steps linking coarse-grained states that correspond to the initial and intermediate state manifolds. In the absence of hidden current, the fluctuation theorem is restored, and a mesoscopic local detailed balance condition can be established, which has implications for the thermodynamic analysis of driven, coarse-grained systems.

At the nanoscale, multistate charge retention was directly visualised using atomic force microscopy, confirming the robustness of individual states beyond macroscopic measurements. As a proof of concept, the capacitor was integrated into a high-pass filter, where the programmed capacitive states shift the cutoff frequency over 5~kHz, establishing circuit-level viability. This work demonstrates the feasibility of CMOS-compatible, non-volatile, analogue memory based on ferroelectric HfZrO, paving the way for adaptive RF filters, reconfigurable analogue front-ends, and neuromorphic electronics."}

Diamagnets and paramagnets lack spontaneous long-range order, whereas ordered magnets develop such order below their Curie or Néel temperature and support single spin-wave excitations (magnons). Magnons have found applications in radio-frequency technologies and computation, magneto-optics, and foundational quantum experiments. Above the Curie/Néel temperature, long-range order is lost and the material transitions to a paramagnetic phase, with localised spin alignment in small patches, producing paramagnons with only short-range propagation. Here we show that long-range coherence is preserved in the organic free radical 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-oxyl above the Néel temperature using all-electrical propagating spin-wave spectroscopy in external magnetic fields.

We combine density functional theory (DFT) and finite-element magnetostatics to bridge these scales in Ni-Mn-Ga. DFT calculations on supercells containing planar APBs show that the lowest-energy configuration comprises a pair of parallel APBs enclosing a nanoscale region - only three Mn-Ga atomic layers thick - whose magnetization is antiparallel to the surrounding matrix due to strong antiferromagnetic exchange across each APB (in contrast to ferromagnetic coupling in bulk martensite). According to our magnetostatic finite element model, this thin region with antiparallel magnetization generates the characteristic MFM contrast extending approx. 100 nm from the APB pair. When the APBs are further apart than 50 nm, dipole-dipole penalties outweigh exchange gains, preventing formation of an extended antiparallel domain, in agreement with experimental evidence. These results identify APB pairs as the origin of the observed MFM contrast and offer an interpretation of the modest strengths of domain-wall pinning by APBs, informing the design of magnetic shape-memory alloys with tailored coercivity."}

Here, we resolve the operando Cu(111) electrolyte interface for nitrate-to-ammonia electroreduction (NO3RR) via a multiscale modeling framework accelerated by a coverage-aware machine-learning potential. Rather than a single \"average coverage\" site, the working interface is a potential-gated statistical ensemble of 34 interconverting adsorbate motifs between -0.10 and -1.00 V (vs. SHE). Potential-driven shifts in motif populations produce a volcano-shaped activity trend peaking at -0.70 V, where the site-normalized turnover frequency reaches 0.015 s-1 with nearly 100% Faradaic efficiency to ammonia. The activation barriers across >150 transition states collapse into a single linear relationship with the excess charge on the reacting Cu atoms (ΔqCu), identifying interfacial charge redistribution as a unifying kinetic descriptor. The maximum activity arises not from uniform moderate coverage but from a 2NO/2NH2 quadrilateral microensemble that tunes ΔqCu to an intermediate value, simultaneously lowering the N-O cleavage and N-H formation barriers. Reconceptualizing \"coverage\" as an ensemble of local microenvironments decouples thermodynamic stability from catalytic productivity. This perspective furnishes a parameter-free strategy by controlling motif populations and interfacial charge via the potential to program high-coverage electrocatalysis beyond the NO3RR."}

Hydrogen has long been used to improve the optoelectronic quality of conventional Si, yet its role in clathrate structures remains unexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that hydrogen (deuterium) can be incorporated into type II Si clathrate framework using remote plasma treatment. This process leads to the formation of NaD and SiD complexes, which significantly reduce both the Na donor density and dangling bond defects. Electron paramagnetic resonance confirms nearly a tenfold decrease in Na-related donor states, resulting in the lowest doping level reported in Si clathrates to date. Following passivation, the integrated photoluminescence intensity increases by a factor of 40, accompanied by a blue shift of the main emission peak, consistent with a transition closer to the intrinsic band edge. A new emission peak at 930 nm, attributed to hydrogen-related recombination centers, also appears. These improvements remain stable up to 400 oC. Altogether, this work establishes hydrogen passivation as a viable strategy for enhancing light emission in Si clathrates and opens a new pathway toward their application in Si-based light-emitting diodes and other direct-bandgap optoelectronic devices."}

Traditional phenomenological models, which are derived through empirical fitting, often lack generalizability and rely heavily on expert intuition and predefined functional forms. In this work, we propose a graph-based equation discovery framework for the automated discovery of constitutive laws directly from multisource experimental data. This framework expresses equations as directed graphs, where nodes represent operators and variables, edges denote computational relations, and edge features encode parametric dependencies. This enables the generation and optimization of free-form symbolic expressions with undetermined material-specific parameters. Through the proposed framework, we have discovered new constitutive models for strain-rate effects in alloy steel materials and the deformation behavior of lithium metal. Compared with conventional empirical models, these new models exhibit compact analytical structures and achieve higher accuracy. The proposed graph-based equation discovery framework provides a generalizable and interpretable approach for data-driven scientific modelling, particularly in contexts where traditional empirical formulations are inadequate for representing complex physical phenomena."}

This has led to a body of work creating hybrid thermo/piezo-electric generator devices (T/PEGs) in which the two effects become thermodynamically entangled. Based on hetero- thin film architectures, such devices can exhibit a surprising power generation characteristic which is non-additive between the two energy-scavenging effects. For example, when the thermoelectric and piezoelectric effects are strongly coupled by their proximal fields, the efficacy of energy scavenging can be made to exceed that of the two effects independently. In this review of such effects, a basic coupled heat engine model is shown to provide insight into the origins of synergistic power generation. These models however, suggest the emergence of other combined thermodynamic properties such as the kinetic Peltier-Caloric Effect (PCE) traced to Onsager reciprocity. The recent observation of this effect in multicomponent systems is confirmation of the limited perspective of thermodynamic separability."}

In this work, we investigated atomic-scale defects in a two-dimensional silver monolayer intercalated at the interface between epitaxial graphene and SiC using a scanning tunneling microscope. Distinct dark and bright defects are identified as in-plane vacancies and substitutional impurities within the silver monolayer, each hosting a localized electronic state induced solely by the defect. Remarkably, under excitation of tunneling electrons assisted by a negative bias voltage, the defects can hop inelastically which is reminiscent of the hydrogen switching in the cavity of an organic molecule. The hopping can be reversibly controlled by the scanning tunneling microscope tip, allowing the defects to function as atomic-scale two-level conductance switches. Defect hopping further allows us to gain a deeper understanding of their origins and the relationship between dark and bright defect species. This study constitutes a pathway toward understanding and controlling defects in two-dimensional metals with atomic precision, revealing previously unexplored dynamic behavior with potential applications in nanoelectronics."}

In most 2D FET studies, the gate overlaps with the source and drain electrodes, allowing the gate potential to modulate the 2D semiconductor underneath the electrodes and ultimately effect carrier transport at the metal-semiconductor interface - a phenomenon known as contact gating. Here, a symmetric dual-gate structure with independently addressable back and top gates is employed to elucidate the impact of contact gating on a monolayer MoS2 channel. Unlike previous studies of contact gating, this symmetric structure enables quantification of the phenomena through a contact gating factor, revealing a 2x enhancement in on-state performance in long-channel devices. At scaled dimensions (50 nm channel and 30 nm contact length), the influence of contact gating becomes amplified, yielding a 5x increase in on-state performance and a 70% reduction in transfer length when contact gating is present. Since many reported record-performance 2D FETs employ back-gate geometries that inherently include contact gating, these results establish contact gating as a critical and previously underappreciated determinant of device performance in the 2D FET landscape."}

One such anomaly, known as the \"ballooning effect\" is characterized by an unexpected non-monotonic increase in the write error rate (WER) with increase in STT current at specific current pulse durations. In this study, we systematically investigate the role of the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) on such WER anomaly using micromagnetic simulations of 20 nm and 50 nm magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). We show that DMI promotes incoherent magnetization reversal, prolongs the switching time and creates intermediate multidomain states that result in incomplete reversal. At high DMI values, these states persist even under large switching current densities, reproducing ballooning-like anomalies reported experimentally. In contrast, longer pulses overcome these effects by allowing the system sufficient time to reach a stable state. Our findings show that interfacial DMI can play a role in the ballooning effect and point to interfacial engineering as a practical strategy for improving the reliability of next-generation STT-MRAM."}

We observe a higher UV-induced voltage signal for Sample II in comparison to Sample I at both temperature regimes. Grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) measurements showed approximately 40% higher residual stress in Sample II than in Sample I. A higher residual stress suggests a higher induced piezopotential in Sample II, explaining the enhancement in the UV-induced signal. Our results demonstrate that through appropriate in-device stress engineering, UV photoinduced signals can be enhanced, increasing detector sensitivity.

Replacing Zn with Mn in Cu2MnSnS4 (CMTS) mitigates these limitations, improving cation ordering and electronic quality while maintaining favorable optical properties. Yet, despite its potential, CMTS remains largely unexplored in multi-absorber configurations-only one prior study has reported a CMTS-based dual-absorber device. In this work, we present a comprehensive numerical investigation of a CMTS-FeSi2 dual-absorber thin-film solar cell using the one-dimensional solar cell capacitance simulator (SCAPS-1D). FeSi2, with its narrow band gap (0.87 eV) and strong near-infrared absorption, serves as an ideal bottom absorber to complement CMTS, enabling broader spectral utilization. The study systematically examines the effects of geometrical, electronic, and interfacial parameters on carrier transport, and overall device performance.

The structure comprises metallic stripes separated by regions containing a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG), forming a periodically modulated interface whose electromagnetic response is governed by the charge density between the stripes. In the unbiased state, the conductive 2DEG screens the incident terahertz field and suppresses excitation of guided modes.

The device switches at low voltages (3~V), with each state exhibiting long retention (10^5~s) and high endurance (10^6 cycles), ensuring reliable multi-level operation. At the nanoscale, multistate charge retention was directly visualised using atomic force microscopy, confirming the robustness of individual states beyond macroscopic measurements. As a proof of concept, the capacitor was integrated into a high-pass filter, where the programmed capacitive states shift the cutoff frequency over 5~kHz, establishing circuit-level viability.

In this work, we demonstrate that these ubiquitous ordinary lattice defects, though topologically trivial, can nonetheless serve as universal probes of the non-trivial topology of electronic Bloch bands, and any change in the local topological environment in an otherwise normal insulator in terms of mid-gap bound states in their vicinity. We theoretically establish these generic findings by implementing a minimal model Hamiltonian describing time-reversal symmetry breaking topological and normal insulators on a square lattice, fostering such point defects. The defect-bound mid-gap modes are also shown to be robust against weak point-like charge impurities. Furthermore, we showcase experimental observation of such bound states by embedding ordinary crystal defects in two-dimensional acoustic Chern lattices, where precision-controlled hopping amplitudes are implemented via active meta-atoms and Green's-function-based spectroscopy is used to reconstruct spectra and eigenstates. Our combined theory-experiment study establishes ordinary lattice defects as probes of topology that should be germane in crystals of any symmetry and dimension, raising the possibility of arresting localized Majorana modes near such defects in the bulk of topological superconductors and to emulate ordinary-defect-engineered topological devices."}

We demonstrate accurate parameter recovery in several benchmark systems-including Wegner's Ising gauge theory, $φ^4$ theory, Schwinger and Sine-Gordon models, and mixed spin-gauge systems, and show how iterating the procedure under coarse-graining reconstructs full non-perturbative renormalization-group flows. This gives direct access to phase boundaries, fixed points, and emergent interactions without relying on perturbation theory. We also address a realistic setting where full gauge configurations may be unavailable, and reformulate learning algorithms for multiple field theories so that they are recovered directly using observables such as correlations from scattering data or quantum simulators. We anticipate that our methodology will find widespread use in practical learning of field theories in strongly coupled regimes where analytical tools might fail."}

This has led to a body of work creating hybrid thermo/piezo-electric generator devices (T/PEGs) in which the two effects become thermodynamically entangled. Based on hetero- thin film architectures, such devices can exhibit a surprising power generation characteristic which is non-additive between the two energy-scavenging effects. For example, when the thermoelectric and piezoelectric effects are strongly coupled by their proximal fields, the efficacy of energy scavenging can be made to exceed that of the two effects independently. In this review of such effects, a basic coupled heat engine model is shown to provide insight into the origins of synergistic power generation. These models however, suggest the emergence of other combined thermodynamic properties such as the kinetic Peltier-Caloric Effect (PCE) traced to Onsager reciprocity.

The most intense Floquet mode emerges synchronously with the gyration mode after a common incubation delay which diverges at the scattering threshold. This delay is minimal when the drive is resonant with one of the first order azimuthal spin waves. It can be as short as 3 ns for the maximum investigated power.

Here, we resolve the operando Cu(111) electrolyte interface for nitrate-to-ammonia electroreduction (NO3RR) via a multiscale modeling framework accelerated by a coverage-aware machine-learning potential. Rather than a single \"average coverage\" site, the working interface is a potential-gated statistical ensemble of 34 interconverting adsorbate motifs between -0.10 and -1.00 V (vs. SHE). Potential-driven shifts in motif populations produce a volcano-shaped activity trend peaking at -0.70 V, where the site-normalized turnover frequency reaches 0.015 s-1 with nearly 100% Faradaic efficiency to ammonia. The activation barriers across >150 transition states collapse into a single linear relationship with the excess charge on the reacting Cu atoms (ΔqCu), identifying interfacial charge redistribution as a unifying kinetic descriptor. The maximum activity arises not from uniform moderate coverage but from a 2NO/2NH2 quadrilateral microensemble that tunes ΔqCu to an intermediate value, simultaneously lowering the N-O cleavage and N-H formation barriers. Reconceptualizing \"coverage\" as an ensemble of local microenvironments decouples thermodynamic stability from catalytic productivity. This perspective furnishes a parameter-free strategy by controlling motif populations and interfacial charge via the potential to program high-coverage electrocatalysis beyond the NO3RR."}

While data-driven methods have emerged as promising approaches for accelerating PF simulations, existing methods require extensive training data from numerous evolution trajectories, and their inherent black-box nature raises concerns about long-term prediction reliability. This work demonstrates, through examples of grain growth and spinodal decomposition, that a minimalist Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained with a remarkably small dataset even from a single small-scale simulation can achieve seamless scalability to larger systems and reliable long-term predictions far beyond the temporal range of the training data. The key insight of this work lies in revealing that the success of CNN-based models stems from the alignment between their inductive biases and the physical priors of phase-field simulations specifically, locality and spatiotemporal translation invariance. Through effective receptive field analysis, we verify that the model captures these essential properties during training. Therefore, from a reductionist perspective, the surrogate model essentially establishes a spatiotemporally invariant regression mapping between a grid point's local environment and its subsequent state. Further analysis of the model's feature space demonstrates that microstructural evolution effectively represents a continuous redistribution of a finite set of local environments. When the model has already encountered nearly all possible local environments in the early-stage training data, it can reliably generalize to much longer evolution timescales, regardless of the dramatic changes in global microstructural morphology."}

This framework expresses equations as directed graphs, where nodes represent operators and variables, edges denote computational relations, and edge features encode parametric dependencies. This enables the generation and optimization of free-form symbolic expressions with undetermined material-specific parameters. Through the proposed framework, we have discovered new constitutive models for strain-rate effects in alloy steel materials and the deformation behavior of lithium metal. Compared with conventional empirical models, these new models exhibit compact analytical structures and achieve higher accuracy.

As demonstrated, changes in the shape of the emission band of Yb3+ ions corresponding to the 2F5/2 -> 2F7/2 electronic transition, induced by the phase transition, enabled the design of a ratiometric thermometer with a maximum relative sensitivity (SR) of 3.1% K^-1 for LiYO2 doped with 10% Yb3+ and 1% Nd3+ at 290 K. In contrast, the temperature-dependent Yb3+ -> Nd3+ energy transfer facilitated the development of a lifetime-based thermometer with a maximum SR of 1.5% K^-1 for 20% Nd3+ at 378 K. In both approaches, tuning the Nd3+ concentration allowed modulation of both the sensitivity and the temperature at which the maximum SR occurred. This was achieved by shifting the phase transition temperature and increasing the probability of interionic energy transfer, respectively.\n  Notably, the temperature ranges corresponding to the maximum SR for the ratiometric and lifetime modes were distinct, effectively broadening the thermal operating window of the sensor. Additionally, it was shown that LiYO2 doped with Nd3+ and Yb3+ can also be used as a temperature sensor through the ratio of luminescence intensities recorded at two different time gates. Furthermore, the results confirmed that the phonon-assisted energy transfer process plays the dominant role in shaping the luminescence kinetics, surpassing the influence of the structural phase transition. Overall, this study identifies LiYO2:Nd3+,Yb3+ as a promising candidate for multimodal luminescent temperature sensing applications."}

Submitted to Materials Today Electronics", "summary": "Electric field-induced studies, including phase transition and polarization hysteresis, for ferroelectric HfO2 at the atomic scale are critical since they can largely affect its application in ferroelectric and dielectric devices. However, conventional first-principles approaches are computationally limited in capturing large-scale atomic dynamics under realistic field conditions. Here, to enable electric-field-driven molecular dynamics simulations, we develop a machine learning potential (MLP) tailored for HfO2, coupled with an in-situ Born effective charge (BEC) model. This framework enables us to capture key phenomena, including field-induced phase transitions, polarization switching, and strain-dependent dielectric responses, with high fidelity and computational efficiency. Notably, we reproduce hysteresis loops and phase transition barriers consistent with AIMD results and reveal possible electric-field-induced polarization activation in the monoclinic phase. Our approach offers a scalable and transferable tool for atomistic exploration of functional oxides and paves the way for data-driven design of ferroelectric devices."}

For disordered alloys, due to the lack of periodicity, it has been challenging to calculate and study their material properties. Special quasi-random structure (SQS) method has been developed and widely used to treat this issue by matching averaged atomic correlation functions to those of ideal random alloys, enabling accurate predictions of macroscopic material properties such as total energy and volume. However, in AxB1-x alloys, statistically allowed local concentration fluctuations can give rise to defect-like minority configurations, such as bulk-like AX or BX regions in the extreme, which could strongly affect calculation of some of the material properties such as semiconductor bandgap, if it is not defined properly, leading to significant discrepancies between theory and experiment. In this work, taking the bandgap as an example, we demonstrate that the calculated alloy bandgap can be significantly underestimated in standard SQS calculations when the SQS cell size is increased to improve the structural model and the bandgap is defined conventionally as the energy difference between the lowest unoccupied state and the highest occupied state, because the rare event motifs can lead to wavefunction localization and become the dominant factor in determining the \"bandgap\", contrary to experiment. To be consistent with experiment, we show that the bandgap of the alloy should be extracted from the majority configurations using a density-of-states fitting (DOSF) method. This DOSF approach resolves the long-standing issue of calculating electronic structure of disordered semiconductor alloys. Similar approaches should also be developed to treat material properties that depends on localized alloy wavefunctions."}

Here, we systematically investigate the quantum conductance corrections of spin-polarized 2DEGs formed at the interfaces between two insulating oxides, ferromagnetic EuTiO3 (ETO) films and (111)-oriented KTaO3 (KTO) substrates. The anomalous Hall effect and hysteretic magnetoresistance provide clear evidence for long-range ferromagnetic order in the 2DEGs, which could be attributed to interfacial Eu doping in combination with the magnetic proximity effect of the ETO layer. The breaking of time-reversal symmetry by ferromagnetism in the 2DEGs, and with the assistance of spin-orbit coupling effect, gives rise to a nontrivial Berry phase. This results in a competition between weak localization (WL) and weak antilocalization (WAL) in the quantum transport of Dirac-like fermions at the KTO (111) interfaces. Notably, this competitive behavior can be effectively tuned by optical gating via a photoexcitation-induced shift of the Fermi level. Our findings demonstrate a controllable platform based on spin-polarized oxide 2DEGs for quantum transport, opening new avenues for spin-orbitronic and topological electronic applications."}

Tin selenide (SnSe) has emerged as a promising anode material due to the high theoretical capacity of tin. Unlike conventional intercalation based electrodes, SnSe undergoes conversion and alloying reactions with lithium to form Li4.4Sn, Sn, and Li2Se, enabling high lithium storage but inducing large volume changes that cause mechanical instability and capacity fading. Embedding SnSe nanoparticles within a Ti3C2Tx MXene framework offers a strategy to mitigate these effects by enhancing conductivity and structural resilience. Here, cryogenic focused ion beam (cryo FIB) slice and view revealed progressive material redistribution and morphological transformation during cycling, underscoring the need for site specific chemical analysis. Cryogenic atom probe tomography (cryo APT) of selected regions provided high spatial and chemical resolution while preserving beam sensitive phases, uncovering nanoscale degradation mechanisms including phase transformations, partial dissolution of active material, and, importantly, the first direct evidence of copper corrosion and copper ion migration from the current collector into the electrode. The observation of copper redistribution demonstrates that current collector degradation contributes directly to chemical contamination and capacity fading in composite electrodes. Together, cryo FIB and cryo APT provide a powerful workflow for elucidating electrode degradation in reactive, beam sensitive systems, offering critical insights for designing more durable and stable next generation battery materials."}

Among earth-abundant thin-film materials, kesterites have attracted considerable interest, however, the well-studied Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) continues to face challenges related to antisite disorder and secondary phase formation. Replacing Zn with Mn in Cu2MnSnS4 (CMTS) mitigates these limitations, improving cation ordering and electronic quality while maintaining favorable optical properties. Yet, despite its potential, CMTS remains largely unexplored in multi-absorber configurations-only one prior study has reported a CMTS-based dual-absorber device. In this work, we present a comprehensive numerical investigation of a CMTS-FeSi2 dual-absorber thin-film solar cell using the one-dimensional solar cell capacitance simulator (SCAPS-1D). FeSi2, with its narrow band gap (0.87 eV) and strong near-infrared absorption, serves as an ideal bottom absorber to complement CMTS, enabling broader spectral utilization. The study systematically examines the effects of geometrical, electronic, and interfacial parameters on carrier transport, and overall device performance. The optimized device delivers an impressive power conversion efficiency of 34.9%, with VOC = 0.79 V, JSC = 51.07 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 85.91%.

Here, we propose a strategy to produce such unconventional torques across broad classes of materials, by leveraging the nonlinear orbital Hall effect. We demonstrate that this nonlinear orbital response is dramatically amplified by topological band degeneracies, where it overwhelmingly dominates the spin response even in systems with strong spin-orbit coupling. These features are confirmed via a quantitative investigation of representative topological metals RhSi, YPtBi, and PbTaSe$_2$, by combining our theory with first-principles calculations. The resulting orbital torques substantially surpass those from linear mechanisms reported thus far. These findings propel the research of orbital transport into the nonlinear regime, broaden the scope of orbital source materials, and establish a new pathway towards high-performance orbitronic devices."}

We study the temporal emergence of this dynamical state using time-resolved microwave electrical measurements. The most intense Floquet mode emerges synchronously with the gyration mode after a common incubation delay which diverges at the scattering threshold. This delay is minimal when the drive is resonant with one of the first order azimuthal spin waves. It can be as short as 3 ns for the maximum investigated power. We conclude that the first-to-occur scattering mechanism is the three-wave splitting of a regular azimuthal eigenmode into a coherent pair formed by a gyration magnon and a Floquet spin wave."}

These materials undergo temperature- and electric-field-induced phase transitions that give rise to their characteristic hysteresis loops. Modeling such hysteresis loops and associated phase transitions enables both a deeper fundamental understanding and reliable property predictions for this important class of materials. To date, modeling has largely relied on classical approaches, often remaining qualitative and/or empirical. Traditional interpretation of these transitions rests on two assumptions: (i) they are activated Arrhenius-type processes and (ii) they occur well within the classical regime. Here, we demonstrate that a model can instead be built on two ''orthogonal`` assumptions: (i) the phase transitions are relaxational processes and (ii) they require a quantum mechanical treatment. Applying this model to both antiferroelectrics and ferroelectrics overcomes the limitations of traditional models and enables efficient first-principles simulations of phase transitions. Furthermore, the success of our unconventional approach highlights the significance of quantum mechanics in transitions long regarded as purely classical.

Remarkably, we observe the emergence of pronounced insulating states at charge neutrality point (CNP), full and half moiré fillings in lattice-aligned armchair SWNT/hBN heterostructures by low-temperature electrical transport measurements. In strong contrast, armchair SWNT devices without hBN alignment do not show any of these insulating behaviors, providing compelling evidence for the significant 1D moiré effect. Our density functional theory (DFT) and tight-binding calculations reveal that synergetic nanotube partial flattening and in-plane lattice reconstruction at 1D moiré interface expand the most stable AB' stacking regions (carbon on top of boron) and open sizable band gaps at both CNP and full moiré fillings at the single-particle level. Our one-body theory predicts no band gaps at half moiré fillings, suggesting that electron correlation and/or electron-phonon interaction may give rise to these emergent insulating behaviors in our 1D moiré systems.

Both materials are close to a ferroelectric transition, but despite six decades of extensive research, pivotal questions regarding the nature of this transition and of the associated fluctuations remain debated. Here we combine inelastic neutron scattering, Raman spectroscopy, and ab initio calculations to study the evolution of soft polar phonons across the strain-induced ferroelectric transition in STO and KTO. We find that the modes remain underdamped and at nonzero energy, consistent with a first-order quantum phase transition. We also reveal a strong violation of the well-known Lyddane-Sachs-Teller relation between the phonon energies and static dielectric permittivities in insulating KTO and STO, which is not captured by ab initio calculations and points to the presence of slow mesoscale fluctuations induced by long-range interactions. In metallic STO, we uncover a first-order transition at a remarkably low critical stress, in qualitative agreement with recent theoretical predictions. The present work resolves several long-standing questions pertaining to the model systems STO and KTO and is relevant to numerous other materials with soft polar phonons."}

We demonstrate the scheme by resolving the phase along the Dirac electronic band of a prototypical topological insulator and observe a resonance-associated phase jump as well as a momentum and phase synchronized inversion revealing the helicity of the Dirac cone. We show the interferometer can be optically controlled by the polarization of the absorbed light, allowing a differential measurement of the phase - a crucial component for extracting phase information from an interferogram.

For anatase TiO$_2$, a broadband optical and abundant material, Mie calculations indicate that robust resonances require size tunability and monodispersity (standard deviation, $\\lesssim$ 5\\%) over an extended range (0.5-2 $μ$m) not yet experimentally covered, while maintaining a refractive index above 2 to ensure optical contrast, for example with biomolecules.

Consequently, the materials display intense and modulable Mie resonances across the visible/near-infrared regions (including biological windows), outperforming previous results that were limited by size. Strong optical resonances combined with ambient-temperature processability enable robust, broadband, label-free detection of transparent biomolecules.

They have gained significant interest due to their potential as alternative energy resources and their applications in gas storage, transportation, and carbon sequestration. However, the fundamental mechanisms governing their formation, especially the influence of gas bubbles, remain poorly understood. In this study, we use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to examine how methane nanobubble size modulates hydrate formation in supercooled water. Nanobubbles of different sizes are generated by modulating the methane concentration in a methane-water mixture during equilibration under high-temperature and low-pressure conditions, followed by quenching to low temperature and high pressure to induce gas hydrate nucleation and subsequent growth. The simulations reveal a strong correlation between nanobubble size and the extent of hydrate formation. Specifically, the extent of hydrate formation increases with bubble size in the small-to-intermediate regime. However, beyond a critical bubble size threshold, the hydrate formation efficiency declines. The work provides new molecular-level insight into how nanobubble size modulates gas hydrate nucleation and growth dynamics."}

While data-driven methods have emerged as promising approaches for accelerating PF simulations, existing methods require extensive training data from numerous evolution trajectories, and their inherent black-box nature raises concerns about long-term prediction reliability. This work demonstrates, through examples of grain growth and spinodal decomposition, that a minimalist Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained with a remarkably small dataset even from a single small-scale simulation can achieve seamless scalability to larger systems and reliable long-term predictions far beyond the temporal range of the training data. The key insight of this work lies in revealing that the success of CNN-based models stems from the alignment between their inductive biases and the physical priors of phase-field simulations specifically, locality and spatiotemporal translation invariance. Through effective receptive field analysis, we verify that the model captures these essential properties during training. Therefore, from a reductionist perspective, the surrogate model essentially establishes a spatiotemporally invariant regression mapping between a grid point's local environment and its subsequent state. Further analysis of the model's feature space demonstrates that microstructural evolution effectively represents a continuous redistribution of a finite set of local environments. When the model has already encountered nearly all possible local environments in the early-stage training data, it can reliably generalize to much longer evolution timescales, regardless of the dramatic changes in global microstructural morphology."}

One such anomaly, known as the \"ballooning effect\" is characterized by an unexpected non-monotonic increase in the write error rate (WER) with increase in STT current at specific current pulse durations. In this study, we systematically investigate the role of the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) on such WER anomaly using micromagnetic simulations of 20 nm and 50 nm magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). We show that DMI promotes incoherent magnetization reversal, prolongs the switching time and creates intermediate multidomain states that result in incomplete reversal. At high DMI values, these states persist even under large switching current densities, reproducing ballooning-like anomalies reported experimentally. In contrast, longer pulses overcome these effects by allowing the system sufficient time to reach a stable state. Our findings show that interfacial DMI can play a role in the ballooning effect and point to interfacial engineering as a practical strategy for improving the reliability of next-generation STT-MRAM."}

We obtain the Landau levels analytically and find that intra-spin and/or inter-spin Landau level crossing occurs. We compute the longitudinal conductivity and quantum Hall conductivity using the Kubo formalism based on linear response theory. We find that the usual Shubnikov-de Haas oscillation in longitudinal conductivity appears that can be made purely spin polarized by adjusting the Fermi level suitably. We observe a beating pattern in the Shubnikov-de Hass oscillation in the intra-spin branches, which arises due to the superposition of Shubnikov-de Hass oscillations corresponding to two bands in each spin branch. This is contrary to the conventional Rashba system, where such beating is due to the superposition of Shubnikov-de Hass oscillations corresponding to the two spin-branches. On the other hand, we note that quantum-Hall conductivity exhibits usual quantization in units of $e^2/h$ corresponding to each spin dependent Landau level. However, the Landau level crossing gives rise to the double jump in the Hall conductivity if the Fermi level is placed precisely at the crossing point."}

As demonstrated, changes in the shape of the emission band of Yb3+ ions corresponding to the 2F5/2 -> 2F7/2 electronic transition, induced by the phase transition, enabled the design of a ratiometric thermometer with a maximum relative sensitivity (SR) of 3.1% K^-1 for LiYO2 doped with 10% Yb3+ and 1% Nd3+ at 290 K. In contrast, the temperature-dependent Yb3+ -> Nd3+ energy transfer facilitated the development of a lifetime-based thermometer with a maximum SR of 1.5% K^-1 for 20% Nd3+ at 378 K. In both approaches, tuning the Nd3+ concentration allowed modulation of both the sensitivity and the temperature at which the maximum SR occurred. This was achieved by shifting the phase transition temperature and increasing the probability of interionic energy transfer, respectively.\n  Notably, the temperature ranges corresponding to the maximum SR for the ratiometric and lifetime modes were distinct, effectively broadening the thermal operating window of the sensor. Additionally, it was shown that LiYO2 doped with Nd3+ and Yb3+ can also be used as a temperature sensor through the ratio of luminescence intensities recorded at two different time gates. Furthermore, the results confirmed that the phonon-assisted energy transfer process plays the dominant role in shaping the luminescence kinetics, surpassing the influence of the structural phase transition. Overall, this study identifies LiYO2:Nd3+,Yb3+ as a promising candidate for multimodal luminescent temperature sensing applications."}

The exponential of the free energy difference is expressed in terms of ensemble averages of the Hamiltonian of mean force (HMF) shift and the chi-squared divergence between the initial and final marginal probability distribution of the open system. A trajectory counterpart of this relation follows from an asymptotic equilibration postulate, which treats relaxation to the final stationary canonical state as a boundary condition rather than as a consequence of constraints on the driven dynamics. In the frozen-coupling regime, the HMF shift reduces to the bare-system Hamiltonian shift, yielding a clear heat-work decomposition. The Jarzynski equality (JE) is recovered under the assumption of Hamiltonian dynamics for the combined system. We validate the theory on a dissipative, phase-space-compressing drive followed by an underdamped Langevin relaxation, where the assumptions underlying the JE break down, whereas our equality reproduces the exact free energy differences."}

Since the chiral splitting reflects the Berry curvature, the concomitant even component, arising from the same microscopic origin, captures the field-induced change of the quantum metric, corresponding to the diagonal Born-Oppenheimer correction. Across two resolvable Eg modes, the unified data are well captured by a simple empirical quadratic relation. These results establish Raman spectroscopy as a direct probe of the quantum metric and an operational decomposition of quantum geometry within a single measurement."}

For disordered alloys, due to the lack of periodicity, it has been challenging to calculate and study their material properties. Special quasi-random structure (SQS) method has been developed and widely used to treat this issue by matching averaged atomic correlation functions to those of ideal random alloys, enabling accurate predictions of macroscopic material properties such as total energy and volume. However, in AxB1-x alloys, statistically allowed local concentration fluctuations can give rise to defect-like minority configurations, such as bulk-like AX or BX regions in the extreme, which could strongly affect calculation of some of the material properties such as semiconductor bandgap, if it is not defined properly, leading to significant discrepancies between theory and experiment. In this work, taking the bandgap as an example, we demonstrate that the calculated alloy bandgap can be significantly underestimated in standard SQS calculations when the SQS cell size is increased to improve the structural model and the bandgap is defined conventionally as the energy difference between the lowest unoccupied state and the highest occupied state, because the rare event motifs can lead to wavefunction localization and become the dominant factor in determining the \"bandgap\", contrary to experiment. To be consistent with experiment, we show that the bandgap of the alloy should be extracted from the majority configurations using a density-of-states fitting (DOSF) method. This DOSF approach resolves the long-standing issue of calculating electronic structure of disordered semiconductor alloys. Similar approaches should also be developed to treat material properties that depends on localized alloy wavefunctions."}

The observation of copper redistribution demonstrates that current collector degradation contributes directly to chemical contamination and capacity fading in composite electrodes.

A stochastic thermodynamics framework is employed to analyze a fluctuation theorem for the first-passage time of the observable process under nonequilibrium steady-state conditions. Based on a generic kinetic model, we demonstrate that, along first-passage trajectories, entropy production remains constant when the changes in stochastic entropy and free energy of the machine are balanced, which corresponds to zero net hidden flux through the initial state manifold. Under this condition, which we define quite generally, this first-passage time fluctuation theorem can be established, with its violation serving as an experimentally detectable signature of hidden detailed balance breaking (which we subsequently characterize). In addition, using an enzymatic model, we show that the violation of our first-passage time fluctuation theorem can be thought of as a consequence of the breakdown of local detailed balance in the steps linking coarse-grained states that correspond to the initial and intermediate state manifolds. In the absence of hidden current, the fluctuation theorem is restored, and a mesoscopic local detailed balance condition can be established, which has implications for the thermodynamic analysis of driven, coarse-grained systems.

In this work, we investigated atomic-scale defects in a two-dimensional silver monolayer intercalated at the interface between epitaxial graphene and SiC using a scanning tunneling microscope. Distinct dark and bright defects are identified as in-plane vacancies and substitutional impurities within the silver monolayer, each hosting a localized electronic state induced solely by the defect. Remarkably, under excitation of tunneling electrons assisted by a negative bias voltage, the defects can hop inelastically which is reminiscent of the hydrogen switching in the cavity of an organic molecule. The hopping can be reversibly controlled by the scanning tunneling microscope tip, allowing the defects to function as atomic-scale two-level conductance switches. Defect hopping further allows us to gain a deeper understanding of their origins and the relationship between dark and bright defect species. This study constitutes a pathway toward understanding and controlling defects in two-dimensional metals with atomic precision, revealing previously unexplored dynamic behavior with potential applications in nanoelectronics."}

To circumvent the severe critical slowing down in direct Potts simulations for large $Q$, we employ large-scale Monte Carlo simulations of the O$(n)$ loop model on the hexagonal lattice, which is regarded to correspond to the Potts model with $Q=n^2$. Using a highly efficient cluster algorithm, we compute the universal three-point amplitude ratios for the backbone ($R_\\text{BB}$) and FK clusters ($R_\\text{FK}$). Our computed $R_\\text{FK}$ exhibits excellent agreement with exact conformal field theory predictions, validating the reliability of our numerical approach.

One such anomaly, known as the \"ballooning effect\" is characterized by an unexpected non-monotonic increase in the write error rate (WER) with increase in STT current at specific current pulse durations. In this study, we systematically investigate the role of the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) on such WER anomaly using micromagnetic simulations of 20 nm and 50 nm magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). We show that DMI promotes incoherent magnetization reversal, prolongs the switching time and creates intermediate multidomain states that result in incomplete reversal. At high DMI values, these states persist even under large switching current densities, reproducing ballooning-like anomalies reported experimentally. In contrast, longer pulses overcome these effects by allowing the system sufficient time to reach a stable state. Our findings show that interfacial DMI can play a role in the ballooning effect and point to interfacial engineering as a practical strategy for improving the reliability of next-generation STT-MRAM."}

Here, we resolve this ambiguity by identifying a novel \"stripe-type orthorhombic phase\" as the true parent phase of the high-Tc state, whose diffraction signature is the d2 peaks. Through decisive experiments, we demonstrate that this d2 parent phase is not intrinsically superconducting. Instead, superconductivity emerges only after this stripe phase undergoes a subsequent structural distortion, the definitive signature of which is the asymmetric broadening of the d1 main peaks. Our findings establish that the d2 peaks signal the formation of the parent phase, while the broadening of d1 peaks signals the transition into the superconducting state. This discovery of a two-step transition--formation of a stripe parent phase, followed by a superconducting distortion--provides a new mechanism for Tc amplification via controlled heterogeneity."}

The most intense Floquet mode emerges synchronously with the gyration mode after a common incubation delay which diverges at the scattering threshold. This delay is minimal when the drive is resonant with one of the first order azimuthal spin waves. It can be as short as 3 ns for the maximum investigated power. We conclude that the first-to-occur scattering mechanism is the three-wave splitting of a regular azimuthal eigenmode into a coherent pair formed by a gyration magnon and a Floquet spin wave."}

This paper provides an in-depth overview of the interaction between a screw dislocation within a distorted magnetic lattice, exploring possible coupling mechanisms and establishing a promising link between two disparate topics in materials science: topological magnetism and topological elasticity.

Altermagnets present a new class of materials with magnetic crystalline order where specific crystal symmetry operations connect antiferromagnetic sublattices, leading to non-relativistic spin-splitting of the electronic band structure. Hence, the electric material properties of altermagnets should uniquely mirror these underlying symmetry properties, potentially giving rise to novel phenomena in response to external driving fields. Here, we report the discovery of a broadband third-order nonlinear anomalous Hall effect in altermagnetic CrSb at room temperature. The comparison of our observations with symmetry analyses and model calculations shows that this nonlinear Hall response is induced by the nonlinear electric susceptibility of a Berry curvature quadrupole, which exists within the spin-split band structure of CrSb and is characterized by the underlying crystalline and magnetic symmetries. We then utilize this third-order nonlinear electric susceptibility of CrSb to realize a multiple wave mixing device with pronounced four wave mixing output, which could, in principle, be extended to THz frequencies. Our study discovers that the crystalline magnetic order of altermagnets determines their nonlinear electric material properties, which could facilitate applications in high-frequency electronics, THz generation, communication networks, and energy harvesting."}

These materials undergo temperature- and electric-field-induced phase transitions that give rise to their characteristic hysteresis loops. Modeling such hysteresis loops and associated phase transitions enables both a deeper fundamental understanding and reliable property predictions for this important class of materials. To date, modeling has largely relied on classical approaches, often remaining qualitative and/or empirical. Traditional interpretation of these transitions rests on two assumptions: (i) they are activated Arrhenius-type processes and (ii) they occur well within the classical regime. Here, we demonstrate that a model can instead be built on two ''orthogonal`` assumptions: (i) the phase transitions are relaxational processes and (ii) they require a quantum mechanical treatment. Applying this model to both antiferroelectrics and ferroelectrics overcomes the limitations of traditional models and enables efficient first-principles simulations of phase transitions. Furthermore, the success of our unconventional approach highlights the significance of quantum mechanics in transitions long regarded as purely classical. We anticipate that this framework will be applicable to a broad range of phase transitions, including magnetic, elastic, multiferroic, and electronic, along with modeling of quantum tunneling, rates of chemical reactions, and others."}

Here we combine inelastic neutron scattering, Raman spectroscopy, and ab initio calculations to study the evolution of soft polar phonons across the strain-induced ferroelectric transition in STO and KTO. We find that the modes remain underdamped and at nonzero energy, consistent with a first-order quantum phase transition. We also reveal a strong violation of the well-known Lyddane-Sachs-Teller relation between the phonon energies and static dielectric permittivities in insulating KTO and STO, which is not captured by ab initio calculations and points to the presence of slow mesoscale fluctuations induced by long-range interactions. In metallic STO, we uncover a first-order transition at a remarkably low critical stress, in qualitative agreement with recent theoretical predictions.

We theoretically establish these generic findings by implementing a minimal model Hamiltonian describing time-reversal symmetry breaking topological and normal insulators on a square lattice, fostering such point defects. The defect-bound mid-gap modes are also shown to be robust against weak point-like charge impurities. Furthermore, we showcase experimental observation of such bound states by embedding ordinary crystal defects in two-dimensional acoustic Chern lattices, where precision-controlled hopping amplitudes are implemented via active meta-atoms and Green's-function-based spectroscopy is used to reconstruct spectra and eigenstates. Our combined theory-experiment study establishes ordinary lattice defects as probes of topology that should be germane in crystals of any symmetry and dimension, raising the possibility of arresting localized Majorana modes near such defects in the bulk of topological superconductors and to emulate ordinary-defect-engineered topological devices."}

They have gained significant interest due to their potential as alternative energy resources and their applications in gas storage, transportation, and carbon sequestration. However, the fundamental mechanisms governing their formation, especially the influence of gas bubbles, remain poorly understood. In this study, we use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to examine how methane nanobubble size modulates hydrate formation in supercooled water. Nanobubbles of different sizes are generated by modulating the methane concentration in a methane-water mixture during equilibration under high-temperature and low-pressure conditions, followed by quenching to low temperature and high pressure to induce gas hydrate nucleation and subsequent growth. The simulations reveal a strong correlation between nanobubble size and the extent of hydrate formation. Specifically, the extent of hydrate formation increases with bubble size in the small-to-intermediate regime. However, beyond a critical bubble size threshold, the hydrate formation efficiency declines. The work provides new molecular-level insight into how nanobubble size modulates gas hydrate nucleation and growth dynamics."}

For large systems ($32,768^2$ in 2D and $1,024^3$ in 3D with double precision), speedups up to $\\sim \\!\\!1,000 \\times$ were obtained compared to the first version of SymPhas using multi-threaded CPU execution on a single system. These developments establish SymPhas 2.0 as a flexible and scalable framework for efficient implementation of phase-field and reaction-diffusion models on GPU-based high-performance computing platforms."}
