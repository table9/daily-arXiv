Hence, selecting an appropriate method based on accuracy and computational cost remains a significant challenge due to varying performance of methods. In this work, we propose a framework based on an ensemble of $Δ$-ML models trained on features extracted from a pre-trained atom-pairwise neural network to predict the error of each method relative to all other methods including the ``gold standard'' coupled cluster with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations at the estimated complete basis set limit [CCSD(T)/CBS]. Our proposed approach provides error estimates across various levels of theories and identifies the computationally efficient approach for a given error range utilizing only a subset of the dataset. Further, this approach allows comparison between various theories. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using an extended BioFragment dataset, which includes the interaction energies for common biomolecular fragments and small organic dimers. Our results show that the proposed framework achieves very small mean-absolute-errors below 0.1 kcal/mol regardless of the given method. Furthermore, by analyzing all-to-all $Δ$-ML models for present levels of theory, we identify method groupings that align with theoretical hypotheses, providing evidence that $Δ$-ML models can easily learn corrections from any level of theory to any other level of theory."}

On the technical side, conventional implementations of the fRG rely on regulators for bare propagators only. Starting from Schwinger--Dyson and Bethe--Salpeter equations, we develop here an fRG formulation where both bare propagators and bare interactions can be dressed with regulators. The approach thus obtained is a generalization of the multiloop fRG recently introduced for many-fermion systems. Using the single-boson exchange decomposition, we show that the underlying flow equations are simply interpreted as adding a regulator to the bosonic propagator and that such an extension scarcely changes the original structure of the flow equations. Overall, we provide a framework for implementing approaches that cannot be realized with conventional fRG methods, such as temperature flows for models with retarded interactions. For concrete applications, we analyze the loop convergence of our scheme against conventional cutoff schemes for the Hubbard atom and the Anderson impurity model.

In this work, the effect of different uncertainty estimation and calibration methods are evaluated for active learning when using ensembles of ALIGNN, eXtreme Gradient Boost, Random Forest, and Neural Network model architectures. We compare uncertainty estimates from ALIGNN deep ensembles to loss landscape uncertainty estimates obtained for solubility, bandgap, and formation energy prediction tasks. We then evaluate how the quality of the uncertainty estimate impacts an active learning campaign that seeks model generalization to out-of-distribution data. Uncertainty calibration methods were found to variably generalize from in-domain data to out-of-domain data. Furthermore, calibrated uncertainties were generally unsuccessful in reducing the amount of data required by a model to improve during an active learning campaign on out-of-distribution data when compared to random sampling and uncalibrated uncertainties. The impact of poor-quality uncertainty persists for random forest and eXtreme Gradient Boosting models trained on the same data for the same tasks, indicating that this is at least partially intrinsic to the data and not due to model capacity alone. Analysis of the target, in-distribution uncertainty, out-of-distribution uncertainty, and training residual distributions suggest that future work focus on understanding empirical uncertainties in the feature input space for cases where ensemble prediction variances do not accurately capture the missing information required for the model to generalize."}

Using fluctuating hydrodynamics, we show that a simple gradient-driven nonequilibrium steady state, in which a fluid is subjected to a constant scalar gradient but remains macroscopically quiescent, also exhibits dissipation anomaly. Direct numerical simulations and self-consistent mode-coupling theory reveal that the anomaly originates from giant, long-range nonequilibrium fluctuations amplified by the imposed gradient. While linear theory predicts a divergent dissipation in the inviscid limit, nonlinear mode coupling regularizes the divergence, yielding a finite anomalous dissipation. Our findings identify a new, non-turbulent arena for dissipation anomaly and establish the interplay between thermal noise and nonequilibrium driving as a fundamental route to singular behavior in hydrodynamics."}

In Pr2Ir2O7, we observed a spatially homogeneous Kondo-lattice resonance, which is compared with that in the kagome Kondo-lattice material CsCr6Sb6. We further discover that the Kondo resonance exhibits a spatial modulation with three-fold symmetry, and the applied magnetic field induces a Zeeman splitting of the Kondo resonance with intriguing atomic site dependence.

Intuitively, nanostructure engineering might provide a promising route to contain high-pressure phase of materials because of the exceptional mechanical strength at nanoscale. However, there is no available theoretical model that can analyze this possibility, not to mention to quantitatively evaluate the pressure-bearing capability of nano-cavities. Here, a physical model is proposed to appraise the absolute theoretical limit of various nanotubes/nanospheres to preserve high-pressure materials to ambient conditions. By incorporating with first-principles calculations, we screen and select four types of representative nanomaterials: graphene, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), biphenylene, and γ-graphyne, and perform systematic investigations. The results indicate that nanotube/nanosphere of graphene exhibits the best pressure-bearing capability, followed by h-BN, biphenylene and γ-graphyne. Our model reveals that the structure with the largest average binding energy per bond and the highest density of bonds will have the highest absolute limit to contain pressure materials, while electron/hole doping and interlayer interactions have minor effects. Our finding suggests that one can utilize nanotube/nanosphere with multiple layers to retrieve compressed material with higher pressures. For example, a single layer graphene sphere can retrieve compressed LaH10 with a volume size of 26 nm3 that corresponding to a pressure of 170 GPa and with a near room temperature superconductor transition of Tc=250 K.

However, the universal density functional is a very complicated mathematical object and almost always it is replaced with its approximate variants. So far, no ``first principles'', mathematically consistent and convergent approximation procedure has been devised that has general applicability.

However, when extended to rarefied gas flows, the computational cost becomes enormous because both the six dimensional primal and adjoint Boltzmann equations must be solved for each candidate shape. Building on the general synthetic iterative scheme (GSIS) for solving the primal Boltzmann model equation, this paper presents a fast converging and asymptotic preserving method for solving the adjoint kinetic equation. The GSIS accelerates the convergence of the adjoint kinetic equation by incorporating solutions of macroscopic synthetic equations, whose constitutive relations include the Newtonian stress law along with higher order terms capturing rarefaction effects. As a result, the method achieves asymptotic preservation (allowing the use of large spatial cell sizes in the continuum limit) while maintaining accuracy in highly rarefied regimes. Numerical tests demonstrate exceptional performance on drag minimization problems for 3D bodies, achieving drag reductions of 34.5% in the transition regime and 61.1% in the slip-flow regime within roughly ten optimization iterations. For each candidate shape, converged solutions of the primal and adjoint Boltzmann equation are obtained with only a few dozen updates of the velocity distribution function, dramatically reducing computational cost compared with conventional methods."}

We show that this behavior arises from transfer matrices that are mathematically irreducible but possess a nearly block-diagonal structure due to the weak contribution of off-diagonal Boltzmann weights in the low-temperature regime. This results in weakly coupled competing sectors whose eigenvalue competition produces abrupt crossovers without nonanalyticity, a mechanism we term nearly block-diagonal irreducible. A key thermodynamic signature of such pseudotransitions is that the residual entropy at the interface remains bounded between the residual entropies of the competing sectors. We develop a general spectral framework to describe this behavior and apply it to two representative models: the Ising chain with internal degeneracy (Doniach model) and a hexagonal nanowire chain with mixed spin-1/2 and spin-1 components. In the first case, we derive exact expressions for the pseudo-critical temperature and residual entropy. In the second, we reduce the full $1458\\times1458$ transfer matrix via symmetry decomposition and construct a low-rank effective matrix that accurately captures the crossover between quasi-ferromagnetic and quasi-core-ferromagnetic regimes. Our results demonstrate that pseudotransitions can be understood as spectral phenomena emerging from irreducible but functionally decoupled structures within the transfer matrix."}

The approach thus obtained is a generalization of the multiloop fRG recently introduced for many-fermion systems. Using the single-boson exchange decomposition, we show that the underlying flow equations are simply interpreted as adding a regulator to the bosonic propagator and that such an extension scarcely changes the original structure of the flow equations. Overall, we provide a framework for implementing approaches that cannot be realized with conventional fRG methods, such as temperature flows for models with retarded interactions. For concrete applications, we analyze the loop convergence of our scheme against conventional cutoff schemes for the Hubbard atom and the Anderson impurity model.

To address this issue, the direct intermittent general synthetic iteration (DIG) scheme has recently been proposed to enable DSMC's rapid and accurate convergence to steady-state solutions, even when the cell size is much larger than the mean free path in near-continuum flow regimes. The first part of the paper is devoted to the mathematical analysis of DIG's fast-converging and asymptotic-preserving properties. Because the Boltzmann equation is analytically intractable, the analysis is conducted using the linearized BGK model. It is found that, in the near continuum flow regime, the DIG method asymptotically recovers the Navier Stokes equations when the cell size is O(1), rather than being constrained by the mean free path. Moreover, after a single cycle of DIG evolution, the deviation from the final steady state solution is reduced by more than a factor of five. In the second part of the paper, the Poiseuille flow and hypersonic flow passing over cylinder are investigated using the DIG scheme, with different time step and cell sizes, thereby demonstrating its efficiency and accuracy in multiscale flow simulation. Specifically, when the Knudsen number is 0.01, the DIG method is found to be faster than the traditional DSMC method by two orders of magnitude. The performance gain becomes even greater at smaller Knudsen numbers. The proposed method holds great potential for engineering applications."}

A cornerstone of this venture is the generation of equal-spin triplet Cooper pairs in superconductor-ferromagnet hybrids, enabling long-range spin-polarized supercurrents and magnetic control over superconducting quantum states for the development of energy-efficient cryogenic devices. Until now, nearly all superconducting spintronic devices have relied on direct interfaces between superconductors and ferromagnets, since it was believed that an insulating barrier would decouple spin and charge transport. This assumption, however, appears to be invalid when a thin spin- and orbit-filtering barrier couples epitaxial ferromagnet and the superconductor. Symmetry filtering plays a crucial role in enhancing giant tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) by selectively allowing specific electronic states to tunnel through the barrier. Such a mechanism is key for high-performance spintronic devices like magnetic random access memories, magnetic sensors or spin-light emitting diodes. This manuscript provides a comprehensive review of superconducting spintronics driven by electron symmetry filtering and interfacial SOC. It emphasizes the critical role of a crystalline MgO barrier in selectively transmitting specific electronic states between V(100) and Fe(100). The manuscript also highlights how interfacial SOC enables symmetry mixing, allowing for the interaction between ferromagnetic and superconducting orderings though MgO(100). This mutual interaction, mediated by interfacial SOC, facilitates the conversion of spin-singlet to spin-triplet Cooper pairs. The work provides key insights into designing SOC based superconductor-ferromagnet hybrid structures for advanced superconducting spintronic functionalities."}

To overcome these limitations, we present a framework for steady-state quantum transport, combining density functional theory (DFT), the non-equilibrium Greens' function (NEGF) method, and dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). The framework is then applied to Cu/Co/vacuum/Cu and an Fe/MgO/Fe tunnel junction. In Co, correlations drive a transition from Fermi-liquid to non-Fermi-liquid behavior under finite bias, due to scattering of electrons with electron-hole pairs. In contrast, in the Fe/MgO/Fe junction, correlation effects are weaker: Fe remains close to equilibrium even at large biases. Nevertheless, inelastic scattering can still induce partly incoherent transport that modifies the device's response to the external bias. Overall, our framework provides a route to model spintronic devices beyond single-particle descriptions, while also suggesting new interpretations of experiments."}

We compare uncertainty estimates from ALIGNN deep ensembles to loss landscape uncertainty estimates obtained for solubility, bandgap, and formation energy prediction tasks. We then evaluate how the quality of the uncertainty estimate impacts an active learning campaign that seeks model generalization to out-of-distribution data. Uncertainty calibration methods were found to variably generalize from in-domain data to out-of-domain data. Furthermore, calibrated uncertainties were generally unsuccessful in reducing the amount of data required by a model to improve during an active learning campaign on out-of-distribution data when compared to random sampling and uncalibrated uncertainties. The impact of poor-quality uncertainty persists for random forest and eXtreme Gradient Boosting models trained on the same data for the same tasks, indicating that this is at least partially intrinsic to the data and not due to model capacity alone.

Despite rich transients in the velocity sector, the long-time positional diffusion equals the overdamped cABP value, independent of mass. From the steady mean-squared velocity, we define a kinetic temperature and a modified fluctuation-dissipation relation whose violation vanishes in two limits: large mass or large chirality, identifying chirality as an additional route to equilibrium-like behavior. The steady-state velocity excess kurtosis gives a phase map that exhibits a (Gaussian-like)-active(bimodal)-(Gaussian-like) re-entrance with mass; chirality confines activity and shrinks the active sector.

In this framework, the overlap matrix between two corners of the Brillouin zone (BZ) is derived from diagonalizing the real-space Hamiltonian with periodic boundary conditions. The pass-ordered product of overlap matrices around the BZ boundary forms a Wilson loop, and defines the Chern number in real space. It is analytically shown that the real-space Chern number is quantized at integers for large enough systems and coincides with the Bott index used in the previous studies. The formulation is greatly simplified for the former so that it makes numerical computations more efficient. The real-space formula is used to numerically elucidate topological phases in a disordered Chern insulator. The Chern insulator is modeled by dimensional extension of the Rice-Mele (RM) model consisting of two sublattices, and is disordered by including a random onsite potential. As disorder strength increases, the nontrivial-to-trivial phase transition takes place for normal disorder with no sublattice polarization. By contrast, the phase diagram is almost unaffected by polarized disorder, indicating that nontrivial topology persists against disorder. These observations are supported by the linear conductance and the density of bulk states."}

Using fluctuating hydrodynamics, we show that a simple gradient-driven nonequilibrium steady state, in which a fluid is subjected to a constant scalar gradient but remains macroscopically quiescent, also exhibits dissipation anomaly. Direct numerical simulations and self-consistent mode-coupling theory reveal that the anomaly originates from giant, long-range nonequilibrium fluctuations amplified by the imposed gradient. While linear theory predicts a divergent dissipation in the inviscid limit, nonlinear mode coupling regularizes the divergence, yielding a finite anomalous dissipation.

We propose that multiband effect offers one possible microscopic route for this temperature-induced enhancement and demonstrate it explicitly within a two-band superconducting model.

Here, we design a practically realizable tight-binding model with nearest-neighbor hopping on the Ammann-Beenker quasicrystalline lattice. This model respects eight-fold rotational and chiral symmetries, resulting in a higher-order topological phase with eight zero-energy corner modes that have no crystalline counterparts. We experimentally explore the topological phase in an acoustic quasicrystal. Surprisingly, we also discover symmetry-protected zero-energy modes near the center of the quasicrystal in a topologically trivial phase, a phenomenon not seen in crystals. We further experimentally observe these modes in a topologically trivial acoustic quasicrystal.

In contrast, in some cases, the local magnetic order has a correlation length greater than half the cylinder width - suggestive that magnetic order might also arise in the 2D limit. For $t'>0$, our results depend more strongly on boundary conditions (periodic vs antiperiodic), making it still harder to correctly guess whether SC or CDW correlations dominate in the 2D limit.

While such noise is pervasive, its overall impact on activated transitions between metastable states remains unclear, despite prior studies of specific noise forms and scaling limits. In this work, we introduce a unified framework for Lévy noise defined by its finite intensity and independent stationary increments. By identifying the most probable transition paths as minimizers of a stochastic action functional, we derive analytical scaling laws for escape rates under weak noise, thereby extending the classical Arrhenius law. Our results demonstrate that Lévy noise universally enhances escape efficiency by reducing the effective potential barrier compared to Gaussian noise with equivalent intensity. Strikingly, even vanishingly weak Lévy noise can exponentially increase escape rates across a broad range of amplitude distributions. This phenomenon arises from discontinuous most probable transition paths, where escape occurs via finite jumps. We validate these paths through the cumulant-generating function, a path integral representation, the mean first passage time and numerical simulations. Our findings reveal fundamental distinctions in escape dynamics under thermal and athermal fluctuations, suggesting new strategies to optimize switching processes in metastable systems through engineering noise properties."}

For the $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$ subsystem symmetry on the square lattice, we build two complementary dualities: a map that sends spontaneous subsystem symmetry-broken (SSSB) phases to the trivial phase (the analogue of the Kramers-Wannier (KW) duality in 1+1D), and a generalized subsystem Kennedy-Tasaki (KT) transformation that maps SSSB phases to subsystem symmetry-protected topological (SSPT) phases while leaving the trivial phase invariant. These dualities are boundary-sensitive. On open lattices, both subsystem KW and KT transformations act as unitary, invertible operators. In particular, the KT map not only matches the bulk Hamiltonians of the dual phases but also carries the spontaneous ground-state degeneracy of the SSSB phase onto the protected boundary degeneracy of the SSPT phase. On closed manifolds, however, both maps become intrinsically non-unitary and non-invertible when restricted to the original Hilbert space. We demonstrate this non-invertibility via ground-state degeneracy matching (in two copies of the Xu-Moore/Ising-plaquette model), analysis of symmetry-twist sectors mapping, and the fusion algebra of the duality operator. Enlarging the Hilbert space to include twisted sectors allows the subsystem KW map to be formulated as a projective unitary preserving quantum transition probabilities, consistent with generalized Wigner-theorem-based constructions. We also show that the KT map faithfully transmits the algebraic content of bulk and edge invariants diagnosing strong SSPT order: although strictly local SSPT repair operators map to highly nonlocal objects in the dual SSSB phase, the essential commutation algebra and the bulk-edge correspondence remain intact."}

Generalized solid-state nudged elastic band calculations are conducted based on DFT for all symmetrically inequivalent paths between the first-nearest-neighbor face-sharing interstitial sites. The hydrogen migration barriers are substantially higher for the paths that require breaking a Ti-H bond than for those that require breaking a Cr-H bond. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with the MLIPs also demonstrate that hydrogen migration occurs more frequently within the hexagonal rings made of the A$_2$B$_2$ interstitial paths, each requiring the breaking of Cr-H bonds, than along the inter-ring paths. The diffusion coefficients of hydrogen obtained from the MD simulations reveal a non-monotonic dependence on hydrogen concentration, which is more pronounced at lower temperatures. Time-averaged radial distribution functions of hydrogen further show that hydrogen avoids face-sharing positions during diffusion and that the hydrogen occupancy at the second-nearest-neighbor edge-sharing positions increases with increasing hydrogen concentration. The diffusion coefficients of hydrogen within 400-1000 K follow an Arrhenius relationship, with activation barriers consistent with most experimental values.

The construction is rigorous for both real and complex fermions in arbitrary dimensions and remains well-defined even when the underlying matrices are singular. Our main mathematical results appear in two master theorems. Theorem 12 provides a comprehensive identity for Berezin integrals over Grassmann variables for real fermions with mixed bosonic-fermionic sources, applicable to any antisymmetric matrix. Its complex analogue, Theorem 13, yields corresponding determinant-based representations. Together, they serve as generating functionals for a wide range of combinatorial and physical models. Key applications include the dimer, monomer-dimer, matching, and almost-matching problems. We revisit the Kasteleyn theorem for planar dimers using Berezin integrals. We construct monomer-dimer systems through the \\textit{Monobisyzexant (Mbsz)} function, which generalizes the Hafnian to incorporate monomer contributions and admits a Pfaffian-sum representation for planar graphs (Theorem 5); and practical techniques for handling singular matrices via unitary block decomposition (Theorem 6) and spectral analysis. We further present explicit mappings between Hafnians and Pfaffians and their submatrix generalizations (Hafnianinhos and Pfaffianinhos); an alternative source-ordered Berezin integral representation for spanning trees and forests using complex bosonic sources that regularizes the Laplacian zero mode (Theorem 10).

Under the irradiation of righthanded circularly polarized light, we predict a three-stage topological phase transition in plumbene, whether it is in a free-standing form or grown on h-BN. Initially, a metallic state evolves into a K(K')-valley-based QAH state with a Chern number of -8, which then decreases to -6 after the valley gap closes. Finally, a band inversion occurs at the $Γ$ point, resulting in a multichannel QAH state with C = -3. The trigonal warping model accounts for both K(K')-valley-based and $Γ$-pointbased QAH states. Additionally, growing plumbene on a non-van-der-Waals substrate eliminates the K(K')-valley-based topology, leaving only the $Γ$-point-based QAH state with C = +3.

Ordered states such as charge density waves (CDWs) can be transiently melted by an ultrafast light excitation. This is also the case for the rare-earth tritelluride LaTe$_3$, a prototypical CDW compound. For this material it has recently been reported that the suppression of the primary CDW allows the transient formation of a second CDW, whose wave vector is orthogonal to the primary one. This creates the intriguing scenario where light enables switching between two distinct ordered phases of the material. While the second CDW has so far been observed by structural techniques, it remains an open question how the interplay of the two CDW phases is reflected in the material's electronic structure. We investigate this via time- and angle-resolved photoemission measurements of LaTe$_3$. The complex Fermi contour is probed using a FeSuMa analyzer, which records the photoemission intensity of the entire Fermi contour at once. The dynamics revealed by the FeSuMa analyzer are complemented by measurements using a conventional hemispherical electron analyzer. We combine conventional data analysis with $k$-means clustering, an unsupervised machine learning technique, demonstrating its strong potential for disentangling large datasets. While we do not find any features that cannot be explained by the melting and re-establishment of the primary CDW, distinct dynamics and coherent oscillations are observed in the different branches of the Fermi contour."}

However, device dielectric failure before ferroelectric switching remains a critical limitation for AlScN-based memory devices. With the continuing trend toward device miniaturization, expanding the operating window is essential for next-generation memory development. In this work, we optimized the breakdown field (EBD) and coercive field (EC) in ultra-thin Al1-xScxN films by controlling defect density via adjustment of nitrogen gas flow during sputter deposition. The characteristic breakdown field, EBD, was evaluated using Weibull statistics, yielding optimal characteristic breakdown fields of 12.47 MV/cm (EBD+) and -12.63 MV/cm (EBD-) for samples deposited under 27.5 sccm N2 flow. The minimum EC was achieved at a nitrogen flow of 25 sccm and increased for higher gas flows, a trend that is opposite to previous reports in much thicker films. The highest EBD over EC ratio of 2.25 occurred at 27.5 sccm, effectively expanding the operational window. Using a combination of X-ray diffraction and photoluminescence spectroscopy to study changes in crystal orientation and defects, device performance can be tuned by controlling the point defect concentration in the ultra-thin film via adjusting the sputtering N2 process gas flow rate."}

We further demonstrate how the KPZ-type scaling governs the large-deviation behavior and survival probability near the boundary in the hyperbolic domain, and how Lifshitz tails arise naturally in a deterministic large-deviation landscape on the hyperbolic plane via instanton approach, reproducing the rare-event statistics of one-dimensional diffusion in the array of traps with the Poisson distribution.

Here we introduce a laterally excited high overtone thickness shear bulk acoustic resonator, abbreviated as X HTBAR, that overcomes these limitations through a fully planar excitation scheme. The X HTBAR employs a 3 micron thick 128 degree Y cut LiNbO3 piezoelectric film on a 500 micron high resistivity silicon substrate, enabling efficient excitation of thickness shear modes through lateral electrodes without the need for bottom electrodes and confining the acoustic field between the top electrodes. This configuration removes parasitic loss channels, increases energy transfer efficiency to greater than ninety nine percent, and provides a stable free spectral range of about 5.75 MHz with very small fluctuations. Experimental measurements show comb like phonon spectra spanning 0.1 to 1.8 GHz, high quality factors in the range of ten to the power of three to ten to the power of five, frequency quality products larger than ten to the power of thirteen at room temperature, and a low temperature coefficient of frequency. In addition, a gridded electrode design together with the intrinsic properties of 128 degree Y cut LiNbO3, including insensitivity to electrode spacing and a large electromechanical coupling coefficient, suppresses spurious modes and allows tunable mode volumes from 0.008 to 0.064 cubic millimeters. These combined features give X HTBAR devices excellent integration compatibility and strong immunity to electrode related perturbations, making them promising multimode phonon sources for large scale quantum interconnects and microwave photonic integrated circuits."}

Here we present systematic studies of bias ARPES, where applying a sample bias expands the accessible momentum range and enables full 2$π$ solid angle collection in two dimension using our 6.994 eV laser source. An analytical conversion relation is established and validated to accurately map the detector angle to the emission angle and the electron momentum in two dimensions. A precise approach is developed to determine the sample work function which is critical in the angle-momentum conversion of the bias ARPES experiments. Energy and angular resolutions are preserved under biases up to 100 V, and minimizing beam size is shown to be crucial. The technique is effective both near normal and off-normal geometries, allowing flexible Brillouin zone access with lower biases.

It is free of Trotter discretization errors and systematically converges to the low-energy states which have finite overlap with the projection subspace as the $β$ parameter increases. While most effective for systems without a sign problem, the method also yields information about low-energy spectra when sign problems are present. We illustrate the approach on two problems. For the sign-free case, we compute the first four low-energy levels in the scaling limit of the one-dimensional Ising model with both transverse and longitudinal fields, demonstrating the flow from the conformal limit to the massive $E_8$ quantum field theory. For the sign-problem case, we apply the method to the frustrated Shastry-Sutherland model and benchmark it against exact diagonalization on small lattices. We also present results for larger systems beyond the lattice sizes accessible to exact diagonalization, while limited to small $β$ where sign problems occur.

Among them, the Lopez-Ruiz-Mancini-Calbet (LMC) statistical complexity has been widely cited due to its simplicity and analytic tractability. Here, we examine the performance and limitations of the LMC measure in a controlled physical setting: a two-dimensional XY model studied through Monte Carlo simulations. By computing LMC complexity at each step of the system's relaxation dynamics, and directly comparing these values with the evolving dipole configurations, we show that LMC complexity systematically fails to identify states of high structural complexity. In particular, the measure often assigns maximal complexity to nearly equilibrated configurations while underestimating vortex-rich intermediate states. We further show that the time derivative of LMC complexity contains more meaningful dynamical information. We propose that future measures incorporate directionality and dynamical sensitivity to better reflect the emergence and decay of organization in nonequilibrium systems."}

This distinction originates from the path traced by its rotation matrices within the doubly connected SO(3) group manifold, leading to a nontrivial spinor phase of $e^{iπ}$ upon encircling the texture. Using an explicit SU(2) gauge field formalism, we derive the emergent magnetic field components generated by both conventional and spin-flux skyrmions. While conventional skyrmions exhibit a dominant $σ_z$ component with weak dipolar $σ_x, σ_y$ contributions, spin-flux skyrmions possess an additional monopolar $σ_x$ component that yields a finite average emergent field for a finite density of skyrmions. This nontrivial component introduces a nontrivial term in the Hall conductivity, enabling a direct explanation of experimental Hall resistivity anomalies that cannot be accounted for by conventional skyrmions alone. Moreover, we show that this additional term couples to the in-plane spin polarization of conduction electrons, providing a further tunable handle to control the transverse Hall response."}

Here we introduce a general and numerically efficient framework to diagnose mixed-state topological phases in strongly interacting systems via the disorder parameter (DP) of the U(1) charge operator. Specifically, from the finite-size scaling of the second derivative of the DP generating function, we introduce the topological scaling indicator, which exhibits a characteristic linear scaling with the system's linear dimension for topological phases, a signature that vanishes upon transition into a topologically trivial phase. Crucially, we develop an efficient determinant Quantum Monte Carlo algorithm that facilitates the evaluation of this indicator in interacting systems. We apply our approach to two paradigmatic models: for the Kane-Mele-Hubbard model, we successfully map the interaction-driven transition from a quantum spin Hall insulator to a trivial Mott insulator. Furthermore, our method circumvents the limitations imposed by the severe sign problem in the Haldane-Hubbard model, enabling robust identification of the quantum anomalous Hall phase at accessible temperatures.

Because different pulse sequences can produce the same trajectory solution for the state in the phase space, there is strong potential for optimization, particularly in regard to the energy cost of the programming phase, which this study addresses. Without loss of generality, the proposed theory-based energy minimization strategy is applied to the voltage threshold adaptive memristor model, known for its predictive capability and adaptability to fit a large number of resistance switching memory devices. The optimization design crafts ad-hoc pulse sequences, that minimize the energy required to program the device into a desired dynamical attractor state.

Generalized solid-state nudged elastic band calculations are conducted based on DFT for all symmetrically inequivalent paths between the first-nearest-neighbor face-sharing interstitial sites. The hydrogen migration barriers are substantially higher for the paths that require breaking a Ti-H bond than for those that require breaking a Cr-H bond. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with the MLIPs also demonstrate that hydrogen migration occurs more frequently within the hexagonal rings made of the A$_2$B$_2$ interstitial paths, each requiring the breaking of Cr-H bonds, than along the inter-ring paths. The diffusion coefficients of hydrogen obtained from the MD simulations reveal a non-monotonic dependence on hydrogen concentration, which is more pronounced at lower temperatures. Time-averaged radial distribution functions of hydrogen further show that hydrogen avoids face-sharing positions during diffusion and that the hydrogen occupancy at the second-nearest-neighbor edge-sharing positions increases with increasing hydrogen concentration. The diffusion coefficients of hydrogen within 400-1000 K follow an Arrhenius relationship, with activation barriers consistent with most experimental values.

We further discover that the Kondo resonance exhibits a spatial modulation with three-fold symmetry, and the applied magnetic field induces a Zeeman splitting of the Kondo resonance with intriguing atomic site dependence. We discuss the relations of these many-body electronic phenomena with the pyrochlore lattice geometry and its charge or spin frustration. Our systematic observations offer atomic-scale insights into the many-body electronic structures of the geometrically frustrated pyrochlore superconductors and spin liquids."}

Although current-induced magnetic moment accumulation is crucial both for fundamental understanding and practical applications, direct quantifications are scarce. Optical polarization measurements, namely magneto-optical Kerr rotation (MOKE) ($θ_K$), have been used to get direct evidence of magnetic accumulation perpendicular to a current flow density ($J$) in late transition metals (Pt) as well as in light transition elements (Ti, Cr), and used to conclude evidence of spin or orbital momentum accumulation. However, discrepancies of the reported $θ_K/J$ values, exceeding one order of magnitude, together with early claims that conventional MOKE experiments were not a suitable tool, is prompting revisions of methods and results. Here, we report on a new methodology for MOKE measurements that solves known bottlenecks. We obtain a sensitivity of $(354 \\pm 27)$ nV/nrad and use the designed protocol to measure $|θ_K^S/J| = (7.92 \\pm 1.94)$ nrad/$(10^7$ A/cm$^2)$ and $|θ_K^P/J| = (6.89 \\pm 1.74)$ nrad/$(10^7$ A/cm$^2)$ in a 50 nm thick Pt bar for S and P polarized incident light, respectively.The extracted value of $|θ_K^S/J|$ is significantly smaller, about a 7-fold reduction, than previous results on a nominally identical device.

We show that this behavior arises from transfer matrices that are mathematically irreducible but possess a nearly block-diagonal structure due to the weak contribution of off-diagonal Boltzmann weights in the low-temperature regime. This results in weakly coupled competing sectors whose eigenvalue competition produces abrupt crossovers without nonanalyticity, a mechanism we term nearly block-diagonal irreducible. A key thermodynamic signature of such pseudotransitions is that the residual entropy at the interface remains bounded between the residual entropies of the competing sectors. We develop a general spectral framework to describe this behavior and apply it to two representative models: the Ising chain with internal degeneracy (Doniach model) and a hexagonal nanowire chain with mixed spin-1/2 and spin-1 components. In the first case, we derive exact expressions for the pseudo-critical temperature and residual entropy. In the second, we reduce the full $1458\\times1458$ transfer matrix via symmetry decomposition and construct a low-rank effective matrix that accurately captures the crossover between quasi-ferromagnetic and quasi-core-ferromagnetic regimes. Our results demonstrate that pseudotransitions can be understood as spectral phenomena emerging from irreducible but functionally decoupled structures within the transfer matrix."}

In essence, this constraint requires each of the $K$-mers in use to be as lengthy as possible, given its surroundings in the resulting tiling. Maximality aims to limit the variety of possible tilings while allowing for interesting behavior in terms of the statistical physical observables of interest. In fact, by introducing an energy function based on cell contacts and parameterizing it appropriately, we have been able to observe relatively unexpected behavior, including the suggestion of phase transitions as the system's temperature evolves."}

Here, we assess Berry flux diagonalization using ab initio calculations of a large set of materials, introducing and validating heuristics that ensure branch alignment with a minimal number of intermediate interpolated structures. Our automated implementation of Berry flux diagonalization succeeds in cases where prior interpolation-based workflows fail due to band-gap closures or branch ambiguities. Benchmarking with ab initio calculations of 176 candidate ferroelectrics, we demonstrate the efficacy of the approach on a broad range of insulating materials and obtain accurate effective polarization values with fewer interpolated structures than prior automated interpolation-based workflows. Our real-space heuristics that can predict gauge stability a priori from ionic displacements enable a general automated framework for reliable polarization calculations and efficient high-throughput screening of chemically and structurally diverse polar insulators.

We demonstrate that this quantized polarization (QP) is not a mathematical artifact but a \\emph{symmetry-protected invariant} that encodes intrinsic information about a material's symmetry and electronic structure. Because of its discrete and non-continuous nature, when two materials with different QPs form an interface, their bulk polarization states cannot be connected adiabatically, compelling the system to develop pronounced interfacial responses: such as metallic states, bound charges, or strong lattice distortions. This theoretical framework provides a unified reinterpretation of classical systems such as the LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interface, revealing it as a prototypical case of QP mismatch.

In this work, we optimized the breakdown field (EBD) and coercive field (EC) in ultra-thin Al1-xScxN films by controlling defect density via adjustment of nitrogen gas flow during sputter deposition. The characteristic breakdown field, EBD, was evaluated using Weibull statistics, yielding optimal characteristic breakdown fields of 12.47 MV/cm (EBD+) and -12.63 MV/cm (EBD-) for samples deposited under 27.5 sccm N2 flow. The minimum EC was achieved at a nitrogen flow of 25 sccm and increased for higher gas flows, a trend that is opposite to previous reports in much thicker films. The highest EBD over EC ratio of 2.25 occurred at 27.5 sccm, effectively expanding the operational window.

Using time-resolved terahertz (THz) spectroscopy, near-band-gap excitation produces a pronounced temporal delay in photoconductivity, indicating that a fraction of photogenerated charge carriers is temporarily trapped immediately after excitation. By analyzing the frequency-resolved complex photoconductivity as a function of pump-probe delay and photon energy, we attribute this delay to the presence of a localized shallow state situated approximately 40 meV from the band edge, which competes with silicon's indirect band-to-band absorption. The zero-order kinetic profile of the temporal delay, its invariance with respect to photon flux, and its temperature dependence collectively support the existence of a phonon bottleneck that hinders the thermal release of electrons from this shallow trap. this represents experimental evidence of a phonon bottleneck effect associated with the thermal activation of shallow traps in photoexcited silicon.

However, experimental insights into their ground state electronic structures remain limited. Here, we present a comprehensive investigation of V$X_3$ using high resolution resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) combined with ligand field multiplet calculations. The RIXS spectra reveal distinct $dd$ and charge-transfer excitations, allowing precise determination of electronic structure parameters, including the crystal field splitting, trigonal distortion, and Racah parameters. The determined parameters showed clear variation, indicating an increase in covalency from Br to I. The trigonal distortion parameters $Δ_{D_{3d}}$ were determined to be -0.096 eV in VBr$_3$ and 0.07 eV in VI$_3$, indicating a sign opposition between the two compounds, reflecting good agreement with experimental RIXS data. Cluster model calculations yield a high-spin V$^{3+}$ $(S = 1)$ configuration, with an $e'^2_g$ ground state in VBr$_3$ and an $e'^1_ga^1_{1g}$ ground state in VI$_3$, consistent with trigonal elongation and compression, respectively.

This limitation is acute in laser-based ARPES, where the low photon energy restricts momentum space despite ultrahigh resolution. Here we present systematic studies of bias ARPES, where applying a sample bias expands the accessible momentum range and enables full 2$π$ solid angle collection in two dimension using our 6.994 eV laser source. An analytical conversion relation is established and validated to accurately map the detector angle to the emission angle and the electron momentum in two dimensions. A precise approach is developed to determine the sample work function which is critical in the angle-momentum conversion of the bias ARPES experiments. Energy and angular resolutions are preserved under biases up to 100 V, and minimizing beam size is shown to be crucial. The technique is effective both near normal and off-normal geometries, allowing flexible Brillouin zone access with lower biases. Bias ARPES thus elevates laser ARPES to a new level, extending momentum coverage while retaining high resolution, and is applicable across a broad photon-energy range."}

The increased electromechanical coupling in these compounds boosts the performance of high-frequency acoustic devices. So far, progress has largely focused on Al$_{1-x}$Sc$_x$N, which is costly and poorly compatible with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technologies. Here, we investigate aluminum hafnium nitride (Al$_{1-x}$Hf$_{x}$N) as a scalable and potentially CMOS-compatible alternative to Al$_{1-x}$Sc$_x$N. Using reactive co-sputtering on both Si and sapphire substrates, we demonstrate wurtzite Al$_{1-x}$Hf$_{x}$N thin films ($x \\leq 0.17$) with strong $c$-axis texture and nearly isotropic lattice expansion upon Hf incorporation. X-ray absorption spectroscopy indicates cross-gap hybridization between N 2$p$ and Hf 5$d$ states, which can enhance the Born effective charge and, thereby, the piezoelectric response. Correspondingly, we observe a nearly two-fold enhancement in the piezoelectric coefficient, $d_{33}$, relative to AlN, despite increasing structural disorder in Al$_{1-x}$Hf$_{x}$N.

Here we use dynamical phase-field simulations to identify the collective modes of an Ising-type $180^{\\circ}$ DW in a uniaxially strained BaTiO3 membrane. The membrane concurrently functions as a cavity for polarization and acoustic waves and permits cavity-enhanced resonant excitation of polarization waves. The simulation reveals an unconventional DW sliding mode that exhibits a depolarization-field-driven nonzero resonant frequency and a dynamically changing internal structure during sliding. These features differ from the previously reported DW sliding modes that have a zero resonant frequency or a rigid internal structure. An analytical model is developed to quantitatively understand the origin of this new DW mode and predict the effect of strain on the mode frequency. The analytically predicted strain dependence of the frequencies of the unconventional DW sliding mode and the DW breathing mode, both in the terahertz regime, is further validated by dynamical phase-field simulations. These results provide new insights into the high-frequency dynamics of ferroelectric DWs and suggest opportunities for realizing on-demand control of phonon-DW resonance by strain, and more broadly, discovering and controlling unconventional DW modes in conventional domain patterns, with applications to reconfigurable THz and optical devices."}

It is analytically shown that the real-space Chern number is quantized at integers for large enough systems and coincides with the Bott index used in the previous studies. The formulation is greatly simplified for the former so that it makes numerical computations more efficient. The real-space formula is used to numerically elucidate topological phases in a disordered Chern insulator. The Chern insulator is modeled by dimensional extension of the Rice-Mele (RM) model consisting of two sublattices, and is disordered by including a random onsite potential. As disorder strength increases, the nontrivial-to-trivial phase transition takes place for normal disorder with no sublattice polarization. By contrast, the phase diagram is almost unaffected by polarized disorder, indicating that nontrivial topology persists against disorder.

Density functional theory calculations for bulk Co$_3$O$_4$ show that introducing an oxygen vacancy reduces two adjacent Co$^{3+}$ ions to Co$^{2+}$ and narrows the band gap. The newly formed Co$^{2+}$ ions adopt high-spin configurations in distorted octahedral sites and remain stable in this state in ab initio molecular dynamics simulations at $300$ K. Computed O and Co K-edge X-ray absorption spectra for ideal and vacancy-containing Co$_3$O$_4$ show excellent agreement with the experimental data and serve as references to analyze the liquid-phase ethylene glycol oxidation. The comparison with experimental O K-edge spectra of fresh and post-reaction catalysts shows that fresh samples resemble the vacancy-containing reference, whereas post-reaction spectra shift toward the ideal reference. These results suggest that under liquid-phase ethylene glycol oxidation conditions, Co$_3$O$_4$ becomes more oxidized rather than reduced, by refilling preexisting oxygen vacancies.

The nanoplatelet size dictates the competition between ultrafast edge-trapping and slower core-exciton recombina- tion, and the states responsible for exciton quenching enhance catalytic activity. Our work represents an important step forward in understanding exciton quenching in TMD nanoplatelets and stimulates additional research to refine physicochemical protocols for enhanced PL."}

These results agree quantitatively with simulations over all masses, activities, and chiralities. We show that the velocity autocorrelation factorizes into an inertial envelope and a chiral envelope. Despite rich transients in the velocity sector, the long-time positional diffusion equals the overdamped cABP value, independent of mass. From the steady mean-squared velocity, we define a kinetic temperature and a modified fluctuation-dissipation relation whose violation vanishes in two limits: large mass or large chirality, identifying chirality as an additional route to equilibrium-like behavior. The steady-state velocity excess kurtosis gives a phase map that exhibits a (Gaussian-like)-active(bimodal)-(Gaussian-like) re-entrance with mass; chirality confines activity and shrinks the active sector. A narrow positive-kurtosis window emerges at large mass and intermediate chirality, with analytic boundaries consistent with the heavy-mass asymptote."}

Using time-resolved terahertz (THz) spectroscopy, near-band-gap excitation produces a pronounced temporal delay in photoconductivity, indicating that a fraction of photogenerated charge carriers is temporarily trapped immediately after excitation. By analyzing the frequency-resolved complex photoconductivity as a function of pump-probe delay and photon energy, we attribute this delay to the presence of a localized shallow state situated approximately 40 meV from the band edge, which competes with silicon's indirect band-to-band absorption. The zero-order kinetic profile of the temporal delay, its invariance with respect to photon flux, and its temperature dependence collectively support the existence of a phonon bottleneck that hinders the thermal release of electrons from this shallow trap. this represents experimental evidence of a phonon bottleneck effect associated with the thermal activation of shallow traps in photoexcited silicon. These findings provide microscopic insight into carrier relaxation dynamics in silicon and highlight the significance of electron-phonon interactions in the ultrafast processes governing materials used in optoelectronic applications."}

Existing {\\it ab initio} methods either capture bias-dependent transport but neglect dynamical correlations or include correlations but are restricted to equilibrium or linear-response regimes. To overcome these limitations, we present a framework for steady-state quantum transport, combining density functional theory (DFT), the non-equilibrium Greens' function (NEGF) method, and dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). The framework is then applied to Cu/Co/vacuum/Cu and an Fe/MgO/Fe tunnel junction. In Co, correlations drive a transition from Fermi-liquid to non-Fermi-liquid behavior under finite bias, due to scattering of electrons with electron-hole pairs. In contrast, in the Fe/MgO/Fe junction, correlation effects are weaker: Fe remains close to equilibrium even at large biases. Nevertheless, inelastic scattering can still induce partly incoherent transport that modifies the device's response to the external bias. Overall, our framework provides a route to model spintronic devices beyond single-particle descriptions, while also suggesting new interpretations of experiments."}

Optical characterization, including steady-state absorption, photoluminescence (PL), and femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, reveals a systematic blueshift in emission energy with increasing FABr content, attributed to the passivation of bromine vacancies and to the reduction of defect-assisted recombination. Power-dependent PL confirms this interpretation: the stoichiometric film exhibits a PL band due to donor-acceptor pair (DAP) recombination as identified by the typical excitation-dependent blueshift, whereas FABr-enriched samples show no evidence of DAP emission, indicating effective defect passivation. Additionally, morphological characterization shows a reduction in grain size with increasing FABr excess, indicating a trade-off between improved electronic quality and enhanced structural disorder. The film synthesized with a 5% excess of FABr provides the optimal balance, yielding the highest power conversion efficiency (6.26%), average visible transmittance (61.6%), and light utilization efficiency (3.85%). These results demonstrate that fine-tuning the precursor stoichiometry through controlled FABr addition represents a simple yet effective strategy to enhance the optoelectronic quality and performance of semitransparent perovskite solar cells."}

Although current-induced magnetic moment accumulation is crucial both for fundamental understanding and practical applications, direct quantifications are scarce. Optical polarization measurements, namely magneto-optical Kerr rotation (MOKE) ($θ_K$), have been used to get direct evidence of magnetic accumulation perpendicular to a current flow density ($J$) in late transition metals (Pt) as well as in light transition elements (Ti, Cr), and used to conclude evidence of spin or orbital momentum accumulation. However, discrepancies of the reported $θ_K/J$ values, exceeding one order of magnitude, together with early claims that conventional MOKE experiments were not a suitable tool, is prompting revisions of methods and results. Here, we report on a new methodology for MOKE measurements that solves known bottlenecks. We obtain a sensitivity of $(354 \\pm 27)$ nV/nrad and use the designed protocol to measure $|θ_K^S/J| = (7.92 \\pm 1.94)$ nrad/$(10^7$ A/cm$^2)$ and $|θ_K^P/J| = (6.89 \\pm 1.74)$ nrad/$(10^7$ A/cm$^2)$ in a 50 nm thick Pt bar for S and P polarized incident light, respectively.The extracted value of $|θ_K^S/J|$ is significantly smaller, about a 7-fold reduction, than previous results on a nominally identical device. Given that differences in the microstructure of Pt films cannot account for such large discrepancy, this implies that experimental procedures and models should be revised accordingly."}

In this work, we apply this simulation scheme to study the dependence of kinetic friction on sliding velocity. Using a prototypical diamond interface with varying hydrogen coverages, we find that the friction force decreases with increasing sliding velocity, revealing two distinct sliding regimes at low and high speeds. We provide a physical interpretation of this velocity dependence based on the modulation of the frictional force by the sliding motion over the periodic potential energy surface of the interface. High velocities lead to force cancellation, while low velocities result in a net frictional force characterized by a distinctive sawtooth profile."}

Using the conformal loop ensemble, we derive exact, generation-dependent fractal dimensions, which are quantitatively confirmed by large-scale Monte Carlo simulations. The evolutionary trajectory depends not only on the universality class of the initial state but also on whether it possesses a two-state critical structure, leading to different critical exponents starting from site and bond percolation.

Here, we develop a highly efficient hard-particle packing algorithm to model large samples of these layered complex alloys that enables an accurate determination of the geometrical and topological properties of the B-site arrangements within the plane of the inorganic layers across length scales. Our results are in good agreement with various experiments, and therefore our algorithm bypasses the need for full-blown ab initio calculations. The accurate predictive power of our algorithm demonstrates how our minimalist hard-particle model effectively captures complex interactions and dynamics like incoherent thermal motion, out of plane octahedral tilting, and bond compression/stretching. We specifically show that the composition-dependent miscibility predicted by our algorithm for certain silver-iron and copper-indium layered alloys are consistent with previous experimental observations. We further quantify the degree of mixing in the simulated structures across length scales using our recently developed sensitive \"mixing\" metric. The large structural snapshots provided by our algorithm also shed light on previous experimentally measured magnetic properties of a copper-indium system. The generalization of our algorithm to model 3D perovskite alloys is also discussed.

Here, we develop a generic theory for the ARPES signature of trions in the model system of a monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD). We simulate the ARPES signals of both positively and negatively charged trions and show that the interaction of the residual holes, or electron and hole, lead to large energy shifts, on the order of the exciton binding energy, compared to the exciton signal. For positive trions, the additional momentum degree of freedom of the residual particles removes any strict lower bound on the photoemission energy, leading to distinctive asymmetric spectral features. For negative trions, the photoemission process causes the tr-ARPES spectrum to reproduce inverted images of the exciton band structure for multiple exciton states, encompassing both spin-allowed and spin-forbidden states, providing a direct momentum-resolved probe of both trion and exciton physics."}

While such noise is pervasive, its overall impact on activated transitions between metastable states remains unclear, despite prior studies of specific noise forms and scaling limits. In this work, we introduce a unified framework for Lévy noise defined by its finite intensity and independent stationary increments. By identifying the most probable transition paths as minimizers of a stochastic action functional, we derive analytical scaling laws for escape rates under weak noise, thereby extending the classical Arrhenius law. Our results demonstrate that Lévy noise universally enhances escape efficiency by reducing the effective potential barrier compared to Gaussian noise with equivalent intensity. Strikingly, even vanishingly weak Lévy noise can exponentially increase escape rates across a broad range of amplitude distributions. This phenomenon arises from discontinuous most probable transition paths, where escape occurs via finite jumps. We validate these paths through the cumulant-generating function, a path integral representation, the mean first passage time and numerical simulations. Our findings reveal fundamental distinctions in escape dynamics under thermal and athermal fluctuations, suggesting new strategies to optimize switching processes in metastable systems through engineering noise properties."}

Such interfaces are ubiquitous in materials, minerals, and compounds, with examples including grain boundaries in polycrystals and phase boundaries in multi-phase systems. Existing methodologies such as the topological model provide a framework for understanding the nature of coherency between two crystals and the line defect content within an interface. However, these methods only consider states of coherency achieved via affine transformations. Here we show that in some interfaces, local relaxations in the form of non-affine transformations lead to the introduction of additional coincidence sites within the interface; we term this class of interfaces as e-coherent. These non-affine relaxations are topologically equivalent to inserting disconnection (or disclination) dipoles or loops into the interface. Unlike traditional interfacial line defects, the defects associated with e-coherency cannot have long-range stress fields and their motion alters the state of coherency between the crystals. Given these unique properties, we differentiate them from other defects by referring to them as discohesions. Through atomistic simulations and transmission electron microscopy, we show that the energetics and kinetics of e-coherent interfaces are strongly affected by the discohesion content in the interface, leading to fundamentally different behaviors compared to non-e-coherent interfaces. We demonstrate e-coherency in grain, twin, and phase boundaries, and that a given interface can have multiple possible e-coherent states. These results suggest that e-coherency is likely to be pervasive in crystalline solids."}

Here, we investigate Floquet-engineered topological phase transitions in anisotropic 1T'-WSe2 and its Janus derivative WSeTe monolayers, which exhibit valley-degenerate and valley-polarized characteristics, respectively. In 1T'-WSe2, a single topological-phase-transition (TPT) occurs from the quantum-spin-Hall state (QSH) to the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) state, involving one spin channel at both valleys simultaneously. In contrast, Janus WSeTe undergoes a two-stage Floquet-driven TPT that occurs within a single valley and sequentially involves two spin components. The intermediate phase manifests as a valley-polarized QAH (vp-QAH) state with a finite valley Chern number, while the final phase evolves into a high-Chern-number QAH state with distinct valley gaps. Furthermore, an in-plane anisotropic response of the TPTs is predicted under oblique light incidence, reflecting the intrinsic low-symmetry nature of the lattice. These findings provide a comprehensive understanding of Floquet-engineered valley-based topological properties and offer guidance for designing light-controllable valleytronic and topological devices."}

The good agreement between our results and experimental observations for Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ enables a conclusive interpretation of key features in the spectra obtained from the aforementioned techniques.

Here, we assess Berry flux diagonalization using ab initio calculations of a large set of materials, introducing and validating heuristics that ensure branch alignment with a minimal number of intermediate interpolated structures. Our automated implementation of Berry flux diagonalization succeeds in cases where prior interpolation-based workflows fail due to band-gap closures or branch ambiguities. Benchmarking with ab initio calculations of 176 candidate ferroelectrics, we demonstrate the efficacy of the approach on a broad range of insulating materials and obtain accurate effective polarization values with fewer interpolated structures than prior automated interpolation-based workflows. Our real-space heuristics that can predict gauge stability a priori from ionic displacements enable a general automated framework for reliable polarization calculations and efficient high-throughput screening of chemically and structurally diverse polar insulators. These results establish Berry flux diagonalization as a robust and efficient method to compute the effective polarization of solids and to accelerate the data-driven discovery of functional polar materials."}

For $t'\\leq 0$, the ground-state appears to be a charge-density wave (CDW) of one sort or another with SC correlations that are extremely short-ranged. In contrast, in some cases, the local magnetic order has a correlation length greater than half the cylinder width - suggestive that magnetic order might also arise in the 2D limit. For $t'>0$, our results depend more strongly on boundary conditions (periodic vs antiperiodic), making it still harder to correctly guess whether SC or CDW correlations dominate in the 2D limit.

Ordered states such as charge density waves (CDWs) can be transiently melted by an ultrafast light excitation. This is also the case for the rare-earth tritelluride LaTe$_3$, a prototypical CDW compound. For this material it has recently been reported that the suppression of the primary CDW allows the transient formation of a second CDW, whose wave vector is orthogonal to the primary one. This creates the intriguing scenario where light enables switching between two distinct ordered phases of the material. While the second CDW has so far been observed by structural techniques, it remains an open question how the interplay of the two CDW phases is reflected in the material's electronic structure. We investigate this via time- and angle-resolved photoemission measurements of LaTe$_3$. The complex Fermi contour is probed using a FeSuMa analyzer, which records the photoemission intensity of the entire Fermi contour at once. The dynamics revealed by the FeSuMa analyzer are complemented by measurements using a conventional hemispherical electron analyzer. We combine conventional data analysis with $k$-means clustering, an unsupervised machine learning technique, demonstrating its strong potential for disentangling large datasets. While we do not find any features that cannot be explained by the melting and re-establishment of the primary CDW, distinct dynamics and coherent oscillations are observed in the different branches of the Fermi contour."}

Here, we examine the performance and limitations of the LMC measure in a controlled physical setting: a two-dimensional XY model studied through Monte Carlo simulations. By computing LMC complexity at each step of the system's relaxation dynamics, and directly comparing these values with the evolving dipole configurations, we show that LMC complexity systematically fails to identify states of high structural complexity. In particular, the measure often assigns maximal complexity to nearly equilibrated configurations while underestimating vortex-rich intermediate states. We further show that the time derivative of LMC complexity contains more meaningful dynamical information. We propose that future measures incorporate directionality and dynamical sensitivity to better reflect the emergence and decay of organization in nonequilibrium systems."}

We demonstrate that this quantized polarization (QP) is not a mathematical artifact but a \\emph{symmetry-protected invariant} that encodes intrinsic information about a material's symmetry and electronic structure. Because of its discrete and non-continuous nature, when two materials with different QPs form an interface, their bulk polarization states cannot be connected adiabatically, compelling the system to develop pronounced interfacial responses: such as metallic states, bound charges, or strong lattice distortions. This theoretical framework provides a unified reinterpretation of classical systems such as the LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interface, revealing it as a prototypical case of QP mismatch. By establishing QP as a fundamental bulk invariant, our work uncovers a universal mechanism governing interfacial electronic phenomena and opens new pathways for the design of functional quantum materials through engineered polarization mismatch."}

The X HTBAR employs a 3 micron thick 128 degree Y cut LiNbO3 piezoelectric film on a 500 micron high resistivity silicon substrate, enabling efficient excitation of thickness shear modes through lateral electrodes without the need for bottom electrodes and confining the acoustic field between the top electrodes. This configuration removes parasitic loss channels, increases energy transfer efficiency to greater than ninety nine percent, and provides a stable free spectral range of about 5.75 MHz with very small fluctuations. Experimental measurements show comb like phonon spectra spanning 0.1 to 1.8 GHz, high quality factors in the range of ten to the power of three to ten to the power of five, frequency quality products larger than ten to the power of thirteen at room temperature, and a low temperature coefficient of frequency. In addition, a gridded electrode design together with the intrinsic properties of 128 degree Y cut LiNbO3, including insensitivity to electrode spacing and a large electromechanical coupling coefficient, suppresses spurious modes and allows tunable mode volumes from 0.008 to 0.064 cubic millimeters.

A cornerstone of this venture is the generation of equal-spin triplet Cooper pairs in superconductor-ferromagnet hybrids, enabling long-range spin-polarized supercurrents and magnetic control over superconducting quantum states for the development of energy-efficient cryogenic devices. Until now, nearly all superconducting spintronic devices have relied on direct interfaces between superconductors and ferromagnets, since it was believed that an insulating barrier would decouple spin and charge transport. This assumption, however, appears to be invalid when a thin spin- and orbit-filtering barrier couples epitaxial ferromagnet and the superconductor. Symmetry filtering plays a crucial role in enhancing giant tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) by selectively allowing specific electronic states to tunnel through the barrier. Such a mechanism is key for high-performance spintronic devices like magnetic random access memories, magnetic sensors or spin-light emitting diodes. This manuscript provides a comprehensive review of superconducting spintronics driven by electron symmetry filtering and interfacial SOC. It emphasizes the critical role of a crystalline MgO barrier in selectively transmitting specific electronic states between V(100) and Fe(100). The manuscript also highlights how interfacial SOC enables symmetry mixing, allowing for the interaction between ferromagnetic and superconducting orderings though MgO(100). This mutual interaction, mediated by interfacial SOC, facilitates the conversion of spin-singlet to spin-triplet Cooper pairs. The work provides key insights into designing SOC based superconductor-ferromagnet hybrid structures for advanced superconducting spintronic functionalities."}

For the $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$ subsystem symmetry on the square lattice, we build two complementary dualities: a map that sends spontaneous subsystem symmetry-broken (SSSB) phases to the trivial phase (the analogue of the Kramers-Wannier (KW) duality in 1+1D), and a generalized subsystem Kennedy-Tasaki (KT) transformation that maps SSSB phases to subsystem symmetry-protected topological (SSPT) phases while leaving the trivial phase invariant. These dualities are boundary-sensitive. On open lattices, both subsystem KW and KT transformations act as unitary, invertible operators. In particular, the KT map not only matches the bulk Hamiltonians of the dual phases but also carries the spontaneous ground-state degeneracy of the SSSB phase onto the protected boundary degeneracy of the SSPT phase. On closed manifolds, however, both maps become intrinsically non-unitary and non-invertible when restricted to the original Hilbert space. We demonstrate this non-invertibility via ground-state degeneracy matching (in two copies of the Xu-Moore/Ising-plaquette model), analysis of symmetry-twist sectors mapping, and the fusion algebra of the duality operator. Enlarging the Hilbert space to include twisted sectors allows the subsystem KW map to be formulated as a projective unitary preserving quantum transition probabilities, consistent with generalized Wigner-theorem-based constructions. We also show that the KT map faithfully transmits the algebraic content of bulk and edge invariants diagnosing strong SSPT order: although strictly local SSPT repair operators map to highly nonlocal objects in the dual SSSB phase, the essential commutation algebra and the bulk-edge correspondence remain intact."}

The increased electromechanical coupling in these compounds boosts the performance of high-frequency acoustic devices. So far, progress has largely focused on Al$_{1-x}$Sc$_x$N, which is costly and poorly compatible with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technologies. Here, we investigate aluminum hafnium nitride (Al$_{1-x}$Hf$_{x}$N) as a scalable and potentially CMOS-compatible alternative to Al$_{1-x}$Sc$_x$N. Using reactive co-sputtering on both Si and sapphire substrates, we demonstrate wurtzite Al$_{1-x}$Hf$_{x}$N thin films ($x \\leq 0.17$) with strong $c$-axis texture and nearly isotropic lattice expansion upon Hf incorporation. X-ray absorption spectroscopy indicates cross-gap hybridization between N 2$p$ and Hf 5$d$ states, which can enhance the Born effective charge and, thereby, the piezoelectric response. Correspondingly, we observe a nearly two-fold enhancement in the piezoelectric coefficient, $d_{33}$, relative to AlN, despite increasing structural disorder in Al$_{1-x}$Hf$_{x}$N. Building on this finding, we demonstrate Al$_{1-x}$Hf$_{x}$N GHz surface acoustic wave (SAW) resonators that exhibit enhanced performance, as well as efficient excitation of bulk acoustic waves with low propagation losses.

Ordered states such as charge density waves (CDWs) can be transiently melted by an ultrafast light excitation. This is also the case for the rare-earth tritelluride LaTe$_3$, a prototypical CDW compound. For this material it has recently been reported that the suppression of the primary CDW allows the transient formation of a second CDW, whose wave vector is orthogonal to the primary one. This creates the intriguing scenario where light enables switching between two distinct ordered phases of the material. While the second CDW has so far been observed by structural techniques, it remains an open question how the interplay of the two CDW phases is reflected in the material's electronic structure. We investigate this via time- and angle-resolved photoemission measurements of LaTe$_3$. The complex Fermi contour is probed using a FeSuMa analyzer, which records the photoemission intensity of the entire Fermi contour at once. The dynamics revealed by the FeSuMa analyzer are complemented by measurements using a conventional hemispherical electron analyzer. We combine conventional data analysis with $k$-means clustering, an unsupervised machine learning technique, demonstrating its strong potential for disentangling large datasets. While we do not find any features that cannot be explained by the melting and re-establishment of the primary CDW, distinct dynamics and coherent oscillations are observed in the different branches of the Fermi contour."}

Density functional theory calculations for bulk Co$_3$O$_4$ show that introducing an oxygen vacancy reduces two adjacent Co$^{3+}$ ions to Co$^{2+}$ and narrows the band gap. The newly formed Co$^{2+}$ ions adopt high-spin configurations in distorted octahedral sites and remain stable in this state in ab initio molecular dynamics simulations at $300$ K. Computed O and Co K-edge X-ray absorption spectra for ideal and vacancy-containing Co$_3$O$_4$ show excellent agreement with the experimental data and serve as references to analyze the liquid-phase ethylene glycol oxidation. The comparison with experimental O K-edge spectra of fresh and post-reaction catalysts shows that fresh samples resemble the vacancy-containing reference, whereas post-reaction spectra shift toward the ideal reference. These results suggest that under liquid-phase ethylene glycol oxidation conditions, Co$_3$O$_4$ becomes more oxidized rather than reduced, by refilling preexisting oxygen vacancies.

Here we present systematic studies of bias ARPES, where applying a sample bias expands the accessible momentum range and enables full 2$π$ solid angle collection in two dimension using our 6.994 eV laser source. An analytical conversion relation is established and validated to accurately map the detector angle to the emission angle and the electron momentum in two dimensions. A precise approach is developed to determine the sample work function which is critical in the angle-momentum conversion of the bias ARPES experiments. Energy and angular resolutions are preserved under biases up to 100 V, and minimizing beam size is shown to be crucial. The technique is effective both near normal and off-normal geometries, allowing flexible Brillouin zone access with lower biases.

Using time-resolved terahertz (THz) spectroscopy, near-band-gap excitation produces a pronounced temporal delay in photoconductivity, indicating that a fraction of photogenerated charge carriers is temporarily trapped immediately after excitation. By analyzing the frequency-resolved complex photoconductivity as a function of pump-probe delay and photon energy, we attribute this delay to the presence of a localized shallow state situated approximately 40 meV from the band edge, which competes with silicon's indirect band-to-band absorption. The zero-order kinetic profile of the temporal delay, its invariance with respect to photon flux, and its temperature dependence collectively support the existence of a phonon bottleneck that hinders the thermal release of electrons from this shallow trap. this represents experimental evidence of a phonon bottleneck effect associated with the thermal activation of shallow traps in photoexcited silicon.

Optical characterization, including steady-state absorption, photoluminescence (PL), and femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, reveals a systematic blueshift in emission energy with increasing FABr content, attributed to the passivation of bromine vacancies and to the reduction of defect-assisted recombination. Power-dependent PL confirms this interpretation: the stoichiometric film exhibits a PL band due to donor-acceptor pair (DAP) recombination as identified by the typical excitation-dependent blueshift, whereas FABr-enriched samples show no evidence of DAP emission, indicating effective defect passivation. Additionally, morphological characterization shows a reduction in grain size with increasing FABr excess, indicating a trade-off between improved electronic quality and enhanced structural disorder. The film synthesized with a 5% excess of FABr provides the optimal balance, yielding the highest power conversion efficiency (6.26%), average visible transmittance (61.6%), and light utilization efficiency (3.85%). These results demonstrate that fine-tuning the precursor stoichiometry through controlled FABr addition represents a simple yet effective strategy to enhance the optoelectronic quality and performance of semitransparent perovskite solar cells."}

We present a continuous-time path-integral Monte Carlo method for computing the low-lying spectrum of generic quantum Hamiltonians within a projection subspace. The method projects the thermal density matrix onto a subspace spanned by a chosen set of linearly independent states. It is free of Trotter discretization errors and systematically converges to the low-energy states which have finite overlap with the projection subspace as the $β$ parameter increases. While most effective for systems without a sign problem, the method also yields information about low-energy spectra when sign problems are present. We illustrate the approach on two problems. For the sign-free case, we compute the first four low-energy levels in the scaling limit of the one-dimensional Ising model with both transverse and longitudinal fields, demonstrating the flow from the conformal limit to the massive $E_8$ quantum field theory. For the sign-problem case, we apply the method to the frustrated Shastry-Sutherland model and benchmark it against exact diagonalization on small lattices. We also present results for larger systems beyond the lattice sizes accessible to exact diagonalization, while limited to small $β$ where sign problems occur.

In this work, we apply this simulation scheme to study the dependence of kinetic friction on sliding velocity. Using a prototypical diamond interface with varying hydrogen coverages, we find that the friction force decreases with increasing sliding velocity, revealing two distinct sliding regimes at low and high speeds.

Such materials are typically modeled using computationally expensive ab initio methods, but these approaches are greatly limited to small sample sizes. Here, we develop a highly efficient hard-particle packing algorithm to model large samples of these layered complex alloys that enables an accurate determination of the geometrical and topological properties of the B-site arrangements within the plane of the inorganic layers across length scales. Our results are in good agreement with various experiments, and therefore our algorithm bypasses the need for full-blown ab initio calculations. The accurate predictive power of our algorithm demonstrates how our minimalist hard-particle model effectively captures complex interactions and dynamics like incoherent thermal motion, out of plane octahedral tilting, and bond compression/stretching. We specifically show that the composition-dependent miscibility predicted by our algorithm for certain silver-iron and copper-indium layered alloys are consistent with previous experimental observations. We further quantify the degree of mixing in the simulated structures across length scales using our recently developed sensitive \"mixing\" metric. The large structural snapshots provided by our algorithm also shed light on previous experimentally measured magnetic properties of a copper-indium system. The generalization of our algorithm to model 3D perovskite alloys is also discussed.

Using an explicit SU(2) gauge field formalism, we derive the emergent magnetic field components generated by both conventional and spin-flux skyrmions. While conventional skyrmions exhibit a dominant $σ_z$ component with weak dipolar $σ_x, σ_y$ contributions, spin-flux skyrmions possess an additional monopolar $σ_x$ component that yields a finite average emergent field for a finite density of skyrmions. This nontrivial component introduces a nontrivial term in the Hall conductivity, enabling a direct explanation of experimental Hall resistivity anomalies that cannot be accounted for by conventional skyrmions alone. Moreover, we show that this additional term couples to the in-plane spin polarization of conduction electrons, providing a further tunable handle to control the transverse Hall response."}

Here, we develop a generic theory for the ARPES signature of trions in the model system of a monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD). We simulate the ARPES signals of both positively and negatively charged trions and show that the interaction of the residual holes, or electron and hole, lead to large energy shifts, on the order of the exciton binding energy, compared to the exciton signal. For positive trions, the additional momentum degree of freedom of the residual particles removes any strict lower bound on the photoemission energy, leading to distinctive asymmetric spectral features. For negative trions, the photoemission process causes the tr-ARPES spectrum to reproduce inverted images of the exciton band structure for multiple exciton states, encompassing both spin-allowed and spin-forbidden states, providing a direct momentum-resolved probe of both trion and exciton physics."}

In essence, this constraint requires each of the $K$-mers in use to be as lengthy as possible, given its surroundings in the resulting tiling. Maximality aims to limit the variety of possible tilings while allowing for interesting behavior in terms of the statistical physical observables of interest. In fact, by introducing an energy function based on cell contacts and parameterizing it appropriately, we have been able to observe relatively unexpected behavior, including the suggestion of phase transitions as the system's temperature evolves."}

Such interfaces are ubiquitous in materials, minerals, and compounds, with examples including grain boundaries in polycrystals and phase boundaries in multi-phase systems. Existing methodologies such as the topological model provide a framework for understanding the nature of coherency between two crystals and the line defect content within an interface. However, these methods only consider states of coherency achieved via affine transformations. Here we show that in some interfaces, local relaxations in the form of non-affine transformations lead to the introduction of additional coincidence sites within the interface; we term this class of interfaces as e-coherent. These non-affine relaxations are topologically equivalent to inserting disconnection (or disclination) dipoles or loops into the interface. Unlike traditional interfacial line defects, the defects associated with e-coherency cannot have long-range stress fields and their motion alters the state of coherency between the crystals. Given these unique properties, we differentiate them from other defects by referring to them as discohesions. Through atomistic simulations and transmission electron microscopy, we show that the energetics and kinetics of e-coherent interfaces are strongly affected by the discohesion content in the interface, leading to fundamentally different behaviors compared to non-e-coherent interfaces. We demonstrate e-coherency in grain, twin, and phase boundaries, and that a given interface can have multiple possible e-coherent states. These results suggest that e-coherency is likely to be pervasive in crystalline solids."}

Crucially, we develop an efficient determinant Quantum Monte Carlo algorithm that facilitates the evaluation of this indicator in interacting systems. We apply our approach to two paradigmatic models: for the Kane-Mele-Hubbard model, we successfully map the interaction-driven transition from a quantum spin Hall insulator to a trivial Mott insulator. Furthermore, our method circumvents the limitations imposed by the severe sign problem in the Haldane-Hubbard model, enabling robust identification of the quantum anomalous Hall phase at accessible temperatures.

However, the universal density functional is a very complicated mathematical object and almost always it is replaced with its approximate variants. So far, no ``first principles'', mathematically consistent and convergent approximation procedure has been devised that has general applicability. In this paper, we propose such a procedure by first applying Moreau--Yosida regularization to make the exact functionals continuous (even differentiable) and then approximate the regularized functional by a neural network.
