However, while these simulations are solved on a full 3D domain, most analysis only require a reduced set of metrics (e.g. plane-level concentrations). This work presents a hybrid physics-neural model that predicts scalar transport in a complex domain orders of magnitude faster than the 3D simulation (from hours to less than 1 min). This end-to-end differentiable framework jointly learns the physical model parameterization (i.e. orthotropic diffusivity) and a non-Markovian neural closure model to capture unresolved, 'coarse-grained' effects, thereby enabling stable, long time horizon rollouts. This proposed model is data-efficient (learning with 26 training data), and can be flexibly extended to an out-of-distribution scenario (with a moving source), achieving a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.96 at the final simulation time. Overall results show that this differentiable physics-neural framework enables fast, accurate, and generalizable coarse-grained surrogates for physical phenomena."}

By combining first-principles calculations with tight-binding analysis, we show that localized bonding between semiconductor surface dangling bonds and metal orbitals is sufficient to generate a large interface dipole and induce strong FLP, even when only a single metal monolayer is present. Within this framework, metal-induced gap states (MIGS), dangling-bond-induced surface states (DBSS), and bonding states embedded in the valence band are all understood as different outcomes of the same underlying interface bonding mechanism, rather than as independent causes of FLP. We further establish that the key parameter governing FLP strength is the density of surface dangling bonds that can form new chemical bonds with the metal, which directly controls the magnitude of the bond-induced interface dipole. This picture naturally explains the weaker pinning observed in more ionic semiconductors than in covalent ones and provides practical guidance for engineering metal-semiconductor interfaces and tuning Schottky barrier heights."}

Whereas standard studies almost exclusively focus on the explicit enigma that is presented by twist-angles, perhaps better epitomized by the related phenomena that have been observed in twisted bilayer graphene, functional devices necessarily face a fundamental concern: boundary heterogeneity in their structures. In this study, we address this concern by strictly investigating the electronic properties of twisted bismuth bilayers at the flake's edges and the vibrational properties of the flake. Twisted flakes exhibit continuous variations of these properties, away from the bulk, as we herein report using ab initio density functional theory, by systematically mapping the drastic evolution of band topology, electronic density of states, and possible superconductivity. Our work reveals a dramatic, non-fortuitous consequence of the structural disorder at the edges of the flakes: an enhanced electronic density of states at the Fermi level. This enhancement reaches a maximum of 10 times that of perfect-crystalline bismuth. Given that the superconducting critical temperature, Tc, is exponentially dependent on the electronic density of states at the Fermi level, this substantial structural variation immediately suggests a powerful mechanism for vastly increasing Tc. We also identify the twist-angle as a new critical parameter in designing novel engineering devices with topologically enhanced properties. Our results provide a necessary theoretical framework for interpreting new data for the upcoming generation of twistronic heterogeneous materials, and pave the way to search for atomic disordered metastable structures that could lead to enhanced superconducting transition temperatures."}

However, how superconductivity emerges alongside and competes with the pseudogap regime remains an open question. Here, we present a high-resolution, time- and angle-resolved photoemission study of the near-antinodal region of optimally-doped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+δ}$. For a sufficiently high excitation fluence, we disrupt superconductivity and drive a transient change from a symmetric superconducting-like to an asymmetric pseudogap-like density of states, for electronic temperatures well below the equilibrium superconducting critical temperature. Conversely, when the superconductivity is fully restored, the pseudogap is suppressed, as signaled by a fully particle-hole symmetric density of states. A unique aspect of our experiments is that the pseudogap coexists with superconducting features at intermediate times or at intermediate fluence. Our findings challenge the paradigm that superconductivity emerges by establishing phase coherence in the pseudogap. Instead, our experimental results, supported by phenomenological theory, demonstrate that the two states compete, and that the low-temperature ground state of the cuprates originates from a competition between superconducting and pseudogap states."}

Here, we present a bottom-up multiscale workflow that integrates AIMD, machine-learned force fields (MLFFs), and Markov state models (MSMs) to establish a quantitatively consistent link between atomistic hopping mechanisms and mesoscale transport. MLFFs fine-tuned on AIMD reference data retain near-DFT accuracy while enabling large-scale molecular dynamics simulations extending to tens of nanoseconds. These extended trajectories remove the strong finite-size bias present in AIMD and yield diffusion coefficients in excellent agreement with experiment.

The resulting MSMs faithfully reproduce mean-square displacements and recover rare diffusion processes that do not occur on AIMD timescales. In addition to propagating lithium distributions, the MSM transition matrices provide mechanistic insight: their eigenvalues and eigenvectors encode characteristic relaxation timescales and dominant transport pathways.

By quantifying how fluctuations at distinct spatial or temporal points are related, correlation functions reveal the structural organization of complex systems. Here, we revisit the theoretical foundations of these correlations in systems undergoing second-order phase transitions, with emphasis on the Ising model extended to non-integer spatial dimensions. Starting from the classical framework introduced by Fisher, we discuss how the standard Euclidean treatment, restricted to integer dimensions, necessitates the introduction of the critical exponent $η$ to capture the spatial decay of correlations at $T=T_c$. We suppose that, at criticality, the equilibrium dynamics become effectively confined to the fractal edge of spin clusters. Within this framework, the fractal dimension that governs the correlations in that subspace is directly related to Fisher exponent, which quantifies the singular behavior of the correlation function near criticality. Importantly, this correlation fractal dimension is distinct from the fractal dimension associated with the order parameter. We further derive an explicit geometrical relation connecting the two fractal dimensions, thereby linking spatial self-similarity to the observed scaling behavior at criticality. This treatment naturally extends to non-integer spatial dimensions, which remain valid below the upper critical dimension and produce the correct value of Fisher exponent $η$ for a continuous space dimension. Our analysis also confirms that the Rushbrooke scaling relation, continues to hold when the spatial dimension is treated as a continuous parameter, reinforcing the universality of critical scaling and underscoring the role of fractal geometry in characterizing correlations at criticality."}

Unlike single-layer systems, these bilayers exhibit two distinct modes, $ω_{\\pm}$, which show characteristic dependences upon the momentum and hopping integrals along the $z$ direction. To apply them to cuprates, strong correlation effects should be considered, but a comprehensive analysis has not yet been investigated. In this work, we present a strong-coupling theory to analyze the charge dynamics of a bilayer system, utilizing the $t$-$J$-$V$ model, which includes the long-range Coulomb interaction, $V$, on a lattice. Although our theoretical framework is fundamentally different from the weak-coupling approach, we find that resulting plasmon excitations are similar to those of a weak-coupling theory. A key distinction is that our strong-coupling framework reveals a noticeable suppression of particle-hole excitations, which allows the plasmon modes to remain well-defined over a wider region of momentum. We suggest that the experimentally reported plasmon excitations in Y-based cuprates can be described by the $ω_{-}$ mode, although we call for more systematic experiments to verify this."}

We consider this issue by investigating attosecond extreme ultraviolet (XUV) transient absorption spectroscopy at the Br M4,5 3d$_{3/2,5/2}$ edges (66 to 80 eV), tracking core-to-valence (3d to 4p) and core-to-Rydberg (3d to ns, np, n $\\geq$ 5) transitions from the molecular to atomic limit. The progress of dissociation can be ascertained by the buildup of the atomic absorption in time. Notably, the measured rise times of the 3d$_{3/2,5/2}$ to 4p transitions depend on the probed core level final state, 38 $\\pm$ 1 and 20 $\\pm$ 5 fs for $^{2}$D$_{5/2}$ and $^{2}$D$_{3/2}$ at 64.31 and 65.34 eV, respectively. Simulations by the nuclear time-dependent Schrödinger equation reproduce the rise-time difference of the 3d to 4p transitions, and the theory suggests several important factors. One is the transition dipole moments of each probe transition have different molecular and atomic values for $^{2}$D$_{5/2}$ versus $^{2}$D$_{3/2}$ that depend on the bond length. The other is the merger of multiple molecular absorptions into the same atomic absorption, creating multiple timescales even for a single probe transition. Unfortunately, the core-to-Rydberg absorptions did not allow accurate atomic Br buildup times to be extracted due to spectral overlaps with ground state bleaching, otherwise an even more comprehensive picture of the role of the probe state transition would be possible. This work shows that the measured probe signals accurately contain the dissociative wavepacket dynamics but also reveal how the specific probe transition affects the apparent progress toward dissociation with bond length. Such potential probe-transition-dependent effects need to be considered when interpreting measured signals and their timescales."}

While Monte Carlo methods are traditionally used to simulate such systems, their sampling efficiency is limited by the complexity of interactions and ground-state properties. Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), a class of probabilistic neural networks, offer improved sampling by incorporating machine learning techniques. However, fully-connected bipartite RBMs are inefficient for representing physical lattices with sparse interactions. To address this, we implement Convolutional Restricted Boltzmann Machines (CRBMs) that leverage translational symmetry inherent to lattices. Using the classical Shastry-Sutherland (SS) Ising lattice, we demonstrate (i) CRBM formulation that captures SS interactions, and (ii) digital hardware accelerator to enhance sampling performance. We simulate lattices with up to 324 spins, recovering all known phases of the SS Ising model, including the long range ordered fractional plateau. Our hardware characterizes spin behavior at critical points and within spin liquid phases. This implementation achieves a speedup of 3 to 5 orders of magnitude (33 ns to 120 ms) over GPU-based implementations. Moreover, the time-to-solution is within two orders of magnitude of quantum annealers, while offering superior scalability, room-temperature operation and reprogrammability.

The maximum value exceeds the uniform heating case by up to 27%, which is attributed to the spatially varying fraction of unscattered phonons emitted from hotspots.

Here we derive an effective low-energy description of such a system near the Mott insulating regime, starting from the multi-orbital Hubbard-Kanamori Hamiltonian and projecting onto the high-spin manifold favored by Hund's first rule. The resulting Hund-projected Kanamori model captures the interplay between carrier motion and magnetic correlations in the presence of strong Hund's coupling. In the undoped limit, the model reduces to a spin-$N/2$ Heisenberg system with suppressed quantum fluctuations, approaching the classical limit for realistic five-band configurations. Upon doping, carrier motion couples strongly to the spin background and drives ferromagnetic correlations through a Hund-enhanced kinetic mechanism analogous to, but much stronger than, Nagaoka ferromagnetism. Owing to its reduced sign problem, the model can be addressed with advanced path-integral methods to determine quasiparticle structure and effective interactions between carriers-quantities that are challenging to obtain with other methods.

In this context, realization of the tetragonal phase at ambient pressure could be a rational step to achieve the goal of ambient-pressure HTSC in the nickelate system. By employing the concept of Goldschmidt tolerance factor, we succeed in stabilizing the tetragonal phase by aluminum doping together with post annealing under moderately high oxygen pressure.

However, exploring the wave phenomena in these systems is elusive due to the weak dipolar coupling that governs their interactions. In this study, we demonstrate coherent spin-wave propagation in an hybrid ASI system, which is based on a multilayered ferromagnetic thin film with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and in-plane magnetized nanoelements embedded within it. We show that this system enables spin-wave transmission over a one-micrometer distance via exchange-mediated coupling between subsystems and evanescent spin-wave tunneling through the out-of-plane magnetized parts. This system overcomes the limitations of purely dipolar interactions in standard ASIs while preserving their fundamental properties. Thus, it provides a platform for studying spin-wave phenomena in frustrated ASI systems and paves the way for exploiting them in analog signal processing with spin waves."}

However, these bounds inevitably become loose in symmetry broken phases, where local constraints are insufficient to capture long-range order. In this work, we identify the origin of this looseness as order parameter defects which are difficult to remove using local operators. We introduce a $\\textit{defect bootstrap}$ framework that resolves this limitation by embedding the system into an auxiliary $\\textit{defect model}$ equipped with ancilla degrees of freedom. This construction effectively enables local operators to remove order parameter defects, yielding tighter bounds in phases with spontaneous symmetry breaking. This approach can be applied broadly to pairwise-interacting local lattice models with discrete or continuous internal symmetries that satisfy a property we call $\\textit{defect diamagnetism}$, which requires that the ground state energy does not decrease upon adding any finite number of symmetry defects. Applying the method to the transverse field Ising models in 1D and 2D, we obtain significantly improved bounds on energy densities and spin correlation functions throughout the symmetry broken phase in 1D and deep within the phase in 2D. Our results demonstrate that physically motivated constraint sets can dramatically enhance the power of bootstrap methods for quantum many-body systems."}

Whereas standard studies almost exclusively focus on the explicit enigma that is presented by twist-angles, perhaps better epitomized by the related phenomena that have been observed in twisted bilayer graphene, functional devices necessarily face a fundamental concern: boundary heterogeneity in their structures. In this study, we address this concern by strictly investigating the electronic properties of twisted bismuth bilayers at the flake's edges and the vibrational properties of the flake. Twisted flakes exhibit continuous variations of these properties, away from the bulk, as we herein report using ab initio density functional theory, by systematically mapping the drastic evolution of band topology, electronic density of states, and possible superconductivity. Our work reveals a dramatic, non-fortuitous consequence of the structural disorder at the edges of the flakes: an enhanced electronic density of states at the Fermi level. This enhancement reaches a maximum of 10 times that of perfect-crystalline bismuth. Given that the superconducting critical temperature, Tc, is exponentially dependent on the electronic density of states at the Fermi level, this substantial structural variation immediately suggests a powerful mechanism for vastly increasing Tc. We also identify the twist-angle as a new critical parameter in designing novel engineering devices with topologically enhanced properties. Our results provide a necessary theoretical framework for interpreting new data for the upcoming generation of twistronic heterogeneous materials, and pave the way to search for atomic disordered metastable structures that could lead to enhanced superconducting transition temperatures."}

However, how superconductivity emerges alongside and competes with the pseudogap regime remains an open question. Here, we present a high-resolution, time- and angle-resolved photoemission study of the near-antinodal region of optimally-doped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+δ}$. For a sufficiently high excitation fluence, we disrupt superconductivity and drive a transient change from a symmetric superconducting-like to an asymmetric pseudogap-like density of states, for electronic temperatures well below the equilibrium superconducting critical temperature. Conversely, when the superconductivity is fully restored, the pseudogap is suppressed, as signaled by a fully particle-hole symmetric density of states. A unique aspect of our experiments is that the pseudogap coexists with superconducting features at intermediate times or at intermediate fluence. Our findings challenge the paradigm that superconductivity emerges by establishing phase coherence in the pseudogap. Instead, our experimental results, supported by phenomenological theory, demonstrate that the two states compete, and that the low-temperature ground state of the cuprates originates from a competition between superconducting and pseudogap states."}

Here we derive an effective low-energy description of such a system near the Mott insulating regime, starting from the multi-orbital Hubbard-Kanamori Hamiltonian and projecting onto the high-spin manifold favored by Hund's first rule. The resulting Hund-projected Kanamori model captures the interplay between carrier motion and magnetic correlations in the presence of strong Hund's coupling. In the undoped limit, the model reduces to a spin-$N/2$ Heisenberg system with suppressed quantum fluctuations, approaching the classical limit for realistic five-band configurations. Upon doping, carrier motion couples strongly to the spin background and drives ferromagnetic correlations through a Hund-enhanced kinetic mechanism analogous to, but much stronger than, Nagaoka ferromagnetism. Owing to its reduced sign problem, the model can be addressed with advanced path-integral methods to determine quasiparticle structure and effective interactions between carriers-quantities that are challenging to obtain with other methods. This framework establishes a microscopic bridge between the Kanamori model and the emergent magnetic and transport phenomena characteristic of Hund's metals."}

Here, we introduce a committor-based workflow that integrates a path-committor-consistent artificial neural network (PCCANN) with an iteratively trained hybrid-DFT-level message passing atomic convolutional encoder (MACE) potential. Beginning with a static nudged elastic band path, PCCANN extracts a committor-consistent string to represent the reactive ensemble. We illustrate the power of this methodology through two representative applications. First, we investigate an SNAr reaction using MACE trained at hybrid DFT level with implicit solvent. The mechanism is found to be concerted, and the dynamic approach reveals a lower barrier than static treatments. Second, we apply the same protocol to the isomerization of protonated isobutanol to protonated 2-butanol, yielding a quantitatively accurate free-energy landscape. We uncover three competing channels: the established concerted mechanism and two asynchronous stepwise routes mediated by water and methyl transfer, all with comparable activation barriers. Notably, the stepwise pathways traverse metastable intermediates that, to the best of our knowledge, have not been described in prior mechanistic studies. Calculated barrier heights and intermediate stabilities are in close agreement with high-level DFT benchmarks, demonstrating the framework's accuracy. Together, these studies highlight mechanistic diversity across distinct systems and establish the synergistic PCCANN-MACE protocol as a proof-of-concept approach for committor-based discovery of complex reaction dynamics."}

This theoretical prediction typically relies on an oversimplified model, where both the nanowire and the superconductor are idealized as one-dimensional systems. In reality, heterostructures have finite sizes that deviate from this idealization-and as a result, smoking-gun evidence confirming the existence of these zero modes remains elusive. Here, we investigate the finite-size effects of both the nanowire and the superconductor, and optimize their sizes to ensure that only one Majorana fermion exists at each end of the heterostructure. It is discovered that the optimal transverse sizes of the nanowire are less than 100nm in width and approximately 1nm in thickness. For the superconductor layer, its optimal thickness (a key aspect of its size) must exceed its coherence length. We also present the optimal sizes of the two types of materials used in the experiment in a quantitative manner. Notably, the identified optimal thickness of the superconductor (Al films, $\\sim$1000nm)--a critical size parameter--is two orders of magnitude larger than the thickness of Al films currently utilized in experimental devices (e.g., InSb-Al and InAs-Al heterostructures). Our findings could explain why Majorana fermions have not been observed in current experiments, and offer guidance for the size selection of heterostructures to implement Majorana fermions in future studies."}

Unlike single-layer systems, these bilayers exhibit two distinct modes, $ω_{\\pm}$, which show characteristic dependences upon the momentum and hopping integrals along the $z$ direction. To apply them to cuprates, strong correlation effects should be considered, but a comprehensive analysis has not yet been investigated. In this work, we present a strong-coupling theory to analyze the charge dynamics of a bilayer system, utilizing the $t$-$J$-$V$ model, which includes the long-range Coulomb interaction, $V$, on a lattice. Although our theoretical framework is fundamentally different from the weak-coupling approach, we find that resulting plasmon excitations are similar to those of a weak-coupling theory. A key distinction is that our strong-coupling framework reveals a noticeable suppression of particle-hole excitations, which allows the plasmon modes to remain well-defined over a wider region of momentum. We suggest that the experimentally reported plasmon excitations in Y-based cuprates can be described by the $ω_{-}$ mode, although we call for more systematic experiments to verify this."}

The method is implemented by dressing a Wannier-interpolated Hamiltonian with the field through its position matrix elements, which allows the gate bias to modify orbital hybridization and band dispersion beyond perturbative treatments. Within the independent-particle approximation, the resulting second-order (shift) conductivity is evaluated for both centrosymmetric and non-centrosymmetric layered systems. Applied to MoS$_2$, the approach captures the emergence of a finite shift current in centrosymmetric bilayers and the tunability of intrinsic responses in polar structures. The shift conductivity rises linearly at small fields and saturates at higher intensities, reflecting the competition between the growing shift vector and the weakening interband coupling as resonant transitions move away from high-symmetry valleys. A Taylor expansion of the field-dressed conductivity connects this behavior to the third-order optical response, revealing a unified picture of field-induced nonlinearities. These results establish field dressing of Wannier Hamiltonians as a practical route to model and predict nonlinear photocurrents in layered materials."}

Dissipation and pumping are introduced via local linear Lindblad jump operators and treated exactly using the third--quantization / Majorana covariance formalism. Focusing on periodic boundary conditions (to avoid edge artefacts) we compute the Liouvillian rapidities and their smallest nonzero real part (the rapidity gap) for several spatial dissipation patterns: uniform (all), single--site (one--site) and two--site (two--site) placement, plus pairwise gain/loss on helical partner sites. We show that uniform dissipation yields large, weakly lambda--dependent gaps, while sparse local dissipation produces gaps that shrink rapidly as the quasiperiodic potential lambda induces localization. Increasing t_N enhances relaxation by improving mode overlap with dissipative channels. Finite--size scaling, rapidity level statistics (Poisson vs Wigner--Dyson), and spatial profiles of slow modes provide a consistent picture linking Liouvillian spectral structure to transport and localization.

In order to explore layer dependent magnetic behavior, in general, mechanically exfoliated flakes from high-quality single crystals are used. It is crucial to determine the number of layers of these materials accurately. In the absence of an efficient and quick method, researchers often rely on atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging to identify their number of layers. In this work, we report an optical contrast study as a quick and cost-effective technique to determine the number of layers of Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ (FGT). Here, we observed a linear relationship between the optical contrast (derived from optical microscopic images) observed for mechanically exfoliated FGT nano-flakes and their thickness, as measured by the AFM imaging method. This technique requires no additional equipment; it relies solely on a conventional optical microscope. Additionally, our results reveal a thickness-dependent evolution of the intensity; in contrast, the Raman frequency demonstrates no significant dependence on layer thickness. Also, our studies reveal two additional Raman modes of FGT, at the frequency of 129\\,cm$^-1$ \\& 190\\,cm$^-1$. Both modes show the intensity dependence on the thickness of FGT, same as out-of-plane (A$_{1g}$) Raman modes."}

Here we derive an effective low-energy description of such a system near the Mott insulating regime, starting from the multi-orbital Hubbard-Kanamori Hamiltonian and projecting onto the high-spin manifold favored by Hund's first rule. The resulting Hund-projected Kanamori model captures the interplay between carrier motion and magnetic correlations in the presence of strong Hund's coupling. In the undoped limit, the model reduces to a spin-$N/2$ Heisenberg system with suppressed quantum fluctuations, approaching the classical limit for realistic five-band configurations. Upon doping, carrier motion couples strongly to the spin background and drives ferromagnetic correlations through a Hund-enhanced kinetic mechanism analogous to, but much stronger than, Nagaoka ferromagnetism. Owing to its reduced sign problem, the model can be addressed with advanced path-integral methods to determine quasiparticle structure and effective interactions between carriers-quantities that are challenging to obtain with other methods. This framework establishes a microscopic bridge between the Kanamori model and the emergent magnetic and transport phenomena characteristic of Hund's metals."}

Dirichlet boundary conditions imposed on the field at the wall give rise to a repulsive fluctuation-induced force acting on the particle, causing a shift in its average position and a renormalization of the strength of the harmonic trap. We describe the effective overdamped dynamics of the particle, which features a nonlinear memory term depending on the wall-particle separation. We show that the two-time correlation function of the particle position features a memory-induced term that depends on the distance of the particle from the wall. At the critical point, this term decays algebraically upon increasing time and it displays a crossover from the behavior observed in the bulk to that corresponding to having the particle at the wall."}

We develop an approach to assign irreducible-representation labels to excitonic states, providing a state-of-the-art framework for analysing their symmetries and selection rules (including, for example, the case of exciton-phonon coupling). Complementary to the symmetry classification, we introduce the concept of total crystal angular momentum for excitons in the presence of rotational symmetries, allowing the derivation of conservation laws. Furthermore, we demonstrate how these symmetry properties can be exploited to greatly enhance the computational efficiency of exciton calculations with the BSE. We apply our methodology to three prototypical systems to understand the role of symmetries in different contexts: (i) For LiF, we present the symmetry analysis of the entire excitonic dispersion and examine the selection rules for optical absorption. (ii) In the calculation of resonant Raman spectra of monolayer MoSe2, we demonstrate how the conservation of total crystal angular momentum governs exciton-phonon interactions, leading to the observed resonant enhancement. (iii) In bulk hBN, we analyze the role of symmetries for the coupling of finite-momentum excitons to finite-momentum phonons and their manifestation in the phonon-assisted luminescence spectra.

Performing finite-size scaling analyzes, we obtain the model's ground state phase diagram, which includes the semi-metal (SM), Kekulé Valence Bond Solid (KVBS), and anti-ferromagnetic (AFM) phases, as well as indications of a small KVBS/AFM coexistence region. We find that a weak to moderate Hubbard repulsion, tuned toward the SM-AFM critical value in the pure honeycomb Hubbard model, enhances KVBS correlations and can even stabilize the KVBS phase. Estimating the effective parameters for graphene places it in the SM region of the phase diagram, but near the SM-KVBS phase boundary.

Humid air promotes the formation of LiOH as the discharge product, creating a highly alkaline environment on the surface of cathode and solid-state electrolyte.

By quantifying how fluctuations at distinct spatial or temporal points are related, correlation functions reveal the structural organization of complex systems. Here, we revisit the theoretical foundations of these correlations in systems undergoing second-order phase transitions, with emphasis on the Ising model extended to non-integer spatial dimensions. Starting from the classical framework introduced by Fisher, we discuss how the standard Euclidean treatment, restricted to integer dimensions, necessitates the introduction of the critical exponent $η$ to capture the spatial decay of correlations at $T=T_c$. We suppose that, at criticality, the equilibrium dynamics become effectively confined to the fractal edge of spin clusters. Within this framework, the fractal dimension that governs the correlations in that subspace is directly related to Fisher exponent, which quantifies the singular behavior of the correlation function near criticality. Importantly, this correlation fractal dimension is distinct from the fractal dimension associated with the order parameter. We further derive an explicit geometrical relation connecting the two fractal dimensions, thereby linking spatial self-similarity to the observed scaling behavior at criticality. This treatment naturally extends to non-integer spatial dimensions, which remain valid below the upper critical dimension and produce the correct value of Fisher exponent $η$ for a continuous space dimension. Our analysis also confirms that the Rushbrooke scaling relation, continues to hold when the spatial dimension is treated as a continuous parameter, reinforcing the universality of critical scaling and underscoring the role of fractal geometry in characterizing correlations at criticality."}

However, these bounds inevitably become loose in symmetry broken phases, where local constraints are insufficient to capture long-range order. In this work, we identify the origin of this looseness as order parameter defects which are difficult to remove using local operators. We introduce a $\\textit{defect bootstrap}$ framework that resolves this limitation by embedding the system into an auxiliary $\\textit{defect model}$ equipped with ancilla degrees of freedom. This construction effectively enables local operators to remove order parameter defects, yielding tighter bounds in phases with spontaneous symmetry breaking. This approach can be applied broadly to pairwise-interacting local lattice models with discrete or continuous internal symmetries that satisfy a property we call $\\textit{defect diamagnetism}$, which requires that the ground state energy does not decrease upon adding any finite number of symmetry defects. Applying the method to the transverse field Ising models in 1D and 2D, we obtain significantly improved bounds on energy densities and spin correlation functions throughout the symmetry broken phase in 1D and deep within the phase in 2D. Our results demonstrate that physically motivated constraint sets can dramatically enhance the power of bootstrap methods for quantum many-body systems."}

This phenomenon can emerge in an overdamped system, but it may also be inertia-induced. Here, we considerably extend previous studies and comprehensively investigate the impact of inertia on the effect of free transport enhancement observed in the overdamped system. We detect that inertia can not only induce this phenomenon, but depending on a parameter regime, it may also strengthen, weaken, or even destroy it. We exemplify these different scenarios and explore the parameter space to identify the corresponding regions where they emerge. The variance of the active fluctuations amplitude distribution is a key determinant of the inertia influence on the effect of free transport amplification. Our results are relevant not only for microscopic physical systems but also for biological ones, such as, e.g., living cells, where fluctuations generated by metabolic activities are active by default."}

It has been argued that the parameter regime with antiferromagnetic couplings on hexagons $J_h$ and ferromagnetic couplings on triangles $J_t$ and dimer $J_d$ bonds, is potentially host to a cornucopia of emergent phases with unconventional orders. Our analysis indeed identifies an extended region where any conventional dipolar magnetic order is absent. A hexagonal singlet state is found in the region around $J_{d}=J_{t}=0$, while a dimerized hexagonal singlet order of a lattice nematic character appears proximate to the phase boundary with the c$120^\\circ$ antiferromagnetic order. Interestingly, upon traversing the bulk of the paramagnetic (PM) region, we find a variety of distinct correlation profiles, which are qualitatively different from those of the hexagonal singlet and dimerized hexagonal singlet orders but feature no appreciable spin-nematic response, while the boundary with the ferromagnetic phase shows evidence of spin-nematic order. This PM region is thus likely host to an ensemble of nonmagnetic phases which could putatively include quantum spin liquids. Our phase diagram is built from a complementary application of state-of-the-art implementations of the cluster mean-field and pseudo-fermion functional renormalization group approaches, together with an unconstrained Luttinger-Tisza treatment of the model providing insights from the semi-classical limit."}

While Monte Carlo methods are traditionally used to simulate such systems, their sampling efficiency is limited by the complexity of interactions and ground-state properties. Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), a class of probabilistic neural networks, offer improved sampling by incorporating machine learning techniques. However, fully-connected bipartite RBMs are inefficient for representing physical lattices with sparse interactions. To address this, we implement Convolutional Restricted Boltzmann Machines (CRBMs) that leverage translational symmetry inherent to lattices. Using the classical Shastry-Sutherland (SS) Ising lattice, we demonstrate (i) CRBM formulation that captures SS interactions, and (ii) digital hardware accelerator to enhance sampling performance. We simulate lattices with up to 324 spins, recovering all known phases of the SS Ising model, including the long range ordered fractional plateau. Our hardware characterizes spin behavior at critical points and within spin liquid phases. This implementation achieves a speedup of 3 to 5 orders of magnitude (33 ns to 120 ms) over GPU-based implementations. Moreover, the time-to-solution is within two orders of magnitude of quantum annealers, while offering superior scalability, room-temperature operation and reprogrammability.

This phenomenon can emerge in an overdamped system, but it may also be inertia-induced. Here, we considerably extend previous studies and comprehensively investigate the impact of inertia on the effect of free transport enhancement observed in the overdamped system. We detect that inertia can not only induce this phenomenon, but depending on a parameter regime, it may also strengthen, weaken, or even destroy it. We exemplify these different scenarios and explore the parameter space to identify the corresponding regions where they emerge. The variance of the active fluctuations amplitude distribution is a key determinant of the inertia influence on the effect of free transport amplification. Our results are relevant not only for microscopic physical systems but also for biological ones, such as, e.g., living cells, where fluctuations generated by metabolic activities are active by default."}

Here, we present a high-resolution, time- and angle-resolved photoemission study of the near-antinodal region of optimally-doped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+δ}$. For a sufficiently high excitation fluence, we disrupt superconductivity and drive a transient change from a symmetric superconducting-like to an asymmetric pseudogap-like density of states, for electronic temperatures well below the equilibrium superconducting critical temperature. Conversely, when the superconductivity is fully restored, the pseudogap is suppressed, as signaled by a fully particle-hole symmetric density of states. A unique aspect of our experiments is that the pseudogap coexists with superconducting features at intermediate times or at intermediate fluence. Our findings challenge the paradigm that superconductivity emerges by establishing phase coherence in the pseudogap. Instead, our experimental results, supported by phenomenological theory, demonstrate that the two states compete, and that the low-temperature ground state of the cuprates originates from a competition between superconducting and pseudogap states."}

Reliable first-principles modelling of the photovoltaic alpha-phase is further complicated by inconsistent structural models and levels of theory in the literature. Here, we identify the structural and electronic requirements needed for a physically sound description of alpha-FASnI3, whose behaviour is governed by a pseudo-Jahn-Teller (PJT) instability arising from the stereochemically active Sn(II) lone pair.\n  Using 0 K relaxations, cross-code hybrid-functional benchmarks, and finite-temperature ab initio molecular dynamics, we show that a 4x4x4 supercell with randomly oriented FA+ cations is the smallest model that removes macroscopic dipoles, preserves cubic symmetry, recovers local octahedral tilts, and captures the characteristic PJT-driven Sn off-centering. Accurate band edges and a reliable band gap require a PBE0-level hybrid functional with spin-orbit coupling to treat Sn relativistic effects, together with nonlocal dispersion (rVV10) to capture the enhanced Sn-I covalency. Finite-temperature simulations reveal that Sn off-centering remains local, <111>-oriented, and robust against thermal fluctuations, and that reproducing the experimental 300 K band gap requires a 6x6x6 supercell.

In order to explore layer dependent magnetic behavior, in general, mechanically exfoliated flakes from high-quality single crystals are used. It is crucial to determine the number of layers of these materials accurately. In the absence of an efficient and quick method, researchers often rely on atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging to identify their number of layers. In this work, we report an optical contrast study as a quick and cost-effective technique to determine the number of layers of Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ (FGT). Here, we observed a linear relationship between the optical contrast (derived from optical microscopic images) observed for mechanically exfoliated FGT nano-flakes and their thickness, as measured by the AFM imaging method. This technique requires no additional equipment; it relies solely on a conventional optical microscope. Additionally, our results reveal a thickness-dependent evolution of the intensity; in contrast, the Raman frequency demonstrates no significant dependence on layer thickness. Also, our studies reveal two additional Raman modes of FGT, at the frequency of 129\\,cm$^-1$ \\& 190\\,cm$^-1$.

In this context, realization of the tetragonal phase at ambient pressure could be a rational step to achieve the goal of ambient-pressure HTSC in the nickelate system.

As a direct consequence of our formalism, we introduce a hierarchical construction that organizes orbital and heat magnetizations into distinct physical contributions accessible through sum rules, and also derive real-space markers of these magnetizations. From an experimental standpoint, we propose concrete implementations of thermoelectric dichroic measurements in quantum-engineered platforms based on modulated strain fields. These results establish thermoelectric dichroic measurements as a versatile route to access and disentangle fundamental ground-state properties."}

Unlike the conventional longitudinal Seebeck effect, transverse thermoelectric (TE) effects like the Nernst effect have attracted growing interest due to their unique transverse geometry and potential advantages. Here, we report the observation of a significant transverse thermoelectric conductivity alpha A_zx of 15 A K-1m-1 at low temperatures, together with a pronounced anomalous Nernst effect in the Kagome antiferromagnet FeGe, which exhibits a charge density wave inside the antiferromagnetic (AFM) state. This value is the highest record among known AFM materials. Furthermore, the thermopower at 14 T increases by 102-104% around the canted-AFM (CAFM) transition temperature, Tcant, comparable to that of the well-known AFM thermoelectric materials. These effects are attributed to large Berry curvature arising from the non-collinear spin texture in FeGe, highlighting its potential for enhancing thermoelectric performance and its candidacy for magneto-TE applications in Kagome antiferromagnetic materials."}

Millimeter-scale perovskite crystals can be synthesized as a continuous film through methylamine treatment, with nucleation sites directed by pre-patterned seeds. Nonetheless, certain configurations may lead to unwanted parasitic nucleation. To predict and mitigate this effect, we employ phase-field simulations alongside an analytical model. Their predictive capability is demonstrated across three distinct material-substrate systems, enabling precise control over nucleation and subsequent crystal growth. Notably, the only material-specific input required is the nucleation density (i.e., the number of crystals nucleated per unit area on an unpatterned substrate). This generality makes the models broadly applicable to diverse material systems for achieving controlled two-dimensional crystallization for improved optoelectronic device performance."}

However, the nature of proton pairing and its impact on conduction remain insufficiently understood theoretically. Here, through quantitative computational analysis of proton-proton interactions in Y-doped BaZrO3, we identify lattice-distortion-mediated elastic interaction as the key factor determining whether two protons form a stable pair or exhibit net repulsion. When a proton resides at an inward-bending distortion site induced by another proton, the resulting net repulsive interaction leads to an unstable configuration. In contrast, the proton tends to be trapped at a nearby outward-bending site that favors the formation of a stable proton pair. Moreover, the site where the two protons form the lowest-energy configuration also corresponds to a proton trapping site. By calculating the long-range diffusion pathways accessible to protons under different local environments in both single- and two-proton cases, we find that the range of rate-limiting barriers is 0.24-0.45 eV for two-proton conduction and 0.19-0.39 eV for single-proton conduction. The higher and more experimentally consistent barriers in the two-proton pathways indicate that the proton trapping effect induced by pairing hinders proton conduction. Our study elucidates the multi-proton diffusion mechanism, providing a theoretical foundation for the experimental design of electrolytes with enhanced proton conductivity."}

Trained on a Density Functional Theory (DFT) dataset of atomic configurations, energies, forces, and virials, the potential is designed to address the issue of H-induced acceleration of mechanical failure of metals, generally known as hydrogen embrittlement (HE). The proposed potential is shown to outperform the widely used classical and machine-learned interatomic potentials in fundamental properties of the $α$-Fe-H system. We show that the tabGAP model reproduces H-point defect properties, H-dislocation interaction, H-H interaction, and elastic constants with nearly DFT-level accuracy at a computational cost that is competitive with the efficient classical Embedded Atom Method (EAM) potentials. We further demonstrate the utility of the tabGAP model in molecular dynamics simulations of tensile tests of a perfect, and a $(111)[11\\bar{2}]$-notched $α$-Fe structure with and without the load of H atoms. The simulations show evidence of HE via observation of accelerated decohesion of Fe atoms at the tip of the notch, and an increase in vacancy concentration driven by H-dislocation interactions. Hence, the results of the presented simulations support the hypotheses of hydrogen-enhanced decohesion (HEDE) alongside hydrogen-enhanced strain induced vacancies (HESIV) as important mechanisms for H-induced mechanical failure of iron systems."}

The local thermal conductivity is proposed to describe the non-uniform spatial distribution of heat transport capability in nanoscale multiple hotspot systems. The maximum value exceeds the uniform heating case by up to 27%, which is attributed to the spatially varying fraction of unscattered phonons emitted from hotspots. Moreover, the effects and mechanisms of hotspot spacing on thermal transport are investigated, showing that reducing the hotspot spacing can enhance the heat flux by up to 40%.

By combining first-principles calculations with tight-binding analysis, we show that localized bonding between semiconductor surface dangling bonds and metal orbitals is sufficient to generate a large interface dipole and induce strong FLP, even when only a single metal monolayer is present. Within this framework, metal-induced gap states (MIGS), dangling-bond-induced surface states (DBSS), and bonding states embedded in the valence band are all understood as different outcomes of the same underlying interface bonding mechanism, rather than as independent causes of FLP. We further establish that the key parameter governing FLP strength is the density of surface dangling bonds that can form new chemical bonds with the metal, which directly controls the magnitude of the bond-induced interface dipole. This picture naturally explains the weaker pinning observed in more ionic semiconductors than in covalent ones and provides practical guidance for engineering metal-semiconductor interfaces and tuning Schottky barrier heights."}

Here, we introduce a committor-based workflow that integrates a path-committor-consistent artificial neural network (PCCANN) with an iteratively trained hybrid-DFT-level message passing atomic convolutional encoder (MACE) potential. Beginning with a static nudged elastic band path, PCCANN extracts a committor-consistent string to represent the reactive ensemble. We illustrate the power of this methodology through two representative applications. First, we investigate an SNAr reaction using MACE trained at hybrid DFT level with implicit solvent. The mechanism is found to be concerted, and the dynamic approach reveals a lower barrier than static treatments. Second, we apply the same protocol to the isomerization of protonated isobutanol to protonated 2-butanol, yielding a quantitatively accurate free-energy landscape. We uncover three competing channels: the established concerted mechanism and two asynchronous stepwise routes mediated by water and methyl transfer, all with comparable activation barriers. Notably, the stepwise pathways traverse metastable intermediates that, to the best of our knowledge, have not been described in prior mechanistic studies. Calculated barrier heights and intermediate stabilities are in close agreement with high-level DFT benchmarks, demonstrating the framework's accuracy. Together, these studies highlight mechanistic diversity across distinct systems and establish the synergistic PCCANN-MACE protocol as a proof-of-concept approach for committor-based discovery of complex reaction dynamics."}

We develop an approach to assign irreducible-representation labels to excitonic states, providing a state-of-the-art framework for analysing their symmetries and selection rules (including, for example, the case of exciton-phonon coupling). Complementary to the symmetry classification, we introduce the concept of total crystal angular momentum for excitons in the presence of rotational symmetries, allowing the derivation of conservation laws. Furthermore, we demonstrate how these symmetry properties can be exploited to greatly enhance the computational efficiency of exciton calculations with the BSE. We apply our methodology to three prototypical systems to understand the role of symmetries in different contexts: (i) For LiF, we present the symmetry analysis of the entire excitonic dispersion and examine the selection rules for optical absorption. (ii) In the calculation of resonant Raman spectra of monolayer MoSe2, we demonstrate how the conservation of total crystal angular momentum governs exciton-phonon interactions, leading to the observed resonant enhancement.

In this review, we highlight and classify the mechanisms of resistive switching in mono and bulk 2DLM, with a subsequent focus on those occurring in a monolayer and/or localized to point defects in the crystalline sheet. We discuss the complex energetics involved in these fundamentally defect-assisted processes, including the co-existence of multiple mechanisms and influence of the contacts used. Examining the highly localized 'atomristor'-type switching, we provide insights into the atomic motions and electronic transport across the metal-2D interfaces underlying their operation. Finally, we present the progress and our perspective on the challenges associated with the development of 2D resistive switching devices. Promising application areas and material systems are identified and suggested for further research."}

Reliable first-principles modelling of the photovoltaic alpha-phase is further complicated by inconsistent structural models and levels of theory in the literature. Here, we identify the structural and electronic requirements needed for a physically sound description of alpha-FASnI3, whose behaviour is governed by a pseudo-Jahn-Teller (PJT) instability arising from the stereochemically active Sn(II) lone pair.\n  Using 0 K relaxations, cross-code hybrid-functional benchmarks, and finite-temperature ab initio molecular dynamics, we show that a 4x4x4 supercell with randomly oriented FA+ cations is the smallest model that removes macroscopic dipoles, preserves cubic symmetry, recovers local octahedral tilts, and captures the characteristic PJT-driven Sn off-centering. Accurate band edges and a reliable band gap require a PBE0-level hybrid functional with spin-orbit coupling to treat Sn relativistic effects, together with nonlocal dispersion (rVV10) to capture the enhanced Sn-I covalency. Finite-temperature simulations reveal that Sn off-centering remains local, <111>-oriented, and robust against thermal fluctuations, and that reproducing the experimental 300 K band gap requires a 6x6x6 supercell. These results define the essential ingredients for reliable modelling of alpha-FASnI3 and provide a rigorous foundation for studying lone-pair-driven physics in tin halide perovskites."}

By enabling the substitution of scarce or supply-risk rare-earths with more readily available alternatives while maintaining comparable material performance, HECs and MCCs offer a valuable path towards alternative TBC material design. However, navigating this search space of compositionally complex materials is both time and resource intensive. In this study, an active learning (AL) framework was employed to identify HEC/MCC materials with a pyrochlore structure, with acceptable thermal conductivity (TC) for TBC applications. The AL framework was applied through a Bayesian optimisation (BO) strategy, coupled with a random forest surrogate model. TC was selected as the optimisation criterion as that is the most basic requirement of TBC materials. Over two iterations of the AL cycle, four compositions were generated and synthesized in the lab for experimental evaluation. The first iteration yielded two single-phase pyrochlores, $(La_{0.29}Nd_{0.36}Gd_{0.36})_2Zr_2O_7$ and $(La_{0.333}Nd_{0.26}Gd_{0.15}Ho_{0.15}Yb_{0.111})_2Zr_2O_7$, with measured thermal conductivities of 2.03 and 1.90 $W/mK$, respectively. The surrogate model predicted a TC of 2.009 $W/mK$ for both compositions, demonstrating it's accuracy for completely new compositions. The second iteration compositions showed dual-phase when synthesized, highlighting the need to take into account phase formation in the AL framework."}

Conditional generation enhances this capacity by allowing inverse design, where specific desired properties can be requested during the generation process. However, conditioning of transformer-based approaches, in particular, is constrained by discrete tokenisation schemes and the risk of catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning. This work introduces CrystaLLM-π (property injection), a conditional autoregressive framework that integrates continuous property representations directly into the transformer's attention mechanism. Two architectures, Property-Key-Value (PKV) Prefix attention and PKV Residual attention, are presented. These methods bypass inefficient sequence-level tokenisation and preserve foundational knowledge from unsupervised pre-training on Crystallographic Information Files (CIFs) as textual input. We establish the efficacy of these mechanisms through systematic robustness studies and evaluate the framework's versatility across two distinct tasks. First, for structure recovery, the model processes high-dimensional, heterogeneous X-ray diffraction patterns, achieving structural accuracy competitive with specialised models and demonstrating applications to experimental structure recovery and polymorph differentiation. Second, for materials discovery, the model is fine-tuned on a specialised photovoltaic dataset to generate novel, stable candidates validated by Density Functional Theory (DFT). It implicitly learns to target optimal band gap regions for high photovoltaic efficiency, demonstrating a capability to map complex structure-property relationships. CrystaLLM-π provides a unified, flexible, and computationally efficient framework for inverse materials design."}

We show that this system enables spin-wave transmission over a one-micrometer distance via exchange-mediated coupling between subsystems and evanescent spin-wave tunneling through the out-of-plane magnetized parts.

In this context, realization of the tetragonal phase at ambient pressure could be a rational step to achieve the goal of ambient-pressure HTSC in the nickelate system. By employing the concept of Goldschmidt tolerance factor, we succeed in stabilizing the tetragonal phase by aluminum doping together with post annealing under moderately high oxygen pressure. X-ray and neutron diffractions verify the tetragonal $I4/mmm$ structure for the post-annealed samples La$_3$Ni$_{2-x}$Al$_x$O$_{7-δ}$ (0.3 $\\leq x \\leq$ 0.5). The Al-doped samples, including the tetragonal ones, show semiconducting properties, carry localized magnetic moments, and exhibit spin-glass-like behaviors at low temperatures, all of which can be explained in terms of charge carrier localization. Furthermore, high-pressure resistance measurements on post-annealed samples reveal that even a low Al doping ($x$ = 0.05) suppresses superconductivity almost completely. This work gives information about the effect of nonmagnetic impurity on metallicity as well as superconductivity in bilayer nickelates, which would contribute to understanding the superconducting mechanism in RP nickelates."}

Focusing on periodic boundary conditions (to avoid edge artefacts) we compute the Liouvillian rapidities and their smallest nonzero real part (the rapidity gap) for several spatial dissipation patterns: uniform (all), single--site (one--site) and two--site (two--site) placement, plus pairwise gain/loss on helical partner sites. We show that uniform dissipation yields large, weakly lambda--dependent gaps, while sparse local dissipation produces gaps that shrink rapidly as the quasiperiodic potential lambda induces localization. Increasing t_N enhances relaxation by improving mode overlap with dissipative channels. Finite--size scaling, rapidity level statistics (Poisson vs Wigner--Dyson), and spatial profiles of slow modes provide a consistent picture linking Liouvillian spectral structure to transport and localization.

Nonetheless, certain configurations may lead to unwanted parasitic nucleation. To predict and mitigate this effect, we employ phase-field simulations alongside an analytical model. Their predictive capability is demonstrated across three distinct material-substrate systems, enabling precise control over nucleation and subsequent crystal growth. Notably, the only material-specific input required is the nucleation density (i.e., the number of crystals nucleated per unit area on an unpatterned substrate). This generality makes the models broadly applicable to diverse material systems for achieving controlled two-dimensional crystallization for improved optoelectronic device performance."}

However, the nature of proton pairing and its impact on conduction remain insufficiently understood theoretically. Here, through quantitative computational analysis of proton-proton interactions in Y-doped BaZrO3, we identify lattice-distortion-mediated elastic interaction as the key factor determining whether two protons form a stable pair or exhibit net repulsion. When a proton resides at an inward-bending distortion site induced by another proton, the resulting net repulsive interaction leads to an unstable configuration. In contrast, the proton tends to be trapped at a nearby outward-bending site that favors the formation of a stable proton pair. Moreover, the site where the two protons form the lowest-energy configuration also corresponds to a proton trapping site. By calculating the long-range diffusion pathways accessible to protons under different local environments in both single- and two-proton cases, we find that the range of rate-limiting barriers is 0.24-0.45 eV for two-proton conduction and 0.19-0.39 eV for single-proton conduction. The higher and more experimentally consistent barriers in the two-proton pathways indicate that the proton trapping effect induced by pairing hinders proton conduction. Our study elucidates the multi-proton diffusion mechanism, providing a theoretical foundation for the experimental design of electrolytes with enhanced proton conductivity."}

This theoretical prediction typically relies on an oversimplified model, where both the nanowire and the superconductor are idealized as one-dimensional systems. In reality, heterostructures have finite sizes that deviate from this idealization-and as a result, smoking-gun evidence confirming the existence of these zero modes remains elusive. Here, we investigate the finite-size effects of both the nanowire and the superconductor, and optimize their sizes to ensure that only one Majorana fermion exists at each end of the heterostructure. It is discovered that the optimal transverse sizes of the nanowire are less than 100nm in width and approximately 1nm in thickness. For the superconductor layer, its optimal thickness (a key aspect of its size) must exceed its coherence length. We also present the optimal sizes of the two types of materials used in the experiment in a quantitative manner. Notably, the identified optimal thickness of the superconductor (Al films, $\\sim$1000nm)--a critical size parameter--is two orders of magnitude larger than the thickness of Al films currently utilized in experimental devices (e.g., InSb-Al and InAs-Al heterostructures).

Dirichlet boundary conditions imposed on the field at the wall give rise to a repulsive fluctuation-induced force acting on the particle, causing a shift in its average position and a renormalization of the strength of the harmonic trap. We describe the effective overdamped dynamics of the particle, which features a nonlinear memory term depending on the wall-particle separation. We show that the two-time correlation function of the particle position features a memory-induced term that depends on the distance of the particle from the wall. At the critical point, this term decays algebraically upon increasing time and it displays a crossover from the behavior observed in the bulk to that corresponding to having the particle at the wall."}

We find that a weak to moderate Hubbard repulsion, tuned toward the SM-AFM critical value in the pure honeycomb Hubbard model, enhances KVBS correlations and can even stabilize the KVBS phase. Estimating the effective parameters for graphene places it in the SM region of the phase diagram, but near the SM-KVBS phase boundary.

The method is implemented by dressing a Wannier-interpolated Hamiltonian with the field through its position matrix elements, which allows the gate bias to modify orbital hybridization and band dispersion beyond perturbative treatments. Within the independent-particle approximation, the resulting second-order (shift) conductivity is evaluated for both centrosymmetric and non-centrosymmetric layered systems. Applied to MoS$_2$, the approach captures the emergence of a finite shift current in centrosymmetric bilayers and the tunability of intrinsic responses in polar structures. The shift conductivity rises linearly at small fields and saturates at higher intensities, reflecting the competition between the growing shift vector and the weakening interband coupling as resonant transitions move away from high-symmetry valleys. A Taylor expansion of the field-dressed conductivity connects this behavior to the third-order optical response, revealing a unified picture of field-induced nonlinearities. These results establish field dressing of Wannier Hamiltonians as a practical route to model and predict nonlinear photocurrents in layered materials."}

Trained on a Density Functional Theory (DFT) dataset of atomic configurations, energies, forces, and virials, the potential is designed to address the issue of H-induced acceleration of mechanical failure of metals, generally known as hydrogen embrittlement (HE). The proposed potential is shown to outperform the widely used classical and machine-learned interatomic potentials in fundamental properties of the $α$-Fe-H system. We show that the tabGAP model reproduces H-point defect properties, H-dislocation interaction, H-H interaction, and elastic constants with nearly DFT-level accuracy at a computational cost that is competitive with the efficient classical Embedded Atom Method (EAM) potentials. We further demonstrate the utility of the tabGAP model in molecular dynamics simulations of tensile tests of a perfect, and a $(111)[11\\bar{2}]$-notched $α$-Fe structure with and without the load of H atoms. The simulations show evidence of HE via observation of accelerated decohesion of Fe atoms at the tip of the notch, and an increase in vacancy concentration driven by H-dislocation interactions. Hence, the results of the presented simulations support the hypotheses of hydrogen-enhanced decohesion (HEDE) alongside hydrogen-enhanced strain induced vacancies (HESIV) as important mechanisms for H-induced mechanical failure of iron systems."}

By combining first-principles calculations with tight-binding analysis, we show that localized bonding between semiconductor surface dangling bonds and metal orbitals is sufficient to generate a large interface dipole and induce strong FLP, even when only a single metal monolayer is present. Within this framework, metal-induced gap states (MIGS), dangling-bond-induced surface states (DBSS), and bonding states embedded in the valence band are all understood as different outcomes of the same underlying interface bonding mechanism, rather than as independent causes of FLP. We further establish that the key parameter governing FLP strength is the density of surface dangling bonds that can form new chemical bonds with the metal, which directly controls the magnitude of the bond-induced interface dipole. This picture naturally explains the weaker pinning observed in more ionic semiconductors than in covalent ones and provides practical guidance for engineering metal-semiconductor interfaces and tuning Schottky barrier heights."}

This phenomenon can emerge in an overdamped system, but it may also be inertia-induced. Here, we considerably extend previous studies and comprehensively investigate the impact of inertia on the effect of free transport enhancement observed in the overdamped system. We detect that inertia can not only induce this phenomenon, but depending on a parameter regime, it may also strengthen, weaken, or even destroy it. We exemplify these different scenarios and explore the parameter space to identify the corresponding regions where they emerge. The variance of the active fluctuations amplitude distribution is a key determinant of the inertia influence on the effect of free transport amplification. Our results are relevant not only for microscopic physical systems but also for biological ones, such as, e.g., living cells, where fluctuations generated by metabolic activities are active by default."}

Among several possible relaxation channels available in a solid-state system, we focus on the coupling to magnetic excitations. In this paper, we study the real-time dynamics of a paradigmatic model, the Kondo lattice model in one dimension. We conduct a comprehensive study of the relaxation processes by evaluating the spin polarization of the conduction electron, the local spin-spin correlation between localized and conduction electrons, and the electronic momentum distribution. While in the well-studied cases of one or two charge carriers in a ferromagnetic background, no thermalization occurs, we demonstrate that the stationary state is compatible with thermalization if either the electronic filling is finite or the magnetic background is in the singlet sector. Our real-time simulations using the time-dependent Lanczos method are corroborated by a direct comparison with finite-temperature expectation values and an analysis of the spectrum in terms of the gap ratio."}

Although current ab initio methods can accurately determine exciton energies and eigenstates, their symmetries have been much less explored. In this work, we employ standard group-theory methods to analyse the transformation properties of excitonic states, obtained by solving the BSE, under crystal symmetry operations. We develop an approach to assign irreducible-representation labels to excitonic states, providing a state-of-the-art framework for analysing their symmetries and selection rules (including, for example, the case of exciton-phonon coupling). Complementary to the symmetry classification, we introduce the concept of total crystal angular momentum for excitons in the presence of rotational symmetries, allowing the derivation of conservation laws. Furthermore, we demonstrate how these symmetry properties can be exploited to greatly enhance the computational efficiency of exciton calculations with the BSE. We apply our methodology to three prototypical systems to understand the role of symmetries in different contexts: (i) For LiF, we present the symmetry analysis of the entire excitonic dispersion and examine the selection rules for optical absorption. (ii) In the calculation of resonant Raman spectra of monolayer MoSe2, we demonstrate how the conservation of total crystal angular momentum governs exciton-phonon interactions, leading to the observed resonant enhancement. (iii) In bulk hBN, we analyze the role of symmetries for the coupling of finite-momentum excitons to finite-momentum phonons and their manifestation in the phonon-assisted luminescence spectra. This work establishes a general and robust framework for understanding the symmetry properties of excitons in crystals, providing a foundation for future studies."}

We further map how these anisotropies, together with interlayer coupling, control the extent and location of the magnon Bose Einstein condensation dome.

One notable process involves the electroluminescence of defects generated within the switching matrix during device activation. In this study, we explore the early-stage formation and evolution of the species responsible for light emission in Ag-based in-plane memristors. Our approach combines electrical stimulation with correlated optical electroluminescence and photoluminescence measurements.

Multiferroic BiFeO3 combines both orders at room temperature, offering a unique platform for narrowband THz emission. Here, we achieve efficient sub-bandgap optical rectification of coupled phonon-polaritons near 2 THz in bare epitaxial thin films. In Pt/BiFeO3 bilayers, we demonstrate that coupling the electromagnon branch with ultrafast strain waves, optically generated in Pt layers with various thicknesses, can produce tunable and narrowband emission between 0.4-0.8 THz. These results uncover the intertwined role of phonons, magnons, and magneto-acoustic dynamics in antiferromagnetic multiferroics, and establish these hybrid platforms as versatile engineered narrowband THz sources."}

It has been argued that the parameter regime with antiferromagnetic couplings on hexagons $J_h$ and ferromagnetic couplings on triangles $J_t$ and dimer $J_d$ bonds, is potentially host to a cornucopia of emergent phases with unconventional orders. Our analysis indeed identifies an extended region where any conventional dipolar magnetic order is absent. A hexagonal singlet state is found in the region around $J_{d}=J_{t}=0$, while a dimerized hexagonal singlet order of a lattice nematic character appears proximate to the phase boundary with the c$120^\\circ$ antiferromagnetic order. Interestingly, upon traversing the bulk of the paramagnetic (PM) region, we find a variety of distinct correlation profiles, which are qualitatively different from those of the hexagonal singlet and dimerized hexagonal singlet orders but feature no appreciable spin-nematic response, while the boundary with the ferromagnetic phase shows evidence of spin-nematic order. This PM region is thus likely host to an ensemble of nonmagnetic phases which could putatively include quantum spin liquids. Our phase diagram is built from a complementary application of state-of-the-art implementations of the cluster mean-field and pseudo-fermion functional renormalization group approaches, together with an unconstrained Luttinger-Tisza treatment of the model providing insights from the semi-classical limit."}

By analyzing zero-temperature transport coefficients and applying Kramers-Kronig relations, we derive spectral representations of magnetization densities from thermoelectric correlation functions. Excitation rates under thermoelectric chiral drives then naturally emerge as direct probes of these Kubo-type correlators, placing orbital and heat magnetizations on equal footing with the topological Chern number. As a direct consequence of our formalism, we introduce a hierarchical construction that organizes orbital and heat magnetizations into distinct physical contributions accessible through sum rules, and also derive real-space markers of these magnetizations. From an experimental standpoint, we propose concrete implementations of thermoelectric dichroic measurements in quantum-engineered platforms based on modulated strain fields. These results establish thermoelectric dichroic measurements as a versatile route to access and disentangle fundamental ground-state properties."}

Valladares"], "title": "Edge-Dependent Superconductivity in Twisted Bismuth Bilayers", "comment": "16 pages, 9 figures", "summary": "Twisted bilayers offer a compelling and, at times, confounding platform for the engineering of new twistronic materials. Whereas standard studies almost exclusively focus on the explicit enigma that is presented by twist-angles, perhaps better epitomized by the related phenomena that have been observed in twisted bilayer graphene, functional devices necessarily face a fundamental concern: boundary heterogeneity in their structures. In this study, we address this concern by strictly investigating the electronic properties of twisted bismuth bilayers at the flake's edges and the vibrational properties of the flake. Twisted flakes exhibit continuous variations of these properties, away from the bulk, as we herein report using ab initio density functional theory, by systematically mapping the drastic evolution of band topology, electronic density of states, and possible superconductivity. Our work reveals a dramatic, non-fortuitous consequence of the structural disorder at the edges of the flakes: an enhanced electronic density of states at the Fermi level. This enhancement reaches a maximum of 10 times that of perfect-crystalline bismuth. Given that the superconducting critical temperature, Tc, is exponentially dependent on the electronic density of states at the Fermi level, this substantial structural variation immediately suggests a powerful mechanism for vastly increasing Tc. We also identify the twist-angle as a new critical parameter in designing novel engineering devices with topologically enhanced properties. Our results provide a necessary theoretical framework for interpreting new data for the upcoming generation of twistronic heterogeneous materials, and pave the way to search for atomic disordered metastable structures that could lead to enhanced superconducting transition temperatures."}

Macroscopic consequences of these three mechanisms are well-known, but further possible generalizations of the Keffer form of the Dzyaloshinskii constant are suggested. Consequences for the spin evolution equations, the momentum balance equations, and polarization evolution equations are considered.

We first provide an elementary introduction to the continuum modelling of moiré bandstructures, and explain how interactions are incorporated to study correlated states. We then discuss how to implement mean-field simulations of ground state structure and collective excitations in this setting. With this background established, we rationalize the power of mean-field approximations in MA-TBG, by discussing the idealized \"chiral-flat\" strong-coupling limit, in which ground states at electron densities commensurate with the moiré superlattice are exactly captured by mean-field ansätze. We then illustrate the phenomenological shortcomings of this limit, leading us naturally into a discussion of the intermediate-coupling incommensurate Kekulé spiral (IKS) order and its origins in ever-present heterostrain. IKS and its placement within an expanded Hartree-Fock manifold form our first \"case study\". Our second case study involves time-dependence, and focuses on the collective modes of various broken-symmetry insulators in MA-TBG. As a third and final case study, we return to the strong-coupling picture, which can be stabilized by aligning MA-TBG to an hBN substrate. In this limit, we show how mean field theory can be adapted to the translationally non-invariant setting in order to quantitatively study the energetics of domain walls in orbital Chern insulating states. We close with a discussion of extensions and further applications. Used either as a standalone reference or alongside the accompanying open-source code, this review should enable readers with a basic knowledge of band theory and many-body physics to systematically build and analyze detailed models of generic moiré systems."}
