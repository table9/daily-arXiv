However, this relationship can fail for doping-dependent transport measurements of materials with complex magnetism, topology, and electronic correlations. In this work, we present transport measurements of the correlated topological metal UCoAl doped with Ru, which appear to violate the Mott relation. We develop a model that captures the evolution of Stoner magnetism and topological Weyl points as a function of doping. Using this model, we show how the correlated flat band in this material pins the Weyl points to the Fermi energy, and demonstrate how this explains the unusual doping-dependent behavior of the anomalous Hall and anomalous Nernst conductivities in this material, while the Mott relation is in fact satisfied at each doping level."}

Although the classical ground state at zero field depends on the sign of $J_2$, we find a robust $1/3$ semiclassical magnetization plateau in both cases. The mechanism that stabilizes this plateau is analogous to that observed in the triangular lattice, where quantum fluctuations select a collinear state from the degenerate classical manifold. We calculate the plateau width, which shows a weak dependence on $J_2$, using nonlinear spin-wave theory. Additionally, we find that a straightforward approach based on linear spin-wave yields quantitatively accurate results even for $S=1/2$. Furthermore, we identify a magnetization jump at the saturation field when $J_2=0$; this jump is related to the presence of a flat band and disappears for $J_2 \\neq 0$. Our study demonstrates that a semiclassical approach effectively captures the $1/3$ plateau in the kagome lattice and serves as a valuable tool for interpreting experimental and numerical results alike."}

Our approach eliminates the dominant area-law term directly within the QMC sampling, thereby promoting the coveted subleading logarithmic term to the leading contribution. We apply this technique to calculate the EE in a (2+1)d square-lattice transverse-field Ising model augmented with a four-body interaction, tracing a path from the Ising to the Gaussian QCPs and then to the first-order transition. The consistent values obtained for the universal corner EE along the path validate the reliability and precision of our approach for extracting challenging entanglement properties.

For driving voltages close to the critical value, we derive the normal form of the Hopf bifurcation that underlies the oscillation transition in the thermodynamic limit. Using this normal form, we determine the phase and amplitude dynamics, and demonstrate that entropy dissipation decreases in the oscillating state for ring oscillators with more than three inverters. These findings culminate in a stability-dissipation relation, which links the observed decrease in dissipation to an increase in the local stability of the oscillating state. Next, we characterize finite-size fluctuations of the amplitude and phase near the critical voltage, using a stochastic version of the normal form. We demonstrate that close to the transition, finite-size fluctuations remain important at arbitrary system size, introducing oscillations even below the critical voltage. We further show that these noise-induced oscillations have an anomalously short decoherence time that scales sub-linearly with the system-size, in contrast to the behavior far from criticality."}

However, incrementing the cardinal number by one nearly doubles the AO basis dimension, and the computational cost scales as the cube of the AO dimension, so this is very computationally demanding. In this work, we develop and test a natural atomic orbital (NAO) scheme in which the NAOs are obtained as eigenfunctions of atomic blocks of the density matrix in a one-center orthogonalized representation. The NAO representation enables one-center compression of the AO basis in a manner that is optimal for a given threshold, by discarding NAOs with occupation numbers below that threshold. Extensive tests using the Hartree-Fock functional suggest that a threshold of $10^{-5}$ can yield a compression factor (ratio of AO to compressed NAO dimension) between 2.5 and 4.5 for the QZ pc-3 basis. The errors in relative energies are typically less than 0.1 kcal/mol when the compressed basis is used instead of the uncompressed basis. Between 10 and 100 times smaller errors (i.e., usually less than 0.01 kcal/mol) can be obtained with a threshold $10^{-7}$, while the compression factor is typically between 2 and 2.5."}

In particular, we consider a strongly spin-polarized metallic ferromagnet coupled to two superconducting leads via thin spin-active (left) and non-spin-active (right) insulating layers. The system is examined in the framework of the quasiclassical Green$^\\prime$s function formalism, both in the ballistic (Eilenberger) and the diffusive (Usadel) limit. Strong spin polarization allows for neglecting short-range mixed-spin correlations, and the Josephson supercurrent across the ferromagnet is fully mediated by long-range equal-spin triplet correlations. Using a diagrammatic technique for ballistic propagators introduced in Refs. [1-3], we describe the relevant Andreev processes responsible for the effective conversion of two spin-singlet Cooper pairs in the superconductor into two $\\uparrow\\uparrow$ and $\\downarrow\\downarrow$ pairs in the ferromagnet. Contrary to the naive picture of direct conversion, we show that the lowest order process involves four Cooper pairs in the superconductor, among which three are incoming, and one is outgoing, giving rise to net charge transport of 4e across the non-spin-active interface. The self-consistent numerical treatment of the diffusive junction, typically more relevant in experiments, confirms this picture quantitatively."}

Using the noncollinear Alexander-Anderson model, we have shown that the interaction of localized magnetic moments formed by itinerant electrons strongly depends on the position of the d-level relative to the Fermi level, which determines the number of localized electrons. Depending on this parameter, the ground state of the magnetic dimer can be ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, or noncollinear without the effects of spin-orbit interaction. The magnetic state can be controlled by shifting the d-level with an electric field, even without current flow. For a sufficiently large value of the hopping parameter between localized states there can be several self-consistent solutions with different values of magnetic moments. This opens new possibilities for manipulation of the magnetic structure of nanosystems. The results obtained lead to a new interpretation of the mechanisms of magnetization reversal, recording, and deleting of magnetic structures in tunneling spectroscopy experiments."}

In a magnetic field, these plasmons hybridize with the cyclotron motion to form magnetoplasmons, offering a platform for fundamental studies and for nonreciprocal, spectrally selective, ultrasensitive terahertz photonics. However, implementing magnetoplasmon-assisted resonant transistors at terahertz frequencies has remained challenging so far. Here we use gate-dependent, on-chip terahertz photocurrent spectroscopy combined with a perpendicular magnetic field to resolve and probe the evolution of resonant magnetoplasmons in antenna-coupled monolayer and bilayer graphene TeraFETs. In monolayer graphene the dispersion reflects the Dirac nature of the carriers, exhibiting a non-monotonic density dependence due to the interplay of plasma resonance and cyclotron motion, with an inflection point at maximal plasmon-cyclotron coupling. In contrast, in bilayer graphene we recover and map a magnetoplasmon dispersion consistent with the conventional Schrödinger-type picture. These results establish graphene TeraFET devices as a robust on-chip platform for resonant magnetoplasmonics at terahertz frequencies, enabling magnetically programmable, frequency-selective photonics and opening avenues toward photodetectors with enhanced sensitivity."}

Within the two-dimensional Kondo-Heisenberg model, we perform a self-consistent mean-field analysis of spin-singlet s-, extended-s-, and d-wave pairing under Zeeman fields, and compute the critical field Bc, the transition temperature Tc, and the Clogston-Chandrasekhar ratio rCC. We find that rCC increases sharply as the conduction filling approaches half filling. This enhancement arises from the weakly dispersive region of the lower hybridized band, where the strongly reduced Fermi velocity diminishes the normal-state paramagnetic energy and stabilizes superconductivity. At fixed filling, the distinct JH dependences among the three pairing channels reflect the sensitivity of Pauli limiting to both band curvature and the structure of the order parameter. These results provide microscopic evidence that proximity to a near-flat hybridized band offers a robust route to enhanced Pauli-limiting fields in heavy-fermion superconductors."}

Although this motion with static potentials have been widely explored, its physics in time-dependent periodic potentials are far less well understood. Here we generalize this motion to the realm of time-dependent periodic potentials, showing that the asymptotic solution of the probability distribution function (PDF) can have a universal form, that is, a Boltzmann weight multiplied by a Gaussian envelope function. We derive a partial equation for this Boltzmann weight and demonstrate that many different potentials can give the same Boltzmann weight. We first present an exact solvable model to illustrate the validity of our solution. For the periodic potential with a time-dependent tilt potential, we can determine the Boltzmann weight by numerical solving the partial equation. These results are confirmed by solving the Langevin equation numerically. With this idea, we can determine the asymptotic solution of the Fokker-Planck equation, in which the entropy satisfies the thermodynamic law. Our results can have wide applications, including quasi-periodic potentials, two-dimensional potentials and even with models with inertia, which should greatly broaden our perspective of Brownian motion."}

In the P-alpha framework, applying a pressure-dependent yield strength is essential to capture the particle velocity evolution, though calibration of other constitutive parameters, such as crush-out pressure, still strongly influences the response.

We introduce a complementary framework that instead starts from Jain's composite-fermion (CF) wavefunctions, which accurately describe FQH states as weakly interacting states of CFs at fillings $ν= n/(2pn+1)$ in an idealized limit. As we move away from this idealized limit to one more in line with experimental reality, we expect CFs to become dressed much like the electrons of a noninteracting system, which are dressed by neutral excitations as interaction is turned on adiabatically, as in Landau's Fermi-liquid theory. We model this dressing using a Feynman-Cohen-style backflow approach, implemented through symmetry-preserving neural networks-a framework we refer to as CF-Flow. CF-Flow achieves competitive accuracy with substantially greater computational efficiency and scales to systems of $\\gtrsim 26$ electrons. At fillings $ν= 1/3$ and $2/5$, as a function of Landau-level mixing strength, CF-Flow produces ground-state energies with low local-energy variance that are nearly indistinguishable from those obtained using the fixed-phase diffusion Monte Carlo (fp-DMC) method, even though the latter constrains the wavefunction phase to that of the lowest Landau level-thereby providing insight into why fp-DMC has been successful in giving an accurate quantitative account of several experiments. Finally, the symmetry-preserving architecture of CF-Flow enables access to excited states and computation of the transport gap at $ν= 1/3$, where we find, unexpectedly, that it decays exponentially toward a finite value in the limit of large Landau-level mixing, suggesting a first-order transition from the FQH liquid to a non-FQH state."}

We show that electrons localize into stable small polarons on an ultrafast timescale, trapped by the strong local potential induced by the dopant, while holes form more delocalized polarons that migrate efficiently through a lattice smoothed by global strain. The stark contrast between the dynamics of trapped electrons and mobile holes explains the suppressed recombination and enhanced energy storage.

We present a combined first-principles and experimental study of epitaxial Fe5Si3 thin films, establishing them as a magnetic Weyl nodal-line material. First-principles Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations unambiguously reveal that Fe5Si3 hosts a topologically nontrivial electronic structure containing six pairs of Weyl nodes at or near the Fermi level, accompanied by pronounced Berry curvature at high-symmetry points of the Brillouin Zone. High-quality epitaxial films exhibit robust ferromagnetism with a Curie temperature of ~370 K and strong magneto crystalline anisotropy. The magneto transport measurements on epitaxial films reveal the corresponding Berry curvature-driven responses, including a significantly large intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity of 504 S/cm and a high anomalous Hall angle of 5.5%, which is in good agreement with DFT calculations. A negative and non-saturating longitudinal magnetoresistance is observed, consistent with a chiral-anomaly contribution from Weyl fermions near the Fermi level (EF). Furthermore, a substantial topological Hall resistivity of 1.6 μΩ cm robust across a wide temperature range, indicating the possibility of robust chiral spin textures in the thin-film geometry.

The system is examined in the framework of the quasiclassical Green$^\\prime$s function formalism, both in the ballistic (Eilenberger) and the diffusive (Usadel) limit. Strong spin polarization allows for neglecting short-range mixed-spin correlations, and the Josephson supercurrent across the ferromagnet is fully mediated by long-range equal-spin triplet correlations.

For systems with power-law correlations $I(r) \\sim r^{-X}$, the metric scaling exponent is $κ= 1/X - 1/2$. A key consequence is that the geometric scale $G$ is uniform (position-independent) if and only if $κ= 0$, which occurs precisely at $X = 2$. This identifies $X = 2$ as the unique condition for a uniform and metric informational distance. We validate this relation using DMRG simulations of the 1D XXZ chain and exact results for the XX model.

Recent work confirmed the Momentum Integral (MInt) algorithm is the only known symplectic algorithm for the MMST Hamiltonian. To our knowledge, no symplectic algorithm has been published for the spin-mapping representation without converting to MMST variables and utilising the MInt algorithm. Here, we present the Spin-MInt algorithm which directly propagates the spin-mapping variables. First, we consider a two-level system which maps onto a spin-vector on a Bloch sphere and determine that the Spin-MInt is a symplectic, symmetrical, second-order, time-reversible, angle invariant and geometric structure preserving algorithm. Despite spin-variables resulting in a non-invertible structure matrix, we rigorously prove the Spin-MInt is symplectic using a canonical variable transformation. Computationally, we find that the Spin-MInt and MInt algorithms are symplectic, satisfy Liouville's theorem, provide second-order energy conservation and are more accurate than a previously-published angle-based algorithm. The Spin-MInt is significantly faster than the MInt algorithm for two electronic states. Secondly, we extend this methodology to more than two electronic states and present accurate population results for a three-state morse potential. We believe this to be the first known symplectic algorithm for propagating the nonadiabatic spin-mapping Hamiltonian and one of the first rigorously symplectic algorithms in the case of non-trivial coupling between canonical and spin systems. These results should guide and improve future simulations."}

We then show that the asymmetric Andreev spectrum, formed by hybridized Andreev bound states at the left and right junctions, enables a supercurrent across one junction via the phase difference at the other junction, thereby signaling the nonlocal Josephson effect.

In this work, we develop an accurate machine-learned potential NEP-C$_{24}$ for both the quasi-hexagonal phase (qHP) and the quasi-tetragonal phase (qTP) C$_{24}$ monolayers, based on the neuroevolution potential (NEP) framework. Using this NEP-C$_{24}$ model, we systematically investigate the elastic and thermal transport properties. Compared with C$_{60}$ monolayers, both C$_{24}$ phases exhibit markedly enhanced stiffness, arising from the combination of reduced molecular size and increased density of covalent bonds. The qTP C$_{24}$ monolayer shows nearly isotropic elastic properties and thermal conductivities along its two principal axes owing to its four-fold symmetry, whereas the chain-like, misaligned bonding topology of the qHP C$_{24}$ monolayer leads to pronounced in-plane anisotropy. Homogeneous nonequilibrium molecular dynamics and spectral decomposition analyses reveal that low-frequency ($<5$ THz) acoustic phonons dominate heat transport, with directional variations in phonon group velocity and mean free path governing the anisotropic response in qHP C$_{24}$. Real-space heat flow visualizations further show that, in these fullerene networks, phonon transport is dominated by strong inter-fullerene covalent bonds rather than weak van der Waals interactions. These findings establish a direct link between intermolecular bonding topology and phonon-mediated heat transport, providing guidance for the rational design of fullerene-based two-dimensional materials with tunable mechanical and thermal properties."}

In a magnetic field, these plasmons hybridize with the cyclotron motion to form magnetoplasmons, offering a platform for fundamental studies and for nonreciprocal, spectrally selective, ultrasensitive terahertz photonics. However, implementing magnetoplasmon-assisted resonant transistors at terahertz frequencies has remained challenging so far. Here we use gate-dependent, on-chip terahertz photocurrent spectroscopy combined with a perpendicular magnetic field to resolve and probe the evolution of resonant magnetoplasmons in antenna-coupled monolayer and bilayer graphene TeraFETs. In monolayer graphene the dispersion reflects the Dirac nature of the carriers, exhibiting a non-monotonic density dependence due to the interplay of plasma resonance and cyclotron motion, with an inflection point at maximal plasmon-cyclotron coupling. In contrast, in bilayer graphene we recover and map a magnetoplasmon dispersion consistent with the conventional Schrödinger-type picture. These results establish graphene TeraFET devices as a robust on-chip platform for resonant magnetoplasmonics at terahertz frequencies, enabling magnetically programmable, frequency-selective photonics and opening avenues toward photodetectors with enhanced sensitivity."}

It typically consists of two magnetic sites of opposite spins related by rotation within the unit cell. Here, we use circular dichroism (CD) in resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) to identify a new form of altermagnetism, namely bi-altermagnetism, in the correlated insulator Fe2Mo3O8, which comprises two altermagnetic sublattices: one with alternating quasi-octahedral Fe environments and the other with alternating tetrahedral Fe environments. We experimentally revealed the emergence of CD in an achiral, zero-magnetization system, thereby probing mirror-symmetry breaking associated with altermagnetic order. Notably, the CD appeared at sublattice-specific excitations of the octahedral and tetrahedral sites, indicating symmetry breaking in both altermagnetic sublattices. Calculations based on a model with the bi-altermagnetic order along the c axis successfully reproduce the observed CD. Our findings provide compelling evidence for bi-altermagnetism in Fe2Mo3O8, and showcase the use of RIXS-CD as a probe of magnetic sublattices in systems with zero net magnetization."}

The second is via the mean-squared-displacement of thermal wavepackets subject to stochastic collapse via Lindblad jump operators. These two methods are applicable in the high-temperature regime, where the noise is temporally uncorrelated. In this regime the noise causes particle localization and the transport is diffusive. The third approach -- applicable in the low-temperature regime -- is weak-coupling Redfield theory. Here, static disorder causes particle localization. When the dynamics is diffusive, the diffusion coefficient is a non-monotonic function of temperature, increasing with temperature in the low-temperature Environment Assisted Quantum Transport regime and decreasing with temperature in the high-temperature quantum-Zeno regime. For any temperature, static and dynamic disorder decreases the diffusion coefficient. The dynamics is non-diffusive for thermal energies deep within the manifold of local-ground-states, where the sub-diffusive exponent decreases with increasing disorder and decreasing temperature."}

Whilst the ensemble geometric phase, a mixed-state generalization of the Zak phase remains well defined at nonzero temperature, the modulus of the corresponding expectation value vanishes in the thermodynamic limit, limiting its practical use. To develop a diagnostic that is suitable also for very large systems, we introduce local density operators acting on neighboring sites, which distinguish topological phases by comparing their expectation values. The topological phase is identified from the relative magnitude of these expectation values, which only requires measuring two local expectation values at nonzero temperature, together with one additional nonlocal expectation value when next-nearest-neighbor hopping is included. In addition, we generalize the local chiral marker to mixed Gaussian states, fully determined by its single-particle correlation matrix, with a nonzero purity gap in their effective single-particle Hamiltonian. The presence of a purity gap ensures that the correlation matrix can be adiabatically flattened to an effective projector. Evaluating the chiral marker with respect to the band-flattened correlation matrix yields a real space topological invariant that coincides with the winding number in the zero temperature limit. The ensemble geometric phase, the local density operators, and the local chiral marker, provide complementary schemes to identify and measure topological phases of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain beyond pure states."}

Here, we report the design, fabrication, and performance benchmarking of a rapid thermal chemical vapor deposition (RTCVD) system capable of synthesizing epitaxial monolayer graphene under atmospheric pressure.

For driving voltages close to the critical value, we derive the normal form of the Hopf bifurcation that underlies the oscillation transition in the thermodynamic limit. Using this normal form, we determine the phase and amplitude dynamics, and demonstrate that entropy dissipation decreases in the oscillating state for ring oscillators with more than three inverters. These findings culminate in a stability-dissipation relation, which links the observed decrease in dissipation to an increase in the local stability of the oscillating state. Next, we characterize finite-size fluctuations of the amplitude and phase near the critical voltage, using a stochastic version of the normal form. We demonstrate that close to the transition, finite-size fluctuations remain important at arbitrary system size, introducing oscillations even below the critical voltage. We further show that these noise-induced oscillations have an anomalously short decoherence time that scales sub-linearly with the system-size, in contrast to the behavior far from criticality."}

Both the NbAl and TiAl antisites exceptionally reduce stacking fault energies and facilitate deformation twinning, thereby enhancing plasticity.

Although the classical ground state at zero field depends on the sign of $J_2$, we find a robust $1/3$ semiclassical magnetization plateau in both cases. The mechanism that stabilizes this plateau is analogous to that observed in the triangular lattice, where quantum fluctuations select a collinear state from the degenerate classical manifold. We calculate the plateau width, which shows a weak dependence on $J_2$, using nonlinear spin-wave theory. Additionally, we find that a straightforward approach based on linear spin-wave yields quantitatively accurate results even for $S=1/2$. Furthermore, we identify a magnetization jump at the saturation field when $J_2=0$; this jump is related to the presence of a flat band and disappears for $J_2 \\neq 0$.

Here adaptation is defined as improved reproductive success, namely the ability of one of the many locally stable states available to the system to expand in space at the expense of other states. We find that adaptation can arise simply by environmental exposure to sequences of varying influxes. This adaptation is specific to the temporal sequence yet flexible enough to generalize to related sequences. It is enhanced through repeated exposure to the same environmental sequence, representing a form of learning, and through spatial interactions, enabling natural selection to act and representing a form of collective learning. Finally, adaptation benefits from a nearby adapted state, representing a form of teacher-guided learning. By combining environmental drives and reproduction within a stochastic reaction-diffusion dynamics framework, our model lays a foundation for a theory of adaptation grounded in physical principles."}

However, a non-polar molecule such as H$_2$ has no preference for its orientation. There are thus two equivalent configurations with equal energy separated by a potential-energy barrier. Quantum mechanically, the molecule can tunnel between these configurations resulting in a tunnelling splitting, which in the case of H$_2$, is the same as the ortho--para splitting. In this work, we generalize semiclassical instanton theory to calculate the energy splitting of molecules in electric fields in full dimensionality. This goes beyond a perturbative treatment of the field and takes into account changes in molecular geometry during the tunnelling process which influence its electrical properties and can have a significant impact on the result. We first study the case of H$_2$ in a static electric field and then show how it can be applied to larger polar molecules subjected to oscillating electric fields, where we find that even large-amplitude heavy-atom tunnelling can lead to observable splittings."}

Third-harmonic generation (THG) is a primary tool for probing the Higgs mode, but its signal competes with that of quasiparticle excitations depending on impurity scattering rates. In particular, in the clean regime the standard BCS theory generally predicts the dominance of quasiparticle contributions. Here, we propose and demonstrate that the quantum geometry of electronic bands can be a key mechanism governing this competition. By developing a formalism that explicitly incorporates the quantum metric, and applying it to a tunable model of a dispersive-band superconductor, we show that the quantum metric can dramatically amplify the nonlinear light-Higgs coupling by several orders of magnitude. Our results establish that a large quantum metric can cause the Higgs mode to dominate the THG response, resolving the puzzle of Higgs and quasiparticle competition in the clean regime and identifying band geometry as a crucial ingredient for designing and understanding the nonlinear response of superconductors."}

Recent work confirmed the Momentum Integral (MInt) algorithm is the only known symplectic algorithm for the MMST Hamiltonian. To our knowledge, no symplectic algorithm has been published for the spin-mapping representation without converting to MMST variables and utilising the MInt algorithm. Here, we present the Spin-MInt algorithm which directly propagates the spin-mapping variables. First, we consider a two-level system which maps onto a spin-vector on a Bloch sphere and determine that the Spin-MInt is a symplectic, symmetrical, second-order, time-reversible, angle invariant and geometric structure preserving algorithm. Despite spin-variables resulting in a non-invertible structure matrix, we rigorously prove the Spin-MInt is symplectic using a canonical variable transformation. Computationally, we find that the Spin-MInt and MInt algorithms are symplectic, satisfy Liouville's theorem, provide second-order energy conservation and are more accurate than a previously-published angle-based algorithm. The Spin-MInt is significantly faster than the MInt algorithm for two electronic states. Secondly, we extend this methodology to more than two electronic states and present accurate population results for a three-state morse potential. We believe this to be the first known symplectic algorithm for propagating the nonadiabatic spin-mapping Hamiltonian and one of the first rigorously symplectic algorithms in the case of non-trivial coupling between canonical and spin systems. These results should guide and improve future simulations."}

Quantum gates can be implemented by parametrically driving the qubits while their transition frequencies are detuned from the resonator frequency. Long-range two-qubit controlled-Z (CZ) gates have been proposed for the DQD spin qubit within the rotating-wave approximation (RWA). Rapid gates demand strong coupling, but RWA breaks down when coupling strengths become significant relative to system frequencies. Therefore, understanding the errors arising from approximations used is critical for high-fidelity operation. Here, we go beyond RWA to study CZ gate fidelity for both DQD spin and charge qubits. We propose a novel parametric drive on the charge qubit that produces smaller errors and show that the fidelity of the CZ gate outperforms its spin counterpart, resulting in a much smaller fidelity loss of $0.05\\%$ compared to $0.80\\%$ for the spin qubit, and greater robustness against qubit dephasing and photon loss. We find that drive amplitude -- a parameter dropped in RWA -- is critical for optimizing fidelity, with the charge qubit exhibiting better tolerance to drive amplitude variations. Our results demonstrate the necessity of going beyond RWA in understanding how long-range gates can be realized in DQD qubits, with charge qubits offering considerable advantages in high-fidelity operation."}

This work presents a multiphysics finite element study on the thermomechanical dynamics of silicon wafers irradiated by picosecond laser pulses, focusing on the melting regime where thermomechanical and hydrodynamic effects dominate. To illustrate the sequential nature of laser scanning, single-pulse irradiation models are developed as thermomechanical analogues of double-pulse interactions. By positioning the laser focus near reflective boundaries and corners of the target, these models reproduce the stress-wave interference that would occur between successive pulses in scanning. The results show that periodic surface structures originate from mechanical standing wave interference within the molten layer, forming ripples with near-wavelength periodicity. The penetration depth (PD) is identified as a key factor controlling the duration and stability of these ripples: shallow PDs (75-150 nm) yield distinct, persistent patterns, while deeper PDs (app. 2.5 micrometers) lead to extended melting and hydrodynamic smoothing. Simulations of sequential double-pulse irradiation confirm that residual stresses and strains from the first pulse amplify deformation during the second, enhancing ripple amplitude and uniformity. Controlled excitation of mechanical standing waves governed by PD, boundary geometry, and pulse sequencing - thus represents a fundamental mechanism for deterministic LIPSS formation on silicon."}

The itinerant magnetic ground state realized in the chromium-based framework Cr(tri)$_{2}$(CF$_{3}$SO$_{3}$)$_{0.33}$ (Htri, $1H$-$1$,$2$,$3$-triazole) is a remarkable exception to this trend, showing a robust ferromagnetic behavior almost at ambient conditions.

We highlight several thermally-activated relaxation mechanisms for the nuclear magnetization due to the tendency of electrons towards localization at low temperatures as well as the rotational dynamics of the charge-balancing triflate ions confined within the pores. Most interestingly, we report the development within the paramagnetic regime of mesoscopic magnetic correlated clusters whose slow dynamics in the MHz range are tracked by the nuclear moments, in agreement with the highly unconventional nature of the magnetic transition detected by dc SQUID magnetometry.

Such behavior is unconventional and suggests a depletion of the condensate by increasing pairbreaking or the growth of a second non-pairing channel. This led to a recent suggestion that the condensate arises from an incoherent charge channel which progressively gives way with overdoping to a second, coherent non-pairing channel. Contra these ideas, we report analysis of the field-dependent electronic specific heat of several cuprates from which we find no apparent loss of SFD with overdoping. The SFD per CuO_2 plaquette is found to rise progressively with overdoping from p towards (1+p), undiminished and much the same as the Hall number, thus implying that all available carriers contribute to the condensate.

This report explores the effects of alloying and Si (0.5 at.\\%) doping on In$_{0.10}$Ga$_{0.90}$N thin films that were grown by metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy. Post-growth X-ray diffraction measurements indicate that Si doping does not affect the lattice parameters and screw dislocations but significantly increases the edge dislocation density. Temperature-dependent time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy shows that Si-doped In$_{0.10}$Ga$_{0.90}$N exhibits higher photoluminescence intensity, blue-shifted peaks, narrower emission linewidths, and quenching of lower energy sidebands when compared to pristine In$_{0.10}$Ga$_{0.90}$N. The peak energies of the most dominant feature, the donor-bound exciton, for both samples show an $S$-shape behavior indicating the presence of disorder. Although doping improves luminescence, it also introduces deeper localized states. This suggests that impurity-induced disorder outweighs compositional fluctuations, as confirmed by higher disorder parameters and Stokes shifts. Thus, the Si doping leads to increased localization, reducing nonradiative recombination channels while enhancing radiative processes. The deeper states in the doped sample confirm improved carrier confinement, and their saturation leads to early thermalization, thereby lowering the red-blue shift transition from 165 K to about 50 K. Even though the high doping level makes Si-doped In$_{0.10}$Ga$_{0.90}$N a degenerate system, it exhibits enhanced luminescence properties. These findings shed light on the impact of silicon doping on charge transport in InGaN alloys for optoelectronic applications."}

This $T$-matrix is derived in terms of the inverse of matrix for various kinds of a single impurity, and then is used to evaluate the local density of states (LDOS) by the involvement of all the quasiparticle excitations and scattering processes. It is shown that a number of the anomalous properties in the underdoped cuprate superconductors is directly correlated to the opening of the normal-state pseudogap: (i) the structure of the microscopic octet scattering model generated by the normal-state pseudogap is essentially the same both in the superconducting (SC)-state and pseudogap phase, which naturally leads to that the quasiparticle scattering interference octet phenomenology observed in the SC-state exists in the pseudogap phase; (ii) however, the spectral weight at around the antinodal region in the SC-state is gapped out completely by both the SC gap and normal-state pseudogap, while it in the pseudogap phase is suppressed partially by the normal-state pseudogap, this directly leads to that the non-dispersive checkerboard charge ordering with a finite wave vector ${\\bf Q}$ appears in the pseudogap phase only.

For these ZBPs, the scaling temperature coincides with half the full width at half maximum (FWHM). In contrast, the ZBP observed in the odd sector of QDSETs and all finite-bias coherent peaks, including the coherent side peaks of QPCs and the split ZBP in the singlet state of the QDSET even sector, are identified as anomalous Kondo peaks, because they arise from spin dynamics without spin exchange, and their scaling temperature does not coincide with half the FWHM.

Using determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we concentrate on the phase transitions of charge-density-wave order on the honeycomb lattice. Disorder is introduced through the random hopping of electrons in the system, which can localize electrons via the Anderson effect. Our primary result is that disorder suppresses the charge-density-wave phase, and the interplay between disorder and electron-phonon interactions extends the phase area. We also determine the transition temperature \\(β_c\\) to the ordered phase as a function of the electron-phonon coupling.

Describing these processes from first principles has remained an elusive goal. Here we introduce a comprehensive theoretical framework for the dissociation process, emphasizing the need for a non-adiabatic approach. We benchmark the results for the case of silicon-hydrogen bond dissocation, a primary process for hot-carrier degradation. Passivation of Si dangling bonds by hydrogen is vital in all Si devices because it eliminates electrically active mid-gap states; understanding the mechanism for dissociation of these bonds is therefore crucial for device technology. While the need for a non-adiabatic approach has been previously recognized, explicitly obtaining diabatic states for solid-state systems has been an outstanding challenge. We demonstrate how to obtain these states by applying a partitioning scheme to the Hamiltonian obtained from first-principles density functional theory. Our results demonstrate that bond dissociation can occur when electrons temporarily occupy the antibonding states, generating a highly repulsive excited-state potential that causes the hydrogen nuclear wavepacket to shift and propagate rapidly. Based on the Menzel-Gomer-Redhead (MGR) model, we show that after moving on this excited-state potential on femtosecond timescales, a portion of the nuclear wavepacket can continue to propagate even after the system relaxes back to the ground state, allowing us to determine the dissociation probability.

Furthermore, a substantial topological Hall resistivity of 1.6 μΩ cm robust across a wide temperature range, indicating the possibility of robust chiral spin textures in the thin-film geometry. These combined theoretical and experimental results establish Fe5Si3 as a unique, low-cost, centrosymmetric magnetic Weyl nodal-line material, providing a versatile platform for exploring coupled real and reciprocal space topologies in topological spintronic applications."}

Arguably the simplest incarnation of this problem corresponds to a doped Ising antiferromagnet, a problem widely considered essentially solved since almost 60 years by a popular yet approximate mapping to a single-particle problem on the Bethe lattice. Here we show that, despite its deceptive simplicity, the local spectrum of a single hole in a classical Ising-Néel state contains a series of anomalous, long-lived states that go beyond the well-known ladder-like spectrum with excited energies spaced as $J^{2/3} t^{1/3}$. The anomalous states we find through exact diagonalization and within the self-avoiding path approximation have excitation energies scaling approximately linear with $J$ and lead to a series of avoided crossings with the more pronounced ladder spectrum. By also computing different local, rotational spectra we explain the origin of the anomalous states as rooted in an approximate emergent local $C_3$ symmetry of the problem. From their direct spectral signatures we further conclude that these states lead to anomalously slow thermalization behavior -- hence representing a new type of quantum many-body scar state, potentially related to many-body scars predicted in lattice gauge theories."}

Here NbN is a stoichiometric nitride with superconducting critical temperature Tc =15 K and NbNx is a high resistivity, nonsuperconducting nitride deposited using a higher nitrogen partial pressure than for the NbN electrodes. For comparison, we co-fabricated Nb/NbNx/Nb JJs using the same NbNx barriers deposited at 20 oC. We varied the NbNx barrier thickness from 5 nm to 20 nm, resulting in the range of Jc from about 1 mA/um^2 down to ~10 uA/um^2, and extracted coherence length of 3 nm and 4 nm in NbNx deposited, respectively at 20 oC and 200 oC. Both types of JJs are well described by resistively and capacitively shunted junction model without any excess current. We found the Jc of NbN/NbNx/NbN JJs to be somewhat lower than of Nb/NbNx/Nb JJs with the same barrier thickness, despite a much higher Tc and energy gap of NbN than of Nb electrodes.

Their protection against external magnetic field relies on strong Ising spin-orbit coupling, which originates from in-plane inversion symmetry breaking. Due to the heavy atom nature of Ising SCs, a smaller but sizable Rashba SOC could be present through gating or interfacial effects. Here, we consider the effect of Rashba SOC in a two valley model of Ising superconductors with an attractive $s$-wave interaction. We show that Rashba SOC gives a critical magnetic field, above which the superconducting order parameter collapses at low temperatures. This effect, however, disappears at high temperatures. Our findings demonstrate that the low- and high temperature physics of Ising SCs is quantitatively and qualitatively different in our two-valley model, and may lead to new ways to determine the strength of the Rashba SOC in Ising SCs."}

Conventional fabrication methods of the hybrid heterostructures rely on transferring graphene grown on metallic substrates-- a process that is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to introducing numerous defects. In this study, we present a universal, catalyst-free method for the direct growth of graphene on insulating substrates by employing three different perovskite oxide substrates (SrTiO$_3$, LaAlO$_3$, and (La$_{0.18}$Sr$_{0.82}$)(Al$_{0.59}$Ta$_{0.41}$)O$_3$) using atmospheric chemical vapor deposition. Comprehensive characterization via Raman spectroscopy, X-ray spectroscopy, scanning probe microscopy, and electron microscopy confirmed the formation of a uniform, continuous monolayer graphene on all substrates. We identified that growth temperature critically governs graphene quality, as excessive active species may lead to secondary nucleation and the formation of multilayer graphene. Notably, all substrates shared the same optimal growth conditions. Low-temperature Raman spectroscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy of the graphene/SrTiO$_3$ hybrid heterostructure revealed cooperative phenomena, including substrate-induced lattice-phonon and electron-phonon coupling.

In this work, we develop an accurate machine-learned potential NEP-C$_{24}$ for both the quasi-hexagonal phase (qHP) and the quasi-tetragonal phase (qTP) C$_{24}$ monolayers, based on the neuroevolution potential (NEP) framework. Using this NEP-C$_{24}$ model, we systematically investigate the elastic and thermal transport properties. Compared with C$_{60}$ monolayers, both C$_{24}$ phases exhibit markedly enhanced stiffness, arising from the combination of reduced molecular size and increased density of covalent bonds. The qTP C$_{24}$ monolayer shows nearly isotropic elastic properties and thermal conductivities along its two principal axes owing to its four-fold symmetry, whereas the chain-like, misaligned bonding topology of the qHP C$_{24}$ monolayer leads to pronounced in-plane anisotropy. Homogeneous nonequilibrium molecular dynamics and spectral decomposition analyses reveal that low-frequency ($<5$ THz) acoustic phonons dominate heat transport, with directional variations in phonon group velocity and mean free path governing the anisotropic response in qHP C$_{24}$. Real-space heat flow visualizations further show that, in these fullerene networks, phonon transport is dominated by strong inter-fullerene covalent bonds rather than weak van der Waals interactions. These findings establish a direct link between intermolecular bonding topology and phonon-mediated heat transport, providing guidance for the rational design of fullerene-based two-dimensional materials with tunable mechanical and thermal properties."}

However, we find that the high-frequency pair-forming processes are outweighed by pair-breaking ones. Hence, the net contribution to pairing comes only from the low-frequency pair-forming processes, a result that underscores their key role in the pairing mechanism."}

Here, we predict that irradiated graphene can host two novel nonequilibrium steady states of matter with zero resistance when exposed to circularly polarized light: (i) Floquet Chern insulators and (ii) a radiation-induced zero-resistance state with spontaneous formation of an inhomogeneous current distribution. Specifically, we calculate nonequilibrium anomalous Hall and longitudinal conductivities to map the nonequilibrium phase diagram of irradiated graphene as a function of the driving frequency and the electric-field strength of circularly polarized light. As a result, Floquet Chern insulators are found to occur at high driving frequencies above the graphene band width. By contrast, at low driving frequencies below the graphene band width, the nonequilibrium anomalous Hall conductivity deviates from the expected quantized values, and the nonequilibrium longitudinal conductivity exhibits highly irregular behavior, including negative resistance. It is predicted that the thermodynamically unstable negative resistance will trigger a catastrophic breakdown, inducing a zero-resistance state with spontaneous formation of an inhomogeneous current distribution, similar to the radiation-induced zero-resistance state observed in quantum Hall systems."}

Understanding charge state conversion and equilibration is critical not only for NV centers in diamond but also for defects and impurities in wide-bandgap materials in general. The mechanisms by which these centers change charge state upon optical or electronic excitation without the presence of mobile carriers remain unclear, potentially affecting the performance of applications ranging from phosphors to power electronics. Here, we elucidate this issue for the case of photoionization of NV center ensembles. Using pump-probe spectroscopy, we ionize negatively charged NV centers and monitor the recovery of $\\NVm$ on timescales of up to several seconds. We find that the recovery rate depends strongly on the concentration of surrounding nitrogen donors. Remarkably, the equilibration dynamics exhibit no discernible dependence on temperature, ruling out thermally activated processes. The multiphonon-assisted electron tunneling model, supported by density-functional calculations, explains the measurements and identifies tunneling as the equilibration mechanism."}

For these ZBPs, the scaling temperature coincides with half the full width at half maximum (FWHM). In contrast, the ZBP observed in the odd sector of QDSETs and all finite-bias coherent peaks, including the coherent side peaks of QPCs and the split ZBP in the singlet state of the QDSET even sector, are identified as anomalous Kondo peaks, because they arise from spin dynamics without spin exchange, and their scaling temperature does not coincide with half the FWHM.

We investigate Ising and Rashba SOC separately in two models where two-component AM, assembled with crystallographic angle, can lead to qualitatively similar indirect band-gap closing and non-reciprocal supercurrent in a Fulde-Ferrell (FF) superconductor. Interestingly, in the absence of the above SOCs, SDE persists and the sign of efficiency can be altered by tuning the angle only. Parallel spin components with complementary momentum functions, ensuring the breaking of IS and TRS, can induce SDE in the presence of FF pairing. Continuing the analysis in the context of JDE, we explore the interplay between SOCs and AM with the p-wave and Fulde-Ferrell superconductivity in three different setups. The bulk bands contributes to the non-reciprocity in the case of p-wave superconductivity while JDE is dominated by Andreev bound states for FF superconductivity.

The sign of JD efficiency can be tuned with angle for p-wave superconductivity while absence of such sign reversal is a hallmark signature of FF superconductivity.

Using determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we concentrate on the phase transitions of charge-density-wave order on the honeycomb lattice. Disorder is introduced through the random hopping of electrons in the system, which can localize electrons via the Anderson effect. Our primary result is that disorder suppresses the charge-density-wave phase, and the interplay between disorder and electron-phonon interactions extends the phase area. We also determine the transition temperature \\(β_c\\) to the ordered phase as a function of the electron-phonon coupling.

In the second-order process, a spin in the $σ$-orbital virtually hops to the $π$-orbital, flips its direction due to intra-atomic SOI, and then hops back to the $σ$-orbital in the neighboring atom due to the misalignment of $p$-orbitals along the helix. This process induces an interatomic SOI in the $σ$-band, which takes the form of a Rashba-type SOI generated by an electric field normal to the helical axis. The magnitude of the SOI is proportional to the curvature, the hopping energy, the intra-atomic SOI energy, and inversely proportional to the crystal field strength.

Traditional approaches built on physics-derived first-principles calculations are computationally expensive, motivating the creation of machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). Traditional approaches to training MLIPs for structural relaxations involves training models to faithfully reproduce first-principles computed forces. We propose a fine-tuning method to be used on a pretrained MLIP in which we create a fully-differentiable end-to-end simulation loop that optimizes the predicted final structures directly. Trajectories are unrolled and gradients are tracked through the entire relaxation. We show that this method achieves substantial performance gains when applied to pretrained models, leading to a nearly $50\\%$ reduction in test error across the sample datasets. Interestingly, we show the process is robust to substantial variation in the relaxation setup, achieving negligibly different results across varied hyperparameter and procedural modifications. Experimental results indicate this is due to a ``preference'' of BPTT to modify the MLIP rather than the other trainable parameters. Of particular interest to practitioners is that this approach lowers the data requirements for producing an effective domain-specific MLIP, addressing a common bottleneck in practical deployment."}

Third-harmonic generation (THG) is a primary tool for probing the Higgs mode, but its signal competes with that of quasiparticle excitations depending on impurity scattering rates. In particular, in the clean regime the standard BCS theory generally predicts the dominance of quasiparticle contributions. Here, we propose and demonstrate that the quantum geometry of electronic bands can be a key mechanism governing this competition. By developing a formalism that explicitly incorporates the quantum metric, and applying it to a tunable model of a dispersive-band superconductor, we show that the quantum metric can dramatically amplify the nonlinear light-Higgs coupling by several orders of magnitude. Our results establish that a large quantum metric can cause the Higgs mode to dominate the THG response, resolving the puzzle of Higgs and quasiparticle competition in the clean regime and identifying band geometry as a crucial ingredient for designing and understanding the nonlinear response of superconductors."}

A key challenge in using AI is ensuring that human scientists trust the models are valid and reliable. Accordingly, we define a trustworthy AI framework GIFTERS for materials science and discovery to evaluate whether reported machine learning methods are generalizable, interpretable, fair, transparent, explainable, robust, and stable. Through a critical literature review, we highlight that these are the trustworthiness principles most valued by the materials discovery community. However, we also find that comprehensive approaches to trustworthiness are rarely reported; this is quantified by a median GIFTERS score of 5/7. We observe that Bayesian studies frequently omit fair data practices, while non-Bayesian studies most frequently omit interpretability. Finally, we identify approaches for improving trustworthiness methods in artificial intelligence and machine learning for materials science by considering work accomplished in other scientific disciplines such as healthcare, climate science, and natural language processing with an emphasis on methods that may transfer to materials discovery experiments. By combining these observations, we highlight the necessity of human-in-the-loop, and integrated approaches to bridge the gap between trustworthiness and uncertainty quantification for future directions of materials science research. This ensures that AI/ML methods not only accelerate discovery, but also meet ethical and scientific norms established by the materials discovery community.

Whilst the ensemble geometric phase, a mixed-state generalization of the Zak phase remains well defined at nonzero temperature, the modulus of the corresponding expectation value vanishes in the thermodynamic limit, limiting its practical use. To develop a diagnostic that is suitable also for very large systems, we introduce local density operators acting on neighboring sites, which distinguish topological phases by comparing their expectation values. The topological phase is identified from the relative magnitude of these expectation values, which only requires measuring two local expectation values at nonzero temperature, together with one additional nonlocal expectation value when next-nearest-neighbor hopping is included. In addition, we generalize the local chiral marker to mixed Gaussian states, fully determined by its single-particle correlation matrix, with a nonzero purity gap in their effective single-particle Hamiltonian. The presence of a purity gap ensures that the correlation matrix can be adiabatically flattened to an effective projector. Evaluating the chiral marker with respect to the band-flattened correlation matrix yields a real space topological invariant that coincides with the winding number in the zero temperature limit. The ensemble geometric phase, the local density operators, and the local chiral marker, provide complementary schemes to identify and measure topological phases of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain beyond pure states."}

Here, we predict that irradiated graphene can host two novel nonequilibrium steady states of matter with zero resistance when exposed to circularly polarized light: (i) Floquet Chern insulators and (ii) a radiation-induced zero-resistance state with spontaneous formation of an inhomogeneous current distribution. Specifically, we calculate nonequilibrium anomalous Hall and longitudinal conductivities to map the nonequilibrium phase diagram of irradiated graphene as a function of the driving frequency and the electric-field strength of circularly polarized light. As a result, Floquet Chern insulators are found to occur at high driving frequencies above the graphene band width. By contrast, at low driving frequencies below the graphene band width, the nonequilibrium anomalous Hall conductivity deviates from the expected quantized values, and the nonequilibrium longitudinal conductivity exhibits highly irregular behavior, including negative resistance. It is predicted that the thermodynamically unstable negative resistance will trigger a catastrophic breakdown, inducing a zero-resistance state with spontaneous formation of an inhomogeneous current distribution, similar to the radiation-induced zero-resistance state observed in quantum Hall systems."}

In particular, we consider a strongly spin-polarized metallic ferromagnet coupled to two superconducting leads via thin spin-active (left) and non-spin-active (right) insulating layers. The system is examined in the framework of the quasiclassical Green$^\\prime$s function formalism, both in the ballistic (Eilenberger) and the diffusive (Usadel) limit. Strong spin polarization allows for neglecting short-range mixed-spin correlations, and the Josephson supercurrent across the ferromagnet is fully mediated by long-range equal-spin triplet correlations. Using a diagrammatic technique for ballistic propagators introduced in Refs. [1-3], we describe the relevant Andreev processes responsible for the effective conversion of two spin-singlet Cooper pairs in the superconductor into two $\\uparrow\\uparrow$ and $\\downarrow\\downarrow$ pairs in the ferromagnet. Contrary to the naive picture of direct conversion, we show that the lowest order process involves four Cooper pairs in the superconductor, among which three are incoming, and one is outgoing, giving rise to net charge transport of 4e across the non-spin-active interface. The self-consistent numerical treatment of the diffusive junction, typically more relevant in experiments, confirms this picture quantitatively."}

Herein, the calendar life of high-loading Si (80 wt%) using baseline 1.2 M LiPF6 in EC-EMC electrolyte versus adding 10 wt% FEC is investigated over months. Over 8 days of aging, FEC leads to a 13-fold reduction in irreversible capacity loss in Si-LiFePO4 full cells. Cells without FEC are projected to fall below 80% of their initial capacity within approx. 22 days versus approx. 279 days with FEC. Symmetric Si-Si cells from harvested electrodes show greater increase in interphase resistance without FEC, whereby an increase of 10.81 Ohms is measured for 0 wt% FEC vs. only 3.37 Ohms for 10 wt% FEC over 2 months. Power law modeling of this long-term interphase resistance finds mixed transport-reaction growth behavior in FEC-free cells, suggesting significant dissolution, whereas cells with 10 wt% FEC added display a diffusion-controlled impedance growth behavior, suggesting a robust surface passivation film. Post-mortem FTIR and XPS confirm polycarbonate enrichment of the SEI, which was discovered to predominantly emerge from FEC self-polymerization during the idle aging. When the Si electrodes aged with and without FEC are harvested and reassembled into full cells with the same electrolytes used at aging, the first-cycle coulombic efficiency is 71% for 0 wt% FEC versus 97% for 10 wt% FEC. Subsequent cycling maintains over 99.7% CE with 10 wt% FEC, surpassing the pre-aging CE of 98.8%. This elevated CE indicates better passivation provided by the polymer fragments formed during aging compared to electrochemically formed SEI where no strong polymer FTIR signal is found. The self-polymerization during idle aging with additives such as FEC is therefore an opportune in situ mechanism to further engineer in extending the life of Si-based batteries."}

We find that rCC increases sharply as the conduction filling approaches half filling. This enhancement arises from the weakly dispersive region of the lower hybridized band, where the strongly reduced Fermi velocity diminishes the normal-state paramagnetic energy and stabilizes superconductivity. At fixed filling, the distinct JH dependences among the three pairing channels reflect the sensitivity of Pauli limiting to both band curvature and the structure of the order parameter.

We introduce a complementary framework that instead starts from Jain's composite-fermion (CF) wavefunctions, which accurately describe FQH states as weakly interacting states of CFs at fillings $ν= n/(2pn+1)$ in an idealized limit. As we move away from this idealized limit to one more in line with experimental reality, we expect CFs to become dressed much like the electrons of a noninteracting system, which are dressed by neutral excitations as interaction is turned on adiabatically, as in Landau's Fermi-liquid theory. We model this dressing using a Feynman-Cohen-style backflow approach, implemented through symmetry-preserving neural networks-a framework we refer to as CF-Flow. CF-Flow achieves competitive accuracy with substantially greater computational efficiency and scales to systems of $\\gtrsim 26$ electrons. At fillings $ν= 1/3$ and $2/5$, as a function of Landau-level mixing strength, CF-Flow produces ground-state energies with low local-energy variance that are nearly indistinguishable from those obtained using the fixed-phase diffusion Monte Carlo (fp-DMC) method, even though the latter constrains the wavefunction phase to that of the lowest Landau level-thereby providing insight into why fp-DMC has been successful in giving an accurate quantitative account of several experiments. Finally, the symmetry-preserving architecture of CF-Flow enables access to excited states and computation of the transport gap at $ν= 1/3$, where we find, unexpectedly, that it decays exponentially toward a finite value in the limit of large Landau-level mixing, suggesting a first-order transition from the FQH liquid to a non-FQH state."}

We find that an imbalance between crossed Andreev reflections and electron cotunneling in the middle Kitaev chain gives rise to an asymmetric $2π$-periodic phase-dependent Andreev spectrum, controlled by the superconducting phases across the left and right junctions. We then show that the asymmetric Andreev spectrum, formed by hybridized Andreev bound states at the left and right junctions, enables a supercurrent across one junction via the phase difference at the other junction, thereby signaling the nonlocal Josephson effect. Notably, these nonlocal Josephson supercurrents exhibit distinct positive and negative critical currents, demonstrating the realization of the nonlocal Josephson diode effect with highly tunable polarity and efficiencies exceeding $50\\%$. The nonlocal Josephson diode effect requires breaking local time-reversal and local charge-conjugation symmetries, with the latter being unique to minimal Kitaev chains. Our results establish minimal Kitaev chains as a highly controllable platform for engineering nonlocal Josephson phenomena."}

In this work, we systematically investigate the defect properties of Bi2SeO5 using first-principles calculations based on a hybrid functional. Although Bi2SeO5 is a chemically ternary compound, each constituent element occupies several crystallographically nonequivalent sites, rendering its defect chemistry highly complex. Due to the anomalous +4 cationic valence state of Se, the defect formation energies of same main group anion antisite defects (SeO and OSe) are prohibitively high, and their concentrations can therefore be neglected. In contrast, the extraordinary cation-cation antisite defects BiSe and SeBi emerge as the dominant defects. The pronounced variability in the formation energies of the six types of VO defects demonstrates that identical defect types located on nonequivalent atomic sites can exhibit markedly different properties. Under O-rich and Se/Bi-poor conditions, Bi2SeO5 shows relatively robust p-type behavior. Conversely, under O-poor and Se/Bi-rich conditions, or at intermediate O, Se, and Bi partial pressures, Bi2SeO5 behaves as an intrinsic semiconductor or displays very weak n-type conductivity due to strong donor-acceptor compensation. This study provides theoretical insights to guide the design and development of high-performance Bi2SeO5-based electronic devices."}

Although this motion with static potentials have been widely explored, its physics in time-dependent periodic potentials are far less well understood. Here we generalize this motion to the realm of time-dependent periodic potentials, showing that the asymptotic solution of the probability distribution function (PDF) can have a universal form, that is, a Boltzmann weight multiplied by a Gaussian envelope function. We derive a partial equation for this Boltzmann weight and demonstrate that many different potentials can give the same Boltzmann weight. We first present an exact solvable model to illustrate the validity of our solution. For the periodic potential with a time-dependent tilt potential, we can determine the Boltzmann weight by numerical solving the partial equation. These results are confirmed by solving the Langevin equation numerically. With this idea, we can determine the asymptotic solution of the Fokker-Planck equation, in which the entropy satisfies the thermodynamic law. Our results can have wide applications, including quasi-periodic potentials, two-dimensional potentials and even with models with inertia, which should greatly broaden our perspective of Brownian motion."}

Comprehensive characterization via Raman spectroscopy, X-ray spectroscopy, scanning probe microscopy, and electron microscopy confirmed the formation of a uniform, continuous monolayer graphene on all substrates. We identified that growth temperature critically governs graphene quality, as excessive active species may lead to secondary nucleation and the formation of multilayer graphene. Notably, all substrates shared the same optimal growth conditions. Low-temperature Raman spectroscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy of the graphene/SrTiO$_3$ hybrid heterostructure revealed cooperative phenomena, including substrate-induced lattice-phonon and electron-phonon coupling.

This work presents a multiphysics finite element study on the thermomechanical dynamics of silicon wafers irradiated by picosecond laser pulses, focusing on the melting regime where thermomechanical and hydrodynamic effects dominate. To illustrate the sequential nature of laser scanning, single-pulse irradiation models are developed as thermomechanical analogues of double-pulse interactions. By positioning the laser focus near reflective boundaries and corners of the target, these models reproduce the stress-wave interference that would occur between successive pulses in scanning. The results show that periodic surface structures originate from mechanical standing wave interference within the molten layer, forming ripples with near-wavelength periodicity. The penetration depth (PD) is identified as a key factor controlling the duration and stability of these ripples: shallow PDs (75-150 nm) yield distinct, persistent patterns, while deeper PDs (app. 2.5 micrometers) lead to extended melting and hydrodynamic smoothing. Simulations of sequential double-pulse irradiation confirm that residual stresses and strains from the first pulse amplify deformation during the second, enhancing ripple amplitude and uniformity. Controlled excitation of mechanical standing waves governed by PD, boundary geometry, and pulse sequencing - thus represents a fundamental mechanism for deterministic LIPSS formation on silicon."}

We demonstrate a SHO that takes advantage of a low-damping magnetic garnet with dominant perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA), namely gallium-substituted yttrium-iron-garnet (Ga:YIG). In-plane magnetized Ga:YIG allows for the operation at a high efficiency level while also enabling resonant spin-wave emission. A nonlinear self-localization of the excitation is avoided by exploiting the positive nonlinear frequency shift, which facilitates a current-controlled frequency of the emitted spin waves. Via micro-focused Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy, we investigate the properties of the local auto-oscillation and its spin-wave emission. Multiple modes are excited and compete internally, with two propagating modes detected up to distances larger than \\SI{10}{\\micro\\meter}.

This report explores the effects of alloying and Si (0.5 at.\\%) doping on In$_{0.10}$Ga$_{0.90}$N thin films that were grown by metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy. Post-growth X-ray diffraction measurements indicate that Si doping does not affect the lattice parameters and screw dislocations but significantly increases the edge dislocation density. Temperature-dependent time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy shows that Si-doped In$_{0.10}$Ga$_{0.90}$N exhibits higher photoluminescence intensity, blue-shifted peaks, narrower emission linewidths, and quenching of lower energy sidebands when compared to pristine In$_{0.10}$Ga$_{0.90}$N. The peak energies of the most dominant feature, the donor-bound exciton, for both samples show an $S$-shape behavior indicating the presence of disorder. Although doping improves luminescence, it also introduces deeper localized states. This suggests that impurity-induced disorder outweighs compositional fluctuations, as confirmed by higher disorder parameters and Stokes shifts. Thus, the Si doping leads to increased localization, reducing nonradiative recombination channels while enhancing radiative processes. The deeper states in the doped sample confirm improved carrier confinement, and their saturation leads to early thermalization, thereby lowering the red-blue shift transition from 165 K to about 50 K. Even though the high doping level makes Si-doped In$_{0.10}$Ga$_{0.90}$N a degenerate system, it exhibits enhanced luminescence properties.

Despite these advantages and reported optimized morphologies, device efficiencies remain below 10%, far from their ideal radiative limit. To uncover the origin of these performance losses, we present a systematic and fully consistent first-principles investigation of the defect chemistry across the Bi-based chalcohalide family. Our results reveal a complex defect landscape dominated by chalcogen vacancies of low formation energy, which act as deep nonradiative recombination centers. Despite their moderate charge-carrier capture coefficients, the high equilibrium concentrations of these defects reduce the theoretical maximum efficiencies by 6% in BiSeI and by 10% in BiSeBr. In contrast, sulfur vacancies in BiSI and BiSBr are comparatively benign, presenting smaller capture coefficients due to weaker electron-phonon coupling. Interestingly, despite its huge nonradiative charge-carrier recombination rate, BiSeI presents the best conversion efficiency among all four compounds owing to its most suitable bandgap for outdoor photovoltaic applications. Our findings identify defect chemistry as a critical bottleneck in MChX solar cells and proposes chalcogen-rich synthesis conditions and targeted anion substitutions as effective strategies for mitigation of detrimental vacancies."}

The combination of both techniques shows a ten-fold increase in the photocurrent by the acoustic wave. Moreover, the observed spatial redistribution of the current is attributed to the interplay between the contact properties at the source and drain electrodes and the charge carrier dynamics induced by the surface acoustic wave.

In this letter, we extend the BEC framework by introducing the concept of second-order dynamical charge and mode effective charge. Using first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that specific combinations of nonpolar phonon modes in many oxides can induce substantial second-order polarizations, reaching magnitudes comparable to those of intrinsically polar modes. Through a symmetry-based analysis of the charge density, we elucidate the microscopic origin of these effects, tracing them to variations in bond covalency and local electronic rearrangements. We also demonstrate large second-order mode effective charge in well-studied perovskites such as SrTiO$_3$, highlighting the generality of these phenomena.

Describing these processes from first principles has remained an elusive goal. Here we introduce a comprehensive theoretical framework for the dissociation process, emphasizing the need for a non-adiabatic approach. We benchmark the results for the case of silicon-hydrogen bond dissocation, a primary process for hot-carrier degradation. Passivation of Si dangling bonds by hydrogen is vital in all Si devices because it eliminates electrically active mid-gap states; understanding the mechanism for dissociation of these bonds is therefore crucial for device technology. While the need for a non-adiabatic approach has been previously recognized, explicitly obtaining diabatic states for solid-state systems has been an outstanding challenge. We demonstrate how to obtain these states by applying a partitioning scheme to the Hamiltonian obtained from first-principles density functional theory. Our results demonstrate that bond dissociation can occur when electrons temporarily occupy the antibonding states, generating a highly repulsive excited-state potential that causes the hydrogen nuclear wavepacket to shift and propagate rapidly. Based on the Menzel-Gomer-Redhead (MGR) model, we show that after moving on this excited-state potential on femtosecond timescales, a portion of the nuclear wavepacket can continue to propagate even after the system relaxes back to the ground state, allowing us to determine the dissociation probability. Our results provide essential insights into the fundamental processes that drive carrier-induced bond breaking in general, and specifically elucidate hydrogen-related degradation in Si devices."}

Here, we perform a high-throughput computational screening of approximately 20,000 experimentally known three-dimensional stoichiometric inorganics obtained from the Materials Cloud 3D structure database. By combining density-functional theory calculations and maximally localized Wannier functions, we are able to compute the full conductivity effective mass tensor for electrons and holes from the Boltzmann transport equation in the constant relaxation-time approximation. This approach captures the effects of band non-parabolicity, anisotropy, and valley multiplicity that would be neglected by standard parabolic fittings. The screening identifies a curated set of candidates exhibiting extreme electronic properties, from ultra-low to ultra-large effective masses, these latter associated with flat-band physics. We validate the workflow by recovering established high-mobility semiconductors and highlight promising novel candidates. Furthermore, we classify materials by their mass anisotropy and discuss the physical limits of defining a conductivity effective mass in narrow-gap regimes at room temperature. The resulting dataset provides a systematic roadmap to search for high-performance materials in novel chemical spaces."}

We define a geometric conversion factor, $G \\equiv \\partial_r d_E$, which quantifies the local scale. We show that $G$ relates directly to $I$ via $G \\propto I^κ$. For systems with power-law correlations $I(r) \\sim r^{-X}$, the metric scaling exponent is $κ= 1/X - 1/2$. A key consequence is that the geometric scale $G$ is uniform (position-independent) if and only if $κ= 0$, which occurs precisely at $X = 2$. This identifies $X = 2$ as the unique condition for a uniform and metric informational distance. We validate this relation using DMRG simulations of the 1D XXZ chain and exact results for the XX model. We demonstrate two falsifiable diagnostics: (i) $G(r)$ is flat in the bulk at criticality ($X \\approx 2$) but varies strongly when gapped; (ii) a coordinate-agnostic slope test of $\\log G$ versus $\\log I$ at the XX benchmark ($X = 2$) yields $κ\\simeq 0$.

Despite the structural polarity of sliding ferroelectrics can be precisely detected via SHG characterizations, distinguishing the orientations of sliding ferroelectricity based on SHG responses has rarely been realized, as SHG intensities for upward and downward polarization states are supposed to be same. In current work, combining computational simulations and experimental characterizations, the orientation of sliding ferroelectricity is demonstrated to be readily distinguishable via SHG responses in 2D SnP2S6 (SnP2Se6), a new sliding FE material. Specifically, owing to the unique symmetry operation within FE-SnP2S6 (SnP2Se6), the intersection between \\c{hi}xxx and \\c{hi}yyy SHG susceptibility coefficients with opposite signs leads to the effective rotation of SHG polar directions upon switching of sliding ferroelectricity. Moreover, the remarkable dependence of SHG polar directions on the orientation of sliding ferroelectricity is further validated by experimental characterizations performed on SnP2S6 crystal in a single FE domain structural form. This work opens up the avenue for in-situ detecting the ferroelectricity orientation of 2D sliding ferroelectrics based on SHG nonlinear optical responses, and also demonstrates the controllable optical nonlinearly for new \"slidetronics\" applications."}

We find that an imbalance between crossed Andreev reflections and electron cotunneling in the middle Kitaev chain gives rise to an asymmetric $2π$-periodic phase-dependent Andreev spectrum, controlled by the superconducting phases across the left and right junctions. We then show that the asymmetric Andreev spectrum, formed by hybridized Andreev bound states at the left and right junctions, enables a supercurrent across one junction via the phase difference at the other junction, thereby signaling the nonlocal Josephson effect. Notably, these nonlocal Josephson supercurrents exhibit distinct positive and negative critical currents, demonstrating the realization of the nonlocal Josephson diode effect with highly tunable polarity and efficiencies exceeding $50\\%$.

Therefore, the deformation mechanisms have to be fundamentally understood. Tribological loading causes a non-trivial, position-dependent, moving stress field. We present a systematic study on the influence of the complexity of the implemented material models on the calculated stress field. For the stress field validation, results of tribological experiments on single crystals with the activation of deformation twins are used. The resolved shear stresses calculated with the stress field models have to be highest on the experimentally identified twin systems. From this combination of modelling and experiment, it clearly follows that a stress field model considering plasticity is required. The widely used Hamilton stress field for tribological loading is limited due to only considering elastic strains. Here, the predictive quality of the stress field is sensitive to the assumed yield strength, work hardening and plastic anisotropy. Certain stress field models are close to the experimental data, but none completely replicate them. These results highlight that the model type and parameters have to be carefully determined in order to be able to predict how a metallic material deforms due to a sliding load."}

By tracing the historical origin of the misformulated equation, we demonstrate how a seemingly minor oversight evolved into a widely accepted standard practice within the field. We then present a dimensionally consistent formulation that restores physical meaning and analytical reliability to the SSP method.

Quantum gates can be implemented by parametrically driving the qubits while their transition frequencies are detuned from the resonator frequency. Long-range two-qubit controlled-Z (CZ) gates have been proposed for the DQD spin qubit within the rotating-wave approximation (RWA). Rapid gates demand strong coupling, but RWA breaks down when coupling strengths become significant relative to system frequencies. Therefore, understanding the errors arising from approximations used is critical for high-fidelity operation. Here, we go beyond RWA to study CZ gate fidelity for both DQD spin and charge qubits. We propose a novel parametric drive on the charge qubit that produces smaller errors and show that the fidelity of the CZ gate outperforms its spin counterpart, resulting in a much smaller fidelity loss of $0.05\\%$ compared to $0.80\\%$ for the spin qubit, and greater robustness against qubit dephasing and photon loss. We find that drive amplitude -- a parameter dropped in RWA -- is critical for optimizing fidelity, with the charge qubit exhibiting better tolerance to drive amplitude variations.

Grain boundaries also contribute to radiation damage mitigation by serving as defect sinks, yet this interaction can alter interfacial structure, typically leading to destabilization and grain growth. This study investigates how chemical ordering influences grain boundary migration and stability during successive radiation events in CrCoNi. Using atomistic simulations, bicrystals were equilibrated to induce segregation-enhanced chemical order, followed by prolonged irradiation at 1100 K. Our results show that grain boundaries in random CrCoNi begin to migrate after only a few collision cascades, whereas those in the ordered alloy remain immobile until the chemical order is sufficiently disrupted. Single-cascade simulations reveal key mechanistic differences, where cascades near chemically ordered interfaces produce smaller damage volumes and reduced atomic displacement due to enhanced Frenkel pair combination within the cascade core. This limits both the residual defect population and the energetic driving force for interfacial rearrangement. Subsequent simulations of irradiated interfaces show that interstitial absorption induces a structural transition that modifies the segregation morphology at and near the grain boundary, demonstrating a dynamic coupling between ordering stability and defect evolution. These findings offer new insights into the role of local chemical order on defect-interface interactions under extreme conditions and highlight pathways for designing radiation-tolerant materials for next-generation nuclear systems."}

In this study, we present a universal, catalyst-free method for the direct growth of graphene on insulating substrates by employing three different perovskite oxide substrates (SrTiO$_3$, LaAlO$_3$, and (La$_{0.18}$Sr$_{0.82}$)(Al$_{0.59}$Ta$_{0.41}$)O$_3$) using atmospheric chemical vapor deposition. Comprehensive characterization via Raman spectroscopy, X-ray spectroscopy, scanning probe microscopy, and electron microscopy confirmed the formation of a uniform, continuous monolayer graphene on all substrates. We identified that growth temperature critically governs graphene quality, as excessive active species may lead to secondary nucleation and the formation of multilayer graphene. Notably, all substrates shared the same optimal growth conditions. Low-temperature Raman spectroscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy of the graphene/SrTiO$_3$ hybrid heterostructure revealed cooperative phenomena, including substrate-induced lattice-phonon and electron-phonon coupling. Our work establishes a reproducible, transfer-free fabrication route for graphene/perovskite oxide hybrid heterostructures and provides empirical support for the universal growth of graphene on insulating substrates."}

We develop a model that captures the evolution of Stoner magnetism and topological Weyl points as a function of doping. Using this model, we show how the correlated flat band in this material pins the Weyl points to the Fermi energy, and demonstrate how this explains the unusual doping-dependent behavior of the anomalous Hall and anomalous Nernst conductivities in this material, while the Mott relation is in fact satisfied at each doping level."}

The mechanisms by which these centers change charge state upon optical or electronic excitation without the presence of mobile carriers remain unclear, potentially affecting the performance of applications ranging from phosphors to power electronics. Here, we elucidate this issue for the case of photoionization of NV center ensembles. Using pump-probe spectroscopy, we ionize negatively charged NV centers and monitor the recovery of $\\NVm$ on timescales of up to several seconds.

The itinerant magnetic ground state realized in the chromium-based framework Cr(tri)$_{2}$(CF$_{3}$SO$_{3}$)$_{0.33}$ (Htri, $1H$-$1$,$2$,$3$-triazole) is a remarkable exception to this trend, showing a robust ferromagnetic behavior almost at ambient conditions. Here, we use dc SQUID magnetometry, nuclear magnetic resonance, and ferromagnetic resonance to study the magnetic state realized in this material. We highlight several thermally-activated relaxation mechanisms for the nuclear magnetization due to the tendency of electrons towards localization at low temperatures as well as the rotational dynamics of the charge-balancing triflate ions confined within the pores. Most interestingly, we report the development within the paramagnetic regime of mesoscopic magnetic correlated clusters whose slow dynamics in the MHz range are tracked by the nuclear moments, in agreement with the highly unconventional nature of the magnetic transition detected by dc SQUID magnetometry. We discuss the similarity between the clustered phase in the paramagnetic phase and the magnetoelectronic phase segregation leading to colossal magnetoresistance in manganites and cobaltites.

The study systematically explores the spatial configurations of Bi3+ dopants and Cl- vacancies, assessing their impact on structural and electronic properties. Results demonstrate that the formation of square pyramidal BiCl5(2-) units serves as efficient exciton traps, fundamentally enabling strong luminescence in an otherwise non-emitting host. The Bi3+ 6s2 lone pair in an asymmetric coordination environment drives second-order Jahn-Teller distortions, creating a highly polarizable local lattice. This softness, in contrast to the rigid SnCl6(2-) framework, produces heterogeneous distributions of bond lengths, bond angles, and band edges around dopant sites. Defect-induced states strongly localize charge carriers, while coupling to vibrational modes at 300 K dynamically broadens the band edges, accounting for the large Stokes shift and broadband photoluminescence. These results establish lone-pair-driven Jahn-Teller distortions and lattice heterogeneity as key design principles for efficient luminescence in lead-free perovskites."}

This adaptation is specific to the temporal sequence yet flexible enough to generalize to related sequences. It is enhanced through repeated exposure to the same environmental sequence, representing a form of learning, and through spatial interactions, enabling natural selection to act and representing a form of collective learning.

Traditional approaches built on physics-derived first-principles calculations are computationally expensive, motivating the creation of machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). Traditional approaches to training MLIPs for structural relaxations involves training models to faithfully reproduce first-principles computed forces. We propose a fine-tuning method to be used on a pretrained MLIP in which we create a fully-differentiable end-to-end simulation loop that optimizes the predicted final structures directly. Trajectories are unrolled and gradients are tracked through the entire relaxation. We show that this method achieves substantial performance gains when applied to pretrained models, leading to a nearly $50\\%$ reduction in test error across the sample datasets. Interestingly, we show the process is robust to substantial variation in the relaxation setup, achieving negligibly different results across varied hyperparameter and procedural modifications. Experimental results indicate this is due to a ``preference'' of BPTT to modify the MLIP rather than the other trainable parameters. Of particular interest to practitioners is that this approach lowers the data requirements for producing an effective domain-specific MLIP, addressing a common bottleneck in practical deployment."}

A key challenge in using AI is ensuring that human scientists trust the models are valid and reliable. Accordingly, we define a trustworthy AI framework GIFTERS for materials science and discovery to evaluate whether reported machine learning methods are generalizable, interpretable, fair, transparent, explainable, robust, and stable. Through a critical literature review, we highlight that these are the trustworthiness principles most valued by the materials discovery community. However, we also find that comprehensive approaches to trustworthiness are rarely reported; this is quantified by a median GIFTERS score of 5/7. We observe that Bayesian studies frequently omit fair data practices, while non-Bayesian studies most frequently omit interpretability. Finally, we identify approaches for improving trustworthiness methods in artificial intelligence and machine learning for materials science by considering work accomplished in other scientific disciplines such as healthcare, climate science, and natural language processing with an emphasis on methods that may transfer to materials discovery experiments. By combining these observations, we highlight the necessity of human-in-the-loop, and integrated approaches to bridge the gap between trustworthiness and uncertainty quantification for future directions of materials science research.

Novel insights into the calendar aging of silicon due to internal passivation via polymerization of Fluoroethylene Carbonate during open-circuit aging", "summary": "The role of additives such as FEC in extending the calendar life of silicon anodes beyond the cycling benefits is still not fully understood. Herein, the calendar life of high-loading Si (80 wt%) using baseline 1.2 M LiPF6 in EC-EMC electrolyte versus adding 10 wt% FEC is investigated over months. Over 8 days of aging, FEC leads to a 13-fold reduction in irreversible capacity loss in Si-LiFePO4 full cells. Cells without FEC are projected to fall below 80% of their initial capacity within approx. 22 days versus approx. 279 days with FEC. Symmetric Si-Si cells from harvested electrodes show greater increase in interphase resistance without FEC, whereby an increase of 10.81 Ohms is measured for 0 wt% FEC vs. only 3.37 Ohms for 10 wt% FEC over 2 months. Power law modeling of this long-term interphase resistance finds mixed transport-reaction growth behavior in FEC-free cells, suggesting significant dissolution, whereas cells with 10 wt% FEC added display a diffusion-controlled impedance growth behavior, suggesting a robust surface passivation film. Post-mortem FTIR and XPS confirm polycarbonate enrichment of the SEI, which was discovered to predominantly emerge from FEC self-polymerization during the idle aging. When the Si electrodes aged with and without FEC are harvested and reassembled into full cells with the same electrolytes used at aging, the first-cycle coulombic efficiency is 71% for 0 wt% FEC versus 97% for 10 wt% FEC. Subsequent cycling maintains over 99.7% CE with 10 wt% FEC, surpassing the pre-aging CE of 98.8%. This elevated CE indicates better passivation provided by the polymer fragments formed during aging compared to electrochemically formed SEI where no strong polymer FTIR signal is found. The self-polymerization during idle aging with additives such as FEC is therefore an opportune in situ mechanism to further engineer in extending the life of Si-based batteries."}

Here we present an exhaustive study of this problem in the two-dimensional Hubbard model with cellular dynamical mean-field theory. To this end, we systematically quantify the dependence on doping and interaction strength of the superconducting gap, of the frequency scales where pairing occurs, and of their relative contribution to pairing. We find pair-forming alternating with pair-breaking processes as a function of frequency, providing new evidence that pairing can arise in principle from both low- and high-frequency processes. However, we find that the high-frequency pair-forming processes are outweighed by pair-breaking ones. Hence, the net contribution to pairing comes only from the low-frequency pair-forming processes, a result that underscores their key role in the pairing mechanism."}

Here, we deploy for the first time an electrochemical method to access the mostly uncharted overdoped region. We demonstrate precise control over the bulk oxygen concentration in YBCO thin films across the full off-stoichiometry window (0$\\leδ\\le$1) using electrochemical oxidation combined with in situ XRD and electrical measurements.

Third-harmonic generation (THG) is a primary tool for probing the Higgs mode, but its signal competes with that of quasiparticle excitations depending on impurity scattering rates. In particular, in the clean regime the standard BCS theory generally predicts the dominance of quasiparticle contributions. Here, we propose and demonstrate that the quantum geometry of electronic bands can be a key mechanism governing this competition. By developing a formalism that explicitly incorporates the quantum metric, and applying it to a tunable model of a dispersive-band superconductor, we show that the quantum metric can dramatically amplify the nonlinear light-Higgs coupling by several orders of magnitude. Our results establish that a large quantum metric can cause the Higgs mode to dominate the THG response, resolving the puzzle of Higgs and quasiparticle competition in the clean regime and identifying band geometry as a crucial ingredient for designing and understanding the nonlinear response of superconductors."}

We identify two essential ingredients: (1) alternating spin-polarized wavefunction localization on sublattices, and (2) broken translational symmetry caused by distortions in non-magnetic ion cages. We discuss a minimal model Hamiltonian based on an atomic exchange-driven spin splitting and anisotropic hopping that captures these effects and reproduces the hallmark features of altermagnetic band structures, including nodal spin degeneracies and large spin splittings. Our model is further validated by ab initio calculations on MnF2.

In the particle-doped SU($3$) system near one-third filling, the FM state is accompanied by a spontaneous flavor-selective Mott state, where two of the three flavors are Mott insulating while the remaining flavor is metallic. Since particles in the metallic flavor can almost freely move on the lattice without correlation effects, the ordered state is stabilized by the kinetic-energy gain of the doped particles. This is similar to the generalized Nagaoka ferromagnetism discussed in the one-hole-doped system at one-third filling. In the SU($4$) case, we find that six distinct types of FM states appear as the particle density varies.

In this work, we systematically investigate the defect properties of Bi2SeO5 using first-principles calculations based on a hybrid functional. Although Bi2SeO5 is a chemically ternary compound, each constituent element occupies several crystallographically nonequivalent sites, rendering its defect chemistry highly complex. Due to the anomalous +4 cationic valence state of Se, the defect formation energies of same main group anion antisite defects (SeO and OSe) are prohibitively high, and their concentrations can therefore be neglected. In contrast, the extraordinary cation-cation antisite defects BiSe and SeBi emerge as the dominant defects. The pronounced variability in the formation energies of the six types of VO defects demonstrates that identical defect types located on nonequivalent atomic sites can exhibit markedly different properties. Under O-rich and Se/Bi-poor conditions, Bi2SeO5 shows relatively robust p-type behavior. Conversely, under O-poor and Se/Bi-rich conditions, or at intermediate O, Se, and Bi partial pressures, Bi2SeO5 behaves as an intrinsic semiconductor or displays very weak n-type conductivity due to strong donor-acceptor compensation. This study provides theoretical insights to guide the design and development of high-performance Bi2SeO5-based electronic devices."}

Specifically, we calculate nonequilibrium anomalous Hall and longitudinal conductivities to map the nonequilibrium phase diagram of irradiated graphene as a function of the driving frequency and the electric-field strength of circularly polarized light. As a result, Floquet Chern insulators are found to occur at high driving frequencies above the graphene band width. By contrast, at low driving frequencies below the graphene band width, the nonequilibrium anomalous Hall conductivity deviates from the expected quantized values, and the nonequilibrium longitudinal conductivity exhibits highly irregular behavior, including negative resistance. It is predicted that the thermodynamically unstable negative resistance will trigger a catastrophic breakdown, inducing a zero-resistance state with spontaneous formation of an inhomogeneous current distribution, similar to the radiation-induced zero-resistance state observed in quantum Hall systems."}

It is well known that the combination of broken time-reversal symmetry and broken inversion symmetry can generate non-reciprocal phenomena, but the interplay between these kinds of systems and superconductivity is not well known. We present Josephson junctions fabricated from Cr$_{1/3}$NbS$_{2}$ that give magnetic diffraction patterns with asymmetry in both the magnetic field and the critical current. The non-reciprocity in positive critical current and negative critical current, generally called the Josephson diode effect, has an efficiency of up to $η=20\\%$ in some parts of the magnetic diffraction pattern and persists even at zero applied field. We propose that pinned Abrikosov vortices are a main mechanism for the asymmetric magnetic field response in this system, and that the non-zero spin chirality of the Cr$_{1/3}$NbS$_{2}$ causes the diode effect.

Such behavior is unconventional and suggests a depletion of the condensate by increasing pairbreaking or the growth of a second non-pairing channel. This led to a recent suggestion that the condensate arises from an incoherent charge channel which progressively gives way with overdoping to a second, coherent non-pairing channel. Contra these ideas, we report analysis of the field-dependent electronic specific heat of several cuprates from which we find no apparent loss of SFD with overdoping. The SFD per CuO_2 plaquette is found to rise progressively with overdoping from p towards (1+p), undiminished and much the same as the Hall number, thus implying that all available carriers contribute to the condensate. We suggest this could be the underlying intrinsic behavior for all cuprates.

This $T$-matrix is derived in terms of the inverse of matrix for various kinds of a single impurity, and then is used to evaluate the local density of states (LDOS) by the involvement of all the quasiparticle excitations and scattering processes. It is shown that a number of the anomalous properties in the underdoped cuprate superconductors is directly correlated to the opening of the normal-state pseudogap: (i) the structure of the microscopic octet scattering model generated by the normal-state pseudogap is essentially the same both in the superconducting (SC)-state and pseudogap phase, which naturally leads to that the quasiparticle scattering interference octet phenomenology observed in the SC-state exists in the pseudogap phase; (ii) however, the spectral weight at around the antinodal region in the SC-state is gapped out completely by both the SC gap and normal-state pseudogap, while it in the pseudogap phase is suppressed partially by the normal-state pseudogap, this directly leads to that the non-dispersive checkerboard charge ordering with a finite wave vector ${\\bf Q}$ appears in the pseudogap phase only.

We investigate Ising and Rashba SOC separately in two models where two-component AM, assembled with crystallographic angle, can lead to qualitatively similar indirect band-gap closing and non-reciprocal supercurrent in a Fulde-Ferrell (FF) superconductor. Interestingly, in the absence of the above SOCs, SDE persists and the sign of efficiency can be altered by tuning the angle only. Parallel spin components with complementary momentum functions, ensuring the breaking of IS and TRS, can induce SDE in the presence of FF pairing. Continuing the analysis in the context of JDE, we explore the interplay between SOCs and AM with the p-wave and Fulde-Ferrell superconductivity in three different setups. The bulk bands contributes to the non-reciprocity in the case of p-wave superconductivity while JDE is dominated by Andreev bound states for FF superconductivity. Importantly, JDE continues to exist due to finite momentum Cooper pair even without AM and SOC unlike the p-wave superconductivity. The sign of JD efficiency can be tuned with angle for p-wave superconductivity while absence of such sign reversal is a hallmark signature of FF superconductivity. Similar to SDE, parallel spin components in conjunction with p-wave superconductivity can lead to JDE that can also be mediated by only FF pairing in the absence of SOC and AM."}

Here we demonstrate significant improvements in absorber quality by alloying with Ag to form (Ag,Cu)(In,Ga)S2 (ACIGS) absorbers. We report the Ag alloying effect on compositional, structural, and optoelectronic properties of absorbers. We demonstrate suppressed bulk recombination and improved carrier lifetime in ACIGS, as a result of improved grain size, porosity reduction and defect passivation. We also show that Ag alloying flattens the Ga gradient. Consideration of this impact of Ag will be necessary in future engineering of the Ga profile to maximize charge carrier collection and avoid interface recombination. Exploiting the beneficial effects of Ag alloying, we report a wide bandgap (1.58 eV) ACIGS solar cell with a high power conversion efficiency of 15.5% and a large open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 948 mV, improving on the reference pure CIGS solar cell, with an 11.2% efficiency and an 821 mV VOC. Ag alloying is a useful route to further increase the efficiency of CIGS solar cells and future tandem devices."}

In this work, we investigate this phenomenon within the Holstein model on the honeycomb lattice, with a specific focus on the effect of disorder. While the interplay between electron-electron interactions and disorder has long been a central theme in the field, recent attention has increasingly turned to the combined influence of disorder and electron-phonon coupling. Using determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we concentrate on the phase transitions of charge-density-wave order on the honeycomb lattice. Disorder is introduced through the random hopping of electrons in the system, which can localize electrons via the Anderson effect. Our primary result is that disorder suppresses the charge-density-wave phase, and the interplay between disorder and electron-phonon interactions extends the phase area. We also determine the transition temperature \\(β_c\\) to the ordered phase as a function of the electron-phonon coupling. Additionally, we observed a suppression of electron kinetic energy and dc conductivity under disorder, highlighting the role of Anderson localization in the degradation of electronic transport. These findings offer significant theoretical insight into the stability and critical phenomena of correlated phases in disordered two-dimensional systems."}

In this model, a strong crystal field in the tangential direction of the helix leads to the formation of energetically separated $σ$- and $π$-bands. In the second-order process, a spin in the $σ$-orbital virtually hops to the $π$-orbital, flips its direction due to intra-atomic SOI, and then hops back to the $σ$-orbital in the neighboring atom due to the misalignment of $p$-orbitals along the helix. This process induces an interatomic SOI in the $σ$-band, which takes the form of a Rashba-type SOI generated by an electric field normal to the helical axis. The magnitude of the SOI is proportional to the curvature, the hopping energy, the intra-atomic SOI energy, and inversely proportional to the crystal field strength. The second-order process also induces long-range second-nearest-neighbor hoppings. We analytically derive the spin-split band structure in the zero-torsion limit."}

Despite these advantages and reported optimized morphologies, device efficiencies remain below 10%, far from their ideal radiative limit. To uncover the origin of these performance losses, we present a systematic and fully consistent first-principles investigation of the defect chemistry across the Bi-based chalcohalide family. Our results reveal a complex defect landscape dominated by chalcogen vacancies of low formation energy, which act as deep nonradiative recombination centers. Despite their moderate charge-carrier capture coefficients, the high equilibrium concentrations of these defects reduce the theoretical maximum efficiencies by 6% in BiSeI and by 10% in BiSeBr. In contrast, sulfur vacancies in BiSI and BiSBr are comparatively benign, presenting smaller capture coefficients due to weaker electron-phonon coupling. Interestingly, despite its huge nonradiative charge-carrier recombination rate, BiSeI presents the best conversion efficiency among all four compounds owing to its most suitable bandgap for outdoor photovoltaic applications. Our findings identify defect chemistry as a critical bottleneck in MChX solar cells and proposes chalcogen-rich synthesis conditions and targeted anion substitutions as effective strategies for mitigation of detrimental vacancies."}

Different dopant concentrations were confirmed by secondary ion mass spectrometry. Atomic force microscopy images revealed a grain-like surface structure of the samples with grain size increasing after rapid thermal processing (RTP). Raman spectroscopy showed that introducing Eu changes vibrational properties of CdO through intraionic anharmonicity reduction. Kelvin probe method revealed upward band bending caused by oxygen adsorption during RTP. Electrical measurements confirmed that rectifying junctions were manufactured and that they are able to produce photocurrent in the spectral range of 450-1150 nm without external voltage bias. Introducing Eu into CdO was found to increase e.g. rectifying factor and responsivity.

We show that half$-$integer Shapiro steps do occur in samples at a twist angle of 45$^\\circ$ but are unstable with thermal cycling. Interestingly, fractional steps can be introduced by training the sample with a small magnetic field or annealing with a large electrical current, attesting to a tunable current$-$phase relation (CPR) in twisted cuprates. We extend the current annealing to realize fractional steps with odd denominators too. Furthermore, half$-$integer steps can be induced in the regime that is well beyond the expectation of topological superconductivity, favoring an alternative mechanism involving trapped vortices. Our results not only caution the direct association of half$-$integer Shapiro steps with the exotic mechanism but also open a distinct pathway toward a Josephson junction with electrically tunable CPR at high temperatures."}

Despite the structural polarity of sliding ferroelectrics can be precisely detected via SHG characterizations, distinguishing the orientations of sliding ferroelectricity based on SHG responses has rarely been realized, as SHG intensities for upward and downward polarization states are supposed to be same. In current work, combining computational simulations and experimental characterizations, the orientation of sliding ferroelectricity is demonstrated to be readily distinguishable via SHG responses in 2D SnP2S6 (SnP2Se6), a new sliding FE material. Specifically, owing to the unique symmetry operation within FE-SnP2S6 (SnP2Se6), the intersection between \\c{hi}xxx and \\c{hi}yyy SHG susceptibility coefficients with opposite signs leads to the effective rotation of SHG polar directions upon switching of sliding ferroelectricity. Moreover, the remarkable dependence of SHG polar directions on the orientation of sliding ferroelectricity is further validated by experimental characterizations performed on SnP2S6 crystal in a single FE domain structural form. This work opens up the avenue for in-situ detecting the ferroelectricity orientation of 2D sliding ferroelectrics based on SHG nonlinear optical responses, and also demonstrates the controllable optical nonlinearly for new \"slidetronics\" applications."}

Therefore, the deformation mechanisms have to be fundamentally understood. Tribological loading causes a non-trivial, position-dependent, moving stress field. We present a systematic study on the influence of the complexity of the implemented material models on the calculated stress field. For the stress field validation, results of tribological experiments on single crystals with the activation of deformation twins are used. The resolved shear stresses calculated with the stress field models have to be highest on the experimentally identified twin systems. From this combination of modelling and experiment, it clearly follows that a stress field model considering plasticity is required. The widely used Hamilton stress field for tribological loading is limited due to only considering elastic strains. Here, the predictive quality of the stress field is sensitive to the assumed yield strength, work hardening and plastic anisotropy. Certain stress field models are close to the experimental data, but none completely replicate them. These results highlight that the model type and parameters have to be carefully determined in order to be able to predict how a metallic material deforms due to a sliding load."}

We show two distinct regimes: hybrid skin Chern states with switchable localization controlled by TE TM splitting , and hybrid skin antichiral states which preserves the spin polarized property. Our results bridge polariton spin physics and non-Hermitian topology, opening routes toward controllable non reciprocal and spin polarized transport."}

Here we identify a new candidate system to realize such physics, the organic quantum antiferromagnet (CD$_3$ND$_3$)$_2$NaRuCl$_6$. We report a combination of thermodynamic, magneto-elastic and neutron scattering experiments on single-crystals to determine the phase diagram in axial magnetic fields $\\mathbf{H \\parallel c}$ and propose a minimal model Hamiltonian. (CD$_3$ND$_3$)$_2$NaRuCl$_6$ displays an ideal triangular arrangement of Ru$^{3+}$ ions adopting the spin-orbital entangled $j_{\\rm eff} = 1/2$ state. It hosts residual magnetic order below $T_{\\rm N} = 0.23$ K and a highly unusual $H-T$ phase diagram including three different incommensurate states. Spin-waves in the high-field polarized regime are well described by a Heisenberg-like triangular lattice Hamiltonian with a potential sub-leading bond dependent anisotropy term. We discuss possible candidate magnetic structures in the various observed phases and propose two mechanisms that could explain the field-dependent incommensurability, requiring either a small ferromagnetic Kitaev term or a tiny magneto-elastic $J-J'$ isosceles distortion driven by pseudospin-lattice coupling. We argue that the multi-$\\mathbf{q}$ ground state in zero magnetic field is a prime candidate for hosting the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ vortex crystal proposed on the triangular Heisenberg-Kitaev model.

Arguably the simplest incarnation of this problem corresponds to a doped Ising antiferromagnet, a problem widely considered essentially solved since almost 60 years by a popular yet approximate mapping to a single-particle problem on the Bethe lattice. Here we show that, despite its deceptive simplicity, the local spectrum of a single hole in a classical Ising-Néel state contains a series of anomalous, long-lived states that go beyond the well-known ladder-like spectrum with excited energies spaced as $J^{2/3} t^{1/3}$. The anomalous states we find through exact diagonalization and within the self-avoiding path approximation have excitation energies scaling approximately linear with $J$ and lead to a series of avoided crossings with the more pronounced ladder spectrum. By also computing different local, rotational spectra we explain the origin of the anomalous states as rooted in an approximate emergent local $C_3$ symmetry of the problem. From their direct spectral signatures we further conclude that these states lead to anomalously slow thermalization behavior -- hence representing a new type of quantum many-body scar state, potentially related to many-body scars predicted in lattice gauge theories."}

We have been developing a ten-superconductor-layer planarized fabrication process with NbN kinetic inductors and searching for suitable self-shunted JJs to potentially replace high Josephson critical current density, Jc, Nb/Al-AlOx/Nb junctions. We report on the fabrication and electrical properties of NbN/NbNx/NbN junctions produced by reactive sputtering in Ar+N2 mixture on 200-mm wafers at 200 oC and incorporated into a planarized process with two Nb ground planes and Nb wiring layer. Here NbN is a stoichiometric nitride with superconducting critical temperature Tc =15 K and NbNx is a high resistivity, nonsuperconducting nitride deposited using a higher nitrogen partial pressure than for the NbN electrodes. For comparison, we co-fabricated Nb/NbNx/Nb JJs using the same NbNx barriers deposited at 20 oC. We varied the NbNx barrier thickness from 5 nm to 20 nm, resulting in the range of Jc from about 1 mA/um^2 down to ~10 uA/um^2, and extracted coherence length of 3 nm and 4 nm in NbNx deposited, respectively at 20 oC and 200 oC. Both types of JJs are well described by resistively and capacitively shunted junction model without any excess current. We found the Jc of NbN/NbNx/NbN JJs to be somewhat lower than of Nb/NbNx/Nb JJs with the same barrier thickness, despite a much higher Tc and energy gap of NbN than of Nb electrodes. IcRn products up to ~ 0.5 mV were obtained for JJs with Jc~ 0.6 mA/um^2. Jc(T) dependences have been measured."}

Here we show that single-layer Nb$_3$Cl$_8$, an excitonic Mott insulator on a breathing Kagome lattice, supports exceptionally large nonlinear susceptibilities up to seventh order. Many-body GW--Bethe--Salpeter and time-dependent BSE / Kadanoff--Baym simulations yield resonant $χ^{(2)}$--$χ^{(7)}$ for monolayer Nb$_3$Cl$_8$, with $|χ^{(4)}|$ and $|χ^{(5)}|$ surpassing values in prototypical transition metal dichalcogenides by 5--9 orders of magnitude. We trace this enhancement to flat bands and strongly bound Frenkel excitons with ferroelectrically aligned out-of-plane dipoles. Building on experimentally demonstrated 1$\\times N$ integrated beam splitters with arbitrary power ratios, we propose an on-chip architecture where each output arm hosts an Nb$_3$Cl$_8$ patch, optionally gated by graphene to tune the complex $n$-photon amplitudes.

In this study, we compute the valence and conduction band alignments of nonpolar ($a$-plane) and polar ($c$-plane) B$_x$Al$_{1-x}$N, and compare them with those of AlN and GaN. Using density functional theory, many-body perturbation theory, $GW_0$ method, and a novel passivation scheme, we find that they have near-zero valence band alignments for low-$x$ B$_x$Al$_{1-x}$N/AlN, while higher compositions ($x > $0.333) exhibit type I or II band alignments. The band alignments also show a notable dependence on surface polarity and the tetrahedral distortion of the B$_x$Al$_{1-x}$N structures. Our computed offsets are in good agreement with available experimental data. Due to their low valence band alignments and higher conduction band alignments, the B$_x$Al$_{1-x}$N/AlN heterostructures could be well suited for high-electron-mobility transistors and ultraviolet light-emitting diodes.

Their protection against external magnetic field relies on strong Ising spin-orbit coupling, which originates from in-plane inversion symmetry breaking. Due to the heavy atom nature of Ising SCs, a smaller but sizable Rashba SOC could be present through gating or interfacial effects. Here, we consider the effect of Rashba SOC in a two valley model of Ising superconductors with an attractive $s$-wave interaction. We show that Rashba SOC gives a critical magnetic field, above which the superconducting order parameter collapses at low temperatures. This effect, however, disappears at high temperatures. Our findings demonstrate that the low- and high temperature physics of Ising SCs is quantitatively and qualitatively different in our two-valley model, and may lead to new ways to determine the strength of the Rashba SOC in Ising SCs."}

Rupert"], "title": "Local chemical order suppresses grain boundary migration under irradiation in CrCoNi", "comment": null, "summary": "Complex concentrated alloys with intrinsic chemical heterogeneity are promising candidates for nuclear applications, where local chemical order can strongly influence defect evolution under irradiation. Grain boundaries also contribute to radiation damage mitigation by serving as defect sinks, yet this interaction can alter interfacial structure, typically leading to destabilization and grain growth. This study investigates how chemical ordering influences grain boundary migration and stability during successive radiation events in CrCoNi. Using atomistic simulations, bicrystals were equilibrated to induce segregation-enhanced chemical order, followed by prolonged irradiation at 1100 K. Our results show that grain boundaries in random CrCoNi begin to migrate after only a few collision cascades, whereas those in the ordered alloy remain immobile until the chemical order is sufficiently disrupted. Single-cascade simulations reveal key mechanistic differences, where cascades near chemically ordered interfaces produce smaller damage volumes and reduced atomic displacement due to enhanced Frenkel pair combination within the cascade core. This limits both the residual defect population and the energetic driving force for interfacial rearrangement. Subsequent simulations of irradiated interfaces show that interstitial absorption induces a structural transition that modifies the segregation morphology at and near the grain boundary, demonstrating a dynamic coupling between ordering stability and defect evolution. These findings offer new insights into the role of local chemical order on defect-interface interactions under extreme conditions and highlight pathways for designing radiation-tolerant materials for next-generation nuclear systems."}

The particle positions are recorded to identify when a predefined region near the wall is empty, allowing the piston to compress the colloidal suspension without applying work on the system. We find that the stored compression energy is universally set by the probability of a positive measurement outcome, which in turn is controlled by parameters such as density and compression step size.

We perform large-scale Monte Carlo simulations for the LR-Heisenberg model in two dimensions (2D) up to linear size $L=8192$, and show that, as long as for $σ\\leq 2$, the system exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking, via a single continuous phase transition, and develops a generic long-range order.
