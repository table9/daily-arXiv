Comments are welcome", "summary": "Recently, coexisting ferroelectricity and superconductivity were reported in bilayer T$_{\\textrm{d}}$-MoTe$_2$ and twisted bilayer graphene. Importantly, it was observed that an applied displacement field switches the superconductivity with a ferroelectric hysteresis. Such direct coupling between the ferroelectricity and superconductivity offers promising pathways for developing low-power, non-volatile memory devices. However, the coupling mechanism between the ferroelectricity and superconductivity remains poorly understood. In this work, we demonstrate that in a superconducting bilayer, the hysteretic switching of superconductivity can arise from an interlayer pairing. By deriving the Landau Ginzburg free energy expansion for the interlayer pairing, we show that along the ferroelectric hysteresis loop, the hysteretic exceeding of the critical polarization $P_{\\textrm{c}}$ that destroys the interlayer pairing leads to the hysteretic switching of superconductivity. The condition to have a ferroelectric hysteretic superconducting state is established to be $P_{\\textrm{r}}<P_{\\textrm{c}}<P_{\\textrm{s}}$, where $P_{\\textrm{r}}$ and $P_{\\textrm{s}}$ denote the remanent and saturated polarization, respectively. Crucially, our scenario of interlayer pairing yields two predictions: (1) an enhancement of the upper critical displacement field with stronger interlayer coupling and (2) a pronounced, gate-tunable interlayer crossed Andreev reflection, both of which provide clear pathways for experimental verification."}

Here, we report ambient-pressure superconductivity onset at ~63 K in epitaxial (La,Pr)3Ni2O7 thin films grown under compressive strain on SrLaAlO4 substrates. This Tc leap is enabled by pushing our gigantic-oxidative atomic-layer-by-layer epitaxy (GAE) method into an extreme non-equilibrium growth regime. It leverages powerful in situ oxidation to simultaneously enhance kinetics via higher temperatures and achieve full oxygenation without post-annealing. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction and scanning transmission electron microscopy confirm that this approach yields films of large-scale crystalline purity, overcoming the inherent metastability of the strained superconducting phase. These films exhibit a systematic evolution in their normal-state resistivity-temperature curve: the power-law exponent $α$ evolves from Fermi-liquid-like ($α$ ~2) at lower Tc to strange-metal-like ($α$ ~1) in higher Tc samples, directly linking the enhanced superconductivity to non-Fermi liquid behavior. Mapping the vortex melting phase diagram by the mutual inductance technique further reveals 2D melting limit suppressed to near zero, which demonstrates significantly stronger interlayer coupling than that of cuprates. These results identify the nickelates as an anisotropic-3D high-Tc system exhibiting strange-metal behavior, presenting an alternative framework to the quasi-2D cuprate paradigm."}

To overcome this challenge, implementing three-dimensional (3D) vertical architectures becomes crucial. Niobium (Nb), due to its excellent superconducting characteristics and strong fabrication process compatibility, stands out as a prime material choice. The main challenge in Nb-Nb bonding is the presence of an oxide layer at the interface, even after post-bonding annealing across various bonding methods. The native Nb oxide forms rapidly in air, creating a resistive barrier to supercurrent flow and introducing two-level system losses that degrade qubit coherence while increasing the overall thermal budget. These issues show the need for effective surface engineering to suppress oxidation during bonding. This study introduces an ultrathin gold (Au) capping layer as a passivation strategy to prevent oxygen incorporation at the Nb surface. This approach enables low-temperature Nb-Nb thermocompression bonding at 350 °C under a reduced bonding pressure of 0.495 MPa. Detailed microstructural and interfacial analyses confirm that Au passivation effectively suppresses oxide formation and hence enhances bonding uniformity and strength with keeping the superconductivity, establishing a robust route toward low-temperature, low-pressure Nb-Nb bonding for scalable 3D superconducting quantum computing architectures."}

This paper presents a persistent-variable formulation for thermal compositional flow using enthalpy to formulate the energy balance and the local equilibrium problem. Equilibrium conditions are derived from a thermodynamically consistent minimization problem using a persistent set of variables, allowing for seamless integration of equilibrium calculations into a fully coupled flow and transport model. This formulation does not require phase stability tests and provides a continuous and full mathematical description of the multiphysics system, suitable for challenging non-isothermal scenarios. To tackle the nonlinearities arising from phase transitions, we embed a local solver for the thermodynamic subproblem within a global Newton solver for the fully implicit system. The local solver exploits the locality of the subproblem for parallelization and leverages the modularity of the persistent-variable formulation for both isothermal and isenthalpic equilibrium conditions locally. We demonstrate the capability of our approach to simulate complex high-enthalpy systems, including narrow-boiling phenomena. The impact of the embedded local solver is analyzed through numerical experiments, demonstrating a reduction in global nonlinear iterations of up to 23 \\% with increased use of the local solver. The number of local iterations is controlled with a local solver tolerance and no significant impact on the global iteration number was observed for local residual tolerances as high as $1e-3$. The persistent-variable approach using enthalpy and the modularity of the embedded local solver advance the usage of equilibrium calculations in multiphase flow simulations and are suitable for high-enthalpy applications."}

Starting from this framework, we derive the Ginzburg-Landau free energy and identify, in addition to the conventional pair-breaking term, a coupling between the spin and the spatial variation of the superconducting order parameter. Two distinct effects emerge from this coupling. The first is a magnetoelectric effect, in which a supercurrent (i.e., a phase gradient) induces a spin texture; this contribution is quadratic in the phase gradient. The second effect arises when the magnitude, rather than the phase, of the superconducting order parameter varies in space, likewise leading to a finite magnetization. We show that these two contributions compete in the case of an Abrikosov vortex, where both the amplitude and phase of the order parameter vary spatially. The effect associated with amplitude variations also gives rise to a proximity-induced magnetization (PIM) in hybrid structures composed of a superconductor (S) and an altermagnet (AM). Using quasiclassical theory, we analyze the PIM in diffusive S/AM bilayers and S/AM/S Josephson junctions, and determine the induced magnetization profiles. In Josephson junctions, where both the PIM and the magnetoelectric effect coexist, we further predict the occurrence of $0$-$π$ transitions."}

In this work, we propose symmetry-preserving deformations of these models, in the presence of a transverse field, and identify special points along the deformations with interesting features: (i) the special point is frustration-free, (ii) its ground states include a product state and the code space of the underlying code, and (iii) it remains gapped in the thermodynamic (infinite volume) limit. So the special point realises a first-order transition between (or the coexistence of) the trivial gapped phase and the nontrivial gapped phase associated with the code. In addition, if the original model has a non-invertible duality symmetry, then so does the deformed model. In this case, the duality symmetry is spontaneously broken at the special point, consistent with the associated anomaly.\n  A key step in proving the gap is a coarse-graining/blocking procedure on the Tanner graph of the code that allows us to apply the martingale method successfully. Our model, therefore, provides the first application of the martingale method to a frustration-free model, that is not commuting projector, defined on an arbitrary Tanner graph.\n  We also discuss several familiar examples on Euclidean spatial lattice. Of particular interest is the 2+1d transverse field Ising model: while there is no non-invertible duality symmetry in this case, our results, together with known numerical results, suggest the existence of a tricritical point in the phase diagram."}

Here we introduce a model for light--Andreev interaction, with distinct features: Electrons transitioning into Andreev levels can sidestep Pauli exclusion, resulting in two optical absorption resonances separated by twice the bound state energy. One resonance populates the Andreev state and the other empties it; pumping both resets the junction and prevents saturation.

In this work, we show that qualitatively new features arise when an in-plane magnetic field is applied to a 3D Weyl semimetal in the quantum Hall regime. An unexpected Hall quantum oscillation, distinct from the Weyl-orbit oscillation, coexists with the QHE, along with an unquantized two-terminal magnetoresistance. Moreover, unconventional antichiral transmission enables a peculiar disorder-robust negative longitudinal resistance. Quantization tunable by the lead configuration is further found in this transport geometry. A unique type of nonlocal quantum backscattering channels underlies these phenomena. Our work demonstrates a breakdown of the topological characterization of transport even with 3D Chern numbers and reveals hidden 3D QHE transport properties. It opens a new class of transport measurements and phenomena."}

A lightweight C++ lambda-based layer enables CPU, CUDA, and HIP execution without OpenMP/OpenACC preprocessor directives.

Contrary to its popular applications in various cross-disciplinary fields, the fundamental study of Persson's theory of contact attracted little attention from the tribology and contact mechanics communities. As far as the authors know, many researchers struggle to understand the derivation of the theory. Few attempts have been made to clarify the oversimplified derivation provided by Persson (Persson, 2001). The present work provides a detailed tutorial on Persson's theory, which does not simply follow the commonly adopted derivation initiated by Persson. A new derivation is given based on stochastic process theory, assuming that the variation of the random contact pressure with respect to scale is a Markov process. We revisit the essential assumptions utilized to derive the diffusion equation, boundary conditions, drift and diffusion coefficients, and closed-form results. This tutorial can serve as a self-consistent introduction for solid mechanicians, tribologists, and postgraduate students who are not familiar with Persson's theory, or who struggle to understand it."}

The buffer layer improves the structural quality of the AlInN layer, as evidenced by reduced full width at half maximum values in X-ray diffraction rocking curves around the AlInN (0002) peak. Atomic force microscopy reveals that the buffer layer does not alter surface roughness. The effectiveness of the a-Si buffer is demonstrated by an enhancement of the conversion efficiency under AM1.5G illumination from 3.3 % to 3.9 % for devices with 35 % Al. Looking at the effect of the Al content in devices with the a-Si buffer, the device with 22% Al shows the best photovoltaic performance, with a conversion efficiency of 4.1 % and a VOC of 0.42 V, JSC of 15.4 mA/cm2, and FF of 63.3%. However, performance declines for Al contents above 36% due to increased resistivity and reduced carrier concentration. These findings highlight the critical role of the novel a-Si buffer layer developed by RF-sputtering and the Al content in optimizing AlInN/Si heterojunction solar cell performance."}

Spin-polarized DFT calculations on 240 bimetallic clusters reveal systematic trends in binding and formation energies, distortion penalties, effective coordination number, d-band centre, and HOMO-LUMO gap that govern the competition between core-shell (in) and surface-segregated (out) arrangements. We then pretrain a transformer architecture on a curated set of 2968 unary clusters from the Quantum Cluster Database and fine-tune it on bimetallic data to predict formation energies and in/out preference, achieving mean absolute errors of about $0.6-0.7$eV and calibrated uncertainty intervals. The resulting model rapidly adapts to an unseen Fe-host domain with only a handful of labelled examples.

The reason for this lies not only in the unique nature of these extremely thin samples, but also in the different experimental configurations and data processing methods used. Moreover, since this type of spectroscopy was originally used to characterize the ultrafast relaxation dynamics of photoexcited carriers in chemical compounds, colloidal nanostructures and gas molecules, a purely 'molecular' approach to interpreting transient absorption spectra of 2D semiconductors is often proposed. However, this approach is fundamentally inapplicable to thin-film semiconductors grown or mechanically exfoliated on transparent substrates. This review considers the recent experimental results of ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy of 2D semiconductors in a wide spectral range from several THz to UV (~1000 THz) based on the 'solid-state' approach to their interpretation. We also highlight typical errors that arise in measuring, processing and interpreting transient absorption spectra of 2D semiconductors."}

Both methods are general and can handle an arbitrary equation of state and arbitrary number of species.

In this work, we propose symmetry-preserving deformations of these models, in the presence of a transverse field, and identify special points along the deformations with interesting features: (i) the special point is frustration-free, (ii) its ground states include a product state and the code space of the underlying code, and (iii) it remains gapped in the thermodynamic (infinite volume) limit. So the special point realises a first-order transition between (or the coexistence of) the trivial gapped phase and the nontrivial gapped phase associated with the code. In addition, if the original model has a non-invertible duality symmetry, then so does the deformed model. In this case, the duality symmetry is spontaneously broken at the special point, consistent with the associated anomaly.\n  A key step in proving the gap is a coarse-graining/blocking procedure on the Tanner graph of the code that allows us to apply the martingale method successfully. Our model, therefore, provides the first application of the martingale method to a frustration-free model, that is not commuting projector, defined on an arbitrary Tanner graph.\n  We also discuss several familiar examples on Euclidean spatial lattice. Of particular interest is the 2+1d transverse field Ising model: while there is no non-invertible duality symmetry in this case, our results, together with known numerical results, suggest the existence of a tricritical point in the phase diagram."}

A unification of leading order parameters of 2+1 dimensional $N$ four-component Dirac fermions collects all Lorentz-singlet mass-like fermion bilinears, except the one condensing in the QAH state, into an irreducible representation of the O($M=4N$), and predicts another phase transition in the Gross-Neveu model to occur at a strong (repulsive) coupling. Here, a fermionic auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo algorithm is employed in order to study a lattice realization of the Gross-Neveu field theory in the repulsive regime, where the sign problem is absent. We indeed find the O($4N$) symmetry breaking transition out of Dirac semimetal to occur and to be weakly first-order for $N=2$, relevant to graphene. The size of the discontinuity and the magnitude of the critical coupling, however, both grow with $N$. Adding a finite chemical potential is found to break the symmetry and cause superconductivity. These results are in broad agreement with the predictions of the unified field theory. Our lattice model also displays an interesting exact O($2N$) symmetry, a subgroup of the low-energy O($4N$), and has the ordered ground state with the order parameter that belongs to its $N(2N-1)$-dimensional representation. Other order parameters are also examined, and a certain hierarchy among those that belong to different representations of the exact $O(2N)$ is observed."}

While Sak's criterion, $σ_* = 2 - η_{\\mathrm{SR}}$, has been widely accepted, recent studies of two-dimensional (2D) models with long-range interactions have challenged it. In this work, we focus on the crossover between LR and SR criticality in several classical 2D statistical models, including the XY, Heisenberg, percolation, and Ising models, whose interactions decay as $1/r^{2+σ}$. Our previous simulations for the XY, Heisenberg, and percolation models consistently indicate a universal boundary at $σ_* = 2$. Here, we complete the picture by performing large-scale Monte Carlo simulations of the 2D LR-Ising model, reaching lattice sizes up to $L = 8192$. By analyzing the Fortuin-Kasteleyn critical polynomial $R_p$, the Binder ratio $Q_m$, and the anomalous dimension $η$, we obtain convergent and self-consistent evidence that the universality class already changes sharply at $σ= 2$. Taken together, these results establish a unified scenario for LR interacting systems: across all studied models, the crossover from LR to SR universality occurs at $σ_* = 2$."}

Yet, the effect of graphene (Gr) on the electrical conductivity of CGCs remains elusive, and their electrical performance is still controversial. This work addresses these unresolved questions by unambiguously quantifying how the electrical properties of CGCs depend on the characteristics of Gr and Cu. Gr is synthesized on Cu foils, foams, and wires by utilizing a wide range of chemical vapor deposition conditions to independently control their characteristics. Then the Gr-enhanced electrical conductivity (Δσ) is characterized for CGCs with different Cu geometries and Gr qualities. This study confirms that unprecedented electrical conductivity (Δσ = 17.1%) can be achieved only when both Gr and Cu are carefully optimized. Specifically, the study reveals three key factors: (1) Δσ is positively correlated with continuity of Gr; (2) CGCs with a continuous monolayer Gr exhibit a strong Δσ-A_s linear relation where A_s is the specific surface area of a CGC; and (3) Δσ becomes more pronounced when a Cu matrix has a curved cross-section. This work reveals the fundamental mechanisms of how Gr influences the overall electrical conductivity of CGCs and, therefore, is a crucial step toward designing and manufacturing high-performance CGC conductors for emerging applications."}

Here we introduce a model for light--Andreev interaction, with distinct features: Electrons transitioning into Andreev levels can sidestep Pauli exclusion, resulting in two optical absorption resonances separated by twice the bound state energy. One resonance populates the Andreev state and the other empties it; pumping both resets the junction and prevents saturation.

Neural Operators (NOs) have recently emerged as powerful data-driven alternatives to traditional solvers; however, existing architectures often accumulate temporal errors, struggle to generalize in long-horizon simulations, and require large training datasets. To overcome these limitations, we propose PENCO (Physics-Energy-Numerical-Consistent Operator), a hybrid operator-learning framework that integrates physical laws and numerical structure within a data-driven architecture. The formulation introduces an enhanced L^2 Gauss-Lobatto collocation residual around the temporal midpoint that robustly enforces the governing dynamics and significantly improves accuracy, a Fourier-space numerical consistency term that captures the balanced behavior of semi-implicit discretizations, and an energy-dissipation constraint that ensures thermodynamic consistency. Additional low-frequency spectral anchoring and teacher-consistency mechanisms further stabilize learning and suppress long-term error growth. This hybrid design enables PENCO to preserve governing physics while mitigating long-term error growth. Through extensive three-dimensional phase-field benchmarks covering phase ordering, crystallization, epitaxial growth, and complex pattern formation, PENCO demonstrates superior accuracy, stability, and data efficiency compared to state-of-the-art neural operators, including Multi-Head Neural Operator (MHNO) and Fourier Neural Operator (FNO-4D), while maintaining physically consistent evolution.

Here we study how inverse turbulent cascades (from small to large scales) transition from weak to strong. We find that while one-loop corrections can be dependent on excitation and dissipation scales, new types of universality appear in strong turbulence. We contrast turbulence of spin waves in ferromagnets with turbulent cascades in the Nonlinear Schrödinger Equation (NSE) and in an MMT-like model in higher dimensions having a multiplicative interaction vertex: vertex renormalization gives rise to dependence on the pumping (UV scale) in the former but not in the latter. As a result of this spectral nonlocality, spin-wave turbulence stops being weak if one is sufficiently far from the pumping scale, even when the interaction of waves with comparable wavenumbers is weak. We paraphrase this as: nonlocality enhances nonlinearity.\n  We then describe strong turbulence in a multi-component version of these models with a large number of components. We argue that strong spin-wave turbulence is similar to turbulence of the focusing NSE, as it realizes a critical-balance state. However, UV nonlocality causes the level of spin-wave turbulence at large scales to decrease with increasing pumping level, culminating in a state that is independent of the level of pumping."}

In this study, we rewrite the formula in terms of the degree of sharpness of the corner, and show that the corner charge formula also holds for cases with arbitrary genus. We also extend our formula to vertex-transitive shell polyhedra, which are closed or open polyhedra without the bulk region, with all the vertices related by symmetry.

Ab initio density-functional theory calculations as a function of pressure fully corroborate the experimental observations. The transition unfolds as a 2-fold superstructure due to the emergence of commensurate superlattice reflections and can be progressively suppressed from 1030 K down to 20 K under 14 GPa. No discernible structural distortions associated with DW ordering are detected down to 20 K at ambient pressure.

The current is sensitive to the orientation of the edge in respect to the main axes of the altermagnet. The edge spin galvanic current reverses its direction upon a reversal of the non-equilibrium spin direction or the Néel vector.

Hybrid tracking lead to a relative difference of about 20% in the outboard side blanket, where as employment of delta tracking resulted in less than 1% relative difference.

Because torques are site-resolved vectors, each configuration supplies many independent constraints, which makes the regression well conditioned and sharply reduces the number of DFT calculations needed, especially in large supercells. Applied to the B20-type chiral magnets ${\\rm Mn}_{1-x}{\\rm Fe}_{x}{\\rm Ge}$ and ${\\rm Fe}_{1-y}{\\rm Co}_{y}{\\rm Ge}$, the resulting models nonperturbatively extract the full pairwise exchange tensor (isotropic exchange, anisotropic symmetric exchange, and the Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya interaction) and predict helical spin period via a micromagnetic mapping. The composition trends and the divergence of the period near the chirality sign change are reproduced in line with experiments. Because the SCE framework is systematic, it also enables systematic analysis of interaction order; training on increasingly disordered spin configurations shows that the lowest-order model loses torque accuracy, whereas including higher-order interactions restores predictive power. These advances enable near-DFT-accurate spin models for finite-temperature magnetism and complex textures at modest data cost, while providing a systematic, extensible, and nonperturbative route to quantitative first-principles parameterization and predictive materials design. An open-source implementation is available as the Julia package, \\textit{Magesty.jl}."}

The buffer layer improves the structural quality of the AlInN layer, as evidenced by reduced full width at half maximum values in X-ray diffraction rocking curves around the AlInN (0002) peak. Atomic force microscopy reveals that the buffer layer does not alter surface roughness. The effectiveness of the a-Si buffer is demonstrated by an enhancement of the conversion efficiency under AM1.5G illumination from 3.3 % to 3.9 % for devices with 35 % Al. Looking at the effect of the Al content in devices with the a-Si buffer, the device with 22% Al shows the best photovoltaic performance, with a conversion efficiency of 4.1 % and a VOC of 0.42 V, JSC of 15.4 mA/cm2, and FF of 63.3%. However, performance declines for Al contents above 36% due to increased resistivity and reduced carrier concentration. These findings highlight the critical role of the novel a-Si buffer layer developed by RF-sputtering and the Al content in optimizing AlInN/Si heterojunction solar cell performance."}

We construct a lattice model with direction-dependent nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor hoppings that faithfully reproduces the continuum dispersion and allows controlled rotation of the Fermi contour. Employing a multiterminal geometry and the Büttiker-probe method, we compute the resulting Hall voltage and establish its direct correspondence with the continuum transverse response. The effect increases with the degree of anisotropy and vanishes at rotation angles where mirror symmetry is restored. Unlike the quantum Hall effect, the Hall response predicted here is not quantized but varies continuously with the band-structure parameters.

Comments are welcome", "summary": "Recently, coexisting ferroelectricity and superconductivity were reported in bilayer T$_{\\textrm{d}}$-MoTe$_2$ and twisted bilayer graphene. Importantly, it was observed that an applied displacement field switches the superconductivity with a ferroelectric hysteresis. Such direct coupling between the ferroelectricity and superconductivity offers promising pathways for developing low-power, non-volatile memory devices. However, the coupling mechanism between the ferroelectricity and superconductivity remains poorly understood. In this work, we demonstrate that in a superconducting bilayer, the hysteretic switching of superconductivity can arise from an interlayer pairing. By deriving the Landau Ginzburg free energy expansion for the interlayer pairing, we show that along the ferroelectric hysteresis loop, the hysteretic exceeding of the critical polarization $P_{\\textrm{c}}$ that destroys the interlayer pairing leads to the hysteretic switching of superconductivity. The condition to have a ferroelectric hysteretic superconducting state is established to be $P_{\\textrm{r}}<P_{\\textrm{c}}<P_{\\textrm{s}}$, where $P_{\\textrm{r}}$ and $P_{\\textrm{s}}$ denote the remanent and saturated polarization, respectively. Crucially, our scenario of interlayer pairing yields two predictions: (1) an enhancement of the upper critical displacement field with stronger interlayer coupling and (2) a pronounced, gate-tunable interlayer crossed Andreev reflection, both of which provide clear pathways for experimental verification."}

Tracking the qubit frequency reduces the impact of low frequency noise in the qubit frequency and improves the $T^{Rabi}$ from 7 to 11 $μ$s at a Rabi frequency of 5 MHz, resulting in Q-factors exceeding 50. Randomized benchmarking returns an average single gate control fidelity of 99.5 $\\pm$ 0.3%. As a result of pulse-area calibration, this fidelity is limited by the Rabi Q-factor.

One material optimization strategy that has still been quite overlooked is interface engineering, specifically, tailoring the electrode/dielectric interface to modulate oxygen exchange. Here, we demonstrate that introducing materials with high ionic mobility can significantly expand the accessible oxygen concentration range within the dielectric layer, significantly broadening the memory window. Using SrTiO3-based memristive stacks, we integrated an ion-conducting SrCoO3 interfacial layer to facilitate oxygen transfer, increasing the number of distinguishable resistance states from 8 to 22. This modification also reduced the SET/RESET voltage by 50% and markedly improved device endurance, albeit with a trade-off of reduced state retention. To assess the practical implications of this trade-off, we trained a two-layer fully connected neural network using the experimental SrTiO3/SrCoO3 memristor characteristics on the MNIST handwritten digit dataset. Networks with hidden-layer sizes between 64 and 256 memristive elements achieved classification errors below 7%. The observed temporal drift means the functional state must be updated at intervals of less than 1 h to maintain reliable operation. Finally, we confirmed the transferability of this interface-engineering approach by applying it to HfOx-based devices, achieving a similarly enhanced memory window."}

However, the targeted synthesis of HEO materials is often hindered by competing stabilizing and destabilizing factors, which are difficult to predict. This work examines the effects of increased configurational entropy on the phase formation and stability of four notable complex oxide families: perovskite ($AB$O$_3$}), pyrochlore ($A_2B_2$O$_7$), Ruddlesden-Popper ($A_2B$O$_4$), and zirconium tungstate ($AB_2$O$_8$). Each of these structures has a tetravalent cation site, which we attempt to substitute with an entropic mixture of four cations, benchmarked by the parallel synthesis of a non-disordered reference compound. While all four target high entropy materials can be expected to form based on ionic radii criteria, only the high entropy perovskite Ba(Ti,Zr,Hf,Sn)O$_3$ is successfully synthesized. In the case of the pyrochlore, an entropy-stabilized defect fluorite is formed instead, while the Ruddlesden-Popper phase co-exists with multiple competing phases. For the tungstate, an unexpected deep eutectic point between the precursors results in melting that precedes the formation of a high entropy phase. Our case studies therefore illustrate that the stability of HEOs cannot be straightforwardly predicted based on ionic radii, lattice geometry, and charge-balancing considerations alone due to the underlying complexity of the interactions between the many chemical constituents."}

Yet, the effect of graphene (Gr) on the electrical conductivity of CGCs remains elusive, and their electrical performance is still controversial. This work addresses these unresolved questions by unambiguously quantifying how the electrical properties of CGCs depend on the characteristics of Gr and Cu. Gr is synthesized on Cu foils, foams, and wires by utilizing a wide range of chemical vapor deposition conditions to independently control their characteristics. Then the Gr-enhanced electrical conductivity (Δσ) is characterized for CGCs with different Cu geometries and Gr qualities. This study confirms that unprecedented electrical conductivity (Δσ = 17.1%) can be achieved only when both Gr and Cu are carefully optimized. Specifically, the study reveals three key factors: (1) Δσ is positively correlated with continuity of Gr; (2) CGCs with a continuous monolayer Gr exhibit a strong Δσ-A_s linear relation where A_s is the specific surface area of a CGC; and (3) Δσ becomes more pronounced when a Cu matrix has a curved cross-section. This work reveals the fundamental mechanisms of how Gr influences the overall electrical conductivity of CGCs and, therefore, is a crucial step toward designing and manufacturing high-performance CGC conductors for emerging applications."}

These findings highlight complementary design strategies: interlayer sliding enables sensitivity to external tuning, while the Janus intralayer polarization enhances photoresponses in the visible range. The interplay between composition and stacking therefore provides a versatile platform for tailoring light-matter interactions in 2D ferroelectric materials."}

In this work, we show that qualitatively new features arise when an in-plane magnetic field is applied to a 3D Weyl semimetal in the quantum Hall regime. An unexpected Hall quantum oscillation, distinct from the Weyl-orbit oscillation, coexists with the QHE, along with an unquantized two-terminal magnetoresistance. Moreover, unconventional antichiral transmission enables a peculiar disorder-robust negative longitudinal resistance. Quantization tunable by the lead configuration is further found in this transport geometry. A unique type of nonlocal quantum backscattering channels underlies these phenomena. Our work demonstrates a breakdown of the topological characterization of transport even with 3D Chern numbers and reveals hidden 3D QHE transport properties.

The composite integrates narrow-bandgap CuO, plasmonic Ag/AgCl, and visible-responsive g-C3N4 into a dual Z-scheme configuration that promotes efficient interfacial charge transfer while preserving strong redox potentials. Diffuse reflectance UV-Vis spectra ascertained the bandgap positions of the composite corresponding to those of its constituents: 2.9 eV (g-C3N4) and 1.42 eV (Ag-doped CuO-AgCl), indicating enhanced absorption and efficient charge carrier generation. BET analysis confirmed the presence of mesoporosity and revealed an effective surface area, ensuring the availability of abundant adsorption and reaction sites. A commercial 11 W UV irradiation was used for the photocatalytic test. Almost complete degradation of MB occurred within 10 min, following pseudo-first-order kinetics with a high apparent rate constant of 0.45/min. The remarkable activity arises from the synergistic interplay of Fenton-like redox cycling and efficient photoinduced charge carrier generation and separation. In addition, it has been demonstrated that intentionally incorporated AgCl plays an active role as a plasmonic-semiconducting interface, strengthening charge separation and catalyst stability under neutral conditions, rather than acting as a passive chloride byproduct. Overall, by linking defect engineering, heterojunction design, and photo-Fenton synergy, this study establishes a low-power, catalytic platform offering a viable pathway towards sustainable dye wastewater remediation."}

However, the synthesis of nitrogene has remained elusive due to the strong nitrogen-nitrogen triple bonds. Here, we report experimental evidence of the formation of nitrogen-based crystalline structures compatible with nitrogene on silver surfaces via ion-beam-assisted epitaxy. Through a combination of scanning tunneling microscopy, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, and first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that the nitrogene-like structure adopts a puckered honeycomb lattice.

Importantly, it was observed that an applied displacement field switches the superconductivity with a ferroelectric hysteresis. Such direct coupling between the ferroelectricity and superconductivity offers promising pathways for developing low-power, non-volatile memory devices. However, the coupling mechanism between the ferroelectricity and superconductivity remains poorly understood. In this work, we demonstrate that in a superconducting bilayer, the hysteretic switching of superconductivity can arise from an interlayer pairing. By deriving the Landau Ginzburg free energy expansion for the interlayer pairing, we show that along the ferroelectric hysteresis loop, the hysteretic exceeding of the critical polarization $P_{\\textrm{c}}$ that destroys the interlayer pairing leads to the hysteretic switching of superconductivity. The condition to have a ferroelectric hysteretic superconducting state is established to be $P_{\\textrm{r}}<P_{\\textrm{c}}<P_{\\textrm{s}}$, where $P_{\\textrm{r}}$ and $P_{\\textrm{s}}$ denote the remanent and saturated polarization, respectively. Crucially, our scenario of interlayer pairing yields two predictions: (1) an enhancement of the upper critical displacement field with stronger interlayer coupling and (2) a pronounced, gate-tunable interlayer crossed Andreev reflection, both of which provide clear pathways for experimental verification."}

In recent derivations of this type of transport equations that are based on the density matrix formalism, there remain, however, certain omissions. These derivations also rely on a particular type of relaxation time approximation and a band-diagonal form of the interaction self-energies. In this work we derive the interband terms of the electronic Boltzmann transport equation starting from the Keldysh formulation of the quantum kinetic equation and considering the band non-diagonality of the electron-impurity and electron-phonon self-energies. We introduce a minimally modified Kadanoff-Baym Ansatz, and find a quantum-corrected, matrix Boltzmann transport equation that is well beyond the current state of the art theory. We show that the occupations and coherences are interdependent, and that the kinetic corrections due to the included interactions cannot, in general, be ignored. This work clarifies the various approximations that must be introduced in an ab initio derivation of Boltzmann-like equations and finds a new matrix Boltzmann transport equation that is suitable for parameters-free numerical implementations."}

Single-phase HEPCs are synthesized by the solid-phase method in this work, in which the effects of the heavy rare-earth elements Dy, Ho and Er on the structure and magnetic properties of Ln-LNSEMO are systematically studied. The results show that all Ln-LNSEMO HEPCs exhibit high crystallinity and maintain excellent structural stability after sintering at 1250 degree centigrade for 16 h. Ln-LNSEMO HEPCs exhibit significant lattice distortion effects, with smooth surface morphology, clearly distinguishable grain boundaries, and irregular polygonal shapes. The three high-entropy ceramic samples exhibit hysteresis behavior at T = 5 K, with the Curie temperature TC decreasing as the radius of the introduced rare-earth ions decreases, while the saturation magnetization and coercivity increase accordingly. When the average ionic radius of A-site decreases, the interaction between their valence electrons and local electrons in the crystal increases, thereby enhancing the conversion of electrons to oriented magnetic moments under an external magnetic field. Thus, Er-LNSEMO HEPC shows a higher saturation magnetization strength (42.8 emu/g) and coercivity (2.09 kOe) than the other samples, which is attributed to the strong magnetic crystal anisotropy, larger lattice distortion (0.00652), smaller average grain size (440.49 plus or minus 22.02 nm), unit cell volume (229.432 A3) and A-site average ion radius (1.24 A) of its magnet.

An isostructural phase transition, marked by an abrupt volume collapse at 13 GPa, is observed exclusively in type-I sodium borosilicide clathrates.

This mechanism provides the first experimental validation of a transition predicted theoretically for this class of materials.

The reason for this lies not only in the unique nature of these extremely thin samples, but also in the different experimental configurations and data processing methods used. Moreover, since this type of spectroscopy was originally used to characterize the ultrafast relaxation dynamics of photoexcited carriers in chemical compounds, colloidal nanostructures and gas molecules, a purely 'molecular' approach to interpreting transient absorption spectra of 2D semiconductors is often proposed. However, this approach is fundamentally inapplicable to thin-film semiconductors grown or mechanically exfoliated on transparent substrates. This review considers the recent experimental results of ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy of 2D semiconductors in a wide spectral range from several THz to UV (~1000 THz) based on the 'solid-state' approach to their interpretation. We also highlight typical errors that arise in measuring, processing and interpreting transient absorption spectra of 2D semiconductors."}

Starting from this framework, we derive the Ginzburg-Landau free energy and identify, in addition to the conventional pair-breaking term, a coupling between the spin and the spatial variation of the superconducting order parameter. Two distinct effects emerge from this coupling. The first is a magnetoelectric effect, in which a supercurrent (i.e., a phase gradient) induces a spin texture; this contribution is quadratic in the phase gradient. The second effect arises when the magnitude, rather than the phase, of the superconducting order parameter varies in space, likewise leading to a finite magnetization. We show that these two contributions compete in the case of an Abrikosov vortex, where both the amplitude and phase of the order parameter vary spatially. The effect associated with amplitude variations also gives rise to a proximity-induced magnetization (PIM) in hybrid structures composed of a superconductor (S) and an altermagnet (AM). Using quasiclassical theory, we analyze the PIM in diffusive S/AM bilayers and S/AM/S Josephson junctions, and determine the induced magnetization profiles. In Josephson junctions, where both the PIM and the magnetoelectric effect coexist, we further predict the occurrence of $0$-$π$ transitions."}

Accepted author manuscript of article published in Carbon 217 (2024) 118605", "summary": "Thermal plasma has emerged as an effective approach for producing carbon nanostructures without the need for specific catalysts nor substrates. While efforts have focused on the effect of process parameters such as reaction pressure, input power or carbon source, the intricate role and relationship with plasma characteristics like density and temperature are often overlooked due to the complexity of the environment. This study addresses this gap by establishing a correlation between process parameters, plasma characteristics, and product morphology, essential for controlling the growth of carbon nanostructures. We explored the impact of carbon precursor type (CH4 and C2H2), hydrogen, pressure, and flow rate on nanostructure formation. Using in situ optical emission spectroscopy (OES), we mapped the distribution of both temperature and dicarbon molecule (C2) density within the plasma jet. We demonstrate that the growth of low-density nanostructures, such as carbon nanohorns (CNHs), is favoured at dilute C2 local densities and high temperatures, while denser nanostructures, such as onion-like polyhedral graphitic nanocapsules (GNCs), are favoured at higher C2 densities and lower temperatures. The carbon density can be controlled by the flow rate and the pressure, which in turn significantly influence the nanostructure morphology, evolving from graphene nanoflakes (GNFs) to GNCs as either parameter increases. Increasing the H/C ratio from 1 to 8 resulted in a morphological transition from CNHs to GNFs. During the synthesis, the plasma jet temperature surpassed 3,000 K, with crystalline growth occurring 50 to 100 mm below the nozzle."}

The key idea is to fit an SCE model to magnetic torques rather than to total energies. Because torques are site-resolved vectors, each configuration supplies many independent constraints, which makes the regression well conditioned and sharply reduces the number of DFT calculations needed, especially in large supercells. Applied to the B20-type chiral magnets ${\\rm Mn}_{1-x}{\\rm Fe}_{x}{\\rm Ge}$ and ${\\rm Fe}_{1-y}{\\rm Co}_{y}{\\rm Ge}$, the resulting models nonperturbatively extract the full pairwise exchange tensor (isotropic exchange, anisotropic symmetric exchange, and the Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya interaction) and predict helical spin period via a micromagnetic mapping. The composition trends and the divergence of the period near the chirality sign change are reproduced in line with experiments. Because the SCE framework is systematic, it also enables systematic analysis of interaction order; training on increasingly disordered spin configurations shows that the lowest-order model loses torque accuracy, whereas including higher-order interactions restores predictive power. These advances enable near-DFT-accurate spin models for finite-temperature magnetism and complex textures at modest data cost, while providing a systematic, extensible, and nonperturbative route to quantitative first-principles parameterization and predictive materials design.

Energies beyond the electronic and vibrational (or phononic) main contributions might be relevant when small energy differences are important, such as when predicting stable polymorphs or describing magnetic energy landscape. We clarify the different flavors of BO decoupling and give an exact formulation for the total energy in the basis of BO electronic wavefunctions. Then, we list contributions, beyond the main ones, that appear in a perturbative expansion in powers of $M_0^{-1/4}$, where $M_0$ is a typical nuclear mass, up to sixth order. Some of these might be grouped and denoted the electron-phonon contribution to total energy, $E^{\\textrm{elph}}$, that first appears at fourth order. The electronic inertial mass contributes at sixth order. We clarify that the sum of the Allen-Heine-Cardona zero-point renormalization of eigenvalues over occupied states is not the electron-phonon contribution to the total energy but a part of the phononic contribution. The computation of the lowest-order $E^{\\textrm{elph}}$ is implemented and shown to be small but non-negligible (3.8 meV per atom) in the case of diamond and its hexagonal polymorph.

In Bi2Se3 the spin-orbit lifetime, t_so, is 0.13 ps, which is comparable to the strongest spin-orbit materials. This lifetime drops further to 0.06 ps (0.09 ps) with the addition of p-n (n-p) molecular diodes, at the limit of measurable values. This strengthened spin-orbit interaction occurs even though molecules are made of light elements and increase the mean free path of the charge carriers by almost 50%, indicating changes to the Berry curvature and/or Rashba splitting around the hybridisation points.

Here, I study the altermagnetic ground state of RuO$_2$ on a higher rung of Jacob's ladder of density functional approximations, the meta-GGA level including the kinetic energy density and the density Laplacian. While the workhorse functional of solid-state physics is a generalized gradient approximation (GGA), the modern r$^2$SCAN-L functional has been established as a general-purpose functional which can replace GGA, while systematically improving solid-state properties without introducing spurious errors like erroneous magnetic ground states. Comparison of LSDA+U, GGA+U, and meta-GGA+U results on RuO$_2$ shows systematic enhancement of the exchange interaction, leading to a reduction of the onset value of the Hubbard $U$ parameter at different levels of density functional approximation. However, the magnetic ground state, studied at the experimental lattice constants, remains nonmagnetic with r$^2$SCAN-L. I demonstrate that altermagnetism is easily formed upon lattice expansion, hole doping, and uniaxial strain on the c-axis. The r$^2$SCAN-L calculations set conservative thresholds for distortions and doping levels for the onset of altermagnetism in a parameter-free framework."}

A unification of leading order parameters of 2+1 dimensional $N$ four-component Dirac fermions collects all Lorentz-singlet mass-like fermion bilinears, except the one condensing in the QAH state, into an irreducible representation of the O($M=4N$), and predicts another phase transition in the Gross-Neveu model to occur at a strong (repulsive) coupling. Here, a fermionic auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo algorithm is employed in order to study a lattice realization of the Gross-Neveu field theory in the repulsive regime, where the sign problem is absent. We indeed find the O($4N$) symmetry breaking transition out of Dirac semimetal to occur and to be weakly first-order for $N=2$, relevant to graphene. The size of the discontinuity and the magnitude of the critical coupling, however, both grow with $N$. Adding a finite chemical potential is found to break the symmetry and cause superconductivity. These results are in broad agreement with the predictions of the unified field theory. Our lattice model also displays an interesting exact O($2N$) symmetry, a subgroup of the low-energy O($4N$), and has the ordered ground state with the order parameter that belongs to its $N(2N-1)$-dimensional representation. Other order parameters are also examined, and a certain hierarchy among those that belong to different representations of the exact $O(2N)$ is observed."}

In this work, we show that qualitatively new features arise when an in-plane magnetic field is applied to a 3D Weyl semimetal in the quantum Hall regime. An unexpected Hall quantum oscillation, distinct from the Weyl-orbit oscillation, coexists with the QHE, along with an unquantized two-terminal magnetoresistance. Moreover, unconventional antichiral transmission enables a peculiar disorder-robust negative longitudinal resistance. Quantization tunable by the lead configuration is further found in this transport geometry. A unique type of nonlocal quantum backscattering channels underlies these phenomena.

Contrary to its popular applications in various cross-disciplinary fields, the fundamental study of Persson's theory of contact attracted little attention from the tribology and contact mechanics communities. As far as the authors know, many researchers struggle to understand the derivation of the theory. Few attempts have been made to clarify the oversimplified derivation provided by Persson (Persson, 2001). The present work provides a detailed tutorial on Persson's theory, which does not simply follow the commonly adopted derivation initiated by Persson. A new derivation is given based on stochastic process theory, assuming that the variation of the random contact pressure with respect to scale is a Markov process. We revisit the essential assumptions utilized to derive the diffusion equation, boundary conditions, drift and diffusion coefficients, and closed-form results. This tutorial can serve as a self-consistent introduction for solid mechanicians, tribologists, and postgraduate students who are not familiar with Persson's theory, or who struggle to understand it."}

One material optimization strategy that has still been quite overlooked is interface engineering, specifically, tailoring the electrode/dielectric interface to modulate oxygen exchange. Here, we demonstrate that introducing materials with high ionic mobility can significantly expand the accessible oxygen concentration range within the dielectric layer, significantly broadening the memory window. Using SrTiO3-based memristive stacks, we integrated an ion-conducting SrCoO3 interfacial layer to facilitate oxygen transfer, increasing the number of distinguishable resistance states from 8 to 22. This modification also reduced the SET/RESET voltage by 50% and markedly improved device endurance, albeit with a trade-off of reduced state retention. To assess the practical implications of this trade-off, we trained a two-layer fully connected neural network using the experimental SrTiO3/SrCoO3 memristor characteristics on the MNIST handwritten digit dataset. Networks with hidden-layer sizes between 64 and 256 memristive elements achieved classification errors below 7%. The observed temporal drift means the functional state must be updated at intervals of less than 1 h to maintain reliable operation. Finally, we confirmed the transferability of this interface-engineering approach by applying it to HfOx-based devices, achieving a similarly enhanced memory window."}

Here, we report ambient-pressure superconductivity onset at ~63 K in epitaxial (La,Pr)3Ni2O7 thin films grown under compressive strain on SrLaAlO4 substrates. This Tc leap is enabled by pushing our gigantic-oxidative atomic-layer-by-layer epitaxy (GAE) method into an extreme non-equilibrium growth regime. It leverages powerful in situ oxidation to simultaneously enhance kinetics via higher temperatures and achieve full oxygenation without post-annealing. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction and scanning transmission electron microscopy confirm that this approach yields films of large-scale crystalline purity, overcoming the inherent metastability of the strained superconducting phase. These films exhibit a systematic evolution in their normal-state resistivity-temperature curve: the power-law exponent $α$ evolves from Fermi-liquid-like ($α$ ~2) at lower Tc to strange-metal-like ($α$ ~1) in higher Tc samples, directly linking the enhanced superconductivity to non-Fermi liquid behavior. Mapping the vortex melting phase diagram by the mutual inductance technique further reveals 2D melting limit suppressed to near zero, which demonstrates significantly stronger interlayer coupling than that of cuprates. These results identify the nickelates as an anisotropic-3D high-Tc system exhibiting strange-metal behavior, presenting an alternative framework to the quasi-2D cuprate paradigm."}

To construct the full many-body Hamiltonian, we introduce a linear table formalism, which, to our knowledge, has been rarely used in this context. In ordered rings, the current decreases monotonically with increasing on-site repulsion, while the impact of the extended interaction depends strongly on the filling factor. At low filling, stronger extended interaction suppresses the current, whereas near half-filling, it enhances the current up to a critical ratio, half of the on-site strength, before reducing it. Disorder significantly modifies these behaviors, notably enhancing the current at less than quarter-filling with increasing extended interaction. The localization properties of eigenstates, examined via the inverse participation ratio, further support the crucial roles of filling and the interplay between on-site and extended interactions in governing persistent current."}

The edge spin galvanic current reverses its direction upon a reversal of the non-equilibrium spin direction or the Néel vector. We also propose the pure spin edge photocurrent excited by polarized radiation and formed at the edges of a sample. Its dependence on the radiation polarization and frequency is analyzed. The application of an external magnetic field converts this pure spin photocurrent into an electric current along the edge."}

While Sak's criterion, $σ_* = 2 - η_{\\mathrm{SR}}$, has been widely accepted, recent studies of two-dimensional (2D) models with long-range interactions have challenged it. In this work, we focus on the crossover between LR and SR criticality in several classical 2D statistical models, including the XY, Heisenberg, percolation, and Ising models, whose interactions decay as $1/r^{2+σ}$. Our previous simulations for the XY, Heisenberg, and percolation models consistently indicate a universal boundary at $σ_* = 2$. Here, we complete the picture by performing large-scale Monte Carlo simulations of the 2D LR-Ising model, reaching lattice sizes up to $L = 8192$. By analyzing the Fortuin-Kasteleyn critical polynomial $R_p$, the Binder ratio $Q_m$, and the anomalous dimension $η$, we obtain convergent and self-consistent evidence that the universality class already changes sharply at $σ= 2$. Taken together, these results establish a unified scenario for LR interacting systems: across all studied models, the crossover from LR to SR universality occurs at $σ_* = 2$."}

Starting from this framework, we derive the Ginzburg-Landau free energy and identify, in addition to the conventional pair-breaking term, a coupling between the spin and the spatial variation of the superconducting order parameter. Two distinct effects emerge from this coupling. The first is a magnetoelectric effect, in which a supercurrent (i.e., a phase gradient) induces a spin texture; this contribution is quadratic in the phase gradient. The second effect arises when the magnitude, rather than the phase, of the superconducting order parameter varies in space, likewise leading to a finite magnetization. We show that these two contributions compete in the case of an Abrikosov vortex, where both the amplitude and phase of the order parameter vary spatially. The effect associated with amplitude variations also gives rise to a proximity-induced magnetization (PIM) in hybrid structures composed of a superconductor (S) and an altermagnet (AM). Using quasiclassical theory, we analyze the PIM in diffusive S/AM bilayers and S/AM/S Josephson junctions, and determine the induced magnetization profiles. In Josephson junctions, where both the PIM and the magnetoelectric effect coexist, we further predict the occurrence of $0$-$π$ transitions."}

The composite integrates narrow-bandgap CuO, plasmonic Ag/AgCl, and visible-responsive g-C3N4 into a dual Z-scheme configuration that promotes efficient interfacial charge transfer while preserving strong redox potentials. Diffuse reflectance UV-Vis spectra ascertained the bandgap positions of the composite corresponding to those of its constituents: 2.9 eV (g-C3N4) and 1.42 eV (Ag-doped CuO-AgCl), indicating enhanced absorption and efficient charge carrier generation. BET analysis confirmed the presence of mesoporosity and revealed an effective surface area, ensuring the availability of abundant adsorption and reaction sites. A commercial 11 W UV irradiation was used for the photocatalytic test. Almost complete degradation of MB occurred within 10 min, following pseudo-first-order kinetics with a high apparent rate constant of 0.45/min. The remarkable activity arises from the synergistic interplay of Fenton-like redox cycling and efficient photoinduced charge carrier generation and separation. In addition, it has been demonstrated that intentionally incorporated AgCl plays an active role as a plasmonic-semiconducting interface, strengthening charge separation and catalyst stability under neutral conditions, rather than acting as a passive chloride byproduct. Overall, by linking defect engineering, heterojunction design, and photo-Fenton synergy, this study establishes a low-power, catalytic platform offering a viable pathway towards sustainable dye wastewater remediation."}

These can be captured by adding corrective terms to the semiclassical Boltzmann transport equation. In recent derivations of this type of transport equations that are based on the density matrix formalism, there remain, however, certain omissions. These derivations also rely on a particular type of relaxation time approximation and a band-diagonal form of the interaction self-energies. In this work we derive the interband terms of the electronic Boltzmann transport equation starting from the Keldysh formulation of the quantum kinetic equation and considering the band non-diagonality of the electron-impurity and electron-phonon self-energies. We introduce a minimally modified Kadanoff-Baym Ansatz, and find a quantum-corrected, matrix Boltzmann transport equation that is well beyond the current state of the art theory. We show that the occupations and coherences are interdependent, and that the kinetic corrections due to the included interactions cannot, in general, be ignored. This work clarifies the various approximations that must be introduced in an ab initio derivation of Boltzmann-like equations and finds a new matrix Boltzmann transport equation that is suitable for parameters-free numerical implementations."}

Here we study how inverse turbulent cascades (from small to large scales) transition from weak to strong. We find that while one-loop corrections can be dependent on excitation and dissipation scales, new types of universality appear in strong turbulence. We contrast turbulence of spin waves in ferromagnets with turbulent cascades in the Nonlinear Schrödinger Equation (NSE) and in an MMT-like model in higher dimensions having a multiplicative interaction vertex: vertex renormalization gives rise to dependence on the pumping (UV scale) in the former but not in the latter. As a result of this spectral nonlocality, spin-wave turbulence stops being weak if one is sufficiently far from the pumping scale, even when the interaction of waves with comparable wavenumbers is weak. We paraphrase this as: nonlocality enhances nonlinearity.\n  We then describe strong turbulence in a multi-component version of these models with a large number of components. We argue that strong spin-wave turbulence is similar to turbulence of the focusing NSE, as it realizes a critical-balance state. However, UV nonlocality causes the level of spin-wave turbulence at large scales to decrease with increasing pumping level, culminating in a state that is independent of the level of pumping."}

An isostructural phase transition, marked by an abrupt volume collapse at 13 GPa, is observed exclusively in type-I sodium borosilicide clathrates.

Accepted author manuscript of article published in Carbon 217 (2024) 118605", "summary": "Thermal plasma has emerged as an effective approach for producing carbon nanostructures without the need for specific catalysts nor substrates. While efforts have focused on the effect of process parameters such as reaction pressure, input power or carbon source, the intricate role and relationship with plasma characteristics like density and temperature are often overlooked due to the complexity of the environment. This study addresses this gap by establishing a correlation between process parameters, plasma characteristics, and product morphology, essential for controlling the growth of carbon nanostructures. We explored the impact of carbon precursor type (CH4 and C2H2), hydrogen, pressure, and flow rate on nanostructure formation. Using in situ optical emission spectroscopy (OES), we mapped the distribution of both temperature and dicarbon molecule (C2) density within the plasma jet. We demonstrate that the growth of low-density nanostructures, such as carbon nanohorns (CNHs), is favoured at dilute C2 local densities and high temperatures, while denser nanostructures, such as onion-like polyhedral graphitic nanocapsules (GNCs), are favoured at higher C2 densities and lower temperatures. The carbon density can be controlled by the flow rate and the pressure, which in turn significantly influence the nanostructure morphology, evolving from graphene nanoflakes (GNFs) to GNCs as either parameter increases. Increasing the H/C ratio from 1 to 8 resulted in a morphological transition from CNHs to GNFs. During the synthesis, the plasma jet temperature surpassed 3,000 K, with crystalline growth occurring 50 to 100 mm below the nozzle."}

This material can be considered as a prototypical intelligent matter, capable of encoding, processing, and storing information through its tunable magnetic structure.

Energies beyond the electronic and vibrational (or phononic) main contributions might be relevant when small energy differences are important, such as when predicting stable polymorphs or describing magnetic energy landscape. We clarify the different flavors of BO decoupling and give an exact formulation for the total energy in the basis of BO electronic wavefunctions. Then, we list contributions, beyond the main ones, that appear in a perturbative expansion in powers of $M_0^{-1/4}$, where $M_0$ is a typical nuclear mass, up to sixth order. Some of these might be grouped and denoted the electron-phonon contribution to total energy, $E^{\\textrm{elph}}$, that first appears at fourth order. The electronic inertial mass contributes at sixth order. We clarify that the sum of the Allen-Heine-Cardona zero-point renormalization of eigenvalues over occupied states is not the electron-phonon contribution to the total energy but a part of the phononic contribution. The computation of the lowest-order $E^{\\textrm{elph}}$ is implemented and shown to be small but non-negligible (3.8 meV per atom) in the case of diamond and its hexagonal polymorph.

In Bi2Se3 the spin-orbit lifetime, t_so, is 0.13 ps, which is comparable to the strongest spin-orbit materials. This lifetime drops further to 0.06 ps (0.09 ps) with the addition of p-n (n-p) molecular diodes, at the limit of measurable values. This strengthened spin-orbit interaction occurs even though molecules are made of light elements and increase the mean free path of the charge carriers by almost 50%, indicating changes to the Berry curvature and/or Rashba splitting around the hybridisation points.

The transition unfolds as a 2-fold superstructure due to the emergence of commensurate superlattice reflections and can be progressively suppressed from 1030 K down to 20 K under 14 GPa. No discernible structural distortions associated with DW ordering are detected down to 20 K at ambient pressure.

Here, I study the altermagnetic ground state of RuO$_2$ on a higher rung of Jacob's ladder of density functional approximations, the meta-GGA level including the kinetic energy density and the density Laplacian. While the workhorse functional of solid-state physics is a generalized gradient approximation (GGA), the modern r$^2$SCAN-L functional has been established as a general-purpose functional which can replace GGA, while systematically improving solid-state properties without introducing spurious errors like erroneous magnetic ground states.

Millivolt-scale control of spin polarization in a tunnel junction provides a new route for probing axionic electrodynamics and opens avenues for future STM and spintronics applications."}

The spiral inductor's distributed inter-turn capacitance yields distinct resonant modes with varied impedance-matching conditions. By probing a quantum dot across several modes, we extract tunneling rates over a broad frequency range and identify signatures of nearby charge defects. Using one of the higher-order modes, we demonstrate single-shot spin readout via a radio-frequency single-electron transistor (RF-SET), achieving singlet-triplet readout with an integration time of 8 us and a readout fidelity of 98%. These results establish multimode inductance as a scalable and flexible component for fast spin-qubit readout and device-quality characterization."}

We show that a collection of such ballistic quasiparticles remains stable against sufficiently weak pointlike charge impurities, a feature captured by the vanishing average [$ρ_{a}(0)$] and typical [$ρ_{t}(0)$] DOS at zero energy, computed by employing the kernel polynomial method in sufficiently large $\\{ 10, 3\\}$ hyperbolic lattices (Schläfli symbol) with more than $10^8$ and $10^5$ sites, respectively, with open boundary conditions. However, at moderate disorder the system enters a metallic state via a continuous quantum phase transition where both $ρ_{a}(0)$ and $ρ_{t}(0)$ become finite. With increasing strength of disorder, ultimately an Anderson insulator sets in, where only $ρ_{t}(0) \\to 0$. The resulting phase diagram for dirty Dirac fermions living on a hyperbolic space solely stems from the background negative spatial curvature, as confirmed from the vanishing $ρ_{t}(0)$ for arbitrarily weak disorder on honeycomb lattices, fostering relativistic fermions on a flatland, as the thermodynamic limit is approached."}

Additional tests were performed on an NVIDIA GH200 GPU. In particular MI300A supports unified memory and GH200 supports coherent memory interconnect, simplifying GPU porting. A lightweight C++ lambda-based layer enables CPU, CUDA, and HIP execution without OpenMP/OpenACC preprocessor directives. For diamond (216 atoms) and tungsten (128 atoms) systems, MI300A and GH200 achieve 2.0-2.8 $\\times$ and 2.3-2.4 $\\times$ speedups over a 256-core Xeon node. The compute-bound kernels, which are fast Fourier transforms (FFT), dense matrix-matrix multiplications (GEMM) and eigenvalue solver, show substantial acceleration on both GPUs, indicating that the present GPU-portable approach can benefit a wide range of plasma-fusion simulation codes beyond DFT."}

Here we combine density functional theory (DFT) and physics-grounded predictive artificial intelligence to map the configurational landscape of 13-atom icosahedral nanoclusters X$_{12}$TM, with hosts X = (Ti, Zr, Hf), and Fe and a single transition--metal dopant spanning the 3$d$-5$d$ series. Spin-polarized DFT calculations on 240 bimetallic clusters reveal systematic trends in binding and formation energies, distortion penalties, effective coordination number, d-band centre, and HOMO-LUMO gap that govern the competition between core-shell (in) and surface-segregated (out) arrangements. We then pretrain a transformer architecture on a curated set of 2968 unary clusters from the Quantum Cluster Database and fine-tune it on bimetallic data to predict formation energies and in/out preference, achieving mean absolute errors of about $0.6-0.7$eV and calibrated uncertainty intervals. The resulting model rapidly adapts to an unseen Fe-host domain with only a handful of labelled examples. At the same time, attention patterns and Shapley attributions highlight size mismatch, $d$-electron count, and coordination environment as key descriptors. All data, code, and workflows follow FAIR/TRUE principles, enabling reproducible, interpretable screening of unexplored nanocluster chemistries for catalysis and energy conversion."}
