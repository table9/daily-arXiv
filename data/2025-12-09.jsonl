We dub the hybrid system, and equivalent intrinsically superconducting phases, a \\emph{Chern dartboard superconductor} (CDSC). We show that a CDSC can have nontrivial sBZ topology if it arises from a CDI that has an even number of mirror symmetries $n$. On the other hand, particle-hole symmetry constrains a CDSC that arises from an odd-$n$ CDI to have trivial sBZ topology. However, we can circumvent this constraint for $n=1$ by inducing an FFLO-type pairing or shifting the CDI in momentum space, converting the mirror symmetry to a momentum-space nonsymmorphic mirror symmetry. With a superconducting pairing that preserves the (nonsymmorphic) mirror symmetries, even-$n$ CDIs and the shifted $n=1$ CDI can realize the minimal spinless phase that has a trivial total Chern number and nontrivial reduced Chern numbers. With a pairing that breaks the mirror symmetries, the hybrid system can realize phases that have nontrivial total and reduced Chern numbers, expanding the classification of phases that have sub-Brillouin zone (sBZ) topology. We also predict that some types of $n=2$ CDSCs inherit the quantized crystalline response of the $n=2$ CDI, providing experimentalists with a well-defined way to probe the CDSC. Our work motivates further exploration of sBZ topology, bulk topology, and quantized response."}

A remaining challenge is to elucidate how intrinsic PDW order can emerge robustly in strongly correlated electrons. Here we propose that PDW is prone to form in strongly coupled multiband superconductors simply with interband Cooper pairing between electrons from oppositely dispersing bands. This scenario is heuristically motivated by the observation that uniform interband pairing in such systems would exhibit negative superfluid weight -- a signature of an instability towards pairing modulation, implying that PDW emerges naturally in the true ground state. Using large-scale density-matrix-renormalization-group calculations with finite-size scaling analysis, we demonstrate this PDW mechanism in a minimal model with strong interband attractions. Our simulations reveal power-law superconducting correlations characterized by incommensurate modulations. The exponent $K_{sc}$ of the power-law PDW correlation decreases systematically with increasing ladder width, confirming a genuine long-range PDW order in the 2D limit. Our study therefore demonstrates a promising route to robust PDW states in multiband systems."}

We analyze the PDM in terms of the screw symmetry of the single layer, interpreting it as a hybridized state of two order parameters of opposite glide and screw parity. Discussing the absence of PDM in the bulk where both glide and screw symmetry are present, we argue that the absence of glide symmetry on the surface allows nematic order to selectively stabilize the PDM in thin flakes. Finally, we discuss the symmetry constraints on the microscopic pairing mechanism, pointing out the opposite glide and screw parities of the order parameters favor a site, rather than a bond-based paring mechanism. This suggests that pairing in iron-based superconductors may be local to the iron atoms, possibly driven by Hunds coupling."}

While systematic analysis reveals key design principles, such as field-induced localization for trapping the mobile hole, it becomes computationally intractable for optimization. We show that an autonomous RL agent, benchmarked across five 3D lattices from tetrahedron to FCC, achieves human-competitive accuracy (R^2 > 0.97) and 95.5 percent success on held-out tasks. The agent is 3-4 orders of magnitude more sample-efficient than grid search and outperforms other black-box optimization methods.

At these scales, phonon transport follows the Boltzmann Transport Equation (BTE), which captures non-diffusive (ballistic) effects but is too costly to solve repeatedly in inverse-design loops. Existing surrogate approaches trade speed for accuracy: fast macroscopic solvers can overestimate conductivities by hundreds of percent, while recent data-driven operator learners often require thousands of high-fidelity simulations. This creates a need for a fast, data-efficient surrogate that remains reliable across ballistic and diffusive regimes. We introduce a Physics-Enhanced Deep Surrogate (PEDS) that combines a differentiable Fourier solver with a neural generator and couples it with uncertainty-driven active learning. The Fourier solver acts as a physical inductive bias, while the network learns geometry-dependent corrections and a mixing coefficient that interpolates between macroscopic and nano-scale behavior. PEDS reduces training-data requirements by up to 70% compared with purely data-driven baselines, achieves roughly 5% fractional error with only 300 high-fidelity BTE simulations, and enables efficient design of porous geometries spanning 12-85 W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$ with average design errors of 4%. The learned mixing parameter recovers the ballistic-diffusive transition and improves out of distribution robustness. These results show that embedding simple, differentiable low-fidelity physics can dramatically increase surrogate data-efficiency and interpretability, making repeated PDE-constrained optimization practical for nano-scale thermal-materials design."}

We demonstrate how nonequilibrium exchange interactions produce a nonequilibrium collective quantum geometry distinct from that of its equilibrium ground state.

This phenomenon has been studied theoretically and experimentally in multimode optical fibers and we argue that it is at the origin of emergence of poverty and oligarchic phases for GDP of countries. A similar phenomenon has been discussed recently in the framework of the Wealth Thermalization Hypothesis to explain the high inequality of wealth distribution in human society and companies at Stock Exchange markets.

This design enables explicit treatment of polarization, charge redistribution, and electronic correlation effects that are often underestimated in purely classical scoring schemes, while retaining computational efficiency. Across 23 protein targets and 543 ligands, the method achieves a mean absolute error of about 1.10 kcal/mol with strong rank-order fidelity (Pearson R = 0.75, Spearman rho = 0.76, Kendall tau = 0.57), consistent with the performance of contemporary FEP protocols. Notably, the workflow requires only about 25 minutes per ligand on standard compute resources, resulting in an approximate 20-fold reduction in computational cost relative to alchemical free energy approaches. This level of accuracy and efficiency makes the method well-suited for high-throughput lead optimization and iterative design cycles in pharmaceutical discovery.

Current computational approaches often rely on heuristic approximations of either the electromagnetic (EM) or material component, hindering the exploration of complex light-matter systems. Herein, MaxwellLink -- a modular, open-source Python framework -- is developed for the massively parallel, self-consistent propagation of classical EM fields interacting with a large heterogeneous molecular ensemble. The package utilizes a robust TCP/UNIX socket interface to couple EM solvers with a wide range of external molecular drivers. This decoupled architecture allows users to seamlessly switch between levels of theory of either the EM solver or molecules without modifying the counterpart. Crucially, MaxwellLink supports EM solvers spanning from single-mode cavities to full-feature three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) engines, and molecules described by multilevel open quantum systems, force-field and first-principles molecular dynamics, and nonadiabatic real-time Ehrenfest dynamics. Benefiting from the socket-based design, the EM engine and molecular drivers scale independently across multiple high-performance computing (HPC) nodes, facilitating large-scale simulations previously inaccessible to existing numerical schemes. The versatility and accuracy of this code are demonstrated through applications including superradiance, radiative energy transfer, vibrational strong coupling in Bragg resonators, and plasmonic heating of molecular gases. By providing a unified, extensible engine, MaxwellLink potentially offers a powerful platform for exploring emerging phenomena across the research fronts of spectroscopy, quantum optics, plasmonics, and polaritonics."}

From observations of spontaneous magnetostriction of opposite sign at $T_{\\rm C}$ and $T_{\\rm N}$, along with the TEM evidence for both monoclinic phases in a single thin ($\\approx$ 100 nm) grain, we conclude that the two phases must have a fine-grained ($\\lesssim$ 100 nm) intergrowth character, as might occur from high-temperature spinodal decomposition during the growth process. Calculations of the relaxed lattice structures for the FM and AFM phases with DFT provide a rationalization of the observed spontaneous magnetostrictions.

Practical and robust explicitly-correlated F12 methods require the use of standard or specialized atomic orbital (AO) basis sets that include diffuse AOs, even for neutral species. Although modern reduced-scaling formulations of explicitly-correlated many-body methods have become routinely applicable to molecules with hundreds of atoms, application of F12 methods to large molecular systems can be severely hampered due to the onset of ill-conditioning spurred by the presence of diffuse AOs in the F12-appropriate orbital basis sets. Here we re-examine why diffuse AOs are necessary for application of F12 methods. To help such an investigation, we developed a dual-basis formulation of traditional and F12 coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) methods in which the reference (occupied) and correlating (virtual) orbitals are expanded in separate AO basis sets. Our conclusion is that diffuse AOs are fundamentally important for the traditional (non-F12) description of dynamical correlation; the necessity of diffuse AOs in F12 calculations arises indirectly due to the dramatic reduction of the basis set error by the F12 terms such that the error due to the lack of diffuse AOs becomes comparable to the residual basis set incompleteness. The dual-basis CC methods are suggested as an important candidate formalism for accurate (in particular, F12) reduced-scaling many-body methods in extended systems."}

We further construct a single convolutional classifier of phase states of the ferromagnetic Ising model on square, triangular, honeycomb, and kagome lattices, trained on configurations generated by the Swendsen-Wang cluster algorithm. Computed temperature profiles of the averaged posterior probability of the high-temperature phase form clear S-shaped curves that intersect in the vicinity of the theoretical critical temperatures and allow one to determine the critical temperature for the kagome lattice without additional retraining. It is shown that convolutional models substantially reduce the root-mean-square error (RMSE) compared with fully connected architectures and efficiently capture complex correlations between thermodynamic characteristics and the structure of magnetic correlated systems."}

The domain walls delineate TRSB domains of opposite chirality, consistent with spontaneous breaking of U(1) $\\times$ Z2. Supported by theoretical modelling, we construct a framework in which a hidden interfacial pair-density modulation (PDM) mediates a linear coupling between the surface CDW and interband Josephson currents of TRSB superconductivity. Crucially, the theory shows that realizing this linear coupling requires a controlled global phase difference $δ$ $φ$ = $π$/2 between the PDM and CDW states. Our results uncover a previously overlooked connection between charge ordering and TRSB superconductivity, opening a pathway to explore intertwined quantum orders in iron-based superconductors and other strongly correlated systems."}

Hot-charge emission spectroscopy (HotES) probes ELA by injecting ballistic carriers across a tunneling oxide. Yet, the technique inherently convolutes the molecular response with a strong, energy-dependent tunneling background, complicating the isolation of the true ELA. We introduce synchronous differential HotES (sd-HotES), defined as the ratio of the differential conductance of the hot-charge and tunneling channels of the HotES. Physical modeling and numerical simulations validate that this ratio directly reconstructs the intrinsic molecular charge transmission, enabling the threshold-free and probe-bias-insensitive extraction of ELA. By effectively eliminating the masking tunneling background, sd-HotES substantially boosts detection sensitivity; weak spectral features previously hidden in conventional HotES become clearly resolvable, as demonstrated in lock-in simulations including realistic noise. This study establishes the fundamental operating principles of sd-HotES and highlights it as a powerful, broadly applicable strategy for accessing buried interface properties for the study of molecular and hybrid devices."}

In WSe$_2$ two different twist angles were studied, 3.65° and 5.0°, and two seemingly distinct superconducting phase diagrams were reported, raising the question of whether the superconducting phases in the two devices share a similar origin. Here we address the question by experimentally mapping the evolution of the phase diagram across devices with twist angles spanning the range defined by the initial reports, and comparing the results to twist angle-dependent theory. We find that the superconducting state evolves smoothly with twist angle and at all twist angles is proximal to a Fermi surface reconstruction with, presumably, antiferromagnetic ordering, but is neither necessarily tied to the Van Hove singularity, nor to the half band insulator. Our results connect the previously distinct phase diagrams at 3.65° and 5°, and offer new insight into the origin of the superconductivity in this system and its evolution as the correlation strength increases. More broadly, the smooth phase diagram evolution, repeatability between different devices, and dynamic gate tunability within each device, establish twisted transition metal dichalcogenides as a unique platform for the study of correlated phases as the ratio of interaction strength to bandwidth is varied."}

Launching new attacks on this long-standing problem -- part of Hilbert's sixth problem -- is urgently important, for focus of statistical phenomena is shifting from a fictitious ensemble to an individual member, i.e. a mechanically isolated system. Here we uncover a common probabilistic structure, the concentration of measure, in Hamiltonian dynamics of two families of systems, the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT) model which is finite-dimensional and (almost) ergodic, and the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) which is infinite-dimensional and suffers strong ergodicity breaking. That structure is protected by the geometry of phase space and immune to ergodicity breaking, leading to counterintuitive phenomena. Notably, an isolated FPUT behaves as a thermal ideal gas even for strong modal interaction, with the thermalization time analogous to the Ehrenfest time in quantum chaos, while an isolated GPE system, without any quantum inputs, escapes the celebrated ultraviolet catastrophe through nonlinear wave localization in the mode space, and the Rayleigh-Jeans equilibrium sets in the localization volume.

The interplay between a material's chirality, strong spin-orbit coupling, and charge currents can lead to complex non-reciprocal effects, where electrical resistance depends on the direction of current and magnetic fields. In this study, we systematically investigate the angular dependencies of magnetoresistance in single-crystalline chiral Tellurium (Te). We observe distinct non-reciprocal magnetoresistances for magnetic fields applied along three orthogonal directions: parallel to the current along the chiral axis (z), in the sample plane but perpendicular to the current (y), and out of the sample plane (x). Through detailed analysis of the chirality- and thickness-dependence of the signals, we successfully disentangle multiple coexisting mechanisms. We conclude that the Edelstein effect, arising from the chiral structure's radial spin texture, is responsible for the non-reciprocity along the z-axis. In contrast, the chirality-independent signal along the y-axis is attributed to the Nernst effect, and the non-reciprocity along the x-axis may originate from intrinsic orbital magnetizations. These findings elucidate the complex interplay of spin, orbital, and thermal effects in Te, providing a complete picture of its non-reciprocal transport properties."}

We dub the hybrid system, and equivalent intrinsically superconducting phases, a \\emph{Chern dartboard superconductor} (CDSC). We show that a CDSC can have nontrivial sBZ topology if it arises from a CDI that has an even number of mirror symmetries $n$. On the other hand, particle-hole symmetry constrains a CDSC that arises from an odd-$n$ CDI to have trivial sBZ topology. However, we can circumvent this constraint for $n=1$ by inducing an FFLO-type pairing or shifting the CDI in momentum space, converting the mirror symmetry to a momentum-space nonsymmorphic mirror symmetry. With a superconducting pairing that preserves the (nonsymmorphic) mirror symmetries, even-$n$ CDIs and the shifted $n=1$ CDI can realize the minimal spinless phase that has a trivial total Chern number and nontrivial reduced Chern numbers. With a pairing that breaks the mirror symmetries, the hybrid system can realize phases that have nontrivial total and reduced Chern numbers, expanding the classification of phases that have sub-Brillouin zone (sBZ) topology. We also predict that some types of $n=2$ CDSCs inherit the quantized crystalline response of the $n=2$ CDI, providing experimentalists with a well-defined way to probe the CDSC.

Conventional group-contribution models struggle with isomer discrimination, large molecules, and parameter availability, while purely data-driven graph neural networks (GNNs) demand large datasets and offer limited interpretability. Even when feasible to be applied, purely data-driven models lack thermodynamic consistency in their predictions and are not a reliable solution. This work introduces ExPUFFIN, an extended version of the Path-unifying Feed-Forward Interfaced Network, consisting of a hybrid GNN-based framework that directly predicts temperature-dependent viscosities of pure hydrocarbons from molecular graphs, while enforcing mechanistic inductive biases in the output layer to ensure thermodynamic consistency. Molecular information is given as graph structures, encoded as a graph convolutional network, and mapped to an inductive bias neuron based on two thermophysical correlations:a three-parameter Andrade-type equation and a four-parameter empirical viscosity-temperature relation. The accuracy of these models is compared with a solely data-driven prediction. The Andrade-based ExPUFFIN variant reduces RMSE compared to the purely data-driven baseline of 37 percent and yields smooth, physically consistent interpolation and extrapolation of viscosity-temperature curves, properties that are not observed in purely data-driven models. The empirical ExPUFFIN model provides comparable accuracy while retaining robust trends. Overall, embedding physics-based structure in GNN outputs improves accuracy, robustness, and transferability, enabling reliable viscosity predictions for complex hydrocarbon molecules. The approach is readily extendable to other properties and significantly broader chemical domains."}

Recent theoretical and computational advances include ab initio calculations of polaron spectral functions, wavefunctions, lattice distortions, and transport and optical properties. These developments provide new insight into polaron physics, but they have evolved somewhat independently from the earlier effective Hamiltonian approaches that laid the foundation of the field. This article aims to bridge these complementary perspectives by placing them within a single unified conceptual framework. To this end, we start by reviewing effective Hamiltonians of historical significance in polaron theory, ab initio techniques based on density functional theory, and many-body first-principles approaches to polarons. After this survey, we outline a general field-theoretic framework that bridges between these diverse approaches to polaron physics. For completeness, we also review recent progress in the study of exciton polarons and self-trapped excitons and their relations to polarons.

This introduces a hierarchy of ever larger correlation times and lengths as the extinction threshold is approached. In turn, every species, even those far from extinction, are coupled to these near-critical fields which combine to make fluctuations of population sizes generically scale-free.

We use the 3ω technique applied to quasi-two-dimensional silicon nitride membranes having a metal line heater patterned on the surface to both deliver heat and directly measure the thermal impedance of the membrane at the heating frequency, Z(2ω). We derive an expression for the complex thermal impedance as a function of frequency, approximating the actual rectangular membranes with a one dimensional model. The derivation accounts for potential parasitic heat loss mechanisms including conduction along the heater line, and by the gas load in an imperfect vacuum. Qualitatively, the thermal impedance response resembles a low-pass filter, owing to the combination of the total thermal resistance and total specific heat. Fitting Z(2ω) to measurements across a few decades in frequency, we extract values of the thermal conductivity and specific heat of silicon nitride in agreement with literature values. We also study the dependence on the heating current, and compare to measurements of the thermal conductivity at zero frequency."}

We demonstrate that impurity effects vary significantly depending on both the pairing symmetry and impurity location: interlayer-dominant pairing produces sharp resonance states when impurities are in the inner layer, whereas impurities in the outer layer lead to in-gap enhancements without sharp resonances; in contrast, intralayer-dominant pairing generally yields increased in-gap LDOS without sharp impurity resonances, regardless of impurity position.

Our results reveal a pronounced energetic driving force for aggregation: the formation energy per interstitial decreases systematically from isolated split interstitials to compact multi-interstitial clusters, with the tetra-interstitial platelet emerging as a particularly stable structural motif. Additionally, charge analysis indicates that the predominantly covalent bonding in diamond becomes more polar within the defect centers. Analysis of defect energy levels shows that only the investigated mono-, di-, penta-, and hexa-interstitial complexes introduce in-gap electronic states, whereas the tri- and tetra-interstitial clusters are electronically inert. Vibrational spectroscopies further reveal that self-interstitials generate characteristic signatures. Short carbon-carbon bonds inside the defect cores give rise to high-frequency vibrational modes between 1375 and 1925 cm$^{-1}$, which are strongly IR-active but exhibit weak Raman activity.

It has been proposed that non-equilibrium phases of matter can be defined as equivalence classes of states connected by short-time evolution while maintaining a finite Markov length, a notion called local reversibility. A natural question is whether well-known classical models of non-equilibrium criticality fit within this framework. Here we investigate the Domany--Kinzel model -- which exhibits an active phase and an absorbing phase separated by a 1+1-D directed-percolation transition -- from this information-theoretic perspective. Using tensor network simulations, we provide evidence for local reversibility within the active phase. Notably, the Markov length diverges upon approaching the critical point, unlike classical equilibrium transitions where Markov length is zero due to their Gibbs character. Correspondingly, the conditional mutual information exhibits scaling consistent with directed percolation universality. Further, we analytically study the case of 1+1-D compact directed percolation, where the Markov length diverges throughout the phase diagram due to spontaneous breaking of domain-wall parity symmetry from strong to weak. Nevertheless, the conditional mutual information continues to faithfully detect the corresponding phase transition."}

The polaron is an emergent quasiparticle that arises from the interaction between electrons and phonons in solids, and consists of an electron or a hole accompanied by a distortion of the crystal lattice.

Recent theoretical and computational advances include ab initio calculations of polaron spectral functions, wavefunctions, lattice distortions, and transport and optical properties. These developments provide new insight into polaron physics, but they have evolved somewhat independently from the earlier effective Hamiltonian approaches that laid the foundation of the field. This article aims to bridge these complementary perspectives by placing them within a single unified conceptual framework. To this end, we start by reviewing effective Hamiltonians of historical significance in polaron theory, ab initio techniques based on density functional theory, and many-body first-principles approaches to polarons. After this survey, we outline a general field-theoretic framework that bridges between these diverse approaches to polaron physics.

A remaining challenge is to elucidate how intrinsic PDW order can emerge robustly in strongly correlated electrons. Here we propose that PDW is prone to form in strongly coupled multiband superconductors simply with interband Cooper pairing between electrons from oppositely dispersing bands. This scenario is heuristically motivated by the observation that uniform interband pairing in such systems would exhibit negative superfluid weight -- a signature of an instability towards pairing modulation, implying that PDW emerges naturally in the true ground state. Using large-scale density-matrix-renormalization-group calculations with finite-size scaling analysis, we demonstrate this PDW mechanism in a minimal model with strong interband attractions. Our simulations reveal power-law superconducting correlations characterized by incommensurate modulations. The exponent $K_{sc}$ of the power-law PDW correlation decreases systematically with increasing ladder width, confirming a genuine long-range PDW order in the 2D limit. Our study therefore demonstrates a promising route to robust PDW states in multiband systems."}

In WSe$_2$ two different twist angles were studied, 3.65° and 5.0°, and two seemingly distinct superconducting phase diagrams were reported, raising the question of whether the superconducting phases in the two devices share a similar origin. Here we address the question by experimentally mapping the evolution of the phase diagram across devices with twist angles spanning the range defined by the initial reports, and comparing the results to twist angle-dependent theory. We find that the superconducting state evolves smoothly with twist angle and at all twist angles is proximal to a Fermi surface reconstruction with, presumably, antiferromagnetic ordering, but is neither necessarily tied to the Van Hove singularity, nor to the half band insulator. Our results connect the previously distinct phase diagrams at 3.65° and 5°, and offer new insight into the origin of the superconductivity in this system and its evolution as the correlation strength increases. More broadly, the smooth phase diagram evolution, repeatability between different devices, and dynamic gate tunability within each device, establish twisted transition metal dichalcogenides as a unique platform for the study of correlated phases as the ratio of interaction strength to bandwidth is varied."}

By analytically removing all gauge redundancies of the PEPS manifold and exploiting tensor locality, we obtain a numerically well-conditioned stochastic reconfiguration (SR) equation amenable to robust solution using the efficient Cholesky decomposition, enabling long-time evolution in previously inaccessible regimes. We demonstrate the power and generality of the method through four representative real-time problems in two dimensions: (I) chiral edge propagation in a free-fermion Chern insulator; (II) fractionalized charge transport in a fractional Chern insulator; (III) vison confinement dynamics in the Higgs phase of a Z2 lattice gauge theory; and (IV) superfluidity and critical velocity in interacting bosons. All simulations are performed on 12x12 or 13x13 lattices with evolution times T = 10 to 12 using modest computational resources (1 to 5 days on a single GPU card).

In such a case, it can be interesting to focus only on a few degrees of freedom and to model the rest of the molecule as a finite-dimensional bath.

The EBS method is a system-bath approach based on the coarse-graining of the bath into a reduced set of effective energy states.

Traditional metal conductors face severe limitations at nanoscale due to increased resistivity from surface scattering. In response, this study demonstrates the first wafer-scale realization of an amorphous topological semimetal, tantalum phosphide (TaP), grown directly on amorphous SiO2 substrates (without any seed layers) using low-temperature atomic layer deposition (ALD). The resulting TaP films exhibit unconventional resistivity scaling: decreasing resistivity with decreasing thickness, reaching 227 micro-ohm cm at ~2.3 nm film thickness. This behavior, observed without crystalline order or seed layers, indicates dominant surface conduction and establishes ALD-TaP as a promising candidate for back-end-of-line integration. The films also show excellent conformality, stoichiometry control, and thermal stability up to 600 degree C. A two-channel conduction model confirms surface-dominated transport in ultrathin regimes, further supported by enhanced conductivity in multi-stacked configurations. These findings highlight the potential of amorphous topological semimetals for future high-density, low-power electronic interconnects and expand the applicability of ALD for integrating novel quantum materials at scale."}

The interplay between a material's chirality, strong spin-orbit coupling, and charge currents can lead to complex non-reciprocal effects, where electrical resistance depends on the direction of current and magnetic fields. In this study, we systematically investigate the angular dependencies of magnetoresistance in single-crystalline chiral Tellurium (Te). We observe distinct non-reciprocal magnetoresistances for magnetic fields applied along three orthogonal directions: parallel to the current along the chiral axis (z), in the sample plane but perpendicular to the current (y), and out of the sample plane (x). Through detailed analysis of the chirality- and thickness-dependence of the signals, we successfully disentangle multiple coexisting mechanisms. We conclude that the Edelstein effect, arising from the chiral structure's radial spin texture, is responsible for the non-reciprocity along the z-axis. In contrast, the chirality-independent signal along the y-axis is attributed to the Nernst effect, and the non-reciprocity along the x-axis may originate from intrinsic orbital magnetizations. These findings elucidate the complex interplay of spin, orbital, and thermal effects in Te, providing a complete picture of its non-reciprocal transport properties."}

In the case of weak disorder, the orbital relaxation time is proportional to the momentum scattering time: each scattering event contributes to destroying the orbital moment. In the case of strong disorder, the effect of the crystal field is averaged out, and the orbital relaxation time is inversely proportional to the momentum scattering. We finally find that the dipolar and quadrupolar orbital moments are coupled by the crystal field, resulting in a complex dynamical behavior upon orbital injection."}

Within this framework, explicit expressions are derived for various higher-order response functions of systems that are homogeneous on average, including the first theoretical result for the cubic response at the first harmonic $χ_0^{(1,3)}(\\vec{q})$. Specifically, our framework includes hitherto neglected mode-coupling effects that are important for the non-linear density response even in the presence of a single harmonic perturbation. We compare these predictions for $χ_0^{(1,3)}(\\vec{q})$ to new Kohn-Sham DFT simulations, leading to excellent agreement between theory and numerical results. Exact analytical expressions are also obtained for the long-wavelength limits of the ideal quadratic and cubic response functions. Particular emphasis is placed on the connections between the third- and fourth-order functional derivatives of the non-interacting free-energy functional $F_s[n]$ and the ideal quadratic and cubic response functions of the uniform electron gas, respectively. These relations provide exact constraints that may prove useful for the future construction of improved approximations to $F_s[n]$, in particular for warm dense matter applications at finite temperatures. Here, we use this framework to assess several commonly employed approximations to $F_s[n]$ through orbital-free DFT simulations of the harmonically perturbed ideal electron gas. The results are compared with Kohn-Sham DFT calculations across temperatures ranging from the ground state to the warm dense regime.

The parameters of the electronic system in such a state are studied: electronic heat capacity, thermal conductivity, and electron-phonon coupling parameter with the electronic temperatures up to ~25,000 K. It is also demonstrated that the two refractory alloys do not show signs of nonthermal melting up to the deposited doses of ~10 eV/atom, making them more radiation resistant than the Cantor alloy or stainless steel.

We derive an expression for the complex thermal impedance as a function of frequency, approximating the actual rectangular membranes with a one dimensional model. The derivation accounts for potential parasitic heat loss mechanisms including conduction along the heater line, and by the gas load in an imperfect vacuum. Qualitatively, the thermal impedance response resembles a low-pass filter, owing to the combination of the total thermal resistance and total specific heat. Fitting Z(2ω) to measurements across a few decades in frequency, we extract values of the thermal conductivity and specific heat of silicon nitride in agreement with literature values. We also study the dependence on the heating current, and compare to measurements of the thermal conductivity at zero frequency."}

Analyzing the competition among these condensate order parameters reveals a complex phase structure of coherent states in the ground state. As the mass imbalance is reduced, we observe a transition from a normal disordered electron-hole-photon system to excitoniclike, polariton, and ultimately photoniclike polariton condensation states. The distinct features of these robust condensates can be identified in the momentum distribution of the electron-hole pair amplitude and the photonic density, as well as in the wave-number-resolved photoemission spectra of electrons, holes, and photons. Increasing the excitation density further expands the range of condensation states. Additionally, lowering the mass imbalance leads to the emergence of quantum coherent bound states prior to the formation of robust condensates, which are evidenced by the static and dynamical excitonic and photonic susceptibility functions."}

Machine learning has emerged as a transformative tool for constructing the necessary potential energy surfaces, but applying it to excited states faces a fundamental barrier: the cost of generating high-level quantum chemistry data. We overcome this challenge by developing machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) that achieve multi-state multi-reference perturbation theory accuracy through various techniques, such as transfer, multi-state, and $Δ$-learning. Applied to the methaniminium cation, our highest-fidelity transfer-learning model uncovers its complete photodissociation landscape following S$_2$ photoexcitation. The comprehensive XMCQDPT2/SA(3)-CASSCF(12,12) electronic structure description captures all competing decay channels, including S$_1$ branching into photoisomerization and direct H$_2$-loss pathways. Our results show that the population dynamics generally depends on the MLIP model, correlating with its performance. At the same time, the introduction of MLIP-uncertainty corrections based on the predictions of an ensemble of models brings different approaches into agreement, validating this metric as essential for reliable dynamics. To interpret the population dynamics, we introduce a wavepacket oscillation model - a mechanistically transparent, power-law kinetics framework that extracts state-specific lifetimes directly from first-principles simulations. The model quantitatively reproduces the ultrafast decay, creating a direct link between quantum transition probabilities and classical rate constants. The kinetic fits yield channel-specific lifetimes, supporting the recently discovered photochemical pathway mediated by a novel $σπ^*/S_0$ conical intersection."}

Interfacial hybridization strongly modifies the band structure, leading to anisotropic Rashba-Edelstein and Hall responses. The spin-flip component of the coupling induces an inverse $d$-wave spin texture in the altermagnetic bands, signaling the onset of an altermagnetic topological phase.

Discussing the absence of PDM in the bulk where both glide and screw symmetry are present, we argue that the absence of glide symmetry on the surface allows nematic order to selectively stabilize the PDM in thin flakes. Finally, we discuss the symmetry constraints on the microscopic pairing mechanism, pointing out the opposite glide and screw parities of the order parameters favor a site, rather than a bond-based paring mechanism.

Due to its simultaneously breaking U(1)-gauge and translational symmetries, intriguing vestigial phases which restore only one broken symmetry can emerge at an intermediate temperature regime. Previously, investigations on the vestigial phases of PDW were mainly focused on incommensurate PDW. However, the experimentally observed PDW is usually commensurate, whose vestigial phases have not been systematically investigated. Here we study the vestigial phases of 2D commensurate PDW with $n$-times expanded unit vectors, hosting different numbers of wave vectors. Based on the Ginzburg-Landau theory, we get the low energy effective model Hamiltonian. Subsequent renormalization group (RG) and Monte-Carlo (MC) studies are conducted to obtain the phase diagram and spatial dependent correlation functions. Our RG and MC calculations consistently yield the following result. For $n\\le 4$, besides the charge-4e/2e superconductivity, there exists the translational symmetry broken charge-density-wave (CDW) vetigial phase. Intriguingly, for $n\\ge 5$, the restore of the translational symmetry with increasing temperature is realized through two successive Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions. Such a two-step process leads into two critical vestigial phases, i.e. the critical-PDW and the critical-CDW phases, in which the discrete translational symmetry is quasily broken, leading into a power-law decaying density-density correlation even at 2D.

For classical CG models, the choice of mapping, that is, how atoms are grouped into CG sites, is a major determinant of accuracy and transferability. At the same time, the emergence of machine learning potentials (MLPs) offers new opportunities to build CG models that can in principle learn the true potential of the mean force for any mapping. In this work, we systematically investigate how the choice of mapping influences the representations learned by equivariant MLPs by studying liquid hexane, amino acids, and polyalanine. We find that when the length scales of bonded and nonbonded interactions overlap, unphysical bond permutations can occur. We also demonstrate that correctly encoding species and maintaining stereochemistry are crucial, as neglecting either introduces unphysical symmetries. Our findings provide practical guidance for selecting CG mappings compatible with modern architectures and guide the development of transferable CG models."}

We introduce a geometric map based on the local informational line element, calibrated by the Euclidean benchmark scale $C_{\\mathrm{vac}}$: $ds^{2} = C_{\\mathrm{vac}}/I(x,x+ε)$. We prove that this map yields a smooth Riemannian structure $g_{ij}$ if and only if the short-distance mutual information (MI) follows the anisotropic inverse-quadratic law (local exponent $X_{\\text{loc}}=2$). A key insight is that anisotropy is necessary to activate tensor geometry; isotropic MI forces conformal flatness $g_{ij} \\propto δ_{ij}$, suppressing shear degrees of freedom. We employ a parameterization-invariant unimodular split $g_{ij} = V^{2/D}γ_{ij}$, which rigorously separates local density fluctuations (volume $V$) from directional anisotropy (shape/shear $γ_{ij}$). We introduce ``MI Tomography,'' an operational protocol to reconstruct these geometric components from finite directional measurements. The protocol is validated using the equal-time ground state of an anisotropic 2D quantum harmonic lattice (massless relativistic scalar) on a torus, where the reconstructed shape tensor $γ_{ij}$ quantitatively recovers the physical coupling anisotropy. We work strictly in the local, fixed-coarse-graining $X_{\\text{loc}}=2$ branch; the line element is used solely to extract the local kinematic structure (the local metric tensor), deferring global distance claims."}

By quantum mechanical density functional theory, empowered by interatomic potential models, we efficiently sample the complex configurational landscape and identify both known and previously unreported defect geometries. Our results reveal a pronounced energetic driving force for aggregation: the formation energy per interstitial decreases systematically from isolated split interstitials to compact multi-interstitial clusters, with the tetra-interstitial platelet emerging as a particularly stable structural motif. Additionally, charge analysis indicates that the predominantly covalent bonding in diamond becomes more polar within the defect centers. Analysis of defect energy levels shows that only the investigated mono-, di-, penta-, and hexa-interstitial complexes introduce in-gap electronic states, whereas the tri- and tetra-interstitial clusters are electronically inert. Vibrational spectroscopies further reveal that self-interstitials generate characteristic signatures. Short carbon-carbon bonds inside the defect cores give rise to high-frequency vibrational modes between 1375 and 1925 cm$^{-1}$, which are strongly IR-active but exhibit weak Raman activity. Taken together, these findings provide a coherent picture of the structural, electronic, and vibrational characteristics of carbon self-interstitials and establish a robust framework for their experimental identification."}

We provide an exact solution for these states starting from the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) equations describing quasiparticles in such junctions. We demonstrate that the dispersion of these subgap states depends only on the asymptotic properties of the pair-potential and not on its local spatial variation. Our study reveals the crucial distinction between junctions of non-chiral $p$-wave superconductors and those of $s$-wave or chiral superconductors by analyzing the wavefunction of their subgap bound states. We find a stable topological response leading to the well-known $4π$ periodic Josephson effect protected against weak disorder potential for the non-chiral $p$-wave junctions; no such protection is found for junctions of $s$-wave or chiral superconductors. We supplement our analytic results with numerical computation of the Josephson currents in such junctions using exact numerical Green functions and starting from a lattice model of an itinerant altermagnet which is expected to host triplet $p$-wave superconductivity with equal-spin-pairing. We also discuss the implications of our results for Josephson junctions away from the transparent limit."}

Conical spirals and related structures possess intrinsic in-plane directionalities governed by phase factors $φ_0$, which are often obscured in long spirals due to cylindrical symmetry but become prominent in short spirals or thin films. Using micromagnetic simulations, we systematically studied magnetic textures at ferromagnetic-conical interfaces (FCI), including 1D and 2D FCIs with various shapes. Surface spirals (SS) emerge adjacent to these FCIs, closely linked to the cone's in-plane reorientation. In 1D FCIs, reorientation controls the presence, shape, and topological charge of the SS, with a discontinuity point observed where spirals with opposite charges form on opposite sides. In 2D FCIs, eyebrow-like SS are evident. The reorientation angle between top and bottom SS is controlled by the film thickness, similar to stacked spirals reported previously. We further demonstrate that SSs form at the facets of skyrmion clusters within the conical phase, as confirmed by both simulations and Lorentz transmission electron microscopy observations in Co$_8$Zn$_{10}$Mn$_2$ thin films. The experiments specifically reveal two distinct formation pathways: thermally activated co-growth and field-driven transformation from residual helices.

The polaron is an emergent quasiparticle that arises from the interaction between electrons and phonons in solids, and consists of an electron or a hole accompanied by a distortion of the crystal lattice. Recent advances in experiments, theory, and computation have made it possible to investigate these quasiparticles with unprecedented detail, reigniting the interest in this classic problem of condensed matter physics. Recent theoretical and computational advances include ab initio calculations of polaron spectral functions, wavefunctions, lattice distortions, and transport and optical properties. These developments provide new insight into polaron physics, but they have evolved somewhat independently from the earlier effective Hamiltonian approaches that laid the foundation of the field. This article aims to bridge these complementary perspectives by placing them within a single unified conceptual framework. To this end, we start by reviewing effective Hamiltonians of historical significance in polaron theory, ab initio techniques based on density functional theory, and many-body first-principles approaches to polarons. After this survey, we outline a general field-theoretic framework that bridges between these diverse approaches to polaron physics. For completeness, we also review recent progress in the study of exciton polarons and self-trapped excitons and their relations to polarons. Beyond the methodology, we discuss recent applications to several classes of materials that attracted attention in the context of polaron physics."}

However, the fundamental mechanisms governing carrier transfer across distinct phases remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate effective electron-hole separation in fluorinated multilayered quasi-2D perovskite films nominally prepared for three layers, using femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. The films are revealed to comprise a heterogeneous phase distribution (with 1, 2, 3 layers and bulk) naturally stacked along the growth direction. Our ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements, show the type-two band alignment between the small-n (layer number) phases and the bulk. This alignment drives charge separation via both direct and sequential carrier transfer mechanisms, whereby electrons preferentially migrate into the bulk domains while holes accumulate in the small-n layers, extending even to single layer phase-a process only rarely observed in previous studies. The nearly symmetric transfer times of electrons and holes yield an efficient and balanced spatial separation of carriers. Global target analysis employing a carrier transfer model quantitatively reproduces the spectral evolution, providing a rigorous validation of the mechanism. Nonetheless, we found photocurrent enhancement in the diode devices of this quasi-2D perovskite as a consequence of the efficient transfer of photocarriers in the opposite directions. This work delivers a comprehensive picture of interphase charge transfer in fluorinated quasi-2D perovskites and highlights strategies to engineer directional separation pathways for high-performance photovoltaic, optoelectronic, and quantum devices."}

Following a thermal quench, CDW domains grow through the diffusion and annihilation of kinks -- topological defects separating the two symmetry-related CDW orders. While standard diffusive dynamics predicts domain sizes scaling as the square root of time, our large-scale simulations reveal a slower power-law growth with a temperature-dependent exponent. We trace this anomalous behavior to a cooperative kink hopping arising from Fermi-Dirac statistics of electrons and quasi-conservation of electron numbers. The correlated-hopping of kinks in turn gives rise to an effective diffusion coefficient that depends on the kink density. These results uncover a new mechanism for slow coarsening and carry implications for phase-ordering in the full Holstein model and related electron-phonon systems."}

This setting encompasses driven soft matter as well as biomolecular, biochemical, and biophysical systems. Despite its central role, direct measurements of entropy production remain challenging - especially in small systems dominated by fluctuations. The main difficulty arises because not all degrees of freedom contributing to entropy production are experimentally accessible. A key question, therefore, is how to infer entropy production from coarse-grained observations, such as time series of experimentally measurable variables. Over the past decade, stochastic thermodynamics has provided several inequalities that yield model-free lower bounds on entropy production from such coarse-grained data. The major approaches rely on observations of coarse-grained states, fluctuating currents or ticks, correlation functions of coarse-grained observables, and waiting-time distributions between so-called Markovian events, which correspond to transitions between mesoscopic states. Here, we systematically review these techniques valid under the sole assumption of a Markovian, i.e., memoryless, dynamics on an underlying, not necessarily observable, network of states or following a possibly high-dimensional Langevin equation. We discuss in detail the large class of non-equilibrium steady states and highlight extensions of these methods to time-dependent and relaxing systems. While our focus is on mean entropy production, we also summarize recent progress in quantifying entropy production along individual coarse-grained trajectories."}

While this growth method ensures high productivity and low operation costs compared to other methods, its most significant disadvantage lies in the presence of carbon atoms in the precursors, which are unavoidably incorporated into the epitaxial layers and hamper the performance of most types of fabricated devices. Carbon-free precursors for the CVD process could enhance the performance of high-frequency and high-power nitride-based devices while maintaining growth capability in industrial equipment. In this work, we implement gallium- and aluminum-brominated precursors, which contain no carbon atoms, to grow GaN and AlN layers in an industrial CVD system.

In this work, spectroscopic ellipsometry is used to determine the uniaxial dielectric response of bulk $1T$-TaS$_2$ from room temperature down to the commensurate insulating state. The room-temperature data reveal natural type-II hyperbolic behavior in the visible range, with negative in-plane and positive out-of-plane permittivity. Temperature-dependent ellipsometry combined with anisotropic Bruggeman effective medium analysis shows that the metallic domains responsible for percolation evolve from disc-like to needle-like shapes, and that, upon heating, an additional intermediate phase emerges.

Current computational approaches often rely on heuristic approximations of either the electromagnetic (EM) or material component, hindering the exploration of complex light-matter systems. Herein, MaxwellLink -- a modular, open-source Python framework -- is developed for the massively parallel, self-consistent propagation of classical EM fields interacting with a large heterogeneous molecular ensemble. The package utilizes a robust TCP/UNIX socket interface to couple EM solvers with a wide range of external molecular drivers. This decoupled architecture allows users to seamlessly switch between levels of theory of either the EM solver or molecules without modifying the counterpart. Crucially, MaxwellLink supports EM solvers spanning from single-mode cavities to full-feature three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) engines, and molecules described by multilevel open quantum systems, force-field and first-principles molecular dynamics, and nonadiabatic real-time Ehrenfest dynamics. Benefiting from the socket-based design, the EM engine and molecular drivers scale independently across multiple high-performance computing (HPC) nodes, facilitating large-scale simulations previously inaccessible to existing numerical schemes. The versatility and accuracy of this code are demonstrated through applications including superradiance, radiative energy transfer, vibrational strong coupling in Bragg resonators, and plasmonic heating of molecular gases. By providing a unified, extensible engine, MaxwellLink potentially offers a powerful platform for exploring emerging phenomena across the research fronts of spectroscopy, quantum optics, plasmonics, and polaritonics."}

Due to its simultaneously breaking U(1)-gauge and translational symmetries, intriguing vestigial phases which restore only one broken symmetry can emerge at an intermediate temperature regime. Previously, investigations on the vestigial phases of PDW were mainly focused on incommensurate PDW. However, the experimentally observed PDW is usually commensurate, whose vestigial phases have not been systematically investigated. Here we study the vestigial phases of 2D commensurate PDW with $n$-times expanded unit vectors, hosting different numbers of wave vectors. Based on the Ginzburg-Landau theory, we get the low energy effective model Hamiltonian. Subsequent renormalization group (RG) and Monte-Carlo (MC) studies are conducted to obtain the phase diagram and spatial dependent correlation functions. Our RG and MC calculations consistently yield the following result. For $n\\le 4$, besides the charge-4e/2e superconductivity, there exists the translational symmetry broken charge-density-wave (CDW) vetigial phase. Intriguingly, for $n\\ge 5$, the restore of the translational symmetry with increasing temperature is realized through two successive Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions. Such a two-step process leads into two critical vestigial phases, i.e. the critical-PDW and the critical-CDW phases, in which the discrete translational symmetry is quasily broken, leading into a power-law decaying density-density correlation even at 2D.

By analytically removing all gauge redundancies of the PEPS manifold and exploiting tensor locality, we obtain a numerically well-conditioned stochastic reconfiguration (SR) equation amenable to robust solution using the efficient Cholesky decomposition, enabling long-time evolution in previously inaccessible regimes. We demonstrate the power and generality of the method through four representative real-time problems in two dimensions: (I) chiral edge propagation in a free-fermion Chern insulator; (II) fractionalized charge transport in a fractional Chern insulator; (III) vison confinement dynamics in the Higgs phase of a Z2 lattice gauge theory; and (IV) superfluidity and critical velocity in interacting bosons. All simulations are performed on 12x12 or 13x13 lattices with evolution times T = 10 to 12 using modest computational resources (1 to 5 days on a single GPU card). Where exact benchmarks exist (case I), PEPS-tVMC matches free-fermion dynamics with high accuracy up to T = 12.

This common origin implies that extreme crystal distortion, by narrowing bandwidths, enhancing correlations and reshaping the symmetries of altermagnetic spin splittings, could unify flat-band and altermagnetic physics in a single material; in practice, however, achieving such large distortions in a crystalline altermagnet is a formidable challenge. Here we combine a dedicated strain device with a tailored single-crystal mounting scheme to impose a highly tensile strain gradient in bulk CrSb, a prototypical altermagnet, creating a near-surface layer in which the in-plane lattice is strongly distorted relative to the weakly strained bulk, while the average bulk distortion remains small. Angle-resolved photoemission reveals a reversible regime at moderate strain, where a deeper flat-band feature, attributed to a strain-gradient-driven suppression of Cr-Sb hybridization, coexists with a correlation-enhanced Cr 3d flat band, and an irreversible regime at larger strain where partial bond decoupling drives a predominantly insulating spectral response. Density-functional calculations show that an orbital-selective altermagnetic spin texture persists across this correlated regime despite strong bandwidth renormalisation. These results define a strain-symmetry-correlation map for CrSb and establish extreme tensile strain as a route to co-engineer flat-band tendencies and spin-textured, zero-net-moment correlated states in altermagnets, pointing toward strain-adaptive, spin-selective Mott filtering and related device concepts."}

Interestingly, the highly disordered nature of this system facilitates remarkably efficient ultrafast funneling of photoexcited spin-polarized excitons from the pure 2D phase (n=1) to higher-n phases at room temperature. We demonstrate that significant polaron formation due to the inherent soft crystal lattice and higher exciton-phonon interaction is responsible for the observed spin funneling effect in mixed-phase 2D RP perovskites. Polaron act as a protective mechanism for spin-polarized excitons, preserving their spin information through the screening of omnipresent phonon-induced momentum scattering.

While nonlinear responses governed by bulk quantum geometry and band topology are well understood, the role of boundary modes (e.g., edge, surface, and hinge states) in nonlinear transport of topological materials remains largely unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate boundary-bulk interplay in nonlinear transport, including second-harmonic Hall and nonreciprocal longitudinal responses, in molecular beam epitaxy-grown magnetic topological insulator heterostructures. We find that the nonlinear transport is maximized when the sample is tuned slightly away from the well-quantized states, including the quantum anomalous Hall and axion insulator states. The sign and amplitude of the nonlinear transport depend on electrode configuration, magnetic order, and carrier type, establishing boundary mode transport as the dominant contributor. These findings, supported by symmetry analysis and nonlinear Landauer-Büttiker formalism, demonstrate that nonlinear transport in topological materials is governed by the interplay between boundary and bulk states. We further derive a universal relation between different lead voltages from electrode geometry symmetry, which allows us to distinguish nonlinear boundary transport from bulk contributions. Our work highlights the critical role of electrodes in nonlinear transport, which is absent in nonlinear optics, and establishes boundary modes as a key origin of the giant nonlinear response in nearly bulk-insulating topological materials. This insight opens new opportunities for engineering nonlinear transport through boundary-bulk interplay in future device applications of topological materials."}

In WSe$_2$ two different twist angles were studied, 3.65° and 5.0°, and two seemingly distinct superconducting phase diagrams were reported, raising the question of whether the superconducting phases in the two devices share a similar origin. Here we address the question by experimentally mapping the evolution of the phase diagram across devices with twist angles spanning the range defined by the initial reports, and comparing the results to twist angle-dependent theory. We find that the superconducting state evolves smoothly with twist angle and at all twist angles is proximal to a Fermi surface reconstruction with, presumably, antiferromagnetic ordering, but is neither necessarily tied to the Van Hove singularity, nor to the half band insulator. Our results connect the previously distinct phase diagrams at 3.65° and 5°, and offer new insight into the origin of the superconductivity in this system and its evolution as the correlation strength increases. More broadly, the smooth phase diagram evolution, repeatability between different devices, and dynamic gate tunability within each device, establish twisted transition metal dichalcogenides as a unique platform for the study of correlated phases as the ratio of interaction strength to bandwidth is varied."}

A remaining challenge is to elucidate how intrinsic PDW order can emerge robustly in strongly correlated electrons. Here we propose that PDW is prone to form in strongly coupled multiband superconductors simply with interband Cooper pairing between electrons from oppositely dispersing bands. This scenario is heuristically motivated by the observation that uniform interband pairing in such systems would exhibit negative superfluid weight -- a signature of an instability towards pairing modulation, implying that PDW emerges naturally in the true ground state. Using large-scale density-matrix-renormalization-group calculations with finite-size scaling analysis, we demonstrate this PDW mechanism in a minimal model with strong interband attractions. Our simulations reveal power-law superconducting correlations characterized by incommensurate modulations. The exponent $K_{sc}$ of the power-law PDW correlation decreases systematically with increasing ladder width, confirming a genuine long-range PDW order in the 2D limit. Our study therefore demonstrates a promising route to robust PDW states in multiband systems."}

This influence is particularly pronounced in quasi-one-dimensional nanotubes, where the high surface-to-volume ratio makes the wall the dominant source of electrostatic screening. For instance, ideal metallic tubes suppress long-range Coulomb interactions between ions exponentially. Yet, there exists no generic framework for evaluating electrostatic interactions in tubular confinement. Here, we introduce tubular response functions - a generalisation of surface response functions that captures how nanotubes with arbitrary electronic properties screen Coulomb interactions. Using this framework, we evaluate the interaction potential of ions confined in a metallic carbon nanotube, treating its electronic properties exactly within a Luttinger liquid model. We demonstrate that the long-range exponential screening characteristic of ideal metals persists in realistic metallic nanotubes, regardless of their electron density. We trace the origin of this perfect screening property to the quantum confinement of electrons along the tube circumference. Our framework opens the way for quantitative descriptions of ionic correlations and charge storage in nanotube-based electrodes, and can be further extended to address confined ion dynamics."}

Specifically, our framework includes hitherto neglected mode-coupling effects that are important for the non-linear density response even in the presence of a single harmonic perturbation. We compare these predictions for $χ_0^{(1,3)}(\\vec{q})$ to new Kohn-Sham DFT simulations, leading to excellent agreement between theory and numerical results. Exact analytical expressions are also obtained for the long-wavelength limits of the ideal quadratic and cubic response functions. Particular emphasis is placed on the connections between the third- and fourth-order functional derivatives of the non-interacting free-energy functional $F_s[n]$ and the ideal quadratic and cubic response functions of the uniform electron gas, respectively. These relations provide exact constraints that may prove useful for the future construction of improved approximations to $F_s[n]$, in particular for warm dense matter applications at finite temperatures. Here, we use this framework to assess several commonly employed approximations to $F_s[n]$ through orbital-free DFT simulations of the harmonically perturbed ideal electron gas. The results are compared with Kohn-Sham DFT calculations across temperatures ranging from the ground state to the warm dense regime.

Here, we report robust experimental evidence for the strong localization of orbital polarization. We demonstrate that neither the bulk nor the interface of the Al contributes a detectable orbital torque on adjacent magnetic layer with strong bulk and interfacial spin-orbit coupling necessary for potential orbital-spin conversion. These results have clarified that orbital polarization undergoes much faster relaxation than spin polarization and hardly participates in non-local accumulation, transport, or torque generation.

The resulting TaP films exhibit unconventional resistivity scaling: decreasing resistivity with decreasing thickness, reaching 227 micro-ohm cm at ~2.3 nm film thickness. This behavior, observed without crystalline order or seed layers, indicates dominant surface conduction and establishes ALD-TaP as a promising candidate for back-end-of-line integration. The films also show excellent conformality, stoichiometry control, and thermal stability up to 600 degree C. A two-channel conduction model confirms surface-dominated transport in ultrathin regimes, further supported by enhanced conductivity in multi-stacked configurations.

In this review, we provide a historical perspective of the development of LEDs based on halide perovskite nanocrystals and then present a comprehensive survey of current strategies to high-efficiency lead-based perovskite nanocrystals LEDs, including synthesis optimization, ion doping/alloying and shell coating. We then review the basic characteristics and emission mechanisms of lead-free perovskite and perovskite-related nanocrystals emitters in environmentally friendly LEDs, from the standpoint of different emission colors. Finally, we cover the progress in LED applications and provide an outlook of the opportunities and challenges for future developments in this field."}

However, higher-order features, located at elevated energies with narrow bandwidths, typically require high carrier densities and remain difficult to resolve using conventional electrical transport due to limited sensitivity and strong background conductivity. Here, we utilize acoustoelectric (AE) transport to probe high-order fractal states and the Hofstadter spectrum in graphene/hBN moiré superlattices. Surface acoustic waves on a ferroelectric LiNbO$_3$ substrate generate an AE voltage proportional to the derivative of electrical conductivity, significantly enhancing sensitivity to weak spectral features. Combined with substrate-induced high electron doping, this technique resolves fractal Brown-Zak oscillations up to the fifth-order and provides the first AE observation of the Hofstadter butterfly, revealing high-order fractal magnetic Bloch states and symmetry-broken Landau levels over a wide carrier density range. Our results establish AE transport as a powerful derivative-sensitive probe for emergent fractal quantum states in moiré-engineered 2D systems."}

A striking and unresolved puzzle from these studies is the unexpected opposite sign of the observed Chern numbers between the two systems. Recent theory has proposed a twist-angle-dependent Chern number sign reversal in both twisted MoTe2 and WSe2, offering a potential explanation for the disparate experimental observations6. However, a direct experimental verification of the twist-angle-dependent Chern number sign reversal in a specific twisted TMD homobilayer is still elusive. Here, we report the first experimental demonstration that the Chern numbers of the moire frontier bands undergo sign reversal at a critical twist angle 1.42{deg} in twisted WSe2 bilayers (tWSe2). Using scanning tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopy, we direct measure layer-pseudospin skyrmion textures of tWSe2 and our results reveal that tWSe2 in the vicinity of the 1.42{deg} exhibits a twist-angle-dependent layer-pseudospin polarization, an effect that serves as the fundamental origin of the observed Chern number sigh reversal6-12."}

Here, using circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) and polarization dependent pump-probe spectroscopy, we found that spin polarization is present across all phases of our two-dimensional (2D) Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) mixed-phase perovskites, (C6H7SNH3)2 (CH3NH3)n-1PbnI3n+1 (n=1-4), irrespective of the number of inorganic layers. The origin of these spin polarized bands is attributed to the Rashba effect. Interestingly, the highly disordered nature of this system facilitates remarkably efficient ultrafast funneling of photoexcited spin-polarized excitons from the pure 2D phase (n=1) to higher-n phases at room temperature. We demonstrate that significant polaron formation due to the inherent soft crystal lattice and higher exciton-phonon interaction is responsible for the observed spin funneling effect in mixed-phase 2D RP perovskites. Polaron act as a protective mechanism for spin-polarized excitons, preserving their spin information through the screening of omnipresent phonon-induced momentum scattering. These findings not only offer valuable guidance for the design of 2D RP perovskites with pronounced Rashba effects but also unveil a compelling class of solution-processed perovskites capable of efficient spin-preserving energy transport at room temperature."}

It has been proposed that non-equilibrium phases of matter can be defined as equivalence classes of states connected by short-time evolution while maintaining a finite Markov length, a notion called local reversibility. A natural question is whether well-known classical models of non-equilibrium criticality fit within this framework. Here we investigate the Domany--Kinzel model -- which exhibits an active phase and an absorbing phase separated by a 1+1-D directed-percolation transition -- from this information-theoretic perspective. Using tensor network simulations, we provide evidence for local reversibility within the active phase. Notably, the Markov length diverges upon approaching the critical point, unlike classical equilibrium transitions where Markov length is zero due to their Gibbs character. Correspondingly, the conditional mutual information exhibits scaling consistent with directed percolation universality. Further, we analytically study the case of 1+1-D compact directed percolation, where the Markov length diverges throughout the phase diagram due to spontaneous breaking of domain-wall parity symmetry from strong to weak. Nevertheless, the conditional mutual information continues to faithfully detect the corresponding phase transition."}

The insertion of an unusually large A-cation (274 pm in diameter) in the perovskite structure, hitherto considered unlikely due to the unfavorable Goldschmidt tolerance factor, results in a significantly larger lattice parameter compared to the Cs-, methylammonium- and formamidinium-based lead halide perovskite homologues. As a consequence, EAPbI3 nanocrystals are highly unstable, evolving to a non-perovskite delta-EAPbI3 polymorph within one day. Also, EAPbI3 nanocrystals are very sensitive to electron irradiation and quickly degrade to PbI2 upon exposure to the electron beam, following a mechanism similar to that of other hybrid lead iodide perovskites (although degradation can be reduced by partially replacing the EA+ ions with Cs+ ions). Interestingly, in some cases during this degradation the formation of an epitaxial interface between (EAxCs1-x)PbI3 and PbI2 is observed. The photoluminescence emission of the EAPbI3 perovskite nanocrystals, albeit being characterized by a low quantum yield (around 1%), can be tuned in the 664-690 nm range by regulating their size during the synthesis. The emission efficiency can be improved upon partial alloying at the A site with Cs+ or formamidinium cations. Furthermore, the morphology of the EAPbI3 nanocrystals can be chosen to be either nanocube or nanoplatelet, depending on the synthesis conditions."}

Using an effective model, we analyze in detail the origins of anomalous oscillations in both clean and disordered cases. Based on these origins, we explain why SOC suppresses or enhances the anomalous oscillations in different cases, thereby extending the understanding of the conventional theory. Moreover, in the disordered case, SOC can induce a phase shift of the anomalous oscillations. We further identify a parameter window where the anomalous oscillations are significantly enhanced in the presence of both disorder and SOC. These results provide a theoretical basis for understanding the role of SOC in anomalous quantum oscillations."}

We demonstrate that the dispersion of these subgap states depends only on the asymptotic properties of the pair-potential and not on its local spatial variation. Our study reveals the crucial distinction between junctions of non-chiral $p$-wave superconductors and those of $s$-wave or chiral superconductors by analyzing the wavefunction of their subgap bound states. We find a stable topological response leading to the well-known $4π$ periodic Josephson effect protected against weak disorder potential for the non-chiral $p$-wave junctions; no such protection is found for junctions of $s$-wave or chiral superconductors. We supplement our analytic results with numerical computation of the Josephson currents in such junctions using exact numerical Green functions and starting from a lattice model of an itinerant altermagnet which is expected to host triplet $p$-wave superconductivity with equal-spin-pairing.

This quasi-classical formulation enables us to isolate the role of electrons in coarsening dynamics. Following a thermal quench, CDW domains grow through the diffusion and annihilation of kinks -- topological defects separating the two symmetry-related CDW orders. While standard diffusive dynamics predicts domain sizes scaling as the square root of time, our large-scale simulations reveal a slower power-law growth with a temperature-dependent exponent. We trace this anomalous behavior to a cooperative kink hopping arising from Fermi-Dirac statistics of electrons and quasi-conservation of electron numbers. The correlated-hopping of kinks in turn gives rise to an effective diffusion coefficient that depends on the kink density. These results uncover a new mechanism for slow coarsening and carry implications for phase-ordering in the full Holstein model and related electron-phonon systems."}

Here we demonstrate 175-fold spin-wave amplitude amplification in ultrathin films with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy at temporal interfaces associated with a field-driven transition between a uniform in-plane state and a stripe-domain state, exceeding existing parametric and spin-torque schemes (10-50-fold) without a continuous power supply. When the in-plane bias field is swept through a critical value in the presence of finite Gilbert damping, the spin-wave dispersion undergoes dramatic softening, and the eigenfrequency crosses zero and acquires a positive imaginary part that drives exponential growth. We identify this as a damping-induced instability operating near an exceptional point-a non-Hermitian degeneracy where, counterintuitively, increased Gilbert damping enhances amplification. This mechanism exploits ingredients specific to these magnetic films: the interplay of Gilbert damping, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya-interaction-induced nonreciprocity, and field-driven phase transitions-a combination that, to our knowledge, has no direct counterpart in photonic or acoustic time-varying platforms. Our analytical framework provides explicit design rules, while micromagnetic simulations capture the full nonlinear dynamics, including stripe-domain formation.

In the presence of short-range impurities and in the absence of spin-orbit coupling, the orbital relaxation emerges from the competition between momentum scattering and the effect of the crystal field. In the case of weak disorder, the orbital relaxation time is proportional to the momentum scattering time: each scattering event contributes to destroying the orbital moment. In the case of strong disorder, the effect of the crystal field is averaged out, and the orbital relaxation time is inversely proportional to the momentum scattering. We finally find that the dipolar and quadrupolar orbital moments are coupled by the crystal field, resulting in a complex dynamical behavior upon orbital injection."}

While these phenomena have been explored in various systems, acoustic realizations remain challenging. Here, we report that acoustic meron topological textures were successfully realized using designed Archimedeanlike square spiral metastructures via the excitation of spoof surface acoustic waves (SSAWs). By applying mirror-symmetric combinatorial operations to the unit structures, we further construct composite chiral metastructures that enable both one-dimensional and two-dimensional stable transport of acoustic bimerons. It is further revealed that bimeron transport originates from the locked opposite phase differences of SSAWs, induced by the handedness of the cavity resonant modes. The intrinsic robustness of the meron textures against structural defects is confirmed through the calculation of their topological charge. Our findings establish stable acoustic bimeron transport as a topologically resilient foundation for future acoustic information processing and storage technologies."}

In the NDP data, no distinct interphase is observed at the interface. NR shows a difference between electrodeposited, and vapor deposited LiPON -Li interfaces but finds both are gradient interphases that are less than 30 nm thick. Additional simulations of the LiPON-Li2O-Li system demonstrate that NDP has an excellent resolution in the 50 nm-1 mm regime while NR has an ideal resolution from 0.1 - 200 nm with different sample requirements.

Upon hole doping, these NRs develop itinerant magnetization across a broad range of carrier densities and display half-metallic behavior. The spin-polarization energies ($E_{sp}$) of these NRs enhance remarkably relative to their 2D counterparts, with maximum increase being in the case of TiO$_{2}$ from 31 to 103 meV/carrier.

Here, we reveal the spontaneous formation of hitherto unreported ultra-thin GeSn fins with sub-30 nm thickness during vapor-phase growth on Ge nanowire substrates. A transition from the typical conformal GeSn shell to distinct fin-like structures occurs along the nanowire growth axis and is accompanied by ordered twin defects extending longitudinally and laterally, inducing a transition from diamond to hexagonal-like crystal structure. The fins exhibit uniform Sn incorporation of approximately 16 at.% throughout their volume, indicating high compositional homogeneity. These findings uncover an anisotropic growth regime in metastable GeSn alloys, enriching the fundamental understanding of nanoscale epitaxy."}

In this work, we investigate Cs(n+1)PbnBr3n+1 nanoplatelets (n = 2-5) experimentally and theoretically and show that the interplay between dielectric confinement and anisotropic screening critically determines both their electronic structure and excitonic landscape. To incorporate the dielectric screening effects, the Coulomb kernel in the Fock exchange term is refined using a model dielectric function together with a model Bethe-Salpeter Equation approach. The exciton binding energies show a monotonic decrease from 0.26 eV to 0.21 eV from n = 2 to 5, with 20 meV decrease per layer up to n = 4, and thereafter less change. The relatively small change per layer is a consequence of the strong spatial localization of excitons. By analyzing directionally resolved dielectric tensors, we demonstrate that the in-plane dielectric constant predominantly dictates optical transitions and is close to converging to the bulk value already at n = 5, while the out-of-plane dielectric response reflects the confined nature of excitonic wave functions as expected. Our calculated absorption spectra capture experimental results within 0.02 eV throughout the confinement regime (n = 2-5). The effects of lattice dynamics on the dimensionally dependent dielectric response and subsequent exciton screening occurring on longer time-scales than the optical response are also analyzed, important for analysis and interpretation of exciton lifetime, diffusion, and band alignments. The results establish a clear correlation between dielectric anisotropy, electronic structure, and exciton binding energy at different timescales in layered perovskites, providing essential insight for the design of 2D optoelectronic materials and devices."}

Using matrix product state (MPS) representation, we trace the origin of these spurious signals in trivial SPT phases to the magnitude-degeneracy of the transfer matrix. We systematically classify three distinct mechanisms responsible for such degeneracy, each substantiated by concrete examples: (1) the presence of high-dimensional irreducible representations in the entanglement space; (2) a phase mismatch in symmetry representations between the target and reference states; and (3) long-range order arising from symmetry breaking.

In 2D FCIs, eyebrow-like SS are evident. The reorientation angle between top and bottom SS is controlled by the film thickness, similar to stacked spirals reported previously. We further demonstrate that SSs form at the facets of skyrmion clusters within the conical phase, as confirmed by both simulations and Lorentz transmission electron microscopy observations in Co$_8$Zn$_{10}$Mn$_2$ thin films. The experiments specifically reveal two distinct formation pathways: thermally activated co-growth and field-driven transformation from residual helices. These findings establish $φ_0$ as a fundamental control parameter for magnetic states, enabling promising spintronic functionalities such as multi-state memory through SS polymorphism and energy-efficient neuromorphic computing via controlled topological transitions."}

However, a PBC crystal is not the same as the real macroscopic crystal, therefore, if applied indiscriminately, it can lead to erroneous conclusions. For example, unlike other extensive observables such as total energy, the polarization of a macroscopic crystal cannot always be described by a PBC model, because polarization is inherently nonlocal and strongly dependent on surface terminations, irrespective of crystal size, and moreover, the symmetry of the macroscopic crystal can be altered when the PBC is applied to a macroscopic crystal. We demonstrate in this paper that the polarization of a macroscopic crystal receives contributions from both the repeating bulk units and the crystal surfaces, which must be treated on an equal footing. When the combined system of the bulk and its surfaces are taken into account, materials traditionally classified as nonpolar can, in fact, admit polar symmetry, thus explaining why experimentalists have observed polarization in some nominally ``nonpolar'' systems. Our study, thus, clarifies that polarization can only exist in polar group systems and that apparent violations of Neumann's principle reported in some recent works originate from misinterpreting bulk PBC crystal as intrinsic macroscopic crystal, ignoring the contribution from the surfaces. We demonstrate that when the full bulk-plus-surface system is considered, the crystal polarization and symmetry is fully consistent with Neumann's principle."}

Here we propose that a concentration gradient, which often persists as a quasi-stable nonequilibrium state with long relaxation times in solids, can serve as a general platform for inversion symmetry breaking. We demonstrate this concept in an epitaxial thin film of the hydrogen-doped SmFeAsO (Sm1111:H) superconductor with a depthwise hydrogen-concentration gradient introduced via an optimized topotactic reaction. This film exhibits nonreciprocal charge transport, meaning that the electrical resistance depends on the direction of the applied current, which serves as a key signature of broken inversion symmetry. A pronounced nonreciprocal signal emerges in the vicinity of the superconducting transition, which we attribute to vortex-motion nonreciprocity arising from an asymmetric pinning landscape created by the hydrogen-concentration gradient. Owing to the high critical temperature of Sm1111:H, vortex-origin nonreciprocity is observed above 40 K, representing the highest temperature reported to date among single bulk materials without an artificially hetero-layered structure. Our findings establish concentration-gradient engineering as a versatile and broadly applicable route for realizing inversion-broken states in otherwise centrosymmetric hosts, opening pathways toward a broader landscape of odd-parity-driven functionalities."}

Our theory distinguishes four fundamental types, including three families of magneto-axial phonons differentiated by symmetry and the parity (odd or even) of the PAM wave pattern. Strikingly, we reveal a full sequence of axial phonons exhibiting higher-order-wave (from p- to j-wave) PAM patterns covering both odd and even parities, which we term magneto-alteraxial phonons. Our high-throughput calculations predict hundreds of magnetic candidates hosting such magneto-alteraxial phonons.

We demonstrate the effects of ion migration on the device performance by measuring time dependent short-circuit current and different impedance characteristics that allow to see how charge-carrier separation property degrades. The Schottky effect leads to the rapid decrease of charge-carrier separation characteristic of solar cell while Hoke effect leads to the slow defect accumulation in the perovskite layer leading to the enhanced Shockley-Read-Hall recombination. Separation of these two effects can be realized by simple increase of transport layer thickness.

Reliable modeling of this process is essential, yet conventional treatments neglect dynamic dielectric effects, limiting the predictive reliability at operating conditions. We develop a general framework that incorporates the frequency-dependent screened Coulomb interaction $W_{00}(\\mathbf{q},ω)$, computed from low-scaling \\textit{GW}, into both direct and phonon-assisted Auger amplitudes. Demonstrated on orthorhombic $γ$-CsPbI$_3$ (band gap $E_g\\approx1.73$ eV) and $γ$-CsSnI$_3$ ($E_g\\approx1.30$ eV), the approach shows that dynamic screening enhances the dielectric response, lowering the room-temperature Auger coefficient by $\\sim$50-60 %. This renormalization shifts the crossover between radiative and nonradiative recombination by nearly a factor of two in carrier density. Dynamic dielectric screening thus emerges as a quantitative determinant of Auger recombination, offering a transferable framework for predictive modeling across polar semiconductors where frequency-independent screening models are inadequate."}

In this work, we report that an ill-chosen reference state can induce spurious long-range strange correlators in trivial SPT phases, leading to false positives in SPT diagnosis. Using matrix product state (MPS) representation, we trace the origin of these spurious signals in trivial SPT phases to the magnitude-degeneracy of the transfer matrix. We systematically classify three distinct mechanisms responsible for such degeneracy, each substantiated by concrete examples: (1) the presence of high-dimensional irreducible representations in the entanglement space; (2) a phase mismatch in symmetry representations between the target and reference states; and (3) long-range order arising from symmetry breaking. Our findings clarify the importance of the choice of proper reference states, providing a guideline to avoid pitfalls and correctly identify SPT order using strange correlators."}

The framework combines four stages: first, the symmetry of a given minimum-energy configuration is identified and used to define subsystems whose eigenmodes provide relevant deformation directions; the subsystem eigenmodes are then used to guide the system toward the vicinity of different saddle points surrounding the energy minimum; next, the geodesic minimum mode following method is employed to efficiently converge onto the saddle points; and finally, the identified saddle points are embedded into the state network. Applied to metastable textures in two-dimensional chiral magnets described by a lattice Hamiltonian, the method reveals a hierarchy of transition mechanisms governing the nucleation, annihilation, and rearrangement of the fundamental components of localized magnetic textures. The identified saddle points enable the construction of the network of metastable states, where saddle points define the connectivity between them, providing a comprehensive map of accessible transitions and their associated energy barriers. Transitions corresponding to both homotopies that preserve the topological charge and transformations that change it are identified. By scaling the interaction parameters, the distinct behavior of these two classes is obtained as the continuum limit is approached. Finally, it is shown that textures with the same topological charge are not always connected by a homotopy corresponding to a minimum-energy path: in specific parameter regimes, the total topological charge necessarily increases and then decreases (or vice versa) during the transition, returning to its initial value at the final state."}

Lead zirconate titanate (PZT) and aluminum nitride (AlN) active layers are used in PMUTs to enable acoustic actuation, sensing, or bidirectional operation. These platforms rely on bimorph films to maximize electromechanical coupling ($k^2$) through thin-film deposition, which uses intermediate electrode layers to establish opposing electric fields. Consequently, incumbent PMUT platforms are limited in achievable film thickness and feature material interfaces that compromise mechanical integrity and thermal performance. Combined with the intrinsic limitations of PZT and AlN, these factors motivate exploration of alternative PMUT material platforms. Recent efforts have sought to demonstrate that single-crystal lithium niobate (LN) is a promising candidate, offering substantially higher $k^2$ and bidirectional performance. Advances in LN film transfer technology have enabled the formation of periodically poled piezoelectric (P3F) LN, facilitating a bimorph stack without intermediate electrodes. In this work, we showcase bimorph PMUTs incorporating a mechanically robust, 20 micron thick P3F LN active layer. We establish the motivation for LN PMUTs through a material comparison, followed by extensive membrane geometry optimization and subsequent enhancement of the PMUT's $k^2$.

While state-of-the-art FFT-based homogenization techniques remain effective for moderate datasets, their memory footprint and computational cost grow rapidly with increasing resolution, making them increasingly inefficient for industrial-scale problems. To address these challenges, the recently developed Superfast-Fourier Transform (SFFT)-based homogenization algorithm leverages the memory-efficient low-rank representations of Tensor Trains (TTs), which reduce the storage and computational requirements of large-scale homogenization problems. Developed for CPU usage, SFFT-based Homogenization efficiently handles high-resolution datasets, assuming the underlying data is well-behaved. In this work, we investigate the performance of fundamental TT operations on modern hardware accelerators using the JAX framework. This benchmarking study, comparing CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs, evaluates execution times and computational efficiency. Building on these insights, we adapt the SFFT-based homogenization algorithm for usage on accelerators, achieving speed-ups of up to 10x relative to the CPU implementation, thus paving the road for the treatment of previously infeasible dataset sizes.

The epitaxial interface between the Pb4S3Cl2 chalcohalide and the CsPbCl3 perovskite domain significantly influences the intermediate stages of halide exchange in the perovskite domain, leading to coexisting CsPbCl3 and CsPbI3 domains, thereby delivering segmented CsPbI3-CsPbCl3-Pb4S3Cl2 energetically favorable heterostructures, with partial iodide alloying of the CsPbCl3 domain and at the perovskite-chalcohalide interface.

By analytically removing all gauge redundancies of the PEPS manifold and exploiting tensor locality, we obtain a numerically well-conditioned stochastic reconfiguration (SR) equation amenable to robust solution using the efficient Cholesky decomposition, enabling long-time evolution in previously inaccessible regimes. We demonstrate the power and generality of the method through four representative real-time problems in two dimensions: (I) chiral edge propagation in a free-fermion Chern insulator; (II) fractionalized charge transport in a fractional Chern insulator; (III) vison confinement dynamics in the Higgs phase of a Z2 lattice gauge theory; and (IV) superfluidity and critical velocity in interacting bosons.

We demonstrate that significant polaron formation due to the inherent soft crystal lattice and higher exciton-phonon interaction is responsible for the observed spin funneling effect in mixed-phase 2D RP perovskites. Polaron act as a protective mechanism for spin-polarized excitons, preserving their spin information through the screening of omnipresent phonon-induced momentum scattering.

The insertion of an unusually large A-cation (274 pm in diameter) in the perovskite structure, hitherto considered unlikely due to the unfavorable Goldschmidt tolerance factor, results in a significantly larger lattice parameter compared to the Cs-, methylammonium- and formamidinium-based lead halide perovskite homologues. As a consequence, EAPbI3 nanocrystals are highly unstable, evolving to a non-perovskite delta-EAPbI3 polymorph within one day. Also, EAPbI3 nanocrystals are very sensitive to electron irradiation and quickly degrade to PbI2 upon exposure to the electron beam, following a mechanism similar to that of other hybrid lead iodide perovskites (although degradation can be reduced by partially replacing the EA+ ions with Cs+ ions). Interestingly, in some cases during this degradation the formation of an epitaxial interface between (EAxCs1-x)PbI3 and PbI2 is observed. The photoluminescence emission of the EAPbI3 perovskite nanocrystals, albeit being characterized by a low quantum yield (around 1%), can be tuned in the 664-690 nm range by regulating their size during the synthesis. The emission efficiency can be improved upon partial alloying at the A site with Cs+ or formamidinium cations. Furthermore, the morphology of the EAPbI3 nanocrystals can be chosen to be either nanocube or nanoplatelet, depending on the synthesis conditions."}

While nonlinear responses governed by bulk quantum geometry and band topology are well understood, the role of boundary modes (e.g., edge, surface, and hinge states) in nonlinear transport of topological materials remains largely unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate boundary-bulk interplay in nonlinear transport, including second-harmonic Hall and nonreciprocal longitudinal responses, in molecular beam epitaxy-grown magnetic topological insulator heterostructures. We find that the nonlinear transport is maximized when the sample is tuned slightly away from the well-quantized states, including the quantum anomalous Hall and axion insulator states. The sign and amplitude of the nonlinear transport depend on electrode configuration, magnetic order, and carrier type, establishing boundary mode transport as the dominant contributor. These findings, supported by symmetry analysis and nonlinear Landauer-Büttiker formalism, demonstrate that nonlinear transport in topological materials is governed by the interplay between boundary and bulk states. We further derive a universal relation between different lead voltages from electrode geometry symmetry, which allows us to distinguish nonlinear boundary transport from bulk contributions. Our work highlights the critical role of electrodes in nonlinear transport, which is absent in nonlinear optics, and establishes boundary modes as a key origin of the giant nonlinear response in nearly bulk-insulating topological materials. This insight opens new opportunities for engineering nonlinear transport through boundary-bulk interplay in future device applications of topological materials."}

For instance, ideal metallic tubes suppress long-range Coulomb interactions between ions exponentially. Yet, there exists no generic framework for evaluating electrostatic interactions in tubular confinement. Here, we introduce tubular response functions - a generalisation of surface response functions that captures how nanotubes with arbitrary electronic properties screen Coulomb interactions. Using this framework, we evaluate the interaction potential of ions confined in a metallic carbon nanotube, treating its electronic properties exactly within a Luttinger liquid model. We demonstrate that the long-range exponential screening characteristic of ideal metals persists in realistic metallic nanotubes, regardless of their electron density. We trace the origin of this perfect screening property to the quantum confinement of electrons along the tube circumference. Our framework opens the way for quantitative descriptions of ionic correlations and charge storage in nanotube-based electrodes, and can be further extended to address confined ion dynamics."}

By applying mirror-symmetric combinatorial operations to the unit structures, we further construct composite chiral metastructures that enable both one-dimensional and two-dimensional stable transport of acoustic bimerons. It is further revealed that bimeron transport originates from the locked opposite phase differences of SSAWs, induced by the handedness of the cavity resonant modes. The intrinsic robustness of the meron textures against structural defects is confirmed through the calculation of their topological charge. Our findings establish stable acoustic bimeron transport as a topologically resilient foundation for future acoustic information processing and storage technologies."}

Here we uncover a common probabilistic structure, the concentration of measure, in Hamiltonian dynamics of two families of systems, the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT) model which is finite-dimensional and (almost) ergodic, and the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) which is infinite-dimensional and suffers strong ergodicity breaking. That structure is protected by the geometry of phase space and immune to ergodicity breaking, leading to counterintuitive phenomena. Notably, an isolated FPUT behaves as a thermal ideal gas even for strong modal interaction, with the thermalization time analogous to the Ehrenfest time in quantum chaos, while an isolated GPE system, without any quantum inputs, escapes the celebrated ultraviolet catastrophe through nonlinear wave localization in the mode space, and the Rayleigh-Jeans equilibrium sets in the localization volume.

Here, we reveal the spontaneous formation of hitherto unreported ultra-thin GeSn fins with sub-30 nm thickness during vapor-phase growth on Ge nanowire substrates. A transition from the typical conformal GeSn shell to distinct fin-like structures occurs along the nanowire growth axis and is accompanied by ordered twin defects extending longitudinally and laterally, inducing a transition from diamond to hexagonal-like crystal structure.

In this work, we investigate Cs(n+1)PbnBr3n+1 nanoplatelets (n = 2-5) experimentally and theoretically and show that the interplay between dielectric confinement and anisotropic screening critically determines both their electronic structure and excitonic landscape. To incorporate the dielectric screening effects, the Coulomb kernel in the Fock exchange term is refined using a model dielectric function together with a model Bethe-Salpeter Equation approach. The exciton binding energies show a monotonic decrease from 0.26 eV to 0.21 eV from n = 2 to 5, with 20 meV decrease per layer up to n = 4, and thereafter less change. The relatively small change per layer is a consequence of the strong spatial localization of excitons. By analyzing directionally resolved dielectric tensors, we demonstrate that the in-plane dielectric constant predominantly dictates optical transitions and is close to converging to the bulk value already at n = 5, while the out-of-plane dielectric response reflects the confined nature of excitonic wave functions as expected. Our calculated absorption spectra capture experimental results within 0.02 eV throughout the confinement regime (n = 2-5). The effects of lattice dynamics on the dimensionally dependent dielectric response and subsequent exciton screening occurring on longer time-scales than the optical response are also analyzed, important for analysis and interpretation of exciton lifetime, diffusion, and band alignments.

They include a peak in $\\text{Re}\\,σ(ω)$ above the optical gap and a sign change of $\\text{Im}\\,σ(ω)$, with both effects becoming more pronounced at higher $I$ and lower $T$. We also elucidate the role of inelastic relaxation, which governs the low-frequency response, leading to a giant microwave absorption and a suppression of the apparent superfluid density at the critical current. The optical conductivity measurement of a superconductor biased by a finite dc supercurrent enables the direct observation of the Schmid-Higgs mode via transport measurements."}

This common origin implies that extreme crystal distortion, by narrowing bandwidths, enhancing correlations and reshaping the symmetries of altermagnetic spin splittings, could unify flat-band and altermagnetic physics in a single material; in practice, however, achieving such large distortions in a crystalline altermagnet is a formidable challenge. Here we combine a dedicated strain device with a tailored single-crystal mounting scheme to impose a highly tensile strain gradient in bulk CrSb, a prototypical altermagnet, creating a near-surface layer in which the in-plane lattice is strongly distorted relative to the weakly strained bulk, while the average bulk distortion remains small. Angle-resolved photoemission reveals a reversible regime at moderate strain, where a deeper flat-band feature, attributed to a strain-gradient-driven suppression of Cr-Sb hybridization, coexists with a correlation-enhanced Cr 3d flat band, and an irreversible regime at larger strain where partial bond decoupling drives a predominantly insulating spectral response. Density-functional calculations show that an orbital-selective altermagnetic spin texture persists across this correlated regime despite strong bandwidth renormalisation. These results define a strain-symmetry-correlation map for CrSb and establish extreme tensile strain as a route to co-engineer flat-band tendencies and spin-textured, zero-net-moment correlated states in altermagnets, pointing toward strain-adaptive, spin-selective Mott filtering and related device concepts."}

While nonlinear responses governed by bulk quantum geometry and band topology are well understood, the role of boundary modes (e.g., edge, surface, and hinge states) in nonlinear transport of topological materials remains largely unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate boundary-bulk interplay in nonlinear transport, including second-harmonic Hall and nonreciprocal longitudinal responses, in molecular beam epitaxy-grown magnetic topological insulator heterostructures. We find that the nonlinear transport is maximized when the sample is tuned slightly away from the well-quantized states, including the quantum anomalous Hall and axion insulator states. The sign and amplitude of the nonlinear transport depend on electrode configuration, magnetic order, and carrier type, establishing boundary mode transport as the dominant contributor. These findings, supported by symmetry analysis and nonlinear Landauer-Büttiker formalism, demonstrate that nonlinear transport in topological materials is governed by the interplay between boundary and bulk states. We further derive a universal relation between different lead voltages from electrode geometry symmetry, which allows us to distinguish nonlinear boundary transport from bulk contributions. Our work highlights the critical role of electrodes in nonlinear transport, which is absent in nonlinear optics, and establishes boundary modes as a key origin of the giant nonlinear response in nearly bulk-insulating topological materials. This insight opens new opportunities for engineering nonlinear transport through boundary-bulk interplay in future device applications of topological materials."}

This influence is particularly pronounced in quasi-one-dimensional nanotubes, where the high surface-to-volume ratio makes the wall the dominant source of electrostatic screening. For instance, ideal metallic tubes suppress long-range Coulomb interactions between ions exponentially. Yet, there exists no generic framework for evaluating electrostatic interactions in tubular confinement. Here, we introduce tubular response functions - a generalisation of surface response functions that captures how nanotubes with arbitrary electronic properties screen Coulomb interactions. Using this framework, we evaluate the interaction potential of ions confined in a metallic carbon nanotube, treating its electronic properties exactly within a Luttinger liquid model. We demonstrate that the long-range exponential screening characteristic of ideal metals persists in realistic metallic nanotubes, regardless of their electron density. We trace the origin of this perfect screening property to the quantum confinement of electrons along the tube circumference. Our framework opens the way for quantitative descriptions of ionic correlations and charge storage in nanotube-based electrodes, and can be further extended to address confined ion dynamics."}

In this work we perform detailed photodynamical studies of the spin complexes in hBN. In particular, we show that spin transitions are located within the metastable manifold which can be explained by the rate model, populating in a cascading manner. In addition, we perform temperature dependent measurements on these defects and show that the spin-lattice relaxation and coherence times increase as the temperature reduces. Furthermore, we find that the ODMR frequencies of the S=1 transition show only a marginal frequency shift as a function of temperature, which makes them a robust sensor at cryogenic temperatures.

Recent theories have suggested a strong orbital Hall effect within the light metal Al and a strong orbital Rashba effect at Co/Al interfaces, providing ideal platforms for experimental verification of possible orbital transport effects. Here, we report robust experimental evidence for the strong localization of orbital polarization. We demonstrate that neither the bulk nor the interface of the Al contributes a detectable orbital torque on adjacent magnetic layer with strong bulk and interfacial spin-orbit coupling necessary for potential orbital-spin conversion. These results have clarified that orbital polarization undergoes much faster relaxation than spin polarization and hardly participates in non-local accumulation, transport, or torque generation. The experimental evidence for strong localization of orbital polarization represents a groundbreaking advance towards solving the essential orbital torque debate."}

However, a PBC crystal is not the same as the real macroscopic crystal, therefore, if applied indiscriminately, it can lead to erroneous conclusions. For example, unlike other extensive observables such as total energy, the polarization of a macroscopic crystal cannot always be described by a PBC model, because polarization is inherently nonlocal and strongly dependent on surface terminations, irrespective of crystal size, and moreover, the symmetry of the macroscopic crystal can be altered when the PBC is applied to a macroscopic crystal. We demonstrate in this paper that the polarization of a macroscopic crystal receives contributions from both the repeating bulk units and the crystal surfaces, which must be treated on an equal footing. When the combined system of the bulk and its surfaces are taken into account, materials traditionally classified as nonpolar can, in fact, admit polar symmetry, thus explaining why experimentalists have observed polarization in some nominally ``nonpolar'' systems. Our study, thus, clarifies that polarization can only exist in polar group systems and that apparent violations of Neumann's principle reported in some recent works originate from misinterpreting bulk PBC crystal as intrinsic macroscopic crystal, ignoring the contribution from the surfaces. We demonstrate that when the full bulk-plus-surface system is considered, the crystal polarization and symmetry is fully consistent with Neumann's principle."}

We demonstrate this concept in an epitaxial thin film of the hydrogen-doped SmFeAsO (Sm1111:H) superconductor with a depthwise hydrogen-concentration gradient introduced via an optimized topotactic reaction. This film exhibits nonreciprocal charge transport, meaning that the electrical resistance depends on the direction of the applied current, which serves as a key signature of broken inversion symmetry. A pronounced nonreciprocal signal emerges in the vicinity of the superconducting transition, which we attribute to vortex-motion nonreciprocity arising from an asymmetric pinning landscape created by the hydrogen-concentration gradient. Owing to the high critical temperature of Sm1111:H, vortex-origin nonreciprocity is observed above 40 K, representing the highest temperature reported to date among single bulk materials without an artificially hetero-layered structure. Our findings establish concentration-gradient engineering as a versatile and broadly applicable route for realizing inversion-broken states in otherwise centrosymmetric hosts, opening pathways toward a broader landscape of odd-parity-driven functionalities."}

It has been proposed that non-equilibrium phases of matter can be defined as equivalence classes of states connected by short-time evolution while maintaining a finite Markov length, a notion called local reversibility. A natural question is whether well-known classical models of non-equilibrium criticality fit within this framework. Here we investigate the Domany--Kinzel model -- which exhibits an active phase and an absorbing phase separated by a 1+1-D directed-percolation transition -- from this information-theoretic perspective. Using tensor network simulations, we provide evidence for local reversibility within the active phase. Notably, the Markov length diverges upon approaching the critical point, unlike classical equilibrium transitions where Markov length is zero due to their Gibbs character. Correspondingly, the conditional mutual information exhibits scaling consistent with directed percolation universality. Further, we analytically study the case of 1+1-D compact directed percolation, where the Markov length diverges throughout the phase diagram due to spontaneous breaking of domain-wall parity symmetry from strong to weak. Nevertheless, the conditional mutual information continues to faithfully detect the corresponding phase transition."}

Utilizing the unrestricted Hartree-Fock approximation, we derive a set of self-consistent equations that evaluate the excitonic and photonic order parameters in a two-band electronic model, accounting equally for both electron-hole Coulomb attraction and light-matter coupling. Analyzing the competition among these condensate order parameters reveals a complex phase structure of coherent states in the ground state. As the mass imbalance is reduced, we observe a transition from a normal disordered electron-hole-photon system to excitoniclike, polariton, and ultimately photoniclike polariton condensation states. The distinct features of these robust condensates can be identified in the momentum distribution of the electron-hole pair amplitude and the photonic density, as well as in the wave-number-resolved photoemission spectra of electrons, holes, and photons. Increasing the excitation density further expands the range of condensation states. Additionally, lowering the mass imbalance leads to the emergence of quantum coherent bound states prior to the formation of robust condensates, which are evidenced by the static and dynamical excitonic and photonic susceptibility functions."}

They also represent an intriguing class of chemical systems with strongly correlated multi-reference excited states, due to the $d^3$ electron configuration. These states are difficult to describe accurately using single-reference quantum chemical methods such as density functional theory (DFT), the most commonly used method to study the electronic structures of solid-state systems.

Specifically, our framework includes hitherto neglected mode-coupling effects that are important for the non-linear density response even in the presence of a single harmonic perturbation. We compare these predictions for $χ_0^{(1,3)}(\\vec{q})$ to new Kohn-Sham DFT simulations, leading to excellent agreement between theory and numerical results.

The electronic and magnetic properties reveal that the full-Heusler alloys Co$_2$YPb (with Y = Tc, Ti, Zr, and Hf) display half-metallic ferromagnetic behavior.

In this work, spectroscopic ellipsometry is used to determine the uniaxial dielectric response of bulk $1T$-TaS$_2$ from room temperature down to the commensurate insulating state. The room-temperature data reveal natural type-II hyperbolic behavior in the visible range, with negative in-plane and positive out-of-plane permittivity. Temperature-dependent ellipsometry combined with anisotropic Bruggeman effective medium analysis shows that the metallic domains responsible for percolation evolve from disc-like to needle-like shapes, and that, upon heating, an additional intermediate phase emerges.

Here, by employing magnetic point group analysis, we develop a complete classification of long-wavelength phonons in collinear magnets. Our theory distinguishes four fundamental types, including three families of magneto-axial phonons differentiated by symmetry and the parity (odd or even) of the PAM wave pattern. Strikingly, we reveal a full sequence of axial phonons exhibiting higher-order-wave (from p- to j-wave) PAM patterns covering both odd and even parities, which we term magneto-alteraxial phonons. Our high-throughput calculations predict hundreds of magnetic candidates hosting such magneto-alteraxial phonons.

We demonstrate the effects of ion migration on the device performance by measuring time dependent short-circuit current and different impedance characteristics that allow to see how charge-carrier separation property degrades. The Schottky effect leads to the rapid decrease of charge-carrier separation characteristic of solar cell while Hoke effect leads to the slow defect accumulation in the perovskite layer leading to the enhanced Shockley-Read-Hall recombination.

Here, we demonstrate all-electrical detection of spin textures in vdW itinerant ferromagnet Fe5GeTe2 using pure spin transport in a lateral graphene spin-valve device at room temperature. By engineering nanoscale constrictions or notches in Fe5GeTe2, we create spin textures that inject distinct spin polarizations into the graphene channel, where they are nonlocally sensed by a reference conventional ferromagnetic detector at room temperature. This enables the observation of anomalous multi-level spin-valve switching and Hanle spin precession signals, which are due to unique spin textures in Fe5GeTe2 and in sharp contrast to single-domains and conventional magnet-based devices.

Due to its simultaneously breaking U(1)-gauge and translational symmetries, intriguing vestigial phases which restore only one broken symmetry can emerge at an intermediate temperature regime. Previously, investigations on the vestigial phases of PDW were mainly focused on incommensurate PDW. However, the experimentally observed PDW is usually commensurate, whose vestigial phases have not been systematically investigated. Here we study the vestigial phases of 2D commensurate PDW with $n$-times expanded unit vectors, hosting different numbers of wave vectors. Based on the Ginzburg-Landau theory, we get the low energy effective model Hamiltonian. Subsequent renormalization group (RG) and Monte-Carlo (MC) studies are conducted to obtain the phase diagram and spatial dependent correlation functions. Our RG and MC calculations consistently yield the following result. For $n\\le 4$, besides the charge-4e/2e superconductivity, there exists the translational symmetry broken charge-density-wave (CDW) vetigial phase. Intriguingly, for $n\\ge 5$, the restore of the translational symmetry with increasing temperature is realized through two successive Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions.

We demonstrate that impurity effects vary significantly depending on both the pairing symmetry and impurity location: interlayer-dominant pairing produces sharp resonance states when impurities are in the inner layer, whereas impurities in the outer layer lead to in-gap enhancements without sharp resonances; in contrast, intralayer-dominant pairing generally yields increased in-gap LDOS without sharp impurity resonances, regardless of impurity position.

We prove that this map yields a smooth Riemannian structure $g_{ij}$ if and only if the short-distance mutual information (MI) follows the anisotropic inverse-quadratic law (local exponent $X_{\\text{loc}}=2$).

We introduce ``MI Tomography,'' an operational protocol to reconstruct these geometric components from finite directional measurements. The protocol is validated using the equal-time ground state of an anisotropic 2D quantum harmonic lattice (massless relativistic scalar) on a torus, where the reconstructed shape tensor $γ_{ij}$ quantitatively recovers the physical coupling anisotropy.

The framework combines four stages: first, the symmetry of a given minimum-energy configuration is identified and used to define subsystems whose eigenmodes provide relevant deformation directions; the subsystem eigenmodes are then used to guide the system toward the vicinity of different saddle points surrounding the energy minimum; next, the geodesic minimum mode following method is employed to efficiently converge onto the saddle points; and finally, the identified saddle points are embedded into the state network. Applied to metastable textures in two-dimensional chiral magnets described by a lattice Hamiltonian, the method reveals a hierarchy of transition mechanisms governing the nucleation, annihilation, and rearrangement of the fundamental components of localized magnetic textures. The identified saddle points enable the construction of the network of metastable states, where saddle points define the connectivity between them, providing a comprehensive map of accessible transitions and their associated energy barriers. Transitions corresponding to both homotopies that preserve the topological charge and transformations that change it are identified. By scaling the interaction parameters, the distinct behavior of these two classes is obtained as the continuum limit is approached. Finally, it is shown that textures with the same topological charge are not always connected by a homotopy corresponding to a minimum-energy path: in specific parameter regimes, the total topological charge necessarily increases and then decreases (or vice versa) during the transition, returning to its initial value at the final state."}

This common origin implies that extreme crystal distortion, by narrowing bandwidths, enhancing correlations and reshaping the symmetries of altermagnetic spin splittings, could unify flat-band and altermagnetic physics in a single material; in practice, however, achieving such large distortions in a crystalline altermagnet is a formidable challenge. Here we combine a dedicated strain device with a tailored single-crystal mounting scheme to impose a highly tensile strain gradient in bulk CrSb, a prototypical altermagnet, creating a near-surface layer in which the in-plane lattice is strongly distorted relative to the weakly strained bulk, while the average bulk distortion remains small. Angle-resolved photoemission reveals a reversible regime at moderate strain, where a deeper flat-band feature, attributed to a strain-gradient-driven suppression of Cr-Sb hybridization, coexists with a correlation-enhanced Cr 3d flat band, and an irreversible regime at larger strain where partial bond decoupling drives a predominantly insulating spectral response. Density-functional calculations show that an orbital-selective altermagnetic spin texture persists across this correlated regime despite strong bandwidth renormalisation. These results define a strain-symmetry-correlation map for CrSb and establish extreme tensile strain as a route to co-engineer flat-band tendencies and spin-textured, zero-net-moment correlated states in altermagnets, pointing toward strain-adaptive, spin-selective Mott filtering and related device concepts."}

When the in-plane bias field is swept through a critical value in the presence of finite Gilbert damping, the spin-wave dispersion undergoes dramatic softening, and the eigenfrequency crosses zero and acquires a positive imaginary part that drives exponential growth. We identify this as a damping-induced instability operating near an exceptional point-a non-Hermitian degeneracy where, counterintuitively, increased Gilbert damping enhances amplification. This mechanism exploits ingredients specific to these magnetic films: the interplay of Gilbert damping, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya-interaction-induced nonreciprocity, and field-driven phase transitions-a combination that, to our knowledge, has no direct counterpart in photonic or acoustic time-varying platforms.

Lead zirconate titanate (PZT) and aluminum nitride (AlN) active layers are used in PMUTs to enable acoustic actuation, sensing, or bidirectional operation. These platforms rely on bimorph films to maximize electromechanical coupling ($k^2$) through thin-film deposition, which uses intermediate electrode layers to establish opposing electric fields. Consequently, incumbent PMUT platforms are limited in achievable film thickness and feature material interfaces that compromise mechanical integrity and thermal performance. Combined with the intrinsic limitations of PZT and AlN, these factors motivate exploration of alternative PMUT material platforms. Recent efforts have sought to demonstrate that single-crystal lithium niobate (LN) is a promising candidate, offering substantially higher $k^2$ and bidirectional performance. Advances in LN film transfer technology have enabled the formation of periodically poled piezoelectric (P3F) LN, facilitating a bimorph stack without intermediate electrodes. In this work, we showcase bimorph PMUTs incorporating a mechanically robust, 20 micron thick P3F LN active layer. We establish the motivation for LN PMUTs through a material comparison, followed by extensive membrane geometry optimization and subsequent enhancement of the PMUT's $k^2$.

At half-filling, the zero-temperature ground state is a commensurate charge-density-wave (CDW) with alternating occupied and empty sites. This quasi-classical formulation enables us to isolate the role of electrons in coarsening dynamics. Following a thermal quench, CDW domains grow through the diffusion and annihilation of kinks -- topological defects separating the two symmetry-related CDW orders. While standard diffusive dynamics predicts domain sizes scaling as the square root of time, our large-scale simulations reveal a slower power-law growth with a temperature-dependent exponent. We trace this anomalous behavior to a cooperative kink hopping arising from Fermi-Dirac statistics of electrons and quasi-conservation of electron numbers. The correlated-hopping of kinks in turn gives rise to an effective diffusion coefficient that depends on the kink density. These results uncover a new mechanism for slow coarsening and carry implications for phase-ordering in the full Holstein model and related electron-phonon systems."}

This setting encompasses driven soft matter as well as biomolecular, biochemical, and biophysical systems. Despite its central role, direct measurements of entropy production remain challenging - especially in small systems dominated by fluctuations. The main difficulty arises because not all degrees of freedom contributing to entropy production are experimentally accessible. A key question, therefore, is how to infer entropy production from coarse-grained observations, such as time series of experimentally measurable variables. Over the past decade, stochastic thermodynamics has provided several inequalities that yield model-free lower bounds on entropy production from such coarse-grained data. The major approaches rely on observations of coarse-grained states, fluctuating currents or ticks, correlation functions of coarse-grained observables, and waiting-time distributions between so-called Markovian events, which correspond to transitions between mesoscopic states. Here, we systematically review these techniques valid under the sole assumption of a Markovian, i.e., memoryless, dynamics on an underlying, not necessarily observable, network of states or following a possibly high-dimensional Langevin equation. We discuss in detail the large class of non-equilibrium steady states and highlight extensions of these methods to time-dependent and relaxing systems.

To address these challenges, the recently developed Superfast-Fourier Transform (SFFT)-based homogenization algorithm leverages the memory-efficient low-rank representations of Tensor Trains (TTs), which reduce the storage and computational requirements of large-scale homogenization problems. Developed for CPU usage, SFFT-based Homogenization efficiently handles high-resolution datasets, assuming the underlying data is well-behaved.
