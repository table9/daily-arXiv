Through the inclusion of two gate-tunable Josephson junctions in series in each interference branch of a double-loop SQUID, we demonstrate independent control over both the harmonic content and the amplitude of three interfering CPRs, facilitating significant improvement in the maximum diode efficiency. Through optimized gate-controlled tuning of individual Josephson energies, diode efficiency exceeding 50% is demonstrated. Flux-dependent oscillations show quantitative agreement with a simple model of SQUID operation."}

It is shown that the spin-momentum locking locally takes place in the quasicrystal, and electron motion and spin directions are tightly connected at each spatial position in the real space. As a result, the spin susceptibility is enhanced for both in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic fields in the presence of a Rashba-type spin-orbit interaction. For an Ising-type spin-orbit interaction, the spin susceptibility only for in-plane magnetic fields is increased, while the out-of-plane spin susceptibility is almost unchanged.

Beyond the inherently large relativistic effects associated with a high proton number $Z$, an increased molecular charge can further enhance the electronic sensitivity to symmetry-violating nuclear effects, including nuclear Schiff moments. Experimental investigations of multiply charged actinide molecules are challenging because the high charges severely destabilize chemical bonds, leading to spontaneous Coulomb explosion. We demonstrate a method to systematically generate and detect molecular ions at the edge of chemical stability. By applying high-fluence laser ablation to a depleted uranium metal foil, we produce atomic uranium ions U$^{z+}$ and uranium monoxide cations UO$^{z+}$ with $z = 1$--4. Among them, we observe UO$^{3+}$ and UO$^{4+}$, which exhibit comparatively simple electronic structures and are therefore promising for precision spectroscopy. The experiments are supported by relativistic density functional theory calculations of equilibrium bond lengths, charge distributions, and binding energies of all observed molecules. Calculations of symmetry-violating properties suggest a pronounced sensitivity of UO$^{3+}$ to hadronic $CP$ violation. This approach opens a pathway for high-precision investigations of fundamental symmetries and the exploration of relativistic actinide chemistry in previously inaccessible regimes."}

However, training them typically requires large, diverse datasets, often created via synthetic unit cell simulations. This hinders practical adoption because physical experiments on standardized specimens with simple geometries fail to generate sufficiently diverse stress-strain trajectories. Consequently, an unreasonably large number of experiments or complex multi-axial tests would be needed. This work shows that such networks can be trained from a single specimen subjected to simple uniaxial loading, by designing the specimen using a novel automatically differentiable elastoplastic topology optimization method. Our strategy diversifies the stress-strain states observed in a single test involving plastic deformation. We then employ the automatically differentiable model updating (ADiMU) method to train the neural network surrogates. This work demonstrates that topology-optimized specimens under simple loading can train large neural networks, thereby substantially reducing the experimental burden associated with data-driven material modeling."}

As a source of dissipation, these excess quasiparticles degrade the performance of various devices. Therefore, understanding their dynamics, especially their recombination into Cooper pairs, is an active topic of current research. In disordered superconductors, spatial fluctuations in the superconducting gap can trap quasiparticles and modify their eigenspectrum. Since this spectrum plays a key role in quasiparticle dynamics, it must be carefully investigated. To this end, we introduce a toy model of a single trap. Specifically, we consider a shallow disk-shaped gap variation in a clean superconductor. Using a semiclassical approximation, we demonstrate the existence of multiple bound states and give the dependence of their number on the size and depth of the gap suppression. Extending our analysis beyond the semiclassical regime, in dimensions larger than one, we observe an infinite number of bound states very close to the gap edge, even for an arbitrarily small trap. These results deepen our understanding of trapped quasiparticles and may have important implications for their recombination in disordered superconductors."}

The localized active space self-consistent field method (LASSCF) uses a product of fragment active spaces as a variational space, with the Schrödinger equation solved exactly in each fragment and the fragment active-space orbitals defined in a self-consistent manner. LASSCF is accurate for systems with strong intra-fragment and weak inter-fragment correlation, and its computational cost is combinatorial with respect to the size of the individual fragment active spaces, rather than their product. However, exactly solving the Schrödinger equation in each fragment remains a substantial bottleneck. Here, we address the possibility of solving the fragment active space Schrödinger equation with approximate methods, particularly sample-based quantum diagonalization (SQD). SQD is a technique that uses a quantum computer to sample configurations from a chemically motivated quantum circuit and a classical computer to mitigate errors and solve the Schrödinger equation in a subspace of the configuration space. We apply the proposed method, LASSQD, to the [Fe(H$_2$O)$_4$]$_2$bpym$^{4+}$ compound and the [Fe$^{\\mathrm{III}}$Fe$^{\\mathrm{III}}$Fe$^{\\mathrm{II}}$($μ$$_3$-O)-(HCOO)$_6$] complex for calculating the intermediate-spin ground state energies. We observe that LASSQD can tackle fragment sizes intractable by LASSCF, achieves within 1kcal/mol agreement to LASSCF, and delivers results that are competitive with alternative classical methods to solve the Schrödinger equation, and thus can be used as a starting point for a perturbative treatment (LASSQD-PDFT) to recover correlation external to the active space."}

The exploration has been successfully guided by the paradigm of ideal flat Chern bands, which mimic Landau levels in both band topology and local quantum geometry. Yet, given the near-infinite possibilities for Bloch bands in lattices, it remains a major open question whether FQAH states can emerge in scenarios fundamentally different from this paradigm. Here we turn to a class of gapless flat bands, featuring divergent quantum geometry at singular band touching, non-integer Berry flux threading the Brillouin zone (BZ), and ill-defined band topology. Our exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group calculations unambiguously demonstrate FQAH phase that is virtually independent of the interaction strength, persisting from the weak-interaction to the strong-interaction limit. We find the stability of the FQAH states does not uniquely correlate with the singularity strength or the BZ-averaged quantum geometric fluctuations. Instead, the many-body topological order can adapt to the singular and fluctuating quantum geometric landscape by spontaneously developing an inhomogeneous carrier distribution, while its quenching accompanies the drop in the occupation-weighted Berry flux. Our work reveals a profound interplay between quantum geometry and many-body correlation, and significantly expands the design space for exploring FQAH effect and flat-band correlation phenomena in general."}

The incorporation of Be into the diamond lattice is more favorable as a substitutional dopant than as an interstitial dopant, although both processes are endothermic. Interstitial Be could potentially exhibit motional averaging from planar to axial symmetry with an activation energy of 0.1 eV. The most stable Be$_s$ configuration has $T_{d}$ symmetry with a spin state of $S=1$. Co-doping with nitrogen reduces the formation energy of Be$_s$-N$_{n}$ $(n=1-4)$ complexes, which further decreases as the number of nitrogen atoms increases. This is attributed to the smaller covalent radius of nitrogen compared to carbon, resulting in reduced lattice distortion.

At ambient pressure, MnBi8Te13 exhibits FM ordering with an easy-axis along the c-axis which is progressively suppressed under pressure and replaced by an antiferromagnetic (AFM) order. Density functional theory calculations predicted an evolution from FM to a G-type AFMg2 phase near 5 GPa.

This pressure-induced SC may co-exist with another AFM dome that shows a weak anomaly in the transport data. In contrast, our work on MnBi6Te10 shows no SC up to 40 GPa.

The switching is governed by two main sources of current transients: i) spin currents pumped by the reference layer, and ii) spin-polarized currents due to non-equilibrium hot electrons excited by the laser pulse. In particular, an initial superdiffusive forward flow of electrons, polarized by the free layer, is generated. This drives parallel to antiparallel switching of the free layer through accumulation of minority spins at the reference layer. A diffusive backward flow of electrons, repolarized by the reference layer, follows the initial superdiffusive flow as the charge distribution re-equilibrates. Due to the pulse width-dependent asymmetric amplitudes of the forward and backward transients, the latter can drive antiparallel to parallel switching, and create multi-domain structures at higher laser fluences and longer pulses. The results obtained here are in agreement with experimental observations, providing a framework for self-consistent modelling of all-optical switching in metallic heterostructures."}

These are used to compare the CE results with those obtained using the Boltzmann formalism, the Migdal approximation, and its self consistent extension-approaches that are presently the most commonly employed alternatives for transport calculations. Supported by analytical arguments based on spectral sum rules and by our previous results for the Holstein model, we argue that, for weak to moderate coupling strengths and not-too-low temperatures, the CE within the IPA framework yields accurate results.

The associated charge transition levels (CTLs) can depend on temperature, requiring accurate treatment of vibrational and electronic free-energy contributions. In this work, we use machine-learned interatomic potentials to efficiently compute temperature-dependent CTLs for vacancies in MgO, LiF, and CsSnBr3. Using thermodynamic integration, we quantify free-energy differences between charge states and calculate the vibrational entropy contributions at finite temperatures. We find that CTLs shift with temperature in MgO, LiF and CsSnBr3 from both entropy and electronic contributions. Notably, in CsSnBr3 a neutral charge state becomes thermodynamically stable above 60 K, introducing a temperature-dependent Fermi-level window absent at 0 K. We show that the widely used static, zero-kelvin defect formalism can miss both quantitative CTL shifts and the qualitative emergence of new stable charge states."}

The incorporation of Be into the diamond lattice is more favorable as a substitutional dopant than as an interstitial dopant, although both processes are endothermic. Interstitial Be could potentially exhibit motional averaging from planar to axial symmetry with an activation energy of 0.1 eV. The most stable Be$_s$ configuration has $T_{d}$ symmetry with a spin state of $S=1$. Co-doping with nitrogen reduces the formation energy of Be$_s$-N$_{n}$ $(n=1-4)$ complexes, which further decreases as the number of nitrogen atoms increases. This is attributed to the smaller covalent radius of nitrogen compared to carbon, resulting in reduced lattice distortion. Be$_s$-N$_3$ and Be$_s$-N$_4$ co-doping introduces shallow donors, while Be$_s$ exhibits $n$-type semiconductivity, but the deep donor level renders it impractical for room-temperature applications. These findings provide valuable insights into the behavior of beryllium as a dopant in diamond and highlight the potential of beryllium-nitrogen co-doping for achieving $n$-type diamond semiconductors."}

Existing predictive models typically infer scalar kinetic parameters at a full SOC or a few discrete SOC levels, preventing them from capturing the continuous SOC dependence that governs exothermic behavior during abuse conditions. To address this, we apply the Kolmogorov-Arnold Chemical Reaction Neural Network (KA-CRNN) framework to learn continuous and realistic SOC-dependent exothermic cathode-electrolyte interactions. We apply a physics-encoded KA-CRNN to learn SOC-dependent kinetic parameters for cathode-electrolyte decomposition directly from differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) data. A mechanistically informed reaction pathway is embedded into the network architecture, enabling the activation energies, pre-exponential factors, enthalpies, and related parameters to be represented as continuous and fully interpretable functions of the SOC. The framework is demonstrated for NCA, NM, and NMA cathodes, yielding models that reproduce DSC heat-release features across all SOCs and provide interpretable insight into SOC-dependent oxygen-release and phase-transformation mechanisms. This approach establishes a foundation for extending kinetic parameter dependencies to additional environmental and electrochemical variables, supporting more accurate and interpretable thermal-runaway prediction and monitoring."}

They have also been used to demonstrate that information is trapped in the zero dimensional edge modes of topological insulators and superconductors, and does not become scrambled. Here we study scrambling in two dimensional topological models. In the bulk the butterfly velocity, the speed at which the out-of-time ordered correlator spreads, gains a directional dependence from the underlying lattice. Furthermore when there are chiral or helical edge modes present these cause a form of dynamical scarring. The information about an initial perturbation on the boundary of the system travels around the edge, carried by the edge modes, but is not scrambled over very long time scales. The direction and speed of the scars are given by the velocities of the linearly dispersing edge modes. We further show that these scars do not interact, passing through each other.

Typically, the prediction of the kinetics of these events relies on Arrhenius laws, with exponentially distributed waiting times, and no correlations between successive occurrences. However, this description breaks down in the presence of long-term memory, as has been observed in the contexts of geophysical time series or protein dynamics. So far, existing analytical approaches do not quantify the correlations between rare events due to long-term memory. Here, for non-Markovian Gaussian processes, we determine analytically the impact of long-term memory on the distribution of first and second passage times to a rarely reached threshold. This distribution is non-exponential, thus going beyond the Arrhenius paradigm. We obtain an explicit expression for the covariance between the first and second passage times, and we predict how the mean time to the next extreme event depends on the previous passage time, illustrating the phenomenon of clustering of extreme events. These analytical results, validated through extensive stochastic simulations, shed lights on the strong correlation between successive occurrences of extreme events due to long-term memory."}

This work introduces a degradation-aware design framework built around finite, interacting reservoirs (lithium, porosity, and electrolyte) that are depleted over time by coupled degradation processes.\n  We extend a physics-based Doyle-Fuller-Newman model to include validated mechanisms such as SEI growth, lithium plating, cracking, and solvent dry-out, and simulate how small design changes impact lifetime. Across more than 1,000 cycles, we find that increasing electrolyte volume by just 1% or porosity by 5% can extend service life by over 30% without significantly affecting cell energy density. However, lithium excess, while boosting initial capacity, can accelerate failure if not supported by sufficient structural or ionic buffers.\n  Importantly, we show that interaction between reservoirs is crucial to optimal design: multi-reservoir tuning yields either synergistic benefits or compound failures, depending on operating conditions. We also quantify how C-rate and operating temperature influence degradation pathways, emphasizing the need for co-optimized design and usage profiles.\n  By reframing degradation as a problem of managing finite internal reservoirs, this work offers a predictive and mechanistic foundation for designing lithium-ion batteries that balance energy, durability, and application-specific needs."}

The predicted stray-field noise power lies comfortably within the detection range of present-day solid-state defect magnetometry."}

Due to the through-space long-range dipolar interaction generically many spins are involved in the time evolution, so that exact brute force calculations are impossible. The recently established spin dynamic mean-field theory (spinDMFT) represents an efficient and unbiased alternative to overcome this challenge. The approach only requires the dipolar couplings as input and the only prerequisite for its applicability is that each spin interacts with a large number of other spins. In this article, we show that spinDMFT can be used to describe spectral spin diffusion in static samples and to simulate zero-quantum line shapes which eluded an efficient quantitative simulation so far to the best of our knowledge. We perform benchmarks for two test substances that establish an excellent match with published experimental data. As spinDMFT combines low computational effort with high accuracy, we strongly suggest to use it for large-scale simulations of spin diffusion, which are important in various areas of magnetic resonance."}

Motivated by the recent experimental realization of atomically thin gold layers and kagome goldene, we present a first-principles investigation of free-standing kagome monolayers of Cu, Ag, and Au. Using density functional theory combined with lattice dynamics and ab initio molecular dynamics, we systematically assess their structural, mechanical, dynamical, and thermal stability. All kagome monolayers satisfy the 2D Born criteria and exhibit relatively low in-plane stiffness compared to graphene and hexagonal goldene, reflecting the porous nature of the kagome lattice and its metallic bonding. Among the three systems, the Au-based lattice displays the highest in-plane Young's modulus. Phonon calculations reveal that the unstrained kagome phase is dynamically unstable for all metals. However, a moderate biaxial tensile strain of 5% stabilizes the Ag and Au monolayers, while Cu retains residual unstable modes. Finite-temperature simulations further show that Cu rapidly reconstructs toward a trigonal lattice, Ag remains metastable at low temperature but collapses at room temperature, and Au exhibits competing kagome and trigonal motifs at 300 K, indicating near-degeneracy between these phases. These results establish that strain engineering and atomic size are key determinants of the stability of metallic kagome monolayers and provide guidance for future substrate-supported realizations."}

Here, we extend Bloch's theorem to crystals under the strong light-matter coupling, showing that polariton quasiparticles preserve lattice periodicity. We formulate a general framework to incorporate the effect of multimode cavity fields in a simple and tractable way. We find that the additional modes contribute to the system's energy by small modifications that become noticeable only at low frequencies. Within the single-photon approximation the multimode contribution manifests as a spatially uniform effective field in the crystal's plane. This provides a formal justification for the single-mode and long-wavelength approximations commonly used in molecular polaritonics. This work establishes a rigorous theoretical framework that clarifies how polaritonic states in crystalline solids should be described."}

As a concrete example, we consider pairs of $e/2$-charged semions that arise from instanton configurations in a disordered zigzag graphene nanoribbon. These fractional charges, located on opposite zigzag edges, show long-range quantum entanglement despite being spatially separated. We analyze the scale dependence of their entanglement and embed the ribbon into an AdS-like bulk geometry. In this setup, the entanglement structure defines minimal surfaces in the bulk, providing a geometric view of the edge correlations.

In this study, building on previous work by the authors [1], we investigate how the dimensional characteristics of sinks influence solute concentration distributions and segregation behavior. Specifically, we utilize a kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) model to simulate atomic-scale diffusion and analyze segregation processes in an Fe-3Cr alloy. Our analysis includes three representative sink geometries: one-dimensional (1D), two-dimensional (2D), and three-dimensional (3D) planar sinks to capture the effects of sink dimensionality on Cr segregation at grain boundaries (GBs). We also found solutions of concentration and segregation profiles in these cases as well as for a 3D spherical sink. KMC simulations are performed over a range of temperatures to assess thermal effects on Cr redistribution. The results reveal distinct segregation profiles and concentration gradients, although the dependence with sink density seems to remain linear in all cases with planar sinks. The analytical results show that this is not the case in spherical domains, with a more complex dependence of segregation on sink density. Our finite difference solutions for domains including 2D and 3D planer sinks show agreement with corresponding KMC results."}

For nearest-neighbor hopping on a square lattice, we find that the electronic spectrum is significantly renormalized, with bandwidth and quasi-particle residue strongly decreasing with increasing electron density.

When grown using organometallic vapor-phase epitaxy, the dominant red emission from Eu exhibits an inhomogeneous photoluminescence (PL) spectrum due to contributions from several non-equivalent incorporation sites that can be distinguished with combined excitation emission spectroscopy. Energy transfer from the GaN bandgap to the majority site is inefficient, limiting the performance of GaN:Eu LEDs and resulting in an inhomogeneous emission spectrum dominated by disproportionate contributions from minority sites. In this work, we use site-selective spectroscopy to characterize the photoluminescence properties of delta-doped structures with alternating doped and undoped layers of varying thicknesses and demonstrate that they selectively enhance emission from the majority site when compared to uniformly-doped samples. Samples with 2-nm and 10-nm doped layers show much greater PL intensity per Eu concentration as well as more efficient energy transfer to the majority site, which are both highly desirable for creating power-efficient LEDs. Meanwhile, a sample with 1-nm doped layers shows emission only from the majority site, resulting in a narrow, homogeneous emission spectrum that is desirable for quantum technologies. This utilization of delta-doping has the potential to be broadly applicable for engineering desirable defect properties in rare-earth doped semiconductors."}

We show that time-reversal-even electric-type multipoles give rise to the dissipationless MO current, whereas time-reversal-odd magnetic-type multipoles generate dissipative MO current under an applied electric field. Complementing this macroscopic analysis, the linear-response calculations for a microscopic tight-binding model demonstrate how MO conductivities are activated by symmetry lowering, exemplified by the symmetry reduction from Oh to Th. Our results elucidate the symmetry distinctions between MO currents and spin currents, and provide insights into their experimental identification."}

Extensive studies have been performed to better understand its behavior under irradiation. Recent experiments of Rutherford backscattering spectrometry in channeling mode indicated a marked reduction in radiation damage in single-crystal tungsten samples irradiated by self-ions when the irradiation temperature was increased from room temperature to 800 K. However, the underlying mechanism for this damage reduction remains unclear. In this work, by combining Rutherford backscattering spectrometry in channeling mode and molecular dynamics simulations, we identify a pronounced surface effect at elevated temperatures, characterized by a significant reduction of dislocation density near the surface. We demonstrate how our unique analysis method can clearly resolve a dislocation-free zone and a transition region with suppressed defect density before reaching the bulk value. The strong surface effect at elevated temperatures is explained by considering the coherent drift motion of dislocation loops towards the surface, highlighting alternative perspectives on mitigating radiation damage by increasing dislocation mobility."}

This phase is particularly challenging to study numerically due to finite-size effects. By investigating the formation of long, isolated stripes, we offer a perspective complementary to typical finite-doping phase diagrams. We use the density-matrix renormalization group algorithm to extract the ground states of an 18-leg cylindrical strip geometry, making the diameter significantly wider than in previous works. This approach allows us to map out the range of possible stripe filling fractions on the electron versus hole-doped side. We find good agreement with established results, suggesting that the spread of filling fractions observed in the literature is governed by the physics of a single stripe. Taking a microscopic look at stripe formation, we reveal two separate regimes - a high-filling regime captured by a simplified squeezed-space model and a low-filling regime characterized by the structure of individual pairs of dopants. Thereby, we trace back the phenomenology of the striped phase to its microscopic constituents and highlight the different challenges for observing the two regimes in quantum simulation experiments."}

However, the benefits are often compromised by severe side reactions and dendrite growth, limiting their practical application. To mitigate these drawbacks, many studies have focused on high-concentration electrolytes to desolvate the Zn2+ solvation shell from water and to reduce the amount of free water. In this study, a methodology is proposed to achieve the benefits of highly concentrated electrolytes while using low salt concentrations. 5-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (5MP) was introduced as a safe and polar cosolvent capable of anchoring free water molecules through hydrogen bonding, enabled by its carbonyl and secondary amine groups. Additionally, by adding a co-salt containing a chaotropic ion, it is possible to disrupt the water network, enabling the development of high-performance aqueous Zn batteries. The synergy between anchoring water molecules and disrupting the overall water network proved to be an effective strategy for enhancing the overall Zn battery performance in a symmetric Zn cell, with lifetimes exceeding 2000 hours and 1400 hours at 1 C and 5 C, respectively. Analysis of the recovered Zn anode confirmed that the combination of 5MP and chaotropic ions enabled Zn deposition along the energetically favorable (002) plane, with no signs of surface dehydration observed by in situ Raman spectroscopy. Furthermore, long-term stability tests using a carbonyl-rich COF- and NaVO-based cathodes at various current densities further demonstrated the benefits of this approach. This work showcases the universality of a diluted electrolyte in combination with 5MP and chaotropic ions, bridging the gap between laboratory research and real-world applications."}

The exploration has been successfully guided by the paradigm of ideal flat Chern bands, which mimic Landau levels in both band topology and local quantum geometry. Yet, given the near-infinite possibilities for Bloch bands in lattices, it remains a major open question whether FQAH states can emerge in scenarios fundamentally different from this paradigm. Here we turn to a class of gapless flat bands, featuring divergent quantum geometry at singular band touching, non-integer Berry flux threading the Brillouin zone (BZ), and ill-defined band topology. Our exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group calculations unambiguously demonstrate FQAH phase that is virtually independent of the interaction strength, persisting from the weak-interaction to the strong-interaction limit. We find the stability of the FQAH states does not uniquely correlate with the singularity strength or the BZ-averaged quantum geometric fluctuations. Instead, the many-body topological order can adapt to the singular and fluctuating quantum geometric landscape by spontaneously developing an inhomogeneous carrier distribution, while its quenching accompanies the drop in the occupation-weighted Berry flux. Our work reveals a profound interplay between quantum geometry and many-body correlation, and significantly expands the design space for exploring FQAH effect and flat-band correlation phenomena in general."}

In the diffusive regime, the magnetoconductance is well described by the Hikami-Larkin-Nagaoka formalism, with the evolution of the WAL prefactor $α$ correlating with the band-inversion transition. Beyond the diffusive limit, transport crosses into variable-range hopping, accompanied by a striking reversal of magnetoconductance from negative to positive. The observed positive low-field magnetoconductance, its pronounced anisotropy, and its temperature evolution point to an orbital origin of the response. These features are naturally captured by incorporating the incoherent hopping mechanism of Raikh \\textit{et al.} together with wavefunction shrinkage, rather than by conventional quantum-correction frameworks. Our results provide a unified picture of how topology, spin-orbit coupling, and disorder collectively determine the full field-temperature magnetotransport landscape in this material class, establishing a clear experimental link between the topological phase transition and the onset of incoherent hopping-dominated conduction."}

In this study, building on previous work by the authors [1], we investigate how the dimensional characteristics of sinks influence solute concentration distributions and segregation behavior. Specifically, we utilize a kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) model to simulate atomic-scale diffusion and analyze segregation processes in an Fe-3Cr alloy. Our analysis includes three representative sink geometries: one-dimensional (1D), two-dimensional (2D), and three-dimensional (3D) planar sinks to capture the effects of sink dimensionality on Cr segregation at grain boundaries (GBs). We also found solutions of concentration and segregation profiles in these cases as well as for a 3D spherical sink. KMC simulations are performed over a range of temperatures to assess thermal effects on Cr redistribution. The results reveal distinct segregation profiles and concentration gradients, although the dependence with sink density seems to remain linear in all cases with planar sinks. The analytical results show that this is not the case in spherical domains, with a more complex dependence of segregation on sink density. Our finite difference solutions for domains including 2D and 3D planer sinks show agreement with corresponding KMC results."}

By employing high-pressure electrical transport, magnetoresistance, DC magnetic susceptibility, and X-ray diffraction measurements, we construct a detailed temperature-pressure phase diagram. At ambient pressure, MnBi8Te13 exhibits FM ordering with an easy-axis along the c-axis which is progressively suppressed under pressure and replaced by an antiferromagnetic (AFM) order. Density functional theory calculations predicted an evolution from FM to a G-type AFMg2 phase near 5 GPa. Above 16.6 GPa, a bulk SC state emerges with a maximum transition temperature ~6.8 K, as confirmed by resistance and magnetic susceptibility measurements. This pressure-induced SC may co-exist with another AFM dome that shows a weak anomaly in the transport data. In contrast, our work on MnBi6Te10 shows no SC up to 40 GPa. Indeed, in contrast to MnBi8Te13, the MnBi2Te4(Bi2Te3)n compounds with n < 3, didn't exhibit SC, highlighting the crucial role of Mn concentration in stabilizing SC. The observation of pressure-induced FM-AFM-SC transitions in MnBi8Te13 not only establishes it as a rare Mn-based SC but also provides a platform to study the interplay between magnetism, SC, and potentially nontrivial band topology in correlated magnetic materials."}

Using a newly developed IRAS setup optimised for dielectric single crystals, we investigate CO adsorption on the model single-atom catalyst Rh/Fe3O4(001). IRAS resolves three species: monocarbonyls at twofold coordinated Rh1 sites, monocarbonyls at fivefold coordinated Rh sites, and gem-dicarbonyls at twofold coordinated Rh1 sites. Under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions, Rh1CO monocarbonyl species dominate. Rh1(CO)2 gem-dicarbonyl formation is kinetically hindered and occurs predominantly through CO-induced dissociation of Rh2 dimers rather than sequential CO adsorption. The sequential-adsorption pathway to Rh1(CO)2 becomes accessible at millibar CO pressures as evidenced by near-ambient-pressure scanning tunnelling microscopy (NAP-STM). These findings validate the kinetic picture inferred from UHV measurements and computational modelling and link the UHV behaviour to that expected under realistic reaction conditions. Assignments of the vibrational frequencies to individual species rely on isotopic labelling, thermal treatments, and a review of previous SPM, XPS, and TPD data, supported by density functional theory (DFT)-based calculations. While theory provides qualitative insight, such as the instability of dicarbonyls on fivefold coordinated Rh atoms, it does not yet reproduce experimental frequencies quantitatively and is sensitive to the computational parameters, highlighting the need for robust experimental benchmarks.

When grown using organometallic vapor-phase epitaxy, the dominant red emission from Eu exhibits an inhomogeneous photoluminescence (PL) spectrum due to contributions from several non-equivalent incorporation sites that can be distinguished with combined excitation emission spectroscopy. Energy transfer from the GaN bandgap to the majority site is inefficient, limiting the performance of GaN:Eu LEDs and resulting in an inhomogeneous emission spectrum dominated by disproportionate contributions from minority sites. In this work, we use site-selective spectroscopy to characterize the photoluminescence properties of delta-doped structures with alternating doped and undoped layers of varying thicknesses and demonstrate that they selectively enhance emission from the majority site when compared to uniformly-doped samples. Samples with 2-nm and 10-nm doped layers show much greater PL intensity per Eu concentration as well as more efficient energy transfer to the majority site, which are both highly desirable for creating power-efficient LEDs. Meanwhile, a sample with 1-nm doped layers shows emission only from the majority site, resulting in a narrow, homogeneous emission spectrum that is desirable for quantum technologies. This utilization of delta-doping has the potential to be broadly applicable for engineering desirable defect properties in rare-earth doped semiconductors."}

Central to this behavior is the competition between extremely large mismatched molecular fields on the tetrahedral $A$-site and octahedral $B$-site sublattices and the single-ion anisotropy on the $B$-site.

TM incorporation is generally energetically favorable and induces lattice distortions that are strongly localized around the defect site, preserving the overall structural integrity of the host. Analysis of defect formation energies and electronic structure shows that, with the exception of Sc and Ti, CsPbI3 exhibits a strong resistance to deep trap formation. Most TM substitutions instead introduce resonant states that hybridize with the band edges, consistent with the defect-tolerant nature of the material. While these states can modify the band gap, they do not generate isolated mid-gap traps. The observed distortions arise from strain-driven Van Vleck modes governed by ionic-radius mismatch, electronegativity differences, and TM-I orbital overlap, with amplitudes that decay rapidly away from the defect. Spin-polarized calculations reveal significant TM-induced spin polarization on the ligands and, in some cases, on neighboring Pb atoms, reflecting variations in covalency and hybridization across the 3d series.

Previous studies have assumed a mirror symmetry $\\mathcal M$ between the two layers and focused on uniform and clean superconducting states. Here, we show that breaking this mirror symmetry via an applied displacement field can stabilize a pair-density-wave (PDW) superconductor, which is similar to the Fulde--Ferrell--Larkin--Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state, but at zero magnetic field. Based on a mean-field analysis of a model of $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital with an effective inter-layer attraction, we demonstrate that the PDW phase is robust over a wide range of displacement field, interlayer hopping strengths, and electron fillings. Finally, we analyze disorder effects on interlayer superconductivity within the first Born approximation. Based on symmetry considerations, we show that pairing is weaken by disorders which break the mirror symmetry, even with unbroken time reversal symmetry. Our results establish bilayer nickelate as a tunable platform for realizing finite-momentum pairing and for exploring generalized disorder effects."}

However, ultrafast nonequilibrium dynamics following optical preparation of valley-polarized states remain completely unexplored in these systems. Combining time- and angle-resolved extreme-ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy with time-dependent Boltzmann equation simulations, we investigate ultrafast valley polarization dynamics following polarization-controlled photoexcitation in SnSe. We show that selective excitation to valleys at global conduction minima yields nearly unity and time-independent valley polarization. In contrast, photoexcitation to the other valley channel leads to ultrafast decay and reversal of valley polarization on sub-picosecond timescales due to intervalley scattering mediated by strong electron-phonon coupling with an optical phonon mode. Our findings reveal strongly anisotropic and radically different nonequilibrium valley physics than in most common two-dimensional valleytronics materials."}

The exploration has been successfully guided by the paradigm of ideal flat Chern bands, which mimic Landau levels in both band topology and local quantum geometry. Yet, given the near-infinite possibilities for Bloch bands in lattices, it remains a major open question whether FQAH states can emerge in scenarios fundamentally different from this paradigm. Here we turn to a class of gapless flat bands, featuring divergent quantum geometry at singular band touching, non-integer Berry flux threading the Brillouin zone (BZ), and ill-defined band topology. Our exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group calculations unambiguously demonstrate FQAH phase that is virtually independent of the interaction strength, persisting from the weak-interaction to the strong-interaction limit. We find the stability of the FQAH states does not uniquely correlate with the singularity strength or the BZ-averaged quantum geometric fluctuations. Instead, the many-body topological order can adapt to the singular and fluctuating quantum geometric landscape by spontaneously developing an inhomogeneous carrier distribution, while its quenching accompanies the drop in the occupation-weighted Berry flux. Our work reveals a profound interplay between quantum geometry and many-body correlation, and significantly expands the design space for exploring FQAH effect and flat-band correlation phenomena in general."}

This work introduces a degradation-aware design framework built around finite, interacting reservoirs (lithium, porosity, and electrolyte) that are depleted over time by coupled degradation processes.\n  We extend a physics-based Doyle-Fuller-Newman model to include validated mechanisms such as SEI growth, lithium plating, cracking, and solvent dry-out, and simulate how small design changes impact lifetime. Across more than 1,000 cycles, we find that increasing electrolyte volume by just 1% or porosity by 5% can extend service life by over 30% without significantly affecting cell energy density. However, lithium excess, while boosting initial capacity, can accelerate failure if not supported by sufficient structural or ionic buffers.\n  Importantly, we show that interaction between reservoirs is crucial to optimal design: multi-reservoir tuning yields either synergistic benefits or compound failures, depending on operating conditions. We also quantify how C-rate and operating temperature influence degradation pathways, emphasizing the need for co-optimized design and usage profiles.\n  By reframing degradation as a problem of managing finite internal reservoirs, this work offers a predictive and mechanistic foundation for designing lithium-ion batteries that balance energy, durability, and application-specific needs."}

It is shown that the spin-momentum locking locally takes place in the quasicrystal, and electron motion and spin directions are tightly connected at each spatial position in the real space. As a result, the spin susceptibility is enhanced for both in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic fields in the presence of a Rashba-type spin-orbit interaction.

Interpolating AA with other quasiperiodic potentials reveals competing gap-opening mechanisms, ranging from AA-dominated gaps at small interpolation parameters to a robust half-filling gap generated by the competing disorders at large parameters.

Extensive studies have been performed to better understand its behavior under irradiation. Recent experiments of Rutherford backscattering spectrometry in channeling mode indicated a marked reduction in radiation damage in single-crystal tungsten samples irradiated by self-ions when the irradiation temperature was increased from room temperature to 800 K. However, the underlying mechanism for this damage reduction remains unclear. In this work, by combining Rutherford backscattering spectrometry in channeling mode and molecular dynamics simulations, we identify a pronounced surface effect at elevated temperatures, characterized by a significant reduction of dislocation density near the surface. We demonstrate how our unique analysis method can clearly resolve a dislocation-free zone and a transition region with suppressed defect density before reaching the bulk value. The strong surface effect at elevated temperatures is explained by considering the coherent drift motion of dislocation loops towards the surface, highlighting alternative perspectives on mitigating radiation damage by increasing dislocation mobility."}

However, the benefits are often compromised by severe side reactions and dendrite growth, limiting their practical application. To mitigate these drawbacks, many studies have focused on high-concentration electrolytes to desolvate the Zn2+ solvation shell from water and to reduce the amount of free water. In this study, a methodology is proposed to achieve the benefits of highly concentrated electrolytes while using low salt concentrations. 5-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (5MP) was introduced as a safe and polar cosolvent capable of anchoring free water molecules through hydrogen bonding, enabled by its carbonyl and secondary amine groups. Additionally, by adding a co-salt containing a chaotropic ion, it is possible to disrupt the water network, enabling the development of high-performance aqueous Zn batteries. The synergy between anchoring water molecules and disrupting the overall water network proved to be an effective strategy for enhancing the overall Zn battery performance in a symmetric Zn cell, with lifetimes exceeding 2000 hours and 1400 hours at 1 C and 5 C, respectively. Analysis of the recovered Zn anode confirmed that the combination of 5MP and chaotropic ions enabled Zn deposition along the energetically favorable (002) plane, with no signs of surface dehydration observed by in situ Raman spectroscopy. Furthermore, long-term stability tests using a carbonyl-rich COF- and NaVO-based cathodes at various current densities further demonstrated the benefits of this approach. This work showcases the universality of a diluted electrolyte in combination with 5MP and chaotropic ions, bridging the gap between laboratory research and real-world applications."}

Lighter lanthanide compounds Eu2In, Nd2In, and Pr2In undergo first-order magnetic transitions with negligible hysteresis and minimal lattice volume change and exhibit giant cryogenic magnetocaloric effects, while heavy lanthanide R2In compounds including Gd2In show second-order transitions with moderate magnetocaloric effect.

Using a newly developed IRAS setup optimised for dielectric single crystals, we investigate CO adsorption on the model single-atom catalyst Rh/Fe3O4(001). IRAS resolves three species: monocarbonyls at twofold coordinated Rh1 sites, monocarbonyls at fivefold coordinated Rh sites, and gem-dicarbonyls at twofold coordinated Rh1 sites. Under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions, Rh1CO monocarbonyl species dominate. Rh1(CO)2 gem-dicarbonyl formation is kinetically hindered and occurs predominantly through CO-induced dissociation of Rh2 dimers rather than sequential CO adsorption. The sequential-adsorption pathway to Rh1(CO)2 becomes accessible at millibar CO pressures as evidenced by near-ambient-pressure scanning tunnelling microscopy (NAP-STM). These findings validate the kinetic picture inferred from UHV measurements and computational modelling and link the UHV behaviour to that expected under realistic reaction conditions. Assignments of the vibrational frequencies to individual species rely on isotopic labelling, thermal treatments, and a review of previous SPM, XPS, and TPD data, supported by density functional theory (DFT)-based calculations. While theory provides qualitative insight, such as the instability of dicarbonyls on fivefold coordinated Rh atoms, it does not yet reproduce experimental frequencies quantitatively and is sensitive to the computational parameters, highlighting the need for robust experimental benchmarks. The spectroscopic fingerprints established here provide a reliable foundation for identifying Rh coordination environments in oxide-supported single-atom catalysts."}

Here, we extend Bloch's theorem to crystals under the strong light-matter coupling, showing that polariton quasiparticles preserve lattice periodicity. We formulate a general framework to incorporate the effect of multimode cavity fields in a simple and tractable way. We find that the additional modes contribute to the system's energy by small modifications that become noticeable only at low frequencies. Within the single-photon approximation the multimode contribution manifests as a spatially uniform effective field in the crystal's plane. This provides a formal justification for the single-mode and long-wavelength approximations commonly used in molecular polaritonics.

Adjusting solvent evaporation kinetics is postulated to recover efficiency. Yet, a comprehensive characterization of their effect, independently of other property-defining parameters, is lacking. Thus, the present objective is to isolate the influence of the solvent drying rate on solution-deposited organic active layer nanomorphologies and performances. To this end, a specially designed gas quenching technique is employed to fabricate PM6:Y6 donor-acceptor films under systematic variations of evaporation conditions. Using an extensive investigation protocol that combines insights from numerical simulations and experimental measurements, process-structure-performance relationships are unraveled. It is found that higher drying rates imply finer and more dispersed nanomorphologies with increased fractions of amorphous material. This enhances electric charge generation, thereby improving short-circuit current density and overall cell performance. The open-circuit voltage is also boosted under accelerated evaporation due to changes in the aggregation mode of the Y6 small molecule that induce higher effective bandgaps. The results demonstrate that the developed gas-quenching technique is a valuable tool for optimizing the performance of upscaled organic photovoltaics, as it is readily compatible with high-throughput equipment, such as roll-to-roll coating machines."}

The switching is governed by two main sources of current transients: i) spin currents pumped by the reference layer, and ii) spin-polarized currents due to non-equilibrium hot electrons excited by the laser pulse. In particular, an initial superdiffusive forward flow of electrons, polarized by the free layer, is generated. This drives parallel to antiparallel switching of the free layer through accumulation of minority spins at the reference layer. A diffusive backward flow of electrons, repolarized by the reference layer, follows the initial superdiffusive flow as the charge distribution re-equilibrates. Due to the pulse width-dependent asymmetric amplitudes of the forward and backward transients, the latter can drive antiparallel to parallel switching, and create multi-domain structures at higher laser fluences and longer pulses. The results obtained here are in agreement with experimental observations, providing a framework for self-consistent modelling of all-optical switching in metallic heterostructures."}

We analyze the scale dependence of their entanglement and embed the ribbon into an AdS-like bulk geometry.

Central to this behavior is the competition between extremely large mismatched molecular fields on the tetrahedral $A$-site and octahedral $B$-site sublattices and the single-ion anisotropy on the $B$-site. This creates a strong energetic anisotropy that locks the magnetic moment within each structural domain in place.

TM incorporation is generally energetically favorable and induces lattice distortions that are strongly localized around the defect site, preserving the overall structural integrity of the host. Analysis of defect formation energies and electronic structure shows that, with the exception of Sc and Ti, CsPbI3 exhibits a strong resistance to deep trap formation. Most TM substitutions instead introduce resonant states that hybridize with the band edges, consistent with the defect-tolerant nature of the material. While these states can modify the band gap, they do not generate isolated mid-gap traps. The observed distortions arise from strain-driven Van Vleck modes governed by ionic-radius mismatch, electronegativity differences, and TM-I orbital overlap, with amplitudes that decay rapidly away from the defect. Spin-polarized calculations reveal significant TM-induced spin polarization on the ligands and, in some cases, on neighboring Pb atoms, reflecting variations in covalency and hybridization across the 3d series. Together, these results establish a unified picture in which local structural response, electronic hybridization, and spin polarization jointly control the stability and electronic impact of TM defects in CsPbI3 , identifying dopants that are electronically benign or detrimental."}

At ambient pressure, MnBi8Te13 exhibits FM ordering with an easy-axis along the c-axis which is progressively suppressed under pressure and replaced by an antiferromagnetic (AFM) order. Density functional theory calculations predicted an evolution from FM to a G-type AFMg2 phase near 5 GPa. Above 16.6 GPa, a bulk SC state emerges with a maximum transition temperature ~6.8 K, as confirmed by resistance and magnetic susceptibility measurements. This pressure-induced SC may co-exist with another AFM dome that shows a weak anomaly in the transport data. In contrast, our work on MnBi6Te10 shows no SC up to 40 GPa. Indeed, in contrast to MnBi8Te13, the MnBi2Te4(Bi2Te3)n compounds with n < 3, didn't exhibit SC, highlighting the crucial role of Mn concentration in stabilizing SC.

However, ultrafast nonequilibrium dynamics following optical preparation of valley-polarized states remain completely unexplored in these systems. Combining time- and angle-resolved extreme-ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy with time-dependent Boltzmann equation simulations, we investigate ultrafast valley polarization dynamics following polarization-controlled photoexcitation in SnSe. We show that selective excitation to valleys at global conduction minima yields nearly unity and time-independent valley polarization. In contrast, photoexcitation to the other valley channel leads to ultrafast decay and reversal of valley polarization on sub-picosecond timescales due to intervalley scattering mediated by strong electron-phonon coupling with an optical phonon mode. Our findings reveal strongly anisotropic and radically different nonequilibrium valley physics than in most common two-dimensional valleytronics materials."}

They have also been used to demonstrate that information is trapped in the zero dimensional edge modes of topological insulators and superconductors, and does not become scrambled. Here we study scrambling in two dimensional topological models. In the bulk the butterfly velocity, the speed at which the out-of-time ordered correlator spreads, gains a directional dependence from the underlying lattice. Furthermore when there are chiral or helical edge modes present these cause a form of dynamical scarring. The information about an initial perturbation on the boundary of the system travels around the edge, carried by the edge modes, but is not scrambled over very long time scales. The direction and speed of the scars are given by the velocities of the linearly dispersing edge modes. We further show that these scars do not interact, passing through each other. We back up these results with analytical and numerical calculations on exemplary models."}

For nearest-neighbor hopping on a square lattice, we find that the electronic spectrum is significantly renormalized, with bandwidth and quasi-particle residue strongly decreasing with increasing electron density. On the other hand, damping and particle-hole asymmetry increase, while a polaronic continuum forms in the hole sector, below the single-particle band. Fermi liquid phenomenology applies only at low densities, where the system remains paramagnetic. At higher densities, we find a bad metal with strong magnetic correlations, indicating that the ground state is the Nagaoka ferromagnet at high densities and a stripe antiferromagnet at intermediate densities. Both in the paramagnetic and the ferromagnetic regimes, we observe a violation of Luttinger's theorem."}

This work introduces a degradation-aware design framework built around finite, interacting reservoirs (lithium, porosity, and electrolyte) that are depleted over time by coupled degradation processes.\n  We extend a physics-based Doyle-Fuller-Newman model to include validated mechanisms such as SEI growth, lithium plating, cracking, and solvent dry-out, and simulate how small design changes impact lifetime. Across more than 1,000 cycles, we find that increasing electrolyte volume by just 1% or porosity by 5% can extend service life by over 30% without significantly affecting cell energy density. However, lithium excess, while boosting initial capacity, can accelerate failure if not supported by sufficient structural or ionic buffers.\n  Importantly, we show that interaction between reservoirs is crucial to optimal design: multi-reservoir tuning yields either synergistic benefits or compound failures, depending on operating conditions. We also quantify how C-rate and operating temperature influence degradation pathways, emphasizing the need for co-optimized design and usage profiles.\n  By reframing degradation as a problem of managing finite internal reservoirs, this work offers a predictive and mechanistic foundation for designing lithium-ion batteries that balance energy, durability, and application-specific needs."}

Typically, the prediction of the kinetics of these events relies on Arrhenius laws, with exponentially distributed waiting times, and no correlations between successive occurrences. However, this description breaks down in the presence of long-term memory, as has been observed in the contexts of geophysical time series or protein dynamics. So far, existing analytical approaches do not quantify the correlations between rare events due to long-term memory. Here, for non-Markovian Gaussian processes, we determine analytically the impact of long-term memory on the distribution of first and second passage times to a rarely reached threshold. This distribution is non-exponential, thus going beyond the Arrhenius paradigm. We obtain an explicit expression for the covariance between the first and second passage times, and we predict how the mean time to the next extreme event depends on the previous passage time, illustrating the phenomenon of clustering of extreme events. These analytical results, validated through extensive stochastic simulations, shed lights on the strong correlation between successive occurrences of extreme events due to long-term memory."}

In disordered superconductors, spatial fluctuations in the superconducting gap can trap quasiparticles and modify their eigenspectrum. Since this spectrum plays a key role in quasiparticle dynamics, it must be carefully investigated. To this end, we introduce a toy model of a single trap. Specifically, we consider a shallow disk-shaped gap variation in a clean superconductor. Using a semiclassical approximation, we demonstrate the existence of multiple bound states and give the dependence of their number on the size and depth of the gap suppression. Extending our analysis beyond the semiclassical regime, in dimensions larger than one, we observe an infinite number of bound states very close to the gap edge, even for an arbitrarily small trap.

Adjusting solvent evaporation kinetics is postulated to recover efficiency. Yet, a comprehensive characterization of their effect, independently of other property-defining parameters, is lacking. Thus, the present objective is to isolate the influence of the solvent drying rate on solution-deposited organic active layer nanomorphologies and performances. To this end, a specially designed gas quenching technique is employed to fabricate PM6:Y6 donor-acceptor films under systematic variations of evaporation conditions. Using an extensive investigation protocol that combines insights from numerical simulations and experimental measurements, process-structure-performance relationships are unraveled. It is found that higher drying rates imply finer and more dispersed nanomorphologies with increased fractions of amorphous material. This enhances electric charge generation, thereby improving short-circuit current density and overall cell performance. The open-circuit voltage is also boosted under accelerated evaporation due to changes in the aggregation mode of the Y6 small molecule that induce higher effective bandgaps. The results demonstrate that the developed gas-quenching technique is a valuable tool for optimizing the performance of upscaled organic photovoltaics, as it is readily compatible with high-throughput equipment, such as roll-to-roll coating machines."}

By employing high-pressure electrical transport, magnetoresistance, DC magnetic susceptibility, and X-ray diffraction measurements, we construct a detailed temperature-pressure phase diagram. At ambient pressure, MnBi8Te13 exhibits FM ordering with an easy-axis along the c-axis which is progressively suppressed under pressure and replaced by an antiferromagnetic (AFM) order. Density functional theory calculations predicted an evolution from FM to a G-type AFMg2 phase near 5 GPa. Above 16.6 GPa, a bulk SC state emerges with a maximum transition temperature ~6.8 K, as confirmed by resistance and magnetic susceptibility measurements. This pressure-induced SC may co-exist with another AFM dome that shows a weak anomaly in the transport data. In contrast, our work on MnBi6Te10 shows no SC up to 40 GPa. Indeed, in contrast to MnBi8Te13, the MnBi2Te4(Bi2Te3)n compounds with n < 3, didn't exhibit SC, highlighting the crucial role of Mn concentration in stabilizing SC. The observation of pressure-induced FM-AFM-SC transitions in MnBi8Te13 not only establishes it as a rare Mn-based SC but also provides a platform to study the interplay between magnetism, SC, and potentially nontrivial band topology in correlated magnetic materials."}

Neutron spectroscopy reveals a large band splitting ($\\sim$ 60 meV) between two ferrimagnetic magnon branches, which is driven by site mixing between Co$^{2+}$ and Fe$^{3+}$ cations, and a significantly weaker magnetocrystalline anisotropy ($\\sim$ 3 meV). Central to this behavior is the competition between extremely large mismatched molecular fields on the tetrahedral $A$-site and octahedral $B$-site sublattices and the single-ion anisotropy on the $B$-site. This creates a strong energetic anisotropy that locks the magnetic moment within each structural domain in place. As a result of these differing energy scales, switching structural domains is energetically favored over a global spin reorientation under applied magnetic fields, and this is what amplifies the magnetostrictive nature of CoFe$_2$O$_4$."}

This phase is particularly challenging to study numerically due to finite-size effects. By investigating the formation of long, isolated stripes, we offer a perspective complementary to typical finite-doping phase diagrams. We use the density-matrix renormalization group algorithm to extract the ground states of an 18-leg cylindrical strip geometry, making the diameter significantly wider than in previous works. This approach allows us to map out the range of possible stripe filling fractions on the electron versus hole-doped side. We find good agreement with established results, suggesting that the spread of filling fractions observed in the literature is governed by the physics of a single stripe. Taking a microscopic look at stripe formation, we reveal two separate regimes - a high-filling regime captured by a simplified squeezed-space model and a low-filling regime characterized by the structure of individual pairs of dopants. Thereby, we trace back the phenomenology of the striped phase to its microscopic constituents and highlight the different challenges for observing the two regimes in quantum simulation experiments."}

In this study, we examine the dissociation of H$_2$ on a large octahedral Ag nanoshell under varying field intensity, frequency, and duration, and we explore the possibility of identifying optimal modeling conditions accessible with current TDDFT simulations. We show that using this large nanoshell that consists in the outer layer of the Ag$_{231}$ cluster, it is still possible to disentangle the role of the plasmon from strong-field effects at applied field intensities as high as $(2-8) \\times 10^{13}$ W cm$^{-2}$. In particular, although strong-field effects are always present at these intensities, we find that the excited plasmon dominates the dissociation process at the lowest applied intensity of $2 \\times 10^{13}$ W cm$^{-2}$. Furthermore, at the highest intensity, at which strong-field effects become dominant, the plasmon contributes to accelerating the dissociation of the molecule. Overall, our simulations pave the way to bridge the intensity gap between TDDFT modeling and experiments in plasmonic catalysis."}
