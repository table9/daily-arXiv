Past work on the theory underlying the diffusion approximation has often made use of asymptotic arguments; in the energy-dependent case, however, papers have appeared that differ substantially in their findings. Here we present a formal asymptotic derivation of the multigroup diffusion equation which addresses these differences, along with the varying and sometimes physically stringent assumptions employed in these works.\n  Further, we show a way to exactly invert the relationship between flux and current in the P1 approximation, giving a matricial expression for the multigroup diffusion coefficient which is formally exact, has clear physical meaning, and which can be easily computed to arbitrary precision on the basis of cross-section data already produced by lattice calculations. The resulting 2-group diffusion coefficient for an infinite medium of hydrogen is calculated with Monte Carlo, and compared to the those deriving from the Cumulative Migration Method and from the out-scatter approximation."}

Meanwhile, the dominant real-space EPC between Ru local $d_{x^2-y^2}$ states and the low-frequency Ru in-plane local $x$ branch remains nearly unchanged, indicating that the reduction of $λ$ originates from the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ DOS reduction and the overall phonon hardening.

One of the most powerful nano-imaging methods is X-ray ptychography, a coherent diffraction imaging technique that has become the go-to method at synchrotron facilities for applications ranging from brain imaging to battery materials. However, the requirements in terms of X-ray beam quality have limited its use to large synchrotron facilities and, to date, only one attempt has been made to translate the technique to a small-scale laboratory. To unleash the power of this technique to the broad user community of laboratory X-ray sources, there are outstanding questions to answer including whether the quantitativeness of the information is preserved in a laboratory despite the drastic decrease in X-ray flux of several orders of magnitude, with respect to synchrotron instruments. In this study not only we demonstrate that the quantitativeness of X-ray ptychography is preserved in a laboratory setting, but we also apply the method to the imaging of a brain tissue phantom. Finally, we describe the current challenges and limitations, and we set the basis for further development and future directions of quantitative nano-imaging with laboratory X-ray sources."}

In addition to hosting skyrmion phases, a hallmark of this class of materials is the appearance of numerous spin textures characterized by a superposition of multi-$q$ magnetic modulations: spin moiré superlattices. The nuanced energy landscape thus motivates detailed studies to understand the underlying interactions. Here, we comprehensively characterize and model the three zero-field magnetic textures present in one such material, EuAg$_4$Sb$_2$. Systematic symmetry breaking experiments using magnetic field and strain determine that the ground state incommensurate magnetic phase (ICM1) is single-$q$. In contrast, ICM2 and ICM3 are both double-$q$, \\textit{i.e.}, spin moiré superlattices. Further, through application of polarized small angle neutron scattering and spherical neutron polarimetry, we demonstrate that ICM1 is a single-$q$ cycloid and ICM2 and ICM3 are double-$q$ vortex lattices, with Eu moments lying in the $ab$-plane in zero field and with a ferromagnetic component at finite field. Despite the quasi-2D nature of EuAg$_4$Sb$_2$, the modulations propagate out of the \\textit{ab}-plane, leading to a shift of the spin texture between triangle lattice planes. Further, the ICM3 to ICM2 transition includes an unusual 45$^\\circ$ rotation of the magnetic vortex lattice. Motivated by the coexistence of such drastically different phases in this compound, we conclude by developing a phenomenological model to understand the stability of these states. Our experimental probes and theoretical modeling definitively characterize three different and tunable phases in one material, and provide insight for the design of new topological spin-texture materials."}

Two of the spin-charge ground states, respectively consists of three-site and six-site ferromagnetic (FM) clusters arranged in anti-FM and $120^{\\circ}$ Yafet-Kittel (YK) phase which we label as S-AF (super-antiferromagnet) and S-YK (super-YK) respectively.

We utilize and reinterpret classic concepts from electromagnetism in the setting of cyclical nonequilibrium processes. We show that the housekeeping heat can be controlled to be arbitrarily close to zero by minimizing nonequilibrium fluctuations. It immediately follows from our results that the constant-velocity angle clamp protocol applied to the $F_1$ molecular motor in a recent experiment [Mishima et at, 2025] is in fact the globally optimal protocol: it produces zero housekeeping heat and simultaneously minimizes dissipation and maximizes work transduction."}

Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carriers (LOHCs) provide a potential solution by enabling the reversible chemical binding and release of hydrogen. However, recent experimental studies have revealed a puzzling inhibition of catalytic activity during LOHC dehydrogenation, associated with the absence of hydrogen bubble formation, reduced hydrogen production rates and significant variability across experiments. In this work, we derive a model to elucidate the mechanisms underlying this inhibition, taking into account both the reversible nature of the hydrogenation-dehydrogenation reaction and the role of transport phenomena. Our results demonstrate that efficient transport of hydrogen away from the catalytic pellet is essential to suppress back-reactions and thereby maximize the performance of porous catalysts. In particular, we demonstrate that two distinct kinetic regimes - with high or strongly inhibited hydrogen production - can arise depending on whether bubble nucleation is enabled or suppressed. Beyond LOHC systems, our findings are applicable to a broader class of reversible reactions, particularly those involving volatile products that can leave the liquid reaction medium in form of bubbles."}

We show that Fe-pz molecules are stable on CrSBr while preserving its SCO bistability, particularly in densely packed molecular arrays. By patterning Fe-pz into periodic stripes separated by pristine CrSBr regions, the interface becomes a magnonic crystal that filters spin waves at selected frequencies. Crucially, light-driven excited spin-state trapping (LIESST) enables LS-HS switching and induces up to ~1.3% local strain in CrSBr, which in turn reshapes the magnonic band structure in a dynamic and reversible manner. These results establish Fe-pz@CrSBr as a switchable platform for on-chip, programmable magnonic devices."}

In this paper, we characterize the incommensurate phases accessible with field applied in the plane with small angle neutron scattering (SANS). A variety of phases with unusual SANS patterns are accessible with magnetic field applied along the $a$ and $a^*$ directions. Many of these phases can be understood to be multi-$q$ phases. One phase in particular, ICM2b (ICM=incommensurate magnetic phase), is rather unconventional in that it is an anisotropic multi-$q$ phase that can rotate freely within the $ab$-plane, dependent on magnetic field direction and history. The stabilization of tunable multi-$q$ incommensurate spin textures \\textit{via} in-plane field sets this class of materials apart from conventional skyrmion materials. We further identify that the propagation vectors of the in-plane phases have a significant commensuration with the diameter of the smallest pocket of the Fermi surface ($2k_{\\text{F}}$). The multi/single-$q$ nature is also correlated with the enhancement of resistivity, suggesting that a gap opens in the electron bands at $q=2k_{\\text{F}}$. We also compare with a phenomenological model of the phase diagram.

The coexistence of bands with Dirac points similar to those in graphene, along with a completely flat band, makes this an ideal structure for investigating how lattice symmetries may protect topological and many-body correlation effects. Since applied strain can break lattice symmetries and modify the electronic structure, understanding how strain influences phenomena such as the Kondo effect in kagome materials may provide essential insights into correlated-electron behavior. We employ the single-impurity Anderson model and the numerical renormalization group to analyze the Kondo effect in kagome zigzag nanoribbons under uniaxial strain. We find that strain manipulation enables precise control over the strength of the Kondo effect on an impurity hybridized on the ribbon with different coordination environments, and that symmetric local environments may result in strong suppression of the effective hybridization due to orbital interference. We find that the specific location of the impurity on the ribbon, especially when the Fermi energy lies close to weakly dispersive edge states, can lead to significant changes in the characteristic Kondo temperature. Such sensitivity may be used to provide unique information on the local density of states of a system. These results demonstrate that strain is a powerful tuning parameter in kagome nanoribbons, strongly modifying the screening of magnetic impurities."}

Exploiting an exchange symmetry in the equal-transmission regime, we reduce the dynamics to a lower-dimensional invariant subsystem and analyze the impact of the co-infection recovery rate. We prove that slower recovery of co-infected individuals monotonically increases the co-infection burden and yields a lower bound on epidemic duration that grows as the co-infection recovery rate decreases. Numerical simulations further indicate that reduced co-infection recovery can increase the epidemic peak, an effect supported by a sensitivity-equation analysis. Together, these results highlight how co-infection-specific recovery dynamics can substantially alter transient epidemic behavior, even in the absence of endemic equilibria."}

In addition to hosting skyrmion phases, a hallmark of this class of materials is the appearance of numerous spin textures characterized by a superposition of multi-$q$ magnetic modulations: spin moiré superlattices. The nuanced energy landscape thus motivates detailed studies to understand the underlying interactions. Here, we comprehensively characterize and model the three zero-field magnetic textures present in one such material, EuAg$_4$Sb$_2$. Systematic symmetry breaking experiments using magnetic field and strain determine that the ground state incommensurate magnetic phase (ICM1) is single-$q$. In contrast, ICM2 and ICM3 are both double-$q$, \\textit{i.e.}, spin moiré superlattices. Further, through application of polarized small angle neutron scattering and spherical neutron polarimetry, we demonstrate that ICM1 is a single-$q$ cycloid and ICM2 and ICM3 are double-$q$ vortex lattices, with Eu moments lying in the $ab$-plane in zero field and with a ferromagnetic component at finite field. Despite the quasi-2D nature of EuAg$_4$Sb$_2$, the modulations propagate out of the \\textit{ab}-plane, leading to a shift of the spin texture between triangle lattice planes. Further, the ICM3 to ICM2 transition includes an unusual 45$^\\circ$ rotation of the magnetic vortex lattice. Motivated by the coexistence of such drastically different phases in this compound, we conclude by developing a phenomenological model to understand the stability of these states. Our experimental probes and theoretical modeling definitively characterize three different and tunable phases in one material, and provide insight for the design of new topological spin-texture materials."}

Here, we put forward a chemical strategy to create locally tunable magnonic crystals by integrating switchable spin-crossover (SCO) molecules with 2D van der Waals magnets. Specifically, we investigate from first principles a hybrid molecular/2D heterostructure formed by [Fe((3,5-(CH3)2Pz)3BH)2] molecules (Fe-pz) deposited on a single-layer of semiconducting CrSBr. We show that Fe-pz molecules are stable on CrSBr while preserving its SCO bistability, particularly in densely packed molecular arrays. By patterning Fe-pz into periodic stripes separated by pristine CrSBr regions, the interface becomes a magnonic crystal that filters spin waves at selected frequencies. Crucially, light-driven excited spin-state trapping (LIESST) enables LS-HS switching and induces up to ~1.3% local strain in CrSBr, which in turn reshapes the magnonic band structure in a dynamic and reversible manner. These results establish Fe-pz@CrSBr as a switchable platform for on-chip, programmable magnonic devices."}

Although the research frontier has mostly shifted toward ultra-high pressure phases above 400 GPa, we show that even the broken symmetry phase observed around 130~GPa requires revisiting due to its intricate coupling of electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom. Here, we develop a first principle quantum Monte Carlo framework based on a deep neural network wave function that treats both electrons and nuclei quantum mechanically within the constant pressure ensemble. Our calculations reveal an unreported ground-state structure candidate for the broken symmetry phase with $Cmcm$ space group symmetry, and we test its stability up to 96 atoms. The predicted structure quantitatively matches the experimental equation of state and X-ray diffraction patterns. Furthermore, our group-theoretical analysis shows that the $Cmcm$ structure is compatible with existing Raman and infrared spectroscopic data. Crucially, static density functional theory calculation reveals the $Cmcm$ structure as a dynamically unstable saddle point on the Born-Oppenheimer potential energy surface, demonstrating that a full quantum many-body treatment of the problem is necessary. These results shed new light on the phase diagram of high-pressure hydrogen and call for further experimental verifications."}

While this property has been investigated in many weakly-correlated altermagnetic materials, the impact of strong electron-electron interactions on the spin-dependent electronic structure has remained little explored, particularly in metals. Here, we propose NiS2 as a prototypical strongly correlated metallic altermagnet. While at ambient pressure this compound is an altermagnetic Mott insulator, it undergoes a pressure-driven metal-insulator transition (MIT) while maintaining its altermagnetic ordered phase. By systematically comparing DFT, DFT+U, and DFT+DMFT calculations on the metallic altermagnetic phase near the MIT, we disentangle how strong static and dynamic correlations modify the electronic structure. Specifically, the spin splitting of the bands is modified not only through the enhancement of the local magnetic moment caused by static correlations, but also by the momentum-dependent bandwidth renormalization caused by dynamic correlations. Moreover, dynamic electronic correlations cause a pronounced lifetime asymmetry between the spin-up and spin-down quasiparticles, an effect that is amplified by the particle-hole asymmetry promoted by Hund's correlations. Our results not only shed light on the rich landscape of correlation effects in metallic altermagnets, but also establishes NiS2 as a platform to investigate the interplay between Mott and Hund physics and altermagnetic order."}

This model exhibits a continuous quantum transition (CQT) at $g=g_c$ and $h=0$, and first-order quantum transitions (FOQTs) driven by $h$ along the line $h=0$ ($g<g_c$). In the integrable limit $h=0$, the system can be mapped onto a quadratic fermionic theory; however, any nonvanishing longitudinal field breaks integrability and the spectrum of the resulting Hamiltonian is generally expected to enter a chaotic regime. We analyze QQs in which the longitudinal field is suddenly changed from a negative value $h_i < 0$ to a positive value $h_f>0$. We focus on values of $h_f$ such that the spectrum of the post-QQ Hamiltonian ${\\hat H}(g,h_f)$ lies in the chaotic regime, where thermalization may emerge at asymptotically long times.

In this paper, we characterize the incommensurate phases accessible with field applied in the plane with small angle neutron scattering (SANS). A variety of phases with unusual SANS patterns are accessible with magnetic field applied along the $a$ and $a^*$ directions. Many of these phases can be understood to be multi-$q$ phases. One phase in particular, ICM2b (ICM=incommensurate magnetic phase), is rather unconventional in that it is an anisotropic multi-$q$ phase that can rotate freely within the $ab$-plane, dependent on magnetic field direction and history. The stabilization of tunable multi-$q$ incommensurate spin textures \\textit{via} in-plane field sets this class of materials apart from conventional skyrmion materials. We further identify that the propagation vectors of the in-plane phases have a significant commensuration with the diameter of the smallest pocket of the Fermi surface ($2k_{\\text{F}}$). The multi/single-$q$ nature is also correlated with the enhancement of resistivity, suggesting that a gap opens in the electron bands at $q=2k_{\\text{F}}$. We also compare with a phenomenological model of the phase diagram.

The coexistence of bands with Dirac points similar to those in graphene, along with a completely flat band, makes this an ideal structure for investigating how lattice symmetries may protect topological and many-body correlation effects. Since applied strain can break lattice symmetries and modify the electronic structure, understanding how strain influences phenomena such as the Kondo effect in kagome materials may provide essential insights into correlated-electron behavior. We employ the single-impurity Anderson model and the numerical renormalization group to analyze the Kondo effect in kagome zigzag nanoribbons under uniaxial strain. We find that strain manipulation enables precise control over the strength of the Kondo effect on an impurity hybridized on the ribbon with different coordination environments, and that symmetric local environments may result in strong suppression of the effective hybridization due to orbital interference. We find that the specific location of the impurity on the ribbon, especially when the Fermi energy lies close to weakly dispersive edge states, can lead to significant changes in the characteristic Kondo temperature. Such sensitivity may be used to provide unique information on the local density of states of a system. These results demonstrate that strain is a powerful tuning parameter in kagome nanoribbons, strongly modifying the screening of magnetic impurities."}

Incorporating Ga into EuZn$_2$P$_2$ (EuZn$_{1.8}$Ga$_{0.2}$P$_2$) reduces the electrical resistivity, indicating enhanced free-carrier density and a narrowed semiconducting gap. ESR confirms the persistence of Eu$^{2+}$ moments while showing a crossover from a Lorentzian to a Dysonian lineshape, consistent with reduced skin depth, increased carrier density, and the emergence of diffusive contributions. Ga-substituted compound display pronounced negative magnetoresistance linked to magnetic-polaron formation. THz-TDS reveals strong low-frequency absorption and a notable enhancement of the Drude conductivity in the substituted material, together with an increased carrier scattering time and enhanced carrier-density--to--effective-mass ratio.

In this context, the quasi-one-dimensional type-III Weyl semimetal (TaSe$_4$)$_2$I undergoes a CDW transition at $T_{\\mathrm{CDW}} \\approx 263$~K, providing an exceptional platform to investigate correlated topological CDW states. Here, we uncover an additional hidden-order phase transition at $T^* \\sim 100$ K, well below the CDW onset, using low-frequency resistance noise spectroscopy, electrical transport, and thermoelectric measurements. This transition is characterized by a sharp enhancement in the noise exponent ($α$) and variance of resistance fluctuations. Analysis of higher-order statistics of resistance fluctuations reveals the correlated dynamics underlying the transition. A pronounced anomaly in the Seebeck coefficient near $T^*$ further suggests a Fermi surface reconstruction. First-principles calculations reveal a structural distortion from the high-symmetry $I422$ phase to a low-symmetry $C2$ phase, via an intermediate $I4$ symmetry. This leads to renormalization of the electronic structure near the Fermi level and opening of a bandgap in the hidden-order phase.

Weight change measurements, scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (SEM/EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used for high-temperature oxidation analyses, showing superior resistance with higher Pt contents. This was attributed to the creation of a denser, thinner, and more homogeneous layer of alumina (alpha-Al2O3) in the thermally-grown oxide (TGO) layer. On the contrary, an increase in Ru contents led to the development of other oxides and microcracks along with alumina in the TGO layer, undermining oxidation protection. The accommodation of Ti and Ta, in the minimally-deteriorative form of carbide, along with Y into the TGO layer with increasing Pt contents further enhanced oxidation resistance. In addition to the explored significant impact of the Pt/Ru ratio on oxide scale characteristics and oxidation resistance, the lower cost of Ru compared to Pt suggests the potential for designing cost-effective systems through optimized Pt/Ru ratios and microstructural engineering."}

By varying the chemical potential, superconducting order parameter, and twist angle, we explore the emergence of topological superconducting phases via the calculation of Chern numbers. Our phase diagrams for tBLG and tDBLG (both AB-AB and AB-BA stackings) reveal distinct topological transitions, which are consistently marked by bulk gap-closing points. To gain further insight, we analyze the evolution of Chern numbers by tracking the number and location of gap closings within the moiré Brillouin zone. Additionally, we illustrate representative squared amplitude of Bloch states corresponding to different topological phases. In the later part of our study, the effect of trigonal warping on the topological superconducting properties is also discussed. Beyond the quantitative results, our study highlights how the interplay between moiré band structure and unconventional pairing symmetries enriches the landscape of possible superconducting states in twisted graphene systems.

By evaluating the electrical and thermoelectric properties, it was clarified that this maximum is achieved by the superposition of two large contributions: S_1 arising from direct transverse electron conduction due to a temperature gradient, and S_2 resulting from the combined Seebeck and anomalous Hall effects. We discovered that the anomalous Nernst conductivity, which is attributed to Berry curvature, varied significantly with the transition metal, even in an amorphous material lacking long-range crystalline order.

While this property has been investigated in many weakly-correlated altermagnetic materials, the impact of strong electron-electron interactions on the spin-dependent electronic structure has remained little explored, particularly in metals. Here, we propose NiS2 as a prototypical strongly correlated metallic altermagnet. While at ambient pressure this compound is an altermagnetic Mott insulator, it undergoes a pressure-driven metal-insulator transition (MIT) while maintaining its altermagnetic ordered phase. By systematically comparing DFT, DFT+U, and DFT+DMFT calculations on the metallic altermagnetic phase near the MIT, we disentangle how strong static and dynamic correlations modify the electronic structure. Specifically, the spin splitting of the bands is modified not only through the enhancement of the local magnetic moment caused by static correlations, but also by the momentum-dependent bandwidth renormalization caused by dynamic correlations. Moreover, dynamic electronic correlations cause a pronounced lifetime asymmetry between the spin-up and spin-down quasiparticles, an effect that is amplified by the particle-hole asymmetry promoted by Hund's correlations. Our results not only shed light on the rich landscape of correlation effects in metallic altermagnets, but also establishes NiS2 as a platform to investigate the interplay between Mott and Hund physics and altermagnetic order."}

We establish several Raman spectral features that enable unambiguous phase identification across the series.

All the electrodeposited overlays demonstrated substantial enhancement in oxidation resistance. However, Pt exhibited the highest protection efficiency, Ru the least, and the Pt-Ru alloy provided an intermediate level of performance. Microscopic and X-ray diffraction analyses revealed that the competitive formation of protective α-Al2O3 and spinel NiAl2O4 phases on the coated surfaces played a crucial role in determining the oxidation resistance, driven by atomic interactions between the elements in the NiCoCrAlYTa bond coat and the overlay metals.

In this work, nitinol (NiTi) alloy was anodized in an electrolyte containing ethylene glycol, water, and sodium chloride in static and stirred electrolyte stages with the aim of removing the irregular surface array while achieving a thick NP layer. Electron micrographs showed that anodization in the static electrolyte provides a controlled thickness of NP layers covered by an irregular surface layer. In contrast, anodizing in the stirred electrolyte reduced the thickness and the degree of irregularity, which were controlled by the different kinetics of dissolution at the tops, perimeters and bottoms of NPs. To benefit simultaneously from the thickness and regularity of the oxide layers, two-stage anodizing under static and then stirred electrolyte conditions was found to be effective. Following a 30 min anodization in the static electrolyte, anodizing for 30 min under the stirred conditions provided the highest regularity in the oxide array, resulting in NPs of almost 40 nm and 11 μm in diameter and layer thickness, respectively. Two-stage anodizing under static then stirred electrolyte conditions is proposed in order to promote NP structures for applications demanding higher surface areas."}

So far, the separation of charge and spin currents was facilitated by the electrical spin injection from a ferromagnet (FM) or the injection by a relativistic spin Hall effect. The devices employed are lateral spin valves comprising spatially separated injection and detection electrodes, connected by a spin-propagation channel. The time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking FM spin injection is realized in a geometry with an electrical bias applied between the injection electrode and the channel and is modelled by a conserved spin-polarized drift current. In contrast, the spin injection by the T-symmetric relativistic spin Hall mechanism is driven by an electrical bias applied across the injection electrode alone, and is modelled by a non-conserved spin current transverse to the applied bias. In this work, we use a lateral spin valve with a Mn5Si3 injection electrode to directly demonstrate a TRS-breaking spin injection from a compensated magnet with a vanishing net magnetization. Specifically, the TRS-breaking is demonstrated by the fact that switching between time-reversed states of the compensated magnet changes the detected spin signal. Moreover, the TRS-breaking nature of the spin injection is observed in both experimental geometries with the different electrical biasing, while using the same detection electrode. We show that this unconventional spin-injection is consistent with different magnitudes and propagation angles of electrical currents in the spin-up and spin-down channel in a d-wave altermagnet. Here our symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations are based on the compensated collinear altermagnetic order which has provided a comprehensive microscopic interpretation of earlier structural, magnetic, and anomalous Hall and Nernst measurements in Mn5Si3 thin films."}

Our calculations reveal dramatic stacking-dependent band gap modulation from 0.08 to 0.76~eV, with the AB$'$ configuration being the most thermodynamically stable. All stackings exhibit robust mechanical stability with Young's moduli of 54.82-61.97~N/m and ductile behavior suitable for flexible electronics.

Although the research frontier has mostly shifted toward ultra-high pressure phases above 400 GPa, we show that even the broken symmetry phase observed around 130~GPa requires revisiting due to its intricate coupling of electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom. Here, we develop a first principle quantum Monte Carlo framework based on a deep neural network wave function that treats both electrons and nuclei quantum mechanically within the constant pressure ensemble. Our calculations reveal an unreported ground-state structure candidate for the broken symmetry phase with $Cmcm$ space group symmetry, and we test its stability up to 96 atoms. The predicted structure quantitatively matches the experimental equation of state and X-ray diffraction patterns. Furthermore, our group-theoretical analysis shows that the $Cmcm$ structure is compatible with existing Raman and infrared spectroscopic data. Crucially, static density functional theory calculation reveals the $Cmcm$ structure as a dynamically unstable saddle point on the Born-Oppenheimer potential energy surface, demonstrating that a full quantum many-body treatment of the problem is necessary. These results shed new light on the phase diagram of high-pressure hydrogen and call for further experimental verifications."}

However, the microscopic mechanisms governing VSC switching and its coupling to magnetic order, electronic structure, and quantum geometry remain elusive, with experimental evidence still lacking. Here, we present conclusive experimental evidence of temperature-driven VSC switching in an archetypal noncollinear antiferromagnetic manganese chromium nitride (Mn3CrN) epitaxial thin films. The VSC switching induces a concomitant quantum-geometric and Lifshitz transition, manifested through a pronounced peak in anomalous Hall conductivity remanence, a metal-insulator-like crossover in longitudinal resistivity, and a distinct evolution of x-ray magnetic circular dichroic signal. The reversal of VSC reconstructs the spin configuration, Fermi surface topology and Berry curvature, marking a unified magnetic-electronic-quantum geometric transition. This emergent behaviour, captured through magneto-transport and magneto-optic measurements, and supported by first-principles theory establish VSC as an active control knob for chirality-driven phase engineering and the design of multifunctional quantum devices."}

In this context, we perform systematic calculations of the BSE for the two-dimensional Hubbard model at half-filling at intermediate coupling. Our study illustrates how the divergence of a fundamental building block of the BSE in the charge channel, the two-particle irreducible vertex, systematically occurs at lower interactions than in the (purely local) DMFT case, due to short-range antiferromagnetic fluctuations. Further, the change of sign of the eigenvalues of the generalized charge susceptibility associated to the vertex divergences is identified as the essential prerequisite to drive, at larger interaction values, the physics of the Mott transition in two dimensions, as well as of the adjacent phase-separation instabilities."}

In this work, we systematically examine the CISS effect in such multichiral systems by designing a class of multilayer helical architectures constructed of stacked and interfaced individual helical rings, each possessing well-defined local chirality. Through controlled interlayer twisting, a global helical handedness is further imposed, forming a multichiral tubular helix. Theoretical calculations reveal that these two distinct chiral hierarchies lead to several unprecedented CISS phenomena, such as enhanced spin polarization arising from cooperative dual chirality, along with the simultaneous emergence of transverse and longitudinal CISS signals. Moreover, interlayer torsional competition modulates the system's response to external fields. The dual-chiral geometry breaks the conventional symmetry of single helices, inducing an anomalous angular phase shift in magnetoresistance. Furthermore, Floquet analysis reveals that the interplay between local and global chirality enables controlled spin polarization switching under circularly polarized light. These findings provide a basic theoretical framework for studying the CISS in multichiral superstructures and establish design principles for coupled optical, magnetic, and spin manipulations, thereby facilitating the development of multichiral spintronic devices."}

Such excitation commonly creates nanometer-scale domains, even after homogeneous illumination when the position of nucleated domains is not externally defined. However, the physics of domain localization during such ultrafast phase transitions remains unresolved. Here, we use shot-resolved pump-probe resonant x-ray scattering together with a material featuring a periodically modulated magnetic anisotropy landscape to track, in real time, the laser-driven nucleation and localization of nanometer-scale spin textures. We find that nucleation and localization are two distinct processes. Nucleation occurs homogeneously via fluctuations at early times, whereas spatially periodic structures emerge only later and, under suitable conditions, localize in less than one nanosecond. Real-space simulations show that this localization is governed by strong lateral variations in spin-texture lifetimes. Our results demonstrate that ultrafast phase-transition dynamics fundamentally differ from conventional transitions, yet still can be controlled through moderate nanometer-scale tailoring of the energy landscape."}

Today, this is typically achieved by incorporating doped OSC interlayers, introducing self-assembled dipole monolayers, or adding mobile ions to the active material (AM). Here, we demonstrate an alternative approach that eliminates the need for additional injection layers or ionic additives. We achieve this by blending the dipolar compound TMPE-OH into the electroluminescent polymer Super Yellow (SY) and depositing this sole AM between two air-stable electrodes, forming a single-layer, dipole-doped OLED (D-OLED). By tracking its transient voltage-luminance response, performing impedance spectroscopy, and comparing these characteristics with two other single-layer device concepts, i.e. a neat-SY OLED without a dipolar compound and a light-emitting electrochemical cell (LEC) containing mobile ions, we can establish that the auxiliary dipoles in the D-OLED reorient under the applied driving voltage, enabling immediate luminance turn-on and lowering the injection barriers at both electrodes. Finally, we demonstrate that the D-OLED achieves current efficacies comparable to those of SY OLEDs incorporating dedicated injection layers or LECs. Our study establishes dipolar doping as a practical strategy for efficient bipolar charge injection from air-stable electrodes in solution-processed organic semiconductor devices."}

The heavy-fermion quasiparticle is a bound state of a U(1) matter field carrying unit electric and U(1) gauge charge, and the fermionic parton. Using sign-problem-free determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we identify two symmetry-equivalent regimes: a heavy-fermion metal with a sharp composite-fermion resonance and robust low-frequency transport, and a Kondo-breakdown metal with an incoherent resonance and vanishing low-frequency transport. For any finite lattice extent in the direction perpendicular to the chain, the Luttinger volume of the heavy-fermion phase counts both composite and conduction electrons, while in the Kondo-breakdown phase it counts only the conduction electrons. The evolution of the composite-fermion spectrum, dynamical spin structure factor, and optical conductivity provides a nonperturbative demonstration of gauge-mediated Kondo breakdown and establishes transport fingerprints of an orbital-selective Mott transition in the context of U(1) gauge theories of heavy fermions."}

Recently, the idea of sub-symmetry-protected topology -- where some of the original symmetries are broken while a remaining subset, called sub-symmetries, continues to protect specific boundary states -- has been developed. Here, we extend sub-symmetry-protected topology to higher-order topological systems from second-order topological insulators to semimetals. By introducing a sub-symmetry-protecting perturbation that acts on a single sublattice and selectively preserves specific topological boundary states, we track the evolution of these states and their topological features using numerical and analytical methods, and we show that state-resolved quadrupole moments diagnose which corner or hinge modes remain topological. As a representative example of a second-order topological insulator, we begin with the Benalcazar-Bernevig-Hughes model. We demonstrate that, under a sub-symmetry-protecting perturbation, sub-symmetry-protected corner states remain pinned at zero energy and maintain quantized state-resolved quadrupole moments. In contrast, corner states on sub-symmetry-broken boundaries shift away from zero energy and lose their quantized character. We further extend this framework to a three-dimensional second-order topological semimetal, constructed by stacking second-order topological insulator layers, and analyze how second-order Fermi arc states -- hinge-localized modes that link the projections of bulk Dirac points, in contrast to conventional surface Fermi arcs -- evolve under a sub-symmetry-protecting perturbation. While one second-order Fermi arc becomes dispersive and loses its quadrupolar character under a sub-symmetry-breaking perturbation, the remaining second-order Fermi arcs retain chiral symmetry and preserve quantized quadrupolar characters."}

However, recent work on quantum material (QM) JJs - using Mott insulator Nb3Br8 - resulted in magnetic field-free non-reciprocal superconductivity, termed the Josephson diode effect (JDE), implying the QM's intrinsic properties can modulate superconductivity in non-trivial ways.

This was attributed to the creation of a denser, thinner, and more homogeneous layer of alumina (alpha-Al2O3) in the thermally-grown oxide (TGO) layer. On the contrary, an increase in Ru contents led to the development of other oxides and microcracks along with alumina in the TGO layer, undermining oxidation protection.

These remarkable properties rely on the stability of the SAF skyrmion's topological bound state, whose underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, using an atomistic spin model, we analyze the collapse pathways of bilayer SAF skyrmions in homochiral systems, where both ferromagnetic layers share the same Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) vectors, and in heterochiral systems, where the DMI vectors have opposite directions. We find that pair destruction occurs either by decoupling or by sequential collapse into the homogeneous antiferromagnetic state, so the activation energy is set by the smaller of these two barriers. By examining how these barriers vary with DMI strength, anisotropy, magnetic field, and interlayer exchange, we identify regimes of enhanced stability. In particular, increasing interlayer coupling strengthens homochiral skyrmions but weakens heterochiral ones, while reducing the anisotropy constant effectively stabilizes heterochiral SAF skyrmions. These results outline viable strategies to optimize SAF heterostructures for enhanced skyrmion stability in racetrack devices and emerging active skyrmionic systems."}

All the electrodeposited overlays demonstrated substantial enhancement in oxidation resistance. However, Pt exhibited the highest protection efficiency, Ru the least, and the Pt-Ru alloy provided an intermediate level of performance. Microscopic and X-ray diffraction analyses revealed that the competitive formation of protective α-Al2O3 and spinel NiAl2O4 phases on the coated surfaces played a crucial role in determining the oxidation resistance, driven by atomic interactions between the elements in the NiCoCrAlYTa bond coat and the overlay metals. Despite Ru's relatively lower oxidation resistance compared to Pt, its significantly lower cost offers potential advantages in cost-sensitive, high-temperature applications.

In this work, nitinol (NiTi) alloy was anodized in an electrolyte containing ethylene glycol, water, and sodium chloride in static and stirred electrolyte stages with the aim of removing the irregular surface array while achieving a thick NP layer. Electron micrographs showed that anodization in the static electrolyte provides a controlled thickness of NP layers covered by an irregular surface layer. In contrast, anodizing in the stirred electrolyte reduced the thickness and the degree of irregularity, which were controlled by the different kinetics of dissolution at the tops, perimeters and bottoms of NPs. To benefit simultaneously from the thickness and regularity of the oxide layers, two-stage anodizing under static and then stirred electrolyte conditions was found to be effective. Following a 30 min anodization in the static electrolyte, anodizing for 30 min under the stirred conditions provided the highest regularity in the oxide array, resulting in NPs of almost 40 nm and 11 μm in diameter and layer thickness, respectively. Two-stage anodizing under static then stirred electrolyte conditions is proposed in order to promote NP structures for applications demanding higher surface areas."}

Here, we demonstrate that an explicit Hubbard correction is unnecessary: the PBE functional correctly reproduces the AFM ground state while simultaneously improving the description of structural properties. Moreover, PBE provides a reliable account of the electronic structure. These findings clarify the role of correlation effects in CrOCl and identify PBE as a robust starting point for future ab initio studies of CrOCl-based materials."}

In this work, methylammonium-free perovskite absorbers were compositionally engineered to achieve band gaps of 1.55, 1.72, and 1.88 eV, enabling matching the spectral photoresponse with the indoor lighting. Devices based on a scalable mesoscopic n-i-p architecture were systematically evaluated under white LED illumination across correlated color temperatures (3000-5500 K) and light intensities from 250 to 1000 lux with active area of 1 cm2. The 1.72 eV composition exhibited the most promising performance across different light intensities and colors, achieving PCEs of 35.04 % at 1000 lux and 36.6 % at 250 lux, with a stable device operation of over 2000 hours. On the other hand, the 1.88 eV band-gap variant reached a peak PCE of 37.4 % under 250 lux (5500 K), however performance trade-offs were observed across the different color lights LEDs. Our combined experimental and theoretical optical-electrical simulations suggest that decreasing trap-assisted recombination in wide-bandgap compositions may further improve PIPV performance across the different illumination conditions. In contrast, devices with 1.55 eV band gap underperformed in such conditions due to suboptimal spectral overlap and utilization. These findings establish bandgap optimization and device architecture as key design principles for high-efficiency, stable PIPVs, advancing their integration into self-powered electronic systems and innovative indoor environments."}

However, the microscopic mechanisms governing VSC switching and its coupling to magnetic order, electronic structure, and quantum geometry remain elusive, with experimental evidence still lacking. Here, we present conclusive experimental evidence of temperature-driven VSC switching in an archetypal noncollinear antiferromagnetic manganese chromium nitride (Mn3CrN) epitaxial thin films. The VSC switching induces a concomitant quantum-geometric and Lifshitz transition, manifested through a pronounced peak in anomalous Hall conductivity remanence, a metal-insulator-like crossover in longitudinal resistivity, and a distinct evolution of x-ray magnetic circular dichroic signal. The reversal of VSC reconstructs the spin configuration, Fermi surface topology and Berry curvature, marking a unified magnetic-electronic-quantum geometric transition. This emergent behaviour, captured through magneto-transport and magneto-optic measurements, and supported by first-principles theory establish VSC as an active control knob for chirality-driven phase engineering and the design of multifunctional quantum devices."}

Thin films of CoFeB alloy are essential for the development of various spintronic devices. The crystallization mechanisms of CoFeB during the annealing process have been thoroughly investigated in earlier studies, demonstrating that boron diffuses from the amorphous film, allowing the remaining CoFe to form a body-centered cubic lattice. Here, a distinct transformation pathway in pulsed-laser-deposited amorphous Co40Fe40B20 films is revealed, where vacuum annealing drives the formation of a metastable tau-boride phase, (Co,Fe)23B6. Comprehensive structural characterization - combining X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and compositional analysis - proves that tau-boride forms with high crystalline quality and minimal boron loss. Following the transition from amorphous CoFeB films to crystalline (Co,Fe)23B6, an improvement of magnetic properties is observed, with corresponding increases in such values as saturation magnetization, coercivity, loop squareness, and average magnetic moment. The reproducible stabilization of a boron-rich metastable phase in CoFeB thin films expands the known crystallization landscape of this technologically important alloy system.

However, the point of transition remains a matter of debate. Here, we determine the dominant channel of energy transport through a nanoscale Cu layer as a function of its thickness. The energy rapidly transferred across Cu via hot electrons from a photo-excited Pt layer into a buried Ni detection layer translates into a rapid expansion of the Ni layer probed via ultrafast x-ray diffraction. The non-linear dependence of the Ni strain amplitude on the absorbed laser fluence indicates that the transport through Cu becomes more efficient with increasing fluence. This fluence-dependent transport efficiency is reproduced by a diffusive energy transport model and serves as a generally applicable experimental approach to distinguish diffusion from ballistic transport. Following this approach, we identify diffusive electronic energy transport to govern the spatial energy distribution for Cu layer thicknesses larger than twice the electronic inelastic mean free path."}

We vary the magnitude of these multipoles either by applying an appropriate constraint on the charge density or by varying a corresponding structural distortion mode, using two simple perovskite materials, SrCrO3 and LaVO3, as model systems. Our analysis indicates that in general the altermagnetic spin splitting is not exclusively determined by the lowest order nonzero magnetic multipole, but results from a superposition of contributions from different multipoles with comparable strength, suggesting the need for a multi-component order parameter to describe altermagnetism. We also discuss different measures to quantify the overall spin-splitting of a material, without relying on features that might be specific to only individual bands."}

Today, this is typically achieved by incorporating doped OSC interlayers, introducing self-assembled dipole monolayers, or adding mobile ions to the active material (AM). Here, we demonstrate an alternative approach that eliminates the need for additional injection layers or ionic additives. We achieve this by blending the dipolar compound TMPE-OH into the electroluminescent polymer Super Yellow (SY) and depositing this sole AM between two air-stable electrodes, forming a single-layer, dipole-doped OLED (D-OLED). By tracking its transient voltage-luminance response, performing impedance spectroscopy, and comparing these characteristics with two other single-layer device concepts, i.e. a neat-SY OLED without a dipolar compound and a light-emitting electrochemical cell (LEC) containing mobile ions, we can establish that the auxiliary dipoles in the D-OLED reorient under the applied driving voltage, enabling immediate luminance turn-on and lowering the injection barriers at both electrodes. Finally, we demonstrate that the D-OLED achieves current efficacies comparable to those of SY OLEDs incorporating dedicated injection layers or LECs. Our study establishes dipolar doping as a practical strategy for efficient bipolar charge injection from air-stable electrodes in solution-processed organic semiconductor devices."}

Here, the effect of substrate temperature on nucleation, growth, and homogenization of Ga-NPs thermally evaporated on GaAs is systematically analyzed using atomic force and scanning electron microscopies. An optimal 300-350 celsius degrees window yields narrowly dispersed, dense arrays, whereas higher temperatures enhance surface diffusion and desorption, producing larger, sparser, and morphologically relaxed (flattened) NPs. Temperature-dependent optical reflectance reveals localized surface plasmon resonances whose energies scale with NP size and aspect ratio, and a figure of merit combining density and size dispersion identifies intermediate temperatures as optimal, in agreement with increased plasmonic quality factors. In-situ post-deposition annealing demonstrates Ostwald ripening as the dominant high-temperature coarsening pathway and underscores the need for rapid cooling and oxide-shell stabilization to preserve homogeneity. Cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy and electron energy-loss spectroscopy confirm a core-shell architecture, quantify temperature-driven oxide thickening, and verify the liquid-metal nature of the Ga NPs core.

Experimentally, ${\\rm K_2Zr(PO_4)_2}$ is known to undergo a displacive-type phase transition from a non-ferroaxial to a ferroaxial phase. To identify the key microscopic ingredients driving this transition, we carry out a quantitative analysis combining density-functional theory calculations and symmetry-adapted closest Wannier analysis. As a result, we show that electric toroidal dipole, electric toroidal octupole, and electric hexadecapole, which belong to the same irreducible representation, make dominant contributions to the ferroaxial transition. In particular, we find that spinless electric toroidal octupoles, which originate from spin-independent off-diagonal real hopping between the $p$ orbitals on P and O atoms and between the $d$ orbitals on Zr atoms and $p$ orbitals on O atoms, provide the most significant contributions. Moreover, we explicitly analyze the orbital characters involved in the relevant hybridizations associated with these multipoles. We further show that the relativistic spin--orbit coupling has a negligible influence on the ferroaxial transition. These results demonstrate that spin-independent orbital hybridization between different orbitals on different atoms plays a crucial role in inducing the ferroaxial transition."}

Specifically, the crystal field effects on the lanthanide ion and crystal field splitting of otherwise degenerate energy levels causes dramatic changes in the orbital magnetic behavior and overall magnetic structure of these materials. The coupling of the highly anisotropic lanthanide ions' spins (with large spin-orbit couplings) to the spins of the Mn atoms, which are arrayed in a kagome lattice, engenders exotic topological phenomena. This combination of magnetic anisotropy and electronic topology motivates investigation into the magnetic excitations of these materials, which unlike the ground state magnetic structures of this family, have not been extensively studied. Herein, we use Brillouin light scattering to measure the magnon spectra of $LnMn_{6}Sn_{6}$ (Ln = Tb, Dy, and Ho). This work represents the first detailed and comparative study on the magnetic dynamics in these materials and reveals that the identity of the lanthanide ion strongly influences the magnon frequency and demonstrates a direct correlation between the lanthanide's magnetic anisotropy and the observed spin wave excitations. Quantitative analysis indicates that the lanthanide ion's anisotropy controls the magnon frequency, while its total angular momentum influences the material's gyromagnetic ratio. These findings suggest that lanthanide substitution provides a pathway for tuning magnon properties in this material family."}

Here, we propose a symmetry-allowed spin photovoltaic effect in two-dimensional (2D) altermagnetic semiconductors that enables predictable control of giant spin injection currents. Distinct from parity-time ($\\mathcal{PT}$)-antiferromagnets, Janus altermagnetic semiconductors generate not only shift current but also a unique injection current with spin momentum locked in a specific direction under linearly polarized light -- a mechanism absent in $\\mathcal{PT}$-antiferromagnets.

This model exhibits a continuous quantum transition (CQT) at $g=g_c$ and $h=0$, and first-order quantum transitions (FOQTs) driven by $h$ along the line $h=0$ ($g<g_c$). In the integrable limit $h=0$, the system can be mapped onto a quadratic fermionic theory; however, any nonvanishing longitudinal field breaks integrability and the spectrum of the resulting Hamiltonian is generally expected to enter a chaotic regime. We analyze QQs in which the longitudinal field is suddenly changed from a negative value $h_i < 0$ to a positive value $h_f>0$.

EBSD is a major technique for characterizing these microstructures, but acquiring large and statistically representative EBSD maps remains slow, costly, and often limited to small regions. In this work, we introduce InfinityEBSD, a diffusion-based method for generating monophase realistic EBSD maps of arbitrary size, conditioned on physically meaningful microstructural metrics. This approach supports two primary use cases: extending small experimental EBSD maps to arbitrary sizes, and generating entirely new maps directly from statistical descriptors, without any input map. Conditioning is achieved through eight microstructural descriptors, including grain size, grain perimeter, grain inertia ratio, coordination number and disorientation angle distribution, allowing the model to generate maps that are both visually realistic and physically interpretable. A patch-wise geometric extension strategy ensures spatial continuity across grains, enabling the model to produce large-scale EBSD maps while maintaining coherent grain boundaries and orientation transitions. The generated maps can also be exported as valid Channel Text Files (CTF) for immediate post-processing and analysis in software such as MTEX or simulation environments like DIGIMU. We quantitatively validate our results by comparing distributions of the guiding metrics before and after generation, showing that the model respects the statistical targets while introducing morphological diversity. InfinityEBSD demonstrates that diffusion models, guided by physical metrics, can bridge the gap between synthetic and realistic materials representation, paving the way for future developments such as 3D realistic microstructure generation from 2D data."}

This was attributed to the creation of a denser, thinner, and more homogeneous layer of alumina (alpha-Al2O3) in the thermally-grown oxide (TGO) layer. On the contrary, an increase in Ru contents led to the development of other oxides and microcracks along with alumina in the TGO layer, undermining oxidation protection. The accommodation of Ti and Ta, in the minimally-deteriorative form of carbide, along with Y into the TGO layer with increasing Pt contents further enhanced oxidation resistance.

In this work, nitinol (NiTi) alloy was anodized in an electrolyte containing ethylene glycol, water, and sodium chloride in static and stirred electrolyte stages with the aim of removing the irregular surface array while achieving a thick NP layer. Electron micrographs showed that anodization in the static electrolyte provides a controlled thickness of NP layers covered by an irregular surface layer. In contrast, anodizing in the stirred electrolyte reduced the thickness and the degree of irregularity, which were controlled by the different kinetics of dissolution at the tops, perimeters and bottoms of NPs. To benefit simultaneously from the thickness and regularity of the oxide layers, two-stage anodizing under static and then stirred electrolyte conditions was found to be effective. Following a 30 min anodization in the static electrolyte, anodizing for 30 min under the stirred conditions provided the highest regularity in the oxide array, resulting in NPs of almost 40 nm and 11 μm in diameter and layer thickness, respectively. Two-stage anodizing under static then stirred electrolyte conditions is proposed in order to promote NP structures for applications demanding higher surface areas."}

In addition to hosting skyrmion phases, a hallmark of this class of materials is the appearance of numerous spin textures characterized by a superposition of multi-$q$ magnetic modulations: spin moiré superlattices. The nuanced energy landscape thus motivates detailed studies to understand the underlying interactions. Here, we comprehensively characterize and model the three zero-field magnetic textures present in one such material, EuAg$_4$Sb$_2$. Systematic symmetry breaking experiments using magnetic field and strain determine that the ground state incommensurate magnetic phase (ICM1) is single-$q$. In contrast, ICM2 and ICM3 are both double-$q$, \\textit{i.e.}, spin moiré superlattices. Further, through application of polarized small angle neutron scattering and spherical neutron polarimetry, we demonstrate that ICM1 is a single-$q$ cycloid and ICM2 and ICM3 are double-$q$ vortex lattices, with Eu moments lying in the $ab$-plane in zero field and with a ferromagnetic component at finite field. Despite the quasi-2D nature of EuAg$_4$Sb$_2$, the modulations propagate out of the \\textit{ab}-plane, leading to a shift of the spin texture between triangle lattice planes. Further, the ICM3 to ICM2 transition includes an unusual 45$^\\circ$ rotation of the magnetic vortex lattice. Motivated by the coexistence of such drastically different phases in this compound, we conclude by developing a phenomenological model to understand the stability of these states. Our experimental probes and theoretical modeling definitively characterize three different and tunable phases in one material, and provide insight for the design of new topological spin-texture materials."}

An accurate ab initio description is therefore essential. Previous density-functional studies have shown that DFT+$U$ calculations may erroneously favor ferromagnetic order depending on the choice of parametrization, an issue that cannot be remedied by simply adjusting the value of $U$. Here, we demonstrate that an explicit Hubbard correction is unnecessary: the PBE functional correctly reproduces the AFM ground state while simultaneously improving the description of structural properties. Moreover, PBE provides a reliable account of the electronic structure. These findings clarify the role of correlation effects in CrOCl and identify PBE as a robust starting point for future ab initio studies of CrOCl-based materials."}

In this paper, we characterize the incommensurate phases accessible with field applied in the plane with small angle neutron scattering (SANS). A variety of phases with unusual SANS patterns are accessible with magnetic field applied along the $a$ and $a^*$ directions. Many of these phases can be understood to be multi-$q$ phases. One phase in particular, ICM2b (ICM=incommensurate magnetic phase), is rather unconventional in that it is an anisotropic multi-$q$ phase that can rotate freely within the $ab$-plane, dependent on magnetic field direction and history. The stabilization of tunable multi-$q$ incommensurate spin textures \\textit{via} in-plane field sets this class of materials apart from conventional skyrmion materials. We further identify that the propagation vectors of the in-plane phases have a significant commensuration with the diameter of the smallest pocket of the Fermi surface ($2k_{\\text{F}}$). The multi/single-$q$ nature is also correlated with the enhancement of resistivity, suggesting that a gap opens in the electron bands at $q=2k_{\\text{F}}$. We also compare with a phenomenological model of the phase diagram. The richness of phases revealed in this study hint at the frustrated nature of the incommensurate magnetism present in EuAg$_4$Sb$_2$ and motivate further probes of these phases and the origin of the stability of spin moiré superlattices.

While this property has been investigated in many weakly-correlated altermagnetic materials, the impact of strong electron-electron interactions on the spin-dependent electronic structure has remained little explored, particularly in metals. Here, we propose NiS2 as a prototypical strongly correlated metallic altermagnet. While at ambient pressure this compound is an altermagnetic Mott insulator, it undergoes a pressure-driven metal-insulator transition (MIT) while maintaining its altermagnetic ordered phase. By systematically comparing DFT, DFT+U, and DFT+DMFT calculations on the metallic altermagnetic phase near the MIT, we disentangle how strong static and dynamic correlations modify the electronic structure. Specifically, the spin splitting of the bands is modified not only through the enhancement of the local magnetic moment caused by static correlations, but also by the momentum-dependent bandwidth renormalization caused by dynamic correlations. Moreover, dynamic electronic correlations cause a pronounced lifetime asymmetry between the spin-up and spin-down quasiparticles, an effect that is amplified by the particle-hole asymmetry promoted by Hund's correlations. Our results not only shed light on the rich landscape of correlation effects in metallic altermagnets, but also establishes NiS2 as a platform to investigate the interplay between Mott and Hund physics and altermagnetic order."}

While the altermagnetic unit cell reconstructs the topological edge states in the strip geometry and leads to the emergence of Dirac points, the in-plane magnetic moments of AM can induce gaps at these points. In an open square geometry, corner modes emerge within these gaps, realizing higher-order topological states. We further verify that the induction of higher-order topology is applicable to all altermagnetic configurations constructed here on the Lieb lattice, and is most pronounced for AM by comparing with the other types of magnetism such as ferromagnetism and ferrimagnetism.

Our analysis reveals that the reactance becomes inductor-like at low frequency below the ferromagnetic resonance.

So far, the separation of charge and spin currents was facilitated by the electrical spin injection from a ferromagnet (FM) or the injection by a relativistic spin Hall effect. The devices employed are lateral spin valves comprising spatially separated injection and detection electrodes, connected by a spin-propagation channel. The time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking FM spin injection is realized in a geometry with an electrical bias applied between the injection electrode and the channel and is modelled by a conserved spin-polarized drift current. In contrast, the spin injection by the T-symmetric relativistic spin Hall mechanism is driven by an electrical bias applied across the injection electrode alone, and is modelled by a non-conserved spin current transverse to the applied bias. In this work, we use a lateral spin valve with a Mn5Si3 injection electrode to directly demonstrate a TRS-breaking spin injection from a compensated magnet with a vanishing net magnetization. Specifically, the TRS-breaking is demonstrated by the fact that switching between time-reversed states of the compensated magnet changes the detected spin signal. Moreover, the TRS-breaking nature of the spin injection is observed in both experimental geometries with the different electrical biasing, while using the same detection electrode. We show that this unconventional spin-injection is consistent with different magnitudes and propagation angles of electrical currents in the spin-up and spin-down channel in a d-wave altermagnet. Here our symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations are based on the compensated collinear altermagnetic order which has provided a comprehensive microscopic interpretation of earlier structural, magnetic, and anomalous Hall and Nernst measurements in Mn5Si3 thin films."}

Here, we develop a first principle quantum Monte Carlo framework based on a deep neural network wave function that treats both electrons and nuclei quantum mechanically within the constant pressure ensemble.

Our combined experimental and theoretical optical-electrical simulations suggest that decreasing trap-assisted recombination in wide-bandgap compositions may further improve PIPV performance across the different illumination conditions.

Thin films of CoFeB alloy are essential for the development of various spintronic devices. The crystallization mechanisms of CoFeB during the annealing process have been thoroughly investigated in earlier studies, demonstrating that boron diffuses from the amorphous film, allowing the remaining CoFe to form a body-centered cubic lattice. Here, a distinct transformation pathway in pulsed-laser-deposited amorphous Co40Fe40B20 films is revealed, where vacuum annealing drives the formation of a metastable tau-boride phase, (Co,Fe)23B6. Comprehensive structural characterization - combining X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and compositional analysis - proves that tau-boride forms with high crystalline quality and minimal boron loss. Following the transition from amorphous CoFeB films to crystalline (Co,Fe)23B6, an improvement of magnetic properties is observed, with corresponding increases in such values as saturation magnetization, coercivity, loop squareness, and average magnetic moment. The reproducible stabilization of a boron-rich metastable phase in CoFeB thin films expands the known crystallization landscape of this technologically important alloy system.

The energy rapidly transferred across Cu via hot electrons from a photo-excited Pt layer into a buried Ni detection layer translates into a rapid expansion of the Ni layer probed via ultrafast x-ray diffraction. The non-linear dependence of the Ni strain amplitude on the absorbed laser fluence indicates that the transport through Cu becomes more efficient with increasing fluence. This fluence-dependent transport efficiency is reproduced by a diffusive energy transport model and serves as a generally applicable experimental approach to distinguish diffusion from ballistic transport. Following this approach, we identify diffusive electronic energy transport to govern the spatial energy distribution for Cu layer thicknesses larger than twice the electronic inelastic mean free path."}

As a consequence, conflicting reports have emerged on both their electronic phase transitions and lattice dynamics. In this work, we perform a comparative study of the phononic and electronic Raman responses of high-quality ML-TL single crystals and contrast them with those of other RP nickelates, using samples with optimized oxygen content. We establish several Raman spectral features that enable unambiguous phase identification across the series. Moreover, we uncover characteristics in the phononic and electronic Raman response of ML-TL that are not reflected in the pure ML and TL compounds. We attribute these differences to a distinctive electronic structure arising from self-doping and confinement effects induced by the ML unit within the ML-TL lattice architecture."}

Magnetic multipoles such as octupoles or triakontadipoles have been suggested as potential ferroic order parameters for d- and g-wave altermagnetism, respectively, based mainly on qualitative symmetry arguments. We use first-principles-based electronic structure calculations to establish a clear quantitative relation between the strength of the altermagnetic spin splitting and the magnitude of certain local multipoles. We vary the magnitude of these multipoles either by applying an appropriate constraint on the charge density or by varying a corresponding structural distortion mode, using two simple perovskite materials, SrCrO3 and LaVO3, as model systems. Our analysis indicates that in general the altermagnetic spin splitting is not exclusively determined by the lowest order nonzero magnetic multipole, but results from a superposition of contributions from different multipoles with comparable strength, suggesting the need for a multi-component order parameter to describe altermagnetism. We also discuss different measures to quantify the overall spin-splitting of a material, without relying on features that might be specific to only individual bands."}

In this work, we systematically examine the CISS effect in such multichiral systems by designing a class of multilayer helical architectures constructed of stacked and interfaced individual helical rings, each possessing well-defined local chirality. Through controlled interlayer twisting, a global helical handedness is further imposed, forming a multichiral tubular helix. Theoretical calculations reveal that these two distinct chiral hierarchies lead to several unprecedented CISS phenomena, such as enhanced spin polarization arising from cooperative dual chirality, along with the simultaneous emergence of transverse and longitudinal CISS signals. Moreover, interlayer torsional competition modulates the system's response to external fields. The dual-chiral geometry breaks the conventional symmetry of single helices, inducing an anomalous angular phase shift in magnetoresistance. Furthermore, Floquet analysis reveals that the interplay between local and global chirality enables controlled spin polarization switching under circularly polarized light. These findings provide a basic theoretical framework for studying the CISS in multichiral superstructures and establish design principles for coupled optical, magnetic, and spin manipulations, thereby facilitating the development of multichiral spintronic devices."}

Here, we use shot-resolved pump-probe resonant x-ray scattering together with a material featuring a periodically modulated magnetic anisotropy landscape to track, in real time, the laser-driven nucleation and localization of nanometer-scale spin textures. We find that nucleation and localization are two distinct processes. Nucleation occurs homogeneously via fluctuations at early times, whereas spatially periodic structures emerge only later and, under suitable conditions, localize in less than one nanosecond. Real-space simulations show that this localization is governed by strong lateral variations in spin-texture lifetimes.

Here, the effect of substrate temperature on nucleation, growth, and homogenization of Ga-NPs thermally evaporated on GaAs is systematically analyzed using atomic force and scanning electron microscopies. An optimal 300-350 celsius degrees window yields narrowly dispersed, dense arrays, whereas higher temperatures enhance surface diffusion and desorption, producing larger, sparser, and morphologically relaxed (flattened) NPs. Temperature-dependent optical reflectance reveals localized surface plasmon resonances whose energies scale with NP size and aspect ratio, and a figure of merit combining density and size dispersion identifies intermediate temperatures as optimal, in agreement with increased plasmonic quality factors. In-situ post-deposition annealing demonstrates Ostwald ripening as the dominant high-temperature coarsening pathway and underscores the need for rapid cooling and oxide-shell stabilization to preserve homogeneity. Cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy and electron energy-loss spectroscopy confirm a core-shell architecture, quantify temperature-driven oxide thickening, and verify the liquid-metal nature of the Ga NPs core.

Recently, the idea of sub-symmetry-protected topology -- where some of the original symmetries are broken while a remaining subset, called sub-symmetries, continues to protect specific boundary states -- has been developed. Here, we extend sub-symmetry-protected topology to higher-order topological systems from second-order topological insulators to semimetals. By introducing a sub-symmetry-protecting perturbation that acts on a single sublattice and selectively preserves specific topological boundary states, we track the evolution of these states and their topological features using numerical and analytical methods, and we show that state-resolved quadrupole moments diagnose which corner or hinge modes remain topological. As a representative example of a second-order topological insulator, we begin with the Benalcazar-Bernevig-Hughes model. We demonstrate that, under a sub-symmetry-protecting perturbation, sub-symmetry-protected corner states remain pinned at zero energy and maintain quantized state-resolved quadrupole moments. In contrast, corner states on sub-symmetry-broken boundaries shift away from zero energy and lose their quantized character. We further extend this framework to a three-dimensional second-order topological semimetal, constructed by stacking second-order topological insulator layers, and analyze how second-order Fermi arc states -- hinge-localized modes that link the projections of bulk Dirac points, in contrast to conventional surface Fermi arcs -- evolve under a sub-symmetry-protecting perturbation. While one second-order Fermi arc becomes dispersive and loses its quadrupolar character under a sub-symmetry-breaking perturbation, the remaining second-order Fermi arcs retain chiral symmetry and preserve quantized quadrupolar characters."}

Although the research frontier has mostly shifted toward ultra-high pressure phases above 400 GPa, we show that even the broken symmetry phase observed around 130~GPa requires revisiting due to its intricate coupling of electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom. Here, we develop a first principle quantum Monte Carlo framework based on a deep neural network wave function that treats both electrons and nuclei quantum mechanically within the constant pressure ensemble. Our calculations reveal an unreported ground-state structure candidate for the broken symmetry phase with $Cmcm$ space group symmetry, and we test its stability up to 96 atoms. The predicted structure quantitatively matches the experimental equation of state and X-ray diffraction patterns. Furthermore, our group-theoretical analysis shows that the $Cmcm$ structure is compatible with existing Raman and infrared spectroscopic data. Crucially, static density functional theory calculation reveals the $Cmcm$ structure as a dynamically unstable saddle point on the Born-Oppenheimer potential energy surface, demonstrating that a full quantum many-body treatment of the problem is necessary. These results shed new light on the phase diagram of high-pressure hydrogen and call for further experimental verifications."}

Specifically, the crystal field effects on the lanthanide ion and crystal field splitting of otherwise degenerate energy levels causes dramatic changes in the orbital magnetic behavior and overall magnetic structure of these materials. The coupling of the highly anisotropic lanthanide ions' spins (with large spin-orbit couplings) to the spins of the Mn atoms, which are arrayed in a kagome lattice, engenders exotic topological phenomena. This combination of magnetic anisotropy and electronic topology motivates investigation into the magnetic excitations of these materials, which unlike the ground state magnetic structures of this family, have not been extensively studied. Herein, we use Brillouin light scattering to measure the magnon spectra of $LnMn_{6}Sn_{6}$ (Ln = Tb, Dy, and Ho). This work represents the first detailed and comparative study on the magnetic dynamics in these materials and reveals that the identity of the lanthanide ion strongly influences the magnon frequency and demonstrates a direct correlation between the lanthanide's magnetic anisotropy and the observed spin wave excitations. Quantitative analysis indicates that the lanthanide ion's anisotropy controls the magnon frequency, while its total angular momentum influences the material's gyromagnetic ratio. These findings suggest that lanthanide substitution provides a pathway for tuning magnon properties in this material family."}

In this context, we perform systematic calculations of the BSE for the two-dimensional Hubbard model at half-filling at intermediate coupling. Our study illustrates how the divergence of a fundamental building block of the BSE in the charge channel, the two-particle irreducible vertex, systematically occurs at lower interactions than in the (purely local) DMFT case, due to short-range antiferromagnetic fluctuations.

Here we combine EPR spectroscopy, transient photoluminescence, and first-principles calculations to examine how diazo-coupled anisole, diphenylamine (DPA), and N,N-dimethylaniline (NNDMA) groups modify the photophysics of UiO-66-NH$_2$. All donor units introduce new occupied states near the valence-band edge, enabling charge separation through dye-to-framework electron transfer. Among them, the anisole-modified material stands out for facilitating efficient intersystem crossing into a triplet charge-transfer configuration that suppresses fast recombination and yields long-lived charge carriers detectable by photo-EPR. Meanwhile, bulkier donors such as DPA and NNDMA - despite their stronger electron-donating character - also tend to introduce defect-associated trap states. These results underscore the interplay between donor-induced electronic-structure changes, triplet pathways, and defect-mediated recombination, offering a mechanistic basis for tuning photocatalytic response in D-$π$-A-modified MOFs."}

These fitted models yield parameters such as the activation energy, and can be used to extrapolate to temperatures outside the measured range. Researchers frequently face challenges in this analysis: quantifying the uncertainty of fitted parameters, assessing whether the data quality is sufficient to support a particular empirical model, and using these models to predict behaviour at extrapolated temperatures. Bayesian methods offer a coherent framework that addresses all of these challenges. This tutorial introduces the use of Bayesian methods for analysing temperature-dependent transport data, covering parameter estimation, model selection, and extrapolation with uncertainty propagation, with illustrative examples from molecular dynamics simulations of superionic materials."}

With this formulation of the Kondo lattice, we study a spin chain coupled to two-dimensional Dirac conduction electrons. The spin chain is described by fermionic partons carrying spin and U(1) gauge charge. The heavy-fermion quasiparticle is a bound state of a U(1) matter field carrying unit electric and U(1) gauge charge, and the fermionic parton. Using sign-problem-free determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we identify two symmetry-equivalent regimes: a heavy-fermion metal with a sharp composite-fermion resonance and robust low-frequency transport, and a Kondo-breakdown metal with an incoherent resonance and vanishing low-frequency transport. For any finite lattice extent in the direction perpendicular to the chain, the Luttinger volume of the heavy-fermion phase counts both composite and conduction electrons, while in the Kondo-breakdown phase it counts only the conduction electrons. The evolution of the composite-fermion spectrum, dynamical spin structure factor, and optical conductivity provides a nonperturbative demonstration of gauge-mediated Kondo breakdown and establishes transport fingerprints of an orbital-selective Mott transition in the context of U(1) gauge theories of heavy fermions."}

Particles interact via an Ising Hamiltonian and phase separation occurs at low temperature. We drive the system out of equilibrium by imposing a temperature field that varies spatially on macroscopic scales while preserving local equilibrium. Under these conditions, the usual low-temperature long-range order is replaced by robust convection patterns, featuring regularly spaced stripe structures for suitable geometries. These nonequilibrium states differ markedly from those obtained in an equilibrium dynamics with the same local temperature profile. We develop a macroscopic description that captures these behaviors and provides a unified framework for understanding the observed patterns."}

Recent advances in controlling light-matter systems have opened new avenues to explore non-Hermitian effects arising from dissipative coupling, such as level attraction and anomalous dispersions. In this work, we perform a parametric study of these effects in a polariton system, i.e., a light-matter superposition, under both dissipative and coherent coupling. We characterize the effects of different sources of non-Hermitian behavior and analytically identify the conditions for the emergence of negative effective mass, exceptional points, and bound states in the continuum as a function of the light-matter detuning, the coherent-to-dissipative coupling ratio, and the relative decay rate of the non-interacting subsystems. We also analyze the classical limit of the polariton system within a non-Hermitian framework, employing coherent states."}

EBSD is a major technique for characterizing these microstructures, but acquiring large and statistically representative EBSD maps remains slow, costly, and often limited to small regions. In this work, we introduce InfinityEBSD, a diffusion-based method for generating monophase realistic EBSD maps of arbitrary size, conditioned on physically meaningful microstructural metrics. This approach supports two primary use cases: extending small experimental EBSD maps to arbitrary sizes, and generating entirely new maps directly from statistical descriptors, without any input map. Conditioning is achieved through eight microstructural descriptors, including grain size, grain perimeter, grain inertia ratio, coordination number and disorientation angle distribution, allowing the model to generate maps that are both visually realistic and physically interpretable. A patch-wise geometric extension strategy ensures spatial continuity across grains, enabling the model to produce large-scale EBSD maps while maintaining coherent grain boundaries and orientation transitions. The generated maps can also be exported as valid Channel Text Files (CTF) for immediate post-processing and analysis in software such as MTEX or simulation environments like DIGIMU. We quantitatively validate our results by comparing distributions of the guiding metrics before and after generation, showing that the model respects the statistical targets while introducing morphological diversity. InfinityEBSD demonstrates that diffusion models, guided by physical metrics, can bridge the gap between synthetic and realistic materials representation, paving the way for future developments such as 3D realistic microstructure generation from 2D data."}

Menezes", "Clecio C. de Souza Silva"], "title": "Stability of (Active) Bilayer Skyrmions in Synthetic Antiferromagnets", "comment": null, "summary": "Synthetic antiferromagnetic (SAF) skyrmions are nanoscale composite textures that exhibit high-speed, Hall-free current-driven motion and recently demonstrated self-propulsion. These remarkable properties rely on the stability of the SAF skyrmion's topological bound state, whose underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, using an atomistic spin model, we analyze the collapse pathways of bilayer SAF skyrmions in homochiral systems, where both ferromagnetic layers share the same Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) vectors, and in heterochiral systems, where the DMI vectors have opposite directions. We find that pair destruction occurs either by decoupling or by sequential collapse into the homogeneous antiferromagnetic state, so the activation energy is set by the smaller of these two barriers. By examining how these barriers vary with DMI strength, anisotropy, magnetic field, and interlayer exchange, we identify regimes of enhanced stability. In particular, increasing interlayer coupling strengthens homochiral skyrmions but weakens heterochiral ones, while reducing the anisotropy constant effectively stabilizes heterochiral SAF skyrmions. These results outline viable strategies to optimize SAF heterostructures for enhanced skyrmion stability in racetrack devices and emerging active skyrmionic systems."}

Theoretical models of polarons have only recently been extended to the excited state. Experimental measurements of polaron formation and transport have been widely undertaken across a range of materials, from photocatalysts and superconductors to soft conducting polymers. Here, we map experimental measurements of quantities such as polaron strength onto phase diagrams of the Holstein, Hubbard-Holstein, and t-J-Holstein models. This work demonstrates that tuning electron-phonon coupling strength, electron localization, and spin exchange can be leveraged to suppress or control polaron formation in transition metal oxides. We find that the t-J-Holstein model best describes the measured iron oxides and could be generally applied to a wide range of systems that exhibit polaron formation in the excited state. This work combines experimental data with ground state models to provide a robust parameter space for informing photoexcited polaron design."}
