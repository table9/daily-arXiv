These limitations become more severe at higher static fields, where operating frequencies increase and current distributions are governed by surface impedance and electromagnetic coupling in the near field. In this work we develop a theoretical framework that incorporates topological-insulator (TI) surface transport and spintronic interface physics into RF coil electrodynamics. Starting from the Dirac surface Hamiltonian and linear-response (Kubo/Drude) transport, we derive an effective complex surface impedance for TI-coated conductors and establish modified boundary conditions for tangential fields in the presence of spin--momentum locking and spin--charge coupling. We then analyze time-reversal-symmetry-breaking TI/ferromagnet interfaces, where an anomalous Hall surface conductivity produces antisymmetric admittance and enables nonreciprocal RF response. Finally, we connect these results to MRI metrics including coil quality factor, thermal noise, and receive sensitivity through reciprocity-based formulations. The framework identifies parameter regimes in which topological and spintronic surface transport could reduce RF dissipation, modify noise mechanisms, and enable coil-level nonreciprocity without conventional ferrites."}

However, direct experimental observations of interfacial thermal conductance across molecular junctions have remained challenging due to the high spatiotemporal resolution required for probing. Here, we report dynamic energy transport processes across multi-component molecular junctions observed at the atomic level by employing reflection ultrafast electron diffraction. A clear temporal sequence of energy transfer is revealed at early times following photoexcitation of Au(111) surfaces chemically bonded with self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of alkanethiols: from the gold surface layer (SL) to the head groups of a SAM and then to the CH2-CH2 methylene lattice. Remarkably, the structural dynamics of the gold SL differ significantly from those of clean gold. Furthermore, the methylene lattice dynamics exhibit chain-length insensitivity but with a length-dependent retention time to reach full thermalization. Quantitatively, we find an agreement in the increased out-of-plane atomic motions between the surface gold atoms and the SAM methylene units, signifying the nature of motion-based coupling for interfacial energy transport. High interfacial thermal conductance (~300 MW/m^2/K) and high thermal conductivity for the methylene lattice (~60 W/m/K) are obtained under the condition of impulsive heating, which provide strong support for previous room-temperature theoretical predictions and also the ballistic nature of intrachain heat transfer. This time- and spatially-resolved experimental approach will enable future quantitative assessment of interfacial energy transport across solid-molecule junctions."}

For a Lennard-Jones solvent, we demonstrate that this approach yields acceptable accuracy in estimating free energy differences for challenging transformations, such as solute growth or increased solute-solute separation, which typically demand multiple intermediate simulation steps along the transformation. Analysis of radial distribution functions indicates that the flow generates physically meaningful solvent rearrangements, substantially enhancing configurational overlap between states in configuration space. These results suggest flow-based models as a promising alternative to traditional free energy estimation methods."}

The method was chosen for its ability to yield crack paths that are independent of the underlying mesh, thanks to the damage regularization zone. In dynamics, we observe a progressive widening of this regularization zone and attribute it to an unphysical trapping of elastic waves. We show that the damage zones do not represent free boundaries accurately and that wave interactions induce additional damage. We reveal how mass erosion, by conserving the elastic wave speed in the damaged regions, can be used to efficiently reduce the spurious diffusion of damage. Furthermore, we provide numerical evidence that dynamically propagating cracks in the phase-field formulation, both with and without mass erosion, converge to the predictions of linear elastic fracture mechanics.

Molecule-intercalated TaS2 superlattices have recently been reported to host such states, yet their origin remains debated, underscoring the urgent need for controlled, device-integrated studies. Here, we report that nanometer-thick TaS2 and NbSe2 intercalated with chiral and achiral organic cations instead exhibit robust monolayer-like Ising superconductivity, with no evidence of unconventional pairing. Using high-quality superlattices integrated into devices, we disentangle the roles of interlayer coupling and charge transfer in shaping their superconducting behavior. In TaS2, intercalation induces interlayer decoupling regardless of molecular size or symmetry, yielding monolayer-like Ising superconductivity. NbSe2 instead retains quasi-three-dimensional transport, with a gradual Ising enhancement and near-monolayer behavior only at the largest interlayer spacing. Transport remains reciprocal across all superlattices, consistent with preserved inversion symmetry and incompatible with parity-breaking superconductivity and noncentrosymmetric monolayers. We attribute the behavior to electronically detached monolayers with opposite spin-split bands, coupled through thermal and tunneling processes, which overall preserve inversion symmetry. These findings establish molecular intercalation compounds as a robust, device-ready, platform for engineering advanced superconducting superlattices."}

Specifically, electron crystals stabilized by longrange Coulomb interactions may host collective vibrational excitations emerging from electron correlations10, termed electronic phonons, which are fundamentally distinct from atomic lattice phonons. Despite theoretical prediction of their existence in moiré electron crystals11, direct experimental evidence has remained elusive. Here we report the observation of electronic phonons in the Mott insulating and stripe phases of a WS2/WSe2 moiré superlattice, achieved through light scattering measurements. The phonon energies, temperature and filling factor dependencies, along with theoretical modeling, corroborate their origin as collective vibrations of a correlated electron crystal. Polarization-resolved measurements further indicate rotational symmetry breaking in the Mott state. Notably, these electronic phonons exhibit strong tunability in energy, intensity, and polarization under external electric or magnetic fields, highlighting rich and controllable lattice dynamics of the electron crystal.

In silicon-germanium (SiGe) heterostructures, the problem can be addressed by the design of the epitaxial layer stack. Several heuristic strategies have been proposed to enhance the energy gap between the two nearly degenerate valley states in strained Si/SiGe quantum wells (QWs), e.g., sharp Si/SiGe interfaces, Ge spikes or oscillating Ge concentrations within the QW. In this work, we develop a systematic variational optimization approach to compute optimal Ge concentration profiles that boost selected properties of the intervalley coupling matrix element. Our free-shape optimization approach is augmented by a number of technological constraints to ensure feasibility of the resulting epitaxial profiles. The method is based on an effective-mass-type envelope-function theory accounting for the effects of strain and compositional alloy disorder. Various previously proposed heterostructure designs are recovered as special cases of the constrained optimization problem. Our main result is a novel heterostructure design we refer to as the \"modulated wiggle well,\" which provides a large deterministic enhancement of the valley splitting along with a reliable suppression of the disorder-induced volatility. In addition, our new design offers a wide-range tunability of the valley splitting ranging from about 200 $μ$eV to above 1 meV controlled by the vertical electric field, which offers new perspectives to engineer switchable qubits with on-demand adjustable valley splitting."}

We here derive conditions on external time-dependent drivings, under which current reversals occur in lattice gases with arbitrary pair interactions. Our derivation is based on particle-hole symmetry and shows that current reversals must emerge if the time-varying driving potential changes sign after a translation in time and/or space. Our treatment includes nonstationary dynamics and time-dependent spatially averaged currents in nonequilibrium steady states. It gives insight also into possible occurrences of current reversals in continuous-space dynamics, which we demonstrate for hardcore interacting particles driven across a periodic potential by a traveling wave."}

We also discuss current limitations and open challenges. Together, these minimal, physics-guided design rules suggest that incorporating long-range electrostatics into MLIPs is simpler and perhaps more broadly applicable than is commonly assumed."}

Here, using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), we discover a lattice-decoupled rotatable stripe-like charge order coexisting with superconductivity in 2M-WS2. The charge order manifests five distinct orientations across different sample regions, yet maintains an identical wavelength. This directional decoupling from host lattice challenges existing paradigms. First-principles calculations of phonon spectra and nesting function fail to explain the ordering mechanism. Intriguingly, the transition temperature of the charge orders exhibits spatial variations (21-46 K), coinciding with the temperature range of the recently reported strange metal phase in this material. This correlation suggests that the interplay between strong electronic correlations and electron-phonon coupling must be critically evaluated to elucidate the emergence of this unconventional charge order."}

We introduce a benchmark that heuristically proposes criteria based on chemically grounded metrics to classify the suitability of a molecule for using quantum computing and then quantifies the impact of active space choices across the VQE pipeline for quantum drug discovery. The suite covers several representative drug-like molecules (e.g., lovastatin, oseltamivir, morphine) and uses chemically motivated active spaces.

Molecule-intercalated TaS2 superlattices have recently been reported to host such states, yet their origin remains debated, underscoring the urgent need for controlled, device-integrated studies. Here, we report that nanometer-thick TaS2 and NbSe2 intercalated with chiral and achiral organic cations instead exhibit robust monolayer-like Ising superconductivity, with no evidence of unconventional pairing. Using high-quality superlattices integrated into devices, we disentangle the roles of interlayer coupling and charge transfer in shaping their superconducting behavior. In TaS2, intercalation induces interlayer decoupling regardless of molecular size or symmetry, yielding monolayer-like Ising superconductivity. NbSe2 instead retains quasi-three-dimensional transport, with a gradual Ising enhancement and near-monolayer behavior only at the largest interlayer spacing. Transport remains reciprocal across all superlattices, consistent with preserved inversion symmetry and incompatible with parity-breaking superconductivity and noncentrosymmetric monolayers. We attribute the behavior to electronically detached monolayers with opposite spin-split bands, coupled through thermal and tunneling processes, which overall preserve inversion symmetry. These findings establish molecular intercalation compounds as a robust, device-ready, platform for engineering advanced superconducting superlattices."}

To capture this behavior, we develop a continuum approximation that incorporates higher-order dispersive and nonreciprocal effects and provides accurate analytical predictions across all relevant time scales. Building on this framework, we then demonstrate the existence of a non-Hermiticity-induced jump - an abrupt spatial shift of the wave-packet center even in the absence of disorder - and derive its underlying analytical foundation. The analytical predictions are in excellent agreement with direct numerical simulations of the Hatano-Nelson chain.

Recent spectroscopic investigations suggest that self-trapping occurs in Sb2S3, limiting the open-circuit voltage (Voc) to a maximum of approximately 800 mV, which is the level the field has asymptotically approached. In this work, we surpass this voltage barrier through reductions in the defect density in Sb2S3 thin films by modulating the growth mechanism in chemical bath deposition using citrate ligand additives. Deep level transient spectroscopy identifies two deep traps 0.4-0.7 eV above the valence band maximum, and, through first-principles calculations, we identify these to likely be S vacancies, or Sb on S anti-sites. The concentrations of these traps are lowered by decreasing the grain boundary density from 1114+/-52 nm/um2 to 585+/-10 nm/um2, and we achieve a Voc of 824 mV, the record for Sb2S3 solar cells. This work addresses the debate in the field around whether Sb2S3 is limited by defects or self-trapping, showing that it is possible to improve the performance towards the radiative limit through careful defect engineering."}

In silicon-germanium (SiGe) heterostructures, the problem can be addressed by the design of the epitaxial layer stack. Several heuristic strategies have been proposed to enhance the energy gap between the two nearly degenerate valley states in strained Si/SiGe quantum wells (QWs), e.g., sharp Si/SiGe interfaces, Ge spikes or oscillating Ge concentrations within the QW. In this work, we develop a systematic variational optimization approach to compute optimal Ge concentration profiles that boost selected properties of the intervalley coupling matrix element. Our free-shape optimization approach is augmented by a number of technological constraints to ensure feasibility of the resulting epitaxial profiles. The method is based on an effective-mass-type envelope-function theory accounting for the effects of strain and compositional alloy disorder. Various previously proposed heterostructure designs are recovered as special cases of the constrained optimization problem. Our main result is a novel heterostructure design we refer to as the \"modulated wiggle well,\" which provides a large deterministic enhancement of the valley splitting along with a reliable suppression of the disorder-induced volatility.

Existing deep learning approaches, such as Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), face computational challenges as dimensionality increases, driven by the $O(D^2)$ complexity of automatic differentiation for second-order derivatives. While recent probability flow approaches bypass this by learning score functions or matching velocity fields, they often involve serial computational operations or depend on sampling efficiency in complex distributions. To address these issues, we propose the Self-Consistent Probability Flow (SCPF) method. We reformulate the second-order FP equation into an equivalent first-order deterministic Probability Flow ODE (PF-ODE) constraint. Unlike score matching or velocity matching, SCPF solves this problem by minimizing the residual of the PF-ODE continuity equation, which avoids explicit Hessian computation. We leverage Continuous Normalizing Flows (CNF) combined with the Hutchinson Trace Estimator (HTE) to reduce the training complexity to linear scale $O(D)$, achieving an effective $O(1)$ wall-clock time on GPUs. To address data sparsity in high dimensions, we apply a generative adaptive sampling strategy and theoretically prove that dynamically aligning collocation points with the evolving probability mass is a necessary condition to bound the approximation error. Experiments on diverse benchmarks -- ranging from anisotropic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) processes and high-dimensional Brownian motions with time-varying diffusion terms, to Geometric OU processes featuring non-Gaussian solutions -- demonstrate that SCPF effectively mitigates the CoD, maintaining high accuracy and constant computational cost for problems up to 100 dimensions."}

Using atomistic simulations that capture quantum finite-size and nonlocal effects in the nonlinear plasmonic response of graphene and phosphorene nanoribbon dimers, we reveal how symmetry and inter-ribbon coupling shape harmonic generation processes in perturbative and high-harmonic regimes. Independent tuning of geometry and carrier density in nanoribbon heterostructures is shown to induce inter-ribbon plasmon hybridization, impacting inversion symmetry governing even-ordered nonlinear processes like second-harmonic generation. These results reveal design principles for active and passive tuning of nonlinear plasmonic effects and enable selective enhancement of specific harmonic processes, establishing 2D heterostructures as a versatile platform for nonlinear nanophotonics."}

Recent spectroscopic investigations suggest that self-trapping occurs in Sb2S3, limiting the open-circuit voltage (Voc) to a maximum of approximately 800 mV, which is the level the field has asymptotically approached. In this work, we surpass this voltage barrier through reductions in the defect density in Sb2S3 thin films by modulating the growth mechanism in chemical bath deposition using citrate ligand additives. Deep level transient spectroscopy identifies two deep traps 0.4-0.7 eV above the valence band maximum, and, through first-principles calculations, we identify these to likely be S vacancies, or Sb on S anti-sites. The concentrations of these traps are lowered by decreasing the grain boundary density from 1114+/-52 nm/um2 to 585+/-10 nm/um2, and we achieve a Voc of 824 mV, the record for Sb2S3 solar cells. This work addresses the debate in the field around whether Sb2S3 is limited by defects or self-trapping, showing that it is possible to improve the performance towards the radiative limit through careful defect engineering."}

We formulate the OUQ problem under general subdomain moment constraints and develop a high-performance computational framework to compute the optimal bounds. This approach transforms the original infinite-dimensional optimization problems into finite-dimensional unconstrained ones parameterized solely by free canonical moments. To address the prohibitive cost of PoF evaluation in high-dimensional settings, we incorporate inverse transform sampling (ITS), enabling efficient and accurate PoF estimation within the OUQ optimization. We also demonstrate that constraining inputs only by zeroth-order moments over subdomains yields a formulation equivalent to evidence theory. Three groups of numerical examples demonstrate the framework's effectiveness and scalability. Results show that increasing the number of subdomains or the moment order systematically tightens the bound interval. For high-dimensional problems, the ITS strategy reduces computational costs by up to two orders of magnitude while maintaining relative error below 1%.

Here, we demonstrate a simple and direct method to generate a superconducting 2DEG on KTaO3(111) using Mg-induced surface reduction in molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE). Mg has an extremely low sticking coefficient at elevated temperatures, enabling the formation of an ultrathin (less than 1-2 monolayers) MgO layer that is transparent to soft x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). This allows direct measurement of the surface chemistry and low-energy electronic structure of the pristine reduced surface without the need for a several-nanometer-thick capping layer. XPS shows clear reduction of Ta5+ to lower oxidation states, while ARPES reveals a parabolic Ta 5d conduction band with an approximately 150 meV bandwidth and additional subband features arising from quantum confinement. Transport measurements confirm a superconducting transition below 0.6 K.

Despite a few decades of research, a comprehensive and systematic rigorous characterisation of their spatial and, even more, time dependent properties has remained elusive. Among the obstacles, we can mention their out of equilibrium and non-linear dynamics features which prevent, in general, the access to the stationary properties explicitly. In fact, even the knowledge of the stationary state is quite exceptional in sandpiles. In that respect, it has become standard to develop a model to model strategy and, so to say, general results or tools applicable to these systems are missing. In this paper, we unveil general and simple properties of time transport correlations in certain classes of abelian sandpile models. We proceed gradually, starting from results applicable in a broad context, to more and more specific ones, consequently valid to smaller and smaller classes. For instance, we show, under a few hypothesis, that the number of particles dissipated displays mostly anticorrelation in time. Besides, on a more integrable point of view, the approach followed might culminate with the proof of a link between 2-points time transport correlations and the second moment of the integrated transport over time. To be clear, these two quantities are related through a linear system of equations which is explicitly solved and applies to at least three 1D sandpile models, namely the Directed Stochastic Sandpile, the Oslo and the Activated Random Walk (in a peculiar setup) models."}

For a Lennard-Jones solvent, we demonstrate that this approach yields acceptable accuracy in estimating free energy differences for challenging transformations, such as solute growth or increased solute-solute separation, which typically demand multiple intermediate simulation steps along the transformation.

Strong correlation becomes the recommended medicine. We point out that strong correlation can be mitigated by allowing DFT to lower the energy by breaking structural, magnetic or dipolar symmetries. Such local motifs are observed experimentally by local probes beyond the 'average structure' determined by X-Ray diffraction. Observed broken symmetries can arise from slow fluctuations that persist over the observation time or longer. The surprising fact is that when symmetry breaking motifs are used as input to electronic structure calculations, false metals are converted into real insulators without the recommended medicine of strong correlation. Consistently, DFT calculations that show energy lowering symmetry breaking correct most cases where DFT, even with advanced exchange-correlation functionals, previously missed the correct metal vs insulator designation. Total energy calculations distinguish systems that support energy-lowering symmetry breaking from those that do not. This approach distinguishes between paramagnetic insulating and metallic phases and shows mass enhancement in Mott metals. The reason is that symmetry breaking removes many of the degeneracies that exist in a symmetry-unbroken system, reducing significantly the need for strong correlation. If one chooses to ignore symmetry breaking, the persistent degeneracies often call for strong correlation treatment.

Recently, the observation of charge transfer and interfacial polarons in superconducting interface has aroused extensive research interest. However, experimental data to investigate charge transfer on the CuO2 plane and the presence of polarons are still missing. Here we conduct extensive research on the optical and electronic properties of two-dimensional material supported on copper-based superconductors. Unlike monolayer-WSe2 on other substrates, monolayer-WSe2 on La1.85Sr0.15CuO4 (WSe2/LSCO) produces a special band structure. Using high-resolution spectroscopic ellipsometry and density functional theory calculation methods, the special electronic structure can be attributed to the formation of the interfacial small polaron at the WSe2/LSCO interface which is driven by charge transfer between the CuO2 plane of the cuprate superconductor and WSe2. In addition, the structural phase transition of the LSCO substrate was observed to reduce the electron-hole (e-h) interaction of WSe2. These findings may spur future investigations on the effect of the interfacial polaron on the superconductivity of cuprates, and highlight the significant influence of interface effects on the electronic structure of WSe2 films. It provides an effective method to further explore the intrinsic relationship between interfacial polarons and superconductivity."}

We present a flexible framework in MLatom that includes a newly implemented Tully's fewest-switches surface hopping algorithm and its time-dependent Baeck--An variant. The capabilities of this framework are demonstrated through three representative examples corresponding to typical stages of a surface hopping study. First, we focus on methods providing energy, energy gradients and nonadiabatic couplings. We show that the flexibility of user-defined custom models can save computational time and that it is useful for benchmarking machine learning models. Next, we compare curvature-driven surface hopping schemes and show that Landau--Zener approach outperforms the time-dependent Baeck--An scheme. Finally, we showcase easy-to-use analysis tools for both individual trajectories and trajectory ensembles. This framework enables accelerated development of machine learning models and provides deeper insight into nonadiabatic dynamics. It is available as a part of the open-source MLatom package."}

To explain the experimental results, previous mean-field studies have explored its thermal phase transitions, identifying armchair phases and striped phases, but their limitations call for more reliable numerical investigations. In this work, we systematically revisit the classical $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$ Ising model using the Wang-Landau algorithm. We find that the armchair (AC) phase, previously reported in mean-field and experimental studies, actually coexists with the spiral (SP) phase, with their combined degeneracy reaching 20-fold (4-fold for the AC states and 16-fold for the spiral states). The phase transitions and critical exponents are studied at different interaction values. We observe first-order phase transitions, continuous phase transitions, and even the multipeak phenomenon, i.e., Schottky-like specific-heat anomalies in frustrated systems.

The combination of Potts symmetry and nonreciprocity gives rise to a rich phase diagram. The nonreciprocal phase shift generates either counter-clockwise or clockwise chirality. Potts symmetry can be broken spontaneously. Consequently, the system exhibits four distinct phases: A species-mixed chiral phase where particles perform counter-clockwise chiral motion with quasi-long-range order, a species separation phase where Potts symmetry is broken and species-separated particles form vortex cells with clockwise chirality, a coexistence phase, and a disordered phase. We derive a Boltzmann equation and a hydrodynamic equation describing the system in the continuum limit, and present analytic arguments for the emergence of chirality and species separation."}

Analysis of radial distribution functions indicates that the flow generates physically meaningful solvent rearrangements, substantially enhancing configurational overlap between states in configuration space.

However, for most systems of practical interest, the solution to the Hedin equations is rendered nearly numerically intractable because the Hedin equations are of functional derivative form. Integral equations are much more numerically tractable, than functional derivative equations, as they can often be solved iteratively. In this work we present a systematic set of integral equations (with no functional derivatives) - Hedin approximations I, II, III, IV etc. - whose solutions converge to the solutions of the exact Hedin equations. The Hedin approximations are well suited to iterative numerical solutions (which we also describe). Furthermore Hedin approximation I is just the GW approximation (as such this work may be viewed as a systematic improvement of the GW approximation). We present a systematic study of the Hedin equations for zero dimensional field theory (which, in particular, is a method to enumerate Feynman diagrams for field theories in arbitrary dimensions) and show better and better convergence to the solutions of the Hedin equations for higher and higher Hedin approximations, with Hedin approximations I, II and III being explicitly studied. We, in particular, show that the higher Hedin approximations capture more and and more Feynman diagrams for the self energy. We also show that already Hedin approximation II captures more diagrams than the state of the art diagrammatic vertex corrections approach. Furthermore Hedin approximation III is a near perfect match to the exact solutions of the Hedin equations, at least in the zero dimensional case, and enumerates a large number of Feynman diagrams."}

Here, we employ a framework based on Zeeman quantum geometry to study magnetotransport at the interface between a magnetic topological insulator and an unconventional magnetic insulator. By choosing the magnetic layer to be insulating, we ensure that the transport response originates solely from the proximity-induced magnetic exchange field, eliminating contributions from itinerant magnetic carriers. We focus on the linear intrinsic gyrotropic magnetic (IGM) response, which naturally decomposes into conduction and displacement current components governed by the Zeeman Berry curvature and the Zeeman quantum metric, respectively. We uncover a universal hierarchy in which the transverse displacement IGM response exhibits characteristic even-fold angular harmonics for magnetic orders ranging from $p$- to $i$-wave, while the longitudinal IGM response distinguishes the parity of the magnetic order through robust sign-reversal patterns. In contrast, the conduction IGM component remains largely insensitive to the underlying magnetic symmetry. Consequently, the displacement IGM current emerges as a high-fidelity symmetry fingerprint of unconventional magnetic order. Using realistic parameter estimates for experimentally accessible heterostructures, we demonstrate that these signatures are well within measurable ranges, establishing Zeeman quantum geometry as a powerful and general framework for characterizing unconventional magnetic insulators via their gyrotropic transport responses."}

Combining a systematic mean-field bifurcation analysis with large-scale Monte Carlo simulations in two and three dimensions, we map the model's dynamical regimes and transitions. Mean-field theory predicts a rich phase structure -- disorder, a time-dependent 'swap' (limit-cycle) phase, and static ordered states -- separated by Hopf, saddle-node on invariant circle, saddle-node of limit cycles, pitchfork and saddle-node bifurcations. In two dimensions, Monte Carlo simulations reveal that spiral defects destabilise global swapping and, unless vacancies are strongly favoured, destroy long-range order. Crucially, a finite single-ion anisotropy $Δ_α= - Δ_β$ promotes vacancy occupation in the $α$ species and suppresses nonreciprocal dynamics, thereby restoring a robust static ordered phase. Finite-size scaling of susceptibility and Binder cumulants places the disorder to static transition firmly in the 2D Ising universality class. Moreover, within the static ordered phase, we observe a crossover that sharpens into a line of first-order phase transitions; these two regimes are separated by a critical point, analogous to the termination of the liquid-gas coexistence curve. In three dimensions, simulations largely mirror mean-field expectations, though swap to static ordering occurs indirectly via a disordered regime. Our results demonstrate that vacancy energetics provide a simple, experimentally relevant control knob that stabilises equilibrium-like order in nonreciprocal systems and that defects can generate novel critical behaviour."}

Strong correlation becomes the recommended medicine. We point out that strong correlation can be mitigated by allowing DFT to lower the energy by breaking structural, magnetic or dipolar symmetries. Such local motifs are observed experimentally by local probes beyond the 'average structure' determined by X-Ray diffraction. Observed broken symmetries can arise from slow fluctuations that persist over the observation time or longer. The surprising fact is that when symmetry breaking motifs are used as input to electronic structure calculations, false metals are converted into real insulators without the recommended medicine of strong correlation. Consistently, DFT calculations that show energy lowering symmetry breaking correct most cases where DFT, even with advanced exchange-correlation functionals, previously missed the correct metal vs insulator designation. Total energy calculations distinguish systems that support energy-lowering symmetry breaking from those that do not. This approach distinguishes between paramagnetic insulating and metallic phases and shows mass enhancement in Mott metals. The reason is that symmetry breaking removes many of the degeneracies that exist in a symmetry-unbroken system, reducing significantly the need for strong correlation. If one chooses to ignore symmetry breaking, the persistent degeneracies often call for strong correlation treatment. Thus, symmetry breaking transforms strong to normal correlation and false metals to true insulators.

While the importance of electron-phonon coupling is understood, a controlled first-principles treatment of Coulomb interaction is lacking. Current ab initio calculations of superconductivity rely on a phenomenological downfolding approximation, replacing Coulomb interaction with a repulsive pseudopotential μ*, and leaving ambiguities in electron-phonon coupling with dynamical Coulomb interactions unresolved. We address this via an effective field theory approach, integrating out high-energy electronic degrees of freedom using variational Diagrammatic Monte Carlo. Applied to the uniform electron gas, this establishes a microscopic procedure to implement downfolding, define the pseudopotential, and express dynamical Coulomb effects on electron-phonon coupling via the electron vertex function. We find the bare pseudopotential significantly larger than conventional values. This yields improved pseudopotential estimates in simple metals and tests density functional perturbation theory accuracy for effective electron-phonon coupling. We present an ab initio workflow computing superconducting Tc from the anomalous vertex's precursory Cooper flow. This infers Tc from normal state calculations, enabling reliable estimates of very low Tc (including near quantum phase transitions) beyond conventional reach. Validating our approach on simple metals without empirical tuning, we resolve long-standing discrepancies and predict a pressure-induced transition in Al from superconducting to non-superconducting above ~60GPa. We propose ambient-pressure Mg and Na are proximal to a similar critical point.

When both principles are satisfied, substantial flexibility remains: essentially any short-range MLIP can be augmented; charge equilibration schemes can be added when desired; dipoles and Born effective charges can be inferred or finetuned; and charge/spin-state embeddings or tensorial targets can be further incorporated. We also discuss current limitations and open challenges.

The low-energy continuum and the occurrence of gap closure at multiple high-symmetry points identify this gapless QSL as the U(1) Dirac spin liquid. These results establish a unified understanding of spin excitations in highly frustrated quantum magnets and provide clear spectral fingerprints for experimental detection in candidate kagome QSL materials."}

In conventional thermodynamic trade-off relations, the quantities of interest are linear in the underlying probability distribution. Some important information-theoretic quantities, such as Rényi entropies, are nonlinear; however, such nonlinearities are generally more difficult to handle. Inspired by replica techniques used in quantum information and spin-glass theory, we construct Markovian dynamics of identical replicas and derive a lower bound on relative moments in terms of the dynamical activity. We apply our general result to two scenarios. First, for a random walker on a network, we derive an upper bound on the Rényi entropy of the position distribution of the walker, which quantifies the extent of diffusion on the network. Remarkably, the bound is expressed solely in terms of escape rate from the initial node, and thus depends only on local information. Second, we consider trajectory observables in Markov processes and obtain an upper bound on the Rényi entropy of the distribution of these observables, again in terms of the dynamical activity. This provides an entropic characterization of uncertainty that generalizes existing variance-based thermodynamic uncertainty relations."}

Here we demonstrate a generalizable route to fabricate twisted bilayers of transition metal nitrides with vdWs like interfaces, using freestanding CrN membranes as a model system.

Compared to the high-pressure bulk system, the ratio of inter-layer $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ hopping to intra-layer $d_{x^2-y^2}$ hopping is suppressed in the 1UC thin film, and the crystal-field splitting of the $e_g$ orbitals is increased. Our calculation indicates that spin-fluctuation-driven pairing correlations are weak for the stoichiometric case at ambient pressure, but increase significantly under hole doping. The leading pairing symmetry is also found to change by hole doping. Specifically, we obtain a leading $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairing state at moderate hole doping, followed by a $d_{xy}$ state at higher doping.

The stochastic analytic continuation method is used to determine the dynamic structure factor from correlation functions in imaginary time obtained by QMC. In contrast to the \"roton minimum\" of the square lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet, we find that magnons on the honeycomb lattice completely decay in the corner of the Brillouin zone ($K$-point); the entire weight is shifted into the continuum. These findings are fully supported by SE and CST in momentum space. The extrapolated one-magnon dispersion obtained from SE about the Ising limit quantitatively agrees with the extracted QMC excitation energies except around the $K$-point, where large uncertainties in the extrapolation indicate the magnon decay. This quantum decay is further confirmed and understood by the CST, which yields a divergent flow when enforcing a magnon quasi-particle picture. The divergence originates from strong attractive magnon-magnon interactions leading to a bound state and thereby to a three-magnon continuum overlapping with the one-magnon state. This has the magnon quasi-particle picture break down at high energies on the honeycomb lattice."}

The strong chemical affinity of the gold and sulfur (Au-S) enables the formation of close-packed SAMs, but it also has recently been found to create a dynamic interface where surface reconstruction can occur under illumination, even with ambient light. This reconstruction may facilitate migration of gold atoms, potentially leading to in-situ formation of gold clusters. However, research on this mechanism often centers on Au(111) crystalline surfaces and flicker-noise measurements. Electron transport in ensembles of molecules in lithographically defined junctions has remained largely unexplored at cryogenic temperatures. In this study, we observe single-electron phenomena characterized by reproducible Coulomb staircases across various long-chain alkanethiol SAMs, which fit the Coulomb-blockade theory of nm-sized metallic nanoparticles. We find no such current steps in samples with amine, rather than thiol, anchors. Additionally, we find that by adding a bipyridyl functional group, these phenomena can be harnessed for memristive switching and negative differential resistance. These findings indicate that the generally observed lack of reliability and reproducibility of molecular devices may be alleviated by using amine anchors instead of thiols to avoid nanoparticle effects. Conversely, the spontaneous formation of the nanoparticles could potentially be controlled and used to achieve useful functionalities, offering new pathways for designing multifunctional nanoelectronic components."}

The advent of computer simulations with atomistic resolution in the 80s and 90s revealed a series of mechanisms that have proved essential to understand key aspects of irradiation damage in crystalline solids. However, we still lack a comprehensive model that can connect atomic-level defect physics with experimental measurements of quantitative features of the irradiated microstructure. In this work we present a mesoscale model that draws from our improved understanding of irradiation damage processes collected over the last few decades, bridging knowledge gained from our most sophisticated atomistic simulations with defect kinetics taking place over time scales many orders of magnitude larger than atomic interaction times. Importantly, the model contains no adjustable parameters, and combines several essential pieces of irradiation damage physics, each playing an irreplaceable role in the context of the full model, but of limited utility if considered in isolation.

Specifically, electron crystals stabilized by longrange Coulomb interactions may host collective vibrational excitations emerging from electron correlations10, termed electronic phonons, which are fundamentally distinct from atomic lattice phonons. Despite theoretical prediction of their existence in moiré electron crystals11, direct experimental evidence has remained elusive. Here we report the observation of electronic phonons in the Mott insulating and stripe phases of a WS2/WSe2 moiré superlattice, achieved through light scattering measurements. The phonon energies, temperature and filling factor dependencies, along with theoretical modeling, corroborate their origin as collective vibrations of a correlated electron crystal. Polarization-resolved measurements further indicate rotational symmetry breaking in the Mott state. Notably, these electronic phonons exhibit strong tunability in energy, intensity, and polarization under external electric or magnetic fields, highlighting rich and controllable lattice dynamics of the electron crystal.

Motivated by this surprising observation, we propose a theoretical framework that captures the intertwinement between superconductivity and fractionalization in a lattice setting. Leveraging the duality between three field-theoretic descriptions of the Jain topological order, we find that bandwidth tuning can drive a single parent FCI at $ν= 2/3$ into five different superconductors, some of which are intrinsically non-Abelian and support Majorana zero modes.

It is found that, at zero spin orbit coupling, ferromagnetism only dominates at small values of anisotropy and coupling constant. Larger values of these parameters favour the formation of altermagnetism. At finite spin-orbit coupling, a paramagnetic phase competes with the other two, and a quantum critical point appears.

The aim was to investigate their magnetic properties, electronic structures, and spin-resolved longitudinal conductivity at finite temperatures. Density functional theory (DFT) and functional integral theory were used. This approach incorporates transverse spin fluctuations through a disordered local moment method and the coherent potential approximation. In all cases, the calculated theoretical Curie temperatures were lower than the experimental values. Alloys with a B2 structures exhibit higher Curie temperatures compared to compounds with an L21 structures. Calculations of the temperature dependence of the density of states (DOS) indicate that the half-metallic electronic structure collapses owing to the renormalization of transverse spin fluctuations at a finite temperatures. However, the spin-resolved longitudinal conductivities demonstrated an improved spin polarization, particularly for Mn2VGa with an L21 structure. This result contradicts predictions based on the temperature-dependent DOS. The competition between the metallic transitions, which are caused by a modification of the DOS, and scattering coming from spin-disorder explains this phenomenon. Both of these effects are induced by transverse spin fluctuations. Additionally, the results show that half-metallicity, as defined by the DOS or conductivity, is inconsistent at finite temperatures. Finally, the total energy landscape of the paramagnetic state was calculated using the fixed spin moment method to investigate the strength of the longitudinal spin fluctuations. These results suggest that the alloys may exhibit strong longitudinal spin fluctuations."}

Strong correlation becomes the recommended medicine. We point out that strong correlation can be mitigated by allowing DFT to lower the energy by breaking structural, magnetic or dipolar symmetries. Such local motifs are observed experimentally by local probes beyond the 'average structure' determined by X-Ray diffraction. Observed broken symmetries can arise from slow fluctuations that persist over the observation time or longer. The surprising fact is that when symmetry breaking motifs are used as input to electronic structure calculations, false metals are converted into real insulators without the recommended medicine of strong correlation. Consistently, DFT calculations that show energy lowering symmetry breaking correct most cases where DFT, even with advanced exchange-correlation functionals, previously missed the correct metal vs insulator designation. Total energy calculations distinguish systems that support energy-lowering symmetry breaking from those that do not. This approach distinguishes between paramagnetic insulating and metallic phases and shows mass enhancement in Mott metals. The reason is that symmetry breaking removes many of the degeneracies that exist in a symmetry-unbroken system, reducing significantly the need for strong correlation. If one chooses to ignore symmetry breaking, the persistent degeneracies often call for strong correlation treatment. Thus, symmetry breaking transforms strong to normal correlation and false metals to true insulators. This view sheds light on the historic controversy between Mott and Slater that still reverberates today."}

The singlet ground state geometries of the dyes were optimized utilizing density functional theory (DFT) with B3LYP and the excited state optical properties were explored through time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) using the PCM model with tetrahydrofuran (THF) as solvent. Both DFT and TD-DFT calculations were carried out using the 6-311G(d,p) basis set.

The absorption maxima values ranged from 690.64 to 975.55 nm.

Inherent to the Hall measurement geometry, the measured signal is often contaminated by unwanted contributions, so the data must be processed to isolate the Hall response. The standard approach invokes Onsager-Casimir reciprocity and antisymmetrizes the raw signal about zero applied magnetic field. In hysteretic materials this becomes nontrivial, since Onsager-Casimir relations apply only to microscopically reversible states. Incorrect antisymmetrization can lead to artifacts that mimic anomalous or topological Hall signatures. The situation is especially subtle when hysteresis loops are not centered at zero applied field, as in exchange-biased systems. A practical reference for generically extracting the Hall response in hysteretic materials is lacking. Here, using Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ as a bulk single-crystal model that can be prepared with or without exchange-biased hysteresis, we demonstrate two procedures that can be used to extract the Hall effect: (1) reverse-magnetic-field reciprocity and (2) antisymmetrization with respect to applied field. We then measure the Hall effect on CeCoGe$_3$, a noncentrosymmetric antiferromagnet which can be prepared to have asymmetric magnetization and magnetoresistance, and demonstrate how improper processing can generate artificial anomalous Hall signals. These methods are generic and can be applied to any conductor."}

The magnitude of this conductivity is comparable to that of GaAs despite silicon's much weaker spin-orbit coupling, and its robustness against NIR photon energy rules out a spin-polarization-based origin, which occurs only in the vicinity of the bandgap.

In this study, we systematically investigated the inter-atomic exchange interactions, magnetic anisotropy energy and magnetocaloric properties of MnX (X = N, P, As, Sb, Bi) using a combination of density functional theory and Monte-Carlo simulations. Additionally, the magneto-optical Kerr and Faraday spectra were computed using the all-electron, fully relativistic, full-potential linearized muffin-tin orbital method. The largest Kerr effect observed in MnBi can be inferred as a combined effect of maximal exchange splitting of Mn 3d states and the large spin-orbit coupling of Bi. To extract site-projected spin and orbital moments, spin-orbit coupling and orbital polarization correction are accounted in the present calculation, which shows good agreement between the moment obtained from the X-ray magnetic circular dichroism sum rule analysis, spin-polarized calculation, and experimental studies. The magnetic transition temperatures predicted through Monte-Carlo simulations were in good agreement with the corresponding experimental values. Our results provide a unified microscopic understanding of magnetocaloric performance and magneto-optical activity in Mn-based pnictides and establish a reliable computational framework for designing next-generation magnetic refrigeration materials."}

The emitter is coupled to phonon modes of the surrounding bulk semiconductor, described by a super-Ohmic spectral density. We show that the RF spectrum of this system consists of a central elastic line, a broad phonon sideband known from other linear and nonlinear spectra of such systems, as well as a narrow inelastic contribution, which is characteristic of scattering spectra and stems from noise-induced transient dynamics. At moderate phonon couplings or low temperatures, the interplay between the broad sideband and the inelastic feature leads to a Fano-like profile near the resonant energy with the Fano parameter determined by laser detuning. In the weak-coupling limit (where only single-phonon processes are included), the spectrum becomes an exact Fano shape and resonant light scattering is entirely suppressed. The amplitude of this spectral feature grows linearly with temperature, while its width depends solely on the spontaneous emission rate of the emitter. We relate the quantum character of the reservoir to the non-commutativity of noise observables and show that Fano resonance persists in the classical limit. We also discuss how the redistribution of optical coupling efficiency between the central line and the sidebands affects the total scattering rate under various excitation conditions."}

In this work, we systematically revisit the classical $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$ Ising model using the Wang-Landau algorithm. We find that the armchair (AC) phase, previously reported in mean-field and experimental studies, actually coexists with the spiral (SP) phase, with their combined degeneracy reaching 20-fold (4-fold for the AC states and 16-fold for the spiral states). The phase transitions and critical exponents are studied at different interaction values. We observe first-order phase transitions, continuous phase transitions, and even the multipeak phenomenon, i.e., Schottky-like specific-heat anomalies in frustrated systems. These results clarify the nature of phases and phase transitions in frustrated Ising systems and their exponents, and additionally provide inspiration for experimental efforts to search for the spiral state and Schottky-like anomalies."}

The advent of computer simulations with atomistic resolution in the 80s and 90s revealed a series of mechanisms that have proved essential to understand key aspects of irradiation damage in crystalline solids. However, we still lack a comprehensive model that can connect atomic-level defect physics with experimental measurements of quantitative features of the irradiated microstructure. In this work we present a mesoscale model that draws from our improved understanding of irradiation damage processes collected over the last few decades, bridging knowledge gained from our most sophisticated atomistic simulations with defect kinetics taking place over time scales many orders of magnitude larger than atomic interaction times. Importantly, the model contains no adjustable parameters, and combines several essential pieces of irradiation damage physics, each playing an irreplaceable role in the context of the full model, but of limited utility if considered in isolation. Crucially, we carry out a set of experiments carefully designed to isolate the key irradiation damage variables and facilitate validation. Using tungsten as a model material, we find exceptionally good agreement between our numerical predictions and experimental measurements of defect densities and defect cluster sizes."}

Here, we demonstrate in-situ control over the dominant EDSR driving mechanism of a hole-spin qubit in a silicon fin field-effect transistor by applying microwave signals to two different gate electrodes, thereby tuning the orientation of the local electric field. We measure the effective g-factor, its electrical tunability, and the Rabi frequency as functions of magnetic-field orientation. Their distinct angular dependencies, analyzed using a g-matrix formalism, allow us to identify the underlying driving processes and track their relative contributions for different drive configurations. By selecting the drive electrode, we can switch from a regime dominated by g-factor modulation to one with a strong contribution from wavefunction displacement. This in-situ tunability provides direct experimental access to both spin-driving mechanisms and offers a route toward optimized spin-qubit performance."}

The aim was to investigate their magnetic properties, electronic structures, and spin-resolved longitudinal conductivity at finite temperatures. Density functional theory (DFT) and functional integral theory were used. This approach incorporates transverse spin fluctuations through a disordered local moment method and the coherent potential approximation. In all cases, the calculated theoretical Curie temperatures were lower than the experimental values. Alloys with a B2 structures exhibit higher Curie temperatures compared to compounds with an L21 structures. Calculations of the temperature dependence of the density of states (DOS) indicate that the half-metallic electronic structure collapses owing to the renormalization of transverse spin fluctuations at a finite temperatures. However, the spin-resolved longitudinal conductivities demonstrated an improved spin polarization, particularly for Mn2VGa with an L21 structure. This result contradicts predictions based on the temperature-dependent DOS. The competition between the metallic transitions, which are caused by a modification of the DOS, and scattering coming from spin-disorder explains this phenomenon. Both of these effects are induced by transverse spin fluctuations. Additionally, the results show that half-metallicity, as defined by the DOS or conductivity, is inconsistent at finite temperatures. Finally, the total energy landscape of the paramagnetic state was calculated using the fixed spin moment method to investigate the strength of the longitudinal spin fluctuations. These results suggest that the alloys may exhibit strong longitudinal spin fluctuations."}

The non-coplanar nature of the antiferromagnetic ordering protects the topological magnon nodal lines that transition into Weyl magnons upon the application of specific symmetry-breaking perturbations using an external magnetic field. Zero-field INS measurements confirm the existence of the topological magnon nodal lines through the pseudo-spin winding of the scattering intensity in angular scans near the nodal lines, indicating the non-trivial topology of the magnon wavefunctions.

By increasing the effective electron dipole, flopping mode qubits can provide faster gates with smaller field gradients. Moreover, operating in the strong-driving limit can reduce their sensitivity to charge noise. However, alloy disorder in Si/SiGe heterostructures randomizes the valley energy splitting and the valley phase difference between dots, enhancing the probably of valley excitations while tunneling between the dots, and opening a leakage channel. In this work, we analyze the performance of flopping mode spin qubits in the presence of charge noise and alloy disorder, and we optimize these qubits for a variety of valley configurations, in both weak and strong charge-noise regimes. When the charge noise is weak, high fidelity qubits can be implemented across a wide range of valley parameters, provided the electronic pulse is fine-tuned for a given valley configuration. When the charge noise is strong, high-fidelity pulses can still be engineered, provided the valley splittings in each dot are relatively large and the valley phase difference is relatively small. We analyze how charge noise-induced fluctuations of the inter-dot detuning, as well as small shifts in other qubit parameters, impact qubit fidelities. We find that strongly driven pulses are less sensitive to detuning fluctuations but more sensitive to small shifts in the valley parameters, which can actually dominate the qubit infidelities in some regimes. Finally, we discuss schemes to tune devices away from poor-performing configurations, enhancing the scalability of flopping-mode-based qubit architectures."}

To capture this behavior, we develop a continuum approximation that incorporates higher-order dispersive and nonreciprocal effects and provides accurate analytical predictions across all relevant time scales. Building on this framework, we then demonstrate the existence of a non-Hermiticity-induced jump - an abrupt spatial shift of the wave-packet center even in the absence of disorder - and derive its underlying analytical foundation.

While the largest publicly available dataset, Starrydata2, has a high data volume, it contains inaccurate data due to the inherent limitations of Large Language Model (LLM)-assisted data curation, ambiguous nomenclature and complex formulas of materials in the literature. Another unaddressed issue is the inclusion of multi-source experimental data, with high standard deviations and without synthesis information. Using half-Heusler (hH) materials as an example, this work is aimed at first highlighting these errors and inconsistencies which cannot be filtered with conventional dataset curation workflows. We then propose a statistical round-robin error-based data filtering method to address these issues, a method that can be applied to filter any other material property. Lastly, a hybrid dataset creation workflow, involving data from Starrydata2 and manual extraction, is proposed and the resulting dataset is analyzed and compared against Starrydata2."}

Strong correlation becomes the recommended medicine. We point out that strong correlation can be mitigated by allowing DFT to lower the energy by breaking structural, magnetic or dipolar symmetries. Such local motifs are observed experimentally by local probes beyond the 'average structure' determined by X-Ray diffraction. Observed broken symmetries can arise from slow fluctuations that persist over the observation time or longer. The surprising fact is that when symmetry breaking motifs are used as input to electronic structure calculations, false metals are converted into real insulators without the recommended medicine of strong correlation. Consistently, DFT calculations that show energy lowering symmetry breaking correct most cases where DFT, even with advanced exchange-correlation functionals, previously missed the correct metal vs insulator designation. Total energy calculations distinguish systems that support energy-lowering symmetry breaking from those that do not. This approach distinguishes between paramagnetic insulating and metallic phases and shows mass enhancement in Mott metals. The reason is that symmetry breaking removes many of the degeneracies that exist in a symmetry-unbroken system, reducing significantly the need for strong correlation. If one chooses to ignore symmetry breaking, the persistent degeneracies often call for strong correlation treatment. Thus, symmetry breaking transforms strong to normal correlation and false metals to true insulators. This view sheds light on the historic controversy between Mott and Slater that still reverberates today."}

However, direct experimental observations of interfacial thermal conductance across molecular junctions have remained challenging due to the high spatiotemporal resolution required for probing. Here, we report dynamic energy transport processes across multi-component molecular junctions observed at the atomic level by employing reflection ultrafast electron diffraction. A clear temporal sequence of energy transfer is revealed at early times following photoexcitation of Au(111) surfaces chemically bonded with self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of alkanethiols: from the gold surface layer (SL) to the head groups of a SAM and then to the CH2-CH2 methylene lattice. Remarkably, the structural dynamics of the gold SL differ significantly from those of clean gold. Furthermore, the methylene lattice dynamics exhibit chain-length insensitivity but with a length-dependent retention time to reach full thermalization. Quantitatively, we find an agreement in the increased out-of-plane atomic motions between the surface gold atoms and the SAM methylene units, signifying the nature of motion-based coupling for interfacial energy transport. High interfacial thermal conductance (~300 MW/m^2/K) and high thermal conductivity for the methylene lattice (~60 W/m/K) are obtained under the condition of impulsive heating, which provide strong support for previous room-temperature theoretical predictions and also the ballistic nature of intrachain heat transfer. This time- and spatially-resolved experimental approach will enable future quantitative assessment of interfacial energy transport across solid-molecule junctions."}

However, most existing RT-TDDFT studies rely on adiabatic local or semi-local approximations, which suffer from several shortcomings, including the inability to accurately capture excitonic effects in periodic systems. Combining RT-TDDFT with range-separated hybrid (RSH) functionals has emerged as an effective strategy to overcome these limitations. The RT-TDDFT-RSH implementation for periodic systems requires careful treatment of the Coulomb singularity and choosing proper gauges for the incorporation of external fields. We benchmark two schemes for treating the Coulomb singularity - the truncated Coulomb potential and the auxiliary-function correction - and find that the latter shows better convergence behavior and numerical stability for long-range corrected hybrid functions. Additionally, we assess the impact of gauge choice in simulations using numerical atomic orbitals and show that the recently proposed hybrid gauge incorporating position-dependent phases provides a more accurate description of excitonic absorption than the conventional velocity gauge. Our implementation significantly improves the accuracy of RT-TDDFT-RSH for modeling ultrafast excitonic dynamics in periodic systems."}

The low roughness of all the surface of the film indicates uniformity, moderate corrosion resistance, and good structural quality. The X-ray diffraction spectra reveal the amorphous nature of the CFB layer, while the W capping is of mixed phase in the experimental thickness regime. In-plane and out-of-plane hysteresis loops obtained from the vibrating sample magnetometry technique show a transition from an upright S to nearly rectangular shape via a completely inverted profile. A self-sustained tilted magnetic anisotropy is stabilized in a seed-free environment based on the direct substrate-to-magnet interaction. The interface anisotropy is estimated to be 0.06 erg/cm2. The complex anisotropic behavior originates from the interplay between interface anisotropy, conventional shape anisotropy, growth-induced anisotropies, and inhomogeneity-induced anisotropies.

These topological surface phonons, originating from nontrivial acoustic phonon nodal lines, not only serve as key scattering channels for dominant acoustic phonons but also contribute substantially to the overall thermal conductivity.

By employing the B3LYP functional and implicit solvent models, the field dependent adsorption energetics, frontier orbitals and electrostatic potentials are calculated on a nickel surface. Key findings reveal that while saccharinate dominates in bulk plating baths, its strong solvation shell impedes surface adsorption.

Below $T_\\mathrm{C}$, phonons harden, and the linewidth narrows, consistent with reduced anharmonicity, while across the spin reorientation transition at $T_\\mathrm{SR}$ they display anomalous softening, linewidth broadening, and a peak in lifetime, which are signatures of strengthened spin-phonon coupling. Complementary DFT+DMFT calculations and atomistic spin dynamical simulations reveal temperature-dependent spin excitations whose energies overlap with the Raman-active phonons, providing a natural route for the observed magnon-phonon interaction. Together, these insights establish Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$ as a versatile platform for exploring intertwined spin, lattice, and electronic degrees of freedom, with relevance for dynamic spintronic and magneto-optic functionalities near technologically meaningful temperatures."}

Also, the samples' in vitro apatite-forming ability in a simulated body fluid was comparatively evaluated by electron microscopy, inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. According to the results, the material's sinterability was improved by fluoride doping, as realized from the further development of sintering necks. It was also found that compared to the undoped bioceramic, a higher amount of apatite was deposited on the surface of the doped sample. It is concluded that fluoride can be considered as a doping agent in magnesium-containing silicates to improve biological, particularly bioactivity, behaviors."}

While the importance of electron-phonon coupling is understood, a controlled first-principles treatment of Coulomb interaction is lacking. Current ab initio calculations of superconductivity rely on a phenomenological downfolding approximation, replacing Coulomb interaction with a repulsive pseudopotential μ*, and leaving ambiguities in electron-phonon coupling with dynamical Coulomb interactions unresolved. We address this via an effective field theory approach, integrating out high-energy electronic degrees of freedom using variational Diagrammatic Monte Carlo. Applied to the uniform electron gas, this establishes a microscopic procedure to implement downfolding, define the pseudopotential, and express dynamical Coulomb effects on electron-phonon coupling via the electron vertex function. We find the bare pseudopotential significantly larger than conventional values. This yields improved pseudopotential estimates in simple metals and tests density functional perturbation theory accuracy for effective electron-phonon coupling. We present an ab initio workflow computing superconducting Tc from the anomalous vertex's precursory Cooper flow. This infers Tc from normal state calculations, enabling reliable estimates of very low Tc (including near quantum phase transitions) beyond conventional reach. Validating our approach on simple metals without empirical tuning, we resolve long-standing discrepancies and predict a pressure-induced transition in Al from superconducting to non-superconducting above ~60GPa. We propose ambient-pressure Mg and Na are proximal to a similar critical point. Our work establishes a controlled ab initio framework for electron-phonon superconductivity beyond the weak-correlation limit, paving the way for reliable Tc calculations and novel material design."}

At room temperature, uniaxial tensile strain increases the resistivity tensor components by a comparable magnitude both parallel and perpendicular to the strain axis. In the case of biaxial strain, up to 20~K decrease in the CCDW-NCCDW phase transition temperature is observed. In the case of uniaxial strain, a new phase with two different CCDW-NCCDW phase transition temperatures is observed, the splitting exceeds 10 K. The occurrence of such a phase is associated with the transition of the CDW into the commensurate state along the tensile strain direction while maintaining nearly commensurability along the perpendicular one.

These efforts aim to understand and enhance the spin spin interactions in 2D. An emergent class of such magnets is the layered FeNGeTe2 (N = 3, 4, and 5). Here, we investigate the magnetic states over a wide field temperature phase space in the high-Tc ferromagnet Fe5GeTe2 using magnetization, ferromagnetic resonance (FMR), and magneto-transport measurements. Our findings reveal a magnetic phase transition from a collinear to a complex non-collinear magnetic order near the temperature T* = 160 K, below which magnetic susceptibility is reduced, FMR linewidth broadened, and anomalous Hall resistivity suppressed. Such non-collinearity results from the competition between magnetocrystalline anisotropy and Dzyaloshinskii Moriya interaction arising from the unusual Fe1 ordering in two possible split sites. Our study focuses on the strategy to quench the non-collinear spin order. Substituting 40% Ni in Fe5GeTe2 is found to be one such quenching strategy.

We present its relation with the transverse pumped quantum Hall current. The magnetic susceptibility can be introduced as a measure of the topological invariant i.e. remains quantized within the topological phase until the transition. We show the relation with two-dimensional topological lattice models such as a honeycomb Haldane model in real space. We develop the theory and present a numerical analysis between local invariants in momentum space introduced from Dirac points, correlation functions and the responses to circularly polarized light.

While separator design is crucial for optimizing battery performance, its potential remains underexplored. The commonly used glass fiber (GF) filters were not originally designed as battery separators. To address their limitations, nanochitin derived from waste shrimp shells was used to fabricate separators with varying concentrations of amine and carboxylic functional groups. This study investigates how the type and concentration of these groups influence the separator's properties and performance. In a mild acidic electrolyte that protonates the amine groups, the results showed that the density of both ammonium and carboxylic groups in the separators significantly affected water structure and ionic conductivity. Quasi-Elastic Neutron Scattering (QENS) revealed that low-functionalized chitin, particularly with only ammonium groups, promotes strongly bound water with restricted mobility, thereby enhancing Zn plating and stripping kinetics. These separators exhibit exceptional Zn stability over 2000 hours at low current densities (0.5 mA/cm2), maintaining low overpotentials and stable polarization. Additionally, the full cell consisting of Zn||NaV3O8.1.5H2O showed a cycle life of over 2000 cycles at 2 A/g, demonstrating the compatibility of the nanochitin-based separators with low concentrations of functional surface groups. These results demonstrate the importance of a simple separator design for improving the overall performance of AZBs."}

Compared to the high-pressure bulk system, the ratio of inter-layer $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ hopping to intra-layer $d_{x^2-y^2}$ hopping is suppressed in the 1UC thin film, and the crystal-field splitting of the $e_g$ orbitals is increased. Our calculation indicates that spin-fluctuation-driven pairing correlations are weak for the stoichiometric case at ambient pressure, but increase significantly under hole doping. The leading pairing symmetry is also found to change by hole doping.

These efforts aim to understand and enhance the spin spin interactions in 2D. An emergent class of such magnets is the layered FeNGeTe2 (N = 3, 4, and 5). Here, we investigate the magnetic states over a wide field temperature phase space in the high-Tc ferromagnet Fe5GeTe2 using magnetization, ferromagnetic resonance (FMR), and magneto-transport measurements. Our findings reveal a magnetic phase transition from a collinear to a complex non-collinear magnetic order near the temperature T* = 160 K, below which magnetic susceptibility is reduced, FMR linewidth broadened, and anomalous Hall resistivity suppressed. Such non-collinearity results from the competition between magnetocrystalline anisotropy and Dzyaloshinskii Moriya interaction arising from the unusual Fe1 ordering in two possible split sites. Our study focuses on the strategy to quench the non-collinear spin order. Substituting 40% Ni in Fe5GeTe2 is found to be one such quenching strategy.

In the case of biaxial strain, up to 20~K decrease in the CCDW-NCCDW phase transition temperature is observed. In the case of uniaxial strain, a new phase with two different CCDW-NCCDW phase transition temperatures is observed, the splitting exceeds 10 K.

To develop novel organic dyes, three acceptor/anchoring groups and five donating groups were introduced to strategic positions of the base porphyrin structure, resulting in a total of fifteen dyes. The singlet ground state geometries of the dyes were optimized utilizing density functional theory (DFT) with B3LYP and the excited state optical properties were explored through time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) using the PCM model with tetrahydrofuran (THF) as solvent. Both DFT and TD-DFT calculations were carried out using the 6-311G(d,p) basis set. The HOMO energy levels of almost all the modified dyes are lower than the redox potential of I$^-$/I$3^-$ and LUMO energy levels are higher than the conduction band of TiO$2$. The absorption maxima values ranged from 690.64 to 975.55 nm. The dye N1 using triphenylamine group as donor and p-ethynylbenzoic acid group as acceptor, showed optimum optoelectronic properties ($ΔG{reg}=-9.73$ eV, $ΔG{inj}=7.18$ eV, $V_{OC}=1.47$ V and $J_{SC}=15.03$ mA/cm$^2$) with highest PCE 14.37%, making it the best studied dye. This newly modified organic dye with enhanced PCE is remarkably effective for the dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC) industry.

For the $φ^4$ theory, the resulting two point Padé approximants exhibit uniform and global convergence to the exact correlation function. For the Hubbard model, we show that even at second order, the Padé appproximant already provides reasonable characterization of the Matsubara Green's function for a wide range of parameters.

We compute ground-state photonic observables including photon number fluctuations, second-order correlations, and quadrature variances, and find squeezing and super-Poissonian photon statistics emerging from light-matter interactions in the strong coupling regime. Our results demonstrate that capturing the full hierarchy of many-body, electron-photon and multi-photon correlations is essential for a consistent description of quantum-optical properties in strongly coupled molecular systems, establishing QEDFT as a first-principles framework for predicting nonclassical photonic features in the ground state of complex systems."}

However, for most systems of practical interest, the solution to the Hedin equations is rendered nearly numerically intractable because the Hedin equations are of functional derivative form. Integral equations are much more numerically tractable, than functional derivative equations, as they can often be solved iteratively. In this work we present a systematic set of integral equations (with no functional derivatives) - Hedin approximations I, II, III, IV etc. - whose solutions converge to the solutions of the exact Hedin equations. The Hedin approximations are well suited to iterative numerical solutions (which we also describe). Furthermore Hedin approximation I is just the GW approximation (as such this work may be viewed as a systematic improvement of the GW approximation). We present a systematic study of the Hedin equations for zero dimensional field theory (which, in particular, is a method to enumerate Feynman diagrams for field theories in arbitrary dimensions) and show better and better convergence to the solutions of the Hedin equations for higher and higher Hedin approximations, with Hedin approximations I, II and III being explicitly studied. We, in particular, show that the higher Hedin approximations capture more and and more Feynman diagrams for the self energy. We also show that already Hedin approximation II captures more diagrams than the state of the art diagrammatic vertex corrections approach. Furthermore Hedin approximation III is a near perfect match to the exact solutions of the Hedin equations, at least in the zero dimensional case, and enumerates a large number of Feynman diagrams."}

Despite a few decades of research, a comprehensive and systematic rigorous characterisation of their spatial and, even more, time dependent properties has remained elusive. Among the obstacles, we can mention their out of equilibrium and non-linear dynamics features which prevent, in general, the access to the stationary properties explicitly. In fact, even the knowledge of the stationary state is quite exceptional in sandpiles. In that respect, it has become standard to develop a model to model strategy and, so to say, general results or tools applicable to these systems are missing. In this paper, we unveil general and simple properties of time transport correlations in certain classes of abelian sandpile models. We proceed gradually, starting from results applicable in a broad context, to more and more specific ones, consequently valid to smaller and smaller classes. For instance, we show, under a few hypothesis, that the number of particles dissipated displays mostly anticorrelation in time. Besides, on a more integrable point of view, the approach followed might culminate with the proof of a link between 2-points time transport correlations and the second moment of the integrated transport over time. To be clear, these two quantities are related through a linear system of equations which is explicitly solved and applies to at least three 1D sandpile models, namely the Directed Stochastic Sandpile, the Oslo and the Activated Random Walk (in a peculiar setup) models."}

Here, we demonstrate a simple and direct method to generate a superconducting 2DEG on KTaO3(111) using Mg-induced surface reduction in molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE). Mg has an extremely low sticking coefficient at elevated temperatures, enabling the formation of an ultrathin (less than 1-2 monolayers) MgO layer that is transparent to soft x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). This allows direct measurement of the surface chemistry and low-energy electronic structure of the pristine reduced surface without the need for a several-nanometer-thick capping layer. XPS shows clear reduction of Ta5+ to lower oxidation states, while ARPES reveals a parabolic Ta 5d conduction band with an approximately 150 meV bandwidth and additional subband features arising from quantum confinement.

In this work, we systematically revisit the classical $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$ Ising model using the Wang-Landau algorithm.

The phase transitions and critical exponents are studied at different interaction values. We observe first-order phase transitions, continuous phase transitions, and even the multipeak phenomenon, i.e., Schottky-like specific-heat anomalies in frustrated systems.

Inherent to the Hall measurement geometry, the measured signal is often contaminated by unwanted contributions, so the data must be processed to isolate the Hall response. The standard approach invokes Onsager-Casimir reciprocity and antisymmetrizes the raw signal about zero applied magnetic field. In hysteretic materials this becomes nontrivial, since Onsager-Casimir relations apply only to microscopically reversible states. Incorrect antisymmetrization can lead to artifacts that mimic anomalous or topological Hall signatures. The situation is especially subtle when hysteresis loops are not centered at zero applied field, as in exchange-biased systems. A practical reference for generically extracting the Hall response in hysteretic materials is lacking. Here, using Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ as a bulk single-crystal model that can be prepared with or without exchange-biased hysteresis, we demonstrate two procedures that can be used to extract the Hall effect: (1) reverse-magnetic-field reciprocity and (2) antisymmetrization with respect to applied field. We then measure the Hall effect on CeCoGe$_3$, a noncentrosymmetric antiferromagnet which can be prepared to have asymmetric magnetization and magnetoresistance, and demonstrate how improper processing can generate artificial anomalous Hall signals. These methods are generic and can be applied to any conductor."}

This system possessing permutation symmetry displays rich collective behaviors, including a species-mixed chiral phase with quasi-long-range polar order and a species separation phase characterized by vortex cells. The system also displays a coexistence phase of the chiral and the species separation phases, in which intriguing dynamic patterns emerge. These rich collective behaviors are a consequence of the interplay between nonreciprocity and permutation symmetry."}

However, most existing RT-TDDFT studies rely on adiabatic local or semi-local approximations, which suffer from several shortcomings, including the inability to accurately capture excitonic effects in periodic systems. Combining RT-TDDFT with range-separated hybrid (RSH) functionals has emerged as an effective strategy to overcome these limitations. The RT-TDDFT-RSH implementation for periodic systems requires careful treatment of the Coulomb singularity and choosing proper gauges for the incorporation of external fields. We benchmark two schemes for treating the Coulomb singularity - the truncated Coulomb potential and the auxiliary-function correction - and find that the latter shows better convergence behavior and numerical stability for long-range corrected hybrid functions. Additionally, we assess the impact of gauge choice in simulations using numerical atomic orbitals and show that the recently proposed hybrid gauge incorporating position-dependent phases provides a more accurate description of excitonic absorption than the conventional velocity gauge. Our implementation significantly improves the accuracy of RT-TDDFT-RSH for modeling ultrafast excitonic dynamics in periodic systems."}

In the excitonic regime of a realistic model of Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$, the third order 2DCS signals are strongly enhanced by the condensate's amplitude and phase modes, with negligible contributions from single-particle excitations. In the linear optical response, in contrast, single-particle and collective-mode contributions overlap. With increasing electron-phonon coupling, the amplitude mode contribution to 2DCS initially remains robust, but then drops rapidly and remains small in the phonon-dominated regime -- even in systems with large order parameter. 2DCS also aids the detection of the massive relative phase mode, which is analogous to the Leggett mode in superconductors. Our analysis, based on the time-dependent Hartree-Fock approach, demonstrates that 2DCS can track the emergence of the symmetry-broken state and the crossover from Coulomb-driven to phonon-driven order."}

This system is characterized by a constant phase shift $α$ in the inter-species velocity alignment rule. While the phase shift renders the interaction nonreciprocal, the system is globally invariant under any permutations of particle species, possessing Potts symmetry. The combination of Potts symmetry and nonreciprocity gives rise to a rich phase diagram. The nonreciprocal phase shift generates either counter-clockwise or clockwise chirality. Potts symmetry can be broken spontaneously. Consequently, the system exhibits four distinct phases: A species-mixed chiral phase where particles perform counter-clockwise chiral motion with quasi-long-range order, a species separation phase where Potts symmetry is broken and species-separated particles form vortex cells with clockwise chirality, a coexistence phase, and a disordered phase. We derive a Boltzmann equation and a hydrodynamic equation describing the system in the continuum limit, and present analytic arguments for the emergence of chirality and species separation."}

Here, by combining first-principles-based machine learning potentials with the phonon Boltzmann transport equation and molecular dynamics simulations, we systematically investigate the role of topological surface phonons in the in-plane thermal transport of semiconductor thin films (Si, 4H -SiC, and c-BN). These topological surface phonons, originating from nontrivial acoustic phonon nodal lines, not only serve as key scattering channels for dominant acoustic phonons but also contribute substantially to the overall thermal conductivity. Remarkably, for these thin semiconductor films below 10 nm this contribution can be as large as over 30% of the in-plane thermal conductivity at 300 K, and the largest absolute contribution can reach 82 W/m-K, highlighting their significant role in nanoscale thermal transport in semiconductors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that both temperature and biaxial strain provide effective means to modulate this contribution. Our work establishes a direct link between topological surface phonons and nanoscale thermal transport, offering the first quantitative assessment of their role and paving the way for topology-enabled thermal management in semiconductors."}

However, for most systems of practical interest, the solution to the Hedin equations is rendered nearly numerically intractable because the Hedin equations are of functional derivative form. Integral equations are much more numerically tractable, than functional derivative equations, as they can often be solved iteratively. In this work we present a systematic set of integral equations (with no functional derivatives) - Hedin approximations I, II, III, IV etc. - whose solutions converge to the solutions of the exact Hedin equations. The Hedin approximations are well suited to iterative numerical solutions (which we also describe). Furthermore Hedin approximation I is just the GW approximation (as such this work may be viewed as a systematic improvement of the GW approximation). We present a systematic study of the Hedin equations for zero dimensional field theory (which, in particular, is a method to enumerate Feynman diagrams for field theories in arbitrary dimensions) and show better and better convergence to the solutions of the Hedin equations for higher and higher Hedin approximations, with Hedin approximations I, II and III being explicitly studied. We, in particular, show that the higher Hedin approximations capture more and and more Feynman diagrams for the self energy. We also show that already Hedin approximation II captures more diagrams than the state of the art diagrammatic vertex corrections approach. Furthermore Hedin approximation III is a near perfect match to the exact solutions of the Hedin equations, at least in the zero dimensional case, and enumerates a large number of Feynman diagrams."}

Reducing $|J_2|/J_1$ causes increasingly strong spin-wave renormalization, flattening these modes then merging them into a continuum characteristic of deconfined spinons at all finite energies in the QSL. The low-energy continuum and the occurrence of gap closure at multiple high-symmetry points identify this gapless QSL as the U(1) Dirac spin liquid. These results establish a unified understanding of spin excitations in highly frustrated quantum magnets and provide clear spectral fingerprints for experimental detection in candidate kagome QSL materials."}

This study employs density functional theory (DFT) calculations to elucidate the field dependent adsorption behavior of neutral saccharin and its deprotonated anion (saccharinate) on nickel. By employing the B3LYP functional and implicit solvent models, the field dependent adsorption energetics, frontier orbitals and electrostatic potentials are calculated on a nickel surface. Key findings reveal that while saccharinate dominates in bulk plating baths, its strong solvation shell impedes surface adsorption. In contrast, neutral saccharin exhibits energetically favorable adsorption via sulfonyl oxygen or aromatic $π$-face interactions, with specific orientations further stabilized by the interfacial field.This selective adsorption at growth sites rationalizes saccharin's role in inhibiting rapid crystallization, promoting grain refinement, and producing bright, level deposits.The results directly link field-modulated molecular stereochemistry to macroscopic coating properties, providing a mechanistic foundation for the rational design of electroplating additives beyond empirical approaches."}

Combining a systematic mean-field bifurcation analysis with large-scale Monte Carlo simulations in two and three dimensions, we map the model's dynamical regimes and transitions. Mean-field theory predicts a rich phase structure -- disorder, a time-dependent 'swap' (limit-cycle) phase, and static ordered states -- separated by Hopf, saddle-node on invariant circle, saddle-node of limit cycles, pitchfork and saddle-node bifurcations. In two dimensions, Monte Carlo simulations reveal that spiral defects destabilise global swapping and, unless vacancies are strongly favoured, destroy long-range order. Crucially, a finite single-ion anisotropy $Δ_α= - Δ_β$ promotes vacancy occupation in the $α$ species and suppresses nonreciprocal dynamics, thereby restoring a robust static ordered phase. Finite-size scaling of susceptibility and Binder cumulants places the disorder to static transition firmly in the 2D Ising universality class. Moreover, within the static ordered phase, we observe a crossover that sharpens into a line of first-order phase transitions; these two regimes are separated by a critical point, analogous to the termination of the liquid-gas coexistence curve. In three dimensions, simulations largely mirror mean-field expectations, though swap to static ordering occurs indirectly via a disordered regime. Our results demonstrate that vacancy energetics provide a simple, experimentally relevant control knob that stabilises equilibrium-like order in nonreciprocal systems and that defects can generate novel critical behaviour."}

The strong chemical affinity of the gold and sulfur (Au-S) enables the formation of close-packed SAMs, but it also has recently been found to create a dynamic interface where surface reconstruction can occur under illumination, even with ambient light. This reconstruction may facilitate migration of gold atoms, potentially leading to in-situ formation of gold clusters. However, research on this mechanism often centers on Au(111) crystalline surfaces and flicker-noise measurements. Electron transport in ensembles of molecules in lithographically defined junctions has remained largely unexplored at cryogenic temperatures. In this study, we observe single-electron phenomena characterized by reproducible Coulomb staircases across various long-chain alkanethiol SAMs, which fit the Coulomb-blockade theory of nm-sized metallic nanoparticles. We find no such current steps in samples with amine, rather than thiol, anchors. Additionally, we find that by adding a bipyridyl functional group, these phenomena can be harnessed for memristive switching and negative differential resistance. These findings indicate that the generally observed lack of reliability and reproducibility of molecular devices may be alleviated by using amine anchors instead of thiols to avoid nanoparticle effects. Conversely, the spontaneous formation of the nanoparticles could potentially be controlled and used to achieve useful functionalities, offering new pathways for designing multifunctional nanoelectronic components."}

Yet, a large fraction of reported KTaO3-based 2DEGs has been realized through chemically complex overlayers that both generate carriers and can obscure the native electronic structure, making spectroscopic access to the underlying 2DEG challenging. Here, we demonstrate a simple and direct method to generate a superconducting 2DEG on KTaO3(111) using Mg-induced surface reduction in molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE). Mg has an extremely low sticking coefficient at elevated temperatures, enabling the formation of an ultrathin (less than 1-2 monolayers) MgO layer that is transparent to soft x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). This allows direct measurement of the surface chemistry and low-energy electronic structure of the pristine reduced surface without the need for a several-nanometer-thick capping layer. XPS shows clear reduction of Ta5+ to lower oxidation states, while ARPES reveals a parabolic Ta 5d conduction band with an approximately 150 meV bandwidth and additional subband features arising from quantum confinement. Transport measurements confirm a superconducting transition below 0.6 K. Together, these results demonstrate a chemically straightforward and controllable pathway for fabricating spectroscopically accessible superconducting 2DEGs on KTaO3(111), and provide a powerful new platform for investigating the mechanisms underlying orientation-dependent superconductivity in KTaO3-based oxide interfaces."}

In conventional thermodynamic trade-off relations, the quantities of interest are linear in the underlying probability distribution. Some important information-theoretic quantities, such as Rényi entropies, are nonlinear; however, such nonlinearities are generally more difficult to handle. Inspired by replica techniques used in quantum information and spin-glass theory, we construct Markovian dynamics of identical replicas and derive a lower bound on relative moments in terms of the dynamical activity. We apply our general result to two scenarios. First, for a random walker on a network, we derive an upper bound on the Rényi entropy of the position distribution of the walker, which quantifies the extent of diffusion on the network. Remarkably, the bound is expressed solely in terms of escape rate from the initial node, and thus depends only on local information. Second, we consider trajectory observables in Markov processes and obtain an upper bound on the Rényi entropy of the distribution of these observables, again in terms of the dynamical activity. This provides an entropic characterization of uncertainty that generalizes existing variance-based thermodynamic uncertainty relations."}

Recently, the observation of charge transfer and interfacial polarons in superconducting interface has aroused extensive research interest. However, experimental data to investigate charge transfer on the CuO2 plane and the presence of polarons are still missing. Here we conduct extensive research on the optical and electronic properties of two-dimensional material supported on copper-based superconductors. Unlike monolayer-WSe2 on other substrates, monolayer-WSe2 on La1.85Sr0.15CuO4 (WSe2/LSCO) produces a special band structure. Using high-resolution spectroscopic ellipsometry and density functional theory calculation methods, the special electronic structure can be attributed to the formation of the interfacial small polaron at the WSe2/LSCO interface which is driven by charge transfer between the CuO2 plane of the cuprate superconductor and WSe2. In addition, the structural phase transition of the LSCO substrate was observed to reduce the electron-hole (e-h) interaction of WSe2. These findings may spur future investigations on the effect of the interfacial polaron on the superconductivity of cuprates, and highlight the significant influence of interface effects on the electronic structure of WSe2 films. It provides an effective method to further explore the intrinsic relationship between interfacial polarons and superconductivity."}

Here, we reveal two intertwined phenomena in AlO_x/KTaO_3 heterostructures: a gate-history memory in which progressive electrostatic cycling enhances the superconducting transition temperature, and its complete erasure by light illumination at cryogenic temperatures. These phenomena arise from a previously unrecognized interplay between the superconducting interface and emergent lattice excitations - including polar-nanoregion reorientation and oxygen-vacancy ionization.

The stochastic analytic continuation method is used to determine the dynamic structure factor from correlation functions in imaginary time obtained by QMC. In contrast to the \"roton minimum\" of the square lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet, we find that magnons on the honeycomb lattice completely decay in the corner of the Brillouin zone ($K$-point); the entire weight is shifted into the continuum. These findings are fully supported by SE and CST in momentum space. The extrapolated one-magnon dispersion obtained from SE about the Ising limit quantitatively agrees with the extracted QMC excitation energies except around the $K$-point, where large uncertainties in the extrapolation indicate the magnon decay. This quantum decay is further confirmed and understood by the CST, which yields a divergent flow when enforcing a magnon quasi-particle picture. The divergence originates from strong attractive magnon-magnon interactions leading to a bound state and thereby to a three-magnon continuum overlapping with the one-magnon state. This has the magnon quasi-particle picture break down at high energies on the honeycomb lattice."}

In this paper, we demonstrate the field-free optical control of single stable skyrmions via single femtosecond laser pulses with diameters down to 175 nm, containing a fixed chirality.

It is found that, at zero spin orbit coupling, ferromagnetism only dominates at small values of anisotropy and coupling constant. Larger values of these parameters favour the formation of altermagnetism. At finite spin-orbit coupling, a paramagnetic phase competes with the other two, and a quantum critical point appears. The phase transition from the paramagnetic to the magnetically ordered phases is of second order, while the phase transition between ferromagnet and altermagnet states is first order. The altermagnetic phase is robust under small magnetic fields, displaying a coexistence with a field-induced magnetization."}

While the importance of electron-phonon coupling is understood, a controlled first-principles treatment of Coulomb interaction is lacking. Current ab initio calculations of superconductivity rely on a phenomenological downfolding approximation, replacing Coulomb interaction with a repulsive pseudopotential μ*, and leaving ambiguities in electron-phonon coupling with dynamical Coulomb interactions unresolved. We address this via an effective field theory approach, integrating out high-energy electronic degrees of freedom using variational Diagrammatic Monte Carlo. Applied to the uniform electron gas, this establishes a microscopic procedure to implement downfolding, define the pseudopotential, and express dynamical Coulomb effects on electron-phonon coupling via the electron vertex function. We find the bare pseudopotential significantly larger than conventional values. This yields improved pseudopotential estimates in simple metals and tests density functional perturbation theory accuracy for effective electron-phonon coupling. We present an ab initio workflow computing superconducting Tc from the anomalous vertex's precursory Cooper flow. This infers Tc from normal state calculations, enabling reliable estimates of very low Tc (including near quantum phase transitions) beyond conventional reach. Validating our approach on simple metals without empirical tuning, we resolve long-standing discrepancies and predict a pressure-induced transition in Al from superconducting to non-superconducting above ~60GPa. We propose ambient-pressure Mg and Na are proximal to a similar critical point.

Herein, we characterize the tunable spin and optical properties of intrinsic vacancy defects in titanium trisulfide (TiS3) and niobium trisulfide (NbS3) nanowires. Within our ab initio approach, we show that sulfur vacancies and divacancies (VS and VD , respectively) in TiS3 and NbS3 adopt strain-dependent defect geometries between in-plane strains of -3 % and 3 %. The calculated electronic structures indicate that both VS and VD possess in-gap defect states with optically bright electronic transitions whose position relative to the conduction and valence bands varies with in-plane strain. Further, our calculations predict that VS in TiS3 and VD in NbS3 exhibit transitions in their ground state spins; specifically, a compressive strain of 0.4 % along the direction of nanowire growth causes a shift from a triplet state to a singlet state for the VS defect in TiS3, whereas a tensile strain of 2.9 % along the same direction in NbS3 induces a triplet ground state with a zero-phonon line of 0.83 eV in the VD defect. Our work shows that the anisotropic geometry of TiS3 and NbS3 nanowires offers exceptional tunability of optically active spin defects that can be used in quantum applications."}

Inherent to the Hall measurement geometry, the measured signal is often contaminated by unwanted contributions, so the data must be processed to isolate the Hall response. The standard approach invokes Onsager-Casimir reciprocity and antisymmetrizes the raw signal about zero applied magnetic field. In hysteretic materials this becomes nontrivial, since Onsager-Casimir relations apply only to microscopically reversible states. Incorrect antisymmetrization can lead to artifacts that mimic anomalous or topological Hall signatures. The situation is especially subtle when hysteresis loops are not centered at zero applied field, as in exchange-biased systems. A practical reference for generically extracting the Hall response in hysteretic materials is lacking. Here, using Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ as a bulk single-crystal model that can be prepared with or without exchange-biased hysteresis, we demonstrate two procedures that can be used to extract the Hall effect: (1) reverse-magnetic-field reciprocity and (2) antisymmetrization with respect to applied field. We then measure the Hall effect on CeCoGe$_3$, a noncentrosymmetric antiferromagnet which can be prepared to have asymmetric magnetization and magnetoresistance, and demonstrate how improper processing can generate artificial anomalous Hall signals. These methods are generic and can be applied to any conductor."}

The emitter is coupled to phonon modes of the surrounding bulk semiconductor, described by a super-Ohmic spectral density. We show that the RF spectrum of this system consists of a central elastic line, a broad phonon sideband known from other linear and nonlinear spectra of such systems, as well as a narrow inelastic contribution, which is characteristic of scattering spectra and stems from noise-induced transient dynamics. At moderate phonon couplings or low temperatures, the interplay between the broad sideband and the inelastic feature leads to a Fano-like profile near the resonant energy with the Fano parameter determined by laser detuning. In the weak-coupling limit (where only single-phonon processes are included), the spectrum becomes an exact Fano shape and resonant light scattering is entirely suppressed. The amplitude of this spectral feature grows linearly with temperature, while its width depends solely on the spontaneous emission rate of the emitter. We relate the quantum character of the reservoir to the non-commutativity of noise observables and show that Fano resonance persists in the classical limit. We also discuss how the redistribution of optical coupling efficiency between the central line and the sidebands affects the total scattering rate under various excitation conditions."}

While separator design is crucial for optimizing battery performance, its potential remains underexplored. The commonly used glass fiber (GF) filters were not originally designed as battery separators. To address their limitations, nanochitin derived from waste shrimp shells was used to fabricate separators with varying concentrations of amine and carboxylic functional groups. This study investigates how the type and concentration of these groups influence the separator's properties and performance. In a mild acidic electrolyte that protonates the amine groups, the results showed that the density of both ammonium and carboxylic groups in the separators significantly affected water structure and ionic conductivity. Quasi-Elastic Neutron Scattering (QENS) revealed that low-functionalized chitin, particularly with only ammonium groups, promotes strongly bound water with restricted mobility, thereby enhancing Zn plating and stripping kinetics. These separators exhibit exceptional Zn stability over 2000 hours at low current densities (0.5 mA/cm2), maintaining low overpotentials and stable polarization. Additionally, the full cell consisting of Zn||NaV3O8.1.5H2O showed a cycle life of over 2000 cycles at 2 A/g, demonstrating the compatibility of the nanochitin-based separators with low concentrations of functional surface groups.

Here, we demonstrate in-situ control over the dominant EDSR driving mechanism of a hole-spin qubit in a silicon fin field-effect transistor by applying microwave signals to two different gate electrodes, thereby tuning the orientation of the local electric field. We measure the effective g-factor, its electrical tunability, and the Rabi frequency as functions of magnetic-field orientation. Their distinct angular dependencies, analyzed using a g-matrix formalism, allow us to identify the underlying driving processes and track their relative contributions for different drive configurations. By selecting the drive electrode, we can switch from a regime dominated by g-factor modulation to one with a strong contribution from wavefunction displacement. This in-situ tunability provides direct experimental access to both spin-driving mechanisms and offers a route toward optimized spin-qubit performance."}

Here, we investigate the magnetic states over a wide field temperature phase space in the high-Tc ferromagnet Fe5GeTe2 using magnetization, ferromagnetic resonance (FMR), and magneto-transport measurements. Our findings reveal a magnetic phase transition from a collinear to a complex non-collinear magnetic order near the temperature T* = 160 K, below which magnetic susceptibility is reduced, FMR linewidth broadened, and anomalous Hall resistivity suppressed. Such non-collinearity results from the competition between magnetocrystalline anisotropy and Dzyaloshinskii Moriya interaction arising from the unusual Fe1 ordering in two possible split sites.

Our calculation indicates that spin-fluctuation-driven pairing correlations are weak for the stoichiometric case at ambient pressure, but increase significantly under hole doping. The leading pairing symmetry is also found to change by hole doping.

The dye N1 using triphenylamine group as donor and p-ethynylbenzoic acid group as acceptor, showed optimum optoelectronic properties ($ΔG{reg}=-9.73$ eV, $ΔG{inj}=7.18$ eV, $V_{OC}=1.47$ V and $J_{SC}=15.03$ mA/cm$^2$) with highest PCE 14.37%, making it the best studied dye. This newly modified organic dye with enhanced PCE is remarkably effective for the dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC) industry. Beyond materials discovery, this study highlights the role of high-performance computing in enabling predictive screening of dye candidates and generating performance indicators (HOMO-LUMO gaps, absorption spectra, charge transfer free energies, photovoltaic metrics). These outputs can serve as key parameters for energy informatics and system modelling."}

Here, we show that ScAlN films (with x spanning 0.18 to 0.36) contain nanoscale Sc-rich clusters which maintain the wurtzite crystal structure. While both molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and sputter deposited Sc0.3Al0.7N films show Sc clustering, the degree of clustering is significantly stronger for the MBE-grown film, offering an explanation for some of the discrepancies between MBE-grown and sputtered films reported in the literature. Moreover, the MBE-grown Sc0.3Al0.7N film exhibits a dispersive and anomalously large dielectric permittivity, roughly double that of sputtered Sc0.3Al0.7N. We attribute this result to the Sc-rich clusters locally reaching x ~ 0.5 and approaching the predicted ferroelectric-to-paraelectric phase transition, resulting in a giant (local) enhancement in permittivity. The Sc-rich clusters should similarly affect the piezoelectric, optical, and ferroelectric responses, suggesting cluster-engineering as a means to tailor ScAlNs functional properties."}

Modeled by chemical master equations, these processes are inherently stochastic, as fluctuations dominate deterministic order at mesoscopic scales. These classic many-body processes suffer from the so-called curse of high dimensionality, which makes exact mathematical descriptions exponentially expensive to compute. The exponential cost renders the study of the thermodynamic properties of such systems out of equilibrium intractable and forces approximations of system noise or assumptions of continuous particle numbers. Here, we use tensor networks to numerically explore the thermodynamics of chemical processes by directly solving the ensemble solution of the chemical master equation with efficient (sub-exponential) computational cost. We provide accurate estimates of the entropy production rate, heat flux, chemical work, and nonequilibrium thermodynamic potentials, free from sampling errors or mean-field approximations. We illustrate our results through a dissipative self-assembly model. In this way, we show how tensor networks can inform the design of efficient chemical processes in previously unattainable regimes."}

B 97, 024514 (2018)] within the first-principles calculations based on multiple scattering theory and the screened Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker (SKKR) Green's function method. In our calculations, we first study the normal-state density of states (DOS) in the single- and double-Mn-layer heterostructures, and calculate the induced magnetic moments in the Nb layers. Next, we compute the momentum-resolved spectral functions in the superconducting state for the heterostructure with a single Mn layer, and find bands crossing the Fermi level within the superconducting (SC) gap. We also study the SC state DOS in the single- and double-Mn-layer heterostructures and compare some of our results with experimental findings, revealing secondary gaps, plateau-like regions, and central V-shaped in-gap states within the bulk SC Nb gap that are magnetic-order-dependent. Finally, we compute the singlet and internally antisymmetric triplet (IAT) order parameters for each layer for both heterostructures, and find an order of magnitude difference in the induced singlet part of the SC order parameter in the Mn layer/s between the FM and AFM cases in favor of the AFM pairing with the maximum still being only 4.44% of the bulk Nb singlet order parameter value. We also find a negligible induced triplet part, yet comparable to the induced singlet values, indicating some singlet-triplet mixing in the Mn layer/s."}

Though this classical quantity is now well-understood in various scenarios, little is known if the diffusivity depends on the location of the particle. For such heterogeneous diffusion, an ambiguity arises in interpreting the stochastic process, which reflects the well-known Itô versus Stratonovich controversy. Here we analytically determine the mean escape time and splitting probabilities for an arbitrary heterogeneous diffusion in an arbitrary three-dimensional domain with small targets that can be perfectly or imperfectly absorbing. Our analysis reveals general principles for how search depends on heterogeneous diffusion and its interpretation (e.g. Itô, Stratonovich, or kinetic). An intricate picture emerges in which, for instance, increasing the diffusivity can decrease, not affect, or even increase the escape time. Our results could be used to determine the appropriate interpretation for specific physical systems."}

By increasing the effective electron dipole, flopping mode qubits can provide faster gates with smaller field gradients. Moreover, operating in the strong-driving limit can reduce their sensitivity to charge noise. However, alloy disorder in Si/SiGe heterostructures randomizes the valley energy splitting and the valley phase difference between dots, enhancing the probably of valley excitations while tunneling between the dots, and opening a leakage channel. In this work, we analyze the performance of flopping mode spin qubits in the presence of charge noise and alloy disorder, and we optimize these qubits for a variety of valley configurations, in both weak and strong charge-noise regimes. When the charge noise is weak, high fidelity qubits can be implemented across a wide range of valley parameters, provided the electronic pulse is fine-tuned for a given valley configuration. When the charge noise is strong, high-fidelity pulses can still be engineered, provided the valley splittings in each dot are relatively large and the valley phase difference is relatively small. We analyze how charge noise-induced fluctuations of the inter-dot detuning, as well as small shifts in other qubit parameters, impact qubit fidelities. We find that strongly driven pulses are less sensitive to detuning fluctuations but more sensitive to small shifts in the valley parameters, which can actually dominate the qubit infidelities in some regimes. Finally, we discuss schemes to tune devices away from poor-performing configurations, enhancing the scalability of flopping-mode-based qubit architectures."}

By refining values of the magnetic interaction parameters to magnetic diffuse-scattering data measured above the magnetic ordering transition temperature, we show that the dominant magnetic coupling in UO$_2$ is a bond-dependent interaction analogous to the Kitaev model of honeycomb magnets. We compare our experimental results with published theoretical predictions and experimental measurements of the magnetic excitation spectrum. Our results suggest that magnetic materials with $f$-electron magnetic ions, particularly actinides, may be promising candidates for realising Kitaev magnetism, and highlight the role that magnetic diffuse-scattering data can play in identifying such materials."}

In the linear optical response, in contrast, single-particle and collective-mode contributions overlap. With increasing electron-phonon coupling, the amplitude mode contribution to 2DCS initially remains robust, but then drops rapidly and remains small in the phonon-dominated regime -- even in systems with large order parameter. 2DCS also aids the detection of the massive relative phase mode, which is analogous to the Leggett mode in superconductors. Our analysis, based on the time-dependent Hartree-Fock approach, demonstrates that 2DCS can track the emergence of the symmetry-broken state and the crossover from Coulomb-driven to phonon-driven order."}

In this Perspective, we distill two design principles behind the Latent Ewald Summation (LES) framework, which can capture long-range interactions, charges, and electrical response just by learning from standard energy and force training data: (i) use a Coulomb functional form with environment-dependent charges to capture electrostatic interactions, and (ii) avoid explicit training on ambiguous density functional theory (DFT) partial charges. When both principles are satisfied, substantial flexibility remains: essentially any short-range MLIP can be augmented; charge equilibration schemes can be added when desired; dipoles and Born effective charges can be inferred or finetuned; and charge/spin-state embeddings or tensorial targets can be further incorporated. We also discuss current limitations and open challenges. Together, these minimal, physics-guided design rules suggest that incorporating long-range electrostatics into MLIPs is simpler and perhaps more broadly applicable than is commonly assumed."}

However, direct experimental observations of interfacial thermal conductance across molecular junctions have remained challenging due to the high spatiotemporal resolution required for probing. Here, we report dynamic energy transport processes across multi-component molecular junctions observed at the atomic level by employing reflection ultrafast electron diffraction. A clear temporal sequence of energy transfer is revealed at early times following photoexcitation of Au(111) surfaces chemically bonded with self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of alkanethiols: from the gold surface layer (SL) to the head groups of a SAM and then to the CH2-CH2 methylene lattice. Remarkably, the structural dynamics of the gold SL differ significantly from those of clean gold. Furthermore, the methylene lattice dynamics exhibit chain-length insensitivity but with a length-dependent retention time to reach full thermalization. Quantitatively, we find an agreement in the increased out-of-plane atomic motions between the surface gold atoms and the SAM methylene units, signifying the nature of motion-based coupling for interfacial energy transport. High interfacial thermal conductance (~300 MW/m^2/K) and high thermal conductivity for the methylene lattice (~60 W/m/K) are obtained under the condition of impulsive heating, which provide strong support for previous room-temperature theoretical predictions and also the ballistic nature of intrachain heat transfer. This time- and spatially-resolved experimental approach will enable future quantitative assessment of interfacial energy transport across solid-molecule junctions."}

We compute ground-state photonic observables including photon number fluctuations, second-order correlations, and quadrature variances, and find squeezing and super-Poissonian photon statistics emerging from light-matter interactions in the strong coupling regime. Our results demonstrate that capturing the full hierarchy of many-body, electron-photon and multi-photon correlations is essential for a consistent description of quantum-optical properties in strongly coupled molecular systems, establishing QEDFT as a first-principles framework for predicting nonclassical photonic features in the ground state of complex systems."}
