A central element of this theory is the configurational entropy, Sc, which is traditionally represented by a symmetric Gaussian distribution. However, the asymmetric nature of the potential energy of inherent structures, Eis, poses a challenge to such a representation across wide regions of configurational space. In addition, the Gaussian distribution fails to represent fragile to strong transition, FST, observed in various fluids. In this work, we demonstrate that an asymmetric distribution, specifically the Gamma distribution, provides effective description of both Sc and Eis over broad ranges of density and temperature, T. The FST is interpreted through shifts of the Eis distribution and the curvature change of the Eis vs 1/T relation. In terms of energy changes, the FST is comparable to a liquid-liquid phase transition. Moreover, the revised PEL framework yields an equation of state that incorporates a singular term diverging at a glassy or jammed state, an important feature for accurately describing the pressure behavior of these systems."}

At intermediate pressures, inside the nematic phase, the resistivity displays an upturn in zero magnetic field, which is significantly enhanced in the magnetic field, suggesting the stabilization of a spin-density wave phase, which competes with superconductivity. At higher pressures, beyond the nematic phase boundaries, the resistivity no longer displays any clear anomalies in the zero magnetic field, but an external magnetic field induces significant upturns in resistivity reflecting a field-induced order, where superconductivity and magnetic anomalies are enhanced in tandem.

To strike a balance between ansatz complexity and computational stability in VQE calculations, we propose the HiUCCSD, a novel symmetry-respecting ansatz engineered from the intrinsic information of the Hamiltonian. We theoretically prove the effectiveness of HiUCCSD within the scope of Abelian point groups. Furthermore, we compare the performance of HiUCCSD and the established SymUCCSD via VQE and Adaptive Derivative-Assembled Pseudo-Trotter (ADAPT)-VQE numerical experiments on ten molecules with distinct point groups. The results show that HiUCCSD achieves equivalent performance to SymUCCSD for Abelian point group molecules, while avoiding the potential performance failure of SymUCCSD in the case of non-Abelian point group molecules. Across the studied molecular systems, HiUCCSD cuts the parameter count by 18%-83% for VQE and reduces the excitation operator pool size by 27%-84% for ADAPT-VQE, as compared with the UCCSD ansatz. With enhanced robustness and broader applicability, HiUCCSD offers a new ansatz option for advancing large-scale molecular VQE implementation."}

Here, we examine how the topologically quantized charge pump in insulators generates spin polarizations, and assess whether this mechanism may offer distinct insight into the widely known spin-selective transport in chiral wires-commonly referred to as chirality-induced spin selectivity. We performed time-dependent Schrodinger equations of multi-orbital tight-binding Hamiltonians driven by a circularly polarized electric field. Our main findings are twofold. First, the intrinsic screw-like geometry of the system generates a distinctive winding structure governed by a single control parameter, in contrast to conventional adiabatic pumping mechanisms that require at least two independently modulated parameters, thereby providing a clear interpretation of one-dimensional pumping in terms of the topological structure in a (1+1)-dimensional Brillouin zone. Second, while the energy gap remains open throughout the pumping cycle, the Berry-phase driven real-time dynamics of the charge flow induces a nonequilibrium orbital polarization. Through spin-orbit coupling, this orbital response is partially converted into spin polarization whose direction is determined by the current and chirality. On the analogy between the synthetic (1+1)- and 2-dimensional topological insulators, we suggest that non-trivial spin-orbital dynamics may accompany the anomalous quantum charge Hall states of even-dimensional real materials."}

What controls the quantum efficiency of electroluminescent single-polymers", "comment": null, "summary": "Since the first evidence of luminescence of organic polymers in STM junctions, efforts have been invested in elucidating how to leverage the voltage, anchoring chemistry, and molecular structure to optimize emission power and efficiency. Understanding the fundamentals underlying current-driven molecular emission is important not only for OLED engineering, but also to control luminescence at the atomic scale toward the mastering of single or localized photon sources. However, the difficulty in isolating the separate roles of the variables at play in molecular junction experiments, has precluded a general comprehension of their distinctive effects on the emitted power and the quantum yield. In the present report, we use time-dependent electronic structure simulations based on quantum electrodynamics to disentangle the incidence of bias, electronic coupling and molecular length on device performance, with polyphenylene-vinylene as a case study. A careful validation demonstrates that our approach can achieve quantitative agreement with available experimental data. Through its application we identify the applied bias as the main factor determining emission power. The quantum efficiency, however, is influenced only minimally by bias and electronic coupling, and is instead dominated by polymer length, on which it depends exponentially. Thus, using longer polymer chains emerges as the primary strategy for achieving higher efficiencies. Our results thereby provide key prescriptions for designing single-molecule electroluminescent platforms."}

We show that two typical scenarios occur. In the first one, the distribution of the entanglement spectrum levels is similar to the one describing the ground-state entanglement spectrum in Conformal Field Theories. In the second scenario, the lower levels of the entanglement spectrum are highly degenerate and their distribution is given by a series of Dirac deltas.

For AGNRs with $R_1$-type unit cells, the ES numbers under a longitudinal electric field follow the relations $N = N_{A(B)} \\times 6 + 1$ and $N = N_{A(B)} \\times 6 + 3$, whereas $R_2$-type unit cells exhibit $(N_{A(B)} + 1)$ ESs. The subscripts $A$ and $B$ denote the chirality types of the ESs. The Stark effect lifts ES degeneracy and enables clear spectral separation between ESs and IFs. Using a real-space bulk boundary perturbation approach, we show that opposite-chirality states hybridize through junction-site perturbations and may shift out of the bulk gap. The number and chirality of IFs in symmetric AGNRHs are determined by the difference between the ESs of the outer and central segments, $N_O$ and $N_C$, according to $N_{IF,β} = |N_{O,B(A)} - N_{C,A(B)}|$, where $β$ labels the chirality. Depending on whether $N_O > N_C$ or $N_C > N_O$, the resulting IFs acquire B- or A-chirality, respectively. Calculated transmission spectra ${\\cal T}_{GNR}(\\varepsilon)$ reveal that AGNRHs host a topological double quantum dot (TDQD) when IFs originate from the ESs of the central AGNR segment. Using an Anderson model with effective intra-dot and inter-dot Coulomb interactions, we derive an analytical expression for the tunneling current through the TDQD via a closed-form transmission coefficient. Thermoelectric analysis shows that TDQDs yield enhanced nonlinear power output in the electron-dilute and hole-dilute charge states, with Coulomb blockade suppressing thermal current but not thermal voltage."}

What controls the quantum efficiency of electroluminescent single-polymers", "comment": null, "summary": "Since the first evidence of luminescence of organic polymers in STM junctions, efforts have been invested in elucidating how to leverage the voltage, anchoring chemistry, and molecular structure to optimize emission power and efficiency. Understanding the fundamentals underlying current-driven molecular emission is important not only for OLED engineering, but also to control luminescence at the atomic scale toward the mastering of single or localized photon sources. However, the difficulty in isolating the separate roles of the variables at play in molecular junction experiments, has precluded a general comprehension of their distinctive effects on the emitted power and the quantum yield. In the present report, we use time-dependent electronic structure simulations based on quantum electrodynamics to disentangle the incidence of bias, electronic coupling and molecular length on device performance, with polyphenylene-vinylene as a case study. A careful validation demonstrates that our approach can achieve quantitative agreement with available experimental data. Through its application we identify the applied bias as the main factor determining emission power. The quantum efficiency, however, is influenced only minimally by bias and electronic coupling, and is instead dominated by polymer length, on which it depends exponentially. Thus, using longer polymer chains emerges as the primary strategy for achieving higher efficiencies. Our results thereby provide key prescriptions for designing single-molecule electroluminescent platforms."}

A central element of this theory is the configurational entropy, Sc, which is traditionally represented by a symmetric Gaussian distribution. However, the asymmetric nature of the potential energy of inherent structures, Eis, poses a challenge to such a representation across wide regions of configurational space. In addition, the Gaussian distribution fails to represent fragile to strong transition, FST, observed in various fluids. In this work, we demonstrate that an asymmetric distribution, specifically the Gamma distribution, provides effective description of both Sc and Eis over broad ranges of density and temperature, T. The FST is interpreted through shifts of the Eis distribution and the curvature change of the Eis vs 1/T relation. In terms of energy changes, the FST is comparable to a liquid-liquid phase transition. Moreover, the revised PEL framework yields an equation of state that incorporates a singular term diverging at a glassy or jammed state, an important feature for accurately describing the pressure behavior of these systems."}

The results demonstrate that under realistic energy parameters the interaction between oxygen vacancies and impurities generally has a greater impact on the studied properties than inter-vacancy correlations. The influence of inter-vacancy interaction significantly depends on dopant content x: inter-site vacancy repulsion becomes noticeable at sufficiently high x, whereas on-site Fermi-type correlations can be pronounced within a narrow doping range at moderate x values. It is found that a non-uniform impurity allocation, which can result from a sample preparation procedure, considerably affects oxygen-vacancy distribution, and has a weaker effect on short-range order and oxidation. It is also shown that inter-defect interaction reduces the hole concentration, increases the oxidation enthalpy, and can result in their non-trivial dependence on x. The findings of this study contribute to understanding the fundamental properties of acceptor-doped oxides, facilitating the development of new materials for clean energy applications."}

While higher-order topological phases (HOTPs) host boundary states at corners or hinges, their characterization has largely relied on Abelian invariants such as winding and Chern numbers. Here, we propose a coupled-wire scheme of constructing non-Abelian HOTPs and analyze a non-Abelian second-order topological insulator as its minimal model. The resulting Hamiltonian supports hybridized corner modes, protected by parity-time-reversal plus sublattice symmetries and described by a topological vector that unites a non-Abelian quaternion charge with an Abelian winding number. Corner states emerge only when both invariants are nontrivial, whereas weak topological edge states of non-Abelian origins arise when the quaternion charge is nontrivial, enriching the bulk-edge-corner correspondence. The system further exhibits both non-Abelian and Abelian topological phase transitions, providing a unified platform that bridges these two distinct topological classes. Our work extends the understanding of HOTPs into non-Abelian regimes and suggests feasible experimental realizations in synthetic quantum systems, such as photonic or acoustic metamaterials."}

Our results provide evidence that both AFM- and FM-KSL regimes acquire finite parameter widths in the spin-1 model, while the Haldane phase is fragile against Kitaev-type anisotropy, particularly for $D_z<0$. Increasing (decreasing) $D_z$ suppresses (enhances) magnetic order and expands (shrinks) the KSL and other magnetically disordered sectors.

The small energy differences between candidate spin orders make theoretical studies less reliable, and probing magnetic order at a nonzero wave vector is experimentally challenging. In modern realizations of Wigner crystals, the electronic spin degree of freedom is often replaced by a valley pseudospin associated with nonzero Berry curvature. The resulting anomalous velocity couples the electrons' pseudospin texture to their orbital vibration. We show that this mechanism enables optical detection of pseudospin orders in Wigner crystals by producing sharp signatures in the terahertz optical conductivity. For example, antiferromagnetic pseudospin order enables light to excite collective electronic vibrations at the ordering wave vector, generating a characteristic absorption peak. Based on the same principle, we further show that a strong optical drive generates an effective potential that reshapes the pseudospin energy landscape, inducing phase transitions to stripe antiferromagnetic states. These results point to a route for optical detection and control of spin order via its coupling to orbital motion."}

Here, using ab initio quantum mechanical calculations we show how different forms of Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), a widely used organic semiconductor, interact with graphene. We analyze the effects of molecular chain length, end-group termination, periodicity, and the distinction between ordered and random P3HT arrangements. For isolated P3HT, the band gap decreases with increasing chain length and layer thickness, while structural disorder leads to slightly larger gaps due to reduced electronic coupling. When P3HT is deposited on graphene, all configurations exhibit spontaneous charge transfer, with electrons accumulating on graphene and holes remaining in the polymer. This effect is significantly enhanced in ordered and fully periodic structures and is noticeably weaker in disordered ones. Charge density analyses further show that thicker and more ordered P3HT layers improve electron hole separation across the interface. Our results reveal how molecular structure governs charge transfer in P3HT-graphene heterojunctions and provide practical guidelines for designing high efficiency polymer-graphene photovoltaic devices."}

Here, we examine how the topologically quantized charge pump in insulators generates spin polarizations, and assess whether this mechanism may offer distinct insight into the widely known spin-selective transport in chiral wires-commonly referred to as chirality-induced spin selectivity. We performed time-dependent Schrodinger equations of multi-orbital tight-binding Hamiltonians driven by a circularly polarized electric field. Our main findings are twofold. First, the intrinsic screw-like geometry of the system generates a distinctive winding structure governed by a single control parameter, in contrast to conventional adiabatic pumping mechanisms that require at least two independently modulated parameters, thereby providing a clear interpretation of one-dimensional pumping in terms of the topological structure in a (1+1)-dimensional Brillouin zone. Second, while the energy gap remains open throughout the pumping cycle, the Berry-phase driven real-time dynamics of the charge flow induces a nonequilibrium orbital polarization. Through spin-orbit coupling, this orbital response is partially converted into spin polarization whose direction is determined by the current and chirality. On the analogy between the synthetic (1+1)- and 2-dimensional topological insulators, we suggest that non-trivial spin-orbital dynamics may accompany the anomalous quantum charge Hall states of even-dimensional real materials."}

Due to limitations of experimental technology and computational methods, the exploration of the continuous evolution of clusters towards nanocrystal is still a big challenge. Here, we proposed a machine learning force field (MLFF) that can generalize well to various copper systems ranging from small clusters to large clusters and bulk. The continuous evolution of copper clusters CuN towards nanocrystal was revealed by investigating clusters in a wide size range (7 <= N <= 17885) based on MLFF simulated annealing. For small CuN (N < 40), electron counting rule plays a major role in stability. For large CuN (N > 80), geometric magic number rule plays a dominant role and the evolution of clusters is based on the formation of more and more icosahedral shells. For medium size CuN (40 <= N <= 80), both rules contribute. The critical size from cluster to nanocrystal was calculated to be around 8000 atoms (about 6 nm in diameter).

The ML technique successfully identified several high SHC candidates with the best candidate exhibiting a SHC of 271.52 (hbar/e) Ohm^-1, nearly 23 times higher than the top performer in the initial round. Beyond candidate discovery, several features such as orbital symmetry near the Fermi energy, types of atomic species, material composition, covalent radii, and electronegativity of constituent atoms were found to play critical role in shaping the spin Hall response in 2D systems. The data generated is made publicly available to facilitate further advances in 2D spintronics."}

We identify four magnetically ordered phases -- FM-$z$, FM-$xy$, Néel-$z$, and a two-sublattice collinear LLRR2 state -- as well as magnetically disordered/critical regimes including Néel-$xy$, LLRR1, and two Kitaev spin-liquid (KSL) regions. A topological Haldane phase also emerges near the Heisenberg limit. Our results provide evidence that both AFM- and FM-KSL regimes acquire finite parameter widths in the spin-1 model, while the Haldane phase is fragile against Kitaev-type anisotropy, particularly for $D_z<0$. Increasing (decreasing) $D_z$ suppresses (enhances) magnetic order and expands (shrinks) the KSL and other magnetically disordered sectors. Also, at $D_z=0$, we identify an exactly solvable point at $φ=\\tan^{-1}(-2)$, which enforces a first-order transition between Néel-$z$ and LLRR2.

Leveraging the recently developed MatterSim interatomic potential, which achieves DFT-level accuracy in phonon predictions across more than 10,000 materials, PhononBench enables efficient large-scale phonon calculations and dynamical-stability analysis for 108,843 crystal structures generated by six leading crystal generation models. PhononBench reveals a widespread limitation of current generative models in ensuring dynamical stability: the average dynamical-stability rate across all generated structures is only 25.83%, with the top-performing model, MatterGen, reaching just 41.0%. Further case studies show that in property-targeted generation-illustrated here by band-gap conditioning with MatterGen--the dynamical-stability rate remains as low as 23.5% even at the optimal band-gap condition of 0.5 eV. In space-group-controlled generation, higher-symmetry crystals exhibit better stability (e.g., cubic systems achieve rates up to 49.2%), yet the average stability across all controlled generations is still only 34.4%. An important additional outcome of this study is the identification of 28,119 crystal structures that are phonon-stable across the entire Brillouin zone, providing a substantial pool of reliable candidates for future materials exploration. By establishing the first large-scale dynamical-stability benchmark, this work systematically highlights the current limitations of crystal generation models and offers essential evaluation criteria and guidance for their future development toward the design and discovery of physically viable materials.

Results demonstrate that oxidized phosphorene exhibits greater stability than its pristine counterpart and shows higher adhesion to all substrates, attributed to favorable interactions between oxygen non-bonding states and substrate empty states. Adhesion is systematically more favorable on pristine metals than on their corresponding oxides, with chromium and iron showing particularly strong interactions due to partially filled 3d orbitals. This result is consistent with the coefficient of friction decrease observed in tribological experiments after scratching the substrate, thus removing the outermost oxide layer. Charge redistribution and electronic structure analyses reveal system-dependent interfacial bonding characteristics, with some configurations inducing metallic character in phosphorene.

Due to limitations of experimental technology and computational methods, the exploration of the continuous evolution of clusters towards nanocrystal is still a big challenge. Here, we proposed a machine learning force field (MLFF) that can generalize well to various copper systems ranging from small clusters to large clusters and bulk. The continuous evolution of copper clusters CuN towards nanocrystal was revealed by investigating clusters in a wide size range (7 <= N <= 17885) based on MLFF simulated annealing. For small CuN (N < 40), electron counting rule plays a major role in stability. For large CuN (N > 80), geometric magic number rule plays a dominant role and the evolution of clusters is based on the formation of more and more icosahedral shells. For medium size CuN (40 <= N <= 80), both rules contribute. The critical size from cluster to nanocrystal was calculated to be around 8000 atoms (about 6 nm in diameter).

The small energy differences between candidate spin orders make theoretical studies less reliable, and probing magnetic order at a nonzero wave vector is experimentally challenging. In modern realizations of Wigner crystals, the electronic spin degree of freedom is often replaced by a valley pseudospin associated with nonzero Berry curvature. The resulting anomalous velocity couples the electrons' pseudospin texture to their orbital vibration. We show that this mechanism enables optical detection of pseudospin orders in Wigner crystals by producing sharp signatures in the terahertz optical conductivity. For example, antiferromagnetic pseudospin order enables light to excite collective electronic vibrations at the ordering wave vector, generating a characteristic absorption peak. Based on the same principle, we further show that a strong optical drive generates an effective potential that reshapes the pseudospin energy landscape, inducing phase transitions to stripe antiferromagnetic states. These results point to a route for optical detection and control of spin order via its coupling to orbital motion."}

For AGNRs with $R_1$-type unit cells, the ES numbers under a longitudinal electric field follow the relations $N = N_{A(B)} \\times 6 + 1$ and $N = N_{A(B)} \\times 6 + 3$, whereas $R_2$-type unit cells exhibit $(N_{A(B)} + 1)$ ESs. The subscripts $A$ and $B$ denote the chirality types of the ESs. The Stark effect lifts ES degeneracy and enables clear spectral separation between ESs and IFs. Using a real-space bulk boundary perturbation approach, we show that opposite-chirality states hybridize through junction-site perturbations and may shift out of the bulk gap. The number and chirality of IFs in symmetric AGNRHs are determined by the difference between the ESs of the outer and central segments, $N_O$ and $N_C$, according to $N_{IF,β} = |N_{O,B(A)} - N_{C,A(B)}|$, where $β$ labels the chirality. Depending on whether $N_O > N_C$ or $N_C > N_O$, the resulting IFs acquire B- or A-chirality, respectively. Calculated transmission spectra ${\\cal T}_{GNR}(\\varepsilon)$ reveal that AGNRHs host a topological double quantum dot (TDQD) when IFs originate from the ESs of the central AGNR segment. Using an Anderson model with effective intra-dot and inter-dot Coulomb interactions, we derive an analytical expression for the tunneling current through the TDQD via a closed-form transmission coefficient. Thermoelectric analysis shows that TDQDs yield enhanced nonlinear power output in the electron-dilute and hole-dilute charge states, with Coulomb blockade suppressing thermal current but not thermal voltage."}

The complete version of Abstract is shown in PDF", "summary": "Here we provide a microscopic lattice construction of excitations, fusion, and shrinking in a non-Abelian topological order by studying the three-dimensional quantum double model. We explicitly construct lattice operators that create, fuse, and shrink particle and loop excitations, systematically derive their fusion and shrinking rules, and demonstrate that non-Abelian shrinking channels can be controllably selected through internal degrees of freedom of loop operators. Most importantly, we show that the lattice shrinking rules obey the fusion--shrinking consistency relations predicted by twisted $BF$ field theory, providing solid evidence for the validity of field-theoretical principles developed over the past years. In particular, we compute the full set of excitations, fusion, and shrinking data at the microscopic lattice level and verify exact agreement between the microscopic $\\mathbb{D}_4$ quantum double lattice model and the continuum $BF$ field theory with an $AAB$ twist and $(\\mathbb{Z}_2)^3$ gauge group, thereby placing the latter field theory, originally discovered in 2018 in connection with Borromean-ring braiding, on a solid microscopic footing. Our results bridge continuum topological field theory and exactly solvable lattice models, elevate fusion--shrinking consistency from a continuum field-theoretical principle to a genuine topological phenomenon defined at the microscopic lattice scale, and provide a concrete microscopic foundation for experimentally engineering higher-dimensional non-Abelian topological orders in controllable quantum simulators, such as trapped-ion systems."}

Here, we investigate polarons in insulating single-layer MnBr$_2$ grown by molecular beam epitaxy on three different substrates, namely graphene on Ir(110), graphene on Ir(111), and Au(111). The number densities and species of polarons observed vary strongly as a function of the substrate. For MnBr$_2$ grown on Ir(110) the largest number of polaron species is observed, namely four, of which three show clear similarities with the species observed for CoCl$_2$ on graphite. Polarons in single-layer MnBr$_2$ are observed up to 300K. They can be created, converted, and moved by the STM tip when a tunneling current flows at a proper bias voltage. For graphene on Ir(110) as a substrate, mobile polarons in MnBr$_2$ are guided through the periodic potential imposed from the super-moiré resulting from the interaction of MnBr$_2$ with graphene and Ir(110). Our findings indicate that modeling of polarons in such single-layer insulators in contact with a conducting substrate requires to take the substrate explicitly into account."}

Particular emphasis is placed on Heusler systems in which half-metallic ferromagnetism and spin-gapless semiconductor state are realized. Although these compounds are crystallographically rather \"ordinary\", peculiarities of their electronic structure and magnetic state lead to unconventional kinetic and magnetic properties. Their magnetic and transport characteristics are highly sensitive to external stimuli, and changes in alloy composition or external parameters can induce transitions between the states considered. This tunability provides further opportunities for controlling the electronic and magnetic properties of Heusler alloys and for exploiting them in applications such as spintronics and micro- and nanoelectronics."}

While higher-order topological phases (HOTPs) host boundary states at corners or hinges, their characterization has largely relied on Abelian invariants such as winding and Chern numbers. Here, we propose a coupled-wire scheme of constructing non-Abelian HOTPs and analyze a non-Abelian second-order topological insulator as its minimal model. The resulting Hamiltonian supports hybridized corner modes, protected by parity-time-reversal plus sublattice symmetries and described by a topological vector that unites a non-Abelian quaternion charge with an Abelian winding number. Corner states emerge only when both invariants are nontrivial, whereas weak topological edge states of non-Abelian origins arise when the quaternion charge is nontrivial, enriching the bulk-edge-corner correspondence. The system further exhibits both non-Abelian and Abelian topological phase transitions, providing a unified platform that bridges these two distinct topological classes. Our work extends the understanding of HOTPs into non-Abelian regimes and suggests feasible experimental realizations in synthetic quantum systems, such as photonic or acoustic metamaterials."}

The flat-band system offers the paradigmatic platform where quantum geometry plays the essential role in correlated electron phases. However, systems that suffer from significant effects of quantum geometry are not limited to flat-band systems; dispersive-band systems also exhibit quantum condensed phases driven by quantum geometry.

Leveraging the recently developed MatterSim interatomic potential, which achieves DFT-level accuracy in phonon predictions across more than 10,000 materials, PhononBench enables efficient large-scale phonon calculations and dynamical-stability analysis for 108,843 crystal structures generated by six leading crystal generation models. PhononBench reveals a widespread limitation of current generative models in ensuring dynamical stability: the average dynamical-stability rate across all generated structures is only 25.83%, with the top-performing model, MatterGen, reaching just 41.0%. Further case studies show that in property-targeted generation-illustrated here by band-gap conditioning with MatterGen--the dynamical-stability rate remains as low as 23.5% even at the optimal band-gap condition of 0.5 eV. In space-group-controlled generation, higher-symmetry crystals exhibit better stability (e.g., cubic systems achieve rates up to 49.2%), yet the average stability across all controlled generations is still only 34.4%. An important additional outcome of this study is the identification of 28,119 crystal structures that are phonon-stable across the entire Brillouin zone, providing a substantial pool of reliable candidates for future materials exploration. By establishing the first large-scale dynamical-stability benchmark, this work systematically highlights the current limitations of crystal generation models and offers essential evaluation criteria and guidance for their future development toward the design and discovery of physically viable materials. All model-generated crystal structures, phonon calculation results, and the high-throughput evaluation workflows developed in PhononBench will be openly released at https://github.com/xqh19970407/PhononBench"}

The model provides, for the first time, a unified description of magnetic relaxation from weakly to strongly interacting regimes, culminating in a spin-glass transition. It accounts for both the decrease and increase of the relaxation time with growing dipolar coupling, a long-standing problem in nanoparticle magnetism, as classical phenomenological models fail to elucidate this transition. This result also offers an innovative interpretation of the cut-off temperature, $T_{cut-off}$, as a spin glass transition under the Tsallis distribution framework within the context of Néel-Brown's relaxation theory, thereby contributing to ongoing scientific discussions regarding this phenomenon."}

However, recent experimental investigations reveal complex substrate-dependent behavior that affects their lubricating capabilities. This computational study employs density functional theory calculations to quantify the adhesion energy of both pristine and oxidized phosphorene monolayers on various metallic substrates (aluminum, copper, iron, and chromium) and their corresponding oxides ($\\mathrm{Al_2O_3}$, $\\mathrm{Cu_2O}$, $\\mathrm{Fe_2O_3}$, and $\\mathrm{Cr_2O_3}$), correlating these fundamental interactions with experimentally observed tribological performance. Results demonstrate that oxidized phosphorene exhibits greater stability than its pristine counterpart and shows higher adhesion to all substrates, attributed to favorable interactions between oxygen non-bonding states and substrate empty states. Adhesion is systematically more favorable on pristine metals than on their corresponding oxides, with chromium and iron showing particularly strong interactions due to partially filled 3d orbitals. This result is consistent with the coefficient of friction decrease observed in tribological experiments after scratching the substrate, thus removing the outermost oxide layer. Charge redistribution and electronic structure analyses reveal system-dependent interfacial bonding characteristics, with some configurations inducing metallic character in phosphorene. These findings provide fundamental insights into substrate-dependent black phosphorus lubricating properties, highlighting the key role of layer-substrate adhesion."}

We show that in an appropriate scaling limit the lower part of the entanglement spectrum exhibits ``universality''. In the scaling limit and at asymptotically long times the distribution of the entanglement spectrum depends on two parameters that can be determined from the Rényi entropies. We show that two typical scenarios occur. In the first one, the distribution of the entanglement spectrum levels is similar to the one describing the ground-state entanglement spectrum in Conformal Field Theories. In the second scenario, the lower levels of the entanglement spectrum are highly degenerate and their distribution is given by a series of Dirac deltas. We benchmark our analytical results in free-fermion chains, such as the transverse field Ising chain and the XX chain, in the rule 54 chain, and in Bethe ansatz solvable spin models."}

In advanced transistor architectures, such as gate-all-around nanosheets, the conventional channel-first process involves depositing dielectrics directly onto the channel. Atomic layer deposition of gate dielectrics on back-end-of-line compatible channel materials, such as amorphous oxide semiconductors, can induce defects or cause structural modifications that degrade electrical performance. While post-deposition annealing can partially repair this damage, it often degrades other device metrics. We report a novel channel-last concept that prevents such damage. Channel-last gate-all-around self-aligned transistors with amorphous oxide-semiconductor channels exhibit high on-state current ($>$ 1 mA/$μ$m) and low subthreshold swing (minimum of 63 mV/dec) without the need for post-deposition processing. This approach offers a general, scalable pathway for transistors with atomic layer deposited channel materials, enabling the future of low-power three-dimensional electronics."}
