This functionally reduced RVE is used for translated averaging of direct numerical simulations (DNS) results, efficiently computed via a newly developed FFT-based solver for BFCS loading.

Achieving controllable stability and transitions between distinct topological structures is crucial for practical implementations. In this work, we investigate the effect of uniaxial mechanical strain on a magnetic model on the kagome lattice, focusing on skyrmion stability and emergent topological phases. To this end, we consider a Heisenberg model that includes exchange interactions and both in-plane and out-of-plane Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. Using a combination of Spin-Lattice Dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations, we explore uniaxial strain variations in the range of $-10\\%$ to $10\\%$, showing important effects on the phase diagram.

Tensile strain, in contrast, reduces the number of skyrmions and promotes transitions to other magnetic states. Within this regime, strain levels of about ($\\sim4-6\\%$) lead to a change in topological charge, turning skyrmions ($Q=-1$) into antiskyrmions ($Q=+1$). We also examine how strain affects other phases commonly appearing in skyrmion-hosting systems, such as the helical and fully polarized states, showing that mechanical deformation alters their stability and characteristic properties.

To achieve near-quantum accuracy, it is necessary that neighborhoods contained in the training set are rather close to the ones encountered during a simulation. Yet, constructing a single training set that works well for all applications is, and likely will remain, infeasible, so, one strategy is to supplement training protocols for MLIPs with additional learning methods, such as active learning, or fine-tuning. This strategy, however, yields very complex training protocols that are difficult to implement efficiently, and cumbersome to interpret, analyze, and reproduce.\n  To address the above difficulties, we propose AutoPot, a software for automating the construction and archiving of MLIPs. AutoPot is based on BlackDynamite, a software operating parametric tasks, e.g., running simulations, or single-point ab initio calculations, in a highly-parallelized fashion, and Motoko, an event-based workflow manager for orchestrating interactions between the tasks. The initial version of AutoPot supports selection of training configurations from large training candidate sets, and on-the-fly selection from molecular dynamics simulations, using Moment Tensor Potentials as implemented in MLIP-2, and single-point calculations of the selected training configurations using VASP. Another strength of AutoPot is its flexibility: BlackDynamite tasks and orchestrators are Python functions to which own existing code can be easily added and manipulated without writing complex parsers. Therefore, it will be straightforward to add other MLIP and ab initio codes, and manipulate the Motoko orchestrators to implement other training protocols."}

Pressure is a powerful method that can switch a three-dimensional (3D) material between non-superconducting and superconducting states. In the two-dimensional (2D) case, strain engineering plays a similar role to pressure. However, purely strain-induced superconductivity in 2D systems remains exceedingly scarce. Using first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that a superconducting transition can be induced solely by applying biaxial tensile strain in a 2D carbon allotrope, THO-graphene, which is composed of triangles, hexagons, and octagons. Free-standing THO-graphene is non-superconducting. Surprisingly, the electron-phonon coupling in strained THO-graphene is enhanced strong enough to pair electrons and realize superconductivity, with the highest superconducting transition temperature reaching 45 K. This work not only provides a notable example of controlling metal-superconductor transition in 2D system just via strain, but also sets a new record of superconducting transition temperature for 2D elemental superconductors."}

Individual Te vacancies are found to generate a pair of spectral peaks within the excitonic gap. Their energies depend sensitively on the defect configurations and are continuously tunable by tip electric field, indicating controllable impurity scatterings. Spectral mapping shows spatially anisotropic and electronically coupled electron-hole components of the subgap states.

This work presents a pedagogically oriented and computationally enhanced approach to variational modeling that integrates contemporary tools including gradient descent, automatic differentiation, and Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). Classical variational problems are reformulated as optimization tasks and implemented using open-source Python libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, PyTorch, and JAX. The proposed approach is demonstrated through a progression of problems drawn from standard undergraduate curricula, including the derivation of Snell's law from Fermat's principle, projectile motion with and without viscous drag, simple harmonic motion, nonlinear pendulum with damping, steady-state heat conduction governed by the Laplace and Poisson equations with nonlinear temperature-dependent internal heat generation, the double pendulum via the principle of least action, and variational treatments of vibrating strings. In addition, quantum mechanical applications are presented through variational solutions of the hydrogen atom, helium atom, and a schematic nuclear model of the silicon nucleus, illustrating the breadth of the framework across classical, quantum, and nuclear physics. The approach aims to enhance conceptual understanding while simultaneously introducing students to modern computational research methodologies."}

The optimized structural parameters show good agreement with available experimental data. The Born stability criteria and negative formation energies confirm the mechanical and thermodynamic stability of these materials. Poisson and Pugh ratios indicate a ductile nature, while low Debye and melting temperatures together with low Vickers hardness suggest that the compounds are relatively soft. The electronic band structures and density of states reveal metallic behavior. Charge density distribution and Mulliken population analysis indicate mixed covalent, ionic, and metallic bonding. The calculated Fermi surfaces contain both hole-like and electron-like sheets, suggesting possible multiband characteristics. Phonon dispersion analysis confirms the dynamical stability of LaRh2Al2 and LaRh2Ga2, while LaRh2In2 shows dynamical instability associated with a possible structural phase transition. Optical property analysis indicates that these superconductors may be promising candidates for high-density optical data storage applications. The estimated electron-phonon coupling constant of about 0.56 indicates that LaRh2X2 compounds are weakly coupled low critical temperature superconductors."}

The non-invertibility originates from projectors accompanying the symmetry operators, which restrict admissible gauge-field configurations. We further analyze the fusion rules of these symmetries, showing that invertible symmetries admit inverses, while non-invertible symmetries fuse through multiple channels. Finally, we study mixed anomalies among these generalized symmetries by simultaneously coupling multiple currents to proper types of background gauge fields and examining their gaugeability.

Applied to the Davis-Skodje system, the approach recovers both slow and fast modes across stiffness regimes, reducing fast eigenvalue error by an order of magnitude while improving rollout fidelity.

In this work, we study how compression influences vortex dynamics and critical currents in an iron-based superconductor. Specifically, we perform magnetization measurements using an off-the-shelf pressure cell to investigate the effects of hydrostatic pressures up to 1.08 GPa on the magnetic properties of BaFe$_2$(As$_{0.62}$P$_{0.38}$)$_2$ crystals across a range of temperatures $T$ and magnetic fields $H$. Although these pressures minimally affect the superconducting critical temperature, they produce a clear increase in the critical current density $J_c(T,H)$, a pronounced reduction in the rate of thermally activated vortex motion $S(T,H)$, and can change the dominant vortex pinning mechanism. Furthermore, the effects of pressure are irreversible: after pressurization and subsequent release at room temperature, the crystals retain their enhanced critical current densities. The second magnetization peak vanishes at 22 K after the pressure cycle, which we attribute to a transition from predominantly $δκ$ pinning to a mixed mechanism of $δT_c$ and surface pinning. Lastly, a threefold increase in $J_c$ and more than 40\\% reduction in $S$ at 8~K and 0.5~T was achieved after $1-2$ pressure cycles. These findings demonstrate the potential utility of pressure cycling for improving $J_c$, which may offer a simpler alternative to approaches such as chemical doping or the introduction of artificial pinning centers."}

One Wigner crystal possesses both record-high Tc and electron density, and undergoes melting through an intermediate nematic phase upon decreasing magnetic field. In contrast, the other Wigner crystal with a lower Tc yields a different intermediate phase during melting, exhibiting an anomalous electron liquid with an energy-independent modulation period. First-principles calculations corroborate the band-selective occupations of interface-transferred electrons in the formation of dual Wigner crystals. Our atomically resolved intermediate phases provide crucial insights into the microscopic melting pathways of Wigner crystals, enabling a phase diagram parameterized by both quantum and thermal fluctuations."}

Phase-resolved analysis using a probabilistic segmentation method shows that this scaling arises from the fundamentally intermittent, two-dimensional, and directionally correlated nature of soaring transport, in which successive ballistic segments do not add coherently. We find that learning, in the sense of experience-driven improvements in exploration and decision-making, manifests primarily in the search phase, enhancing the ability to efficiently probe the air mass and locate the next thermal.

In this work, we examine how specific structural features govern charge storage and explain capacitance variations among carbide-derived carbon (CDC) electrodes. Two key methodological and mechanistic advances are introduced. First, we propose a physically motivated, electric-field-based definition of the ion sphere of influence, which avoids the ambiguity of radial distribution function-based cutoffs and enables a more reliable characterization of local ion--electrode interactions. Second, we introduce an ion-resolved channel-width descriptor that quantifies pore accessibility by identifying the narrowest passage a counter-ion must traverse to enter a pore, directly linking accessibility to ion decoordination. Using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of supercapacitors comprising realistic CDC electrodes and a room-temperature ionic liquid electrolyte under applied potentials, we show that carbon atoms located at the edges of graphitic sheets consistently accumulate higher charge than basal-plane atoms across all electrode types. The fraction of edge atoms increases with structural disorder and correlates with enhanced capacitance, in agreement with recent experimental findings linking disorder to charge storage. Furthermore, analysis of pore size and channel width reveals that ion decoordination is governed primarily by channel width rather than pore size alone. Together, these results establish edge atom concentration and pore channel width as decisive structural descriptors controlling charge accumulation in nanoporous carbon supercapacitors, providing clear design guidelines for optimizing electrode architectures."}

This enhancement is rooted in a critical dual role of Sc $3d$ electrons: i) the Sc-derived Jahn-Teller effect promotes hydrogen metallization via the elongation of specific interlayer H-H bonds and enhances electron-phonon coupling (EPC) through the softening of associated phonon modes; ii) Sc $3d$ electrons reconstruct the electronic structure into an MgB$_{2}$-like configuration, generating novel Sc-H-Sc $σ$- and $π$-bonding states with EPC strengths comparable to LaH$_{10}$. Crucially, the pronounced hybridization between Sc and the hydrogen cages effectively unifies these two contributions on the Fermi surface. This Sc-induced gap unification bridges the high-EPC H-H states with widespread Sc-H states, establishing an isotropic single-gap nature with a large overall EPC strength. Our findings identify this Sc-induced gap unification as the fundamental mechanism for achieving room-temperature superconductivity in LaSc$_{2}$H$_{24}$, offering a theoretical blueprint for the future design of superior superconducting hydrides."}

However, prior to absorption, the particle may undergo several rounds of surface attachment (adsorption), detachment (desorption) and diffusion. Alternatively, the surface may be stochastically gated so that absorption can only occur when the gate is open. In both cases one can view each return to the surface as a renewal event. In this paper we develop a renewal theory for stochastically gated FTP problems along analogous lines to previous work on adsorption/desorption processes. We proceed by constructing a renewal equation that relates the joint probability density for particle position and the state of a gate (or multiple gates) to the probability density and FPT density for a totally absorbing (non-gated) boundary. This essentially decomposes sample paths into an alternating sequence of bulk diffusion and instantaneous adsorption/desorption events, which is terminated when adsorption coincides with an open gate. Through a variety of examples, we show how renewal theory provides a general mathematical framework for incorporating stochastic gating into FTP problems."}

We demonstrate perpendicular magnetization switching in [Co/Pt]3 multilayers driven by the OHE in a light 3d transition metal nitride, VN, with 111-texture of face-center cubic structure. Second harmonic Hall measurement reveals a large torque efficiency of -0.41 in the VN(7.5 nm)/[Co(0.35nm)/Pt(0.3 nm)]3, which significantly surpasses that in the control samples with Co, Py, and CoFeB ferromagnets, suggesting strong conversion of orbital current originating from VN to spin current by [Co/Pt]3 ferromagnet. Full switching by in-plane current is achieved with an in-plane magnetic field, while partial field-free switching occurs without it. The critical current density for the switching is found to be comparable to that of the W-based spin-orbit torque device. First-principles calculations confirm a large orbital Hall conductivity in VN, with a small spin Hall conductivity around the Fermi energy. Our results highlight the potential in the combination of light 3d transition metal nitrides and Co/Pt ferromagnetic multilayer with 111-texture to maximize the magnetization switching efficiency of orbitronic devices."}

We studied geometry optimizations, relative stability, atomization energies, Fermi energy, energy gap, electronic properties, electric dipole moment, polarizabilities, and thermodynamic analysis, along with IR and NMR spectra. Consistently, our findings revealed distinct properties and characteristics among different C36 fullerene isomers. The energetic order of C36 fullerene isomers was established as C36-D3h < C36-C1 < C36-Cs < C36-C2 < C36-D2, a trend unaffected by the encapsulation of oxygen. Notably, the D2 isomer displayed the smallest energy gap, indicating higher electrical conductivity compared to other isomers, while it exhibited the largest gap after encapsulation. Furthermore, we observed that the C1 (D2) isomer exhibited the largest (smallest) Electric dipole moment among the studied C36 isomers, whereas the C2 (D2) isomer demonstrated the largest Electric dipole moment among the O@C36 isomers studied. The encapsulation of oxygen in C36 isomers influenced their properties, including alterations in electronic properties, IR, and NMR chemical shifts. A detailed analysis of BSSE corrections showed the tininess of their impact on the analyzed observables, such that uncorrected and BSSE-corrected calculations led to nearly identical results, confirming the robustness and reliability of the B3LYP/6-31G* approach used in this work and, eventually, in other large and rigid fullerenes systems."}

Using first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that a superconducting transition can be induced solely by applying biaxial tensile strain in a 2D carbon allotrope, THO-graphene, which is composed of triangles, hexagons, and octagons. Free-standing THO-graphene is non-superconducting.

Numerical simulations reveal three distinct dynamical regimes of the CDW order parameter following a quench-locked oscillations, Landau-damped dynamics, and overdamped relaxation-closely paralleling quench dynamics in BCS superconductors and other electronically driven symmetry-breaking phases. Crucially, however, the presence of dynamical lattice degrees of freedom leads to qualitatively different long-time behavior. In particular, while the oscillation amplitude is reduced in the damped regimes, CDW oscillations do not fully decay but instead persist indefinitely due to feedback from the lattice field. We further show that these persistent oscillations are characterized by a nonequilibrium electronic distribution, which provides an intuitive understanding of both their amplitude and the renormalization of the oscillation frequency relative to the bare Holstein phonon frequency. Our results highlight the essential role of lattice dynamics in nonequilibrium ordered phases and establish a clear distinction between electron-lattice-driven CDW dynamics and their purely electronic counterparts."}

Here, we reveal the fundamental distinction between three-dimensional and low-dimensional conductors arising from disorder-induced electron localization, which leads to the breakdown of Ohm's law and lateral linear scaling. We develop a quantitative model that captures the role of the disordered region, a unique characteristic intrinsically to low-dimensional transistors.

We find that compressive $c$-axis strain modifies the charge order only within the superconducting state, with a striking polarization dependence: suppression in the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ channel and enhancement in the $d_{z^2}$ channel. X-ray absorption spectra reveal concomitant strain-induced modifications of the oxygen pre-edge and upper Hubbard band, consistent with increased $d_{z^2}$ orbital admixture. Our results suggest that $c$-axis pressure drives an orbital separation between superconductivity, rooted in $d_{x^2-y^2}$ states, and charge order, which gradually shifts to the $d_{z^2}$ channel. This orbital separation reveals a way for superconductivity and charge order to coexist in the cuprates with minimal competition. Furthermore, it suggests that the multi-order phase diagram of La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_4$ cannot be realistically described within single band models usually used to describe cuprate physics."}

Unlike in conventional ferromagnets or antiferromagnets, their spectrum is highly sensitive to the domain wall orientation relative to the crystal axis. These magnons inherit the chiral splitting of their bulk counterparts and are detectable in the microwave regime, offering a distinctive signature for identifying altermagnets. We further show that the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction drives hybridization of magnons with opposite chiralities, enabling unidirectional strong magnon-magnon coupling.

Enstatite nanoparticles of different sizes were synthesized using the sol-gel method, characterized with X-ray diffraction, thermal analysis, infrared spectroscopy, surface area measurements, and electron microscopy. The materials consist of crystallites with sizes of $\\sim $10 - 20 nm, which are agglomerated into larger nanoparticles. Thus, both surface and interface terms contribute to the measured enthalpies. Analysis based on calorimetry and calculated surface and interface areas gives the surface enthalpy of enstatite as 4.79 $\\pm$ 0.45 J m$^{-2}$. This value is comparable to that of forsterite (Mg$_2$SiO$_4$) and larger than those of many nonsilicate oxide materials. This large surface energy may present a barrier to the nucleation of enstatite in planetary atmospheres and other geochemical and planetary environments. The interfacial energy of enstatite appears to be close to zero. The transition enthalpy from bulk orthoenstatite to bulk clinoenstatite is 0.34 $\\pm$ 0.93 kJ mol$^{-1}$, which is in agreement with earlier reports.

Pressure is a powerful method that can switch a three-dimensional (3D) material between non-superconducting and superconducting states. In the two-dimensional (2D) case, strain engineering plays a similar role to pressure. However, purely strain-induced superconductivity in 2D systems remains exceedingly scarce. Using first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that a superconducting transition can be induced solely by applying biaxial tensile strain in a 2D carbon allotrope, THO-graphene, which is composed of triangles, hexagons, and octagons. Free-standing THO-graphene is non-superconducting. Surprisingly, the electron-phonon coupling in strained THO-graphene is enhanced strong enough to pair electrons and realize superconductivity, with the highest superconducting transition temperature reaching 45 K.

However, creating a quantitatively reliable potential energy surface (PES) for this weakly bound system remains a significant computational challenge. In this work, we present a comprehensive, multi-level investigation of the He-Bz interaction, establishing benchmark energies using high-level coupled-cluster singles-and-doubles with perturbative triples (CCSD(T)) methods extrapolated to the complete basis set limit and assessing higher-order (CCSDT(Q)) contributions. We use symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) to benchmark it against CCSD(T) and to decompose the interaction into its physical components-confirming it is dominated by a balance between dispersion and exchange-repulsion. A continuous, three-dimensional PES is constructed from discrete ab initio points using multifidelity Gaussian process regression that combines density functional theory results with sparse coupled-cluster energies. The result is a highly accurate PES with sub-cm-1 accuracy that obeys physical laws. This new PES is applied to path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations to study the solvation of 4He atoms on benzene at low temperatures. Our PIMC results reveal qualitatively different solvation behavior, particularly in the filling of adsorption layers, when compared to simulations using commonly employed empirical Lennard-Jones potentials.

For this, the focus of recent work has been on introducing controlled lateral gradients across ferromagnet/heavy-metal devices, giving variations in thickness, composition, or interface quality. However, the small gradients achievable with common growth techniques limit both the impact of this approach and understanding of the underlying physical mechanisms. Here, spin-orbit torques are patterned on a mesoscopic length scale in tungsten thin films using direct-write laser annealing. Through transmission electron microscopy, resistivity, and second harmonic measurements, the continuous transformation of the crystalline phase of W films from the highly spin-orbit coupled, high resistivity $β$ phase to the minimally spin-orbit coupled, low resistivity $α$ phase is tracked with increasing laser fluence. Gradients with different steepness are patterned in the tungsten phase to create spin-orbit torque channels and, when interfaced with CoFeB, tungsten wires with a sufficiently strong gradient can switch the magnetization without an applied magnetic field. Therefore, exploiting the unique microstructure of mixed-phase W allows precise control of the local electronic current density and direction, as well as local spin-orbit torque efficiency, providing a new avenue for the design of efficient spintronic devices."}

Quantitative analysis based on an extended Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk model unveils $B_{2u}$ or $B_{3u}$ as the most likely representation for both ambient and pressurized UTe$_2$, and remarkably, the multiple SC phases can be distinguished by a single parameter $\\langle Δ_{z}\\rangle/\\langleΔ_{x(y)}\\rangle$, the relative weight between the $p_z$-wave and $p_{x(y)}$-wave pairings.

Extensive experimental investigations, together with advanced numerical studies, have now revealed a coherent and internally consistent picture of these phases, substantially deepening our understanding of supersolidity in quantum magnetic materials. Beyond their fundamental interest as exotic quantum states, potential applications in highly efficient demagnetization cooling have been supported by a giant magnetocaloric effect observed in candidate materials.

Stanton memorial issue)", "summary": "We consider the thermochemical impact of post-CCSD(T) contributions to the total atomization energy (TAE, the sum of all bond energies) of first- and second-row molecules, and specifically their coupling with the subvalence correlation contribution. In particular, we find large contributions from (Q) when there are several neighboring second-row atoms. Otherwise, both higher-order triples $T_3$--(T) and connected quadruples (Q) are important in systems with strong static correlation. Reoptimization of the reference geometry for core-valence correlation increases the calculated TAE across the board, most pronouncedly so for second-row compounds with neighboring second-row atoms. %just slightly increases the calculated TAE for all species, but more pronouncedly so if strong static correlation is present, as well as for second-row compounds, again especially with neighboring second-row atoms. We present a first proposal for a `W5 theory' protocol and compare computed TAEs for the W4-08 benchmark with prior reference values. For some key second-row species, the new values represent nontrivial revisions. Our predicted TAE$_0$ values (TAE at 0 K) agree well with the ATcT (active thermochemical tables) values, including for the very recent expansion of the ATcT network to boron, silicon, and sulfur compounds."}

We show that nonreciprocity and the superconducting diode effect arise from the interplay between the Lifshitz invariant and fractional kinetics, with the latter serving as an effective, symmetry-consistent representation of fractal geometry and finite-range memory. Two complementary approaches are pursued. In a fractional integral GL formulation, spatial integration on a fractal space yields analytic solutions and reveals how rectification scales with the dimensionality of the fractal media and the strength of the Lifshitz-like drift. In a fractional derivative-based formulation derived via the Agrawal variational principle with left/right Caputo operators, we obtain a gauge-invariant free energy, the corresponding GL equations, and a current density. We use fractional orders as effective parameters that represent nonlocal and memory effects induced by fractal microstructure. Within a two-mode plane-wave approximation we derive a compact current-phase relation and an expression for the diode efficiency, and we map the rectification amplitude across the fractional kinetic and the Lifshitz/memory order. An exact single-sided solution in terms of Prabhakar functions further confirms robust, tunable nonreciprocity, including a near-ideal diode response. This identifies a pathway to near-perfect superconducting diodes by engineering fractal (fractional-kinetic) transport achieved by tuning the fractional orders and Lifshitz strength without invoking magnetic fields or geometric ratchets. In the integer limit of local kinetics and Lifshitz-like drift, both constructions reduce to the standard $\\varphi_0$ Josephson junction."}

In recent years, the emergence of femtosecond lasers has opened a new avenue for studying nonequilibrium dynamics in condensed matter. However, conventional optical techniques lack elemental and orbital specificity, making it difficult to disentangle the coupled charge, spin, and lattice responses in complex materials. The development of X-ray free-electron lasers (XFEL) and laboratory high-harmonic generation (HHG) sources has enabled the extension of X-ray absorption and scattering techniques into the femtosecond time domain. Time-resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy, X-ray magnetic circular dichroism, and resonant soft X-ray scattering now provide direct, complementary access to element- and momentum-resolved ultrafast dynamics. This review summarizes recent progress in these techniques, focusing on pump-probe measurements of laser-induced demagnetization, spin-state transitions, and valence and structural changes in transition-metal compounds. We also discuss advances in tabletop HHG-based X-ray spectroscopy and its integration with large-scale XFEL facilities. These developments provide powerful routes for visualizing the nonequilibrium evolution of charge, spin, orbital, and lattice degrees of freedom, offering new insights into the ultrafast control of quantum materials."}

Intrinsic STC are rare but offer rich condensate properties and unique surface properties allowing insights into the nature of the spin-triplet order, and promising applications in quantum technologies. Owing to interactions, the order parameter in STCs can often be intertwined with other symmetry breaking orders like charge/spin density waves (CDW/SDW) or pair density waves (PDW) complicating their phase diagrams. UTe2 stands out as the only known odd-parity, STC that harbors such intertwined orders on the surface and possible topological surface states composed of Majorana fermions. While the (0-11) facet is the most heavily studied, the fermiology of this surface that gives rise to such exotic phenomena is still lacking and continues to be an area of active interest. Here, we employ low-temperature spectroscopic imaging to reveal the Fermi surface of UTe2 through quasiparticle interference. We find scattering originating from the uranium-derived bands that play a major role in the formation of the CDW and the PDW phases. Tunneling spectroscopy further reveals spectral signatures of the CDW gap, corroborating its onset temperature. Suppressing the CDW with a magnetic field, highlights the presence of small, circular Fermi pockets that disperse strongly near the Fermi energy. We discuss the nature of the interference patterns and the origin of the small Fermi pockets in the context of the calculated band structure and the unconventional CDW phase."}

In general, the two Hall states with opposite Hall conductivities can be regarded as time-reversal pairs coupled to magnetic order, and switching between them relies on reversing the magnetization via an external magnetic field or electric current. Here, we introduce a approach for manipulating anomalous transport through crystal symmetry engineering in two-dimensional (2D) altermagnetic systems. Based on symmetry analysis, we demonstrate that 2D altermagnets (AM) with out-of-plane Néel vectors will not host any anomalous Hall transport. Remarkably, breaking the symmetry connecting the two magnetic sublattices, an anomalous Hall response can emerge immediately, and the signs of the anomalous Hall and anomalous Nernst conductivities can be flexibly controlled by the symmetry-breaking term, thereby realizing tunable sign-reversible anomalous transport. Furthermore, the feasibility of the theoretical scheme is further verified by explicit lattice-model construction. Using first-principles calculations, we investigate the realization of crystal symmetry-controlled anomalous transport in a 2D AM material Cr$_{2}$O$_{2}$. The results indicate that Cr$_{2}$O$_{2}$ with out-of-plane Néel vectors can sequentially exhibit the AHE and quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) under continuous uniaxial strain. Interestingly, the sign reversal between these two effects can be achieved by simply rotating the strain direction by C$_{4z}$ symmetry. The corresponding ANE and its sign reversal are also revealed. Our findings provide a new strategy to manipulate anomalous transport, and should have significant potential applications."}

Previously, D. Ambika et al. [Phys. Rev. B 105, L220403 (2022)] have reported the possible coexistence of ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin fluctuations in UTe$_2$ under pressure from their nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements.

By comparing the temperature $T$ dependence of nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rates divided by temperature 1/$T_1T$ with that of the Knight shift $K$ for magnetic fields along the $a$, $b$, and $c$ directions, we evidence the enhancement of AFM spin fluctuations with increasing pressure. Based on the results, we suggest that FM spin fluctuations are more favorable for SC1 and AFM spin fluctuations are crucial for SC2.

We analyze the resulting low-energy field theory using a perturbative renormalization group (RG) scheme, accounting for additional density-density interactions generated under RG.

Achieving controllable stability and transitions between distinct topological structures is crucial for practical implementations. In this work, we investigate the effect of uniaxial mechanical strain on a magnetic model on the kagome lattice, focusing on skyrmion stability and emergent topological phases. To this end, we consider a Heisenberg model that includes exchange interactions and both in-plane and out-of-plane Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. Using a combination of Spin-Lattice Dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations, we explore uniaxial strain variations in the range of $-10\\%$ to $10\\%$, showing important effects on the phase diagram. For compressive strain, we find that the density of skyrmions in the skyrmion gas (SkG) phase can be tuned and that the stability of this phase extends to higher temperatures. Tensile strain, in contrast, reduces the number of skyrmions and promotes transitions to other magnetic states. Within this regime, strain levels of about ($\\sim4-6\\%$) lead to a change in topological charge, turning skyrmions ($Q=-1$) into antiskyrmions ($Q=+1$). We also examine how strain affects other phases commonly appearing in skyrmion-hosting systems, such as the helical and fully polarized states, showing that mechanical deformation alters their stability and characteristic properties. Finally, we compare these results with the strain response of a more conventional skyrmion model, in order to clarify the role of the different interactions involved.

For the development of such integrated circuits on a 2D semiconductor platform, spontaneous growth of the material in the form of circular islands is desirable. Here, we report the natural formation of 1L-MoS2 circular islands of diameter as large as a few hundreds of micrometer on SiO2/Si substrates by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technique without the use of any seeding layer. The size of the circles is found to increase with the amount of sulphur used during growth. The study reveals that these circular islands are formed with a less-defective interior and a more-defective outer part that is dominated by a large density of grain boundaries and twists. Due to the lower defect density, the interior region yields much higher photoluminescence than the peripheral part. Field effect transistors (FETs) are fabricated on inner and outer portions of a circle to estimate the mobility and concentration of the background carriers in the two regions. The study shows that the maximum mobility is more than double in the interior than the outer part. While the carrier concentration remains practically unchanged in the two regions. The natural tendency to minimize the strain energy resulting from the mismatch between the thermal expansion coefficients of the monolayer and the substrate as well as the edge energy that originates from the boundary tension are thought to be the driving forces behind the formation of these circular domains."}

In this paper, we study a weaker consequence of this relation, known as Jarzynski's inequality, which can be formally obtained from the Jarzynski equality via Jensen's inequality. We identify and analyze several extensions of Jarzynski's inequality that go beyond its direct derivation from the Jarzynski equality. In particular, we consider chemical systems both in the linear-response regime and away from linear thermodynamics. Furthermore, by employing functional-integral techniques, we extend Jarzynski's inequality to many-body statistical systems described by quantum field theory. Salient issues, such as connections of the Jarzynski inequality with the maximum work theorem and the Landau--Lifshitz theory of fluctuations, are also discussed."}

To improve the relatively low capacitive performance of ZnO compared to NiO, NaCl was introduced as a dopant. All films were deposited using a non-vacuum spin-coating method on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates, chosen for their excellent electrical conductivity and stability as electrode materials. The surface morphology and structural parameters were examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), respectively. Optical properties were analyzed via UV-Vis spectroscopy, revealing direct band gaps in the range of 3.17-3.31 eV for ZnO and Na-ZnO, and wider gaps up to 3.81 eV for NiO. Electrochemical performance was evaluated using cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in a three-electrode configuration with 1 M KOH as the electrolyte. Among the electrodes, the single-layer NiO film exhibited the highest specific capacitance of 1.391 Fg^{-1}. In contrast, the NiO/ZnO heterostructure demonstrated a synergistic effect, resulting in enhanced charge storage and achieving a maximum specific capacitance of 1.627 Fg^{-1} at a current density of 2.0 mA cm^{-2}.

Vibrational frequency calculations verify the dynamical stability of the low-lying structures, while infrared and UV-Vis spectra highlight strong Ca--B coupling and pronounced electronic delocalization within the boron scaffold. Atomic dipole-corrected Hirshfeld charge analysis indicates substantial charge transfer from Ca to the electron-deficient boron framework, with the donated electrons uniformly delocalized over the B$_{18}$ skeleton. Real-space bonding analyses based on the electron localization function (ELF), Interaction Region Indicator (IRI), and the Laplacian of the electron density reveal an extended multicenter bonding network characterized by global $σ$-delocalization and Ca-induced polarization effects rather than localized two-center Ca--B bonds.

Despite extensive studies on the phase diagrams and competing orders induced by pressure and magnetic field, limited has been known about its SC order parameters and their evolution with these control parameters, largely due to the lack of appropriate symmetry-sensitive detections. Here, we report comprehensive point-contact spectroscopy measurements of pressurized UTe$_2$ on the (0~0~1) surface. The observation of Andreev bound state strongly suggests the presence of a $p_z$ component in the SC order parameters. Quantitative analysis based on an extended Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk model unveils $B_{2u}$ or $B_{3u}$ as the most likely representation for both ambient and pressurized UTe$_2$, and remarkably, the multiple SC phases can be distinguished by a single parameter $\\langle Δ_{z}\\rangle/\\langleΔ_{x(y)}\\rangle$, the relative weight between the $p_z$-wave and $p_{x(y)}$-wave pairings.

In this context, we consider a zigzag-ordered antiferromagnet with both extended Kitaev and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions (DMI) in presence of an external magnetic field to focus on the topological phases demonstrated by the magnon band structure and validated by the transport properties. The hybridization between the up- and down-spin sectors carries evidences of opening bulk gaps in the magnon band structure, giving rise to nontrivial topological phases characterized by finite Chern numbers, chiral edge modes, and a nonzero thermal Hall conductivity. Furthermore, generally speaking, a finite magnon orbital moment can exist and contribute to the Nernst response even when the net spin moment vanishes owing to the fundamental independence of the spin and orbital magnetizations. This motivates us to investigate the magnon orbital moment, orbital Berry curvature, and the resulting orbital Nernst conductivity associated with the magnon bands. We find that a giant orbital Nernst conductivity emerges even in the absence of an external magnetic field. Moreover, the distinction between different topological phases is more lucidly manifested via the orbital Nernst conductivity, thereby highlighting an enhanced sensitivity of the orbital transport to the underlying band topology. For completeness, we briefly discuss the scenario corresponding to a Néel-ordered spin alignment, which leads to a vanishing Chern number and consequently suppressed thermal Hall and orbital Nernst conductivities compared to the zigzag-ordered case, even in the presence of DMI and Kitaev interactions."}

However, reliable magnetic structures are known for only limited compounds. Traditional methods based on first-principles calculations are fundamentally limited by the need to calculate a large space of input magnetic configurations. Here we introduce a symmetry-aided strategy based on Landau's phase transition theory. By utilizing the crystallographic space group and the Wyckoff positions of magnetic ions, we narrow down the initial magnetic configurations to a limited number of candidates via the analysis of irreducible representations. The magnetic ground state is subsequently determined by the lowest energy of those well-seleted magnetic configurations via first-principles calculations. Benchmarking calculations are performed on a subset of the MAGNDATA database with q=0 and fewer than 40 atoms per unit cell, comprising 260 materials. Our method correctly identifies the magnetic structure for 207 of these materials, corresponding to an accuracy of 80%. We further apply our highly efficient method to the compounds with fewer than 20 atoms per unit cell in the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD), and establish a database containing 2,800 magnetic materials. As a demonstration of its utility, we apply our magnetic structure database to the systematic identification of 1,070 magnetic topological phases and 389 altermagnets."}

In this work, we employed first-principles anharmonic lattice dynamics calculations to systematically investigate phonon transport in indium iodides from particle- and wave-like perspectives. The calculated lattice thermal conductivities of both materials remained below 1 W/m-K over a broad temperature range. Notably, the influence of wave-like phonon transport differed by composition: in InI3, the wave-like contribution became comparable to the particle-like Peierls contribution, whereas it remained negligible in InI. We also investigated the thermal transport properties of the experimentally reported high-pressure phase of InI3. Motivated by experimental indications of stacking faults and partial disorder in indium site occupancy within the rhombohedral phase, we constructed several ordered structural models with different stacking sequences. These stacking sequences exhibited no significant energetic preference and had similar lattice thermal conductivities, suggesting that in-plane thermal transport is largely governed by the vibrational properties of the In2I6 layers themselves rather than by the specific stacking sequence. These findings provide insight into phonon transport in layered and molecular-crystal systems with structural complexity and contribute to a broader understanding of thermal transport mechanisms in layered and molecular-crystal-like materials."}

From a large dataset of paraglider, hang glider, and sailplane flights, we uncover a universal transport law: beyond short ballistic times, horizontal motion is persistently sub-ballistic, with a Hurst exponent $\\approx 0.88$ largely independent of aircraft type. Phase-resolved analysis using a probabilistic segmentation method shows that this scaling arises from the fundamentally intermittent, two-dimensional, and directionally correlated nature of soaring transport, in which successive ballistic segments do not add coherently. We find that learning, in the sense of experience-driven improvements in exploration and decision-making, manifests primarily in the search phase, enhancing the ability to efficiently probe the air mass and locate the next thermal. Overall, our results suggest that atmospheric structure and the generic organization of the transition-search-climb cycle dominate transport properties, placing human soaring alongside biological and physical systems where anomalous transport emerges from intermittency and persistence."}

We show that nonreciprocity and the superconducting diode effect arise from the interplay between the Lifshitz invariant and fractional kinetics, with the latter serving as an effective, symmetry-consistent representation of fractal geometry and finite-range memory. Two complementary approaches are pursued. In a fractional integral GL formulation, spatial integration on a fractal space yields analytic solutions and reveals how rectification scales with the dimensionality of the fractal media and the strength of the Lifshitz-like drift. In a fractional derivative-based formulation derived via the Agrawal variational principle with left/right Caputo operators, we obtain a gauge-invariant free energy, the corresponding GL equations, and a current density. We use fractional orders as effective parameters that represent nonlocal and memory effects induced by fractal microstructure. Within a two-mode plane-wave approximation we derive a compact current-phase relation and an expression for the diode efficiency, and we map the rectification amplitude across the fractional kinetic and the Lifshitz/memory order. An exact single-sided solution in terms of Prabhakar functions further confirms robust, tunable nonreciprocity, including a near-ideal diode response. This identifies a pathway to near-perfect superconducting diodes by engineering fractal (fractional-kinetic) transport achieved by tuning the fractional orders and Lifshitz strength without invoking magnetic fields or geometric ratchets. In the integer limit of local kinetics and Lifshitz-like drift, both constructions reduce to the standard $\\varphi_0$ Josephson junction."}

We find that compressive $c$-axis strain modifies the charge order only within the superconducting state, with a striking polarization dependence: suppression in the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ channel and enhancement in the $d_{z^2}$ channel. X-ray absorption spectra reveal concomitant strain-induced modifications of the oxygen pre-edge and upper Hubbard band, consistent with increased $d_{z^2}$ orbital admixture. Our results suggest that $c$-axis pressure drives an orbital separation between superconductivity, rooted in $d_{x^2-y^2}$ states, and charge order, which gradually shifts to the $d_{z^2}$ channel. This orbital separation reveals a way for superconductivity and charge order to coexist in the cuprates with minimal competition.

In addition, these models could also be leveraged to reconstruct crystal structures for which partial information is available. One relevant example is the reliable determination of atomic positions occupied by hydrogen atoms in hydrogen-containing crystalline materials. While crucial to the analysis and prediction of many materials properties, the identification of hydrogen positions can however be difficult and expensive, as it is challenging in X-ray scattering experiments and often requires dedicated neutron scattering measurements. As a consequence, inorganic crystallographic databases frequently report lattice structures where hydrogen atoms have been either omitted or inserted with heuristics or by chemical intuition. Here, we combine diffusion models from the field of materials science with techniques originally developed in computer vision for image inpainting. We present how this knowledge transfer across domains enables a much faster and more accurate completion of host structures, compared to unconditioned diffusion models or previous approaches solely based on DFT. Overall, our approach exceeds a success rate of 97% in terms of finding a structural match or predicting a more stable configuration than the initial reference, when starting both from structures that were already relaxed with DFT, or directly from the experimentally determined host structures."}

The materials consist of crystallites with sizes of $\\sim $10 - 20 nm, which are agglomerated into larger nanoparticles. Thus, both surface and interface terms contribute to the measured enthalpies.

This value is comparable to that of forsterite (Mg$_2$SiO$_4$) and larger than those of many nonsilicate oxide materials. This large surface energy may present a barrier to the nucleation of enstatite in planetary atmospheres and other geochemical and planetary environments. The interfacial energy of enstatite appears to be close to zero.

In this work, we study how compression influences vortex dynamics and critical currents in an iron-based superconductor. Specifically, we perform magnetization measurements using an off-the-shelf pressure cell to investigate the effects of hydrostatic pressures up to 1.08 GPa on the magnetic properties of BaFe$_2$(As$_{0.62}$P$_{0.38}$)$_2$ crystals across a range of temperatures $T$ and magnetic fields $H$. Although these pressures minimally affect the superconducting critical temperature, they produce a clear increase in the critical current density $J_c(T,H)$, a pronounced reduction in the rate of thermally activated vortex motion $S(T,H)$, and can change the dominant vortex pinning mechanism. Furthermore, the effects of pressure are irreversible: after pressurization and subsequent release at room temperature, the crystals retain their enhanced critical current densities. The second magnetization peak vanishes at 22 K after the pressure cycle, which we attribute to a transition from predominantly $δκ$ pinning to a mixed mechanism of $δT_c$ and surface pinning. Lastly, a threefold increase in $J_c$ and more than 40\\% reduction in $S$ at 8~K and 0.5~T was achieved after $1-2$ pressure cycles.

By comparing the temperature $T$ dependence of nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rates divided by temperature 1/$T_1T$ with that of the Knight shift $K$ for magnetic fields along the $a$, $b$, and $c$ directions, we evidence the enhancement of AFM spin fluctuations with increasing pressure. Based on the results, we suggest that FM spin fluctuations are more favorable for SC1 and AFM spin fluctuations are crucial for SC2. Our findings will inspire further study on this material to understand the peculiar SC phases in detail."}

Using a high-repetition-rate 95-keV ultrafast electron diffraction setup (UED), we measured the transient dynamics for the differential scattering signal in a momentum transfer, $q$, range longer than in conventional keV UED setups. Analysis of ten Bragg and six diffuse scattering revealed a prompt increase in the mean-square displacement (MSD), indicating rapid energy transfer from the excited electronic system to the lattice. The subsequent relaxation dynamics of the elastic scattering intensities exhibit a pronounced dependence on diffraction order. Lower-order reflections relax more rapidly, whereas higher-order reflections show significantly slower relaxation or near-plateau behaviour, indicating that lattice equilibration proceeds on multiple $q$-dependent timescales. Exponential fits to the MSD dynamics reveal oscillatory residuals, indicative of coherent non-thermal lattice motion. Power spectral density analysis of these residuals uncovers coherent lattice oscillations with a fundamental frequency of $ω_0 = 0.192$ THz, corresponding to the acoustic breathing (A$_{1g}$) mode of aluminium. Higher frequency components are also observed, consistent with coherent phonon oscillations originating from a single zero-wavevector mode populated by multiple coherent phonons. While individual phonon branches are not directly resolved, the observed dependence on the lattice plane of the relaxation behaviour and oscillatory signatures are consistent with a mode-selective lattice response and non-thermal energy redistribution as described by non-thermal lattice models."}

The crystallisation of hydrates in confined geometries is not well understood yet, and the objective of this work is to study the hydrate growth inside a silica pore using molecular simulation. Both NVT and NpT ensembles were used in the AA-MD simulations to analyse the hydrate growth from an initial seed. Results showed that the boundary conditions imposed by the nanometric slit pore yielded a hydrate with structural defects, filling the accessible space between the silica walls. The water molecules which were not incorporated to the initial seed hydrate formed a high density water layer trapped between the silica walls and the crystallised hydrate.

However, conventional optical techniques lack elemental and orbital specificity, making it difficult to disentangle the coupled charge, spin, and lattice responses in complex materials. The development of X-ray free-electron lasers (XFEL) and laboratory high-harmonic generation (HHG) sources has enabled the extension of X-ray absorption and scattering techniques into the femtosecond time domain. Time-resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy, X-ray magnetic circular dichroism, and resonant soft X-ray scattering now provide direct, complementary access to element- and momentum-resolved ultrafast dynamics. This review summarizes recent progress in these techniques, focusing on pump-probe measurements of laser-induced demagnetization, spin-state transitions, and valence and structural changes in transition-metal compounds. We also discuss advances in tabletop HHG-based X-ray spectroscopy and its integration with large-scale XFEL facilities.

This enhancement is rooted in a critical dual role of Sc $3d$ electrons: i) the Sc-derived Jahn-Teller effect promotes hydrogen metallization via the elongation of specific interlayer H-H bonds and enhances electron-phonon coupling (EPC) through the softening of associated phonon modes; ii) Sc $3d$ electrons reconstruct the electronic structure into an MgB$_{2}$-like configuration, generating novel Sc-H-Sc $σ$- and $π$-bonding states with EPC strengths comparable to LaH$_{10}$. Crucially, the pronounced hybridization between Sc and the hydrogen cages effectively unifies these two contributions on the Fermi surface. This Sc-induced gap unification bridges the high-EPC H-H states with widespread Sc-H states, establishing an isotropic single-gap nature with a large overall EPC strength.

These objects are well-known for isotropic elasticity, with their space-time representations involving generalized functions. For anisotropic elasticity they were unknown. The paper presents a derivation using the Stroh formalism. Their Fourier representation rests exclusively on the so-called prelogarithmic Lagrangian factor $L(v)$, while their space-time form involves its derivative $p(v)=L'(v)$, the prelogarithmic impulsion function. A straightforward consequence is the reformulation of the stress in the Weertman model of steadily-moving dislocations in terms of $L(v)$.

The oxidation of sputtered Cr$_2$AlC coatings with equiaxed and columnar grain morphologies was analyzed. While Cr$_7$C$_3$ formed in both coating morphologies, pores formed exclusively in columnar coatings. The expected Cr$_7$C$_3$ volume was estimated by mass-balance calculations assuming that Al-deintercalation enables oxide scale and Al-O-C-N precipitate formation, leading to complete transformation of the Al-deintercalated Cr$_2$AlC into Cr$_7$C$_3$. In equiaxed coatings, the predicted carbide volume agreed with tomography within 3 $\\pm$ 3 %, confirming Al-deintercalation-driven Cr$_7$C$_3$ formation. Despite the smaller molar volume of Cr$_7$C$_3$ relative to Cr$_2$AlC, absence of pores imply that transformation shrinkage is likely accommodated by coating thickness reduction. In columnar coatings, the predicted Cr$_7$C$_3$ volume exceeds the measured value by 22 $\\pm$ 4 %, and the pore volume expected from transformation shrinkage alone is 13-16 % lower than measured, indicating partial Al deintercalation and clustering of pre-existing defects.

Here, spin-orbit torques are patterned on a mesoscopic length scale in tungsten thin films using direct-write laser annealing. Through transmission electron microscopy, resistivity, and second harmonic measurements, the continuous transformation of the crystalline phase of W films from the highly spin-orbit coupled, high resistivity $β$ phase to the minimally spin-orbit coupled, low resistivity $α$ phase is tracked with increasing laser fluence. Gradients with different steepness are patterned in the tungsten phase to create spin-orbit torque channels and, when interfaced with CoFeB, tungsten wires with a sufficiently strong gradient can switch the magnetization without an applied magnetic field. Therefore, exploiting the unique microstructure of mixed-phase W allows precise control of the local electronic current density and direction, as well as local spin-orbit torque efficiency, providing a new avenue for the design of efficient spintronic devices."}

For the development of such integrated circuits on a 2D semiconductor platform, spontaneous growth of the material in the form of circular islands is desirable. Here, we report the natural formation of 1L-MoS2 circular islands of diameter as large as a few hundreds of micrometer on SiO2/Si substrates by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technique without the use of any seeding layer. The size of the circles is found to increase with the amount of sulphur used during growth. The study reveals that these circular islands are formed with a less-defective interior and a more-defective outer part that is dominated by a large density of grain boundaries and twists. Due to the lower defect density, the interior region yields much higher photoluminescence than the peripheral part. Field effect transistors (FETs) are fabricated on inner and outer portions of a circle to estimate the mobility and concentration of the background carriers in the two regions. The study shows that the maximum mobility is more than double in the interior than the outer part. While the carrier concentration remains practically unchanged in the two regions. The natural tendency to minimize the strain energy resulting from the mismatch between the thermal expansion coefficients of the monolayer and the substrate as well as the edge energy that originates from the boundary tension are thought to be the driving forces behind the formation of these circular domains."}

All films were deposited using a non-vacuum spin-coating method on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates, chosen for their excellent electrical conductivity and stability as electrode materials. The surface morphology and structural parameters were examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), respectively. Optical properties were analyzed via UV-Vis spectroscopy, revealing direct band gaps in the range of 3.17-3.31 eV for ZnO and Na-ZnO, and wider gaps up to 3.81 eV for NiO. Electrochemical performance was evaluated using cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in a three-electrode configuration with 1 M KOH as the electrolyte. Among the electrodes, the single-layer NiO film exhibited the highest specific capacitance of 1.391 Fg^{-1}.

Symmetry analysis demonstrates that this spin current is intimately related to the material's ferroelectric polarization that breaks the inversion symmetry and is rigorously forbidden at domain walls where electrical polarization vanishes.

The non-invertibility originates from projectors accompanying the symmetry operators, which restrict admissible gauge-field configurations. We further analyze the fusion rules of these symmetries, showing that invertible symmetries admit inverses, while non-invertible symmetries fuse through multiple channels. Finally, we study mixed anomalies among these generalized symmetries by simultaneously coupling multiple currents to proper types of background gauge fields and examining their gaugeability.

Using first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that a superconducting transition can be induced solely by applying biaxial tensile strain in a 2D carbon allotrope, THO-graphene, which is composed of triangles, hexagons, and octagons. Free-standing THO-graphene is non-superconducting.

To achieve near-quantum accuracy, it is necessary that neighborhoods contained in the training set are rather close to the ones encountered during a simulation. Yet, constructing a single training set that works well for all applications is, and likely will remain, infeasible, so, one strategy is to supplement training protocols for MLIPs with additional learning methods, such as active learning, or fine-tuning. This strategy, however, yields very complex training protocols that are difficult to implement efficiently, and cumbersome to interpret, analyze, and reproduce.\n  To address the above difficulties, we propose AutoPot, a software for automating the construction and archiving of MLIPs. AutoPot is based on BlackDynamite, a software operating parametric tasks, e.g., running simulations, or single-point ab initio calculations, in a highly-parallelized fashion, and Motoko, an event-based workflow manager for orchestrating interactions between the tasks. The initial version of AutoPot supports selection of training configurations from large training candidate sets, and on-the-fly selection from molecular dynamics simulations, using Moment Tensor Potentials as implemented in MLIP-2, and single-point calculations of the selected training configurations using VASP. Another strength of AutoPot is its flexibility: BlackDynamite tasks and orchestrators are Python functions to which own existing code can be easily added and manipulated without writing complex parsers. Therefore, it will be straightforward to add other MLIP and ab initio codes, and manipulate the Motoko orchestrators to implement other training protocols."}

Here, we reveal the fundamental distinction between three-dimensional and low-dimensional conductors arising from disorder-induced electron localization, which leads to the breakdown of Ohm's law and lateral linear scaling. We develop a quantitative model that captures the role of the disordered region, a unique characteristic intrinsically to low-dimensional transistors. Furthermore, the disorder-induced localization framework consistently explains experimental observations in atomically thin In2O3 field-effect transistors across variations in channel length, temperature, thickness, and post-annealing conditions.

In general, the two Hall states with opposite Hall conductivities can be regarded as time-reversal pairs coupled to magnetic order, and switching between them relies on reversing the magnetization via an external magnetic field or electric current. Here, we introduce a approach for manipulating anomalous transport through crystal symmetry engineering in two-dimensional (2D) altermagnetic systems. Based on symmetry analysis, we demonstrate that 2D altermagnets (AM) with out-of-plane Néel vectors will not host any anomalous Hall transport. Remarkably, breaking the symmetry connecting the two magnetic sublattices, an anomalous Hall response can emerge immediately, and the signs of the anomalous Hall and anomalous Nernst conductivities can be flexibly controlled by the symmetry-breaking term, thereby realizing tunable sign-reversible anomalous transport. Furthermore, the feasibility of the theoretical scheme is further verified by explicit lattice-model construction. Using first-principles calculations, we investigate the realization of crystal symmetry-controlled anomalous transport in a 2D AM material Cr$_{2}$O$_{2}$. The results indicate that Cr$_{2}$O$_{2}$ with out-of-plane Néel vectors can sequentially exhibit the AHE and quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) under continuous uniaxial strain. Interestingly, the sign reversal between these two effects can be achieved by simply rotating the strain direction by C$_{4z}$ symmetry. The corresponding ANE and its sign reversal are also revealed. Our findings provide a new strategy to manipulate anomalous transport, and should have significant potential applications."}

However, prior to absorption, the particle may undergo several rounds of surface attachment (adsorption), detachment (desorption) and diffusion. Alternatively, the surface may be stochastically gated so that absorption can only occur when the gate is open. In both cases one can view each return to the surface as a renewal event. In this paper we develop a renewal theory for stochastically gated FTP problems along analogous lines to previous work on adsorption/desorption processes. We proceed by constructing a renewal equation that relates the joint probability density for particle position and the state of a gate (or multiple gates) to the probability density and FPT density for a totally absorbing (non-gated) boundary. This essentially decomposes sample paths into an alternating sequence of bulk diffusion and instantaneous adsorption/desorption events, which is terminated when adsorption coincides with an open gate.

Here, spin-orbit torques are patterned on a mesoscopic length scale in tungsten thin films using direct-write laser annealing. Through transmission electron microscopy, resistivity, and second harmonic measurements, the continuous transformation of the crystalline phase of W films from the highly spin-orbit coupled, high resistivity $β$ phase to the minimally spin-orbit coupled, low resistivity $α$ phase is tracked with increasing laser fluence. Gradients with different steepness are patterned in the tungsten phase to create spin-orbit torque channels and, when interfaced with CoFeB, tungsten wires with a sufficiently strong gradient can switch the magnetization without an applied magnetic field.

To describe this behavior, we start by calculating the elastic properties of the dry nematic AG that appear to depend only on Young's modulus of the parent material (e.g. mullite), the volume fraction of the solid phase and the aspect ratio of the representative volume of nAG. The elastic constants are then used to solve elasto-hydrodynamic equations for various sound vibrations of nAG filled with 3He.

Because the emission intensity is heavily influenced by factors such as defect density and oxidation, it is critical to understand how they affect photoluminescence efficiency. However, due to the time-consuming process of identifying individual monolayers, studies of high-quality exfoliated TMDs have been limited to only a few samples. Here, we present an investigation of excited-state lifetimes and spectra for over 200 WSe$_2$ exfoliated monolayers at room temperature. We find a linear correlation between photoluminescence lifetime and intensity across hundreds of monolayers and within individual monolayers. Results from intentional photooxidation experiments indicate that this correlation is due to photoinduced band-edge carrier traps, which introduce a nonradiative decay pathway that competes with exciton emission. Our work highlights the importance of controlling such traps, as they are the primary limitation of bright photoluminescence."}

We find that compressive $c$-axis strain modifies the charge order only within the superconducting state, with a striking polarization dependence: suppression in the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ channel and enhancement in the $d_{z^2}$ channel. X-ray absorption spectra reveal concomitant strain-induced modifications of the oxygen pre-edge and upper Hubbard band, consistent with increased $d_{z^2}$ orbital admixture. Our results suggest that $c$-axis pressure drives an orbital separation between superconductivity, rooted in $d_{x^2-y^2}$ states, and charge order, which gradually shifts to the $d_{z^2}$ channel. This orbital separation reveals a way for superconductivity and charge order to coexist in the cuprates with minimal competition. Furthermore, it suggests that the multi-order phase diagram of La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_4$ cannot be realistically described within single band models usually used to describe cuprate physics."}

We identify and analyze several extensions of Jarzynski's inequality that go beyond its direct derivation from the Jarzynski equality.

Furthermore, by employing functional-integral techniques, we extend Jarzynski's inequality to many-body statistical systems described by quantum field theory. Salient issues, such as connections of the Jarzynski inequality with the maximum work theorem and the Landau--Lifshitz theory of fluctuations, are also discussed."}

The recently discovered heavy-fermion spin-triplet superconductor candidate UTe$_2$ has sparked great interest for its ultrahigh upper critical field and reentrant SC phases in the proximity to a field-polarized magnetic state. Despite extensive studies on the phase diagrams and competing orders induced by pressure and magnetic field, limited has been known about its SC order parameters and their evolution with these control parameters, largely due to the lack of appropriate symmetry-sensitive detections. Here, we report comprehensive point-contact spectroscopy measurements of pressurized UTe$_2$ on the (0~0~1) surface. The observation of Andreev bound state strongly suggests the presence of a $p_z$ component in the SC order parameters. Quantitative analysis based on an extended Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk model unveils $B_{2u}$ or $B_{3u}$ as the most likely representation for both ambient and pressurized UTe$_2$, and remarkably, the multiple SC phases can be distinguished by a single parameter $\\langle Δ_{z}\\rangle/\\langleΔ_{x(y)}\\rangle$, the relative weight between the $p_z$-wave and $p_{x(y)}$-wave pairings. These findings not only impose stringent constraints on the superconducting order parameter in UTe$_2$, but also provide key spectroscopic evidence for the existence of multiple SC phases tuned through pressure."}

This Anderson pseudospin description captures the coherent nonequilibrium dynamics of the coupled electron-lattice system. Numerical simulations reveal three distinct dynamical regimes of the CDW order parameter following a quench-locked oscillations, Landau-damped dynamics, and overdamped relaxation-closely paralleling quench dynamics in BCS superconductors and other electronically driven symmetry-breaking phases. Crucially, however, the presence of dynamical lattice degrees of freedom leads to qualitatively different long-time behavior. In particular, while the oscillation amplitude is reduced in the damped regimes, CDW oscillations do not fully decay but instead persist indefinitely due to feedback from the lattice field. We further show that these persistent oscillations are characterized by a nonequilibrium electronic distribution, which provides an intuitive understanding of both their amplitude and the renormalization of the oscillation frequency relative to the bare Holstein phonon frequency. Our results highlight the essential role of lattice dynamics in nonequilibrium ordered phases and establish a clear distinction between electron-lattice-driven CDW dynamics and their purely electronic counterparts."}

A spin supersolid is characterized by the coexistence of longitudinal spin order that breaks lattice translational symmetry and transverse spin order associated with the spontaneous breaking of a spin U(1) symmetry. Extensive experimental investigations, together with advanced numerical studies, have now revealed a coherent and internally consistent picture of these phases, substantially deepening our understanding of supersolidity in quantum magnetic materials. Beyond their fundamental interest as exotic quantum states, potential applications in highly efficient demagnetization cooling have been supported by a giant magnetocaloric effect observed in candidate materials. Moreover, the possible dissipationless spin supercurrents could open promising perspectives for spin transport and spintronic applications. In this Review, we summarize recent progress on emergent spin supersolids in frustrated triangular-lattice quantum antiferromagnets. We survey experimental evidence from thermodynamic and spectroscopic measurements and compare these results with theoretical studies of minimal models addressing global phase diagrams, ground state properties, and collective excitations. In addition, we discuss characteristic spin-transport phenomena and outline future directions for exploring spin supersolids as functional quantum materials."}

By comparing experimental effective masses with band masses, we determined the electron-phonon coupling for each orbit. The results showed a clear Fermi-surface-sheet dependence of the electron-phonon coupling strength, especially highlighting that the coupling for the band-28 sheet is very weak, almost absent for the orbit with $B \\parallel c$. This finding is consistent with previous observations of dHvA oscillations from this orbit in the mixed state down to very low fields.

We studied geometry optimizations, relative stability, atomization energies, Fermi energy, energy gap, electronic properties, electric dipole moment, polarizabilities, and thermodynamic analysis, along with IR and NMR spectra. Consistently, our findings revealed distinct properties and characteristics among different C36 fullerene isomers. The energetic order of C36 fullerene isomers was established as C36-D3h < C36-C1 < C36-Cs < C36-C2 < C36-D2, a trend unaffected by the encapsulation of oxygen. Notably, the D2 isomer displayed the smallest energy gap, indicating higher electrical conductivity compared to other isomers, while it exhibited the largest gap after encapsulation. Furthermore, we observed that the C1 (D2) isomer exhibited the largest (smallest) Electric dipole moment among the studied C36 isomers, whereas the C2 (D2) isomer demonstrated the largest Electric dipole moment among the O@C36 isomers studied. The encapsulation of oxygen in C36 isomers influenced their properties, including alterations in electronic properties, IR, and NMR chemical shifts. A detailed analysis of BSSE corrections showed the tininess of their impact on the analyzed observables, such that uncorrected and BSSE-corrected calculations led to nearly identical results, confirming the robustness and reliability of the B3LYP/6-31G* approach used in this work and, eventually, in other large and rigid fullerenes systems."}

In contrast, La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ exhibits a pronounced twofold ($C_2$) anisotropy in its low-temperature electronic dynamics. This electronic nematicity, evident in both the relaxation dynamics and the effective gap scales, competes with a secondary isotropic order emerging below 115 K.

Time dependent square displacements are calculated directly from numerical solutions of Pauli master equations, for five different rate kernels: exact Fermi golden rule (FGR) rate expression, stationary phase interpolation (SPI) approximation, semiclassical (SC) approximation, classical Marcus rate expression, and Miller-Abrahams expression. All results demonstrate diffusive behavior in the steady state limit. The results based on the FGR rate expression show that the charge transport in quantum bath can be much more sensitive to the disorder than the prediction from the classical Marcus expression. While the SPI approximation captures this general trend reasonably well, the SC approximation tends to be unreliable at both quantitative and qualitative levels, and becomes even worse than the classical Marcus expression under certain conditions. These results offer useful guidance in the choice of approximate rate kernels for larger scale simulations, and also demonstrate significant but fragile positive effects of quantum environments on the charge hopping dynamics."}

In this work, we employed first-principles anharmonic lattice dynamics calculations to systematically investigate phonon transport in indium iodides from particle- and wave-like perspectives. The calculated lattice thermal conductivities of both materials remained below 1 W/m-K over a broad temperature range. Notably, the influence of wave-like phonon transport differed by composition: in InI3, the wave-like contribution became comparable to the particle-like Peierls contribution, whereas it remained negligible in InI. We also investigated the thermal transport properties of the experimentally reported high-pressure phase of InI3. Motivated by experimental indications of stacking faults and partial disorder in indium site occupancy within the rhombohedral phase, we constructed several ordered structural models with different stacking sequences. These stacking sequences exhibited no significant energetic preference and had similar lattice thermal conductivities, suggesting that in-plane thermal transport is largely governed by the vibrational properties of the In2I6 layers themselves rather than by the specific stacking sequence. These findings provide insight into phonon transport in layered and molecular-crystal systems with structural complexity and contribute to a broader understanding of thermal transport mechanisms in layered and molecular-crystal-like materials."}

The recently discovered heavy-fermion spin-triplet superconductor candidate UTe$_2$ has sparked great interest for its ultrahigh upper critical field and reentrant SC phases in the proximity to a field-polarized magnetic state. Despite extensive studies on the phase diagrams and competing orders induced by pressure and magnetic field, limited has been known about its SC order parameters and their evolution with these control parameters, largely due to the lack of appropriate symmetry-sensitive detections. Here, we report comprehensive point-contact spectroscopy measurements of pressurized UTe$_2$ on the (0~0~1) surface. The observation of Andreev bound state strongly suggests the presence of a $p_z$ component in the SC order parameters. Quantitative analysis based on an extended Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk model unveils $B_{2u}$ or $B_{3u}$ as the most likely representation for both ambient and pressurized UTe$_2$, and remarkably, the multiple SC phases can be distinguished by a single parameter $\\langle Δ_{z}\\rangle/\\langleΔ_{x(y)}\\rangle$, the relative weight between the $p_z$-wave and $p_{x(y)}$-wave pairings. These findings not only impose stringent constraints on the superconducting order parameter in UTe$_2$, but also provide key spectroscopic evidence for the existence of multiple SC phases tuned through pressure."}

A spin supersolid is characterized by the coexistence of longitudinal spin order that breaks lattice translational symmetry and transverse spin order associated with the spontaneous breaking of a spin U(1) symmetry. Extensive experimental investigations, together with advanced numerical studies, have now revealed a coherent and internally consistent picture of these phases, substantially deepening our understanding of supersolidity in quantum magnetic materials. Beyond their fundamental interest as exotic quantum states, potential applications in highly efficient demagnetization cooling have been supported by a giant magnetocaloric effect observed in candidate materials. Moreover, the possible dissipationless spin supercurrents could open promising perspectives for spin transport and spintronic applications. In this Review, we summarize recent progress on emergent spin supersolids in frustrated triangular-lattice quantum antiferromagnets. We survey experimental evidence from thermodynamic and spectroscopic measurements and compare these results with theoretical studies of minimal models addressing global phase diagrams, ground state properties, and collective excitations. In addition, we discuss characteristic spin-transport phenomena and outline future directions for exploring spin supersolids as functional quantum materials."}

In addition, these models could also be leveraged to reconstruct crystal structures for which partial information is available. One relevant example is the reliable determination of atomic positions occupied by hydrogen atoms in hydrogen-containing crystalline materials. While crucial to the analysis and prediction of many materials properties, the identification of hydrogen positions can however be difficult and expensive, as it is challenging in X-ray scattering experiments and often requires dedicated neutron scattering measurements. As a consequence, inorganic crystallographic databases frequently report lattice structures where hydrogen atoms have been either omitted or inserted with heuristics or by chemical intuition. Here, we combine diffusion models from the field of materials science with techniques originally developed in computer vision for image inpainting. We present how this knowledge transfer across domains enables a much faster and more accurate completion of host structures, compared to unconditioned diffusion models or previous approaches solely based on DFT. Overall, our approach exceeds a success rate of 97% in terms of finding a structural match or predicting a more stable configuration than the initial reference, when starting both from structures that were already relaxed with DFT, or directly from the experimentally determined host structures."}

For global and local fitness variables, the power spectral density exhibits $1/f^α$ with $0< α< 2$, indicative of long-range correlations.

However, the inherently incompatible nature of antiferromagnet, metallicity and polarity pose a significant challenge. We propose that charge disproportionation can lead to this novel state in negative charge transfer gap regime in molecular orbital crystal by molecular orbital analyses of first-principles DFT+$U$ electronic band structure for representative Ruddlesden-Popper bilayer perovskite oxides Sr$_3$Co$_2$O$_7$, corroborated by Density Matrix Renormalization Group calculation. Due to the negative charge transfer nature of Co$^{4+}$ and imposed by strong interlayer coupling, localized molecular orbitals stemming from the hybridization of Co $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{xz/yz}$ orbitals through the apical oxygen $p$ orbitals are preferably emergent within each bilayer unit, which develop antiferromagnetic ordering by invoking Hubbard repulsion. Charge disproportionation driven by Hund's physics, makes an occupation imbalance with broken inversion symmetry in the remaining $d_{xy}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals from distinct Co atoms within the bilayer unit, resulting in the polar metallicity. Meanwhile, this charge disproportionation scenario allows consequent conducting carriers to couple with interlayer local spins via Hund's coupling, giving rise to in-plane double-exchange ferromagnetism. Our molecular orbital formulation further provides a guide towards an effective Hamiltonian for modelling the unconventional synergy of metallicity, polarity and antiferromagnetism in Sr$_3$Co$_2$O$_7$, which may be a unified framework widely applicable to double-layer Ruddlesden-Popper perovskite oxides."}

Using a high-repetition-rate 95-keV ultrafast electron diffraction setup (UED), we measured the transient dynamics for the differential scattering signal in a momentum transfer, $q$, range longer than in conventional keV UED setups. Analysis of ten Bragg and six diffuse scattering revealed a prompt increase in the mean-square displacement (MSD), indicating rapid energy transfer from the excited electronic system to the lattice. The subsequent relaxation dynamics of the elastic scattering intensities exhibit a pronounced dependence on diffraction order. Lower-order reflections relax more rapidly, whereas higher-order reflections show significantly slower relaxation or near-plateau behaviour, indicating that lattice equilibration proceeds on multiple $q$-dependent timescales. Exponential fits to the MSD dynamics reveal oscillatory residuals, indicative of coherent non-thermal lattice motion. Power spectral density analysis of these residuals uncovers coherent lattice oscillations with a fundamental frequency of $ω_0 = 0.192$ THz, corresponding to the acoustic breathing (A$_{1g}$) mode of aluminium. Higher frequency components are also observed, consistent with coherent phonon oscillations originating from a single zero-wavevector mode populated by multiple coherent phonons. While individual phonon branches are not directly resolved, the observed dependence on the lattice plane of the relaxation behaviour and oscillatory signatures are consistent with a mode-selective lattice response and non-thermal energy redistribution as described by non-thermal lattice models."}

We show that nonreciprocity and the superconducting diode effect arise from the interplay between the Lifshitz invariant and fractional kinetics, with the latter serving as an effective, symmetry-consistent representation of fractal geometry and finite-range memory. Two complementary approaches are pursued. In a fractional integral GL formulation, spatial integration on a fractal space yields analytic solutions and reveals how rectification scales with the dimensionality of the fractal media and the strength of the Lifshitz-like drift. In a fractional derivative-based formulation derived via the Agrawal variational principle with left/right Caputo operators, we obtain a gauge-invariant free energy, the corresponding GL equations, and a current density. We use fractional orders as effective parameters that represent nonlocal and memory effects induced by fractal microstructure. Within a two-mode plane-wave approximation we derive a compact current-phase relation and an expression for the diode efficiency, and we map the rectification amplitude across the fractional kinetic and the Lifshitz/memory order. An exact single-sided solution in terms of Prabhakar functions further confirms robust, tunable nonreciprocity, including a near-ideal diode response. This identifies a pathway to near-perfect superconducting diodes by engineering fractal (fractional-kinetic) transport achieved by tuning the fractional orders and Lifshitz strength without invoking magnetic fields or geometric ratchets.

UTe2 stands out as the only known odd-parity, STC that harbors such intertwined orders on the surface and possible topological surface states composed of Majorana fermions.

Here, we apply a correlative tomography-based mass balance framework to Cr$_2$AlC, a coating candidate for accident tolerant nuclear fuel claddings and turbine blades, and show that decomposition and pore evolution during oxidation, quantified by integrating volumetric, structural and compositional data, are strongly governed by grain morphology. The oxidation of sputtered Cr$_2$AlC coatings with equiaxed and columnar grain morphologies was analyzed. While Cr$_7$C$_3$ formed in both coating morphologies, pores formed exclusively in columnar coatings. The expected Cr$_7$C$_3$ volume was estimated by mass-balance calculations assuming that Al-deintercalation enables oxide scale and Al-O-C-N precipitate formation, leading to complete transformation of the Al-deintercalated Cr$_2$AlC into Cr$_7$C$_3$. In equiaxed coatings, the predicted carbide volume agreed with tomography within 3 $\\pm$ 3 %, confirming Al-deintercalation-driven Cr$_7$C$_3$ formation. Despite the smaller molar volume of Cr$_7$C$_3$ relative to Cr$_2$AlC, absence of pores imply that transformation shrinkage is likely accommodated by coating thickness reduction. In columnar coatings, the predicted Cr$_7$C$_3$ volume exceeds the measured value by 22 $\\pm$ 4 %, and the pore volume expected from transformation shrinkage alone is 13-16 % lower than measured, indicating partial Al deintercalation and clustering of pre-existing defects. This combined methodology provides a general route to quantitatively resolve degradation mechanisms."}

Rev. B", "summary": "Characterizing magnetic fluctuations is one of the keys to understanding the origin of superconductivity in the spin-triplet superconductor UTe$_2$ which exhibits two superconducting (SC) phases (SC1 and SC2) under pressure: SC1 where a superconducting transition temperature of $T_{\\rm c}$ decreases with pressure while $T_{\\rm c}$ of SC2 rises with pressure. Previously, D. Ambika et al. [Phys. Rev. B 105, L220403 (2022)] have reported the possible coexistence of ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin fluctuations in UTe$_2$ under pressure from their nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements. To delve the relationship between the magnetic fluctuations and the two SC phases, we have carried out detailed $^{125}$Te NMR measurements on a single crystal of UTe$_2$ with $T_{\\rm c}$ = 1.6 K at various pressures ranging from 0 to 2.05 GPa. By comparing the temperature $T$ dependence of nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rates divided by temperature 1/$T_1T$ with that of the Knight shift $K$ for magnetic fields along the $a$, $b$, and $c$ directions, we evidence the enhancement of AFM spin fluctuations with increasing pressure. Based on the results, we suggest that FM spin fluctuations are more favorable for SC1 and AFM spin fluctuations are crucial for SC2. Our findings will inspire further study on this material to understand the peculiar SC phases in detail."}

These features include a transition in electrical resistivity from high-temperature, thermally activated behavior with a narrow gap at the Fermi level ($Δρ \\sim$ 20 meV) to a distinctive low-temperature plateau, as well as a surface-to-volume dependence of electrical resistivity at low temperatures. The topological nature of PuB$_6$ is further supported by the theoretical calculations, which show that GGA+$U$ is capable of capturing electronic, topological, and lattice properties of PuB$_6$ with much lower computational cost than DMFT."}

Although this framework has been highly successful in characterizing macroscopic fluctuations and correlations, a systematic derivation of fluctuating hydrodynamics from underlying stochastic microscopic dynamics remains obscure for broad classes of interacting systems. For stochastic lattice gas models with gradient dynamics and a single conserved density, we develop a path-integral based coarse-graining procedure that recovers fluctuating hydrodynamics in a controlled manner. Our analysis highlights the essential role of local-equilibrium averages, which go beyond naïve mean-field-type gradient expansions. We further extend this approach to interacting Brownian particles by coarse-graining the Dean-Kawasaki equation, revealing a mobility proportional to the density and a diffusivity determined by the thermodynamic pressure."}

Perhaps most famously, the Hall-Petch relationship relates average grain size to strength. More challenging has been deriving relationships for properties that depend on subtle microstructural features and not average properties. One such example is the initiation of energetic materials under dynamical loading, dominated by energy localization on microstructural features such as pores, cracks, and interfaces. We propose a conditional convolutional neural network to predict the shock-induced temperature field as a function of shock strength, for a wide range of microstructures, and obtained via two different simulation methods. The proposed model, denoted MISTnet2, significantly extends prior work that was limited to a single shock strength, model, and type of microstructure. MISTnet2 can contribute to bridging atomistics with coarse-grain simulations and enable first principles predictions of detonation initiation and safety of this class of materials."}

In particular, electric field-induced nonlinear responses may also enable intrinsic polarization-sensitive optical detectors. Despite numerous efforts, clear methods are still needed to remove experimental artifacts, separating intrinsic from extrinsic effects, and disentangling linear responses from their higher-order counterparts. Here, we provide a systematic study of fabrication and measurement techniques to remove external artifacts in photoelectronic responses. This reveals a previously hidden photothermoelectric response in the transverse photoresistivity of symmetric thin films of simple metals. We identify its origin in thermal gradients producing current deflection and determine the device design and measurement parameters to minimize extrinsic effects that arise in photoinduced electronic responses."}

In this context, we consider a zigzag-ordered antiferromagnet with both extended Kitaev and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions (DMI) in presence of an external magnetic field to focus on the topological phases demonstrated by the magnon band structure and validated by the transport properties. The hybridization between the up- and down-spin sectors carries evidences of opening bulk gaps in the magnon band structure, giving rise to nontrivial topological phases characterized by finite Chern numbers, chiral edge modes, and a nonzero thermal Hall conductivity. Furthermore, generally speaking, a finite magnon orbital moment can exist and contribute to the Nernst response even when the net spin moment vanishes owing to the fundamental independence of the spin and orbital magnetizations. This motivates us to investigate the magnon orbital moment, orbital Berry curvature, and the resulting orbital Nernst conductivity associated with the magnon bands. We find that a giant orbital Nernst conductivity emerges even in the absence of an external magnetic field. Moreover, the distinction between different topological phases is more lucidly manifested via the orbital Nernst conductivity, thereby highlighting an enhanced sensitivity of the orbital transport to the underlying band topology. For completeness, we briefly discuss the scenario corresponding to a Néel-ordered spin alignment, which leads to a vanishing Chern number and consequently suppressed thermal Hall and orbital Nernst conductivities compared to the zigzag-ordered case, even in the presence of DMI and Kitaev interactions."}

The core of the proposed methodology is the generation of a novel dataset using specially designed body force fields with compact support (BFCS), enabling a new RVE concept that reduces the infinite periodic medium to a finite domain without boundary artifacts. This functionally reduced RVE is used for translated averaging of direct numerical simulations (DNS) results, efficiently computed via a newly developed FFT-based solver for BFCS loading. The resulting dataset captures localized field responses and is used to train machine learning (ML) and neural networks (NN) models to learn effective nonlocal surrogate operators. These operators accurately predict macroscopic responses while reflecting microstructural features and nonlocal interactions. By accounting for field localization while simultaneously eliminating influences from finite sample size and boundary effects, it provides a physically grounded and data-driven framework for constructing accurate surrogate models for the homogenization of complex materials."}

To achieve near-quantum accuracy, it is necessary that neighborhoods contained in the training set are rather close to the ones encountered during a simulation. Yet, constructing a single training set that works well for all applications is, and likely will remain, infeasible, so, one strategy is to supplement training protocols for MLIPs with additional learning methods, such as active learning, or fine-tuning. This strategy, however, yields very complex training protocols that are difficult to implement efficiently, and cumbersome to interpret, analyze, and reproduce.\n  To address the above difficulties, we propose AutoPot, a software for automating the construction and archiving of MLIPs. AutoPot is based on BlackDynamite, a software operating parametric tasks, e.g., running simulations, or single-point ab initio calculations, in a highly-parallelized fashion, and Motoko, an event-based workflow manager for orchestrating interactions between the tasks. The initial version of AutoPot supports selection of training configurations from large training candidate sets, and on-the-fly selection from molecular dynamics simulations, using Moment Tensor Potentials as implemented in MLIP-2, and single-point calculations of the selected training configurations using VASP. Another strength of AutoPot is its flexibility: BlackDynamite tasks and orchestrators are Python functions to which own existing code can be easily added and manipulated without writing complex parsers. Therefore, it will be straightforward to add other MLIP and ab initio codes, and manipulate the Motoko orchestrators to implement other training protocols."}

We studied geometry optimizations, relative stability, atomization energies, Fermi energy, energy gap, electronic properties, electric dipole moment, polarizabilities, and thermodynamic analysis, along with IR and NMR spectra. Consistently, our findings revealed distinct properties and characteristics among different C36 fullerene isomers. The energetic order of C36 fullerene isomers was established as C36-D3h < C36-C1 < C36-Cs < C36-C2 < C36-D2, a trend unaffected by the encapsulation of oxygen. Notably, the D2 isomer displayed the smallest energy gap, indicating higher electrical conductivity compared to other isomers, while it exhibited the largest gap after encapsulation. Furthermore, we observed that the C1 (D2) isomer exhibited the largest (smallest) Electric dipole moment among the studied C36 isomers, whereas the C2 (D2) isomer demonstrated the largest Electric dipole moment among the O@C36 isomers studied. The encapsulation of oxygen in C36 isomers influenced their properties, including alterations in electronic properties, IR, and NMR chemical shifts. A detailed analysis of BSSE corrections showed the tininess of their impact on the analyzed observables, such that uncorrected and BSSE-corrected calculations led to nearly identical results, confirming the robustness and reliability of the B3LYP/6-31G* approach used in this work and, eventually, in other large and rigid fullerenes systems."}

Molecular dynamics simulations of aqueous NaCl solutions using the TIP4P/2005 water model and the Madrid-2019 ion parameters reveal a systematic increase in the liquid-vapor critical temperature and pressure with salt concentration, consistent with experimental trends. In contrast, confinement between parallel hydrophobic plates leads to a depression of the critical point. The critical temperature was determined from the Binder cumulant crossing in the NVT ensemble, using a recently developed method originally applied to an active Brownian particle system. The reliability of this approach was verified through complementary NPT simulations. We further demonstrate the pronounced sensitivity of the estimated critical point to the van der Waals cutoff distance, underscoring the importance of properly accounting for long-range interactions. Our framework, which employs and tests an adjusted subbox method, can be readily extended to other critical phenomena, including the liquid-liquid critical point of water."}
