However, their microscopic origin remains unclear due to competing electronic orders, strong spin-orbit coupling, and structural instabilities in the normal state. Here we investigate the role of interlayer breathing and shear modes in superconducting vdW heterostructures. Contrary to conventional wisdom -- which assumes that weak interlayer bonding and large layer separation suppress electronic coupling to these modes -- we show that the associated charge transfer can generate a substantial pairing interaction. We develop a theory of superconductivity mediated by such interlayer modes and demonstrate that proximity to a ferroelectric or antiferroelectric quantum critical point provides a strong-coupling pairing channel. Within a two-dimensional model with SU(2) symmetry and in-plane isotropy, we find an accidental degeneracy between interlayer triplet states, which can occur even for an $s$-wave in-plane gap. We further show that Josephson coupling between layers, arising from either static magnetism or induced by paramagnetic correlations, can stabilize a time-reversal-symmetry-breaking superconducting state of the $s+i\\,s$ type, which couples to magnetization when at least two mirror symmetries are absent. Our results are directly applicable to candidate chiral vdW superconductors such as 4Hb-TaS$_2$ and to sliding ferroelectric metals, exemplified by bilayer MoTe$_2$. More broadly, our work identifies ferroelectric fluctuations as a promising route to unconventional pairing in vdW systems and motivates experimental searches for chiral multicomponent superconductivity."}

Understanding how device geometry governs nonlinear electrodynamics is crucial for implementing superconducting quantum technologies. However, to date, research has largely been limited to superconducting nanostructures with collinearly aligned static and dynamic applied magnetic fields. Here, we analyze the dynamics of Meissner currents and Abrikosov vortices in a superconducting nanocube exposed to combined static and microwave magnetic fields, extending the analysis to a more general excitation geometry. We demonstrate that, in a noncollinear configuration,the magnetization component parallel to the static field develops a dominant second-harmonic response under the microwave driving. This effect is strongly enhanced when Meissner currents saturate at static fields just below the thresholds for successive vortex nucleation. By numerically solving the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations, we show that the response originates from Meissner-current saturation combined with the nonlinear oscillations of normal-phase indentations, yielding an anisotropic second-harmonic signal that is directionally separated from, and not overshadowed by, the first-harmonic component of the dynamic magnetization. These findings are relevant for superconducting devices that require controllable high-frequency nonlinearity."}

Any correspondence produced by the algorithm is explicitly verified, ensuring that non-isomorphic graphs are never incorrectly identified as isomorphic. Although the method does not yet guarantee success on all isomorphic inputs, we find that it correctly resolves every instance tested in deterministic polynomial time, including a broad collection of graphs known to be difficult for classical spectral techniques.

Accurate and efficient simulation of radiative gas dynamics is therefore indispensable for reliable design of thermal protection systems for atmospheric entry vehicles. In this study, a Boltzmann-type kinetic model for radiative gas flows is solved across a broad spectrum of flow and radiation transport regimes using the general synthetic iterative scheme (GSIS). The approach integrates an unstructured finite-volume discrete velocity method with a set of macroscopic synthetic equations. Within this framework, the kinetic model provides high-order closures for the constitutive relations in the synthetic equations. Simultaneously, the macroscopic synthetic equations drive the evolution of the mesoscopic kinetic system, significantly accelerating steady-state convergence in near-continuum regimes, as substantiated by linear Fourier stability analysis. Crucially, the algorithm is proven to be asymptotic-preserving, correctly recovering the continuum and optically thick limits, represented by the radiative Navier-Stokes-Fourier equations governing distinct translational, rotational, vibrational, and radiative temperatures, on coarse meshes independent of the mean free path. Numerical simulations of challenging benchmarks, including three-dimensional hypersonic flow over an Apollo reentry capsule, demonstrate that GSIS achieves orders-of-magnitude speedup over conventional iterative schemes in multiscale simulations of radiative gas flows while accurately capturing non-equilibrium effects and radiative heat transfer in hypersonic environments."}

Coplanar AFMs displaying such odd-parity unidirectional spin splittings are known as odd-parity magnets. In this work, we propose the realization of their missing even-parity counterparts. We begin by deriving the symmetry conditions required for an even-parity, out-of-plane spin splitting. We then show that irradiating a spin-degenerate coplanar AFM with circularly polarized light lifts the $[\\bar{C}_{2z}|\\mathcal{T}]$ constraint, dynamically generating this even-parity state. Specifically, the light-induced unidirectional spin splitting exhibits a $d$-wave texture in momentum space, akin to that of a $d$-wave altermagnet. We prove this texture's robustness against spin canting and show it yields a unique clover-like angular dependence in the Drude spin conductivity.

However, most existing formulations rely on hand-crafted, symmetry-aware descriptors, whose construction is often system-specific and can hinder generality and transferability across different lattice Hamiltonians. Here we introduce a symmetry-preserving framework based on equivariant neural networks (ENNs) that provides a general, data-driven mapping from local configurations of dynamical variables to the associated on-site forces in a lattice Hamiltonian. In contrast to ENN architectures developed for molecular systems -- where continuous Euclidean symmetries dominate -- our approach aims to embed the discrete point-group and internal symmetries intrinsic to lattice models directly into the neural-network representation of the force field. As a proof of principle, we construct an ENN-based force-field model for the adiabatic dynamics of the Holstein Hamiltonian on a square lattice, a canonical system for electron-lattice physics. The resulting ML-enabled large-scale dynamical simulations faithfully capture mesoscale evolution of the symmetry-breaking phase, illustrating the utility of lattice-equivariant architectures for linking microscopic electronic processes to emergent dynamical behavior in condensed-matter lattice systems."}

The method is built around a finite volume formulation of the equations in which a Riemann solver is used to compute fluxes on the faces between grid cells, and a face-centered constrained transport formulation of the induction equation. The small time step problem associated with the cut cells is avoided by always computing fluxes on the faces and edges of the Cartesian mesh. We extend the method to model a moving interface between two materials with different properties using a ghost-fluid approach, and show some preliminary results including shock-wave-driven and magnetically-driven dynamical compressions of magnetohydrostatic equilibria. We present a thorough verification of the method and show that it converges at second order in the absence of discontinuities, and at first order with a discontinuity in material properties."}

Here, we study the dynamics of a tracer -- active or passive -- embedded in a bath of active or passive particles, coupled through non-reciprocal interactions. Starting from the microscopic stochastic dynamics of the full system, we derive an overdamped generalized Langevin equation for the tracer, incorporating a non-Markovian memory kernel that captures bath-mediated correlations. This framework enables us to compute the tracer's velocity and displacement response, derive a generalized nonequilibrium fluctuation-dissipation relation that quantifies deviations from equilibrium behavior, and determine the mean-squared displacement (MSD). We find that while the MSD becomes asymptotically diffusive, the effective diffusivity depends non-monotonically on the degree of non-reciprocity and diverges at an intermediate value. This regime of giant diffusivity provides a generic mechanism for enhanced transport in active soft matter and has direct implications for biological systems exhibiting chase-and-run or predator-prey interactions. Our analytical predictions are supported by numerical simulations of active Brownian particles, highlighting experimentally accessible signatures of non-reciprocal interactions in soft matter."}

Using both a symmetry analysis and model calculations on the breathing kagome lattice, we show how the altermagnetic spin textures in Mn$_3$Pt generate a spin splitting of the electronic bands that remains magnetization-free even in the presence of spin-orbit coupling and, upon taking into account the proximity coupling across the interface, produces a superconducting diode effect. We also demonstrate that the angular dependence of the critical current provides a probe of the magnetic order. We hope that our work will contribute to the understanding and further discovery of candidate materials for novel altermagnet-superconductor hybrid devices."}

Application of a generalized master equation to pairs of the B850 units of LH2 complexes, where excitons predominantly reside, provide quantitative information on how the inter-LH2 exciton transfer depends on the distance, relative rotational angle, and the relative energies of the two LH2s. The distance dependence demonstrates significant enhancement of the rate due to quantum delocalization of excitons, the qualitative nature of which remains robust against the disorder. The angle dependence reflects isotropic nature of exciton transfer, which remains similar for the ensemble of disorder. The variation of the rate on relative excitation energies of LH2 exhibits resonance peaks, which however is fragile as the disorder becomes significant. Overall, the average transfer times between two LH2s are estimated to be in the range of 4 - 25 ps for physically plausible inter-LH2 distances."}

Recent work has extended ML force-field approaches to adiabatic dynamical simulations of condensed-matter lattice models with coupled electronic and structural or magnetic degrees of freedom. However, most existing formulations rely on hand-crafted, symmetry-aware descriptors, whose construction is often system-specific and can hinder generality and transferability across different lattice Hamiltonians. Here we introduce a symmetry-preserving framework based on equivariant neural networks (ENNs) that provides a general, data-driven mapping from local configurations of dynamical variables to the associated on-site forces in a lattice Hamiltonian. In contrast to ENN architectures developed for molecular systems -- where continuous Euclidean symmetries dominate -- our approach aims to embed the discrete point-group and internal symmetries intrinsic to lattice models directly into the neural-network representation of the force field. As a proof of principle, we construct an ENN-based force-field model for the adiabatic dynamics of the Holstein Hamiltonian on a square lattice, a canonical system for electron-lattice physics. The resulting ML-enabled large-scale dynamical simulations faithfully capture mesoscale evolution of the symmetry-breaking phase, illustrating the utility of lattice-equivariant architectures for linking microscopic electronic processes to emergent dynamical behavior in condensed-matter lattice systems."}

We perform experiments for both commercial single-layer PTLs and microporous layer (MPL)-integrated configurations to benchmark the electrochemical model, achieving excellent agreement between modeling and measurements. We show that in single-layer PTLs, open porous networks facilitate mass transport but incur large voltage penalties from PTL-anode catalyst layer (ACL) contact resistance. Bilayer architectures with dense MPLs reduce these losses by simultaneously improving transport, contact, and structural stability. Finally, in stratified multilayer stacks, combining fine pores near the ACL with highly porous backing layers delivers superior performance at high current densities. Altogether, these results establish mechanistic guidelines for porosity-informed PTL design that minimize interfacial resistance and enable high-efficiency PEMWE operation."}

TE-coupled spectra closely reproduce bulk behavior. In contrast, TM coupling induces strong inhomogeneous broadening and an asymmetric low-energy shoulder of the site S1 Y1Z1 transition, with linewidths exceeding those of the bulk by more than a factor of four. Temperature-dependent measurements and surface termination studies indicate that surface charges are the dominant mechanism. Er$^{3+}$:YVO$_4$ remains largely unaffected by mode polarization, and surface termination leads only to minor spectral shifts.

The umbilic scaling function, obtained from Monte-Carlo simulations, for the simplest 3-lane scenario, appears to have an universal shape for a range of interaction parameters. Remarkably, the shape and dynamic exponent of the non-degenerate mode can be analytically predicted on the base of effective MCT, up to non-universal scaling factor. Our findings suggest the existence of novel universality classes with dynamical exponent $3/2$, appearing in long-lived hydrodynamic modes with equal characteristic velocities."}

Coplanar AFMs displaying such odd-parity unidirectional spin splittings are known as odd-parity magnets. In this work, we propose the realization of their missing even-parity counterparts. We begin by deriving the symmetry conditions required for an even-parity, out-of-plane spin splitting. We then show that irradiating a spin-degenerate coplanar AFM with circularly polarized light lifts the $[\\bar{C}_{2z}|\\mathcal{T}]$ constraint, dynamically generating this even-parity state. Specifically, the light-induced unidirectional spin splitting exhibits a $d$-wave texture in momentum space, akin to that of a $d$-wave altermagnet. We prove this texture's robustness against spin canting and show it yields a unique clover-like angular dependence in the Drude spin conductivity. Our work demonstrates that optical driving can generate novel spin-split phases in coplanar AFMs, thereby diversifying the landscape of materials exhibiting distinct spin splittings."}

Traditionally, these two phenomena can be represented by static charges, that participate in Coulomb interactions between atoms, and dynamic charges such as atomic polar tensors - aka Born effective charges - describing the response to an external electric field. We critically compare different approaches to learn both types of charges, taking bulk water and water clusters as paradigmatic examples: (1) Learning them independently; (2) Coupling static and dynamic charges based on their physical relationship with a single global coupling constant to account for dielectric screening; (3) Coupled learning with a local, environment-dependent screening factor. In the coupled case, correcting for dielectric screening is essential, yet the common assumption of homogeneous, isotropic screening breaks down in heterogeneous systems such as water clusters. A learned, environment-dependent screening restores high accuracy for the dynamical charges. However, the accuracy gain over independent dynamic predictions is negligible, while the computational cost increases compared to using separate models for static and dynamical charges. This suggests that, despite the formal connection between the two charge types, modeling them independently is the more practical choice for both condensed-phase and isolated cluster systems."}

A pronounced non-monotonic response was observed, with the maximum anomalous Ettingshausen effect, transverse charge-to-heat conversion in magnetic materials, appearing in the atomic-heterogeneity regime well before crystallization. This enhancement was not captured by conventional structural or longitudinal transport measurements, highlighting the exceptional sensitivity of transverse thermoelectric phenomena to subtle structural heterogeneity.

As opposed to spin-orbit coupling, the splitting resulting from these \"altermagnets\" is not a small relativistic correction and, in contrast to ferromagnets, not accompanied by a net magnetization and large stray fields. In particular, the theoretical analysis of the interplay of altermagnetism and superconductivity has taken center stage, while experimental investigations of their coexistence remain in their infancy. We here study heterostructures consisting of Nb thins films interfaced with the $T_1$ and $T_2$ phases of Mn$_3$Pt. These non-collinear magnetic states can be thought of as descendants from the same altermagnetic order in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. We demonstrate the non-trivial impact on the superconducting state of Nb, which exhibits a zero-field superconducting diode effect, despite the compensated ($T_2$) and nearly-compensated ($T_1$) magnetic order; the diode efficiencies can reach large values (up to 50$\\%$). The diode effect is found to be highly sensitive to the form of the magnetic order, illustrating its potential as a symmetry probe. The complex magnetic field and temperature dependence hint at a rich interplay of multiple contributing mechanisms. Our results define a new materials paradigm for dissipationless spintronics and magnetization-free diode functionality, while motivating further exploration of non-collinear altermagnetic superconductors."}

The above results are explained due to a subtle interplay of frustration, quantum fluctuation, and duality of eigen-spectra for the KH system when both the signs of $κ$ and $J$ are reversed. The maximum efficiency is shown to be dynamically related to eigen-spectra forming discrete narrow bands, where total spin angular momentum becomes a good quantum number.

When altermagnets with antiparallel Néel vectors are placed near the top and bottom surfaces, giving rise to the layer Hall effect with vanishing net Hall conductance, i.e., the altermagnet-induced layer Hall effect. In contrast, altermagnets with parallel Néel vectors lead to a quantized Chern insulating state, i.e., the altermagnet-induced anomalous Hall effect. We further analyze the dependence of the Hall conductance on the orientation of the in-plane magnetic field and demonstrate that the layer Hall effect becomes observable under a perpendicular electric field.

High entropy oxides represent one such group that has only been tentatively explored, mainly due to the inherent problem of navigating vast compositional spaces. Thanks to the emergence of machine learning, however, suitable tools are now readily available. Here, the task of finding oxygen carriers for chemical looping processes has been tackled by leveraging active learning-based strategies combined with first-principles calculations. High efficiency and efficacy have, moreover, been achieved by exploiting the power of recently developed machine learning interatomic potentials. Firstly, the proposed approaches were validated based on an established computational framework for identifying high entropy perovskites that can be used in chemical looping air separation and dry reforming. Chief among the insights thus gained was the identification of the best performing strategies, in the form of greedy or Thompson-based sampling based on uncertainty estimates obtained from Gaussian processes. Building on this newfound knowledge, the concept was applied to a more complex problem, namely the discovery of high entropy oxygen carriers for chemical looping oxygen uncoupling. This resulted in both qualitative as well as quantitative outcomes, including lists of specific materials with high oxygen transfer capacities and configurational entropies. Specifically, the best candidates were based on the known oxygen carrier CaMnO3 but also contained a variety of additional species, of which some, e.g., Ti; Co; Cu; and Ti, were expected while others were not, e.g., Y and Sm. The results suggest that adopting active learning approaches is critical in materials discovery, given that these methods are already shifting research practice and soon will be the norm."}

Floating-catalyst chemical vapor deposition is widely employed as a scalable synthesis route, where catalysts inevitably traverse spatially varying environments. However, prevailing interpretations of nanotube growth largely rely on ensemble monitoring or static, post-growth snapshots. Here, we combine digital isotope labeling with programmed temperature modulation to reconstruct the dynamic growth histories of supported individual nanotubes. Growth rates exhibit hysteresis and extraordinary sensitivity to temperature changes, indicating irreversible catalyst coarsening; nevertheless, the nanotube chirality remains robustly preserved across lengths exceeding 300 um. This sharp contrast between kinetic adaptability and structural memory in nanotube growth indicates that chirality control can be established at the nucleation stage, while allowing independent optimization of subsequent elongation. Our findings further call for a re-examination of static interpretations of diameter-determination mechanisms derived from post-growth snapshots."}

Coplanar AFMs displaying such odd-parity unidirectional spin splittings are known as odd-parity magnets. In this work, we propose the realization of their missing even-parity counterparts.

We then show that irradiating a spin-degenerate coplanar AFM with circularly polarized light lifts the $[\\bar{C}_{2z}|\\mathcal{T}]$ constraint, dynamically generating this even-parity state. Specifically, the light-induced unidirectional spin splitting exhibits a $d$-wave texture in momentum space, akin to that of a $d$-wave altermagnet.

Here, we study the dynamics of a tracer -- active or passive -- embedded in a bath of active or passive particles, coupled through non-reciprocal interactions. Starting from the microscopic stochastic dynamics of the full system, we derive an overdamped generalized Langevin equation for the tracer, incorporating a non-Markovian memory kernel that captures bath-mediated correlations. This framework enables us to compute the tracer's velocity and displacement response, derive a generalized nonequilibrium fluctuation-dissipation relation that quantifies deviations from equilibrium behavior, and determine the mean-squared displacement (MSD). We find that while the MSD becomes asymptotically diffusive, the effective diffusivity depends non-monotonically on the degree of non-reciprocity and diverges at an intermediate value. This regime of giant diffusivity provides a generic mechanism for enhanced transport in active soft matter and has direct implications for biological systems exhibiting chase-and-run or predator-prey interactions.

Although they describe distinct material classes and produce seemingly different spin textures, they are conventionally treated as separate, unrelated theoretical frameworks. Here, this work demonstrates that the linear 2D Rashba and Weyl models are connected by a specific unitary transformation that maps one Hamiltonian exactly onto the other. The same unitary can be applied to map the linear Dresselhaus-1 model onto the Dresselhaus-2 models and vice versa. Such hidden correspondence establishes a unified theoretical foundation for spin-orbit interactions, deepening our conceptual understanding of spin-orbit coupling and opening new avenues for exploring complex spin textures. To illustrate the application, this work introduces a unique, improved, and more realistic model Hamiltonian H_MKM combining all known foundational spintronic models, where the stringent condition of equal spin-orbit coupling strength of Rashba and Dresselhaus may not be required to observe persistent spin texture under MKM transformation."}

The obtained data are coupled to a numerical drift-diffusion device model enabling evaluation of the performance of corresponding single junction devices. The first-principles simulation applies a hybrid exchange-correlation functional adapted to the studied family of compounds.

To ensure physical consistency, we address the issue of data leakage by excluding temperature-dependent thermodynamic descriptors (such as Gibbs free energy of mixing) and instead rely on physically motivated elemental features. The optimized model achieves a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.948 and a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 9928 which is about 5% relative error for HEAs on a validation set of approximately 1300 compositions.

An external Zeeman field with linear time dependency is used as the driving mechanism. The efficiency strongly depends on Kitaev ($κ$) and Heisenberg ($J$) exchange interaction. Interestingly, efficiency is comparable when the relative magnitude of $κ$ and $J$ is the same but of opposite signs. The above results are explained due to a subtle interplay of frustration, quantum fluctuation, and duality of eigen-spectra for the KH system when both the signs of $κ$ and $J$ are reversed. The maximum efficiency is shown to be dynamically related to eigen-spectra forming discrete narrow bands, where total spin angular momentum becomes a good quantum number. We relate this optimum efficiency to the realization of weakly interacting magnons, where the system reduces to an approximate eigen-system of the external drive. Finally, we extend our study to the large spin Kitaev model and find a quantum advantage in efficiency for $S=1/2$.

High entropy oxides represent one such group that has only been tentatively explored, mainly due to the inherent problem of navigating vast compositional spaces. Thanks to the emergence of machine learning, however, suitable tools are now readily available. Here, the task of finding oxygen carriers for chemical looping processes has been tackled by leveraging active learning-based strategies combined with first-principles calculations. High efficiency and efficacy have, moreover, been achieved by exploiting the power of recently developed machine learning interatomic potentials. Firstly, the proposed approaches were validated based on an established computational framework for identifying high entropy perovskites that can be used in chemical looping air separation and dry reforming. Chief among the insights thus gained was the identification of the best performing strategies, in the form of greedy or Thompson-based sampling based on uncertainty estimates obtained from Gaussian processes. Building on this newfound knowledge, the concept was applied to a more complex problem, namely the discovery of high entropy oxygen carriers for chemical looping oxygen uncoupling. This resulted in both qualitative as well as quantitative outcomes, including lists of specific materials with high oxygen transfer capacities and configurational entropies. Specifically, the best candidates were based on the known oxygen carrier CaMnO3 but also contained a variety of additional species, of which some, e.g., Ti; Co; Cu; and Ti, were expected while others were not, e.g., Y and Sm. The results suggest that adopting active learning approaches is critical in materials discovery, given that these methods are already shifting research practice and soon will be the norm."}

Understanding how device geometry governs nonlinear electrodynamics is crucial for implementing superconducting quantum technologies. However, to date, research has largely been limited to superconducting nanostructures with collinearly aligned static and dynamic applied magnetic fields. Here, we analyze the dynamics of Meissner currents and Abrikosov vortices in a superconducting nanocube exposed to combined static and microwave magnetic fields, extending the analysis to a more general excitation geometry. We demonstrate that, in a noncollinear configuration,the magnetization component parallel to the static field develops a dominant second-harmonic response under the microwave driving. This effect is strongly enhanced when Meissner currents saturate at static fields just below the thresholds for successive vortex nucleation. By numerically solving the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations, we show that the response originates from Meissner-current saturation combined with the nonlinear oscillations of normal-phase indentations, yielding an anisotropic second-harmonic signal that is directionally separated from, and not overshadowed by, the first-harmonic component of the dynamic magnetization.

Here, we combine digital isotope labeling with programmed temperature modulation to reconstruct the dynamic growth histories of supported individual nanotubes. Growth rates exhibit hysteresis and extraordinary sensitivity to temperature changes, indicating irreversible catalyst coarsening; nevertheless, the nanotube chirality remains robustly preserved across lengths exceeding 300 um.

From $x > 0.50$, we observe signatures of Kondo coherence and a heavy Fermi liquid regime at low temperature. Finally, at high cerium concentration $x \\geq 0.85$, we observe signatures of magnetic ordering at low temperatures. We discuss our results by introducing temperature scales related to superconductivity, the Kondo effect, and magnetic order, which permits building a rich phase diagram temperature versus cerium content $x$. This shows that using the cerium concentration $x$ as a unique control parameter, we can explore the Kondo entanglement between correlated $3d$ and $4f$ electrons, which suggests an unusual change between the superconducting state related to the $3d$ electrons and the Kondo coherent state involving both $3d$ and $4f$ electrons."}

Using Clisby's tree data structure and the scale-free pivot algorithm, for each $k$ between $10$ and $27$ we generated $2^{43-k}$ polygons of size $n=2^k$. Using a new knot diagram simplification and invariant-free knot classification code, we were able to determine the precise knot type of each polygon. The results show that the number of prime summands of knot type $K$ in a random $n$-gon is very well described by a Poisson distribution. We estimate the characteristic length of knotting as $656500 \\pm 2500$. We use the count of summands for large $n$ to measure knotting rates and amplitude ratios of knot probabilities more accurately than previous experiments. Our calculations agree quite well with previous on-lattice computations, and support both knot localization and the knot entropy conjecture."}

Recent work has extended ML force-field approaches to adiabatic dynamical simulations of condensed-matter lattice models with coupled electronic and structural or magnetic degrees of freedom. However, most existing formulations rely on hand-crafted, symmetry-aware descriptors, whose construction is often system-specific and can hinder generality and transferability across different lattice Hamiltonians. Here we introduce a symmetry-preserving framework based on equivariant neural networks (ENNs) that provides a general, data-driven mapping from local configurations of dynamical variables to the associated on-site forces in a lattice Hamiltonian. In contrast to ENN architectures developed for molecular systems -- where continuous Euclidean symmetries dominate -- our approach aims to embed the discrete point-group and internal symmetries intrinsic to lattice models directly into the neural-network representation of the force field. As a proof of principle, we construct an ENN-based force-field model for the adiabatic dynamics of the Holstein Hamiltonian on a square lattice, a canonical system for electron-lattice physics. The resulting ML-enabled large-scale dynamical simulations faithfully capture mesoscale evolution of the symmetry-breaking phase, illustrating the utility of lattice-equivariant architectures for linking microscopic electronic processes to emergent dynamical behavior in condensed-matter lattice systems."}

The phase space has, starting from three lanes and more, an umbilic manifold where characteristic velocities of all the modes but one coincide, thus allowing us to study a weakly hyperbolic system with arbitrarily large degeneracy. We then study space-time fluctuations in the steady state, at the umbilic manifold, which are expected to exhibit universal scaling features. We formulate an effective mode-coupling theory (MCT) for the multilane model within the umbilic subspace and test its predictions. Unlike in the bidirectional two-lane model with an umbilic point studied earlier, here we find a robust $z=3/2$ dynamical exponent for the umbilic mode. The umbilic scaling function, obtained from Monte-Carlo simulations, for the simplest 3-lane scenario, appears to have an universal shape for a range of interaction parameters. Remarkably, the shape and dynamic exponent of the non-degenerate mode can be analytically predicted on the base of effective MCT, up to non-universal scaling factor. Our findings suggest the existence of novel universality classes with dynamical exponent $3/2$, appearing in long-lived hydrodynamic modes with equal characteristic velocities."}

Grimm", "Joel D. Eaves"], "title": "Stochastic Path Compression for Spectral Tensor Networks on Cyclic Graphs", "comment": "7 pages, 3 figures", "summary": "We develop a new approach to compress cyclic tensor networks called stochastic path compression (SPC) that uses an iterative importance sampling procedure to target edges with large bond-dimensions. Closed random walks in SPC form compression pathways that spatially localize large bond-dimensions in the tensor network. Analogous to the phase separation of two immiscible liquids, SPC separates the graph of bond-dimensions into spatially distinct high and low density regions. When combined with our integral decimation algorithm, SPC facilitates the accurate compression of cyclic tensor networks with continuous degrees of freedom. To benchmark and illustrate the methods, we compute the absolute thermodynamics of $q$-state clock models on two-dimensional square lattices and an XY model on a Watts-Strogatz graph, which is a small-world network with random connectivity between spins."}

The suggested workflow allows systematic investigation of structural stability, binding affinity, and electronic properties across biological and materials science domains by utilizing complementary tools like Avogadro for molecular construction and visualization, AutoDock for docking and interaction analysis, and ORCA for high-level electronic structure computations. Uncertainty, configurational sampling, and optimization in high-dimensional chemical spaces are addressed by combining Monte Carlo-based and annealing-inspired techniques. The work shows how materials science ideas such as polymer design, thin films, crystalline lattices, and bioelectronic systems can be applied to drug development. On-device, open-source computational methods are viable, scalable, and economical, as demonstrated by comparative platform analysis. All things considered, the findings highlight the need of an integrated, repeatable computational pipeline for speeding up de novo molecule assembly and materials architecture while lowering experimental risk and expense."}

Focusing on ionic liquids (ILs) as alternatives to traditional amine-based solvents, we successfully identify new IL candidates with high working capacity, manageable viscosity, favorable regeneration energy, and viable synthetic routes. Our approach follows a five-stage pipeline. First, we generate IL candidates by pairing available cation and anion molecules, then predict temperature- and pressure-dependent CO2 solubility and viscosity using a GNN-based molecular property prediction model. Next, we convert solubility to working capacity and regeneration energy via Van't Hoff modeling, and then find the best set of candidates using Pareto optimization, before finally filtering those based on feasible synthesis routes. We identify 36 feasible candidates that could enable 5-10% OPEX savings and up to 10% CAPEX reductions through lower regeneration energy requirements and reduced corrosivity-offering a novel carbon-capture strategy for refineries moving forward."}
