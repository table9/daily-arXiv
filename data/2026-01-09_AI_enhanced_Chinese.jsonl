While an established graphical user interface (GUI) exists for simulation setup and execution, efficient post-processing, comparison of multiple simulations, and preparation of specific input file parameters remain limited. In this work, we present a web-based interface (sdtrimsp.streamlit.app) that complements existing SDTrimSP tools by focusing on interactive visualization and analysis of depth distribution profiles. The platform enables direct upload and comparison of static and fluence-dependent dynamic profiles, supports unit conversion, and provides an integrated calculator for determining the adjustable atomic density parameter of implanted ions required in dynamic simulations. In addition, the interface offers automated conversion of standard crystallographic file formats into the SDTrimSP-specific crystal structure input format for simulations into crystalline targets. The capabilities of the interface are demonstrated for nitrogen ion implantation into vanadium, including amorphous static and dynamic simulations and static crystalline simulations for different surface orientations. The results illustrate fluence-dependent saturation effects as well as orientation-dependent ion channeling behavior. Overall, the presented web-based tool provides a convenient and flexible extension to existing SDTrimSP workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eWeb\u7684SDTrimSP\u6a21\u62df\u540e\u5904\u7406\u754c\u9762\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u66f2\u7ebf\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u548c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u6a21\u62df\u6bd4\u8f83\u3001\u5355\u4f4d\u8f6c\u6362\u548c\u6676\u4f53\u7ed3\u6784\u8f93\u5165\u683c\u5f0f\u8f6c\u6362\u3002", "motivation": "SDTrimSP\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u79bb\u5b50\u6ce8\u5165\u6a21\u62df\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u5df2\u6709GUI\u7528\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u8bbe\u7f6e\u548c\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u540e\u5904\u7406\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u62df\u6bd4\u8f83\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u8f93\u5165\u53c2\u6570\u51c6\u5907\u65b9\u9762\u529f\u80fd\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eStreamlit\u7684Web\u754c\u9762(sdtrimsp.streamlit.app)\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u76f4\u63a5\u4e0a\u4f20\u548c\u6bd4\u8f83\u9759\u6001\u53ca\u52a8\u6001\u6df1\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u66f2\u7ebf\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5355\u4f4d\u8f6c\u6362\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u62df\u6240\u9700\u539f\u5b50\u5bc6\u5ea6\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u81ea\u52a8\u8f6c\u6362\u6807\u51c6\u6676\u4f53\u5b66\u6587\u4ef6\u683c\u5f0f\u4e3aSDTrimSP\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u6676\u4f53\u7ed3\u6784\u8f93\u5165\u683c\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u5de5\u5177\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6c2e\u79bb\u5b50\u6ce8\u5165\u9492\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u975e\u6676\u6001\u9759\u6001/\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u8868\u9762\u53d6\u5411\u7684\u9759\u6001\u6676\u4f53\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u901a\u91cf\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u9971\u548c\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u53d6\u5411\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u79bb\u5b50\u6c9f\u9053\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eWeb\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u4e3a\u73b0\u6709SDTrimSP\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4fbf\u6377\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u548c\u5206\u6790\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Recently, the promising room-temperature spin centre named ST1 was identified as an oxygen centre, but of still unknown atomic structure and thermal stability. In this work, we report on the optically active oxygen-related centres and the conditions for their formation, using ion implantation of oxygen in various conditions of depth and fluence. More specifically, we establish the temperature formation/stability range of the ST1 centre, which has a maximum at about 1100\u00b0C and is narrower than for NV centres. In these conditions, optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) on small ST1 ensembles was measured with a spin readout contrast of > 20% at 300K. In cathodoluminescence, the 535 nm ST1 peak is not observed. Besides, a broad peak centred at 460 nm is measured for implantation of O$_2$ molecular ions. For an annealing temperature of 1500\u00b0C, a different centre is formed (with ZPL at 584.5 nm) with an intensity increasing with a power law 1.5 < p < 1.9 dependence from the implantation fluence. This suggests that this centre contains two oxygen atoms. Besides, a new spectral feature associated to an intrinsic defect was also observed, with four prominent lines (especially at 594nm). Finally, the thermal formation and stability of oxygen centres in diamond presented here are important for the identification of the atomic structure of defects such as the ST1 and possible O$_2$V$_x$ complex by means of ab initio calculations. Indeed, the formation energies and charge states of defect centres are easier to compute than the full energy level scheme, which to date still remains unsuccessful regarding the ST1 centre.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u6c27\u79bb\u5b50\u6ce8\u5165\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u91d1\u521a\u77f3\u4e2d\u6c27\u76f8\u5173\u7f3a\u9677\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662fST1\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff09\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u6761\u4ef6\u3001\u70ed\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5149\u5b66\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u539f\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1ST1\u4e2d\u5fc3\u88ab\u9274\u5b9a\u4e3a\u6c27\u76f8\u5173\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u539f\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u70ed\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4ecd\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63ed\u793a\u6c27\u76f8\u5173\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u8bba\u8ba1\u7b97\u63d0\u4f9b\u5173\u952e\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6c27\u79bb\u5b50\u6ce8\u5165\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u5242\u91cf\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5236\u5907\u6837\u54c1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5149\u5b66\u68c0\u6d4b\u78c1\u5171\u632f\uff08ODMR\uff09\u3001\u9634\u6781\u53d1\u5149\u5149\u8c31\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u5149\u5b66\u548c\u81ea\u65cb\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86ST1\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u5f62\u6210\u6e29\u5ea6\u7ea61100\u00b0C\uff0c\u5728300K\u4e0b\u83b7\u5f97>20%\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u8bfb\u51fa\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\uff1b\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u65b0\u7684584.5nm\u96f6\u58f0\u5b50\u7ebf\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff0c\u5176\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6ce8\u5165\u5242\u91cf\u54481.5-1.9\u6b21\u5e42\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6c27\u539f\u5b50\uff1b\u8fd8\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u65b0\u7684\u672c\u5f81\u7f3a\u9677\u7279\u5f81\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e3aST1\u7b49\u6c27\u76f8\u5173\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u539f\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u9274\u5b9a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u70ed\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ea6\u675f\u5c06\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u4ece\u5934\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u63ed\u793a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u5fae\u89c2\u7ed3\u6784\u3002"}}

This limitation is critical for buffer layer graphene, a semiconducting interfacial phase, whose vibrational signatures are overlapped with the SiC background and challenging to be reliably accessed using conventional reference-based subtraction, due to strong spatial and experimental variability of the substrate signal. Here we present SpectraFormer, a transformer-based deep learning model that reconstructs the SiC Raman substrate contribution directly from post-growth partially masked spectroscopic data without relying on explicit reference measurements. By learning global correlations across the entire Raman shift range, the model captures the statistical structure of the SiC background and enables accurate reconstruction of its contribution in mixed spectra. Subtraction of the reconstructed substrate signal reveals weak vibrational features associated with ZLG that are inaccessible through conventional analysis methods. The extracted spectra are validated by ab initio vibrational calculations, allowing assignment of the resolved features to specific modes and confirming their physical consistency. By leveraging a state-of-the-art attention-based deep learning architecture, this approach establishes a robust, reference-free framework for Raman analysis of graphene on SiC and provides a foundation, compatible with real-time data acquisition, to its integration into automated, closed-loop AI-assisted growth optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSpectraFormer\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u77f3\u58a8\u70ef/\u78b3\u5316\u7845\u6df7\u5408\u62c9\u66fc\u5149\u8c31\u4e2d\u91cd\u5efa\u78b3\u5316\u7845\u57fa\u5e95\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u53c2\u8003\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63ed\u793a\u7f13\u51b2\u5c42\u77f3\u58a8\u70ef\u7684\u5f31\u632f\u52a8\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "motivation": "\u78b3\u5316\u7845\u57fa\u5e95\u5f3a\u70c8\u7684\u4e8c\u9636\u62c9\u66fc\u54cd\u5e94\u4e25\u91cd\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u77f3\u58a8\u70ef\u7684\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7f13\u51b2\u5c42\u77f3\u58a8\u70ef\uff0c\u5176\u632f\u52a8\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u57fa\u5e95\u4fe1\u53f7\u91cd\u53e0\uff0c\u4e14\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u53c2\u8003\u7684\u6263\u9664\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u57fa\u5e95\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u800c\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1SpectraFormer\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u6574\u4e2a\u62c9\u66fc\u4f4d\u79fb\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u751f\u957f\u540e\u90e8\u5206\u63a9\u853d\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u76f4\u63a5\u91cd\u5efa\u78b3\u5316\u7845\u57fa\u5e95\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u663e\u5f0f\u53c2\u8003\u6d4b\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u91cd\u5efa\u6df7\u5408\u5149\u8c31\u4e2d\u7684\u57fa\u5e95\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u6263\u9664\u540e\u63ed\u793a\u51fa\u4f20\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u8bbf\u95ee\u7684\u7f13\u51b2\u5c42\u77f3\u58a8\u70ef\u5f31\u632f\u52a8\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u5934\u7b97\u632f\u52a8\u8ba1\u7b97\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u786e\u8ba4\u4e86\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u78b3\u5316\u7845\u4e0a\u77f3\u58a8\u70ef\u7684\u62c9\u66fc\u5206\u6790\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7a33\u5065\u3001\u65e0\u53c2\u8003\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3001\u95ed\u73afAI\u8f85\u52a9\u751f\u957f\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u517c\u5bb9\u5b9e\u65f6\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\u3002"}}

Here we establish CEMO materials as a systematically discoverable class and introduce a graph-based framework to identify, classify, and organize transition-metal cluster motifs in inorganic solids. Starting from crystal structures in the Materials Project, we construct transition metal connectivity graphs, extract cluster motifs using a bond-cutting algorithm, and determine cluster point groups, effective cluster sublattice dimensionality, and translational symmetry. Applying this approach in a high-throughput screen of 34,548 compounds yields 5,306 cluster-containing materials, including 2,627 stable or metastable compounds with isolated clusters and 984 materials featuring mixed-metal clusters. The resulting dataset reveals symmetry and element-dependent trends in cluster formation. By integrating cluster classification with flat-band lattice topology and battery-relevant information, we provide further relevant information to multiple scientific communities.

Because of its role in supporting life, the uncertainty surrounding the catalytic cycle, and its compositional richness with eight transition metal ions, FeMo-co has fascinated scientists for decades. After much effort, the complete atomic structure was resolved. However, its electronic structure, central to reactivity, remains under intense debate.\n  FeMo-co's complexity, arising from many unpaired electrons, has led to suggestions that it lies beyond the reach of classical computing. Consequently, there has been much interest in the potential of quantum algorithms to compute its electronic structure. Estimating the cost to compute the ground-state to chemical accuracy (~1 kcal/mol) within one or more FeMo-co models is a common benchmark of quantum algorithms in quantum chemistry, with numerous resource estimates in the literature.\n  Here we address how to perform the same task using classical computation. We use a 76 orbital/152 qubit resting state model, the subject of most quantum resource estimates. Based on insight into the multiple configuration nature of the states, we devise classical protocols that yield rigorous or empirical upper bounds to the ground-state energy. Extrapolating these we predict the ground-state energy with an estimated uncertainty on the order of chemical accuracy. Having performed this long-discussed computational task, we next consider implications beyond the model. We distill a simpler computational procedure which we apply to reveal the electronic landscape in realistic representations of the cofactor. We thus illustrate a path to a precise computational understanding of FeMo-co electronic structure.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u4f7f\u7528\u7ecf\u5178\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u800c\u975e\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\uff09\u7cbe\u786e\u8ba1\u7b97FeMo-cofactor\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u5316\u5b66\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff08~1 kcal/mol\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u7b80\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u6d41\u7a0b\u7528\u4e8e\u66f4\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u8f85\u56e0\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "FeMo-cofactor\u662f\u56fa\u6c2e\u9176\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6d3b\u6027\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff0c\u5176\u7535\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u56fa\u6c2e\u673a\u7406\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5176\u539f\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u5df2\u89e3\u6790\uff0c\u4f46\u7535\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u56e0\u542b\u591a\u4e2a\u672a\u914d\u5bf9\u7535\u5b50\u800c\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8d85\u51fa\u7ecf\u5178\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\u88ab\u5bc4\u4e88\u539a\u671b\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u7ecf\u5178\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u5b8c\u6210\u8fd9\u4e00\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u752876\u8f68\u9053/152\u91cf\u5b50\u4f4d\u7684\u9759\u6b62\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u8d44\u6e90\u4f30\u8ba1\u7814\u7a76\u76f8\u540c\uff09\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u591a\u7ec4\u6001\u6001\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u7ecf\u5178\u8ba1\u7b97\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u83b7\u5f97\u4e25\u683c\u6216\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e0a\u754c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5916\u63a8\u9884\u6d4b\u57fa\u6001\u80fd\u91cf\u3002\u968f\u540e\u63d0\u70bc\u51fa\u7b80\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u66f4\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u8f85\u56e0\u5b50\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u4f7f\u7528\u7ecf\u5178\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u9884\u6d4b\u4e86FeMo-cofactor\u7684\u57fa\u6001\u80fd\u91cf\uff0c\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u5ea6\u8fbe\u5230\u5316\u5b66\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6c34\u5e73\uff08\u7ea61 kcal/mol\uff09\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6d41\u7a0b\u80fd\u591f\u63ed\u793a\u8f85\u56e0\u5b50\u5728\u66f4\u771f\u5b9e\u8868\u793a\u4e0b\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u7ecf\u5178\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u7cbe\u786e\u8ba1\u7b97FeMo-cofactor\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\u57fa\u51c6\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8981\u6c42\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u56fa\u6c2e\u9176\u6d3b\u6027\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u8ba1\u7b97\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\"\u5fc5\u987b\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u7b97\u6cd5\"\u7684\u666e\u904d\u5047\u8bbe\u3002"}}

To overcome the high computational cost of PF in solving complex PDEs, machine learning methods such as PINNs, convLSTM have been used to predict PF evolution. However, current methods still face shortages of low flexibility, poor generalization and short predicting time length. In this work, we present a joint framework coupling voxel-flow network (VFN) with PF simulations in an alternating manner for long-horizon temporal prediction of microstructure evolution. The VFN iteratively predicts future evolution by learning the flow of pixels from past snapshots, with periodic boundaries preserved in the process. Periodical PF simulations suppresses nonphysical artifacts, reduces accumulated error, and extends reliable prediction time length. The VFN is about 1,000 times faster than PF simulation on GPU. In validation using grain growth and spinodal decomposition, MSE and SSIM remain 6.76% and 0.911 when predicted 18 frames from only 2 input frames, outperforming similar predicting methods. For an ultra-long grain growth prediction for 82 frames from 2 input frames, grain number decreases from 600 to 29 with NMSE of average grain area remaining 1.64%.

Restricting our attention to extreme type-II multicomponent superconductors motivates focusing on the ultraclean limit. Using functional-integral techniques, we derive the Gaussian fluctuation action from which we obtain the gauge-invariant electromagnetic linear response kernel. This allows us to compute the optical conductivity tensor. We identify essential conditions required for a nonzero longitudinal conductivity at finite frequencies in a disorder-free and translationally invariant system. Specifically, this is neither related to impurity scattering nor electron-phonon interaction, but derives indirectly from the multicomponent character of the incipient superconducting order and the parent metallic state. Under these conditions, the enhancement of the DC conductivity due to fluctuations close to the critical point follows the same critical behaviour as in the diffusive limit.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5206\u91cf\u8d85\u5bfc\u4f53\u5728\u4e34\u754c\u70b9\u9644\u8fd1\u7684\u672c\u5f81\u6da8\u843d\u7535\u5bfc\u7387\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5728\u65e0\u6742\u8d28\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6709\u9650\u9891\u7387\u7eb5\u5411\u7535\u5bfc\u7387\u975e\u96f6\u7684\u6761\u4ef6", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5177\u6709\u591a\u7247\u8d39\u7c73\u9762\u7684\u91d1\u5c5e\u5728\u63a5\u8fd1\u8d85\u5bfc\u4e34\u754c\u70b9\u65f6\u7684\u672c\u5f81\u6da8\u843d\u7535\u5bfc\u7387\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u6781\u7aef\u7b2c\u4e8c\u7c7b\u591a\u5206\u91cf\u8d85\u5bfc\u4f53\u7684\u8d85\u51c0\u6781\u9650", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6cdb\u51fd\u79ef\u5206\u6280\u672f\u63a8\u5bfc\u9ad8\u65af\u6da8\u843d\u4f5c\u7528\u91cf\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u89c4\u8303\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u7535\u78c1\u7ebf\u6027\u54cd\u5e94\u6838\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5149\u5b66\u7535\u5bfc\u7387\u5f20\u91cf", "result": "\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u5728\u65e0\u6742\u8d28\u3001\u5e73\u79fb\u4e0d\u53d8\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6709\u9650\u9891\u7387\u7eb5\u5411\u7535\u5bfc\u7387\u975e\u96f6\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\uff1a\u8fd9\u4e0e\u6742\u8d28\u6563\u5c04\u6216\u7535\u5b50-\u58f0\u5b50\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u65e0\u5173\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u6e90\u4e8e\u591a\u5206\u91cf\u8d85\u5bfc\u5e8f\u53c2\u91cf\u548c\u6bcd\u4f53\u91d1\u5c5e\u6001\u7684\u7279\u6027", "conclusion": "\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e34\u754c\u70b9\u9644\u8fd1\u6da8\u843d\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u76f4\u6d41\u7535\u5bfc\u7387\u589e\u5f3a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0e\u6269\u6563\u6781\u9650\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u4e34\u754c\u884c\u4e3a"}}

Starting from the Lennard-Jones potential, we evaluate the second virial coefficient to infer the virial expansion of the equation of state and recover the van der Waals equation using only its leading correction. The corresponding partition function allows us to obtain all thermodynamic potentials for both monoatomic and diatomic fluids in a transparent and instructive manner.\n  Building on this framework, we formulate and solve analytically the Clausius-Clapeyron equation in the vicinity of the critical point, obtaining the liquid-vapor coexistence curve in closed form. This approach not only clarifies the microscopic origin of van der Waals thermodynamics but also complements-and in several aspects improves upon-traditional treatments that rely heavily on numerical methods or heuristic arguments.\n  In addition, because the van der Waals equation naturally predicts the liquid-vapor equilibrium, the existence of critical points, and the functional form of the saturation curve of the pressure as a function of temperature, it provides an analytically tractable framework for studying a 150-year-old problem that has historically been addressed using graphical constructions or numerical solutions. As such, the formulation developed here offers a coherent, accessible, and conceptually unified route for students and instructors to understand phase coexistence in simple fluids from first principles.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u4ece\u7edf\u8ba1\u529b\u5b66\u89d2\u5ea6\u63a8\u5bfc\u8303\u5fb7\u74e6\u5c14\u65af\u6d41\u4f53\u7684\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5b50\u95f4\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u548c\u7c92\u5b50\u6709\u9650\u5c3a\u5bf8\uff0c\u4eceLennard-Jones\u52bf\u51fa\u53d1\u5f97\u5230\u7b2c\u4e8c\u7ef4\u91cc\u7cfb\u6570\uff0c\u6062\u590d\u8303\u5fb7\u74e6\u5c14\u65af\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u89e3\u6790\u6c42\u89e3Clausius-Clapeyron\u65b9\u7a0b\u83b7\u5f97\u6db2-\u6c7d\u5171\u5b58\u66f2\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8303\u5fb7\u74e6\u5c14\u65af\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u5904\u7406\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u6570\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\u6216\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u8bba\u8bc1\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4ece\u5fae\u89c2\u539f\u7406\u51fa\u53d1\u7684\u6e05\u6670\u63a8\u5bfc\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ece\u7edf\u8ba1\u529b\u5b66\u7b2c\u4e00\u6027\u539f\u7406\u51fa\u53d1\u3001\u900f\u660e\u4e14\u6982\u5ff5\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u5b66\u751f\u548c\u6559\u5e08\u7406\u89e3\u7b80\u5355\u6d41\u4f53\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u5171\u5b58\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "method": "\u4eceLennard-Jones\u52bf\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u7b2c\u4e8c\u7ef4\u91cc\u7cfb\u6570\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u7ef4\u91cc\u5c55\u5f00\u72b6\u6001\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ec5\u7528\u5176\u4e3b\u5bfc\u4fee\u6b63\u6062\u590d\u8303\u5fb7\u74e6\u5c14\u65af\u65b9\u7a0b\u3002\u6784\u5efa\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u914d\u5206\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u6240\u6709\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u52bf\u3002\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u5728\u4e34\u754c\u70b9\u9644\u8fd1\u89e3\u6790\u6c42\u89e3Clausius-Clapeyron\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u6db2-\u6c7d\u5171\u5b58\u66f2\u7ebf\u7684\u95ed\u5408\u5f62\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u8303\u5fb7\u74e6\u5c14\u65af\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u6240\u6709\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u52bf\uff08\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5355\u539f\u5b50\u548c\u53cc\u539f\u5b50\u6d41\u4f53\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e34\u754c\u70b9\u9644\u8fd1\u83b7\u5f97\u6db2-\u6c7d\u5171\u5b58\u66f2\u7ebf\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u89e3\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9610\u660e\u4e86\u8303\u5fb7\u74e6\u5c14\u65af\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u5fae\u89c2\u8d77\u6e90\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u65b9\u9762\u6539\u8fdb\u4f20\u7edf\u4f9d\u8d56\u6570\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\u6216\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u8bba\u8bc1\u7684\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8fde\u8d2f\u3001\u6613\u7406\u89e3\u4e14\u6982\u5ff5\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ece\u7b2c\u4e00\u6027\u539f\u7406\u51fa\u53d1\u7406\u89e3\u7b80\u5355\u6d41\u4f53\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u5171\u5b58\u3002\u8be5\u6559\u5b66\u63a8\u5bfc\u6f84\u6e05\u4e86\u8303\u5fb7\u74e6\u5c14\u65af\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u5fae\u89c2\u8d77\u6e90\uff0c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u8fd9\u4e2a150\u5e74\u5386\u53f2\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5206\u6790\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u56fe\u5f62\u6784\u9020\u6216\u6570\u503c\u89e3\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Here, enabled by a new interferometric detector, we show that fast FCs inherently excite short-lived cantilever oscillations whose transient frequency and decay encode local stiffness and dissipation. By analyzing these dynamics on a single-curve, single-pixel basis, we extract time-local mechanical information without external broadband excitation or multi-pass imaging. We develop a state-dependent single-mode harmonic oscillator model that captures snap-in excitation, hydration-mediated dissipation, and contact stiffness during fast force mapping. Experimental analysis of high-bandwidth force-curve data and numerical simulations demonstrate that multiple dynamically distinct interaction regimes occur within a single FC. Accessing these transient dynamics enables high-throughput, high-resolution mapping of mechanical contrast and reveals heterogeneous and non-repeatable behaviors that are lost under conventional averaging or with conventional detection schemes with higher noise floors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u539f\u5b50\u529b\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u5feb\u901f\u529b\u8ddd\u79bb\u66f2\u7ebf\u4e2d\u7684\u77ac\u6001\u632f\u8361\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u5c40\u90e8\u521a\u5ea6\u548c\u8017\u6563\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u673a\u68b0\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u6620\u5c04", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u539f\u5b50\u529b\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u529b\u8ddd\u79bb\u66f2\u7ebf\u5206\u6790\u5e38\u901a\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6ce2\u548c\u51c6\u9759\u6001\u89e3\u91ca\u7b80\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5feb\u901f\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e2d\u6fc0\u53d1\u7684\u77ac\u6001\u632f\u8361\u6240\u5305\u542b\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u673a\u68b0\u7279\u6027\u4fe1\u606f", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u65b0\u578b\u5e72\u6d89\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u83b7\u53d6\u9ad8\u5e26\u5bbd\u529b\u66f2\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u72b6\u6001\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u5355\u6a21\u8c10\u632f\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5355\u66f2\u7ebf\u3001\u5355\u50cf\u7d20\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u7684\u77ac\u6001\u9891\u7387\u548c\u8870\u51cf\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u5feb\u901f\u529b\u6620\u5c04\u4e2d\u7684snap-in\u6fc0\u53d1\u3001\u6c34\u5408\u4ecb\u5bfc\u8017\u6563\u548c\u63a5\u89e6\u521a\u5ea6", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5355\u4e2a\u529b\u8ddd\u79bb\u66f2\u7ebf\u5185\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u52a8\u6001\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u901a\u91cf\u3001\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u673a\u68b0\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4f20\u7edf\u5e73\u5747\u65b9\u6cd5\u6216\u9ad8\u566a\u58f0\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6848\u4e2d\u4e22\u5931\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u975e\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u884c\u4e3a", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u5feb\u901f\u529b\u8ddd\u79bb\u66f2\u7ebf\u4e2d\u7684\u77ac\u6001\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u53d6\u65f6\u95f4\u5c40\u90e8\u673a\u68b0\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u5bbd\u5e26\u6fc0\u53d1\u6216\u591a\u901a\u9053\u6210\u50cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u673a\u68b0\u8868\u5f81\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84"}}

Using very-high-resolution inelastic neutron scattering on a single crystal of FeF$_2$, we show that the dominant source of magnon splitting is in fact the long-range dipolar interaction rather than altermagnetic exchange terms. At momenta where the dipolar splitting vanishes, we observe additional broadening due to altermagnetic chiral splitting and estimate this splitting to be $\\sim$35 $\u03bc$eV. Polarized measurements further reveal that, where dipolar splitting is present, the chiral magnon modes become mixed and the resulting modes are predominantly linearly polarized, with at most a small chiral component. These findings highlight the significant effect of dipolar interactions on magnon chirality, particularly when altermagnetic interactions are weak.", "AI": {"tldr": "FeF\u2082\u4e2d\u78c1\u632f\u5b50\u5206\u88c2\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u957f\u7a0b\u5076\u6781\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4ea4\u66ff\u78c1\u4ea4\u6362\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4ec5\u5728\u5076\u6781\u5206\u88c2\u6d88\u5931\u5904\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7ea635\u03bceV\u7684\u4ea4\u66ff\u78c1\u624b\u6027\u5206\u88c2\u3002", "motivation": "FeF\u2082\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5178\u578b\u7684\u91d1\u7ea2\u77f3\u53cd\u94c1\u78c1\u4f53\uff0c\u6700\u8fd1\u88ab\u63d0\u51fa\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4ea4\u66ff\u78c1\u4f53\uff0c\u5176\u78c1\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5141\u8bb8\u81ea\u65cb\u5206\u88c2\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u5e26\u548c\u624b\u6027\u78c1\u632f\u5b50\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u786e\u5b9a\u78c1\u632f\u5b50\u5206\u88c2\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u6765\u6e90\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u78c1\u632f\u5b50\u624b\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6781\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u975e\u5f39\u6027\u4e2d\u5b50\u6563\u5c04\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5bf9FeF\u2082\u5355\u6676\u6837\u54c1\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6781\u5316\u6d4b\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u78c1\u632f\u5b50\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u4e3b\u8981\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a1) \u78c1\u632f\u5b50\u5206\u88c2\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u957f\u7a0b\u5076\u6781\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff1b2) \u5728\u5076\u6781\u5206\u88c2\u6d88\u5931\u7684\u52a8\u91cf\u5904\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7ea635\u03bceV\u7684\u4ea4\u66ff\u78c1\u624b\u6027\u5206\u88c2\uff1b3) \u5b58\u5728\u5076\u6781\u5206\u88c2\u65f6\uff0c\u624b\u6027\u78c1\u632f\u5b50\u6a21\u5f0f\u6df7\u5408\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u5448\u73b0\u7ebf\u6027\u6781\u5316\uff0c\u624b\u6027\u6210\u5206\u5f88\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u957f\u7a0b\u5076\u6781\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5bf9\u78c1\u632f\u5b50\u624b\u6027\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4ea4\u66ff\u78c1\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u8f83\u5f31\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u8fd9\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u4ea4\u66ff\u78c1\u4ea4\u6362\u662fFeF\u2082\u4e2d\u78c1\u632f\u5b50\u5206\u88c2\u4e3b\u8981\u6765\u6e90\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\u3002"}}

This is because of the ease that the tests afford in both the preparation of the specimen (a beam of rectangular cross section) and the application of the loads (simple supports pressing on the specimen). Yet, this practical advantage has to be tempered by the fact that the observations from both of these tests -- being \\emph{indirect} experiments in the sense that they involve \\emph{not} uniform uniaxial tension but non-uniform triaxial stress states throughout the specimen -- have to be appropriately interpreted to be useful. By making use of the phase-field fracture theory initiated by Kumar, Francfort, and Lopez-Pamies (2018), which has been recently established as a complete theory of fracture capable of accurately describing the nucleation and propagation of cracks in elastic brittle materials under arbitrary quasistatic loading conditions, the main objective of this paper is to carry out a thorough 3D quantitative analysis of when and where fracture nucleates and propagates in four-point and three-point bending tests and thereby establish how to appropriately interpret their results. As a corollary, the analysis provides an explanation for why four-point bending tests typically yield smaller flexural strengths than three-point bending tests, a source of constant headaches for practitioners who have been left to wonder which test -- if any -- would be more appropriate for their purposes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u7528\u76f8\u573a\u65ad\u88c2\u7406\u8bba\u5bf9\u56db\u70b9\u5f2f\u66f2\u548c\u4e09\u70b9\u5f2f\u66f2\u8bd5\u9a8c\u8fdb\u884c3D\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u65ad\u88c2\u8d77\u59cb\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u4f55\u56db\u70b9\u5f2f\u66f2\u8bd5\u9a8c\u901a\u5e38\u5f97\u5230\u66f4\u5c0f\u7684\u5f2f\u66f2\u5f3a\u5ea6", "motivation": "\u56db\u70b9\u5f2f\u66f2\u548c\u4e09\u70b9\u5f2f\u66f2\u8bd5\u9a8c\u81ea1930\u5e74\u4ee3\u548c1950\u5e74\u4ee3\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u4ee5\u6765\uff0c\u5df2\u6210\u4e3a\u95f4\u63a5\u6d4b\u91cf\u6df7\u51dd\u571f\u3001\u9676\u74f7\u7b49\u6750\u6599\u6297\u62c9\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u5e38\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8bd5\u9a8c\u6d89\u53ca\u975e\u5747\u5300\u4e09\u5411\u5e94\u529b\u72b6\u6001\u800c\u975e\u5747\u5300\u5355\u5411\u62c9\u4f38\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9002\u5f53\u89e3\u91ca\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u56db\u70b9\u5f2f\u66f2\u8bd5\u9a8c\u901a\u5e38\u6bd4\u4e09\u70b9\u5f2f\u66f2\u8bd5\u9a8c\u5f97\u5230\u66f4\u5c0f\u7684\u5f2f\u66f2\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u7ed9\u5b9e\u8df5\u8005\u5e26\u6765\u56f0\u60d1\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528Kumar\u3001Francfort\u548cLopez-Pamies\uff082018\uff09\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u76f8\u573a\u65ad\u88c2\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u8be5\u7406\u8bba\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u63cf\u8ff0\u5f39\u6027\u8106\u6027\u6750\u6599\u5728\u4efb\u610f\u51c6\u9759\u6001\u52a0\u8f7d\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u88c2\u7eb9\u6210\u6838\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u3002\u5bf9\u56db\u70b9\u5f2f\u66f2\u548c\u4e09\u70b9\u5f2f\u66f2\u8bd5\u9a8c\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u9762\u76843D\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u56db\u70b9\u5f2f\u66f2\u548c\u4e09\u70b9\u5f2f\u66f2\u8bd5\u9a8c\u4e2d\u88c2\u7eb9\u4f55\u65f6\u3001\u4f55\u5904\u6210\u6838\u548c\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u4e3a\u5982\u4f55\u9002\u5f53\u89e3\u91ca\u8bd5\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4f9d\u636e\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u4e3a\u4f55\u56db\u70b9\u5f2f\u66f2\u8bd5\u9a8c\u901a\u5e38\u6bd4\u4e09\u70b9\u5f2f\u66f2\u8bd5\u9a8c\u5f97\u5230\u66f4\u5c0f\u7684\u5f2f\u66f2\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u76f8\u573a\u65ad\u88c2\u7406\u8bba\u76843D\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4e3a\u56db\u70b9\u5f2f\u66f2\u548c\u4e09\u70b9\u5f2f\u66f2\u8bd5\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5b9e\u8df5\u8005\u957f\u671f\u56f0\u60d1\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u54ea\u79cd\u8bd5\u9a8c\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u7279\u5b9a\u76ee\u7684\u3002"}}

The FPL family improves circuit performance by employing various Josephson junction (JJ) structures, including high-$J_c$ self-shunted 0-JJ stacks, $\u03c0$-JJs, and 0/$\u03c0$-JJ stacks. FPL utilizes 0- and $\u03c0$-JJs to replace the bulky geometric inductors required in single flux quantum (SFQ) logic families like RSFQ. The proposed FPL family can deliver up to two orders of magnitude improvement in integration density over RSFQ logic with a five-fold reduction in the bias current requirements. Circuit performance is enhanced with reduced latency and increased throughput. Furthermore, the FPL family provides a higher output voltage level and higher impedance, which better match those of CMOS circuits. The much smaller flux storage loops in FPL greatly reduce susceptibility to trapped flux and crosstalk. Advancements in fabrication processes that would further benefit FPL implementation include the use of NbTiN-based JJs with higher critical current density and fabrication temperature range up to 400~$^\\circ$C, or the use of stacked JJ structures.

Despite efforts to quantify APT's spatial resolution, misunderstanding remain regarding its true spatial performance. If the depth resolution was once reported to be 20 pm, quoting this value outside of its specific context is misleading and should be avoided. The resolution achievable in pure metals, at one specific location within one reconstructed dataset, does not generally apply across materials or analysis conditions, or even throughout a single tomographic reconstruction. Here, we review various efforts at defining and measuring the spatial resolution in the study of single phase and single element materials - i.e. pure metals - in field-ion microscopy (FIM) and APT. We also report on the degradation of the resolution arising from ion optical devices used to improve the mass-resolution. We aim to offer some perspective as to how reported resolutions may be or may not be of any relevance to most of the materials characterisation efforts by APT, including cases of precipitates in a matrix that emphasise the need to consider an effective resolution.

While it has been hypothesized that thermodynamic computers may achieve better energy efficiency and performance, a theoretical characterization of the resource cost of thermodynamic computations is still lacking. Here, we analyze the fundamental trade-offs between computational accuracy, energy dissipation, and time in thermodynamic computing. Using geometric bounds on entropy production, we derive general limits on the energy-delay-deficiency product (EDDP), a stochastic generalization of the traditional energy-delay product (EDP). While these limits can in principle be saturated, the corresponding optimal driving protocols require full knowledge of the final equilibrium distribution, i.e., the solution itself. To overcome this limitation, we develop quasi-optimal control schemes that require no prior information of the solution and demonstrate their performance for matrix inversion in overdamped quadratic systems. The derived bounds extend beyond this setting to more general potentials, being directly relevant to recent proposals based on non-equilibrium Langevin dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u80fd\u91cf\u8017\u6563\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u80fd\u91cf-\u5ef6\u8fdf-\u7f3a\u9677\u4e58\u79ef\uff08EDDP\uff09\u7684\u4e00\u822c\u6781\u9650\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u5148\u9a8c\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u51c6\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u8ba1\u7b97\u786c\u4ef6\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u91c7\u6837\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u80fd\u6548\u548c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5176\u8d44\u6e90\u6210\u672c\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u8868\u5f81\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5206\u6790\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u80fd\u91cf\u8017\u6563\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u71b5\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u754c\u9650\u63a8\u5bfc\u80fd\u91cf-\u5ef6\u8fdf-\u7f3a\u9677\u4e58\u79ef\uff08EDDP\uff09\u7684\u4e00\u822c\u6781\u9650\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u51c6\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6848\u65e0\u9700\u6700\u7ec8\u5e73\u8861\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u5728\u8fc7\u963b\u5c3c\u4e8c\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6f14\u793a\u77e9\u9635\u6c42\u9006\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2dEDDP\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u6781\u9650\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6781\u9650\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fbe\u5230\u9971\u548c\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u5b8c\u5168\u4e86\u89e3\u6700\u7ec8\u5e73\u8861\u5206\u5e03\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u51c6\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6848\u65e0\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5728\u8fc7\u963b\u5c3c\u4e8c\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u77e9\u9635\u6c42\u9006\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u6210\u672c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u80fd\u91cf\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u6743\u8861\u3002\u867d\u7136\u6700\u4f18\u9a71\u52a8\u9700\u8981\u5b8c\u6574\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f46\u51c6\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u66f4\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u4e14\u7ed3\u679c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u6717\u4e4b\u4e07\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

Here, we report magnon transport and its emergent anisotropic nature in BiFeO$_3$ layers confined between ultrathin layers of the antiferromagnet LaFeO$_3$. Due to the confined state, BiFeO$_3$ serves as an efficient magnon transmission channel as well as a magnetoelectric knob by which to control the stack by means of an electric field. We discuss the mechanism of the anisotropic spin transport based on the interaction between the antiferromagnetic order and the electric field.

Furthermore, lower crystal symmetric and suppression of the spin cycloid in ultrathin BiFeO$_3$ stabilizes a non-trivial antiferromagnetic state exhibiting symmetry-protected spin-split bands that provide the non-trivial sign inversion of the spin current, which is a characteristic of an altermagnet.

Although it is well-established that a pair of spinons can emerge from a magnon via deconfinement, controlled manipulation of individual spinons and direct observation of their deconfinement remain elusive. We propose an artificial gauge field scenario that enables the engineering of specific excited states in quantum spin models. This generates spatially localized individual spinons with high controllability. By applying time-dependent gauge fields, we realize adiabatic braiding of these spinons, as well as their dynamical evolution in a controllable manner. These results not only provide the first direct visualization of individual spinons localized in the bulk, but also point to new possibilities to simulate their confinement process.

Rev. X 15, 021019 (2025)] we found indirect evidence that the SC3 superconducting phase spills out beyond the first-order phase boundary of the spin-polarized state. This prior study was limited to a maximal field strength of 41.5 T, and mapped the $b-ac$ rotation plane. Here we measure a high quality sample with residual resistivity ratio RRR = 605 under rotations in the $b-c$ plane up to 45 T. This extended field range helps to unambiguously demonstrate the spillover of SC3 outside the polarized paramagnetic state.

Within a minimal TI--SC model, we demonstrate that proximity-induced superconductivity at the buried interface generates a two-dimensional topological superconducting phase supporting Majorana edge modes. Using a Bogoliubov-de Gennes slab model and the Kubo formalism, we compute the optical conductance and introduce a thickness-extrapolation protocol that isolates the interface contribution only. The resulting interface conductance exhibits a robust, thickness-independent coherence peak at an energy set by the proximity-induced gap, distinguishable from both the parent superconductor's pair-breaking feature and the ungapped Dirac cone on the top surface. We further demonstrate that the low-frequency spectral weight of this interface resonance obeys a quantum-metric sum rule, quantitatively linking the optical response to the quantum geometry of the proximitized interfacial state.

This method overcomes conventional limitations by treating bath correlations and impurity interactions on an equal footing. Applying our approach to the finite-temperature quantum critical regime of quantum spin systems, we uncover striking impurity-induced phenomena. In a coupled Heisenberg ladder, the impurity triggers a fractionalization of the local magnetic moment. Moreover, the derivative of the impurity susceptibility develops cusps that mark the crossover into the quantum critical regime.

A 6,500% magnetoresistance at 7 T accompanies Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations visible even at 15 K. These imply single-band conduction of holes with small effective mass in the in-plane directions, invoking a 2D hole gas (2DHG) picture that allotropic cross-D heterointerface between 2D GeH and 3D Ge harbors 2D-confined high-mobility holes. Even without elaborate heteroepitaxy and modulation doping, allotropic cross-D heterostructures pave the way toward facile 2DHG creation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5fb7\u56fd\u70f7\uff08GeH\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u77f3\u58a8\u70ef\u7684\u6c22\u7ec8\u6b62\u9517\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7269\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u76f4\u63a5\u5e26\u9699\uff08~1.6 eV\uff09\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u5355\u79cd\u540c\u7d20\u5f02\u5f62\u8de8\u7ef4\u5f02\u8d28\u754c\u9762\u4e2d\uff0c15 K\u65f6\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u521b\u7eaa\u5f55\u7684\u7a7a\u7a74\u8fc1\u79fb\u7387\u03bc_h~67,000 cm\u00b2/Vs\uff0c\u8fd9\u901a\u8fc7\u62d3\u6251\u8f6c\u6362\u76842D GeH\u5c42\u4e0e3D\u4f53Ge(111)\u63a5\u89e6\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u65e0\u9700\u590d\u6742\u5f02\u8d28\u5916\u5ef6\u548c\u8c03\u5236\u63ba\u6742\u5c31\u80fd\u521b\u5efa\u9ad8\u8fc1\u79fb\u7387\u4e8c\u7ef4\u7a7a\u7a74\u6c14\uff082DHG\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u7cbe\u5bc6\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u5916\u5ef6\u548c\u63ba\u6742\u5de5\u827a\uff0c\u800c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u540c\u7d20\u5f02\u5f62\u8de8\u7ef4\u5f02\u8d28\u7ed3\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u7b80\u4fbf\u76842DHG\u521b\u5efa\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u62d3\u6251\u8f6c\u6362\u5236\u59072D GeH\u5c42\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u4e0e3D\u4f53Ge(111)\u5f62\u6210\u540c\u7d20\u5f02\u5f62\u8de8\u7ef4\u5f02\u8d28\u754c\u9762\u3002\u5229\u7528\u6e29\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u7387\u6d4b\u91cf\u3001\u970d\u5c14\u6d4b\u91cf\u3001\u78c1\u963b\u6d4b\u91cf\u548cShubnikov-de Haas\u632f\u8361\u5206\u6790\u6765\u8868\u5f81\u754c\u9762\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "result": "\u572815 K\u65f6\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u521b\u7eaa\u5f55\u7684\u7a7a\u7a74\u8fc1\u79fb\u7387\u03bc_h~67,000 cm\u00b2/Vs\uff1b\u6e29\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u8868\u660e20-250 K\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u5b58\u5728\u65e0\u7535\u79bb\u6742\u8d28\u6563\u5c04\u7684\u91d1\u5c5e\u4f20\u5bfc\uff1b\u7247\u72b6\u7a7a\u7a74\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4e0e\u970d\u5c14\u6d4b\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\u4e00\u81f4\uff1b\u57287 T\u78c1\u573a\u4e0b\u89c2\u5bdf\u52306,500%\u7684\u78c1\u963b\u548c15 K\u65f6\u4ecd\u53ef\u89c1\u7684Shubnikov-de Haas\u632f\u8361\u3002", "conclusion": "\u540c\u7d20\u5f02\u5f62\u8de8\u7ef4\u5f02\u8d28\u754c\u9762\uff082D GeH\u4e0e3D Ge\u4e4b\u95f4\uff09\u80fd\u591f\u5bb9\u7eb3\u4e8c\u7ef4\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u9ad8\u8fc1\u79fb\u7387\u7a7a\u7a74\uff0c\u5f62\u62102DHG\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u9700\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u5916\u5ef6\u548c\u8c03\u5236\u63ba\u6742\uff0c\u4e3a\u7b80\u4fbf\u521b\u5efa2DHG\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

We present an accessible formalism that significantly extends our previous work, providing a theoretical basis for the energy-dependent gap function $\u0394(E)$. The latter is proportional to the effective spin exchange energy, $J_{eff}$, with no retardation effects, such as the case of spin-fluctuation or phonon mediated couplings. The fundamental parameters of the superconducting (SC) state are the condensation energy per pair, $\u03b2_c$, and the antinodal energy gap, $\u0394_p$, which are quantitatively extracted by fitting the cuprate quasiparticle spectrum from tunneling experiments.\n  An explicit formula for the critical temperature is also derived in the model. Valid for any doping, we find $T_c$ to be proportional to $\u03b2_c$, and not the gap $\u0394_p$, in sharp contrast to conventional SC. The numerical factor $\u03b2_c/k_BT_c\\simeq 2.24$ originates from pair excitations of the condensate, following Bose statistics, with a mini-gap $\u03b4_M \\simeq 1\\,$meV in the excitation spectrum.

We focus on the short-time tail, $T \\to 0$, of the extinction- or blowup-time distribution $\\mathcal{P}_m(T)$, where $m$ is the number of particles at $t=0$. This tail often exhibits an essential singularity at $T=0$, and we show that the singularity is captured by a time-dependent WKB (Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin) approximation applied directly to the master equation. This approximation, however, leaves undetermined a large pre-exponential factor. Here we show how to calculate this factor by applying a leading- and a subleading-order WKB approximation to the Laplace-transformed backward master equation. Accurate asymptotic results can be obtained when this WKB solution can be matched to another approximate solution (the ``inner\" solution), valid for not too large $m$.

To date, however, experimental reports on spin selectivity are not conclusive. The magnetoresistance in electron transport measurements observed for chiral materials on ferromagnets upon magnetisation reversal is proposed to result from electrostatic rather than from the sought-after chiral effects. Recent break junction studies even question the spin-dependent electron flow across single chiral molecules. Here, we avoid ferromagnetic electrodes and magnetisation reversal to provide unambiguous experimental evidence for the chirality-induced spin selectivity effect of single enantiomers. Functionalising the superconducting tip of a scanning tunnelling microscope with a manganese atom cluster gives rise to Yu-Shiba-Rusinov resonances that serve as spin-sensitive probes of the tunnelling current in junctions of single heptahelicene molecules adsorbed on a crystalline lead surface. Our key finding is the dependence of the signal strength of these states in spectroscopy of the differential conductance on the handedness of the molecule. The experiments unveil the role of the enantiomers as spin polarisers and the irrelevance of electrostatics in the chosen model system.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u626b\u63cf\u96a7\u9053\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u7ed3\u5408\u9530\u539f\u5b50\u7c07\u63a2\u9488\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u65e0\u94c1\u78c1\u7535\u6781\u548c\u78c1\u5316\u53cd\u8f6c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5355\u5206\u5b50\u624b\u6027\u8bf1\u5bfc\u81ea\u65cb\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6548\u5e94\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u660e\u786e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u624b\u6027\u6750\u6599\u5728\u504f\u7f6e\u7535\u5b50\u4f20\u8f93\u4e2d\u4f5c\u4e3a\u81ea\u65cb\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5668\u4ef6\u5177\u6709\u91cf\u5b50\u6280\u672f\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u636e\u5b58\u5728\u4e89\u8bae\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u78c1\u963b\u6548\u5e94\u53ef\u80fd\u6e90\u4e8e\u9759\u7535\u6548\u5e94\u800c\u975e\u624b\u6027\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u786e\u51ff\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u626b\u63cf\u96a7\u9053\u663e\u5fae\u955c\uff0c\u5728\u8d85\u5bfc\u9488\u5c16\u4e0a\u529f\u80fd\u5316\u9530\u539f\u5b50\u7c07\uff0c\u5229\u7528Yu-Shiba-Rusinov\u5171\u632f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u81ea\u65cb\u654f\u611f\u63a2\u9488\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5438\u9644\u5728\u94c5\u6676\u4f53\u8868\u9762\u7684\u5355\u5206\u5b50\u4e03\u87ba\u65cb\u70ef\u7684\u624b\u6027\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u5173\u952e\u53d1\u73b0\u662f\u5fae\u5206\u7535\u5bfc\u8c31\u4e2dYu-Shiba-Rusinov\u5171\u632f\u4fe1\u53f7\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5206\u5b50\u7684\u624b\u6027\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5bf9\u6620\u5f02\u6784\u4f53\u786e\u5b9e\u8d77\u5230\u81ea\u65cb\u504f\u632f\u5668\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4e14\u9759\u7535\u6548\u5e94\u5728\u6240\u9009\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4e0d\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u624b\u6027\u8bf1\u5bfc\u81ea\u65cb\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6548\u5e94\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u660e\u786e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u624b\u6027\u5206\u5b50\u4f5c\u4e3a\u81ea\u65cb\u504f\u632f\u5668\u7684\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u6392\u9664\u4e86\u9759\u7535\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u6280\u672f\u5e94\u7528\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Theoretical and experimental investigations are actively progressing to provide the capability of efficient switching and precise control of the N\u00e9el vector, which is crucial for the intended practical applications of antiferromagnets. Recently, a time-dependent Schwinger boson mean-field theory has been successfully developed to study the sublattice magnetization switching in anisotropic quantum antiferromagnets [K. Bolsmann $et \\, al.$, \\textcolor{blue}{\\hyperlink{10.1103/PRXQuantum.4.030332}{PRX Quantum $\\mathbf{4}$, 030332 (2023)}}]. Here we use a complementary exact diagonalization method to study such sublattice magnetization switching, but in small-cluster quantum antiferromagnets, by means of an external magnetic field. Furthermore, this article aims to support the findings of the Schwinger boson approach. We show that the results of both approaches are consistent at short time scales, with only about 12.5 $\\%$ deviations. The consistency of the outcomes obtained through this alternative exact approach demonstrates that the time-dependent Schwinger boson mean-field theory is a versatile framework to capture the essentials of the switching process in quantum antiferromagnets.

The energy gap of ferroelectric compounds and its adjustment by compositional variation has particularly attracted attention in recent years due to potential application in energy conversion and/or catalytic devices. It is demonstrated that it is necessary to distinguish between the fundamental gap, $E_{\\rm g}^{0}$, the optical gap, $E_{\\rm g}^{\\rm opt}$, and the transport gap, $E_{\\rm g}^{\\rm tr}$, of ferroelectrics, which can differ significantly. The situation is comparable to those in organic semiconductors and emerges from the presence of localized charges. The fundamental gap is a ground state property, i.e.\\ the energy difference between the maximum of the fully occupied valence band and the minimum of the completely empty conduction band. In contrast, the optical and transport gaps are excited state properties involving localized (polaronic) electrons and/or holes at energies considerably different from the band edges. This work illustrates how the different energy gaps of ferroelectrics can be determined by combining optical measurements, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and temperature and oxygen partial pressure dependent electrical conductivity measurements.

The variations of conductance spectra among different contacts are proposed to be caused by the anisotropy of Fermi surface topology associated with different gaps.", "AI": {"tldr": "PdTe\u5355\u6676\u7684\u70b9\u63a5\u89e6\u8c31\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u5176\u8d85\u5bfc\u884c\u4e3a\u504f\u79bb\u5355\u80fd\u9699\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u7528\u53cc\u80fd\u9699\u6a21\u578b\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8d85\u5bfc\u80fd\u9699\u3002", "motivation": "PdTe\u88ab\u62a5\u9053\u4e3aII\u578b\u72c4\u62c9\u514b\u534a\u91d1\u5c5e\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u4f53\u8282\u70b9\u548c\u65e0\u8282\u70b9\u8868\u9762\u8d85\u5bfc\u6027\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76PdTe\u5355\u6676\u7684\u8d85\u5bfc\u80fd\u9699\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u662f\u5426\u5177\u6709\u591a\u80fd\u9699\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u70b9\u63a5\u89e6\u8c31\uff08PCS\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76PdTe\u5355\u6676\u7684\u8d85\u5bfc\u80fd\u9699\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u53cc\u80fd\u9699Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk\u6a21\u578b\u62df\u5408\u5fae\u5206\u7535\u5bfc\u66f2\u7ebf\u3002", "result": "\u5fae\u5206\u7535\u5bfc\u66f2\u7ebf\u663e\u793a\u504f\u79bb\u5355\u80fd\u9699\u8d85\u5bfc\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u53cc\u80fd\u9699\u6a21\u578b\u62df\u5408\u66f4\u597d\uff1a\u5927\u80fd\u9699\u0394_L\uff082\u0394_L=3.7k_BT_c\uff09\u548c\u5c0f\u80fd\u9699\u0394_S\uff082\u0394_S=1.1-2.2k_BT_c\uff09\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u5f31\u5e26\u95f4\u6563\u5c04\u3002\u4e0d\u540c\u63a5\u89e6\u70b9\u7684\u7535\u5bfc\u8c31\u53d8\u5316\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u4e0e\u4e0d\u540c\u80fd\u9699\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u8d39\u7c73\u9762\u62d3\u6251\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "PdTe\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u591a\u80fd\u9699\u8d85\u5bfc\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u62d3\u6251\u8d85\u5bfc\u4f53\u7684\u5019\u9009\u6750\u6599\uff0c\u8d39\u7c73\u9762\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u540c\u63a5\u89e6\u70b9\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8d85\u5bfc\u884c\u4e3a\u3002"}}

Any comments or suggestions are greatly appreciated", "summary": "In gyrotropic crystals, an oscillating magnetic field induces a charge response known as the gyrotropic magnetic current. While its conventional origin is attributed to magnetic field modified band energy and shift in the Fermi-surface, a recent study identified an additional spin-driven magnetic displacement contribution. Here, we complete the picture by identifying the orbital counterpart of the magnetic displacement current. Using a density-matrix formulation that incorporates both minimal coupling and spin-Zeeman interactions, we derive the electronic equations of motion in the presence of an oscillating magnetic field and uncover a previously unexplored orbital contribution to the wavepacket velocity. Physically, this contribution arises from the time variation of the magnetic-field induced charge polarization. In the low frequency transport regime, this mechanism becomes purely intrinsic. We illustrate this intrinsic gyrotropic current of orbital origin in the ${\\cal P}{\\cal T}$-symmetric antiferromagnet CuMnAs. We show that the intrinsic gyrotropic magnetic current reverses sign upon N\u00e9el vector reversal, establishing it as a direct probe of antiferromagnetic order in CuMnAs and other $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric antiferromagnets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5728\u65cb\u5149\u6676\u4f53\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u8f68\u9053\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u78c1\u4f4d\u79fb\u7535\u6d41\uff0c\u5b8c\u5584\u4e86\u65cb\u5149\u78c1\u7535\u6d41\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728PT\u5bf9\u79f0\u53cd\u94c1\u78c1\u4f53\u4e2d\u7684\u672c\u5f81\u7279\u6027\u53ca\u5bf9\u53cd\u94c1\u78c1\u5e8f\u7684\u63a2\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u65cb\u5149\u6676\u4f53\u4e2d\u632f\u8361\u78c1\u573a\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u7535\u8377\u54cd\u5e94\uff08\u65cb\u5149\u78c1\u7535\u6d41\uff09\u4f20\u7edf\u4e0a\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u78c1\u573a\u4fee\u6b63\u7684\u80fd\u5e26\u80fd\u91cf\u548c\u8d39\u7c73\u9762\u79fb\u52a8\uff0c\u6700\u8fd1\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u81ea\u65cb\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u78c1\u4f4d\u79fb\u8d21\u732e\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5b8c\u5584\u8fd9\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u8f68\u9053\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u78c1\u4f4d\u79fb\u7535\u6d41\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5305\u542b\u6700\u5c0f\u8026\u5408\u548c\u81ea\u65cb\u585e\u66fc\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u5bc6\u5ea6\u77e9\u9635\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u5728\u632f\u8361\u78c1\u573a\u5b58\u5728\u4e0b\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u8fd0\u52a8\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u6ce2\u5305\u901f\u5ea6\u4e2d\u5148\u524d\u672a\u88ab\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u8f68\u9053\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u8f68\u9053\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u78c1\u4f4d\u79fb\u7535\u6d41\uff0c\u8be5\u8d21\u732e\u6e90\u4e8e\u78c1\u573a\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7535\u8377\u6781\u5316\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u5728\u4f4e\u9891\u8f93\u8fd0\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u6210\u4e3a\u7eaf\u7cb9\u7684\u672c\u5f81\u6548\u5e94\u3002\u5728PT\u5bf9\u79f0\u53cd\u94c1\u78c1\u4f53CuMnAs\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8fd9\u79cd\u8f68\u9053\u8d77\u6e90\u7684\u672c\u5f81\u65cb\u5149\u78c1\u7535\u6d41\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u968f\u5c3c\u5c14\u77e2\u91cf\u53cd\u8f6c\u800c\u6539\u53d8\u7b26\u53f7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u5b8c\u5584\u4e86\u65cb\u5149\u78c1\u7535\u6d41\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8f68\u9053\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u78c1\u4f4d\u79fb\u7535\u6d41\u4f5c\u4e3aPT\u5bf9\u79f0\u53cd\u94c1\u78c1\u4f53\u4e2d\u53cd\u94c1\u78c1\u5e8f\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u63a2\u6d4b\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u65cb\u5149\u6676\u4f53\u4e2d\u7684\u78c1\u7535\u54cd\u5e94\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

Using C-AFM, we directly visualize and electrically control this intercalation process within sub-100-nm volumes, revealing reversible, localized conductance modulation driven by K-ion intercalation and Fe2+/Fe3+ redox reconfiguration. This nanoscale operability highlights the exceptional potential of PBAs for high-scalable and low-dimension memristor-based devices integration. Due to their modular composition, PBAs constitute a chemically rich, earth-abundant materials platform whose electronic and ionic properties can be precisely tuned for specific device functions. K-ion intercalation PBA-based memristor devices, with their singlestep, aqueous, and room-temperature fabrication, enable low-cost, large-scale processing compatible with CMOS, without any additional post-fabrication processing. Our findings establish PBAs as a new class of intercalation memristors with scalable nanoscale switching and exceptional materials versatility, toward highly integrated neuromorphic and non-volatile memory technologies. This work provides the first demonstration of intercalation-driven resistive switching under ultrafast voltage sweeps, with PW operating up to 200 V/s and PB up to 50 V/s. This unprecedented speed establishes PBAs as a distinct, high-rate class of K-ion intercalation memristors suitable for fast, high-density neuromorphic and memory applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u666e\u9c81\u58eb\u84dd\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7269\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u94be\u79bb\u5b50\u63d2\u5c42\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u963b\u53d8\u5f00\u5173\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7C-AFM\u5728\u7eb3\u7c73\u5c3a\u5ea6\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u5e76\u63a7\u5236\u8be5\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u9ad8\u901f\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u63d2\u5c42\u5fc6\u963b\u5668", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u666e\u9c81\u58eb\u84dd\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7269\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65b0\u578b\u5fc6\u963b\u5668\u6750\u6599\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5176\u94be\u79bb\u5b50\u63d2\u5c42\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u7eb3\u7c73\u5c3a\u5ea6\u963b\u53d8\u5f00\u5173\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u5fc6\u963b\u5668\u5728\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u6750\u6599\u591a\u6837\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u9650\u5236", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5bfc\u7535\u539f\u5b50\u529b\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u5728\u4e9a100\u7eb3\u7c73\u5c3a\u5ea6\u76f4\u63a5\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u548c\u7535\u63a7\u5236\u94be\u79bb\u5b50\u63d2\u5c42\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Fe2+/Fe3+\u6c27\u5316\u8fd8\u539f\u91cd\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9006\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u7535\u5bfc\u8c03\u5236", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0PW\u6750\u6599200 V/s\u548cPB\u6750\u659950 V/s\u7684\u8d85\u5feb\u7535\u538b\u626b\u63cf\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u53ef\u9006\u7684\u7eb3\u7c73\u5c3a\u5ea6\u963b\u53d8\u5f00\u5173\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u666e\u9c81\u58eb\u84dd\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7269\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u901f\u63d2\u5c42\u5fc6\u963b\u5668\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027", "conclusion": "\u666e\u9c81\u58eb\u84dd\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7269\u6784\u6210\u4e86\u4e00\u7c7b\u65b0\u578b\u63d2\u5c42\u5fc6\u963b\u5668\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u7eb3\u7c73\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5f00\u5173\u7279\u6027\u3001\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u6750\u6599\u591a\u529f\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u96c6\u6210\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u5f62\u6001\u548c\u975e\u6613\u5931\u6027\u5b58\u50a8\u6280\u672f"}}

We propose a material system that can efficiently block radiation up to the optical range while transmitting photons at low gigahertz frequencies. It is based on the effect that incident photons are strongly scattered when their wavelength is comparable to the size of particles embedded in a weakly absorbing medium (Mie-scattering). The goal of this work is to tailor the absorption and transmission spectrum of an non-magnetic epoxy resin containing sapphire spheres by simulating its dependence on the size distribution. Additionally, we fabricate several material compositions, characterize them, as well as other materials, at optical, infrared, and gigahertz frequencies. In the infrared region (stop band) the attenuation of the Mie-scattering optimized material is high and comparable to that of other commonly used filter materials. At gigahertz frequencies (pass-band), the prototype filter exhibits a high transmission at millikelvin temperatures, with an insertion loss of less than $0.4\\,$dB below $10\\,$GHz.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u7528Mie\u6563\u5c04\u539f\u7406\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u7ea2\u5916\u6ce2\u6bb5\u9ad8\u6548\u963b\u6321\u8f90\u5c04\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728GHz\u9891\u6bb5\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u900f\u5c04\u7387\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4f4e\u6e29\u91cf\u5b50\u5e94\u7528", "motivation": "\u4f4e\u6e29\u91cf\u5b50\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u9700\u8981\u4fdd\u62a4\u514d\u53d7\u9ad8\u6e29\u9636\u6bb5\u6216\u5176\u4ed6\u6765\u6e90\u7684\u7ea2\u5916\u8f90\u5c04\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u963b\u6321\u7ea2\u5916\u8f90\u5c04\u540c\u65f6\u5141\u8bb8GHz\u4fe1\u53f7\u901a\u8fc7\u7684\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eMie\u6563\u5c04\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u5728\u975e\u78c1\u6027\u73af\u6c27\u6811\u8102\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165\u84dd\u5b9d\u77f3\u7403\u4f53\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u4f18\u5316\u7c92\u5f84\u5206\u5e03\u6765\u8c03\u63a7\u5438\u6536\u548c\u900f\u5c04\u5149\u8c31\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u9645\u5236\u5907\u591a\u79cd\u6750\u6599\u7ec4\u5408\u8fdb\u884c\u5149\u5b66\u3001\u7ea2\u5916\u548cGHz\u9891\u7387\u7684\u8868\u5f81", "result": "\u5728\u7ea2\u5916\u963b\u5e26\u533a\u57df\uff0cMie\u6563\u5c04\u4f18\u5316\u6750\u6599\u7684\u8870\u51cf\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u5e38\u7528\u6ee4\u6ce2\u6750\u6599\u76f8\u5f53\uff1b\u5728GHz\u901a\u5e26\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u539f\u578b\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u5728\u6beb\u5f00\u5c14\u6587\u6e29\u5ea6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u900f\u5c04\u7387\uff0c10GHz\u4ee5\u4e0b\u63d2\u5165\u635f\u8017\u5c0f\u4e8e0.4dB", "conclusion": "\u6210\u529f\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eMie\u6563\u5c04\u7684\u6750\u6599\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u62a4\u4f4e\u6e29\u91cf\u5b50\u5e94\u7528\u514d\u53d7\u7ea2\u5916\u8f90\u5c04\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728GHz\u9891\u6bb5\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4e\u635f\u8017\u4f20\u8f93\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u6ee4\u6ce2\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

Version to appear in Ann. Phys. (2026)", "summary": "We study how fermions in molybdenum disulfide MoS$_2$ interact with a laser field and a static potential barrier, focusing on the transmission probability. Our aim is to understand and control photon-assisted quantum transport in this two-dimensional material under external driving. We use the Floquet approximation to describe the wave functions in the three regions of the system. By applying continuity conditions at the boundaries, we obtain a set of equations involving an infinite number of Floquet modes. We explicitly determine transmissions involving the central band $E$ and the first sidebands $E \\pm \\hbar\u03c9$. As for higher-order bands, we use the transfer matrix approach together with current density to compute the associated transmissions. Our results reveal that the transmission probability oscillates for both spin-up and spin-down electrons. The oscillations of spin-down electrons occur over nearly twice the period of spin-up electrons. Among all bands, the central one consistently shows the highest transmission. We also find that stronger laser fields and wider barriers both lead to reduced transmission. Moreover, laser irradiation enables controllable channeling and filtering of transmission bands by tuning the laser intensity and system parameters.

The magnetism of the Mn$_2$GeO$_4$ olivine is surprisingly complex, proceeding from commensurate states to a multiferroic commensurate + incommensurate phase. Here we report inelastic neutron scattering results from a Mn$_2$GeO$_4$ single crystal and develop an effective Hamiltonian including long-distance bilinear and dipolar interactions. The magnetic interactions are predominantly antiferromagnetic and span a three-dimensional exchange network consisting of coupled sawtooth chains. Based on the determined strength of the couplings, the dominant sawtooth chains appear at third- and fourth- rather than next-nearest-neighbor. However the next-nearest-neighbor interaction is, along with a modest Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, important for modeling the observed incommensurability.

While the reduced dynamics violates equilibrium fluctuation-response relations, we show that the dynamical response to the stiffness perturbation is fully determined by steady-state correlations involving the exact conjugate observable in the Markovian embedding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u89e3\u6790\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u9002\u5f53\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9a\u91cf\u6062\u590d\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6da8\u843d-\u54cd\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb", "motivation": "\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u9700\u8981\u4fee\u6539\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u6da8\u843d-\u54cd\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5d4c\u5165\u6765\u6062\u590d\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5173\u7cfb", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5149\u5b66\u6355\u83b7\u5728\u8c10\u6ce2\u52bf\u4e2d\u7684\u80f6\u4f53\u7c92\u5b50\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53d7\u63a7\u6709\u8272\u566a\u58f0\u9a71\u52a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdc\u79bb\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u52bf\u9631\u521a\u5ea6\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u54cd\u5e94", "result": "\u867d\u7136\u7ea6\u5316\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u8fdd\u53cd\u5e73\u8861\u6da8\u843d-\u54cd\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4f46\u521a\u5ea6\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u54cd\u5e94\u5b8c\u5168\u7531\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u5d4c\u5165\u4e2d\u7cbe\u786e\u5171\u8f6d\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u91cf\u5728\u7a33\u6001\u4e0b\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u51b3\u5b9a", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u89e3\u6790\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u9002\u5f53\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9a\u91cf\u6062\u590d\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6da8\u843d-\u54cd\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb"}}

The amount of transferred spin differs between the singlet and triplet $m=0$ states due to quantum interference. The difference is such that the independent-electron approximation remains valid for spin transfer when injected spin currents are completely incoherent.

Existing machine learning approaches, such as equivariant graph neural networks, typically rely on specially-designed network architectures to enforce O(3) equivariance. However, to preserve equivariance, these specially-designed models restrict the update of equivariant features during message passing to linear transformations or gated equivariant nonlinearities. The inability to implicitly characterize more complex nonlinear structures may reduce the predictive accuracy of the model. In this study, we introduce a frame-averaging-based approach to achieve equivariant dielectric tensor prediction. We propose GoeCTP, an O(3)-equivariant framework that predicts dielectric tensors without imposing any structural restrictions on the backbone network. We benchmark its performance against several state-of-the-art models and further employ it for large-scale virtual screening of thermodynamically stable materials from the Materials Project database. GoeCTP successfully identifies various promising candidates, such as Zr(InBr$_3$)$_2$ (band gap $E_g = 2.41$ eV, dielectric constant $\\overline{\\varepsilon} = 194.72$) and SeI$_2$ (anisotropy ratio $\u03b1_r = 96.763$), demonstrating its accuracy and efficiency in accelerating the discovery of advanced inorganic dielectric materials.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faGoeCTP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e27\u5e73\u5747\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0O(3)\u7b49\u53d8\u4ecb\u7535\u5f20\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5bf9\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u65bd\u52a0\u7ed3\u6784\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u6750\u6599\u7b5b\u9009\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7b49\u53d8\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u7279\u6b8a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u6765\u4fdd\u8bc1O(3)\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u4e3a\u4e86\u4fdd\u6301\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u7279\u5f81\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u53d8\u6362\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e27\u5e73\u5747\u7684GoeCTP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e27\u5e73\u5747\u6280\u672f\u5b9e\u73b0O(3)\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5bf9\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u65bd\u52a0\u7ed3\u6784\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u53d8\u6362\u3002", "result": "GoeCTP\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u591a\u4e2a\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728Materials Project\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u865a\u62df\u7b5b\u9009\u4e2d\u6210\u529f\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u5019\u9009\u6750\u6599\uff0c\u5982Zr(InBr3)2\u548cSeI2\u3002", "conclusion": "GoeCTP\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5e27\u5e73\u5747\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4ecb\u7535\u5f20\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e3a\u52a0\u901f\u5148\u8fdb\u65e0\u673a\u4ecb\u7535\u6750\u6599\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Here, we develop a theory encapsulating the notion of a cascade of lightcones seeded by sequences of scattering of weakly interacting harmonic modes as witnessed by a suitably defined chaos diagnostic (classical decorrelator) that measures the spatiotemporal profile of many-body chaos. Our numerics deals with the concrete case of a classical Heisenberg chain, for either sign of the interaction, at low temperatures where the short-time dynamics are well captured in terms of non-interacting spin waves. To model low-temperature dynamics, we use ensembles of initial states with randomly embedded point defects in an otherwise ordered background, which provides a controlled setting for studying the scattering events. The decorrelator exhibits a short-time integrable regime followed by an intermediate `scarred' regime of the cascade of lightcones in progress; these then overlap, leading to an avalanche of scattering events which finally yields the standard long-time signature of many-body chaos.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u7ecf\u5178\u6d77\u68ee\u5821\u94fe\u5728\u4f4e\u6e29\u4e0b\u4ece\u8fd1\u53ef\u79ef\u884c\u4e3a\u5230\u591a\u4f53\u6df7\u6c8c\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u4e49\u6df7\u6c8c\u8bca\u65ad\u5668\uff08\u7ecf\u5178\u89e3\u5173\u8054\u5668\uff09\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7531\u5f31\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u81ea\u65cb\u6ce2\u6563\u5c04\u5f15\u53d1\u7684\u5149\u9525\u7ea7\u8054\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u5e38\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6df7\u6c8c\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4f4e\u6e29\u4e0b\uff0c\u5f31\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u51c6\u7c92\u5b50\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fd1\u53ef\u79ef\u884c\u4e3a\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u3002\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u622a\u7136\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u4e4b\u95f4\u5fc5\u7136\u5b58\u5728\u4ea4\u53c9\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u63cf\u8ff0\u8fd9\u79cd\u4ece\u8fd1\u53ef\u79ef\u5230\u6df7\u6c8c\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u5149\u9525\u7ea7\u8054\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7ecf\u5178\u89e3\u5173\u8054\u5668\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6df7\u6c8c\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u6570\u503c\u7814\u7a76\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178\u6d77\u68ee\u5821\u94fe\uff08\u6b63\u8d1f\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u6e29\u4e0b\u4f7f\u7528\u975e\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u81ea\u65cb\u6ce2\u8fd1\u4f3c\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u521d\u59cb\u72b6\u6001\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165\u968f\u673a\u70b9\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u96c6\u5408\u6765\u6a21\u62df\u4f4e\u6e29\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u6563\u5c04\u4e8b\u4ef6\u63d0\u4f9b\u53d7\u63a7\u73af\u5883\u3002", "result": "\u89e3\u5173\u8054\u5668\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u77ed\u65f6\u53ef\u79ef\u533a\u57df\u3001\u4e2d\u95f4\"\u75a4\u75d5\"\u533a\u57df\uff08\u5149\u9525\u7ea7\u8054\u8fdb\u884c\u4e2d\uff09\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u6700\u7ec8\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u591a\u4f53\u6df7\u6c8c\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u6563\u5c04\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u5149\u9525\u9996\u5148\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u91cd\u53e0\uff0c\u5f15\u53d1\u6563\u5c04\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u96ea\u5d29\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u5bfc\u81f4\u6df7\u6c8c\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u529f\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86\u4ece\u8fd1\u53ef\u79ef\u884c\u4e3a\u5230\u591a\u4f53\u6df7\u6c8c\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f31\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u8c10\u6ce2\u6a21\u5f0f\u5e8f\u5217\u6563\u5c04\u5f15\u53d1\u7684\u5149\u9525\u7ea7\u8054\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u591a\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6df7\u6c8c\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

We explain how non-Hermitian Hamiltonians can support eigenstates completely undetected by eigenvalues, with the unidirectional Hatano-Nelson model serving as both a minimal realization and universal paradigm for this phenomenon. Through exact analytical solutions, we show that this model contains not only hidden modes but multiple macroscopic hidden exceptional points that appear more generally in all systems with a non-trivial bulk winding. Our framework explains how the apparent bulk-edge correspondence failures in models like the non-Hermitian SSH chain instead reflect the systematic inability of the eigenvalue spectrum to detect certain eigenstates in systems with a skin-effect.

In particular, we identify the vanishing of a small orbit on the Fermi surface, associated with a quantum-oscillation frequency of 34 T. Furthermore, the different transitions are better resolved with acoustic modes of particular symmetry. Using a microscopic model adapted to the strongly correlated electronic structure of YbNi$_4$P$_2$, we describe our results by inspecting realistic electron-phonon couplings in reciprocal space for each acoustic mode.

The Fermi arcs on the two different (0001) surface terminations have been associated with the set of Weyl points just above the Fermi energy (E$_F$). Here using first-principles calculations to explore the band crossings over the full Brillouin zone between the nominally highest valence and lowest conduction bands in $\u03b3$-PtBi$_2$, we find a Weyl nodal loop (WNL) and multiple sets of Weyl points (WPs). The main difference between the two reported experimental structural parameters is the magnitude of Bi-layer buckling. While the WNL, bulk gap region and the set of Weyl points just above the E$_F$ are robust, the number and location of the other sets of WPs depend sensitively on the structural parameters with different magnitude of Bi-layer buckling.

The results show enhanced electron reflection related with the production of doublon-holon pairs, as known from the Klein paradox.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u51dd\u805a\u6001\u5f02\u8d28\u7ed3\u6784\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6a21\u62df\u514b\u83b1\u56e0\u6096\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u7535\u5b50-\u6b63\u7535\u5b50\u5bf9\u4ea7\u751f\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5173\u8054\u548c\u5f31\u5173\u8054\u7535\u5b50\u6750\u6599\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u53cd\u5c04\u548c\u53cc\u7c92\u5b50-\u7a7a\u7a74\u5bf9\u4ea7\u751f\u3002", "motivation": "\u514b\u83b1\u56e0\u6096\u8bba\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86\u7535\u5b50\u5728\u8d85\u4e34\u754c\u52bf\u5792\u5904\u6563\u5c04\u4ea7\u751f\u7535\u5b50-\u6b63\u7535\u5b50\u5bf9\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u57fa\u672c\u7c92\u5b50\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u4f46\u51dd\u805a\u6001\u7c7b\u6bd4\u7cfb\u7edf\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u663e\u793a\u65e0\u81ea\u65cb\u51c6\u7c92\u5b50\u7684\u5bf9\u4ea7\u751f\u7387\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u627e\u5230\u65b0\u7684\u51dd\u805a\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u8fd9\u4e00\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u7531\u5f3a\u5173\u8054\u7535\u5b50\u6750\u6599\u548c\u5f31\u5173\u8054\u7535\u5b50\u6750\u6599\u7ec4\u6210\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5173\u8054\u5c42\u6b21\u65b9\u6cd5\u6784\u5efa\u89e3\u6790\u89e3\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u7535\u5b50\u5728\u5f02\u8d28\u754c\u9762\u5904\u7684\u6563\u5c04\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u53cd\u5c04\u4e0e\u53cc\u7c92\u5b50-\u7a7a\u7a74\u5bf9\u7684\u4ea7\u751f\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0e\u514b\u83b1\u56e0\u6096\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u7535\u5b50-\u6b63\u7535\u5b50\u5bf9\u4ea7\u751f\u73b0\u8c61\u7c7b\u4f3c\uff0c\u4e3a\u51dd\u805a\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6a21\u62df\u514b\u83b1\u56e0\u6096\u8bba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5e73\u53f0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5f02\u8d28\u7ed3\u6784\u7cfb\u7edf\u6210\u529f\u6a21\u62df\u4e86\u514b\u83b1\u56e0\u6096\u8bba\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u7269\u7406\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u5173\u8054\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6563\u5c04\u548c\u7c92\u5b50\u5bf9\u4ea7\u751f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5e73\u53f0\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

However, charge generation and separation are inherently limited by its modest sunlight absorption and strong exciton binding energy, respectively. Here, we demonstrate that both the light absorption and exciton dissociation are improved by controlled substitution of Br with I via mechanochemical synthesis of Cs3Bi2(Br1-xIx)9. X-ray diffraction and Raman analyses confirm atomic-level halide mixing and reveal a crystallographic phase transition near x = 0.8. From absorption measurements on thin films, we determine the absorption coefficient, Urbach tail, and exciton binding energy for several Cs3Bi2(Br1-xIx)9 compositions. From here, we find that the band gap can be tuned from 2.59 to 1.93 eV (for x = 0.9), while exciton binding energies reach a minimum at x = 0.6. Finally, transient absorption spectroscopy measurements suggest a weak correlation between recombination lifetime and Urbach energy, where the longest lifetimes are observed for the materials with lowest disorder. These results offer valuable insights for designing stable bismuth halide semiconductors with favorable light absorption properties and charge carrier dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u673a\u68b0\u5316\u5b66\u5408\u6210Cs3Bi2(Br1-xIx)9\uff0c\u7528\u7898\u90e8\u5206\u53d6\u4ee3\u6eb4\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u9499\u949b\u77ff\u578b\u94cb\u5364\u5316\u7269\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\u7684\u5149\u5438\u6536\u548c\u6fc0\u5b50\u89e3\u79bb\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "Cs3Bi2Br9\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5149\u6d3b\u6027\u6750\u6599\u5728\u5149\u8f6c\u6362\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u53d7\u5230\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u592a\u9633\u5149\u5438\u6536\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u4e14\u6fc0\u5b50\u7ed3\u5408\u80fd\u8f83\u5f3a\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u7535\u8377\u751f\u6210\u548c\u5206\u79bb\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u673a\u68b0\u5316\u5b66\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5236\u5907Cs3Bi2(Br1-xIx)9\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7X\u5c04\u7ebf\u884d\u5c04\u548c\u62c9\u66fc\u5206\u6790\u786e\u8ba4\u5364\u5316\u7269\u539f\u5b50\u7ea7\u6df7\u5408\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cf\u8584\u819c\u5438\u6536\u7cfb\u6570\u3001Urbach\u5c3e\u548c\u6fc0\u5b50\u7ed3\u5408\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u77ac\u6001\u5438\u6536\u5149\u8c31\u7814\u7a76\u590d\u5408\u5bff\u547d\u3002", "result": "\u5e26\u9699\u53ef\u4ece2.59 eV\u8c03\u8c10\u81f31.93 eV\uff08x=0.9\uff09\uff0c\u6fc0\u5b50\u7ed3\u5408\u80fd\u5728x=0.6\u65f6\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5c0f\u503c\uff0c\u590d\u5408\u5bff\u547d\u4e0eUrbach\u80fd\u91cf\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u8f83\u5f31\uff0c\u6700\u4f4e\u65e0\u5e8f\u5ea6\u7684\u6750\u6599\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6700\u957f\u5bff\u547d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5364\u5316\u7269\u6df7\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u5149\u5438\u6536\u7279\u6027\u548c\u8f7d\u6d41\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u94cb\u5364\u5316\u7269\u534a\u5bfc\u4f53\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u5149\u8f6c\u6362\u6750\u6599\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

Owing to its simple crystal structure and excellent physical properties, layered CrI3 has been extensively studied in magneto-optical effects, excitons, tunneling transport, and novel memory devices. However, the most current theoretical studies rely heavily on the first-principles calculations, and a general analytical theoretical framework, particularly for electric-field modulation and transport properties, is still lacking. In this work, using a 28-band tight-binding model combined with linear response theory, we systematically investigate the optoelectronic response for monolayer CrI3 and its nanoribbons. The results demonstrate that: (1) a vertical electric field can selectively close the band gap of one spin channel while the other remains insulating, resulting a transition to an half-metallic state; (2) the electric field dynamically shifts the optical transition peaks, providing a theoretical basis for extracting band parameters from experimental photoconductivity spectra; (3) nanoribbons with different edge morphologies exhibit distinct edge-state distributions and electronic properties, indicating that optical transition can be dynamically modualted through edge design. The theoretical model developed in this study, which can describe external electric field effect, offers an efficient and flexible approach for analytically investigating the CrI3 family and related materials. This model overcomes the limitations of first-principles methods and provides a solid foundation for designing spintronic and optoelectronic devices controlled by electric fields and edge effect.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a28\u5e26\u7d27\u675f\u7f1a\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\u7ebf\u6027\u54cd\u5e94\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u5355\u5c42CrI3\u53ca\u5176\u7eb3\u7c73\u5e26\u7684\u5149\u7535\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7535\u573a\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u8c03\u63a7\u80fd\u9699\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u63a7\u5149\u5b66\u8dc3\u8fc1\u5cf0\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5bf9\u7535\u5b50\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1CrI3\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e8c\u7ef4\u78c1\u6027\u6750\u6599\u5df2\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u7b2c\u4e00\u6027\u539f\u7406\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u591f\u63cf\u8ff0\u7535\u573a\u8c03\u5236\u548c\u8f93\u8fd0\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u901a\u7528\u5206\u6790\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u752828\u5e26\u7d27\u675f\u7f1a\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\u7ebf\u6027\u54cd\u5e94\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u5355\u5c42CrI3\u53ca\u5176\u7eb3\u7c73\u5e26\u7684\u5149\u7535\u54cd\u5e94\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5782\u76f4\u7535\u573a\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u8fb9\u7f18\u5f62\u6001\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a(1)\u5782\u76f4\u7535\u573a\u53ef\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5730\u5173\u95ed\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u65cb\u901a\u9053\u7684\u80fd\u9699\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u534a\u91d1\u5c5e\u6001\u8f6c\u53d8\uff1b(2)\u7535\u573a\u52a8\u6001\u79fb\u52a8\u5149\u5b66\u8dc3\u8fc1\u5cf0\uff0c\u4e3a\u4ece\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5149\u5bfc\u8c31\u63d0\u53d6\u80fd\u5e26\u53c2\u6570\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff1b(3)\u4e0d\u540c\u8fb9\u7f18\u5f62\u6001\u7684\u7eb3\u7c73\u5e26\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u6001\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u7535\u5b50\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u5149\u5b66\u8dc3\u8fc1\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u8ba1\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u63a7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u63cf\u8ff0\u5916\u7535\u573a\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u4e3aCrI3\u5bb6\u65cf\u53ca\u76f8\u5173\u6750\u6599\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u5206\u6790\u7814\u7a76\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u7b2c\u4e00\u6027\u539f\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u7535\u573a\u548c\u8fb9\u7f18\u6548\u5e94\u8c03\u63a7\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u7535\u5b50\u5b66\u548c\u5149\u7535\u5668\u4ef6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u575a\u5b9e\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

However, their existence on the lattice, where continuum symmetries that protect them from decay are lost, is still an open and urgent question, especially considering the recent advances in the realization of Fractional Chern Insulators (FCI) in transition metal dichalcogenides and rhombohedral pentalayer graphene. Here we present a comprehensive theoretical and numerical study of graviton-modes in fermionic FCI, and thoroughly demonstrate their existence. We first derive a lattice stress tensor operator in the context of the fermionic Harper-Hofstadter(HH) model which captures the graviton in the flat band limit. Importantly, we discover that such lattice stress-tensor operators are deeply connected to lattice quadrupolar density correlators, readily generalizable to generic Chern bands. We then explicitly show the adiabatic connection between FQH and FCI chiral graviton modes by interpolating from a low flux HH model to a Checkerboard lattice model that hosts a topological flat band. In particular, using state-of-the-art matrix product state and exact diagonalization simulations, we provide strong evidence that chiral graviton modes are long-lived excitations in FCIs despite the lack of continuous symmetries and the scattering with a two-magnetoroton continuum. By means of a careful finite-size analysis, we show that the lattice generates a finite but small intrinsic decay rate for the graviton mode. We discuss the relevance of our results for the exploration of graviton modes in FCI phases realized in solid state settings, as well as cold atom experiments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u6570\u503c\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5206\u6570\u9648\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u4e2d\u624b\u6027\u5f15\u529b\u5b50\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6676\u683c\u7834\u574f\u4e86\u8fde\u7eed\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u5f0f\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u957f\u5bff\u547d\u7684\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u3002", "motivation": "\u5206\u6570\u91cf\u5b50\u970d\u5c14\u6db2\u4f53\u4e2d\u7684\u624b\u6027\u5f15\u529b\u5b50\u6a21\u5f0f\u662f\u6807\u5fd7\u6027\u7684\u96c6\u4f53\u6fc0\u53d1\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6676\u683c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u8fde\u7eed\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u7f3a\u5931\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u4e00\u76f4\u662f\u4e2a\u5f00\u653e\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u968f\u7740\u8fc7\u6e21\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e8c\u786b\u5316\u7269\u548c\u4e94\u5c42\u77f3\u58a8\u70ef\u4e2d\u5206\u6570\u9648\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u6676\u683c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u5b50\u6a21\u5f0f\u53d8\u5f97\u5c24\u4e3a\u8feb\u5207\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u8d39\u7c73\u5b50Harper-Hofstadter\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u6676\u683c\u5e94\u529b\u5f20\u91cf\u7b97\u7b26\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u4e0e\u6676\u683c\u56db\u6781\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5173\u8054\u5b50\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173\u3002\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u4f4e\u901a\u91cfHH\u6a21\u578b\u63d2\u503c\u5230\u5177\u6709\u62d3\u6251\u5e73\u5e26\u7684Checkerboard\u6676\u683c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5206\u6570\u91cf\u5b50\u970d\u5c14\u4e0e\u5206\u6570\u9648\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u624b\u6027\u5f15\u529b\u5b50\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u7edd\u70ed\u8fde\u63a5\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u79ef\u6001\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u5bf9\u89d2\u5316\u6a21\u62df\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u503c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u6709\u529b\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8fde\u7eed\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u4e0e\u53cc\u78c1\u8f6c\u5b50\u8fde\u7eed\u8c31\u7684\u6563\u5c04\uff0c\u624b\u6027\u5f15\u529b\u5b50\u6a21\u5f0f\u5728\u5206\u6570\u9648\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u4e2d\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u957f\u5bff\u547d\u7684\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4ed4\u7ec6\u7684\u6709\u9650\u5c3a\u5bf8\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6676\u683c\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u6709\u9650\u4f46\u8f83\u5c0f\u7684\u672c\u5f81\u8870\u51cf\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u624b\u6027\u5f15\u529b\u5b50\u6a21\u5f0f\u5728\u5206\u6570\u9648\u7edd\u7f18\u4f53\u4e2d\u7684\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u4e3a\u5728\u56fa\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u51b7\u539f\u5b50\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u63a2\u7d22\u5f15\u529b\u5b50\u6a21\u5f0f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u6570\u503c\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

While they have appealing properties, their isotropic metallic bonding makes their stabilization difficult and presents considerable challenges to their synthesis and practical applications. However, their stabilization can still be achieved by suspending them in the pores of two-dimensional template materials, making the properties of lateral interfaces of metallenes scientifically relevant. Here, we combined density-functional theory and universal machine-learning interatomic potentials to study lateral interfaces between graphene and 45 metallenes with various profiles. We optimized the interfaces and analyzed their energies, electronic structures, and stabilities at room temperature, defect formations, and structural deformations. While broad trends were identified using machine-learning analysis of all interfaces, density-functional theory was the main tool for studying the microscopic properties of selected elements. We found that the interfaces are the most stable energetically and with respect to lattice mismatch, defect formation, and lateral strain when their profiles were geometrically smooth. The most stable interfaces are found for transition metals. In addition, we demonstrate how universal machine-learning interatomic potentials now offer the accuracy required for the modeling of graphene-metallene interfaces.

In this way, borospherenes, a 2D Boron-based fullerene-like lattice (2D-B40), are explored due to their potential for capturing and detecting toxic gases, such as CO, NO, NH3, and SO2. Therefore, density functional theory simulations were carried out to explore the adsorption energy and the distinct interaction regimes, where CO exhibits weak physisorption (-0.16 eV), while NO (-2.24 eV), NH3 (-1.47 eV), and SO2 (-1.51 eV) undergo strong chemisorption. Bader charge analysis reveals significant electron donation from 2D-B40 to NO and electron acceptance from SO2. These interactions cause measurable shifts in work function, with SO2 producing the most significant modulation (14.6%). Remarkably, ab initio molecular dynamics simulations (AIMD) reveal spontaneous SO2 decomposition at room temperature, indicating dual functionality for both sensing and environmental remediation.

Here, using first-principles calculations, we reveal that monolayer CuVP$_2$Se$_6$ unites a tunable triple-well ferroelectric transition with a spin-polarized Chern flat band. The ferroelectric and paraelectric phases are close in energy and can be reversibly switched by moderate strain or an electric field. During the transition, a kagome-like flat band emerges near the Fermi level, which we describe via a minimal three-orbital tight-binding model on a triangular lattice. Furthermore, the system exhibits sizable magnetic anisotropy and a magnetization-dependent Chern insulating state: the Chern number is $C = \\pm 1$ for out-of-plane magnetization but becomes trivial when the moments rotate in-plane.

All Li-S species exhibit robust binding to Goldene. The adsorption energies range from -4.29 to -1.90 eV. S8 that is alone interacts much less strongly. Charge density difference and Bader analyses indicate that substantial charge is transferred to the substrate, with a maximum 0.92 e for Li-rich clusters. This transfer induces polarization at the interface and shifts the work function to 5.30-5.52 eV. Projected density-of-states calculations indicate that Au-d and S-p states strongly mix near the Fermi level. This hybridization indicates that the electronic coupling is strong. Based on these results, the reaction free-energy profile for the stepwise conversion of S8 to Li2S on Goldene is thermodynamically favorable. The overall stabilization is -3.64 eV, and the rate-determining barrier for the Li2S2 -> Li2S step is 0.47 eV. This shows that Goldene is an effective surface for anchoring and mediating lithium polysulfide reactions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528\u7b2c\u4e00\u6027\u539f\u7406\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6cdb\u51fd\u7406\u8bba\u7814\u7a76\u9502\u786b\u5316\u7269\u548c\u591a\u786b\u5316\u7269\u7c07\u5728\u65b0\u578b\u4e8c\u7ef4\u91d1\u540c\u7d20\u5f02\u5f62\u4f53Goldene\u4e0a\u7684\u5438\u9644\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0Goldene\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u951a\u5b9a\u548c\u4ecb\u5bfc\u9502\u591a\u786b\u5316\u7269\u53cd\u5e94", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76Goldene\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u4e8c\u7ef4\u91d1\u6750\u6599\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9502\u786b\u7535\u6c60\u4e2d\u591a\u786b\u5316\u7269\u951a\u5b9a\u548c\u8f6c\u5316\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u9502\u786b\u7535\u6c60\u4e2d\u591a\u786b\u5316\u7269\u7a7f\u68ad\u6548\u5e94\u95ee\u9898", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7b2c\u4e00\u6027\u539f\u7406\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6cdb\u51fd\u7406\u8bba\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u7814\u7a76Li2S\u3001Li2S2\u3001Li2S4\u3001Li2S6\u3001Li2S8\u548cS8\u7b49\u9502\u786b\u5316\u7269\u7c07\u5728Goldene\u4e0a\u7684\u5438\u9644\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u5438\u9644\u80fd\u3001\u7535\u8377\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5dee\u3001Bader\u7535\u8377\u3001\u529f\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u6295\u5f71\u6001\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5206\u6790", "result": "\u6240\u6709\u9502\u786b\u7269\u79cd\u5728Goldene\u4e0a\u90fd\u6709\u5f3a\u5438\u9644\uff08-4.29\u5230-1.90 eV\uff09\uff0c\u7535\u8377\u8f6c\u79fb\u663e\u8457\uff08\u6700\u9ad80.92 e\uff09\uff0c\u529f\u51fd\u6570\u53d8\u4e3a5.30-5.52 eV\uff0cAu-d\u548cS-p\u6001\u5728\u8d39\u7c73\u80fd\u7ea7\u9644\u8fd1\u5f3a\u70c8\u6742\u5316\uff0cS8\u5230Li2S\u7684\u9010\u6b65\u8f6c\u5316\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u6709\u5229\uff08\u603b\u7a33\u5b9a\u5316\u80fd-3.64 eV\uff09\uff0cLi2S2\u2192Li2S\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u901f\u7387\u51b3\u5b9a\u52bf\u5792\u4e3a0.47 eV", "conclusion": "Goldene\u662f\u951a\u5b9a\u548c\u4ecb\u5bfc\u9502\u591a\u786b\u5316\u7269\u53cd\u5e94\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8868\u9762\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9502\u786b\u7535\u6c60\u7684\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u50ac\u5316\u5242\u6750\u6599"}}

Known antiferroelectrics are relatively scarce and mainly based on a limited set of perovskite materials and their alloys (e.g., PbZrO$_3$, AgNbO$_3$, NaNbO$_3$). Here, a new family of lead-free, weberite-type antiferroelectrics, identified through a large-scale, first-principles computational search is introduced. The screening methodology, which connects lattice dynamics to antipolar distortions, predicted that La$_3$NbO$_7$ could exhibit antiferroelectricity. We confirm the prediction through the synthesis and characterization of epitaxial La$_3$NbO$_7$ thin films, which display the signature double hysteresis loops of an antiferroelectric material as well as clear evidence of an antipolar ground state structure from transmission electron microscopy. The antiferroelectricity in La$_3$NbO$_7$ is simpler than most known antiferroelectrics and can be explained by a Kittel-type mechanism involving the movement of niobium atoms in an oxygen octahedron through a single phonon mode which results in a smaller change in the volume during the field-induced phase transition. Additionally, it is found that La$_3$NbO$_7$ combines a high threshold field with a high breakdown field ($\\approx$ 6MV/cm) - which opens up opportunities for energy-storage applications. This new weberite-type family of materials offers many opportunities to tune electrical and temperature response especially through substitutions on the rare-earth site. Ultimately, this work demonstrates a successful data-driven theory-to-experiment discovery of an entirely new family of antiferroelectrics and provides a blueprint for the future design of ferroic materials.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7b2c\u4e00\u6027\u539f\u7406\u8ba1\u7b97\u7b5b\u9009\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u65e0\u94c5weberite\u7ed3\u6784\u53cd\u94c1\u7535\u6750\u6599La\u2083NbO\u2087\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u53cd\u94c1\u7535\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u80fd\u91cf\u5b58\u50a8\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u673a\u4f1a\u3002", "motivation": "\u5df2\u77e5\u53cd\u94c1\u7535\u6750\u6599\u76f8\u5bf9\u7a00\u7f3a\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u5c11\u6570\u9499\u949b\u77ff\u6750\u6599\u53ca\u5176\u5408\u91d1\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u53cd\u94c1\u7535\u6750\u6599\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002\u9700\u8981\u53d1\u73b0\u65b0\u578b\u53cd\u94c1\u7535\u6750\u6599\u5bb6\u65cf\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u6750\u6599\u9009\u62e9\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7b2c\u4e00\u6027\u539f\u7406\u8ba1\u7b97\u7b5b\u9009\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fde\u63a5\u6676\u683c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e0e\u53cd\u6781\u6027\u7578\u53d8\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u53cd\u94c1\u7535\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u548c\u8868\u5f81\u5916\u5ef6La\u2083NbO\u2087\u8584\u819c\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u53cc\u7535\u6ede\u56de\u7ebf\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u900f\u5c04\u7535\u5b50\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u9884\u6d4b\u5e76\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86La\u2083NbO\u2087\u7684\u53cd\u94c1\u7535\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u5178\u578b\u7684\u53cc\u7535\u6ede\u56de\u7ebf\u548c\u53cd\u6781\u6027\u57fa\u6001\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u8be5\u6750\u6599\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u9608\u503c\u7535\u573a\u548c\u9ad8\u51fb\u7a7f\u7535\u573a\uff08\u7ea66MV/cm\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u76f8\u53d8\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4f53\u79ef\u53d8\u5316\u8f83\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\u5230\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u6210\u529f\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u65b0\u7684weberite\u578b\u53cd\u94c1\u7535\u6750\u6599\u5bb6\u65cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u94c1\u7535\u6750\u6599\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u84dd\u56fe\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u80fd\u91cf\u5b58\u50a8\u5e94\u7528\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

The lattice mismatch and relative twist angle between 2D layers have shown to result in Moir\u00e9 patterns associated with widely tunable electronic properties, ranging from Mott and Chern insulators to semi- and super-conductors. Extended to three-dimensional (3D) structures, Moir\u00e9 materials unlock an entirely new crystallographic space defined by the elements of the 3D rotation group and translational symmetry of the constituent lattices. 3D Moir\u00e9 crystals exhibit fascinating novel properties, often not found in the individual components, yet the general construction principles of 3D Moir\u00e9 crystals remain largely unknown. Here we establish fundamental mathematical principles of 3D Moir\u00e9 crystallography and propose a general method of 3D Moir\u00e9 crystal construction using Clifford algebras over the field of rational numbers. We illustrate several examples of 3D Moir\u00e9 structures representing realistic chemical frameworks and highlight their potential applications in condensed matter physics and solid-state chemistry.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e09\u7ef4\u83ab\u5c14\u6676\u4f53\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u6570\u5b66\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f7f\u7528\u6709\u7406\u6570\u57df\u4e0a\u7684\u514b\u5229\u798f\u5fb7\u4ee3\u6570\u6784\u5efa\u4e09\u7ef4\u83ab\u5c14\u6676\u4f53\u7684\u901a\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e8c\u7ef4\u83ab\u5c14\u6750\u6599\u5df2\u7ecf\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u4f46\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u4e09\u7ef4\u7ed3\u6784\u65f6\uff0c\u5176\u4e00\u822c\u6784\u9020\u539f\u7406\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002\u4e09\u7ef4\u83ab\u5c14\u6676\u4f53\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u8bb8\u591a\u65b0\u9896\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6709\u7406\u6570\u57df\u4e0a\u7684\u514b\u5229\u798f\u5fb7\u4ee3\u6570\u5efa\u7acb\u4e09\u7ef4\u83ab\u5c14\u6676\u4f53\u5b66\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u6570\u5b66\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u7528\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u83ab\u5c14\u6676\u4f53\u6784\u9020\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e09\u7ef4\u83ab\u5c14\u6676\u4f53\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u6784\u9020\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4ee3\u8868\u73b0\u5b9e\u5316\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u83ab\u5c14\u7ed3\u6784\u793a\u4f8b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u4e09\u7ef4\u83ab\u5c14\u6676\u4f53\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u51dd\u805a\u6001\u7269\u7406\u548c\u56fa\u6001\u5316\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

While atomistic simulations offer a route to computing liquid properties directly from atomic motion, the most accurate approach, ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD), is computationally costly and restricted to short time and length scales. Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLPs) offer AIMD accuracy at far lower cost, but their application to liquids is limited by training datasets that inadequately sample atomic configurations, leading to unphysical force predictions and unstable trajectories. Here we introduce a physically motivated dataset-engineering strategy that constructs liquidlike training data synthetically rather than relying on AIMD configurations. The method exploits the established icosahedral short-range order of metallic liquids, twelvefold, near-close-packed local coordination, and generates \"synthetic-liquid\" structures by systematic perturbation of crystalline references. MLPs trained on these datasets close the sampling gaps that lead to unphysical predictions, remain numerically stable across temperatures, and reproduce experimental liquid densities, diffusivities, and melting temperatures for multiple elemental metals. The framework links atomic-scale sampling to long-term MD stability and provides a practical route to predictive modeling of liquid-phase thermophysical behavior beyond the limits of direct AIMD.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u52a8\u673a\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5de5\u7a0b\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6270\u52a8\u6676\u4f53\u53c2\u8003\u7ed3\u6784\u751f\u6210\"\u5408\u6210\u6db2\u4f53\"\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u52bf\u5728\u6db2\u4f53\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u6db2\u6001\u91d1\u5c5e\u70ed\u7269\u7406\u6027\u8d28\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u6db2\u6001\u91d1\u5c5e\u5728\u80fd\u6e90\u5b58\u50a8\u548c\u6838\u6280\u672f\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u70ed\u7269\u7406\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u77e5\u8bc6\u6709\u9650\u3002\u867d\u7136\u4ece\u5934\u7b97\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff08AIMD\uff09\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u6db2\u4f53\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u9650\u4e8e\u77ed\u65f6\u7a7a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u3002\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u52bf\uff08MLPs\uff09\u80fd\u4ee5\u66f4\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u8fbe\u5230AIMD\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6db2\u4f53\u65f6\u56e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u91c7\u6837\u4e0d\u8db3\u5bfc\u81f4\u975e\u7269\u7406\u529b\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7269\u7406\u52a8\u673a\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5de5\u7a0b\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u5229\u7528\u91d1\u5c5e\u6db2\u4f53\u4e2d\u5df2\u786e\u7acb\u7684\u4e8c\u5341\u9762\u4f53\u77ed\u7a0b\u6709\u5e8f\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u5341\u4e8c\u91cd\u8fd1\u5bc6\u5806\u79ef\u5c40\u90e8\u914d\u4f4d\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6676\u4f53\u53c2\u8003\u7ed3\u6784\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6270\u52a8\u6765\u751f\u6210\"\u5408\u6210\u6db2\u4f53\"\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u6db2\u4f53\u72b6\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u800c\u975e\u4f9d\u8d56AIMD\u914d\u7f6e\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5408\u6210\u6db2\u4f53\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684MLPs\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u5bfc\u81f4\u975e\u7269\u7406\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6e29\u5ea6\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u590d\u73b0\u591a\u79cd\u5143\u7d20\u91d1\u5c5e\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6db2\u4f53\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3001\u6269\u6563\u7cfb\u6570\u548c\u7194\u5316\u6e29\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u539f\u5b50\u5c3a\u5ea6\u91c7\u6837\u4e0e\u957f\u671fMD\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u4e3a\u8d85\u8d8a\u76f4\u63a5AIMD\u9650\u5236\u7684\u6db2\u76f8\u70ed\u7269\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u9884\u6d4b\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Using this technique, we directly probe a laser-excited phase transition in the prototypical material vanadium dioxide (VO2), recording its spatiotemporal propagation. This direct imaging capability reveals the dynamics of the structural phase transition and connects it to the resulting strain formation on picosecond timescales.

Here, we propose a new scheme combining spin space groups (SSGs)--approximate symmetry groups neglecting spin-orbit coupling (SOC)--and MSGs to diagnose topology in collinear magnetic materials based on symmetry-indicator theory, enabling a systematic classification of the electronic topology across 484 experimentally synthesized collinear magnets from the MAGNDATA database. This new scheme exploits a symmetry-hierarchy due to SOC induced symmetry-breaking, so that nontrivial band topology can be revealed by SSG, that is yet invisible by the conventional MSG-based method, as exemplified by real triple points in ferromagnetic CaCu$_3$Fe$_2$Sb$_2$O$_{12}$, Dirac nodal lines at generic $k$-points in antiferromagnetic FePSe$_3$ and Weyl nodal lines in altermagnetic Sr$_4$Fe$_4$O$_{11}$. Notably, FePSe$_3$ is topologically trivial under MSG but hosts Dirac nodal lines within the SSG framework. Upon including SOC, these nodal lines are gapped and generate a sizable anomalous Hall conductivity. Despite a vanishing bulk net magnetism, FePSe$_3$ can host topologically protected surface states with large non-relativistic band spin-splitting. Moreover, topology in MTMs is tunable by rotating the magnetic moment direction once SOC is included, as exemplified in Sr$_4$Fe$_4$O$_{11}$.The interplay of topology with non-relativistic and SOC-induced control of properties via magnetic moment reorientation in the predicted MTMs is worthy of further studies in future.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u65cb\u7a7a\u95f4\u7fa4\u548c\u78c1\u7a7a\u95f4\u7fa4\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bca\u65ad484\u79cd\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5408\u6210\u7684\u5171\u7ebf\u78c1\u4f53\u62d3\u6251\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u7279\u5f81", "motivation": "\u78c1\u62d3\u6251\u6750\u6599\u9884\u6d4b\u7a00\u7f3a\u963b\u788d\u5b9e\u9645\u5668\u4ef6\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u78c1\u7a7a\u95f4\u7fa4\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u63ed\u793a\u67d0\u4e9b\u62d3\u6251\u7279\u5f81", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u65cb\u7a7a\u95f4\u7fa4\uff08\u5ffd\u7565\u81ea\u65cb\u8f68\u9053\u8026\u5408\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5bf9\u79f0\u7fa4\uff09\u548c\u78c1\u7a7a\u95f4\u7fa4\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u6307\u6807\u7406\u8bba\u8bca\u65ad\u5171\u7ebf\u78c1\u4f53\u62d3\u6251\u6027\u8d28", "result": "\u5728484\u79cd\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5408\u6210\u78c1\u4f53\u4e2d\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u7c7b\u7535\u5b50\u62d3\u6251\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u7279\u5f81\uff1aCaCu\u2083Fe\u2082Sb\u2082O\u2081\u2082\u7684\u4e09\u91cd\u70b9\u3001FePSe\u2083\u7684\u72c4\u62c9\u514b\u8282\u7ebf\u3001Sr\u2084Fe\u2084O\u2081\u2081\u7684\u97e6\u5c14\u8282\u7ebf", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u65b9\u6848\u80fd\u63ed\u793a\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u78c1\u62d3\u6251\u6750\u6599\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u6027\u8d28\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u65cb\u8f6c\u78c1\u77e9\u65b9\u5411\u8c03\u63a7\uff0c\u503c\u5f97\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76"}}

The introduction of Mn was found to modify the valence band electronic structure, resulting in an improvement in the Seebeck coefficient and thus, the figure of merit (ZT). In the paper, we present a synchrotron radiation study of the electronic band structure of Sn(0.9)Mn(0.1)Te by resonant photoemission. The contribution of the Mn3d electrons to the valence band (VB), calculated as the difference between the Energy Distribution Curves (EDCs) taken at the maximum and minimum of the Fano resonance for the Mn3p - Mn3d absorption threshold, shows a contribution at the VB edge, a dominant maximum at 4 eV, as well as a wide structure between 7 and 11 eV. Moreover, comparison with undoped SnTe reveals strong renormalization of the Sn5p and Te5p electronic states, which certainly influences the shape of the upper part of the valence band and electron effective mass.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u632f\u5149\u7535\u5b50\u80fd\u8c31\u7814\u7a76Mn\u63ba\u6742SnTe\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u80fd\u5e26\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0Mn3d\u7535\u5b50\u5bf9\u4ef7\u5e26\u8fb9\u7f18\u6709\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u8d77Sn5p\u548cTe5p\u7535\u5b50\u6001\u91cd\u6574\u5316", "motivation": "Mn\u63ba\u6742SnTe\u4f5c\u4e3a\u70ed\u7535\u6750\u6599\u5907\u53d7\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u4f46Mn\u63ba\u6742\u5982\u4f55\u6539\u53d8\u7535\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u5c1a\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u6e05\u695a\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7814\u7a76Mn3d\u7535\u5b50\u5bf9\u4ef7\u5e26\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u70ed\u7535\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u540c\u6b65\u8f90\u5c04\u5171\u632f\u5149\u7535\u5b50\u80fd\u8c31\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cfSn0.9Mn0.1Te\u5728Mn3p-Mn3d\u5438\u6536\u9608\u503c\u5904\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\u66f2\u7ebf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Fano\u5171\u632f\u6700\u5927\u548c\u6700\u5c0f\u503c\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u8ba1\u7b97Mn3d\u7535\u5b50\u5bf9\u4ef7\u5e26\u7684\u8d21\u732e", "result": "Mn3d\u7535\u5b50\u5728\u4ef7\u5e26\u8fb9\u7f18\u6709\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u57284eV\u5904\u6709\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5cf0\uff0c\u57287-11eV\u6709\u5bbd\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u4e0e\u672a\u63ba\u6742SnTe\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cSn5p\u548cTe5p\u7535\u5b50\u6001\u53d1\u751f\u663e\u8457\u91cd\u6574\u5316\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4ef7\u5e26\u4e0a\u90e8\u5f62\u72b6\u548c\u7535\u5b50\u6709\u6548\u8d28\u91cf", "conclusion": "Mn\u63ba\u6742\u901a\u8fc7Mn3d\u7535\u5b50\u8d21\u732e\u548cSn/Te\u7535\u5b50\u6001\u91cd\u6574\u5316\u6539\u53d8SnTe\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u8fd9\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u70ed\u7535\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u6539\u5584\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u70ed\u7535\u6750\u6599\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u89c1\u89e3"}}

To be presented at APS", "summary": "Flat bands are associated with a range of desirable physical phenomena and potential applications, including enhanced superconducting tendencies due to the high density of states, strongly correlated phases such as quantum Hall states. Systems in which flat bands can be switched or tuned are therefore of particular interest. In this study, we analyze the electronic structure of two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) subjected to a linearly increasing magnetic-field dipole together with a transverse electric field, using the operator formalism of the quantum harmonic oscillator. When the electric field magnitude is tuned to a sequence of discrete values, different levels of energy bands are flattened. Moreover, at a specific electric field strength, the ground-state wave function admits an exact closed-form solution that can be understood through the magnetic drifts cancellation in the classical electrodynamics. We also demonstrate two distinct transmission properties, the quantized Hall conductance and the enhanced density of states, of the electrically switchable flat band. These findings establish a new route toward magnetoelectric band engineering and electrically guided transport in low-dimensional systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e8c\u7ef4\u7535\u5b50\u6c14\u5728\u78c1\u573a\u68af\u5ea6\u548c\u6a2a\u5411\u7535\u573a\u4e0b\u7684\u80fd\u5e26\u8c03\u63a7\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7279\u5b9a\u7535\u573a\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0b\u80fd\u5e26\u4f1a\u53d8\u5e73\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u6709\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u970d\u5c14\u7535\u5bfc\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u6001\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7b49\u4f20\u8f93\u7279\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e73\u5e26\u4e0e\u591a\u79cd\u7406\u60f3\u7269\u7406\u73b0\u8c61\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u5982\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u8d85\u5bfc\u503e\u5411\u548c\u5f3a\u5173\u8054\u76f8\u3002\u80fd\u591f\u5207\u6362\u6216\u8c03\u8282\u5e73\u5e26\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u7279\u522b\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u901a\u8fc7\u7535\u78c1\u573a\u8c03\u63a7\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e73\u5e26\u7684\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u8c10\u632f\u5b50\u7684\u7b97\u7b26\u5f62\u5f0f\u5206\u6790\u4e8c\u7ef4\u7535\u5b50\u6c14\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u589e\u52a0\u7684\u78c1\u573a\u68af\u5ea6\u548c\u6a2a\u5411\u7535\u573a\u4e0b\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u8282\u7535\u573a\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5230\u7279\u5b9a\u79bb\u6563\u503c\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u80fd\u5e26\u5e73\u5766\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5f53\u7535\u573a\u5f3a\u5ea6\u8c03\u8282\u5230\u7279\u5b9a\u79bb\u6563\u503c\u65f6\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u80fd\u7ea7\u80fd\u5e26\u4f1a\u53d8\u5e73\u3002\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u7535\u573a\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0b\uff0c\u57fa\u6001\u6ce2\u51fd\u6570\u6709\u7cbe\u786e\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\uff0c\u5bf9\u5e94\u7ecf\u5178\u7535\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u78c1\u6f02\u79fb\u62b5\u6d88\u3002\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5e73\u5e26\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u4f20\u8f93\u7279\u6027\uff1a\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u970d\u5c14\u7535\u5bfc\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u6001\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u4f4e\u7ef4\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u78c1\u7535\u80fd\u5e26\u5de5\u7a0b\u548c\u7535\u5bfc\u4f20\u8f93\u63a7\u5236\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7535\u573a\u53ef\u5207\u6362\u7684\u5e73\u5e26\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

In this article we demonstrate the high-throughput exploration of the crystal energy landscape of zinc imidazolate (ZnIm2), a highly polymorphic member of the zeolitic imidazolate (ZIF) family, with at least 24 reported structural and topological forms, with new polymorphs still being regularly discovered. With the aid of custom-trained machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) we have performed a high-throughput sampling of over 3 million randomly-generated crystal packing arrangements and identified 9626 energy minima characterized by 1493 network topologies, including 864 topologies that have not been reported before. Comparisons with previously reported structures revealed 13 topological matches to the experimentally-observed structures of ZnIm2, demonstrating the power of the CSP method in sampling experimentally-relevant ZIF structures. Finally, through a combination of topological analysis, density and porosity considerations, we have identified a set of structures representing promising targets for future experimental screening. Finally, we demonstrate how CSP can be used to assist in the identification of the products of the mechanochemical synthesis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u539f\u5b50\u95f4\u52bf\u80fd\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u901a\u91cf\u6676\u4f53\u7ed3\u6784\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u950c\u54aa\u5511\u9178\u76d0\u7684\u6676\u4f53\u80fd\u91cf\u666f\u89c2\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u5927\u91cf\u65b0\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86CSP\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u76f8\u5173ZIF\u7ed3\u6784\u91c7\u6837\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u950c\u54aa\u5511\u9178\u76d0\uff08ZnIm2\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6cb8\u77f3\u54aa\u5511\u916f\u9aa8\u67b6\uff08ZIF\uff09\u5bb6\u65cf\u4e2d\u9ad8\u5ea6\u591a\u6676\u578b\u7684\u6210\u5458\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u81f3\u5c1124\u79cd\u5df2\u77e5\u7ed3\u6784\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u65b0\u591a\u6676\u578b\u4ecd\u5728\u4e0d\u65ad\u53d1\u73b0\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u9ad8\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63a2\u7d22\u5176\u6676\u4f53\u80fd\u91cf\u666f\u89c2\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u65b0\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6676\u4f53\u7ed3\u6784\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u76f8\u5173\u7ed3\u6784\u91c7\u6837\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5b9a\u5236\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u539f\u5b50\u95f4\u52bf\u80fd\uff08MLIPs\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u901a\u91cf\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc7300\u4e07\u4e2a\u968f\u673a\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6676\u4f53\u5806\u79ef\u6392\u5217\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e869626\u4e2a\u80fd\u91cf\u6781\u5c0f\u503c\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u5e941493\u79cd\u7f51\u7edc\u62d3\u6251\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d864\u79cd\u662f\u5148\u524d\u672a\u62a5\u9053\u7684\u65b0\u62d3\u6251\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e8613\u4e2a\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684ZnIm2\u7ed3\u6784\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86CSP\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u91c7\u6837\u5b9e\u9a8c\u76f8\u5173ZIF\u7ed3\u6784\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u62d3\u6251\u5206\u6790\u3001\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u5b54\u9699\u7387\u8003\u8651\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u4e00\u7ec4\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u4f5c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7b5b\u9009\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86CSP\u5982\u4f55\u8f85\u52a9\u8bc6\u522b\u673a\u68b0\u5316\u5b66\u5408\u6210\u4ea7\u7269\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6676\u4f53\u7ed3\u6784\u9884\u6d4b\uff08CSP\uff09\u5df2\u6210\u4e3a\u91d1\u5c5e\u6709\u673a\u6846\u67b6\uff08MOFs\uff09\u8ba1\u7b97\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u539f\u5b50\u95f4\u52bf\u80fd\u7684\u9ad8\u901a\u91cf\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63a2\u7d22\u9ad8\u5ea6\u591a\u6676\u578bZIF\u6750\u6599\u7684\u6676\u4f53\u80fd\u91cf\u666f\u89c2\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u65b0\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5408\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86CSP\u5728\u6750\u6599\u53d1\u73b0\u4e2d\u7684\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

These materials underpin organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs), which translate such interactions into low-voltage signal amplification and sensing for applications in bioelectronics, neuromorphic computing, and memory. Despite their central role, OECT current-voltage transfer characteristics are often treated phenomenologically, as both the local multimodal dynamics and their connection to global device response remain unresolved. Here, we reveal that the transfer curve encodes a cascade of spatially localized electrochemical transitions, each associated with distinct changes in conductivity, stiffness, and morphology, fundamentally redefining it as a spatially resolved fingerprint of device's internal state. Using automated operando multimodal in-liquid scanning dielectric microscopy, we directly map these dynamics and identify region-specific electrochemical thresholds governing the interplay between source, channel, and drain. We found that the local tip-sample electrostatic force serves as a remarkable mechanistic observable of coupled multimodal dynamics in mixed conductors. A physically grounded model links it to general material, interfacial, and geometric parameters, enabling mechanistic interpretation and predictive insights. Our work provides a new framework for probing and understanding mixed conduction in ion-electron coupled systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u539f\u4f4d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u626b\u63cf\u4ecb\u7535\u663e\u5fae\u955c\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6709\u673a\u7535\u5316\u5b66\u6676\u4f53\u7ba1\u8f6c\u79fb\u66f2\u7ebf\u4e2d\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5c40\u57df\u7535\u5316\u5b66\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5c40\u90e8\u9759\u7535\u529b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6df7\u5408\u5bfc\u4f53\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u6307\u6807\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df7\u5408\u79bb\u5b50-\u7535\u5b50\u5bfc\u4f53\u5728\u6709\u673a\u7535\u5316\u5b66\u6676\u4f53\u7ba1\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u7535\u6d41-\u7535\u538b\u8f6c\u79fb\u7279\u6027\u901a\u5e38\u88ab\u73b0\u8c61\u5b66\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5c40\u90e8\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u5668\u4ef6\u54cd\u5e94\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u5c1a\u672a\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u539f\u4f4d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5728\u6db2\u626b\u63cf\u4ecb\u7535\u663e\u5fae\u955c\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u6620\u5c04\u6df7\u5408\u5bfc\u4f53\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u63a7\u5236\u6e90\u6781\u3001\u6c9f\u9053\u548c\u6f0f\u6781\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u533a\u57df\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u7535\u5316\u5b66\u9608\u503c\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u8f6c\u79fb\u66f2\u7ebf\u7f16\u7801\u4e86\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u7a7a\u95f4\u5c40\u57df\u7684\u7535\u5316\u5b66\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e0e\u7535\u5bfc\u7387\u3001\u521a\u5ea6\u548c\u5f62\u6001\u7684\u663e\u8457\u53d8\u5316\u76f8\u5173\uff1b\u5c40\u90e8\u5c16\u7aef-\u6837\u54c1\u9759\u7535\u529b\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8026\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u673a\u5236\u89c2\u6d4b\u6307\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u5c40\u90e8\u9759\u7535\u529b\u4e0e\u4e00\u822c\u6750\u6599\u3001\u754c\u9762\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u53c2\u6570\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u4e3a\u63a2\u6d4b\u548c\u7406\u89e3\u79bb\u5b50-\u7535\u5b50\u8026\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u4f20\u5bfc\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Experiments show that 18% Nb-Mo substitution reduces the occupation of bulk and (001) surface bands, effectively producing a chemical potential shift of $\\approx 0.3$ eV. Orbital character and dimensionality of the bulk bands is examined by soft X-ray angle resolved photoemission with control of the excitation light polarization.
