An Experimental and Computational Study", "comment": "13 pages, 5 figures", "summary": "Verdazyl radicals are a versatile class of air-stable organic radicals used in various applications, especially for their magnetic properties. Despite the development of a wide range of verdazyl derivatives, however, they are all non-emissive. To investigate the reasons behind this and to understand the excited-state dynamics of verdazyls, we combine steady-state and femtosecond pump-probe spectroscopy with quantum chemical calculations. In the carbazole-substituted 2,4,6-triphenylverdazyl (TPV-Cz) , we observe ultrafast internal conversion of the first excited state on a timescale of 0.5 $\\pm$ 0.1 ps, followed by vibrational relaxation with a lifetime of 3.7 $\\pm$ 0.4 ps. Spin-flip time-dependent density functional theory calculations reveal that the sub-picosecond non-radiative decay comes from a low-energy conical intersection between the D1 and D0 states, driven by an out-of-plane distortion of the verdazyl ring. This distortion is observed and remains energetically accessible in the isolated verdazyl ring in 2,4,6-triphenylverdazyl and in TPV-Cz. This shows that the conical intersection geometry is a recurring feature across different types of verdazyl derivatives and explains why all verdazyls are non-emissive despite different functionalization. Our results provide a mechanistic understanding of the photophysical properties of verdazyl radicals and offers a pathway for the future design of emissive verdazyl derivatives."}

Integrating this reweighting framework into the CP2K electronic-structure and molecular-dynamics (MD) software package delivers a robust and widely applicable tool for metadynamics, uncertainty quantification, and force-field optimisation based on both \\textit{ab initio} and classical MD simulations. Based on the Girsanov theorem for stochastic dynamical systems, the method is adapted to the Bussi-Donadio-Parrinello velocity-rescaling scheme. This scheme is accessible through the CSVR thermostat and can be interpreted as a Langevin OVRVO/OBABO update scheme requiring two random numbers per integration step. Comprehensive implementation details are provided, including a complete overview of the modified CP2K modules involved in the MD cycle and the computation of reweighting factors. The framework supports multiple sources of bias potentials, enabling reweighting via the PLUMED interface or CP2K-native external potentials and restraints. The feasibility of the implementation is demonstrated through rerun benchmarks, dynamical reweighting of Markov state models (MSMs) and computation of transport properties based on CP2K trajectories, showing excellent agreement with reference simulations."}

We observe oxygen segregation at grain boundaries (GBs) relative to the oxygen concentration within the grains for both Nb and Ta-capped Nb thin films for superconducting qubits and find that higher oxygen concentration in the interior of Nb grains lead to greater oxygen segregation levels at GBs. This finding emphasizes that controlling oxygen impurities in Nb during film deposition and fabrication processing is important to reduce the level of oxygen segregation at GBs in Nb. The enrichment factor (Cgb/Cgrain) for oxygen segregation at GBs in Nb is 2.7 (error bar: 0.3) for Nb films, and Ta-capped Nb thin films exhibit slightly reduced Nb GB enrichment factors of 2.3 (error bar: 0.3) while GBs in the Ta capping layer itself possess higher enrichment factors of 3.0 (error bar: 0.3). We hypothesize that the Ta capping layer can trap oxygen and thereby affect oxygen in-diffusion and segregation at GBs in the underlying Nb thin films. Finally, we find that increases in the oxygen concentration in both Nb grains and GBs correlate with a suppression in the critical temperature for superconductivity (Tc). Together, our comparative chemical and charge transport property analyses provide atomic-scale insights into a potential mechanism contributing to decoherence in superconducting qubits."}

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) provides a unique, non-destructive means to probe these properties through species-selective measurements of self-diffusion coefficients. While pulsed field gradient NMR (PFG-NMR) is routinely used, its access to diffusion times is typically limited to values no shorter than about 10 ms, restricting its applicability to systems with fast dynamics and long relaxation times. Diffusion NMR in a permanent magnetic field gradient (STRAFI) offers a complementary, multiscale approach, enabling diffusion measurements over an extended temporal window, from a few hundred microseconds to several tens of seconds. Despite its strong potential, this technique remains rarely implemented due to experimental and methodological challenges. In this work, we present a robust and versatile STRAFI-based methodology, including a specifically designed experimental setup, optimized pulse sequences, and rigorous data analysis, allowing accurate extraction of self-diffusion coefficients for a broad range of nuclei. The capabilities of the approach are illustrated through diverse applications, including the study of concentrated electrolytes using \"NMR-exotic\" nuclei ($^{35}$Cl, $^{79}$Br/$^{81}$Br, $^{127}$I, $^{17}$O) and the characterization of micrometre-scale porosity in membranes."}

The stress component normal to (111) plane can strongly affect the SF energy when the stress magnitude reaches several to tens of GPa. We conduct a series of DFT calculations of SF energies in six FCC metals: Al, Ni, Cu, Ag, Au, and Pt. The results show that normal compression significantly increases the stable and unstable SF energies in all six metals, while normal tension decreases them. The SF formation is accompanied by inelastic expansion in the normal direction. The DFT calculations are compared with predictions of several representative classical and machine-learning interatomic potentials. Many potentials fail to capture the correct stress effect on the SF energy, often predicting trends opposite to the DFT calculations. Possible ways to improve the ability of potentials to represent the stress effect on SF energy are discussed."}

By comparing networks that include all weathervane loops with networks restricted to elementary six-spin loops, we examine how energetic constraints shape phase-space structure. We find that connectivity distributions are sharply peaked in large systems, while restrictions to short loops reduce typical connectivity. Spectral properties further distinguish the two cases, with short-loop networks exhibiting Gaussian spectra and full networks displaying non-Gaussian features associated with correlated loop updates.

We address these questions by combining reverse DNP and band-selective inversion pulses on nuclear spins. We report the electron-detected NMR spectrum of proton spins involved in the direct DNP process in Ox063 trityl samples with protonated and deuterated solvents and variable radical concentrations. We also determine the spin-diffusion barrier surrounding trityl and find that proton spin diffusion is quenched for hyperfine coulings exceding ~250 kHz. This corresponds to a radius of the spin diffusion barrier in the range from 5.4 to 6.8 Å. Burning a hole into the NMR spectrum of proton spins involved in the direct DNP step reveals an electron-electron spin diffusion process imprinted on the proton spectrum.

Here we use first-principles spin-lattice dynamics simulations to investigate the coupled evolution of magnetization and phonon dispersions across the magnetostructural transition in MnAs. Our simulations quantitatively reproduce the experimentally observed Curie temperature, lattice contraction, and free-energy crossing between hexagonal and orthorhombic phases. We show that below the Curie temperature, magnetic-field-induced hardening of soft phonon modes gives rise to a sizable lattice entropy contribution that enhances the total isothermal entropy change by approximately 23% under a 5 T field. In contrast, the lattice entropy change associated with the structural phase transition itself has an opposite sign and partially compensates the lattice contribution due to field-induced phonon hardening. This competition reconciles long-standing discrepancies in the interpretation of magnetocaloric entropy measurements across first-order transitions. In addition, we demonstrate that the strong magnetic-field dependence of the phonon spectrum near the transition enables large tunability of lattice thermal conductivity, highlighting MnAs as a promising platform for magnetic-field-controlled thermal switching. Our results establish a unified microscopic picture of spin-lattice coupling in first-order magnetocaloric materials and provide design principles for engineering enhanced caloric and thermal transport functionalities."}

Here, we study thin CrSBr layers using time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy in an external magnetic field, revealing a step-like reduction in the exciton lifetime from 11 to 7 ps, during the magnetization flip from the antiferromagnetic to the ferromagnetic phase. The reduction of the exciton lifetime in the ferromagnetic phase persists below the Néel temperature, as evidenced by its strong magnetic-field dependence that disappears in the paramagnetic phase. Ab initio calculations reveal a one-dimensional nature of free excitons accompanied by a pronounced change in the oscillator strength across the magnetic phase transition predicting a shorter radiative lifetime of free excitons in the antiferromagnetic phase of CrSBr contradicting the experimental observations. This discrepancy is explained by strong localization of excitons at low tempature. We show both experimentally and theoretically that the observed magnetic switching of the exciton lifetime is attributed to a larger exciton localization volume leading to a larger oscillator strength in the ferromagnetic phase. The results show that disorder-induced localization effects play a key role in exciton dynamics in CrSBr."}

IP-AHE in these epitaxial trilayers unambiguously couples to the CaRuO3-buffer-induced mirror-symmetry breaking and faithfully reproduces the ferromagnetic hysteresis. Ionic liquid gating further enables reversible reconfigurations of the symmetry breaking, thereby achieving electrical modulation and ON/OFF switching of IP-AHE. This highly tunable IP-AHE platform opens pathways for exploring nontrivial magnetic order and developing programmable Hall functionalities in planar geometries."}

Their high computational cost, however, has motivated extensive efforts to develop accelerated alternatives. A promising approach is the use of machine-learning-based simulators that allow for substantially larger time steps than conventional MD. Among these, graph neural network (GNN)-based methods have been found to be especially attractive given that they naturally encode the inductive bias of interacting particle systems, however current architectures remain limited in accuracy and stability. In particular, standard message-passing schemes struggle to efficiently propagate long-range information. Here, we investigate whether spectral-GNN simulators can overcome these limitations by explicitly representing a simulated system in a global eigenmode basis, and therefore better capture long-range and collective behavior. Focusing on disordered elastic networks, model systems for complex materials and biological structures such as proteins, we compare spatial, linear spectral, and nonlinear spectral GNN architectures. We find that while spectral representations alone are not sufficient, nonlinear spectral models substantially outperform alternatives. By learning both the time-dependent dynamics and the mixing of eigenmodes, these models more accurately capture the system's slow, global modes, which dominate macroscopic behavior. This leads to a marked reduction in systematic particle-position error and significantly improved prediction of global physical properties."}

These devices employ a broadband infrared emitter, thermopile detector, and a spectrally selective bandpass filter tuned to the vibrational resonance of the target analyte. However, the fabrication of these filters is costly and limited to a single frequency. This limitation introduces a fundamental tradeoff, as broadening the optical passband width enhances sensitivity but compromises selectivity, whereas narrowing improves selectivity at the expense of sensitivity. In this work, we validate a filterless NDIR approach using a multi-peak thermal emitter developed through inverse design. This emitter enhances detection sensitivity by targeting multiple absorption bands, demonstrated through the creation of a sensor designed for the C-H vibrational modes of propane. Additionally, a set of single-peak emitters were developed to showcase the capability of designing highly selective sensors operating within close spectral proximity. These emitters, targeting the stretching modes of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, exhibit Q-factors above 50 and minimal crosstalk, enabling accurate detection of the target gas without interference from gases with spectrally adjacent absorption bands. This is enabled by the implementation of an aperiodic distributed Bragg reflectors, which allows for higher Q-factors with fewer layers than a periodic Bragg reflector using the same materials and number of layers, thereby reducing fabrication complexity and cost. Experimental results validate that this approach breaks the tradeoff between sensitivity and selectivity. This work highlights the potential of optimized thermal emitters for more efficient and compact gas sensing applications."}

We study the relaxation dynamics of the three-dimensional (3D) classical $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory (LGT) as a canonical example. We prove a lower bound on the mixing time in the deconfined phase, $t_{\\text{mix}} = \\exp [Ω(L)]$, where L is the linear system size. This bound applies even in the presence of perturbations that explicitly break the one-form symmetry between different long-lived states. This perturbation destroys the energy barriers between ordered states, but we show that entropic effects nevertheless lead to diverging free-energy barriers at nonzero temperature. Our proof establishes the LGT as a robust finite-temperature classical memory. We further prove that entropic effects lead to an emergent one-form symmetry, via a notion that we make precise. We argue that the exponential mixing time follows from universal properties of the deconfined phase, and numerically corroborate this expectation by exploring mixing time scales at the Higgs and confinement transitions out of the deconfined phase. These transitions are found to exhibit markedly different dynamic scaling, even though both have the static critical exponents of the 3D Ising model. We expect this novel entropic mechanism for memory and emergent symmetry to also bring insight into self-correcting quantum memories."}

Using polarization and femtosecond time-resolved Resonance Enhanced Multi-photon Ionization Spectroscopy with a nanosecond delay window, we disentangle this long-standing inconsistency and show that the early 2-5 ps decay component arises entirely from rotational dephasing of an excited-state wavepacket. Identical time constants extracted from the decay of the parallel signal and rise of the perpendicular signal across multiple vibronic origins provide an unambiguous rotational anisotropy signature, eliminating the need for IVR-based interpretations. Extending the measurement window to 1.3 ns reveals well-structured J-type and C-type rotational coherence revivals in S2 azulene on top of the well-documented fluorescence decay, demonstrating that both the short- and long-time dynamics contain information about the coherent rotational dynamics. These results show that azulene, and by extension polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), can sustain structured rotational coherence deep into the nanosecond regime, positioning PAHs as model systems for quantum-coherent wavepacket dynamics and providing a framework for probing coherence, decoherence, and rotational control in electronically rich molecular systems."}

Here, through rigorous first-principles calculations, we uncover a phonon-dominated thermal transport regime in the Weyl semimetals TaAs and TaP. Remarkably, although TaP is metallic, its phonon thermal conductivity ($κ_{\\text{ph}}$) reaches as high as 171 Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ at room temperature, surpassing its electronic counterpart by more than a factor of five. This anomalously high $κ_{\\text{ph}}$ is enabled by the unique electronic and phononic band structures, characterized by the Weyl nodes near the Fermi level, together with acoustic phonon bunching and a wide frequency gap in the phonon spectrum, which collectively suppress phonon-electron and phonon-phonon scattering processes. Due to the substantial phonon contribution, the derived Lorenz number deviates strongly from the conventional Wiedemann-Franz law. We further show that the significance of phonon thermal transport is universal across topological semimetals. Our work provides deeper insight into thermal transport mechanisms in topological semimetals and extends the scope for discovering materials with high thermal conductivity."}

In real materials, this problem has been extensively studied in transition metal compounds, where various quantum phenomena arise from the spin and orbital degeneracy of the d electrons on individual transition-metal atoms. In contrast, materials containing high-symmetry clusters composed of multiple transition-metal atoms are expected to exhibit more emergent phenomena due to the entanglement of the electronic degrees of freedom across multiple atoms. Here, we report the discovery of two distinct mechanisms of orbital-degeneracy lifting in NbSeI, which comprises Nb4 tetrahedral clusters with molecular orbital degrees of freedom and whose average crystal structure is predicted to host a flat-band metal. Below 106 K, NbSeI is found to be a nonmagnetic molecular orbital-ordered insulator. Above this temperature, the average structure becomes face-centered cubic without any superlattice, while the orbital degeneracy remains lifted by significant local distortions of Nb4 tetrahedra, which may be associated with a molecular orbital-liquid or orbital-frozen state. This noncooperative Jahn-Teller distortion stabilizes a nonmagnetic insulating state above 106 K, in stark contrast to the flat-band metal predicted from the average structure."}

We observe oxygen segregation at grain boundaries (GBs) relative to the oxygen concentration within the grains for both Nb and Ta-capped Nb thin films for superconducting qubits and find that higher oxygen concentration in the interior of Nb grains lead to greater oxygen segregation levels at GBs. This finding emphasizes that controlling oxygen impurities in Nb during film deposition and fabrication processing is important to reduce the level of oxygen segregation at GBs in Nb. The enrichment factor (Cgb/Cgrain) for oxygen segregation at GBs in Nb is 2.7 (error bar: 0.3) for Nb films, and Ta-capped Nb thin films exhibit slightly reduced Nb GB enrichment factors of 2.3 (error bar: 0.3) while GBs in the Ta capping layer itself possess higher enrichment factors of 3.0 (error bar: 0.3).

Predicting the ability of a substrate to induce the nucleation of ice from supercooled water is a difficult problem. Here, we use molecular simulations to analyse how the ice nucleating ability is affected by the substrate lattice structure and orientation. We focus on different model lattices: simple cubic, body centred cubic and face centred cubic, and assess their ability to induce ice nucleation by calculating nucleation rates. Several orientations are studied for the case of the face centred cubic lattice. Curiously, a hexagonal symmetry does not guarantee a better ice nucleating ability. By comparing the body centred cubic and the cubic lattices we determined that there is a significant role of the underlying crystal plane(s) on ice nucleation. The structure of the liquid layer adjacent to the substrate reveals that more efficient nucleants induce a more structured liquid. The most efficient substrates present a strong sensitivity of their ice nucleating ability to the lattice parameters. Introducing a novel methodological approach, we use Classical Nucleation Theory to estimate the contact angle of the ice nucleus on the studied substrates from the calculated nucleation rates. The method also provides the nucleation free energy barrier height, the kinetic pre-factor and the critical cluster size. The latter is in agreement with the nucleus size obtained through a microscopic analysis of the nucleation trajectories, which supports the validity of Classical Nucleation Theory down to small critical clusters."}

Here we develop an autonomous scanning probe microscopy (SPM) framework that integrates automated atomic force and magnetic force microscopy (AFM/MFM) to rapidly explore magnetic and structural properties across combinatorial spread libraries. To enable automated exploration of systems without a clear optimization target, we introduce a combination of a static physics-informed bag-of-features (BoF) representation of measured surface morphology and magnetic structure with multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) to discover the relative significance and robustness of features. The resulting closed-loop workflow selectively samples the compositional gradient and reconstructs feature landscapes consistent with dense grid \"ground truth\" measurements. The resulting Pareto structure reveals where multiple nanoscale objectives are simultaneously optimized, where trade-offs between roughness, coherence, and magnetic contrast are unavoidable, and how families of compositions cluster into distinct functional regimes, thereby turning multi-feature imaging data into interpretable maps of competing structure-property trends. While demonstrated for Au-Co-Ni and AFM/MFM, the approach is general and can be extended to other combinatorial systems, imaging modalities, and feature sets, illustrating how feature-based MOBO and autonomous SPM can transform microscopy images from static data products into active feedback for real-time, multi-objective materials discovery."}

In contrast, at room temperature in the normal phase, an anomalous decrease of the Yb $4f$ valence is observed, without any accompanying structural phase transition. This behavior is corroborated by a systematic pressure dependent decrease of the unit-cell volume. Based on a Birch-Murnaghan analysis, the compressibility indicates hardening of the lattice with applied pressure up to a distinct kink seen at P$_K$ = 1.5 GPa.

In addition to its unique recursive structure, the Hofstadter butterfly is intimately linked to non-trivial topological orders, hosting a cascade of ground states characterized by non-zero topological invariants. These states, called Chern insulators, are usually understood as replicas of the ground states of the quantum Hall effect, with electrical and thermal conductances that should be quantized, reflecting their topological order. The Hofstadter butterfly is now commonly observed in van-der-Waals heterostructures-based moiré superlattices. However, its thermal properties, particularly the quantized heat flow expected in the Chern insulators, have not been investigated, potentially questioning their similarity with standard quantum Hall states. Here we probe the heat transport properties of the Hofstadter butterfly, obtained in a graphene~/~hexagonal boron nitride moiré superlattice. We observe a quantized heat flow, uniquely set by the topological invariant, for all investigated states of the Hofstadter butterfly: quantum Hall states, Chern insulators, and even symmetry-broken Chern insulators emerging from strong electronic interactions. Our work firmly establishes the universality of the quantization of heat transport and its intimate link with topology."}

However, distinguishing the roles of Kitaev interactions and the symmetry-allowed Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) remains challenging, since both mechanisms may lead to similar magnetic excitations and thermal transport properties. To tackle this challenge, using a ferromagnetic honeycomb insulator VI3 as a model system, we systematically study the angular-dependent thermal Hall conductivity Kxy(θ, Φ) with both out-of-plane (θ) and in-plane (Φ) magnetic field rotations. Our results reveal a persistent thermal Hall response for both out-of-plane and in-plane rotating magnetic fields, devoid of the sign-reversal patterns characteristic of Kitaev physics. Instead, quantitative analysis shows that the angular dependent Kxy(θ, Φ) is governed by the projection between the magnetic moment and a tilted DM vector containing both out-of-plane and in-plane components. These results not only establish the DMI-driven topological magnetic excitations as the origin of the thermal Hall response in VI3 but also highlight the angular-dependent thermal Hall effect measurements as an effective approach for distinguishing competing interactions in quantum magnets."}

Here, we study thin CrSBr layers using time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy in an external magnetic field, revealing a step-like reduction in the exciton lifetime from 11 to 7 ps, during the magnetization flip from the antiferromagnetic to the ferromagnetic phase. The reduction of the exciton lifetime in the ferromagnetic phase persists below the Néel temperature, as evidenced by its strong magnetic-field dependence that disappears in the paramagnetic phase. Ab initio calculations reveal a one-dimensional nature of free excitons accompanied by a pronounced change in the oscillator strength across the magnetic phase transition predicting a shorter radiative lifetime of free excitons in the antiferromagnetic phase of CrSBr contradicting the experimental observations. This discrepancy is explained by strong localization of excitons at low tempature. We show both experimentally and theoretically that the observed magnetic switching of the exciton lifetime is attributed to a larger exciton localization volume leading to a larger oscillator strength in the ferromagnetic phase. The results show that disorder-induced localization effects play a key role in exciton dynamics in CrSBr."}

Unlike conventional multiferroics relying on direct magnetoelectric coupling, multiferroic altermagnets host a crystal-symmetry-mediated magnetoelectric interaction that is intrinsically more efficient and robust. Among candidate material platforms, layered perovskites are particularly appealing owing to their structural diversity and synthetic versatility. However, magnetoelectric properties at the two-dimensional scale remain largely unexplored, hindering their applicability in miniaturized, highly integrated devices. Here, we systematically investigate the dimensional evolution of ferroelectric polarization and magnetism in perovskite systems through symmetry analysis. We demonstrate that altermagnetism can persist in the two-dimensional limit, yet is strongly constrained by the magnetic configuration-with only C-type antiferromagnetic order supporting it. Based on mode-decomposition calculations, we further reveal that symmetry-restricted multimode couplings simultaneously govern ferroelectric polarization and altermagnetic spin splitting. Finally, combined with first-principles calculations, we propose several strategies to lift the magnetic-configuration constraint, extending the range of viable altermagnetic systems. These results underscore the critical role of dimensionality in symmetry-driven magnetoelectric coupling in perovskite altermagnets and pave the way toward next-generation electrically controlled spintronic and multiferroic devices."}

These devices employ a broadband infrared emitter, thermopile detector, and a spectrally selective bandpass filter tuned to the vibrational resonance of the target analyte. However, the fabrication of these filters is costly and limited to a single frequency. This limitation introduces a fundamental tradeoff, as broadening the optical passband width enhances sensitivity but compromises selectivity, whereas narrowing improves selectivity at the expense of sensitivity. In this work, we validate a filterless NDIR approach using a multi-peak thermal emitter developed through inverse design. This emitter enhances detection sensitivity by targeting multiple absorption bands, demonstrated through the creation of a sensor designed for the C-H vibrational modes of propane. Additionally, a set of single-peak emitters were developed to showcase the capability of designing highly selective sensors operating within close spectral proximity. These emitters, targeting the stretching modes of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, exhibit Q-factors above 50 and minimal crosstalk, enabling accurate detection of the target gas without interference from gases with spectrally adjacent absorption bands. This is enabled by the implementation of an aperiodic distributed Bragg reflectors, which allows for higher Q-factors with fewer layers than a periodic Bragg reflector using the same materials and number of layers, thereby reducing fabrication complexity and cost. Experimental results validate that this approach breaks the tradeoff between sensitivity and selectivity. This work highlights the potential of optimized thermal emitters for more efficient and compact gas sensing applications."}

By engineering physically balanced gain and loss following a Fibonacci sequence, we realize two distinct geometrical configurations in which the ring either preserve or explicitly break PT symmetry, and further explore complementary realizations obtained by reversing the signs of the on site potentials. Using the non equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism, we analyze transmission properties and bond current densities to quantify both transport and circulating currents. A comparison with the Hermitian limit establishes a clear baseline, where the ring supports only weak responses upon introducing disorder. In sharp contrast, non-Hermiticity leads to a pronounced amplification of transport and circular currents, and hence of the induced magnetic field. We further demonstrate that non-Hermitian transport is highly sensitive to gain and loss sign reversal and, in the non-PT-symmetric case, exhibits an unconventional dependence on system size governed by the parity of the Fibonacci sequence and hopping correlations. Remarkably, the current does not decay monotonically with increasing system size, revealing a distinct scaling behavior absent in conventional Hermitian systems. Our results highlight non-Hermitian quasiperiodic rings as versatile platforms for engineering and amplifying current driven magnetic responses through symmetry, topology, and gain-loss design."}

We conduct a series of DFT calculations of SF energies in six FCC metals: Al, Ni, Cu, Ag, Au, and Pt. The results show that normal compression significantly increases the stable and unstable SF energies in all six metals, while normal tension decreases them. The SF formation is accompanied by inelastic expansion in the normal direction. The DFT calculations are compared with predictions of several representative classical and machine-learning interatomic potentials. Many potentials fail to capture the correct stress effect on the SF energy, often predicting trends opposite to the DFT calculations.

This twist angle dependence directly impacts the exciton-phonon coupling, which plays a significant role for the optical properties of these materials. In this work we theoretically investigate the twist angle dependent influence of phonons on absorption spectra of intralayer moiré excitons in a twisted TMDC hetero-bilayer. For the lowest-lying intralayer moiré exciton we find that the exciton-phonon coupling interpolates between two physically distinct regimes when tuning the twist angle. At small twist angles non-Markovian polarization dynamics and phonon sidebands dominate the properties of absorption spectra for localized excitons. For larger twist angles Markovian processes become more important leading to additional line broadening. Furthermore, the absorption spectra here show a characteristic asymmetric peak similar to monolayer TMDCs. When taking into account multiple bright moiré exciton bands we find that intraband scattering due to optical phonons has a significant impact on absorption spectra, effectively suppressing absorption peaks of higher lying bands when their bandwidth surpasses the optical phonon energy."}

At low electron densities, the system enters a Wigner regime characterized by dominant 4kF correlations; increasing the electron density leads to a crossover from the Wigner regime to a Friedel regime with dominant 2kF correlations. We support these results through large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations of the interacting ground state under both screened and unscreened Coulomb potentials. We propose experimental signatures of the Wigner-Friedel crossover via charge transport and charge sensing in both zero- and high-magnetic field limits. We also analyze the impact of short-range correlated disorder - including random alloy fluctuations and valley splitting variations - and identify that the Wigner-Friedel crossover remains robust until disorder levels of about 400 micro eV. Finally, we show that the Wigner regime enables long-range capacitive coupling between quantum dots across the interconnect, suggesting a route to create long-range entanglement between solid-state qubits.

Our simulations quantitatively reproduce the experimentally observed Curie temperature, lattice contraction, and free-energy crossing between hexagonal and orthorhombic phases. We show that below the Curie temperature, magnetic-field-induced hardening of soft phonon modes gives rise to a sizable lattice entropy contribution that enhances the total isothermal entropy change by approximately 23% under a 5 T field. In contrast, the lattice entropy change associated with the structural phase transition itself has an opposite sign and partially compensates the lattice contribution due to field-induced phonon hardening. This competition reconciles long-standing discrepancies in the interpretation of magnetocaloric entropy measurements across first-order transitions. In addition, we demonstrate that the strong magnetic-field dependence of the phonon spectrum near the transition enables large tunability of lattice thermal conductivity, highlighting MnAs as a promising platform for magnetic-field-controlled thermal switching.

The resulting linear-response theory yields strictly quadratic error scaling of Fermi-level shifts across representative platinum surfaces, achieving sub-meV accuracy up to fields of 0.1 V/Å.

This approach allows us to rotate the magnetization rank by rank and quantify how each multipole affects the conductivity. Applying this framework to body-centered cubic iron, we find that high-rank magnetic and magnetic toroidal multipoles contribute with magnitudes comparable to magnetic dipoles, while magnetic toroidal 16-poles act with the opposite sign. Furthermore, based on this multipole analysis, we apply uniaxial strain along the [103] direction to control the dominant multipoles contributing to the conductivity.

Additionally, the spin Hall angle can be tuned via an applied gate voltage, offering high controllability of the system. Importantly, these properties are observed across heterostructures composed of different HMs, indicating the generality of this approach. Our findings establish Gr/HM heterostructures as a scalable and versatile platform for spin current generation, paving the way for advanced spintronic devices with high efficiency, long spin propagation, and straightforward fabrication processes."}

The hierarchical orthogonal corrugated morphologies are directly revealed and attributed to its chain-orientation-determined twinning-domain effect. Both Fe-chains of middle-sublayer and two kinds of Te atoms of top-sublayer are further atomically resolved at the sub-Å level, indicating the critical effects of Pd-atoms/voids on the intra-layer anisotropic Fe-chains and the interlayer structural alignment. The thermal-induced and strain-related structural transitions of surface layer are further investigated and discussed based on the proposed filling model of Pd-voids by the intralayer Pd-atoms.

While previous studies have focused on their groundstate properties (at 0 K), limited information exists on their mechanical behavior under realistic operational conditions involving elevated temperatures and the presence of defects. In this study, we employ ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations to investigate the effects of temperature (300 to 1500 K) and anionic vacancies on the mechanical properties of NbC and NbN in rocksalt (RS), zincblende (ZB), and wurtzite (WZ) structures. The results reveal a nonlinear decrease in elastic constants, bulk, shear, and Youngs moduli with both increasing temperature and defect concentration. Hardness and toughness analyses, based on Pughs ratio and Poisson ratio, show ductility and brittleness transitions that are sensitive to structure, defect level, and thermal effects. Furthermore, vacancy migration energies computed using the nudged elastic band (NEB) method demonstrate strong structural dependence, with RS exhibiting the highest barriers and WZ the lowest. These findings provide new insights into the defect and temperature interplay in NbC and NbN, offering guidelines for their optimization in high-temperature and wear-resistant applications."}

We demonstrate that the BCD's evolution with strain and doping is highly sensitive to the choice in parameterization, particularly when including the longer range interlayer skew hoppings.

Here, through rigorous first-principles calculations, we uncover a phonon-dominated thermal transport regime in the Weyl semimetals TaAs and TaP. Remarkably, although TaP is metallic, its phonon thermal conductivity ($κ_{\\text{ph}}$) reaches as high as 171 Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ at room temperature, surpassing its electronic counterpart by more than a factor of five. This anomalously high $κ_{\\text{ph}}$ is enabled by the unique electronic and phononic band structures, characterized by the Weyl nodes near the Fermi level, together with acoustic phonon bunching and a wide frequency gap in the phonon spectrum, which collectively suppress phonon-electron and phonon-phonon scattering processes. Due to the substantial phonon contribution, the derived Lorenz number deviates strongly from the conventional Wiedemann-Franz law. We further show that the significance of phonon thermal transport is universal across topological semimetals.

A mode-resolved analysis reveals how propagating and evanescent channels couple across electrostatic interfaces and how channel selectivity governs transport at normal incidence.

This effect is interpreted as a ghost quantum well, namely an effective cavity formed by internal phase coherence inside the barrier, without true bound states and without restoring coupling to decoupled channels. For single- and double-barrier geometries, we derive compact analytical expressions for the transmission and identify the corresponding resonance conditions. Extending the analysis to multibarrier structures using a transfer-matrix approach, we demonstrate how perfect resonances driven by internal phase matching coexist with Fabry-Perot-like resonances arising from inter-barrier interference. Our results provide a unified, channel-resolved description of tunnelling suppression and resonance-assisted transport in bilayer graphene barrier systems."}

Here we develop an autonomous scanning probe microscopy (SPM) framework that integrates automated atomic force and magnetic force microscopy (AFM/MFM) to rapidly explore magnetic and structural properties across combinatorial spread libraries. To enable automated exploration of systems without a clear optimization target, we introduce a combination of a static physics-informed bag-of-features (BoF) representation of measured surface morphology and magnetic structure with multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) to discover the relative significance and robustness of features. The resulting closed-loop workflow selectively samples the compositional gradient and reconstructs feature landscapes consistent with dense grid \"ground truth\" measurements. The resulting Pareto structure reveals where multiple nanoscale objectives are simultaneously optimized, where trade-offs between roughness, coherence, and magnetic contrast are unavoidable, and how families of compositions cluster into distinct functional regimes, thereby turning multi-feature imaging data into interpretable maps of competing structure-property trends. While demonstrated for Au-Co-Ni and AFM/MFM, the approach is general and can be extended to other combinatorial systems, imaging modalities, and feature sets, illustrating how feature-based MOBO and autonomous SPM can transform microscopy images from static data products into active feedback for real-time, multi-objective materials discovery."}

Here, using a BiFeO3 (BFO)-based multiferroic superlattice as a model system, we demonstrate a thermal-modulation strategy that stabilizes multi-order polar skyrmions and enables reversible tuning of their topological order through phase-field simulations. It was found that temperature modulation drives the system from polar solitons through 1π-, 2π-, 3π-, and 4π-skyrmion states, with closed heating-cooling path analyses revealing the widest thermal stability window for 2π-skyrmions (up to 600 K).

In contrast, materials containing high-symmetry clusters composed of multiple transition-metal atoms are expected to exhibit more emergent phenomena due to the entanglement of the electronic degrees of freedom across multiple atoms. Here, we report the discovery of two distinct mechanisms of orbital-degeneracy lifting in NbSeI, which comprises Nb4 tetrahedral clusters with molecular orbital degrees of freedom and whose average crystal structure is predicted to host a flat-band metal. Below 106 K, NbSeI is found to be a nonmagnetic molecular orbital-ordered insulator. Above this temperature, the average structure becomes face-centered cubic without any superlattice, while the orbital degeneracy remains lifted by significant local distortions of Nb4 tetrahedra, which may be associated with a molecular orbital-liquid or orbital-frozen state. This noncooperative Jahn-Teller distortion stabilizes a nonmagnetic insulating state above 106 K, in stark contrast to the flat-band metal predicted from the average structure."}

Magnon torques are stronger when the Neel vector of Cr2O3 aligns parallel to the spin polarization generated in Hf, while they are suppressed when the Neel vector is perpendicular to the spin polarization.

Here, we systematically investigate the dimensional evolution of ferroelectric polarization and magnetism in perovskite systems through symmetry analysis. We demonstrate that altermagnetism can persist in the two-dimensional limit, yet is strongly constrained by the magnetic configuration-with only C-type antiferromagnetic order supporting it. Based on mode-decomposition calculations, we further reveal that symmetry-restricted multimode couplings simultaneously govern ferroelectric polarization and altermagnetic spin splitting. Finally, combined with first-principles calculations, we propose several strategies to lift the magnetic-configuration constraint, extending the range of viable altermagnetic systems. These results underscore the critical role of dimensionality in symmetry-driven magnetoelectric coupling in perovskite altermagnets and pave the way toward next-generation electrically controlled spintronic and multiferroic devices."}

Predicting the ability of a substrate to induce the nucleation of ice from supercooled water is a difficult problem. Here, we use molecular simulations to analyse how the ice nucleating ability is affected by the substrate lattice structure and orientation. We focus on different model lattices: simple cubic, body centred cubic and face centred cubic, and assess their ability to induce ice nucleation by calculating nucleation rates. Several orientations are studied for the case of the face centred cubic lattice. Curiously, a hexagonal symmetry does not guarantee a better ice nucleating ability. By comparing the body centred cubic and the cubic lattices we determined that there is a significant role of the underlying crystal plane(s) on ice nucleation. The structure of the liquid layer adjacent to the substrate reveals that more efficient nucleants induce a more structured liquid. The most efficient substrates present a strong sensitivity of their ice nucleating ability to the lattice parameters. Introducing a novel methodological approach, we use Classical Nucleation Theory to estimate the contact angle of the ice nucleus on the studied substrates from the calculated nucleation rates. The method also provides the nucleation free energy barrier height, the kinetic pre-factor and the critical cluster size. The latter is in agreement with the nucleus size obtained through a microscopic analysis of the nucleation trajectories, which supports the validity of Classical Nucleation Theory down to small critical clusters."}

The resulting linear-response theory yields strictly quadratic error scaling of Fermi-level shifts across representative platinum surfaces, achieving sub-meV accuracy up to fields of 0.1 V/Å. The approach is further validated by reproducing work-function changes under molecular perturbations, and by providing mean-field estimates of electrode potentials that yield capacitance--voltage curves consistent with experiment.

Here, using a BiFeO3 (BFO)-based multiferroic superlattice as a model system, we demonstrate a thermal-modulation strategy that stabilizes multi-order polar skyrmions and enables reversible tuning of their topological order through phase-field simulations. It was found that temperature modulation drives the system from polar solitons through 1π-, 2π-, 3π-, and 4π-skyrmion states, with closed heating-cooling path analyses revealing the widest thermal stability window for 2π-skyrmions (up to 600 K). Leveraging this robustness, 2% Sm doping in BFO lowers the transition temperatures, enabling room-temperature stabilization of 2π-skyrmions. These findings enrich the fundamental understanding of multi-order polar topologies and establish a tunable strategy for realizing variable-order topological configurations in practical memory devices."}

While it is observed in both Weyl semimetals and elemental ferromagnets, the microscopic role of higher-order multipoles remains unclear. Here, we develop a microscopic framework that combines time-reversal-symmetric Wannier functions with a symmetry-adapted multipole basis to decompose the first-principles Wannier Hamiltonian into electric, magnetic, magnetic toroidal, and electric toroidal multipoles. This approach allows us to rotate the magnetization rank by rank and quantify how each multipole affects the conductivity. Applying this framework to body-centered cubic iron, we find that high-rank magnetic and magnetic toroidal multipoles contribute with magnitudes comparable to magnetic dipoles, while magnetic toroidal 16-poles act with the opposite sign. Furthermore, based on this multipole analysis, we apply uniaxial strain along the [103] direction to control the dominant multipoles contributing to the conductivity. The strain substantially modifies its angular dependence, demonstrating that multipole-resolved Hamiltonian engineering and magnetoelastic control serve as practical routes to predict and tune the in-plane anomalous Hall conductivity in simple ferromagnets."}

We observe oxygen segregation at grain boundaries (GBs) relative to the oxygen concentration within the grains for both Nb and Ta-capped Nb thin films for superconducting qubits and find that higher oxygen concentration in the interior of Nb grains lead to greater oxygen segregation levels at GBs. This finding emphasizes that controlling oxygen impurities in Nb during film deposition and fabrication processing is important to reduce the level of oxygen segregation at GBs in Nb. The enrichment factor (Cgb/Cgrain) for oxygen segregation at GBs in Nb is 2.7 (error bar: 0.3) for Nb films, and Ta-capped Nb thin films exhibit slightly reduced Nb GB enrichment factors of 2.3 (error bar: 0.3) while GBs in the Ta capping layer itself possess higher enrichment factors of 3.0 (error bar: 0.3). We hypothesize that the Ta capping layer can trap oxygen and thereby affect oxygen in-diffusion and segregation at GBs in the underlying Nb thin films. Finally, we find that increases in the oxygen concentration in both Nb grains and GBs correlate with a suppression in the critical temperature for superconductivity (Tc).

In this work, we observe magnon torques in the Cr/NiO/ferromagnet heterostructure with the effective spin Hall conductivity of 2.45x10^5 hbar/(2eΩm), twice that of the best conventional magnon torque system. We demonstrate the magnon-torque-driven switching of a perpendicularly magnetized CoFeB layer at room temperature, with a switching power consumption density of 0.136 mW/μm^2. We find that the magnon torque originates from the orbital hybridization and interfacial inversion symmetry breaking at the Cr/NiO interface. Our findings not only significantly enhance the efficiency of magnon torques, but also provide key insights into the fundamental mechanisms of magnon injections."}

In this study, we investigate the bio-resorbability of MTJ by analyzing the dissolution behavior of its nanometer-thick constituent layers in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution at pH 7.4, simulating physiological environments. The MTJ structures, composed of bio-resorbable materials, exhibit well-controlled degradation behaviors.

These findings highlight the potential of MTJs not only as high-performance memory elements but also as secure, transient data storage platforms.

The crystal Fe3Sn2 is a frustrated ferromagnet, while the crystallographically similar FeSn, which differs only by the stacking sequence of its Fe-containining kagome and stanene layers, is an antiferromagnet. Thin-film growth techniques such as magnetron sputtering allow for these different stoichiometric compositions to be grown through adjustments of the rate of deposition of the individual Fe and Sn sources, while all other conditions remain constant. Here, we report the production of high quality epitaxial thin films of Fe$_3$Sn$_2$ and FeSn on sapphire with a Pt seed layer, as well as a mixed phase containing intergrowths of both crystals, all of which we have characterized using both X-ray and four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) methods. The resulting crystallographic phase content is compared to the results of magnetization measurements, with correspondence between the predicted ferromagnetic phase content and the resulting magnetization. Further magnetic properties of these films can then also be compared, leading to the discovery of a unique behavior in the temperature dependent coercivity within highly mixed phase alloys, a feature that is absent in either pure Fe3Sn2 and FeSn."}

Magnon torques can potentially circumvent this issue, as it enables the transport of spin angular momentum in insulating magnetic materials. In this work, we fabricate a sandwich structure composed of Hf/antiferromagnetic Cr2O3/ferromagnet and demonstrate that the magnon torque is strongly dependent on the crystalline structure of Cr2O3. Magnon torques are stronger when the Neel vector of Cr2O3 aligns parallel to the spin polarization generated in Hf, while they are suppressed when the Neel vector is perpendicular to the spin polarization. The magnon torque efficiency is estimated to be -0.134 using in-plane second harmonic Hall measurements. Using magnon torques, we achieve perpendicular magnetization switching of CoFeB, with a critical switching current density of 4.09 x 10^7 A/cm^2. Furthermore, the spin angular momentum loss due to the insertion of Cr2O3 is found to be lower than that of polycrystalline NiO.

By engineering physically balanced gain and loss following a Fibonacci sequence, we realize two distinct geometrical configurations in which the ring either preserve or explicitly break PT symmetry, and further explore complementary realizations obtained by reversing the signs of the on site potentials. Using the non equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism, we analyze transmission properties and bond current densities to quantify both transport and circulating currents. A comparison with the Hermitian limit establishes a clear baseline, where the ring supports only weak responses upon introducing disorder. In sharp contrast, non-Hermiticity leads to a pronounced amplification of transport and circular currents, and hence of the induced magnetic field. We further demonstrate that non-Hermitian transport is highly sensitive to gain and loss sign reversal and, in the non-PT-symmetric case, exhibits an unconventional dependence on system size governed by the parity of the Fibonacci sequence and hopping correlations. Remarkably, the current does not decay monotonically with increasing system size, revealing a distinct scaling behavior absent in conventional Hermitian systems. Our results highlight non-Hermitian quasiperiodic rings as versatile platforms for engineering and amplifying current driven magnetic responses through symmetry, topology, and gain-loss design."}

This twist angle dependence directly impacts the exciton-phonon coupling, which plays a significant role for the optical properties of these materials. In this work we theoretically investigate the twist angle dependent influence of phonons on absorption spectra of intralayer moiré excitons in a twisted TMDC hetero-bilayer. For the lowest-lying intralayer moiré exciton we find that the exciton-phonon coupling interpolates between two physically distinct regimes when tuning the twist angle. At small twist angles non-Markovian polarization dynamics and phonon sidebands dominate the properties of absorption spectra for localized excitons. For larger twist angles Markovian processes become more important leading to additional line broadening. Furthermore, the absorption spectra here show a characteristic asymmetric peak similar to monolayer TMDCs. When taking into account multiple bright moiré exciton bands we find that intraband scattering due to optical phonons has a significant impact on absorption spectra, effectively suppressing absorption peaks of higher lying bands when their bandwidth surpasses the optical phonon energy."}

Predicting the ability of a substrate to induce the nucleation of ice from supercooled water is a difficult problem. Here, we use molecular simulations to analyse how the ice nucleating ability is affected by the substrate lattice structure and orientation. We focus on different model lattices: simple cubic, body centred cubic and face centred cubic, and assess their ability to induce ice nucleation by calculating nucleation rates. Several orientations are studied for the case of the face centred cubic lattice. Curiously, a hexagonal symmetry does not guarantee a better ice nucleating ability. By comparing the body centred cubic and the cubic lattices we determined that there is a significant role of the underlying crystal plane(s) on ice nucleation. The structure of the liquid layer adjacent to the substrate reveals that more efficient nucleants induce a more structured liquid. The most efficient substrates present a strong sensitivity of their ice nucleating ability to the lattice parameters. Introducing a novel methodological approach, we use Classical Nucleation Theory to estimate the contact angle of the ice nucleus on the studied substrates from the calculated nucleation rates. The method also provides the nucleation free energy barrier height, the kinetic pre-factor and the critical cluster size. The latter is in agreement with the nucleus size obtained through a microscopic analysis of the nucleation trajectories, which supports the validity of Classical Nucleation Theory down to small critical clusters."}

At a low temperature (T = 30 K) in the CO ordered phase, the Yb $4f$ valence remains nearly constant up to a pressure P$_K$ = 1.5 GPa, and then increases gradually at higher pressures. In contrast, at room temperature in the normal phase, an anomalous decrease of the Yb $4f$ valence is observed, without any accompanying structural phase transition. This behavior is corroborated by a systematic pressure dependent decrease of the unit-cell volume. Based on a Birch-Murnaghan analysis, the compressibility indicates hardening of the lattice with applied pressure up to a distinct kink seen at P$_K$ = 1.5 GPa. In contrast, for P $>$ P$_K$, the Yb $4f$ valency saturates and the compressibility reveals a counterintuitive pressure-induced softening.

However, distinguishing the roles of Kitaev interactions and the symmetry-allowed Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) remains challenging, since both mechanisms may lead to similar magnetic excitations and thermal transport properties. To tackle this challenge, using a ferromagnetic honeycomb insulator VI3 as a model system, we systematically study the angular-dependent thermal Hall conductivity Kxy(θ, Φ) with both out-of-plane (θ) and in-plane (Φ) magnetic field rotations. Our results reveal a persistent thermal Hall response for both out-of-plane and in-plane rotating magnetic fields, devoid of the sign-reversal patterns characteristic of Kitaev physics. Instead, quantitative analysis shows that the angular dependent Kxy(θ, Φ) is governed by the projection between the magnetic moment and a tilted DM vector containing both out-of-plane and in-plane components.

In the coplanar manifold, each configuration can be mapped to a three-coloring problem on the dual honeycomb lattice, where a weathervane mode corresponds to a closed loop of two alternating colors. By comparing networks that include all weathervane loops with networks restricted to elementary six-spin loops, we examine how energetic constraints shape phase-space structure. We find that connectivity distributions are sharply peaked in large systems, while restrictions to short loops reduce typical connectivity. Spectral properties further distinguish the two cases, with short-loop networks exhibiting Gaussian spectra and full networks displaying non-Gaussian features associated with correlated loop updates. Finally, a box-counting analysis reveals distinct fractal properties of the two networks, demonstrating how energetic constraints control the global geometry of configuration space. These results show that the hierarchy of weathervane loop rotations provides a direct link between microscopic constraints and emergent phase-space geometry in a frustrated magnet."}

Despite its widespread use, the reliability and effectiveness of AL workflows depend on implicit design assumptions that are rarely examined systematically. Here, we critically assess AL workflows deployed in materials science and investigate how key design choices, such as surrogate models, sampling strategies, uncertainty quantification and evaluation metrics, relate to their performance. By identifying common pitfalls and discussing practical mitigation strategies, we provide guidance to practitioners for the efficient design, assessment, and interpretation of AL workflows in materials science."}

While low-order topological states, such as vortices and skyrmions, have been extensively studied, high-order polar topological families remain largely unexplored due to their higher energy requirements and limited stabilization methods. Here, using a BiFeO3 (BFO)-based multiferroic superlattice as a model system, we demonstrate a thermal-modulation strategy that stabilizes multi-order polar skyrmions and enables reversible tuning of their topological order through phase-field simulations. It was found that temperature modulation drives the system from polar solitons through 1π-, 2π-, 3π-, and 4π-skyrmion states, with closed heating-cooling path analyses revealing the widest thermal stability window for 2π-skyrmions (up to 600 K). Leveraging this robustness, 2% Sm doping in BFO lowers the transition temperatures, enabling room-temperature stabilization of 2π-skyrmions. These findings enrich the fundamental understanding of multi-order polar topologies and establish a tunable strategy for realizing variable-order topological configurations in practical memory devices."}

We investigate this by using a tight-binding (TB) approach build on the Slater-Koster parameterization to capture lattice deformation effects often missed by continuum models. We demonstrate that the BCD's evolution with strain and doping is highly sensitive to the choice in parameterization, particularly when including the longer range interlayer skew hoppings. Additionally, out-of-plane compression enhances the response by broadening the Dirac cones. These findings benchmark low-energy continuum models and highlight the necessity of realistic tight-binding models for accurately predicting strain-engineered Hall effects in bilayer graphene."}

Comments are very welcome", "summary": "We study ballistic electron transport through electrostatic barriers in AB-stacked bilayer graphene within a full four-band framework. A mode-resolved analysis reveals how propagating and evanescent channels couple across electrostatic interfaces and how channel selectivity governs transport at normal incidence. We show that, even when decoupled channels remain inactive, perfect transmission can occur at discrete energies due to phase matching of a single internal mode within an individual barrier. This effect is interpreted as a ghost quantum well, namely an effective cavity formed by internal phase coherence inside the barrier, without true bound states and without restoring coupling to decoupled channels. For single- and double-barrier geometries, we derive compact analytical expressions for the transmission and identify the corresponding resonance conditions. Extending the analysis to multibarrier structures using a transfer-matrix approach, we demonstrate how perfect resonances driven by internal phase matching coexist with Fabry-Perot-like resonances arising from inter-barrier interference. Our results provide a unified, channel-resolved description of tunnelling suppression and resonance-assisted transport in bilayer graphene barrier systems."}

Applying this formalism to the mean particle density of a simple fluid, we identify a form reminiscent of dynamical density functional theory, with, however, fundamental differences: A nonlocal mobility kernel appears, and forces derive from a functional of the {\\it history} of mean density. The equilibrium density functional is shown to be recovered in the limit of slowly varying perturbation. We identify a freedom in deriving this expansion, which allows different forms of mobility kernels. These developments allow for a systematic improvement of established mean field formalisms."}

Here, we extend this correspondence to classical topological order, where the ordered states are locally indistinguishable, so there is no notion of interfaces between them. We study the relaxation dynamics of the three-dimensional (3D) classical $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory (LGT) as a canonical example. We prove a lower bound on the mixing time in the deconfined phase, $t_{\\text{mix}} = \\exp [Ω(L)]$, where L is the linear system size. This bound applies even in the presence of perturbations that explicitly break the one-form symmetry between different long-lived states. This perturbation destroys the energy barriers between ordered states, but we show that entropic effects nevertheless lead to diverging free-energy barriers at nonzero temperature. Our proof establishes the LGT as a robust finite-temperature classical memory. We further prove that entropic effects lead to an emergent one-form symmetry, via a notion that we make precise. We argue that the exponential mixing time follows from universal properties of the deconfined phase, and numerically corroborate this expectation by exploring mixing time scales at the Higgs and confinement transitions out of the deconfined phase. These transitions are found to exhibit markedly different dynamic scaling, even though both have the static critical exponents of the 3D Ising model. We expect this novel entropic mechanism for memory and emergent symmetry to also bring insight into self-correcting quantum memories."}
