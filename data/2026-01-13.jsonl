By explicitly treating the strong interlayer bonding of dz2 orbitals within a molecular orbital basis and projecting out high-energy electronic states, we derive a low-energy effective Kugel-Khomskii Hamiltonian describing the interplay between electron spin and emergent layer pseudospin degrees of freedom. We map out a rich ground state phase diagram featuring diverse spin and charge ordered states. These include conventional ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases with layer staggered charge densities, a layer-coherent phase characterized by spontaneous interlayer quantum coherence, and a novel maximally spin-layer-entangled phase with a hidden composite spin-layer order. We show that this exotic hidden ordered phase arises from the spontaneous breaking of an emergent O(4) symmetry down to a O(3), manifesting a unique excitation spectrum with three entangled gapless Goldstone modes. Our results uncover a geometrically driven mechanism for realizing composite entanglement in strongly correlated bilayer systems and provide a concrete theoretical framework relevant to bilayer nickelate superconductors and other multi-component correlated materials."}

Using numerically exact lattice Monte Carlo simulations, we investigate AM-like phases within the Ising-Kondo lattice model which is commonly employed to describe heavy-fermion materials. By incorporating an alternating next-nearest-neighbor hopping (NNNH) term, which arises from the influence of non-magnetic atoms in altermagnetic candidate materials, our results reveal key signatures of AM-like states, including spin-splitting quasiparticle bands and spectral functions, and demonstrate that d-wave AM remains stable across a broad range of interaction strengths, doping levels, NNNH amplitudes and temperatures, highlighting its robustness. Furthermore, through an analysis of non-magnetic impurity effects, we further confirm the d-wave symmetry of the AM phase. These findings establish a solid theoretical foundation for exploring AM-like phases in f-electron compounds, paving the way for future investigations into their exotic magnetic and electronic properties."}

The interaction between low-energy zero-modes (ZMs) not only contributes to frontier bands but can form the basis for magnetically ordered phases. Here, we present the bottom-up synthesis of a non-centrosymmetric GNR that places all ZMs on the majority sublattice sites. Scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy reveal that strong electron-electron correlation drives the system into a ferromagnetically ordered insulating ground state featuring a sizeable band gap of Eg ~ 1.2 eV. At higher temperatures, a chemical transformation induces an insulator-to-metal transition that quenches the ferro-magnetic order. Tight-binding (TB) and first-principles density functional theory calculations corroborate our experimental observations.

This situation necessitates the investigation of alternative signatures of AHCs. The gapless phonons of the emergent electronic lattice provide a clear distinction from conventional quantum Hall states, but it may be difficult to disentangle these phonons from the plethora of other possible low-lying modes. Intriguingly, the quantum geometry of the underlying electronic ground state can imprint on the collective modes, possibly leading the phonons themselves to be topological. Were this the case, the resulting neutral chiral edge modes would provide a further signature of an AHC. Using time-dependent Hartree-Fock, we compute the spectra of collective modes of Wigner crystals (WCs) and AHCs arising in minimal models and study the topology of the phonons and low-lying excitons. Across the WC to AHC transition, we observe a series of band inversions among collective modes, producing topological phonons and excitons, and a sharp sign change in the phonon Chern number upon entering the AHC phase. We conclude by discussing the relevance of collective mode topology to experiments on candidate systems for AHCs."}

Chasers and escapers move according to short-range sensing rules, while the density of obstacles tunes the connectivity of the accessible space. Using a combination of geometric analysis, dynamical observables, survival statistics, and transport characterization, we establish a direct link between lattice connectivity and pursuit efficiency. A Breadth-First Search analysis reveals that obstacle-induced fragmentation leads to a progressive loss of accessibility before the percolation threshold, defining the effective initial conditions for the dynamics. The trapping time and capture cost exhibit a non-monotonic dependence on obstacle density, reflecting a competition between path elongation in connected environments and geometric confinement near the percolation threshold. Survival analysis shows that the decay of the escaper population follows a Weibull form, with characteristic time and shape parameters displaying clear crossovers as a function of obstacle density, signaling the coexistence of cooperative capture and confinement-dominated trapping. Transport properties, quantified through the mean-squared displacement exponent, further support this picture, revealing sub-diffusive dynamics and a convergence toward a geometry-controlled regime near percolation. Overall, our results demonstrate that chase--and--escape dynamics in disordered environments are governed by a geometry-driven crossover, where percolation and connectivity act as unifying control parameters for spatial, temporal, and collective behavior."}

Electronic spectroscopy data are calculated by time-dependent density function theory and then compared with experimental results. Electronic couplings between exciton donor and acceptor are estimated based on both transition density cube method and transition dipole approximation. These results confirm that the delocalization of exciton to the bridge parts contribute to significant enhancement of donor-acceptor electronic coupling. Mechanistic details of exciton transfer are examined by estimating the contributions of the bridge electronic states, vibrational modes of the dyads commonly coupled to both donor and acceptor, inelastic resonance energy transfer mechanism, and dark exciton states.

First, the Lindblad embedding is exact when the daughter kernel is interpreted in mass-weighted form (equivalently, when z*kappa(z) is a probability measure). Second, for genuinely non-Hermitian dynamics the stationary PSD is naturally a biorthogonal product of left and right ground states, not a naive modulus square; the usual modulus squared of psi appears only in pseudo-Hermitian or effectively dephased regimes.\n  We then give a spectral dictionary linking typical PSD shapes to low-dimensional potential families in log-size space and outline inverse routes to infer effective potentials from data: parametric fitting with time-resolved PSDs, a direct steady-state inversion from a smoothed PSD, and an outlook toward inverse spectral ideas.

In this paper, we define as internal time the ``number of kinds'' of codes that have been observed at least once up to a given time, and analyze how the way internal time advances is determined by the statistics of information input (arrival rate and code distribution). When arrivals follow a Poisson process, the average advancing speed of internal time decreases monotonically with time, and if the number of kinds of codes is finite, it eventually approaches an upper limit and saturates. As a result, on long time scales, internal time becomes relatively shorter than physical time. For a uniform code distribution, we provide a closed form for the correspondence between internal time and physical time, and show that the physical time required to ``advance internal time by one step'' increases in later stages. As an ancillary quantity, we quantify by conditional entropy the remaining uncertainty of ``which codes have been observed'' when only internal time is known, and we give unimodality and the maximization time in the uniform case, and upper bounds, equality conditions, and expressions of the difference from the upper bound in the non-uniform case.

For the thickest film ($d=50$ nm), this yields coherence lengths of $ξ_{ab}\\approx 55$ nm and $ξ_c\\approx 14$ nm. Current-voltage characteristics show sizeable critical currents, with a critical current density reaching $J_{\\mathrm c}\\approx 6e4$ A/cm$^2$ at 0.5 K. These results establish epitaxial PtSb as a superconducting thin-film platform compatible with lattice-matched heterostructures in the NiAs-type materials family."}

Interestingly, recent experimental studies have suggested the preferential accumulation of $SO_4^{2-}$ ions at the $Na_2SO_{4,aq}$-graphene interface in disagreement with the generally known tendency of cations to accumulate at graphene-electrolyte interfaces. Herein, we resolve the atomistic structure of the $Na_2SO_{4,aq}$-graphene interfaces in the 0.1-2.0 M concentration range using machine learning interatomic potential-based simulations and simulated sum frequency generation (SFG) spectra to reveal the molecular origins of the conundrum. Our results show that Na+ ions accumulate between the outermost and second water layers whereas $SO_4^{2-}$ ions accumulate within the second interfacial water layer indicating cation dominated interfaces. We find that the interfacial region (within ~10 $Å$ of the graphene sheet) is negatively charged due to sub-stoichiometric $Na^+$/$SO_4^{2-}$ ratio at the interface. Our simulated SFG spectra show enhancement and a red-shift of the spectra in the hydrogen bonded region as a function of $Na_2SO_4$ concentration similar to measurements due to $SO_4^{2-}$-induced changes in the orientational order of water molecules in the second interfacial layer. Our study demonstrates that ion stratification and ion-induced water reorganization are key elements of understanding the electrolyte-graphene interface."}

Despite coming from the backfolding of the acoustic phonons of the individual layers, many of these modes become infrared active when the system is doped. We illustrate this effect by a direct calculation of the optical absorption of twisted bilayer graphene (tBG) around different twist angles, including the magic angle. Several modes -including the acoustic-like phason- acquire a dipole moment via interband matrix elements of the electron-phonon coupling (EPC) when the flat band is filled or emptied, giving rise to new resonances in the optical conductivity within the single-electron gap that are strongly affected by relaxation. The phason in particular gains a charge that equals the amount of electrons per moiré cell added/removed to/from neutrality. Geometrically, this can be understood as the topological quantization of a sliding Chern number. The charged phason yields a Drude-like conductivity with an effective mass that increases with lattice relaxation. Our findings are testable via THz spectroscopy, and provide an experimental knob to characterize EPC strength and disorder in moiré materials at small twist angles."}

These graphs are constructed by embedding quasi-uniform sites on a sphere and defining interactions via a chord-distance cutoff chosen to yield a network approximating four-neighbor connectivity. By combining Swendsen-Wang cluster Monte Carlo simulations with graph convolutional networks (GCNs), which operate directly on the adjacency structure and node spins, we develop a unified phase-classification framework applicable to both regular planar lattices and curved, irregular spherical graphs. Benchmarks on planar lattices demonstrate an efficient transfer strategy: after a fixed binarization of Potts spins into an effective Ising variable, a single GCN pretrained on the Ising model can localize the transition region for different $q$ values without retraining. Applying this strategy to spherical graphs, we find that curvature- and defect-induced connectivity irregularities produce only modest shifts in the inferred transition temperatures relative to planar baselines. Further analysis shows that the curvature-induced shift of the critical temperature is most pronounced at small $q$ and diminishes rapidly as $q$ increases; this trend is consistent with the physical picture that, in two dimensions, the Potts model undergoes a transition from a continuous phase transition to a weakly first-order one for $q>4$, accompanied by a pronounced reduction of the correlation length."}

Using the Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire free energy functional with higher powers, trilinear and biquadratic couplings of polar, nonpolar and antipolar order parameters, we calculated analytically the strain-dependent critical sizes of the ferroelectricity appearance and disappearance, analyzed how the size effect and mismatch strains influence the phase diagrams and polarization switching barrier in epitaxial HfO2 thin films and nano-islands with the out-of-plane spontaneous polarization. We have shown that the critical thickness/height of out-of-plane spontaneous polarization disappearance is determined by the size dependence of the depolarization field and correlation effects. The critical thickness/height of the ferroelectricity appearance is determined by the size dependence of the effective mismatch strain considering possible appearance of misfit dislocations and lateral relaxion of strains.

This situation necessitates the investigation of alternative signatures of AHCs. The gapless phonons of the emergent electronic lattice provide a clear distinction from conventional quantum Hall states, but it may be difficult to disentangle these phonons from the plethora of other possible low-lying modes. Intriguingly, the quantum geometry of the underlying electronic ground state can imprint on the collective modes, possibly leading the phonons themselves to be topological. Were this the case, the resulting neutral chiral edge modes would provide a further signature of an AHC. Using time-dependent Hartree-Fock, we compute the spectra of collective modes of Wigner crystals (WCs) and AHCs arising in minimal models and study the topology of the phonons and low-lying excitons. Across the WC to AHC transition, we observe a series of band inversions among collective modes, producing topological phonons and excitons, and a sharp sign change in the phonon Chern number upon entering the AHC phase. We conclude by discussing the relevance of collective mode topology to experiments on candidate systems for AHCs."}

Through systematic investigations of magnetic and transport properties, we identified two successive antiferromagnetic transitions at critical temperatures TN1 31.9 K and TN2 31.1 K, as evidenced by temperature-dependent resistivity, magnetic susceptibility, and specific heat measurements. Notably, applied magnetic fields exceeding 8 T induce a third magnetic transition (TN3), generating a cascade of metamagnetic transitions that collectively form a dendritic phase diagram. This complex magnetic behavior is attributed to the interplay between localized Gd-4f moments and itinerant conduction electrons, possibly mediated by Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. Transport measurements revealed striking stepwise anomalies in magnetoresistance when crossing phase boundaries, accompanied by pronounced hysteresis loops arising from magnetic moment flopping processes.

We present a versatile device platform to develop such nonvolatile memory devices consisting of an exchange-coupled ultra-thin superconductor encapsulated between two ferromagnetic insulators (FIs).

The objective is to characterize their molecular structures, spectroscopic constants, and electronic energies, and to elucidate plausible formation and destruction pathways, providing data critical for astrochemical and atmospheric detection. High-accuracy ab initio methods were employed, notably CCSD(T)-F12/cc-pVTZ-F12 for optimized geometries. Additional calculations were performed at the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ, CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ, MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ, and CIS levels. Intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) calculations were performed at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level to explore reaction pathways. Zero-point energy corrections were determined for all isomers considered. Six low-energy C2H4N2 isomers were identified, all within 1 eV of the global minimum. Among them, methylcyanamide (MCA) exhibits the lowest relative energy (~0.2 eV) and a significant electric dipole moment of 5.00 D, making it a strong candidate for gas-phase detection. The rotational constants for MCA, computed at the CCSD(T)-F12/cc-pVTZ-F12 level, are Ae = 34932.44 MHz, Be = 4995.31 MHz, and Ce = 4520.30 MHz. The V3 torsional barrier was found to be 631.19 cm^{-1}. Centrifugal distortion constants were computed up to sextic order for all isomers. Formation pathways for MCA, such as CH3N + HCN -> CH3NHCN and related isomers, were characterized. The combination of large dipole moments and distinct rotational signatures supports the detectability of methylcyanamide and related C2H4N2 isomers via radioastronomy, infrared, and microwave spectroscopy. Isomerization and reaction pathways involving radical-neutral and neutral-neutral processes were found to be key to their formation in gas-phase environments. These results provide a robust foundation for future observational and modeling efforts."}

These materials exhibit an ionic conductivity that is almost independent of the underlying chemistry, in stark contrast to what occurs in crystalline conductors. In this work, we employ an accurately fine-tuned machine learning interatomic potential to construct large-scale molecular dynamics trajectories encompassing hundreds of nanoseconds to obtain statistically converged transport properties. We find that the amorphous state consists of chain fragments of metal-anion tetrahedra of various lenght. By analyzing the residence time of alkali cations migrating around tetrahedrally-coordinated trivalent metal ions, we find that oxygen anions on the metal-anion tetrahedra limit alkali diffusion. By computing the full Einstein expression of the ionic conductivity, we demonstrate that the alkali transference number of these materials is strongly influenced by distinct-particles correlations, while at the same time they are characterized by an alkali Haven ratio close to one, implying that ionic transport is largely dictated by uncorrelated self-diffusion. Finally, by extending this analysis to chemical compositions $AMX_{2.5}\\textsf{O}_{0.75}$, spanning different alkaline ($A$ = Li, Na, K), metallic ($M$ = Al, Ga, In), and halogen ($X$ = Cl, Br, I) species, we clarify why the diffusion properties of these materials remain largely insensitive to variations in atomic chemistry."}

The distinctive feature of nanoscale hafnia-zirconia are the critical sizes of ferroelectricity appearance, whereas the critical sizes of ferroelectricity disappearance exist in other ferroelectrics. Using the Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire free energy functional with higher powers, trilinear and biquadratic couplings of polar, nonpolar and antipolar order parameters, we calculated analytically the strain-dependent critical sizes of the ferroelectricity appearance and disappearance, analyzed how the size effect and mismatch strains influence the phase diagrams and polarization switching barrier in epitaxial HfO2 thin films and nano-islands with the out-of-plane spontaneous polarization. We have shown that the critical thickness/height of out-of-plane spontaneous polarization disappearance is determined by the size dependence of the depolarization field and correlation effects. The critical thickness/height of the ferroelectricity appearance is determined by the size dependence of the effective mismatch strain considering possible appearance of misfit dislocations and lateral relaxion of strains. Derived analytical expressions can be generalized for HfxZr1-xO2 solid solutions, providing that corresponding parameters of the free energy are known from the first principles calculations."}

From the numerical analysis, we show that the SIT is essential to generate os- cillations in the order of GHz and without it the magnetization reaches steady state after exhibiting switching.

In such settings, the number of searchers is rarely constant: new agents may be recruited while others can abandon the search. Despite the ubiquity of these dynamics, their combined influence on search efficiency remains unexplored. Here we present a general framework for stochastic search in which independent agents progressively join and leave the process, a mechanism we term \\emph{dynamic redundancy and mortality} (DRM). Under minimal assumptions on the underlying search dynamics, this framework yields exact first-passage time statistics. It further reveals surprising connections to stochastic resetting, including a regime in which the resetting mean first-passage time emerges as a universal lower bound for DRM, as well as regimes in which DRM search is faster. We illustrate our results through a detailed analysis of one-dimensional Brownian DRM search. Altogether, this work provides a rigorous foundation for studying first-passage processes with a fluctuating number of searchers, with direct relevance across physical, biological, and algorithmic systems."}

It consists of copper silicide and almost pure Ag, while the far-field film forms a random mixture of Cu and Ag-rich domains through phase separation.

Here, we show that collinear magnets, which break time reversal symmetry in the non-magnetic sector, can have an inversion symmetry broken band structure and lead to unconventional types of collinear magnets. Hence, collinear odd-wave magnets do exist, and we explain that a magnetic field-induced Edelstein effect is their unique signature.

Our study combines mean-field calculation in the superconducting phase with pairing instability analysis of the normal state, incorporating the next-nearest-neighbor hopping in the single-particle dispersion relation. We demonstrate that the two types of altermagnetism have markedly different impacts on the stabilization of FFLO states. Specifically, $d_{xy}$-wave altermagnetism supports FFLO superconductivity over a broad parameter regime at low fillings, whereas $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave altermagnetism only induces FFLO pairing in a narrow range at high fillings. Furthermore, we find that the presence of a Van Hove singularity in the density of states tends to suppress FFLO superconductivity.

Also, the model includes a rotation-free active current of strength $λ$ and a rotational current of strength $ξ$. The inclusion of a chemical reaction with rate $Γ$ removes the conservation constraint and introduces a preferred wavenumber that governs the pattern formation below a critical reaction rate $Γ_c$. We argue for the analytical form of the amplitude equation based on symmetry considerations and explicitly derived it using multiscale analysis. By taking different limits of $g$, $λ$, and $ξ$, we recover amplitude equations for several well-known physical models as special cases and determine the nature transitions close to the onset of instability. We find that for $g = 0$, the transition is always supercritical, whereas for $g \\ne 0$, the transition between the supercritical and subcritical regimes depends sensitively on the model parameters.

Chasers and escapers move according to short-range sensing rules, while the density of obstacles tunes the connectivity of the accessible space. Using a combination of geometric analysis, dynamical observables, survival statistics, and transport characterization, we establish a direct link between lattice connectivity and pursuit efficiency. A Breadth-First Search analysis reveals that obstacle-induced fragmentation leads to a progressive loss of accessibility before the percolation threshold, defining the effective initial conditions for the dynamics. The trapping time and capture cost exhibit a non-monotonic dependence on obstacle density, reflecting a competition between path elongation in connected environments and geometric confinement near the percolation threshold. Survival analysis shows that the decay of the escaper population follows a Weibull form, with characteristic time and shape parameters displaying clear crossovers as a function of obstacle density, signaling the coexistence of cooperative capture and confinement-dominated trapping. Transport properties, quantified through the mean-squared displacement exponent, further support this picture, revealing sub-diffusive dynamics and a convergence toward a geometry-controlled regime near percolation. Overall, our results demonstrate that chase--and--escape dynamics in disordered environments are governed by a geometry-driven crossover, where percolation and connectivity act as unifying control parameters for spatial, temporal, and collective behavior."}

By combining Swendsen-Wang cluster Monte Carlo simulations with graph convolutional networks (GCNs), which operate directly on the adjacency structure and node spins, we develop a unified phase-classification framework applicable to both regular planar lattices and curved, irregular spherical graphs. Benchmarks on planar lattices demonstrate an efficient transfer strategy: after a fixed binarization of Potts spins into an effective Ising variable, a single GCN pretrained on the Ising model can localize the transition region for different $q$ values without retraining. Applying this strategy to spherical graphs, we find that curvature- and defect-induced connectivity irregularities produce only modest shifts in the inferred transition temperatures relative to planar baselines. Further analysis shows that the curvature-induced shift of the critical temperature is most pronounced at small $q$ and diminishes rapidly as $q$ increases; this trend is consistent with the physical picture that, in two dimensions, the Potts model undergoes a transition from a continuous phase transition to a weakly first-order one for $q>4$, accompanied by a pronounced reduction of the correlation length."}

Although exact electronic forces can be obtained from nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) calculations, their high computational cost renders long time dynamical simulations prohibitively expensive. By exploiting the locality of the electronic response, we train a neural network to directly predict instantaneous local electronic forces from the lattice configuration, thereby bypassing repeated NEGF calculations during time evolution. When combined with Brownian dynamics, the resulting machine learning force field quantitatively reproduces domain wall motion and nonequilibrium phase transition dynamics obtained from full NEGF simulations, while achieving orders of magnitude gains in computational efficiency. Our results establish direct force learning as an efficient and accurate approach for simulating nonequilibrium lattice dynamics in driven quantum materials."}

In solids, phase transformations typically occur by nucleation and growth under non-equilibrium conditions. Under constant external conditions, $\\textit{e.g.}$, constant heating temperature and pressure, the nucleation and growth dynamics are often thought of as spatially and temporally independent. Here, $\\textit{in-situ}$ Bragg X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) reveals nanoscale spatial and dynamical heterogeneity in the perovskite to brownmillerite topotactic phase transformation in La$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$CoO$_3$ (LSCO) thin films under constant reducing conditions over a time-span of multiple hours. Specifically, a timescale associated with domain growth remains stable, with a corresponding domain wall speed of $v_d = 6 \\pm 0.5 \\times10^{-4}$ nm/s ($2 \\pm 0.2$ nm/h), while a slower timescale, associated with temperature driven de-pinning of domains, leads to accelerating dynamics with timescales following an aging power law with exponent $-2.2 \\pm 0.5$. The experiment demonstrates that Bragg XPCS is a powerful tool to study nanoscale dynamics in phase transformations. The results are relevant for phase engineering of phase-change devices, as they show that nanoscale dynamics, linked to domain and domain-wall motion, can continuously evolve and speed up with time, even hours after the initiation of the phase transformation, with potential repercussions on electrical performance."}

Two competing growth modes -- radial outward and circumferential -- are analysed using Stefan-type models under a quasi-steady approximation. A generalisation of Mullins--Sekerka stability theory is developed to account for finite spherical domains, revealing that particle size and curvature introduce new destabilising parameters that govern microstructural length scales. Experimental observations of dendritic and cellular morphologies are interpreted through this framework, demonstrating that the interaction between growth fronts, undercooling, and curvature collectively determines the final particle structure.

In this work, we employ an accurately fine-tuned machine learning interatomic potential to construct large-scale molecular dynamics trajectories encompassing hundreds of nanoseconds to obtain statistically converged transport properties.

By analyzing the residence time of alkali cations migrating around tetrahedrally-coordinated trivalent metal ions, we find that oxygen anions on the metal-anion tetrahedra limit alkali diffusion. By computing the full Einstein expression of the ionic conductivity, we demonstrate that the alkali transference number of these materials is strongly influenced by distinct-particles correlations, while at the same time they are characterized by an alkali Haven ratio close to one, implying that ionic transport is largely dictated by uncorrelated self-diffusion.

The candidate topological superconductor PdTe has recently been proposed to host a nodeless surface gap on top of a nodal bulk state, but their direct identification and mutual coupling remained experimentally elusive. Here, we employ magnetic-field-dependent Andreev reflection spectroscopy to spectroscopically disentangle these components. At zero magnetic field, the spectra exhibit a BCS-like gap structure, consistent with dominant transport through a fully gapped surface superconducting state. Strikingly, even a weak magnetic field leads to an abrupt suppression of the Andreev-enhanced conductance (AEC), while a residual AEC, attributable to the nodal bulk state, persists to much higher magnetic fields. The transition is accompanied by pronounced magnetic hysteresis pointing to the existence of vortex dynamics at low fields. Our findings suggest that the nodal bulk gap facilitates early vortex entry, which in turn disrupts the fragile surface superconductivity.

Furthermore, the Raman and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy are employed to probe the structure and chemical bonding. The core-level photoemission analysis reveals the Cr$^{3+}$ and mixed Ni$^{2+}$/Ni$^{3+}$ oxidation states in the sample. Moreover, the bond valence energy landscape (BVEL) analysis, based on the refined structure, revealed a three-dimensional network of well-connected sodium sites with a migration energy barrier of 0.468 eV. The material delivered a good charge capacity at around 4.5 V, but showed no sodium-ion intercalation during discharge, resulting in negligible discharge capacity. The post-mortem analysis confirmed that the crystal structure remained intact. The calculated energy barrier values indicated a reversal in sodium site stability after cycling, though the barriers can still permit feasible ion migration. This suggests that ion transport alone cannot explain the lack of reversibility, which likely arises from intrinsically poor electronic conductivity.

We analyze more than twenty distinct stackings, including high- and low-symmetry configurations, and reveal that the spin splittings of graphene's Dirac bands span a wide range from 1 to 100 meV, depending on the local hybridization of Co $d_{z^2}$, hBN $p_z$, and graphene $p_z$ orbitals. The strongest proximity effects emerge at geometric resonances, or \"proximity hot spots\", where the three orbital states overlap maximally. The local spin polarization also depends sensitively on energy: Dirac states aligned with resonant Co orbitals experience the most pronounced exchange interaction. At these energies, the pseudospin Hamiltonian description of magnetic proximity effects breaks down. Outside these resonances, the pseudospin picture is restored. Our findings highlight the intrinsically local nature of proximity effects, governed by the spectral resonance and interlayer wavefunction overlap.

The rapid advancement of machine learning (ML) has accelerated the design of thermoelectric (TE) materials, yet a persistent \"gap\" remains between high-accuracy computational predictions and their successful experimental validation. While ML models frequently report impressive test scores (R^2 values of 0.90-0.98) for complex TE properties (zT, power factor, and electrical/thermal conductivity), only a handful of these predictions have culminated in the experimental discovery of new high-zT materials. In this review, we identify and discuss that the primary obstacles are poor model generalizability-stemming from the \"small-data\" problem, sampling biases in cross-validation, and inadequate structural representation-alongside the critical challenge of thermodynamic phase stability. Moreover, we argue that standard randomized validation often overestimates model performance by ignoring \"hidden hierarchies\" and clustering within chemical families. Finally, to bridge this gap between ML-predictions and experimental realization, we advocate for advanced validation strategies like PCA-based sampling and a synergetic active learning loop that integrates ML \"fast filters\" for stability (e.g., GNoME) with high-throughput combinatorial thin-film synthesis to rapidly map stable, high-zT compositional spaces."}

It consists of copper silicide and almost pure Ag, while the far-field film forms a random mixture of Cu and Ag-rich domains through phase separation. We show that the extent of the halo can be controlled by varying the temperature and duration of annealing. However, its length scale does not follow the square-root time dependence typical of diffusional growth.

We show that multiple natural definitions of such constrained dynamics arise from the underlying geometry of the state manifold. The conventional TDDFT formulation emerges from demanding stationarity of the action functional, while an alternative, purely geometric construction leads to a distinct form of constrained Schrödinger evolution that has not been previously explored. This alternative dynamics may provide a more mathematically robust route to TDDFT and may suggest new strategies for constructing nonadiabatic approximations. Applying the theory to interacting fermions on finite lattices, we derive novel Kohn--Sham schemes in which the density constraint is enforced via an imaginary potential or, equivalently, a nonlocal Hermitian operator.

The two excited spin-wave modes interact in a strongly nonlinear fashion giving rise to quasiperiodicity, hysteresis and non-commutativity of steady-state oscillation regimes. To disentangle such a complex variety of dynamics, we develop a reduced-order model based on magnetization normal modes that is amenable of appropriate analytical treatment, leading to quantitative description of parametric instability thresholds, post-instability steady-state amplitude saturation and complete determination of phase diagrams for steady-state oscillation regimes. We have performed validation of the theory using numerical simulations. The phase diagrams allow to predict and explain all the features of the nonlinear interaction between the parametrically-excited spin-wave modes and can be directly compared with experimental results."}

A variety of multivalent ions, including zinc (Zn$^{2+}$), magnesium (Mg$^{2+}$), calcium (Ca$^{2+}$), aluminum (Al$^{3+}$), and indium (In$^{3+}$), have been deployed in rechargeable batteries with varying degrees of success \\cite{1-9}. While chromium (Cr$^{3+}$) offers a superior volumetric capacity (approximately $11117\\ \\mathrm{mAh\\ cm^{-3}}$) compared to the aforementioned cations, there is no report of a rechargeable chromium battery. This is because chromium metal spontaneously oxidizes to form a passivating oxide layer \\cite{10} that blocks Cr$^{3+}$ ingress and egress. Here, we show that this fundamental limitation can be overcome by developing a chromium-rich high-entropy alloy. The alloy consists of five elements (Cr, bismuth (Bi), copper (Cu), tin (Sn), and nickel (Ni)), producing a multi-element native oxide rich in heterointerfaces. Some of these interfaces (such as Cr$_2$O$_3$/Bi$_2$O$_3$) exhibit a very low barrier for Cr$^{3+}$ diffusion, offering multiple pathways for efficient Cr$^{3+}$ insertion and extraction, while others (such as Cr$_2$O$_3$/CuO) block oxygen transport, thereby suppressing further oxidation. In a symmetric cell configuration, the chromium alloy supports approximately $10000$ hours (about $5000$ cycles) of reversible chromium insertion and extraction at an overpotential of only $20$ mV. The chromium-rich alloy anode was also successfully paired with a sulfur cathode to cycle reversibly in a full-cell configuration.

Intriguingly, the quantum geometry of the underlying electronic ground state can imprint on the collective modes, possibly leading the phonons themselves to be topological. Were this the case, the resulting neutral chiral edge modes would provide a further signature of an AHC. Using time-dependent Hartree-Fock, we compute the spectra of collective modes of Wigner crystals (WCs) and AHCs arising in minimal models and study the topology of the phonons and low-lying excitons. Across the WC to AHC transition, we observe a series of band inversions among collective modes, producing topological phonons and excitons, and a sharp sign change in the phonon Chern number upon entering the AHC phase.

Here, $\\textit{in-situ}$ Bragg X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) reveals nanoscale spatial and dynamical heterogeneity in the perovskite to brownmillerite topotactic phase transformation in La$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$CoO$_3$ (LSCO) thin films under constant reducing conditions over a time-span of multiple hours. Specifically, a timescale associated with domain growth remains stable, with a corresponding domain wall speed of $v_d = 6 \\pm 0.5 \\times10^{-4}$ nm/s ($2 \\pm 0.2$ nm/h), while a slower timescale, associated with temperature driven de-pinning of domains, leads to accelerating dynamics with timescales following an aging power law with exponent $-2.2 \\pm 0.5$. The experiment demonstrates that Bragg XPCS is a powerful tool to study nanoscale dynamics in phase transformations.

Despite coming from the backfolding of the acoustic phonons of the individual layers, many of these modes become infrared active when the system is doped. We illustrate this effect by a direct calculation of the optical absorption of twisted bilayer graphene (tBG) around different twist angles, including the magic angle. Several modes -including the acoustic-like phason- acquire a dipole moment via interband matrix elements of the electron-phonon coupling (EPC) when the flat band is filled or emptied, giving rise to new resonances in the optical conductivity within the single-electron gap that are strongly affected by relaxation. The phason in particular gains a charge that equals the amount of electrons per moiré cell added/removed to/from neutrality. Geometrically, this can be understood as the topological quantization of a sliding Chern number. The charged phason yields a Drude-like conductivity with an effective mass that increases with lattice relaxation. Our findings are testable via THz spectroscopy, and provide an experimental knob to characterize EPC strength and disorder in moiré materials at small twist angles."}

The ice nucleating ability of a certain substrate is mainly determined by both molecular interactions and the structural mismatch between the ice and the substrate lattices. We focus on the latter factor using molecular simulations of the mW model. Quantifying the effect of structural mismatch alone is challenging due to its coupling with molecular interactions. To disentangle both factors, we use a substrate composed of water molecules in such a way that any variation on the nucleation temperature can be exclusively ascribed to the structural mismatch. We find that a one per cent increase of structural mismatch leads to a decrease of approximately 4 K in the nucleation temperature. We also analyse the effect of the orientation of the substrate with respect to the liquid. The three main ice orientations (basal, primary prism and secondary prism) have a similar ice nucleating ability. We finally asses the effect of lattice flexibility by comparing substrates where molecules are immobile with others where a certain freedom to fluctuate around the lattice positions is allowed. Interestingly, we find that the latter type of substrate is more efficient in nucleating ice because it can adapt its structure to that of ice."}

Two competing growth modes -- radial outward and circumferential -- are analysed using Stefan-type models under a quasi-steady approximation. A generalisation of Mullins--Sekerka stability theory is developed to account for finite spherical domains, revealing that particle size and curvature introduce new destabilising parameters that govern microstructural length scales. Experimental observations of dendritic and cellular morphologies are interpreted through this framework, demonstrating that the interaction between growth fronts, undercooling, and curvature collectively determines the final particle structure.

GdTi3Bi4 crystallizes in layered Ti based kagome nets intertwined with zigzag Gd chains along the a axis and orders antiferromagnetically below 15 K. Here, we present the temperature and field dependent electrical transport of GdTi3Bi4 in different directions. The material exhibits anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) of 410 S cm-1 at 2 K for B parallel c and it is completely absent for B parallel a, despite the similar magnetization observed in both orientations. This behavior is quite contradictory, as anomalous Hall effect (AHE) typically scales with the magnetization. Through first principles calculations, it is demonstrated that in the presence of time reversal symmetry broken by the Gd 4f sublattice and spin orbit coupling, the magnetization direction controls the orbital mixing in the Ti t2g bands, relocating Berry curvature hot spots and producing the observed orientation selective AHC. The results establish GdTi3Bi4 as platform for investigating new avenues of AHE, such as directional AHE, and thus shed new light on the intricate coupling between magnetic and electronic structures, paving the way for exploring novel quantum phenomena."}

The influence of SiO2 and CaO sintering aids on the optical properties and microstructure of Cr,Ca:YAG ceramics was investigated. A decrease in CaO concentration led to a reduction of Cr,Ca:YAG transparency from 81 to 0 percent at 1064 nm; moreover, ceramics with lower CaO content exhibited abnormal grains and high porosity. These features were attributed to interactions between silica and calcium oxide during vacuum sintering. Two mechanisms are proposed to explain the effect of CaO and SiO2 on the formation of Ca,Cr:YAG ceramics. The first involves the formation of a liquid phase due to the CaO-SiO2 interaction during the heating stage, resulting in abnormal grain growth. The second mechanism is the mutual consumption of Si4+ and Ca2+ ions during the isothermal stage of sintering, which leads to a decrease in Cr4+ concentration. Both mechanisms negatively affect the optical and laser properties of the ceramics."}

The rapid advancement of machine learning (ML) has accelerated the design of thermoelectric (TE) materials, yet a persistent \"gap\" remains between high-accuracy computational predictions and their successful experimental validation. While ML models frequently report impressive test scores (R^2 values of 0.90-0.98) for complex TE properties (zT, power factor, and electrical/thermal conductivity), only a handful of these predictions have culminated in the experimental discovery of new high-zT materials. In this review, we identify and discuss that the primary obstacles are poor model generalizability-stemming from the \"small-data\" problem, sampling biases in cross-validation, and inadequate structural representation-alongside the critical challenge of thermodynamic phase stability. Moreover, we argue that standard randomized validation often overestimates model performance by ignoring \"hidden hierarchies\" and clustering within chemical families. Finally, to bridge this gap between ML-predictions and experimental realization, we advocate for advanced validation strategies like PCA-based sampling and a synergetic active learning loop that integrates ML \"fast filters\" for stability (e.g., GNoME) with high-throughput combinatorial thin-film synthesis to rapidly map stable, high-zT compositional spaces."}

The observed XLD signal is nearly invariant with temperature and independent on cooling field direction, in stark contrast to the substantial magnetic order-related XLD signal predicted by multiple scattering calculation. This finding strongly suggests a nonmagnetic origin for RuO2. Furthermore, we observed significantly distinct XLD signals at the Ru M3 and O K edges in RuO2 films grown on TiO2 substrate with different surface orientations, which can be attributed to the low-symmetry crystal field.

While chromium (Cr$^{3+}$) offers a superior volumetric capacity (approximately $11117\\ \\mathrm{mAh\\ cm^{-3}}$) compared to the aforementioned cations, there is no report of a rechargeable chromium battery. This is because chromium metal spontaneously oxidizes to form a passivating oxide layer \\cite{10} that blocks Cr$^{3+}$ ingress and egress. Here, we show that this fundamental limitation can be overcome by developing a chromium-rich high-entropy alloy. The alloy consists of five elements (Cr, bismuth (Bi), copper (Cu), tin (Sn), and nickel (Ni)), producing a multi-element native oxide rich in heterointerfaces. Some of these interfaces (such as Cr$_2$O$_3$/Bi$_2$O$_3$) exhibit a very low barrier for Cr$^{3+}$ diffusion, offering multiple pathways for efficient Cr$^{3+}$ insertion and extraction, while others (such as Cr$_2$O$_3$/CuO) block oxygen transport, thereby suppressing further oxidation. In a symmetric cell configuration, the chromium alloy supports approximately $10000$ hours (about $5000$ cycles) of reversible chromium insertion and extraction at an overpotential of only $20$ mV. The chromium-rich alloy anode was also successfully paired with a sulfur cathode to cycle reversibly in a full-cell configuration.

Benchmark studies show that Bgolearn reduces the number of required experiments by 40-60% compared with random search, grid search, and genetic algorithms, while maintaining comparable or superior solution quality. Its effectiveness is demonstrated not only through the studies presented in this paper, such as the identification of maximum-elastic-modulus triply periodic minimal surface structures, ultra-high-hardness high-entropy alloys, and high-strength, high-ductility medium-Mn steels, but also by numerous publications that have proven its impact in material discovery. With a modular architecture that integrates seamlessly into existing materials workflows and a graphical user interface (BgoFace) that removes programming barriers, Bgolearn establishes a practical and reliable platform for Bayesian optimization in materials science, and is openly available at https://github.com/Bin-Cao/Bgolearn."}

In this work, uncoated Fe3O4 nanoparticles and surface-modified Fe3O4 nanoparticles coated with polyethylene glycol (PEG-6000) and citric acid (CA) were synthesized via a chemical co-precipitation method. The effect of surface functionalization on the structural, spectroscopic, magnetic, and colloidal properties of the nanoparticles was systematically investigated. X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed the formation of phase-pure Fe3O4 with an inverse spinel structure for all the samples.

Here, the nanoindentation response of an equiatomic MoTaW alloy is investigated through a combined experimental and atomistically resolved modeling approach. Spherical nanoindentation experiments are coupled with large scale molecular dynamics simulations employing a tabulated low dimensional Gaussian Approximation Potential (tabGAP), enabling near DFT accuracy. A physics based similarity criterion, implemented via PCA of load-displacement curves, is used to identify mechanically representative experimental responses for quantitative comparison with simulations. Indentation stress-strain curves are constructed yielding excellent agreement in the elastic regime between experiment and simulation, with reduced Young's moduli of approximately 270 GPa. Generalized stacking fault energy calculations reveal elevated unstable stacking- and twinning-fault energies in MoTaW relative to pure refractory elements, indicating suppressed localized shear and a preference for dislocation-mediated plasticity. Atomistic analyses demonstrate a strong crystallographic dependence of plastic deformation, with symmetric {110}<111> slip activation and four-fold rosette pile-ups for the [001] orientation, and anisotropic slip, strain localization, and enhanced junction formation for [011]. Local entropy and polyhedral template matching analyses further elucidate dislocation network evolution and deformation-induced local structural transformations.

Such devices should be nonvolatile, scalable to high integration density and memory capacity, enable fast and low-power reading and writing operations, and be compatible with the digital logic. We present a versatile device platform to develop such nonvolatile memory devices consisting of an exchange-coupled ultra-thin superconductor encapsulated between two ferromagnetic insulators (FIs). The superconducting exchange coupling, which is tuneable by the relative alignment between the FI magnetizations, enables the switching of superconductivity on and off. We exploit this mechanism to create a superconducting nonvolatile memory where single-cell writing is realized using heat-assisted magnetic recording, and explain how it can become a contender for state-of-the-art superconducting memories. Furthermore, below their critical temperatures, the memory elements show a marked nonreciprocity, with zero magnetic field superconducting diode efficiencies exceeding $\\pm$60%, showing the versatility of the proposed devices for superconducting computing."}

Through high throughput synthesis and spectroscopic characterization of over 3000 samples, along with density functional theory and cluster expansion models, we determine the solubility boundaries of ternary halide perovskite nanocrystals and demonstrate their extended size dependent miscibility.

We map a self-similar fragmentation class to: a conservative pure-jump master equation in log-size space; an exact Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) dilation whose diagonal sector reproduces that master equation; and a controlled small-jump limit where the dynamics reduce to a Fokker-Planck operator that can be symmetrized into a Schrodinger-type spectral problem.\n  Two points ensure correctness and applicability. First, the Lindblad embedding is exact when the daughter kernel is interpreted in mass-weighted form (equivalently, when z*kappa(z) is a probability measure). Second, for genuinely non-Hermitian dynamics the stationary PSD is naturally a biorthogonal product of left and right ground states, not a naive modulus square; the usual modulus squared of psi appears only in pseudo-Hermitian or effectively dephased regimes.\n  We then give a spectral dictionary linking typical PSD shapes to low-dimensional potential families in log-size space and outline inverse routes to infer effective potentials from data: parametric fitting with time-resolved PSDs, a direct steady-state inversion from a smoothed PSD, and an outlook toward inverse spectral ideas. A synthetic example demonstrates forward simulation and inverse parameter recovery in an Airy-type half-line model."}

The dynamics follow from a scalar plastic potential that constrains the allowed velocity fields and leads to a phase field like formulation with a nontrivial mobility function. Although conceptually related to strain gradient plasticity, the theory differs by introducing an intrinsic, evolving length scale given by the dislocation spacing.\n  In this paper, we determine three key material independent parameters of this continuum theory by quantitatively comparing its predictions with discrete dislocation dynamics (DDD) simulations. To achieve this, we impose a narrow impenetrable wall inside the simulation volume, which blocks dislocation motion and generates characteristic spatial variations of the dislocation density fields under external loading. We show that for this geometry, the continuum equations reduce to a form that can be solved efficiently via direct numerical integration. The resulting stationary distributions of total and geometrically necessary dislocation densities are then compared to extensive 2D and 3D DDD simulations. This comparison allows us to extract the parameters that govern the back stress, the density gradient coupling, and the flow stress relation. Our results demonstrate that the continuum theory quantitatively captures the DDD observed structure of the dislocation pile up near the wall and therefore provides a reliable mesoscale description. The wall loading setup further serves as a benchmark problem to validate numerical implementations of the continuum theory in more general geometries."}

We use statistical mechanics and Monte Carlo simulations to demonstrate that an inequivalence in magnetic exchange between top and bottom surface moments, combined with the enhanced magnetic susceptibility of surface spins, can enable deterministic selection of antiferromagnetic domains depending on the magnetic-field ramping direction. We further show that this mechanism provides a natural interpretation for experimental observations of hysteresis in magneto-optical response of the van der Waals AFM $\\mathrm{MnBi_2Te_4}$.

While machine learning has supported property prediction and design, its effectiveness depends on labeled data, which remains expensive to generate via experiments or high-fidelity simulations. Improving data efficiency is thus a central concern in materials informatics.\n  Active learning (AL) addresses this by coupling model training with adaptive data acquisition. Instead of static datasets, AL iteratively prioritizes candidates based on uncertainty, diversity, or task-specific objectives. By guiding data collection under limited budgets, AL offers a structured approach to decision-making, complementing physical insight with quantitative measures of informativeness.\n  Recently, AL has been applied to computational simulation, structure optimization, and autonomous experimentation. However, the diversity of AL formulations has led to fragmented methodologies and inconsistent assessments. This Review provides a concise overview of AL methods in materials science, focusing on their role in improving data efficiency under realistic constraints. We summarize key methodological principles, representative applications, and persistent challenges, aiming to clarify the scope and limitations of AL as a practical tool within contemporary materials informatics."}

We demonstrate that spinodal decomposition can be detected in binary Fe-Cr alloys via modulus stiffening using in situ and ex situ transient grating spectroscopy (TGS). The key mechanistic insight is the non-linearity in elastic moduli as function of Cr content renders a spinodally decomposed Fe-Cr alloy stiffer than an equivalent solid solution for a certain range of initial chromium compositions. We confirm the presence of spinodal decomposition in the 36 at.% chromium alloy using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), linked to known spinodal decomposition energetics, and show via atomistic simulations that elastic modulus stiffening is expected after spinodal decomposition in the 36 at.% chromium alloy. The results of this study suggest the potential use of TGS as a practical tool for non-destructive evaluation of key materials susceptible to such degradation."}

Moreover, the bond valence energy landscape (BVEL) analysis, based on the refined structure, revealed a three-dimensional network of well-connected sodium sites with a migration energy barrier of 0.468 eV. The material delivered a good charge capacity at around 4.5 V, but showed no sodium-ion intercalation during discharge, resulting in negligible discharge capacity. The post-mortem analysis confirmed that the crystal structure remained intact. The calculated energy barrier values indicated a reversal in sodium site stability after cycling, though the barriers can still permit feasible ion migration. This suggests that ion transport alone cannot explain the lack of reversibility, which likely arises from intrinsically poor electronic conductivity. These findings highlight key challenges in achieving stable, reversible capacity in this system and underscore the need for doping, structural modification, and electrolyte optimization to realize its full potential as a high-voltage SIB cathode."}

Experimental study of percolation-driven magnetotransport in thin films.

However, the evolution of the microstructure and morphology near the percolation threshold, and its connection to the resulting magnetic and magnetotransport behavior in low-dimensional magnetic heterostructures, remain poorly understood. In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of the evolution of the structural, microstructural, and magnetotransport properties of Si/Fe bilayers by varying the Fe layer thickness. X-ray diffraction (XRD), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and magnetisation data reveal a percolation-driven transition from a continuous metallic film to percolative network structure of grains when tFe decreases below 30 Angstrom. Transport measurements involving longitudinal resistivity (rho), and the anomalous Hall resistivity (rho_A,h,s) show clear divergence near the percolation threshold. The purely electronic conduction channels (rho) evolve more gradually as compared to the combined electronic and magnetic ones rho_A,h,s. The percolative analysis of the structural, magnetic, and magnetotransport data yields a critical exponent in the range of 0.78 to 1.16, consistent with that of 2D-disordered systems. The AHE scaling relation between the rho_A,h,s and rho reveals a crossover of the AHE mechanism from a mixed intrinsic/side-jump contribution with a minor skew scattering component (n ~ 1.42) in the thick, low-resistive samples (tFe > 30 Angstrom) to a skew-scattering-dominant mechanism (n = 0.62) in the high-resistive films (tFe <= 30 Angstrom). This crossover coincides with the onset of structural and magnetic connectivity between the grains. Furthermore, these findings underscore the interlink between microstructure, morphology, magnetism, and Hall transport under a percolation framework."}

Here we introduce the concept of hidden half-metallicity, whereby the global electronic structure of a symmetry-enforced net-zero-magnetization magnet is non-half-metallic, while each of its two symmetry-related sectors is individually half-metallic, enabling robust 100\\% spin polarization through a layer degree of freedom. Crucially, the vanishing net magnetization of the entire system suppresses stray fields and magnetic instabilities, rendering the half-metallic functionality inherently more robust than in conventional ferromagnetic half-metals. Using first-principles calculations, we demonstrate this mechanism in a $PT$-symmetric bilayer $\\mathrm{CrS_2}$, and further show that an external electric field drives the system into a seemingly forbidden fully compensated ferrimagnetic metal in which hidden half-metallicity persists. Finally, we briefly confirm the realization of hidden half-metallicity in altermagnets, establishing a general paradigm for stabilizing half-metallic behavior by embedding it in symmetry-protected hidden sectors and opening a new route toward the design and discovery of unprecedented half-metallic phases."}

This is partly because film quality is often described using reactor specific settings instead of general physical variables. In this study, we show that plasma assisted MOCVD growth of InN can be described using a single thermodynamic driving force coordinate. This coordinate brings together growth kinetics, defect sensitive Raman response and structural coherence across different process conditions. When we use this coordinate, the incorporation rate follows a universal activated trend with a kinetic scale of about 0.08 eV. Raman measurements show a clear crossover between a defect sparse and a defect rich regime, a disorder activated Raman metric increases quickly after the crossover, while an A1-LO control metric stays mostly the same. This suggests that short range lattice disorder, not long range polar coupling, dominates the defect activation process. X-ray diffraction shows that the out of plane coherence length stays the same for samples with the same driving force, even if reactor settings are very different. This supports the idea that structural coherence is organized by thermodynamics in this growth window. Finally, a simple kinetic Monte Carlo model using driving force biased incorporation and defect activation events matches the observed exponential trends and the two regimes, supporting the driving force approach. These results show that a transferable driving force coordinate can be used for plasma assisted InN growth and offer a quantitative way to achieve defect sparse growth conditions."}

Among them, molecular intercalation superlattices have attracted attention as tunable hybrid materials, formed by inserting organic molecules into van der Waals crystals, where molecular structure and chemistry provide new degrees of freedom. Traditionally, the intercalated molecules have been regarded as inactive spacers, while possible molecular ordering and its impact on the host lattice have remained largely unexplored. Here, we report the discovery of a cooperative superstructure (CSS) phase in molecule intercalated NbSe2, where ordering of the guest molecules induce a concomitant superstructure in the NbSe2 host lattice, characterized by a moiré structure due to incommensurability between the molecular layer and the inorganic lattice. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction reveals the emergence of CSS phase, accompanied by crystal symmetry lowering. Complementary resistivity and thermal-quench measurements show that the transition is governed by unusually slow order-disorder kinetics, so that the CSS phase can be selectively accessed under standard laboratory cooling rates. This kinetic behavior arises from slow molecular dynamics coupled to the host lattice, contrasting with fast charge or magnetic ordering in inorganic solids. Our findings establish molecular ordering as a route for engineering heterointerfaces, enabling thermally programmable superstructures."}

The influence of SiO2 and CaO sintering aids on the optical properties and microstructure of Cr,Ca:YAG ceramics was investigated. A decrease in CaO concentration led to a reduction of Cr,Ca:YAG transparency from 81 to 0 percent at 1064 nm; moreover, ceramics with lower CaO content exhibited abnormal grains and high porosity. These features were attributed to interactions between silica and calcium oxide during vacuum sintering. Two mechanisms are proposed to explain the effect of CaO and SiO2 on the formation of Ca,Cr:YAG ceramics. The first involves the formation of a liquid phase due to the CaO-SiO2 interaction during the heating stage, resulting in abnormal grain growth. The second mechanism is the mutual consumption of Si4+ and Ca2+ ions during the isothermal stage of sintering, which leads to a decrease in Cr4+ concentration. Both mechanisms negatively affect the optical and laser properties of the ceramics."}

Our study combines mean-field calculation in the superconducting phase with pairing instability analysis of the normal state, incorporating the next-nearest-neighbor hopping in the single-particle dispersion relation. We demonstrate that the two types of altermagnetism have markedly different impacts on the stabilization of FFLO states. Specifically, $d_{xy}$-wave altermagnetism supports FFLO superconductivity over a broad parameter regime at low fillings, whereas $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave altermagnetism only induces FFLO pairing in a narrow range at high fillings. Furthermore, we find that the presence of a Van Hove singularity in the density of states tends to suppress FFLO superconductivity.

Using polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) or polyethylene glycol (PEG) as capping agents, we achieved precise control over particle size, optical properties, and particle size distribution. Room temperature co-precipitation produced monodisperse ZnS QDs with crystallite size as small as 2.03 nm, while hydrothermal synthesis at elevated temperature yielded larger crystals exceeding ~6 nm. X-ray diffraction confirmed zinc-blende crystal structure in all samples, with lattice parameter shifts and peak broadening reflecting nanoscale effects. UV-Visible spectroscopy revealed tuneable optical band gaps from 3.60 eV to 3.80 eV, corresponding to strong quantum confinement in smaller particles. FTIR and DLS analyses verified effective surface capping and particle size distribution, with PVP providing greater growth suppression and stability than PEG.

Despite coming from the backfolding of the acoustic phonons of the individual layers, many of these modes become infrared active when the system is doped. We illustrate this effect by a direct calculation of the optical absorption of twisted bilayer graphene (tBG) around different twist angles, including the magic angle. Several modes -including the acoustic-like phason- acquire a dipole moment via interband matrix elements of the electron-phonon coupling (EPC) when the flat band is filled or emptied, giving rise to new resonances in the optical conductivity within the single-electron gap that are strongly affected by relaxation. The phason in particular gains a charge that equals the amount of electrons per moiré cell added/removed to/from neutrality. Geometrically, this can be understood as the topological quantization of a sliding Chern number. The charged phason yields a Drude-like conductivity with an effective mass that increases with lattice relaxation. Our findings are testable via THz spectroscopy, and provide an experimental knob to characterize EPC strength and disorder in moiré materials at small twist angles."}

GdTi3Bi4 crystallizes in layered Ti based kagome nets intertwined with zigzag Gd chains along the a axis and orders antiferromagnetically below 15 K. Here, we present the temperature and field dependent electrical transport of GdTi3Bi4 in different directions. The material exhibits anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) of 410 S cm-1 at 2 K for B parallel c and it is completely absent for B parallel a, despite the similar magnetization observed in both orientations. This behavior is quite contradictory, as anomalous Hall effect (AHE) typically scales with the magnetization. Through first principles calculations, it is demonstrated that in the presence of time reversal symmetry broken by the Gd 4f sublattice and spin orbit coupling, the magnetization direction controls the orbital mixing in the Ti t2g bands, relocating Berry curvature hot spots and producing the observed orientation selective AHC. The results establish GdTi3Bi4 as platform for investigating new avenues of AHE, such as directional AHE, and thus shed new light on the intricate coupling between magnetic and electronic structures, paving the way for exploring novel quantum phenomena."}

Here in this work, we employ X-ray linear dichroism (XLD), a widely utilized technique for characterizing antiferromagnets, in conjunction with photoemission electron microscopy and multiple scattering calculation to provide clear evidence of the absence of magnetic order in epitaxial RuO2 films. The observed XLD signal is nearly invariant with temperature and independent on cooling field direction, in stark contrast to the substantial magnetic order-related XLD signal predicted by multiple scattering calculation. This finding strongly suggests a nonmagnetic origin for RuO2. Furthermore, we observed significantly distinct XLD signals at the Ru M3 and O K edges in RuO2 films grown on TiO2 substrate with different surface orientations, which can be attributed to the low-symmetry crystal field. These results unequivocally demonstrate the absence of magnetic order in RuO2 and establishes XLD measurement as a robust technique for probing the low-symmetry magnetic materials."}

We show that multiple natural definitions of such constrained dynamics arise from the underlying geometry of the state manifold. The conventional TDDFT formulation emerges from demanding stationarity of the action functional, while an alternative, purely geometric construction leads to a distinct form of constrained Schrödinger evolution that has not been previously explored. This alternative dynamics may provide a more mathematically robust route to TDDFT and may suggest new strategies for constructing nonadiabatic approximations.

Our calculation demonstrates that the total tunneling current is consistent with a crossover from trap-assisted-tunneling-dominated transport to Fowler-Nordheim-tunneling-dominated transport under different gate bias regimes. These results refine the conventional Fowler-Nordheim-based picture of interface trapping in strained Ge/SiGe heterostructures and provide guidelines for improving Ge-based quantum device performance by improving barrier crystalline qualities and reducing dislocation-related trap densities."}

The dynamics follow from a scalar plastic potential that constrains the allowed velocity fields and leads to a phase field like formulation with a nontrivial mobility function. Although conceptually related to strain gradient plasticity, the theory differs by introducing an intrinsic, evolving length scale given by the dislocation spacing.\n  In this paper, we determine three key material independent parameters of this continuum theory by quantitatively comparing its predictions with discrete dislocation dynamics (DDD) simulations. To achieve this, we impose a narrow impenetrable wall inside the simulation volume, which blocks dislocation motion and generates characteristic spatial variations of the dislocation density fields under external loading. We show that for this geometry, the continuum equations reduce to a form that can be solved efficiently via direct numerical integration. The resulting stationary distributions of total and geometrically necessary dislocation densities are then compared to extensive 2D and 3D DDD simulations. This comparison allows us to extract the parameters that govern the back stress, the density gradient coupling, and the flow stress relation. Our results demonstrate that the continuum theory quantitatively captures the DDD observed structure of the dislocation pile up near the wall and therefore provides a reliable mesoscale description. The wall loading setup further serves as a benchmark problem to validate numerical implementations of the continuum theory in more general geometries."}

To scale to large supercells, PFT stochastically samples Hessian columns and computes the loss with a single Hessian-vector product. We also use a simple co-training scheme to incorporate upstream data to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. On the MDR Phonon benchmark, PFT improves Nequix MP (trained on Materials Project) by 55% on average across phonon thermodynamic properties and achieves state-of-the-art performance among models trained on Materials Project trajectories. PFT also generalizes to improve properties beyond second-derivatives, improving thermal conductivity predictions that rely on third-order derivatives of the potential energy."}

Supplementary material is a part of this submission", "summary": "The non-thermal optical control of magnetic order offers a promising route to ultrafast, energy-efficient information technologies. Although optical manipulation of magnetism in metals has been extensively studied, experimentally demonstrated effects have so far been limited to heat-driven dynamics or helicity-dependent mechanisms. Here, we report ultrafast non-thermal control of spin order in noncollinear antiferromagnetic Mn-based antiperovskite nitrides Mn3NiN and Mn3GaN, driven solely by the polarization orientation of linearly polarized femtosecond laser pulses. Using time-resolved magneto-optical pump-probe experiments based on the Voigt effect, we observe sub-picosecond changes in magnetic order followed by picosecond relaxation. The magneto-optical response depends on the relative orientation of the pump and probe polarization planes, with linear-polarization dependence reaching up to 95%, a value unprecedented in metallic magnets. This phenomenon is observed in two different materials and persists over a wide range of excitation wavelengths, fluences, and temperatures, demonstrating its robustness. Symmetry analysis and microscopic modeling indicate that optically induced torques alone cannot fully explain the observed dynamics. We therefore propose laser-induced formation of transient spin-spiral states as a possible excitation mechanism."}

While machine learning has supported property prediction and design, its effectiveness depends on labeled data, which remains expensive to generate via experiments or high-fidelity simulations. Improving data efficiency is thus a central concern in materials informatics.\n  Active learning (AL) addresses this by coupling model training with adaptive data acquisition. Instead of static datasets, AL iteratively prioritizes candidates based on uncertainty, diversity, or task-specific objectives. By guiding data collection under limited budgets, AL offers a structured approach to decision-making, complementing physical insight with quantitative measures of informativeness.\n  Recently, AL has been applied to computational simulation, structure optimization, and autonomous experimentation. However, the diversity of AL formulations has led to fragmented methodologies and inconsistent assessments. This Review provides a concise overview of AL methods in materials science, focusing on their role in improving data efficiency under realistic constraints. We summarize key methodological principles, representative applications, and persistent challenges, aiming to clarify the scope and limitations of AL as a practical tool within contemporary materials informatics."}

In this work, we investigated the energy level alignment of C60 on in-situ cleaved MAPbI3 single crystals in multiple repeat experiments using photoelectron spectroscopy aiming to resolve inconsistencies reported in earlier studies. Our results show that both materials remain chemically stable upon interface formation, the strong reactions typically seen when metals contact perovskites. By analyzing Pb 4f and C 1s core level positions in detail, we determined that C60 consistently exhibits a downward energy shift toward MAPbI3, which works against efficient charge extraction. The magnitude of this shift, however, is highly sensitive to the surface composition, highlighting that small variations may lead to significant differences in results. At higher C60 coverages of more than 5 monolayers, a constant HOMO-valence band offset of 0.52 eV was obtained. Assuming a 1.86 eV HOMO-LUMO gap, the C60 LUMO is 0.25 eV below the MAPbI3 conduction band, a value favorable for charge extraction. These findings underscore the decisive role of surface chemistry on interfacial energetics, explain performance variability in perovskite devices, and demonstrate the need to control and accurately measure surface properties. Furthermore, the observed energetic alignment can explain why further interface modification by charge blocking layers or surface passivation is needed for optimized device efficiencies."}

Three different boron doping concentrations were considered to elucidate how dopant density influences the binding strength, charge transfer, and electronic structure of the resulting systems. In addition, the effects of biaxial strain and surface oxidation were examined to assess their impact on the reactivity and stability of B-doped graphene. The results show that boron doping substantially enhances graphene's affinity toward metal adsorption, though the extent and nature of this effect depend strongly on the metal type and doping level. For some of the metals investigated, the interaction is found to be almost entirely charge-transfer driven, with minimal orbital hybridization. Mechanical strain is found to enable fine-tuning of the metal/substrate interaction, while surface oxidation introduces a more pronounced effect by enabling direct interaction between metal atoms and oxygen functional groups in most cases, thereby significantly altering adsorption geometry and strength. These findings provide valuable insights into the design of boron-doped graphene materials for energy conversion and storage applications."}

Furthermore, the Raman and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy are employed to probe the structure and chemical bonding. The core-level photoemission analysis reveals the Cr$^{3+}$ and mixed Ni$^{2+}$/Ni$^{3+}$ oxidation states in the sample. Moreover, the bond valence energy landscape (BVEL) analysis, based on the refined structure, revealed a three-dimensional network of well-connected sodium sites with a migration energy barrier of 0.468 eV. The material delivered a good charge capacity at around 4.5 V, but showed no sodium-ion intercalation during discharge, resulting in negligible discharge capacity. The post-mortem analysis confirmed that the crystal structure remained intact. The calculated energy barrier values indicated a reversal in sodium site stability after cycling, though the barriers can still permit feasible ion migration. This suggests that ion transport alone cannot explain the lack of reversibility, which likely arises from intrinsically poor electronic conductivity. These findings highlight key challenges in achieving stable, reversible capacity in this system and underscore the need for doping, structural modification, and electrolyte optimization to realize its full potential as a high-voltage SIB cathode."}

Electronic spectroscopy data are calculated by time-dependent density function theory and then compared with experimental results. Electronic couplings between exciton donor and acceptor are estimated based on both transition density cube method and transition dipole approximation. These results confirm that the delocalization of exciton to the bridge parts contribute to significant enhancement of donor-acceptor electronic coupling. Mechanistic details of exciton transfer are examined by estimating the contributions of the bridge electronic states, vibrational modes of the dyads commonly coupled to both donor and acceptor, inelastic resonance energy transfer mechanism, and dark exciton states.

Interestingly, recent experimental studies have suggested the preferential accumulation of $SO_4^{2-}$ ions at the $Na_2SO_{4,aq}$-graphene interface in disagreement with the generally known tendency of cations to accumulate at graphene-electrolyte interfaces. Herein, we resolve the atomistic structure of the $Na_2SO_{4,aq}$-graphene interfaces in the 0.1-2.0 M concentration range using machine learning interatomic potential-based simulations and simulated sum frequency generation (SFG) spectra to reveal the molecular origins of the conundrum. Our results show that Na+ ions accumulate between the outermost and second water layers whereas $SO_4^{2-}$ ions accumulate within the second interfacial water layer indicating cation dominated interfaces. We find that the interfacial region (within ~10 $Å$ of the graphene sheet) is negatively charged due to sub-stoichiometric $Na^+$/$SO_4^{2-}$ ratio at the interface. Our simulated SFG spectra show enhancement and a red-shift of the spectra in the hydrogen bonded region as a function of $Na_2SO_4$ concentration similar to measurements due to $SO_4^{2-}$-induced changes in the orientational order of water molecules in the second interfacial layer.

Experimental study of percolation-driven magnetotransport in thin films. Author-accepted manuscript", "summary": "The anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in magnetic nanofilms is highly sensitive to the microstructural and magnetic homogeneity. However, the evolution of the microstructure and morphology near the percolation threshold, and its connection to the resulting magnetic and magnetotransport behavior in low-dimensional magnetic heterostructures, remain poorly understood. In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of the evolution of the structural, microstructural, and magnetotransport properties of Si/Fe bilayers by varying the Fe layer thickness. X-ray diffraction (XRD), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and magnetisation data reveal a percolation-driven transition from a continuous metallic film to percolative network structure of grains when tFe decreases below 30 Angstrom. Transport measurements involving longitudinal resistivity (rho), and the anomalous Hall resistivity (rho_A,h,s) show clear divergence near the percolation threshold. The purely electronic conduction channels (rho) evolve more gradually as compared to the combined electronic and magnetic ones rho_A,h,s. The percolative analysis of the structural, magnetic, and magnetotransport data yields a critical exponent in the range of 0.78 to 1.16, consistent with that of 2D-disordered systems. The AHE scaling relation between the rho_A,h,s and rho reveals a crossover of the AHE mechanism from a mixed intrinsic/side-jump contribution with a minor skew scattering component (n ~ 1.42) in the thick, low-resistive samples (tFe > 30 Angstrom) to a skew-scattering-dominant mechanism (n = 0.62) in the high-resistive films (tFe <= 30 Angstrom).

Here we introduce the concept of hidden half-metallicity, whereby the global electronic structure of a symmetry-enforced net-zero-magnetization magnet is non-half-metallic, while each of its two symmetry-related sectors is individually half-metallic, enabling robust 100\\% spin polarization through a layer degree of freedom. Crucially, the vanishing net magnetization of the entire system suppresses stray fields and magnetic instabilities, rendering the half-metallic functionality inherently more robust than in conventional ferromagnetic half-metals. Using first-principles calculations, we demonstrate this mechanism in a $PT$-symmetric bilayer $\\mathrm{CrS_2}$, and further show that an external electric field drives the system into a seemingly forbidden fully compensated ferrimagnetic metal in which hidden half-metallicity persists. Finally, we briefly confirm the realization of hidden half-metallicity in altermagnets, establishing a general paradigm for stabilizing half-metallic behavior by embedding it in symmetry-protected hidden sectors and opening a new route toward the design and discovery of unprecedented half-metallic phases."}

This is partly because film quality is often described using reactor specific settings instead of general physical variables. In this study, we show that plasma assisted MOCVD growth of InN can be described using a single thermodynamic driving force coordinate. This coordinate brings together growth kinetics, defect sensitive Raman response and structural coherence across different process conditions. When we use this coordinate, the incorporation rate follows a universal activated trend with a kinetic scale of about 0.08 eV. Raman measurements show a clear crossover between a defect sparse and a defect rich regime, a disorder activated Raman metric increases quickly after the crossover, while an A1-LO control metric stays mostly the same. This suggests that short range lattice disorder, not long range polar coupling, dominates the defect activation process. X-ray diffraction shows that the out of plane coherence length stays the same for samples with the same driving force, even if reactor settings are very different. This supports the idea that structural coherence is organized by thermodynamics in this growth window. Finally, a simple kinetic Monte Carlo model using driving force biased incorporation and defect activation events matches the observed exponential trends and the two regimes, supporting the driving force approach. These results show that a transferable driving force coordinate can be used for plasma assisted InN growth and offer a quantitative way to achieve defect sparse growth conditions."}

In its field-temperature phase diagram, we identify a critical endpoint (CEP) and an associated Ising supercritical regime (ISR). The CEP of the metamagnetic transition is located at ${μ_0H_c} \\simeq 1.04$ T and $T_c \\simeq 0.3$ K.

Among them, molecular intercalation superlattices have attracted attention as tunable hybrid materials, formed by inserting organic molecules into van der Waals crystals, where molecular structure and chemistry provide new degrees of freedom. Traditionally, the intercalated molecules have been regarded as inactive spacers, while possible molecular ordering and its impact on the host lattice have remained largely unexplored. Here, we report the discovery of a cooperative superstructure (CSS) phase in molecule intercalated NbSe2, where ordering of the guest molecules induce a concomitant superstructure in the NbSe2 host lattice, characterized by a moiré structure due to incommensurability between the molecular layer and the inorganic lattice. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction reveals the emergence of CSS phase, accompanied by crystal symmetry lowering. Complementary resistivity and thermal-quench measurements show that the transition is governed by unusually slow order-disorder kinetics, so that the CSS phase can be selectively accessed under standard laboratory cooling rates. This kinetic behavior arises from slow molecular dynamics coupled to the host lattice, contrasting with fast charge or magnetic ordering in inorganic solids. Our findings establish molecular ordering as a route for engineering heterointerfaces, enabling thermally programmable superstructures."}

The inclusion of a chemical reaction with rate $Γ$ removes the conservation constraint and introduces a preferred wavenumber that governs the pattern formation below a critical reaction rate $Γ_c$. We argue for the analytical form of the amplitude equation based on symmetry considerations and explicitly derived it using multiscale analysis. By taking different limits of $g$, $λ$, and $ξ$, we recover amplitude equations for several well-known physical models as special cases and determine the nature transitions close to the onset of instability.

These graphs are constructed by embedding quasi-uniform sites on a sphere and defining interactions via a chord-distance cutoff chosen to yield a network approximating four-neighbor connectivity. By combining Swendsen-Wang cluster Monte Carlo simulations with graph convolutional networks (GCNs), which operate directly on the adjacency structure and node spins, we develop a unified phase-classification framework applicable to both regular planar lattices and curved, irregular spherical graphs. Benchmarks on planar lattices demonstrate an efficient transfer strategy: after a fixed binarization of Potts spins into an effective Ising variable, a single GCN pretrained on the Ising model can localize the transition region for different $q$ values without retraining. Applying this strategy to spherical graphs, we find that curvature- and defect-induced connectivity irregularities produce only modest shifts in the inferred transition temperatures relative to planar baselines. Further analysis shows that the curvature-induced shift of the critical temperature is most pronounced at small $q$ and diminishes rapidly as $q$ increases; this trend is consistent with the physical picture that, in two dimensions, the Potts model undergoes a transition from a continuous phase transition to a weakly first-order one for $q>4$, accompanied by a pronounced reduction of the correlation length."}

By exploring quantum phenomena in the weak-coupling limit within a multiband system, our findings pave the way for engineering exotic superconductivity via band-selective pairing control."}

The candidate topological superconductor PdTe has recently been proposed to host a nodeless surface gap on top of a nodal bulk state, but their direct identification and mutual coupling remained experimentally elusive. Here, we employ magnetic-field-dependent Andreev reflection spectroscopy to spectroscopically disentangle these components. At zero magnetic field, the spectra exhibit a BCS-like gap structure, consistent with dominant transport through a fully gapped surface superconducting state. Strikingly, even a weak magnetic field leads to an abrupt suppression of the Andreev-enhanced conductance (AEC), while a residual AEC, attributable to the nodal bulk state, persists to much higher magnetic fields. The transition is accompanied by pronounced magnetic hysteresis pointing to the existence of vortex dynamics at low fields. Our findings suggest that the nodal bulk gap facilitates early vortex entry, which in turn disrupts the fragile surface superconductivity. These results establish a field-tunable decoupling of surface and bulk superconductivity and illustrate how distinct gap topologies can shape the global superconducting order in multichannel systems."}

Here, we present the temperature and field dependent electrical transport of GdTi3Bi4 in different directions. The material exhibits anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) of 410 S cm-1 at 2 K for B parallel c and it is completely absent for B parallel a, despite the similar magnetization observed in both orientations.

This phenomenon is observed in two different materials and persists over a wide range of excitation wavelengths, fluences, and temperatures, demonstrating its robustness. Symmetry analysis and microscopic modeling indicate that optically induced torques alone cannot fully explain the observed dynamics. We therefore propose laser-induced formation of transient spin-spiral states as a possible excitation mechanism."}

In this work, we investigated the energy level alignment of C60 on in-situ cleaved MAPbI3 single crystals in multiple repeat experiments using photoelectron spectroscopy aiming to resolve inconsistencies reported in earlier studies. Our results show that both materials remain chemically stable upon interface formation, the strong reactions typically seen when metals contact perovskites. By analyzing Pb 4f and C 1s core level positions in detail, we determined that C60 consistently exhibits a downward energy shift toward MAPbI3, which works against efficient charge extraction. The magnitude of this shift, however, is highly sensitive to the surface composition, highlighting that small variations may lead to significant differences in results. At higher C60 coverages of more than 5 monolayers, a constant HOMO-valence band offset of 0.52 eV was obtained. Assuming a 1.86 eV HOMO-LUMO gap, the C60 LUMO is 0.25 eV below the MAPbI3 conduction band, a value favorable for charge extraction. These findings underscore the decisive role of surface chemistry on interfacial energetics, explain performance variability in perovskite devices, and demonstrate the need to control and accurately measure surface properties. Furthermore, the observed energetic alignment can explain why further interface modification by charge blocking layers or surface passivation is needed for optimized device efficiencies."}

Three different boron doping concentrations were considered to elucidate how dopant density influences the binding strength, charge transfer, and electronic structure of the resulting systems. In addition, the effects of biaxial strain and surface oxidation were examined to assess their impact on the reactivity and stability of B-doped graphene. The results show that boron doping substantially enhances graphene's affinity toward metal adsorption, though the extent and nature of this effect depend strongly on the metal type and doping level. For some of the metals investigated, the interaction is found to be almost entirely charge-transfer driven, with minimal orbital hybridization. Mechanical strain is found to enable fine-tuning of the metal/substrate interaction, while surface oxidation introduces a more pronounced effect by enabling direct interaction between metal atoms and oxygen functional groups in most cases, thereby significantly altering adsorption geometry and strength. These findings provide valuable insights into the design of boron-doped graphene materials for energy conversion and storage applications."}

The proximity-induced exchange coupling, magnetic moments, and tunneling spin polarization (TSP) are shown to depend sensitively on the atomic registry at the interfaces. We analyze more than twenty distinct stackings, including high- and low-symmetry configurations, and reveal that the spin splittings of graphene's Dirac bands span a wide range from 1 to 100 meV, depending on the local hybridization of Co $d_{z^2}$, hBN $p_z$, and graphene $p_z$ orbitals. The strongest proximity effects emerge at geometric resonances, or \"proximity hot spots\", where the three orbital states overlap maximally. The local spin polarization also depends sensitively on energy: Dirac states aligned with resonant Co orbitals experience the most pronounced exchange interaction. At these energies, the pseudospin Hamiltonian description of magnetic proximity effects breaks down. Outside these resonances, the pseudospin picture is restored. Our findings highlight the intrinsically local nature of proximity effects, governed by the spectral resonance and interlayer wavefunction overlap. We further quantify how additional hBN layers, interlayer twist, and multilayer graphene modify the proximity exchange and TSP, offering microscopic insight for designing spintronic van der Waals heterostructures with engineered interfaces and optimized spin transport."}

This type of problem belongs to a broader class of nonlinear modal dynamics that arise across many areas of physics and engineering. The ferromagnetic sample is driven by parallel pumping with an external applied magnetic field having two tones at different frequencies, which are able to trigger parametric instability of two resonant modes. The two excited spin-wave modes interact in a strongly nonlinear fashion giving rise to quasiperiodicity, hysteresis and non-commutativity of steady-state oscillation regimes. To disentangle such a complex variety of dynamics, we develop a reduced-order model based on magnetization normal modes that is amenable of appropriate analytical treatment, leading to quantitative description of parametric instability thresholds, post-instability steady-state amplitude saturation and complete determination of phase diagrams for steady-state oscillation regimes. We have performed validation of the theory using numerical simulations. The phase diagrams allow to predict and explain all the features of the nonlinear interaction between the parametrically-excited spin-wave modes and can be directly compared with experimental results."}

We also derive exact lower bounds for generalized models with further-neighbor exchange, ring exchange, and scalar spin-chirality interactions.

Here we extend this analogy to a highly frustrated antiferromagnet, the kagome-layered spiral Ising compound Nd$_3$BWO$_9$. In its field-temperature phase diagram, we identify a critical endpoint (CEP) and an associated Ising supercritical regime (ISR). The CEP of the metamagnetic transition is located at ${μ_0H_c} \\simeq 1.04$ T and $T_c \\simeq 0.3$ K. Above this point, the ISR emerges with supercritical crossover lines that adhere to a universal scaling law, as evidenced by the specific heat and magnetic susceptibility measurements. Remarkably, we observe a universally divergent Grueneisen ratio near the emergent CEP, $Γ_H \\propto 1/t^{β+γ-1}$, with $β + γ \\simeq 1.563$ the critical exponents of the 3D Ising universality class and $t \\equiv (T - T_c)/T_c$ the reduced temperature. Our adiabatic demagnetization measurements on Nd$_3$BWO$_9$ reveal a lowest temperature of 195 mK achieved from 2 K and 4 T. Our work opens new avenues for studying supercritical physics and efficient cooling in layered-kagome, rare-earth RE$_3$BWO$_9$ family and, more broadly, in Ising-anisotropic magnets like spin ices."}

The coordination of silicate bioceramics with mono-dopants has been extensively studied to enhance their osteogenesis, angiogenesis, and antibacterial activity. However, the concept of employing dual or multiple co-doping to further enhance these biomaterials still demands more attention. This review paper originally focuses on the effect of chemical interactions among co-dopants and the principal constituents of the silicates, on the bio-behavior of these bioceramics.

The present work provides a detailed computational and theoretical study investigating the source of such discrepancy. Electronic spectroscopy data are calculated by time-dependent density function theory and then compared with experimental results. Electronic couplings between exciton donor and acceptor are estimated based on both transition density cube method and transition dipole approximation. These results confirm that the delocalization of exciton to the bridge parts contribute to significant enhancement of donor-acceptor electronic coupling. Mechanistic details of exciton transfer are examined by estimating the contributions of the bridge electronic states, vibrational modes of the dyads commonly coupled to both donor and acceptor, inelastic resonance energy transfer mechanism, and dark exciton states. These analyses suggest that the contribution of common vibrational modes serves as the main source of deviation from Förster's spectral overlap expression."}

Interestingly, recent experimental studies have suggested the preferential accumulation of $SO_4^{2-}$ ions at the $Na_2SO_{4,aq}$-graphene interface in disagreement with the generally known tendency of cations to accumulate at graphene-electrolyte interfaces. Herein, we resolve the atomistic structure of the $Na_2SO_{4,aq}$-graphene interfaces in the 0.1-2.0 M concentration range using machine learning interatomic potential-based simulations and simulated sum frequency generation (SFG) spectra to reveal the molecular origins of the conundrum. Our results show that Na+ ions accumulate between the outermost and second water layers whereas $SO_4^{2-}$ ions accumulate within the second interfacial water layer indicating cation dominated interfaces. We find that the interfacial region (within ~10 $Å$ of the graphene sheet) is negatively charged due to sub-stoichiometric $Na^+$/$SO_4^{2-}$ ratio at the interface. Our simulated SFG spectra show enhancement and a red-shift of the spectra in the hydrogen bonded region as a function of $Na_2SO_4$ concentration similar to measurements due to $SO_4^{2-}$-induced changes in the orientational order of water molecules in the second interfacial layer. Our study demonstrates that ion stratification and ion-induced water reorganization are key elements of understanding the electrolyte-graphene interface."}
