Here we report the observation of multi-branch excitonic Umklapp scattering in both electron and hole WCs realized in ultraclean monolayer WSe$_2$, exhibiting exceptionally high melting temperatures (T$_c$ $\\approx$ 20-30 K). Robust Wigner crystallization activates multiple finite-momentum optical resonances, including quasilinearly dispersing, light-like excitons and exciton polarons, extending far beyond the single excitonic Umklapp feature reported previously. Helicity-resolved magneto-optical measurements reveal a pronounced valley dependence of the scattering processes. Combined experiment and theory identify a polaron-induced brightening mechanism in which exciton polarons transfer oscillator strength from bright zero-momentum states to otherwise dark finite-momentum states, explaining the emergence of multiple Umklapp branches where conventional exciton-WC scattering is ineffective. These results establish WC polarons as a new quasiparticle paradigm and introduce polaron-induced Umklapp scattering as a general route to accessing finite-momentum many-body excitations in 2D quantum materials."}

Laughlin proposed an elegant explanation in which adiabatic insertion of a flux tube pumps charge through the system. This analysis unveils the fundamental role of gauge invariance and provides a compelling argument about the fractional charge of fractional quantum Hall states. While it has been used extensively as a theoretical tool, a quantitative experimental investigation is lacking despite multiple attempts. Here we report successful realizations of Laughlin pumping in several integer and fractional quantum Hall states. One essential technical innovation is using surface acoustic waves to periodically clear the charges accumulated during the pumping process. Magnetic fluxes are inserted at a constant rate so there is no need to perform complicated data fitting. Furthermore, our setting can reliably extract $σ_\\mathrm{xx}$ that is several orders of magnitude lower than the limit of conventional techniques. Effective energy gaps can be deduced from the temperature dependence of $σ_\\mathrm{xx}$, which are drastically different from those provided by conventional transport data. This work not only brings a famous gedanken experiment to reality but also serves as a portal for many future investigations."}

Many-body interactions with the filled massive Dirac fermion $ν= 1$ level yield a strong renormalization of the emission spectrum, including fully polarized emission, a pronounced redshift, and broadening relative to neutral and charged excitons.

The system is driven by terahertz radiation, and the spatial asymmetry required for the generation of dc photocurrent is introduced by a phase shift between the radiation's near-field modulation and the static electron density profile. In contrast to the commonly used perturbative \"minimal model\" of the ratchet effect, which assumes weak density modulation, we solve the problem exactly with respect to the static gate-induced potential while treating the radiation field perturbatively. This approach reveals a dramatic enhancement of the plasmonic contribution to the ratchet current due to the interference of \"bright\" and \"dark\" plasmon modes, which are excited on an equal footing in the asymmetric LPC. Specifically, we predict a parametric growth of the plasmonic peak as compared with the Drude peak with increasing coupling, and the appearance of a dense super-resonant structure when the spacing between plasmonic sub-bands becomes larger than the damping rate. Hence, the dc response exhibits both resonant and super-resonant regimes observed in recent experiments on the radiation transmission through the LPC. The interplay of bright and dark modes, together with their interference, provides a powerful mechanism for controlling the magnitude and sign of the photocurrent by gate voltages and the radiation frequency."}

While the original KL argument assumes continuous rotational symmetry, real materials possess only discrete point-group symmetries, raising a central question: can sufficiently strong symmetry breaking suppress or eliminate KL superconductivity? Using controlled perturbation theory and explicit two-dimensional models with Ising and Rashba spin--orbit coupling (SOC), we find that KL superconductivity is broadly robust and exhibits qualitatively universal behavior across models: the transition temperature $T_c$ is nonmonotonic in the symmetry-breaking field, shows a pronounced maximum at scales of the order of the Fermi energy, and decays exponentially toward zero at asymptotically large fields. However, the physical mechanisms determining this suppression may differ between models. Overall, these results demonstrate that KL-type superconductivity can persist across a wide class of spin--orbit-coupled systems."}

Compared to the widely used ANI-2x potential, PANIP delivers substantially lower errors, particularly for charged and strongly interacting dimers. Coupled with a fragmentation-based energy decomposition scheme, PANIP estimates protein-ligand binding energies at near force-field computational cost yet QM-level accuracy, enabling its use as a fragment-based scoring function that rivals specialized docking scoring functions."}

Building upon recent global well-posedness estimates [Hou, arXiv:2601.00638], this work generalizes the Multi-Scale Negative Coupled Information System (MNCIS) framework. We postulate that global stability requires an active topological operator -- Adaptive Spectral Negative Coupling (ASNC) -- functioning as a state-dependent high-pass filter that penalizes entropy accumulation at spectral boundaries. We validate this unified framework via three implementations:(1) Hydrodynamics: In 3D Navier-Stokes turbulence ($N=256^3$), ASNC acts as a global-enstrophy adaptive sub-grid scale (SGS) model, stabilizing the inviscid limit and preserving the Kolmogorov $-5/3$ inertial range without artificial hyper-viscosity.(2) Artificial Intelligence: Addressing Over-smoothing in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), we implement ASNC as a parameter-free topological constraint. Unlike baselines (e.g., DeepGCNs) relying on dense residual connections to bypass signal decay, our framework enables the training of ultra-deep 64-layer networks without residual connections, maintaining perfectly stationary feature variance ($σ^2 \\equiv 1.0$) on the ogbn-arxiv benchmark. (3) Biological Physics: In reaction-diffusion morphogenesis, it stabilizes Turing patterns against diffusive washout in high-entropy regimes. Our results suggest that the MNCIS framework provides a base-independent topological condition for distinguishing viable complex systems from those collapsing into thermal equilibrium, bridging physical stability and information persistence."}

While critical information about a material's charge dynamics is encoded in its plasmons, collective modes of the electron gas, these excitations have not yet been observed in nickelate materials. Here, we use resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) to detect plasmons in the metallic, low-valence nickelate Pr4Ni3O8. Although qualitatively similar to those in cuprates, the nickelate plasmons are more heavily damped and have a lower velocity than those in a cuprate at comparable doping, which we attribute to reduced electronic hopping and enhanced screening of the long-range Coulomb interactions. Furthermore, the plasmons in Pr4Ni3O8 soften with increasing temperature, in contrast to the cuprate, where plasmons remain at nearly fixed energy but become more strongly damped. Taken together, these results reveal a distinct charge-screening landscape in nickelates and place quantitative constraints on analogies to cuprates."}

While understanding of the anomaly in bulk materials remains incomplete, a version of this anomaly can be found in an ensemble of two-site systems and hence has been predicted to be observable in parallel-coupled double quantum dots. However, prior work did not include the influence of the leads. Here we show that the presence of the leads results in changes to the projected stability diagrams but that the signature of the strongly-correlated zero-bias anomaly nonetheless remains clearly visible."}

Starting from an effective three-orbital faithful Wannier model for the spin-locked moiré bands, combined with orbital-dependent Hubbard interactions, we analyze the evolution of magnetic instabilities as a function of carrier density using the matrix random phase approximation (mRPA) approach. By computing the Stoner boundary lines from the spin-valley susceptibilities over the electric-field by hole filling phase diagram, we show that the spin-valley instabilities result in ordered states in the region close to the Lifshitz transition at the topmost moiré valence band, marked by crossing of the van Hove singularity in the density of states. These spin-valley ordered states are dominated by interorbital spin-valley-flips involving the $MM$ and $MX$ moiré orbitals and occur at different momenta in each side of the van Hove line, indicating a distinct spatial dependence of the spin-valley order parameter depending on the hole filling. Moreover, the corresponding Stoner boundaries exhibit strong fluctuations on its flanks, which can favor superconducting states in the regions close to the spin-valley-ordered ones. This mechanism provides a natural description for a reentrant superconducting dome consistent with the experimental results. As such, our results suggest spin-valley fluctuations near the van-Hove line as the microscopic origin of the reentrant superconductivity in twisted WSe$_2$."}

An MCP server toolset enables the LLM to communicate programmatically with APS using Python, allowing it to execute complex simulation tasks from plain-language instructions. Two water-methanol separation case studies assess the framework across different task complexities and interaction modes. The first shows the agent autonomously analyzing flowsheets, finding improvement opportunities, and iteratively optimizing, extracting data, and presenting results clearly. The framework benefits both educational purposes, by translating technical concepts and demonstrating workflows, and experienced practitioners by automating data extraction, speeding routine tasks, and supporting brainstorming. The second case study assesses autonomous flowsheet synthesis through both a step-by-step dialogue and a single prompt, demonstrating its potential for novices and experts alike. The step-by-step mode gives reliable, guided construction suitable for educational contexts; the single-prompt mode constructs fast baseline flowsheets for later refinement.

Due to the inversion symmetry of the Hamiltonian and the spinor structure of the wave function, spin-wave eigenstates form doublets with definite parity. Micromagnetic simulation tallies well with numerical calculation. Our study on spin-wave eigenstates in CrSBr waveguides sheds light on the nature of exchange-dipole spin wave in ferromagnetic slabs.

The key result is that pathway selection is strongly correlated with the degree of ionization during the laser interaction, which is in turn strongly modulated by laser-molecule orientation. Higher early-time ionization predisposes the system toward near-simultaneous four-body breakup, whereas lower ionization favors sequential and three-body fragmentation; for low-ionization cases, a fragment-resolved charge metric further differentiates three-body and sequential behavior. These charge-dependent trends consistently map onto experimentally accessible observables: the simultaneous mechanism dominates the high-energy tail of the kinetic energy release (KER) spectrum and populate distinct regions of the emission-angle distributions, while sequential events concentrate at lower KER.

In this work, we introduce a Padé approximation to systematically reduces the number of zeros required in the Fisher, EPD, and MGF formulations without loss of accuracy. Moreover, since the Fisher zeros formulation does not rely on a convergence algorithm, their combination with a Padé approximation enables a reliable analysis of the XY model while significantly reducing computational cost. Applications to the two-dimensional Ising and XY models demonstrate substantial reductions in polynomial degree and computation time while preserving accurate estimates of the critical temperature."}

Very recently, people realized that the microscopic geometry of the entanglement cut can induce distinct entanglement-edge modes, whose coupling to bulk critical fluctuations may alter the scaling of the EE. However, this perception is very qualitative and lacks quantitative consideration. Here, we investigate this problem through high-precision quantum Monte Carlo simulations combined with the analysis of scaling theory to build a quantitative understanding. By considering three distinct bipartitions corresponding to three surface criticality types, we reveal a striking dependence of the constant term γ on the microscopic cut at the quantum critical point. Notably, cuts that generate extra gapless edge modes yield a sign reversal in γ compared to those producing gapped edges. We explain this behavior via a modified scaling form that incorporates contributions from both bulk and surface critical modes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the derivative of EE robustly extracts the bulk critical point and exponent ν regardless of the cut geometry, providing a reliable diagnostic of bulk universality in the presence of strong surface effects. Our work for the first time establishes a direct quantitative connection between surface criticality and entanglement scaling, challenging the conventional view that EE solely reflects bulk properties and offering a refined framework for interpreting entanglement in systems with boundary-sensitive criticality."}

By oscillating the strength of the attractive part of the potential, we find that the system can organize into either time-periodic states consisting of nondiffusive complex closed orbits, or into a diffusive fluctuating state. A critical point separates these states as a function of the maximum strength of the attraction, oscillation frequency, and particle density. We also find a re-entrant behavior of the reversible state as a function of the strength of the attraction and the oscillation frequency."}

A fundamental consequence of this symmetry breaking is orbital magnetization, yet a clear microscopic formulation of this quantity has remained elusive. This difficulty arises because Bogoliubov quasiparticles do not carry a definite electric charge, precluding a simple interpretation of orbital magnetization in terms of circulating quasiparticle currents. Moreover, superconductivity and ferromagnetism rarely coexist, and in the few materials where they do (e.g. uranium-based compounds), strong spin-orbit coupling obscures the orbital contribution to the magnetization. The recent report of chiral superconductivity in rhombohedral multilayer graphene, which has negligible spin-orbit coupling, therefore provides a unique opportunity to develop and test a microscopic theory of orbital magnetization in chiral superconductors. Here we develop such a theory, unifying the interband coherence effects underlying normal-state orbital magnetization with the intrinsic orbital moments of the Cooper-pair condensate. Applying our theory to rhombohedral tetralayer graphene, we find that the onset of superconductivity can either enhance or suppress the normal-state orbital magnetization, depending sensitively on the bandstructure. We further identify a generalized clapping mode corresponding to coherent fluctuations between the two opposite chiral windings of the p-wave order parameter, with a gap set by the sublattice winding form factor. This collective mode is unique to chiral superconductors and contributes to the orbital magnetization through its role in dressing the photon vertex. Experimental measurements of the orbital magnetization relative to the quarter-metal phase would provide a direct test of our theory."}

Above the Néel temperature ($T_{\\rm N}$), strong antiferromagnetic fluctuations dominate, characteristic of a paramagnetic state with pronounced spin-lattice relaxation rate enhancement. Below $T_{\\rm N}$, a first-order phase transition establishes a commensurate antiferromagnetic order, where Mn atoms at the pentagon corners exhibit distinct magnetic moments with different orientations, while the central Mn atom carries no magnetic moment. The complex magnetic architecture, revealed by zero-field and high-magnetic-field NMR spectra, contrasts with earlier neutron diffraction models proposing uniform spin density waves, instead supporting localized moments ordering with charge rearrangement. The proximity of robust antiferromagnetic fluctuations to the high-pressure superconducting phase suggests a potential role for magnetic excitations in mediating unconventional Cooper pairing, akin to paradigmatic high-$T_c$ systems.

Here, the molecular product channels for the decomposition dynamics of the smallest Criegee intermediate, H$_2$COO, are quantitatively investigated. Using a high-quality, full-dimensional machine learned potential energy surface (CASPT2/aug-cc-pVTZ), the translational, rotational, and vibrational energy distributions of the CO$_2$+H$_2$, H$_2$O+CO, and HCO+OH fragmentation channels were analyzed to elucidate partitioning of the available energy. The CO$_2$ + H$_2$ product forms through two different pathways that bifurcate after formation of the OCH$_2$O intermediate. Along the direct pathway, CO$_2$ is preferentially vibrationally excited with H$_2$in its vibrational ground state, whereas for the indirect pathway going through formic acid, H$_2$ can populate levels with $v > 0$. For all product channels passing through energized formic acid, the lifetime distributions are described by stretched exponentials with $β$ ranging from 1.1 to 1.7. This is a clear signature of non-RRKM effects and suggests that the explicit molecular dynamics needs to be followed for a quantitative and realistic description of the photodissociation dynamics."}

By introducing a magnetic flux variable that couples nonlinearly to the membrane potential, we demonstrate that electromagnetic effects profoundly reshape neuronal firing patterns and bifurcation structure. Interspike-interval bifurcation analysis reveals a nonmonotonic dependence on the magnetic coupling strength, with weak coupling preserving regular spiking and bursting, intermediate coupling promoting chaotic bursting, and strong coupling yielding structured irregular dynamics. These transitions are quantitatively characterized using the largest Lyapunov exponent computed via the Wolf algorithm and supported by Poincaré sections and time-series analysis. Our results establish electromagnetic feedback as a robust and tunable mechanism for controlling instability and chaos in slow-fast neuronal systems."}

While the magnetic responses on the ordered phases can be mundane, the orbital magnetic flux and the Zeeman coupling have synergetic effects on the internal gauge flux generations in the relevant spin liquid phases. The former was known to induce an internal U(1) gauge flux indirectly through the charge fluctuations and ring exchange, and thus could lead to the formation of a chiral spin liquid. The latter could spontaneously generate a uniform field-dependent internal gauge flux, driving a conically-ordered state. The competition and interplay between these two field effects are discussed through a generic spin-1/2 $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_χ$ model and with the experimental consequences. Our results could find applications in the moiré superlattice systems with the Hofstadter-Hubbard model as well as the triangular lattice antiferromagnets."}

Its magnetically intercalated analogue, Co$_{1/3}$TaS$_2$, introduces additional degrees of freedom, including modified interlayer coupling and magnetism, to modulate spin-valley physics. Surface-sensitive probes like ARPES are essential for accessing surface spin texture, yet previous studies on 2$\\it{H}$-TMDs have reported conflicting results regarding spin-polarized bands, leaving open whether these discrepancies are intrinsic or extrinsic. Here we performed spatially resolved spin-ARPES measurements on 2$\\it{H}$-TaS$_2$ and Co$_{1/3}$TaS$_2$. Our results reveal robust spin-valley locking on both compounds. Importantly, Co intercalation enhances interlayer hybridization and introduces magnetism while preserving the TaS$_2$-derived spin texture. We further observe a spatial reversal of the out-of-plane spin polarization, which we attribute to different surface domains. This effect complicates quantifying spin textures and may underlie prior inconsistent observations. Our findings provide microscopic insight into how interlayer interactions and surface domains together govern spin-valley phenomena in layered TMDs."}

By maximizing Shannon entropy over a joint distribution of actions and endpoints, subject to normalization and a constraint on the mean action, we obtain a Boltzmann-like distribution in action space. This framework reproduces the standard Brownian propagator in the nonrelativistic limit and naturally extends to relativistic regimes, where the Wiener construction fails to preserve Lorentz covariance. The approach bypasses functional integration over paths, makes the role of entropic degeneracy explicit through an action-space density of states, and provides a transparent connection between the principle of least action and statistical inference. We derive the density of states explicitly using large deviation theory, showing that it takes a Gaussian form centered at the minimal action, and rigorously justify the saddle-point approximation in the diffusive regime. The Markovian property of the resulting propagator is verified to hold via the Chapman--Kolmogorov equation, following from the additivity of the minimal action for free-particle dynamics. In the diffusive regime, the resulting dynamics are governed by a competition between extremization of the action and entropic effects, which can be interpreted in terms of an effective action free energy.

Here, we present a comprehensive library of complex refractive indices (n,k) for a technologically relevant set of FA based lead perovskites, spanning bromide compositions from 0 to 100 percent, and mixed Pb Sn perovskites with Sn fractions from 0 to 60 %. Using state of the art fabrication protocols that yield high quality films, we combine variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements with highly sensitive sub bandgap probes, including photothermal deflection spectroscopy for neat lead based perovskites and Fourier transform photocurrent spectroscopy for Pb Sn alloys, to reconstruct fully zeroed dielectric functions across and below the band edge. The measured data are then stitched and recalculated via a Kramers Kronig consistent framework, ensuring physically accurate behaviour across the full spectral range. Finally, we introduce a transformation based interpolation scheme that preserves spectral shape and feature alignment, enabling reliable determination of (n,k) for any intermediate composition or band gap. This complete dataset and interpolation protocol provide a standardized foundation for optical modelling of perovskite and tandem solar cells, addressing longstanding data gaps and supporting accurate simulations of next generation photovoltaic architectures."}

We further analyze the full magnon-phonon spectrum and uncover directional hybridization and absorption, leading to asymmetric phonon propagation lengths for opposite directions. Our results indicate that such interfacial spin-lattice coupling can serve as an efficient route to achieve nonreciprocal phonon propagation properties in magnetic heterostructures with strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling."}

The sampling efficiency of the RXMC method depends highly on the selection of the temperatures, and finding optimal temperatures remains a challenge. In this study, we propose a refined online temperature selection method by extending the gradient-based optimization framework proposed previously. Building upon the existing temperature update approach, we introduce a reparameterization technique to strictly enforce physical constraints, such as the monotonic ordering of inverse temperatures, which were not explicitly addressed in the original formulation. The proposed method defines the variance of acceptance rates between adjacent replicas as a loss function, estimates its gradient using differential information from the sampling process, and optimizes the temperatures via gradient descent. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through experiments on benchmark spin systems, including the two-dimensional ferromagnetic Ising model, the two-dimensional ferromagnetic XY model, and the three-dimensional Edwards-Anderson model. Our results show that the method successfully achieves uniform acceptance rates and reduces round-trip times across the temperature space. Furthermore, our proposed method offers a significant advantage over recently proposed policy gradient method that require careful hyperparameter tuning, while simultaneously preventing the constraint violations that destabilize optimization."}

Leveraging these ideas, we develop a self-consistent field (SCF) scheme that expresses the mean-field energy as a functional of the single-particle density matrix, providing an alternative to gradient-based optimization of Thouless parameters.

We demonstrate that mass asymmetry sets the overall transmission profile, including the angular distribution and the resonance channels. In contrast, we show that quantum geometry provides a universal parameter that modulates tunneling efficiency by tuning the quantum distance, while leaving the energy dispersion unchanged. Specifically, quantum geometry plays a dual role: it governs the overall transmission amplitude through pseudospin mismatch, while its interplay with Fabry-Perot interference induces observable shifts in resonance angles.

Unlike projector-based or momentum-space-based approaches, our method does not rely on translational symmetry, spectral gaps in the Hamiltonian's bulk, or gapped auxiliary operators such as spin projections, and instead provides a local, energy-resolved topological invariant accompanied by an intrinsic measure of topological protection. A central contribution of this work is the development of a scalable sparse factorization algorithm that enables the reliable determination of the Pfaffian's sign for large sparse matrices, making the approach practical to realistic physical materials. We apply this framework to identify the quantum spin Hall effect in quasicrystalline class AII systems, including gapless heterostructures, and to diagnose fragile topology in a large $C_2 \\mathcal{T}$-symmetric photonic quasicrystal.

A classical two-state Markov process is embedded into a dissipative two-level quantum system by identifying the Markov relaxation rate with the dissipation parameter in a von Neumann equation with a relaxation term. Using the reduced extended density matrix in the TFD formalism, we explicitly separate classical thermal mixing from intrinsic quantum entanglement. For a minimal exchange-like two-level subspace, we obtain a closed-form expression for the intrinsic entanglement component, $b_{qe}(t)=\\frac{1}{4}e^{-λt}\\sin^2(ωt)$, demonstrating that a single classical timescale controls the decay envelope of genuine entanglement. We further show that the extended entanglement entropy naturally decomposes into a classical Shannon-type contribution and a purely quantum entanglement contribution, clarifying how stochastic relaxation constrains entanglement loss in a minimal setting."}

Its magnetically intercalated analogue, Co$_{1/3}$TaS$_2$, introduces additional degrees of freedom, including modified interlayer coupling and magnetism, to modulate spin-valley physics. Surface-sensitive probes like ARPES are essential for accessing surface spin texture, yet previous studies on 2$\\it{H}$-TMDs have reported conflicting results regarding spin-polarized bands, leaving open whether these discrepancies are intrinsic or extrinsic. Here we performed spatially resolved spin-ARPES measurements on 2$\\it{H}$-TaS$_2$ and Co$_{1/3}$TaS$_2$. Our results reveal robust spin-valley locking on both compounds. Importantly, Co intercalation enhances interlayer hybridization and introduces magnetism while preserving the TaS$_2$-derived spin texture. We further observe a spatial reversal of the out-of-plane spin polarization, which we attribute to different surface domains. This effect complicates quantifying spin textures and may underlie prior inconsistent observations. Our findings provide microscopic insight into how interlayer interactions and surface domains together govern spin-valley phenomena in layered TMDs."}

This paper aims to tackle this problem within the general synthetic iterative scheme (GSIS), where the Boltzmann kinetic equation is solved deterministically in an outer loop and macroscopic synthetic equations are solved in an inner loop. To avoid kinetic-macroscopic boundary-flux mismatch and the resulting convergence bottlenecks, for the macroscopic boundary flux at every inner iteration, the incident increment is estimated using a Maxwellian distribution, and then the reflected contribution is obtained by boundary conditions consistent with those in the kinetic solver. In addition to retaining the fast-converging and asymptotic-preserving properties of GSIS, the proposed method significantly reduces the iterations required to determine the wall-reflected gas parameters. Numerical simulations of rarefied gas flows in and around a 3D nozzle, a 2D adiabatic cylinder, and a 2D annular heat-transfer configuration show good agreement with the direct simulation Monte Carlo method, while achieving substantial efficiency gains over conventional iterative schemes."}

While this control has been demonstrated by using an external magnetic flux, ideally it can be achieved with control over intrinsic system parameters. In this work, we investigate whether the relevant phase differences can be tuned through the spin degree of freedom in each QD, or the chemical potential of the discrete bound states in the hybrid sections. We confirm that both these tuning knobs allow for controlling the phase difference in the couplings between neighbouring QDs, bypassing the requirement to tune an external flux.

We analytically derive closed expressions for the Lanczos coefficients of Majorana fermion operators of the impurity for different structures of the coupling to the hybridisation band at zero temperature. While the model remains quadratic, we find that the growth of the Lanczos coefficients structurally depends strongly on the chosen coupling. Concretely, we find $(i)$ approximately constant, $(ii)$ exactly constant, $(iii)$ square root-like as well $(iv)$ linear growth in the same model. We further argue that in fact through suitably chosen couplings, essentially arbitrary Lanczos coefficients can be obtained in this model. These altogether evince the inadequacy of the Lanczos coefficients as a reliable criterion for classifying the integrability or chaoticity of the systems. Eventually, in the wide-band limit, we find exponential decay of autocorrelation functions in all the settings $(i)-(iv)$, which demonstrates the different structures of the Lanczos coefficients not being indicative of different physical behavior."}

The existence of a comparable, universal force for systems undergoing a first-order transition has remained an unresolved fundamental question. The proposed Orderphobic Effect is one such potential mechanism. It arises from minimisation of the interfacial free energy between solutes that locally nucleate a disordered phase. Here, we report the first experimental demonstration and quantitative measurement of the Orderphobic Effect. Using a driven, non-equilibrium quasi-2D granular fluid undergoing a first-order order-disorder transition, we show that specifically designed solutes in an ordered phase nucleate a coexisting ``bubble'' of the disordered phase. By analysing its capillary fluctuations, we confirm that this phenomenon occurs due to the proximity to phase-coexistence, and we directly quantify the attractive force by measuring the interaction free energy between solutes. The observation of this general fluctuation-mediated force in a non-equilibrium steady state strongly supports its claimed universality. Our work establishes the Orderphobic Effect as the first-order equivalent to the CCE, providing a new, general route for controlling self-assembly and aggregation in soft matter and non-equilibrium systems."}

However, it is not possible to visualize the rapid growth dynamics using conventional imaging techniques. In this study, we demonstrate in-situ real-time observation of silver nanoparticle (AgNP) growth dynamics at the single-particle level using high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM). We employed a photoreduction method, which enables reliable control of AgNP formation by laser irradiation. By integrating a stand-alone tip-scan HS-AFM with an optical setup for photoreduction, we successfully captured real-time movies showing the nucleation and subsequent growth of AgNPs at the single-particle level. Furthermore, quantitative single-particle analysis revealed particle-to-particle variations in growth dynamics. The growth dynamics were further studied at different laser intensities, revealing intensity-dependent growth rates and the balance between nucleation and growth.

By deriving local estimators suitable for advanced numerical methods, we demonstrate that these metrics effectively characterize quantum phase transitions: in the one-dimensional spinless $t$-$V$ model, they sharply identify the Luttinger liquid to charge density wave transition, while in the two-dimensional honeycomb lattice via determinant quantum Monte Carlo, they faithfully capture the critical exponents of the Gross-Neveu-Ising universality class. Furthermore, extending our analysis to the fractional quantum Hall regime, we unveil a non-trivial spatial texture of magic in the Laughlin state, revealing signatures of short-range exclusion correlations.

Here, we propose a unified theoretical framework for the CCI states in MATBG that successfully explains most experimental observations. The key insight of our theory is that, due to the very narrow bandwidth of MATBG, correlation-enhanced valley and spin Zeeman terms are critical for shaping the intricate Hofstadter spectrum, resulting in an interwoven, flavor-resolved (spin and valley) Hofstadter spectrum that can well describe the observed CCI states. Crucially, due to the Zeeman effect, the crossings between these flavor-polarized Hofstadter spectra are magnetic-field-dependent, causing certain CCI states to emerge only above a critical field. This is the main mechanism underlying the critical field phenomenon of the CCI states observed in experiments. Our theory provides a clear and unified physical picture for the correlated Hofstadter spectrum in MATBG."}

The concentration and distribution of carbon impurity inside the samples is estimated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The resistivity vs temperature and electric field dependences of the SPS ceramics with different carbon concentration have been studied. It is shown that their conduction is determined by the variable range hopping mechanism and obeys the Mott law. The density of localized states and localization radius of the electron wave function are determined. The difference in low-temperature resistivity of the SPS ceramics is caused by carbon concentration and connected with it variation of the dielectric permittivity. The relative dielectric permittivity of the SPS ceramics is colossal and reaches the values of 10^5 - 10^6 order. The larger carbon concentration is, the smaller the permittivity and resistivity are within the Mott hopping conduction temperature range. In the range from 250 K to 408 K one observes that the dielectric permittivity strongly increases forming a maximum in all samples, which may be related to the phase transition. Along with this, resistivity manifests a simultaneous sharp decrease. The decrease of resistivity along with the characteristic dependence of resistivity vs dielectric permittivity in the Mott conduction temperature range, evidences the validity of Heywang model for the description of SPS ceramics conduction mechanisms. The resistivity strongly decreases with increasing frequency in the AC regime, which agrees both with models of hopping conduction and effects based on the Maxwell-Wagner model.

Within this framework, superconductivity arises from the formation of a symmetry-broken superconducting configuration (SCC) generated by atomic perturbations of the normal conducting configuration (NCC). The SCC emerges through electron-phonon interaction and gives rise to distinct straight one-dimensional tunnels (SODTs) in the charge density difference of electrons and/or holes. These SODTs originate from regular and systematic atomic displacements between the SCC and NCC, a phenomenon revealed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. To further verify this framework, we performed DFT-based calculations for 12 hexagonal close-packed (hcp) elements (Be, Mg, Sc, Y, Ti, Zr, Hf, Tc, Re, Ru, Os, and Zn), 5 body-centered cubic (bcc) elements (V, Nb, Ta, Mo, and W), and the compound Nb3Sn.

Achieving this goal, however, requires an in-depth mechanistic understanding of the underlying dynamical processes. As a step in this direction, we present a systematic and numerically exact quantum dynamical study of cooperative reaction dynamics inside an optical microcavity. Using a hierarchy of model systems with increasing complexity, we elucidate how cavity-modified reactivity emerges from-and is highly sensitive to-subtle structural and environmental variations. Our models consist of optically dark reactive molecules, each represented by a symmetric double well potential, coupled to infrared-active non-reactive intramolecular or solvent vibrational modes, as well as their respective dissipative environments. Our results demonstrate that cavity-induced rate modifications arise from a delicate interplay among mode hybridization in strong-coupling regimes, the dynamical balance of all participating energy exchange processes, and quantum interference between multiple fluctuation-dissipation-mediated reaction pathways enabled by collective cavity coupling. By continuously tuning a single system parameter or introducing molecular collectivity, we observe qualitatively distinct rate modification profiles as functions of the cavity frequency, including resonant rate enhancement, resonant rate suppression, hybridization-induced peak splitting, and, notably, asymmetric Fano-type line shapes in which enhancement peaks and suppression dips coexist within a narrow resonance window, highlighting the important role of quantum interference in cavity-modified chemical reactivity."}

Our results show that the underestimation of $T_c$ primarily stems from the limitations of the exchange-correlation functional, rather than inaccuracies in the MLFF fitting. We uncover a critical interplay between finite-size effects and the range of interatomic interactions: although short-range MLFFs appear to yield better agreement with experimental $T_c$, this improvement results from a fortuitous cancellation of errors. Incorporating explicit long-range interactions improves accuracy for larger supercells but ultimately leads to lower predicted $T_c$ values. These findings highlight that accurate finite-temperature predictions require not only high-quality training data and sufficiently large simulation cells, but also the explicit treatment of long-range interactions and improved exchange-correlation functionals."}

A. Müller as the \"drosophila of solid-state physics\", has been extensively investigated over the last seventy five years for its intricate coupling of structural, electronic, and dielectric properties and continues to serve as a foundational platform for advancing oxide electronics. In its pristine form, SrTiO$_3$ exhibits quantum paraelectric behavior below 35 K and undergoes an antiferrodistortive phase transition near 105 K. This transition generates ferroelastic twin domains separated by a dense network of domain walls, which function as nanoscale structural defects with far-reaching consequences. While the static influence of ferroelastic domain walls on carrier transport in electron-doped SrTiO$_3$ is well established, recent experimental results show that the emergence of polarity at these walls, combined with strain fields and inherent quantum fluctuations, induces correlated dynamical phenomena such as glass-like relaxations of electrons and memory effects. In this review, we highlight these recent advances, focusing on the subtle interplay between the emergence of nanoscale polar order, quantum fluctuations, and long-range strain fields. We propose that understanding charge carrier dynamics in the background of these complex ferroelastic domain wall landscapes offers a new paradigm for exploring electronic transport in the presence of local polar order and quantum fluctuations, with broad implications for correlated oxides."}

Using a Wurster-type tetratopic amine (W-NH$_2$) and a series of anthracene-based dialdehydes bearing H, Cl, Br, or I at the 2-position, a family of imine-linked COFs, W-A-X (X = H, Cl, Br, I), was synthesized, all displaying well-ordered porous structures. The halogen substituent strongly influences framework formation, with brominated COFs forming substantially larger crystalline domains than their chloro- and iodo-functionalized analogues. UV-vis absorption and photoluminescence measurements reveal a systematic redshift across the series $(\\mathrm{H < Cl < Br < I})$, demonstrating that a single-atom modification effectively tunes the optical response. Time-dependent density functional theory calculations on both isolated fragments and extended COF models attribute these trends to halogen-induced changes in the COF band structure and provide a mechanistic understanding of how single-atom substitution influences the optoelectronic properties of the extended $π$-framework. Overall, this study establishes single-atom halogen substitution as a powerful and modular strategy for tailoring the structural and optical properties of anthracene-based COFs."}

Examples include intracellular transport via stochastically gated ion channels and pores in the plasma membrane of a cell, intercellular transport between cells coupled by stochastically gated gap junctions, and oxygen transport in insect respiration. Most studies of stochastically-gated interfaces are based on macroscopic models that track the particle concentration averaged with respect to different realisations of the gate dynamics. In this paper we use renewal theory to develop a probabilistic model of single-particle Brownian motion (BM) through a stochastically gated interface. We proceed by constructing a renewal equation for 1D BM with an interface at the origin, which effectively sews together a sequence of BMs on the half-line with a totally absorbing boundary at $x=0$. Each time the particle is absorbed, the stochastic process is immediately restarted according to the following rule: if the gate is closed then BM restarts on the same side of the interface, whereas if the gate is open then BM restarts on either side of the interface with equal probability. In order to ensure that diffusion restarts in a state that avoids immediate re-absorption. we assume that whenever the particle reaches the interface it is instantaneously shifted a distance $ε$ from the origin. We explicitly solve the renewal equation for $ε>0$ and show how the solution of a corresponding forward Kolmogorov equation is recovered in the limit $ε\\rightarrow 0$. However, the renewal equation provides a more general mathematical framework by explicitly separating the first passage time problem of detecting the gated interface (absorption) and the subsequent rule for restarting BM. We conclude by extending the theory to higher-dimensional interfaces."}

Robust Wigner crystallization activates multiple finite-momentum optical resonances, including quasilinearly dispersing, light-like excitons and exciton polarons, extending far beyond the single excitonic Umklapp feature reported previously.

Combined experiment and theory identify a polaron-induced brightening mechanism in which exciton polarons transfer oscillator strength from bright zero-momentum states to otherwise dark finite-momentum states, explaining the emergence of multiple Umklapp branches where conventional exciton-WC scattering is ineffective.

Applying this approach to twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ modeled by first-principles-derived moiré Hamiltonians, we find that the first moiré valence band is dominated by the generalized zeroth LL across a broad range of twist angles, facilitating the formation of Abelian fractional Chern insulators in the Jain sequences. The second moiré band, renormalized via Hartree-Fock calculations at hole filling $ν_h = 2$, is dominated by the generalized first LL at twist angles $θ= 2.45^\\circ$ and $2.13^\\circ$. At $θ= 2.45^\\circ$, we find numerical evidence for a non-Abelian Moore--Read (MR) state at $ν_h = 5/2$, with consistent signatures in both the energy spectrum and the particle entanglement spectrum. Interpolation studies further demonstrate an adiabatic connection between this state and the MR state in the conventional first LL.

Here, we demonstrate electrical transport measurements of niobium nitride (NbN) devices inside a TEM using a continuous-flow liquid-helium-cooled sample holder.

The Kerr rotation is sensitive to time-reversal symmetry breaking and generally proportional to magnetization, enabling optical readout of the up and down spin states in ferromagnets. By contrast, antiferromagnets with a collinear antiparallel spin arrangement have long been considered inactive to such magneto-optical responses, because of Tt-symmetry (time-reversal T followed by translation t symmetry) and lack of macroscopic magnetization. Here, we report the observation of giant magneto-optical Kerr effect in a room-temperature antiferromagnetic insulator alpha-Fe2O3. In this compound, the up-down and down-up spin states induce the opposite sign of spontaneous Kerr effect, whose Kerr rotation angle turned out to be exceptionally large (~ 80 mdeg, comparable to typical ferromagnets). Our first-principles calculations successfully reproduce both the absolute magnitude and spectral shape of the Kerr rotation and ellipticity with remarkable accuracy, which unambiguously proves that it originates from a Tt-symmetry-broken collinear antiferromagnetic order, rather than magnetization. This compound hosts temperature-dependent transition between easy-plane and easy-axis antiferromagnetic states, and their contrasting behaviors are also investigated in detail. The present results demonstrate that even a simple collinear antiferromagnetic order can induce a giant magneto-optical Kerr effect, and highlight Tt-symmetry-broken antiferromagnets as a promising material platform for highly sensitive optical detection of up-down and down-up spin states."}

Finding the minimum of such a function, which is a variant of the minimum linear arrangement problem, provides the DMRG with an efficient layout of the lattice and improves both accuracy and convergence time. We present applications to the antiferromagnetic and spin glass spin-1/2 models on the square and triangular lattices."}

We use first-principles density functional theory and statistical mechanics to investigate the crystallographic, electronic, and thermodynamic properties of rutile $\\text{Sn}_{1-x}\\text{Ge}_x\\text{O}_2$ alloys. We predict that the lattice parameters follow Vegard's law, while band gaps calculated with the hybrid HSE06 functional exhibit strong bowing, consistent with experiment. We also predict that the disordered phase has a large positive mixing enthalpy and a slight tendency for Ge-Sn clustering, indicated by weakly negative short-range order parameters. This large positive mixing enthalpy produces a miscibility gap with a critical temperature above 2300 K, implying that the high Ge and Sn solubilities observed in thin-film synthesis cannot be explained by the incoherent phase diagram alone. We demonstrate that coherency strain during epitaxial growth substantially alters phase stability. Calculations of the coherent spinodal show significant suppression of the miscibility gap, reducing the critical temperature to $\\approx 900$ K. These coherent phase boundaries account for the experimentally observed high solubilities at typical growth temperatures. Our results indicate that coherency strain stabilizes these metastable alloys and enables bandgap engineering in this ultrawide-bandgap material system."}

By systematically combining the Poisson equation, corrector construction, and martingale decomposition, we show that both the long-time drift and diffusion of overdamped Brownian motion can be derived within a single and transparent scheme. In the absence of external tilt, the formalism naturally recovers the classical Lifson-Jackson formula for the effective diffusion coefficient. When a constant bias is applied, breaking detailed balance and inducing a finite stationary current, the same approach yields the Stratonovich expressions for the effective drift and diffusion in tilted periodic potentials. Beyond one dimension, we demonstrate that the same additive-functional structure extends directly to two-dimensional and general N dimensional periodic diffusions, leading to the standard homogenized drift and diffusion tensor expressed in terms of vector-valued correctors. Our derivation highlights the central role of additive functionals in separating bounded microscopic corrections from unbounded macroscopic transport and clarifies the connection between reversible and nonequilibrium steady states. This work provides a conceptually unified and mathematically controlled route to transport coefficients in periodic media, with direct relevance to stochastic transport, soft matter, and nonequilibrium statistical physics."}

Here, we use resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) to detect plasmons in the metallic, low-valence nickelate Pr4Ni3O8. Although qualitatively similar to those in cuprates, the nickelate plasmons are more heavily damped and have a lower velocity than those in a cuprate at comparable doping, which we attribute to reduced electronic hopping and enhanced screening of the long-range Coulomb interactions. Furthermore, the plasmons in Pr4Ni3O8 soften with increasing temperature, in contrast to the cuprate, where plasmons remain at nearly fixed energy but become more strongly damped. Taken together, these results reveal a distinct charge-screening landscape in nickelates and place quantitative constraints on analogies to cuprates."}

This work provides explicit equations of motion for studying the real- and imaginary-time evolution of spin-1/2 Hamiltonians with arbitrary geometries and interactions. We extend previous formulations of parity-preserving fermionic mean-field theory (PP-FMFT) by including fermionic displacement operators in the variational Ansatz. Unlike PP-FMFT, PV-FMFT can be applied to general spin-1/2 Hamiltonians, describe quenches from arbitrary initial spin-1/2 product states, and compute local and non-local observables in a straight-forward manner at the same modest computational cost as PP-FMFT -- scaling as $O(N^3)$ in the worst case for a system of $N$ spins or fermionic modes. We demonstrate that PV-FMFT can exactly capture the imaginary- and real-time dynamics of non-interacting spin-1/2 Hamiltonians. We then study the post quench-dynamics of the one- and two-dimensional Ising model in presence of longitudinal and transversal fields with PV-FMFT and compute the single site magnetization and correlation functions, and compare them against results from other state-of-the-art numerical approaches. In two-dimensional spin systems, we show that the employed spin-to-fermion mapping can break rotational symmetry within the PV-FMFT description, and we discuss the resulting consequences for the calculated correlation functions.

While this control has been demonstrated by using an external magnetic flux, ideally it can be achieved with control over intrinsic system parameters. In this work, we investigate whether the relevant phase differences can be tuned through the spin degree of freedom in each QD, or the chemical potential of the discrete bound states in the hybrid sections. We confirm that both these tuning knobs allow for controlling the phase difference in the couplings between neighbouring QDs, bypassing the requirement to tune an external flux.

This enhanced interlayer electronic coupling gives rise to excitons delocalized across the two layers with a strong polarization dependence that reflects the details of the interlayer spin alignment. Our results reveal a sensitive interplay between twist angle, magnetism, and excitonic properties in twin-stacked CrSBr bilayers, and they establish twin stacking as an effective route to engineering interlayer coupling and optical response in anisotropic two-dimensional magnets with rectangular lattices."}

Here, we numerically investigate this unexplored coarsening of clusters in 2D growing interfaces believed to belong to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class. Using a two-point spatial correlator, we demonstrate statistical time invariance of the evolving configurations and identify scaling forms shared across distinct models. We reveal a pronounced asymmetry in the growth of the largest clusters: one cluster emerges as a giant structure whose characteristic length exceeds the correlation length. Population-dependent scaling forms for the number densities of cluster areas are uncovered.

While the original KL argument assumes continuous rotational symmetry, real materials possess only discrete point-group symmetries, raising a central question: can sufficiently strong symmetry breaking suppress or eliminate KL superconductivity? Using controlled perturbation theory and explicit two-dimensional models with Ising and Rashba spin--orbit coupling (SOC), we find that KL superconductivity is broadly robust and exhibits qualitatively universal behavior across models: the transition temperature $T_c$ is nonmonotonic in the symmetry-breaking field, shows a pronounced maximum at scales of the order of the Fermi energy, and decays exponentially toward zero at asymptotically large fields. However, the physical mechanisms determining this suppression may differ between models. Overall, these results demonstrate that KL-type superconductivity can persist across a wide class of spin--orbit-coupled systems."}

In this work, we investigate phonon dynamics originating from an acoustic analog - the surface phonon Hall viscosity - that can also occur at the surface of magnetic topological insulators. This surface phonon Hall viscosity stems from the Nieh-Yan action in the strain response of topological insulators, where strain acts as the effective vierbein field for the bulk low-energy massive Dirac fermions. Crucially, this viscosity term entangles phonon dynamics with surface magnetization. In magnetic topological insulator films, we find that this interaction causes acoustic phonons to become chiral when the magnetization at the top and bottom surfaces is parallel, and nonreciprocal when it is anti-parallel. We further discuss potential experimental signatures of phonon dynamics induced by surface phonon Hall viscosity, specifically the phonon thermal Hall effect and magnon-polarons. Surface phonon Hall viscosity provides a mechanism to control phonon chirality and nonreciprocity via surface magnetization configurations in magnetic topological insulator films."}

Yet molecular models that predictively connect phase structure, pH-dependent surface chemistry, electrolyte organization, and adsorption across operating conditions remain limited. Here we introduce a unified INTERFACE Force Field (IFF) parameterization together with a curated, ready-to-use pH-resolved surface model database that provides the most accurate and transferable atomistic description of major alumina phases to date. The framework covers a-Al2O3, g-Al2O3, boehmite, diaspore, and gibbsite using a single, physically interpretable parameter set that is directly compatible with CHARMM, AMBER, OPLS-AA, CVFF, and PCFF. Across structural, thermodynamic, mechanical, and interfacial benchmarks, simulations reproduce experimental reference data with more than 95 percent accuracy, exceeding existing force fields and the reliability of current density-functional approaches. A key advance is the first transferable treatment of surface ionization and charge regulation across alumina phases over a broad range of pH values, enabling simulations of realistic solid electrolyte interfaces without phase-specific reparameterization. Quantitative reliability is demonstrated by reproducing trends in zeta potentials and pH-dependent adsorption of a corrosion inhibitor at alumina-water interfaces. Predicted adsorption free energies and surface contact times correlate with experiments across more than an order of magnitude. Relative to ML-DFT workflows, the speed 100 to 1000 times faster, reaching system sizes and time scales inaccessible to quantum methods.

As more particles are introduced, they inevitably populate higher energy bands. Whether the inclusion of multiple topological bands leads to new physics remains an open question. Here, we propose a universal picture applicable at higher filling factors $ν\\geq 1$ in bosonic systems: the occupied bands tend to coalesce into an effective single topological band characterized by a total Chern number $\\vert C\\vert$, the sum of the Chern number of all occupied lower topological flat bands. Using a Kekulé lattice model with two lower flat bands featuring a total Chern number $C=1$, regardless of their specific configurations, we identify the emergence of a $\\frac{1}{2}$ fractional Chern insulator (FCI) state at integer filling factor $ν=1$, followed by the Jain sequence states $\\frac{2}{3}$ and $\\frac{3}{4}$ at filling $ν=\\frac{4}{3}$ and $\\frac{6}{4}$.

In this paper we provide a general model that gives the picture for the evolution and transition from typical ferroelectricity to long displacement ferroelectricity, which is classified into type-I and type-II. In particular, type-I with two switching modes of different barriers may switch between conventional ferroelectricity and ion-conduction-like ferroelectricity depending on various factors including electric field, boundaries, vacancies, temperature, etc.., which is demonstrated by first-principles calculations on γ-AlOOH and CuInP2S6 as two paradigmatic cases. Intriguingly, their polarizations are nonlocal since the boundaries also determine the switching mode and polarization direction, which can be different for the same given crystal structure. Such type-I can be evolved from conventional ferroelectricity as the migration barrier across unitcell is reduced, and will behave like type-II at elevated temperature as the conventional part becomes paraelectric. These unconventional behaviors can be applicable to various systems, and many previously unclarified phenomena can be well explained."}

The concentration and distribution of carbon impurity inside the samples is estimated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The resistivity vs temperature and electric field dependences of the SPS ceramics with different carbon concentration have been studied. It is shown that their conduction is determined by the variable range hopping mechanism and obeys the Mott law. The density of localized states and localization radius of the electron wave function are determined. The difference in low-temperature resistivity of the SPS ceramics is caused by carbon concentration and connected with it variation of the dielectric permittivity. The relative dielectric permittivity of the SPS ceramics is colossal and reaches the values of 10^5 - 10^6 order. The larger carbon concentration is, the smaller the permittivity and resistivity are within the Mott hopping conduction temperature range. In the range from 250 K to 408 K one observes that the dielectric permittivity strongly increases forming a maximum in all samples, which may be related to the phase transition. Along with this, resistivity manifests a simultaneous sharp decrease. The decrease of resistivity along with the characteristic dependence of resistivity vs dielectric permittivity in the Mott conduction temperature range, evidences the validity of Heywang model for the description of SPS ceramics conduction mechanisms. The resistivity strongly decreases with increasing frequency in the AC regime, which agrees both with models of hopping conduction and effects based on the Maxwell-Wagner model. The studied SPS BaTiO3 ceramics are attractive for applications in energy storage and sensorics."}

The system is driven by terahertz radiation, and the spatial asymmetry required for the generation of dc photocurrent is introduced by a phase shift between the radiation's near-field modulation and the static electron density profile. In contrast to the commonly used perturbative \"minimal model\" of the ratchet effect, which assumes weak density modulation, we solve the problem exactly with respect to the static gate-induced potential while treating the radiation field perturbatively. This approach reveals a dramatic enhancement of the plasmonic contribution to the ratchet current due to the interference of \"bright\" and \"dark\" plasmon modes, which are excited on an equal footing in the asymmetric LPC. Specifically, we predict a parametric growth of the plasmonic peak as compared with the Drude peak with increasing coupling, and the appearance of a dense super-resonant structure when the spacing between plasmonic sub-bands becomes larger than the damping rate. Hence, the dc response exhibits both resonant and super-resonant regimes observed in recent experiments on the radiation transmission through the LPC. The interplay of bright and dark modes, together with their interference, provides a powerful mechanism for controlling the magnitude and sign of the photocurrent by gate voltages and the radiation frequency."}

In particular, the piezoelectric response of materials such as lithium niobate enables coupling between superconducting qubits and gigahertz-frequency phonons. However, bulk lithium niobate phononic devices typically rely on surface acoustic waves and are therefore inherently subject to leakage from the surface into the bulk substrate. Here, we explore the acoustic behavior of resonator cavities supporting GHz-frequency Lamb waves in a 200 nm-thick suspended lithium niobate layer. We characterize the acoustic response at both room and millikelvin temperatures. We find that our resonator cavities with strong confinement reach intrinsic quality factors of approximately 6000 at the single phonon level. We use the measured parameters of the resonators to model their coupling to a superconducting transmon qubit, allowing us to evaluate their potential as quantum acoustic devices."}

For a quantum particle in one spatial dimension subject to stroboscopic measurements, we observe an algebraic decay of the probability of the first-detection time if the particle is free, an exponential decay in the presence of a confining potential, and a time-dependent crossover between these behaviors if the particle is partially confined.

Starting from an effective three-orbital faithful Wannier model for the spin-locked moiré bands, combined with orbital-dependent Hubbard interactions, we analyze the evolution of magnetic instabilities as a function of carrier density using the matrix random phase approximation (mRPA) approach. By computing the Stoner boundary lines from the spin-valley susceptibilities over the electric-field by hole filling phase diagram, we show that the spin-valley instabilities result in ordered states in the region close to the Lifshitz transition at the topmost moiré valence band, marked by crossing of the van Hove singularity in the density of states. These spin-valley ordered states are dominated by interorbital spin-valley-flips involving the $MM$ and $MX$ moiré orbitals and occur at different momenta in each side of the van Hove line, indicating a distinct spatial dependence of the spin-valley order parameter depending on the hole filling. Moreover, the corresponding Stoner boundaries exhibit strong fluctuations on its flanks, which can favor superconducting states in the regions close to the spin-valley-ordered ones. This mechanism provides a natural description for a reentrant superconducting dome consistent with the experimental results. As such, our results suggest spin-valley fluctuations near the van-Hove line as the microscopic origin of the reentrant superconductivity in twisted WSe$_2$."}

Very recently, people realized that the microscopic geometry of the entanglement cut can induce distinct entanglement-edge modes, whose coupling to bulk critical fluctuations may alter the scaling of the EE. However, this perception is very qualitative and lacks quantitative consideration. Here, we investigate this problem through high-precision quantum Monte Carlo simulations combined with the analysis of scaling theory to build a quantitative understanding. By considering three distinct bipartitions corresponding to three surface criticality types, we reveal a striking dependence of the constant term γ on the microscopic cut at the quantum critical point. Notably, cuts that generate extra gapless edge modes yield a sign reversal in γ compared to those producing gapped edges. We explain this behavior via a modified scaling form that incorporates contributions from both bulk and surface critical modes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the derivative of EE robustly extracts the bulk critical point and exponent ν regardless of the cut geometry, providing a reliable diagnostic of bulk universality in the presence of strong surface effects. Our work for the first time establishes a direct quantitative connection between surface criticality and entanglement scaling, challenging the conventional view that EE solely reflects bulk properties and offering a refined framework for interpreting entanglement in systems with boundary-sensitive criticality."}

Here, we present a molecular design approach for precisely modulating the optoelectronic properties of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) through single-atom halogen substitution on $π$-extended anthracene linkers. Using a Wurster-type tetratopic amine (W-NH$_2$) and a series of anthracene-based dialdehydes bearing H, Cl, Br, or I at the 2-position, a family of imine-linked COFs, W-A-X (X = H, Cl, Br, I), was synthesized, all displaying well-ordered porous structures. The halogen substituent strongly influences framework formation, with brominated COFs forming substantially larger crystalline domains than their chloro- and iodo-functionalized analogues. UV-vis absorption and photoluminescence measurements reveal a systematic redshift across the series $(\\mathrm{H < Cl < Br < I})$, demonstrating that a single-atom modification effectively tunes the optical response. Time-dependent density functional theory calculations on both isolated fragments and extended COF models attribute these trends to halogen-induced changes in the COF band structure and provide a mechanistic understanding of how single-atom substitution influences the optoelectronic properties of the extended $π$-framework. Overall, this study establishes single-atom halogen substitution as a powerful and modular strategy for tailoring the structural and optical properties of anthracene-based COFs."}

A fundamental consequence of this symmetry breaking is orbital magnetization, yet a clear microscopic formulation of this quantity has remained elusive. This difficulty arises because Bogoliubov quasiparticles do not carry a definite electric charge, precluding a simple interpretation of orbital magnetization in terms of circulating quasiparticle currents. Moreover, superconductivity and ferromagnetism rarely coexist, and in the few materials where they do (e.g. uranium-based compounds), strong spin-orbit coupling obscures the orbital contribution to the magnetization. The recent report of chiral superconductivity in rhombohedral multilayer graphene, which has negligible spin-orbit coupling, therefore provides a unique opportunity to develop and test a microscopic theory of orbital magnetization in chiral superconductors. Here we develop such a theory, unifying the interband coherence effects underlying normal-state orbital magnetization with the intrinsic orbital moments of the Cooper-pair condensate. Applying our theory to rhombohedral tetralayer graphene, we find that the onset of superconductivity can either enhance or suppress the normal-state orbital magnetization, depending sensitively on the bandstructure. We further identify a generalized clapping mode corresponding to coherent fluctuations between the two opposite chiral windings of the p-wave order parameter, with a gap set by the sublattice winding form factor. This collective mode is unique to chiral superconductors and contributes to the orbital magnetization through its role in dressing the photon vertex. Experimental measurements of the orbital magnetization relative to the quarter-metal phase would provide a direct test of our theory."}

Here we introduce a unified INTERFACE Force Field (IFF) parameterization together with a curated, ready-to-use pH-resolved surface model database that provides the most accurate and transferable atomistic description of major alumina phases to date. The framework covers a-Al2O3, g-Al2O3, boehmite, diaspore, and gibbsite using a single, physically interpretable parameter set that is directly compatible with CHARMM, AMBER, OPLS-AA, CVFF, and PCFF. Across structural, thermodynamic, mechanical, and interfacial benchmarks, simulations reproduce experimental reference data with more than 95 percent accuracy, exceeding existing force fields and the reliability of current density-functional approaches. A key advance is the first transferable treatment of surface ionization and charge regulation across alumina phases over a broad range of pH values, enabling simulations of realistic solid electrolyte interfaces without phase-specific reparameterization. Quantitative reliability is demonstrated by reproducing trends in zeta potentials and pH-dependent adsorption of a corrosion inhibitor at alumina-water interfaces. Predicted adsorption free energies and surface contact times correlate with experiments across more than an order of magnitude.

Our working assumption is that these additional degrees of freedom account for the \"boson peak\" that is observed in glassy materials. This identification allows us to obtain the length distribution of dislocations from experimental data of the boson peak for each material, which we use as input to calculate the phonon self-energy in a quantum field theory framework using that the phonon-dislocation interaction is given by the Peach-Koehler force. The tail of the distribution for long dislocations is consistent with an $L^{-5}$ power law. Our results show that this power law yields a linear rise in the thermal conductivity, as observed in glasses at low temperatures. We then consider two approaches to describe thermal conductivity data quantitatively. In the simplest approach we only keep the low-frequency behavior of the phonon self-energy with one free parameter, plus an adjustable UV cutoff. In the more realistic approach we keep the full frequency dependence of the phonon self-energy as dictated by the phonon-dislocation interaction plus an additional contribution due to scattering with point defects, with a cutoff set by the typical interatomic spacing of the material. We obtain a satisfactory description of thermal conductivity data with both approaches. We conclude by discussing prospects to test the predictive power of this model."}

This framework reproduces the standard Brownian propagator in the nonrelativistic limit and naturally extends to relativistic regimes, where the Wiener construction fails to preserve Lorentz covariance. The approach bypasses functional integration over paths, makes the role of entropic degeneracy explicit through an action-space density of states, and provides a transparent connection between the principle of least action and statistical inference. We derive the density of states explicitly using large deviation theory, showing that it takes a Gaussian form centered at the minimal action, and rigorously justify the saddle-point approximation in the diffusive regime. The Markovian property of the resulting propagator is verified to hold via the Chapman--Kolmogorov equation, following from the additivity of the minimal action for free-particle dynamics. In the diffusive regime, the resulting dynamics are governed by a competition between extremization of the action and entropic effects, which can be interpreted in terms of an effective action free energy.

The idea is simple yet decisive: a third-order expansion of the Boltzmann equation in the magnetic field reveals that the threefold component originates from the relative positions of the mirror planes in the crystals with respect to the measurement setups. Remarkably, the threefold contribution should be ubiquitous because this symmetry condition can be realized across a broad range of crystals. Numerical estimates based on concrete models further show that its amplitude is comparable to that expected from the AHE."}

An ontology-driven, large language model (LLM)-assisted framework is introduced for the automated extraction and structuring of computational workflows from the literature. The approach focuses on density functional theory-based stacking fault energy (SFE) calculations in hexagonal close-packed magnesium and its binary alloys, and uses a multi-stage filtering strategy together with prompt-engineered LLM extraction applied to method sections and tables.

While the model remains quadratic, we find that the growth of the Lanczos coefficients structurally depends strongly on the chosen coupling.

An intermediate Al1-xGaxN (AlGaN) layer is often present, either unintentionally during growth or intentionally to induce a 2D electron gas, yet its impact on the interfacial thermal boundary conductance (TBC) remains unknown due to the lack of reliable measurement or modeling methods. Here, we report a first principles-based evaluation of the TBCs of AlN-AlGaN, AlGaN-GaN, and AlN-AlGaN-GaN interfaces over the full alloy range. This is realized by the development of accurate deep learning interatomic potentials based on first-principles simulations. Contrary to other material systems where mixed interlayers enhance thermal coupling, we find that an AlGaN interlayer markedly degrades TBC between GaN and AlN, explaining the observation in experiments. Finally, we show that if the Al composition is sigmoidally transitioned from 0 to 1 across the AlN-GaN interface, it can remarkably increase the TBC, compared to an abrupt or a linear transition. This work is expected to shed light on an accurate thermal analysis and electro-thermal co-design of future AlGaN-based devices."}

Despite their central role, direct and quantitative access to the out-of-plane atomic structure in these systems has remained elusive due to their nanoscale dimensions. Here, we introduce an automated dark-field electron tomography technique that enables three-dimensional structural analysis of atomically thin materials with sub-angstrom precision. Applying this method to twisted bilayer WSe$_2$, we uncover a significant expansion of the interlayer spacing compared to the bulk configuration, exceeding 0.1 angstrom, along with a remarkable temperature-driven interlayer decoupling unique to the twisted bilayer. Ultrafast measurement further reveals optically induced interlayer separation of ~0.2 angstrom on the picosecond timescale, attributed to transient exciton formation. These findings not only establish a powerful approach for visualizing hidden out-of-plane structures in atomically thin micro-flake materials, but also uncover the intrinsic fragility and dynamical tunability of interlayer coupling in moiré-engineered 2-dimensional materials."}

Here, we use resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) to detect plasmons in the metallic, low-valence nickelate Pr4Ni3O8. Although qualitatively similar to those in cuprates, the nickelate plasmons are more heavily damped and have a lower velocity than those in a cuprate at comparable doping, which we attribute to reduced electronic hopping and enhanced screening of the long-range Coulomb interactions. Furthermore, the plasmons in Pr4Ni3O8 soften with increasing temperature, in contrast to the cuprate, where plasmons remain at nearly fixed energy but become more strongly damped. Taken together, these results reveal a distinct charge-screening landscape in nickelates and place quantitative constraints on analogies to cuprates."}

Enhancing its efficiency is both fundamentally and practically interesting and remains a challenge to date. Recently, orbital counterparts of spin effects that do not rely on the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) have been found as an alternative mechanism to realize it. This work highlights the engineering of copper oxidation states for manipulating the orbital current and its torque in the CuO$_x$-based heterostructures. The orbital hybridization and thus the orbital-Rashba-Edelstein effect at the CuO$_x$/Cu interfaces are significantly enhanced by increasing the copper oxidation state, yielding a torque efficiency that is almost ten times larger than the conventional heavy metals. The Cu$_4$O$_3$/Cu interface, rather than the widely accepted CuO/Cu interface, is revealed to account for the enhanced SOT performance in the CuO$_x$-based heterostructures. In addition, the torque efficiency can be alternatively switched between high and low thresholds through the redox reaction. The current results establish an exotic and robust strategy for engineering the orbital current and SOT for spin-orbitronics, which applies to other weak-SOC materials."}

However, the controlled synthesis of single phase $α$-In$_2$Se$_3$ remains challenging owing to its complex phase diagram, presence of multiple polymorphs and the high volatility of selenium that induces non-stoichiometry and unintentional carrier doping. For ferroelectric α-In2Se3, minimizing the carrier density is essential because leakage current can obscure polarization switching. Here, we report the growth of $α$-In$_2$Se$_3$ single crystals using a unique approach, the Se-flux assisted modified vertical Bridgman technique combined with liquid encapsulation under high pressure. This approach creates a high-pressure, Se-rich environment that effectively minimizes Se-vaporization. Structural and compositional analysis using X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy confirm the formation of pure $α$-In$_2$Se$_3$ single crystals with 3R stacking. Furthermore, the crystals exhibit remarkably low carrier density of 1.5-3.2 $\\times$ 10$^{16}$ cm$^{-3}$ at 300K$-$the lowest reported to date, reflecting a significant suppression of Se-vacancies relative to the conventional Bridgman or melt-grown crystals. Through transport and ARPES measurements on different batches of crystals, we also demonstrate that the amount of Se-flux plays a crucial role in controlling Se-vacancies. Our results thus establish this modified Bridgman method as an effective strategy for synthesizing large $α$-In$_2$Se$_3$ single crystals with reduced intrinsic defects. This technique can be broadly applied to grow other volatile chalcogenides with reduced defects and controlled stoichiometry."}

Starting from an effective three-orbital faithful Wannier model for the spin-locked moiré bands, combined with orbital-dependent Hubbard interactions, we analyze the evolution of magnetic instabilities as a function of carrier density using the matrix random phase approximation (mRPA) approach. By computing the Stoner boundary lines from the spin-valley susceptibilities over the electric-field by hole filling phase diagram, we show that the spin-valley instabilities result in ordered states in the region close to the Lifshitz transition at the topmost moiré valence band, marked by crossing of the van Hove singularity in the density of states. These spin-valley ordered states are dominated by interorbital spin-valley-flips involving the $MM$ and $MX$ moiré orbitals and occur at different momenta in each side of the van Hove line, indicating a distinct spatial dependence of the spin-valley order parameter depending on the hole filling. Moreover, the corresponding Stoner boundaries exhibit strong fluctuations on its flanks, which can favor superconducting states in the regions close to the spin-valley-ordered ones. This mechanism provides a natural description for a reentrant superconducting dome consistent with the experimental results. As such, our results suggest spin-valley fluctuations near the van-Hove line as the microscopic origin of the reentrant superconductivity in twisted WSe$_2$."}

This review first discusses the reported experimental evidence of flexoelectricity induced contact electrification and interlayer charge transfer in conducting thin film based heterostructures. The interlayer charge transfer creates a gradient of charge carrier in both the thin films constituting the heterostructure and also modifies the electron-electron interactions. Further, the interlayer charge transfer changes the electron-phonon coupling, spin-phonon coupling and magnetoelectronic coupling that give rise to new physical behavior, which did not exist prior to the interlayer charge transfer. The new physical behaviors from interlayer charge transfer and their mechanistic origins are reanalyzed and discussed, which include spin-Hall effect of charge carriers, topological Hall effect of magnetoelectronic electromagnon, inhomogeneous magnetoelectronic multiferroic effect, flexoelectronic proximity effect and topological spin texture. This review article presents a unified picture of current status and future directions that will provide the scientists a stepping stone for research in the field of flexoelectricity mediated contact electrification and interlayer charge transfer mediated behavior in the micro/nanoscale heterostructures of the conducting materials."}

This large positive mixing enthalpy produces a miscibility gap with a critical temperature above 2300 K, implying that the high Ge and Sn solubilities observed in thin-film synthesis cannot be explained by the incoherent phase diagram alone.

Using the Creutz ladder and the $χ$ lattice as representative examples, we show that both the two-body bound-state size and the many-body Cooper-pair size remain finite and small in the weak-coupling limit, being controlled by the quantum metric of the flat bands. By contrast, the coherence length exhibits qualitatively distinct behavior, diverging in the dilute limit and in the vicinity of insulating regimes.

Using a spinful Rice--Mele model, we show that a stationary LV background induces a momentum-odd correction to the Bloch Hamiltonian, which generates an odd-in-field contribution to the shift current. This leads to a directional asymmetry, whereby the photocurrent distinguishes opposite orientations of an applied static field. The effect originates from an LV-induced deformation of the interband phase and can be isolated experimentally by comparing field-reversed configurations, with vanishing response at transverse orientations, providing an internal consistency check. Our results demonstrate that nonlinear optical responses offer a practical and symmetry-selective route for probing LV effects in solid-state systems."}

Here we perform in situ high-pressure angular-dependent electrical transport measurements on Pr4Ni3O10 single crystals using a custom diamond anvil cell (DAC) rotator and confirming its anisotropic superconductivity. The anisotropy parameter is approximately 1.6, decreasing with increasing temperature and approaches 1 near Tc. Comparing effective mass anisotropy and inter-block distance in cuprates and iron-based superconductors (FeSCs) reveals that Pr4Ni3O10 single crystals superconductors are consistent with a two-band model, where intralayer quantum confinement within the unit cell induces interlayer coherence, thereby leading to three-dimensional (3D) superconductivity. This study not only establishes the existence of anisotropic superconductivity in bulk Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates, but also provide critical insight into the role of dimensionality in high-temperature superconductivity."}

Our working assumption is that these additional degrees of freedom account for the \"boson peak\" that is observed in glassy materials. This identification allows us to obtain the length distribution of dislocations from experimental data of the boson peak for each material, which we use as input to calculate the phonon self-energy in a quantum field theory framework using that the phonon-dislocation interaction is given by the Peach-Koehler force. The tail of the distribution for long dislocations is consistent with an $L^{-5}$ power law. Our results show that this power law yields a linear rise in the thermal conductivity, as observed in glasses at low temperatures. We then consider two approaches to describe thermal conductivity data quantitatively. In the simplest approach we only keep the low-frequency behavior of the phonon self-energy with one free parameter, plus an adjustable UV cutoff. In the more realistic approach we keep the full frequency dependence of the phonon self-energy as dictated by the phonon-dislocation interaction plus an additional contribution due to scattering with point defects, with a cutoff set by the typical interatomic spacing of the material. We obtain a satisfactory description of thermal conductivity data with both approaches. We conclude by discussing prospects to test the predictive power of this model."}

Here, we exploit TERS in a cryogenic scanning tunneling microscope junction to perform Raman hyperspectral mapping of single iron phthalocyanine (FePc) molecules in three non-equivalent adsorption configurations on Ag surfaces. We explore the changes in the vibrational modes of FePc molecules adsorbed on two distinct silver crystal terminations with differing symmetry, Ag(111) and Ag(110), revealing how subtle variations in the adsorption geometry due to substrate anisotropy can strongly influence molecular vibrations, lifting the degeneracy of individual normal modes.

The Berry induced phase coherence then persists over length scales of order the scale at which the chiral one-dimensional states scatter into the bulk states, which can be macroscopic. The conditions for their occurrence and the lengths and the orientation of such states are derived. These calculations are used to understand the remarkable aspects of a recent experiment in an anisotropic metal, reported to have loop-current order, with mean-free path of about 0.01 $μ$m which exhibits flux quantization in some transport properties over lengths of several $μ$m. %It is also shown that generating the appropriately oriented channels in the plane by the field applied is plausible."}

Here we report a versatile covalent-linking based approach for the functionalization of reduced graphene oxide (rGO), to prepare a variety of QD-rGO hybrid dispersions with QDs of different size and composition (PbS, PbS/CdS and CdSe QDs), and shape (CdSe/CdS dot-in-rods).

A further spectroscopic investigation of near-infrared PbS QD-rGO materials demonstrates efficient electronic coupling between both materials. The QD photoluminescence emission quenching and exciton lifetime shortening up to 95%, together with subtle graphene Raman G-band shifts upon QD linking, supports electron transfer as the dominant relaxation pathway from the QD to the rGO. The use of core/shell PbS/CdS QDs allows tuning of the transfer efficiency from 94% for a 0.2 nm thin CdS shell, down to 30% for a 1.1 nm thick shell."}

The coupling strength scales with both the degree of overlap of Br orbitals adjacent to the van der Waals gap and the cosine of half of the interlayer spin angle. This enhanced interlayer electronic coupling gives rise to excitons delocalized across the two layers with a strong polarization dependence that reflects the details of the interlayer spin alignment.

We identify the dominant coupling channels and characterize their observable signatures in the QD response. We predict strong linear energy shifts under volumetric strain and quadratic behavior under shear strain, especially in GaAs QDs. The piezoelectric effect is dominated by polarizability, which also leads to a quadratic response. The simulations show energy modulations up to 0.7 meV for an acoustic wave with 0.1 nm amplitude. The quadratic response to shear strain and piezoelectric field leads to frequency doubling in the QD response to a mechanical wave and to non-harmonic time traces when linear and quadratic effects contribute to a similar degree.

This review first discusses the reported experimental evidence of flexoelectricity induced contact electrification and interlayer charge transfer in conducting thin film based heterostructures. The interlayer charge transfer creates a gradient of charge carrier in both the thin films constituting the heterostructure and also modifies the electron-electron interactions. Further, the interlayer charge transfer changes the electron-phonon coupling, spin-phonon coupling and magnetoelectronic coupling that give rise to new physical behavior, which did not exist prior to the interlayer charge transfer. The new physical behaviors from interlayer charge transfer and their mechanistic origins are reanalyzed and discussed, which include spin-Hall effect of charge carriers, topological Hall effect of magnetoelectronic electromagnon, inhomogeneous magnetoelectronic multiferroic effect, flexoelectronic proximity effect and topological spin texture.

Enhancing its efficiency is both fundamentally and practically interesting and remains a challenge to date. Recently, orbital counterparts of spin effects that do not rely on the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) have been found as an alternative mechanism to realize it. This work highlights the engineering of copper oxidation states for manipulating the orbital current and its torque in the CuO$_x$-based heterostructures. The orbital hybridization and thus the orbital-Rashba-Edelstein effect at the CuO$_x$/Cu interfaces are significantly enhanced by increasing the copper oxidation state, yielding a torque efficiency that is almost ten times larger than the conventional heavy metals. The Cu$_4$O$_3$/Cu interface, rather than the widely accepted CuO/Cu interface, is revealed to account for the enhanced SOT performance in the CuO$_x$-based heterostructures. In addition, the torque efficiency can be alternatively switched between high and low thresholds through the redox reaction. The current results establish an exotic and robust strategy for engineering the orbital current and SOT for spin-orbitronics, which applies to other weak-SOC materials."}

There is intense debate as to whether some photoactive halide perovskites exhibit ferroelectric behaviour and whether it might be possible to utilise the bulk photovoltaic effect to enhance the performance of halide perovskite solar cells. Here, using low-dose scanning transmission electron microscopy, we discover the existence of ferroelastic twin boundaries in vapor-deposited CsPbI3 thin films, parallel to {110} and {112}. Remarkably, despite photoactive CsPbI3 being centrosymmetric and non-polar, we observe directly that Pb atoms shift at {110} twin boundaries driving a local ferroelectric-like polarisation. These polar twin walls form an intrinsic array of nanoscale functional interfaces, spaced ~30-50 nm apart, embedded within the non-polar perovskite lattice. In contrast, {112} twin boundaries remain non-polar but strongly suppress octahedral tilt and off-centre Cs atom displacements, revealing a different untapped ferroic degree of freedom. These discoveries together uncover previously hidden ferroic functionality in halide perovskite semiconductors, opening opportunities for enhanced conductivity and photovoltaic behaviour through domain wall engineering."}

Very recently, people realized that the microscopic geometry of the entanglement cut can induce distinct entanglement-edge modes, whose coupling to bulk critical fluctuations may alter the scaling of the EE. However, this perception is very qualitative and lacks quantitative consideration. Here, we investigate this problem through high-precision quantum Monte Carlo simulations combined with the analysis of scaling theory to build a quantitative understanding. By considering three distinct bipartitions corresponding to three surface criticality types, we reveal a striking dependence of the constant term γ on the microscopic cut at the quantum critical point. Notably, cuts that generate extra gapless edge modes yield a sign reversal in γ compared to those producing gapped edges. We explain this behavior via a modified scaling form that incorporates contributions from both bulk and surface critical modes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the derivative of EE robustly extracts the bulk critical point and exponent ν regardless of the cut geometry, providing a reliable diagnostic of bulk universality in the presence of strong surface effects. Our work for the first time establishes a direct quantitative connection between surface criticality and entanglement scaling, challenging the conventional view that EE solely reflects bulk properties and offering a refined framework for interpreting entanglement in systems with boundary-sensitive criticality."}

In this study, we employ a machine learning interatomic potential to investigate the effect of uniaxial compressive stress on polarization switching and domain wall evolution in the tetragonal phase of BaTiO3. This study revealed a critical stress about 120 MPa which 90 degree polarization switching occurs. Beyond the critical stress, larger supercells exhibit lower activation energies for polarization switching with 180-degree domain wall formation and weaker constraints from periodic boundary conditions, thereby facilitating domain-wall formation. Besides, Increasing compressive stress reduces both the remnant polarization and the coercive field, while a double hysteresis loop emerges at a stress level of 80 MPa.

By computing the Stoner boundary lines from the spin-valley susceptibilities over the electric-field by hole filling phase diagram, we show that the spin-valley instabilities result in ordered states in the region close to the Lifshitz transition at the topmost moiré valence band, marked by crossing of the van Hove singularity in the density of states. These spin-valley ordered states are dominated by interorbital spin-valley-flips involving the $MM$ and $MX$ moiré orbitals and occur at different momenta in each side of the van Hove line, indicating a distinct spatial dependence of the spin-valley order parameter depending on the hole filling. Moreover, the corresponding Stoner boundaries exhibit strong fluctuations on its flanks, which can favor superconducting states in the regions close to the spin-valley-ordered ones. This mechanism provides a natural description for a reentrant superconducting dome consistent with the experimental results.

In this paper we provide a general model that gives the picture for the evolution and transition from typical ferroelectricity to long displacement ferroelectricity, which is classified into type-I and type-II. In particular, type-I with two switching modes of different barriers may switch between conventional ferroelectricity and ion-conduction-like ferroelectricity depending on various factors including electric field, boundaries, vacancies, temperature, etc.., which is demonstrated by first-principles calculations on γ-AlOOH and CuInP2S6 as two paradigmatic cases. Intriguingly, their polarizations are nonlocal since the boundaries also determine the switching mode and polarization direction, which can be different for the same given crystal structure. Such type-I can be evolved from conventional ferroelectricity as the migration barrier across unitcell is reduced, and will behave like type-II at elevated temperature as the conventional part becomes paraelectric. These unconventional behaviors can be applicable to various systems, and many previously unclarified phenomena can be well explained."}

In this work, we present a strategy based on phase-transition-induced activation of cross-relaxation processes in LiYO2:Tb3+. The monoclinic-to-tetragonal structural phase transition modifies the point symmetry of Tb3+ ions in the host lattice, enhances the Stark effect, and enables energetic resonance required for efficient cross relaxation. Consequently, emission originating from the 5D3 excited state is rapidly quenched relative to that from the 5D4 level above approximately 300 K, resulting in a distinct temperature-dependent color change of the emitted light from blue to green. This mechanism yields exceptionally high chromaticity-coordinate-based sensitivities, reaching SRx,max = 0.40% K-1 and SRy,max=0.72% K-1 at 410 K.

This identification allows us to obtain the length distribution of dislocations from experimental data of the boson peak for each material, which we use as input to calculate the phonon self-energy in a quantum field theory framework using that the phonon-dislocation interaction is given by the Peach-Koehler force. The tail of the distribution for long dislocations is consistent with an $L^{-5}$ power law. Our results show that this power law yields a linear rise in the thermal conductivity, as observed in glasses at low temperatures. We then consider two approaches to describe thermal conductivity data quantitatively. In the simplest approach we only keep the low-frequency behavior of the phonon self-energy with one free parameter, plus an adjustable UV cutoff. In the more realistic approach we keep the full frequency dependence of the phonon self-energy as dictated by the phonon-dislocation interaction plus an additional contribution due to scattering with point defects, with a cutoff set by the typical interatomic spacing of the material.

Here, we present a numerically efficient real-space framework for classifying parity-based $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topology in aperiodic systems based on the spectral localizer framework and the direct computation of the sign of a Pfaffian associated with a large sparse skew-symmetric matrix. Unlike projector-based or momentum-space-based approaches, our method does not rely on translational symmetry, spectral gaps in the Hamiltonian's bulk, or gapped auxiliary operators such as spin projections, and instead provides a local, energy-resolved topological invariant accompanied by an intrinsic measure of topological protection. A central contribution of this work is the development of a scalable sparse factorization algorithm that enables the reliable determination of the Pfaffian's sign for large sparse matrices, making the approach practical to realistic physical materials. We apply this framework to identify the quantum spin Hall effect in quasicrystalline class AII systems, including gapless heterostructures, and to diagnose fragile topology in a large $C_2 \\mathcal{T}$-symmetric photonic quasicrystal. Overall, our results demonstrate that the spectral localizer, combined with efficient sparse numerical methods, provides a unified and robust tool for diagnosing parity-based topological phases in aperiodic electronic, photonic, and acoustic materials where conventional band-theoretic indexes are inapplicable."}

In this work, we investigate the origin of these discrepancies in the prototypical ferroelectric PbTiO$_3$ by performing extensive constant-pressure ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations and benchmarking them against classical molecular dynamics (MD) using machine learning force fields (MLFFs) derived from first-principles data. Our results show that the underestimation of $T_c$ primarily stems from the limitations of the exchange-correlation functional, rather than inaccuracies in the MLFF fitting. We uncover a critical interplay between finite-size effects and the range of interatomic interactions: although short-range MLFFs appear to yield better agreement with experimental $T_c$, this improvement results from a fortuitous cancellation of errors. Incorporating explicit long-range interactions improves accuracy for larger supercells but ultimately leads to lower predicted $T_c$ values. These findings highlight that accurate finite-temperature predictions require not only high-quality training data and sufficiently large simulation cells, but also the explicit treatment of long-range interactions and improved exchange-correlation functionals."}

In contrast to its short-range counterparts, the long-range dipolar field acts statically as a confining potential for spin wave, while the dynamic part couples the spin and orbit degrees of freedom, thus giving rise to spin-orbit coupling for spin wave. Due to the inversion symmetry of the Hamiltonian and the spinor structure of the wave function, spin-wave eigenstates form doublets with definite parity. Micromagnetic simulation tallies well with numerical calculation. Our study on spin-wave eigenstates in CrSBr waveguides sheds light on the nature of exchange-dipole spin wave in ferromagnetic slabs. We confirm particularly that the robustness of the Damon-Eshbach mode is not derived from topology, but rather from the static dipolar field.

A. Müller as the \"drosophila of solid-state physics\", has been extensively investigated over the last seventy five years for its intricate coupling of structural, electronic, and dielectric properties and continues to serve as a foundational platform for advancing oxide electronics. In its pristine form, SrTiO$_3$ exhibits quantum paraelectric behavior below 35 K and undergoes an antiferrodistortive phase transition near 105 K. This transition generates ferroelastic twin domains separated by a dense network of domain walls, which function as nanoscale structural defects with far-reaching consequences. While the static influence of ferroelastic domain walls on carrier transport in electron-doped SrTiO$_3$ is well established, recent experimental results show that the emergence of polarity at these walls, combined with strain fields and inherent quantum fluctuations, induces correlated dynamical phenomena such as glass-like relaxations of electrons and memory effects. In this review, we highlight these recent advances, focusing on the subtle interplay between the emergence of nanoscale polar order, quantum fluctuations, and long-range strain fields. We propose that understanding charge carrier dynamics in the background of these complex ferroelastic domain wall landscapes offers a new paradigm for exploring electronic transport in the presence of local polar order and quantum fluctuations, with broad implications for correlated oxides."}

In this work, we investigate the channel width scaling in nanoribbon transistors based on monolayer MoS2 grown on 2-inch wafers, achieving widths of approximately 30-40 nm. Remarkably, nanoribbon width scaling enhances the on-current by 30-40%, reaching up to 700 uA/um for the smallest-width devices, while also improving the subthreshold slope (SS) to as low as 70 mV/dec. This enhancement is attributed to a stronger electric field at the nanoribbon edges without significant degradation from edge-related scattering.

This advancement significantly broadens the applicability of capacitance dilatometry, providing a powerful platform for investigating emergent phenomena in reduced-dimensional quantum systems."}

Yet molecular models that predictively connect phase structure, pH-dependent surface chemistry, electrolyte organization, and adsorption across operating conditions remain limited. Here we introduce a unified INTERFACE Force Field (IFF) parameterization together with a curated, ready-to-use pH-resolved surface model database that provides the most accurate and transferable atomistic description of major alumina phases to date. The framework covers a-Al2O3, g-Al2O3, boehmite, diaspore, and gibbsite using a single, physically interpretable parameter set that is directly compatible with CHARMM, AMBER, OPLS-AA, CVFF, and PCFF. Across structural, thermodynamic, mechanical, and interfacial benchmarks, simulations reproduce experimental reference data with more than 95 percent accuracy, exceeding existing force fields and the reliability of current density-functional approaches. A key advance is the first transferable treatment of surface ionization and charge regulation across alumina phases over a broad range of pH values, enabling simulations of realistic solid electrolyte interfaces without phase-specific reparameterization. Quantitative reliability is demonstrated by reproducing trends in zeta potentials and pH-dependent adsorption of a corrosion inhibitor at alumina-water interfaces. Predicted adsorption free energies and surface contact times correlate with experiments across more than an order of magnitude. Relative to ML-DFT workflows, the speed 100 to 1000 times faster, reaching system sizes and time scales inaccessible to quantum methods. The results establish a predictive computational platform to design alumina-containing functional materials under realistic process conditions."}

By rotating the applied magnetic field vector while keeping its intensity constant, the demagnetizing field within a high-aspect ratio sample changes significantly, resulting in a RMCE.

First-principles calculations reveal that this substantial torque originates from the cooperative interplay of the spin Hall effect, orbital Hall effect, and orbital Rashba effect, assisted by interfacial charge transfer. These findings demonstrate the potential of carefully engineered vdW heterostructures to achieve highly efficient electrical manipulation of magnetization at room temperature, paving the way for next-generation low-power spintronic devices."}

Existing text-mining approaches are insufficient to extract complete computational workflows with their associated parameters. An ontology-driven, large language model (LLM)-assisted framework is introduced for the automated extraction and structuring of computational workflows from the literature. The approach focuses on density functional theory-based stacking fault energy (SFE) calculations in hexagonal close-packed magnesium and its binary alloys, and uses a multi-stage filtering strategy together with prompt-engineered LLM extraction applied to method sections and tables. Extracted information is unified into a canonical schema and aligned with established materials ontologies (CMSO, ASMO, and PLDO), enabling the construction of a knowledge graph using atomRDF. The resulting knowledge graph enables systematic comparison of reported SFE values and supports the structured reuse of computational protocols. While full computational reproducibility is still constrained by missing or implicit metadata, the framework provides a foundation for organizing and contextualizing published results in a semantically interoperable form, thereby improving transparency and reusability of computational materials data."}

Here, we show freestanding LAO/STO micro-membranes naturally hosting negative-U centers, where lateral confinement arises intrinsically, rather than from engineered nanostructures. These centers coexist with gate-tunable superconductivity and can remain stable upon thermal cycling from millikelvin temperatures to room temperature. Transport is in excellent agreement with calculations based on a negative-U Anderson model, and electrostatic simulations indicate characteristic center sizes of 20-80 nm.

However, the controlled synthesis of single phase $α$-In$_2$Se$_3$ remains challenging owing to its complex phase diagram, presence of multiple polymorphs and the high volatility of selenium that induces non-stoichiometry and unintentional carrier doping. For ferroelectric α-In2Se3, minimizing the carrier density is essential because leakage current can obscure polarization switching. Here, we report the growth of $α$-In$_2$Se$_3$ single crystals using a unique approach, the Se-flux assisted modified vertical Bridgman technique combined with liquid encapsulation under high pressure. This approach creates a high-pressure, Se-rich environment that effectively minimizes Se-vaporization. Structural and compositional analysis using X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy confirm the formation of pure $α$-In$_2$Se$_3$ single crystals with 3R stacking. Furthermore, the crystals exhibit remarkably low carrier density of 1.5-3.2 $\\times$ 10$^{16}$ cm$^{-3}$ at 300K$-$the lowest reported to date, reflecting a significant suppression of Se-vacancies relative to the conventional Bridgman or melt-grown crystals. Through transport and ARPES measurements on different batches of crystals, we also demonstrate that the amount of Se-flux plays a crucial role in controlling Se-vacancies. Our results thus establish this modified Bridgman method as an effective strategy for synthesizing large $α$-In$_2$Se$_3$ single crystals with reduced intrinsic defects. This technique can be broadly applied to grow other volatile chalcogenides with reduced defects and controlled stoichiometry."}

In addition, we find that the helicity rotation velocity is highly anisotropic, depending on the direction of current flows. We also observe helicity oscillation in the terahertz regimes, where the nonlinear mixing between the fast and slow modes generates a magnon frequency comb.

High proximity sensing can also be realised by using micro- and nano-crystals, however in many solid-state systems this leads to a reduction in coherence. In this paper we combine room-temperature optically detected coherent control of molecular spins and microscopy to image the coherence properties of both thin-films and micro-crystals of pentacene doped p-terphenyl. In thin-films we find large amounts of variation in both the contrast and coherence times, leading to a variability in the magnetic field sensitivity of approximately 7.6 %. Applying the technique to micro-crystals shows much lower sensitivity variability (1.3 %), and we find no evidence of coherence loss toward the edge of the crystal.

The spatial statistics for different scan areas reveal a linear dependence of local $T_c$ on $ρ_{s0}$ for $T_c$>8 K and a sub-linear one for $T_c$<8 K. Remarkably, the overall relationship is reminiscent of that reported in overdoped cuprate superconductors, hinting at a close connection between them."}

While state-of-the-art Si GAA nanoribbon transistors feature channel widths in the tens of nanometers, most reported TMD-based FETs remain limited to micrometer-scale dimensions, limiting their relevance for ultra-scaled electronics. In this work, we investigate the channel width scaling in nanoribbon transistors based on monolayer MoS2 grown on 2-inch wafers, achieving widths of approximately 30-40 nm. Remarkably, nanoribbon width scaling enhances the on-current by 30-40%, reaching up to 700 uA/um for the smallest-width devices, while also improving the subthreshold slope (SS) to as low as 70 mV/dec. This enhancement is attributed to a stronger electric field at the nanoribbon edges without significant degradation from edge-related scattering. To further demonstrate the scalability of the nanoribbon device, we evaluate the variability of extremely scaled monolayer MoS2 nanoribbon transistor arrays featuring a contact pitch of 60 nm and an effective oxide thickness (EOT) of approximately 0.9 nm. Beyond MoS2, we extend the nanoribbon structure to WS2 n-type and WSe2 p-type FETs, demonstrating a viable path toward complementary monolayer TMD nanoribbon FETs for future ultra-scaled electronics."}

Upon ageing at 800 C for 15 min, two co-nanoprecipitation modes are observed: B2 forming together with kappa and B2 forming separately from kappa in the FCC matrix. APT reveals that the B2 precipitate next to kappa (referred to as B2I) is close to an FeAl type phase, while the isolated B2 precipitate (referred to as B2II) is close to a NiAl type phase. The kappa precipitates maintain a nearly constant Al content of approximately 18.4 at.% regardless of their precipitation position. DFT confirms that kappa may accommodate limited Ni substitution at Fe sites without losing structural stability, and that Fe Ni atomic exchange between kappa and B2 is thermodynamically favorable at 800 C. This exchange drives the B2 phase to evolve from a NiAl type towards an FeAl type, improving the stability of both phases during co-precipitation. These results provide understanding of kappa B2 interactions and offer insights for designing nanosized intermetallic strengthened microstructures in Al alloyed lightweight steels."}

Our working assumption is that these additional degrees of freedom account for the \"boson peak\" that is observed in glassy materials. This identification allows us to obtain the length distribution of dislocations from experimental data of the boson peak for each material, which we use as input to calculate the phonon self-energy in a quantum field theory framework using that the phonon-dislocation interaction is given by the Peach-Koehler force. The tail of the distribution for long dislocations is consistent with an $L^{-5}$ power law. Our results show that this power law yields a linear rise in the thermal conductivity, as observed in glasses at low temperatures. We then consider two approaches to describe thermal conductivity data quantitatively. In the simplest approach we only keep the low-frequency behavior of the phonon self-energy with one free parameter, plus an adjustable UV cutoff. In the more realistic approach we keep the full frequency dependence of the phonon self-energy as dictated by the phonon-dislocation interaction plus an additional contribution due to scattering with point defects, with a cutoff set by the typical interatomic spacing of the material. We obtain a satisfactory description of thermal conductivity data with both approaches. We conclude by discussing prospects to test the predictive power of this model."}

Our scheme reveals that Ef is jointly determined by the average d-band center of RHEAs and the d-band width of interstitial sites. Notably, the d-band width mainly depends on the interatomic hopping matrix and atomic size-determined coordination number, which together make the metallic bonding around interstitials in RHEAs resemble the distance-dependence law of van der Waals forces. By capturing d-band coupling character, our descriptor describes both interstitial configurations within a universal framework.

This work highlights the engineering of copper oxidation states for manipulating the orbital current and its torque in the CuO$_x$-based heterostructures. The orbital hybridization and thus the orbital-Rashba-Edelstein effect at the CuO$_x$/Cu interfaces are significantly enhanced by increasing the copper oxidation state, yielding a torque efficiency that is almost ten times larger than the conventional heavy metals. The Cu$_4$O$_3$/Cu interface, rather than the widely accepted CuO/Cu interface, is revealed to account for the enhanced SOT performance in the CuO$_x$-based heterostructures.

Through epitaxial stabilization, the disordered A2 alloy can be extended from 19% to 30% gallium resulting in a magnetostrictive coefficient almost twice than that which is seen in rare earth magnetostrictors like SmFe2. In a composite magnetoelectric structure, this makes epitaxially-stabilized iron gallium a key material for energy-efficient beyond CMOS technologies. The energy dissipation and speed of magnetoelectric switching, however, is affected by the magnetic resonance frequency and damping. Here we report the evolution of the ferromagnetic resonance and key materials parameters (magnetic anisotropy, magnetic damping, and magnetostriction coefficient) for 70 nm thick epitaxially-stabilized single crystal A2 FeGa films beyond 19% Ga. Using flip chip ferromagnetic resonance (1-14 GHz), we find that the Gilbert damping parameter spans the range of 0.09-0.16 and decreases as the Ga concentration increases. This correlates an increasing magnetoelastic coupling with a reduction in the Gilbert damping. We find that the effective damping is a mix of contributions from the intrinsic magnon-phonon scattering and other scattering/dissipation mechanisms, with the latter being dominant especially at high Ga composition. Our results provide insight into the mechanism of magnetic relaxation in metastable high magnetostriction materials and potential switching behavior of composite magnetoelectrics."}

We present an iterative approach that uses simulated Kikuchi patterns to resolve several overlapping diffraction signals. For each measured EBSD pattern, our method first identifies the best-fit simulated Kikuchi pattern using dynamic template matching. This simulated, ideal reference pattern is then further processed to optimally match the experimental image, uncovering any underlying weaker signals after subtraction. Repeatedly utilizing dynamic template matching and pattern subtraction on residual signals of subsequent steps enables the identification of minor phases that might otherwise be missed from the probing volume of the EBSD map point. This method significantly improves phase detection in complex materials, addressing a key limitation of conventional EBSD analysis that conventionally assigns a single phase to each map point. The present method does not require a known orientation relationship between the phases of the overlapping patterns or close neighbor experimental patterns like previously published approaches."}

Implementing these structures in a qubit architecture is expected to result in coherence times that scale exponentially with the lengths of the chains. To scale to longer systems, the phase differences between all superconducting segments in the chain need to be controlled. While this control has been demonstrated by using an external magnetic flux, ideally it can be achieved with control over intrinsic system parameters. In this work, we investigate whether the relevant phase differences can be tuned through the spin degree of freedom in each QD, or the chemical potential of the discrete bound states in the hybrid sections. We confirm that both these tuning knobs allow for controlling the phase difference in the couplings between neighbouring QDs, bypassing the requirement to tune an external flux. However, we find that the amplitude of the phase shifts can deviate from a discrete $π$-shift. We introduce a spatial variation in the spin-orbit field as a possible mechanism to explain the observed behaviour and comment on the consequences for experimentally creating long Kitaev chains."}

In the present study, we demonstrate by means of continuum simulations that under certain conditions $r > 1$ is achievable for faster cation diffusion along grain boundaries in an acceptor-doped perovskite ceramic. Diffusion profiles for a two-dimensional bicrystal geometry are obtained by solving, first, Poisson's equation, and subsequently, the diffusion equation. The specific case we consider is cation migration occurring by two related mechanisms, by isolated cation vacancies and by defect associates of cation and anion vacancies; the electric potential within the space-charge layers shifts the association equilibrium so that associate diffusion dominates in the bulk whereas isolated vacancy diffusion dominates within the space-charge layers.

Here, using low-dose scanning transmission electron microscopy, we discover the existence of ferroelastic twin boundaries in vapor-deposited CsPbI3 thin films, parallel to {110} and {112}. Remarkably, despite photoactive CsPbI3 being centrosymmetric and non-polar, we observe directly that Pb atoms shift at {110} twin boundaries driving a local ferroelectric-like polarisation. These polar twin walls form an intrinsic array of nanoscale functional interfaces, spaced ~30-50 nm apart, embedded within the non-polar perovskite lattice. In contrast, {112} twin boundaries remain non-polar but strongly suppress octahedral tilt and off-centre Cs atom displacements, revealing a different untapped ferroic degree of freedom.

The former was known to induce an internal U(1) gauge flux indirectly through the charge fluctuations and ring exchange, and thus could lead to the formation of a chiral spin liquid. The latter could spontaneously generate a uniform field-dependent internal gauge flux, driving a conically-ordered state. The competition and interplay between these two field effects are discussed through a generic spin-1/2 $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_χ$ model and with the experimental consequences.

In this study, we employ a machine learning interatomic potential to investigate the effect of uniaxial compressive stress on polarization switching and domain wall evolution in the tetragonal phase of BaTiO3. This study revealed a critical stress about 120 MPa which 90 degree polarization switching occurs. Beyond the critical stress, larger supercells exhibit lower activation energies for polarization switching with 180-degree domain wall formation and weaker constraints from periodic boundary conditions, thereby facilitating domain-wall formation. Besides, Increasing compressive stress reduces both the remnant polarization and the coercive field, while a double hysteresis loop emerges at a stress level of 80 MPa.

Here, we present the Reorienting Off-path Nudged Elastic Bands (RONEB), an adaptive hybrid algorithm that integrates the double ended nature of the NEB with the acceleration of single ended Min-Mode Following methods. RONEB provides stability based on the history of the path optimization, relative force triggering, and an alignment-based back-off penalty to dynamically decouple the climbing image from the elastic band constraints. We benchmark the method against the standard Climbing Image NEB (CI-NEB) across the Baker-Chan transition state test set using the PET-MAD machine-learned potential and the OptBench Pt(111) heptamer island surface diffusion set. A Bayesian analysis of the performance data quantifies a median reduction in gradient calls of 46.3% [95% CrI: -54.7%, -36.9%] relative to the baseline, while surface diffusion tests reveal a 28% reduction across 59 metallic rearrangement mechanisms.

The existence of a comparable, universal force for systems undergoing a first-order transition has remained an unresolved fundamental question. The proposed Orderphobic Effect is one such potential mechanism. It arises from minimisation of the interfacial free energy between solutes that locally nucleate a disordered phase. Here, we report the first experimental demonstration and quantitative measurement of the Orderphobic Effect. Using a driven, non-equilibrium quasi-2D granular fluid undergoing a first-order order-disorder transition, we show that specifically designed solutes in an ordered phase nucleate a coexisting ``bubble'' of the disordered phase. By analysing its capillary fluctuations, we confirm that this phenomenon occurs due to the proximity to phase-coexistence, and we directly quantify the attractive force by measuring the interaction free energy between solutes. The observation of this general fluctuation-mediated force in a non-equilibrium steady state strongly supports its claimed universality. Our work establishes the Orderphobic Effect as the first-order equivalent to the CCE, providing a new, general route for controlling self-assembly and aggregation in soft matter and non-equilibrium systems."}

Within this framework, we systematically revisit the Cross-Hohenberg classification of instabilities to assess the feasibility and characteristics of the various types of instability arising from the interplay between entropic and energetic contributions. Our analysis demonstrates that only type I and type III instabilities (the Cross-Hohenberg classification) can occur in this system; Energetic contributions do not explicitly generate instabilities, but may implicitly control their occurrence through their influence on the fixed-point (steady-state) concentrations. In cases where instabilities of different types coexist, we show that the resulting patterns are highly sensitive to the relative strengths of the competing instabilities."}

We investigate characteristic superconducting length scales in all-flat-band systems under the assumptions of time-reversal symmetry and spatially-uniform pairing, focusing on the size of the lowest-lying two-body bound state, the average Cooper-pair size, and the zero-temperature coherence length in two-band Hubbard models. Using the Creutz ladder and the $χ$ lattice as representative examples, we show that both the two-body bound-state size and the many-body Cooper-pair size remain finite and small in the weak-coupling limit, being controlled by the quantum metric of the flat bands. By contrast, the coherence length exhibits qualitatively distinct behavior, diverging in the dilute limit and in the vicinity of insulating regimes. These results demonstrate that, in flat-band superconductors, the pair size and the coherence length are fundamentally distinct physical quantities and highlight the central role of band geometry in shaping superconducting length scales when kinetic energy is quenched."}

The idea is simple yet decisive: a third-order expansion of the Boltzmann equation in the magnetic field reveals that the threefold component originates from the relative positions of the mirror planes in the crystals with respect to the measurement setups. Remarkably, the threefold contribution should be ubiquitous because this symmetry condition can be realized across a broad range of crystals.

The key insight of our theory is that, due to the very narrow bandwidth of MATBG, correlation-enhanced valley and spin Zeeman terms are critical for shaping the intricate Hofstadter spectrum, resulting in an interwoven, flavor-resolved (spin and valley) Hofstadter spectrum that can well describe the observed CCI states. Crucially, due to the Zeeman effect, the crossings between these flavor-polarized Hofstadter spectra are magnetic-field-dependent, causing certain CCI states to emerge only above a critical field. This is the main mechanism underlying the critical field phenomenon of the CCI states observed in experiments. Our theory provides a clear and unified physical picture for the correlated Hofstadter spectrum in MATBG."}

A. Müller as the \"drosophila of solid-state physics\", has been extensively investigated over the last seventy five years for its intricate coupling of structural, electronic, and dielectric properties and continues to serve as a foundational platform for advancing oxide electronics. In its pristine form, SrTiO$_3$ exhibits quantum paraelectric behavior below 35 K and undergoes an antiferrodistortive phase transition near 105 K. This transition generates ferroelastic twin domains separated by a dense network of domain walls, which function as nanoscale structural defects with far-reaching consequences. While the static influence of ferroelastic domain walls on carrier transport in electron-doped SrTiO$_3$ is well established, recent experimental results show that the emergence of polarity at these walls, combined with strain fields and inherent quantum fluctuations, induces correlated dynamical phenomena such as glass-like relaxations of electrons and memory effects. In this review, we highlight these recent advances, focusing on the subtle interplay between the emergence of nanoscale polar order, quantum fluctuations, and long-range strain fields. We propose that understanding charge carrier dynamics in the background of these complex ferroelastic domain wall landscapes offers a new paradigm for exploring electronic transport in the presence of local polar order and quantum fluctuations, with broad implications for correlated oxides."}

In this work, we present a strategy based on phase-transition-induced activation of cross-relaxation processes in LiYO2:Tb3+. The monoclinic-to-tetragonal structural phase transition modifies the point symmetry of Tb3+ ions in the host lattice, enhances the Stark effect, and enables energetic resonance required for efficient cross relaxation. Consequently, emission originating from the 5D3 excited state is rapidly quenched relative to that from the 5D4 level above approximately 300 K, resulting in a distinct temperature-dependent color change of the emitted light from blue to green. This mechanism yields exceptionally high chromaticity-coordinate-based sensitivities, reaching SRx,max = 0.40% K-1 and SRy,max=0.72% K-1 at 410 K. Furthermore, phase-transition-driven modifications of the Tb3+ emission spectral profile enable the realization of a multimode luminescent thermometer with a maximum relative sensitivity of SRmax=13% K-1. The practical applicability of this system is demonstrated through an ON-OFF luminescent thermal switch and fully filter-free, dynamic two-dimensional thermal imaging using the blue and green channels of a standard digital camera, enabling intuitive visualization, remote readout, and temperature mapping under dynamic conditions."}

The Kerr rotation is sensitive to time-reversal symmetry breaking and generally proportional to magnetization, enabling optical readout of the up and down spin states in ferromagnets. By contrast, antiferromagnets with a collinear antiparallel spin arrangement have long been considered inactive to such magneto-optical responses, because of Tt-symmetry (time-reversal T followed by translation t symmetry) and lack of macroscopic magnetization. Here, we report the observation of giant magneto-optical Kerr effect in a room-temperature antiferromagnetic insulator alpha-Fe2O3. In this compound, the up-down and down-up spin states induce the opposite sign of spontaneous Kerr effect, whose Kerr rotation angle turned out to be exceptionally large (~ 80 mdeg, comparable to typical ferromagnets). Our first-principles calculations successfully reproduce both the absolute magnitude and spectral shape of the Kerr rotation and ellipticity with remarkable accuracy, which unambiguously proves that it originates from a Tt-symmetry-broken collinear antiferromagnetic order, rather than magnetization. This compound hosts temperature-dependent transition between easy-plane and easy-axis antiferromagnetic states, and their contrasting behaviors are also investigated in detail. The present results demonstrate that even a simple collinear antiferromagnetic order can induce a giant magneto-optical Kerr effect, and highlight Tt-symmetry-broken antiferromagnets as a promising material platform for highly sensitive optical detection of up-down and down-up spin states."}

This review first discusses the reported experimental evidence of flexoelectricity induced contact electrification and interlayer charge transfer in conducting thin film based heterostructures. The interlayer charge transfer creates a gradient of charge carrier in both the thin films constituting the heterostructure and also modifies the electron-electron interactions. Further, the interlayer charge transfer changes the electron-phonon coupling, spin-phonon coupling and magnetoelectronic coupling that give rise to new physical behavior, which did not exist prior to the interlayer charge transfer. The new physical behaviors from interlayer charge transfer and their mechanistic origins are reanalyzed and discussed, which include spin-Hall effect of charge carriers, topological Hall effect of magnetoelectronic electromagnon, inhomogeneous magnetoelectronic multiferroic effect, flexoelectronic proximity effect and topological spin texture. This review article presents a unified picture of current status and future directions that will provide the scientists a stepping stone for research in the field of flexoelectricity mediated contact electrification and interlayer charge transfer mediated behavior in the micro/nanoscale heterostructures of the conducting materials."}

Temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy reveals phase transition signatures in both inorganic lattice and organic moieties by detecting variations in their vibrational modes. Changes in the conformational arrangement of the organic cations to an ordered state coincide with a phase transition in the 1L systems with the shortest ammonium moieties.

Establishing the diversity of ground states across different Ruddlesden-Popper phases is crucial for elucidating the superconducting mechanisms in these nickelates. Motivated by the recent report of superconductivity in hybrid 1212-type La5Ni3O11, we synthesized and investigated the long-range-ordered hybrid 1313-type La3Ni2O7. In contrast to its bilayer counterpart, the 1313-type La3Ni2O7 exhibits characteristic semiconducting behavior at ambient pressure, displaying a distinct anomaly at 170 K. This behavior is consistently evidenced by measurements of both magnetic susceptibility and specific heat. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy unambiguously indicates a spin-density-wave transition occurring at 170 K. High-pressure electrical transport measurements demonstrate the induction of metallization under pressure, yet reveal no discernible traces of superconductivity up to 65 GPa. Our findings establish hybrid 1313-type La3Ni2O7 as a new member of the Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate family exhibiting a distinct spin-density-wave transition, and offers a new platform for investigating the interplay among crystal structure, electronic orders, and superconductivity in hybrid nickelates."}

Our results show that the underestimation of $T_c$ primarily stems from the limitations of the exchange-correlation functional, rather than inaccuracies in the MLFF fitting. We uncover a critical interplay between finite-size effects and the range of interatomic interactions: although short-range MLFFs appear to yield better agreement with experimental $T_c$, this improvement results from a fortuitous cancellation of errors. Incorporating explicit long-range interactions improves accuracy for larger supercells but ultimately leads to lower predicted $T_c$ values. These findings highlight that accurate finite-temperature predictions require not only high-quality training data and sufficiently large simulation cells, but also the explicit treatment of long-range interactions and improved exchange-correlation functionals."}

Applying this approach to twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ modeled by first-principles-derived moiré Hamiltonians, we find that the first moiré valence band is dominated by the generalized zeroth LL across a broad range of twist angles, facilitating the formation of Abelian fractional Chern insulators in the Jain sequences. The second moiré band, renormalized via Hartree-Fock calculations at hole filling $ν_h = 2$, is dominated by the generalized first LL at twist angles $θ= 2.45^\\circ$ and $2.13^\\circ$. At $θ= 2.45^\\circ$, we find numerical evidence for a non-Abelian Moore--Read (MR) state at $ν_h = 5/2$, with consistent signatures in both the energy spectrum and the particle entanglement spectrum. Interpolation studies further demonstrate an adiabatic connection between this state and the MR state in the conventional first LL.

We demonstrate that the transition-metal substitution activates otherwise symmetry-forbidden magnon modes through mirror-symmetry breaking of the underlying spin-orbital configuration. This effect can be theoretically explained by the local structural distortions induced in the RuO$_6$ octahedra near the dopant, that enable the observation of mixed-parity one-magnon modes.

In this work, we investigate phonon dynamics originating from an acoustic analog - the surface phonon Hall viscosity - that can also occur at the surface of magnetic topological insulators. This surface phonon Hall viscosity stems from the Nieh-Yan action in the strain response of topological insulators, where strain acts as the effective vierbein field for the bulk low-energy massive Dirac fermions. Crucially, this viscosity term entangles phonon dynamics with surface magnetization. In magnetic topological insulator films, we find that this interaction causes acoustic phonons to become chiral when the magnetization at the top and bottom surfaces is parallel, and nonreciprocal when it is anti-parallel. We further discuss potential experimental signatures of phonon dynamics induced by surface phonon Hall viscosity, specifically the phonon thermal Hall effect and magnon-polarons.

Within this framework, superconductivity arises from the formation of a symmetry-broken superconducting configuration (SCC) generated by atomic perturbations of the normal conducting configuration (NCC). The SCC emerges through electron-phonon interaction and gives rise to distinct straight one-dimensional tunnels (SODTs) in the charge density difference of electrons and/or holes. These SODTs originate from regular and systematic atomic displacements between the SCC and NCC, a phenomenon revealed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. To further verify this framework, we performed DFT-based calculations for 12 hexagonal close-packed (hcp) elements (Be, Mg, Sc, Y, Ti, Zr, Hf, Tc, Re, Ru, Os, and Zn), 5 body-centered cubic (bcc) elements (V, Nb, Ta, Mo, and W), and the compound Nb3Sn. Our results indicate that all these materials exhibit superconductivity at 0 K and 0 GPa, as evidenced by the predicted SODTs. Notably, Mg, Sc, and Y are predicted to be superconducting under ambient pressure, a finding that awaits experimental confirmation."}

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) offers high spatial resolution together with access to structural, electronic, and magnetic degrees of freedom. However, electrical transport measurements on functional quantum devices remain rare, particularly at liquid helium temperature. Here, we demonstrate electrical transport measurements of niobium nitride (NbN) devices inside a TEM using a continuous-flow liquid-helium-cooled sample holder. By optimizing a thermal radiation shield to limit radiation from the nearby pole pieces of the objective lens, we achieve an estimated base sample temperature of 8-9 K, as inferred from the superconducting transition temperatures of our devices. We find that both electron beam imaging and the magnetic field of the objective lens perturb the superconducting state, because the base sample temperature is close to the superconducting transition temperature of NbN. Finally, we perform calculations that underscore the importance of cryo-shielding for minimizing thermal radiation onto the device. This capability enables correlative low-temperature TEM studies, in which structural, spectroscopic, and electrical transport data can be obtained from the same device, thereby providing a platform for probing the microscopic origins of quantum phenomena."}

By deriving local estimators suitable for advanced numerical methods, we demonstrate that these metrics effectively characterize quantum phase transitions: in the one-dimensional spinless $t$-$V$ model, they sharply identify the Luttinger liquid to charge density wave transition, while in the two-dimensional honeycomb lattice via determinant quantum Monte Carlo, they faithfully capture the critical exponents of the Gross-Neveu-Ising universality class. Furthermore, extending our analysis to the fractional quantum Hall regime, we unveil a non-trivial spatial texture of magic in the Laughlin state, revealing signatures of short-range exclusion correlations.

Examples include intracellular transport via stochastically gated ion channels and pores in the plasma membrane of a cell, intercellular transport between cells coupled by stochastically gated gap junctions, and oxygen transport in insect respiration. Most studies of stochastically-gated interfaces are based on macroscopic models that track the particle concentration averaged with respect to different realisations of the gate dynamics. In this paper we use renewal theory to develop a probabilistic model of single-particle Brownian motion (BM) through a stochastically gated interface. We proceed by constructing a renewal equation for 1D BM with an interface at the origin, which effectively sews together a sequence of BMs on the half-line with a totally absorbing boundary at $x=0$. Each time the particle is absorbed, the stochastic process is immediately restarted according to the following rule: if the gate is closed then BM restarts on the same side of the interface, whereas if the gate is open then BM restarts on either side of the interface with equal probability. In order to ensure that diffusion restarts in a state that avoids immediate re-absorption. we assume that whenever the particle reaches the interface it is instantaneously shifted a distance $ε$ from the origin. We explicitly solve the renewal equation for $ε>0$ and show how the solution of a corresponding forward Kolmogorov equation is recovered in the limit $ε\\rightarrow 0$. However, the renewal equation provides a more general mathematical framework by explicitly separating the first passage time problem of detecting the gated interface (absorption) and the subsequent rule for restarting BM. We conclude by extending the theory to higher-dimensional interfaces."}

We observe that in a certain range of parameters, the system requires non-standard statistical descriptions, indicating a breakdown of conventional thermalization.

In the absence of external tilt, the formalism naturally recovers the classical Lifson-Jackson formula for the effective diffusion coefficient. When a constant bias is applied, breaking detailed balance and inducing a finite stationary current, the same approach yields the Stratonovich expressions for the effective drift and diffusion in tilted periodic potentials. Beyond one dimension, we demonstrate that the same additive-functional structure extends directly to two-dimensional and general N dimensional periodic diffusions, leading to the standard homogenized drift and diffusion tensor expressed in terms of vector-valued correctors.

Remarkably, the threefold contribution should be ubiquitous because this symmetry condition can be realized across a broad range of crystals.

Despite their central role, direct and quantitative access to the out-of-plane atomic structure in these systems has remained elusive due to their nanoscale dimensions. Here, we introduce an automated dark-field electron tomography technique that enables three-dimensional structural analysis of atomically thin materials with sub-angstrom precision. Applying this method to twisted bilayer WSe$_2$, we uncover a significant expansion of the interlayer spacing compared to the bulk configuration, exceeding 0.1 angstrom, along with a remarkable temperature-driven interlayer decoupling unique to the twisted bilayer. Ultrafast measurement further reveals optically induced interlayer separation of ~0.2 angstrom on the picosecond timescale, attributed to transient exciton formation. These findings not only establish a powerful approach for visualizing hidden out-of-plane structures in atomically thin micro-flake materials, but also uncover the intrinsic fragility and dynamical tunability of interlayer coupling in moiré-engineered 2-dimensional materials."}

A. Müller as the \"drosophila of solid-state physics\", has been extensively investigated over the last seventy five years for its intricate coupling of structural, electronic, and dielectric properties and continues to serve as a foundational platform for advancing oxide electronics. In its pristine form, SrTiO$_3$ exhibits quantum paraelectric behavior below 35 K and undergoes an antiferrodistortive phase transition near 105 K. This transition generates ferroelastic twin domains separated by a dense network of domain walls, which function as nanoscale structural defects with far-reaching consequences. While the static influence of ferroelastic domain walls on carrier transport in electron-doped SrTiO$_3$ is well established, recent experimental results show that the emergence of polarity at these walls, combined with strain fields and inherent quantum fluctuations, induces correlated dynamical phenomena such as glass-like relaxations of electrons and memory effects. In this review, we highlight these recent advances, focusing on the subtle interplay between the emergence of nanoscale polar order, quantum fluctuations, and long-range strain fields. We propose that understanding charge carrier dynamics in the background of these complex ferroelastic domain wall landscapes offers a new paradigm for exploring electronic transport in the presence of local polar order and quantum fluctuations, with broad implications for correlated oxides."}

The computational cost of Hamiltonian orthogonalization scales as O(N^3), which severely hinders electronic structure calculations for large-scale systems containing hundreds of thousands to millions of atoms. To address this issue, we develop GPUTB-2, a framework that learns implicitly orthogonality-preserving Hamiltonians by training directly on electronic band structures. Benefiting from an E(3)-equivariant network accelerated by Gaunt tensor product and SO(2) tensor product layers, GPUTB-2 achieves significantly higher accuracy than GPUTB across multiple benchmark systems. Moreover, GPUTB-2 accurately predicts large-scale electronic structures, including transport properties of temperature-perturbed SnSe and the band structures of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene. By further integrating this framework with the linear-scaling quantum transport (LSQT) method, we investigate the electronic properties of million-atom amorphous graphene and uncover pressure-induced electronic structure transitions in more complex amorphous silicon. Together, these results establish GPUTB-2 as a high-accuracy and scalable approach for predicting orthogonal Hamiltonians."}

Upon ageing at 800 C for 15 min, two co-nanoprecipitation modes are observed: B2 forming together with kappa and B2 forming separately from kappa in the FCC matrix. APT reveals that the B2 precipitate next to kappa (referred to as B2I) is close to an FeAl type phase, while the isolated B2 precipitate (referred to as B2II) is close to a NiAl type phase. The kappa precipitates maintain a nearly constant Al content of approximately 18.4 at.% regardless of their precipitation position. DFT confirms that kappa may accommodate limited Ni substitution at Fe sites without losing structural stability, and that Fe Ni atomic exchange between kappa and B2 is thermodynamically favorable at 800 C.

The Kerr rotation is sensitive to time-reversal symmetry breaking and generally proportional to magnetization, enabling optical readout of the up and down spin states in ferromagnets. By contrast, antiferromagnets with a collinear antiparallel spin arrangement have long been considered inactive to such magneto-optical responses, because of Tt-symmetry (time-reversal T followed by translation t symmetry) and lack of macroscopic magnetization. Here, we report the observation of giant magneto-optical Kerr effect in a room-temperature antiferromagnetic insulator alpha-Fe2O3. In this compound, the up-down and down-up spin states induce the opposite sign of spontaneous Kerr effect, whose Kerr rotation angle turned out to be exceptionally large (~ 80 mdeg, comparable to typical ferromagnets). Our first-principles calculations successfully reproduce both the absolute magnitude and spectral shape of the Kerr rotation and ellipticity with remarkable accuracy, which unambiguously proves that it originates from a Tt-symmetry-broken collinear antiferromagnetic order, rather than magnetization. This compound hosts temperature-dependent transition between easy-plane and easy-axis antiferromagnetic states, and their contrasting behaviors are also investigated in detail. The present results demonstrate that even a simple collinear antiferromagnetic order can induce a giant magneto-optical Kerr effect, and highlight Tt-symmetry-broken antiferromagnets as a promising material platform for highly sensitive optical detection of up-down and down-up spin states."}

Here, we investigate the effect of Ru content on electrochemistry and defect formation in Au-Pd-Pt-Ru CCSS thin films. Such defects could provide active sites when terminating at the CCSS surface or modify surface composition through preferential segregation. A thin-film material library covering a wide composition range was fabricated by room-temperature combinatorial co-sputtering. High-throughput compositional, structural and functional characterization, including electron microscopy equipped with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and electrochemical screening, were used to correlate composition and microstructural features with catalytic activity. Three representative compositions selected from the library - Au68Pd13Pt15Ru4, Au27Pd24Pt23Ru26, and Au9Pd21Pt18Ru52 - were examined in detail. The three samples exhibit face-centered cubic structures, with lattice contraction occurring with increasing Ru content. In addition, with increasing Ru content, a transition from a high density of nanotwins to high-density, atomic-layer stacking faults was observed. Moreover, the hydrogen evolution reaction activity improves with higher Ru content.

We extend previous formulations of parity-preserving fermionic mean-field theory (PP-FMFT) by including fermionic displacement operators in the variational Ansatz. Unlike PP-FMFT, PV-FMFT can be applied to general spin-1/2 Hamiltonians, describe quenches from arbitrary initial spin-1/2 product states, and compute local and non-local observables in a straight-forward manner at the same modest computational cost as PP-FMFT -- scaling as $O(N^3)$ in the worst case for a system of $N$ spins or fermionic modes. We demonstrate that PV-FMFT can exactly capture the imaginary- and real-time dynamics of non-interacting spin-1/2 Hamiltonians. We then study the post quench-dynamics of the one- and two-dimensional Ising model in presence of longitudinal and transversal fields with PV-FMFT and compute the single site magnetization and correlation functions, and compare them against results from other state-of-the-art numerical approaches.

By shifting the laser beam position on the cantilever, direction-dependent piezoresponse signals are acquired analogous to classical vector PFM, but without the need to rotate the sample. Using polycrystalline ErMnO$_{3}$ as a model system, we demonstrate that the reconstructed piezoresponse vectors correlate one-to-one with the crystallographic orientations of the micrometer-sized grains, carrying grain-orientation and domain-related information.

This review first discusses the reported experimental evidence of flexoelectricity induced contact electrification and interlayer charge transfer in conducting thin film based heterostructures. The interlayer charge transfer creates a gradient of charge carrier in both the thin films constituting the heterostructure and also modifies the electron-electron interactions. Further, the interlayer charge transfer changes the electron-phonon coupling, spin-phonon coupling and magnetoelectronic coupling that give rise to new physical behavior, which did not exist prior to the interlayer charge transfer. The new physical behaviors from interlayer charge transfer and their mechanistic origins are reanalyzed and discussed, which include spin-Hall effect of charge carriers, topological Hall effect of magnetoelectronic electromagnon, inhomogeneous magnetoelectronic multiferroic effect, flexoelectronic proximity effect and topological spin texture. This review article presents a unified picture of current status and future directions that will provide the scientists a stepping stone for research in the field of flexoelectricity mediated contact electrification and interlayer charge transfer mediated behavior in the micro/nanoscale heterostructures of the conducting materials."}

Population-dependent scaling forms for the number densities of cluster areas are uncovered.

Continuous control over superconductor-insulator transition (SIT) in nickelates remains particularly challenging, hindering both fundamental understanding and potential applications. Here, we demonstrate SIT in infinite-layer nickelate superconductors utilizing multiple techniques, including an ${operando}$ monitored reduction (OMR) method. OMR enables ultrawide-range continuous modulation of the Ni 3${d}$ orbital electron occupancy from ~3${d}^7$ to ~3${d}^9$. The 3${d}$ occupancy is calibrated through systematic synchrotron X-ray absorption (XAS), combined with scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) annular bright field (ABF) analysis of oxygen atoms. SIT is further modulated via ionic liquid gating and magnetic field. Strikingly different from cuprates, our Nernst effect measurements show that pairing initiates at the onset of the resistive drop. The subsequent emergence of the Meissner effect at zero resistance marks the establishment of global phase coherence. Angle-dependent magnetotransport within the transition temperature regime indicates a mixture of two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) superconducting characters, suggesting the observed SIT deviates from the canonical 2D model. Our results provide a unique perspective on the interplay of structural and electronic phase transitions in the infinite-layer nickelates across the oxygen content-magnetic field-temperature parameter space."}

This leads to a directional asymmetry, whereby the photocurrent distinguishes opposite orientations of an applied static field. The effect originates from an LV-induced deformation of the interband phase and can be isolated experimentally by comparing field-reversed configurations, with vanishing response at transverse orientations, providing an internal consistency check.

Here, we exploit TERS in a cryogenic scanning tunneling microscope junction to perform Raman hyperspectral mapping of single iron phthalocyanine (FePc) molecules in three non-equivalent adsorption configurations on Ag surfaces. We explore the changes in the vibrational modes of FePc molecules adsorbed on two distinct silver crystal terminations with differing symmetry, Ag(111) and Ag(110), revealing how subtle variations in the adsorption geometry due to substrate anisotropy can strongly influence molecular vibrations, lifting the degeneracy of individual normal modes.

Through epitaxial stabilization, the disordered A2 alloy can be extended from 19% to 30% gallium resulting in a magnetostrictive coefficient almost twice than that which is seen in rare earth magnetostrictors like SmFe2. In a composite magnetoelectric structure, this makes epitaxially-stabilized iron gallium a key material for energy-efficient beyond CMOS technologies. The energy dissipation and speed of magnetoelectric switching, however, is affected by the magnetic resonance frequency and damping. Here we report the evolution of the ferromagnetic resonance and key materials parameters (magnetic anisotropy, magnetic damping, and magnetostriction coefficient) for 70 nm thick epitaxially-stabilized single crystal A2 FeGa films beyond 19% Ga. Using flip chip ferromagnetic resonance (1-14 GHz), we find that the Gilbert damping parameter spans the range of 0.09-0.16 and decreases as the Ga concentration increases. This correlates an increasing magnetoelastic coupling with a reduction in the Gilbert damping. We find that the effective damping is a mix of contributions from the intrinsic magnon-phonon scattering and other scattering/dissipation mechanisms, with the latter being dominant especially at high Ga composition. Our results provide insight into the mechanism of magnetic relaxation in metastable high magnetostriction materials and potential switching behavior of composite magnetoelectrics."}

We present an iterative approach that uses simulated Kikuchi patterns to resolve several overlapping diffraction signals. For each measured EBSD pattern, our method first identifies the best-fit simulated Kikuchi pattern using dynamic template matching. This simulated, ideal reference pattern is then further processed to optimally match the experimental image, uncovering any underlying weaker signals after subtraction. Repeatedly utilizing dynamic template matching and pattern subtraction on residual signals of subsequent steps enables the identification of minor phases that might otherwise be missed from the probing volume of the EBSD map point. This method significantly improves phase detection in complex materials, addressing a key limitation of conventional EBSD analysis that conventionally assigns a single phase to each map point.

We identify the dominant coupling channels and characterize their observable signatures in the QD response. We predict strong linear energy shifts under volumetric strain and quadratic behavior under shear strain, especially in GaAs QDs. The piezoelectric effect is dominated by polarizability, which also leads to a quadratic response. The simulations show energy modulations up to 0.7 meV for an acoustic wave with 0.1 nm amplitude. The quadratic response to shear strain and piezoelectric field leads to frequency doubling in the QD response to a mechanical wave and to non-harmonic time traces when linear and quadratic effects contribute to a similar degree.

In the present study, we demonstrate by means of continuum simulations that under certain conditions $r > 1$ is achievable for faster cation diffusion along grain boundaries in an acceptor-doped perovskite ceramic. Diffusion profiles for a two-dimensional bicrystal geometry are obtained by solving, first, Poisson's equation, and subsequently, the diffusion equation. The specific case we consider is cation migration occurring by two related mechanisms, by isolated cation vacancies and by defect associates of cation and anion vacancies; the electric potential within the space-charge layers shifts the association equilibrium so that associate diffusion dominates in the bulk whereas isolated vacancy diffusion dominates within the space-charge layers. The conditions under which $r > 1$ is observed are described, and issues with experimental confirmation are discussed."}

Conversely, single-ended eigenmode-following techniques offer efficiency but cannot often be constrained between specific states. Here, we present the Reorienting Off-path Nudged Elastic Bands (RONEB), an adaptive hybrid algorithm that integrates the double ended nature of the NEB with the acceleration of single ended Min-Mode Following methods. RONEB provides stability based on the history of the path optimization, relative force triggering, and an alignment-based back-off penalty to dynamically decouple the climbing image from the elastic band constraints. We benchmark the method against the standard Climbing Image NEB (CI-NEB) across the Baker-Chan transition state test set using the PET-MAD machine-learned potential and the OptBench Pt(111) heptamer island surface diffusion set. A Bayesian analysis of the performance data quantifies a median reduction in gradient calls of 46.3% [95% CrI: -54.7%, -36.9%] relative to the baseline, while surface diffusion tests reveal a 28% reduction across 59 metallic rearrangement mechanisms. These results establish RONEB as a highly effective tool for high-throughput automated chemical discovery."}

Loring", "Alexander Cerjan"], "title": "Efficient local classification of parity-based material topology", "comment": "11 pages, 5 figures", "summary": "Although the classification of crystalline materials can be generally handled by momentum-space-based approaches, topological classification of aperiodic materials remains an outstanding challenge, as the absence of translational symmetry renders such conventional approaches inapplicable. Here, we present a numerically efficient real-space framework for classifying parity-based $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topology in aperiodic systems based on the spectral localizer framework and the direct computation of the sign of a Pfaffian associated with a large sparse skew-symmetric matrix. Unlike projector-based or momentum-space-based approaches, our method does not rely on translational symmetry, spectral gaps in the Hamiltonian's bulk, or gapped auxiliary operators such as spin projections, and instead provides a local, energy-resolved topological invariant accompanied by an intrinsic measure of topological protection. A central contribution of this work is the development of a scalable sparse factorization algorithm that enables the reliable determination of the Pfaffian's sign for large sparse matrices, making the approach practical to realistic physical materials. We apply this framework to identify the quantum spin Hall effect in quasicrystalline class AII systems, including gapless heterostructures, and to diagnose fragile topology in a large $C_2 \\mathcal{T}$-symmetric photonic quasicrystal. Overall, our results demonstrate that the spectral localizer, combined with efficient sparse numerical methods, provides a unified and robust tool for diagnosing parity-based topological phases in aperiodic electronic, photonic, and acoustic materials where conventional band-theoretic indexes are inapplicable."}

Brenner"], "title": "Gradient-based optimization of exact stochastic kinetic models", "comment": "9 pages, 4 figures, Supplementary Information", "summary": "Stochastic kinetic models describe systems across biology, chemistry, and physics where discrete events and small populations render deterministic approximations inadequate. Parameter inference and inverse design in these systems require optimizing over trajectories generated by the Stochastic Simulation Algorithm, but the discrete reaction events involved are inherently non-differentiable. We present an approach based on straight-through Gumbel-Softmax estimation that maintains exact stochastic simulations in the forward pass while approximating gradients through a continuous relaxation applied only in the backward pass. We demonstrate robust performance on parameter inference in stochastic gene expression, accurately recovering kinetic rates of telegraph promoter models from both moment statistics and full steady-state distributions across diverse and challenging parameter regimes. We further demonstrate the method's applicability to inverse design problems in stochastic thermodynamics, characterizing Pareto-optimal trade-offs between non-equilibrium currents and entropy production. The ability to efficiently differentiate through exact stochastic simulations provides a foundation for systematic inference and rational design across the many domains governed by continuous-time Markov dynamics."}
