Using a simple framework of Brinkman equations we find that hydrodynamic electron flows exhibit a geometric skin effect: sharp obstacles locally enhance the current suppressing it far from the edges where the flow is unobstructed. This effect arises within hydrodynamic transport with finite momentum relaxation and does not rely on ballistic dynamics. Our results provide a natural hydrodynamic interpretation of edge-enhanced and double-bump current profiles observed in constricted geometries. By comparing with recent scanning NV magnetometry experiments on gated graphene, we demonstrate that such flow patterns are consistent with viscous hydrodynamics shaped by geometry, clarifying the role of geometric effects in the interpretation of electronic flow experiments."}

We define an inferential efficiency as the ratio of information gain to cumulative memory erasure cost, with inefficiency arising from unexploited correlations between the measured system and memories, and/or between memories and environment (noise). Using this efficiency, we benchmark two limiting measurement paradigms: sequential, in which the same memory is exploited iteratively, and parallel, in which many memories are exploited simultaneously. In both cases, the minimal erasure cost reflects correlations across memories: temporal in sequential, spatial in parallel. Remarkably, when all system-memory correlations are exploited for inference, both paradigms attain the same minimal erasure cost, even in the presence of noise. Conversely, the parallel paradigm performs better in the presence of unexploited correlations, stemming from hidden memories' degrees of freedom. This approach provides a quantitative, physically grounded criterion to compare inference strategies, determine their efficiency, and link target information gains to their minimal entropic cost."}

The use of TR-APXPS allows for real-time monitoring of chemical changes at the surface of Iron oxides during reduction, providing valuable insights into the reaction mechanisms and kinetics involved. One key challenge in analyzing TR-APXPS data is the presence of overlapping peaks and complex spectral features, which can make accurate quantification and interpretation difficult. Traditional spectral fitting methods may struggle with these complexities and result in ambiguous or inaccurate results. However, the chemometric approaches are promising tools to overcome these challenges by extracting pure spectral profiles of individual chemical species and their temporal profiles from the complex and overlapping data. The results obtained from the TR-APXPS coupled with PCA and MCR-ALS analysis provide a detailed and precise understanding of the surface chemical changes during the Fe2O3 reduction. This includes identifying and following the formation of various intermediate species and their evolution over time, which permits later to establish correlations between surface chemistry and process conditions. The integration of both chemometric tools in TR-APXPS data analysis not only addresses the challenges associated with complex spectral features, but also contributes to a deeper understanding of the underlying chemical changes and their dynamics. The obtained results have significant implications for process optimization, material synthesis, and tailoring of material properties for specific applications."}

At room temperature we observe narrow, long-lived photoluminescence (PL) lines in the telecom band, characteristic of erbium emitters. Upon cooling to 3 K and reheating, the Er3+ PL intensity and excited-state lifetime display pronounced thermal hysteresis with a minimum near 132 K, at the reported antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition of CrSBr. Remarkably, we observe magnetic signatures persisting over a broader temperature range than expected from bulk benchmarks, suggesting nanoscale magnetic order that locally survives beyond the nominal phase boundary. Further, a moderate in-plane field of 0.3 T shifts the PL minimum by +8 K, which we tentatively associate to field-biased ferromagnetic correlations."}

Such materials are not only highly nonlinear but also display intrinsic stochasticity arising from their complex and heterogeneous microstructure. Despite recent advances in data-driven constitutive modeling, most existing approaches remain deterministic and fail to quantify predictive uncertainty, thereby limiting their reliability in downstream mechanical analyses. In this work, we propose a probabilistic, data-driven constitutive modeling framework for anisotropic soft materials that explicitly accounts for uncertainty through conformalized quantile regression applied to tensor-valued fields. The proposed framework is built upon a strain-invariant, polyconvex formulation that ensures thermodynamic consistency and promotes robust predictive performance, including in extrapolative regimes. A key advantage of the proposed approach is its simplicity: it can be applied in a plug-and-play manner to endow existing deterministic models with probabilistic predictions, while remaining distribution-free and requiring no assumptions on the underlying data distribution. Moreover, the method is straightforward to train, scalable to models with a large number of parameters, and avoids Monte Carlo sampling at inference, making it computationally efficient and well suited for uncertainty propagation in large-scale mechanical simulations.

The OTF protocol to construct MLFFs adaptively triggers first-principles calculations only when newly encountered configurations lie outside the current model's domain of confidence, allowing robust, parameter-free MLFFs to be built from merely 1000 AIMD-sampled configurations per polymer. These MLFFs are then utilized to perform long-time cooling simulations on amorphous supercells containing several thousand atoms. Applied across twelve polymers spanning aromatic, aliphatic, heteroatomic, and branched chemistries, the method yields predictions in excellent accord with experiment while reducing computational cost by approximately six orders of magnitude relative to AIMD.

As expected, descriptors related to local density capably distinguish LDA and HDA; however, phase identity is surprisingly encoded within the first coordination shell. Furthermore, LDA transitions to HDA by a simple redistribution of LDA- and HDA-like environments with no evident intermediate structures, in accordance with a first-order-like transition that contrasts with the gradual evolution observed in other amorphous systems such as metallic glasses.

The results demonstrate that solvation stabilizes charged species so strongly that reactivity indices shift by several electronvolts, following a roughly Born-like dependence on dielectric constant.

Among them, spin-selective transport at room temperature is clearly one of the most promising properties in the quest for functional spintronic devices. In this context, two main effects have been experimentally investigated in the past 25 years and have attracted significant interest within the community: the so-called Electronic Magnetochiral Anisotropy (eMChA) and Chirality Induced Spin Selectivity (CISS). Despite extensive research, there is still a lack of consensus in the modeling of their microscopic mechanisms. As a consequence, it remains unclear whether the two are truly distinct or if they originate from a common physical cause. With the long-term goal of modelling the main different theories and to test them against the available experimental evidence, we programmed the core of an efficient kinetic Monte Carlo code. The current code models electron transport under an external voltage, distinguishes between $α$ and $β$ spin currents, and parametrizes molecules by their intrinsic electron mobility and the effective coupling between electron movement, spin and chirality.

By decomposing a noninteracting bath Hamiltonian into a Cayley tree, the method provides a tensor network representation that naturally captures the multiscale entanglement structure intrinsic to impurity-bath systems. This geometry differs from conventional chain-based mappings and yields a substantial reduction of entanglement, allowing accurate ground-state properties and long-time dynamics to be captured at significantly lower bond dimensions. Benchmark calculations for the single-impurity Anderson model demonstrate that the TTN solver achieves markedly enhanced resolution of real-frequency spectral functions, without invoking analytic continuation. This impurity solver provides a balanced, scale-uniform description of impurity physics and offers a versatile approach for real-time dynamical mean-field theory and related applications involving quantum impurity models."}

Here, we address this challenge by focusing on the periodic steady state and solving the resulting problem using the frequency domain general synthetic iterative scheme (GSIS). The key idea of GSIS is to simultaneously solve the mesoscopic kinetic equation and the macroscopic synthetic equation. The kinetic equation provides high-order constitutive relations, beyond those given by the Newton law of viscosity and the Fourier law of heat conduction, to the synthetic equation. In turn, the synthetic equation, which converges to the periodic steady state much faster than the kinetic equation, boosts the evolution of the kinetic equation toward the periodic steady state. As a result, super convergence is achieved, together with an asymptotic preserving property that allows the use of coarse spatial grids. The analytical Fourier stability analysis and the Chapman-Enskog expansion, together with challenging numerical simulations, are employed to demonstrate the fast convergence and asymptotic-preserving properties of GSIS, revealing that it can be three orders of magnitude faster than conventional kinetic schemes in near continuum flow regimes."}

The anomalous Hall coefficient requires a non-zero pitch vector whereas the CME is proportional to the exchange coupling.

To resolve the nature of the transition in monolayer WS$_2$, we study its ultrafast optical response upon resonant photoexcitation of the A exciton across a broad range of photoexcitation densities. In agreement with previously reported measurements we observe that the A exciton quenches gradually with increasing excitation density. However, a detailed lineshape analysis unveils an abrupt red shift in the transient peak positions of the A and B exciton resonances above an excitation density threshold. This is attributed to band gap renormalization arising from the formation of free charge carrier plasma, i.e., the EMT. The plasma phase decays with a time constant of 0.65 ps back into the excitonic state. The abrupt appearance of the plasma phase at the threshold density suggests that the EMT is a discontinuous and not a continuous transition. This work demonstrates how transient optical spectroscopy combined with lineshape analysis of two excitonic resonances simultaneously can be used to investigate the EMT in 2D materials."}

For a nondegenerate reference, it is identical to the single-reference, projection coupled-cluster ansatz. For degenerate references, it is a natural coupled-cluster extension of degenerate RS perturbation ($Δ$MP) theory, and is closely related to, but distinct from Li and Paldus's state-universal multireference coupled-cluster (SUMRCC) theory. For ionized and electron-attached references, it can be viewed as a coupled-cluster Green's function, although the present theory is convergent toward the full-configuration-interaction (FCI) limits, while many-body Green's function (MBGF) theory generally is not. Its single-excitation instance is a projection (nonvariational) Hartree-Fock theory for a degenerate or nondegenerate reference as per the Thouless theorem, whose practical utility seems rather limited except for core ionizations, high-spin states, and possibly electron affinities. A determinant-based, general-order algorithm is implemented, generating $Δ$CC energies through connected octuple excitations, which are compared with the results from CI, equation-of-motion coupled-cluster (EOM-CC), and SUMRCC theories up to the FCI limits as well as from $Δ$MP and MBGF theories up to the 19th order. An algebraic, optimal-scaling, order-by-order algorithm is also computer-synthesized at the levels of single excitations only and of single and double excitations.

Common representations encode atomic composition and bonding but often do not include local coordination environments across chemically diverse crystals. Recurring structural motifs provide a motif level description of crystalline solids and can serve as interpretable descriptors for structure property learning. To analyze the motif connectivity in materials, we construct a bipartite material motif network from 131,548 Materials Project entries, with materials and motifs as the two node sets. Edges connect materials to their constituent motifs and are weighted by motif distortion, which quantifies the strength of each material motif association. Network connectivity is analyzed to identify motif-defined material clusters that capture recurring local geometries relevant to structure property trends. Most shared motifs act as hubs that connect otherwise disconnected regions of the network, enabling motif guided screening by expanding from known motifs to nearby materials in the same neighborhoods. A network embedding step converts this weighted connectivity into vector representations of materials. Using these motif informed embeddings, property prediction yields a formation energy mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.157 eV per atom and a bandgap MAE of 0.601 eV.

The energetic contribution consistently imparts convexity to the free energy, whereas entropy imparts concavity. A first-order transition occurs when concave entropy dominates; otherwise, the transition is continuous. Further decomposition shows that vibrational entropy drives the concave total entropic curvature, while the configurational entropy's curvature switches from convex (first-order) to concave (continuous), mirroring defect proliferation measured by Shannon entropy. The convexity of the energy is dominated by the inherent potential, with minimal vibrational influence.

To resolve the nature of the transition in monolayer WS$_2$, we study its ultrafast optical response upon resonant photoexcitation of the A exciton across a broad range of photoexcitation densities. In agreement with previously reported measurements we observe that the A exciton quenches gradually with increasing excitation density. However, a detailed lineshape analysis unveils an abrupt red shift in the transient peak positions of the A and B exciton resonances above an excitation density threshold. This is attributed to band gap renormalization arising from the formation of free charge carrier plasma, i.e., the EMT. The plasma phase decays with a time constant of 0.65 ps back into the excitonic state. The abrupt appearance of the plasma phase at the threshold density suggests that the EMT is a discontinuous and not a continuous transition. This work demonstrates how transient optical spectroscopy combined with lineshape analysis of two excitonic resonances simultaneously can be used to investigate the EMT in 2D materials."}

While intrinsic mechanisms such as the nonlinear Drude and Berry-curvature-dipole terms are well established, extrinsic contributions to thermoelectric responses arising from disorder-induced asymmetric scattering remain comparatively less explored, despite growing experimental evidence of their dominance. Here, we develop a unified semiclassical theory of NNE and NSE that incorporates skew scattering and side-jump processes, identifying four distinct extrinsic contributions to NNE and two for NSE. A systematic symmetry analysis shows that these responses are allowed in time-reversal-symmetric non-magnets, PT-symmetric antiferromagnets, and non-centrosymmetric magnetic systems such as altermagnets. As a case study, we demonstrate that ABA-stacked trilayer graphene hosts large nonlinear Nernst and Seebeck responses dominated by extrinsic scattering, in excellent agreement with recent experiments. Our results establish the microscopic origin of these effects and provide guiding principles for designing high-efficiency nonlinear thermoelectric devices."}

Primary examples include the recently realized fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) in twisted MoTe2 bilayers (tMoTe2) and multilayer graphene aligned with hBN, where TRS is broken in partially filled flat moire Chern bands. Among the FCIs in tMoTe2, the most robust is at a hole filling of v = -2/3 per moire unit cell. Interestingly, transient optical sensing and more recent transport measurements revealed a correlated state at v = -4/3, twice the filling factor for the v = -2/3 FCI. Here, employing pump-probe circular dichroism (CD) measurements on tMoTe2 with twist angles = 3.9 degree and 3.7 degree, we find that the v = -4/3 state exhibits vanishing magnetization (m = 0) in finite windows of out-of-plane magnetic field less than ~2-4 mT, and a first order phase transition to + - m states at higher fields. This out-of-plane antiferromagnetic (AFM) like behavior is notably absent for all other correlated states and disappears for the v = -4/3 state at higher or lower twist angles = 4.0 degree and 3.3 degree. The observed magnetic signature at v = -4/3 is consistent with a predicted fractional topological insulator (FTI) with TRS, consisting of two copies of -2/3 FCIs with opposite chiralities. We support these findings with calculations in the interacting continuum model of tMoTe2. Our work presents a candidate for fractional topological insulators with TRS."}

To gain a more profound understanding of the intriguing physics of this material and to uncover novel phenomena driven by quantum criticality, it is imperative to construct the phase diagram of CeSiI detailing the evolutions of T* and TN as a function of external tuning parameters such as pressure (P).In this study, we employ high pressure as an effective tuning knob to investigate this system, thereby generating a comprehensive T-P phase diagram of CeSiI. This diagram is characterized by an unusual V-shaped nonmonotonic evolution of T*(P) and the emergence of a superconducting dome with Tcmax = 240 mK upon suppression of AF order at Pc = 6 GPa, coinciding with the minimum of T*(P).The close proximity of the superconductivity (SC) to the AF instability and an unusually large upper critical field Bc2(0) exceeding 4-7 times the Pauli paramagnetic limit, suggests an unconventional pairing mechanism in CeSiI. Further analyses of normal-state transport properties provide evidence of quantum criticality, i.e., non-Fermi-liquid behavior and divergence of quasiparticle effective mass near Pc = 7 GPa. Our findings not only establish CeSiI as the first vdW heavy-fermion superconductor but also highlight an unconventional nature for the Kondo coherent state at T* at ambient pressure, hence opening a new avenue to study the interplay of strong electron correlation, Kondo hybridization, magnetism, and unconventional SC in the vdW heavy-fermion systems."}

Common representations encode atomic composition and bonding but often do not include local coordination environments across chemically diverse crystals. Recurring structural motifs provide a motif level description of crystalline solids and can serve as interpretable descriptors for structure property learning. To analyze the motif connectivity in materials, we construct a bipartite material motif network from 131,548 Materials Project entries, with materials and motifs as the two node sets. Edges connect materials to their constituent motifs and are weighted by motif distortion, which quantifies the strength of each material motif association. Network connectivity is analyzed to identify motif-defined material clusters that capture recurring local geometries relevant to structure property trends. Most shared motifs act as hubs that connect otherwise disconnected regions of the network, enabling motif guided screening by expanding from known motifs to nearby materials in the same neighborhoods. A network embedding step converts this weighted connectivity into vector representations of materials. Using these motif informed embeddings, property prediction yields a formation energy mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.157 eV per atom and a bandgap MAE of 0.601 eV. These results indicate that motif connectivity provides a compact, interpretable representation that complements existing descriptors for scalable screening and structure property modeling."}

In cuprate superconductors,the intertwinement of superconductivity and CDW order could strongly affect the fundamental properties of superconductivity, such as the critical temperature(Tc) and critical magnetic field(Hc). Recent high-field transport measurements indicate that when quantum fluctuations become important at low temperatures and high magnetic fields, the CDW order also reshapes the vortex states, which leads to fragile superconductivity with extremely low critical current(Jc). Here, by performing comprehensive high-field transport measurements, the H-T phase diagram of vortex states is mapped to H = 33 T in a quasi-two-dimensional FeSe-based superconductor (TBA+)xFeSe with a zero-resistivity transition temperature above 40 K. Our results indicate that (TBA+)xFeSe is an extremely type II superconductor with significant thermal fluctuations.At low temperatures, high magnetic fields cause the vortex solid state to exhibit similar current-dependent zero-resistance behavior as the fragile superconductivity in cuprate superconductors with CDW order. When the vortex solid state is melted with increasing temperature, a superconducting regime with vortex-like phase fluctuations emerges as an intermediate state, which features finite longitudinal resistance and vanishing Hall resistance. At higher temperatures, a vortex liquid state with finite Hall resistance eventually appears due to thermal fluctuations.

The boundary of the ferroelectric nanocluster embedded in the piezoelectric film is a compositionally graded layer. We analyzed the conditions, which allow switching the electric polarization of the piezoelectric AlN film at coercive field significantly lower than the electric breakdown field due to the proximity of ferroelectric Al1-xScxN clusters. Due to proximity effect, the spontaneous polarization switches in all elements of the nanopatterned film, and corresponding coercive fields can be reduced significantly in the presence of spike-like Al1-xScxN clusters. We also explored the underlaying physical mechanisms of the proximity effects in the piezoelectric films with ferroelectric nanoclusters. The internal field, which is depolarizing inside the piezoelectric film (due to the larger spontaneous polarization of AlN) and polarizing in the ferroelectric cluster (due to the smaller spontaneous polarization of Al1-xScxN), lowers the potential barrier in the clusters and facilitates the instant growth of nanodomains (emerging in the clusters) through the piezoelectric film. Since considered nanostructured materials can be created by implantation of Sc ions into AlN films, obtained theoretical results can be useful for creation of nanopatterned ferroelectrics by chemical engineering, with exciting prospects for previously unrealizable ferroelectric memory technologies."}

Bulk properties show large variations that cannot be resolved by simply reducing the fitting error in small cluster QM dataset. Such instability in bulk phase simulation is a universal problem in the training of machine learning potentials (MLPs), and is particularly severe at CCSD(T) level of theory.In this work, using our range-separated water model as an example, we aim to overcome these limitations by developing a new training workflow.

In this work, we transcend this limitation by combining the fuzzy sphere regularization with a sophisticated multi-target density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm. Focusing on the 3D Ising-type model on the spherical lowest Landau level, we calculate the 24 low-lying energies at a larger system size than previously feasible with ED. At criticality, we extract the scaling dimensions of six primary operators, and the results show significantly improved agreement with bootstrap benchmarks compared to previous ED results at smaller sizes.

The boundary of the ferroelectric nanocluster embedded in the piezoelectric film is a compositionally graded layer. We analyzed the conditions, which allow switching the electric polarization of the piezoelectric AlN film at coercive field significantly lower than the electric breakdown field due to the proximity of ferroelectric Al1-xScxN clusters. Due to proximity effect, the spontaneous polarization switches in all elements of the nanopatterned film, and corresponding coercive fields can be reduced significantly in the presence of spike-like Al1-xScxN clusters. We also explored the underlaying physical mechanisms of the proximity effects in the piezoelectric films with ferroelectric nanoclusters. The internal field, which is depolarizing inside the piezoelectric film (due to the larger spontaneous polarization of AlN) and polarizing in the ferroelectric cluster (due to the smaller spontaneous polarization of Al1-xScxN), lowers the potential barrier in the clusters and facilitates the instant growth of nanodomains (emerging in the clusters) through the piezoelectric film. Since considered nanostructured materials can be created by implantation of Sc ions into AlN films, obtained theoretical results can be useful for creation of nanopatterned ferroelectrics by chemical engineering, with exciting prospects for previously unrealizable ferroelectric memory technologies."}

Specifically, we address conflicting mechanistic proposals, cavity-induced electronic corrections under VSC and the relevance of a previously debated Si-C-stretching motion of PTA for vibrational polariton formation. We first provide computational evidence for a two-step mechanism based on density functional theory and high-level coupled cluster results, identify new encounter and products complexes and illustrate the relevance of diffuse basis functions for a qualitatively correct description of anionic reactive systems. We subsequently show that cavity-induced dipole fluctuation corrections of electronic energies can be significant on the level of cavity Born-Oppenheimer coupled cluster theory and discuss their qualitative impact on the proposed two-step mechanism taking into account cavity-induced molecular reorientation. We finally show that the Si-C-stretching contribution to the experimentally relevant double-peak feature of PTA exhibits a dominant dipole character, which renders it central for linear IR response and vibrational polariton formation despite the presence of CH$_3$-rocking contributions. The dipole character along the cleaving Si-C-bond is eventually shown to rationalize Rabi splittings throughout the proposed two-step mechanism.

Inspired by these experiments we develop a mechanism which can explain such a giant resonant enhancement of light-induced superconductivity. Within a minimal non-linear Holstein model, we show that resonantly driving optical Raman modes leads to a time-dependent electron-phonon coupling. Such a coupling then modulates the effective electron-electron attraction, with the strongest modulations occurring when the drive is resonant with the phonon frequency. These dynamical modulations of the pairing interactions lead to Floquet-BCS instabilities at temperatures far exceeding equilibrium $T_c$, as observed in experiments.

This effect arises within hydrodynamic transport with finite momentum relaxation and does not rely on ballistic dynamics. Our results provide a natural hydrodynamic interpretation of edge-enhanced and double-bump current profiles observed in constricted geometries.

Using tunneling spectroscopy, we visualize how Andreev bound states (ABS) evolve across a two-dimensional superconducting phase space, controlled by the two independent phase differences in the 3TJJ. These measurements reveal sharp local minima in the differential conductance spectra locked in a specific phase condition of superconducting phase variables. The resulting quantized trajectories around the compact torus of the superconducting phase variables reveal an underlying topological winding in the multipair transport.

For a nondegenerate reference, it is identical to the single-reference, projection coupled-cluster ansatz. For degenerate references, it is a natural coupled-cluster extension of degenerate RS perturbation ($Δ$MP) theory, and is closely related to, but distinct from Li and Paldus's state-universal multireference coupled-cluster (SUMRCC) theory. For ionized and electron-attached references, it can be viewed as a coupled-cluster Green's function, although the present theory is convergent toward the full-configuration-interaction (FCI) limits, while many-body Green's function (MBGF) theory generally is not. Its single-excitation instance is a projection (nonvariational) Hartree-Fock theory for a degenerate or nondegenerate reference as per the Thouless theorem, whose practical utility seems rather limited except for core ionizations, high-spin states, and possibly electron affinities. A determinant-based, general-order algorithm is implemented, generating $Δ$CC energies through connected octuple excitations, which are compared with the results from CI, equation-of-motion coupled-cluster (EOM-CC), and SUMRCC theories up to the FCI limits as well as from $Δ$MP and MBGF theories up to the 19th order.

Symmetry has proven to be a powerful tool for predicting topological phonons. However, to date, topological phonon emergent particles (EMPs) have not been systematically cataloged in material databases. Moreover, traditional symmetry methods are often inadequate for predicting chiral phonons, because realistic calculations can yield negative results even when symmetry analysis permits phonon chirality. Here, we first establish a complete symmetry-based classification: given any space group and Wyckoff positions (WYPOs) occupied by atoms, the number of occurrences of all (co-)irreducible representations ((co-)irreps) (that can host EMPs) can be unambiguously known without omission prior to expensive and parameter-dependent calculation. Moreover, whether a phonon mode (belonging to one (co-)irrep) is chiral can also be determined from the occupied WYPOs. We then perform a materials database investigation identifying over 25 million EMPs at high-symmetry points and along high-symmetry lines and computing the concrete value of phonon angular momentum for each mode. We demonstrate two main applications: identifying ideal materials with surface chirality momentum locking and identifying materials with giant phonon magnetic moment.

This electric-field-induced NANE arises from both Berry connection polarization, rooted in the electric-field-corrected Berry curvature, and the anomalous-velocity-modified nonequilibrium Fermi distribution function. Additionally, we propose an alternating temperature gradient as a driving force instead of the conventional steady one, ensuring experimental detection of NANE via second-harmonic measurement techniques. The behaviour of electric-field-induced NANE in the monolayer graphene has been theoretically and systematically investigated."}

Here, using a new probabilistic data-driven framework applied to molecular simulation data on water, we identify local collective variables that discriminate low-density and high-density amorphous (LDA and HDA) ices and characterize pressure-induced transitions between these phases. As expected, descriptors related to local density capably distinguish LDA and HDA; however, phase identity is surprisingly encoded within the first coordination shell. Furthermore, LDA transitions to HDA by a simple redistribution of LDA- and HDA-like environments with no evident intermediate structures, in accordance with a first-order-like transition that contrasts with the gradual evolution observed in other amorphous systems such as metallic glasses. These findings are robust across force fields, which themselves exhibit structural differences, and exemplify how other systems lacking obvious distinguishing features can be characterized."}

This effect arises within hydrodynamic transport with finite momentum relaxation and does not rely on ballistic dynamics. Our results provide a natural hydrodynamic interpretation of edge-enhanced and double-bump current profiles observed in constricted geometries.

Symmetry has proven to be a powerful tool for predicting topological phonons. However, to date, topological phonon emergent particles (EMPs) have not been systematically cataloged in material databases. Moreover, traditional symmetry methods are often inadequate for predicting chiral phonons, because realistic calculations can yield negative results even when symmetry analysis permits phonon chirality. Here, we first establish a complete symmetry-based classification: given any space group and Wyckoff positions (WYPOs) occupied by atoms, the number of occurrences of all (co-)irreducible representations ((co-)irreps) (that can host EMPs) can be unambiguously known without omission prior to expensive and parameter-dependent calculation. Moreover, whether a phonon mode (belonging to one (co-)irrep) is chiral can also be determined from the occupied WYPOs. We then perform a materials database investigation identifying over 25 million EMPs at high-symmetry points and along high-symmetry lines and computing the concrete value of phonon angular momentum for each mode. We demonstrate two main applications: identifying ideal materials with surface chirality momentum locking and identifying materials with giant phonon magnetic moment.

The simulation shows a high local electric field at the edges of a patterned bottom electrode (BE), which can increase the probability of metal filament formation due to high current density, suggesting that the use of a PBE can assist the RS mechanism. RS involves switching from the high resistive state (HRS) to the low resistive state (LRS) known as the \"SET\" process at higher positive bias, and returning to HRS from LRS is known as the \"RESET\" process, which can be achieved at a negative bias. Various switching mechanisms are segregated from each other by the obtained current response to applied voltage. RS due to the formation of complete metal filaments between the top and bottom electrodes showed Ohm's law behaviour. On the other hand, a slope of approximately 2 in the log-log plot signifies that the space charge limited current (SCLC) dominates the device, and hence RS comes from incomplete metal filament formation or some changes in the P3HT polymer itself. Similarly, high current density can transform the molecular arrangement from crystalline to an amorphous state due to joule heating, which leads to an intermediate OFF state. The high current density joule heating RS are from HRS to LRS, which is opposite to the metal filament based RS, hence it is called an inverted RS. The optical images of the fresh device and after multiple cycles indicate the metal percolation inside the OSC responsible for the RS. EDX spectrum at LRS in a cross-sectional transmission electron microscope (TEM) confirms the top metal percolation through the OSC and touches the BE. Therefore, the metal filament formation is the fundamental reason for these observed switching behaviours in P3HT."}

Such periodic behavior is also observed while calculating the thermal conductance $κ$ through the junction. Novelty of this problem is that the behavior of these G or $κ$ with insulator width are, in many respect, different compared to that from a normal metal - insulator - superconductor (NIS) junction on graphene or silicene.

Tremendous efforts have been put into identifying the impact of different morphologies of these materials on the glucose-sensing performance.

This formulation provides a theoretical foundation for the acoustic mismatch model, widely used to analyze Kapitza resistance. We then refine the boundary conditions to include spatial dependence parallel to the interface. The refined form captures transverse shifts of elastic wave packets, analogous to the optical Imbert--Fedorov shift, and ensures conservation of total angular momentum. Consequently, circularly polarized phonons carrying spin angular momentum (SAM) generate phonon orbital angular momentum (OAM) at the interface. We analytically determine the spatial profile of this OAM and demonstrate that SAM and OAM are both involved in the interfacial diffusion of chiral phonons. Our theory provides concise boundary conditions for phonons, with applications ranging from heat transport to phonon angular momentum transport."}

We define an inferential efficiency as the ratio of information gain to cumulative memory erasure cost, with inefficiency arising from unexploited correlations between the measured system and memories, and/or between memories and environment (noise). Using this efficiency, we benchmark two limiting measurement paradigms: sequential, in which the same memory is exploited iteratively, and parallel, in which many memories are exploited simultaneously. In both cases, the minimal erasure cost reflects correlations across memories: temporal in sequential, spatial in parallel. Remarkably, when all system-memory correlations are exploited for inference, both paradigms attain the same minimal erasure cost, even in the presence of noise. Conversely, the parallel paradigm performs better in the presence of unexploited correlations, stemming from hidden memories' degrees of freedom. This approach provides a quantitative, physically grounded criterion to compare inference strategies, determine their efficiency, and link target information gains to their minimal entropic cost."}

To gain a more profound understanding of the intriguing physics of this material and to uncover novel phenomena driven by quantum criticality, it is imperative to construct the phase diagram of CeSiI detailing the evolutions of T* and TN as a function of external tuning parameters such as pressure (P).In this study, we employ high pressure as an effective tuning knob to investigate this system, thereby generating a comprehensive T-P phase diagram of CeSiI. This diagram is characterized by an unusual V-shaped nonmonotonic evolution of T*(P) and the emergence of a superconducting dome with Tcmax = 240 mK upon suppression of AF order at Pc = 6 GPa, coinciding with the minimum of T*(P).The close proximity of the superconductivity (SC) to the AF instability and an unusually large upper critical field Bc2(0) exceeding 4-7 times the Pauli paramagnetic limit, suggests an unconventional pairing mechanism in CeSiI. Further analyses of normal-state transport properties provide evidence of quantum criticality, i.e., non-Fermi-liquid behavior and divergence of quasiparticle effective mass near Pc = 7 GPa. Our findings not only establish CeSiI as the first vdW heavy-fermion superconductor but also highlight an unconventional nature for the Kondo coherent state at T* at ambient pressure, hence opening a new avenue to study the interplay of strong electron correlation, Kondo hybridization, magnetism, and unconventional SC in the vdW heavy-fermion systems."}

Gamma-ray exposure is particularly critical because their strong penetrating power allows them to traverse conventional shielding and device packaging. Real-time monitoring of exposure-induced changes in compact, chip-integrated devices remains limited despite the availability of external radiation detectors. Atomically precise graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) present an attractive platform for probing such effects due to their structural uniformity, tunable electronic properties, and exceptional sensitivity of charge transport to even subtle lattice modifications. Here, we investigate the structural and electronic response of atomically precise GNRs under gamma irradiation. Nine-atom-wide armchair GNRs (9-AGNRs) were synthesized via a bottom-up on-surface approach, integrated into field-effect transistors (FETs), and characterized before and after exposure using Raman spectroscopy and electrical transport measurements. Raman spectroscopy indicates preservation of the primary GNR lattice structure, accompanied by subtle spectral changes suggestive of irradiation-induced oxidation or local lattice perturbations. While these measurements do not indicate severe structural damage, electrical transport measurements reveal a pronounced degradation in device performance, demonstrating the strong susceptibility of GNRFETs to gamma-ray exposure. This pronounced response may be attributed to Anderson localization of charge carriers, potentially arising from enhanced quantum interference in atomically narrow, quasi-one-dimensional GNRs. These results highlight the potential of GNR-based nanoelectronic devices for sensing and monitoring under extreme operational conditions."}

Tremendous efforts have been put into identifying the impact of different morphologies of these materials on the glucose-sensing performance. The larger surface area of the flower and wire-shaped catalysts make them better performing amongst other morphologies.

In cuprate superconductors,the intertwinement of superconductivity and CDW order could strongly affect the fundamental properties of superconductivity, such as the critical temperature(Tc) and critical magnetic field(Hc). Recent high-field transport measurements indicate that when quantum fluctuations become important at low temperatures and high magnetic fields, the CDW order also reshapes the vortex states, which leads to fragile superconductivity with extremely low critical current(Jc). Here, by performing comprehensive high-field transport measurements, the H-T phase diagram of vortex states is mapped to H = 33 T in a quasi-two-dimensional FeSe-based superconductor (TBA+)xFeSe with a zero-resistivity transition temperature above 40 K. Our results indicate that (TBA+)xFeSe is an extremely type II superconductor with significant thermal fluctuations.At low temperatures, high magnetic fields cause the vortex solid state to exhibit similar current-dependent zero-resistance behavior as the fragile superconductivity in cuprate superconductors with CDW order. When the vortex solid state is melted with increasing temperature, a superconducting regime with vortex-like phase fluctuations emerges as an intermediate state, which features finite longitudinal resistance and vanishing Hall resistance. At higher temperatures, a vortex liquid state with finite Hall resistance eventually appears due to thermal fluctuations. All these observations suggest exotic vortex states beyond the classical paradigm of vortex matter."}

The former corresponds to a same-topology configuration, whereas the latter realizes a reverse-topology configuration. Using a bulk boundary perturbation approach, we show that in BNNR/AGNRH/BNNR the IFs are destroyed by chirality breaking induced by symmetric BN environments at both interfaces. In contrast, the IFs in the reverse-topology structure remain robust against lateral interface interactions from BN atoms. Transport calculations further demonstrate that the surviving IFs in BNNR/AGNRH/NBNR exhibit the characteristic behavior of topological double quantum dots, with an enhanced interdot hopping strength compared with vacuum boundary conditions.

Symmetry has proven to be a powerful tool for predicting topological phonons. However, to date, topological phonon emergent particles (EMPs) have not been systematically cataloged in material databases. Moreover, traditional symmetry methods are often inadequate for predicting chiral phonons, because realistic calculations can yield negative results even when symmetry analysis permits phonon chirality. Here, we first establish a complete symmetry-based classification: given any space group and Wyckoff positions (WYPOs) occupied by atoms, the number of occurrences of all (co-)irreducible representations ((co-)irreps) (that can host EMPs) can be unambiguously known without omission prior to expensive and parameter-dependent calculation. Moreover, whether a phonon mode (belonging to one (co-)irrep) is chiral can also be determined from the occupied WYPOs. We then perform a materials database investigation identifying over 25 million EMPs at high-symmetry points and along high-symmetry lines and computing the concrete value of phonon angular momentum for each mode. We demonstrate two main applications: identifying ideal materials with surface chirality momentum locking and identifying materials with giant phonon magnetic moment. All computational data are compiled into a website: http://phonon.nju.edu.cn, which is expected to stimulate future studies on topological and chiral phonons."}

Starting from a $U(1)$ symmetry-broken initial state, we simulate quantum trajectories generated by continuous measurements of both global and local observables. We show that under global monitoring, states containing superpositions of distant charge sectors restore symmetry faster than those involving nearby sectors. We establish the universality of this behavior across different measurement protocols.

Inspired by these experiments we develop a mechanism which can explain such a giant resonant enhancement of light-induced superconductivity. Within a minimal non-linear Holstein model, we show that resonantly driving optical Raman modes leads to a time-dependent electron-phonon coupling. Such a coupling then modulates the effective electron-electron attraction, with the strongest modulations occurring when the drive is resonant with the phonon frequency. These dynamical modulations of the pairing interactions lead to Floquet-BCS instabilities at temperatures far exceeding equilibrium $T_c$, as observed in experiments. We conclude by discussing the implications of our general analysis on the $\\mathrm{K}_3\\mathrm{C}_{60}$ experiments specifically and suggesting experimental signatures of our mechanism."}

The simulation shows a high local electric field at the edges of a patterned bottom electrode (BE), which can increase the probability of metal filament formation due to high current density, suggesting that the use of a PBE can assist the RS mechanism. RS involves switching from the high resistive state (HRS) to the low resistive state (LRS) known as the \"SET\" process at higher positive bias, and returning to HRS from LRS is known as the \"RESET\" process, which can be achieved at a negative bias. Various switching mechanisms are segregated from each other by the obtained current response to applied voltage. RS due to the formation of complete metal filaments between the top and bottom electrodes showed Ohm's law behaviour. On the other hand, a slope of approximately 2 in the log-log plot signifies that the space charge limited current (SCLC) dominates the device, and hence RS comes from incomplete metal filament formation or some changes in the P3HT polymer itself. Similarly, high current density can transform the molecular arrangement from crystalline to an amorphous state due to joule heating, which leads to an intermediate OFF state. The high current density joule heating RS are from HRS to LRS, which is opposite to the metal filament based RS, hence it is called an inverted RS. The optical images of the fresh device and after multiple cycles indicate the metal percolation inside the OSC responsible for the RS. EDX spectrum at LRS in a cross-sectional transmission electron microscope (TEM) confirms the top metal percolation through the OSC and touches the BE. Therefore, the metal filament formation is the fundamental reason for these observed switching behaviours in P3HT."}

The crystal structure was characterized using single crystal X-ray diffraction, which reveals that Na2Co3(AsO4)2(OH)2 crystallizes in the monoclinic crystal system C2/m. The structure features a one-dimensional kagome strip lattice built from Co2+ ions and undergoes an antiferromagnetic transition at TN = 14 K.

TMOs such as Iron oxides( α-Fe2O3, γ-Fe2O3, Fe3O4, etc.), NiO, CuO, Cr2O3, etc. have been utilized as electrocatalysts for glucose determination. Tremendous efforts have been put into identifying the impact of different morphologies of these materials on the glucose-sensing performance. The larger surface area of the flower and wire-shaped catalysts make them better performing amongst other morphologies. Interestingly, it is important to note that most of such studies are on standard Glassy Carbon electrodes. Further to enhance the Electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of the electrode, Carbon nanomaterials such as reduced Graphene Oxide (r-GO) and Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) are used as additives. Exfoliated Graphite paper electrodes offer better electrochemical characteristics than GCE electrodes due to their much larger ECSA. This study presents the non-enzymatic glucose sensing properties of NiO nanoflower-decorated Exfoliated Graphite electrodes. The amperometric detection of glucose shows a linear increase in current over a physiologically relevant wide range of 0-10 mM. The electrodes offer a better sensitivity of 304.12 microA per mM per cm square and a Limit Of Detection (LOD) of 100 microM. In addition, the electrodes showed high selectivity towards glucose in the presence of other interfering species such as Ascorbic acid, Fructose, Sucrose, and NaCl."}

Notably, by changing the aspect ratio of solids, the energy landscape around equilibrium can be modified to induce non-linearities under lateral stresses through non-lateral deformations. These nonlinear systems can develop multiple local energy minima where the system can settle and switch between states through the application of a driving force. Crucially, recent advances in oxide thin film growth have enabled the fabrication of freestanding oxide membranes, paving a viable path for their use in bistable architecture, particularly at the nanoscale. Here, we demonstrate that freestanding oxide membranes, such as SrTiO3 (STO) and BaTiO3 (BTO), relax into well-defined metastable buckling states when transferred onto lithographically defined cavities. The membrane deformation is determined by the interplay between built-in residual strain, bending stiffness, and cavity geometry, resulting in reproducible bistable states with distinct strain distributions. Using a combination of atomic force microscopy, in-contact Kelvin probe measurements, and finite-element modelling, we reveal that these mechanically locked states directly shape the electromechanical potential landscape of ferroelectric BaTiO3. We further demonstrate reversible snapthrough transitions between mechanically degenerate states, establishing complex oxides as deterministic, geometry-tunable building blocks for nonlinear nanoelectromechanical architectures. Our results illustrate a general strategy for exploiting mechanical instabilities to encode and manipulate functional responses in ultrathin crystalline membranes."}

Furthermore, space group symmetry and Wyckoff site notations are applied to characterize crystal structures with only a few variables. While this representation is effective for data records and human learning, it lacks one-to-one correspondence between the crystal structure and its representation. This is problematic for many applications, such as crystal structure determination, comparison, and more recently, generative model learning. To address this issue, we propose to represent crystals in a four-dimensional (4D) reciprocal space featured by their Cartesian coordinates and scattering factors, which can naturally handle translation invariance and space group symmetry with the help of structure factors. In order to achieve rotational invariance, the 4D coordinates are then transformed into a power spectrum representation under the orthogonal spherical harmonic and radial basis. Hence, this representation captures both periodicity and symmetry of the crystal structure while also providing a continuous representation of the atomic positions and cell parameters in the direct space. Its effectiveness is demonstrated by applying it to several crystal structure matching and reconstruction tasks."}

The spin-flipping and spin-conserving parts of the spin-orbit coupling contribute differently to such a dipolar structure. All these features are exemplified in a lattice electron-phonon model with ferromagnetic order and $C_{1h}$ point group symmetry.

Here, the effect of an important structural descriptor, amorphous complexion thickness, on the plasticity and failure modes of nanocrystalline Cu-Zr is studied with in-situ compression testing, with over 50 micropillars tested. Two model materials were created that differ only in their complexion thickness, with one having a thicker complexion population than the other. The sample with thinner complexions was more likely to experience non-uniform plastic deformation in the form of localized plastic flow or shear banding. In contrast, the sample with thicker complexions displayed more homogeneous plasticity and higher damage tolerance; thicker amorphous complexions suppress localization by absorbing defects.

First-principles calculations using density functional theory characterize it as a Dirac semimetal, with a notable band-crossing in proximity to the Fermi level (EF ) along the Γ-A direction. The crystal exhibits three distinct magnetic phases at 4 K (TN1), 3.5 K (TN2), and 2.8 K (TN3)as observed from magnetic and specific heat measurements. However, zero-field neutron diffraction resolves only two magnetic phases: a commensurate antiferromagnetic phase and a canted antiferromagnetic phase. Field-dependent ac and dc magnetization measurements uncover field-induced non-trivial spin textures in the magnetic field range 1.5 to 3 T, manifested as a tilted plateau in the magnetization curves. The interplay between conduction carriers and these spin textures is further evidenced by unique features in the magnetic field-dependent longitudinal resistivity in the system. Finally, we present a comprehensive magnetic phase diagram of EuAuBi, highlighting diverse spin alignments present in the material. EuAuBi thus emerges as a rare material system in which both momentum-space and real-space Berry curvature effects may coexist, providing a unique opportunity to investigate their interplay."}

This growth mode is explained by a geometrical model that captures the basic mechanisms of multilayer island growth, island coalescence, and formation of a continuous film. Additionally, kinetic Monte Carlo simulations with minimal ingredients demonstrate that this mode generally occurs for weakly interacting substrates, providing quantitative estimates of parameters that characterize adsorbate-adsorbate and adsorbate-substrate interactions. Both the model and simulations accurately describe the experimental data and highlight the generic nature of the phenomenon, independently of the details of the interactions and the molecular flux, which opens up a path for controlling nanoscale film roughness."}

Here, using a new probabilistic data-driven framework applied to molecular simulation data on water, we identify local collective variables that discriminate low-density and high-density amorphous (LDA and HDA) ices and characterize pressure-induced transitions between these phases. As expected, descriptors related to local density capably distinguish LDA and HDA; however, phase identity is surprisingly encoded within the first coordination shell. Furthermore, LDA transitions to HDA by a simple redistribution of LDA- and HDA-like environments with no evident intermediate structures, in accordance with a first-order-like transition that contrasts with the gradual evolution observed in other amorphous systems such as metallic glasses. These findings are robust across force fields, which themselves exhibit structural differences, and exemplify how other systems lacking obvious distinguishing features can be characterized."}

Upon cooling to 3 K and reheating, the Er3+ PL intensity and excited-state lifetime display pronounced thermal hysteresis with a minimum near 132 K, at the reported antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition of CrSBr. Remarkably, we observe magnetic signatures persisting over a broader temperature range than expected from bulk benchmarks, suggesting nanoscale magnetic order that locally survives beyond the nominal phase boundary.

Among them, spin-selective transport at room temperature is clearly one of the most promising properties in the quest for functional spintronic devices. In this context, two main effects have been experimentally investigated in the past 25 years and have attracted significant interest within the community: the so-called Electronic Magnetochiral Anisotropy (eMChA) and Chirality Induced Spin Selectivity (CISS). Despite extensive research, there is still a lack of consensus in the modeling of their microscopic mechanisms. As a consequence, it remains unclear whether the two are truly distinct or if they originate from a common physical cause. With the long-term goal of modelling the main different theories and to test them against the available experimental evidence, we programmed the core of an efficient kinetic Monte Carlo code. The current code models electron transport under an external voltage, distinguishes between $α$ and $β$ spin currents, and parametrizes molecules by their intrinsic electron mobility and the effective coupling between electron movement, spin and chirality. The code allows obtaining spin filtering values arising from the effective coupling between these three. We obtain an effect that vanishes at low voltages, with the asymmetry between positive and negative voltages typically found in electrical magnetochiral anisotropy experiments."}

Gamma-ray exposure is particularly critical because their strong penetrating power allows them to traverse conventional shielding and device packaging. Real-time monitoring of exposure-induced changes in compact, chip-integrated devices remains limited despite the availability of external radiation detectors. Atomically precise graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) present an attractive platform for probing such effects due to their structural uniformity, tunable electronic properties, and exceptional sensitivity of charge transport to even subtle lattice modifications. Here, we investigate the structural and electronic response of atomically precise GNRs under gamma irradiation. Nine-atom-wide armchair GNRs (9-AGNRs) were synthesized via a bottom-up on-surface approach, integrated into field-effect transistors (FETs), and characterized before and after exposure using Raman spectroscopy and electrical transport measurements. Raman spectroscopy indicates preservation of the primary GNR lattice structure, accompanied by subtle spectral changes suggestive of irradiation-induced oxidation or local lattice perturbations. While these measurements do not indicate severe structural damage, electrical transport measurements reveal a pronounced degradation in device performance, demonstrating the strong susceptibility of GNRFETs to gamma-ray exposure. This pronounced response may be attributed to Anderson localization of charge carriers, potentially arising from enhanced quantum interference in atomically narrow, quasi-one-dimensional GNRs. These results highlight the potential of GNR-based nanoelectronic devices for sensing and monitoring under extreme operational conditions."}

We resolve two distinct electronic flat-band states located in close proximity to the Fermi level: a robust Topological Surface Flat Band at ~40 meV below the Fermi level on the Sulfur-terminated surface, originating from weak topological insulator states, and a kagome lattice-derived flat band at ~100 meV binding energy with an ultranarrow bandwidth (~5 meV). Instead of the single Dirac cone, the Indium-terminated surface hosts a rare two-dimensional Dirac-node arc state, where the gapless Dirac nodes extend along an open one-dimensional line crossing the Brillouin-zone boundary, exhibiting sharp linear dispersion, exceptionally high Fermi velocity, and pronounced circular dichroism. These findings establish Ni3In2S2 as a unique topological kagome metal in which multiple flat-band states of different physical origin coexist with an unusual Dirac-node arc, opening an avenue for discovering flat-band--driven and topology-enabled quantum phenomena."}

One contentious issue regarding this material is its bulk structure in the low-temperature phase. Recently, it has become generally accepted from experiments that the low- and high-temperature structures belong to the $R\\bar{3}$ and $C2/m$ space groups, respectively. However, there was no theoretical study supporting the $R\\bar{3}$-type structure as the low-temperature structure. In this study, we use constrained density functional theory to show that the $R\\bar{3}$ structure is lower in energy than the $C2/m$ structure, in agreement with experimental observations. Then, we show that the conduction band minimum states are almost of the $J_\\textrm{eff}=1/2$ and $m_\\textrm{eff}=-1/2$ character, if we set the angular momentum quantization axis to be parallel to the Néel vector; this is the first analysis of the $J_\\textrm{eff}$ picture for $α$-RuCl$_3$ from this perspective. In addition, we compute the anisotropic magnetic exchange parameters and $g$ factors of monolayer $α$-RuCl$_3$, thereby providing a comprehensive understanding of its magnetism. Our results demonstrate that both second-nearest-neighbor exchange interactions and magnetic moments not captured by the conventional atomic orbital projection method are necessary for accurate description of the magnetism in $α$-RuCl$_3$. Moreover, the calculated $g$ factors are in fairly good agreement with experimental measurements, especially the small anisotropy between their in-plane and out-of-plane components. Finally, we examine the effects of structural distortions from a perfect RuCl$_6$ octahedron, already present in bulk $α$-RuCl$_3$ without any external perturbation, on the magnetic properties.

In this paper, we report the hydrothermal synthesis and detailed structural and property characterization of Na2Co3(AsO4)2(OH)2, a striped kagome system. The crystal structure was characterized using single crystal X-ray diffraction, which reveals that Na2Co3(AsO4)2(OH)2 crystallizes in the monoclinic crystal system C2/m. The structure features a one-dimensional kagome strip lattice built from Co2+ ions and undergoes an antiferromagnetic transition at TN = 14 K. The magnetic ground state at zero field was characterized using neutron powder diffraction. Below the magnetic transition, Na2Co3(AsO4)2(OH)2 orders into an antiferromagnetic structure with a k-vector (0.5, 0.5, 0.5). In the proposed model, the Co1 moment is predominantly confined to the ac-plane while the Co2 moment is primarily aligned along the b-axis. Two flat bands were observed in the inelastic neutron spectra below the magnetic transition at 5 and 10 meV. Inelastic neutron spectra were modeled with a Heisenberg Hamiltonian including three nearest-neighbor exchange interactions (J1, J2, J3) and strong single-ion anisotropy to stabilize the observed magnetic structure. Our study highlights the complexity of the Co2+-based kagome strip magnetic lattice compound Na2Co3(AsO4)2(OH)2, which provides an excellent platform to broaden our understanding of the frustrated kagome magnetic lattice space."}

In this study, we investigate skyrmion-skyrmion interactions in chiral magnetic films and reveal that they possess intrinsic, anisotropic, and oscillatory characteristics. Specifically, we demonstrate that the attractive and repulsive forces between skyrmions oscillate with a well-defined period, akin to the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) coupling observed between two magnetic moments in metals. Our analysis uncovers the essential physics behind a previously unrecognized universal wavy tail in the skyrmion spin texture. Notably, the resulting RKKY-like interaction between skyrmions is universal for all tilted skyrmions, irrespective of whether the titled easy-axis is from an external field or a crystalline magnetic anisotropy.

Here, we develop a unified semiclassical theory of NNE and NSE that incorporates skew scattering and side-jump processes, identifying four distinct extrinsic contributions to NNE and two for NSE. A systematic symmetry analysis shows that these responses are allowed in time-reversal-symmetric non-magnets, PT-symmetric antiferromagnets, and non-centrosymmetric magnetic systems such as altermagnets. As a case study, we demonstrate that ABA-stacked trilayer graphene hosts large nonlinear Nernst and Seebeck responses dominated by extrinsic scattering, in excellent agreement with recent experiments.

The use of TR-APXPS allows for real-time monitoring of chemical changes at the surface of Iron oxides during reduction, providing valuable insights into the reaction mechanisms and kinetics involved. One key challenge in analyzing TR-APXPS data is the presence of overlapping peaks and complex spectral features, which can make accurate quantification and interpretation difficult. Traditional spectral fitting methods may struggle with these complexities and result in ambiguous or inaccurate results. However, the chemometric approaches are promising tools to overcome these challenges by extracting pure spectral profiles of individual chemical species and their temporal profiles from the complex and overlapping data. The results obtained from the TR-APXPS coupled with PCA and MCR-ALS analysis provide a detailed and precise understanding of the surface chemical changes during the Fe2O3 reduction. This includes identifying and following the formation of various intermediate species and their evolution over time, which permits later to establish correlations between surface chemistry and process conditions. The integration of both chemometric tools in TR-APXPS data analysis not only addresses the challenges associated with complex spectral features, but also contributes to a deeper understanding of the underlying chemical changes and their dynamics. The obtained results have significant implications for process optimization, material synthesis, and tailoring of material properties for specific applications."}

Here, using a new probabilistic data-driven framework applied to molecular simulation data on water, we identify local collective variables that discriminate low-density and high-density amorphous (LDA and HDA) ices and characterize pressure-induced transitions between these phases. As expected, descriptors related to local density capably distinguish LDA and HDA; however, phase identity is surprisingly encoded within the first coordination shell. Furthermore, LDA transitions to HDA by a simple redistribution of LDA- and HDA-like environments with no evident intermediate structures, in accordance with a first-order-like transition that contrasts with the gradual evolution observed in other amorphous systems such as metallic glasses. These findings are robust across force fields, which themselves exhibit structural differences, and exemplify how other systems lacking obvious distinguishing features can be characterized."}

Across six solid-solid battery interface systems, FIRE consistently achieves root-mean-square errors in energy below 1 meV/atom and in force near 20 meV/angstrom, marking an order-of-magnitude improvement over existing models while requiring only 10% of the original datasets. In addition, the fine-tuned model successfully reproduces key mechanical and electrochemical properties of the materials, in close agreement with experimental data. The FIRE offers a generalizable and data-efficient approach for developing accurate interatomic potentials across diverse materials, enabling predictive simulations beyond the reach of first-principles methods."}

Notably, by changing the aspect ratio of solids, the energy landscape around equilibrium can be modified to induce non-linearities under lateral stresses through non-lateral deformations. These nonlinear systems can develop multiple local energy minima where the system can settle and switch between states through the application of a driving force. Crucially, recent advances in oxide thin film growth have enabled the fabrication of freestanding oxide membranes, paving a viable path for their use in bistable architecture, particularly at the nanoscale. Here, we demonstrate that freestanding oxide membranes, such as SrTiO3 (STO) and BaTiO3 (BTO), relax into well-defined metastable buckling states when transferred onto lithographically defined cavities. The membrane deformation is determined by the interplay between built-in residual strain, bending stiffness, and cavity geometry, resulting in reproducible bistable states with distinct strain distributions. Using a combination of atomic force microscopy, in-contact Kelvin probe measurements, and finite-element modelling, we reveal that these mechanically locked states directly shape the electromechanical potential landscape of ferroelectric BaTiO3. We further demonstrate reversible snapthrough transitions between mechanically degenerate states, establishing complex oxides as deterministic, geometry-tunable building blocks for nonlinear nanoelectromechanical architectures. Our results illustrate a general strategy for exploiting mechanical instabilities to encode and manipulate functional responses in ultrathin crystalline membranes."}

Furthermore, space group symmetry and Wyckoff site notations are applied to characterize crystal structures with only a few variables. While this representation is effective for data records and human learning, it lacks one-to-one correspondence between the crystal structure and its representation. This is problematic for many applications, such as crystal structure determination, comparison, and more recently, generative model learning. To address this issue, we propose to represent crystals in a four-dimensional (4D) reciprocal space featured by their Cartesian coordinates and scattering factors, which can naturally handle translation invariance and space group symmetry with the help of structure factors. In order to achieve rotational invariance, the 4D coordinates are then transformed into a power spectrum representation under the orthogonal spherical harmonic and radial basis. Hence, this representation captures both periodicity and symmetry of the crystal structure while also providing a continuous representation of the atomic positions and cell parameters in the direct space. Its effectiveness is demonstrated by applying it to several crystal structure matching and reconstruction tasks."}

Using tunneling spectroscopy, we visualize how Andreev bound states (ABS) evolve across a two-dimensional superconducting phase space, controlled by the two independent phase differences in the 3TJJ. These measurements reveal sharp local minima in the differential conductance spectra locked in a specific phase condition of superconducting phase variables. The resulting quantized trajectories around the compact torus of the superconducting phase variables reveal an underlying topological winding in the multipair transport.

Two model materials were created that differ only in their complexion thickness, with one having a thicker complexion population than the other. The sample with thinner complexions was more likely to experience non-uniform plastic deformation in the form of localized plastic flow or shear banding. In contrast, the sample with thicker complexions displayed more homogeneous plasticity and higher damage tolerance; thicker amorphous complexions suppress localization by absorbing defects.

The fundamental thermodynamic origins of this sensitivity remains elusive. Here, by decomposing the Helmholtz free energy across three representative repulsive systems, we reveal a universal competition between energy and entropy that dictates the melting pathway. The energetic contribution consistently imparts convexity to the free energy, whereas entropy imparts concavity. A first-order transition occurs when concave entropy dominates; otherwise, the transition is continuous. Further decomposition shows that vibrational entropy drives the concave total entropic curvature, while the configurational entropy's curvature switches from convex (first-order) to concave (continuous), mirroring defect proliferation measured by Shannon entropy. The convexity of the energy is dominated by the inherent potential, with minimal vibrational influence. Finally, we predict and verify that the first-order transition becomes continuous at zero temperature, where entropic effects vanish. Our work establishes the curvature of different thermodynamic quantities as a fundamental principle for understanding the nature of two-dimensional melting."}

We resolve two distinct electronic flat-band states located in close proximity to the Fermi level: a robust Topological Surface Flat Band at ~40 meV below the Fermi level on the Sulfur-terminated surface, originating from weak topological insulator states, and a kagome lattice-derived flat band at ~100 meV binding energy with an ultranarrow bandwidth (~5 meV). Instead of the single Dirac cone, the Indium-terminated surface hosts a rare two-dimensional Dirac-node arc state, where the gapless Dirac nodes extend along an open one-dimensional line crossing the Brillouin-zone boundary, exhibiting sharp linear dispersion, exceptionally high Fermi velocity, and pronounced circular dichroism.

By exemplifying the Aubry-Andre model, we find that gapped, gapless, and localized-critical-extended phases are sharply distinguished by the quantum hyperuniformity classes.

In this study, graphene grown by chemical vapor deposition was transferred from copper onto the top of the standard AlGaN/GaN wafer, forming a heterostructure with two conducting layers separated by an AlGaN barrier layer. Contacts fabricated to the two-dimensional electron gas and graphene allowed us to study the drag current induced in graphene by passing the drive current through the two-dimensional electron gas. At low temperatures, the graphene drag current exhibited quantum oscillations as a function of the drive voltage. As temperature increases, quantum oscillations disappear, and the magnitude of the drag current increases. Graphene/AlGaN/GaN heterostructures are a promising platform for studying drag and two-stream instability effects, especially if the AlGaN barrier layer thickness can be reduced to a few nanometers."}

One contentious issue regarding this material is its bulk structure in the low-temperature phase. Recently, it has become generally accepted from experiments that the low- and high-temperature structures belong to the $R\\bar{3}$ and $C2/m$ space groups, respectively. However, there was no theoretical study supporting the $R\\bar{3}$-type structure as the low-temperature structure. In this study, we use constrained density functional theory to show that the $R\\bar{3}$ structure is lower in energy than the $C2/m$ structure, in agreement with experimental observations. Then, we show that the conduction band minimum states are almost of the $J_\\textrm{eff}=1/2$ and $m_\\textrm{eff}=-1/2$ character, if we set the angular momentum quantization axis to be parallel to the Néel vector; this is the first analysis of the $J_\\textrm{eff}$ picture for $α$-RuCl$_3$ from this perspective. In addition, we compute the anisotropic magnetic exchange parameters and $g$ factors of monolayer $α$-RuCl$_3$, thereby providing a comprehensive understanding of its magnetism. Our results demonstrate that both second-nearest-neighbor exchange interactions and magnetic moments not captured by the conventional atomic orbital projection method are necessary for accurate description of the magnetism in $α$-RuCl$_3$. Moreover, the calculated $g$ factors are in fairly good agreement with experimental measurements, especially the small anisotropy between their in-plane and out-of-plane components. Finally, we examine the effects of structural distortions from a perfect RuCl$_6$ octahedron, already present in bulk $α$-RuCl$_3$ without any external perturbation, on the magnetic properties.

This diagram is characterized by an unusual V-shaped nonmonotonic evolution of T*(P) and the emergence of a superconducting dome with Tcmax = 240 mK upon suppression of AF order at Pc = 6 GPa, coinciding with the minimum of T*(P).The close proximity of the superconductivity (SC) to the AF instability and an unusually large upper critical field Bc2(0) exceeding 4-7 times the Pauli paramagnetic limit, suggests an unconventional pairing mechanism in CeSiI. Further analyses of normal-state transport properties provide evidence of quantum criticality, i.e., non-Fermi-liquid behavior and divergence of quasiparticle effective mass near Pc = 7 GPa. Our findings not only establish CeSiI as the first vdW heavy-fermion superconductor but also highlight an unconventional nature for the Kondo coherent state at T* at ambient pressure, hence opening a new avenue to study the interplay of strong electron correlation, Kondo hybridization, magnetism, and unconventional SC in the vdW heavy-fermion systems."}

Primary examples include the recently realized fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) in twisted MoTe2 bilayers (tMoTe2) and multilayer graphene aligned with hBN, where TRS is broken in partially filled flat moire Chern bands. Among the FCIs in tMoTe2, the most robust is at a hole filling of v = -2/3 per moire unit cell. Interestingly, transient optical sensing and more recent transport measurements revealed a correlated state at v = -4/3, twice the filling factor for the v = -2/3 FCI. Here, employing pump-probe circular dichroism (CD) measurements on tMoTe2 with twist angles = 3.9 degree and 3.7 degree, we find that the v = -4/3 state exhibits vanishing magnetization (m = 0) in finite windows of out-of-plane magnetic field less than ~2-4 mT, and a first order phase transition to + - m states at higher fields. This out-of-plane antiferromagnetic (AFM) like behavior is notably absent for all other correlated states and disappears for the v = -4/3 state at higher or lower twist angles = 4.0 degree and 3.3 degree. The observed magnetic signature at v = -4/3 is consistent with a predicted fractional topological insulator (FTI) with TRS, consisting of two copies of -2/3 FCIs with opposite chiralities. We support these findings with calculations in the interacting continuum model of tMoTe2. Our work presents a candidate for fractional topological insulators with TRS."}

In cuprate superconductors,the intertwinement of superconductivity and CDW order could strongly affect the fundamental properties of superconductivity, such as the critical temperature(Tc) and critical magnetic field(Hc). Recent high-field transport measurements indicate that when quantum fluctuations become important at low temperatures and high magnetic fields, the CDW order also reshapes the vortex states, which leads to fragile superconductivity with extremely low critical current(Jc). Here, by performing comprehensive high-field transport measurements, the H-T phase diagram of vortex states is mapped to H = 33 T in a quasi-two-dimensional FeSe-based superconductor (TBA+)xFeSe with a zero-resistivity transition temperature above 40 K. Our results indicate that (TBA+)xFeSe is an extremely type II superconductor with significant thermal fluctuations.At low temperatures, high magnetic fields cause the vortex solid state to exhibit similar current-dependent zero-resistance behavior as the fragile superconductivity in cuprate superconductors with CDW order. When the vortex solid state is melted with increasing temperature, a superconducting regime with vortex-like phase fluctuations emerges as an intermediate state, which features finite longitudinal resistance and vanishing Hall resistance. At higher temperatures, a vortex liquid state with finite Hall resistance eventually appears due to thermal fluctuations. All these observations suggest exotic vortex states beyond the classical paradigm of vortex matter."}

We first derive boundary conditions that fully incorporate reflection, transmission, and mode conversion. We obtain these conditions for phonons from those for classical lattice vibrations, using the correspondence between the quantum and classical descriptions. This formulation provides a theoretical foundation for the acoustic mismatch model, widely used to analyze Kapitza resistance. We then refine the boundary conditions to include spatial dependence parallel to the interface. The refined form captures transverse shifts of elastic wave packets, analogous to the optical Imbert--Fedorov shift, and ensures conservation of total angular momentum. Consequently, circularly polarized phonons carrying spin angular momentum (SAM) generate phonon orbital angular momentum (OAM) at the interface. We analytically determine the spatial profile of this OAM and demonstrate that SAM and OAM are both involved in the interfacial diffusion of chiral phonons. Our theory provides concise boundary conditions for phonons, with applications ranging from heat transport to phonon angular momentum transport."}

The cycloaromatization of individual n octane molecules requires bending the linear adsorbates prior to their dehydrogenation and the formation of an intramolecular C-C bond, yielding adsorbed benzene rings.

Inspired by these experiments we develop a mechanism which can explain such a giant resonant enhancement of light-induced superconductivity.

Such a coupling then modulates the effective electron-electron attraction, with the strongest modulations occurring when the drive is resonant with the phonon frequency. These dynamical modulations of the pairing interactions lead to Floquet-BCS instabilities at temperatures far exceeding equilibrium $T_c$, as observed in experiments.

The crystal structure was characterized using single crystal X-ray diffraction, which reveals that Na2Co3(AsO4)2(OH)2 crystallizes in the monoclinic crystal system C2/m. The structure features a one-dimensional kagome strip lattice built from Co2+ ions and undergoes an antiferromagnetic transition at TN = 14 K.

Below the magnetic transition, Na2Co3(AsO4)2(OH)2 orders into an antiferromagnetic structure with a k-vector (0.5, 0.5, 0.5). In the proposed model, the Co1 moment is predominantly confined to the ac-plane while the Co2 moment is primarily aligned along the b-axis.

The use of TR-APXPS allows for real-time monitoring of chemical changes at the surface of Iron oxides during reduction, providing valuable insights into the reaction mechanisms and kinetics involved. One key challenge in analyzing TR-APXPS data is the presence of overlapping peaks and complex spectral features, which can make accurate quantification and interpretation difficult. Traditional spectral fitting methods may struggle with these complexities and result in ambiguous or inaccurate results. However, the chemometric approaches are promising tools to overcome these challenges by extracting pure spectral profiles of individual chemical species and their temporal profiles from the complex and overlapping data. The results obtained from the TR-APXPS coupled with PCA and MCR-ALS analysis provide a detailed and precise understanding of the surface chemical changes during the Fe2O3 reduction. This includes identifying and following the formation of various intermediate species and their evolution over time, which permits later to establish correlations between surface chemistry and process conditions. The integration of both chemometric tools in TR-APXPS data analysis not only addresses the challenges associated with complex spectral features, but also contributes to a deeper understanding of the underlying chemical changes and their dynamics. The obtained results have significant implications for process optimization, material synthesis, and tailoring of material properties for specific applications."}

For a nondegenerate reference, it is identical to the single-reference, projection coupled-cluster ansatz. For degenerate references, it is a natural coupled-cluster extension of degenerate RS perturbation ($Δ$MP) theory, and is closely related to, but distinct from Li and Paldus's state-universal multireference coupled-cluster (SUMRCC) theory. For ionized and electron-attached references, it can be viewed as a coupled-cluster Green's function, although the present theory is convergent toward the full-configuration-interaction (FCI) limits, while many-body Green's function (MBGF) theory generally is not. Its single-excitation instance is a projection (nonvariational) Hartree-Fock theory for a degenerate or nondegenerate reference as per the Thouless theorem, whose practical utility seems rather limited except for core ionizations, high-spin states, and possibly electron affinities.

While approaches to describe microscopic correlations in many specific cases exist, no general theory for multistage reactions has been established. In this article, we apply the quantum field theory approach to derive kinetic equations for general multistage reactive systems termed CMET (complete modified encounter theory). CMET can be formulated as a set of coupled partial differential equations that can be easily integrated numerically, thereby serving as a versatile tool for investigating reaction-diffusion processes. Across multiple case studies, we demonstrated that CMET reproduces the kinetics predicted by many other theories within their respective scopes of applicability."}
