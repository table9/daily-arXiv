Recent cold-atom experiments on a simulator of the Hubbard model with nearest-neighbor hoppings \\cite{kendrick2025pseudogap} showed that the isothermal compressibility $κ(δ)$ has a maximum as a function of doping $δ$. Here we use the two-particle self-consistent plus (TPSC+) approach to explain these experiments and connect the maximum in $κ(δ)$ to the transformation of the single-particle spectrum from the pseudogapped to the metallic regime. This elucidates the nature of the pseudogap (PG). Specifically, the maximum in $κ(δ)$ practically coincides with the doping at which the precursor of the lower $(π,π)$ spin density wave (SDW) band at the antinodal point crosses the zero-frequency $ω=0$. The Knight shift, $χ_{sp}(0,0)(δ)$, as a function of doping, should also have a maximum. The maxima in both quantities should exist, at sufficiently low temperatures ($T$), in both the intermediate $U \\approx U_{Mott}$ and weak $U < U_{Mott}$ interaction limits. In both limits, the mechanism is critical thermal SDW fluctuations. At the antinodal pseudogap, the correlation length at $δ_{max}(T)$ can be small, controlled not by static but by dynamic critical thermal fluctuations. We also find that the SDW fluctuations are incommensurate at $δ=δ_{max}$. We predict that, at low $T$, the multiple peaks in the spin susceptibility in the incommensurate case lead to more than two SDW precursor peaks in the spectral function and density of states. By allowing access to parameter regimes relevant to cuprates-including further-neighbor hopping ($t', t''$) and low temperatures, our work provides a high-impact tool for further studies by the broader community."}

Here we demonstrate that these improvements arise from differences in the one-particle density matrix that are encoded into the non-canonical Fock matrix and not from the nature of the KS orbitals, as is commonly assumed. Equipped with this insight, KS-CCSD(T) can be leveraged to achieve near-chemical-accuracy for electronic and thermochemical properties of transition-metal dimers and main-group compounds. Most strikingly, KS-CCSD(T) qualitatively recovers the entire Cr$_2$ potential energy surface, a notorious failure case for HF-CCSD(T) and single-reference density functional theory. We further introduce a density difference diagnostic that identifies multireference character and guides practitioners toward rational selections of optimal references at mean-field cost. These results establish KS-CCSD(T) as a practical route to treat strong correlation within the \"gold standard\" framework, and this has immediate implications for machine learning potential development and materials research, areas that heavily rely on KS-DFT for model-parameter fitting."}

Yet they remain unexplored in thin-film form due to the difficulty of stabilizing nitrogen-poor ternaries among competing phases. Here, we report the thin-film synthesis and phase-stability mapping of the η-nitride systems Fe-W-N and Fe-Mo-N. Amorphous Fe-M-N (M = W, Mo) combinatorial libraries deposited by reactive co-sputtering crystallize upon rapid thermal annealing, enabling systematic identification of synthesis windows as a function of composition and annealing temperature. Using laboratory powder X-ray diffraction and synchrotron grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering, we establish that Fe3Mo3N-based η-carbide phases form over a substantially broader compositional and thermal range than W-based compositions, where η-structures are stabilized only when the films are Fe-rich. These trends are rationalized using mixed chemical-potential vs. composition phase diagrams that capture the narrow nitrogen chemical-potential stability of η-nitrides. Magnetic measurements reveal that ferromagnetism is induced in Fe-rich Fe3.54Mo2.46N with a small exchange-bias-like response that is absent in Fe3W3N-based compositions, highlighting the sensitivity of magnetic behavior to modest deviations from stoichiometry. This work establishes practical thin-film synthesis routes for η-nitride materials and demonstrates how composition can be tuned to access emergent magnetic phenomena in these complex nitrides."}

Using Green's function theory and the Jordan-Wigner transformation, we map the system onto spinless fermions and focus on antiferromagnetic (AFM) interactions. At zero temperature, distinct 1/5 and 3/5 magnetization plateaus emerge, determined by the global periodicity Q=5, with the number of plateaus matching the number of excitation gaps above the Fermi level of the spinless fermions. The magnetic phase diagram in the (h-Js) plane features a Luttinger liquid (LL) state, a gapless AFM state, two magnetization plateau states, and a fully polarized gapped magnetic state. The widths of the LL and gapless AFM phases are found to be proportional to the bandwidths gamma = |E(k=0)-E(k=pi)| of the corresponding elementary excitations, whereas the widths of the magnetization plateau states are governed by the excitation gaps. Our study opens new directions for exploring interacting trimer-dimer spin chains in quantum magnetism using experimental techniques such as neutron scattering, as well as theoretical and numerical approaches including quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) and density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) methods. Furthermore, we extend the Oshikawa-Yamanaka-Affleck (OYA) condition to generalized cluster chains, demonstrating that the allowed magnetization plateaus are governed by the global periodicity of the chain (e.g., Q=5 for a trimer-dimer chain), rather than by the local periodicity of individual units (Q=3 for a trimer or Q=2 for a dimer)."}

Path-integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) provides a rigorous framework for incorporating NQEs, but its practical applicability is often limited by the slow and strongly system-dependent convergence with respect to the number of beads. Here we introduce path-integral generalized smoothed trajectory analysis (PIGSTA), a post-processing framework for the systematic incorporation of NQEs into atomistic simulations, using either classical or path-integral molecular dynamics trajectories. By applying analytically defined convolution kernels to simulation trajectories, PIGSTA corrects the frequency-dependent discretization error associated with a finite number of beads, without modifying the underlying dynamics. For harmonic systems, PIGSTA recovers the exact quantum-mechanical limit at any bead number, whereas standard PIMD becomes exact only in the infinite-bead limit. More generally, the method significantly improves the convergence of thermodynamic and structural observables at finite bead numbers and provides an internal, reference-free diagnostic of bead-number convergence based on the consistency of energy and force estimators. We assess PIGSTA for ambient liquid water and for the Zundel cation at ultralow temperature, representing a particularly demanding case for bead-number convergence. In both systems, PIGSTA reproduces the converged PIMD limit and enables physically consistent results at reduced bead numbers when convergence criteria are satisfied. Owing to its post-processing nature and negligible additional computational cost, PIGSTA offers a practical and broadly applicable approach for incorporating NQEs into atomistic simulations."}

Using in-situ angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we measured the electronic and gap structures of a single CuO$_2$ plane. We observed a \\textit{d}-wave-like gap which closes somewhat above the bulk T$_c$. Moreover, almost identical gap properties are seen for both single CuO$_2$ plane and bulk. These observations lead us to the conclusion that the d-wave superconductivity of cuprates also exists in a single CuO$_2$ plane. Our results demonstrate that cuprate superconductivity is essentially a two-dimensional phenomenon and provide a platform to study cuprate superconductivity in a purely two-dimensional system."}

We present a joint experimental-theoretical investigation of dimethyl phosphate (DMP-) in aqueous solution, an established model system of the sugar-phosphate backbone. Utilizing 31P-NMR spectroscopy as probe of phosphate-ion association, variations of Mg2+ and Ca2+ content exhibit a systematic shielding of the 31P chemical shift (δiso(31P)) with moderate temperature dependence. Enhanced sampling molecular dynamics (MD) and ab initio (GIAO-DF-LMP2) level of theory are used to reveal the microscopic mechanism. Simulations are performed for a configurational ensemble of DMP-ion geometries and their first solvation shells, demonstrating (i) the spatial convergence of changes of the nuclear shielding constant σiso(31P), (ii) the intramolecular geometric origin of short-timescale σiso(31P) fluctuations and (iii) an average shift of σiso(31P) of about 3-5 ppm upon contact ion pair formation with Mg2+ or Ca2+ ions. A quantitative analysis of δiso(31P) for varying ion content and temperature allows us to extract the temperature-dependent fraction of the contact ion pair species, indicating that solvent separated or free ion pairs are the energetically preferred species. The results impose boundary conditions for improvements of phosphate ion force fields and establish the interactions underlying the changes of δiso(31P)."}

The scattering matrix is constructed using the biorthogonality of the left and right scattering states of the Hamiltonian, allowing us to calculate the reflection and transmission probabilities. Our analysis compares the reflection and transmission coefficients derived from the left, right, and combined scattering states, revealing that, unlike in Hermitian systems, the non-Hermitian scattering process does not adhere to unitarity when considering only the right scattering states. Furthermore, non-Hermitian scattering can enhance the reflection and transmission probabilities, with distinct physical contributions arising independently from complex eigenvalues and the non-orthogonality of eigenstates. Our results clarify how biorthogonality restores generalized unitarity and identify distinct physical origins of enhanced transport in PT-symmetric and non-reciprocal dimers, providing new insights into quantum transport in non-Hermitian systems."}

Differences of 15 meV in the onset energies of the valence and conduction bands between MX- and XM-stacked regions are observed and are unexpected based on symmetry considerations.

We introduce mimyria, a modular and automated framework that orchestrates electronic-structure reference calculations, trains atom-resolved machine-learning response models, and generates IR and Raman spectra from MD trajectories within a unified workflow. We introduce the polarizability gradient tensor (PGT) as a novel atom-resolved machine-learning target property for Raman spectroscopy, complementing the established atomic polar tensor (APT) for IR spectroscopy. As a necessary prerequisite, we demonstrate how both PGTs and APTs can accurately be computed from electronic-structure theory, validate them across formally equivalent derivative formulations, and thereby benchmark their numerical consistency. We then employ machine learning as an efficient surrogate to represent the validated APT and PGT response functions on aqueous benchmark systems. We validate the trained models directly at the level of the spectrum against explicit ab initio reference calculations and find that IR and Raman spectra converge with surprisingly small training sets. Moreover, spectral agreement improves more rapidly than the root-mean-square error (RMSE). While RMSE is straightforward to compute, statistically converged reference spectra are generally impractical to obtain, motivating the need to relate model-level errors to observable-level accuracy. By connecting these complementary error measures, we provide practical guidelines and early-stopping criteria for achieving sufficient spectral fidelity.

This theoretical insight reveals that a susceptible node acts as a dynamical decoupler, factorizing the global evolution operator into localized components. Leveraging this, TNDMP provides a dual-mode algorithmic suite: an exact algorithm that computes local observables with minimal redundancy on tractable topologies and a scalable and tunable approximation for complex real-world networks. We demonstrate that widely adopted heuristics, such as Dynamical Message Passing (DMP) and Pair Approximation (PA), are mathematically recoverable as low-order limits of our framework. Numerical validation in synthetic and real-world networks confirms that TNDMP significantly outperforms existing methods to predict epidemic thresholds and steady states, offering a rigorous bridge between the efficiency of message passing and the accuracy of tensor network formalisms."}

In this report, we combine excitation-energy-, temperature-, and geometry-dependent photoemission measurements to probe the electronic structure of LaCoO3 across its thermally driven spin-state transition. By systematically comparing valence-band spectra across a wide photon-energy window - from surface-sensitive soft x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (SXPS) to bulk-sensitive hard x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (HAXPES) - we identify the Co 3d-derived feature (A) along with the O 2p-dominated features (B and C), and explain their relative evolution in terms of photon-energy-dependent photo-ionization cross-section ratios. The thermally induced spin-state crossover is demonstrated using temperature-dependent SXPS valence-band spectra, which show a progressive suppression of the feature A with heating. Geometry-dependent HAXPES measurements further clarify how the signature of the spin-state transition in LaCoO3 is intricately linked to the orbital-selective response of the t2g and eg states. Additionally, angular-dependent photo-ionization cross-section analysis provides a consistent description of the polarization dependence observed in HAXPES. Finally, configuration-interaction analysis of the Co 2p core-level spectra reveals that LaCoO3 evolves from a predominantly low-spin ground state at low temperature to a mixed low-spin/high-spin configuration at elevated temperatures, with the high-spin fraction reaching about 30 percent at 400 K. The temperature evolution of the core-level line shape thus establishes Co 2p photoemission as a sensitive quantitative probe of spin-state transitions in LaCoO3."}

However, the canonical Majorana platform based on $2e$ TSCs remains computationally constrained. In this work, we find a $4e$ TSC that overcomes these constraints by combining a charge-$4e$ condensate with an Abelian chiral $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ topological order in an intertwined fashion. Remarkably, this $4e$ TSC can be obtained by proliferating vortex-antivortex pairs in a stack of two $2e$ $p+ip$ TSCs, or by melting a $ν=2/3$ quantum Hall state. Specific to this TSC, the $hc/(4e)$ fluxes act as charge-conjugation defects in the topological order, whose braiding with anyons transmutes anyons into their antiparticles. This symmetry enrichment leads to $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ parafermion zero modes trapped in the elementary vortex cores, which naturally encode qutrits. Braiding the parafermion defects alone generates the full many-qutrit Clifford group. We further show that a simple single-probe interferometric measurement enables topologically protected magic-state preparation, promoting Clifford operations to a universal gate set. Importantly, the non-Abelian excitations in the $4e$ TSC are confined to externally controlled defects, making them uniquely identifiable and amenable to controlled creation and motion with superconducting-circuit technology. Our results establish hierarchical electron aggregation as a complementary principle for engineering topological quantum matter with enhanced computational power."}

In this work, we explore a ratchet effect generated in two dimensional tellurene, a novel promising semiconductor material consisting of helical atomic chains, creating a structure with inherent chirality. As a key result, the DC circular ratchet current flowing in the chiral axis direction $c$ is determined by the helicity of the radiation and can be reversed by switching the helicity from right to left handed. The circular ratchet effect excited by THz laser radiation is demonstrated for room temperature. The effect is demonstrated at various gate voltages when the Fermi level lies in vicinity of the Weyl point in the conduction band, in the band gap, and in the valence band with almost parabolic energy dispersion.

On the other hand, it is recently established that even pure quantum states can represent thermal equilibrium. However, pure quantum states do not satisfy the second law in that they are not passive, i.e., work can be extracted from them if arbitrary unitary operations are allowed. It therefore remains unresolved how quantum mechanics can be reconciled with thermodynamics. Here, based on our key quantum-mechanical notions of thermal equilibrium and adiabatic operations, we address the emergence of the second law for adiabatic operations in the thermodynamics limit. We first introduce infinite-observable macroscopic thermal equilibrium (iMATE); a quantum state, including pure states, is in iMATE if the expectation values of all additive observables agree with their equilibrium values. We also introduce a macroscopic operation as unitary evolution generated by a time-dependent additive Hamiltonian, which is regarded as corresponding to adiabatic operations. Employing these concepts, we show that no extensive work can be extracted from any quantum state in iMATE through any macroscopic operations. Furthermore, we introduce a quantum-mechanical form of entropy density such that it agrees with thermodynamic entropy density for any quantum state in iMATE. We then prove that for any initial state in iMATE, this entropy density cannot be decreased by any macroscopic operations, followed by a time-independent relaxation process. Our theory thus proves two different forms of the second law, by adopting macroscopically reasonable classes of observables, equilibrium states, and operations. We also discuss the time scales of macroscopic operations in these results."}

Amorphous Fe-M-N (M = W, Mo) combinatorial libraries deposited by reactive co-sputtering crystallize upon rapid thermal annealing, enabling systematic identification of synthesis windows as a function of composition and annealing temperature. Using laboratory powder X-ray diffraction and synchrotron grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering, we establish that Fe3Mo3N-based η-carbide phases form over a substantially broader compositional and thermal range than W-based compositions, where η-structures are stabilized only when the films are Fe-rich. These trends are rationalized using mixed chemical-potential vs. composition phase diagrams that capture the narrow nitrogen chemical-potential stability of η-nitrides. Magnetic measurements reveal that ferromagnetism is induced in Fe-rich Fe3.54Mo2.46N with a small exchange-bias-like response that is absent in Fe3W3N-based compositions, highlighting the sensitivity of magnetic behavior to modest deviations from stoichiometry.

Typically, the functional (e.g., optoelectronic) properties of hybrid halides are derived from the inorganic structural part, whereas the organic structural units can add extra advantages in terms of stability, rigidity, and processability. Here, we report the design, synthesis, and characterization of two new hybrid materials in which the outstanding photophysical properties originate from the organic structural part. The new compounds, (C15H16N)2CdCl4 and ((Br)C15H15N)2CdCl4, have 2D layered Ruddlesden-Poppertype perovskite structures. These hybrids are blue-white light emitters just like their corresponding pure organic salts, but with much improved emission efficiencies. Optical spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) studies confirm that photoemission comes from the trans-stilbene organic cations. The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) values of these new materials are among the highest known, 50.83 % and 26.60 % for (C15H16N)2CdCl4 and ((Br)C15H15N)2CdCl4, respectively.

We show how Coulomb interactions modify Andreev-mediated transport by renormalizing resonant conditions and suppressing superconducting coherence, leading to a pronounced reduction of current precision even when average currents are only weakly affected. These effects are particularly evident at high temperatures, where conventional Coulomb-blockade features are thermally smeared while fluctuation properties remain highly sensitive. By analyzing thermodynamic uncertainty relations, we demonstrate that violations of the quantum bound present in the noninteracting regime are progressively reduced and eventually suppressed as interactions increase, whereas the recently proposed hybrid bound remains satisfied.

Recent cold-atom experiments on a simulator of the Hubbard model with nearest-neighbor hoppings \\cite{kendrick2025pseudogap} showed that the isothermal compressibility $κ(δ)$ has a maximum as a function of doping $δ$. Here we use the two-particle self-consistent plus (TPSC+) approach to explain these experiments and connect the maximum in $κ(δ)$ to the transformation of the single-particle spectrum from the pseudogapped to the metallic regime. This elucidates the nature of the pseudogap (PG). Specifically, the maximum in $κ(δ)$ practically coincides with the doping at which the precursor of the lower $(π,π)$ spin density wave (SDW) band at the antinodal point crosses the zero-frequency $ω=0$. The Knight shift, $χ_{sp}(0,0)(δ)$, as a function of doping, should also have a maximum. The maxima in both quantities should exist, at sufficiently low temperatures ($T$), in both the intermediate $U \\approx U_{Mott}$ and weak $U < U_{Mott}$ interaction limits. In both limits, the mechanism is critical thermal SDW fluctuations. At the antinodal pseudogap, the correlation length at $δ_{max}(T)$ can be small, controlled not by static but by dynamic critical thermal fluctuations. We also find that the SDW fluctuations are incommensurate at $δ=δ_{max}$. We predict that, at low $T$, the multiple peaks in the spin susceptibility in the incommensurate case lead to more than two SDW precursor peaks in the spectral function and density of states. By allowing access to parameter regimes relevant to cuprates-including further-neighbor hopping ($t', t''$) and low temperatures, our work provides a high-impact tool for further studies by the broader community."}

Scandium nitride (ScN) is particularly sensitive to irradiation-induced disorder, with transport properties spanning several orders of magnitude and multiple conduction mechanisms involved. In this study, we investigate the evolution of electrical transport in epitaxial ScN thin films undergoing accumulated irradiation damage at an initial defect state. A phenomenological damage-accumulation model was successfully combined with temperature dependent resistivity and Hall effect measurements to elucidate the impact of defect buildup on electrical transport and to provide physically grounded, quantitative insight into the nature and accumulation of irradiation-induced defects. It reveals two distinct defects-generation regimes of electrically active defects. At low doses, direct-impact damage produces stable and isolated acceptor-type complex defects, (VSc-X) with VSc a scandium vacancy and X denoting residual impurities, leading to a gradual increase in resistivity. At higher doses, defect accumulation dominates through a multi-hit process, giving rise to point-defect buildup and carrier localization, resulting in hopping-dominated transport. This localized regime is thermally unstable and recovers upon low-temperature annealing. We further demonstrate that the residual defect landscape strongly influences both the critical dose for the metal-insulator transition and the localization strength: films grown on Al2O3 exhibit an earlier transition and weaker localization than those grown on MgO. These results highlight ion implantation as an effective route for engineering disorder-induced localization in ScN, with the initial film quality playing a decisive role."}

Both systems exhibit strong spin-phonon coupling below the short-range magnetic ordering temperature (T(sro)=223 K), followed by further renormalization of several Raman modes at the long-range magnetic ordering temperatures (TN = 120 K for MNO and 110 K for MTO). Pronounced anomalies in Raman mode frequencies and linewidths, along with the emergence of octahedral modes between Tsro and TN, indicate a possible low-symmetry structural transition, more evident in MNO and closely linked to magnetic ordering in MTO. Distinct low-temperature evolutions of Raman mode shift, linewidth, and integrated intensity in MNO and MTO highlight the role of the nonmagnetic B-site cation in tuning spin-lattice coupling, driven by differences in spin-orbit coupling and orbital hybridization between Nb5+ (4d) and Ta5+ (5d). By combining Raman spectroscopy with nuclear magnetic resonance, and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, we further show that Mn-based systems possess a more distorted local structure than their Co analogues, while their electronic structures differ despite comparable band gaps.

Two equilibrium states in such a film are separated by a potential barrier that might be overpassed if the femtosecond pulse fluence exceeds a threshold value, so that magnetization is reversed after the pulse action. The switching threshold depends strongly on the value of applied in-plane external magnetic field, and is different for the two initial magnetization states and two opposite optical pulse helicites. This makes it possible to perform optomagnonic non-thermal deterministic writing of a magnetic bit. Such switching mechanism can be used for realizing reconfigurable optomagnonic logic elements without thermal assistance. Logical operations are implemented by encoding inputs in the amplitude and helicity of the optical pulses, while outputs are written as the magnetization state. The study demonstrates a pathway towards heating-free optomagnonic logic and memory devices."}

Our analysis compares the reflection and transmission coefficients derived from the left, right, and combined scattering states, revealing that, unlike in Hermitian systems, the non-Hermitian scattering process does not adhere to unitarity when considering only the right scattering states. Furthermore, non-Hermitian scattering can enhance the reflection and transmission probabilities, with distinct physical contributions arising independently from complex eigenvalues and the non-orthogonality of eigenstates.

In this work, we explore a ratchet effect generated in two dimensional tellurene, a novel promising semiconductor material consisting of helical atomic chains, creating a structure with inherent chirality. As a key result, the DC circular ratchet current flowing in the chiral axis direction $c$ is determined by the helicity of the radiation and can be reversed by switching the helicity from right to left handed. The circular ratchet effect excited by THz laser radiation is demonstrated for room temperature. The effect is demonstrated at various gate voltages when the Fermi level lies in vicinity of the Weyl point in the conduction band, in the band gap, and in the valence band with almost parabolic energy dispersion.

Using Green's function theory and the Jordan-Wigner transformation, we map the system onto spinless fermions and focus on antiferromagnetic (AFM) interactions. At zero temperature, distinct 1/5 and 3/5 magnetization plateaus emerge, determined by the global periodicity Q=5, with the number of plateaus matching the number of excitation gaps above the Fermi level of the spinless fermions. The magnetic phase diagram in the (h-Js) plane features a Luttinger liquid (LL) state, a gapless AFM state, two magnetization plateau states, and a fully polarized gapped magnetic state. The widths of the LL and gapless AFM phases are found to be proportional to the bandwidths gamma = |E(k=0)-E(k=pi)| of the corresponding elementary excitations, whereas the widths of the magnetization plateau states are governed by the excitation gaps. Our study opens new directions for exploring interacting trimer-dimer spin chains in quantum magnetism using experimental techniques such as neutron scattering, as well as theoretical and numerical approaches including quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) and density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) methods. Furthermore, we extend the Oshikawa-Yamanaka-Affleck (OYA) condition to generalized cluster chains, demonstrating that the allowed magnetization plateaus are governed by the global periodicity of the chain (e.g., Q=5 for a trimer-dimer chain), rather than by the local periodicity of individual units (Q=3 for a trimer or Q=2 for a dimer)."}

In this report, we combine excitation-energy-, temperature-, and geometry-dependent photoemission measurements to probe the electronic structure of LaCoO3 across its thermally driven spin-state transition. By systematically comparing valence-band spectra across a wide photon-energy window - from surface-sensitive soft x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (SXPS) to bulk-sensitive hard x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (HAXPES) - we identify the Co 3d-derived feature (A) along with the O 2p-dominated features (B and C), and explain their relative evolution in terms of photon-energy-dependent photo-ionization cross-section ratios. The thermally induced spin-state crossover is demonstrated using temperature-dependent SXPS valence-band spectra, which show a progressive suppression of the feature A with heating. Geometry-dependent HAXPES measurements further clarify how the signature of the spin-state transition in LaCoO3 is intricately linked to the orbital-selective response of the t2g and eg states. Additionally, angular-dependent photo-ionization cross-section analysis provides a consistent description of the polarization dependence observed in HAXPES. Finally, configuration-interaction analysis of the Co 2p core-level spectra reveals that LaCoO3 evolves from a predominantly low-spin ground state at low temperature to a mixed low-spin/high-spin configuration at elevated temperatures, with the high-spin fraction reaching about 30 percent at 400 K. The temperature evolution of the core-level line shape thus establishes Co 2p photoemission as a sensitive quantitative probe of spin-state transitions in LaCoO3."}

Starting from an unordered collection of measurement outcomes, we formulate inference as a constrained large deviation problem, selecting probability assignments that minimize relative entropy with respect to a reference measure determined solely by the measurement setup. We show that among all microscopic structures compatible with a given macroscopic constraint, those rendering the observation statistically most typical are selected. As an explicit illustration, we demonstrate how ordered microscopic structures can emerge purely from inference under constraint, even when the reference measure is fully permutation symmetric. Order is thus not assumed but inferred, serving here only as an illustrative example of a broader class of relational explanatory hypotheses constrained by observation."}

Here, we resolve this trade-off by introducing Tensor Network Dynamical Message Passing (TNDMP), a framework grounded in a rigorous property we term \\textit{Susceptible-Induced Factorization}. This theoretical insight reveals that a susceptible node acts as a dynamical decoupler, factorizing the global evolution operator into localized components. Leveraging this, TNDMP provides a dual-mode algorithmic suite: an exact algorithm that computes local observables with minimal redundancy on tractable topologies and a scalable and tunable approximation for complex real-world networks. We demonstrate that widely adopted heuristics, such as Dynamical Message Passing (DMP) and Pair Approximation (PA), are mathematically recoverable as low-order limits of our framework. Numerical validation in synthetic and real-world networks confirms that TNDMP significantly outperforms existing methods to predict epidemic thresholds and steady states, offering a rigorous bridge between the efficiency of message passing and the accuracy of tensor network formalisms."}

On the other hand, it is recently established that even pure quantum states can represent thermal equilibrium. However, pure quantum states do not satisfy the second law in that they are not passive, i.e., work can be extracted from them if arbitrary unitary operations are allowed. It therefore remains unresolved how quantum mechanics can be reconciled with thermodynamics. Here, based on our key quantum-mechanical notions of thermal equilibrium and adiabatic operations, we address the emergence of the second law for adiabatic operations in the thermodynamics limit. We first introduce infinite-observable macroscopic thermal equilibrium (iMATE); a quantum state, including pure states, is in iMATE if the expectation values of all additive observables agree with their equilibrium values. We also introduce a macroscopic operation as unitary evolution generated by a time-dependent additive Hamiltonian, which is regarded as corresponding to adiabatic operations. Employing these concepts, we show that no extensive work can be extracted from any quantum state in iMATE through any macroscopic operations. Furthermore, we introduce a quantum-mechanical form of entropy density such that it agrees with thermodynamic entropy density for any quantum state in iMATE. We then prove that for any initial state in iMATE, this entropy density cannot be decreased by any macroscopic operations, followed by a time-independent relaxation process. Our theory thus proves two different forms of the second law, by adopting macroscopically reasonable classes of observables, equilibrium states, and operations. We also discuss the time scales of macroscopic operations in these results."}

In this work, we explore a ratchet effect generated in two dimensional tellurene, a novel promising semiconductor material consisting of helical atomic chains, creating a structure with inherent chirality. As a key result, the DC circular ratchet current flowing in the chiral axis direction $c$ is determined by the helicity of the radiation and can be reversed by switching the helicity from right to left handed. The circular ratchet effect excited by THz laser radiation is demonstrated for room temperature. The effect is demonstrated at various gate voltages when the Fermi level lies in vicinity of the Weyl point in the conduction band, in the band gap, and in the valence band with almost parabolic energy dispersion.

In this report, we combine excitation-energy-, temperature-, and geometry-dependent photoemission measurements to probe the electronic structure of LaCoO3 across its thermally driven spin-state transition. By systematically comparing valence-band spectra across a wide photon-energy window - from surface-sensitive soft x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (SXPS) to bulk-sensitive hard x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (HAXPES) - we identify the Co 3d-derived feature (A) along with the O 2p-dominated features (B and C), and explain their relative evolution in terms of photon-energy-dependent photo-ionization cross-section ratios. The thermally induced spin-state crossover is demonstrated using temperature-dependent SXPS valence-band spectra, which show a progressive suppression of the feature A with heating. Geometry-dependent HAXPES measurements further clarify how the signature of the spin-state transition in LaCoO3 is intricately linked to the orbital-selective response of the t2g and eg states. Additionally, angular-dependent photo-ionization cross-section analysis provides a consistent description of the polarization dependence observed in HAXPES. Finally, configuration-interaction analysis of the Co 2p core-level spectra reveals that LaCoO3 evolves from a predominantly low-spin ground state at low temperature to a mixed low-spin/high-spin configuration at elevated temperatures, with the high-spin fraction reaching about 30 percent at 400 K.

Typically, the functional (e.g., optoelectronic) properties of hybrid halides are derived from the inorganic structural part, whereas the organic structural units can add extra advantages in terms of stability, rigidity, and processability. Here, we report the design, synthesis, and characterization of two new hybrid materials in which the outstanding photophysical properties originate from the organic structural part. The new compounds, (C15H16N)2CdCl4 and ((Br)C15H15N)2CdCl4, have 2D layered Ruddlesden-Poppertype perovskite structures. These hybrids are blue-white light emitters just like their corresponding pure organic salts, but with much improved emission efficiencies. Optical spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) studies confirm that photoemission comes from the trans-stilbene organic cations. The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) values of these new materials are among the highest known, 50.83 % and 26.60 % for (C15H16N)2CdCl4 and ((Br)C15H15N)2CdCl4, respectively. This is up to a 5-fold increase as compared to the light emission efficiency of the precursor salt C15H16NCl (PLQY of 10.33 %).

Scandium nitride (ScN) is particularly sensitive to irradiation-induced disorder, with transport properties spanning several orders of magnitude and multiple conduction mechanisms involved. In this study, we investigate the evolution of electrical transport in epitaxial ScN thin films undergoing accumulated irradiation damage at an initial defect state. A phenomenological damage-accumulation model was successfully combined with temperature dependent resistivity and Hall effect measurements to elucidate the impact of defect buildup on electrical transport and to provide physically grounded, quantitative insight into the nature and accumulation of irradiation-induced defects. It reveals two distinct defects-generation regimes of electrically active defects. At low doses, direct-impact damage produces stable and isolated acceptor-type complex defects, (VSc-X) with VSc a scandium vacancy and X denoting residual impurities, leading to a gradual increase in resistivity. At higher doses, defect accumulation dominates through a multi-hit process, giving rise to point-defect buildup and carrier localization, resulting in hopping-dominated transport. This localized regime is thermally unstable and recovers upon low-temperature annealing. We further demonstrate that the residual defect landscape strongly influences both the critical dose for the metal-insulator transition and the localization strength: films grown on Al2O3 exhibit an earlier transition and weaker localization than those grown on MgO. These results highlight ion implantation as an effective route for engineering disorder-induced localization in ScN, with the initial film quality playing a decisive role."}

By analyzing thermodynamic uncertainty relations, we demonstrate that violations of the quantum bound present in the noninteracting regime are progressively reduced and eventually suppressed as interactions increase, whereas the recently proposed hybrid bound remains satisfied. Our results clarify how Coulomb interactions, and nonequilibrium fluctuations jointly determine transport properties in hybrid superconducting devices, and establish current precision as a robust benchmark for interacting Andreev transport beyond the noninteracting limit."}

Two equilibrium states in such a film are separated by a potential barrier that might be overpassed if the femtosecond pulse fluence exceeds a threshold value, so that magnetization is reversed after the pulse action. The switching threshold depends strongly on the value of applied in-plane external magnetic field, and is different for the two initial magnetization states and two opposite optical pulse helicites. This makes it possible to perform optomagnonic non-thermal deterministic writing of a magnetic bit. Such switching mechanism can be used for realizing reconfigurable optomagnonic logic elements without thermal assistance. Logical operations are implemented by encoding inputs in the amplitude and helicity of the optical pulses, while outputs are written as the magnetization state. The study demonstrates a pathway towards heating-free optomagnonic logic and memory devices."}

Our first-principles calculations reveal that its cubic phase (Fm$\\bar{3}$m) is dynamically unstable. Using an accelerated machine learning approach, we identify 42 dynamically stable structures and further validate these findings using first principles calculations on 11 of these. The most stable phase has Cmc$2_1$ symmetry with 20 atoms/unit cell. It lies 41.9 meV/atom below the cubic reference but lacks octahedral cation coordination. The most stable perovskite-like structure has P$\\bar{3}$ symmetry with 10 atoms/unit cell and low octahedral connectivity. Structure-property trade-offs are highlighted, with calculated distortions generally widening the band gap, shifting it from direct to indirect, and flattening the band edges. This work showcases the synergy of genetic algorithms, machine-learned potentials, and first-principles validation for discovering stable, complex materials."}

However, the canonical Majorana platform based on $2e$ TSCs remains computationally constrained. In this work, we find a $4e$ TSC that overcomes these constraints by combining a charge-$4e$ condensate with an Abelian chiral $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ topological order in an intertwined fashion. Remarkably, this $4e$ TSC can be obtained by proliferating vortex-antivortex pairs in a stack of two $2e$ $p+ip$ TSCs, or by melting a $ν=2/3$ quantum Hall state. Specific to this TSC, the $hc/(4e)$ fluxes act as charge-conjugation defects in the topological order, whose braiding with anyons transmutes anyons into their antiparticles. This symmetry enrichment leads to $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ parafermion zero modes trapped in the elementary vortex cores, which naturally encode qutrits. Braiding the parafermion defects alone generates the full many-qutrit Clifford group. We further show that a simple single-probe interferometric measurement enables topologically protected magic-state preparation, promoting Clifford operations to a universal gate set. Importantly, the non-Abelian excitations in the $4e$ TSC are confined to externally controlled defects, making them uniquely identifiable and amenable to controlled creation and motion with superconducting-circuit technology. Our results establish hierarchical electron aggregation as a complementary principle for engineering topological quantum matter with enhanced computational power."}
