In particular, far-field HEDM measures the deformation response of upwards of thousands of individual grains simultaneously in situ during mechanical loading, though measurements are primarily limited, however, to the average state of each grain -- i.e., the grain's full strain tensor, crystallographic orientation, spatial location and volume. CPFE is utilized to shed information on the intragrain deformation response, via the sub-discretization of each grain into many finite elements, though the direct point of comparison to HEDM remains the grain-averaged response. We thus seek to find the minimum simulation conditions necessary to provide consistent grain-averaged predictions in an attempt to limit computational cost. In this study, we perform a suite of simulations and systematically study the effects of mesh density and boundary conditions, and consider different materials. We discuss these results and show that accurate prediction of grain-averaged elastic strains in a given region of interest typically requires a mesh with 250 elements per grain on average and a buffer layer of at least three grains between the region of interest and the control surfaces."}

CD spectroscopy has been a key technique to understand chiral perovskites and how these semiconductors achieve chirality at the molecular level. However, there is a debate on whether the observed CD is intrinsic to the chiral crystal structures or is modulated by extrinsic phenomena particularly linear dichroism (LD) and linear birefringence (LB) effects. This work investigates the chiroptical properties of $(R-/S-\\text{MBA})_2\\mathrm{CuCl}_4$ (MBA = Methylbenzyl ammonium) series by thoroughly studying the contribution from LD and LB to the observed CD signals. The comparison of highly oriented and randomly oriented films exhibits notable LD and LB contributions to the observed CD, which are caused by orientation-dependent electric-field interactions and local anisotropy. Both randomly and highly oriented films exhibit distinct CD responses, with LD--LB effects largely dominating the CD in highly oriented films. This has been revealed by the obvious shift in the observed CD signals to the below-absorption-edge ($\\sim 430$ nm) regime and broadening of features. Our findings demonstrate that careful consideration of crystal orientation and structural effects is necessary for appropriate interpretation of CD spectra in chiral perovskite thin films."}

Clayton"], "title": "Constitutive theory for mechanics of amorphous thermoplastic polymers under extreme dynamic loading", "comment": "66 pages, 9 figures", "summary": "A geometrically nonlinear continuum mechanical theory is formulated for deformation and failure behaviors of amorphous polymers. The model seeks to capture material response over a range of loading rates, temperatures, and stress states encompassing shock compression, inelasticity, melting, decomposition, and spallation. Thermoelasticity, viscoelasticity, viscoplasticity, ductile failure with localized shear yielding, and brittle fracture with crazing can all emerge under this ensemble of intense loading conditions. Known prior theories have considered one or more, but not all, such physical mechanisms. The present coherent formulation invokes thermodynamics with internal state variables for dynamic molecular and network configurational changes affecting viscoelasticity and plastic deformation, and it uses order parameters for more abrupt structural changes across state-dependent glass-transition and shock-decomposition thresholds. A phase-field order parameter captures material degradation from ductile or brittle fracture, including evolving porosity from crazing. The theory is applied toward polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) under intense dynamic loading. The high-pressure equilibrium response, with shear strength and temperature over known ranges, is well represented along the principal Hugoniot to pressures far exceeding shock decomposition. Predicted release wave velocities agree with experiment. A semi-analytical solution for steady waves describes the relatively lower-pressure viscoelastic setting, providing insight into relaxation times. One-dimensional calculations assess suitability of the model for representing spall fracture strengths seen in experiments over a range of initial temperatures and loading rates."}

Remarkably, we observe a consistent emergent behavior: when optimized solely for task success, models spontaneously internalize reasoning, progressively abandoning verbose textual derivations in favor of implicit latent computation.

Here, we report a systematic investigation of PrFeAsO1-xFx over the full nominal fluorine-doping range 0 to 1 and construct the first comprehensive electronic phase diagram for this system. The evolution from the nonsuperconducting parent compound to the fluorine-rich limit reveals a broad dome shaped superconducting region. Structural refinement demonstrates a systematic lattice contraction with increasing fluorine content (x), corroborated by Raman spectroscopy through softening of the Pr(A1g) phonon mode and hardening of the Fe(B1g) mode, confirming effective fluorine incorporation at the oxygen sites. The maximum superconducting transition temperature (Tc) reaches up to 52.3 K, approximately 5 K higher than previous reports for Pr1111. Magnetotransport measurements yield large upper critical fields Hc2(0) exceeding 100 T, while analysis of resistive transition broadening reveals thermally activated flux flow with a crossover from single-vortex to collective pinning regimes. Specific-heat measurements exhibit a reduced jump deltaC/γTc < 1.43, reflecting strong superconducting fluctuations and multiband pairing.

Thermal properties of MOFs, such as their heat capacity, are used to determine the energy penalty associated with the adsorbent retrieval during the Temperature Swing Adsorption process. To aid exploration of the vast experimental design space of MOFs for such applications, computational methods like Density Functional Theory (DFT) or surrogate machine learning models trained on DFT data have been developed for obtaining phonon-derived heat capacities of MOFs. However, the high cost of explicit phonon computation in large and flexible nanoporous MOFs often necessitates the use of small supercells or lower convergence criteria which decrease predictive accuracy. These approximations often result in spurious imaginary phonon modes which are commonly ignored in practice. At present, there is no clear consensus in the literature on what magnitude of negative frequency or what fraction of imaginary modes can be considered acceptable. Here, we systematically demonstrate that spurious imaginary phonon modes can introduce substantial errors in heat capacity estimates, leading to incorrect ranking of MOFs in thermal-property-based screening. We further show that benchmarking machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) against DFT datasets containing spurious imaginary modes can misrepresent models that predict physically meaningful phonon spectra for dynamically stable MOFs. Finally, we introduce a simple, rapid post-processing workflow that can be applied to standard phonon calculations to effectively correct heat capacity estimates and account for spurious imaginary modes in MOFs."}

In this perspective, we examine whether quantum confinement alone, or in combination with proximity effects, can induce an observable superconducting instability in metals that are non-superconducting in bulk form. We review recent theoretical progress and present a unified framework based on a confinement-generalized, isotropic one-band Eliashberg theory, in which the normal density of states becomes energy dependent and key material parameters ($E_F$, $λ$, and $μ^{*}$) acquire an explicit thickness dependence. By numerically solving the resulting Eliashberg equations using ab-initio or experimentally determined electron--phonon spectral functions $α^{2}F(Ω)$ and Coulomb pseudopotentials $μ^{*}$, and without introducing adjustable parameters, we compute the critical temperature $T_c$ as a function of film thickness for representative noble, alkali, and alkaline-earth metals. The theory predicts that superconductivity can emerge only in selected cases and within extremely narrow thickness windows, typically centered around sub-nanometer scales ($L \\sim 0.4$--$0.6$~nm). We further discuss layered superconductor/normal-metal systems, where quantum confinement and proximity effects coexist.

We determine this zero-field offset and the Rashba parameters that dictate the spin splitting in the linear regime. Surprisingly, the splitting is substantially smaller in bilayers than in monolayers at typical fields. This is clarified within a perturbative microscopic model, revealing that the spin splitting results from a competition between internal polarization and interlayer hybridization.

While Kohn-Sham eigenvalue differences underestimate gaps, EDFT has been shown to provide more accurate excitation energies in atoms, molecules and isolated model systems. However, it is unclear whether EDFT is capable of calculating band gaps of periodic systems -- and what an appropriate theoretical formulation would be to describe periodic systems. We explored how EDFT could calculate band gaps by estimating the thermodynamic limit with increasingly wide finite versions of the one-dimensional Kronig-Penney (KP) periodic model. We use Octopus, an ab initio, open-source, real-space DFT code, as in our previous work [R. J. Leano et al., Electron. Struct. 6, 035003 (2024)] in which we found with \"particle in a box\" models that EDFT can provide a reasonable effective mass correction for the homogeneous electron gas. Now, we use a periodic reference that is gapped. We find that the finite systems' Kohn-Sham gap approaches the same periodic limit for each of three ways of terminating the finite system, though the appropriate states corresponding to the valence band maximum and conduction band minimum have to be carefully identified in each case. Finally, our EDFT results, using a simple ensemblized LDA approximation, have a reasonable nonzero correction to the bandgap in the periodic limit.

By abandoning the restrictive condition of detailed balance in favor of the more fundamental principle of global balance, they introduced the Event-Chain Monte Carlo (ECMC) algorithm, which achieves rejection-free, deterministic sampling for hard spheres. This breakthrough demonstrated that persistent, directional dynamics could dramatically accelerate equilibration in dense particle systems. In this commentary, we review this foundational work and elucidate its underlying mechanism using the broader Event-Driven Monte Carlo (EDMC) framework developed in subsequent years.

However, unlike computer vision tasks where visual fidelity suffices, physical systems require the rigorous reproduction of higher-order statistical moments and thermodynamic quantities. While Score-Based Generative Models (SGMs) have emerged as a powerful tool, their standard formulation on Euclidean embedding space is ill-suited for continuous spin systems, where variables inherently reside on a manifold. In this work, we demonstrate that training on the Euclidean space compromises the model's ability to learn the target distribution as it prioritizes to learn the manifold constraints. We address this limitation by proposing the use of Manifold-Aware Score-Based Generative Modeling framework applied to the 64x64 2D XY model (a 4096-dimensional torus). We show that our method estimates the theoretical Boltzmann score with superior precision compared to standard diffusion models. Consequently, we successfully capture the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz Thouless (BKT) phase transition and accurately reproduce second-moment quantities, such as heat capacity without explicit feature engineering. Furthermore, we demonstrate zero-shot generalization to unseen lattice sizes, accurately recovering the physics of variable system scales without retraining. Since this approach bypasses domain-specific feature engineering, it remains intrinsically generalizable to other continuous spin systems."}

We determine this zero-field offset and the Rashba parameters that dictate the spin splitting in the linear regime.

While the aluminum Josephson junction is of utmost importance, maintaining quantum coherence across the entire device means that pair-breaking in Nb leads, capacitive pads, and readout resonators can be a major source of decoherence. The established contributors are surface oxides and hydroxides, as well as absorbed hydrogen and oxygen. Metal encapsulation of freshly grown surfaces with non-oxidizing metals, preferably without breaking the vacuum, is a successful strategy to mitigate these issues. While the positive effects of encapsulation are undeniable, it is important to understand its impact on the macroscopic behavior of niobium films. We present a comprehensive study of the bulk superconducting properties of Nb thin films encapsulated with gold and palladium/gold, and compare them to those of bare Nb films. Magneto-optical imaging, magnetization, resistivity, and London and Campbell penetration depth measurements reveal significant differences in encapsulated samples. Both sputtered, and epitaxial Au-capped films exhibit the highest residual resistivity ratio and superconducting transition temperature, as well as the lowest upper critical field, London penetration depth, and critical current. These results are in good agreement with the microscopic theory of anisotropic normal and superconducting states of Nb. We conclude that pair-breaking in the bulk of niobium films, driven by disorder throughout the film rather than just at the surface, is a significant source of quantum decoherence in transmons. We also conclude that gold capping not only passivates the surface but also affects the properties of the entire film, significantly reducing the scattering rate due to defects likely induced by surface diffusion if the film is not protected immediately after fabrication."}

In particular, far-field HEDM measures the deformation response of upwards of thousands of individual grains simultaneously in situ during mechanical loading, though measurements are primarily limited, however, to the average state of each grain -- i.e., the grain's full strain tensor, crystallographic orientation, spatial location and volume. CPFE is utilized to shed information on the intragrain deformation response, via the sub-discretization of each grain into many finite elements, though the direct point of comparison to HEDM remains the grain-averaged response. We thus seek to find the minimum simulation conditions necessary to provide consistent grain-averaged predictions in an attempt to limit computational cost. In this study, we perform a suite of simulations and systematically study the effects of mesh density and boundary conditions, and consider different materials.

In strike contrast with respect to other orientations, these properties are not of extrinsic origin but arise from the interplay of structural order, strain and quantum confinement. The bandgap is shown to be either direct and indirect, depending on the precise composition, which can be explained in terms of the geometrical properties of (111)-oriented bilayers of LaMnO$_3$. The electronic structure shows narrow bands indicating localized $e_g$ states for all the investigated superlattices. These features and the analysis of the inter-atomic magnetic coupling suggest that the investigated superlattices behave as a Kugel-Khomskii material, at least for the explored compositions.

However, it is often unclear whether the probe is responding to the local electric field or other types of intermolecular interactions, inhibiting interpretation of the frequency and effectiveness as probes. This is especially true of molecules whose vibrational frequencies blueshift instead of the more typical redshift in hydrogen bonding configurations. Here we computationally investigate the causes of redshifting versus blueshifting over a range of vibrational reporters. First, we apply adiabatic energy decomposition analysis to a paradigmatic set of probes, finding that redshifting only occurs when electrostatic interactions are strong enough to overcome the dominant and large blueshifting contribution of Pauli repulsion. Furthermore, we demonstrate that field inhomogeneity can further shift the frequency of many probes substantially to either reinforce or counteract the shift expected from a homogeneous field. We find that redshifting is reinforced by electric field inhomogeneity, otherwise field inhomogeneity further weakens the electrostatic contribution relative to Pauli repulsion, leading to blueshifting. Further calculations indicate that the probe's response to field inhomogeneity can be understood by considering the mass of the atoms involved in the stretching mode and sign of the electric field. In explaining the interplay of different intermolecular interactions and field inhomogeneity for many probes, our results should enable the use and interpretation of spectroscopic probes and their connection to electric fields in more complex systems."}

This distinctive feature arises from a competition between the magnetic field's suppression of AFM fluctuation-driven scattering and its suppression of superconducting fluctuations. We quantify these AFM fluctuations by a crossover field, B*, whose magnitude decreases with increasing temperature and vanishes near the superconducting onset-behavior contrasting sharply with that in high-Tc cuprates. Our results establish not merely coexistence, but also a direct and novel correlation between AFM instability and superconductivity in nickelates, offering crucial insight into their pairing mechanism."}

Here, based on the recently proposed incommensurate energy band (IEB) theory, we present a universal IQHE theory that does not rely on magnetic translation symmetry and is applicable to both rational and irrational magnetic fluxes. Using the square lattice as a paradigmatic example, we first show that the IEB framework provides a superior description of its energy spectrum in a magnetic field, as it explicitly reveals the momentum-space distribution of eigenstates. Key to our IQHE theory is that each gap in the IEB spectrum is intrinsically labeled by an integer pair (m,g), defined by the corresponding Bragg planes. When the Fermi energy lies within such a gap, the occupied electron states $N_{\\text{occ}}$ is determined by the k-space volume enclosed by these Bragg planes, leading to the fundamental relation $N_{\\text{occ}}/N_0 = m(φ/φ_0) + g$. Through Středa formula, this leads directly to the quantized Hall conductance $σ_{xy} = m e^2/h$ under arbitrary magnetic fields. Our work resolves the long-standing problem of IQHE under irrational flux, and establishes a new paradigm for IQHE."}

CD spectroscopy has been a key technique to understand chiral perovskites and how these semiconductors achieve chirality at the molecular level. However, there is a debate on whether the observed CD is intrinsic to the chiral crystal structures or is modulated by extrinsic phenomena particularly linear dichroism (LD) and linear birefringence (LB) effects. This work investigates the chiroptical properties of $(R-/S-\\text{MBA})_2\\mathrm{CuCl}_4$ (MBA = Methylbenzyl ammonium) series by thoroughly studying the contribution from LD and LB to the observed CD signals. The comparison of highly oriented and randomly oriented films exhibits notable LD and LB contributions to the observed CD, which are caused by orientation-dependent electric-field interactions and local anisotropy. Both randomly and highly oriented films exhibit distinct CD responses, with LD--LB effects largely dominating the CD in highly oriented films. This has been revealed by the obvious shift in the observed CD signals to the below-absorption-edge ($\\sim 430$ nm) regime and broadening of features. Our findings demonstrate that careful consideration of crystal orientation and structural effects is necessary for appropriate interpretation of CD spectra in chiral perovskite thin films."}

The code supports crystal anisotropy by precomputing rotated stiffness tensors from user-specified orientations and solves the equilibrium problem with a matrix-free, OpenMP-parallel preconditioned conjugate-gradient (PCG) method using a point-block Jacobi preconditioner. On a single shared-memory multicore PC, OpenMP threading accelerates the baseline CG solver by ~10X, while the block-preconditioned CG solver achieves 53-61X speedup relative to the serial CG baseline for meshes from 100^3 to 500^3 voxels (scaling to domains up to 800^3 voxels). Accuracy is validated against the analytical Eshelby inclusion solution. ELAS3D-Xtal also integrates microstructure construction, including statistically calibrated polycrystal generation via spatial filtering and parallel voxel-to-grain assignment, direct pore insertion from XCT centroid/radius data, and texture assignment. Full-field phase, orientation, and stress outputs are written in HDF5 to enable scalable post-processing and defect-mechanics workflows. Applications are demonstrated for (i) anisotropy-controlled defect-scale stress fields and (ii) LPBF SS316L microstructures with gas, lack-of-fusion, and keyhole pore morphologies."}

Streltsov and D. I. Khomskii, Phys. Rev. X 10, 031043 (2020)]. While the structural transitions in K$_2$ReCl$_6$ are understood in terms of octahedral rotation and tilting, the possible impact of a Jahn-Teller distortion remains an open issue. We report on comprehensive crystalstructure studies by means of powder neutron and single-crystal x-ray diffraction on K$_2$ReCl$_6$ and on K$_2$SnCl$_6$. The latter material is used as a reference, because it exhibits the same sequence of structural transitions as K$_2$ReCl$_6$, but possesses a filled 4d shell ruling out a Jahn-Teller distortion. While the ReCl$_6$ octahedron in K$_2$ReCl$_6$ presents sizable distortions at intermediate temperatures, there is no such distortion persisting to low temperatures excluding a sizable Jahn-Teller effect.

In this paper, the formulation and implementation of a model for Intramembranous Ossification is presented aiming to describe the complex process of bone tissue formation in tooth extraction sites. The model consists in a mathematical description of the mechanisms in which different types of cells interact, synthesize and degrade extra-cellular matrices under the influence of biochemical factors.

Clayton"], "title": "Constitutive theory for mechanics of amorphous thermoplastic polymers under extreme dynamic loading", "comment": "66 pages, 9 figures", "summary": "A geometrically nonlinear continuum mechanical theory is formulated for deformation and failure behaviors of amorphous polymers. The model seeks to capture material response over a range of loading rates, temperatures, and stress states encompassing shock compression, inelasticity, melting, decomposition, and spallation. Thermoelasticity, viscoelasticity, viscoplasticity, ductile failure with localized shear yielding, and brittle fracture with crazing can all emerge under this ensemble of intense loading conditions. Known prior theories have considered one or more, but not all, such physical mechanisms. The present coherent formulation invokes thermodynamics with internal state variables for dynamic molecular and network configurational changes affecting viscoelasticity and plastic deformation, and it uses order parameters for more abrupt structural changes across state-dependent glass-transition and shock-decomposition thresholds. A phase-field order parameter captures material degradation from ductile or brittle fracture, including evolving porosity from crazing. The theory is applied toward polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) under intense dynamic loading. The high-pressure equilibrium response, with shear strength and temperature over known ranges, is well represented along the principal Hugoniot to pressures far exceeding shock decomposition. Predicted release wave velocities agree with experiment. A semi-analytical solution for steady waves describes the relatively lower-pressure viscoelastic setting, providing insight into relaxation times. One-dimensional calculations assess suitability of the model for representing spall fracture strengths seen in experiments over a range of initial temperatures and loading rates."}

Achieving both high robustness and high efficiency is highly desirable but challenging for p-type transistors due to limited semiconductors with reliable hole transport and their high activation energies. Here, we achieved a robust yet efficient p-type transistor by heterogeneously integrating an ultra-wide-bandgap semiconductor and a high-k dielectric layer through van der Waals integration. The p-type transistor employs a two-dimensional hole channel on hydrogenated diamond (bandgap 5.6 eV) combined with a high-k (30.5) SrTiO3 perovskite membrane. At room temperature, the transistor exhibits stable operation with a high on-current (~200 mA/mm), low subthreshold swing (70 mV/dec), high hole mobility (566 cm^2/Vs to 572 cm^2/Vs) and high on-off ratio (~10^9).

Each star is built from edge-sharing triangles with an antiferromagnetic interaction on the shared side and ferromagnetic interactions on the others. At a critical coupling ratio, the ideal star model - defined by equal ferromagnetic interactions - exhibits a macroscopically degenerate ground state, which we map onto a site percolation problem on the Lieb lattice. This mapping enables the calculation of exponential ground-state degeneracy and the corresponding residual entropy for square, triangular, honeycomb, and cubic lattices. Remarkably, the residual entropy remains high for all studied lattices, exceeding 60\\% of the maximal value ln(2). Despite a gapless quadratic one-magnon spectrum, the low-temperature thermodynamics is governed by exponentially numerous gapped excitations. For a distorted-star variant of the model, the ground-state manifold is equivalent to that of decoupled ferromagnetic clusters, leading to exponential degeneracy with a lower, yet still substantial, residual entropy. At low temperature the system mimics a paramagnetic crystal of non-interacting spins with high spin value ($s=4$ for a square lattice). The obtained results establish a structural design principle for engineering quantum magnets with a high ground-state degeneracy, suggesting promising candidates for enhanced magnetocaloric cooling and quantum thermal machines."}

While this behavior has been linked to locally broken inversion symmetry, a phase diagram based on a multi-component superconducting order parameter remains a possibility. Furthermore, superconductivity appears to coexist with an ordered state (phase I). Despite being the subject of many studies, little is known about the nature of the order parameters in both superconducting phases and phase I.

In reduced-symmetry structures, such as twisted kagome systems involving rare earth elements, additional anisotropy can arise, enabling intriguing properties including spin-ice states, magnetocaloric effects, noncollinear magnetic ordering, and anomalous Hall effect. Here, we report the synthesis of single crystals of ErPdPb, which features a twisted kagome lattice net of Er atoms within the hexagonal ZrNiAl-type structure, and we investigate its magnetic, electronic, and thermal properties. The material exhibits antiferromagnetic ordering below 2.2 K, consistently observed in magnetic, transport, and heat capacity measurements. Magnetization measurements reveal 1/3 metamagnetic steps along the c-axis below the Néel temperature, suggesting an Ising-spin-like state on the twisted kagome lattice. A pronounced anisotropy between in-plane and out-of-plane resistivity is observed throughout the temperature range of 1.8-300 K, and the compound exhibits a significant frustration index of 13.6 (12.7) along the c-axis (ab-plane). Heat capacity measurements show a broad hump at 2.2 K, with an additional increase below 0.5 K. The anisotropic magnetic properties are further explored through density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which suggest strong easy-axis anisotropy, consistent with experimental magnetic measurements and crystal-field model expectations, and quasi-one-dimensional bands and a spin-split saddle point at the zone center."}

In this work, the influence of such radial asymmetry on QMF operation in the second stability zone is investigated through simulations. Using an existing potential formulation for a radially asymmetric QMF, the stability diagram in the second stability zone is extracted for the first time, revealing a systematic shift of the stability apex with the asymmetry parameter. Radial asymmetry introduces additional multipole components, notably an octupole term whose magnitude scales with the asymmetry parameter and whose sign depends on the DC polarity applied to the displaced rods. Transmission simulations show that the transmission peak shifts in accordance with the displaced stability apex, while the resolution exhibits a strong dependence on both the asymmetry parameter and the DC polarity. Comparable maximum resolution is obtained for inward and outward displacements under suitable polarity configurations, with outward displacement providing higher transmission efficiency due to an increased effective aperture. These results demonstrate that controlled radial asymmetry provides an effective means to tailor the resolution and transmission characteristics of QMFs operating in the second stability zone."}

We first derive formulas for linear response theory for time-dependent Markov chains and diffusions processes. We discuss existence, uniqueness, and differentiability of the pullback measure under general (not necessarily slow or periodic) perturbations of the transition kernels. An explicit Green-Kubo-type formula for the linear response is derived. We analyze in detail the case of periodic reference dynamics, where the unperturbed pullback attractor is periodic but the response is generally not. Our formulas reduce to those of classic linear response if one considers a reference autonomous state. Finally, we show that our results allow for extending the theory of optimal fingerprinting for detection and attribution of climate change (or change in any complex system) for the case of time-dependent background state and for the case where the optimal solution is sought for multiple time slices at the same time. We provide strong numerical support for the findings by applying our theory to a modified version of the Ghil-Sellers energy balance model where we include explicit time dependence in the reference state as a result of natural forcings. We verify the accuracy of response theory in predicting the impact of increases of $CO_2$ in the temperature field even when we discretize the system using Markov state modelling approach. Additionally, we consider a more complex modelling scenario where a localized aerosol forcing is also included in the system and show that the optimal fingerprinting method developed here is able to attribute the climate change signal to the acting forcings."}

However, how the spin of the triplet pairs responds to an external magnetic field remains poorly understood. This is mainly due to the absence of suitable spin-triplet superconductors. Here, we report results of Knight-shift and ac-susceptibility measurements on UTe$_2$. We demonstrate that the spin susceptibility, which slightly decreases compared to the normal-state value below the superconducting (SC) transition temperature $T_{\\rm c}$, is rapidly restored and nearly recovers to the normal-state values around 5 T, well below the SC upper critical field $H_{c2}$ when the magnetic field is applied along the $c$ axis ($H \\parallel c$). In addition, we found that $H_{\\rm c2}$ of superconductivity becomes larger when the SC spin aligns with the magnetic field. By considering the results on $H \\parallel b$, our results suggest the presence of a close relationship between the spin configuration of the triplet pair and $H_{\\rm c2}$, as well as the anisotropic pinning interaction acting on the triplet pairs. These phenomena, which have never been observed in spin-singlet superconductors, represent characteristic features unique to spin-triplet superconductors.

Thermal properties of MOFs, such as their heat capacity, are used to determine the energy penalty associated with the adsorbent retrieval during the Temperature Swing Adsorption process. To aid exploration of the vast experimental design space of MOFs for such applications, computational methods like Density Functional Theory (DFT) or surrogate machine learning models trained on DFT data have been developed for obtaining phonon-derived heat capacities of MOFs. However, the high cost of explicit phonon computation in large and flexible nanoporous MOFs often necessitates the use of small supercells or lower convergence criteria which decrease predictive accuracy. These approximations often result in spurious imaginary phonon modes which are commonly ignored in practice. At present, there is no clear consensus in the literature on what magnitude of negative frequency or what fraction of imaginary modes can be considered acceptable. Here, we systematically demonstrate that spurious imaginary phonon modes can introduce substantial errors in heat capacity estimates, leading to incorrect ranking of MOFs in thermal-property-based screening. We further show that benchmarking machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) against DFT datasets containing spurious imaginary modes can misrepresent models that predict physically meaningful phonon spectra for dynamically stable MOFs. Finally, we introduce a simple, rapid post-processing workflow that can be applied to standard phonon calculations to effectively correct heat capacity estimates and account for spurious imaginary modes in MOFs."}

Using a nonlinear phononics model, we numerically solve the coupled equations of motion governing the lattice dynamics and analyze the resulting time- and frequency-domain responses. By systematically varying key drive and material parameters-including electric field amplitude, pulse width, driving frequency, and mode damping-we identify the conditions under which stable phononic frequency combs emerge. Our results reveal clear threshold behaviors for comb formation, tunability of comb spacing and spectral bandwidth through external control parameters, and a breakdown of coherent comb structure at high drive strengths or weak damping.

As a natural extension of the conventional second-quantized Hamiltonian of interacting bosons, we explicitly construct a second-quantized Hamiltonian formulated in terms of a closed surface operator $\\hatφ[C_p^{}]$ charged under a $p$-form global symmetry. Applying the variational principle, we derive a functional Schrödinger equation analogous to the Gross-Pitaevskii equation in conventional bosonic systems. In the absence of external forces, the variational equation admits a uniform solution that is uniquely determined by a microscopic interaction potential $U(ψ^*ψ)$ and the chemical potential. This uniform solution describes a uniform gas of bosonic surfaces. Using the obtained energy functional, we show that low-energy fluctuations contain a gapless $p$-form field $A_p^{}$ when the $p$-form global symmetry is $\\mathrm{U}(1)$, whereas the $p$-form field becomes massive for discrete symmetries, whose low-energy limit is described by a $\\mathrm{BF}$-type topological field theory. As a consequence, the system exhibits abelian topological order with anyonic surface excitations.

We argue, however, that the problem reduces to solving the conventional Gross-Pitaevskii equation when external forces act separately on the center-of-mass and relative motions.

Depending on the coupling between the impurity and the superconductor, the system can have two distinct quantum ground states separated by a quantum phase transition (QPT). We investigate the interplay of two effects observed at the QPT. First, the tunneling supercurrent through the impurity reverses its sign at the QPT, denoted as a $π$-shift in the current-phase relation. Secondly, the local superconducting order parameter at the impurity site is suppressed and becomes negative at the QPT, generally termed a $π$-shift in the local superconducting order parameter. We find that both these effects are governed by the presence of the YSR state, however, they do not significantly depend or influence each other. In particular, we establish that the $π$-shift in the superconducting order parameter does not induce a $π$-shift in the tunneling Josephson current, nor can the Josephson current and its spatial behavior be used to directly probe the impurity-induced changes in the local superconducting order parameter, which occur on a length scale substantially shorter than the superconducting coherence length."}

However, current research is predominantly confined to single-Q topologies hosting uniform type of quasiparticle. The realization of exotic mixed-Q states, where distinct topological quasiparticles co-assemble into an ordered lattice, remains largely unexplored. Here, we propose a generic mechanism to order disordered mixed-Q topological magnetism into periodic lattice via moire engineering. By leveraging the synergy between spatially modulated interlayer coupling and intrinsic intralayer magnetic frustration, we demonstrate that moire potential can effectively regularize skyrmions, antiskyrmions, and magnetic bubbles into a hybrid lattice. Combining first-principles with atomistic spin simulations, we validate this mechanism in twisted bilayer CrGaTe3, identifying it as an exemplary platform for hosting these complex ordered textures. We systematically map the phase evolution as a function of twist angle and biaxial strain, unveiling the critical role of moire potential in stabilizing mixed-Q lattice. Our findings significantly advance the frontier of topological and moire spintronics."}

The results indicate that all defects considered, except for OC, possess neutral or negative charge states, thereby making them suitable for detection by positron annihilation spectroscopy (PAS). Furthermore, the electron and positron density distributions and positron annihilation lifetimes for the perfect 3C-SiC supercell and various defective configurations are computed. It is found that the OSi and OSiVC complexes act as effective positron trapping centers, leading to the formation of positron trapped states and a notable increase in annihilation lifetimes at the corresponding defect sites. In addition, coincidence Doppler broadening (CDB) spectra, along with the S and W parameters, are calculated for both intrinsic and oxygen-doped point defects (OC, OSi, OCVSi, and OSiVC). The analysis reveals that electron screening effects dominate the annihilation characteristics of the OSi defect, whereas positron localization induced by the vacancy is the predominant contributor in the case of OSiVC. This distinction results in clearly different momentum distributions of these two oxygen-related defects for different charge states. Overall, the PAS is demonstrated to be a powerful technique for distinguishing intrinsic vacancy-type defects and oxygen-doped composites in 3C-SiC. Combining the analysis of electron and positron density distributions, the electron localization and positron trapping behavior in defect systems with different charge states can be comprehensively understood. These first-principles results provide a solid theoretical foundation for identifying and characterizing the defects in oxygen-doped 3C-SiC by using PAS."}

CeRh$_2$As$_2$ has recently emerged as one of the few existing multi-phase superconductors. It exhibits a first-order phase transition between two distinct superconducting states when a magnetic field is applied along the crystallographic $c$-axis. While this behavior has been linked to locally broken inversion symmetry, a phase diagram based on a multi-component superconducting order parameter remains a possibility. Furthermore, superconductivity appears to coexist with an ordered state (phase I). Despite being the subject of many studies, little is known about the nature of the order parameters in both superconducting phases and phase I. Here, we use ultrasound-propagation measurements at low temperatures, in high magnetic fields and under hydrostatic pressure to address this issue. Our results strongly suggest that the superconducting order parameter in both phases is single-component, corroborating the role of local non-centrosymmetry in the development of multi-phase superconductivity in CeRh$_2$As$_2$. In addition, analysis of the elastic anomalies within the Landau framework of phase transitions strongly suggests the presence of an incommensurate magnetic order parameter in phase I."}

While Kohn-Sham eigenvalue differences underestimate gaps, EDFT has been shown to provide more accurate excitation energies in atoms, molecules and isolated model systems. However, it is unclear whether EDFT is capable of calculating band gaps of periodic systems -- and what an appropriate theoretical formulation would be to describe periodic systems. We explored how EDFT could calculate band gaps by estimating the thermodynamic limit with increasingly wide finite versions of the one-dimensional Kronig-Penney (KP) periodic model. We use Octopus, an ab initio, open-source, real-space DFT code, as in our previous work [R. J. Leano et al., Electron. Struct. 6, 035003 (2024)] in which we found with \"particle in a box\" models that EDFT can provide a reasonable effective mass correction for the homogeneous electron gas. Now, we use a periodic reference that is gapped. We find that the finite systems' Kohn-Sham gap approaches the same periodic limit for each of three ways of terminating the finite system, though the appropriate states corresponding to the valence band maximum and conduction band minimum have to be carefully identified in each case. Finally, our EDFT results, using a simple ensemblized LDA approximation, have a reasonable nonzero correction to the bandgap in the periodic limit. The results indicate that EDFT is promising for periodic systems, to motivate further work on developing a suitable formalism."}

Rotational invariance reduces the problem to the stationary single-coordinate marginal $p_X(x)$, from which the radial distribution $p_R(r)$ and the full joint stationary density follow by explicit integral transforms. We first focus on a generalized trapped RTP in one dimension, where post-tumble velocities are drawn from an arbitrary distribution $W(v)$. Using a Kesten-type recursion, we represent its stationary position in terms of a stick-breaking (or Dirichlet) process, yielding closed-form expressions for its distribution and its moments. Specializing $W(v)$ to the projected velocity law of an isotropic RTP, we reconstruct $p_R(r)$ and the full joint distribution of all the coordinates in $d=1,2,3$. In $d=1$ and $d=2$, the radial law simplifies to a beta distribution, while in $d=3$, we derive closed-form expressions for $p_R(r)$ and the stationary joint distribution $P(x,y,z)$, which differ from a beta distribution. In all cases, we characterize a persistence-controlled shape transition at the turning surface $r=v_0/μ$, where $v_0$ is the self-propulsion speed. We further include thermal noise characterized by a diffusion coefficient $D>0$, showing that the stationary law is a Gaussian convolution of the $D=0$ result, which regularizes turning-point singularities and controls the crossover between persistence- and diffusion-dominated regimes as $D \\to 0$ and $D \\to \\infty$ respectively.

This concept is essential in magnonics, a subfield of spintronics that leverages spin waves for processing and transmitting information. Compared to conventional electronics, magnonics offers lower power consumption and faster operation, making it a promising technology for future devices. Magnons can be confined using both static and dynamic methods, often relying on potential wells and barriers to restrict their free propagation and trap them in designated locations. In this review, we will explore the main strategies for magnon confinement and trapping, including: magnetic field inhomogeneities, spin textures (i.e. domain walls, vortices, skyrmions) nanostructured materials (i.e. nanowires, disks, and magnonic crystals), topological states, chiral magnons and flat band formation, induced by dipole-dipole interactions and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Microwave cavities and resonant magnetic fields, as well as spin-torque effects and Bose-Einstein condensation contribute to magnon localization. Furthermore, spin-wave edge and cavity modes have been observed in two-dimensional magnetic materials and twisted moiré superlattices at a specific twist angle. Magnon trapping has broad applications in computing and data processing, particularly in the development of magnonic crystals, waveguides, and memory elements. Additionally, magnon systems are being explored for quantum computing, where confinement can enhance the coupling between magnons and other quasiparticles in hybrid quantum systems. Precision control of magnons could lead to next-generation spintronic devices, offering improved efficiency and scalability."}

The generated configurations are projected onto the nearest-neighbor energy manifold, ensuring thermodynamic consistency while retaining universal critical properties. We show that the resulting configurations reproduce scale-invariant spin correlations, Binder cumulants, and isotropic structure factors for lattice sizes exceeding 10,000, without iterative Monte Carlo equilibration.

Two new structures, $P4/nmm$-MgTiH$_6$ and $Pmm2$-Mg$_3$TiH$_6$, are identified to be thermodynamically stable at both 200 GPa and 300 GPa.

The code supports crystal anisotropy by precomputing rotated stiffness tensors from user-specified orientations and solves the equilibrium problem with a matrix-free, OpenMP-parallel preconditioned conjugate-gradient (PCG) method using a point-block Jacobi preconditioner. On a single shared-memory multicore PC, OpenMP threading accelerates the baseline CG solver by ~10X, while the block-preconditioned CG solver achieves 53-61X speedup relative to the serial CG baseline for meshes from 100^3 to 500^3 voxels (scaling to domains up to 800^3 voxels). Accuracy is validated against the analytical Eshelby inclusion solution. ELAS3D-Xtal also integrates microstructure construction, including statistically calibrated polycrystal generation via spatial filtering and parallel voxel-to-grain assignment, direct pore insertion from XCT centroid/radius data, and texture assignment. Full-field phase, orientation, and stress outputs are written in HDF5 to enable scalable post-processing and defect-mechanics workflows. Applications are demonstrated for (i) anisotropy-controlled defect-scale stress fields and (ii) LPBF SS316L microstructures with gas, lack-of-fusion, and keyhole pore morphologies."}

Methods such as combinatorial spread libraries and printed libraries sample a defined low-D manifold in the chemical space of the system. Here, we introduce a time-aware framework for comparing sequential and manifold BO under experimentally realistic constraints. By explicitly modeling synthesis and characterization times, we define an effective experimental time metric that enables fair, time-normalized benchmarking of optimization strategies. Using numerical experiments in ternary and quaternary compositional spaces, we show that sequential BO remains optimal for short-term experiments or when batching provides no effective time advantage, whereas manifold BO becomes favorable once multiplexed synthesis enables faster accumulation of measurements. We identify a small set of physically interpretable parameters that govern the transition between these regimes. These results establish a general, experimentally grounded framework for selecting optimization strategies in self-driving laboratories and autonomous materials discovery workflows.

From density-functional calculations, we extract the dominant intralayer exchange couplings up to third-nearest neighbors and the leading interlayer exchanges up to second-nearest neighbors, enabling construction of an effective bilayer spin Hamiltonian. We first analyze interface-driven proximity effects within a ferromagnetic reference configuration, demonstrating how recovery of AB-type stacking and spin alignment--while varying only the transition-metal species--provides a route for selectively tuning magnetic order and symmetry breaking within the P$\\bar{6}$m2 space group. Building on this microscopic understanding of the bonding environment, we then examine antiferromagnetic ordering tendencies in the coupled layers. Exact diagonalization of the resulting bilayer Hamiltonian reveals the magnetic ground state and low-lying excitation spectrum, showing that the interlayer exchange is not merely perturbative but competes directly with intralayer interactions in stabilizing the observed spin configurations. These results establish Bernal-stacked MA$_2$Z$_4$ bilayers as a platform in which stacking geometry and exchange hierarchy jointly govern magnetic reconstruction, offering a controlled pathway toward domain selection and spin-texture engineering in low-dimensional van der Waals materials."}

We present dewi-kadita, an open-source Python library implementing the three-dimensional Couzin zone-based model with comprehensive entropy diagnostics tailored for marine collective behavior research. The library introduces seven information-theoretic metrics -- school cohesion entropy, polarization entropy, depth stratification entropy, angular momentum entropy, nearest-neighbor entropy, velocity correlation entropy, and school shape entropy -- that characterize distinct organizational features inaccessible to classical order parameters. These metrics combine into an Oceanic Schooling Index (OSI) providing a single scalar measure of collective disorder. Validation across four canonical configurations (swarm, torus, dynamic parallel, highly parallel) confirms correct reproduction of known phase behaviors: the swarm maintains disorder with polarization $P < 0.1$ and OSI $\\approx 0.71$, while the highly parallel state achieves $P = 0.998$ with OSI $= 0.24$ and velocity correlation entropy vanishing to zero. The entropy framework successfully discriminates the torus and dynamic parallel configurations that exhibit comparable order parameter magnitudes through different organizational mechanisms. Numba just-in-time (JIT) compilation accelerates pairwise interaction calculations by $10$--$100\\times$, enabling simulations of $150$--$250$ agents over $1000$--$2000$ time steps within five minutes on standard workstation hardware.

Thermal properties of MOFs, such as their heat capacity, are used to determine the energy penalty associated with the adsorbent retrieval during the Temperature Swing Adsorption process. To aid exploration of the vast experimental design space of MOFs for such applications, computational methods like Density Functional Theory (DFT) or surrogate machine learning models trained on DFT data have been developed for obtaining phonon-derived heat capacities of MOFs. However, the high cost of explicit phonon computation in large and flexible nanoporous MOFs often necessitates the use of small supercells or lower convergence criteria which decrease predictive accuracy. These approximations often result in spurious imaginary phonon modes which are commonly ignored in practice. At present, there is no clear consensus in the literature on what magnitude of negative frequency or what fraction of imaginary modes can be considered acceptable. Here, we systematically demonstrate that spurious imaginary phonon modes can introduce substantial errors in heat capacity estimates, leading to incorrect ranking of MOFs in thermal-property-based screening. We further show that benchmarking machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) against DFT datasets containing spurious imaginary modes can misrepresent models that predict physically meaningful phonon spectra for dynamically stable MOFs. Finally, we introduce a simple, rapid post-processing workflow that can be applied to standard phonon calculations to effectively correct heat capacity estimates and account for spurious imaginary modes in MOFs."}

The method of physical modeling with low-temperature metallic alloys (Wood and Rose) and transparent organic media (salol, camphene, diphenylamine) was used. It was established that vibration and ultrasound significantly reduce the supercooling required to initiate crystallization. The effectiveness of the influence significantly increases for samples with solid substrates. The hypotheses about the influence through changes in melt viscosity and the exclusive role of cavitation were experimentally refuted. The transition from pre-cavitation to cavitation ultrasound regime is not accompanied by qualitative changes in the influence on nucleation. The mechanism of elastic oscillation influence is substantiated, which consists in mechanical impact on adsorbed crystal nuclei on the surfaces of solid substrates. Elastic oscillations increase the nucleation rate by creating growth steps (dislocations) on the surfaces of adsorbed nuclei as a result of mechanical friction of solid substrates and cavitation erosion. The results have fundamental significance for understanding the physical nature of metal crystallization and practical application for developing technologies for controlling structure formation."}

Each star is built from edge-sharing triangles with an antiferromagnetic interaction on the shared side and ferromagnetic interactions on the others. At a critical coupling ratio, the ideal star model - defined by equal ferromagnetic interactions - exhibits a macroscopically degenerate ground state, which we map onto a site percolation problem on the Lieb lattice. This mapping enables the calculation of exponential ground-state degeneracy and the corresponding residual entropy for square, triangular, honeycomb, and cubic lattices. Remarkably, the residual entropy remains high for all studied lattices, exceeding 60\\% of the maximal value ln(2). Despite a gapless quadratic one-magnon spectrum, the low-temperature thermodynamics is governed by exponentially numerous gapped excitations. For a distorted-star variant of the model, the ground-state manifold is equivalent to that of decoupled ferromagnetic clusters, leading to exponential degeneracy with a lower, yet still substantial, residual entropy. At low temperature the system mimics a paramagnetic crystal of non-interacting spins with high spin value ($s=4$ for a square lattice). The obtained results establish a structural design principle for engineering quantum magnets with a high ground-state degeneracy, suggesting promising candidates for enhanced magnetocaloric cooling and quantum thermal machines."}

In this perspective, we examine whether quantum confinement alone, or in combination with proximity effects, can induce an observable superconducting instability in metals that are non-superconducting in bulk form. We review recent theoretical progress and present a unified framework based on a confinement-generalized, isotropic one-band Eliashberg theory, in which the normal density of states becomes energy dependent and key material parameters ($E_F$, $λ$, and $μ^{*}$) acquire an explicit thickness dependence. By numerically solving the resulting Eliashberg equations using ab-initio or experimentally determined electron--phonon spectral functions $α^{2}F(Ω)$ and Coulomb pseudopotentials $μ^{*}$, and without introducing adjustable parameters, we compute the critical temperature $T_c$ as a function of film thickness for representative noble, alkali, and alkaline-earth metals. The theory predicts that superconductivity can emerge only in selected cases and within extremely narrow thickness windows, typically centered around sub-nanometer scales ($L \\sim 0.4$--$0.6$~nm). We further discuss layered superconductor/normal-metal systems, where quantum confinement and proximity effects coexist.

In this work, Mg-Ti-H ternary hydrides are explored under high pressures up to 300 GPa using the prediction method of the particle swarm optimization algorithm combined with first-principles calculations. Two new structures, $P4/nmm$-MgTiH$_6$ and $Pmm2$-Mg$_3$TiH$_6$, are identified to be thermodynamically stable at both 200 GPa and 300 GPa. Thermodynamically stable structures of Mg$_3$TiH$_{12}$ are also identified, whose space groups are $R3/m$ at 200 GPa and $Pm\\bar{3}m$ at 300 GPa, respectively. Among these Mg-Ti-H structures, $P4/nmm$-MgTiH$_6$ achieves a record-high $T_\\text{c}$ of 81.9 K at 170 GPa, exceeding the boiling point of liquid nitrogen. Such a high $T_\\text{c}$ is primarily attributed to strong electron-phonon coupling (EPC) driven by low-frequency acoustic phonon modes, with the EPC strength reaching a large value of 1.54. The $T_\\text{c}$ of $Pm\\bar{3}m$-Mg$_3$TiH$_{12}$ is predicted to be 40 K at 300 GPa. Furthermore, element substitution of Zr(Hf) for Ti achieves considerable enhancement of superconducting properties in our predicted hydrogen-rich and high-symmetric crystal structures, i.e., $P4/nmm$-MgTiH$_6$ and $Pm\\bar{3}m$-Mg$_3$TiH$_{12}$. The high pressure required for dynamical stability is lowered to 100 GPa in both $Pm\\bar{3}m$-Mg$_3$ZrH$_{12}$ and $Pm\\bar{3}m$-Mg$_3$HfH$_{12}$, and to 90 GPa and 120 GPa for $P4/nmm$-MgZrH$_6$ and $P4/nmm$-MgHfH$_6$, respectively. Particularly, the electronic structure near the Fermi level is significantly modified in the $P4/nmm$-MgHfH$_6$ phase, and pronounced softening of low-frequency acoustic phonon modes occurs.

Here, based on the recently proposed incommensurate energy band (IEB) theory, we present a universal IQHE theory that does not rely on magnetic translation symmetry and is applicable to both rational and irrational magnetic fluxes. Using the square lattice as a paradigmatic example, we first show that the IEB framework provides a superior description of its energy spectrum in a magnetic field, as it explicitly reveals the momentum-space distribution of eigenstates. Key to our IQHE theory is that each gap in the IEB spectrum is intrinsically labeled by an integer pair (m,g), defined by the corresponding Bragg planes. When the Fermi energy lies within such a gap, the occupied electron states $N_{\\text{occ}}$ is determined by the k-space volume enclosed by these Bragg planes, leading to the fundamental relation $N_{\\text{occ}}/N_0 = m(φ/φ_0) + g$. Through Středa formula, this leads directly to the quantized Hall conductance $σ_{xy} = m e^2/h$ under arbitrary magnetic fields.

Using a nonlinear phononics model, we numerically solve the coupled equations of motion governing the lattice dynamics and analyze the resulting time- and frequency-domain responses.

Here, we establish design principles for nanocluster cocatalysts on GaN-based semiconductors by systematically analyzing the spatially resolved electronic structure of GaN-, InGaN-, and ScGaN-based slabs decorated with six-atom elemental nanoclusters. Using a region-resolved projected local density of states (PLDOS) framework, we reveal that semiconductor-nanocluster interfaces operate as laterally heterogeneous electronic systems, in which nanocluster-covered regions govern charge injection and band bending, while uncovered nitride regions retain surface states that facilitate surface activation. We further show that cocatalyst effectiveness is controlled not only by hydrogen adsorption energy, but also by interfacial electrostatics, including band alignment, metal-induced gap-state suppression, and in-plane dipoles, with the semiconductor substrate defining the baseline electronic regime. Machine-learning regression models trained on physically motivated global and region-specific descriptors quantify the relative importance of these mechanisms and their correlation with hydrogen adsorption energetics. Together, this work provides transferable design principles for nanocluster cocatalysts on III-nitrides and a generalizable first-principles framework for studying spatially heterogeneous semiconductor-nanocluster interfaces."}

We do so by developing a surface spin group formalism that fully classifies all surface magnetic states and identifies altermagnetic surface spin groups that can arise at the surfaces of antiferromagnets. We use this formalism to identify over 140 antiferromagnetic entries from the MAGNDATA database with at least one altermagnetic surface, often times with multiple such surfaces in the same material. We illustrate this emergent phenomenon in a realistic Lieb lattice-based minimal model and present ab initio calculations on two representative material candidates, NaMnP and FeGe$_2$, exhibiting $d$-wave and $g$-wave surface altermagnetism, respectively. Our theory naturally resolves the contradiction of recent experimental reports of $d$-wave ARPES measurements on metallic Lieb lattice compounds that have been shown to be antiferromagnetic in the bulk. Hence, we establish a new paradigm for generating two-dimensional altermagnetism by functionalizing the abundant material class of collinear antiferromagnets as viable platforms for controlled surface altermagnetism, creating natural materials for future hybrid device implementation."}

Surface altermagnetism emerges only when the surface termination simultaneously breaks both $PT$ and translation--time-reversal symmetry ($tT$), thereby inducing magnetic sublattice inequivalence between antiferromagnetically coupled surface moments.

Here we demonstrate that epitaxial films with sharp interfaces can be achieved for layered SnSe grown directly on on-axis and 4 degree miscut GaAs(001) substrates. The substrate miscut strongly influences the growth morphology, evolving from spirals on on-axis GaAs to a terraced structure on miscut GaAs. X-ray diffraction reveals that on-axis GaAs supports SnSe with two in-plane orientation variants, whereas the miscut substrate stabilizes a single orientation and introduces a small out-of-plane tilt. Accordingly, in-plane optical anisotropy is enhanced in the single variant film compared to the double variant, as determined by cross-polar reflectance. High-resolution TEM shows that the SnSe/GaAs interface is atomically abrupt and incoherent, characteristic of quasi-van der Waals epitaxy. We find a pronounced tendency for the zigzag edges of SnSe to align parallel to step edges on both substrates, and we show that step-skipping nucleation and layer growth on the miscut substrate leads to the additional tilt. These results establish direct SnSe/GaAs heteroepitaxy as a route to integrate anisotropic layered semiconductors with cubic platforms, and show that miscut substrates provide additional control over in-plane anisotropy."}

The results indicate that all defects considered, except for OC, possess neutral or negative charge states, thereby making them suitable for detection by positron annihilation spectroscopy (PAS). Furthermore, the electron and positron density distributions and positron annihilation lifetimes for the perfect 3C-SiC supercell and various defective configurations are computed. It is found that the OSi and OSiVC complexes act as effective positron trapping centers, leading to the formation of positron trapped states and a notable increase in annihilation lifetimes at the corresponding defect sites. In addition, coincidence Doppler broadening (CDB) spectra, along with the S and W parameters, are calculated for both intrinsic and oxygen-doped point defects (OC, OSi, OCVSi, and OSiVC). The analysis reveals that electron screening effects dominate the annihilation characteristics of the OSi defect, whereas positron localization induced by the vacancy is the predominant contributor in the case of OSiVC. This distinction results in clearly different momentum distributions of these two oxygen-related defects for different charge states. Overall, the PAS is demonstrated to be a powerful technique for distinguishing intrinsic vacancy-type defects and oxygen-doped composites in 3C-SiC. Combining the analysis of electron and positron density distributions, the electron localization and positron trapping behavior in defect systems with different charge states can be comprehensively understood.

However, unlike computer vision tasks where visual fidelity suffices, physical systems require the rigorous reproduction of higher-order statistical moments and thermodynamic quantities. While Score-Based Generative Models (SGMs) have emerged as a powerful tool, their standard formulation on Euclidean embedding space is ill-suited for continuous spin systems, where variables inherently reside on a manifold. In this work, we demonstrate that training on the Euclidean space compromises the model's ability to learn the target distribution as it prioritizes to learn the manifold constraints. We address this limitation by proposing the use of Manifold-Aware Score-Based Generative Modeling framework applied to the 64x64 2D XY model (a 4096-dimensional torus). We show that our method estimates the theoretical Boltzmann score with superior precision compared to standard diffusion models. Consequently, we successfully capture the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz Thouless (BKT) phase transition and accurately reproduce second-moment quantities, such as heat capacity without explicit feature engineering. Furthermore, we demonstrate zero-shot generalization to unseen lattice sizes, accurately recovering the physics of variable system scales without retraining. Since this approach bypasses domain-specific feature engineering, it remains intrinsically generalizable to other continuous spin systems."}

However, the performance of self-healing depends on specific chemical mechanisms involved. The formation of semiconductive carbonaceous soot represents a critical failure risk. This study investigates how oxygen atom impregnation through ozonation of the dielectric material tunes the composition and electrical conductivity of breakdown products in the PP and PI systems with aluminum-zinc electrodes. We revealed, at the atomistic level, that oxygen atoms tend to remove a fraction of carbon atoms from the semiconductive soot by oxidizing carbon into carbon monoxide in both polymers. In PP, oxygen fraction linearly increases gas mass fraction, thereby reducing soot fraction. In PI, the gas/soot ratio effect of oxygen content is less drastic, still clearly positive. The PP soot conductivity decreases uniformly as larger fractions of oxygen atoms are added. In turn, the PI conductivity drops to ~1500 S/m quickly. The PI soot exhibits narrower band gaps compared to that of PP. The oxygen fraction non-monotonically tailors band gaps, which generally increase. To summarize, ozonation enhances MFC reliability by increasing gas species fraction and reducing soot conductivity. We hereby provide numerical molecular-level insights to rationalize self-healing performance enhancement through polymer ozonation."}

In this perspective, we examine whether quantum confinement alone, or in combination with proximity effects, can induce an observable superconducting instability in metals that are non-superconducting in bulk form. We review recent theoretical progress and present a unified framework based on a confinement-generalized, isotropic one-band Eliashberg theory, in which the normal density of states becomes energy dependent and key material parameters ($E_F$, $λ$, and $μ^{*}$) acquire an explicit thickness dependence. By numerically solving the resulting Eliashberg equations using ab-initio or experimentally determined electron--phonon spectral functions $α^{2}F(Ω)$ and Coulomb pseudopotentials $μ^{*}$, and without introducing adjustable parameters, we compute the critical temperature $T_c$ as a function of film thickness for representative noble, alkali, and alkaline-earth metals. The theory predicts that superconductivity can emerge only in selected cases and within extremely narrow thickness windows, typically centered around sub-nanometer scales ($L \\sim 0.4$--$0.6$~nm). We further discuss layered superconductor/normal-metal systems, where quantum confinement and proximity effects coexist. In these heterostructures, a substantial enhancement of the critical temperature is predicted, even when the constituent materials are non-superconducting or poor superconductors in bulk form."}

Furthermore, a distinctive cooling effect persists below about 1 T, a characteristic absent for conventional magnetic coolants. A dipolar Shastry-Sutherland model is introduced as a minimal model to describe this system; in particular, the experimentally revealed 1/3 magnetization pseudo-plateau can be ascribed to the presence of dipolar couplings between Eu2+ ions, further stabilized by the thermal fluctuations, explaining the persistent cooling effect.

Most experimental studies have focused on materials with strong spin-orbit coupling or pronounced orbital character, where sizable orbital Hall responses are expected. Elemental ferromagnets such as Fe are generally regarded as quenched orbital sources and are not expected to exhibit orbital-dominated THz emission. Here, we report a pronounced enhancement of THz emission in Fe/Pt/W trilayer heterostructures, despite the absence of detectable orbital contributions in the corresponding Fe/Pt and Fe/W bilayers. Thickness-dependent measurements reveal long-distance signal persistence, systematic delay accumulation, and pronounced pulse broadening with increasing W thickness. These features are inconsistent with diffusive spin transport and indicate that orbital angular momentum transport in the W layer, converted into charge current via the IOHE, becomes a dominant channel for THz emission in the trilayer configuration. Our results demonstrate that strong IOHE can emerge in heterostructures incorporating a quenched orbital ferromagnet, providing an effective route to enhance spintronic THz emitters through orbital Hall physics."}

Beyond 6 GPa, the system exhibits metallic behavior across the entire temperature range, and superconductivity emerges below Tc = 1.8 K at 8 GPa. Based on the systematic magnetotransport measurement under pressure, we demonstrate that the superconductivity occurs following a significant electronic structure modulation possibly due to pressure induced structural changes near 6 GPa, which coincides with dramatic enhancement of the magnetoresistance (MR) reaching up to 1400 percent. Our experimental results are substantiated by density functional theory calculations as the application of pressure drastically alters the density of states near the Fermi level. Notably, multiple hole pockets emerge at the Fermi level from 4 GPa onward, and their contributions are further enhanced with increasing pressure. The combined experimental and theoretical investigation reveals a comprehensive evolution of electronic structure of Dirac semimetal ZrTe5 under pressure and suggest a possible link between the Fermi surface reconstruction in the pressure range of structural transition and emergence of superconductivity"}

While the aluminum Josephson junction is of utmost importance, maintaining quantum coherence across the entire device means that pair-breaking in Nb leads, capacitive pads, and readout resonators can be a major source of decoherence. The established contributors are surface oxides and hydroxides, as well as absorbed hydrogen and oxygen. Metal encapsulation of freshly grown surfaces with non-oxidizing metals, preferably without breaking the vacuum, is a successful strategy to mitigate these issues. While the positive effects of encapsulation are undeniable, it is important to understand its impact on the macroscopic behavior of niobium films. We present a comprehensive study of the bulk superconducting properties of Nb thin films encapsulated with gold and palladium/gold, and compare them to those of bare Nb films. Magneto-optical imaging, magnetization, resistivity, and London and Campbell penetration depth measurements reveal significant differences in encapsulated samples. Both sputtered, and epitaxial Au-capped films exhibit the highest residual resistivity ratio and superconducting transition temperature, as well as the lowest upper critical field, London penetration depth, and critical current. These results are in good agreement with the microscopic theory of anisotropic normal and superconducting states of Nb. We conclude that pair-breaking in the bulk of niobium films, driven by disorder throughout the film rather than just at the surface, is a significant source of quantum decoherence in transmons. We also conclude that gold capping not only passivates the surface but also affects the properties of the entire film, significantly reducing the scattering rate due to defects likely induced by surface diffusion if the film is not protected immediately after fabrication."}

We introduce a chemically-aware adaptive tokenizer that dynamically balances discretization granularity to preserve spectral semantics while controlling vocabulary size, and an assignment-free peak-aware similarity metric that enables direct comparison between predicted and experimental spectra. Through a unified molecule-to-spectrum paradigm and synergistic coupling of prediction, retrieval, and generation modules, NMRPeak achieves transformative performance on experimental benchmarks: it overcomes the longstanding simulation-to-experiment gap in spectrum prediction while delivering over 95% top-1 accuracy in molecular retrieval and approximately 75% top-1 accuracy in stereochemistry-aware de novo structure generation. These capabilities establish a foundation for automated, high-throughput molecular structure elucidation in organic synthesis, drug discovery, and chemical biology."}

Methods such as combinatorial spread libraries and printed libraries sample a defined low-D manifold in the chemical space of the system. Here, we introduce a time-aware framework for comparing sequential and manifold BO under experimentally realistic constraints. By explicitly modeling synthesis and characterization times, we define an effective experimental time metric that enables fair, time-normalized benchmarking of optimization strategies. Using numerical experiments in ternary and quaternary compositional spaces, we show that sequential BO remains optimal for short-term experiments or when batching provides no effective time advantage, whereas manifold BO becomes favorable once multiplexed synthesis enables faster accumulation of measurements. We identify a small set of physically interpretable parameters that govern the transition between these regimes.

We do so by developing a surface spin group formalism that fully classifies all surface magnetic states and identifies altermagnetic surface spin groups that can arise at the surfaces of antiferromagnets. We use this formalism to identify over 140 antiferromagnetic entries from the MAGNDATA database with at least one altermagnetic surface, often times with multiple such surfaces in the same material. We illustrate this emergent phenomenon in a realistic Lieb lattice-based minimal model and present ab initio calculations on two representative material candidates, NaMnP and FeGe$_2$, exhibiting $d$-wave and $g$-wave surface altermagnetism, respectively. Our theory naturally resolves the contradiction of recent experimental reports of $d$-wave ARPES measurements on metallic Lieb lattice compounds that have been shown to be antiferromagnetic in the bulk. Hence, we establish a new paradigm for generating two-dimensional altermagnetism by functionalizing the abundant material class of collinear antiferromagnets as viable platforms for controlled surface altermagnetism, creating natural materials for future hybrid device implementation."}

From density-functional calculations, we extract the dominant intralayer exchange couplings up to third-nearest neighbors and the leading interlayer exchanges up to second-nearest neighbors, enabling construction of an effective bilayer spin Hamiltonian. We first analyze interface-driven proximity effects within a ferromagnetic reference configuration, demonstrating how recovery of AB-type stacking and spin alignment--while varying only the transition-metal species--provides a route for selectively tuning magnetic order and symmetry breaking within the P$\\bar{6}$m2 space group. Building on this microscopic understanding of the bonding environment, we then examine antiferromagnetic ordering tendencies in the coupled layers. Exact diagonalization of the resulting bilayer Hamiltonian reveals the magnetic ground state and low-lying excitation spectrum, showing that the interlayer exchange is not merely perturbative but competes directly with intralayer interactions in stabilizing the observed spin configurations. These results establish Bernal-stacked MA$_2$Z$_4$ bilayers as a platform in which stacking geometry and exchange hierarchy jointly govern magnetic reconstruction, offering a controlled pathway toward domain selection and spin-texture engineering in low-dimensional van der Waals materials."}

Surface altermagnetism emerges only when the surface termination simultaneously breaks both $PT$ and translation--time-reversal symmetry ($tT$), thereby inducing magnetic sublattice inequivalence between antiferromagnetically coupled surface moments. We demonstrate this mechanism explicitly for the G-type antiferromagnets V$_3$Al and BaMn$_2$Sb$_2$, and show that the same symmetry criterion applies broadly across distinct structural families of centrosymmetric antiferromagnets.

We employ two complementary techniques -- the standard field-theoretic RG and a perturbative bootstrap scheme, and perform the $ε$-expansion calculations up to the two-loop level. We show that, as long as $σ<2$, the SR-WFP becomes unstable and a stable LR-WFP emerges, and, in the non-classical regime with $d/2 < σ< 2$, the critical exponents, including the anomalous dimension, are functions of $ε$, $δ=2-σ$ and $n$, which reduce to the exact results in the limiting cases $ε\\to 0$, $δ\\to 0$ or $n \\to \\infty$.

The method of physical modeling with low-temperature metallic alloys (Wood and Rose) and transparent organic media (salol, camphene, diphenylamine) was used. It was established that vibration and ultrasound significantly reduce the supercooling required to initiate crystallization. The effectiveness of the influence significantly increases for samples with solid substrates. The hypotheses about the influence through changes in melt viscosity and the exclusive role of cavitation were experimentally refuted. The transition from pre-cavitation to cavitation ultrasound regime is not accompanied by qualitative changes in the influence on nucleation. The mechanism of elastic oscillation influence is substantiated, which consists in mechanical impact on adsorbed crystal nuclei on the surfaces of solid substrates. Elastic oscillations increase the nucleation rate by creating growth steps (dislocations) on the surfaces of adsorbed nuclei as a result of mechanical friction of solid substrates and cavitation erosion. The results have fundamental significance for understanding the physical nature of metal crystallization and practical application for developing technologies for controlling structure formation."}

Among them, the 2.51 THz CDW amplitude mode A(18) directly weakens the Ta-chain tetramerization, approaching a transient restoration of the uniform-chain geometry. It is also the most efficient mode owing to its low frequency and a relatively small critical displacement dominated by Ta motions. Other Raman modes, dominated by Se vibrations, require significantly larger displacements to reach the Weyl-semimetallic regime and are generally less effective than A(18) at reducing the Ta-chain tetramerization. Furthermore, we explore nonlinear phonon-phonon interactions and find that the low-frequency infrared-active mode B3(7) (1.14 THz) exhibits strong anharmonic coupling with A(18), providing an indirect pathway to drive the system toward a Weyl-semimetallic regime.

Despite the increasing number of potential factors affecting samples being identified, obtaining the high-quality device performance with desired topological quantum phases remains a challenge. In this work, by comparing the reflective magnetic circular dichroism (RMCD) of crystals with different defect densities that are characterized by atomically resolved scanning tunneling microscopy, we demonstrate that anti-site defects play an essential role in achieving ideal magnetic states. By measuring RMCD hysteresis loops with operando heating, we find that MnBi2Te4 few-layer samples are highly susceptible to thermal impact, even at temperature as low as 45°C. The magnetic behavior of heating-treated samples is akin to that of samples fabricated into devices, revealing the thermal impact on devices as well. Starting from few-layers with ideal layer-dependent magnetic order, thermal heating leads to the convergence of magnetization and transition fields between odd- and even-layers. The observed heating-induced magnetic evolution can serve as a valuable reference for assessing the sample quality or the density of anti-site defects. Our findings not only point out the long-standing hidden factor that arose controversies in MnBi2Te4, but also pave the way for controllably engineering the topological quantum phenomena."}

In this perspective, we examine whether quantum confinement alone, or in combination with proximity effects, can induce an observable superconducting instability in metals that are non-superconducting in bulk form. We review recent theoretical progress and present a unified framework based on a confinement-generalized, isotropic one-band Eliashberg theory, in which the normal density of states becomes energy dependent and key material parameters ($E_F$, $λ$, and $μ^{*}$) acquire an explicit thickness dependence. By numerically solving the resulting Eliashberg equations using ab-initio or experimentally determined electron--phonon spectral functions $α^{2}F(Ω)$ and Coulomb pseudopotentials $μ^{*}$, and without introducing adjustable parameters, we compute the critical temperature $T_c$ as a function of film thickness for representative noble, alkali, and alkaline-earth metals. The theory predicts that superconductivity can emerge only in selected cases and within extremely narrow thickness windows, typically centered around sub-nanometer scales ($L \\sim 0.4$--$0.6$~nm). We further discuss layered superconductor/normal-metal systems, where quantum confinement and proximity effects coexist. In these heterostructures, a substantial enhancement of the critical temperature is predicted, even when the constituent materials are non-superconducting or poor superconductors in bulk form."}

We observe a characteristic 'Mexican hat'-shaped magnetoresistance, a signature of superconductivity coexisting with emergent antiferromagnetic (AFM) fluctuations. This distinctive feature arises from a competition between the magnetic field's suppression of AFM fluctuation-driven scattering and its suppression of superconducting fluctuations. We quantify these AFM fluctuations by a crossover field, B*, whose magnitude decreases with increasing temperature and vanishes near the superconducting onset-behavior contrasting sharply with that in high-Tc cuprates.

We first derive formulas for linear response theory for time-dependent Markov chains and diffusions processes. We discuss existence, uniqueness, and differentiability of the pullback measure under general (not necessarily slow or periodic) perturbations of the transition kernels. An explicit Green-Kubo-type formula for the linear response is derived. We analyze in detail the case of periodic reference dynamics, where the unperturbed pullback attractor is periodic but the response is generally not. Our formulas reduce to those of classic linear response if one considers a reference autonomous state. Finally, we show that our results allow for extending the theory of optimal fingerprinting for detection and attribution of climate change (or change in any complex system) for the case of time-dependent background state and for the case where the optimal solution is sought for multiple time slices at the same time. We provide strong numerical support for the findings by applying our theory to a modified version of the Ghil-Sellers energy balance model where we include explicit time dependence in the reference state as a result of natural forcings. We verify the accuracy of response theory in predicting the impact of increases of $CO_2$ in the temperature field even when we discretize the system using Markov state modelling approach.

CeRh$_2$As$_2$ has recently emerged as one of the few existing multi-phase superconductors. It exhibits a first-order phase transition between two distinct superconducting states when a magnetic field is applied along the crystallographic $c$-axis. While this behavior has been linked to locally broken inversion symmetry, a phase diagram based on a multi-component superconducting order parameter remains a possibility. Furthermore, superconductivity appears to coexist with an ordered state (phase I). Despite being the subject of many studies, little is known about the nature of the order parameters in both superconducting phases and phase I. Here, we use ultrasound-propagation measurements at low temperatures, in high magnetic fields and under hydrostatic pressure to address this issue. Our results strongly suggest that the superconducting order parameter in both phases is single-component, corroborating the role of local non-centrosymmetry in the development of multi-phase superconductivity in CeRh$_2$As$_2$. In addition, analysis of the elastic anomalies within the Landau framework of phase transitions strongly suggests the presence of an incommensurate magnetic order parameter in phase I."}

Here we demonstrate that epitaxial films with sharp interfaces can be achieved for layered SnSe grown directly on on-axis and 4 degree miscut GaAs(001) substrates. The substrate miscut strongly influences the growth morphology, evolving from spirals on on-axis GaAs to a terraced structure on miscut GaAs. X-ray diffraction reveals that on-axis GaAs supports SnSe with two in-plane orientation variants, whereas the miscut substrate stabilizes a single orientation and introduces a small out-of-plane tilt. Accordingly, in-plane optical anisotropy is enhanced in the single variant film compared to the double variant, as determined by cross-polar reflectance. High-resolution TEM shows that the SnSe/GaAs interface is atomically abrupt and incoherent, characteristic of quasi-van der Waals epitaxy. We find a pronounced tendency for the zigzag edges of SnSe to align parallel to step edges on both substrates, and we show that step-skipping nucleation and layer growth on the miscut substrate leads to the additional tilt.

Applying the variational principle, we derive a functional Schrödinger equation analogous to the Gross-Pitaevskii equation in conventional bosonic systems. In the absence of external forces, the variational equation admits a uniform solution that is uniquely determined by a microscopic interaction potential $U(ψ^*ψ)$ and the chemical potential. This uniform solution describes a uniform gas of bosonic surfaces. Using the obtained energy functional, we show that low-energy fluctuations contain a gapless $p$-form field $A_p^{}$ when the $p$-form global symmetry is $\\mathrm{U}(1)$, whereas the $p$-form field becomes massive for discrete symmetries, whose low-energy limit is described by a $\\mathrm{BF}$-type topological field theory. As a consequence, the system exhibits abelian topological order with anyonic surface excitations.

Here, we report results of Knight-shift and ac-susceptibility measurements on UTe$_2$. We demonstrate that the spin susceptibility, which slightly decreases compared to the normal-state value below the superconducting (SC) transition temperature $T_{\\rm c}$, is rapidly restored and nearly recovers to the normal-state values around 5 T, well below the SC upper critical field $H_{c2}$ when the magnetic field is applied along the $c$ axis ($H \\parallel c$).

Our combined experimental and theoretical analysis reveals a very small effective trigonal distortion of only 11 meV in the CoO6 octahedra, indicating a close to ideal condition to render a ground state with the Jeff = 1/2 character. With our cluster model we were also able to simulate magnetic susceptibility measurements along different directions in the crystal.

Rotational invariance reduces the problem to the stationary single-coordinate marginal $p_X(x)$, from which the radial distribution $p_R(r)$ and the full joint stationary density follow by explicit integral transforms. We first focus on a generalized trapped RTP in one dimension, where post-tumble velocities are drawn from an arbitrary distribution $W(v)$. Using a Kesten-type recursion, we represent its stationary position in terms of a stick-breaking (or Dirichlet) process, yielding closed-form expressions for its distribution and its moments. Specializing $W(v)$ to the projected velocity law of an isotropic RTP, we reconstruct $p_R(r)$ and the full joint distribution of all the coordinates in $d=1,2,3$. In $d=1$ and $d=2$, the radial law simplifies to a beta distribution, while in $d=3$, we derive closed-form expressions for $p_R(r)$ and the stationary joint distribution $P(x,y,z)$, which differ from a beta distribution. In all cases, we characterize a persistence-controlled shape transition at the turning surface $r=v_0/μ$, where $v_0$ is the self-propulsion speed. We further include thermal noise characterized by a diffusion coefficient $D>0$, showing that the stationary law is a Gaussian convolution of the $D=0$ result, which regularizes turning-point singularities and controls the crossover between persistence- and diffusion-dominated regimes as $D \\to 0$ and $D \\to \\infty$ respectively.

However, the performance of self-healing depends on specific chemical mechanisms involved. The formation of semiconductive carbonaceous soot represents a critical failure risk. This study investigates how oxygen atom impregnation through ozonation of the dielectric material tunes the composition and electrical conductivity of breakdown products in the PP and PI systems with aluminum-zinc electrodes. We revealed, at the atomistic level, that oxygen atoms tend to remove a fraction of carbon atoms from the semiconductive soot by oxidizing carbon into carbon monoxide in both polymers. In PP, oxygen fraction linearly increases gas mass fraction, thereby reducing soot fraction. In PI, the gas/soot ratio effect of oxygen content is less drastic, still clearly positive. The PP soot conductivity decreases uniformly as larger fractions of oxygen atoms are added. In turn, the PI conductivity drops to ~1500 S/m quickly. The PI soot exhibits narrower band gaps compared to that of PP. The oxygen fraction non-monotonically tailors band gaps, which generally increase. To summarize, ozonation enhances MFC reliability by increasing gas species fraction and reducing soot conductivity. We hereby provide numerical molecular-level insights to rationalize self-healing performance enhancement through polymer ozonation."}

Here, this work investigates the high-spin (S = 7/2) Eu-based magnet Eu2MgSi2O7 (EMSO) using low-temperature magnetothermal measurements and Monte Carlo simulations, revealing a giant magnetocaloric effect (MCE) in this Shastry-Sutherland compound. The entropy change peak value is found to be 55.0 J kg-1 K-1 under a field change of B = 0-4 T, approximately 1.5 times larger than the commercial Gd3Ga5O12 (GGG). Adiabatic demagnetization refrigeration achieves a lowest temperature of 151 mK, deeply into the sub-Kelvin regime. Furthermore, a distinctive cooling effect persists below about 1 T, a characteristic absent for conventional magnetic coolants. A dipolar Shastry-Sutherland model is introduced as a minimal model to describe this system; in particular, the experimentally revealed 1/3 magnetization pseudo-plateau can be ascribed to the presence of dipolar couplings between Eu2+ ions, further stabilized by the thermal fluctuations, explaining the persistent cooling effect.

A physically constrained generative framework that replaces temporal relaxation with a spatial projection mechanism for critical systems is proposed. Using the two-dimensional Ising model at criticality as a benchmark, we introduce an energy-constrained kernel that synthesizes large-scale configurations from compact equilibrated seeds by enforcing Hamiltonian-level observables. The generated configurations are projected onto the nearest-neighbor energy manifold, ensuring thermodynamic consistency while retaining universal critical properties. We show that the resulting configurations reproduce scale-invariant spin correlations, Binder cumulants, and isotropic structure factors for lattice sizes exceeding 10,000, without iterative Monte Carlo equilibration. While not a strict renormalization group transformation, and motivated by renormalization ideas, the method provides a practical inverse mapping that retains universal features of criticality and enables efficient GPU-parallel generation of ultra-large critical ensembles."}

Most experimental studies have focused on materials with strong spin-orbit coupling or pronounced orbital character, where sizable orbital Hall responses are expected. Elemental ferromagnets such as Fe are generally regarded as quenched orbital sources and are not expected to exhibit orbital-dominated THz emission. Here, we report a pronounced enhancement of THz emission in Fe/Pt/W trilayer heterostructures, despite the absence of detectable orbital contributions in the corresponding Fe/Pt and Fe/W bilayers. Thickness-dependent measurements reveal long-distance signal persistence, systematic delay accumulation, and pronounced pulse broadening with increasing W thickness. These features are inconsistent with diffusive spin transport and indicate that orbital angular momentum transport in the W layer, converted into charge current via the IOHE, becomes a dominant channel for THz emission in the trilayer configuration. Our results demonstrate that strong IOHE can emerge in heterostructures incorporating a quenched orbital ferromagnet, providing an effective route to enhance spintronic THz emitters through orbital Hall physics."}

With increasing pressure, the characteristic peak (Tp) in its electrical resistivity first shifts to higher temperature and then moves quickly towards the lower temperature before disappearing eventually at 6 GPa. Beyond 6 GPa, the system exhibits metallic behavior across the entire temperature range, and superconductivity emerges below Tc = 1.8 K at 8 GPa. Based on the systematic magnetotransport measurement under pressure, we demonstrate that the superconductivity occurs following a significant electronic structure modulation possibly due to pressure induced structural changes near 6 GPa, which coincides with dramatic enhancement of the magnetoresistance (MR) reaching up to 1400 percent. Our experimental results are substantiated by density functional theory calculations as the application of pressure drastically alters the density of states near the Fermi level. Notably, multiple hole pockets emerge at the Fermi level from 4 GPa onward, and their contributions are further enhanced with increasing pressure. The combined experimental and theoretical investigation reveals a comprehensive evolution of electronic structure of Dirac semimetal ZrTe5 under pressure and suggest a possible link between the Fermi surface reconstruction in the pressure range of structural transition and emergence of superconductivity"}

Heterostructuring and functionalization of magnetic oxides have been very popular due to their versatility and readiness for integration in modern electronics. In this study, we provide yet another example of this phenomenology by predicting that an insulating ferromagnetic state can be realized in superlattices of LaMnO$_3$ and SrTiO$_3$ oriented along the (111) direction. In strike contrast with respect to other orientations, these properties are not of extrinsic origin but arise from the interplay of structural order, strain and quantum confinement. The bandgap is shown to be either direct and indirect, depending on the precise composition, which can be explained in terms of the geometrical properties of (111)-oriented bilayers of LaMnO$_3$. The electronic structure shows narrow bands indicating localized $e_g$ states for all the investigated superlattices. These features and the analysis of the inter-atomic magnetic coupling suggest that the investigated superlattices behave as a Kugel-Khomskii material, at least for the explored compositions.

This concept is essential in magnonics, a subfield of spintronics that leverages spin waves for processing and transmitting information. Compared to conventional electronics, magnonics offers lower power consumption and faster operation, making it a promising technology for future devices. Magnons can be confined using both static and dynamic methods, often relying on potential wells and barriers to restrict their free propagation and trap them in designated locations. In this review, we will explore the main strategies for magnon confinement and trapping, including: magnetic field inhomogeneities, spin textures (i.e. domain walls, vortices, skyrmions) nanostructured materials (i.e. nanowires, disks, and magnonic crystals), topological states, chiral magnons and flat band formation, induced by dipole-dipole interactions and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Microwave cavities and resonant magnetic fields, as well as spin-torque effects and Bose-Einstein condensation contribute to magnon localization. Furthermore, spin-wave edge and cavity modes have been observed in two-dimensional magnetic materials and twisted moiré superlattices at a specific twist angle. Magnon trapping has broad applications in computing and data processing, particularly in the development of magnonic crystals, waveguides, and memory elements. Additionally, magnon systems are being explored for quantum computing, where confinement can enhance the coupling between magnons and other quasiparticles in hybrid quantum systems. Precision control of magnons could lead to next-generation spintronic devices, offering improved efficiency and scalability."}

Surprisingly, all compositions exhibited n-type behavior, except for pristine DBTTF. This behavior is explained by the electronic structure of the mixtures, as revealed by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy, which indicates that charge injection and transport occur via the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of the DAC and HATCN. Additionally, the observed electrical conductivity is strongly influenced by morphology and structural ordering of the films. These findings offer valuable insights for the design of advanced materials with enhanced electrical performance."}

Because of its 5d3 electronic configuration in an octahedral coordination, the ground state is a pure spin state without orbital degeneracy within the LS coupling scheme, but it can become Jahn-Teller active in the strong spin-orbit coupling limit described by the $jj$ coupling [S. Streltsov and D. I. Khomskii, Phys. Rev. X 10, 031043 (2020)]. While the structural transitions in K$_2$ReCl$_6$ are understood in terms of octahedral rotation and tilting, the possible impact of a Jahn-Teller distortion remains an open issue. We report on comprehensive crystalstructure studies by means of powder neutron and single-crystal x-ray diffraction on K$_2$ReCl$_6$ and on K$_2$SnCl$_6$. The latter material is used as a reference, because it exhibits the same sequence of structural transitions as K$_2$ReCl$_6$, but possesses a filled 4d shell ruling out a Jahn-Teller distortion. While the ReCl$_6$ octahedron in K$_2$ReCl$_6$ presents sizable distortions at intermediate temperatures, there is no such distortion persisting to low temperatures excluding a sizable Jahn-Teller effect. Studies on polycrystalline samples of Rb$_2$ReCl$_6$ and Cs$_2$ReCl$_6$, in which the structural transitions are suppressed due to the larger alkaline ionic radius, also do not find any indications for a Jahn-Teller distortion."}

Each star is built from edge-sharing triangles with an antiferromagnetic interaction on the shared side and ferromagnetic interactions on the others. At a critical coupling ratio, the ideal star model - defined by equal ferromagnetic interactions - exhibits a macroscopically degenerate ground state, which we map onto a site percolation problem on the Lieb lattice. This mapping enables the calculation of exponential ground-state degeneracy and the corresponding residual entropy for square, triangular, honeycomb, and cubic lattices. Remarkably, the residual entropy remains high for all studied lattices, exceeding 60\\% of the maximal value ln(2). Despite a gapless quadratic one-magnon spectrum, the low-temperature thermodynamics is governed by exponentially numerous gapped excitations. For a distorted-star variant of the model, the ground-state manifold is equivalent to that of decoupled ferromagnetic clusters, leading to exponential degeneracy with a lower, yet still substantial, residual entropy. At low temperature the system mimics a paramagnetic crystal of non-interacting spins with high spin value ($s=4$ for a square lattice). The obtained results establish a structural design principle for engineering quantum magnets with a high ground-state degeneracy, suggesting promising candidates for enhanced magnetocaloric cooling and quantum thermal machines."}

We curate approximately 1.8 million experimental and simulated spectra to construct the largest benchmark for NMR-based structure elucidation and systematically quantify the distribution shift between these domains. We introduce a chemically-aware adaptive tokenizer that dynamically balances discretization granularity to preserve spectral semantics while controlling vocabulary size, and an assignment-free peak-aware similarity metric that enables direct comparison between predicted and experimental spectra. Through a unified molecule-to-spectrum paradigm and synergistic coupling of prediction, retrieval, and generation modules, NMRPeak achieves transformative performance on experimental benchmarks: it overcomes the longstanding simulation-to-experiment gap in spectrum prediction while delivering over 95% top-1 accuracy in molecular retrieval and approximately 75% top-1 accuracy in stereochemistry-aware de novo structure generation.

Also, we demonstrate Josephson diode effect by direct measurement of the critical current for two opposite directions in external magnetic field. We interpret these observations as a joint effect of the spin-polarized topological surface states and the altermagnetic spin splitting of the bulk bands in CrSb. For a single In-CrSb interface, the superconducting gap oscillates in magnetic field for both field orientations, which strongly resembles the transition into the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state.

We do so by developing a surface spin group formalism that fully classifies all surface magnetic states and identifies altermagnetic surface spin groups that can arise at the surfaces of antiferromagnets. We use this formalism to identify over 140 antiferromagnetic entries from the MAGNDATA database with at least one altermagnetic surface, often times with multiple such surfaces in the same material. We illustrate this emergent phenomenon in a realistic Lieb lattice-based minimal model and present ab initio calculations on two representative material candidates, NaMnP and FeGe$_2$, exhibiting $d$-wave and $g$-wave surface altermagnetism, respectively. Our theory naturally resolves the contradiction of recent experimental reports of $d$-wave ARPES measurements on metallic Lieb lattice compounds that have been shown to be antiferromagnetic in the bulk. Hence, we establish a new paradigm for generating two-dimensional altermagnetism by functionalizing the abundant material class of collinear antiferromagnets as viable platforms for controlled surface altermagnetism, creating natural materials for future hybrid device implementation."}

Surface altermagnetism emerges only when the surface termination simultaneously breaks both $PT$ and translation--time-reversal symmetry ($tT$), thereby inducing magnetic sublattice inequivalence between antiferromagnetically coupled surface moments. We demonstrate this mechanism explicitly for the G-type antiferromagnets V$_3$Al and BaMn$_2$Sb$_2$, and show that the same symmetry criterion applies broadly across distinct structural families of centrosymmetric antiferromagnets.

Depending on the coupling between the impurity and the superconductor, the system can have two distinct quantum ground states separated by a quantum phase transition (QPT). We investigate the interplay of two effects observed at the QPT. First, the tunneling supercurrent through the impurity reverses its sign at the QPT, denoted as a $π$-shift in the current-phase relation. Secondly, the local superconducting order parameter at the impurity site is suppressed and becomes negative at the QPT, generally termed a $π$-shift in the local superconducting order parameter. We find that both these effects are governed by the presence of the YSR state, however, they do not significantly depend or influence each other. In particular, we establish that the $π$-shift in the superconducting order parameter does not induce a $π$-shift in the tunneling Josephson current, nor can the Josephson current and its spatial behavior be used to directly probe the impurity-induced changes in the local superconducting order parameter, which occur on a length scale substantially shorter than the superconducting coherence length."}

The entropy framework successfully discriminates the torus and dynamic parallel configurations that exhibit comparable order parameter magnitudes through different organizational mechanisms. Numba just-in-time (JIT) compilation accelerates pairwise interaction calculations by $10$--$100\\times$, enabling simulations of $150$--$250$ agents over $1000$--$2000$ time steps within five minutes on standard workstation hardware. NetCDF4 output ensures interoperability with oceanographic analysis tools. The library addresses the need for standardized, reproducible infrastructure in collective behavior modeling analogous to established molecular dynamics codes."}
