This work presents a complete model for phase-field fracture for coupled thermo-mechanical problems, wherein the bulk material properties, the material strength, and the fracture toughness are specified independently. The capabilities of the model are assessed across a wide span of scenarios in thermo-mechanical fracture, from the propagation of large pre-existing cracks to crack nucleation under spatially uniform states of stress. In particular, we revisit the controlled quenching of glass plates, and demonstrate how the model captures experimentally observed crack patterns across a range of thermal loads. Ceramic disks subjected to infrared radiation are also examined, with the model reproducing both straight cracks in notched specimens and branching in intact specimens. Finally, ceramic pellets subjected to rapid power pulses are examined, with the model explaining experimental transitions from intact to fractured pellets and the important role of material strength. The results demonstrate that the complete phase-field model unifies the treatment of distinct fracture scenarios under thermal shock, surpassing classical approaches and enabling more reliable prediction of brittle fracture in extreme environments."}

However, placing Eu(III) into chiral polar structures, which are necessary for achieving narrow spectral linewidths and long optical lifetimes, is a daunting task. Here, we discover Eu2(SeO3)2(SO4)(H2O)2, a rare Eu(III) material that exhibits chiral polar symmetries encompassing both local and global structures. This unique structure is shaped by an appropriate combination of asymmetric ligands. The chirality fosters dipole-dipole interactions and J-mixing, as characterized by second-harmonic generation, photoluminescence, and magnetic susceptibility. The broken inversion symmetry is supported by the phase-matching behavior of second-harmonic generation. The J = 0 transition is observed at 578 nm with a narrow linewidth at 78 K and a microsecond-scale optical lifetime. The analysis of magnetic susceptibility data using Van Vleck theory results in an effective magnetic moment of 3.33 μB/Eu3+ and J-mixing. Heat capacity data reveal underlying phonon dynamics in the material.

Using determinant quantum Monte Carlo, we find that increasing the coupling drives an abrupt, first-order transition from a Chern insulator to a staggered charge-density wave that acts as a dynamical sublattice (Semenoff) mass. The transition is simultaneously signaled by a nearly quantized many-body Bott index and a real-space local Chern marker constructed from the interacting Green's function, both of which collapse as the charge order parameter becomes extensive. Spectral and open-boundary calculations reveal concomitant gap closing and the loss of boundary spectral weight at the critical coupling. Despite the generic phase problem induced by broken time-reversal symmetry, we show that it remains mild in the low-frequency regime and that the average phase factor sharply tracks the CI-CDW boundary. Our results establish a concrete route by which electron-phonon coupling can trigger a discontinuous collapse of Chern topology and provide experimentally relevant signatures for correlated topological platforms."}

Here, we present a lattice model for an isotropic chiral random walk that bridges the gap between classical stochastic diffusion and unitary quantum evolution. By equipping the walker with an internal degree of freedom and a tunable chirality parameter, $p$, we interpolate between a standard diffusive random walk and a deterministic, topologically non-trivial quantum walk. We show that the topological protection characteristic of the unitary limit ($p=1$) remarkably persists into the dissipative regime ($p<1$).

The data are consistent with a two-band Drude model, which allows the decomposition of the intraband response into distinct contributions. One is from a \"narrow\" Drude term which we associate with electron bands, and the other a \"broad\" Drude term linked to the hole band with strong correlations. Increasing Sr doping leads to an expansion of the hole band spectral weight, and a corresponding reduction in the electron band, indicative of the multiband electronic structure and a doping-dependent reconstruction of the Fermi surface. Both doping and temperature-dependent optical spectra display significant spectral weight transfer from high to low energy, a hallmark of strong electronic correlations.

Unlike the Eulerian formulation, the ALE approach effectively tracks flow discontinuities, such as shock waves and contact discontinuities. However, mesh motion alters the geometry and increases computational costs. To address this, two key strategies were introduced to reduce costs and enhance accuracy. The first strategy is to use the gas-kinetic scheme to construct a third-order gas-kinetic flux, rather than the Runge-Kutta method to achieve high-order time accuracy, which allows a single reconstruction and flux calculation per time step. This approach enables direct updates of both cell-averaged flow variables and their gradients using a time-accurate flux function, facilitating compact reconstruction. Second, the significant computational expense is spent on reconstruction, which requires recalculating the reconstruction matrix at each time step due to mesh changes. A simplified fourth-order compact reconstruction using a small matrix was used to mitigate this cost. The combination of fourth-order spatial reconstruction and third-order time-accurate flux evolution ensures both high resolution and computational efficiency in the ALE framework. The tests shows that the current reconstruction is 2.4x to 3.0x faster than the previous reconstruction. Additionally, a generalized ENO(GENO) method for handling discontinuities enhances the scheme's robustness. The numerical test cases, such as the Riemann problem, Sedov problem, Noh problem, and Saltzmann problem, demonstrated the robustness and accuracy of our method."}

This breaks the ground state degeneracy, splitting their energy levels and leading to an accumulation of error when performing topological quantum gates.

We present two illustrative examples where negative hybridization suppresses gate errors to such an extent that they remain below the fault-tolerance threshold. As an intrinsic property of Majorana zero modes, negative hybridization enables systems based on imperfect Majorana zero modes to regain functionality for quantum information processing."}

This study establishes a quantitative baseline for assessing how structural defects, dopants, or surface functionalization may enhance water adsorption, providing insights for the rational design of graphene-based materials in water purification, sensing, and nanofluidic applications. In this work, we employed density functional theory (DFT) with the vdW-C09 functional to investigate the adsorption of a single water molecule on pristine graphene, accurately accounting for long-range dispersion forces. Three high-symmetry adsorption sites-the center of the hexagonal ring, the C-C bond, and the top site-were explored in combination with three molecular orientations: Down, H-bond, and Up configurations. The calculated adsorption energies range from -93 to -145 meV (milli-electron volts), indicating that the interaction is dominated by weak van der Waals forces characteristic of physisorption. The most stable configuration corresponds to the Down orientation above the center of the hexagonal ring, with an adsorption energy of -145 meV and an equilibrium distance of 3.27 A (angstrom), defined as the vertical separation between the oxygen atom of the water molecule and the graphene plane. These results are in close agreement with previous theoretical studies and confirm the non-reactive and hydrophobic nature of pristine graphene."}

We identify distinct low-energy spin polarons at momenta q=0 and q=π, and also find multiple high-energy branches of spin polaron. It is demonstrated that the interaction-induced Hartree dispersion plays a decisive role in determining the momentum sector of low-energy spin polarons. Furthermore, by introducing a finite bandwidth, we unravel the underlying binding mechanisms: the formation of low-energy spin polarons is governed by the conventional virtual exchange mechanism, whereas the high-energy spin polarons arise from a joint effect of the effective attraction and virtual exchange. Our results suggest promising avenues for realizing spin polaron crystals and exploring novel superconducting pairing mechanisms in moiré materials like twisted WSe2 and MoTe2."}

Through a statistical analysis and numerical simulations, we identify and verify the existence of three distinct failure regimes: (i) disorder is effectively suppressed, (ii) disorder manifests locally near the crack tip, modifying the crack morphology, and (iii) disorder manifests globally, leading to initially diffuse failure. Our model naturally reveals the key parameters governing this behavior: the Weibull modulus, quantifying the spread in failure thresholds, and a geometric quantity termed the Slenderness Ratio. We also reproduce the disorder-induced toughening reported in previous experimental and numerical studies, further demonstrating that its manifestation depends non-monotonically on disorder. Crucially, our results indicate that this toughening cannot be simply connected to the amount of damage in the lattice, challenging interpretations that attribute increased fracture energy solely to enhanced crack tortuosity or diffuse failure. Overall, our results establish geometry as a powerful control parameter for regulating how disorder is expressed during fracture in beam-lattices, with broader implications for the disorder-induced toughening in engineered materials."}

Here we investigate this mechanism in fully gapped d+is and d+id superconductors. We find the surprising result that while stable MZMs are found in large parts of the phase diagram, strongly enhanced d-wave pairing or stronger skyrmion-induced spin twisting can in fact destroy topology unlike in s-wave superconductors. This effect can be understood from the non-trivial spatial structure of the d-wave pairing, and mixing of odd and even angular-momentum pairing channels in a rotated frame which untwists the skyrmion texture. Our results inform the feasibility of realizing MZMs with unconventional superconductors in such heterostructures."}

Without a shared understanding of the physical phenomena governing critical currents, progress in this area remains difficult. We propose to analyze existing data using a model that explains most observed features. Although the model proposed by P. Mathieu and Y. Simon was published 20 years ago, it remains relatively unknown among engineers in the field, despite many physicists being convinced of its validity, a consensus not reflected in the literature. The Mathieu Simon (MS) model emphasizes the importance of surface pinning mechanisms, which dominate critical currents across the entire phase diagram of YBaCuO. Unlike strong and weak pinning mechanisms, which are commonly assumed to be dominant, the MS model accurately predicts the order of magnitude of experimentally measured values, suggesting it should at least be considered as the dominant mechanism. The results of calculations based on this model are presented and compared with experimental data, offering directions for the development of new materials."}

Existing machine learning methods for accelerating density-functional theory (DFT) can target the prediction of different quantities and often rely on the locality assumption. Here we train a Gaussian process regression SALTED model exclusively on the electron densities of small displaced bilayer structures and then extrapolate electron density prediction to the large supercells required to describe small twist angles between these bilayers. We show the necessity of long-range descriptors to yield reliable band structures and electrostatic properties of large twisted bilayer structures, when these are derived from predicted densities. We demonstrate that the choice of descriptor determines the distribution of residual density errors, which in turn affects the downstream electronic properties. We apply our models to twisted bilayer graphene, hexagonal boron nitride, and transition metal dichalcogenides, focusing on the model's capacity to predict complex phenomena, including flat band formation, bandwidth narrowing, domain-wall electric fields, and spin-orbit coupling effects. Beyond moiré materials, this approach provides a general methodology for electronic structure prediction in large-scale systems with substantial long-range phenomena related to non-local geometric information."}

While shuttling transforms spatial disorder into time-dependent noise, its net impact on spin coherence remains an open question.

First, by passively reducing magnetic field gradients, we minimize charge-noise coupling to the spin and double the spatially averaged dephasing time $T_2^*(x_n)$ from $4.4$ to $8.5\\,μ\\text{s}$. Next, we exploit motional narrowing by periodically shuttling the qubit, achieving a further enhancement in coherence time up to $T_{2}^{*,sh} = 11.5\\,μ\\text{s}$.

Direct experimental observations of ferroelectric hysteresis and/or ferroelectric domains, and appropriate modelling of stress-induced ferroelectric states in the nanoparticles are absent too. In this work we study the influence of chemical stresses on phase diagrams and polar properties of spherical HfO2 core-shell nanoparticles using the Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire free energy functional with higher powers, trilinear and biquadratic couplings of polar, antipolar and nonpolar order parameters. It appeared that the ferroelectric phase can be reentrant with respect to the size of nanoparticles, because the spontaneous polarization exists in the limited range of core radii R_c, namely R_cr^min<R_c<R_cr^max. The minimal critical radius R_cr^min is mainly determined by the size dependence of the depolarization field and correlation effects. The maximal critical radius R_cr^max is mainly determined by the size dependence of chemical stresses, which are induced by the elastic defects in the shell. Analytical expressions derived for the critical radii can be generalized for hafnium-zirconium oxide nanoparticles, providing that corresponding parameters of the free energy are known from the first principles calculations."}

We introduce a vortex field in the momentum space, which is generated from the spectrum, to characterize the topology of the exceptional rings. This provides a clear physical picture of the topological structure. The two exceptional rings act as two vortex filaments of a free vortex flow with opposite circulations. In this context, the 3D topological semimetal is the boundary separating two quantum phases identified by two configurations of exceptional rings.

While shuttling transforms spatial disorder into time-dependent noise, its net impact on spin coherence remains an open question. Here we demonstrate systematic noise mitigation during spin shuttling in a linear $^{28}$Si/SiGe quantum dot device. First, by passively reducing magnetic field gradients, we minimize charge-noise coupling to the spin and double the spatially averaged dephasing time $T_2^*(x_n)$ from $4.4$ to $8.5\\,μ\\text{s}$. Next, we exploit motional narrowing by periodically shuttling the qubit, achieving a further enhancement in coherence time up to $T_{2}^{*,sh} = 11.5\\,μ\\text{s}$. Finally, we incorporate dynamical decoupling techniques while periodically shuttling over distances exceeding $200\\,\\text{nm}$, reaching $T_\\text{2}^{H,sh}= 32\\,μ\\text{s}$.

By preserving coherence over timescales exceeding typical gate and readout operations, the demonstrated strategies establish mobile spin qubits as a viable solution for scalable silicon quantum processors."}

Thus, our spin simulation has no free parameters or assumed functional form of the disorder, and captures correlation in the defect landscape that would appear in real systems. We calculate a range of exchange interactions between electron pairs, with the smallest values, 0.016 meV and -0.023 meV, being in the range required to act as a two-level system and couple to GHz resonators.

Existing machine learning methods for accelerating density-functional theory (DFT) can target the prediction of different quantities and often rely on the locality assumption. Here we train a Gaussian process regression SALTED model exclusively on the electron densities of small displaced bilayer structures and then extrapolate electron density prediction to the large supercells required to describe small twist angles between these bilayers. We show the necessity of long-range descriptors to yield reliable band structures and electrostatic properties of large twisted bilayer structures, when these are derived from predicted densities. We demonstrate that the choice of descriptor determines the distribution of residual density errors, which in turn affects the downstream electronic properties. We apply our models to twisted bilayer graphene, hexagonal boron nitride, and transition metal dichalcogenides, focusing on the model's capacity to predict complex phenomena, including flat band formation, bandwidth narrowing, domain-wall electric fields, and spin-orbit coupling effects.

This study establishes a quantitative baseline for assessing how structural defects, dopants, or surface functionalization may enhance water adsorption, providing insights for the rational design of graphene-based materials in water purification, sensing, and nanofluidic applications. In this work, we employed density functional theory (DFT) with the vdW-C09 functional to investigate the adsorption of a single water molecule on pristine graphene, accurately accounting for long-range dispersion forces. Three high-symmetry adsorption sites-the center of the hexagonal ring, the C-C bond, and the top site-were explored in combination with three molecular orientations: Down, H-bond, and Up configurations. The calculated adsorption energies range from -93 to -145 meV (milli-electron volts), indicating that the interaction is dominated by weak van der Waals forces characteristic of physisorption. The most stable configuration corresponds to the Down orientation above the center of the hexagonal ring, with an adsorption energy of -145 meV and an equilibrium distance of 3.27 A (angstrom), defined as the vertical separation between the oxygen atom of the water molecule and the graphene plane. These results are in close agreement with previous theoretical studies and confirm the non-reactive and hydrophobic nature of pristine graphene."}

Niobium is commonly used as a structural material in transmon qubits that host Josephson junctions, and excess dissipation anywhere in the transmon can become a bottleneck that limits overall quantum performance. The metal/substrate interfacial layer may simultaneously host pair-breaking loss channels (e.g., two-level systems, TLS) and control thermal transport, thereby affecting dissipation and temperature stability. Here, we use quantitative magneto-optical imaging of the magnetic-flux distribution to characterize the homogeneity of the superconducting state and the critical current density, $j_{c}$, in niobium films fabricated under different sputtering conditions. The imaging reveals distinct flux-penetration regimes, ranging from a nearly ideal Bean critical state to strongly nonuniform thermo-magnetic dendritic avalanches. By fitting the measured magnetic-induction profiles, we extract $j_{c}$ and correlate it with film physical properties and with measured qubit internal quality factors.

The key mechanism is the introduction of moiré potentials for the band-edge carriers induced by the lateral modulation of interlayer interactions. This trapping potential results in the formation of flat bands, which enhances the strong correlation effect. However, a full understanding of the origin of this intriguing potential remains elusive. In this paper, we present a comprehensive investigation of the origin of moiré potentials in both R-type and H-type moiré patterns formed in WS$_2$/WSe$_2$ heterobilayers. We show that both lattice reconstruction and interlayer charge transfer contribute significantly to the formation of moiré potentials. In particular, the lattice reconstruction induces a nonuniform local strain, which creates an energy modulation of 200 meV for the conduction band-edge state located at WS$_2$ layer and 20 meV for the valence band-edge state located at WSe$_2$ layer. In addition, the lattice reconstruction also introduces a piezopotential energy, whose amplitude ranges from 40 meV to 90 meV depending on the stacking and band-edge carrier. The interlayer charge transfer induces a built-in electric field, resulting in an energy modulation of 80 meV for an R-type moiré and 40 meV for an H-type moiré. Taking into account both effects from lattice reconstruction and interlayer charge transfer, the formation of moiré potential is well understood for both R-type and H-type moirés. This trapping potential localizes the wavefunctions of conduction and valence bands around the same moiré site for an R-type moiré, while around different moiré site for an H-type one."}

Surface roughness usually manifests in the early stages of film growth and diminishes beyond a critical thickness. In this work, we employ molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) to grow Sn(100) islands with varying thickness N on bilayer graphene-terminated 6H-SiC(0001) substrates. Scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy measurements reveal an inverse surface roughness effect that highlights the interplay of QSE and misfit strain in shaping the surface morphology of Sn(100) islands. For N =< 10, the islands exhibit flat surfaces, while for N >= 26, the island surfaces become corrugated and patterned. For the intermediate range, i.e., 12 =< N =<24, both flat and patterned surfaces coexist, with the percentage coverage of the patterned surface oscillating as a function of N. By performing density functional theory calculations, we demonstrate that the unusual surface pattern evolution in our MBE-grown Sn(100) islands is a result of the interplay between QSE-induced surface roughing and tensile strain-induced smoothening effect."}

In this work we study the influence of chemical stresses on phase diagrams and polar properties of spherical HfO2 core-shell nanoparticles using the Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire free energy functional with higher powers, trilinear and biquadratic couplings of polar, antipolar and nonpolar order parameters. It appeared that the ferroelectric phase can be reentrant with respect to the size of nanoparticles, because the spontaneous polarization exists in the limited range of core radii R_c, namely R_cr^min<R_c<R_cr^max. The minimal critical radius R_cr^min is mainly determined by the size dependence of the depolarization field and correlation effects. The maximal critical radius R_cr^max is mainly determined by the size dependence of chemical stresses, which are induced by the elastic defects in the shell. Analytical expressions derived for the critical radii can be generalized for hafnium-zirconium oxide nanoparticles, providing that corresponding parameters of the free energy are known from the first principles calculations."}

Electrical transport measurements reveal that a robust anomalous Hall (AH) effect persists down to 2 K and an AH sign reversal occurs near 175 K. By systematically tuning film thickness, growth conditions, and interfacial structure, we demonstrate that the AH response in MnTe films originates from the Berry curvature of surface states rather than from bulk bands. Our first-principles calculations reveal that this surface-state-driven AH effect is imprinted by the bulk altermagnetic order and remains unchanged for terminations with opposite Mn magnetic orientations. Our results establish a unique surface transport probe of bulk altermagnetism, demonstrate interface engineering as an effective route to generate and control the AH effect in altermagnets, and provide a unified understanding of the AH response in altermagentic MnTe films."}

Realizing such states at room temperature and on a macroscopic scale is essential for energy-efficient electronics and quantum technologies, yet remains a fundamental challenge due to material limitations. Here, using microwave impedance microscopy, we directly visualize robust QSH states persisting up to 300 K in α-Bi4Br4 nanowires. This stability and scalability are enabled by a stair stepped stacking configuration, a multilayer geometry in which QSH edge states from individual layers remain spatially decoupled. This configuration circumvents the stringent alignment and layer number constraints of previous proposals, allowing robust stair-stepped QSH (SS-QSH) conduction in structures several micrometers long and hundreds of nanometers high. Magnetic field and temperature dependent measurements confirm their intrinsic topological nature. Crucially, the SS-QSH and bulk signals scale with nanowire height, verifying the stair stepped origin. Our results are also successfully reproduced by finite-element analysis simulations. This work establishes α Bi4Br4 as a practical platform for high temperature topological electronics and demonstrates a generalizable stacking strategy for designing scalable QSH systems."}

Here, we investigate the ANE in epitaxial thin films of the Weyl ferromagnet candidate Fe5Si3. A pronounced transverse Nernst response exceeding approximately 1.50 microvolt per kelvin is observed at room temperature, together with a giant anomalous Nernst angle of about 0.56, indicating highly efficient conversion between thermal gradients and transverse electric fields. Beyond the anomalous contribution, a sizable topological Nernst signal of approximately 0.43 microvolt per kelvin persists above room temperature, suggesting the possible presence of real-space Berry curvature associated with nontrivial spin textures. First-principles density functional theory calculations combined with symmetry analysis reveal an unconventional electronic structure in which Weyl nodal lines, nodal surfaces, and nearly flat bands coexist near the Fermi level. This rare concurrence of multiple topological band features produces a strongly enhanced and sharply energy-dependent Berry curvature, which governs both the magnitude and temperature evolution of the observed Nernst response. The close quantitative agreement between calculated anomalous Nernst conductivity and experimental results establishes the topological electronic structure as the dominant origin of the observed thermomagnetic transport, highlighting Fe5Si3 as a chemically simple, low-cost binary topological magnet for exploring both real-space and momentum-space Berry-curvature-driven thermoelectric phenomena."}

We obtain general microscopic expressions for the orbital magnetization in the presence of strain, as well as the orbital piezomagnetic polarizability, i.e., the defining response characteristic of pure altermagnets. We apply these expressions to three specific tetragonal lattice models, two corresponding to $d$-wave altermagnets and one describing a $g$-wave altermagnet. Whereas the $d$-wave altermagnets are associated with a linear piezomagnetic polarizability, the $g$-wave altermagnet exhibits a nonlinear piezomagnetic effect. Our analysis reveals how the polarizabilities are related to and determined by the Berry curvature of the occupied bands. Connections to materials of current interest are discussed."}

To establish a concrete theoretical foundation for understanding and utilizing these materials, we investigate six representative members of the V2Se2O-family and construct a realistic tight-binding model parameterized by first-principles calculations, which is benchmarked by experimental measurements.

First, we compute corrections to the strong coupling (i.e., double-exchange) spin wave dispersion of itinerant ferromagnets. We show that the spin wave dispersion beyond the strong coupling limit can be mapped to the spin wave dispersion of a Heisenberg ferromagnet with farther neighbor exchange couplings, and discuss how this affects instabilities towards antiferromagnetism. Second, we examine the effect of including electronic spin-orbit coupling in the spin wave theory of Kondo ferromagnets. Including spin-orbit coupling is natural and straightforward in the formulation of the canonical spin wave expansion. Our key result is to demonstrate that the linear spin wave Hamiltonian of the itinerant Kondo ferromagnet can be mapped to the spin wave Hamiltonian of a Heisenberg ferromagnet with easy-axis Ising anisotropy and antisymmetric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya exchange interaction. We show that in the case of the Kane-Mele honeycomb lattice Kondo ferromagnet this leads to topological magnon bands, and discuss the implications of this result for itinerant ferromagnets more broadly."}

Using determinant quantum Monte Carlo, we find that increasing the coupling drives an abrupt, first-order transition from a Chern insulator to a staggered charge-density wave that acts as a dynamical sublattice (Semenoff) mass. The transition is simultaneously signaled by a nearly quantized many-body Bott index and a real-space local Chern marker constructed from the interacting Green's function, both of which collapse as the charge order parameter becomes extensive. Spectral and open-boundary calculations reveal concomitant gap closing and the loss of boundary spectral weight at the critical coupling. Despite the generic phase problem induced by broken time-reversal symmetry, we show that it remains mild in the low-frequency regime and that the average phase factor sharply tracks the CI-CDW boundary. Our results establish a concrete route by which electron-phonon coupling can trigger a discontinuous collapse of Chern topology and provide experimentally relevant signatures for correlated topological platforms."}

Theoretically, half of the observed value can be attributed to the exchange enhancement of SOS in a finite-density electron gas, but explaining the rest requires refining the DFT approach. As the conduction band SOS in MoS$_2$ is set by a delicate balance between the contribution of sulphur $p_x$ and $p_y$ orbitals and $d_{z^2}-d_{xz}$ and $d_{z^2}-d_{yz}$ mixing in molybdenum, we use a DFT+U+V framework for fine-tuning the orbital composition of the relevant band-edge states.

In this work, we employ molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) to grow Sn(100) islands with varying thickness N on bilayer graphene-terminated 6H-SiC(0001) substrates. Scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy measurements reveal an inverse surface roughness effect that highlights the interplay of QSE and misfit strain in shaping the surface morphology of Sn(100) islands. For N =< 10, the islands exhibit flat surfaces, while for N >= 26, the island surfaces become corrugated and patterned. For the intermediate range, i.e., 12 =< N =<24, both flat and patterned surfaces coexist, with the percentage coverage of the patterned surface oscillating as a function of N. By performing density functional theory calculations, we demonstrate that the unusual surface pattern evolution in our MBE-grown Sn(100) islands is a result of the interplay between QSE-induced surface roughing and tensile strain-induced smoothening effect."}

In this work we study the influence of chemical stresses on phase diagrams and polar properties of spherical HfO2 core-shell nanoparticles using the Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire free energy functional with higher powers, trilinear and biquadratic couplings of polar, antipolar and nonpolar order parameters. It appeared that the ferroelectric phase can be reentrant with respect to the size of nanoparticles, because the spontaneous polarization exists in the limited range of core radii R_c, namely R_cr^min<R_c<R_cr^max. The minimal critical radius R_cr^min is mainly determined by the size dependence of the depolarization field and correlation effects. The maximal critical radius R_cr^max is mainly determined by the size dependence of chemical stresses, which are induced by the elastic defects in the shell.

Here, we propose spiral magnets, where even a small cavity-mediated change in magnetic interactions is reflected in a change of the spiral wavelength, as a promising platform to observe cavity effects. We focus on the single-layer multiferroic NiI$_2$, interacting with electric field fluctuations from surface phonon polaritons of the paraelectric substrate SrTiO$_3$.

Despite its direct consequences for nanomaterial design, this frontier has never been systematically measured. We introduce RADII, a radius-resolved benchmark of ${\\sim}$75,000 nanoparticle structures (55-11,298 atoms) that treats radius as a continuous scaling knob to trace generation quality from in-distribution to out-of-distribution regimes under leakage-free splits. RADII provides frontier-specific diagnostics: per-radius error profiles pinpoint each architecture's scaling ceiling, surface-interior decomposition tests whether failures originate at boundaries or in bulk, and cross-metric failure sequencing reveals which aspect of structural fidelity breaks first. Benchmarking five state-of-the-art architectures, we find that: (i) all models degrade by ${\\sim}13\\%$ in global positional error beyond training radii, yet local bond fidelity diverges wildly across architectures -- from near-zero to over $2\\times$ collapse; (ii) no two architectures share the same failure sequence, revealing the frontier as a multi-dimensional surface shaped by model family; and (iii) well-behaved models obey a power-law scaling exponent $α\\approx 1/3$ whose in-distribution fit accurately predicts out-of-distribution error, making their frontiers quantitatively forecastable. These findings establish output scale as a first-class evaluation axis for geometric generative models. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/KurbanIntelligenceLab/RADII."}

Here, we report a new setting for superconductivity in the ferromagnetic Kondo-lattice material Ce5CoGe2, where there is a ferromagnetic ground state at ambient pressure, which evolves to antiferromagnetism under applied pressures. The antiferromagnetic transition is suppressed to a zero-temperature QCP, which is accompanied by strange-metal behavior.

By distinguishing contributions from individual orbitals, our results validate the two-level system approximation and also emphasize that the first-principles approach agrees better with experimental results for light-driven residual current, especially in extremely strong fields. Furthermore, our 3D model reveals that the real-space atomic-scale current induced by strong laser fields is concentrated slightly above and below the graphene basal plane, rather than strictly within it. The two oppositely directed currents exhibit a pronounced height separation in the out-of-plane direction, indicating that the ring current is not confined to the graphene plane but forms a rotating 3D circulation loop which is absent in the reduced-dimensional model."}

Using determinant quantum Monte Carlo, we find that increasing the coupling drives an abrupt, first-order transition from a Chern insulator to a staggered charge-density wave that acts as a dynamical sublattice (Semenoff) mass. The transition is simultaneously signaled by a nearly quantized many-body Bott index and a real-space local Chern marker constructed from the interacting Green's function, both of which collapse as the charge order parameter becomes extensive. Spectral and open-boundary calculations reveal concomitant gap closing and the loss of boundary spectral weight at the critical coupling. Despite the generic phase problem induced by broken time-reversal symmetry, we show that it remains mild in the low-frequency regime and that the average phase factor sharply tracks the CI-CDW boundary.

Doping N can substantially enhance the yield strength but often leads to a decreased ductility, revealing a strength-ductility trade-off phenomenon. Here, we simultaneously enhance the strength and ductility in a non-equiatomic CrMnFeCoNi high-entropy alloy via N alloying and unravel the underlying microscopic mechanisms. The N-doped alloy (1 at.% N) shows an excellent combination of higher yield strength (104% increase) and larger ductility (38% increase), with a two-stage strain hardening behavior, compared to the N-free alloy. Detailed transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis reveals that N-doping introduces short-range order (SRO) domains within the microstructure, leads to pronounced planar slip, and promotes the formation of nano-spaced (6-15 nm) stacking faults and deformation twins. Continuous generation and interaction of the fine-spaced SFs act as a strong barrier for dislocation movement and provide ample room for dislocation storage. The interaction of SRO with dislocations and the evolution of SFs ascribe to the first strain hardening stage, and the disordering of the SRO along with the activation of deformation twins are attributed to the second strain hardening stage. Our work shows that N-doping is effective in simultaneously improving the strength-ductility synergy and provides novel insights into alloy design with slightly elevating the SFE, and manipulating the ordered structure within the HEA."}

Here, we investigate the ANE in epitaxial thin films of the Weyl ferromagnet candidate Fe5Si3. A pronounced transverse Nernst response exceeding approximately 1.50 microvolt per kelvin is observed at room temperature, together with a giant anomalous Nernst angle of about 0.56, indicating highly efficient conversion between thermal gradients and transverse electric fields. Beyond the anomalous contribution, a sizable topological Nernst signal of approximately 0.43 microvolt per kelvin persists above room temperature, suggesting the possible presence of real-space Berry curvature associated with nontrivial spin textures. First-principles density functional theory calculations combined with symmetry analysis reveal an unconventional electronic structure in which Weyl nodal lines, nodal surfaces, and nearly flat bands coexist near the Fermi level. This rare concurrence of multiple topological band features produces a strongly enhanced and sharply energy-dependent Berry curvature, which governs both the magnitude and temperature evolution of the observed Nernst response. The close quantitative agreement between calculated anomalous Nernst conductivity and experimental results establishes the topological electronic structure as the dominant origin of the observed thermomagnetic transport, highlighting Fe5Si3 as a chemically simple, low-cost binary topological magnet for exploring both real-space and momentum-space Berry-curvature-driven thermoelectric phenomena."}

Surface roughness usually manifests in the early stages of film growth and diminishes beyond a critical thickness. In this work, we employ molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) to grow Sn(100) islands with varying thickness N on bilayer graphene-terminated 6H-SiC(0001) substrates. Scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy measurements reveal an inverse surface roughness effect that highlights the interplay of QSE and misfit strain in shaping the surface morphology of Sn(100) islands. For N =< 10, the islands exhibit flat surfaces, while for N >= 26, the island surfaces become corrugated and patterned. For the intermediate range, i.e., 12 =< N =<24, both flat and patterned surfaces coexist, with the percentage coverage of the patterned surface oscillating as a function of N. By performing density functional theory calculations, we demonstrate that the unusual surface pattern evolution in our MBE-grown Sn(100) islands is a result of the interplay between QSE-induced surface roughing and tensile strain-induced smoothening effect."}

To establish a concrete theoretical foundation for understanding and utilizing these materials, we investigate six representative members of the V2Se2O-family and construct a realistic tight-binding model parameterized by first-principles calculations, which is benchmarked by experimental measurements. This model accurately captures essential altermagnetic electronic properties, including CSML and noncollinear spin-conserved currents.

Through a statistical analysis and numerical simulations, we identify and verify the existence of three distinct failure regimes: (i) disorder is effectively suppressed, (ii) disorder manifests locally near the crack tip, modifying the crack morphology, and (iii) disorder manifests globally, leading to initially diffuse failure. Our model naturally reveals the key parameters governing this behavior: the Weibull modulus, quantifying the spread in failure thresholds, and a geometric quantity termed the Slenderness Ratio. We also reproduce the disorder-induced toughening reported in previous experimental and numerical studies, further demonstrating that its manifestation depends non-monotonically on disorder. Crucially, our results indicate that this toughening cannot be simply connected to the amount of damage in the lattice, challenging interpretations that attribute increased fracture energy solely to enhanced crack tortuosity or diffuse failure. Overall, our results establish geometry as a powerful control parameter for regulating how disorder is expressed during fracture in beam-lattices, with broader implications for the disorder-induced toughening in engineered materials."}

These spin systems can feature complex dynamics, including a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition, that depend on the lattice, interactions, external fields, and disorder. However, the disorder included in typical models is not materials-specific, diminishing the ability to accurately capture measured flux noise phenomena. We present a first principles-based simulation of a spin lattice consisting of paramagnetic O$_2$ molecules on an Al$_2$O$_3$ surface, a likely flux noise source in superconducting qubits, to elucidate opportunities to mitigate flux noise. We simulate an ensemble of surface adsorbates with disordered orientations and calculate the orientation-dependent exchange couplings using density functional theory. Thus, our spin simulation has no free parameters or assumed functional form of the disorder, and captures correlation in the defect landscape that would appear in real systems. We calculate a range of exchange interactions between electron pairs, with the smallest values, 0.016 meV and -0.023 meV, being in the range required to act as a two-level system and couple to GHz resonators. We calculate the flux noise frequency, temperature, and applied external magnetic field dependence, as well as the susceptibility-flux noise cross-correlation. Calculated trends agree with experiment, demonstrating that a surface harboring paramagnetic adsorbates arranged with materials-specific disorder and interactions captures the various properties of magnetic flux noise observed in superconducting circuits. In addition, we find that an external electric field can tune the spin-spin interaction strength and reduce magnetic flux noise."}

Non-coplanar spin textures in these systems have been realized only in low temperature spin-glass states or at interfaces with heavy metals. Here, we report an intrinsic non-coplanar spin configuration persisting up to 400 K in cubic-phase Mn3Ge, originating from coexisting symmetric and antisymmetric exchange interactions. Competing magnetic states associated with this non-coplanar spin configuration give rise to an unconventional AHE with a magnetic-field-induced sign reversal and a hump-like feature.

Existing machine learning methods for accelerating density-functional theory (DFT) can target the prediction of different quantities and often rely on the locality assumption. Here we train a Gaussian process regression SALTED model exclusively on the electron densities of small displaced bilayer structures and then extrapolate electron density prediction to the large supercells required to describe small twist angles between these bilayers. We show the necessity of long-range descriptors to yield reliable band structures and electrostatic properties of large twisted bilayer structures, when these are derived from predicted densities. We demonstrate that the choice of descriptor determines the distribution of residual density errors, which in turn affects the downstream electronic properties. We apply our models to twisted bilayer graphene, hexagonal boron nitride, and transition metal dichalcogenides, focusing on the model's capacity to predict complex phenomena, including flat band formation, bandwidth narrowing, domain-wall electric fields, and spin-orbit coupling effects.

The data are consistent with a two-band Drude model, which allows the decomposition of the intraband response into distinct contributions. One is from a \"narrow\" Drude term which we associate with electron bands, and the other a \"broad\" Drude term linked to the hole band with strong correlations. Increasing Sr doping leads to an expansion of the hole band spectral weight, and a corresponding reduction in the electron band, indicative of the multiband electronic structure and a doping-dependent reconstruction of the Fermi surface. Both doping and temperature-dependent optical spectra display significant spectral weight transfer from high to low energy, a hallmark of strong electronic correlations.

Without a shared understanding of the physical phenomena governing critical currents, progress in this area remains difficult. We propose to analyze existing data using a model that explains most observed features. Although the model proposed by P. Mathieu and Y. Simon was published 20 years ago, it remains relatively unknown among engineers in the field, despite many physicists being convinced of its validity, a consensus not reflected in the literature. The Mathieu Simon (MS) model emphasizes the importance of surface pinning mechanisms, which dominate critical currents across the entire phase diagram of YBaCuO. Unlike strong and weak pinning mechanisms, which are commonly assumed to be dominant, the MS model accurately predicts the order of magnitude of experimentally measured values, suggesting it should at least be considered as the dominant mechanism. The results of calculations based on this model are presented and compared with experimental data, offering directions for the development of new materials."}

Although recent experiments have demonstrated dark cavity effects for electronic material phases, like superconductivity, ferroelectricity and charge density waves, a smoking gun experiment for magnetic systems is lacking.

Here, we propose spiral magnets, where even a small cavity-mediated change in magnetic interactions is reflected in a change of the spiral wavelength, as a promising platform to observe cavity effects. We focus on the single-layer multiferroic NiI$_2$, interacting with electric field fluctuations from surface phonon polaritons of the paraelectric substrate SrTiO$_3$. With decreasing substrate-material distance, the ratio of nearest and third nearest neighbor exchange interactions reduces, leading to an increase of the spiral wavelength and an eventual transition into a ferromagnetic state.

Here, using microwave impedance microscopy, we directly visualize robust QSH states persisting up to 300 K in α-Bi4Br4 nanowires. This stability and scalability are enabled by a stair stepped stacking configuration, a multilayer geometry in which QSH edge states from individual layers remain spatially decoupled.

Realizing such states at room temperature and on a macroscopic scale is essential for energy-efficient electronics and quantum technologies, yet remains a fundamental challenge due to material limitations. Here, using microwave impedance microscopy, we directly visualize robust QSH states persisting up to 300 K in α-Bi4Br4 nanowires. This stability and scalability are enabled by a stair stepped stacking configuration, a multilayer geometry in which QSH edge states from individual layers remain spatially decoupled. This configuration circumvents the stringent alignment and layer number constraints of previous proposals, allowing robust stair-stepped QSH (SS-QSH) conduction in structures several micrometers long and hundreds of nanometers high. Magnetic field and temperature dependent measurements confirm their intrinsic topological nature. Crucially, the SS-QSH and bulk signals scale with nanowire height, verifying the stair stepped origin. Our results are also successfully reproduced by finite-element analysis simulations. This work establishes α Bi4Br4 as a practical platform for high temperature topological electronics and demonstrates a generalizable stacking strategy for designing scalable QSH systems."}

Here, we simultaneously enhance the strength and ductility in a non-equiatomic CrMnFeCoNi high-entropy alloy via N alloying and unravel the underlying microscopic mechanisms. The N-doped alloy (1 at.% N) shows an excellent combination of higher yield strength (104% increase) and larger ductility (38% increase), with a two-stage strain hardening behavior, compared to the N-free alloy. Detailed transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis reveals that N-doping introduces short-range order (SRO) domains within the microstructure, leads to pronounced planar slip, and promotes the formation of nano-spaced (6-15 nm) stacking faults and deformation twins. Continuous generation and interaction of the fine-spaced SFs act as a strong barrier for dislocation movement and provide ample room for dislocation storage. The interaction of SRO with dislocations and the evolution of SFs ascribe to the first strain hardening stage, and the disordering of the SRO along with the activation of deformation twins are attributed to the second strain hardening stage. Our work shows that N-doping is effective in simultaneously improving the strength-ductility synergy and provides novel insights into alloy design with slightly elevating the SFE, and manipulating the ordered structure within the HEA."}

The derived thermophysical descriptors corroborate a pressure-stiffened lattice: density increases, Debye temperature rises, melting temperature is elevated and minimum thermal conductivity increases, whereas the Grüneisen parameter remains within a narrow window, suggesting no anomalous anharmonic softening. Bond population metrics and electron-density-difference analysis revealed a mixed metallic-covalent bonding picture dominated by a robust Ta-Ta metallic backbone, accompanied by pressure-strengthened Ta-Se hybridization. Electronic-structure calculations show persistent metallicity under compression; pressure broadens bands, reduces density of states at the Fermi level, reshapes the Fermi surface and points to a possible Lifshitz-type reconstruction without symmetry breaking. The optical response remained metallic with Drude-like low-energy behavior and pressure-tunable spectral features. The phonon dispersions exhibit no imaginary modes, confirming dynamical stability.

Through a statistical analysis and numerical simulations, we identify and verify the existence of three distinct failure regimes: (i) disorder is effectively suppressed, (ii) disorder manifests locally near the crack tip, modifying the crack morphology, and (iii) disorder manifests globally, leading to initially diffuse failure. Our model naturally reveals the key parameters governing this behavior: the Weibull modulus, quantifying the spread in failure thresholds, and a geometric quantity termed the Slenderness Ratio. We also reproduce the disorder-induced toughening reported in previous experimental and numerical studies, further demonstrating that its manifestation depends non-monotonically on disorder. Crucially, our results indicate that this toughening cannot be simply connected to the amount of damage in the lattice, challenging interpretations that attribute increased fracture energy solely to enhanced crack tortuosity or diffuse failure. Overall, our results establish geometry as a powerful control parameter for regulating how disorder is expressed during fracture in beam-lattices, with broader implications for the disorder-induced toughening in engineered materials."}

In this work, we study the impact of dissipation on the nodal ring in a 3D topological semimetal. We find that the energy spectrum becomes fully complex in the presence of dissipation, and the original nodal ring is split into two exceptional rings. We introduce a vortex field in the momentum space, which is generated from the spectrum, to characterize the topology of the exceptional rings. This provides a clear physical picture of the topological structure. The two exceptional rings act as two vortex filaments of a free vortex flow with opposite circulations. In this context, the 3D topological semimetal is the boundary separating two quantum phases identified by two configurations of exceptional rings. We also propose a 1D model that has the same topological feature in the parameter space. It provides a simple way to measure the topological invariant in a low-dimensional system.

We report the growth of LaBi$_2$ with a pristine layer-by-layer growth mode, classifying it as a good metal displaying superconductivity at $\\sim$0.55~K. Compared to LaSb$_2$, we attribute the enhanced metallic behavior and improved growth dynamics of LaBi$_2$ to significant relativistic corrections to its electronic band structure and the resulting impact on both surface energy and intrinsic phonon scattering."}

However, there are many experimental examples of three-dimensional crystals that could host exotic low-temperature states of matter, such as quantum spin liquids. We calculate the ground-state phase diagrams of frustrated quantum spin models on the body-centered cubic lattice using neural quantum states. First, we study the antiferromagnetic $J_1-J_2$ model where we find a direct first-order phase transition between Néel and collinear long-range-ordered phases at $(J_2/J_1)_c = 0.705$, consistent with previous studies. Then, in a tetragonally-distorted variant, proposed as a minimal model of NaCa$_2$Cu$_2$(VO$_4$)$_3$, we find no evidence of a quantum paramagnetic ground state, with a first-order phase transition between Néel and chain phases at $(J_{2ab}/J_1)_c = 1.0375$. Therefore, the ground state of the tetragonally-distorted model does not reproduce the low-temperature magnetic properties of NaCa$_2$Cu$_2$(VO$_4$)$_3$, and the inclusion of other effects is necessary to rationalize experimental observations."}

Niobium is commonly used as a structural material in transmon qubits that host Josephson junctions, and excess dissipation anywhere in the transmon can become a bottleneck that limits overall quantum performance. The metal/substrate interfacial layer may simultaneously host pair-breaking loss channels (e.g., two-level systems, TLS) and control thermal transport, thereby affecting dissipation and temperature stability. Here, we use quantitative magneto-optical imaging of the magnetic-flux distribution to characterize the homogeneity of the superconducting state and the critical current density, $j_{c}$, in niobium films fabricated under different sputtering conditions. The imaging reveals distinct flux-penetration regimes, ranging from a nearly ideal Bean critical state to strongly nonuniform thermo-magnetic dendritic avalanches. By fitting the measured magnetic-induction profiles, we extract $j_{c}$ and correlate it with film physical properties and with measured qubit internal quality factors. Our results indicate that the Nb/Si interlayer can be a significant contributor to decoherence and should be considered an important factor that must be optimized."}

The approach relies on a finite element model whose input material parameters are extracted either from ab initio or from machine-learned empirical calculations. The applied techniques range from molecular dynamics and nudged elastic band to electronic and thermal quantum transport. Such an approach drastically reduces the number of fitting parameters needed and makes the resulting modeling environment more accurate than traditional ones. The developed computational framework is then applied to the investigation of an Ag/a-SiO2/Pt CBRAM, reproducing experimental data very well. Moreover, the relevance of Joule heating is assessed by considering various cell geometries. It is found that self-heating manifests itself in devices with thin conductive filaments with few-nanometer diameters and at current concentrations in the 10s-microampere range. With the proposed methodology it is now possible to explore the potential of not-yet fabricated memory cells and to reliably optimize their design."}

Here we introduce PySlice, the first publicly available implementation of the Time Autocorrelation of Auxiliary Wavefunction (TACAW) method, providing an automated framework that produces momentum- and energy-resolved vibrational electron energy-loss spectra directly from atomic structures. By integrating universal machine learning interatomic potentials with TACAW, PySlice eliminates the bottleneck of per-system potential development. Users input atomic structures and obtain phonon dispersions, spectral diffraction patterns, and spectrum images through a unified workflow spanning molecular dynamics, GPU-accelerated electron scattering, and frequency-domain analysis. We outline the formulation behind the code, demonstrate its application to canonical systems in materials science, and discuss its use for advanced analysis and materials exploration. The modular Python architecture additionally supports conventional electron microscopy simulations, providing a general-purpose platform for imaging and diffraction calculations. PySlice makes vibrational spectroscopy prediction routine rather than specialized, enabling computational screening for experimental design, systematic exploration of phonon physics across materials families, and high-throughput generation of simulated data for training of future machine learning models."}

Previous work motivated by the piezomagnetic properties of altermagnets has primarily focused on the spin magnetization response to applied strain. In this paper we study orbital piezomagnetic effects--the orbital magnetization response to applied strain--in minimal lattice models of pure insulating altermagnets in two dimensions. We obtain general microscopic expressions for the orbital magnetization in the presence of strain, as well as the orbital piezomagnetic polarizability, i.e., the defining response characteristic of pure altermagnets. We apply these expressions to three specific tetragonal lattice models, two corresponding to $d$-wave altermagnets and one describing a $g$-wave altermagnet. Whereas the $d$-wave altermagnets are associated with a linear piezomagnetic polarizability, the $g$-wave altermagnet exhibits a nonlinear piezomagnetic effect. Our analysis reveals how the polarizabilities are related to and determined by the Berry curvature of the occupied bands. Connections to materials of current interest are discussed."}

Companion paper to arXiv:2408.16665", "summary": "In this paper we apply the canonical spin wave theory developed for itinerant Kondo lattice magnets in the strong coupling regime to Kondo ferromagnets, and address two general questions pertaining to their magnetic excitations. First, we compute corrections to the strong coupling (i.e., double-exchange) spin wave dispersion of itinerant ferromagnets. We show that the spin wave dispersion beyond the strong coupling limit can be mapped to the spin wave dispersion of a Heisenberg ferromagnet with farther neighbor exchange couplings, and discuss how this affects instabilities towards antiferromagnetism. Second, we examine the effect of including electronic spin-orbit coupling in the spin wave theory of Kondo ferromagnets. Including spin-orbit coupling is natural and straightforward in the formulation of the canonical spin wave expansion. Our key result is to demonstrate that the linear spin wave Hamiltonian of the itinerant Kondo ferromagnet can be mapped to the spin wave Hamiltonian of a Heisenberg ferromagnet with easy-axis Ising anisotropy and antisymmetric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya exchange interaction. We show that in the case of the Kane-Mele honeycomb lattice Kondo ferromagnet this leads to topological magnon bands, and discuss the implications of this result for itinerant ferromagnets more broadly."}

Using neural quantum states (NQS), and in particular Gutzwiller-projected Hidden Fermion Pfaffian State, we access the ground-state properties on large lattices up to $8\\times 8\\times 2$ sites. We show that this model exhibits superconductivity across a wide range of dopings and couplings, and analyze the pairing behavior in detail. We identify a crossover from tightly bound, Bose-Einstein-condensed interlayer pairs at strong interlayer exchange to more spatially extended Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer-like pairs as the interlayer exchange is decreased. Furthermore, upon tuning the intralayer exchange, we observe a sharp transition from interlayer $s$-wave pairing to intralayer $d$-wave pairing, consistent with a first-order change in the pairing symmetry. We verify that our simulations are accurate by comparing with matrix product state simulations on coupled ladders. Our results represent the first simulation of a fermionic multi-orbital system with NQS, and provide the first evidence for superconductivity in two-dimensonal bilayers using high-precision numerics. These findings provide insight into superconductivity in bilayer nickelates and cold atom quantum simulation platforms."}

However, the crystal surface has a reduced symmetry with respect to the bulk, which can induce AM at the surface of conventional antiferromagnets (AFMs) -- a local effect which cannot be detected using bulk properties. In this work we define the symmetry conditions necessary for surface AM and show how it can be topologically protected, rendering it a robust effect. We provide a minimal model for one trivial and two topological examples of surface AM. We show that the spin spectral density, accessible by spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, can exhibit a $d$-wave-like altermagnetic character at the surface, even when the full band structure is completely spin degenerate. Our topological model describes the Dirac semimetal CuMnAs, which provides an existing realization of our theory. Our results identify crystal surfaces as a platform to realize robust, topology- and symmetry-driven unconventional magnetism beyond the bulk classification of magnetic materials."}

This work presents a complete model for phase-field fracture for coupled thermo-mechanical problems, wherein the bulk material properties, the material strength, and the fracture toughness are specified independently. The capabilities of the model are assessed across a wide span of scenarios in thermo-mechanical fracture, from the propagation of large pre-existing cracks to crack nucleation under spatially uniform states of stress. In particular, we revisit the controlled quenching of glass plates, and demonstrate how the model captures experimentally observed crack patterns across a range of thermal loads. Ceramic disks subjected to infrared radiation are also examined, with the model reproducing both straight cracks in notched specimens and branching in intact specimens. Finally, ceramic pellets subjected to rapid power pulses are examined, with the model explaining experimental transitions from intact to fractured pellets and the important role of material strength. The results demonstrate that the complete phase-field model unifies the treatment of distinct fracture scenarios under thermal shock, surpassing classical approaches and enabling more reliable prediction of brittle fracture in extreme environments."}

When the enzymatic depolymerisation temperature exceeds the glass transition temperature, these spherulites tend to grow. The depolymerisation process is thus controlled by a competition between erosion of the amorphous matrix from the particle surface and the growth of recalcitrant spherulites within the particle bulk and at its surface. We present a geometric model that captures this competition, together with an algorithm to solve the equations numerically. Our algorithm introduces a new extension of Voronoi/Delaunay tessellation in space. We extract the parameters for the model from experimental data on the enzymatic depolymerization by hydrolase LCC-ICCG of PET bottle flakes and textile waste, in order to make a prediction of the observed degradation yield as a function of time. Both the final yield and the degradation kinetics are correctly predicted. Most importantly, the model clarifies how and to which extent nucleating agents, impurities, additives, and/or rapid crystal growth present in the waste can undermine pretreatment efforts aiming to initiate depolymerisation from a material with a low initial crystallinity."}
