Here, we report the atomic structure of the Ag and Li interface, showing that Li preferentially plates as FCC on both the (111) and (100) Ag surfaces. This forms an energetically favorable coherent interface with Ag, while the BCC phase forms a semi-coherent interface due to large lattice mismatch. We also calculate vacancy formation energies and migration energies for Li diffusion through the interface. We show that vacancy formation energies increase at the interface, leading to an energetic driving force for vacancies to diffuse away from the interface. Additionally, the migration barriers for vacancies from the Ag to the Li are small (29 meV), and therefore promote rapid alloying between Ag and Li. Rapid Li diffusion kinetics directly at the interface leads to smooth deposition of Li, reducing the onset of dendrites. However, diffusion in the 2nd and 3rd Li layers is slower compared to bulk FCC or BCC Li, leading to kinetically hindered alloying when multiple layers of pure Li form. The diffusion kinetics for Ag nanoparticles may be improved by alloying with Mg to expand the Ag lattice constant while forming a solid solution with both Ag and Li."}

This mechanism and phenomena are dubbed magnetic topological mechanics, or, magnetopological mechanics in short. Focusing on a two-dimensional kagomé lattice spin model, we illustrate how strong spin-lattice coupling drives a spontaneous lattice distortion, resulting in the topological Maxwell lattice with the topological polarization and non-trivial phonon spectra. Moreover, the magnetic field, that directly changes the spin state, indirectly influences the lattice structure via the spin-lattice coupling, thereby providing a method to control the Maxwell lattice and the boundary modes.

We show that breaking time-reversal symmetry alone does not imply non-reciprocal transport or a non-Hermitian conductance matrix. Instead, non-Hermitian topology arises only when transport becomes directionally imbalanced. We identify two distinct mechanisms that generate such a response: spin-selective coupling at the contacts and an out-of-plane Zeeman field that unbalances the counter-propagating helical edge modes. We show, for unpolarized leads, that the spin polarization-dependent response to Zeeman fields, provides a transport-based probe of the intrinsic spin polarization of the helical edge states. Moreover, we demonstrate that non-Hermitian skin effect is more sensitive than conductance elements to detect the spin polarization of the edge states. Our results clarify the conditions required for non-Hermitian topology in quantum spin-Hall transport and establish non-Hermitian skin effect as a diagnostic tool for spin-selective coupling and edge-state polarization."}

At present, there is strong interest in materials with strongly coupled structural and electronic phase transitions, which hold promise for energy-efficient technologies. Utilizing a structural phase transition and controlling its plasticity naturally leads to built-in memory, a key feature for emulating neurons and synapses in neuromorphic technologies. Here, $\\textit{operando}$ Bragg X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy is used to study the evolution of the nano-domain distribution at the micron-scale in neuromorphic devices made from the archetypal Mott insulator vanadium dioxide. It is found that after electrical switching, slow nano-domain reconfiguration occurs on timescales of thousands of seconds and that the domains undergo a jamming transition, offering control over switching stochasticity at the micron scale. More precisely, repetitive above-threshold currents plastically drive the system into a jammed/glassy state where switching becomes deterministic, while sub-threshold currents erase the short-term memory contained in the nano-domain distribution, recovering stochastic switching, thus offering a path for in-device learning. The results illustrate the importance of studying the nanoscale physics associated with phase transitions in strongly correlated materials, even for macroscopic devices, and offer guidance for future device operation schemes."}

Here, we report spatiotemporally resolved structural dynamics in the van der Waals ferroelectric NbOI2 using combined ultrafast electron microscopy and diffraction. Above-band-gap photoexcitation rapidly screens the in-plane polarization and heats the lattice, launching three coherent acoustic phonons: two transverse shear modes and one longitudinal breathing mode. The transverse mode that shears the layers perpendicular to the in-plane polar axis dominates over that along the polar axis, reflecting anisotropic coupling between polarization and strain. Spatially resolved measurements further reveal spatially correlated heterogeneity in the mode amplitudes and lifetimes. Regions dominated by a single shear mode exhibit significantly longer lifetime of acoustic oscillations than that of multimode regions, suggesting that acoustic phonon-phonon scattering is a major source of decoherence. Our results provide a microscopic understanding of polarization-strain coupling and spatially heterogeneous energy dissipation in van der Waals ferroelectrics under ultrafast excitation."}

In the flat-band limit, we establish an upper and lower Wiedemann-Franz-type bound for the ratio of thermal Meissner stiffness and electric Meissner stiffness (superfluid weight), whose prefactors are provided by the extrema of the squared energy offsets of the outer single-particle bands of the system. Similarly to the superfluid weight, this also leads to a lower bound of the thermal Meissner stiffness in terms of the Chern number. Our results apply to both superconductors and other fermionic superfluids."}

This empirical rule, however, fails in systems where internal degrees of freedom - such as structural or electronic order - play a central role. Here, we demonstrate that friction can emerge entirely from magnetically driven configurational dynamics in the absence of physical contact. Using a two-dimensional array of rotatable magnetic dipoles sliding over a commensurate magnetic substrate, we observe a pronounced non-monotonic dependence of friction on the interlayer separation, and thus on the effective load. The friction peaks at an intermediate distance where competing ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions induce dynamical frustration and hysteretic torque cycles during sliding. Molecular dynamics simulations and a simplified two-sublattice model confirm that energy dissipation is governed by collective magnetic reorientations and their hysteresis. Our results establish the occurrence of sliding-induced changes in collective magnetic order, which has a strong impact on friction, and thus open new possibilities for contactless friction control, magnetic sensing, and the design of reconfigurable, wear-free frictional interfaces and metamaterials."}

In this work, we propose van der Waals heterostructures of stripe antiferromagnets (sAFMs) as an ideal platform for electrically controllable $p$-wave magnetism. In the sAFM/metal/sAFM structure, the leading RKKY-type exchange interaction is canceled due to the symmetry of the stacking pattern. This exposes a higher-order biquadratic interaction as a dominant contribution that drives a filling-controlled transition from a collinear phase to an orthogonal $p$-wave configuration. The resulting $p$-wave phase exhibits a gate-tunable Edelstein response, which originates from magnetic symmetry breaking rather than conventional relativistic spin-momentum locking and remains robust even under substantial spin-orbit coupling. Finally, we propose material candidates for the realization of our theory.

Conventional quantum oscillation techniques, typically used for this purpose, are inapplicable in this high-temperature regime due to thermal and disorder-induced smearing of Landau levels. We propose Sondheimer oscillations (SO), semiclassical oscillations of in-plane magnetoresistivity in thin films, as a robust alternative probe of FS reconstruction. SO arise from the commensuration between the cyclotron radius and film thickness, do not rely on Landau quantization, and remain observable at moderate fields and elevated temperatures where quantum oscillations are suppressed. Their frequencies depend solely on the FS parameters (e.g., curvature), and not on specific details of scattering mechanisms. SO are also sensitive to the coherence of inter-layer tunneling, allow contributions from individual FS pockets to be distinguished in the frequency domain, and naturally include the Yamaji angle effect (if present in the system) as a prominent feature in the frequency spectrum. We compute SO spectra as a function of the magnetic field orientation for three representative scenarios: (i) an unreconstructed large FS, (ii) a spin density wave reconstructed FS with volume $p/4$, and (iii) a fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL$^*$) with pocket volume $p/8$ (here $p$ is the hole doping). We show that the SO spectrum offers a wealth of universal features that could be used to differentiate between these scenarios. In particular, we highlight a FS geometry-dependent phase shift between oscillations in longitudinal and transverse conductivities, characterize how the FS curvature can be extracted from SO if the film orientation is perpendicular to the crystallographic $c$-axis, and analyze the evolution of the SO spectrum with doping."}

Over the years, various theoretical frameworks have been developed to characterize bonding in solid-state materials. However, integrating bonding information from these frameworks into machine learning pipelines at scale has been limited by the lack of a systematically generated and validated database. Recent advances in high-throughput bonding analysis workflows have addressed this issue, and our previously computed Quantum-Chemical Bonding Database for Solid-State Materials was extended to include approximately 13,000 materials. This database is then used to derive a new set of quantum-chemical bonding descriptors. A systematic assessment is performed using statistical significance tests to evaluate how the inclusion of these descriptors influences the performance of machine-learning models that otherwise rely solely on structure- and composition-derived features. Models are built to predict elastic, vibrational, and thermodynamic properties typically associated with chemical bonding in materials.

Density functional theory and density functional perturbation theory calculations reveal that, among the halogenated systems considered, only Br- and I-functionalized Mo2C monolayers are dynamically stable, as confirmed by positive definite phonon spectra throughout the Brillouin zone. Electronic structure calculations show metallic behavior with states near the Fermi level dominated by Mo d orbitals with pronounced electronic density of states, providing favorable conditions for strong electron-phonon coupling (EPC). The resulting EPC constants place both systems in the strong coupling regime, yielding superconducting transition temperatures of Tc = 13.1 K for Mo2CBr2 and Tc = 18.1 K for Mo2CI2 within the Allen-Dynes formalism. Notably, halogen functionalization itself plays a crucial role in enhancing superconductivity in Mo2C, which has Tc = 7.2 K, leading to a substantial increase in the superconducting transition temperature compared with pristine Mo2C through strengthened electron-phonon coupling. Furthermore, we demonstrate that superconductivity in these systems is highly tunable via carrier doping and biaxial tensile strain. Electron doping significantly enhances EPC and raises Tc up to 21.7 K for Mo2CBr2 and 21.3 K for Mo2CI2. Our results identify halogen-functionalized Mo2C MXenes as mechanically robust, phonon mediated two dimensional superconductors and highlight carrier doping as an effective strategy for optimizing their superconducting performance."}

Here, we report spatiotemporally resolved structural dynamics in the van der Waals ferroelectric NbOI2 using combined ultrafast electron microscopy and diffraction. Above-band-gap photoexcitation rapidly screens the in-plane polarization and heats the lattice, launching three coherent acoustic phonons: two transverse shear modes and one longitudinal breathing mode. The transverse mode that shears the layers perpendicular to the in-plane polar axis dominates over that along the polar axis, reflecting anisotropic coupling between polarization and strain. Spatially resolved measurements further reveal spatially correlated heterogeneity in the mode amplitudes and lifetimes. Regions dominated by a single shear mode exhibit significantly longer lifetime of acoustic oscillations than that of multimode regions, suggesting that acoustic phonon-phonon scattering is a major source of decoherence.

Even compounds with nominal Au2+ usually disproportionate into Au1+ and Au3+. Recently, Cs4Au3Cl12 was synthesized, where gold took the 2+ state in the bulk. Here, we investigate this compound using first-principles calculations and show that stabilization of the Au2+ ion is through the formation of a polaron crystal. The electronic and phononic structure suggest that the bonding network can be interpreted as a collection of [Au2+Cl4]2- and [Au3+Cl4]1- square planar motifs, and the crystal lacks a smooth pathway for Au2+ to disproportionate into Au1+ and Au3+. The electronic states of Au are contained within each [AuCl4] motif, which allows for the Au2+ state to be localized and isolated electronically. The Au2+-sites form an ordered structure, which is driven by a strong repulsive interaction between [Au2+Cl4]2- motifs due to their lattice distortion. The electron-phonon coupling between Au2+ and Cl explains the stability of Au2+, which suggests this material to be interpreted as a polaron crystal. By considering redox reaction, we show that Cs4Au3Cl12 has the maximal density of Au2+, and further oxidation will induce a delocalized state. Cs4Au3Cl12 has distinctive electronic structure, with a narrow gap, isolated HOMO and LUMO bands strongly localized at the Au-sites, and magnetization at the Au2+-sites making Cs4Au3Cl12 unique among quantum materials. Magnetism in gold is rare, and Cs4Au3Cl12 can be a testbed to explore novel gold chemistry as well as polaron crystal transport. The strategy to stabilize an unconventional oxidation state through engineering of lattice distortions is quite general; therefore, we propose that a similar approach will be applicable to a wide variety of transition metal compounds."}

Downfolding and embedding approaches mitigate this cost but typically require prior selection of a correlated subspace, which can be difficult to determine in heterogeneous or extended systems. Here, we introduce a stochastic cluster expansion framework for efficiently recovering the total correlation energy of large systems with near-DMRG accuracy, without the need to select an active space a priori. By combining correlation contributions from randomly sampled environment orbitals with an exactly treated subspace of interest, the method reproduces total energies for non-reacting and reactive systems while drastically reducing computational cost. The approach also provides a quantitative diagnostic for molecule-solvent correlation, guiding principled embedding decisions.

In cation-disordered rocksalt oxides, Li+ diffusion has conventionally been rationalized by the static 0-transition-metal (0-TM) percolation rule, which assumes an ideal, passive lattice and thus fails to capture experimentally accessible capacities. Here, we show that lattice distortion is an essential, previously overlooked degree of freedom that actively reshapes Li+ percolation networks. By developing a lattice-responsive framework combining Monte Carlo sampling of cation configurations with machine-learning-accelerated molecular dynamics, we quantitatively predict Li+ percolation and electrochemical capacities within 5% of experiment. Our results reveal a causal coupling between lattice distortion and cation short-range order: enhanced local distortions precede and suppress short-range ordering, activating Li+ migration through nominally inaccessible 1-TM channels, fundamentally extending percolation beyond the 0-TM paradigm. Guided by this, we design and synthesize a high-entropy oxide, Li1.2Mn0.2Ti0.2V0.2Mo0.2O2, which exhibits enhanced distortion and achieves a 71.9% Li+ percolation network, surpassing 65.8% in Li1.2Mn0.4Ti0.4O2, delivering 256.3 mAh/g capacity, closely matching our prediction of 255.1 mAh/g.

Here, we investigate the structural properties of ultrathin (1 quintuple layer) Sb$_2$Te$_3$ grown on single-layer graphene and, motivated by the structural modulations observed at the TI surface, explore theoretically how such nanoscale corrugations may influence the electronic behavior of the system. Using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (LT-STM), we observe a periodic rippling of the heterostructure with a wavelength of ~$\\sim8.7$ nm. Energetic analysis reveals that these ripples are not intrinsic but are driven by strain from the substrate during cooling. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that while the ideal flat heterostructure exhibits a hybridization gap of $\\sim40$ meV, the ripple-induced structural modulation closes this gap, restoring a metallic state. This gapless phase is not a trivial metal. By combining an effective moiré ladder model with spin-resolved DFT, we find that the proximity-induced spin-orbit coupling is redistributed across a dense manifold of minibands. The resulting ``Helical Metal'' has a complex spin-texture beyond a simple Rashba splitting. Remarkably, while the flat system is effectively spinless in this ultrathin limit due to hybridization, the ripples actively restore the spin polarization. Our findings suggest that rippled TI/graphene heterostructures provide an interesting platform to develop spintronics, where geometric modulation unlocks dense helical states that are inaccessible in the pristine flat limit."}

While exploring the system, a TCRW locates edges and boundaries in the system and develops topologically protected edge currents even in the presence of defects and disorder. Drawing on the bulk-boundary correspondence found in hard condensed matter systems allows us to rationalize the emergence of robust edge currents through topological features of the dynamic spectrum. We show that chiral motion and rotational noise with opposite chirality are two crucial components in our inherently non-Hermitian model. As proofs of principle, we first show that a topological walker outperforms diffusive motion to efficiently solve complex mazes due to its property of remaining on the edge with some rare detachments. Second, we use this model to design building blocks that can perform efficient self-assembly overcoming the timescale bottlenecks of diffusion-limited growth and reducing self-assembly times by approximately 80%."}

Nc-AFM imaging reveals that the six-membered ring retains a planar geometry, whereas the five-membered ring exhibits pronounced structural distortion. The six-membered ring hosts a uniform excitation gap that can be accurately described by a Heisenberg spin model and multireference CASCI calculations. In contrast, the distorted five-membered ring displays spin ground states with asymmetric spatial distributions due to degeneracy lifting induced by structural distortion.

Here, we systematically investigate how strain, crystal orientation, and the Hubbard $U$ parameter influence the magnetic ground state and spin Hall response of RuO$_2$.

The correlation between the formation of electron-hole puddles in nearer to the charge neutrality point (CNP), and the role of disorder is fundamentally important for Dirac transport in graphene systems. Numerous studies on graphene further urge the necessity to find a better descriptor for disorder-charge puddles relation, which directly influences electrical conductivity. In principle, the external bias-driven energy level shift and its relevant density of states (DOS) provide information about the effect of total interactive potential on linear energy dispersion in terms of wavevector, but yet to be well-explored. With this ground, here we map the energy quantization for Dirac materials through the empirical relation of voltage-driven charge density in monolayer graphene, using the differential entropy (h)-ruled wavevector (k) mechanics. For this work, we propose the four postulates which are the key observable descriptions of earlier research reports, to study the precise electronic transport via an entropy-guided wavevector propagation approach, along with the Klein paradox, which pertains to the ultrafast dynamics in the Dirac or quasi-Dirac systems. The introduced h-ruled k and h-ruled N relations generalize the electron dynamics in both the unbounded and potentially bounded Dirac systems. Through the quantization mapping procedure under different voltage-driven potential (U=eV) boundary conditions, the observed energy shift from lower to excited quantum state obeys the relation of N(k)=N(U)^3; here, N(U) is the voltage-driven potential energy contribution factor for the quantum state existence.

In the flat-band limit, we establish an upper and lower Wiedemann-Franz-type bound for the ratio of thermal Meissner stiffness and electric Meissner stiffness (superfluid weight), whose prefactors are provided by the extrema of the squared energy offsets of the outer single-particle bands of the system.

The significant MCE is observed far above long-range ordering, even in the paramagnetic region, which is attributed to the change in magnetic entropy due to short-range spin correlation arising from (low-dimensional) magnetic frustration. Such a spin-chain incipient MCE above long-range ordering is rarely reported. Interestingly, multiple magnetocaloric switching from conventional to inverse MCE (and vice versa) are observed below long-range magnetic ordering, as a function of temperature and magnetic field, for the R = Nd, Dy, and Er members. However, such MCE switching is absent in the Gd member, which is an S-state atom (orbital moment L = 0). Our systematic investigation of this series demonstrates that the interplay between crystal-electric field (CEF), strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and rare earth anisotropy of R-ions play an important role in spin reorientation, leading to multiple MCE switching due to intriguing changes in magnetic and lattice entropy. The maximum change of entropy for Er, Gd, Dy and Nd is 7.8, 6.8, 4.0 and 1.0 J Kg-1 K-1 respectively.

This long-range interaction plays a crucial role, as it significantly influences both the structure and the relative energies of the competing ordered states. We derive a set of self-consistency equations and solve them both numerically and analytically. Our findings reveal that, as the bias field is varied, the bilayer undergoes a cascade of first-order transitions between several ordered insulating phases for which order-parameter structures are explicitly identified. Some of these phases are characterized by two inequivalent single-particle gaps, whose magnitudes depend on the valley and spin quantum numbers.

We show that the strong $d$-wave spin-momentum locking inherent to the altermagnetic band structure reconstructs the Fermi surface into spin-selective quasi-1D open sheets. This unique topology of Fermi surface drives an instability toward spin-resolved electronic charge density waves (CDWs), in which the ordering wave vectors for spin-up and spin-down electrons condense along two mutually orthogonal directions, forming spin-resolved stripe phases. As a consequence, this results in pronounced gap openings near the Fermi surface, and the superposition of these spin-resolved stripe orders leads to a checkerboard CDW in the charge channel and an antiphase spin-density-wave modulation in the spin channel. Upon increasing temperature, the density-wave order melts at $T_c$ due to thermal phase fluctuation while the gap opening persists, giving rise to a robust pseudogap regime, which eventually closes at a higher temperature $T_g$. The resulting simulations quantitatively reproduce the key features observed in the spectroscopic measurements, offering a consistent and generic understanding of the reported phenomena in KV$_2$Se$_2$O and, more broadly, in metallic altermagnets with strong spin-momentum locking."}

By solving the interface eigenvalue problem, we demonstrate that the net spectral flow across the strip gap is determined by the enclosed monopole charge.

As a result, we obtain that when antiferromagnetic Zeeman field is considered, a finite charge current emerges in both the real and imaginary parts of the current, which are in contrast to the ferromagnetic case where only the imaginary current exist.

Using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (LT-STM), we observe a periodic rippling of the heterostructure with a wavelength of ~$\\sim8.7$ nm. Energetic analysis reveals that these ripples are not intrinsic but are driven by strain from the substrate during cooling. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that while the ideal flat heterostructure exhibits a hybridization gap of $\\sim40$ meV, the ripple-induced structural modulation closes this gap, restoring a metallic state. This gapless phase is not a trivial metal. By combining an effective moiré ladder model with spin-resolved DFT, we find that the proximity-induced spin-orbit coupling is redistributed across a dense manifold of minibands. The resulting ``Helical Metal'' has a complex spin-texture beyond a simple Rashba splitting. Remarkably, while the flat system is effectively spinless in this ultrathin limit due to hybridization, the ripples actively restore the spin polarization. Our findings suggest that rippled TI/graphene heterostructures provide an interesting platform to develop spintronics, where geometric modulation unlocks dense helical states that are inaccessible in the pristine flat limit."}

Here we present a simple thermodynamic framework for multicomponent halide perovskites of composition FA$_{1-x}$MA$_{x-y}$Cs$_y$Pb(I$_{1-z}$Br$_z$)$_3$, based on \\textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics. By decomposing the free energy of mixing into enthalpic, configurational, and rotational entropic contributions, we show that although the enthalpy of mixing is generally positive, the solid solutions are thermodynamically stable against phase separation due to the large configurational entropy associated with random substitution on cation and halide sublattices. Mixing reduces the rotational entropy of the organic cations, partially offsetting the configurational stabilization. However, within our model, this rotational penalty is not sufficient to overcome the configurational driving force, and a curvature analysis within a regular-solution model does not predict a miscibility gap for any of the mixing channels considered. Analysis of hydrogen-bond dynamics shows that MA--Y (Y = I, Br) interactions are more persistent than FA--Y interactions, while the dominant FA-donated N$-$H$\\cdots$I hydrogen bonds remain nearly composition-invariant. Cs-containing mixtures, in which Cs$^{+}$ forms no hydrogen bonds, can nevertheless be thermodynamically stable.

We compare analytically and numerically two common bond-failure criteria:~{\\em critical stretch} and~{\\em critical energy density}. In the former, bonds fail when they stretch to a critical value, whereas in the latter, bonds fail when the bond energy density exceeds a threshold. By focusing the analysis on bond-based models, we prove mathematically that the critical stretch criterion and the critical energy density criterion are not equivalent in general and result in different bond-breaking and fracture phenomena. Numerical examples showcase the striking differences between the effect of the two criteria on crack dynamics, including the crack tip evolution, crack propagation, and crack branching."}

However, existing studies on stacking-induced unconventional magnetism mainly focus on specific materials and stacking configurations. Here, we develop a general symmetry-based stacking theory for two-dimensional magnets. We first introduce spin layer groups as the fundamental symmetry framework, providing the essential magnetic symmetry information for the stacking theory. Based on this framework, we construct the complete set of 448 collinear spin layer groups for describing two-dimensional collinear magnets. Subsequently, we develop a general magnetic stacking theory applicable to arbitrary magnetic systems and derive its general solutions. Using CrF$_3$ as an illustrative example, we show how this theory enables designs of two-dimensional unconventional magnetism, as validated by first-principles calculations. We realize two-dimensional fully compensated ferrimagnetism through our stacking theory. Our work provides a general symmetry-guided platform for discovering and designing stacking-induced unconventional magnetism."}

Over the years, various theoretical frameworks have been developed to characterize bonding in solid-state materials. However, integrating bonding information from these frameworks into machine learning pipelines at scale has been limited by the lack of a systematically generated and validated database. Recent advances in high-throughput bonding analysis workflows have addressed this issue, and our previously computed Quantum-Chemical Bonding Database for Solid-State Materials was extended to include approximately 13,000 materials. This database is then used to derive a new set of quantum-chemical bonding descriptors. A systematic assessment is performed using statistical significance tests to evaluate how the inclusion of these descriptors influences the performance of machine-learning models that otherwise rely solely on structure- and composition-derived features. Models are built to predict elastic, vibrational, and thermodynamic properties typically associated with chemical bonding in materials. The results demonstrate that incorporating quantum-chemical bonding descriptors not only improves predictive performance but also helps identify intuitive expressions for properties such as the projected force constant and lattice thermal conductivity via symbolic regression."}

We use the symmetry decomposed elastoresistance to uncover the fingerprints of strain-dependent Kondo scattering as function of temperature and magnetic field in the prototypical tetragonal Kondo lattice YbRh$_2$Si$_2$. By combining longitudinal and transverse resistance measurements under uniaxial strain applied along the tetragonal $[100]$ and $[110]$ directions, we obtain the elastoresistive responses in the $A_{1g}$, $B_{1g}$, and $B_{2g}$ symmetry channels. While the responses in the symmetry-breaking channels are negligible, the isotropic $A_{1g}$ elastoresistance displays characteristic sign changes and approaches huge values at low temperatures. Scaling analysis and comparison with linear thermal expansion measurements reveals that the elastoresistance probes the contribution of Kondo scattering to the strain dependence of magnetic entropy and signals strain-controlled quantum criticality upon cooling to 2 K."}

Here, we explore the Maxwell lattice frustrated Mott insulators and argue that the combination of the intrinsic spin-lattice coupling and the spin exchanges could induce the topological mechanics with topological boundary floppy modes in the phonon spectra. This mechanism and phenomena are dubbed magnetic topological mechanics, or, magnetopological mechanics in short. Focusing on a two-dimensional kagomé lattice spin model, we illustrate how strong spin-lattice coupling drives a spontaneous lattice distortion, resulting in the topological Maxwell lattice with the topological polarization and non-trivial phonon spectra. Moreover, the magnetic field, that directly changes the spin state, indirectly influences the lattice structure via the spin-lattice coupling, thereby providing a method to control the Maxwell lattice and the boundary modes. We expect this work to inspire interests in the Maxwell lattice Mott insulating materials and the coupling between lattices and electronic orders."}

In this work, we study charged moments within the framework of Ballistic Fluctuation Theory (BFT). This theory describes large-scale ballistic fluctuations of conserved charges and associated currents and, by exploiting the height-field formulation of twist fields, gives access to the asymptotic behaviour of their two-point correlation functions. In Del Vecchio Del Vecchio et al. $[1]$, this approach was applied to the special case of branch-point twist fields used to compute entanglement entropies within the replica approach. Here, we extend those results by applying BFT to composite branch-point twist fields, obtained by inserting an additional gauge field. Focusing on free fermions, we derive analytic expressions for charged Rényi entropies both at equilibrium, in generalized Gibbs ensembles, and out of equilibrium following a quantum quench from $U(1)$ preserving pair producing integrable initial states. In the latter case, our results agree with the conjecture arising from the quasiparticle picture."}

In the pristine limit, we show that the existence of localized edge states is highly sensitive to boundary geometry, with certain terminations completely suppressing edge modes. Kane-Mele spin-orbit coupling opens a bulk gap and stabilizes topologically protected helical edge states, yielding a robust $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ insulating phase that is insensitive to termination details. In contrast, the combined effect of a Zeeman field and Rashba spin-orbit coupling drives the system into Chern insulating phases, with Chern numbers consistent with the number of chiral edge modes. We further demonstrate that non-coplanar magnetic textures generate multiple Chern phases through finite scalar spin chirality, with Kane-Mele coupling strongly tuning the topological gaps. Our results provide important insights into the tunability of edge states in the kagome lattice, which can be key to designing materials with novel electronic properties and topological phases."}

Realizing this requires low photon-loss rates and qubits with tunable electric dipole moments that couple strongly to the resonator's electric field while maintaining long coherence times. For spin qubits, spin-photon coupling is typically achieved via spin-charge hybridization. However, this introduces a fundamental trade-off: a large spin-charge admixture enhances the coupling strength, which boosts readout and resonator-mediated gate speeds, but exposes the qubit to increased decoherence, thereby increasing the threshold required for strong coupling and limiting the time available for accurate state measurement. This makes it essential to identify optimal operating points for each qubit platform. We address this for the donor-based flip-flop qubit, whose microwave-controllable electron-nuclear spin states make it suitable for coupling to microwave resonators. We demonstrate that, by choosing intermediate tunnel couplings that balance strong interaction with long qubit lifetimes, high-fidelity readout and strong coupling are simultaneously achievable. We also map out the respective charge-photon couplings and photon-loss rates required. Furthermore, we show that experimental constraints on charge-photon coupling and photon loss can be mitigated using squeezed input fields. As similar trade-offs appear in quantum-dot-based qubits, our methods and insights extend naturally to these platforms, offering a potential route toward scalable architectures."}

Downfolding and embedding approaches mitigate this cost but typically require prior selection of a correlated subspace, which can be difficult to determine in heterogeneous or extended systems. Here, we introduce a stochastic cluster expansion framework for efficiently recovering the total correlation energy of large systems with near-DMRG accuracy, without the need to select an active space a priori. By combining correlation contributions from randomly sampled environment orbitals with an exactly treated subspace of interest, the method reproduces total energies for non-reacting and reactive systems while drastically reducing computational cost. The approach also provides a quantitative diagnostic for molecule-solvent correlation, guiding principled embedding decisions. This framework enables systematically improvable many-body calculations in extended systems, opening the door to high-accuracy studies of chemical processes in condensed phase environments."}
