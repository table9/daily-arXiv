Here, we introduce the adaptive projected-purified pseudoboson density-matrix renormalization group (A3P-DMRG) tailored to explore the ground states of dilute lattice models. The method compresses cluster Hilbert spaces by retaining only the most probable low-occupation Fock states, identified via probabilistic bounds and refined through a self-consistent mean-field basis optimization. We demonstrate that A3P-DMRG is advantageous in low-filling and weak-coupling regimes for large system sizes where conventional DMRG struggles. This establishes the method as a versatile tool for studying dilute quantum many-body systems relevant to ultra-cold atom quantum simulators, photonic lattices, Moiré materials and quantum chemistry."}

In this study, we examine a coupled spin-$1/2$ ladder, where frustrated ladders with leg, rung, and diagonal interactions are linked through a horizontal coupling. By introducing a spatially anisotropic third-nearest-neighbor interaction along the horizontal direction, the model was found to possess an exact dimer ground state, characterized by a product of singlets forming a columnar dimer phase. The model is analyzed using bond-operator mean-field theory (BOMFT) and the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG). BOMFT reveals three distinct phases: a double-stripe ordered phase, a Néel ordered phase, and a quantum disordered dimerized phase. The critical points for the transitions are $J_1 = -0.81$ (double-stripe to dimerized) and $J_1 = 2.81$ (dimerized to Néel phase). DMRG results corroborate the exact ground state and refine the critical points to $J_1 = -0.79$ and $J_1 = 2.29$ for the respective transitions. Additionally, another transition is identified as the Néel order vanishes for $J_1 > 4.5$. The static spin structure factor further corroborates the nature of the ordered phases."}

This transition is manifested in lattice parameters, transport, thermodynamics, and magnetic susceptibility, yet remains remarkably insensitive to magnetic fields up to at least 14 T, indicating an electronically driven reconstruction. At much lower temperatures T*= 20 K, charge transport becomes strongly nonlinear, exhibiting distinct depinning thresholds, negative differential resistance, pronounced current- and frequency-dependence, and slow collective dynamics in the Hertz range. While each feature is characteristic of density-wave transport, their simultaneous occurrence in an antiferromagnetic oxide is unprecedented. All nonlinear signatures vanish upon only 3% Ir substitution, which preserves the crystal structure and insulating state, ruling out Joule heating or extrinsic artifacts. The wide separation between the electronic reconstruction at TA and the emergence of nonlinear dynamics at T* identifies Ba4Ru3O10 as a rare correlated system hosting a strongly pinned collective electronic state intertwined with antiferromagnetism."}

Here we investigate how spin splitting generated by spin-dependent next-nearest-neighbor hopping $t'$ reshapes the Fermi surface nesting and van Hove singularities in the two-dimensional square-lattice Hubbard model, leading evolution of magnetic instabilities. Using the constrained-path quantum Monte Carlo method, we find the dominant magnetic correlation as functions of the filling and $t'/t$ by computing the momentum-resolved spin structure factor. The analysis reveals a transition from antiferromagnetic $(π,π)$ order in the isotropic, half-filled system to non-collinear spiral $(π,q)$ order upon increasing the spin-dependent anisotropy or doping away from half-filling, ultimately entering a short-range correlation regime where stripe and spiral correlation coexist. These findings highlight a possible route to realizing spiral correlation in altermagnetic systems, potentially providing a platform for spintronic devices that exploit non-collinear spin textures."}

Here we step out from the superconducting state and discuss the effect of the shunt resistor on the resistive state of a superconducting wire, at elevated currents still below the critical current for the transition to the normal state.

The accompanying dynamic current redistribution in the circuit also affects the local heating properties and additionally contributes to the control of the resistive state, particularly important at the elevated operation temperatures."}

We have observed these anomalous trends even in conditions where known mechanisms, such as overhang equalization and excessive electrolyte oxidation, are unlikely to be significant. Here, we combine simulations and experiments to analyze four cases that can produce increased capacity in Si cells. Three of these pathways relate to break-in processes, where improved mass and charge transport can lead to increased access to active electrode domains and decreased cell impedance. The fourth case occurs at high levels of prelithiation, when the positive electrode (PE) is completely replenished with Li+ at the end of cell discharge. We show that the commonality among these mechanisms is that the underlying transformations change the potentials experienced by electrodes at the end of half-cycles, increasing the Li+ inventory available to the cell. A quantitative framework to describe these effects is presented, enabling these ideas to be extended to other battery systems."}

Instead, in quantum Hall systems, one can define an overcomplete basis of spatially localized coherent states. In this work, we propose a unified framework for understanding the quantum Hall effect and Chern insulators from the perspective of localized bases, by extending the overcomplete basis of coherent states to Chern bands in terms of coherent-like states. Specifically, by representing both coherent states and coherent-like states as wave packets defined on a band, the difference between them can be encoded solely in the functional form of the wave packet in momentum space. Furthermore, for filling factor $ν=1/3$, we define a local repulsive interaction Hamiltonian based on these bases and discuss properties of its ground states. In particular, by relating this Hamiltonian to previously studied models, we show that in quantum Hall systems it possesses exactly zero-energy ground states with topological degeneracy, thereby confirming that it serves as a model for fractional quantum Hall systems. In addition, we numerically verify that the Hamiltonian possesses topological degeneracy for representative Chern insulator models. An advantage of this formulation is that it allows fractional quantum Hall systems and various fractional Chern insulator systems to be discussed within a unified framework using the same Hamiltonian form. In addition, we discuss that coherent-like states can also be defined in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological insulators. Corresponding to the fermionic time-reversal symmetry of the system, Kramers-degenerate coherent-like states can be naturally defined. The localized basis constructed from coherent-like states is expected to be useful for describing strongly correlated topological phases in flat-band systems."}

Here, we introduce a new mechanism for accomplishing this goal by mimicking the bonding characteristics of high-pressure H3S within metal hydrides. Using Li3CuH4 as an example, its Cu-H covalent interaction effectively mimics the core function of the S-H bonding in H3S. This interaction not only induces a high hydrogen-derived electronic density of states at the Fermi level, but also softens the hydrogen phonon modes, thereby significantly enhancing the electron-phonon coupling. Furthermore, embedding the strongly ionic Li3H lattice into the covalent Cu-H framework stabilizes the structure at significantly low pressures via a chemical-template effect, while maintaining high-Tc. Li3CuH4 exhibits excellent thermodynamic stability at 20 GPa, with a Tc of 39.25 K at 12 GPa. Further comprehensive high-throughput studies on Li3MH4 (M = transition metal) compounds uncover general principles applicable to a broader range of compounds.

In open quantum systems, an intrinsically nonequilibrium analogue, dynamical metastability, can originate from the spectral geometry of a non-Hermitian operator. In noninteracting models, this mechanism produces boundary-sensitive anomalous relaxation, transient amplification, and topologically mandated long-lived edge modes, all of which are enhanced as system size grows. Here we extend dynamical metastability into the nonlinear, interacting regime and identify magnetic heterostructures as a natural platform for its exploration. We introduce an interacting spin Lindbladian whose linearized magnon dynamics map onto a dynamically metastable Hatano-Nelson chain, and show that dynamical metastability in the noninteracting limit seeds genuinely nonlinear phenomena, including size-dependent spin dipping and anomalous attraction to unstable equilibria. Long-lived edge states associated to topologically mandated Dirac bosons persist under nonlinearities and disorder. We further analyze the magnetization dynamics in magnetic multilayers within the classical Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski framework, identifying Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, nonlocal damping, and spin-transfer torque as control parameters governing bulk-boundary stability mismatch and band topology. While all the distinctive dynamical phenomena previously identified reappear in this experimentally relevant setting, the LLGS framework also supports multistability and limit cycles that are absent in the quantum model.

Here we show that the arrow of time itself can be operationalized into a measurable physical quantity on mesoscopic particles - the eigen-phase displacement. This displacement gives rise to a non-local generalized force, the thermodynamic inertia force, which emerges from the integrated contribution of local constraints rather than as a conventional local force. It actively counteracts fluctuations and its algebraic structure is a semi-group, fundamentally distinct from the Lie group of Newton inertia, thereby encoding the irreversibility of time's arrow. Building on this foundation, we construct a unified Microstate-Sequence-Mode-Coupling (MSS-MCT) theory. Its thermodynamic limit is defined by Microstate Sequence (MSS) theory, and its dynamical action is captured by a consequent mode-coupling theory (MCT). From this single first-principles framework, we simultaneously resolve two long-standing puzzles: it predicts the giant non-Gaussian parameter(1~10), closing the order-of-magnitude gap with experiments that standard mode-coupling theory could not explain; and it delivers a first-principles, non-fitting derivation of the universal polymer constant $C_{1} \\approx 16.7$ with merely 1 percent error - the most accurate theoretical prediction to date, dramatically surpassing the Adam-Gibbs and others.

While the recently proposed time-evolving matrix product operator (TEMPO) algorithm based on path integrals successfully circumvents the exponential scaling associated with memory length, its reliance on layer-by-layer tensor contractions and compressions leads to steep scaling with respect to the system Hilbert space dimension. In this work, we introduce the effective Hamiltonian-based TEMPO (EH-TEMPO) algorithm, which reformulates the calculation of the Feynman-Vernon influence functional as an imaginary time evolution governed by an effective Hamiltonian. We demonstrate that this effective Hamiltonian admits a highly compact matrix product operator representation, enabling substantial compression with negligible loss of accuracy. Combining a one-shot global evolution with a backward retrieval approach, EH-TEMPO significantly reduces algorithmic complexity and is naturally suited for GPU acceleration. We benchmark the method against the process tensor TEMPO algorithm using the 7-site Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex model. The results demonstrate that EH-TEMPO achieves numerically exact accuracy with superior efficiency, delivering speedups of up to 17.5x on GPU hardware compared to standard CPU implementations."}

Here, we propose the polytropic steering protocols that provide an exact analytical bridge between the isothermal and adiabatic limits for Brownian particles far-from-equilibrium. We demonstrate that for any protocol duration $τ$, the system can be precisely steered along a prescribed polytropic trajectory, revealing a striking non-monotonic dependence of irreversibility on the driving rate. Contrary to the near-equilibrium paradigm where faster driving necessitates higher energetic costs, we identify a most-irreversible timescale, beyond which dissipation is anomalously suppressed by rapid driving. By mapping these protocols onto a broad class of controllable thermodynamic cycle, we establish power-efficiency tradeoffs and position the polytropic index as a genuine thermodynamic control knob for the rational design of high-speed, high-performance microscopic thermal machines."}

Submitted to Energy Advances", "summary": "This study presents an eco-friendly and bio-based symmetric supercapacitor using cotton textile waste-derived hydrogels as electrolytes and chitosan-based carbon electrodes as metal-free charge-storage components. Cotton-derived hydrogels were synthesized via an alkaline dissolution-gelation route and modified with ammonium thiocyanate (NH4SCN) to enhance ionic conductivity. The ionic modification increased the hydrogel conductivity from 17.1 to 37.8 mS cm^-1, confirming a nearly twofold improvement in ion transport efficiency. The resulting hydrogel exhibited improved thermal stability, homogeneous ionic transport, and strong polymer-ion interactions confirmed by FTIR and TGA analyses. In a symmetric device, the ion-modified hydrogel enables reduced equivalent series resistance, faster charge-transfer kinetics, and a short time constant (tau = 3.2 s), comparable to commercial energy-storage systems. After 1000 cycles, the device exhibits a 12.3% increase in specific capacitance, confirming stable proof-of-concept operation. Cycling leads to a moderate increase in R_ESR (18 to 22 ohm) and tau (3.2 to 4.1 s), indicating slower charge-ion redistribution. Notably, this R_ESR includes the contribution of the test-cell setup; in compact coin-type configurations, the resistance would be considerably lower. EIS reveals a concurrent rise in interfacial resistive terms, consistent with post-cycling hydrogel darkening and FTIR evidence of Fe-SCN coordination, suggesting that resistance buildup mainly originates from minor Fe-SCN interactions when the expelled liquid reaches the stainless-steel collector, rather than from loss of capacitive functionality. Overall, these results demonstrate the viability of cotton waste-derived hydrogels and chitosan-based electrodes as sustainable components for green energy storage, offering a recyclable and eco-friendly alternative to conventional systems."}

Mixed ionic-electronic conductors (MIECs) of the Ruddlesden-Popper family, such as Nd$2$Ni${1-x}$Cu$x$O${4+δ}$ (NNCO), offer attractive cathode properties due to their high oxygen transport and favourable defect chemistry. In this work, we investigate the fabrication of Nd$2$Ni${0.8}$Cu${0.2}$O${4+δ}$ thin films using a room temperature RF sputtering process followed by moderate temperature annealing.

We examine the effect of sputtering power density on phase formation and film stoichiometry through X-ray diffraction, Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry, Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy, and temperature dependent resistivity measurements. Increasing the sputtering power density strongly reduces the presence of spurious phases and promotes stabilization of the desired n=1 Ruddlesden-Popper phase. Films deposited at 230 W (3.1 W cm$^{-2}$) exhibit a predominant NNCO structure, elemental ratios close to nominal composition, and resistivity values consistent with bulk materials.

We show that different types of spintronic qubits, including analogs of charge, flux, and transmon superconducting qubits, can be implemented depending on the hierarchy of energy scales. A Hamiltonian formalism is developed for each regime, enabling an analytical treatment of the two-level quantum dynamics and estimation of coherence times.

We show that singular values, rather than eigenvalues, provide the only stable foundation for topological protection in non-Hermitian systems because they remain robust under translational-symmetry-breaking perturbations that destabilize the eigenvalue spectrum, rendering it unsuitable for topological classification. Building on Toeplitz operator theory, we establish general results for non-Hermitian Hamiltonians defined on half and quarter planes, relating the topological indices of the associated Toeplitz operators to the number of finite-size singular values that are separated from the bulk singular-value spectrum and vanish in the thermodynamic limit. This yields a precise bulk-boundary correspondence for edge and corner modes, including higher-order topological phases, without requiring crystalline symmetries. We illustrate our general results with detailed examples exhibiting topologically protected families of edge states, coexisting edge and corner modes, and phases with both gapped bulk and edges supporting only stable corner modes. The latter is exemplified by a non-Hermitian generalization of the Benalcazar-Bernevig-Hughes model."}

Changing octahedral tilt patterns is found to have negligible effects on the magnetic properties, despite determining the presence or absence of small Jahn-Teller distortions. The analysis of the response of the magnetic coupling to a variation of the Coulomb interaction parameters demonstrates that ferromagnetism is driven by a double-exchange mechanism involving itinerant $e_g$ electrons, while its final strength is hampered by antiferromagnetic contributions due to the superexchange of localized $t_{2g}$ electrons. Multi-scale simulations based on atomistic spin dynamics show that the thinnest superlattices, $n=2,4$, possess an ordering temperature that is at least comparable to that of La$_{2/3}$Sr$_{1/3}$MnO$_3$. Conversely, as thickness increases, a two-phase behavior emerges, where the SrMnO$_3$ region loses long-range order faster than the LaMnO$_3$ region. While the global ordering temperature increases together with thickness, we argue that the high-temperature regime for the observed two-phase behavior is not representative of the real physical system, which will undergo a combined electronic, magnetic and structural phase transition as soon as the long-range order is lost inside the SrMnO$_3$ region.

Here, a multiscale atomistic simulation framework is employed to investigate SHI-induced track formation and recovery in monoclinic beta-Ga2O3 over a wide range of electronic energy losses (Se) and crystallographic orientations. A sequence of distinct structural responses is identified with increasing Se: complete lattice recovery at low Se, recrystallization into a metastable gamma-Ga2O3 phase at intermediate Se, and the formation of core-shell ion tracks at high Se, consisting of an amorphous core surrounded by a recrystallized gamma-phase shell. Despite the essentially isotropic initial energy deposition, the final ion-track morphology exhibits pronounced crystallographic anisotropy, governed by orientation-dependent recovery dynamics. The superior recrystallization along [010] direction is attributed to its exceptionally high elastic stiffness. Notably, SHI irradiation perpendicular to the (100) plane induces a more severe structural response at low Se (less than 10 keV/nm), however, at higher Se, it yields a smaller residual ion track compared with the other orientations. The simulated ion-track sizes show excellent quantitative agreement with available experimental measurements over a broad range of Se values. These findings establish a unified atomic-scale picture of core-shell track formation and anisotropic recovery in beta-Ga2O3."}

In open quantum systems, an intrinsically nonequilibrium analogue, dynamical metastability, can originate from the spectral geometry of a non-Hermitian operator. In noninteracting models, this mechanism produces boundary-sensitive anomalous relaxation, transient amplification, and topologically mandated long-lived edge modes, all of which are enhanced as system size grows. Here we extend dynamical metastability into the nonlinear, interacting regime and identify magnetic heterostructures as a natural platform for its exploration. We introduce an interacting spin Lindbladian whose linearized magnon dynamics map onto a dynamically metastable Hatano-Nelson chain, and show that dynamical metastability in the noninteracting limit seeds genuinely nonlinear phenomena, including size-dependent spin dipping and anomalous attraction to unstable equilibria. Long-lived edge states associated to topologically mandated Dirac bosons persist under nonlinearities and disorder. We further analyze the magnetization dynamics in magnetic multilayers within the classical Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski framework, identifying Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, nonlocal damping, and spin-transfer torque as control parameters governing bulk-boundary stability mismatch and band topology. While all the distinctive dynamical phenomena previously identified reappear in this experimentally relevant setting, the LLGS framework also supports multistability and limit cycles that are absent in the quantum model. Our results constitute the first systematic study of dynamical metastability in nonlinear dynamics, directly relevant to spin-torque oscillator arrays, magnonic devices, and beyond."}

Here, we prepare high-purity, bare FeTe thin films on SrTiO3 and investigate their magnetic and superconducting states combining both microscopic and macroscopic characterizations. By reducing the interstitial Fe impurities, we successfully suppress the long-range antiferromagnetic order, enhance the quasiparticle coherence and induce superconductivity at ~10 K.

Despite extensive experimental studies of PCPs, a comprehensive and quantitatively validated theoretical description linking the structure with the electronic and optical properties is still missing.

We introduce a robust methodology for an accurate simulation of the absorption and fluorescence spectra of PCPs based on a combined TD-DFT and CC2 approach, achieving excellent quantitative agreement with experiment. We also present and validate a fragment-based description of PCPs using the Frenkel exciton model. Such approach is valuable not only for interpretation of the electronic and optical properties of PCPs, but it can also significantly reduce the cost of the calculation while maintaining the accuracy of the supermolecular approach.

By applying a pump tone to excite propagating spin waves in a yttrium iron garnet delay line, four-wave mixing converts the pump mode into two phase-autonomous propagating magnon modes, i.e. a spontaneous mode with nearly twice the wavenumber of the pump mode and an idler mode with nearly zero wavenumber. This allows us to reliably generate ultrasharp spin wave dynamics with broad frequency tunability from the pump and magnetic field. We show that the spontaneous mode can be phase-locked to a probe tone, similar to an auto-oscillator. Furthermore, the spontaneous dynamics can be used to implement a high-gain magnonic parametric amplifier with a gain up to 40 dB. Our results open a new avenue for studying nonlinear magnonics and synchronization physics in propagating magnon geometry and for developing new magnonic devices."}

For $N_{\\rm P}\\gg 1$, we use large-deviation theory to show that the survival probability to remain uncaged exhibits crossover from an exponential decay with time at intermediate times to a stretched-exponential decay at long times, with an exponent $1/3$ independent of $N_{\\rm P}$. The long-time exponent matches the Balagurov--Vaks--Donsker--Varadhan (BVDV) theory of the classical trapping problem, while the exponential decay is qualitatively distinct from the Rosenstock's intermediate-time theory for classical trapping. Similarly, in two dimensions, numerical simulations reveal that both the Sokoban model and its generalized version exhibit long-time stretched-exponential relaxation with exponent $1/2$, again consistent with the BVDV theory. Finally, in two dimensions, we find that the mean trap size is nonmonotonic in $ρ$: it is small at both low and high densities, but reaches a peak at a characteristic density $ρ_*$.

We introduce MLIP-MC, an open-source Python framework to conduct GCMC simulations with MLIPs, and use this framework to benchmark a series of universal models, including MACE-MP-0, ORB-v3, and fairchem ODAC, for CO2 adsorption on ZIF-8, ZIF-4, and Mg-MOF-74. All universal models exhibit systematic biases, consistently over- or underestimating adsorption energetics. Crucially, accuracy depends on training data composition: only models trained on MOF-adsorbate interactions achieve reasonable agreement with a density functional theory derived reference. Errors grow linearly with CO2 uptake, reflecting compounding inaccuracies in adsorbate-adsorbate interactions.

The model is analyzed using bond-operator mean-field theory (BOMFT) and the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG). BOMFT reveals three distinct phases: a double-stripe ordered phase, a Néel ordered phase, and a quantum disordered dimerized phase. The critical points for the transitions are $J_1 = -0.81$ (double-stripe to dimerized) and $J_1 = 2.81$ (dimerized to Néel phase). DMRG results corroborate the exact ground state and refine the critical points to $J_1 = -0.79$ and $J_1 = 2.29$ for the respective transitions. Additionally, another transition is identified as the Néel order vanishes for $J_1 > 4.5$. The static spin structure factor further corroborates the nature of the ordered phases."}

The central element of our framework is the construction of a radially ordered set of maximally localized basis for Chern bands without requiring continuous rotational symmetry. Within this basis, the complex many-body problem simplifies to a real-space organizing principle: a stable FCI occurs if the orbitals excluded around central electrons are those maximizing the two-body interaction energy. We validate this with direct numerical evidence for composite boson formation in the Haldane model, demonstrating that our criterion reliably characterizes FCIs. Importantly, our analysis illustrates that the composite boson framework bridges the fractional quantum Hall effect in continuum and lattice paradigms, providing a unified and intuitive real-space interpretation for distinct correlated phases. It thus establishes a foundation for diagnosing and guiding the design of both Abelian and non-Abelian topologically ordered phases across distinct platforms."}

These models provide a computationally efficient continuum description and have been shown to agree well with atomistic approaches when the confinement potential is slowly varying on the lattice scale. In modern Si/SiGe heterostructures with atomically sharp interfaces and engineered Ge concentration profiles, however, the slowly varying potential approximation underlying conventional (local) envelope-function theory is challenged. We formulate an exact multi-valley envelope-function model by combining Burt-Foreman-type envelope-function theory, which does not rely on the assumption of a slowly varying potential, with a valley-sector decomposition of the Brillouin zone. This construction enforces band-limited envelopes, which satisfy a set of coupled integro-differential equations with a non-local potential energy operator. Using degenerate perturbation theory, we derive the intervalley coupling matrix element within this non-local model and prove that it is strictly invariant under global shifts of the confinement potential (choice of reference energy). We then show that the conventional local envelope model generically violates this invariance due to spectral leakage between valley sectors, leading to an unphysical energy-reference dependence of the intervalley coupling. The resulting ambiguity is quantified by numerical simulations of various engineered Si/SiGe heterostructures. Finally, we propose a simple spectrally filtered local approximation that restores the energy-reference invariance exactly and provides a good approximation to the exact non-local theory."}

In SrRuO3, the antisymmetric exchange interaction produces a spin canting orthogonal to the easy axis, while in all other cases, spin canting is forbidden. Even when the canted magnetic moment in real space is forbidden, relativistic spin-momentum locking shows sizable contributions in k-space. Using prototypical ferromagnets such as orthorhombic SrRuO3, hexagonal CrTe and CrAs with the NiAs crystal structure, half-Heusler MnPtSb, and fcc Ni, we demonstrate that relativistic spin-momentum locking can generate strong effects in ferromagnets. Subdominant components of centrosymmetric ferro-magnetic materials with magnetic sites connected by rotational symmetry host spin-momentum locking similar to altermagnets, while noncentrosymmetric MnPtSb hosts relativistic p-wave due to the spin-orbit coupling. Fcc Ni shows a more complex behavior with a combination of two spin-momentum locking patterns characteristic of altermagnets.

In this work, we show that mean force matching, a strategy for training thermodynamically consistent coarse-grained models, requires 50x fewer training samples and 87% less total atomistic simulation time, while obtaining better accuracy on the potential of mean force for unseen proteins compared to other commonly used objectives. By systematically removing noise from the objective function, we demonstrate that it is possible to scale machine learning architectures for coarse-graining, enabling highly accurate and transferable models. We show the advantages of mean force matching both theoretically and through exhaustive benchmarking using thermodynamic consistency as the primary metric of accuracy."}

The topological phase diagram is computed numerically using two complementary approaches: twisted boundary conditions and the topological Hamiltonian technique. Our results show that strong disorder can act as a fundamental topological mechanism rather than merely a perturbation. For strong exchange coupling, tuning the mass parameter reveals a transition between phases with different Chern numbers $C$. Remarkably, this transition is driven by zeros, rather than poles, of the disorder-averaged Green's function crossing the chemical potential, and has no analogue in any clean system. We further identify a strong-coupling phase with $C = 0$ that is nonetheless topologically nontrivial, characterized by a distinct Chern number $C^{(\\mathrm{S})} \\neq 0$ over the manifold of classical spin configurations.

However, such applications depend sensitively on the predictive accuracy of DFT and achieving experimental-level reliability, so-called transition-metal chemical accuracy (13 kJ/mol), remains challenging for present density functional approximations (DFAs) or even methods beyond DFT. We introduce a new framework for designing DFAs tailored towards studying molecules adsorbed on transition-metal surfaces, building upon recent developments in non-self-consistent DFAs. We propose two functionals within this framework, demonstrating that transition-metal chemical accuracy can be achieved across a diverse set of 39 adsorption reactions while delivering consistent performance for 17 barrier heights. Moreover, we show that these non-self-consistent DFAs address qualitative failures that challenge current self-consistent DFAs, such as CO adsorption on Pt(111) and graphene on Ni(111). The resulting functionals are computationally practical and compatible with existing DFT codes, with scripts and workflows provided to use them.

Submitted to Energy Advances", "summary": "This study presents an eco-friendly and bio-based symmetric supercapacitor using cotton textile waste-derived hydrogels as electrolytes and chitosan-based carbon electrodes as metal-free charge-storage components. Cotton-derived hydrogels were synthesized via an alkaline dissolution-gelation route and modified with ammonium thiocyanate (NH4SCN) to enhance ionic conductivity. The ionic modification increased the hydrogel conductivity from 17.1 to 37.8 mS cm^-1, confirming a nearly twofold improvement in ion transport efficiency. The resulting hydrogel exhibited improved thermal stability, homogeneous ionic transport, and strong polymer-ion interactions confirmed by FTIR and TGA analyses. In a symmetric device, the ion-modified hydrogel enables reduced equivalent series resistance, faster charge-transfer kinetics, and a short time constant (tau = 3.2 s), comparable to commercial energy-storage systems. After 1000 cycles, the device exhibits a 12.3% increase in specific capacitance, confirming stable proof-of-concept operation. Cycling leads to a moderate increase in R_ESR (18 to 22 ohm) and tau (3.2 to 4.1 s), indicating slower charge-ion redistribution. Notably, this R_ESR includes the contribution of the test-cell setup; in compact coin-type configurations, the resistance would be considerably lower. EIS reveals a concurrent rise in interfacial resistive terms, consistent with post-cycling hydrogel darkening and FTIR evidence of Fe-SCN coordination, suggesting that resistance buildup mainly originates from minor Fe-SCN interactions when the expelled liquid reaches the stainless-steel collector, rather than from loss of capacitive functionality. Overall, these results demonstrate the viability of cotton waste-derived hydrogels and chitosan-based electrodes as sustainable components for green energy storage, offering a recyclable and eco-friendly alternative to conventional systems."}

At much lower temperatures T*= 20 K, charge transport becomes strongly nonlinear, exhibiting distinct depinning thresholds, negative differential resistance, pronounced current- and frequency-dependence, and slow collective dynamics in the Hertz range. While each feature is characteristic of density-wave transport, their simultaneous occurrence in an antiferromagnetic oxide is unprecedented. All nonlinear signatures vanish upon only 3% Ir substitution, which preserves the crystal structure and insulating state, ruling out Joule heating or extrinsic artifacts. The wide separation between the electronic reconstruction at TA and the emergence of nonlinear dynamics at T* identifies Ba4Ru3O10 as a rare correlated system hosting a strongly pinned collective electronic state intertwined with antiferromagnetism."}

There, a dual-level reversible reference system propagator algorithm (RESPA) formalism couples a target accurate conservative potential to a simplified distilled representation optimized for the production of non-conservative forces. Despite being non-conservative, the distilled architecture is designed to enforce key physical priors, such as equivariance under rotation and cancellation of atomic force components. These choices facilitate the distillation process and therefore improve drastically the robustness of simulation, significantly limiting the \"holes\" in the simpler potential, thus achieving excellent agreement with the forces data. Overall, the DMTS-NC scheme is found to be more stable and efficient than its conservative counterpart with additional speedups reaching 15-30% over DMTS.

Ce$_3$MgBi$_5$ is an antiferromagnet with the distorted kagome lattice of Ce atoms, in which several fractional magnetization plateaus emerge with the increase of magnetic field. At the 1/2 magnetization plateau, obvious hysteresis has been observed in the magnetoresistance and Hall resistivity during the rise and fall of the magnetic field. However, hysteresis vanishes in the corresponding measurements of magnetization, indicating the existence of degenerate states with the same net magnetization but different electronic transport properties. The degenerate states can be connected by the time-reversal-like operation.

Antipolar sublattice kinetics are represented via the coupled evolution of macroscopic and staggered polarization order parameters. All thermodynamic and kinetic parameters are calibrated to experimental P-E hysteresis loops and held fixed across all simulations. The results show that phase fractions primarily determine hysteresis character, while vertical segregation of AFE- and FE-rich regions systematically reduces the effective coercive field (Ec) under identical electrical loading.

This value is among the highest TBC values reported for semiconductor interfaces, confirmed by structural characterizations which show an ultrahigh-quality interface. Atomistic Green Function calculations reveal that elastic phonon transmission dominates the interface, with nearly half of the acoustic modes (0-15 THz) exhibiting near-unity transmission due to the atomically sharp structure. Furthermore, using high-energy-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy, we probe vibrational properties with nanometer spatial resolution and identify unique interfacial phonon modes connecting the mismatched phonon spectra, confirmed by molecular dynamics simulations. The ultrahigh TBC is attributed to both the high elastic phonon transmission due to the high quality interfaces and the inelastic phonon scattering channel due to interfacial phonon modes. These findings not only advance the fundamental understanding of interfacial thermal transport but also provide a pathway for effective thermal management in emerging electronic devices."}

Here, we introduce a new mechanism for accomplishing this goal by mimicking the bonding characteristics of high-pressure H3S within metal hydrides. Using Li3CuH4 as an example, its Cu-H covalent interaction effectively mimics the core function of the S-H bonding in H3S. This interaction not only induces a high hydrogen-derived electronic density of states at the Fermi level, but also softens the hydrogen phonon modes, thereby significantly enhancing the electron-phonon coupling. Furthermore, embedding the strongly ionic Li3H lattice into the covalent Cu-H framework stabilizes the structure at significantly low pressures via a chemical-template effect, while maintaining high-Tc. Li3CuH4 exhibits excellent thermodynamic stability at 20 GPa, with a Tc of 39.25 K at 12 GPa. Further comprehensive high-throughput studies on Li3MH4 (M = transition metal) compounds uncover general principles applicable to a broader range of compounds.

A translational boundary separating domains of comparable thickness, with an in-plane offset of (2/3a + 1/3b), produces this honeycomb-like contrast. Stacking domains translated in nonequivalent directions yields patterns resembling cubic ice (Ic) along [0001] but with a 3-fold symmetry.

To describe the quantum properties of excitons in the QD chain, a model Hamiltonian is used, taking into account the coupling of neighboring QDs due to dipole-dipole interaction. The localization of stationary states is calculated depending on the magnitude of disorder and the chain length. A criterion is introduced that determines the boundaries of the phase transition from the localized to the delocalized excitation phase. The dynamics of exciton transfer along the QD chain is calculated depending on its length and degree of disorder for linear excitation of the system by a laser pulse.

Within this framework, we identify the physical parameters -- such as anisotropy constants, Gilbert damping, spin current amplitude, and geometric factors -- that govern the transition from classical to quantum behavior. We show that different types of spintronic qubits, including analogs of charge, flux, and transmon superconducting qubits, can be implemented depending on the hierarchy of energy scales.

We introduce a new framework for designing DFAs tailored towards studying molecules adsorbed on transition-metal surfaces, building upon recent developments in non-self-consistent DFAs. We propose two functionals within this framework, demonstrating that transition-metal chemical accuracy can be achieved across a diverse set of 39 adsorption reactions while delivering consistent performance for 17 barrier heights.

The mode frequencies and couplings of the system are tuned electrostatically using a DC voltage, which also controls the strength of the interactions. Our theoretical model reproduces the experimentally observed avoided crossing in the absence of an AC drive and generates tunable frequency-comb spectra when a parametric drive is applied.

This allows us to reliably generate ultrasharp spin wave dynamics with broad frequency tunability from the pump and magnetic field. We show that the spontaneous mode can be phase-locked to a probe tone, similar to an auto-oscillator. Furthermore, the spontaneous dynamics can be used to implement a high-gain magnonic parametric amplifier with a gain up to 40 dB.

The leading dynamics is governed by a $U(1)$ Berry connection whose flux is set by the skyrmion density, while controlled non-adiabatic corrections are fixed by the texture's real-space quantum geometric tensor. In a Landau-level representation built from the averaged emergent field, moiré-periodic modulations induce Umklapp-resolved deformations of Girvin-MacDonald-Platzman kinematics and microscopic sources of excess optical quantum weight above the topological lower bound.

Here, a multiscale atomistic simulation framework is employed to investigate SHI-induced track formation and recovery in monoclinic beta-Ga2O3 over a wide range of electronic energy losses (Se) and crystallographic orientations. A sequence of distinct structural responses is identified with increasing Se: complete lattice recovery at low Se, recrystallization into a metastable gamma-Ga2O3 phase at intermediate Se, and the formation of core-shell ion tracks at high Se, consisting of an amorphous core surrounded by a recrystallized gamma-phase shell. Despite the essentially isotropic initial energy deposition, the final ion-track morphology exhibits pronounced crystallographic anisotropy, governed by orientation-dependent recovery dynamics. The superior recrystallization along [010] direction is attributed to its exceptionally high elastic stiffness. Notably, SHI irradiation perpendicular to the (100) plane induces a more severe structural response at low Se (less than 10 keV/nm), however, at higher Se, it yields a smaller residual ion track compared with the other orientations. The simulated ion-track sizes show excellent quantitative agreement with available experimental measurements over a broad range of Se values.

The analysis reveals a transition from antiferromagnetic $(π,π)$ order in the isotropic, half-filled system to non-collinear spiral $(π,q)$ order upon increasing the spin-dependent anisotropy or doping away from half-filling, ultimately entering a short-range correlation regime where stripe and spiral correlation coexist. These findings highlight a possible route to realizing spiral correlation in altermagnetic systems, potentially providing a platform for spintronic devices that exploit non-collinear spin textures."}

We show that their low energy band dispersions near the Fermi level may be deduced from its substacks in isolation. The analytical solutions of the momenta with zero eigenvalue for an AA stacking allows us to generalize the results of the zero energy momenta for arbitrarily stacked MLGs.

Consequently, the accuracy of determined molecular or polymer structures may be limited by unaccounted crystal inhomogeneities of the crystal lattice and the characterization of crystalline materials might not reveal the underlying causes of crystal morphology. Here we introduce X-ray convergent-beam diffraction to obtain spatially-resolved structural information from crystals by projection topographic imaging. Using highly focusing X-ray multilayer Laue lenses, we show that Bragg reflections can be mapped into tomographic images of the crystal, for the characterization of strain and defects at high resolution. We demonstrate how the crystal morphology obtained this way can be accounted for when determining structure factors as a function of position in the crystal.

Here we show that the arrow of time itself can be operationalized into a measurable physical quantity on mesoscopic particles - the eigen-phase displacement. This displacement gives rise to a non-local generalized force, the thermodynamic inertia force, which emerges from the integrated contribution of local constraints rather than as a conventional local force. It actively counteracts fluctuations and its algebraic structure is a semi-group, fundamentally distinct from the Lie group of Newton inertia, thereby encoding the irreversibility of time's arrow. Building on this foundation, we construct a unified Microstate-Sequence-Mode-Coupling (MSS-MCT) theory. Its thermodynamic limit is defined by Microstate Sequence (MSS) theory, and its dynamical action is captured by a consequent mode-coupling theory (MCT). From this single first-principles framework, we simultaneously resolve two long-standing puzzles: it predicts the giant non-Gaussian parameter(1~10), closing the order-of-magnitude gap with experiments that standard mode-coupling theory could not explain; and it delivers a first-principles, non-fitting derivation of the universal polymer constant $C_{1} \\approx 16.7$ with merely 1 percent error - the most accurate theoretical prediction to date, dramatically surpassing the Adam-Gibbs and others.

In SrRuO3, the antisymmetric exchange interaction produces a spin canting orthogonal to the easy axis, while in all other cases, spin canting is forbidden. Even when the canted magnetic moment in real space is forbidden, relativistic spin-momentum locking shows sizable contributions in k-space. Using prototypical ferromagnets such as orthorhombic SrRuO3, hexagonal CrTe and CrAs with the NiAs crystal structure, half-Heusler MnPtSb, and fcc Ni, we demonstrate that relativistic spin-momentum locking can generate strong effects in ferromagnets. Subdominant components of centrosymmetric ferro-magnetic materials with magnetic sites connected by rotational symmetry host spin-momentum locking similar to altermagnets, while noncentrosymmetric MnPtSb hosts relativistic p-wave due to the spin-orbit coupling. Fcc Ni shows a more complex behavior with a combination of two spin-momentum locking patterns characteristic of altermagnets. Because ferromagnets typically have larger bandwidths than altermagnets, they provide a promising platform for observing even-wave relativistic spin-momentum locking and associated emergent phenomena.

Two widely used methods for determining these efficiencies are based on ferromagnetic resonance (FMR), spin pumping FMR for the inverse effect, and spin-torque FMR for the direct effect. A key parameter to achieve accurate quantification, especially for spin-pumping FMR, is the RF field strength, $h_{\\mathrm{RF}}$. We present a comprehensive theoretical model and experimental protocol that allow a correct quantification of $h_{\\mathrm{RF}}$. It was validated by extensive experimental results and it was rigorously tested across various antennas geometries and ferromagnetic systems.

Through a systematic study of various 10-nm-thick ferromagnetic layers, such as Ni, NiFe, Fe, and CoFeB, we find that while Fe and CoFeB exhibit minimal rectification, Ni and NiFe generate strong rectified signals that must be corrected.

Instead, in quantum Hall systems, one can define an overcomplete basis of spatially localized coherent states. In this work, we propose a unified framework for understanding the quantum Hall effect and Chern insulators from the perspective of localized bases, by extending the overcomplete basis of coherent states to Chern bands in terms of coherent-like states. Specifically, by representing both coherent states and coherent-like states as wave packets defined on a band, the difference between them can be encoded solely in the functional form of the wave packet in momentum space. Furthermore, for filling factor $ν=1/3$, we define a local repulsive interaction Hamiltonian based on these bases and discuss properties of its ground states. In particular, by relating this Hamiltonian to previously studied models, we show that in quantum Hall systems it possesses exactly zero-energy ground states with topological degeneracy, thereby confirming that it serves as a model for fractional quantum Hall systems. In addition, we numerically verify that the Hamiltonian possesses topological degeneracy for representative Chern insulator models. An advantage of this formulation is that it allows fractional quantum Hall systems and various fractional Chern insulator systems to be discussed within a unified framework using the same Hamiltonian form. In addition, we discuss that coherent-like states can also be defined in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological insulators. Corresponding to the fermionic time-reversal symmetry of the system, Kramers-degenerate coherent-like states can be naturally defined. The localized basis constructed from coherent-like states is expected to be useful for describing strongly correlated topological phases in flat-band systems."}

We show that singular values, rather than eigenvalues, provide the only stable foundation for topological protection in non-Hermitian systems because they remain robust under translational-symmetry-breaking perturbations that destabilize the eigenvalue spectrum, rendering it unsuitable for topological classification. Building on Toeplitz operator theory, we establish general results for non-Hermitian Hamiltonians defined on half and quarter planes, relating the topological indices of the associated Toeplitz operators to the number of finite-size singular values that are separated from the bulk singular-value spectrum and vanish in the thermodynamic limit. This yields a precise bulk-boundary correspondence for edge and corner modes, including higher-order topological phases, without requiring crystalline symmetries. We illustrate our general results with detailed examples exhibiting topologically protected families of edge states, coexisting edge and corner modes, and phases with both gapped bulk and edges supporting only stable corner modes. The latter is exemplified by a non-Hermitian generalization of the Benalcazar-Bernevig-Hughes model."}

The emergence of a spin deviation from the local quantization axis of one residing QD is the prerequisite to implement the qubit gates. In this work, we study the non-adiabatic dynamics of a spin qubit shuttling between coupled QDs with inhomogeneous Landé g-tensors and a small magnetic field. The spin dynamics is analyzed through solving the time-dependent Schrödinger equation of the qubit under the effects of spin-orbit interaction and rapid ramping inter-dot detuning. The precondition, imposed on the ramping time and the tunnel-coupling strength, to ensure a high-fidelity inter-dot transfer is estimated. We then calculate the change in the spin orientation of a transferred qubit, and study the dependences of the spin deviation on the difference in the quantization axes of the two QDs, the tunnel-coupling strength, and the ramping time. We also demonstrate that the effect of multiple rounds of inter-dot bidirectional shuttling can be captured by an operator matrix, and evaluate the idling times required for realizing the single-qubit Pauli-X and Pauli-Y gates. Intriguingly, it is confirmed that a generalized Hadamard gate can be achieved through tuning the idling times."}

The topological phase diagram is computed numerically using two complementary approaches: twisted boundary conditions and the topological Hamiltonian technique. Our results show that strong disorder can act as a fundamental topological mechanism rather than merely a perturbation. For strong exchange coupling, tuning the mass parameter reveals a transition between phases with different Chern numbers $C$. Remarkably, this transition is driven by zeros, rather than poles, of the disorder-averaged Green's function crossing the chemical potential, and has no analogue in any clean system.

These models provide a computationally efficient continuum description and have been shown to agree well with atomistic approaches when the confinement potential is slowly varying on the lattice scale. In modern Si/SiGe heterostructures with atomically sharp interfaces and engineered Ge concentration profiles, however, the slowly varying potential approximation underlying conventional (local) envelope-function theory is challenged. We formulate an exact multi-valley envelope-function model by combining Burt-Foreman-type envelope-function theory, which does not rely on the assumption of a slowly varying potential, with a valley-sector decomposition of the Brillouin zone. This construction enforces band-limited envelopes, which satisfy a set of coupled integro-differential equations with a non-local potential energy operator. Using degenerate perturbation theory, we derive the intervalley coupling matrix element within this non-local model and prove that it is strictly invariant under global shifts of the confinement potential (choice of reference energy). We then show that the conventional local envelope model generically violates this invariance due to spectral leakage between valley sectors, leading to an unphysical energy-reference dependence of the intervalley coupling. The resulting ambiguity is quantified by numerical simulations of various engineered Si/SiGe heterostructures. Finally, we propose a simple spectrally filtered local approximation that restores the energy-reference invariance exactly and provides a good approximation to the exact non-local theory."}

A large majority of theoretical works focus on grain boundaries and coherent interfaces. Studies on semi-coherent interfaces are usually prohibited by the structural complexity, yielding models beyond the practical capability of density functional theory (DFT), or chemical complexity, restricted by the availability of (classical) interatomic potentials. This work investigates solute segregation to the coherent and semi-coherent $α$-Fe/Fe$_3$C interface in pearlite and its effect on mechanical properties using novel universal machine learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs). DFT calculated solution enthalpies, segregation energetics, and changes in cohesion at the coherent interface are used to benchmark several state-of-the-art uMLIPs. We find that the GRACE-2L-OAM and GRACE-2L-OMAT models most accurately reproduce the quantum-mechanical predictions. While Cu has the strongest segregation energy of $\\approx$ -0.3 eV to the coherent interface among the investigated tramp and trace elements, all of them, As, Cr, Cu, Mo, Ni, P, Sb, and Sn, exhibit significantly more negative segregation values reaching below $\\approx$ -1.5 eV in the presence of the misfit dislocation at the semi-coherent interface. The deepest traps are identified in the vicinity of the dislocation core, although the spatial distribution of segregation energies differs markedly among the solute species. The cohesion of the coherent interface is strongly reduced by Sb, Sn, P, and As, and only mildly by Cu, whereas Ni shows a negligible effect, and Cr and Mo slightly enhance cohesion. In contrast, all investigated solutes (except for P) tend to embrittle the semi-coherent interface, with Sn and, especially, Sb having the strongest impact in tensile tests performed in the out-of-plane direction.

While bulk FeTe is non-superconducting with a long-range bicollinear antiferromagnetic order, superconductivity has been achieved in thin films. However, the approaches usually involve complex oxygen incorporation or interfacial effects, the microscopic mechanisms of which remain elusive. Here, we prepare high-purity, bare FeTe thin films on SrTiO3 and investigate their magnetic and superconducting states combining both microscopic and macroscopic characterizations. By reducing the interstitial Fe impurities, we successfully suppress the long-range antiferromagnetic order, enhance the quasiparticle coherence and induce superconductivity at ~10 K. Moreover, this process is readily reversible by tuning the Fe concentration. Our findings reveal that precise stoichiometric control is sufficient to induce intrinsic superconductivity in strained FeTe thin films. This work provides insights into the competition between magnetism and superconductivity in iron chalcogenides, and supplies a robust pathway for developing stable, high-purity superconducting FeTe films."}

Within this family, most members exhibit planar $d$-wave spin splitting, whereas CuF$_2$ shows bulk $d$-wave splitting with an explicit $k_z$ dependence. In this work, we show that this transition from planar to bulk $d$-wave splitting in CuF$_2$ is primarily driven by the antipolar displacements of the F ions, which are absent in the tetragonal rutile structure of the other family members. Our calculations reveal that these additional structural distortions introduce an extra plane of anisotropic magnetization density, giving rise to an additional totally symmetric component of the magnetic octupole tensor. The $k$-space representation of this octupole component, consequently, dictates an additional direction of spin splitting, thereby transforming the $d$-wave spin splitting pattern from planar to bulk-like. We further analyze the effect of spin-orbit coupling on the magnetic octupoles and the resulting spin splitting in the band structure. Our work highlights the possibility of controlling the pattern of nonrelativistic spin splitting through structural modifications, for example, via the application of external pressure."}

We introduce MLIP-MC, an open-source Python framework to conduct GCMC simulations with MLIPs, and use this framework to benchmark a series of universal models, including MACE-MP-0, ORB-v3, and fairchem ODAC, for CO2 adsorption on ZIF-8, ZIF-4, and Mg-MOF-74.

Instead, in quantum Hall systems, one can define an overcomplete basis of spatially localized coherent states. In this work, we propose a unified framework for understanding the quantum Hall effect and Chern insulators from the perspective of localized bases, by extending the overcomplete basis of coherent states to Chern bands in terms of coherent-like states. Specifically, by representing both coherent states and coherent-like states as wave packets defined on a band, the difference between them can be encoded solely in the functional form of the wave packet in momentum space. Furthermore, for filling factor $ν=1/3$, we define a local repulsive interaction Hamiltonian based on these bases and discuss properties of its ground states. In particular, by relating this Hamiltonian to previously studied models, we show that in quantum Hall systems it possesses exactly zero-energy ground states with topological degeneracy, thereby confirming that it serves as a model for fractional quantum Hall systems. In addition, we numerically verify that the Hamiltonian possesses topological degeneracy for representative Chern insulator models. An advantage of this formulation is that it allows fractional quantum Hall systems and various fractional Chern insulator systems to be discussed within a unified framework using the same Hamiltonian form. In addition, we discuss that coherent-like states can also be defined in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological insulators. Corresponding to the fermionic time-reversal symmetry of the system, Kramers-degenerate coherent-like states can be naturally defined. The localized basis constructed from coherent-like states is expected to be useful for describing strongly correlated topological phases in flat-band systems."}

The predictive accuracy of machine-learning models was first evaluated for single-dopant Pt configurations, demonstrating that the selected structural and chemical descriptors reliably capture the key factors governing dopant stability.

The central element of our framework is the construction of a radially ordered set of maximally localized basis for Chern bands without requiring continuous rotational symmetry. Within this basis, the complex many-body problem simplifies to a real-space organizing principle: a stable FCI occurs if the orbitals excluded around central electrons are those maximizing the two-body interaction energy. We validate this with direct numerical evidence for composite boson formation in the Haldane model, demonstrating that our criterion reliably characterizes FCIs. Importantly, our analysis illustrates that the composite boson framework bridges the fractional quantum Hall effect in continuum and lattice paradigms, providing a unified and intuitive real-space interpretation for distinct correlated phases. It thus establishes a foundation for diagnosing and guiding the design of both Abelian and non-Abelian topologically ordered phases across distinct platforms."}

Structural and compositional analyses reveal that Ru deficiency is intrinsic to the films, with an enhanced deficiency at the interfaces. As a result, coherent electronic transport is suppressed and the saturation magnetization is reduced, while the Curie temperature remains largely unaffected, placing Ru-deficient SRO in a regime consistent with ferromagnetic insulator-like behavior. Depth- and lateral-resolved magnetic measurements further show that the interfacial regions remain ferromagnetic but exhibit enhanced perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, which constrains the local magnetization to remain predominantly out-of-plane and strongly reduces its in-plane projection.

The complete electronic level structure in the relevant energy range is elucidated by combining polarization-resolved spectroscopy, group-theoretical analysis, quantum embedding calculations and first-principles optical lineshape modeling. Collectively, these results provide a microscopic understanding of the $\\mathrm{V_{Si}^{-}}$\\ electronic structure. Our approach also establishes a general framework for resolving and understanding complex excited-state manifolds in wide-bandgap color centers."}

Using density functional theory calculations, we aim to show relativistic spin-momentum locking in ferromagnets, focusing on a broad class of ferromagnetic materials with magnetic sites connected by rotational symmetry, and compare with fcc Ni. In SrRuO3, the antisymmetric exchange interaction produces a spin canting orthogonal to the easy axis, while in all other cases, spin canting is forbidden. Even when the canted magnetic moment in real space is forbidden, relativistic spin-momentum locking shows sizable contributions in k-space. Using prototypical ferromagnets such as orthorhombic SrRuO3, hexagonal CrTe and CrAs with the NiAs crystal structure, half-Heusler MnPtSb, and fcc Ni, we demonstrate that relativistic spin-momentum locking can generate strong effects in ferromagnets. Subdominant components of centrosymmetric ferro-magnetic materials with magnetic sites connected by rotational symmetry host spin-momentum locking similar to altermagnets, while noncentrosymmetric MnPtSb hosts relativistic p-wave due to the spin-orbit coupling. Fcc Ni shows a more complex behavior with a combination of two spin-momentum locking patterns characteristic of altermagnets. Because ferromagnets typically have larger bandwidths than altermagnets, they provide a promising platform for observing even-wave relativistic spin-momentum locking and associated emergent phenomena. From an application standpoint, relativistic spin-momentum locking governs symmetry-allowed spin Hall currents, spin photocurrents, and other momentum-dependent spin responses in k-space."}

This value is among the highest TBC values reported for semiconductor interfaces, confirmed by structural characterizations which show an ultrahigh-quality interface. Atomistic Green Function calculations reveal that elastic phonon transmission dominates the interface, with nearly half of the acoustic modes (0-15 THz) exhibiting near-unity transmission due to the atomically sharp structure. Furthermore, using high-energy-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy, we probe vibrational properties with nanometer spatial resolution and identify unique interfacial phonon modes connecting the mismatched phonon spectra, confirmed by molecular dynamics simulations. The ultrahigh TBC is attributed to both the high elastic phonon transmission due to the high quality interfaces and the inelastic phonon scattering channel due to interfacial phonon modes. These findings not only advance the fundamental understanding of interfacial thermal transport but also provide a pathway for effective thermal management in emerging electronic devices."}

Stacking domains translated in nonequivalent directions yields patterns resembling cubic ice (Ic) along [0001] but with a 3-fold symmetry.

To describe the quantum properties of excitons in the QD chain, a model Hamiltonian is used, taking into account the coupling of neighboring QDs due to dipole-dipole interaction. The localization of stationary states is calculated depending on the magnitude of disorder and the chain length. A criterion is introduced that determines the boundaries of the phase transition from the localized to the delocalized excitation phase. The dynamics of exciton transfer along the QD chain is calculated depending on its length and degree of disorder for linear excitation of the system by a laser pulse. It is shown that dynamic localization emerging in the system corresponds to the stationary localization properties of the states of the chain with a side defect."}

Depth- and lateral-resolved magnetic measurements further show that the interfacial regions remain ferromagnetic but exhibit enhanced perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, which constrains the local magnetization to remain predominantly out-of-plane and strongly reduces its in-plane projection.

Building on Toeplitz operator theory, we establish general results for non-Hermitian Hamiltonians defined on half and quarter planes, relating the topological indices of the associated Toeplitz operators to the number of finite-size singular values that are separated from the bulk singular-value spectrum and vanish in the thermodynamic limit. This yields a precise bulk-boundary correspondence for edge and corner modes, including higher-order topological phases, without requiring crystalline symmetries. We illustrate our general results with detailed examples exhibiting topologically protected families of edge states, coexisting edge and corner modes, and phases with both gapped bulk and edges supporting only stable corner modes.

While originally attributed to a nonlinear charge current response, it was recently shown that these currents could instead be attributed to the anisotropic Seebeck coefficients of the materials. Here, we confirm that anomalous photocurrents observed in TaIrTe$_4$ under either visible or far-infrared far-field illumination originate from the large transverse thermoelectric effect. We engineer the mutual orientation of crystal edges and electrodes as well as the thermal environment of TaIrTe$_4$ to control and amplify its spatial photocurrent response.

AA stacking exhibits nearly double the cross-plane thermal conductivity of AB stacking, driven by longer acoustic phonon lifetimes from a more \"coherent\" interlayer registry. Integrated deep neural-network molecular dynamics reveals that phonon filtering in ReS2 is fundamentally frequency-selective: weak vdW coupling acts as a low-pass filter, whereas stronger coupling broadens the transmission passband. These results establish ReS2 as a model system where stacking order and interlayer coupling can be engineered to tune heat conduction across diffusive, quasi-ballistic, and ballistic regimes, offering a new framework for thermal management in 2D electronics."}

Hence, the NV charge state is emerging as a powerful all-optical platform for nanoscale sensing and imaging. Although significant progress has been made in engineering near-surface NV centers in bulk diamond, controlling the NV charge state in fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) has proven challenging, limiting the sensitivity and reliability of FND-based charge state sensing. Here, we demonstrate reliable, reversible switching between the fluorescent NV$^0$ and non-fluorescent NV$^+$ charge states in sub-30 nm FNDs via surface oxidation and hydrogenation, respectively, for single particles and particle powder. In aqueous electrochemical cells, we demonstrate voltage and ion concentration imaging based on the NV charge state in self-assembled FND layers on transparent substrates. Applied voltages reliably modulate the FND PL with a sensitivity of up to 16 mV Hz$^{-1/2}$. Importantly, FND PL is also modulated by local changes in salt concentration with a sensitivity of up to 1.8% per millimolar NaCl, enabling all-optical imaging of ion concentration gradients at the microscale. Our results represent a significant step toward realizing fast, stable, and scalable nanoscale charge- and voltage-imaging technologies with sub-micrometer spatial resolution."}

While deposited metal films offer excellent scalability for nanodevices, achieving ballistic transport in these films poses a challenge due to their short electronic mean free path.

Instead, in quantum Hall systems, one can define an overcomplete basis of spatially localized coherent states. In this work, we propose a unified framework for understanding the quantum Hall effect and Chern insulators from the perspective of localized bases, by extending the overcomplete basis of coherent states to Chern bands in terms of coherent-like states. Specifically, by representing both coherent states and coherent-like states as wave packets defined on a band, the difference between them can be encoded solely in the functional form of the wave packet in momentum space. Furthermore, for filling factor $ν=1/3$, we define a local repulsive interaction Hamiltonian based on these bases and discuss properties of its ground states. In particular, by relating this Hamiltonian to previously studied models, we show that in quantum Hall systems it possesses exactly zero-energy ground states with topological degeneracy, thereby confirming that it serves as a model for fractional quantum Hall systems. In addition, we numerically verify that the Hamiltonian possesses topological degeneracy for representative Chern insulator models. An advantage of this formulation is that it allows fractional quantum Hall systems and various fractional Chern insulator systems to be discussed within a unified framework using the same Hamiltonian form. In addition, we discuss that coherent-like states can also be defined in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological insulators. Corresponding to the fermionic time-reversal symmetry of the system, Kramers-degenerate coherent-like states can be naturally defined. The localized basis constructed from coherent-like states is expected to be useful for describing strongly correlated topological phases in flat-band systems."}

This value is among the highest TBC values reported for semiconductor interfaces, confirmed by structural characterizations which show an ultrahigh-quality interface. Atomistic Green Function calculations reveal that elastic phonon transmission dominates the interface, with nearly half of the acoustic modes (0-15 THz) exhibiting near-unity transmission due to the atomically sharp structure. Furthermore, using high-energy-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy, we probe vibrational properties with nanometer spatial resolution and identify unique interfacial phonon modes connecting the mismatched phonon spectra, confirmed by molecular dynamics simulations. The ultrahigh TBC is attributed to both the high elastic phonon transmission due to the high quality interfaces and the inelastic phonon scattering channel due to interfacial phonon modes. These findings not only advance the fundamental understanding of interfacial thermal transport but also provide a pathway for effective thermal management in emerging electronic devices."}

Even more surprising has been the efficient charge generation in neat Y6 devices, where there is no energetic offset at all. Here, we simulate charge transport and separation in Y6 using delocalised kinetic Monte Carlo (dKMC) parameterised using atomistic calculations, thus taking into account the often-neglected ingredients of delocalisation, disorder, and polaron formation. Including delocalisation predicts higher carrier mobilities and exciton diffusion coefficients than is possible with classical simulations, bringing them into agreement with experimental values. Delocalisation also predicts higher charge-generation efficiencies in neat Y6, in agreement with experimental measurements.

Here, we introduce a real-space theoretical framework in which FCIs are understood in terms of composite bosons, local objects consisting of electrons bound to their energetically excluded surrounding orbitals. The central element of our framework is the construction of a radially ordered set of maximally localized basis for Chern bands without requiring continuous rotational symmetry. Within this basis, the complex many-body problem simplifies to a real-space organizing principle: a stable FCI occurs if the orbitals excluded around central electrons are those maximizing the two-body interaction energy. We validate this with direct numerical evidence for composite boson formation in the Haldane model, demonstrating that our criterion reliably characterizes FCIs. Importantly, our analysis illustrates that the composite boson framework bridges the fractional quantum Hall effect in continuum and lattice paradigms, providing a unified and intuitive real-space interpretation for distinct correlated phases. It thus establishes a foundation for diagnosing and guiding the design of both Abelian and non-Abelian topologically ordered phases across distinct platforms."}

Here, we prepare high-purity, bare FeTe thin films on SrTiO3 and investigate their magnetic and superconducting states combining both microscopic and macroscopic characterizations. By reducing the interstitial Fe impurities, we successfully suppress the long-range antiferromagnetic order, enhance the quasiparticle coherence and induce superconductivity at ~10 K. Moreover, this process is readily reversible by tuning the Fe concentration. Our findings reveal that precise stoichiometric control is sufficient to induce intrinsic superconductivity in strained FeTe thin films.

Consequently, the accuracy of determined molecular or polymer structures may be limited by unaccounted crystal inhomogeneities of the crystal lattice and the characterization of crystalline materials might not reveal the underlying causes of crystal morphology. Here we introduce X-ray convergent-beam diffraction to obtain spatially-resolved structural information from crystals by projection topographic imaging. Using highly focusing X-ray multilayer Laue lenses, we show that Bragg reflections can be mapped into tomographic images of the crystal, for the characterization of strain and defects at high resolution. We demonstrate how the crystal morphology obtained this way can be accounted for when determining structure factors as a function of position in the crystal.

We present a comprehensive theoretical model and experimental protocol that allow a correct quantification of $h_{\\mathrm{RF}}$. It was validated by extensive experimental results and it was rigorously tested across various antennas geometries and ferromagnetic systems.

Here, by studying the driven critical dynamics from a gapless ordered phase in the bilayer Heisenberg model, we unveil that the approaches to the scaling region dominated by the KZ scaling limit with $RL^r\\gg1$ are {\\it non-commutative}: this scaling region is inaccessible for large $R$ and finite medium $L$, while merely accessible for large $L$ and moderately finite $R$. We attribute this to the memory effect induced by the finite-size correction in the gapless ordered phase. This non-commutative property makes $m^2$ still strongly depends on the system size and deviates from $m^2\\propto R^{2β/νr}$ even for large $R$. We further show that a similar correction applies to the imaginary-time relaxation dynamics. Our results establish an essential extension of nonequilibrium scaling theory with a gapless ordered initial state."}

A large majority of theoretical works focus on grain boundaries and coherent interfaces. Studies on semi-coherent interfaces are usually prohibited by the structural complexity, yielding models beyond the practical capability of density functional theory (DFT), or chemical complexity, restricted by the availability of (classical) interatomic potentials. This work investigates solute segregation to the coherent and semi-coherent $α$-Fe/Fe$_3$C interface in pearlite and its effect on mechanical properties using novel universal machine learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs). DFT calculated solution enthalpies, segregation energetics, and changes in cohesion at the coherent interface are used to benchmark several state-of-the-art uMLIPs. We find that the GRACE-2L-OAM and GRACE-2L-OMAT models most accurately reproduce the quantum-mechanical predictions. While Cu has the strongest segregation energy of $\\approx$ -0.3 eV to the coherent interface among the investigated tramp and trace elements, all of them, As, Cr, Cu, Mo, Ni, P, Sb, and Sn, exhibit significantly more negative segregation values reaching below $\\approx$ -1.5 eV in the presence of the misfit dislocation at the semi-coherent interface. The deepest traps are identified in the vicinity of the dislocation core, although the spatial distribution of segregation energies differs markedly among the solute species. The cohesion of the coherent interface is strongly reduced by Sb, Sn, P, and As, and only mildly by Cu, whereas Ni shows a negligible effect, and Cr and Mo slightly enhance cohesion. In contrast, all investigated solutes (except for P) tend to embrittle the semi-coherent interface, with Sn and, especially, Sb having the strongest impact in tensile tests performed in the out-of-plane direction.

Within this family, most members exhibit planar $d$-wave spin splitting, whereas CuF$_2$ shows bulk $d$-wave splitting with an explicit $k_z$ dependence. In this work, we show that this transition from planar to bulk $d$-wave splitting in CuF$_2$ is primarily driven by the antipolar displacements of the F ions, which are absent in the tetragonal rutile structure of the other family members. Our calculations reveal that these additional structural distortions introduce an extra plane of anisotropic magnetization density, giving rise to an additional totally symmetric component of the magnetic octupole tensor. The $k$-space representation of this octupole component, consequently, dictates an additional direction of spin splitting, thereby transforming the $d$-wave spin splitting pattern from planar to bulk-like. We further analyze the effect of spin-orbit coupling on the magnetic octupoles and the resulting spin splitting in the band structure. Our work highlights the possibility of controlling the pattern of nonrelativistic spin splitting through structural modifications, for example, via the application of external pressure."}

However, many applications require non-superconducting junctions, either standalone or in combination with superconducting technology, motivating efforts to suppress Al superconductivity through magnetic fields, doping, or proximity effects -- approaches that so far suffered from integration compatibility and scalability issues.

The predictive accuracy of machine-learning models was first evaluated for single-dopant Pt configurations, demonstrating that the selected structural and chemical descriptors reliably capture the key factors governing dopant stability.

A thermal population of electromagnetic modes leads to a divergence in the energy-loss probability at low frequencies, which in turn produces a pronounced temperature dependence. We show that this effect can be exploited for nanoscale thermometry, predicting that optimized energy-filtered holography enables $\\sim0.1\\%$ changes in fringe visibility for physically viable temperature variations in metals. Through these results, we establish a unified theoretical framework to describe free-electron decoherence in the bulk and surfaces of arbitrary materials."}

We provide a complete time-resolved characterization of the nonequilibrium dynamics through the evolution of the position variances and the entropy production within the framework of stochastic thermodynamics, enabling a quantitative comparison with direct relaxation and a suboptimal protocol. In addition, we employ information-geometric tools -- recently referred to as thermal kinematics -- to track the system's path in state space with a single dynamical quantity. Our results show that faster equilibration requires a larger entropy production and an increased thermodynamic length, revealing a direct trade-off between temporal optimality and thermodynamic cost in multidimensional stochastic systems driven by a single intensive control parameter."}

At the 1/2 magnetization plateau, obvious hysteresis has been observed in the magnetoresistance and Hall resistivity during the rise and fall of the magnetic field. However, hysteresis vanishes in the corresponding measurements of magnetization, indicating the existence of degenerate states with the same net magnetization but different electronic transport properties.

On top of the VQE ground state, signatures of the chiral topological order are revealed using the recently proposed tangent space excitation ansatz for quantum circuits.

The emergence of a spin deviation from the local quantization axis of one residing QD is the prerequisite to implement the qubit gates. In this work, we study the non-adiabatic dynamics of a spin qubit shuttling between coupled QDs with inhomogeneous Landé g-tensors and a small magnetic field. The spin dynamics is analyzed through solving the time-dependent Schrödinger equation of the qubit under the effects of spin-orbit interaction and rapid ramping inter-dot detuning. The precondition, imposed on the ramping time and the tunnel-coupling strength, to ensure a high-fidelity inter-dot transfer is estimated. We then calculate the change in the spin orientation of a transferred qubit, and study the dependences of the spin deviation on the difference in the quantization axes of the two QDs, the tunnel-coupling strength, and the ramping time. We also demonstrate that the effect of multiple rounds of inter-dot bidirectional shuttling can be captured by an operator matrix, and evaluate the idling times required for realizing the single-qubit Pauli-X and Pauli-Y gates. Intriguingly, it is confirmed that a generalized Hadamard gate can be achieved through tuning the idling times."}

These models provide a computationally efficient continuum description and have been shown to agree well with atomistic approaches when the confinement potential is slowly varying on the lattice scale. In modern Si/SiGe heterostructures with atomically sharp interfaces and engineered Ge concentration profiles, however, the slowly varying potential approximation underlying conventional (local) envelope-function theory is challenged. We formulate an exact multi-valley envelope-function model by combining Burt-Foreman-type envelope-function theory, which does not rely on the assumption of a slowly varying potential, with a valley-sector decomposition of the Brillouin zone. This construction enforces band-limited envelopes, which satisfy a set of coupled integro-differential equations with a non-local potential energy operator. Using degenerate perturbation theory, we derive the intervalley coupling matrix element within this non-local model and prove that it is strictly invariant under global shifts of the confinement potential (choice of reference energy). We then show that the conventional local envelope model generically violates this invariance due to spectral leakage between valley sectors, leading to an unphysical energy-reference dependence of the intervalley coupling. The resulting ambiguity is quantified by numerical simulations of various engineered Si/SiGe heterostructures. Finally, we propose a simple spectrally filtered local approximation that restores the energy-reference invariance exactly and provides a good approximation to the exact non-local theory."}

Hexagonal FeS (h-FeS) is a recently identified altermagnet candidate that shows a spontaneous anomalous Hall effect (AHE) accompanied by a tiny net magnetization. Here, we show that both the spontaneous AHE and magnetization can be effectively suppressed by an in-plane compressive strain. Since neutron diffraction measurements show that the applied uniaxial strain only modifies the in-plane domain population but does not affect the in-plane magnetic structure, the major effect of the applied strain is to tune the small $c$-axis ferromagnetic moment. Our results demonstrate a strong correlation between the tiny net magnetization and the spontaneous AHE in h-FeS, and show that uniaxial strain provides an effective knob to tune both properties in this altermagnet candidate for spintronic applications."}

In the M-phase the large correlation charge gap strongly suppresses the critical current, while the S-phase behaves as a $0$-junction, with a proximitized gap that closes for $φ=π$ to yield a correlated metal. Phase bias and junction transparency can thus serve as tuning knobs to switch between conducting and insulating regimes. Working within the dynamical mean field theory using the numerical renormalization group as the impurity solver, we associate M- and S-phase solutions with the doublet and singlet fixed points of the underlying superconducting Anderson impurity problem. We obtain detailed insight into the spectral structure on all energy scales. In the M-phase, the self-energy has sub-gap resonances symmetrically located around the Fermi level resulting from the splitting of the ''mid-gap pole'' found in Mott insulators; this structure accounts for phase insensitivity."}

We identify multiple electron- and hole-like bulk bands, yielding a near-perfect carrier compensation. Crucially, we observe open-orbit FSs parallel to $\\bar{L}$-$\\bar{Y}$ direction that are entirely of surface origin. Circular-dichroism ARPES reveals $k \\rightarrow -k$ spectral reversal, indicating spin-momentum locking and the topological nature of these surface states. Consistent with this, magnetotransport measurements display weak antilocalization, establishing TaSb$_2$ as a platform for spin-polarized topological transport on a weakly topological surface."}

Using an improved dynamical density-matrix renormalization group method, we investigate the relevant intermediate $J_2$ regime for cylinders with circumferences from 6 to 9. Depending on the initial state and boundary conditions, we find two {\\it distinct} variational states. The higher energy state is consistent with a Dirac QSL. In the lower-energy state, both the static and dynamical properties are qualitatively similar to the magnetically ordered state at $J_2=0$, suggestive of either a weakly magnetically ordered non-QSL or a gapped QSL proximate to a continuous transition to such an ordered state."}

In contrast, lower sputtering pressure promotes void filling in deposited films, favouring the growth of dense, low roughness columnar films. Modification of native SiOx on Si surfaces via substrate preheating prior to deposition, alters the initial nucleation stage, thereby determining dominant polarity and morphology of ZnO nanostructures. O polar columnar films and nanocolumns exhibit higher effective piezoelectric coefficient, corresponding to their higher differential resistance and reduced dielectric loss, suggesting suppressed carrier induced screening of piezoelectric charges. This low thermal budget, scalable sputtering approach provides an alternative route for integrating ZnO nanostructures onto thermal constrained substrates, including those used in flexible and wearable electronics."}

Here, we show that this pattern commonly arises from intrinsic basal stacking faults instead. A translational boundary separating domains of comparable thickness, with an in-plane offset of (2/3a + 1/3b), produces this honeycomb-like contrast. Stacking domains translated in nonequivalent directions yields patterns resembling cubic ice (Ic) along [0001] but with a 3-fold symmetry. We imaged this structure at a record-breaking line resolution of 89 picometers, finer than the O-H covalent bond length. These findings highlight the defect tolerance of ice's molecular packing and clarify the structural relationships among hexagonal, stacking-disordered, and cubic ice phases. This resolution milestone opens new avenues for characterizing subtle structural perturbations of water in the solid state."}

Ru-deficient SRO thin films grown by radio-frequency high oxygen pressure sputtering were investigated using a combination of X-ray reflectivity, polarized neutron reflectometry, off-specular neutron scattering, scanning transmission electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, electrical transport, and magnetometry. Structural and compositional analyses reveal that Ru deficiency is intrinsic to the films, with an enhanced deficiency at the interfaces. As a result, coherent electronic transport is suppressed and the saturation magnetization is reduced, while the Curie temperature remains largely unaffected, placing Ru-deficient SRO in a regime consistent with ferromagnetic insulator-like behavior. Depth- and lateral-resolved magnetic measurements further show that the interfacial regions remain ferromagnetic but exhibit enhanced perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, which constrains the local magnetization to remain predominantly out-of-plane and strongly reduces its in-plane projection. Our results establish Ru deficiency as a key control parameter governing transport, magnetization, and anisotropy in SRO thin films and highlight defect and interface engineering as powerful routes to tailor interfacial magnetism in correlated oxide heterostructures."}

Our results point to polarization-resolved optics and anisotropic transport as direct probes of textured altermagnetic states, and suggest a simple route to direction-selectivity."}

The emergence of these photocurrents is inherently linked to symmetry breaking and anisotropy of their crystal lattices. Studies of type-II Weyl semimetals of group C$_{2v}$ (WTe$_2$, MoTe$_2$, TaIrTe$_4$) have reported anomalous, nonlocal photocurrents localized to crystals edges or far from electrodes, which are highly dependent on the geometry of the material sample. While originally attributed to a nonlinear charge current response, it was recently shown that these currents could instead be attributed to the anisotropic Seebeck coefficients of the materials. Here, we confirm that anomalous photocurrents observed in TaIrTe$_4$ under either visible or far-infrared far-field illumination originate from the large transverse thermoelectric effect. We engineer the mutual orientation of crystal edges and electrodes as well as the thermal environment of TaIrTe$_4$ to control and amplify its spatial photocurrent response. We show that substrate engineering can locally enhance photocurrent. This framework of thermal device engineering can enable broadband photo detection schemes by leveraging spectral and spatial dependence of photocurrents for applications like wavefront sensing, beam positioning, and edge detection."}

Shi", "Timothy Berkelbach"], "title": "Practical and improved density functionals for computational catalysis on metal surfaces", "comment": null, "summary": "Density functional theory (DFT) has been critical towards our current atomistic understanding of catalysis on transition-metal surfaces. It has opened new paradigms in rational catalyst design, predicting fundamental properties, like the adsorption energy and reaction barriers, linked to catalytic performance. However, such applications depend sensitively on the predictive accuracy of DFT and achieving experimental-level reliability, so-called transition-metal chemical accuracy (13 kJ/mol), remains challenging for present density functional approximations (DFAs) or even methods beyond DFT. We introduce a new framework for designing DFAs tailored towards studying molecules adsorbed on transition-metal surfaces, building upon recent developments in non-self-consistent DFAs. We propose two functionals within this framework, demonstrating that transition-metal chemical accuracy can be achieved across a diverse set of 39 adsorption reactions while delivering consistent performance for 17 barrier heights. Moreover, we show that these non-self-consistent DFAs address qualitative failures that challenge current self-consistent DFAs, such as CO adsorption on Pt(111) and graphene on Ni(111). The resulting functionals are computationally practical and compatible with existing DFT codes, with scripts and workflows provided to use them. Looking ahead, this framework establishes a path toward developing more accurate and sophisticated DFAs for computational heterogeneous catalysis and beyond."}

We analyze the mechanisms by which the magnetoelastic couplings renormalize the critical temperature and modify the phonon spectrum. The magnetoelastic feeback can also alter fundamentally the nature of the phase transition. Specifically, on the square lattice, the transition shifts from continuous to weakly first-order (discontinuous) beyond a critical magnetoelastic coupling threshold. Conversely, on the triangular lattice, the transition remains discontinuous regardless of coupling strength."}

We demonstrate that stacking order is an effective control knob for cross-plane phonon transport in multilayer Rhenium Disulfide (ReS2). Thickness-dependent thermal conductivity measurements reveal remarkably long cross-plane phonon mean free paths (MFPs) (>= 200-300 nm) and provide a direct experimental observation of the transition from quasi-ballistic transport to a thickness-independent ballistic limit. AA stacking exhibits nearly double the cross-plane thermal conductivity of AB stacking, driven by longer acoustic phonon lifetimes from a more \"coherent\" interlayer registry. Integrated deep neural-network molecular dynamics reveals that phonon filtering in ReS2 is fundamentally frequency-selective: weak vdW coupling acts as a low-pass filter, whereas stronger coupling broadens the transmission passband. These results establish ReS2 as a model system where stacking order and interlayer coupling can be engineered to tune heat conduction across diffusive, quasi-ballistic, and ballistic regimes, offering a new framework for thermal management in 2D electronics."}

For disordered superconductors, the optical conductivity often can be described within Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory, while in corresponding tunneling experiments, deviations in the observed DOS typically require modelling by the phenomenological Dynes formula. The implications of such Dynes DOS for optics were rarely discussed so far. Here we probe the terahertz conductivity of superconducting NbN thin films with thicknesses ranging from 4.5 to 20nm, which were grown by atomic layer deposition (ALD). Our frequency range from 0.3 to 2.1 THz covers energies below and above the spectral gap. For 20nm thick NbN, we find in the optical conductivity distinct deviations from the BCS model, including a step-like characteristic in the absorption at half the zero-temperature spectral gap. These observations can be fully captured by Dynes electrodynamics with a small and temperature-independent pair-breaking rate. For the other films, we also observe signs of Dynes electrodynamics, and we discuss the evolution of the energy gap, the superfluid density, and the pair-breaking rate as function of film thickness."}

An exact local $SU(2)$ transformation reveals an emergent non-Abelian gauge field; for large branch splitting we perform an operator-level Schrieffer-Wolff expansion, yielding a single-branch Hamiltonian together with systematically dressed physical operators that define the projected interacting theory beyond strict adiabaticity. The leading dynamics is governed by a $U(1)$ Berry connection whose flux is set by the skyrmion density, while controlled non-adiabatic corrections are fixed by the texture's real-space quantum geometric tensor. In a Landau-level representation built from the averaged emergent field, moiré-periodic modulations induce Umklapp-resolved deformations of Girvin-MacDonald-Platzman kinematics and microscopic sources of excess optical quantum weight above the topological lower bound. Assuming a gapped Hall phase, we further derive a skyrmion-crystal effective field theory with a universal Berry-phase term and a noncommutative magnetophonon.
