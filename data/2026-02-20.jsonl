By exploiting uncertainty estimates from the surrogate representation, we show that the number of force evaluations required to converge an instanton path becomes effectively independent of the number of beads used to discretize the pathway. To reduce the computational overhead associated with training, particularly when Hessian information is included, we implement graphics processing unit accelerated black box matrix matrix multiplication, achieving an order of magnitude speedups relative to standard implementations. For rate calculations, we introduce a selective Hessian training strategy that distinguishes flexible modes strongly coupled to the transferring proton from more rigid modes weakly coupled to the reaction coordinate. This enables the construction of accurate surrogate potential energy surfaces with substantially fewer Hessian evaluations. Applications to malonaldehyde and Z-3-aminopropenal demonstrate that tunneling rates can be predicted within 20% of exact values while reducing force and Hessian evaluations. The approach is further extended to tunneling splitting calculations for the formic acid dimer and malonaldehyde, yielding splittings in reasonable agreement with experiment and high level theoretical results."}

We introduce stochastic tensor contraction to perform such operations with greatly reduced cost, and present its application to the gold-standard quantum chemistry method, coupled cluster theory with up to perturbative triples. For total energy errors more stringent than chemical accuracy, we reduce the computational scaling to that of mean-field theory, while starting to approach the mean-field absolute cost, thereby challenging the existing cost-to-accuracy landscape. Benchmarks against state-of-the-art local correlation approximations further show that we achieve an order-of-magnitude improvement in both total computation time and error, with significantly reduced sensitivity to system dimensionality and electron delocalization. We conclude that stochastic tensor contraction is a powerful computational primitive to accelerate a wide range of quantum chemistry."}

At its heart lies the exchange-correlation functional, a quantity which exactly encapsulates the many-body effects stemming from the quantum mechanical interactions between the electrons. Yet, the exact functional is unknown, and computationally tractable approximations are therefore necessary for practical applications. Over the past six decades, hundreds of density functional approximations have been proposed with varying degrees of accuracy and computational efficiency.\n  This review surveys the theoretical foundations of semi-local functionals, including local density approximations, generalized gradient approximations, and meta-generalized gradient approximations. We provide a comprehensive, consistently organized discussion that consolidates both historical developments and recent advances in this field. Beginning with the essential concepts of Kohn-Sham density functional theory, we present the construction principles of semi-local exchange-correlation functionals. Special attention is given to the physical motivations underlying functional development, the mathematical properties that guide their construction, and the practical considerations that determine their applicability across different chemical and physical systems.\n  This work is intended to serve as both a introduction for newcomers to the field and a comprehensive reference for practitioners. By consolidating the extensive literature on semi-local functionals and providing a unified framework for understanding their construction and application, we aim to facilitate further developments in density functional approximations and their use in tackling the diverse challenges of modern computational chemistry and condensed matter physics."}

This feature limits their use for processes like diffusion bonding, where the interfaces might need to remain distinct under certain thermodynamic conditions. We develop a kinetic phase-field model to address this problem, using an evolution equation based on a geometric conservation law for interfaces, rather than the gradient descent evolution that is typical in phase-field modeling. This formulation enables us to specify complex kinetic laws, and we use this to incorporate a physically-motivated geometric criterion to control interface merging. This criterion, based on nonlocal higher-derivative curvature invariants of the phase field, can be temperature-dependent, allows for a range of behaviors from complete coalescence to the preservation of distinct boundaries. Simulations show controlled bonding kinetics, demonstrating capabilities that are not available with existing methods for modeling interfaces that must remain distinct under given thermodynamic conditions."}

While eSPA ensembles yield state-of-the-art forecast skill, they are harder to interpret than individual eSPA models. We show how to compress the ensemble into a compact set of \"distilled\" models by aggregating the structure of only those ensemble members that make correct predictions. This process yields a single, diagnostically tractable model for each forecast lead time that preserves forecast performance while also enabling diagnostics that are impractical to implement on the full ensemble.\n  An analysis of the regime persistence of the distilled model \"superclusters\", as well as cross-lead clustering consistency, shows that the discretised system accurately captures the spatiotemporal dynamics of ENSO. By considering the effective dimension of the feature importance vectors, the complexity of the input space required for correct ENSO phase prediction is shown to peak when forecasts must cross the boreal spring predictability barrier. Spatial importance maps derived from the feature importance vectors are introduced to identify where predictive information resides in each field and are shown to include known physical precursors at certain lead times. Case studies of key events are also presented, showing how fields reconstructed from distilled model centroids trace the evolution from extratropical and inter-basin precursors to the mature ENSO state. Overall, the distillation framework enables a rigorous investigation of long-range ENSO predictability that complements real-time data-driven operational forecasts."}

One of the key requirements for observing viscous electron flow in an electronic channel is a large momentum-relaxation path, a process primarily limited by electron-impurity/phonon scattering in graphene. Over the past decade, multiple complex device geometries have been successfully employed to suppress momentum-relaxing scattering mechanisms; however, experimental observations have been found to be sensitive to the device fabrication process and architecture, raising questions about the signature of electron hydrodynamics itself. Here, we present a study on multiple ultra-clean graphene field-effect transistors (FETs) in a simple, rectangular four-terminal device architecture. Using electrical transport measurements, we have characterised the pristine quality of the graphene FETs and examined the variation of electrical resistance in the doped regime as a function of carrier density and temperature. Our results reveal strong device-dependent variability even in the most simple architecture that we attribute to competing momentum-conserving and momentum-relaxing scattering mechanisms, as well as coupling to contacts. Further, we have proposed a phenomenological method for analysing the results, which yields transport parameters in accordance with recent experiments. This simple experimental strategy and analysis can serve as an efficient tool for extracting the viscous electronic contribution in state-of-the-art high-mobility graphene FETs."}

For that purpose, we analyze the Raman force on the shear phonons of a frustrated magnetoelectric bilayer spin system. The bilayer is a stacked triangular magnet, motivated by recently emerging type-II van der Waals multiferroic transition metal dihalides and comprises a spin system which allows for incommensurate spiral order. The magnon excitations are treated by linear spin wave theory. In the spiral state, a finite electric polarization is obtained from the spin-current interaction which induces a coupling of the magnons to the electric field. Scattering of the bilayer shear phonons from the magnons is derived from a magnetoelastic energy. In this scenario, a mixed three-point response function for the Raman force is evaluated.

While existing strengthening models typically treat depinning as defect-assisted cutting or dislocation bowing, the combined strain-rate and dislocation-line-length dependence of cross-kink stability and effective obstacle spacing remains insufficiently resolved at the atomistic scale. Here, we combine conventional molecular dynamics and strain-boost hyperdynamics to investigate screw-dislocation glide in pure Nb and Mo, dilute Nb-Mo alloys, and equiatomic NbMo at 300 K over strain rates from 10^3 to 10^7 s^-1 and dislocation line lengths from 15 to 50 nm. We first demonstrate that low-strain-rate simulations require sufficiently long dislocation lines to capture consistent cross-kink behavior and strength-determining pinning events. Using the 50~nm configurations, we show that cross-kinks form not only in concentrated alloys but also in pure BCC metals, with their stability governed by the relative rates of kink nucleation and migration on primary and cross-slip planes, which differ between Nb- and Mo-rich systems due to distinct core structures and non-Schmid responses. At high strain rates, depinning proceeds predominantly via vacancy-interstitial cluster formation. In contrast, at low strain rates and long line lengths, alternative pathways emerge, including lateral cross-kink migration, three-dimensional forward--backward cross-slip, and prismatic loop formation. The effective obstacle spacing controlling the critical resolved shear stress therefore emerges from coupled thermodynamic roughening and kinetic evolution. These findings highlight the intrinsically rate-, length-, and chemistry-dependent nature of screw-dislocation strengthening in BCC alloys."}

We address this gap with a benchmark that computes energies and forces directly from predicted Hamiltonians. Within this framework, we propose QHFlow2, a state-of-the-art Hamiltonian model with an SO(2)-equivariant backbone and a two-stage edge update. QHFlow2 achieves $40\\%$ lower Hamiltonian error than the previous best model with fewer parameters. Under direct evaluation on MD17/rMD17, it is the first Hamiltonian model to reach NequIP-level force accuracy while achieving up to $20\\times$ lower energy MAE.

The bilayer is a stacked triangular magnet, motivated by recently emerging type-II van der Waals multiferroic transition metal dihalides and comprises a spin system which allows for incommensurate spiral order. The magnon excitations are treated by linear spin wave theory. In the spiral state, a finite electric polarization is obtained from the spin-current interaction which induces a coupling of the magnons to the electric field. Scattering of the bilayer shear phonons from the magnons is derived from a magnetoelastic energy. In this scenario, a mixed three-point response function for the Raman force is evaluated.

Field-cooling from above the Néel temperature is a reliable yet slow re-pinning method in exchange-biased systems.

Recent work has shown that femtosecond laser pulses enable field-free reversal of exchange bias in tailored multilayer stacks. Contrary to field-cooling, our experiments with ultrafast excitation reach hitherto unexplored regimes in the exchange bias setting process. Here, we unravel these observations by considering both ultrafast magnetization dynamics on the femto- to picosecond timescale and slow heat-driven dynamics on millisecond timescales and upwards. We develop a microscopic framework of exchange bias setting in a polycrystalline antiferromagnetic thin film like IrMn that provides a complete description of the observations in our present experiments and those found in literature. We expand the use of our model by identifying material platforms and stack designs that lead to optimized performance, aiding further development of optically reprogrammable devices."}

Lattice-dynamics analysis reveals that the crystal symmetry is lower than previously proposed and is consistent with a $P1$ space group at low temperature. Several infrared-active phonon modes exhibit pronounced anomalies at both the structural transition temperature $T_S \\approx 125$--$130$~K and the Néel temperature $T_N \\approx 95$~K. First-principles calculations show that the modes affected at $T_S$ predominantly involve displacements that modulate magnetic exchange pathways. Neutron scattering demonstrates that below $T_N$ the magnetic order is three-dimensional, long-ranged, and static. Between $T_N$ and $T_S$, the system displays three-dimensional short-range dynamic magnetic correlations, which disappear above $T_S$. The structural transition thus coincides with the onset of magnetic fluctuations rather than with static magnetic order. Our results indicate that short-range, dynamical magnetic correlations are sufficient to drive a static structural instability, providing a magnetically driven mechanism reminiscent of the iron-pnictide 122 family, yet realized here in a quasi-one-dimensional Mott system. These findings highlight the central role of magnetoelastic coupling in iron-based superconductors beyond the itinerant regime."}

Here, the focused electron beam of a scanning transmission electron microscope is used to demonstrate atomically precise sculpting of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) bilayers, achieving nanoribbons as narrow as 6 Å with atomically smooth edges. The key to this precision lies in understanding how the underlying atomic structure, particularly in twisted bilayer systems, influences the milling process. High-angle annular dark-field imaging combined with multislice simulations reveals distinct intensity signatures that allow identification of different stacking arrangements within moiré patterns. Mathematical analysis of moiré lattices provides a predictive framework for determining optimal cutting directions, with cuts along armchair directions yielding superior edge quality compared to zigzag orientations. Surprisingly, a sequential milling approach, where a small electron beam subscan area is translated during the process, produces significantly better results than parallel milling of the entire target region. To understand these differences we implemented a stochastic milling model that reveals that sequential milling minimizes unwanted exposure to surrounding material through beam tail effects. These findings establish a framework for achieving atomic precision in electron beam sculpting of two-dimensional materials and provide fundamental insights applicable to the broader challenge of top-down nanofabrication."}

Existing deep learning models often treat crystallographic symmetry only as a soft heuristic or rely on space group and Wyckoff templates retrieved from known structures, which limits both physical fidelity and the ability to discover genuinely new material structures. In contrast to retrieval-based methods, our approach leverages large language models to encode chemical semantics and directly generate fine-grained Wyckoff patterns from composition, effectively circumventing the limitations inherent to database lookups. Crucially, we incorporate domain knowledge into the generative process through an efficient constrained-optimization search that rigorously enforces algebraic consistency between site multiplicities and atomic stoichiometry. By integrating this symmetry-consistent template into a diffusion backbone, our approach constrains the stochastic generative trajectory to a physically valid geometric manifold. This framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across stability, uniqueness, and novelty (SUN) benchmarks, alongside superior matching performance, thereby establishing a new paradigm for the rigorous exploration of targeted crystallographic space. This framework enables efficient expansion into previously uncharted materials space, eliminating reliance on existing databases or a priori structural knowledge."}

This formulation enables us to specify complex kinetic laws, and we use this to incorporate a physically-motivated geometric criterion to control interface merging. This criterion, based on nonlocal higher-derivative curvature invariants of the phase field, can be temperature-dependent, allows for a range of behaviors from complete coalescence to the preservation of distinct boundaries. Simulations show controlled bonding kinetics, demonstrating capabilities that are not available with existing methods for modeling interfaces that must remain distinct under given thermodynamic conditions."}

Yet, the exact functional is unknown, and computationally tractable approximations are therefore necessary for practical applications.

Using electrical transport measurements, we have characterised the pristine quality of the graphene FETs and examined the variation of electrical resistance in the doped regime as a function of carrier density and temperature. Our results reveal strong device-dependent variability even in the most simple architecture that we attribute to competing momentum-conserving and momentum-relaxing scattering mechanisms, as well as coupling to contacts.

In this work, we systematically investigate how core-hole approximations and charge compensation schemes affect transition energies, energy alignment, and chemical-shift reproducibility in PBC-DFT-based molecular XANES calculations. Using ethane as a model system, we show that the full core-hole (FCH) approach exhibits pronounced supercell-size dependence originating from interactions between background charge and charged molecules, with transition energies largely changed by leading-order finite-size terms. In contrast, the excited core-hole (XCH) method rapidly converges owing to its neutral final state. We further demonstrate that most finite-size effects in FCH can be removed by Makov-Payne corrections based on multipole expansion of the electrostatic energy of charged supercells under PBC. Furthermore, we propose a simple Fermi-level-based energy correction (EF/2) that provides comparable improvement using only a single supercell. Extending the analysis to an n-alkane series reveals that while intrinsic electronic-structure changes govern peak shifts for small molecules, systematic energy drifts persist in FCH for larger molecules, whereas XCH and FCH+EF/2 remain stable. Finally, for small molecules at the C and N K-edges, XCH and FCH+EF/2 accurately reproduce experimental chemical shifts, whereas uncorrected FCH fails. These results provide practical guidelines for reliable energy alignment and chemical-shift analysis in molecular XANES under PBC, supporting robust applications to molecular, adsorption, and interfacial systems."}

Consequently, a natural question is whether this effect can also be observed in more realistic models containing anharmonic nuclear potentials, and, if so, whether it has a measurable impact on observables such as the junction dissociation probability. In this work, we apply a mixed quantum-classical approach based on electronic friction and Langevin dynamics to various anharmonic two-mode systems. By performing Langevin simulations of the vibrational dynamics, we investigate the influence of anharmonicity on instabilities arising from nonconservative forces and the corresponding dissociation dynamics of the junction, as well as steady-state observables, such as the electronic current."}

While existing strengthening models typically treat depinning as defect-assisted cutting or dislocation bowing, the combined strain-rate and dislocation-line-length dependence of cross-kink stability and effective obstacle spacing remains insufficiently resolved at the atomistic scale. Here, we combine conventional molecular dynamics and strain-boost hyperdynamics to investigate screw-dislocation glide in pure Nb and Mo, dilute Nb-Mo alloys, and equiatomic NbMo at 300 K over strain rates from 10^3 to 10^7 s^-1 and dislocation line lengths from 15 to 50 nm. We first demonstrate that low-strain-rate simulations require sufficiently long dislocation lines to capture consistent cross-kink behavior and strength-determining pinning events. Using the 50~nm configurations, we show that cross-kinks form not only in concentrated alloys but also in pure BCC metals, with their stability governed by the relative rates of kink nucleation and migration on primary and cross-slip planes, which differ between Nb- and Mo-rich systems due to distinct core structures and non-Schmid responses. At high strain rates, depinning proceeds predominantly via vacancy-interstitial cluster formation. In contrast, at low strain rates and long line lengths, alternative pathways emerge, including lateral cross-kink migration, three-dimensional forward--backward cross-slip, and prismatic loop formation. The effective obstacle spacing controlling the critical resolved shear stress therefore emerges from coupled thermodynamic roughening and kinetic evolution. These findings highlight the intrinsically rate-, length-, and chemistry-dependent nature of screw-dislocation strengthening in BCC alloys."}

The optical and photoemission quantum efficiency (QE) spectra, along with longitudinal energy distribution curves (EDCs) of multialkali Na$_{2}$KSb(Cs,Sb) photocathodes were measured in the temperature range of 80--295 K. The thresholds of various band-to-band transition in Na$_{2}$KSb were observed in the optical and QE spectra of Na$_{2}$KSb(Cs,Sb) photocathodes. The evolution of EDC derivatives with varying photon energy reveals a fine structure related to the emission of two types of electrons: (i) ballistic electrons, which are excited from heavy hole, light hole and split-off valence bands, and (ii) photoelectrons, that are captured in the side valleys of Na$_{2}$KSb conduction band. The analysis of EDCs and QE spectra allowed us to determine the band structure parameters of Na$_{2}$KSb at $T = 80$ K, including the band gap $E_{\\text{g}} = 1.52 \\pm 0.02$ eV, spin-orbit splitting $Δ_{\\text{SO}} = 0.59 \\pm 0.04$ eV and the energy separations between $Γ$ and side valleys of the conduction band: $Δ_{Γ-\\text{X}1} = 0.41 \\pm 0.05$ eV and $Δ_{Γ-\\text{X}2} = 0.65 \\pm 0.05$ eV.

Here, the focused electron beam of a scanning transmission electron microscope is used to demonstrate atomically precise sculpting of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) bilayers, achieving nanoribbons as narrow as 6 Å with atomically smooth edges. The key to this precision lies in understanding how the underlying atomic structure, particularly in twisted bilayer systems, influences the milling process. High-angle annular dark-field imaging combined with multislice simulations reveals distinct intensity signatures that allow identification of different stacking arrangements within moiré patterns. Mathematical analysis of moiré lattices provides a predictive framework for determining optimal cutting directions, with cuts along armchair directions yielding superior edge quality compared to zigzag orientations. Surprisingly, a sequential milling approach, where a small electron beam subscan area is translated during the process, produces significantly better results than parallel milling of the entire target region. To understand these differences we implemented a stochastic milling model that reveals that sequential milling minimizes unwanted exposure to surrounding material through beam tail effects.

Using first-principles calculations on CsPbBr3, we demonstrate that Br-Br interactions induce rotational soft modes that decongest the phonon spectrum and enhance three- and four-phonon scattering, strongly suppressing particle-like thermal conductivity (kappa_p). Independently, static octahedral distortions further reduce kappa_p by amplifying anharmonicity while leaving wave-like conductivity (kappa_c) intact. Based on these mechanistic insights, we introduce a geometric distortion factor rho and perform a high-throughput screening that first selects materials with halogen-coordinated octahedral building blocks-ensuring the presence of rotational soft modes-and then identifies those with pronounced distortion. This strategy uncovers TaGaI8 with an ultralow kappa_L = 0.11 W/mK at room temperature.

Several infrared-active phonon modes exhibit pronounced anomalies at both the structural transition temperature $T_S \\approx 125$--$130$~K and the Néel temperature $T_N \\approx 95$~K.

Neutron scattering demonstrates that below $T_N$ the magnetic order is three-dimensional, long-ranged, and static. Between $T_N$ and $T_S$, the system displays three-dimensional short-range dynamic magnetic correlations, which disappear above $T_S$. The structural transition thus coincides with the onset of magnetic fluctuations rather than with static magnetic order. Our results indicate that short-range, dynamical magnetic correlations are sufficient to drive a static structural instability, providing a magnetically driven mechanism reminiscent of the iron-pnictide 122 family, yet realized here in a quasi-one-dimensional Mott system.

Existing deep learning models often treat crystallographic symmetry only as a soft heuristic or rely on space group and Wyckoff templates retrieved from known structures, which limits both physical fidelity and the ability to discover genuinely new material structures. In contrast to retrieval-based methods, our approach leverages large language models to encode chemical semantics and directly generate fine-grained Wyckoff patterns from composition, effectively circumventing the limitations inherent to database lookups. Crucially, we incorporate domain knowledge into the generative process through an efficient constrained-optimization search that rigorously enforces algebraic consistency between site multiplicities and atomic stoichiometry.

We combine density functional theory calculations with a Hubbard model Hamiltonian to compute the magnetic interactions, the bands, the intrinsic Anomalous Hall effect, and the collective spin excitations. We obtain very large intermolecular exchange couplings, in the range of 50 meV, which ensures room temperature stability. When the magnetization is off-plane, intrinsic spin orbit coupling in graphene opens up a topological gap that, despite being very small, leads to a quantized Hall conductance in the tens of mK range. Above 1 Kelvin, the system will behave like a half-metal with fully compensated magnetic moments, thereby combining two characteristics that make it ideal for spintronics applications."}

Recent work has shown that femtosecond laser pulses enable field-free reversal of exchange bias in tailored multilayer stacks. Contrary to field-cooling, our experiments with ultrafast excitation reach hitherto unexplored regimes in the exchange bias setting process. Here, we unravel these observations by considering both ultrafast magnetization dynamics on the femto- to picosecond timescale and slow heat-driven dynamics on millisecond timescales and upwards. We develop a microscopic framework of exchange bias setting in a polycrystalline antiferromagnetic thin film like IrMn that provides a complete description of the observations in our present experiments and those found in literature. We expand the use of our model by identifying material platforms and stack designs that lead to optimized performance, aiding further development of optically reprogrammable devices."}

While superconductivity has been induced in LaO up to 5.37 K in tensile epitaxy films, the intrinsic ground state of the bulk phase has remained controversial mostly due to synthetic challenges, with early reports suggesting a metallic nature. Here we report the high-pressure and high-temperature synthesis of pure bulk rock-salt LaO and unveil its intrinsic type-II superconductivity with a transition temperature (TC) of ~6 K at ambient pressure. The bulk TC is further enhanced to 6.9 K in La1-xYxO at x = 0.10, where Y doping leads to lattice contraction (chemical pressing) and a remarkable increase in electron carrier concentration. Strikingly, applying physical pressure further enhances the TC to a maximum of 12.7 K at 20 GPa, the highest TC in lanthanum monochalcogenides LaX (X = S, Se, Te, and O) to date. This pressure dependence is diametrically opposed to the behavior observed in films, and occurs despite a pressure-induced reduction in the density of states at EF - a trend that sharply contradicts the conventional phonon-mediated BCS mechanism. Our first-principles calculations reveal that compressive strain modifies the crystal field splitting to enhance La-5d/O-2p hybridization, fostering a three-dimensional multi-pocket Fermi surface favorable for spin/orbital fluctuation-mediated pairing.

Time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy offers a direct means to probe these light-dressed electronic states. In such photoemission experiments, dressing can also occur for quasi-free electrons outside the material, giving rise to Volkov states. In certain cases, strong surface screening reduces the penetration of the driving field into the solid, resulting in Volkov contributions that dominate over Floquet ones. In this work, we systematically investigate the influence of materials' dielectric properties on Floquet-Volkov dressing of semiconductors, focusing on bulk layered van der Waals materials GeS, SnS, and 2H-WSe$_2$. First, by combining a simple model based on Fresnel equations with an electron-scattering description of Volkov amplitudes, we use polarization-dependent Volkov sideband intensities to extract a lower bound for the real part of the materials' dielectric functions, which typically lie between the reported dielectric constants for monolayer and bulk crystals. We demonstrate that increasing the fluence of the pump laser enables the generation of high-order Volkov sidebands which exhibit clear signatures of nonlinear light-matter interactions. Finally, we show that for our experimental geometry, the quasi-transparent nature of semiconductors in below-band-gap driving regime allows the optical pump to propagate within the sample and undergo multiple total internal reflections, producing temporally delayed Volkov replicas in pump-probe measurements via dressing of photoelectrons by evanescent fields. These systematic studies uncover previously unexplored aspects of Floquet-Volkov dressing in solids, highlighting the role of dielectric screening of the driving field."}

One of the key requirements for observing viscous electron flow in an electronic channel is a large momentum-relaxation path, a process primarily limited by electron-impurity/phonon scattering in graphene. Over the past decade, multiple complex device geometries have been successfully employed to suppress momentum-relaxing scattering mechanisms; however, experimental observations have been found to be sensitive to the device fabrication process and architecture, raising questions about the signature of electron hydrodynamics itself. Here, we present a study on multiple ultra-clean graphene field-effect transistors (FETs) in a simple, rectangular four-terminal device architecture. Using electrical transport measurements, we have characterised the pristine quality of the graphene FETs and examined the variation of electrical resistance in the doped regime as a function of carrier density and temperature. Our results reveal strong device-dependent variability even in the most simple architecture that we attribute to competing momentum-conserving and momentum-relaxing scattering mechanisms, as well as coupling to contacts. Further, we have proposed a phenomenological method for analysing the results, which yields transport parameters in accordance with recent experiments. This simple experimental strategy and analysis can serve as an efficient tool for extracting the viscous electronic contribution in state-of-the-art high-mobility graphene FETs."}

In this work, we systematically investigate how core-hole approximations and charge compensation schemes affect transition energies, energy alignment, and chemical-shift reproducibility in PBC-DFT-based molecular XANES calculations. Using ethane as a model system, we show that the full core-hole (FCH) approach exhibits pronounced supercell-size dependence originating from interactions between background charge and charged molecules, with transition energies largely changed by leading-order finite-size terms. In contrast, the excited core-hole (XCH) method rapidly converges owing to its neutral final state. We further demonstrate that most finite-size effects in FCH can be removed by Makov-Payne corrections based on multipole expansion of the electrostatic energy of charged supercells under PBC. Furthermore, we propose a simple Fermi-level-based energy correction (EF/2) that provides comparable improvement using only a single supercell. Extending the analysis to an n-alkane series reveals that while intrinsic electronic-structure changes govern peak shifts for small molecules, systematic energy drifts persist in FCH for larger molecules, whereas XCH and FCH+EF/2 remain stable. Finally, for small molecules at the C and N K-edges, XCH and FCH+EF/2 accurately reproduce experimental chemical shifts, whereas uncorrected FCH fails. These results provide practical guidelines for reliable energy alignment and chemical-shift analysis in molecular XANES under PBC, supporting robust applications to molecular, adsorption, and interfacial systems."}

Such fields tilt the potential surface experienced by domain walls and thereby lower activation energies for their movement: escape from tilted potential wells is then realised by thermal excitation, allowing a \"creep\" process of pinning and depinning to develop. Borrowing ideas of domain wall resonance from the magnetic racetrack community, we show that ac fields, applied at the right frequency, can cause switching at much lower field magnitudes than dc ones (by factors of 4-5). Ferroelectric wall motion appears to be overdamped in the system studied (relaxor strontium barium niobate) and so the maximum in switching efficacy observed, at ~100 kHz, cannot be associated with resonant amplification, which needs an underdamped environment. Instead, in this high viscosity system, the frequency at which the maximum switching efficacy occurs seems to represent a compromise between the attempt frequency for wall depinning (which increases with frequency) and the extent to which energy is transferred to the wall within each field cycle (which decreases with frequency). Notwithstanding the absence of true resonance, the observation that ac excitation can dramatically reduce the bias levels needed for ferroelectric switching could still have significant ramifications for low energy memory technology."}

The optical and photoemission quantum efficiency (QE) spectra, along with longitudinal energy distribution curves (EDCs) of multialkali Na$_{2}$KSb(Cs,Sb) photocathodes were measured in the temperature range of 80--295 K. The thresholds of various band-to-band transition in Na$_{2}$KSb were observed in the optical and QE spectra of Na$_{2}$KSb(Cs,Sb) photocathodes. The evolution of EDC derivatives with varying photon energy reveals a fine structure related to the emission of two types of electrons: (i) ballistic electrons, which are excited from heavy hole, light hole and split-off valence bands, and (ii) photoelectrons, that are captured in the side valleys of Na$_{2}$KSb conduction band. The analysis of EDCs and QE spectra allowed us to determine the band structure parameters of Na$_{2}$KSb at $T = 80$ K, including the band gap $E_{\\text{g}} = 1.52 \\pm 0.02$ eV, spin-orbit splitting $Δ_{\\text{SO}} = 0.59 \\pm 0.04$ eV and the energy separations between $Γ$ and side valleys of the conduction band: $Δ_{Γ-\\text{X}1} = 0.41 \\pm 0.05$ eV and $Δ_{Γ-\\text{X}2} = 0.65 \\pm 0.05$ eV.

However, this phenomenon is poorly understood since observations of this coupling vary significantly across materials. In this context, hybrid organic-inorganic metal halide perovskites (HOIPs) that incorporate Mn2+ ions are a chemically and structurally tunable platform for exploring this phenomenon, since they exhibit magnetic ordering and photoluminescence (PL) emission. Here, we study two antiferromagnetic Mn-based HOIPs with different organic cations that result in distinct lattice stiffness, Mn2+-Mn2+ distance and octahedral distortion. Temperature-dependent PL excitation spectroscopy reveals changes in crystal field splitting energy and Racah parameters well above the Néel temperature (TN), indicating the emergence of Mn2+-Mn2+ magnetic interactions prior to reach long-range magnetic ordering. These variations align with the observed changes in temperature-PL evolution. The compound with a more rigid lattice shows stronger changes closer to TN, suggesting combined effects of magnetic polarons and spin-canting. In contrast, magnetic polaron-induced magnetic modifications prevail in the HOIP with a softer lattice. These results reveal the complexity of the magneto-optical coupling in Mn-based HOIPs and provide new insights into this field extensible to other 2D materials that exhibit this phenomenon with potential for advanced magneto-optical applications."}

Using first-principles calculations on CsPbBr3, we demonstrate that Br-Br interactions induce rotational soft modes that decongest the phonon spectrum and enhance three- and four-phonon scattering, strongly suppressing particle-like thermal conductivity (kappa_p). Independently, static octahedral distortions further reduce kappa_p by amplifying anharmonicity while leaving wave-like conductivity (kappa_c) intact. Based on these mechanistic insights, we introduce a geometric distortion factor rho and perform a high-throughput screening that first selects materials with halogen-coordinated octahedral building blocks-ensuring the presence of rotational soft modes-and then identifies those with pronounced distortion. This strategy uncovers TaGaI8 with an ultralow kappa_L = 0.11 W/mK at room temperature. This work establishes halogen-halogen-enabled rotational soft modes and octahedral distortions as transferable design principles for octahedra-containing halides, spanning both extended frameworks and molecular-cluster motifs, for discovering ultralow-kappa_L materials."}

STM imaging across the surface of macroscopic bulk CsPbBr3 films reveals large flat terraces characterized by a specific type of surface reconstruction, consisting of parallel rows of U-shaped atomic nanostructures. These structures are spaced by 12 angstroms and exhibit an internal periodicity of 5.1 angstroms. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reproduce the experimental observations and reveal a competition between different orthorhombic CsPbBr3(110) surface reconstructions: a Cs-rich structure, identified as the most energetically stable, and three alternative PbBr rich reconstructions, which are slightly higher in energy yet remain consistent with the STM data. Additional analyses that explicitly account for the mica substrate exclude the cubic CsPbBr3 phase and other orthorhombic surface orientations, while showing that variations in the mica surface termination do not alter the preferred CsPbBr3(110) reconstruction. This combined approach thereby confirms our assignment and resolves previous STM interpretations of CsPbBr3."}

Existing deep learning models often treat crystallographic symmetry only as a soft heuristic or rely on space group and Wyckoff templates retrieved from known structures, which limits both physical fidelity and the ability to discover genuinely new material structures. In contrast to retrieval-based methods, our approach leverages large language models to encode chemical semantics and directly generate fine-grained Wyckoff patterns from composition, effectively circumventing the limitations inherent to database lookups. Crucially, we incorporate domain knowledge into the generative process through an efficient constrained-optimization search that rigorously enforces algebraic consistency between site multiplicities and atomic stoichiometry. By integrating this symmetry-consistent template into a diffusion backbone, our approach constrains the stochastic generative trajectory to a physically valid geometric manifold. This framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across stability, uniqueness, and novelty (SUN) benchmarks, alongside superior matching performance, thereby establishing a new paradigm for the rigorous exploration of targeted crystallographic space.

Efficiently identifying low-energy configurations within this space remains a central challenge for first-principles-based materials discovery, particularly when the available reference data are limited. Here, we introduce a data-efficient and physically interpretable machine-learning framework based on a fragmented, layer-resolved descriptor that explicitly decomposes nanoparticles into surface, intermediate, and core environments using a topology-driven definition. This representation preserves a compact and fixed feature dimensionality while retaining spatial resolution, enabling controlled emphasis on different regions of the nanoparticle through physically motivated weighting schemes. Coupled with gradient-boosted decision tree models and a ranking-based learning strategy, the proposed framework enables accurate identification of the most stable nanoparticle configurations using only a few hundred density functional theory reference calculations. Ranking performance metrics demonstrate near-saturation of correlation, high top-k recall, and rapidly vanishing regret at moderate training-set sizes, highlighting the strong data efficiency of the approach. Beyond predictive performance, layer-weighting and SHAP-based interpretability analyses reveal how surface segregation, coordination topology, and local chemical disorder contribute differently to stability across spatial regions of the nanoparticle.

So far, this mechanism has only been investigated in models with harmonic nuclear potentials. Consequently, a natural question is whether this effect can also be observed in more realistic models containing anharmonic nuclear potentials, and, if so, whether it has a measurable impact on observables such as the junction dissociation probability. In this work, we apply a mixed quantum-classical approach based on electronic friction and Langevin dynamics to various anharmonic two-mode systems. By performing Langevin simulations of the vibrational dynamics, we investigate the influence of anharmonicity on instabilities arising from nonconservative forces and the corresponding dissociation dynamics of the junction, as well as steady-state observables, such as the electronic current."}

Here, we present a first-principles approach to construct Newns-Anderson Hamiltonians by applying projection operator diabatisation to Hamiltonian matrices obtained from Kohn-Sham density functional theory calculations. We demonstrate this method for chemisorbed hydrogen on three fcc metal(111) surfaces: Al, Cu, and Pt. To validate the electronic coupling between adsorbed hydrogen and the metal surface, we compute the projected density of states, electronic tunnelling lifetimes, and vibrational lifetimes from the constructed Newns-Anderson Hamiltonians and find good agreement with reference calculations. Analysis of the chemisorption function reveals that the wideband limit approximation is valid for H/Al(111) but has limited applicability for H/Cu(111) and H/Pt(111)."}

Time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy offers a direct means to probe these light-dressed electronic states. In such photoemission experiments, dressing can also occur for quasi-free electrons outside the material, giving rise to Volkov states. In certain cases, strong surface screening reduces the penetration of the driving field into the solid, resulting in Volkov contributions that dominate over Floquet ones. In this work, we systematically investigate the influence of materials' dielectric properties on Floquet-Volkov dressing of semiconductors, focusing on bulk layered van der Waals materials GeS, SnS, and 2H-WSe$_2$. First, by combining a simple model based on Fresnel equations with an electron-scattering description of Volkov amplitudes, we use polarization-dependent Volkov sideband intensities to extract a lower bound for the real part of the materials' dielectric functions, which typically lie between the reported dielectric constants for monolayer and bulk crystals. We demonstrate that increasing the fluence of the pump laser enables the generation of high-order Volkov sidebands which exhibit clear signatures of nonlinear light-matter interactions. Finally, we show that for our experimental geometry, the quasi-transparent nature of semiconductors in below-band-gap driving regime allows the optical pump to propagate within the sample and undergo multiple total internal reflections, producing temporally delayed Volkov replicas in pump-probe measurements via dressing of photoelectrons by evanescent fields. These systematic studies uncover previously unexplored aspects of Floquet-Volkov dressing in solids, highlighting the role of dielectric screening of the driving field."}

One of the key requirements for observing viscous electron flow in an electronic channel is a large momentum-relaxation path, a process primarily limited by electron-impurity/phonon scattering in graphene. Over the past decade, multiple complex device geometries have been successfully employed to suppress momentum-relaxing scattering mechanisms; however, experimental observations have been found to be sensitive to the device fabrication process and architecture, raising questions about the signature of electron hydrodynamics itself. Here, we present a study on multiple ultra-clean graphene field-effect transistors (FETs) in a simple, rectangular four-terminal device architecture. Using electrical transport measurements, we have characterised the pristine quality of the graphene FETs and examined the variation of electrical resistance in the doped regime as a function of carrier density and temperature. Our results reveal strong device-dependent variability even in the most simple architecture that we attribute to competing momentum-conserving and momentum-relaxing scattering mechanisms, as well as coupling to contacts. Further, we have proposed a phenomenological method for analysing the results, which yields transport parameters in accordance with recent experiments. This simple experimental strategy and analysis can serve as an efficient tool for extracting the viscous electronic contribution in state-of-the-art high-mobility graphene FETs."}

Unlike spin precession, the dipole relaxes toward a finite value away from the interface. We further quantify interfacial orbital memory loss and demonstrate that orbital absorption produces a sizable mechanical torque obtained from the orbital continuity equation."}

We address this gap with a benchmark that computes energies and forces directly from predicted Hamiltonians. Within this framework, we propose QHFlow2, a state-of-the-art Hamiltonian model with an SO(2)-equivariant backbone and a two-stage edge update. QHFlow2 achieves $40\\%$ lower Hamiltonian error than the previous best model with fewer parameters. Under direct evaluation on MD17/rMD17, it is the first Hamiltonian model to reach NequIP-level force accuracy while achieving up to $20\\times$ lower energy MAE. On QH9, QHFlow2 reduces energy error by up to $20\\times$ compared to MACE. Finally, we demonstrate that QHFlow2 exhibits consistent scaling behavior with respect to model capacity and data, and that improvements in Hamiltonian accuracy effectively translate into more accurate energy and force computations."}

While much commercial equipment allows for XY-resolved characterization at room temperature, very few sample holders have been made available to investigate structural, chemical, and functional properties at high temperatures in controlled atmospheres. In the present work, we present a furnace that enables the study of 100 mm wafers as a function of temperature.

We analyze electrical and electronic thermal conductivities versus carrier density and temperature, including deviations from the Wiedemann-Franz law. Our results reveal that finite-range disorder nontrivially modifies charge and heat currents, especially at low energies where perturbative methods fail.

Here, atomically dispersed Pd (Pd1) and Pd clusters are loaded onto CdS, serving as oxidation and reduction sites, respectively, for methanol dehydrogenation. The Pd1 substitutes Cd2+, forming hole-trapping states for methanol oxidation and assisting the dispersion of photo-deposited Pd clusters. Therefore, methanol dehydrogenation on CdS with supported Pd1 and Pd clusters exhibits the highest turnover frequency of 1.14 s-1 based on Pd content, and affords H2 and HCHO with a similar apparent quantum yield of 87 +/- 1% at 452 nm under optimized reaction conditions.

We combine density functional theory calculations with a Hubbard model Hamiltonian to compute the magnetic interactions, the bands, the intrinsic Anomalous Hall effect, and the collective spin excitations. We obtain very large intermolecular exchange couplings, in the range of 50 meV, which ensures room temperature stability. When the magnetization is off-plane, intrinsic spin orbit coupling in graphene opens up a topological gap that, despite being very small, leads to a quantized Hall conductance in the tens of mK range. Above 1 Kelvin, the system will behave like a half-metal with fully compensated magnetic moments, thereby combining two characteristics that make it ideal for spintronics applications."}

Such fields tilt the potential surface experienced by domain walls and thereby lower activation energies for their movement: escape from tilted potential wells is then realised by thermal excitation, allowing a \"creep\" process of pinning and depinning to develop. Borrowing ideas of domain wall resonance from the magnetic racetrack community, we show that ac fields, applied at the right frequency, can cause switching at much lower field magnitudes than dc ones (by factors of 4-5). Ferroelectric wall motion appears to be overdamped in the system studied (relaxor strontium barium niobate) and so the maximum in switching efficacy observed, at ~100 kHz, cannot be associated with resonant amplification, which needs an underdamped environment. Instead, in this high viscosity system, the frequency at which the maximum switching efficacy occurs seems to represent a compromise between the attempt frequency for wall depinning (which increases with frequency) and the extent to which energy is transferred to the wall within each field cycle (which decreases with frequency). Notwithstanding the absence of true resonance, the observation that ac excitation can dramatically reduce the bias levels needed for ferroelectric switching could still have significant ramifications for low energy memory technology."}

Oxygen flow rates ranging from 5.0 to 20 sccm corresponded to O content changes from 57.7 to 69.6 at.% and resulted in large differences in dielectric behavior, from films with no measurable dielectric strength to a dielectric strength of 231 V$μ$m$^{-1}$, respectively. Ab initio calculations were employed to explain the large property changes, and we show that a decrease in the dielectric strength can be linked to the formation of metal-metal bonds in the material, when the O content is less than what would correspond to a stoichiometric Ta$_2$O$_5$ and Al$_2$O$_3$ mixture. The electronic states corresponding to the metal--metal bonds are located in the band gap close to the top of the valence band, leading to an effective band gap reduction, which is directly supported by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy valence band measurements and by a broad optical absorption in the visible region."}

However, this phenomenon is poorly understood since observations of this coupling vary significantly across materials. In this context, hybrid organic-inorganic metal halide perovskites (HOIPs) that incorporate Mn2+ ions are a chemically and structurally tunable platform for exploring this phenomenon, since they exhibit magnetic ordering and photoluminescence (PL) emission. Here, we study two antiferromagnetic Mn-based HOIPs with different organic cations that result in distinct lattice stiffness, Mn2+-Mn2+ distance and octahedral distortion. Temperature-dependent PL excitation spectroscopy reveals changes in crystal field splitting energy and Racah parameters well above the Néel temperature (TN), indicating the emergence of Mn2+-Mn2+ magnetic interactions prior to reach long-range magnetic ordering. These variations align with the observed changes in temperature-PL evolution. The compound with a more rigid lattice shows stronger changes closer to TN, suggesting combined effects of magnetic polarons and spin-canting. In contrast, magnetic polaron-induced magnetic modifications prevail in the HOIP with a softer lattice. These results reveal the complexity of the magneto-optical coupling in Mn-based HOIPs and provide new insights into this field extensible to other 2D materials that exhibit this phenomenon with potential for advanced magneto-optical applications."}

They can also be used as transformations to construct dualities between such models, both invertible (including unitary) and non-invertible (including discrete gauging). We analyse how the local Yang--Baxter integrable structures are modified under such dualities. We see that the $\\check{R}$-matrix, that appears in the baxterization approach to integrability, transforms in a simple manner. We further show for a broad class of MPOs that the usual Yang--Baxter $R$-matrix satisfies a modified algebra, previously identified in the unitary case, that gives a local integrable structure underlying the commuting transfer matrices of the dual model. We illustrate these results with two case studies, analysing an invertible unitary MPO and a non-invertible MPO both applied to the canonical XXZ spin chain. The former is the cluster entangler, arising in the study of symmetry-protected topological phases, while the latter is the Kramers--Wannier duality. We show several results for MPOs with exact MPO inverses that are of independent interest."}

Using a continuum Dirac model, we go beyond the Born approximation by computing the exact scattering matrix for individual impurities. This captures the full nonperturbative physics of smooth disorder. From the exact scattering data, we evaluate transport coefficients by solving the Boltzmann equation with energy-resolved phase shifts. We analyze electrical and electronic thermal conductivities versus carrier density and temperature, including deviations from the Wiedemann-Franz law. Our results reveal that finite-range disorder nontrivially modifies charge and heat currents, especially at low energies where perturbative methods fail. These findings provide a more accurate transport characterization for disordered Dirac materials and clarify how smooth disorder governs energy flow in graphene."}

While numerous experimental techniques have been used to study Li plating in laboratory cells, investigations of commercial high-energy cells often rely on electrochemical methods. Here we present and classify various methods for detecting Li plating on a commercial A123 pouch cell. In a round robin study across multiple battery research laboratories, Li-plated graphitic electrode material was analyzed using electrochemical, microscopic, and spectroscopic methods capable of detecting metallic Li deposits. After cell opening, their overall distribution on the anode surface was examined using a flatbed scanner to ensure comparability of the samples. Optical and electron microscopy provided detailed surface and, in combination with a focused ion beam, subsurface structure and morphology. Spectroscopic methods confirmed the presence and onset of plated Li with varying sensitivity. Moreover, spectroscopic and imaging techniques were combined correlatively where possible. Availability and measurement duration of each technique was compared. Optical methods are fast and easy to use; thus, they are recommended for most samples, with spectroscopic confirmation reserved for reference samples. This multimodal study demonstrates a range of methods that can be used alone or in combination to qualitatively or quantitatively detect Li-plating."}

The analyzed system is half-metallic with a ferrimagnetic order, presenting a zero net total magnetic moment per unit cell. We combine density functional theory calculations with a Hubbard model Hamiltonian to compute the magnetic interactions, the bands, the intrinsic Anomalous Hall effect, and the collective spin excitations. We obtain very large intermolecular exchange couplings, in the range of 50 meV, which ensures room temperature stability. When the magnetization is off-plane, intrinsic spin orbit coupling in graphene opens up a topological gap that, despite being very small, leads to a quantized Hall conductance in the tens of mK range. Above 1 Kelvin, the system will behave like a half-metal with fully compensated magnetic moments, thereby combining two characteristics that make it ideal for spintronics applications."}

Efficiently identifying low-energy configurations within this space remains a central challenge for first-principles-based materials discovery, particularly when the available reference data are limited. Here, we introduce a data-efficient and physically interpretable machine-learning framework based on a fragmented, layer-resolved descriptor that explicitly decomposes nanoparticles into surface, intermediate, and core environments using a topology-driven definition. This representation preserves a compact and fixed feature dimensionality while retaining spatial resolution, enabling controlled emphasis on different regions of the nanoparticle through physically motivated weighting schemes. Coupled with gradient-boosted decision tree models and a ranking-based learning strategy, the proposed framework enables accurate identification of the most stable nanoparticle configurations using only a few hundred density functional theory reference calculations. Ranking performance metrics demonstrate near-saturation of correlation, high top-k recall, and rapidly vanishing regret at moderate training-set sizes, highlighting the strong data efficiency of the approach. Beyond predictive performance, layer-weighting and SHAP-based interpretability analyses reveal how surface segregation, coordination topology, and local chemical disorder contribute differently to stability across spatial regions of the nanoparticle. These insights provide a transparent physical interpretation of the learned models and establish a natural pathway toward active learning-driven exploration of complex nanoparticle configurational spaces."}

As a result, we can readily simulate systems with electron numbers $N > 1000$ on both disk and sphere geometries. We apply this method to investigating the topological shift obtained from the edge dipole moment, computed from the density of the wave function on the disk. We also numerically computed the non-Abelian braiding matrices for different braiding schemes of the Moore-Read quasiholes on the sphere. Results with much better quality compared with previous works have been achieved. With the thermodynamic limit results obtained at ease, we also discuss the future usage of our method to clarify the questions on the instability of fractional quantum Hall states in an ideal Chern band setting or under quantum decoherence."}

Y addition was found to significantly retard the microstructural evolution, primarily due to its solute drag effect arising from Y segregation at grain boundaries. The relative intensity of solute drag effects from different alloying elements in Mg alloys was further assessed from both thermodynamic and kinetic perspectives, considering their grain boundary segregation tendencies and diffusivities. Additionally, static recrystallization in Mg-Y alloys was observed to proceed via a two-stage behavior characterized with two distinct JMAK exponents, indicating the heterogeneous nucleation of recrystallized grains. Abnormal grain growth (AGG) behavior was observed in these Mg-Y alloys. Overall, this study highlights the critical role of Y segregation at grain boundaries in controlling recrystallization and grain growth kinetics in Mg-Y alloys. This provides new insights into the design of thermally stable Mg alloys with refined microstructures."}

However, despite their physical grounding, existing Hamiltonian models are evaluated mainly by reconstruction metrics, leaving it unclear how well they perform as energy-force predictors. We address this gap with a benchmark that computes energies and forces directly from predicted Hamiltonians. Within this framework, we propose QHFlow2, a state-of-the-art Hamiltonian model with an SO(2)-equivariant backbone and a two-stage edge update. QHFlow2 achieves $40\\%$ lower Hamiltonian error than the previous best model with fewer parameters. Under direct evaluation on MD17/rMD17, it is the first Hamiltonian model to reach NequIP-level force accuracy while achieving up to $20\\times$ lower energy MAE. On QH9, QHFlow2 reduces energy error by up to $20\\times$ compared to MACE. Finally, we demonstrate that QHFlow2 exhibits consistent scaling behavior with respect to model capacity and data, and that improvements in Hamiltonian accuracy effectively translate into more accurate energy and force computations."}
