The selection of a balanced active space is a critical step in
multi-reference quantum chemistry calculations, particularly for systems with
strong electron correlation. Likewise, active space selection is a key to
unlock the potential of contemporary quantum computing in quantum chemistry.
Albeit recent progress, there remains a lack of a unified, robust, and fully
automated framework for active space selection that performs reliably across a
wide range of molecular systems.
  In this work, we present a novel approach inspired by both the AVAS (Atomic
Valence Active Space) and AutoCAS methods. Our method unifies orbital entropy
analysis with atomic orbital projections to guide the construction of
chemically and physically meaningful active spaces. This integrated scheme
enables a more consistent and flexible selection of active orbitals while
retaining automation and scalability. We validate our approach on a set of
molecular systems relevant to photodynamic therapy, in particular a set of
Ru(II)-complexes, selected to span increasing levels of electron correlation
and structural complexity. These molecules serve as challenging test cases due
to the presence of strong static correlation and the need for highly accurate
electronic structure descriptions. Our results demonstrate that the method can
reliably identify compact, chemically intuitive active spaces that capture the
essential physics, making it suitable for both classical and quantum
computational frameworks.
  Furthermore, we have developed this approach in a package that is intuitive
to use for users and can be interfaced with both standard quantum chemistry and
quantum computing applications, making it accessible to a broad research
community.

Universal machine-learned potentials promise transferable accuracy across
compositional and vibrational degrees of freedom, yet their application to
biomolecular simulations remains underexplored. This work systematically
evaluates equivariant message-passing architectures trained on the SPICE-v2
dataset with and without explicit long-range dispersion and electrostatics. We
assess the impact of model size, training data composition, and electrostatic
treatment across in- and out-of-distribution benchmark datasets, as well as
molecular simulations of bulk liquid water, aqueous NaCl solutions, and
biomolecules, including alanine tripeptide, the mini-protein Trp-cage, and
Crambin. While larger models improve accuracy on benchmark datasets, this trend
does not consistently extend to properties obtained from simulations. Predicted
properties also depend on the composition of the training dataset. Long-range
electrostatics show no systematic impact across systems. However, for Trp-cage,
their inclusion yields increased conformational variability. Our results
suggest that imbalanced datasets and immature evaluation practices currently
challenge the applicability of universal machine-learned potentials to
biomolecular simulations.

We construct an interacting Wannier model for both AA-stacked and AB-stacked
twisted SnSe2, revealing a rich landscape of correlated quantum phases. For the
AA-stacked case, the system is effectively described by a three-orbital
triangular lattice model, where each orbital corresponds to a valley and
exhibits an approximate one-dimensional hopping structure due to a new
momentum-space non-symmorphic symmetry. By exploring the interacting phase
diagram using a combination of theoretical methods, including Hartree-Fock
mean-field theory and exact solutions of the spin model in certain limits, we
identify several exotic quantum phases. These include a dimerized phase with
finite residual entropy, valence bond solids, and quantum paramagnetism. In the
AB-stacked case, the system realizes an interacting kagome lattice model, where
the Wannier orbitals associated with the three valleys form three sublattices.
In the strong coupling regime, we use cluster mean-field methods to demonstrate
the emergence of a classical spin liquid phase due to the frustrated lattice
structure. The high tunability of the moir\'e system, which allows control over
both the filling and interaction strength (via twist angle), renders twisted
SnSe2 a versatile platform for realizing a wide range of exotic correlated
quantum phases.

Automatic differentiation (AD) enables powerful metasurface inverse design
but requires extensive theoretical and programming expertise. We present a
Model Context Protocol (MCP) assisted framework that allows researchers to
conduct inverse design with differentiable solvers through large language
models (LLMs). Since LLMs inherently lack knowledge of specialized solvers, our
proposed solution provides dynamic access to verified code templates and
comprehensive documentation through dedicated servers. The LLM autonomously
accesses these resources to generate complete inverse design codes without
prescribed coordination rules. Evaluation on the Huygens meta-atom design task
with the differentiable TorchRDIT solver shows that while both natural language
and structured prompting strategies achieve high success rates, structured
prompting significantly outperforms in design quality, workflow efficiency,
computational cost, and error reduction. The minimalist server design, using
only 5 APIs, demonstrates how MCP makes sophisticated computational tools
accessible to researchers without programming expertise, offering a
generalizable integration solution for other scientific tasks.

### Group theory method for extracting order parameters from scanning tunneling microscopy data

Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) is a powerful local probe of correlated
electronic states. Here we present a group theoretical framework for the
analysis of STM data, filtering STM images into components which provide a real
space mapping of the local symmetry properties of the underlying density of
states. Using this formalism, we show that certain kinds of symmetry breaking
are impossible to resolve in the first Brillouin zone, due to symmetry
restrictions we term ``Bragg peak extinctions'' in analogy with related ideas
in x-ray crystallography. We show extinct patterns of symmetry breaking can be
resolved using sub-unit cell structure, and develop methodological details for
the accurate extraction of this symmetry information. We illustrate our results
on synthetic STM data for $2\times 2$ charge density waves on the kagome
lattice, and on topographic data for kagome metal ScV$_6$Sn$_6$. Our results
provide a powerful method for extracting symmetry insights from STM data, and
provide constraints on when and how certain ground states are experimentally
observable.

### Sum-of-Gaussians tensor neural networks for high-dimensional Schrödinger equation

- **Categories**: physics.comp-ph, cs.NA, math.NA, 35Q40, 65D40, 65N25, 68W25, 68W40

We propose an accurate, efficient, and low-memory sum-of-Gaussians tensor
neural network (SOG-TNN) algorithm for solving the high-dimensional
Schr\"odinger equation. The SOG-TNN utilizes a low-rank tensor product
representation of the solution to overcome the curse of dimensionality
associated with high-dimensional integration. To handle the Coulomb
interaction, we introduce an SOG decomposition to approximate the interaction
kernel such that it is dimensionally separable, leading to a tensor
representation with rapid convergence. We further develop a range-splitting
scheme that partitions the Gaussian terms into short-, long-, and mid-range
components. They are treated with the asymptotic expansion, the low-rank
Chebyshev expansion, and the model reduction with singular-value decomposition,
respectively, significantly reducing the number of two-dimensional integrals in
computing electron-electron interactions. The SOG decomposition well resolves
the computational challenge due to the singularity of the Coulomb interaction,
leading to an efficient algorithm for the high-dimensional problem under the
TNN framework. Numerical results demonstrate the outstanding performance of the
new method, revealing that the SOG-TNN is a promising way for tackling large
and complex quantum systems.

### Spin and thermal current scaling at a $Y$-junction of XX spin chains
- **arXiv**: [2508.10267](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10267)  ·  [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.10267.pdf)
- **Title (EN)**: Spin and thermal current scaling at a $Y$-junction of XX spin chains
- **Authors**: Domenico Giuliano, Francesco Buccheri
- **Categories**: cond-mat.str-el

We study the boundary phase diagram and the low-temperature heat and
magnetization transport at a $Y$-junction of XX spin chains.
  Depending on the magnetization axis anisotropy between the magnetic exchange
interactions at the junction, the system exhibits two different strong-coupling
regimes at low energies/temperatures, similar to the overscreened (topological)
four- and to the two-channel Kondo fixed points. Using renormalization group
arguments combined with boundary conformal field theory methods, we show the
instability of the former under any XY-type anisotropy at the junction. We
analyze the low-temperature spin and the heat conductances. We find evidence of
spin fractionalization of the elementary excitations at the four-channel Kondo
fixed point by means of the magnetic Wiedemann-Franz law. We caution that the
instability under XY anisotropy may hinder the detection of the phenomenology
related to the four-channel Kondo effect, therefore requiring careful control
in experimental realizations.

### Virtual Sensing for Solder Layer Degradation and Temperature Monitoring in IGBT Modules

Monitoring the degradation state of Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT)
modules is essential for ensuring the reliability and longevity of power
electronic systems, especially in safety-critical and high-performance
applications. However, direct measurement of key degradation indicators - such
as junction temperature, solder fatigue or delamination - remains challenging
due to the physical inaccessibility of internal components and the harsh
environment. In this context, machine learning-based virtual sensing offers a
promising alternative by bridging the gap from feasible sensor placement to the
relevant but inaccessible locations. This paper explores the feasibility of
estimating the degradation state of solder layers, and the corresponding full
temperature maps based on a limited number of physical sensors. Based on
synthetic data of a specific degradation mode, we obtain a high accuracy in the
estimation of the degraded solder area (1.17% mean absolute error), and are
able to reproduce the surface temperature of the IGBT with a maximum relative
error of 4.56% (corresponding to an average relative error of 0.37%).

### Electronic localization on the structural inhomogeneities formed due to Bi and Te deficiency in the MBE grown films of AFM topological insulator MnBi2Te4: Evidence from spectroscopic ellipsometry and infrared studies

The intrinsic substitutional and antisite defects cause unintentional doping
and shift of the E_F position above the conduction band minimum in the AFM
topological insulator (TI) MnBi2Te4. This prevents measurements of the quantum
anomalous Hall effect (QAH) and investigation of the topological Dirac states.
In the present study, the Mn-Bi-Te films grown by the MBE technique onto
Si(111) substrates with decreasing Bi and Te contents and increasing Mn content
were investigated by 0.5-6.5 eV spectroscopic ellipsometry. In addition, the
0.004-0.9 eV infrared (IR) transmittance spectra were examined. An effective
medium model was used to reproduce the measured ellipsometric angles,
Psi(omega) and Delta(omega), of the Mn-Bi-Te films in terms of the constructed
model, including film thickness, surface roughness, and volume fractions of two
(MnTe and Bi2Te3) or three constituents, the latter being associated with the
structural inhomogeneities contribution. The results obtained for the
inhomogeneous Mn-Bi-Te films using the three-phase EMA model indicate that the
defect-associated optical response systematically shifts to higher photon
energies from ~1.95 to ~2.43 eV with decreasing Te and Bi contents and
increasing Mn content, pointing out that the electrons become more deeply
localized in the formed structural inhomogeneities. The obtained results
indicate that the structure of the non-stoichiometric Mn-Bi-Te films is not
continuous but represented by regions of nearly stoichiometric MnBi2Te4 phase,
which includes hollows or quantum anti-dots (QADs). The measured FIR
transmittance spectra for the non-stoichiometric Mn-Bi-Te films show
substantially reduced (or absent) contribution(s) from free charge carriers,
which supports the relevance of localization effects.

### Physics-Informed Deep Contrast Source Inversion: A Unified Framework for Inverse Scattering Problems

Inverse scattering problems are critical in electromagnetic imaging and
medical diagnostics but are challenged by their nonlinearity and diverse
measurement scenarios. This paper proposes a physics-informed deep contrast
source inversion framework (DeepCSI) for fast and accurate medium
reconstruction across various measurement conditions. Inspired by contrast
source inversion (CSI) and neural operator methods, a residual multilayer
perceptron (ResMLP) is employed to model current distributions in the region of
interest under different transmitter excitations, effectively linearizing the
nonlinear inverse scattering problem and significantly reducing the
computational cost of traditional full-waveform inversion. By modeling medium
parameters as learnable tensors and utilizing a hybrid loss function that
integrates state equation loss, data equation loss, and total variation
regularization, DeepCSI establishes a fully differentiable framework for joint
optimization of network parameters and medium properties. Compared with
conventional methods, DeepCSI offers advantages in terms of simplicity and
universal modeling capabilities for diverse measurement scenarios, including
phase-less and multi-frequency observation. Simulations and experiments
demonstrate that DeepCSI achieves high-precision, robust reconstruction under
full-data, phaseless data, and multifrequency conditions, outperforming
traditional CSI methods and providing an efficient and universal solution for
complex inverse scattering problems.

The rare earth intermetallic system \textit{R}Al\textit{X} (\textit{R} = rare
earth elements, \textit{X} = Si and Ge) is known to be a promising candidate of
magnetic Weyl semimetal. Due to the complex interactions between the rare earth
elements and surrounding atoms, as well as hybridization with itinerant
electrons, this family likely possesses highly intriguing and novel magnetic
structures and thus exhibits dynamic behaviors. We systematically probe
polycrystalline samples of \textit{R}AlSi (\textit{R} = La, Ce, Pr and Nd)
combining inelastic neutron scattering (INS), heat capacity and magnetic
susceptibility measurements. The INS measurements identify well-resolved
crystalline electric field (CEF) excitations at 19.2 and 24.9 meV in CeAlSi, at
5.4 meV in PrAlSi, and at 2.5 and 4.2 meV in NdAlSi. We analyzed the INS data
using the corresponding CEF models and determined the CEF parameters and ground
state wave functions of \textit{R}AlSi (\textit{R} = Ce, Pr and Nd). Our
results suggest strong single-ion anisotropy in their ground states:
$|\pm3/2\rangle$ (94.5\%) in CeAlSi, $|\pm3\rangle$ (99.2\%) in PrAlSi, and
$|\pm9/2\rangle$ (76.2\%) in NdAlSi. Notably, the weaker anisotropy and strong
exchange interactions in NdAlSi promote competing magnetic orders and CEF
splitting at low temperature, contrasting with the robust CEF levels in
magnetic states of CeAlSi and PrAlSi.

We investigate the magnetic behavior of the 6H-perovskite dimer lattice
Ba$_3$Zn$_{1-x}$Ca$_x$Ru$_2$O$_9$ using analytical theory, density functional
theory, inelastic neutron scattering, and modeling of historical magnetization
and neutron-scattering data. A dimer mean-field theory built upon classical
Luttinger-Tisza analysis generates a phase diagram revealing a transition from
a nonmagnetic singlet to a finite-moment ground state as interdimer couplings
increase. A (generalized) linear spin-wave theory captures multiplet mixing,
excitation gap closing, and fluctuation-induced moment suppression. Density
functional theory on select compounds and neutron spectroscopy on dilute
Ba$_3$Zn(Ru$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$)$_2$O$_9$ confirm the exchange hierarchy, enabling
quantification of previously published experiments within this framework. Our
results identify three mechanisms for magnetic moment suppression: quantum
fluctuations, ligand hybridization, and nonmagnetic-singlet/magnetic-multiplet
mixing.

### Concentration-Free Quantum Kernel Learning in the Rydberg Blockade

- **Categories**: cond-mat.str-el, quant-ph

Quantum kernel methods (QKMs) offer an appealing framework for machine
learning on near-term quantum computers. However, QKMs generically suffer from
exponential concentration, requiring an exponential number of measurements to
resolve the kernel values, with the exception of trivial (i.e., classically
simulable) kernels. Here we propose a QKM that is free of exponential
concentration, yet remains hard to simulate classically. Our QKM utilizes the
weak ergodicity-breaking many-body dynamics in the Rydberg blockade of
coherently driven neutral atom arrays. We demonstrate the fundamental
properties of our QKM by analytically solving an approximate toy model of its
underpinning quantum dynamics, as well as by extensive numerical simulations on
randomly generated datasets. We further show that the proposed kernel exhibits
effective learning on real data. The proposed QKM can be implemented in current
neutral atom quantum computers.

### Gauging the variational optimization of projected entangled-pair states

- **Authors**: Wei Tang, Laurens Vanderstraeten, Jutho Haegeman
- **Categories**: cond-mat.str-el, quant-ph

Projected entangled-pair states (PEPS) constitute a powerful variational
ansatz for capturing ground state physics of two-dimensional quantum systems.
However, accurately computing and minimizing the energy expectation value
remains challenging, in part because the impact of the gauge degrees of freedom
that are present in the tensor network representation is poorly understood. We
analyze the role of gauge transformations for the case of a U(1)-symmetric PEPS
with point group symmetry, thereby reducing the gauge degrees of freedom to a
single class. We show how gradient-based optimization strategies exploit the
gauge freedom, causing the tensor network contraction to become increasingly
inaccurate and to produce artificially low variational energies. Furthermore,
we develop a gauge-fixed optimization strategy that largely suppresses this
effect, resulting in a more robust optimization. Our study underscores the need
for gauge-aware optimization strategies to guarantee reliability of variational
PEPS in general settings.
