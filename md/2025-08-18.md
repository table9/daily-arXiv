- **TL;DR**: 通过Gutzwiller投影将非相互作用欧拉绝缘体构造为自旋相互作用欧拉模型，利用PEPS方法分析其拓扑性质和局域序。

Gutzwiller projections of non-interacting chiral topological phases are known
to give rise to fractional, topologically ordered chiral phases. Here, we carry
out a similar construction using two copies of non-interacting Euler insulators
to produce a class of spinful interacting Euler models. To that end, we take
advantage of the recently discovered exact representation of certain Euler
insulators by a projected entangled pair state (PEPS) of bond dimension $D =
2$. The Gutzwiller projection can be implemented within the tensor network
formalism, giving rise to a new PEPS of bond dimension $D = 4$. We, moreover,
apply very recent state-of-the-art tensor network tools to evaluate these
phases. In particular, we analyze its entanglement entropy scaling and find no
topological correction to the area law, indicating that the state is not
intrinsically topologically ordered. Its entanglement spectrum shows a clear
cusp at momentum zero, similar to non-interacting Euler insulators, and the
spectrum of the transfer operator indicates that the state is gapped, which
could imply non-intrinsic topological features. Finally, the static structure
factor displays Bragg peaks, indicating the simultaneous presence of local
order.

### Spontaneously Broken Non-Invertible Symmetries in Transverse-Field Ising Qudit Chains

- **TL;DR**: 论文探讨了非可逆对称性的自发对称性破缺，通过一维链模型展示了其与可逆对称性破缺的异同，并揭示了非可逆对称性破缺的独特性质。

\usepackage{iopams} Recent developments have revealed that symmetries need
not form a group, but instead can be non-invertible. Here we use analytical
arguments and numerical evidence to illuminate how spontaneous symmetry
breaking of a non-invertible symmetry is similar yet distinct from ordinary,
invertible, symmetry breaking. We consider one-dimensional chains of
group-valued qudits, whose local Hilbert space is spanned by elements of a
finite group $G$ (reducing to ordinary qubits when $G=\mathbb{Z}_2$). We
construct Ising-type transverse-field Hamiltonians with Rep($G$) symmetry whose
generators multiply according to the tensor product of irreducible
representations (irreps) of the group $G$. For non-Abelian $G$, the symmetry is
non-invertible. In the symmetry broken phase there is one ground state per
irrep on a closed chain. The symmetry breaking can be detected by local order
parameters but, unlike the invertible case, different ground states have
distinct entanglement patterns. We show that for each irrep of dimension
greater than one the corresponding ground state exhibits string order,
entanglement spectrum degeneracies, and has gapless edge modes on an open chain
-- features usually associated with symmetry-protected topological order.
Consequently, domain wall excitations behave as one-dimensional non-Abelian
anyons with non-trivial internal Hilbert spaces and fusion rules. Our work
identifies properties of non-invertible symmetry breaking that existing quantum
hardware can probe.

- **TL;DR**: 综述了通过扫描隧道显微镜研究kagome金属Co3Sn2S2的最新进展，包括表面识别方法、Berry曲率诱导的平带轨道磁性、Weyl拓扑边界态及自旋轨道耦合量子杂质态。

Topological quantum materials with kagome lattices have attracted intense
interest due to their unconventional electronic structures, which exhibit
nontrivial topology, anomalous magnetism, and electronic correlations. Among
these, Co3Sn2S2 stands out as a prototypical kagome metal, uniquely combining
intrinsic ferromagnetism with topologically nontrivial electronic states. This
perspective presents a systematic overview of recent advances in studying
kagome metal Co3Sn2S2 achieved through scanning tunneling microscopy. We begin
by introducing different methodologies for surface identification and propose
using designer layer-selective chemical markers for conclusive surface
identification. We then discuss the Berry curvature induced flat band orbital
magnetism and the associated unconventional Zeeman effect. Furthermore, we
explore boundary states arising from Weyl topology and analyze challenges in
detecting Fermi arcs via quasiparticle interference patterns and in uncovering
the topological aspect of the edge states. Finally, we review recent
observations of spin-orbit-coupled quantum impurity states through
spin-polarized tunneling spectroscopy, as well as their connection to Weyl
topology and flat band magnetism. We also provide in-depth analysis and
constructive comments on the limitations of the current research approach. This
review highlights the critical role of scanning tunneling microscopy in
unraveling the intricate interplay between topology, magnetism, and
correlations at the atomic scale, and the methodology discussed here can be
applied to study other topological quantum materials in general.

### Light Induced Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect in Cubic Rashba Spin-Orbit Coupled Systems
- **arXiv**: [2508.11228](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11228)  ·  [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.11228.pdf)
- **Title (EN)**: Light Induced Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect in Cubic Rashba Spin-Orbit Coupled Systems
- **Authors**: Debabrata Sinha
- **Categories**: cond-mat.str-el
- **TL;DR**: 研究了二维电子系统中立方Rashba自旋轨道耦合在圆偏振光驱动下的拓扑相变，发现光-物质相互作用诱导出非平庸的能带拓扑和量子反常霍尔响应。

We investigate topological phase transitions in a two-dimensional electron
system with cubic Rashba spin-orbit coupling driven by circularly polarized
light. Within the Floquet framework, we demonstrate that light-matter
interaction induces nontrivial band topology characterized by a quantized
anomalous Hall response, with Chern insulating phases of C = 0, 1, and 3. These
transitions are governed by gap closings at high-symmetry points in the
Brillouin zone, controlled by the intensity and energy of the incident light.
Introducing a weak linear Rashba term displaces Dirac points in momentum space
without modifying the topology, whereas a purely linear Rashba system remains
topologically trivial (C = 0). When both linear and cubic Rashba couplings are
finite, the linear term confines nonzero-Chern phases to narrow parameter
windows. In contrast, incorporating a linear Dresselhaus term into the cubic
Rashba system can trigger topological transitions even at small coupling
strengths. These results clarify the interplay between distinct spin-orbit
interactions in Floquet-engineered Chern insulators and offer experimentally
relevant pathways for achieving light-controlled topological phases.

- **Categories**: physics.chem-ph, cond-mat.mtrl-sci
- **TL;DR**: 本文提出了一种元分析模型，用于动态研究和比较不同输入场景下的氢运输链，并评估成本方法和运输燃料类型的影响。

As a result of the wide span of uncertainties and input variables considered
in recent peer-reviewed studies on hydrogen supply chains, consensus and
generalized insight are hard to derive. This work presents a meta-analysis
model, building upon a growing database of literature cost estimations and
enabling dynamic investigation and comparison of hydrogen transportation chains
under varying input scenarios. Also built into the framework is the evaluation
of the impact of costing methodology and shipping fuel type. A convenient
online interface allows to leverage increasing amounts of underlying cost data
and assists users in gaining insight into generalized cost dynamics attributes.
The method and toolbox are demonstrated via in-depth analysis of compressed
hydrogen (GH2), liquefied hydrogen (LH2), dibenzyltoluene (LOHC) and ammonia as
hydrogen carriers. Confined hydrogen clathrate hydrates are used as an example
to demonstrate how one can deal with lower-TRL candidate technologies.

### Novel discretization method to calculate g-functions of vertical geothermal boreholes with improved accuracy and efficiency

- **TL;DR**: 本文提出了一种新的离散化方法，用于高效且准确地计算地热钻孔的g函数，解决了现有SFLS模型在计算效率和精度上的不足。

The calculation of g-functions is essential for the design and simulation of
geothermal boreholes. However, existing methods, such as the stacked finite
line source (SFLS) model, face challenges regarding computational efficiency
and accuracy, particularly with fine-grained discretization. This paper
introduces a novel discretization method to address these limitations. We
reformulate the g-function calculation under the uniform borehole wall
temperature boundary condition as the solution to spatio-temporal integral
equations. The SFLS model is identified as a special case using stepwise
approximation of the heat extraction rate. Our proposed method employs the
Gauss-Legendre quadrature to approximate the spatial integrals with a weighted
sum of function values at strategically chosen points. This transforms the
time-consuming segment-to-segment integral calculations in SFLS model into
simpler and analytical point-to-point response factors. Furthermore, we
identify that the governing integral equations are of the Fredholm first kind,
leading to ill-conditioned linear systems that can cause g-function to diverge
at high discretization orders. To address this, a regularization technique is
implemented to ensure stable and convergent solutions. Numerical tests
demonstrate that the proposed method is significantly more efficient, achieving
comparable or improved accuracy at speeds 20 to 200 times faster than the SFLS
model with optimized nonuniform discretization schemes.

### Theory of Spiral Magnetism in Weyl semimetal SmAlSi

- **TL;DR**: 研究了SmAlSi中Weyl电子通过RKKY机制介导的磁性相互作用，发现费米面嵌套不足以解释实验观察到的磁性调制，需结合d电子的反铁磁交换作用。

Recent neutron scattering and thermodynamic measurements suggest that Weyl
electrons in the emergent Weyl semimetal SmAlSi mediate unconventional magnetic
interactions and induce spiral magnetic order. In this work, we investigate the
nature of these interactions by modelling long-range $f-f$ exchange mediated by
itinerant $d$ electrons via the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) mechanism,
employing a material-specific tight-binding Hamiltonian obtained from
first-principles calculations. The magnetic susceptibility is derived from the
spin-spin correlation function based on the random phase approximation. Our
results demonstrate that Fermi-surface nesting alone cannot account for the
experimentally observed magnetic modulation at the wave vector (1/3, 1/3, 0);
however, incorporating appropriate antiferromagnetic exchange interactions
among the $d$ electrons yields the correct propagation vector. The spin-texture
analysis reveals a configuration that is close to a cycloidal spin structure,
preserving combined glide and time-reversal symmetry, and reflecting an
intricate competition between inter- and intra-sublattice interactions in
SmAlSi.

### Dynamical measurement of saturation vapor pressures below and above room temperature

- **TL;DR**: 论文提出了一种动态方法，用于在室温附近扩展温度范围内测定低挥发性液体的饱和蒸气压和蒸发焓，并应用于四种参考物质。

We report on the implementation of a dynamical method for the determination
-- in an extended temperature range around room temperature -- of the
saturation vapor pressure and enthalpy of vaporization of low-volatility liquid
substances. The method relies on isolating a \textit{precooled} substance in a
heated chamber under static vacuum conditions and monitoring the chamber
pressure as the sample slowly thermalizes to the chamber temperature. We apply
the method to four reference substances -- diethyl phthalate, 1-decanol,
1-heptanol, and 1-hexanol -- and provide accurate data for their saturation
vapor pressure and enthalpy of vaporization in the range from $-10$ to
$35^\circ$C.

### An efficient and robust high-order compact ALE gas-kinetic scheme for unstructured meshes

- **Categories**: physics.comp-ph
- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种高效且鲁棒的高阶紧凑ALE气体动力学方案，用于可压缩移动网格和移动边界问题，显著提高了计算效率。

For the arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) calculations, the geometric
information needs to be calculated at each time step due to the movement of
mesh. To achieve the high-order spatial accuracy, a large number of matrix
inversions are needed, which affect the efficiency of computation dramatically.
In this paper, an efficient and robust high-order compact ALE gas-kinetic
scheme is developed for the compressible moving grids and moving boundary
problems. The memory-reduction reconstruction is used to construct a quadratic
polynomial on the target cell, where both structured and unstructured meshes
can be used. Taking derivatives of the candidate polynomial, the quadratic
terms can be obtained by the least square method using the average gradient
values of the cell itself and its adjacent cells. Moving the quadratic terms to
right-hand side of the constrains for cell averaged value, the linear terms of
the polynomial can be determined by the least square method as well. The
gradient compression factor is adopted to suppress the spurious oscillations
near discontinuities. Combined with the two-stage fourth-order time
discretization, a high-order compact gas-kinetic scheme is developed for ALE
computation. In the process of mesh movement, the inversions of lower order
matrix are needed for the least square method, which makes a 7x speedup and
improves the efficiency greatly. In the computation, the grid velocity can be
given by the mesh adaptation method and the cell centered Lagrangian nodal
solver. Numerical examples are presented to evaluate the accuracy, efficiency,
robustness and the preservation of geometric conservation law of the current
scheme.

### Fermi-liquid-like phase driven by next-nearest-neighbor couplings in a lightly doped kagome-lattice $t$-$J$ model

- **TL;DR**: 研究了掺杂Kagome晶格Mott绝缘体的量子相图，发现随着电子跃迁和自旋相互作用的增加，会出现类似费米液体的新相。

Due to the interplay between charge fluctuation and geometry frustration, the
doped kagome-lattice Mott insulator is a fascinating platform to realize exotic
quantum states. Through the state-of-the-art density matrix renormalization
group calculation, we explore the quantum phases of the lightly doped
kagome-lattice $t$-$J$ model in the presence of the next-nearest-neighbor
electron hopping $t_2$ and spin interaction $J_2$. On the $L_y = 3$ cylinder
($L_y$ is the number of unit cells along the circumference direction), we
establish a quantum phase diagram with tuning $t_2 &gt; 0$ and $J_2 &gt; 0$, showing
an emergent Fermi-liquid-like phase driven by increased $t_2$ and $J_2$, which
sits at the neighbor of the previously identified charge density wave (CDW)
phase. Compared with the CDW phase, the charge order is significantly
suppressed in the Fermi-liquid-like phase, and most correlation functions are
greatly enhanced with power-law decay. In particular, we find the absence of
hole pairing and a strong three-sublattice magnetic correlation. On the wider
$L_y = 4$ cylinder, this Fermi-liquid-like phase persists at low doping levels,
strongly suggesting that this state might be stable in the two-dimensional
kagome system.

### Unphysical Solutions in Coupled-Cluster-Based Random Phase Approximation and How to Avoid Them

- **TL;DR**: 本文探讨了drCCD-RPA方法中的多解问题，提出了验证解的标准和改进的预处理方法，并展示了其在小间隙系统中的有效性。

The direct ring coupled-cluster doubles (drCCD)-based random phase
approximation (RPA) has provided an attractive framework for the development
and application of RPA-related methods. However, a potential unphysical
solution issue recently reported by Rekkedal and co-workers (J. Chem. Phys.
139, 081101, 2013) has raised significant concerns regarding the general
applicability of coupled-cluster-based RPA, particularly in small-gap systems
where RPA is anticipated to outperform commonly employed second-order
perturbation theory. In this work, we elucidate the underlying origin of the
multi-solution issue in drCCD and develop both a practical criterion for
validating drCCD solutions and improved preconditioners based on level shifting
and regularized MP2 methods for stabilizing the iterative solution of the drCCD
equation. We demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of our approach
through representative systems -- including molecules with stretched bonds,
large conjugated systems, and metallic clusters -- where standard drCCD
iteration encounters convergence difficulties. Furthermore, we extend our
approach to various recently developed reduced-scaling drCCD-based RPA methods,
thereby establishing a foundation for their stable application to large-scale
problems. The extension of our approach to RPA with exchange, quasiparticle
RPA, and particle-particle RPA is also discussed.

### DPI-SPR: A Differentiable Physical Inversion for Shadow Profile Reconstruction Framework in Forward Scatter Radar

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种基于可学习参数的端到端成像方法DPI-SPR，通过可微分前向散射模型和物理约束，在低信噪比条件下实现高精度目标轮廓重建。

Forward scatter radar (FSR) has emerged as an effective imaging modality for
target detection, utilizing forward scattering (FS) signals to reconstruct
two-dimensional shadow profile images of objects. However, real-world FS
signals are inevitably corrupted by noise. Due to the ill-posed nature of
electromagnetic inversion and its high sensitivity to noise, existing imaging
methods often suffer from degraded performance or even complete failure under
low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. To address this challenge, we
propose DPI-SPR (Differentiable Physical Inversion for Shadow Profile
Reconstruction), an end-to-end imaging paradigm built upon the Secondary
Wave-Source Response Field (SWRF). The core concept of this paradigm is to
reformulate the imaging problem as an optimization problem of continuous and
learnable SWRF parameters. To this end, we develop a fully Differentiable
Forward Scattering model (DFSM). Leveraging this model, the proposed inversion
framework integrates a robust logarithmic loss with physics-based
regularization constraints, enabling accurate gradient propagation from
observation errors to the SWRF parameters associated with the shadow profile.
Extensive simulation experiments have been conducted to verify the
effectiveness and robustness of the inversion proposed framework. The results
show that our method achieves high-precision profile reconstruction directly
from limited and noisy reference signals, even at an SNR as low as 8dB, setting
a new benchmark for robust imaging in FSR scenarios.

### Quantum Quench Dynamics in an Exactly Solvable Two-Dimensional Non-Fermi Liquid System

Understanding the behavior of non-Fermi liquids (NFLs) is an important topic
in condensed matter physics. Here we introduce an exactly solvable
multi-orbital model based on iron oxypnictides and the Hatsugai-Kohmoto model,
and provide exact investigations of the 2D NFLs nonequilibrium physics present
in this model. Our results reveal fundamental departures from Fermi liquids and
prior NFLs in the well-know SYK model: anomalous short-time scaling $-\tau^2
\ln \tau$, $O(\tau) \sim \tau^2$; long-time scaling $ \tau^{-1}, \tau^{-1/2},
\ln \tau / \tau$; a strange critical behavior in the steady-state phase
diagram. Our asymptotic results and dynamical critical behavior offer new
insights into the orbital-related dynamical physics of 2D NFLs.
