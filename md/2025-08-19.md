Andreev bound states are superpositions of electrons and holes in a metal
that form by coherent reflection from a superconductor. When the length of the
superconductor is comparable to the superconducting coherence length, Andreev
bound states at opposite edges hybridize by quasiparticle tunneling. In a
periodic array, these hybridized bound states form a band at energies below the
superconducting gap. In this paper, we derive a theoretical framework for the
transport properties of these Andreev crystals. We demonstrate that at high
interface transparency and constant phase bias between neighboring
superconductors, these bands are {\it directional}: one band consists only of
right -- while the other only of left-moving electronic states. This property
enables the application of this device as a flux- and bias-voltage tunable
filter that permits signal transmission in only one direction.

We report a gate-tunable Josephson diode effect in hybrid nanowire junctions
consisting of a spin-orbit-coupled semiconductor core coated with epitaxial
ferromagnetic insulator and superconductor shells. The wires display a
hysteretic superconducting window as a function of axial magnetic field. In the
superconducting regime, the devices exhibit nonreciprocal supercurrent
transport, with the diode efficiency showing a strong dependence on back-gate
voltage. The effect persists in a remanent magnetization state following a
controlled demagnetization procedure, establishing zero-field operation. These
findings demonstrate a voltage-controlled Josephson diode in a single junction
and suggest a route toward probing intrinsically broken inversion and
time-reversal symmetries in hybrid materials.

### High-root topological edge-state bands

- **TL;DR**: 通过复杂带分析研究一维高根拓扑绝缘体，发现边缘状态带是均匀系统杂质带的切片，并提出了不需对角化实空间哈密顿量的边缘状态求解方法

This paper presents a complex band analysis of one-dimensional (1D) square
and high-root topological insulators (HRTIs). We show that edge-state bands of
HRTIs are sliced sections of impurity bands of a uniform tight-binding chain. A
simplified topological characterization of HRTIs with generalized boundary
conditions is carried out based on the existence of edge-state bands in the
infinite HRTI and the restrictions imposed by the boundary conditions. Edge
states in finite or semi-infinite 1D HRTIs are shown to be a subset of
evanescent states of the infinite system and mapped onto impurity states of the
uniform chain with effective energy-dependent edge potentials. The latter
result allows the determination of the edge state levels without needing the
diagonalization of real space or bulk Hamiltonians.

### Diode Effect for Skyrmions Interacting with Linear Protrusion Defects

- **TL;DR**: 该论文研究了周期性不对称通道中集体相互作用的斯格明子的流动特性，发现了强烈的二极管效应和不对称的湮灭率，并分析了马格努斯力对运动的影响。

We simulate collectively interacting skyrmions in a channel with periodic
asymmetry, and find a strong diode effect for the skyrmion flow. There is also
an asymmetry in the skyrmion annihilation rate for currents applied along the
hard or easy substrate asymmetry direction, with a higher annihilation rate for
hard direction currents. We map out the diode efficiency as a function of
magnetic field and substrate asymmetry angle. We also show that the Magnus
force impacts the diode motion and annihilation rate asymmetry by forcing
skyrmions into corners of the protrusion geometry.

- **TL;DR**: 本文研究了铁基超导体LiFeAs中非弹性隧穿对准粒子干涉(QPI)的影响，发现了QPI图谱中的复制特征，这些特征源于与自旋涨落的相互作用。

Quasi-particle interference (QPI) is a powerful tool to characterize the
symmetry of the superconducting order parameter in unconventional
superconductors, by mapping the spatial dependence of elastic tunneling of
electrons between the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope and a sample.
Here, we consider the influence of inelastic tunneling on quasi-particle
interference, exemplarily for the iron-based superconductor LiFeAs. We clearly
observe replica features in both experimental QPI maps and the dispersion
extracted from QPI, which from comparison with theoretical model calculations
can be attributed to inelastic tunneling. Analysis of the QPI dispersion shows
that the inelastic mode that gives rise to these replica features exhibits a
resonance between 8 and 10 meV. Comparison of the energy scale of the resonance
energy estimated from QPI with inelastic neutron scattering indicates that the
replica features arise from interaction with spin fluctuations.

### Hyperparameter Optimization in the Estimation of PDE and Delay-PDE models from data

- **TL;DR**: 一种改进的偏微分方程和延迟偏微分方程估计方法，利用贝叶斯优化和贝叶斯信息准则自动寻找适合的超参数，通过结合时间积分提高稳健性和预测能力。

We propose an improved method for estimating partial differential equations
and delay partial differential equations from data, using Bayesian optimization
and the Bayesian information criterion to automatically find suitable
hyperparameters for the method itself or for the equations (such as a
time-delay). We show that combining time integration into an established model
estimation method increases robustness and yields predictive models. Allowing
hyperparameters to be optimized as part of the model estimation results in a
wider modelling scope. We demonstrate the method's performance on a number of
synthetic benchmark problems of different complexity, representing different
classes of physical behaviour. This includes the Allen-Cahn and Cahn-Hilliard
models, as well as different reaction-diffusion systems without and with
time-delay.

### Mn4Al11: A Half-Semimetal Candidate with Anomalous Electronic Behaviors

- **TL;DR**: Mn4Al11是一种新型半半金属候选材料，具有极低载流子浓度和68K附近的磁性相变，表现出非典型金属行为和温度依赖的载流子特性

Half-semimetals, characterized by their spin-polarized electronic states,
hold significant promise for spintronic applications but remain scarce due to
stringent electronic and magnetic criteria. Through a combination of transport
measurements and optical spectroscopy, we investigated the intermetallic
compound Mn4Al11, which features an exceptionally low carrier concentration and
undergoes a magnetic phase transition near 68 K. Transport measurements reveal
anomalies that deviate from typical metallic behavior at low temperatures.
Optical spectroscopy indicates a small, nearly frequency-independent optical
conductivity in the far-infrared region, with spectral weight decreasing as the
temperature drops from 300 K to 50 K. These behaviors suggest a
temperaturedependent carrier density and significant scattering of charge
carriers. Combining experimental findings with calculated electronic band
structures, we propose that Mn4Al11 is a novel half-semimetal candidate
exhibiting a ferrimagnetic ground state.

### Electro-thermal Co-design of High-power Vertical \b{eta}-Ga2O3 Schottky Diodes with High-permittivity Dielectric Field-plate

- **TL;DR**: 本文通过电热协同设计，在垂直β-Ga2O3肖特基势垒二极管中采用BaTiO3/AlN复合场板结构，显著改善了热管理和高场管理性能。

This work presents electrothermal co-design of vertical \b{eta}-Ga2O3
Schottky barrier diodes (SBDs) to enhance both heat dissipation and high field
management in high-power applications. Here, we demonstrate device-level
thermal management tailored for two vertical \b{eta}-Ga2O3 SBD structures that
employed different edge termination techniques, such as field-plate and deep
etch with sidewall field-plate, where the field-plate was formed with
high-permittivity dielectric (BaTiO3). The localized thermal hot spots were
detected at the Schottky contact edges near BaTiO3 dielectric based
field-plate. However, a substantial reduction of the thermal hotspots was
observed by forming the field-plate with BaTiO3 and thermally-conductive AlN
insulator, where the AlN can effectively decrease Joule heating at interface
and the high permittivity of BaTiO3 contributes to high field reduction. The
deep etch and sidewall field-plate SBD structure further reduced accumulated
heat and electric field near the critical anode edge by removing lateral
depletion regions. We also analyzed thermal transport at
dielectric/\b{eta}-Ga2O3 interfaces using Landauer approach that revealed
significantly higher thermal boundary conductance (TBC) enabled by AlN compared
to BaTiO3, attesting to the superior heat dissipation ability by BaTiO3/AlN
field-plate than the BaTiO3-only configuration. Experimental investigation with
vertical metal/AlN/\b{eta}-Ga2O3 diodes also extracted a high breakdown field
(~11 MV/cm) of AlN, significantly exceeding the material breakdown field of
\b{eta}-Ga2O3. This indicates that AlN can be an excellent choice for
field-plate dielectric in vertical \b{eta}-Ga2O3 SBDs to provide both enhanced
high field sustainability and improved heat dissipation in high-power
applications.

### Scaling Behaviors in Active Model B+ via the Functional Renormalization Group

- **TL;DR**: 使用功能重整化群(FRG)方法研究Active Model B+的标度行为，推导了d维空间中所有耦合的β函数，确定了参数空间中闭合的子模型，发现了双临界固定点，并指出FRG方法的全局流与微扰方法有显著差异。

We study the scaling behaviors of the Active Model B+ using the functional
renormalization group (FRG) approach, based on the nonequilibrium effective
action formulated via the Martin-Siggia-Rose path-integral formalism. We derive
the $\beta$ functions for all couplings of the system in generic $d$
dimensions, revealing regulator independence in various contributions to the RG
flow at specific values for $d$. After identifying specific regions of the
parameter space that define submodels closed under RG transformations, we
determine all fixed points of potential physical relevance. We confirm the
existence of a bicritical fixed point, which was conjectured within the
perturbative momentum-shell RG method for being responsible for the transition
from bulk phase separation to microphase separation in active systems. We argue
that, within the FRG approach, global flows significantly differ from those
obtained in its perturbative counterpart.

### Efficient Optimization of Low-Rank Antisymmetric Product of Geminals Wavefunction Using the Direct Givens Rotation Method

- **TL;DR**: 通过Givens旋转矩阵重构正交边部分，实现了低秩APG方法的分析变分优化，显著提高计算效率和减少计算时间

In our previous study, we proposed the low-rank antisymmetric product of
geminals (APG) method, which reconstructs the wavefunction by extracting only
the important eigenvalues from the APG wave function. However, its practical
application was limited by the high computational cost from an orbital
optimization process, making higher-rank calculations difficult. In this work,
we reformulate the orbital part of the wavefunction using Givens rotation
matrices, enabling an analytical treatment of the variational optimization. By
combining the low-rank APG with the direct Givens rotation (DGR) method, we
achieved a significant improvement in optimization efficiency. We applied the
developed method to small molecular systems and confirmed that it provides high
accuracy, while also significantly reducing the computational time compared to
conventional methods.

### Quantized nonlinear kink movement through topological boundary state instabilities

- **TL;DR**: 非线性二元链模型中的金格运输现象，通过线性边界模的不稳定性驱动金格运动，虽但类似线性Thouless泵送但无法用传统拓扑指标描述

Thouless pumping is a paradigmatic example of topologically protected,
directed transport in linear systems. Recent extensions to nonlinear pumps
often overlook the need to reassess the conventional framework of linear
topology. In this work, we study a nonlinear dimer-chain model that exhibits
quantized transport of kinks under a periodic modulation of a pumping
parameter. Crucially, linear excitations in the system map to a Rice-Mele model
and display topological boundary modes localized at these kinks. Using methods
from nonlinear dynamics, we show that instabilities in these boundary modes are
the driving mechanism behind the observed kink motion. While the transport
resembles that of a linear Thouless pump, it cannot be fully captured by
conventional topological indices. Instead, the behavior is more akin to a
topological ratchet: robust, directional, and reproducible, yet fundamentally
nonlinear. Furthermore, by introducing multiple pumping parameters, we
demonstrate fine control over multiple kink trajectories, as well as soliton
motion, suggesting applications in information transport. Our results unify
concepts from linear topology and nonlinear dynamics to establish a framework
for quantized transport in nonlinear media.

### Non-Hermitian Chiral Superfluids with a Complex Interaction

- **TL;DR**: 非负象温度下的非负象酒酱元模型中，耗散导致重入超流相边界和耗散激发超流相，并使边界模和负数拓扑学结构在特定几何中具有稳健性。

Recently, the influence of dissipation on a quantum system has attracted much
attention, particularly on how the non-Hermitian terms modify the energy
spectrum, band topology, and phase transition point. Motivated by the recent
investigation of non-Hermitian $s$-wave superfluidity, we study the
non-Hermitian chiral $p+ip$ superfluid (SF) with a complex-valued interaction,
originating from inelastic scattering between fermions. We reformulate the
non-Hermitian mean-field theory for chiral SFs and derive the gap equation in
the path integral approach. By numerically solving the gap equation, we obtain
the phase diagram of the non-Hermitian $p+ip$ SF, characterized by the
reentrant SF transition and dissipation-induced SF phase, as a result of the
evolution of the exceptional lines. The method can be extended to higher
partial-wave chiral SFs, such as $d+id$ and $f+if$-wave SFs. We further
consider such a chiral $p+ip$ SF on a square lattice, to investigate the
influence of dissipation on topology. We find that the non-Hermitian skin
effect is absent in the specific cylinder geometry, in which the topology
associated with the edge modes and Chern number is robust to dissipation.
Besides, we find that the energies at the robust point nodes and line nodes are
pure real. We further verify the conditions of zero winding number in (quasi-)
one-dimensional systems, and prove an associated ``no-go'' theorem, which is
hopefully applied to explore the geometry dependent skin effect.

### Rapid Variable Resolution Particle Initialization for Complex Geometries

- **TL;DR**: 一种基于SPH的快速粒子初始化方法，能够同时处理流体和固体区域，支持任意几何形状，并以较低计算成本获得高质量的几何粒子分布。

The accuracy of meshless methods like Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH)
is highly dependent on the quality of the particle distribution. Existing
particle initialization techniques often struggle to simultaneously achieve
adaptive resolution, handle intricate boundaries, and efficiently generate
well-packed distributions inside and outside a boundary. This work presents a
fast and robust particle initialization method that achieves these goals using
standard SPH building blocks. Our approach enables simultaneous initialization
of fluid and solid regions, supports arbitrary geometries, and achieves
high-quality, quasi-uniform particle arrangements without complex procedures
like surface bonding. Extensive results in both 2D and 3D demonstrate that the
obtained particle distributions exhibit good boundary conformity, low spatial
disorder, and minimal density variation, all with significantly reduced
computational cost compared to existing approaches. This work paves the way for
automated particle initialization to accurately model flow in and around bodies
with meshless methods, particularly with SPH.

- **TL;DR**: 研究通过蒙特卡罗模拟分析了积分异向性磁体LiHo_xEr_{1-x}F_4中非对角线碳极相互作用对磁性质的影响，解释了实验观察到的倾销温度T_c快速压制现象

We theoretically investigate the influence of off-diagonal dipolar
interactions in the mixed-anisotropy magnet $LiHo_{x}Er_{1-x}F_4$. Motivated by
experimental observations showing an unexpectedly rapid suppression of the
ferromagnetic transition temperature $T_c$ upon substitution of Ho by Er ions,
we use Monte Carlo simulations incorporating off-diagonal dipolar terms to
elucidate the underlying physical mechanism. Our results reveal that, unlike in
the diluted magnet $LiHo_{x}Y_{1-x}F_4$, where dilution weakens the effect of
these interactions, substitution by planar Er ions amplifies it. This leads to
a pronounced reduction of $T_c$, closely matching experimental data, thereby
resolving discrepancies with mean-field predictions. The findings underscore
the essential role of off-diagonal dipolar interactions in determining the
magnetic properties of mixed-anisotropy dipolar systems.

### Comprehensive Structural Characterization of Charged Polymers Involved in Moisture-Driven Direct Air Capture

- **TL;DR**: 研究通过多种结构分析技术对商业化碱性阳离子交换膜材料FAA-3和IRA 900进行结构形容，为温度驱动直接空气抓获CO2应用提供重要结构见解

The rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels has led to urgent calls
for effective carbon capture methods, with direct air capture (DAC) emerging as
a promising solution. This study focuses on the structural characterization of
commercially available alkaline anion-exchange membrane (AEM) polymers, Fumasep
FAA-3 and IRA 900, for use in low-energy, moisture-driven DAC applications. A
combination of X-ray diffraction, small and wide-angle X-ray scattering
(SAXS/WAXS), atomic force microscopy (AFM), focused ion beam-scanning electron
microscopy (FIB-SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were employed
to explore the structural features of these materials. X-ray scattering
analysis revealed molecular ordering and large-scale structural organization in
both materials, while humidity-induced changes highlighted the impact of
moisture on structural properties. AFM surface analysis further indicated the
presence of clustering, porosity, and swelling, which were corroborated by
FIB-SEM and TEM imaging. These structural insights offer a deeper understanding
of the behavior of AEM-DAC materials during CO2 capture and release,
emphasizing the role of moisture in these processes. This work lays the
foundation for the development of more energy-efficient DAC polymers, paving
the way for improved CO2 capture technologies.

### Strong overlap of deterministic and stochastic dynamics in a super-diffusive regime

We consider deterministic dynamics, known as the slicer map (SM), which
exhibits normal and anomalous diffusion by varying a single parameter. The
statistics of the position moments and the low-order position autocorrelation
function (PACF) of the SM closely overlap with those of a stochastic process
called the L\'evy-Lorentz gas (LLg), particularly in the normal and strongly
superdiffusive anomalous regimes. However, matching low-order statistics alone
cannot fully characterize the microscopic dynamics or distinguish underlying
process classes. To demonstrate how these dynamics strongly overlap, we focus
on the scaling of higher-order PACF, which provides a more detailed
characterization. In this paper, we analytically derive the generalized PACF of
the SM and explore its scaling forms under different temporal relationships.
Specifically, we derive several scalings of the 3-point PACF by analyzing
intriguing relations between three times. We compare these scalings with the
power-law tails of the numerically estimated 3-point PACF of the LLg. This
comparison provides a detailed description of the correlation scalings of the
SM, demonstrating that the SM shares key features with the LLg. Our findings
establish the SM as a deterministic analog of the LLg, enabling efficient
prediction of multi-time position correlations in superdiffusive systems.

Ab initio quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) is a stochastic approach for solving the
many-body Schr\"odinger equation without resorting to one-body approximations.
QMC algorithms are readily parallelizable via ensembles of $N_w$ walkers,
making them well suited to large-scale high-performance computing. Among the
QMC techniques, Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) is widely regarded as the most
reliable, since it provides the projection onto the ground state of a given
Hamiltonian under the fixed-node approximation. One practical realization of
DMC is the Lattice Regularized Diffusion Monte Carlo (LRDMC) method, which
discretizes the Hamiltonian within the Green's Function Monte Carlo framework.
DMC methods - including LRDMC - employ the so-called branching technique to
stabilize walker weights and populations. At the branching step, walkers must
be synchronized globally; any imbalance in per-walker workload can leave CPU or
GPU cores idle, thereby degrading overall hardware utilization. The
conventional LRDMC algorithm intrinsically suffers from such load imbalance,
which grows as $\log(N_w)$, rendering it less efficient on modern parallel
architectures. In this work, we present an LRDMC algorithm that inherently
addresses the load imbalance issue and achieves significantly improved
weak-scaling parallel efficiency. Using the binding energy calculation of a
water-methane complex as a test case, we demonstrated that the conventional and
load-balanced LRDMC algorithms yield consistent results. Furthermore, by
utilizing the Leonardo supercomputer equipped with NVIDIA A100 GPUs, we
demonstrated that the load-balanced LRDMC algorithm can maintain extremely high
parallel efficiency ($\sim$98\%) up to 512 GPUs (corresponding to $N_{\rm w}=
51200$), together with a speedup of $\times~1.24$ if directly compared with the
conventional LRDMC algorithm with the same number of walkers.

We investigate GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure membranes with a metasurface made
up of a grating of two-dimensional electron system (2DES) strips. Experiments
have revealed a strong plasma resonance in the transmission of the metasurface.
We have found that a collective effect from the superlattice, along with
lateral screening between the strips, leads to the emergence of a new plasmon
mode in the metasurface under study. Furthermore, we develop an analytical
approach that accurately describes the behavior of the discovered superlattice
plasmon mode, providing new insights into the fundamental physics of plasmonic
metasurface systems.

- **TL;DR**: Error

We investigate the Seebeck coefficient ($S$) in infinite-layer nickelate
films with different disorder levels. The disordered NdNiO$_{2}$ film exhibits
a flat $S/T$ curve, whereas cleaner samples display a logarithmic divergence
with decreasing temperature, followed by a pronounced ``hump'' near 25 K. These
distinct behaviors reveal a disorder-driven transition from
band-structure-dominated transport to quantum-critical-dominated transport.
Below the ``hump'' temperature, four-fold symmetry breaking is observed in the
in-plane angular magnetoresistance, indicating the presence of short-range
antiferromagnetic order in parent infinite-layer nickelate films. Furthermore,
the logarithmic divergence in $S/T$ is also observed in a clean superconducting
Sm$_{0.73}$Ca$_{0.05}$Eu$_{0.22}$NiO$_{2}$ film, where it coexists with
linear-in-temperature resistivity over the same temperature range. These
findings demonstrate the existence of quantum criticality over a wide doping
range in clean infinite-layer nickelate films, similar to cuprates, which
highlights the central role of antiferromagnetic spin correlations in their
superconducting pairing mechanisms.

A method for time-reversible numerical integration of the deterministic
Landau-Lifshitz Gilbert equation by means of a second order Suzuki-Trotter
decomposition is presented and tested against commonly used second order
predictor-corrector methods. We find the time-reversibility of the
Suzuki-Trotter integrator to be superior by several orders of magnitude while
the computational effort is similar. Calculations of trajectories backwards in
time are useful, for example, when evaluating dynamical corrections to
transition state theory.

Previous studies have shown that $\text{SU}(4)_1$ chiral spin liquid can
emerge in the SU($4$) Hubbard model on triangular lattice. A natural question
then arises: What is the phase upon doping? In this work, we show the
possibility that hole doping can give rise to an anyon superconductor and
propose that both spinons and holons form integer quantum Hall states with
opposite chiralities. Using topological field theory we demonstrate that the
phase is a topological charge-$4e$ superconductor with chiral central charge
$c_-=4$. We further identify the deconfined excitations and anyonic excitations
bound to the vortex. This unusual superconductor may be realized in moir'e
bilayer and detected through quantized thermal Hall effect and spin quantum
Hall effect.

Recent advances in two-dimensional materials have greatly expanded the family
of ferromagnetic materials. The well-known 2D ferromagnets, such as CrI$_3$,
Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$, and Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ monolayers, are characterized by
centrosymmetric crystal structures. In contrast, ferromagnetic ordering in 2D
noncentrosymmetric materials remains an underexplored area. Here we report a
Janus ferromagnet, Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Se$_3$Te$_3$ with inversion symmetry breaking,
through first-principles calculations. This monolayer can undergo a
ferromagnetic-antiferromagnetic transformation and a metal-semiconductor
transition under different strains. Additionally, the strength of
magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE) can be modulated by electric field
or strain. In particular, the magnetization easy axis can be altered from
in-plane to out-of-plane under strain. We find that Te$_3$ atoms play a key
role in determining the MAE, where contributions are primarily from $p_z / p_y$
and $p_x / p_y$ orbitals. This study of Janus ferromagnetic materials has
provided a promising platform for the research on the control of magnetism by
strain or electric field.

### Bridging Molecular Simulation and Process Modeling for Predictive Multicomponent Adsorption

Accurate and efficient prediction of multicomponent adsorption equilibria
across pressures, temperatures, and compositions remain a central challenge for
designing energy-efficient adsorption-based separation processes. Traditional
approaches, including model fitting and ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST),
often fail to balance accuracy, computational efficiency, and transferability
under process-relevant conditions. Here, we introduce a material-to-process
modeling framework that integrates macrostate probability distributions (MPDs)
from flat-histogram Monte Carlo simulations with rigorous cyclic process
optimization. MPDs directly capture the joint occupancy distributions of
adsorbates, producing reweightable landscape that enable high-fidelity mixture
adsorption equilibria without repeated simulations or model assumptions. We
show that coupling this statistical mechanical foundation with process modeling
delivers accurate and computationally efficient evaluations for binary and
ternary gas mixture separations. This integration establishes MPD-based
modeling as a generalized method for predictive multicomponent adsorption
equilibria, accelerating the discovery and design of adsorbent materials for
carbon capture and other separation challenges.

The fermion sign problem constitutes one of the most fundamental obstacles in
quantum many-body theory. Recently, it has been suggested to circumvent the
sign problem by carrying out path integral simulations with a fictitious
quantum statistics variable $\xi$, which allows for a smooth interpolation
between the bosonic and fermionic limits [\textit{J.~Chem.~Phys.}~\textbf{157},
094112 (2022)]. This $\xi$-extrapolation method has subsequently been applied
to a variety of systems and has facilitated the analysis of an x-ray scattering
measurement taken at the National Ignition Facility with unprecedented accuracy
[\textit{Nature Commun.}~\textbf{16}, 5103 (2025)]. Yet, it comes at the cost
of performing an additional $10-20$ simulations, which, in combination with the
required small error bars, can pose a serious practical limitation. Here, we
remove this bottleneck by presenting a new re-weighting estimator, which allows
the study of the full $\xi$-dependence from a single path integral Monte Carlo
(PIMC) simulation. This is demonstrated for various observables of the uniform
electron gas and also warm dense beryllium. We expect our work to be useful for
future PIMC simulations of Fermi systems, including ultracold atoms, electrons
in quantum dots, and warm dense quantum plasmas.

### Atom-surface interaction induced by quenched monopolar charge disorder

- **TL;DR**: 研究电荷渊序对原子能级偏移的影响，发现电荷渊序导致能级向下偏移，产生吽引力，在远离离下可超过Casimir-Polder力

We study the modification to the energy level shifts of an atom induced by
the quenched monopolar charge disorder inside the bulk of neighboring
dielectric slabs as well as their surfaces. By assuming that the charge
disorder follows Gaussian statistics with a zero mean, we find that the
disorder generally results in a downward shift of the energy levels, which
corresponds to an attractive force that can compete with and overcome the
nonresonant Casimir-Polder force for sufficiently large atom-surface
separations $z_0$. For an atom near a single semi-infinite slab with bulk
(surface) charge disorder, the shift decays as $z_0^{-1}$ ($z_0^{-2}$). For
both surface and bulk disorder, the shift is proportional to the variance of
the charge disorder density. In addition, we investigate the behavior of the
charge disorder-induced energy level shift for an atom confined to a vacuum gap
between two coplanar and semi-infinite slabs of the same dielectric material,
finding that the position of net zero disorder-induced force occurs closer to
the surface of the slab with the smaller charge disorder variance.

### Transport evidence of current-induced nematic Dirac valleys in a parity-time-symmetric antiferromagnet

Itinerant antiferromagnets with broken time-reversal symmetry have recently
attracted attention, since their spin-split bands enable large magnetotransport
responses comparable to ferromagnets despite the negligible spontaneous
magnetisation. When the inversion symmetry is further broken by the
antiferromagnetic order, the emerging odd-parity multipole order renders the
bands spin-degenerate but asymmetric in the momentum space. For such
parity-time-symmetric antiferromagnets, it has been predicted that electronic
nematicity is induced by current, allowing unconventional nonlinear transport
phenomena. However, their experimental evidence has been lacking. Here, we
report nonreciprocal angular magnetoresistance in the layered Dirac material
SrMnBi$_2$ with parity-time-symmetric antiferromagnetic order in its Mn-Bi
layers. By quantitatively modelling the angular and field dependencies using a
phenomenological framework, we reveal that the observed nonreciprocal
interlayer resistivity arises from the broken four-fold symmetry of the Dirac
valleys in the Bi square net adjacent to the Mn-Bi layer. Furthermore, we
demonstrate the alignment of parity-time-symmetric antiferromagnetic domains
via current-field cooling, achieving electric-magnetic control of the $f$-wave
polarity in momentum space. The observed switchable nonreciprocal transport
associated with current-induced valley symmetry breaking paves the way for
novel antiferromagnetic spintronic and valleytronic applications.

Understanding crack tip - dislocation interaction is critical for improving
the fracture resistance of semi-brittle materials like room-temperature
plastically deformable ceramics. Here, we use a modified double cleavage
drilled compression (DCDC) specimen geometry, which facilitates stable crack
propagation, to achieve in situ observation of crack tip - dislocation
interaction. MgO specimens, furnished with dislocation-rich barriers, were
employed to study how dislocations influence crack propagation. Crack
progression was clearly observed to decelerate within dislocation-rich regions,
slowing to 15% of its velocity as compared to the pristine crystal. Upon
exiting these regions, cracks reaccelerated until reaching the next
dislocation-rich barrier. Coupled phase field and crystal plasticity modeling
replicates the experimental observations and provides mechanistic insight into
crack tip - dislocation interactions. The aligned experiment and simulation
results underscore the robustness of the technique and its potential to inform
the design of more fracture-resistant ceramics via dislocations.

An analytically solvable cell fluid model with unrestricted cell occupancy,
infinite-range Curie-Weiss-type attraction and short-range intra-cell repulsion
is studied within the grand-canonical ensemble. Building on an exact
single-integral representation of the grand partition function, we apply
Laplace's method to obtain asymptotically exact expressions for the pressure,
density and equation of state. The model exhibits a hierarchy of first-order
transitions, each terminating at a critical point. We determine the coordinates
of the first five such points. Recasting the formalism in dimensionless
variables highlights the explicit temperature dependence of all thermodynamic
functions. This enables us to derive a closed-form expression for the entropy.
The results reveal pronounced entropy minima around integer cell occupancies
and reproduce density-anomaly isotherm crossings analogous to those in
core-softened models.

Electrochemical corrosion significantly reduces the durability of electrodes
in water electrolyzers, adversely affecting hydrogen (H$_2$) production and
cell efficiency. Current theoretical models inadequately assess corrosion
behaviors in alkaline water electrolyzers. To address this, we developed a
physics-informed electrochemical corrosion model evaluating the corrosion
characteristics of cathodes in alkaline systems, accounting for factors such as
exchange current density ($J_0$), redox potential ($E_0$), Gibbs free energy of
hydrogen adsorption ($\Delta G_{\rm H}$), electrolyte concentration ($C$),
system pressure ($P$), and temperature ($T$). The model calculates metrics
including corrosion potential ($E_{\rm corr}$), corrosion current density
($J_{\rm corr}$), and corrosion rate ($C_R$). Our findings from potentiodynamic
polarization indicate that gold (Au) shows the highest durability, while copper
(Cu) and nickel (Ni) are promising cost-effective alternatives. This work
enhances the understanding of corrosion dynamics, contributing to the design of
more efficient electrolyzer cells for hydrogen production.

### Bulk photovoltaic effects in the Haldane model

The bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) refers to the direct current generation
in a noncentrosymmetric material under illumination and can be applied to solar
energy technology. BPVE includes injection and shift currents, led by the
change of velocity and displacement of wave packet during optical transitions,
respectively. We derive the constraints on the conductivity tensors imposed by
mirror-time ($\mathcal{MT}$) symmetry for two-dimensional systems. For the
Haldane model, we show that linearly polarized light can induce shift and
injection currents, which vanish under circularly polarized light as
constrained by the three-fold rotation and $\mathcal{MT}$ symmetry.
Additionally, due to the presence of $\mathcal{MT}$ symmetry, a separation of
responses is observed in the Haldane model: one direction exhibits a
time-reversal symmetry-allowed response, whereas another manifests a
parity-time symmetry-allowed response. Across the topological phase transition,
the injection current does not change sign, whereas shift current shows a sign
flip. The vector field of the Hermitian connection in the Brillouin zone
possesses vortices in the topological phase, but not in the trivial phase.
Furthermore, we calculate the related quantum geometry, including Berry
curvature, quantum metric and Hermitian connection, and demonstrate the
microscopic quantum origin of the BPVE.

Accurate quantum simulations of catalysis on metal surfaces are critical for
advancing energy and materials science. Yet most existing methods fall short:
density functional theory (DFT), although widely used for its computational
efficiency, often lacks the accuracy needed for adsorption and reaction
energetics at heterogeneous metal surfaces. Wavefunction-based theories, in
contrast, are more accurate in principle but remain prohibitively costly when
applied to realistic catalytic systems. Here we introduce FEMION (Fragment
Embedding for Metals and Insulators with Onsite and Nonlocal correlation), a
quantum embedding framework that resolves the long-standing challenge of
accurately describing partially filled electronic states in metals while
retaining accuracy for insulators. FEMION combines highly accurate solvers such
as auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo to capture many-body effects at
catalytic sites, together with a global random phase approximation treatment of
nonlocal screening, providing a scalable and systematically improvable
framework for accurate quantum simulations. We demonstrate chemical accuracy
for two long-standing challenges in heterogeneous catalysis: the preference
site of CO adsorption and the H2 desorption barrier on the Cu(111) surface,
where conventional methods have struggled for decades. Beyond achieving
quantitative accuracy, FEMION offers a many-body bonding analysis that reveals
why DFT fails to capture the CO adsorption preference, highlighting the
critical role of electron correlation in governing surface energetics. FEMION
thus establishes a robust route to predictive, first-principles modeling of
complex catalytic systems.

### Non-Abelian Statistics for Bosonic Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases

Symmetry-protected non-Abelian (SPNA) statistics opens new frontiers in
quantum statistics and enriches the schemes for topological quantum computing.
In this work, we propose a novel type of SPNA statistics in one-dimensional
strongly correlated bosonic symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases and
reveal its exotic universal features through a comprehensive investigation.
Specifically, we show a universal result for a wide range of bosonic SPT phases
described by real Hamiltonians: the SPNA statistics of topological zero modes
fall into two distinct classes. The first class exhibits conventional braiding
statistics of hard-core bosons. Furthermore, we discover a second class of
unconventional braiding statistics, featuring a fractionalization of the first
class and reminiscent of the non-Abelian statistics of symmetry-protected
Majorana pairs. The two distinct classes of statistics have a topological
origin in the classification of non-Abelian Berry phases in braiding processes
of real-Hamiltonian systems, distinguished by whether the holonomy includes a
reflection operation.. To illustrate, we focus on a specific bosonic SPT phase
with particle number conservation and particle-hole symmetry, and demonstrate
that both classes of braiding statistics can be feasibly realized in a
tri-junction of the SPT phase with the aid of a controlled local defect. In
this example, the zero modes are protected by unitary symmetries and are
therefore immune to dynamical symmetry breaking. Numerical results support our
theoretical predictions. Based on the tri-junction implementation, we
demonstrate how to encode logical qubits and implement both single- and
two-qubit gates using the two classes of SPNA statistics. We further propose
feasible experimental schemes to realize these SPNA statistics and identify the
parameter regimes that ensure high-fidelity braiding results.

While traditional trial-and-error methods for designing amorphous alloys are
costly and inefficient, machine learning approaches based solely on composition
lack critical atomic structural information. Machine learning interatomic
potentials, trained on data from first-principles calculations, offer a
powerful alternative by efficiently approximating the complex three-dimensional
potential energy surface with near-DFT accuracy. In this work, we develop a
general-purpose machine learning interatomic potential for amorphous alloys by
using a dataset comprising 20400 configurations across representative binary
and ternary amorphous alloys systems. The model demonstrates excellent
predictive performance on an independent test set, with a mean absolute error
of 5.06 meV/atom for energy and 128.51 meV/\r{A} for forces. Through extensive
validation, the model is shown to reliably capture the trends in macroscopic
property variations such as density, Young's modulus and glass transition
temperature across both the original training systems and the compositionally
modified systems derived from them. It can be directly applied to
composition-property mapping of amorphous alloys. Furthermore, the developed
interatomic potential enables access to the atomic structures of amorphous
alloys, allowing for microscopic analysis and interpretation of experimental
results, particularly those deviating from empirical trends.This work breaks
the long-standing computational bottleneck in amorphous alloys research by
developing the first general-purpose machine learning interatomic potential for
amorphous alloy systems. The resulting framework provides a robust foundation
for data-driven design and high-throughput composition screening in a field
previously constrained by traditional simulation limitations.

Finding the time dependent perturbation that extracts the maximal amount of
energy (a.k.a. ergotropy) from a thermally isolated quantum system is a
central, solved, problem in quantum thermodynamics. Notably, the same problem
has been long studied for classical systems as well, e.g., in the field of
plasma physics, but a general solution is still missing there. By building on
the analogy with the quantum solution, we provide the classical ergotropy
extraction driving: it consists of an instantaneous quench followed by an
adiabatic return. We illustrate how the solution, which is valid under an
ergodic assumption, is instrumental to finding the ergotropy extracting driving
in more general cases. We also show that, just like in the quantum case, the
classical ergotropy splits into a coherent and an incoherent part. The
presented results open new ways for practical energy recovery in the classical
regime while suggesting that there is nothing genuinely quantum in the quantum
ergotropy problem.

Ammonia, a critical chemical fertilizer and a potential hydrogen carrier, can
be sustainably synthesized from atmospheric nitrogen and water under ambient
conditions through photocatalysis. In this study, high-entropy oxides with d0
and mixed d0+d10 cationic configurations are introduced as a new group of
catalysts for nitrogen fixation and photocatalytic ammonia production. The
oxides exhibit impressive efficiency in ammonia production compared to binary
oxides, while the efficiency is improved by using a mixed cationic
configuration. It was shown that the incorporation of d10 elements, such as
gallium and zinc, boosts the photocatalytic reactions by improving light
absorbance, charge separation and charge lifetime. These findings demonstrate
the potential of high-entropy oxides as next-generation photocatalysts for
green ammonia synthesis, offering an effective alternative to conventional
catalytic systems.

The gapless chiral hinge states of three dimensional second-order topological
insulators (SOTIs) support a quantized conductance plateau on thick nanowire.
Here, we numerical study the conductance of SOTI constrictions. According to
finite size effects, the hinge states in narrow region could be hybridized,
which will induce reflection at the two ends of constrictions. The conductance
exists the Fabry-Perot oscillation pattern because of multiple reflections. We
also study the impact of the magnetic field on the Fabry-Perot interference. We
show the dimensional effect that the magnetic field leads to the electrons
being localized on two hinges. Our results are robust against moderate disorder
so that we expect these Fabry-Perot patterns could be observed in experiments.

We discuss the Fermi-velocity renormalization in twisted bilayer graphene due
to Coulomb exchange interaction within an atomistic tight-binding model.
Adopting the Slater-Koster parametrization for the hopping parameters obtained
from first principles, our results only depend on the effective dielectric
constant $\epsilon$ and the Hubbard-interaction $U$. The Fermi velocity of
graphene increases twist-angle independent by $~25\%$ for $\epsilon=10$ and
$U=4eV$, leading to an increase by more than $100\%$ of the flat bandwidth at
twist-angle $\theta=1.4^\circ$. Including also the renormalization of the
out-of-plane hopping terms, we further observe a shift of the magic angle from
$1.02^\circ$ to $0.96^\circ$. Our results offer a microscopic explanation of
the critical temperature, $T_c$, as function of the twist angle where the
largest $T_c$ is found at $\theta_{max}=1.1^\circ$. For $\theta&gt;\theta_{max}$,
$T_c$ is obtained from the Bethe-Salpeter equation of the Cooper channel. For
$\theta&lt;\theta_{max}$, the discussion is based on the critical line of the
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition.

The nonmagnetic kagome metal ScV6Sn6 displays an unconventional charge order
(CO) accompanied by signatures of an anomalous Hall effect, hidden magnetism,
and multiple lattice instabilities. In this study, we report the observation of
unconventional anomalous thermoelectric properties. Notably, unexpected
anomalous transverse Nernst signals reach a peak value of ~4 {\mu}V/K near the
TCDW ~92 K in ScV6Sn6, and these signals persist in the charge-ordered state as
the temperature decreases to 10 K. Furthermore, both thermopower and thermal
conductivity exhibit significant changes under magnetic fields, even in the
nonmagnetic ground state. These observations strongly suggest the emergence of
time-reversal symmetry breaking in ScV6Sn6, as supported by muon spin
relaxation ({\mu}SR) measurements. While hidden magnetism represents the most
plausible origin, alternative mechanisms involving orbital currents and chiral
charge order remain possible.

### Domain Wall-mediated Interfacial Ferroelectric Switching

Interfacial ferroelectricity offers a promising platform for ultrafast,
low-power memory devices. While previous studies have attributed polarization
switching to full-layer sliding, the symmetry constraints pose fundamental
limitations. By integrating first-principles calculations, machine learning
methods, and experimental validations, we show that domain walls within
in-plane polarization break C3 symmetry, enabling polarization switching under
out-of-plane electric fields. Local polarization vectors deviate to response to
the field, leading to local reconstruction, and ultimately drives the migration
of domain walls. This mechanism bears clear resemblance to that in traditional
ferroelectrics. Notably, different domain wall types result in distinct
switching behaviors, which play a crucial role in determining the reversibility
of polarization switching. We then propose strategies beyond ideal conditions
to achieve non-volatile ferroelectric switching, successfully realized by our
experiments. These insights clarify the microscopic switching mechanism in
hexagonal interfacial ferroelectrics, providing a basis for future
nanoelectronics applications.

### Strongly correlated stochastic systems

- **TL;DR**: 这篇论文发展了分析强相关随机系统的准确方法，重点研究极值统计、间隔统计和多粒子过程的计数统计，通过条件独立同分布变量框架获得了普遍的闭式解。

This thesis develops exact analytical tools to study strongly correlated
stochastic systems, with a focus on extreme value statistics, gap statistics,
and full counting statistics in multi-particle processes. A central
contribution is the universal characterization of conditionally independent
identically distributed variables-random variables that become independent upon
conditioning on latent parameters. This structure arises naturally in systems
with stochastic resetting, a mechanism that generates strong long-range
correlations while retaining analytical tractability.
  Using this framework, we derive universal closed-form expressions for several
observables across diverse models, including Brownian motion, Levy flights,
ballistic particles, and Dyson Brownian motion, under various resetting
protocols. In particular, we demonstrate that resetting induces analytically
tractable non-equilibrium steady states.
  Theoretical predictions are supported by numerical comparisons and
experimental comparisons in systems such as diffusive particles in switching
harmonic traps. Applications to search optimization are also explored,
identifying regimes where resetting enhances or impairs first-passage
efficiency, and proposing rescaling-based protocols that outperform traditional
resetting.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一系列专门优化用于大分子和晶体受过状态计算的全电子基组，通过扩充现有基础基组实现了高效的GW空隙和Bethe-Salpeter求解收敛，而且保持了较低的数值稳定性。

We introduce a family of all-electron Gaussian basis sets, augmented MOLOPT,
optimized for excited-state calculations on large molecules and crystals. We
generate these basis sets by augmenting existing STO-3G, STO-6G, and MOLOPT
basis sets optimizied for ground state energy calculations. The augmented
MOLOPT basis sets achieve fast convergence of $GW$ gaps and Bethe-Salpeter
excitation energies, while maintaining low condition numbers of the overlap
matrix to ensure numerical stability. For $GW$ HOMO-LUMO gaps, the double-zeta
augmented MOLOPT basis yields a mean absolute deviation of 60 meV to the
complete basis set limit. The basis set convergence for excitation energies
from time-dependent density functional theory and the Bethe-Salpeter equation
is similar. We use our smallest generated augmented MOLOPT basis
(aug-SZV-MOLOPT-ae-mini) to demonstrate $GW$ calculations on nanographenes with
2312 atoms requiring only 3500 core hours and 2.9 TB RAM as computational
resources.

### Waveguiding in two-dimensional Floquet non-Abelian topological insulators

- **TL;DR**: 通过周期驱动构建了二维非阿贝尔高阶拓扑相，发现角落和边缘状态出现在所有能空间缺口，通过空间交换驱动产生了非平移界面模式，证明了非阿贝尔动力学特性。

Topological phases characterized by non-Abelian charges have garnered
increasing attention recently. Although Floquet (periodic-driving) higher-order
topological phases have been explored at the single-particle level, the role of
interactions in non-Abelian topological insulators with multiple entangled
energy gaps remains incompletely understood. In this work, we extend previous
research by investigating higher-order topological phases featuring non-Abelian
charges through Floquet engineering. Here we construct a model for
two-dimensional non-Abelian higher-order topological phases on a square lattice
subjected to two-step periodic driving. We find that the corner and edge states
emerge and appear in all energy gaps despite the quaternion charge being
trivial. Moreover, spatially exchanging the driving generates exotic interface
modes-a hallmark of non-Abelian dynamics, namely non-commutativity. Notably,
the non-zero composite Chern number demonstrates the non-triviality of the
Floquet non-Abelian system with. We further reveal that the configuration of
these quaternion-charge edge states is entirely determined by the quadruple
degenerate phase-band singularities in the time evolution. Our work provides a
platform for studying higher-order topological states and non-equilibrium
quantum dynamics.

The square cupola antiferromagnet Pb(TiO)Cu$_4$(PO$_4$)$_4$ exhibits the
intriguing magnetoelectric responses arising from the consecutive change in the
magnetic quadrupolar-type configuration of magnetic moments under external
magnetic fields higher than 15 T. To clarify the high-field magnetic structures
in Pb(TiO)Cu$_4$(PO$_4$)$_4$, an NMR measurement was performed in pulsed fields
up to 32.2 T significantly extending the field range accessible by
superconducting magnets. The double-peak structure of NMR spectra emerging
above 29 T applied along the [001] direction evidences the successive magnetic
transitions. The field dependence of NMR spectra was analyzed on the basis of
cluster mean-field theory, which allows us to propose possible magnetic
structures for the high-field magnetic states.

Ovonic threshold switching is the key process for several applications of
chalcogenide alloys including phase change memories and selector elements in
cross-points arrays. Very recently, it has been shown that the threshold
switching voltage VT depends on the polarity of the applied field. This feature
has been already exploited in the realization of the Single Chalcogenide
X-point Memory (SXM) in which a single film of a chalcogenide alloy can serve
as both a memory and selector unit. In this work, we provide a microscopic
understanding of the polarity-dependent VT by leveraging electrical and
physical measurements, numerical simulations based on technology computer aided
design (TCAD) and electronic structure calculations based on density functional
theory (DFT). We developed a Graded Band Gap (GBG) model in which an
inhomogeneous distribution of localized electronic states in the gap is
established by the opposite effect of a strong electric field at the cathode
and a high density of electrons in the conduction band at the anode. The model
is suitable to reproduce several features of the programming window, including
its dependence on temperature, thickness and composition of the chalcogenide
alloy. The microscopic understanding that we gained on the SXM operation lays
the foundation for important improvements in the memory design and in the
selection of better performing alloys for applications in enabling memory
technologies.

### Precision and cost of feedback cooling

- **TL;DR**: 信息交换与冷却效果的关系研究，推导出了低于环境温度的冷却的基本下限和能消耗约束

We investigate the consequences of information exchange between a system and
a measurement-feedback apparatus that cools the system below the environmental
temperature. A quantitative relationship between entropy pumping and
information acquired about the system is derived, showing that, independent of
the concrete realization of the feedback, the latter exceeds the former by a
positive amount of excess information flow. This excess information flow
satisfies a trade-off relation with the precision of the feedback force, which
places strong constraints on both the information-theoretic cost of feedback
cooling and the required magnitude of the feedback force. From these
constraints, a fundamental lower bound on the energetic cost of optical
feedback cooling is derived. Finally, the results are demonstrated for feedback
cooling by coherent light scattering. We show that measurement precision is the
major factor determining the attainable temperature. Precise measurements can
also be leveraged to reduce the required feedback force, leading to
significantly more energy-efficient cooling close to the fundamental bound for
realistic parameter values.

Recent advances in machine learning force fields (MLFF) have significantly
extended the capabilities of atomistic simulations. This progress highlights
the critical need for reliable reference datasets, accurate MLFFs, and,
crucially, efficient active learning strategies to enable robust modeling of
complex chemical and materials systems. Here, we introduce aims-PAX, an
automated, multi-trajectory active learning framework that streamlines the
development of MLFFs. Designed for both experts and newcomers, aims-PAX offers
a modular, high-performance workflow that couples flexible sampling with
scalable training across CPU and GPU architectures. Built on the widely adopted
ab initio code FHI-aims, the framework seamlessly integrates with
state-of-the-art ML models and supports pretraining using general-purpose (or
"foundational") models for rapid deployment in diverse systems. We demonstrate
the capabilities of aims-PAX on two challenging systems: a highly flexible
peptide and bulk CsPbI$_3$ perovskite. Across these cases, aims-PAX achieves a
reduction of up to two orders of magnitude in the number of required reference
calculations and enables over 20x speedup in AL cycle time through optimized
resource utilization. This positions aims-PAX as a powerful and versatile
platform for next-generation ML-driven atomistic simulations in both academic

We construct a class of conformal boundary states in the $\mathrm{SU}(n)_1$
Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) conformal field theory (CFT) using the symmetry
embedding $\mathrm{Spin}(n)_2 \subset \mathrm{SU}(n)_1$. These boundary states
are beyond the standard Cardy construction and possess $\mathrm{SO}(n)$
symmetry. The $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ Uimin-Lai-Sutherland (ULS) spin chains, which
realize the $\mathrm{SU}(n)_1$ WZW model on the lattice, allow us to identify
these boundary states as the ground states of the $\mathrm{SO}(n)$
Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki spin chains. Using the integrability of the
$\mathrm{SU}(n)$ ULS model, we analytically compute the corresponding
Affleck-Ludwig boundary entropy using exact overlap formulas. Our results
unveil intriguing connections between exotic boundary states in CFT and
integrable lattice models, thus providing deep insights into the interplay of
symmetry, integrability, and boundary critical phenomena.

### Comparative study of magnetic exchange parameters and magnon dispersions in NiO and MnO from first principles

Spin-wave excitations are fundamental to understanding the behavior of
magnetic materials and hold promise for future information and communication
technologies. Yet, modeling these accurately in transition-metal compounds
remains challenging, starting from the self-interaction errors affecting
localized and partially filled $d$-orbitals in density-functional theory (DFT)
with (semi-)local functionals. In this work, we compare three advanced
first-principles approaches for computing magnetic exchange parameters and
magnon dispersions in NiO and MnO, all based on a common DFT+$U$ ground state
with ab initio Hubbard $U$ values obtained from density-functional perturbation
theory. Two methods extract exchange parameters directly: one via total-energy
differences using the four-state mapping ($\Delta E$), and the other via the
magnetic force theorem (MFT) using infinitesimal spin rotations. Magnon
dispersions are then obtained from a Heisenberg Hamiltonian through linear
spin-wave theory (LSWT). The third approach, time-dependent density-functional
perturbation theory with $U$ (TDDFPT+$U$), yields magnon dispersions directly
from the dynamical spin susceptibility, with exchange parameters fitted a
posteriori, for comparison, via LSWT. Our results show that TDDFPT+$U$ and the
Heisenberg model based on $\Delta E$-derived parameters align well with
experimental neutron scattering data, whereas the MFT-based approach shows
larger discrepancies, possibly due to some inherent approximations and
limitations of the particular implementation used. This study benchmarks the
accuracy of state-of-the-art first-principles techniques for spin-wave modeling
and contributes to advancing reliable computational tools for the study and
design of magnetic materials.

Thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs) provide fundamental constraints on
the interplay between power fluctuations, entropy production, and efficiency in
overdamped stationary autonomous heat engines. However, their validity in
underdamped regimes remains limited and less explored. Here, we analytically
and numerically study a physically realizable autonomous heat engine composed
of two underdamped continuous degrees of freedom coupled to a two-level system.
We show that this nonlinear setup can robustly violate TUR-based trade-offs by
exploiting resonant coupling, effectively using one underdamped mode as an
internal periodic drive. When this coupling is suppressed, the system recovers
TUR-like bounds consistent with overdamped theory. Importantly, we demonstrate
that the strongest suppression of current fluctuations occurs in a resonance
regime that can be directly inferred from mean current measurements - a
quantity typically much easier to access experimentally than fluctuations. Our
results reveal new pathways to circumvent classical TUR constraints in
underdamped systems and provide practical guidelines for designing efficient,
precise microscopic engines and autonomous clocks.

### Computing Exchange Coupling constants in Transition metal complexes with Tensor Product Selected Configuration Interaction

Transition metal complexes present significant challenges for electronic
structure theory due to strong electron correlation arising from partially
filled $d$-orbitals. We compare our recently developed Tensor Product Selected
Configuration Interaction (TPSCI) with Density Matrix Renormalization Group
(DMRG) for computing exchange coupling constants in six transition metal
systems, including dinuclear Cr, Fe, and Mn complexes and a tetranuclear
Ni-cubane. TPSCI uses a locally correlated tensor product state basis to
capture electronic structure efficiently while maintaining interpretability.
From calculations on active spaces ranging from (22e,29o) to (42e,49o), we find
that TPSCI consistently yields higher variational energies than DMRG due to
truncation of local cluster states, but provides magnetic exchange coupling
constants (J) generally within 10-30 cm$^{-1}$ of DMRG results. Key advantages
include natural multistate capability enabling direct J extrapolation with
smaller statistical errors, and computational efficiency for challenging
systems. However, cluster state truncation represents a fundamental limitation
requiring careful convergence testing, particularly for large local cluster
dimensions. We identify specific failure cases where current truncation schemes
break down, highlighting the need for improved cluster state selection methods
and distributed memory implementations to realize TPSCI's full potential for
strongly correlated systems.

Quantum spin Hall edge transport in two-dimensional transition-metal
dichalcogenides depends on whether their one-dimensional edge channels are
preserved under realistic substrates and device boundaries. Here we implement
spin-orbit coupling in DFTB and GFN-xTB within the Amsterdam Modeling Suite,
and apply it to 1T$'$/2H WSe$_2$ heterostructures. Edge-projected spectra
reveal robust edge states in 1T$'$ ribbons; and these states remain robust
against a laterally infinite 2H substrate, which only shifts the Dirac point
via long-wavelength corrugation without introducing additional in-gap states.
By contrast, terminated 2H edges generate trivial dispersion branches in the
same energy window that hybridize only weakly with the topological edge modes.
In the bulk, Fermi-level states are 1T$'$-derived; at the small twist angle,
lattice-relaxation-induced strain drives miniband reconstruction, whereas at
the large twist angle, the layers become electronically decoupled. These
findings suggest the conditions -- controlled twist angle and avoidance of
terminated 2H edges -- for achieving quantized conductance and unambiguous
spectroscopic

Soft-solid molecular crystals consist of crystalline grains and fluid grain
boundaries (GB) that enhance the grain binding and transport of Li+ ions
between the grains. The total ionic conductivity consists of ion migration in
both the grains and GBs. To unravel these contributions in adiponitrile
(Adpn)-LiPF6 molecular crystals, the GB volume fraction was varied by changing
the size of the crystals and the adiponitrile/LiPF6 molar ratio. Molecular
dynamic (MD) simulations indicate that ion motion was sub-diffusive in the
grains and well-diffusive in the GBs, with GBs characterized as disordered
nano-confined regions of higher charge carrier concentration (1M) than in
saturated LiPF6-Adpn solutions (0.04M), and ions predominantly solvated by -CN
groups with few contact ion pairs. The diffusivity in the GBs is at least an
order of magnitude higher than in the crystalline grains. The emergent picture
is the grains as a reservoir of ions that migrate to the fast-conducting GBs.

Nanoconfined water plays a key role in nanofluidics, electrochemistry, and
catalysis, yet its reactivity remains a matter of debate. Prior studies have
reported both enhanced and suppressed water self-dissociation relative to the
bulk, but without a consistent explanation. Here, using enhanced sampling
molecular dynamics with machine-learned potentials trained at first-principles
accuracy, we investigate dissociation behavior in water confined within 2D slit
pores and nanodroplets, using graphene and hexagonal boron nitride as model
materials. We find that reactivity is extremely sensitive to water density,
confinement width, geometry, material flexibility, and surface chemistry.
Despite this complexity, we show that chemical potential -- together with
interfacial interactions -- governs dissociation trends and explains the
variability observed in prior studies. This thermodynamic perspective
reconciles previous contradictions and reveals how nanoscale environments can
drastically shift water reactivity. Our findings provide molecular-level
insight and offer a design lever for modulating water chemistry at the
nanoscale.

CMOS-compatible HfO2-based ferroelectric tunnel junction (FTJ) has attracted
significant attention as a promising candidate for in-memory computing (IMC)
due to its extremely low power consumption. However, conventional FTJs face
inherent challenges and hinder their practical applications. Insufficient
current density (JON) and limited on-off current ratios in FTJs are primarily
constrained by their dependence on direct tunneling (DT) and Fowler-Nordheim
(FN) tunneling mechanisms. Building on previous experimental results, this
paper proposes a trap-assisted tunneling (TAT)-based FTJ that leverages the TAT
mechanism to overcome these limitations. A comprehensive FTJ model integrating
ferroelectric (FE) switching, DT, FN tunneling, and TAT mechanisms is
developed, enabling detailed analyses of the trap conditions and their impact
on performance. Through systematic optimization of trap parameters and device
structure, the TAT-based FTJ achieves ultra-high JON and a remarkable on-off
current ratio, meeting the nanoscale IMC requirements. The results highlight
the potential of TAT-based FTJs as high-performance memory solutions for IMC
applications.

Understanding nonequilibrium electron-phonon interactions at the microscopic
level and on ultrafast timescales is a central goal of modern condensed matter
physics. Combining time- and angle-resolved extreme ultraviolet photoemission
spectroscopy with constrained density functional perturbation theory, we
demonstrate that photoexcited carrier density can serve as a tuning knob to
enhance electron-phonon interactions in nonequilibrium conditions.
Specifically, nonequilibrium band structure mapping and valley-resolved
ultrafast population dynamics in semiconducting transition-metal dichalcogenide
2H-MoTe$_2$ reveal band-gap renormalizations and reduced population lifetimes
as photoexcited carrier densities increase. Through theoretical analysis of
photoinduced electron and phonon energy and linewidth renormalizations, we
attribute these transient features to nonequilibrium modifications of
electron-phonon coupling matrix elements. The present study advances our
understanding of microscopic coupling mechanisms enabling control over
relaxation pathways in driven solids.

We demonstrate that there exist frequency domain Berry curvature in the wave
function of photons in dispersive optical systems. This property arises from
the frequency dispersion of its dielectric function, which makes Maxwell
equations a non-standard eigenvalue equation, with the eigenvalue (frequency)
appearing inside the operator itself. We study this new Berry curvature effect
on time refraction of magnetoplasmon-polariton as an example. It can induce
deflection in the trajectory of a photon and make the ray swing.

### Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction Enhanced by Synergetic Interactions among Photon Phonon and Molecule

Photocatalytic CO2 reduction is limited by inefficient CO2 activation and
poor solar spectrum utilization. Here, we discovered and revealed the vibration
coupling mechanism among photons, phonons, and molecules, which remarkably
enhances photocatalytic catalysis of CO2 into fuels. We designed the
nitrogen-doped Cu2O-based catalyst loaded onto the quartz optical substrate.
The N-doping Cu2O converts linearly geometry of adsorbed CO2 molecules, which
efficiently lowers the activation barrier and facilitates CO2 dissociation.
Once the Cu-based catalyst is combined with a micro-pillar quartz film, the
system induces vibrational strong coupling (VSC) between the asymmetric CO2
stretching mode and surface phonon polariton resonances. These resonances arise
from the photothermal conversion of incident solar photons on the
micro-pillars. The resonant coupling phenomena were further verified by
Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy using Synchrotron Radiation Source
(SRS), which directly confirmed the interactions between molecular vibrations
and photonic-phononic modes. The synergetic functions originated from this
hybrid architecture achieve a CO yield of 167.7 umol h-1 g-1 under pure water
conditions, which is the highest reported yield for Cu2O-based photocatalysts
with 46% enhancement over non-VSC systems. This work uncovers a novel
photo-thermal mechanism. It further provides a new strategy to control bond
activation in photocatalytic CO2 conversion through light-vibration-matter
coupling.

Altermagnetism is a novel magnetic phase combining characteristics of both
antiferromagnetism and ferromagnetic ordering. Despite growing theoretical
interest in altermagnetic materials, reports of experimentally verified high
Neel temperature layered compounds are limited or remain to be firmly
established. Here, we present an angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy
(ARPES) and density functional theory (DFT) study of Co1/4TaSe2, a compound we
identify as a layered altermagnetic material. Magnetic susceptibility
measurements confirm type A antiferromagnetic ordering with a Neel temperature
of 178 K. Our ARPES measurements reveal an electronic band structure in
excellent agreement with DFT calculations, demonstrating clear signatures of
altermagnetic spin splitting at the Fermi surface. Furthermore, temperature
dependent ARPES reveals a reconstructed valence band structure, with observable
band shifts and the closing of energy gaps upon heating above the Neel
temperature (TN), consistent with the suppression of altermagnetic order. These
findings establish Co1/4TaSe2 as a promising platform for exploring
altermagnetic phenomena.

- **TL;DR**: 开发了铁铝系统的角度依赖潜能，能准确预测相变过程、弹性性质、缺陷能量和高压下的相变，通过原子模拟揭示了高压下的双粘合相变机制

An angular-dependent potential for the U-Nb system is developed based on an
existing ADP for U and a new EAM potential for Nb through fitting flexible
cross-interaction functions and alloy parameters to experimental and
first-principles data, enabling accurate prediction of phase transitions (alpha
to gamma driven by solute concentration; alpha-prime to gamma under temperature
in U-6Nb alloy), elastic properties, defect energetics, and mixed enthalpy. The
potential reliably reproduces melting points of U-Nb solid solutions and
captures lattice parameter expansion of gamma U-6Nb. Notably, it correctly
predicts Hugoniot relations and equations of state up to about 90 GPa and
resolves the alpha-prime to gamma transition under static high pressure.
Combined with atomic simulations, we reveal a twinning-coupled alpha-prime to
gamma transition of U-6Nb under high pressures: {112}gamma twins form via
nanosecond-scale twinning precursors generated during the transient adiabatic
compressions. The static phase transition pressure is predicted to be 54.5 GPa,
comparable to 67.2 GPa by first-principles calculations. Besides, our result
suggests that U-6Nb single-crystal would experience a nonlinear elastic
relaxation before yielding plastically at 3.1 GPa (shear stress: 0.9 GPa). The
results in this work help resolve long-standing discrepancies in understanding
the abnormal shear stress relaxation mechanisms under high-pressure shock
loading.

Magnetic skyrmions are chiral spin structures with non-trivial topology that
comprise two-dimensional quasi-particles and are promising information carriers
for data storage and processing devices. Skyrmion lattices in magnetic thin
films exhibit Kosterlitz-Thouless-Halperin-Nelson-Young (KTHNY) phase
transitions and have garnered significant interest for studying emergent 2D
phase behavior. In experimental skyrmion lattices, the main factor limiting the
quasi-long-range order in thin films has been the non-flat energy landscape -
often referred to as pinning effects. We demonstrate direct control of the
skyrmion lattice order by effectively tuning the energy landscape employing
magnetic field oscillations. By quantifying lattice order and dynamics, we
explore how domain boundaries form and evolve due to pinning effects in Kerr
microscopy experiments and in Brownian dynamics simulations, offering a pathway
to control and study emergent skyrmion lattice properties and 2D phase
behavior.

Exciton-polariton Bose-Einstein condensation at room temperature offers a
promising pathway toward quantum photonic technologies that can operate under
ambient conditions. A key challenge in this field is to engineer a controlled
platform where strong confinement, nonlinear interactions, and structural
disorder coexist, unlocking access to rich collective behavior and
unconventional condensate dynamics. We demonstrate polariton condensation in
CsPbBr$_3$ microplatelets that self-assemble into whispering gallery mode
microresonators featuring tight lateral photon confinement finely balanced with
intrinsic disorder. The system exhibits hallmark signatures of
out-of-equilibrium condensation, including a non-linear increase in emission
intensity, spectral narrowing, and interaction-induced blueshift. Intrinsic
disorder subtly reshapes the cavity energy landscape, inducing condensate
fragmentation and enabling direct optical access to the condensate
wavefunction. Interferometric measurements reveal extended phase coherence,
whereas characteristic fork-shaped fringe dislocations confirm the presence of
quantized vortices pinned by the disordered potential. These topological
excitations underscore the rich physics driven by the interplay of gain, loss,
confinement, and disorder. Our work establishes a scalable platform for
investigating driven-dissipative quantum fluids of light at room temperature,
where the intrinsic disorder balances optical confinement and provides a window
into condensate wavefunction, coherence, and vortex phenomena. This study
system opens new opportunities for exploring many-body physics and potentially
advancing topological photonics in integrable microcavity architectures.

An excitonic insulator is a material that hosts an exotic ground state, where
an energy gap opens due to spontaneous condensation of bound electron-hole
pairs. Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ is a promising candidate for this type of material, but
the coexistence of a structural phase transition with the gap opening has led
to a long-standing debate regarding the origin of the insulating gap. Here we
employ MeV ultrafast electron diffraction to obtain quantitative insights into
the atomic displacements in Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ following photoexcitation, which has
been overlooked in previous time-resolved spectroscopy studies. In conjunction
with first-principles calculations using the measured atomic displacements, we
find that the structural change can largely account for the photoinduced
reduction in the energy gap without considering excitonic effects. Our work
illustrates the importance of a quantitative reconstruction of individual
atomic pathways during nonequilibrium phase transitions, paving the way for a
mechanistic understanding of a diverse array of phase transitions in correlated
materials where lattice dynamics can play a pivotal role.

- **TL;DR**: 层状铁氧氢氧化物(LIOX)通过扇形氨基酸插层实现了室温碳化量子磁体，具有螺旋碳性和光访问性

Chiral quantum magnets with spin-states separated by a large energy gap are
technologically attractive but difficult to realize. Geometrically frustrated
topological states with nanoscale chirality may offer a chemical pathway to
such materials. However, room temperature spin misalignment, weakness of
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, and high energy requirements for lattice
distortions set high physicochemical barriers for their realization. Here, we
show that layered iron oxyhydroxides (LIOX) address these challenges due to
chirality transfer from surface ligands into spin-states of dimerized FeO6
octahedra with zig-zag stacking. The intercalation of chiral amino acids
induces angular displacements in the antiferromagnetic spin pairs with a
helical coupling of magnetic moments along the screw axis of the zig-zag
chains, or helical spin-ladders. Unlike other chiral magnets, the spin states
in LIOX are chemically and optically accessible, they display strong optical
resonances with helicity-matching photons and enable spin-selective charge
transport. The static rather than dynamic polarization of spin ladders in LIOX
makes them particularly suitable for catalysis. Room-temperature spin pairing,
field-tunability, environmental robustness, and synthetic simplicity make LIOX
and its intercalates a uniquely practical family of quantum magnets.

We investigate quantum noise in a mesoscopic quantum dot serving as a
realization of the charged Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model weakly coupled to a
fermionic lead via a tunnel contact. We find noise signatures under voltage and
temperature biases that can serve as clear markers of the SYK physics in
experiments with related setups. We develop a linear response theory that
treats all types of noise on the same footing and generalizes a concept of
transport coefficients for charge and heat currents, as well as relations
between them, to equilibrium noise power. Within this theory, we find
characteristic scaling of the noise coefficients with temperature in all
regimes that can be relevant for experimental realizations of the SYK dots,
find a set of universal constants, with their values being unique to the SYK
physics, that connect these coefficients, and characterize noise manifestations
of the Coulomb blockade. Beyond SYK systems, these results may serve as a
general framework for identification of non-Fermi-liquid signatures in
mesoscopic transport and provide additional observables for experiments on
thermoelectric phenomena.

We report experimental and theoretical investigations on the quaternary
Heusler alloy CoRuTiGe, synthesized using the arc melting technique. Crystal
structure analysis reveals a tetragonal structure at room temperature.
Magnetization measurements as a function of temperature and magnetic field
indicate ferromagnetic nature with a saturation magnetization of 0.681 mB/f.u.
at 5 K. The temperature dependence of electrical resistivity shows a nearly
linear decrease in the high-temperature range, indicating the spin gapless
semiconductor like behavior of the material. This SGS nature is further
supported by the temperature-independent carrier concentration and mobility.
Hall effect analysis reveals that the anomalous Hall effect in CoRuTiGe arises
from both intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms. Additionally, a well-defined
symmetric negative magnetoresistance is observed at low temperatures. These
findings suggest that CoRuTiGe holds significant promise for spintronic
applications.

Topological invariants, rigorously defined only in the thermodynamic limit,
have been generalized to topological indicators applicable to finite-size
disordered systems. However, in many experimentally relevant situations, such
as semiconductor-superconductor (SM-SC) hybrid nanowires hosting Majorana zero
modes, the interplay between strong disorder and finite-size effects renders
these indicators (e.g., the so-called topological visibility) biased and
ill-defined, significantly limiting their usefulness. In this paper, we propose
the topological invariant rigorously defined for an infinite system constructed
by periodically repeating the original finite disordered system, as a
topological indicator. Using the one-dimensional SM-SC hybrid nanowire as an
example, we show that this general and transparent approach yields faithful
topological indicators free from the biases affecting commonly used finite-size
indicators, capturing the nature (topological or trivial) of the phase at
generic points in parameter space, and providing a reliable tool for
interpreting experimental results.

Elastic deformations couple with electronic degrees of freedom in materials
to generate gauge fields that lead to interesting transport properties.
Recently, it has been well studied that strain-induced chiral magnetic fields
in Weyl semimetals lead to interesting magnetotransport induced by the chiral
anomaly (CA). Recent studies have revealed that CA is not necessarily only a
Weyl-node property, but is rather a Fermi surface property, and is also present
in a more general class of materials, for example, in spin orbit-coupled
noncentrosymmetric metals (SOC-NCMs). The interplay of strain, CA, and charge
and thermomagnetic transport in SOC-NCMs, however, remains unexplored. Here we
resolve this gap. Using a tight-binding model for SOC-NCMs, we first
demonstrate that strain in SOC-NCMs induces anisotropy in the spin-orbit
coupling and generates an axial electric field. Then, using the quasi-classical
Boltzmann transport formalism with momentum-dependent intraband and interband
scattering processes, we show that strain in the presence of external magnetic
field can generate temperature gradients via the Nernst-Ettingshausen effect,
whose direction and behavior depends the on interplay of multiple factors: the
angle between the applied strain and magnetic field, the presence of the chiral
anomaly, the Lorentz force, and the strength of interband scattering. We
further reveal that time-reversal symmetry breaking in the presence of an
external magnetic field generates the Berry-curvature-driven anomalous
Ettingshausen effect, which is qualitatively distinct from the conventional
Lorentz-force-driven counterpart. In light of recent and forthcoming
theoretical and experimental advances in the field of SOC-NCMs, we find our
study to be particularly timely and relevant.

- **TL;DR**: Error

We introduce a machine learning framework that efficiently predicts
large-scale proximity-induced magnetism in van der Waals heterostructures,
overcoming the high computational cost of density functional theory (DFT). We
apply it to graphene/Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$, which exhibits a previously
unrecognized dichotomy. Unlike the spin polarization at the Fermi level, which
follows the pseudospin, the proximity-induced magnetic moments vary across
carbon atoms, defying analytical modeling. To address this, we develop a Random
Forest model trained on DFT data and employ Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions
descriptors to map the local ($\sim 2\,$nm$^2$) atomic-scale geometry to the
carbon magnetic moments. Besides demonstrating locality, the model reveals rich
magnetic moir\'e textures. Crucially, this method can be broadly applied to
orbital and spin proximity effects that are highly sensitive to local atomic
environments and are beyond analytical description.

We study how a weak perpendicular magnetic field $B$ and a Berry curvature
$\Omega$ modify the magnetic interactions of a two-dimensional Wigner crystal
(WC), using the semi-classical large-$r_s$ expansion. When only a magnetic
field is present, various ring-exchange interactions arise from electron
tunneling along {\it complex} trajectories, which constitute {\it complex
instanton} solutions of the coordinate-space path integral. To leading order in
$B$, each ring-exchange constant acquires an Aharonov-Bohm (AB) phase equal to
the magnetic flux enclosed by the real tunneling trajectory of the $B=0$
problem. This effect is directly relevant to two-dimensional electron systems
with a small $g$-factor ($g \ll 1$). In the presence of a Berry curvature,
multi-particle tunneling must be considered in a (complexified) phase space
$({\bf r}, {\bf k})$. To leading order in $\Omega$, the exchange constants
acquire the Berry phase enclosed by a {\it purely imaginary} trajectory in a
momentum space. Finally, when both $B$ and $\Omega$ are non-zero, in addition
to having the AB and Berry phase factors, the magnitude of the exchange
constant can also be renormalized by an effective-mass correction. These
effects may be relevant for the WC and its proximate phases recently observed
in tetra- and penta-layer rhombohedral graphene.

We report the successful growth of highly textured thin films of
(Fe,Ni)5GeTe2 two-dimensional ferromagnet on c-plane sapphire using pulsed
laser deposition. Structural characterization via X-ray diffraction confirms
preferential orientation along the (000l) direction, indicative of a high
crystallographic texture. These films of van der Waals (vdW) type interplanar
bonding exhibit robust ferromagnetism with a Curie temperature reaching = 495
K. Electrical transport measurements reveal a clear anomalous Hall effect, with
an anomalous Hall conductivity and Hall angle (%) of = 20 ohm-1cm-1 and = 0.90,
respectively. Furthermore, the magnetoresistance displays a pronounced
dependence on film thickness, highlighting the tunability of spin-dependent
transport in these vdW ferromagnetic thin films.

Carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrous oxide (N2O) both undergo profound structural
and chemical transformations when compressed. While their individual high-P/T
phase diagrams have been mapped in considerable detail, comparatively little
attention has been paid to the mixtures in which the two species can couple
through oxygen transfer, charge redistribution, and nonadiabatic dissociation
pathways. Here we use comprehensive ab initio adiabatic/nonadiabatic molecular
dynamics simulations, essentially a diabatic trajectory stitching approach,
that chart the evolution of CO-N2O mixtures from van-der-Waals fluids to
extended amorphous network solids over the range 0-160 GPa and 300-1500 K. We
emphasize on (i) the sequence of gas to molecular crystal to polymerized
amorphous solid reactive transitions that arise from an interplay between
thermal and compression effects in metastable C-N-O mixtures, (ii) the role of
N2O unimolecular dissociation in lowering the onset pressure for CO
polymerization, and (iii) the emergence of nonadiabatic pathways, via thermal
unimolecular dissociation of N2O, accompanied by spin-transition in oxygen
atoms that can make C-N-O systems deviate from Born-Oppenheimer dynamics. This
dominates the chemistry once the mixture enters the regime of bond-breaking
temperatures (T&gt;900 K).

- **TL;DR**: 一种新的样品制备和操作流程，能够在TEM中对非导电基底上的薄膜电容器进行原位偏置实验，保持原始设备架构和性能

Achieving operating conditions comparable to ``bulk'' electronic devices,
such as thin film capacitors, during \textit{operando} electron microscopy
remains challenging, particularly when devices are grown on non-conductive
substrates. Limited precision of focused ion beam milling for sample
preparation often necessitates the use of conductive substrates or artificially
thick layers that differ from actual device architectures. These modifications
can alter native strain, electrostatic boundary conditions, and ultimately
device response. Here, we present a generic and versatile workflow for
\textit{operando} biasing of thin-film capacitors in the (scanning)
transmission electron microscope, including sample fabrication and device
operation. By introducing a patterned insulating barrier adjacent to the
bulk-characterized capacitors, our approach enables sample preparation without
altering the original film structure. As a case study, we apply the method to a
piezoelectric thin-film capacitor grown on an insulating substrate, and
demonstrate that it preserves the boundary-condition-sensitive domain switching
at the atomic scale under applied electric fields. Overall, the process can
help to establish a foundation for systematic \textit{operando} studies of
complex thin-film systems under representative bulk testing geometries.

Topologically protected surface states have garnered significant attention
due to their robustness against perturbations and potential applications in
optoelectronics. Bi2 Bi2Se3 is a topological semimetal composed of a 2D
bismuthene sheet and a Bi2Se3 quintuple layer, forming an intrinsic
superlattice. This study investigates the electronic structure and edge states
of Bi2 Bi2Se3 [001] oriented films under ambient conditions through conducting
atomic force microscopy (C-AFM). Point I-V spectroscopy and current imaging are
used to characterize the surface and local transport properties of bismuthene
and Bi2Se3 terminated layers. Our measurements reveal force dependent shifts in
conduction mechanisms in both bismuthene and Bi2Se3, transitioning from direct
tunneling (DT) at low forces and low biases, to Fowler Nordheim tunneling (FNT)
at low forces and high biases, and eventually to a more ohmic like behavior at
the highest forces. Under DT conditions on the bismuthene termination, we
observed the Dirac cone in the dI/dV spectroscopy. Edge states are observed
along the perimeter of the (001) terraces for both terminations, and are
observed to have higher conductivity than the local terrace. Force-dependent
imaging revealed an increase in the width of the edge state as force increased,
until the conductive edge state appeared to cover the entire terrace.
Furthermore, terrace heights display a force dependent distortion from the high
tip forces, which indicates that the transition to the ohmic-like contact
regime on either termination results from a complex interplay between strain
and tip induced effects. All measurements were performed under ambient
conditions, which demonstrates the robustness of the topological and edge
states to ambient conditions.

### Understanding high photocatalytic activity of the TiO2 high-pressure columbite phase by experiments and first-principles calculations

The clean production of hydrogen as a zero-emission fuel can be done using
photocatalysis, with TiO2 being one of the most promising photocatalysts.
However, the activity of TiO2 anatase and rutile phases is still limited. In
this study, an oxygen-deficient high-pressure phase of TiO2, columbite, is
stabilized by a high-pressure torsion method. The phase is utilized as an
active photocatalyst for hydrogen production, and the mechanism of its high
activity is examined using density functional theory (DFT). The activity of
columbite appears to be experimentally higher than that of the anatase phase.
DFT calculations revealed that columbite does not have a narrow electronic
bandgap, but its optical bandgap and light absorbance are improved by oxygen
vacancies more significantly compared to anatase. Moreover, the water
adsorption energy is higher and the surface activation energy for water
splitting on the (101) atomic plane of columbite is lower than that for the
active planes of anatase. In conclusion, although columbite is not a
low-bandgap semiconductor, its large light absorbance and high surface
catalytic activity make it a promising candidate for photocatalytic reactions.

- **TL;DR**: 研究发现微细的结构变化会影响LuO的Hubbard参数U，这种U能量的变化对光学性质产生可检测的影响，包括Drude尾部效应和导数类贡献

To realize the significant potential of optical materials such as strongly
electron-correlated open-shell rare-earth monoxides, understanding the
electron-localization Hubbard parameters ($U$) is of central importance. The
Hubbard energy is believed to be material specific and constant. However, it
has recently been pointed out that even subtle structural changes can induce
changes in $U$ parameters. For LuO, we theoretically evaluated $U$ energy
dependence of the differential transmission and reflectivity spectra to assess
the impact of $U$ energy on the optical properties. In addition to the
conventional derivative-like contribution, we observed the influence of the
Drude tail owing to $U$-induced plasma energy modulation. Given the typical
detection sensitivity of differential spectroscopy ($\sim 1 \times 10^{-4}$),
even a few meV modulations in $U$ are sufficient for a detectable spectral
response.

Cr-doped ZnO films were fabricated by a new but feasible method, that is,
annealing Cr-Zn layers deposited via DC magnetron sputtering in air.
Microstructures of the films were investigated using X-ray diffraction,
scanning electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy, intrinsic point
defects were identified via photoluminescence spectroscopy, and optical and
dielectric properties were analyzed using a UV-vis spectrophotometer and
dielectric spectrometer, respectively. It was found that the average grain
sizes decrease (56.34 - 39.50 nm), the band gap increases (from 3.18 to 3.23
eV), and the transmittance (at 600 nm) decreases (from 91% to 83%) with
increasing Cr. Two activation energies of conduction increase after doping Cr,
indicating enhanced temperature stability. At optimal Cr levels, ZnO films
exhibit high transmittance and conductivity, exhibiting potential for
transparent electrode development. This method can be extended to other doped
ZnO films, such as Al-doped ZnO transparent electrodes, to achieve simultaneous
improvements in transmittance, conductivity, and stability for flexible and
wearable applications.

### Effects of Defects on Thermal Transport across Solid/Solid Heterogeneous Interfaces

During the fabrication of heterogeneous structures inside chips, impurities
and defects are inevitably introduced. However, the mechanism by which defects
affect interfacial heat transport remains unclear. In this work, a microscale
thermal transport model is developed by combining first-principles calculations
with Monte Carlo simulations, explicitly accounting for the effects of defects.
The effects of defect concentration and location on thermal transport
characteristics are investigated for four heterointerfaces: Si/SiC, GaN/SiC,
Si/Diamond, and GaN/Diamond. Temperature distribution, spectral thermal
conductance, average phonon scattering numbers, and interfacial thermal
conductance (ITC) are compared under different conditions. The results show
that, for Si/SiC, Si/Diamond, and GaN/Diamond interfaces, introducing defects
weakens heat transport. Higher defect concentration leads to lower ITC.
Furthermore, when defects are in SiC or Diamond, which have broader phonon
spectral distributions, their impact on ITC is weaker. For the GaN/SiC
interface, defects in GaN reduce ITC, while defects in SiC enhance ITC. At a
defect concentration of 0.05, ITC decreases by 54.1% when defects are present
in GaN, but increases by 57.2% when defects are present in SiC. This behavior
arises from defect-induced phonon energy redistribution near the interface. The
redistribution increases the population of low-frequency phonons, which are
more capable of crossing the interface, thus enhancing heat transfer. This
study enriches the fundamental understanding of thermal transport across
semiconductor heterointerfaces and guides the design and fabrication of
high-ITC heterostructures.

### Chiral Altermagnetic Second-Order Topological Phases and Sign-Reversible Transport

Chiral materials are rare in nature, yet they play a fundamental role in
modern physics due to their unconventional topological properties and transport
responses. While chiral charge and structural orders have been extensively
studied, chiral magnetic order -- particularly in altermagnets (AMs) -- remains
largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that the experimentally
well-characterized three-dimensional metal-organic framework K[Co(HCOO)$_3$]
represents the first realization of a chiral second-order topological insulator
with altermagnetic order. This system hosts $\emph{g}$-wave spin-split bands,
controllable second-order topological states, and chirality-locked anomalous
transport properties. Its second-order topological phase manifests as
alternating spin-up and spin-down hinge modes along the boundaries of hexagonal
nanotubes. Remarkably, these spin-polarized hinge states can be switched
through lattice chiral inversion. Simultaneously, the anomalous Hall effect and
magneto-optical effects exhibit reversed signs in left/right-handed
enantiomers, substantiating a universal chirality-controlled response across
both electronic and optical channels. Our results establish chiral AMs as a
promising platform for non-volatile topological spintronics, opening new
avenues for manipulating quantum transport via lattice chirality.

- **TL;DR**: 本文揭示了Mn/Re(0001)系统中三重Q态与行式反铁磁态之间的低温相变，证明该相变由熵驱动，且适用于广泛的磁性相互作用参数范围

The triple-Q state arises due to the superposition of three symmetry
equivalent spin spirals stabilized by higher-order exchange interactions. It
has been predicted more than 20 years ago but was only recently discovered in a
Mn monolayer on the Re(0001) surface. To date little is known about the
thermodynamic properties of this intriguing non-coplanar spin state. Here, we
reveal a low-temperature phase transition between the triple-Q and the row-wise
antiferromagnetic state in this system via Monte Carlo simulations based on an
atomistic spin model parametrized by density functional theory. By modeling the
free energy landscape in terms of thermal excitations we derive an analytical
expression of the partition function, which allows us to prove that the phase
transition is driven by entropy. The predicted phase transition is not unique
to Mn/Re(0001) but appears for a wide range of magnetic interaction parameters
and is expected to occur also for other multi-Q states.

Reports of photoluminescence from GeSn grown on Ge substrates by molecular
beam epitaxy have been limited. We find that one limiting factor to observing
photoluminescence is due to localized defect states marked by photoluminescence
at 2400 nm and originating from the Ge substrate and buffer layer. In this
study, we report on an optical study utilizing doped Ge(001) substrates to
effectively suppress defect-related photoluminescence in GeSn layers by filling
localized defect trap states. For this experiment, a GeSn layer with Sn content
up to 10.5% was grown on a doped Ge(001) substrate. Analysis of the physics of
the photoluminescence spectrum collected from the GeSn thin film shows an
emission at the expected wavelength of 2300 nm for 10.5% Sn content and the
absence of the typically observed defect related signal at 2400 nm. This
understanding is further confirmed using short pulse optical excitation of the
GeSn grown on undoped Ge substrates.
