- **TL;DR**: 本研究通过3D打印技术将Bi₄O₅I₂光催化剂固定在赤铁矿支架上，构建了可重复使用的复合光催化材料，用于高效降解甲酚类污染物，并降低了生态毒性。

In photocatalysis, the reusability limit of catalysts can contribute to
secondary pollution, posing ecological risks. Addressing this, the present
study explores the integration of additive manufacturing with photocatalysis by
decorating Bi$_4$O$_5$I$_2$ onto a 3D-printed hematite scaffold
(Bi$_4$O$_5$I$_2$@3DH) for the degradation of cresols. The 3D-printed hematite
grid, fabricated via direct ink writing, exhibited excellent rheological
behavior ($\tau\gamma = 24$ Pa), allowing precise shape retention. The sintered
Bi$_4$O$_5$I$_2$ was subsequently immobilized via a facile dip-coating method.
Under optimized conditions, the composite achieved 99.78\% degradation of 20
mg/L p-cresol within 240 min of irradiation. Notably, hematite served as a
porous substrate and contributed to photocatalytic activity. Density functional
theory simulations with Hubbard correction (DFT+U) indicated an interfacial
charge transfer of approximately -0.9 electrons from hematite to
Bi$_4$O$_5$I$_2$, confirming a S-scheme heterojunction between hematite and
Bi$_4$O$_5$I$_2$ semiconductors, validating experimental observations. The
composite demonstrated strong performance across varied water matrices and in
the presence of other cresol isomers. It also retained 84.28\% degradation
efficiency after 10 cycles, with negligible catalyst leaching. Furthermore, in
vitro and in silico ecotoxicity analyses revealed reduced toxicity of the
degradation products. The current work presents a novel and scalable strategy,
advancing the use of earth-abundant hematite minerals in sustainable
environmental remediation.

### Enhanced Prediction of CO2 Solubility under Geological Conditions for CCUS via Improved Pitzer Parameters and Physics-Informed Machine Learning

- **TL;DR**: 该论文研究了CO2在地层咸水中的溶解度，通过改进Pitzer参数和物理信息机器学习模型，显著提高了模拟准确性，支持碳捕获与存储技术的可靠设计。

The solubility of CO2 in formation brines plays a critical role in the
efficiency of carbon capture and storage (CCS) operations. It is strongly
influenced by pressure, temperature, and brine composition. Various
experimental studies and modeling approaches have been developed to estimate
CO2 solubility under wide ranges of pressure, temperature, and salinities. This
work makes three key contributions. First, we present an extensive literature
review of experimental, theoretical, and simulation-based approaches for
measuring and predicting CO2 solubility across a wide range of conditions and
also a discussion of how the different parameters affect solubility. Second, we
introduce an improved set of temperature-dependent Pitzer interaction
parameters, yielding up to a 76% reduction in average absolute deviation
compared to conventional values in the geochemical simulation software PHREEQC.
Third, we develop a physics-informed machine learning model that integrates
thermodynamic intuition with data-driven learning, achieving a 14% reduction in
prediction error over the state-of-the-art and up to 40% improvement at high
salinities. Together, these advances provide a robust and accurate framework
for predicting CO2 solubility, supporting more reliable CCS design and
deployment.

- **TL;DR**: 使用机器学习潜能和局部相关近似方法，实现了可废的CCSD(T)级液态水模拟，包括常压模拟和核量子效应，与实验数据高度一致

Simulating liquid water to an accuracy that matches its wealth of available
experimental data requires both precise electronic structure methods and
reliable sampling of nuclear (quantum) motion. This is challenging because
applying the electronic structure method of choice - coupled cluster theory
with single, double and perturbative triple excitations [CCSD(T)] - to
condensed phase systems is currently limited by its computational cost and
complexity. Recent tour-de-force efforts have demonstrated that this accuracy
can indeed bring simulated liquid water into close agreement with experiment
using machine learning potentials (MLPs). However, achieving this remains far
from routine, requiring large datasets and significant computational cost. In
this work, we introduce a practical approach that combines developments in MLPs
with local correlation approximations to enable routine CCSD(T)-level
simulations of liquid water. When combined with nuclear quantum effects, we
achieve agreement to experiments for structural and transport properties.
Crucially, this approach extends beyond constant volume to constant pressure
simulations, allowing fundamental properties such as the density to now be
predicted by MLP-based CCSD(T) models. Importantly, the approach also handles
constant pressure simulations, enabling MLP-based CCSD(T) models to predict
isothermal-isobaric bulk properties, such as water's density maximum in close
agreement with experiment. Encompassing tests across electronic structure,
datasets and MLP architecture, this work provides a practical blueprint towards
routinely developing CCSD(T)-based MLPs for the condensed phase.

- **TL;DR**: GSCDB138是一个包含138个数据集（8383个条目）的严格筛选基准库，涵盖主族和过渡金属反应能垒、非共价相互作用、偶极矩、极化率、电场响应能和振动频率等性质。更新了GMTKN55和MGCDB84的数据，测试了29种流行密度泛函，发现r2SCAN-D4在频率计算中可与杂化泛函媲美，ωB97M-V和ωB97X-V表现最佳。

We present GSCDB138, a rigorously curated benchmark library of 138 data sets
(8383 entries) covering main-group and transition-metal reaction energies and
barrier heights, non-covalent interactions, dipole moments, polarizabilities,
electric-field response energies, and vibrational frequencies. Legacy data from
GMTKN55 and MGCDB84 have been updated to today's best reference values;
redundant, spincontaminated, or low-quality points were removed, and many new,
property-focused sets were added. Testing 29 popular density-functional
approximations shows the expected Jacob's-ladder hierarchy overall, yet reveals
interesting exceptions: r2SCAN-D4 (meta-GGA) rivals hybrids for frequencies,
and electric-field errors correlate poorly with ground-state energetics.
{\omega}B97M-V and {\omega}B97X-V are the most balanced hybrid meta-GGA and
hybrid GGA, respectively; B97M-V and revPBE-D4 lead the metaGGA and GGA
classes. Double hybrids lower mean errors by about 25 % versus the best hybrids
but demand careful frozen-core, basis-set, and multi-reference treatment.
GSCDB138 offers a comprehensive, openly documented platform for stringent DFA
validation and for training the next generation of non-empirical and
machine-learned functionals.

### When Does a Single Repulsive Dirac Cone Superconduct?

- **TL;DR**: 研究许多维迪克雷锥中的超导性，发现线性迪克锥在短程排斥作用下无法在一阶对应形成超导，而需要高阶散射修正。超导对称性受到迪克锥在算法实现中如何突破限制的影响。不同的迪克锥来源导致不同的拓扑超导相，包括p-ip和(d±id)×(p+ip)等复杂对称性。

Superconductivity in a single two-dimensional Dirac cone offers a natural
route to topological superconductivity. While usually considered extrinsic --
arising from proximity to a conventional superconductor -- we investigate when
a doped Dirac cone can spontaneously develop superconductivity from a
short-range repulsive interaction $U$ via the Kohn--Luttinger mechanism. We
show that an ideal, linear Dirac cone is immune to pairing at leading order in
$U^2$. Superconductivity instead emerges only through higher-order in $k$
corrections to the dispersion, which are unavoidable in any lattice realization
and crucially dictate the pairing symmetry. The form of the pairing thus
reflects how the well-known obstruction to realizing a single Dirac cone on a
lattice is circumvented. When a Dirac cone arises from broken time-reversal
symmetry -- for instance, at a transition between Chern insulators or in a
valley-polarized phase -- we find a topological $p - ip$ state whose chirality
is opposite to that of the parent chiral metal above $T_c$. By contrast, for a
surface Dirac cone of a 3D topological insulator, superconductivity is
stabilized by anisotropies in the dispersion. For $C_{3v}$-symmetric warping,
as in $\mathrm{Bi}_{2}\mathrm{Te}_{3}$, pairing is strongest when the Fermi
surface becomes hexagonal, leading to order in the $(d \pm id)\times(p+ip)$
channel with accidental near-nodes. In the highly anisotropic limit $v_x \gg
v_y$, relevant to side surfaces of layered materials, the Fermi surface splits
into two branches, and nesting favors a pairing symmetry $\Delta \sim
\mathrm{sgn}(k_x)\cos(k_y)$ reminiscent of organic superconductors.

### Metastability in the parallel Ising model

- **TL;DR**: 本文研究了伊辛模型并行蒙特卡洛实现中的对称性破缺问题，发现在某些情况下并行版本在低温相中不会出现对称性破缺现象，并提出了通过引入小异步性来恢复标准铁磁分布的方法。

In this short paper we present some considerations about some parallel
implementations of the dynamic (Monte Carlo) version of the Ising model. In
some cases the equilibrium distribution of the parallel version does not
present the symmetry breaking phenomenon in the low-temperature phase, i.e.,
the stochastic trajectory originated by the Monte Carlo simulation can jump
between the distributions corresponding to both kinds of magnetization, or the
lattice can break into two disjoint sublattices, each of which goes into a
different asymptotic distribution. In this latter case, by introducing a small
asynchronism, we can have a transition towards the standard ferromagnetic (or
antiferromagnetic) distribution, with metastable transients.

### Very High-order Compact Gas-kinetic Scheme With Discontinuity Feedback Factor

- **TL;DR**: 高效稳健的高阶压缩流模拟方法，结合紧凑气体动力学方案和自适应架构重建，解决了传统高阶方法的稳健性和计算效率问题

This paper presents a robust and efficient very high-order scheme for
compressible flow simulation, addressing critical limitations of existing
high-order methods. The proposed scheme combines the compact gas-kinetic scheme
(CGKS) with an adaptive stencil extension reconstruction with discontinuity
feedback factor (ASE-DFF), achieving significant improvements in both
robustness and computational efficiency. Traditional weighted essentially
non-oscillatory (WENO) schemes suffer from reduced robustness at higher order
and require costly smoothness indicators for large stencils. Meanwhile, compact
methods based on Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) and Flux Reconstruction (FR)
struggle with poor time-marching efficiency. In contrast, the ASE-DFF-CGKS
introduces two key innovations: (1) a unified framework enabling arbitrarily
high-order compact gas-kinetic scheme without sacrificing large CFL number, and
(2) a discontinuity feedback factor that eliminates the need for expensive
smoothness indicator calculations while essentially keeping first-order
robustness near discontinuities. The scheme's advantages are demonstrated
through benchmark simulations. It maintains a CFL number above 0.5 for up to
9th-order case, unlike conventional compact methods that restrict a CFL less
than 0.05. Also it delivers high-resolution results for flow involving strong
shock and rarefaction wave. This work provides a practically impactful solution
for high-fidelity compressible flow simulation, balancing computational
efficiency, high-order accuracy and robustness in challenging flow regimes.

We report fast atom diffraction through single-layer graphene using hydrogen
atoms at kinetic energies from 150 to 1200 eV. High-resolution images reveal
overlapping hexagonal patterns from coexisting monocrystalline domains.
Time-of-flight tagging confirms negligible energy loss, making the method
suitable for matter-wave interferometry. The diffraction is well described by
the eikonal approximation, with accurate modeling requiring the full 3D
interaction potential from DFT. Simpler models fail to reproduce the data,
highlighting the exceptional sensitivity of diffraction patterns to
atom-surface interactions and their potential for spectroscopic applications.

### Engineering Hubbard models with gated two-dimensional moiré systems

Lattice models are powerful tools for studying strongly correlated quantum
many-body systems, but their general lack of exact solutions motivates efforts
to simulate them in tunable platforms. Recently, a promising new candidate has
emerged for such platforms from two-dimensional materials. A subset of moir\'e
systems can be effectively described as a two-dimensional electron gas (2D EG)
subject to a moir\'e potential, with electron-electron interactions screened by
nearby metallic gates. In this paper, we investigate the realization of lattice
models in such systems. We show that, by controlling the gate separation, a 2D
EG in a square moir\'e potential can be systematically tuned into a system
whose ground state exhibits orders analogous to those of the square lattice
Hubbard model, including the stripe phase. Furthermore, we study how variations
in gate separation and moir\'e potential depth affect the ground-state orders.
A number of antiferromagnetic phases, as well as a ferromagnetic phase and a
paramagnetic phase, are identified. We then apply our quantitative downfolding
approach to triangular moir\'e systems closer to current experimental
conditions, compare them with the square lattice parameters studied, and
outline routes for experimental realization of the phases.

- **TL;DR**: 生成式AI正在变革MOF材料的设计发现方式，从传统枚举转向AI自主生成新型多孔网状结构，结合高通量筛选和自动化实验形成闭环发现流程

Advances in generative artificial intelligence are transforming how
metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are designed and discovered. This Perspective
introduces the shift from laborious enumeration of MOF candidates to generative
approaches that can autonomously propose and synthesize in the laboratory new
porous reticular structures on demand. We outline the progress of employing
deep learning models, such as variational autoencoders, diffusion models, and
large language model-based agents, that are fueled by the growing amount of
available data from the MOF community and suggest novel crystalline materials
designs. These generative tools can be combined with high-throughput
computational screening and even automated experiments to form accelerated,
closed-loop discovery pipelines. The result is a new paradigm for reticular
chemistry in which AI algorithms more efficiently direct the search for
high-performance MOF materials for clean air and energy applications. Finally,
we highlight remaining challenges such as synthetic feasibility, dataset
diversity, and the need for further integration of domain knowledge.

### Diffuse-Layer Capacitance at the Potential of Zero Charge in Binary Mixtures

- **TL;DR**: 二元混合物中电双层电容理论研究，推导出零电势下滿水层电容的分析解，发现能够预测表面不稳定性和较大偏离单液体近似的情况

The capacitance of the electric double layer has potential applications in
supercapacitors, and theoretical investigations of the double-layer capacitance
in binary mixtures are important. In this work, we develop the theory of the
electric double layer in binary mixtures, and the diffuse-layer capacitance at
the potential of zero charge is obtained analytically. Furthermore, we observe
a divergence of the capacitance in the phase diagram, suggesting a surface
instability. The obtained capacitance is different from that derived using
single-liquid approximation unless the preferential solvation energies of
cations and anions are the same. When the system is close to the surface
instability line, the capacitance strongly deviates from the results of
single-liquid approximation.

### Persistence of charge density wave fluctuations in the absence of long-range order in a hole-doped kagome metal

- **TL;DR**: 通过超快聚焦声子光谱技术研究正孔污染CsV3Sb5-xSnx中的光子密度波波动，发现在长程光子密度波正序消失后仍存在强劲的波动现象，这些波动在超导相边界附近强化，可能与超导性相互作用。

The kagome metals $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A$ = K, Rb, Cs) exhibit a complex
interplay between charge density wave (CDW) order and superconductivity. In
this study, we use ultrafast coherent phonon spectroscopy to probe the
evolution of CDW order in hole-doped CsV$_3$Sb$_{5-x}$Sn$_x$ across a broad
range of compositions ($0 \leq x \leq 0.68$). While thermodynamic and
diffraction measurements show long-range CDW order vanishes above $x \approx
0.05$, we observe persistent signatures of CDW fluctuations up to the highest
doping levels, with correlation times on the order of several picoseconds.
These results indicate the presence of robust fluctuating charge order that
survives well beyond the established CDW phase boundary. Furthermore, these
fluctuations are enhanced near a doping-tuned quantum phase transition at $x^*
\approx 0.15$, which coincides with a local minimum in the superconducting
$T_\mathrm{c}$ double-dome. Additional measurements on Ti- and K-substituted
samples confirm that this behavior is intrinsic to hole doping and not tied to
disorder. Overall, our findings suggest that CDW fluctuations play a central
role in the electronic phase diagram of $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ and may mediate or
compete with superconductivity.

### Central Limit Behavior at the Edge of Chaos in the z-Logistic Map

- **TL;DR**: 本文研究了耗散一维z-logistic映射在Feigenbaum-Coullet-Tresser点处的行为，发现迭代和收敛到q高斯分布，该分布在简单约束下优化非可加熵函数Sq。

We focus on the FeigenbaumCoulletTresser point of the dissipative
one-dimensional z logistic map. We show that sums of iterates converge to q
Gaussian distributions, which optimize the nonadditive entropic functional Sq
under simple constraints. We derive a closedform prediction for the entropic
index, and validate it numerically via data collapse for typical z values. The
formula captures how the limiting law depends on the nonlinearity order and
implies finite variance for z larger than 2 and divergent variance for z in
between 1 and 2. These results extend edge of chaos central limit behavior
beyond the standard case and provide a simple predictive law for unimodal maps
with varying maximum order.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文在纳米线基底的Andreev分子中观察到了素元素不可逆的超导体二极管效应，通过非局域相互作用实现了对该效应的远程调控

Superconducting systems exhibit non-reciprocal current transport under
certain conditions of symmetry breaking, a phenomenon known as the
superconducting diode effect. This effect allows for perfect rectification of
supercurrent, and has received considerable research interest. We report the
observation of the Josephson diode effect (JDE) in nanowire-based Andreev
molecules, where the time-reversal and spatial-inversion symmetries of a
Josephson junction (JJ) can be nonlocally broken by coherently coupling to
another JJ. The JDE can be controlled using both non-local phase and gate
voltages. Notably, the non-local phase can induce a sign reversal of the diode
efficiency, a manifestation of regulating the probabilities of double elastic
cotunneling and double-crossed Andreev reflection. Additionally, the diode
efficiency can be further modulated by local and non-local gate voltages,
exhibiting a central-peak feature in the gate-voltage space. Our theoretical
calculations of the energy spectrum and the Josephson currents align well with
the experimental results. These results demonstrate the non-local regulation of
the JDE in Andreev molecules, offering significant implications for the control
of multi-JJ devices and the development of advanced superconducting devices.

The low-temperature electronic and magnetic properties of NH$_4$V$_2$O$_5$,
an isoelectronic analog of the spin-ladder compound $\alpha'$-NaV$_2$O$_5$, are
investigated using DFT+$U$ calculations. Two charge-ordering patterns - zigzag
and linear chains of V$^{4+}$/V$^{5+}$ ions - are considered. The zigzag
configuration is found to be energetically preferred and exhibits insulating
behavior with a band gap of 1.7 eV. In this state, magnetic V$^{4+}$ (d$^1$)
ions form antiferromagnetically coupled spin chains. Calculated exchange
interactions reveal strong diagonal (intrarung) and interladder couplings,
indicating a complex spin-ladder network. These results suggest that
NH$_4$V$_2$O$_5$ retains essential spin-ladder characteristics while displaying
new structural and magnetic features arising from the larger size and
non-spherical geometry of the NH$_4^+$ ion compared to Na$^+$.

A one-step synthesis of Ca$_x$Zn$_{1-x}$Fe$_2$O$_4$ (x=0, 0.5 and 1)
nanoferrites and nanocomposites by the glycol-thermal method is reported. The
structural, morphological and magnetic properties were studied using XRD,
HRTEM, HRSEM, Mossbauer spectroscopy and VSM. The XRD patterns show a single
phase cubic spinel structure for x=0. A composite phase of a spinel and
hematite-like structure was observed for x=0.5, and for x=1, CaFe$_2$O$_4$ has
the same structure as hematite. The superparamagnetic nature of the samples was
confirmed from the Mossbauer and magnetization results.

### Statistical-Mechanical Theory on the Probability Distribution Function for the Net Charge of an Electrolyte Droplet

Droplets of electrolyte solutions in an insulating medium are ubiquitous in
nature. The net charges of these droplets are normally nonzero, and they
fluctuate. However, a theory on the probability distribution function for the
net charge of droplets is lacking, so far. Thus, a statistical-mechanical
theory of a charged droplet is developed with including the effect of the
electrostatic energy of charging as well as the random distribution of ions.
Then, the probability distribution function for the net charge of an
electrolyte droplet is calculated assuming that it is generated from a
macroscopic solution with the different cation and anion concentrations. Using

We investigate the numerical behavior of the Eliashberg equations for
phonon-mediated superconductivity, incorporating normal-state self-energy
calculations within the consistent $GW_{0}$ approximation. We account for the
full wavenumber and frequency dependences of both the screened Coulomb
interaction and phonon-mediated attraction. We present results for the
prototypical uniform electron gas system with model Einstein phonons at
temperatures of a few kelvin. At extremely low temperatures, we efficiently
execute the required convolutions of Green's functions and interactions in
Matsubara frequency and wavenumber using intermediate representation and
Fourier convolution techniques. In particular, we elucidate the interplay
between electron-phonon $\omega$-mass and $k$-mass renormalizations of the
electronic self-energy in determining the normal-state effective mass, spectral
weight and the superconducting transition temperature. The electron density
regimes where the plasmon effect enhances or suppresses the phonon-mediated
superconductivity on top of the static Coulomb effect are revealed. We compare
our comprehensive Eliashberg calculation results with those from density
functional theory for superconductors, where the functionals have been
constructed with reference to Eliashberg theory. Our model, methods, and
results provide a valuable benchmark for first-principles superconducting
calculations that treat screened Coulomb interaction effects non-empirically.

- **TL;DR**: 本文提出了一个基于(q,δ)-代数的统一统计力学框架，用于处理不同类型的复杂系统，包括长程关联系统、黑洞等宇宙学现象。

A $N$-body system is simple if all associated physically relevant space-time
correlations are short-ranged, meaning that their momenta of all orders are
finite. Such systems typically have a total number $W$ of admissible
microscopic configurations which grows with $N$ as $W(N) \sim \mu^N\;(\mu &gt;1,
\, N\to\infty)$. Their thermostatistical properties are known to be
satisfactorily handled within Boltzmann-Gibbs (BG) statistical mechanics. In
contrast, a system is complex if one or more associated correlations are
long-ranged. The simplest examples of such systems are those for which $W(N)
\sim N^\rho\;\;(\rho&gt;0)$. A generalized statistical mechanics grounded on the
nonadditive entropic functional $S_q(\{p_{i}\})=k\sum_{i=1}^W p_i \ln_q
\frac{1}{p_i} \;\;(q\in \mathbb{R}, \;S_1=S_{BG})$ with $\ln_q z
=\frac{z^{1-q}-1}{1-q}$ ($\ln_1 z=\ln z$) satisfactorily handles such systems.
Indeed, for equiprobabilities, $S_{q=1-1/\rho}(\{1/W(N)\})=k\ln_{1-1/\rho} W(N)
\propto N$. Furthermore, for complex systems, the size of the corresponding
phase spaces can be related to the property $\ln_q (x\otimes_q y) =\ln_q x +
\ln_q y$, $x,y\geq1$, $q\leq 1$, where $x\otimes_q
y=[x^{1-q}+y^{1-q}-1]^{\frac{1}{1-q}}_{+}\;\;(x\otimes_1 y=xy)$, and the
$q$-product $\otimes_q$ grounds the definition of a $q$-generalized algebra.
Another class of complex systems corresponds to $W(N) \sim
\nu^{N^\gamma}\;\;(\nu &gt;1, \,\gamma &gt; 0)$, which appears to be the case of
black holes and other cosmological phenomena. This class can be handled with
$S_\delta(\{p_{i}\}) = k\sum_{i=1}^W p_i \Bigl(\ln \frac{1}{p_i} \Bigr)^\delta
\;\;(\delta&gt;0)$. Finally, we can define $S_{q,\delta}(\{p_{i}\})=k\sum_{i=1}^W
p_i \Bigl(\ln_q \frac{1}{p_i} \Bigr)^\delta$ $(q\in\mathbb{R},\delta&gt;0)$, which
unifies all the above ones. In this paper, we generalize the $q$-algebra to a
new, promising one, namely the $(q,\delta)$-algebra.

- **TL;DR**: 构建了一种电子全平带(ABF)梯子结构，通过实验在其中产生紧凑局域化状态(CLSs)，并与紧绑预测获得良好一致

We construct an electronic all-bands-flat (ABF) lattice and experimentally
generate compact localized states (CLSs) therein. The lattice is a diamond
(rhombic) chain and implemented as a network of capacitors and inductors, as
well as voltage inverters (using operational amplifiers) in order to introduce
a \(\pi\)-phase flux within each diamond. The network's normal modes split into
three flat bands, and the corresponding CLSs can be excited in isolation via a
two-node driving at the flat band frequencies. We also examine the role of the
lattice edges and their interaction with the CLSs. Finally, we compare the
experimental results to tight-binding predictions and obtain very good
agreement. This analysis paves the way for further experimental implementations
of ABF systems in electric networks, especially with an eye towards exploring
their interplay with nonlinearity.

We present an extended model to describe the spin-lattice coupling,
incorporating individual vibrations of bonds and atomic sites alongside
distance-dependent exchange interactions. The proposed spin Hamiltonian can be
effectively considered as an interpolation between two well-established minimum
models, the bond-phonon model and the site-phonon model. The extended model
well reproduces successive field-induced phase transitions as well as the
thermodynamic properties of a 3-up-1-down state in the pyrochlore-lattice
Heisenberg antiferromagnet, including negative thermal expansion, an enhanced
magnetocaloric effect, and a sharp specific-heat peak. Our approach is broadly
applicable to various spin models, providing a framework for identifying the
primary phonon modes responsible for spin-lattice coupling and for
understanding complex magnetic phase diagrams.

Single-phase Mg-doped ZnFe$_2$O$_4$ nanoparticles with x= 0, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7
have been prepared by the glycol-thermal method without any subsequent
calcination. The crystallite size, microstructure and magnetic properties of
the prepared nanoparticles were studied using X-ray diffraction (XRD), high
resolution scanning electron microscope (TEM), Mossbauer spectroscopy and
vibrating sample magnetometer at room temperature. The XRD results revealed the
production of a sharp single cubic spinel structure in all the synthesized
samples without any impurity peak with the average crystallite size of about
19-28 nm. It was noticed that the lattice parameter varies as the Mg$^{2+}$ ion
concentration increases. 57 Mossbauer measurement showed that the nano ferrites
exhibit ferrimagnetic and superparamagnetic states. Magnetization measurements
confirmed the superparamagnetic behaviour of the samples. The highest
coercivity and saturation magnetization were observed at x=0.3. The saturation
magnetization (MS) decreases while coercivity (HC) varies with an increase in
the concentration of Mg$^{2+}$ ion.

Hydrophobic interfaces have unique physicochemical properties and are used in
various chemical products such as food, cosmetics, soap, and medicine and
technologies such as pan coating and ski wax. In this chapter, we describe the
fundamental concept of hydrophobic interfaces and explain their ion adsorption
and zeta potential by using experimental data from the literature. Thus far,
these electrical properties are considered universal for solid/water,
liquid/water, and gas/water interfaces; however, a careful comparison in this
chapter will reveal significant differences among them. To confirm that the
affinity of H$^+$ ions for all hydrophobic interfaces is stronger than that of
OH$^-$ ions, more experimental data on hydrophobic liquid/water and solid/water
interfaces are required.

We demonstrate the realization and interplay of two ferromagnetic resonances
in the SFS $\varphi_0$ Josephson junction. One of the resonances that is
realized under microwave radiation is the famous Kittel ferromagnetic
resonance. The other is the Buzdin ferromagnetic resonance appearing as a
result of interaction of superconducting current and ferromagnetic interlayer
magnetization. Transformations of one type of resonance to another under
variation in the parameters of external radiation and the parameters of the
$\varphi_0$ junction open the way to manipulation of the features of
ferromagnetic resonances. The combined ferromagnetic resonance that exhibits
the features of both resonances is demonstrated too. The 2D-diagrams
$\omega_R-I$ for the maximal magnetization component $m_y$ have an interesting
intersection points of the Kittel and Buzdin resonances, where the value of
$m^{max}_y$ is strongly increased. The obtained results demonstrate reach
physics and unique opportunities for various applications.

### Fiber bundle model of thermally activated creep failure

An equal load sharing fiber bundle model for thermally activated breakdown is
developed using transition state theory to describe the rate of elementary
failures. The lifetime distribution, average, variance and their asymptotic
limits for uniform fiber failure thresholds are derived and found to be in
excellent agreement with simulations. The asymptotic scaling with regards to
the number of fibers matches analytical approximations in the low temperature
limit derived by Roux and co-workers for a model of thermal breakdown by
stationary Gaussian noise. For the case of randomly distributed fiber failure
strengths, the lifetime distribution is derived as a multidimensional integral
with no closed form solution. Simulations with different fiber strength
distributions indicate that, in the limit of large fiber numbers, the
statistics of bundle lifetimes shows a similar asymptotic scaling for
distributed and for uniform thresholds. Fiber breakage by thermal activation
occurs in avalanches triggered by individual thermally activated failure
events, and the asymptotic avalanche size distribution obtained from the
simulations matches earlier theoretical results derived for quasistatic
loading.

Fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) containing negatively charged
nitrogen-vacancy (NV-) centers are vital for many emerging quantum sensing
applications from magnetometry to intracellular sensing in biology. However,
developing a scalable fabrication method for FNDs hosting color centers with
consistent bulk-like photoluminescence (PL) and spin coherence properties
remains a highly desired but unrealized goal. Here, we investigate optimized
ball milling of single-crystal diamonds produced via chemical vapor deposition
(CVD) and containing 2 ppm of substitutional nitrogen and 0.3 ppm of NV- to
achieve this goal. The NV charge state, PL lifetime, and spin properties of
bulk CVD diamond samples are directly compared to milled CVD FNDs and
commercial high-pressure high-temperature (HPHT) FNDs. We find that on average,
the relative contribution of the NV- charge state to the total NV PL is lower
and the NV PL lifetime is longer in CVD FNDs compared to HPHT FNDs, both likely
due to the lower Ns0 concentration in CVD FNDs. The CVD bulk and CVD FNDs on
average show similar average T1 spin relaxation times of 3.2 $\pm$ 0.7 ms and
4.7 $\pm$ 1.6 ms, respectively, compared to 0.17 $\pm$ 0.01 ms for commercial
HPHT FNDs. Our results demonstrate that ball milling of CVD diamonds enables
the large-scale fabrication of NV ensembles in FNDs with bulk-like T1 spin
relaxation properties.

### Chiral Phonons in a Cubic Lattice

We have developed a theory for the energy dispersion of chiral phonons in a
simplest cubic lattice. Among all the phonon modes, only the optical triplet
modes exhibit the intrinsic characteristics of chiral phonons near k=0, and we
examine their energy splitting in detail by analyzing the dynamical matrix. To
first order in k, the splitting is described by a spin-1 Weyl Hamiltonian, and
helicity becomes a good quantum number. It asymptotically coincides with the
crystal angular momentum for k parallel &lt;111&gt; up to a global sign. The
Hamiltonian incorporates a pseudoscalar coupling constant associated with
electric toroidal monopoles, determined by the spatial configuration of the
stiffness tensors.

The quest for energy-efficient, scalable neuromorphic computing has elevated
compute-in-memory (CIM) architectures to the forefront of hardware innovation.
While memristive memories have been extensively explored for synaptic
implementation in CIM architectures, their inherent limitations, including
static power dissipation, sneak-path currents, and interconnect voltage drops,
pose significant challenges for large-scale deployment, particularly at
advanced technology nodes. In contrast, capacitive memories offer a compelling
alternative by enabling charge-domain computation with virtually zero static
power loss, intrinsic immunity to sneak paths, and simplified selector-less
crossbar operation, while offering superior compatibility with 3D
Back-end-of-Line (BEOL) integration. This perspective highlights the
architectural and device-level advantages of emerging non-volatile capacitive
synapses. We examine how material engineering and interface control can
modulate synaptic behavior, capacitive memory window and multilevel analog
storage potential. Furthermore, we explore critical system-level trade-offs
involving device-to-device variation, charge transfer noise, dynamic range, and
effective analog resolution.

### A particle view of many-body electronic structure with neural network wavefunction

- **TL;DR**: 开发了周期性动态Voronoi Metropolis采样方法，从神经网络波函数中提取经典多体电子构型，结合价键理论构建粒子视角范式，用于分析分子和固体中的多体电子结构

In the study of electronic structure, the wavefunction view dominates the
current research landscape and forms the theoretical foundation of modern
quantum mechanics. In contrast, Valence Bond (VB) theory represents chemical
bonds as shared electron-pairs and can provide an intuitive, particle-based
insight into chemical bonding. In this work, using a newly developed Periodic
Dynamic Voronoi Metropolis Sampling (PDVMS) method, we project classical
many-body electronic configurations from the neural network wavefunction, and
apply VB theory to construct a complementary particle-view paradigm. The
powerful neural network wavefunction can achieve near-exact ab initio solutions
for the ground state of both molecular and solid systems. It allows us to
definitively characterize the ground state of benzene by reassessing the
competition between its two VB structures. Extending PDVMS to solids for the
first time, we also predict a spin-staggered VB structure in graphene, which
explains emergent magnetic properties in graphene-based nanostructures.
Furthermore, this particle view provides insight into the optimization process
of the neural network wavefunction itself. Our work thus introduces a novel
framework for analyzing many-body electronic structure in molecules and solids,
opening new avenues for investigating this complex problem and its associated
exotic phenomena.

Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy is a powerful experimental
technique for studying anisotropic many-body interactions through the electron
spectral function. Existing attempts to decompose the spectral function into
non-interacting dispersions and electron-phonon, electron-electron, and
electron-impurity self-energies rely on linearization of the bands and manual
assignment of self-energy magnitudes. Here, we show how self-energies can be
extracted consistently for curved dispersions. We extend the maximum-entropy
method to Eliashberg-function extraction with Bayesian inference, optimizing
the parameters describing the dispersions and the magnitudes of
electron-electron and electron-impurity interactions. We compare these novel
methodologies with state-of-the-art approaches on model data, then demonstrate
their applicability with two high-quality experimental data sets. With the
first set, we identify the phonon modes of a two-dimensional electron liquid on
TiO$_2$-terminated SrTiO$_3$. With the second set, we obtain unprecedented
agreement between two Eliashberg functions of Li-doped graphene extracted from
separate dispersions. We release these functionalities in the novel Python code
\textsc{xARPES}.

- **TL;DR**: 重新研究一维Ising模型的量子假真空衰变，通过矩阵乘积状态模拟发现三个阶段的真空气泡形成和成长过程，并验证了Rutkevich的衰变率分析结果

We revisit quantum false vacuum decay for the one-dimensional Ising model,
focusing on the real-time nucleation and growth of true vacuum bubbles. Via
matrix product state simulations, we demonstrate that for a wide range of
parameters, the full time-dependent quantum state is well described by a
Gaussian ansatz in terms of domain wall operators, with the associated vacuum
bubble wave function evolving according to the linearized time-dependent
variational principle. The emerging picture shows three different stages of
evolution: an initial nucleation of small bubbles, followed by semi-classical
bubble growth, which in turn is halted by the lattice phenomenon of Bloch
oscillations. Furthermore, we find that the resonant bubble only plays a
significant role in a certain region of parameter-space. However, when
significant, it does lead to an approximately constant decay rate during the
intermediate stage. Moreover, this rate is in quantitative agreement with the
analytical result of Rutkevich (Phys. Rev. B 60, 14525) for which we provide an
independent derivation based on the Gaussian ansatz.

Monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides, such as WSe$_2$, are direct gap,
multi-valley semiconductors. Long-range electron-hole exchange interactions mix
the valleys, yielding dispersion relations for massive ($\propto Q^2$) as well
as light-like ($\propto Q$) excitons. We report magneto-photoluminescence
spectroscopy of excitons in the monolayer semiconductor WSe$_2$ to $B =
\pm25$T. The magnetic field-dependent line shape of the neutral exciton reveals
the emergence of a new blue-detuned emission peak in both field orientations.
Analyzing the distinct magnetic field-dependent shifts of both peaks
facilitates the identification of the emergent feature as a spin-singlet with a
significantly smaller reduced exciton mass as compared to the neutral exciton.
The intensity of the emergent feature increases with magnetic field according
to $\propto B^2$, as expected for a linear dispersion relation. The
density-dependent diamagnetic shift ratios of both features follow the expected
density dependence of the electron-hole exchange interactions. We interpret our
observations within a picture of magnetic-field-induced coupling between the
bright massive and quasi dark light-like exciton, leading to its brightening.

The presence of phonon instabilities that leads to the formation of charge
modulated states in kagome metals has allowed their classification based on the
atomic displacements. Here, we use diffuse and inelastic x-ray scattering,
backed by Monte Carlo simulations to describe a type-I instability in the
kagome metal Yb$_{0.5}$Co$_3$Ge$_3$. We find that the in-plane distortion of Co
in the kagome plane drives a structural transition with the appearance of new
Bragg peaks at odd $L$, which are surrounded by a hexagonal diffuse signal. The
anisotropic diffuse scattering, characteristic of a highly frustrated
triangular lattice was simulated following a combination of Ising hamiltonian
and Lennard-Jones potential, and demonstrate that the structural phase
transition in Yb$_{0.5}$Co$_3$Ge$_3$ is of an order-disorder transformation
type. The inelastic spectra reveals no softening but an anomalous broadening of
the $\Gamma-A$ low energy acoustic mode. Our results highlight the critical
role of the geometric frustration in promoting ordering from disorder in kagome
lattices and power of diffuse scattering to disentangle the internal atomic
displacements and correlated disorder.

With the rapid advancement of photovoltaic science, there has been an
increasing focus on the development of environment-friendly and structurally
advanced perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this context, this study
investigates an architectural configuration employing 2D Dion-Jacobson phase
perovskites as both electron and hole transport layers within a 2D/absorber/2D

enhance the overall efficiency of the device. While the reduction of lead

focuses on the evaluation of seven lead-free absorber materials: MASnBr3,
Sr3PI3/Sr3SbI3, p-CuBi2O4, p-Si, CH3NH3SnI3, Sb2Se3, and CZTSSe. These
materials were assessed in the context of an
FTO/PeDAMA8Pb6I19/IDL1/absorber/IDL2/PeDAMA2Pb3I10/C architecture utilizing
SCAPS-1D simulation software. The study includes a comprehensive analysis of
band alignment, pre-optimization screening, and performance optimization
through the adjustment of absorber thickness, doping levels, and defect
densities. Additionally, the temperature sensitivity and the substitution of
the FTO layer with ITO, IZO, and MZO were also investigated. The simulation
results indicated that Sb2Se3 and CZTSSe achieved the highest efficiencies of
41.00% and 41.19%, respectively. Furthermore, MZO was identified as a strong
candidate for replacing FTO, maintaining consistent performance across all
absorber types analyzed. Overall, this study provides a comparative framework
for the material selection within layered PSC architectures and significantly
contributes to the advancement of stable, efficient, and lead-free photovoltaic
technologies.

Geometric frustration is a key parameter controlling electronic and magnetic
properties of quantum spin liquid systems, yet remains challenging to tune.
Here, we coherently drive molecular vibrations with midinfrared pulses in two
organic quantum spin liquid candidates, the insulating
$\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Cu$_2$(CN)$_3$ and the metallic
$\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_4$Hg$_{2.89}$Br$_8$, and probe their electronic response
through ultrafast reflectivity measurements. We observe a nonlinear coupling
between local molecular vibrations and nonlocal phonons, which is expected to
directly modulate the geometric frustration of their triangular lattice. Our
findings establish a promising route to dynamically control frustration in
nonbipartite quantum materials.

In this work we theoretically investigate the false vacuum decay process in a
ferromagnetic quantum spin-1/2 chain. We develop a many-body theory describing
the nucleation and the coherent dynamics of true-vacuum bubbles that is
analytically tractable and agrees with numerical matrix product state
calculations in all parameter regimes up to intermediate times. This bosonic
theory allows us to identify different regimes in the parameter space and
unravel the underlying physical mechanisms. In particular, regimes that closely
correspond to the cosmological false vacuum decay picture are highlighted and
characterized in terms of observable quantities.

### Dislocation-mediated short-range order evolution during thermomechanical processing

Thermomechanical processing alters the microstructure of metallic alloys
through coupled plastic deformation and thermal exposure, with dislocation
motion driving plasticity and microstructural evolution. Our previous work
showed that the same dislocation motion both creates and destroys chemical
short-range order (SRO), driving alloys into far-from-equilibrium SRO states.
However, the connection between this dislocation-mediated SRO evolution and
processing parameters remains largely unexplored. Here, we perform large-scale
atomistic simulations of thermomechanical processing of equiatomic TiTaVW to
determine how temperature and strain rate control SRO via competing creation
($\Gamma$) and annihilation ($\lambda$) rates. Using machine learning
interatomic potentials and information-theoretic metrics, we quantify that the
magnitude and chemical character of SRO vary systematically with these
parameters. We identify two regimes: a low-temperature regime with weak
strain-rate sensitivity, and a high-temperature regime in which reduced
dislocation density and increased screw character amplify chemical bias and
accelerate SRO formation. The resulting steady-state SRO is
far-from-equilibrium and cannot be produced by equilibrium thermal annealing.
Together, these results provide a mechanistic and predictive link between
processing parameters, dislocation physics, and SRO evolution in chemically
complex alloys.

### A Haldane-Anderson Hamiltonian Model for Hyperthermal Hydrogen Scattering from a Semiconductor Surface

- **TL;DR**: 这篇论文研究氢原子在Ge(111)表面散射过程中的非准阶能量耗散机制，发现传统的电子摩擦方法无法描述这种效应，而独立电子表面跳跃法能够正确预测只有当初始动能超过基底带宽时才会发生非准阶能量耗散。

Collisions of atoms and molecules with metal surfaces create electronic
excitations in the metal, leading to nonadiabatic energy dissipation, inelastic
scattering, and sticking. Mixed quantum-classical molecular dynamics simulation
methods, such as molecular dynamics with electronic friction, are able to
capture nonadiabatic energy loss during dynamics at metal surfaces. Hydrogen
atom scattering on semiconductors, on the other hand, exhibits strong
adsorbate-surface energy transfer only when the projectile kinetic energy
exceeds the bandgap of the substrate. Electronic friction fails to describe
this effect. Here, we report a first-principles parameterization of a simple
Haldane-Anderson Hamiltonian model of hydrogen atom gas-surface scattering on
$c(2\times8)$Ge(111), for which hyperthermal scattering experiments have been
reported. We subsequently perform independent electron surface hopping and
Ehrenfest dynamics simulations on this model. Whereas mean-field dynamics yield
weak nonadiabatic energy loss that is independent of the initial kinetic
energy, independent electron surface hopping simulations qualitatively agree
with the experimental observation that nonadiabatic energy dissipation only
occurs if the initial kinetic energy exceeds the bandgap of the surface. We
further show how nonadiabatic energy loss affects sticking, which is yet to be
experimentally measured.

The schematic model of interacting spins is introduced, which combines the
symmetry of hypercube with the simplicity of random regular graph with degree
three, i.e. the random cubic graph. We study the localization transition in
this model, which shares essential characteristics with the systems exhibiting
many-body localization. Namely, we investigate the transition in terms of the
entanglement entropy and entanglement spectrum. We also show that the most
significant indicator of the localization transition is the failure of
eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, when the distribution of matrix elements
of local operators changes from Gasussian to bimodal. It also provides good
estimate for the critical disorder strength.

### Overcoming Quantum Resistivity Scaling in Nanoscale Interconnects Using Delafossite PdCoO2

- **TL;DR**: 这篇论文研究了PdCoO2作为新型互连材料的性能，通过理论模型和对比分析证实其在子限制条件下比铜更优的导电性能和可缩放性。

Continued scaling into the sub 7 nm regime exacerbates quantum limited
resistivity in Cu interconnects. We evaluated layered PdCoO2 and explicitly
benchmarked it against Cu to identify mechanisms that maintain conductivity
under confinement. Using a momentum resolved relaxation time formalism derived
from the conductivity tensor, we link k and energy resolved velocities, life
times, and mean free paths (MFPs) to thickness dependent resistivity for films
and wires. PdCoO2 exhibits quasi 2D transport with high inplane velocities and
strongly anisotropic MFPs (15 nm inplane, 3 nm outofplane near EF), whereas Cu
shows an isotropic 22 nm MFP. Under identical boundary conditions including a
realistic 2 nm liner/diffusion barrier for Cu, PdCoO2 displays suppressed
boundary scattering and a much slower resistivity increase from bulk down to
sub 30 nm, preserving near bulk conductivity and remaining viable at 2 nm.
Thickness trends reveal dual slope changes in PdCoO2 (35 nm and 7 nm) set by
anisotropic MFPs, contrasting with the single characteristic scale of Cu (40
nm). The calculated bulk values and scaling curves track available measurements
for both materials. These results establish PdCoO2 as a scalable interconnect
that outperforms Cu under quantum confinement and provide a quantitative
framework to screen layered conductors for next generation nanoelectronic
interconnects.

### Expanding the search space of high entropy oxides and predicting synthesizability using machine learning interatomic potentials

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种基于机器学习势函数的高熵氧化物合成性预测方法，通过能量方差和混合焓作为描述符，成功预测了已知稳定4组分HEO并发现了新的5组分候选体系

We propose an efficient computational methodology for predicting the
synthesizability of high entropy oxides (HEOs) in a large space of possible
candidate compounds. HEOs are a growing field with an enormous potential
chemical composition space, and yet the discovery of new HEOs is slow and
driven by experimental trial-and-error. In this work, we attempt to speed up
this process by using a machine learned interatomic potential offering
DFT-level accuracy. Our methodology starts by identifying a set of crystal
structures and elements for screening, building a large random unit cell of
each composition and structure, then relaxing this structure. The most
promising candidates are distinguished based on the variance of the individual
cation energies, which we introduce as our entropy descriptor, and the enthalpy
of mixing, which is used as the enthalpy descriptor. The approach is applied to
tetravalent HEOs, and its validity is confirmed by comparison to alternative
descriptors and DFT calculations for a set of 7 elements. The search is then
extended to a set of 14 elements and three crystal structures, where it
successfully identifies the only known stable 4-component HEO in the
$\alpha$-PbO$_2$ structure, as well as predicting several new 5-component
candidate systems. This approach can straightforwardly be applied to new sets
of elements and structures, allowing for the accelerated discovery of new HEOs.

hard disks with periodic boundary conditions. Using a model based on the
DeepSets architecture, which imposes permutation invariance of the particle
labels, we train a model to capture the irreversibility of the H-functional.

### Observation of relativistic domain wall motion in amorphous ferrimagnets

- **TL;DR**: 在无形GdFeCo粉碳合金中观察到相对论之间壁速度饼和效应，证明这类无彥材料也能达到磁器件的最高运行频率极限

Domain walls in magnetic materials are sine-Gordon solitons characterized by
relativistic kinematics, with the maximum spin-wave group velocity setting a
limit for the domain wall speed and hence the highest operation frequency of
magnetic devices. This relativistic regime has been observed only in
crystalline iron-garnet ferrimagnets but is in general expected in many
magnetic materials. In particular, amorphous rare-earth -- transition metal
ferrimagnets should exhibit relativistic effects because of their ultrafast
magnetic dynamics. However, no evidence for these effects has been reported in
these technologically relevant materials. Here, we show that the relativistic
regime can be attained in easy-to-engineer amorphous ferrimagnetic alloys. In
GdFeCo we observe a saturation of the current-induced domain wall velocity that
is indicative of a maximum spin-wave speed of the order of 2 km/s. Our
observations indicate that relativistic dynamics are not exclusive to
ferrimagnetic garnets but also exist in rare-earth -- transition-metal
ferrimagnets, which provide a robust material platform for future magnetic
devices operating at the ultimate speed limit.

Altermagnets have recently emerged as promising materials for next-generation
spintronic devices. For their device applications, realizing a single-domain
configuration is essential but remains challenging. We theoretically consider
injecting magnetic multipoles into altermagnets, which can be achieved by
applying an in-plane current to an altermagnet/normal metal bilayer. We
demonstrate for $d$-wave altermagnets that the torque generated by the magnetic
octupole injection can achieve magnetic-field-free deterministic switching of
the altermagnets' N\'eel vector and transform their multidomain configurations
into a single domain. This method allows the switching in diverse altermagnets,
thereby facilitating their device applications and fundamental studies. This
work also exemplifies the usefulness of magnetic multipole currents.

Achieving external control over the anomalous valley Hall (AVH) effect is
essential for advancing valleytronic applications. However, many of the
existing approaches suffer from limitations such as irreversibility or
volatility. In this work, we propose a general strategy for enabling
nonvolatile electrical tuning of the AVH effect by utilizing multiferroic van
der Waals heterostructures. Using first-principles density functional theory
calculations, we demonstrate that a heterostructure composed of a ferromagnetic
monolayer VSSe and a ferroelectric monolayer Al$_2$S$_3$ permits fine control
of valley transport properties. The AVH response in VSSe can be reversibly and
nonvolatility switched by reversing the polarization of Al$_2$S$_3$ via an
applied electric field. This ferroelectric mechanism ensures a stable valley
state even without continuous energy input. Furthermore, the valley
polarization can also be inverted through the same polarization switching
process, providing a dual degree of control over valley-dependent phenomena.
These findings establish a promising pathway toward intrinsically switchable
and energy-efficient valleytronic devices.

Altermagnetism presents intriguing possibilities for spintronic devices due
to its unique combination of strong spin-splitting and zero net magnetization.
However, realizing its full potential hinges on fabricating single-variant
altermagnetic thin films. In this work, we present definitive evidence for the
formation of single-variant altermagnetic RuO2(101) thin films with fully
epitaxial growth on Al2O3(1-102) r-plane substrates, confirmed through rigorous
structural analyses using X-ray diffraction, atomic-resolution transmission
electron microscopy and X-ray magnetic linear dichroism. The mutual
correspondence of the occupancy of oxygen atoms on the surfaces of
RuO2(101)[010] and Al2O3(1-102)[11-20] plays a decisive role in the formation
of the single-variant RuO2, which is also supported by our first-principles
density functional theory calculations. We further observed spin-splitting
magnetoresistance in the single-variant RuO2(101)/CoFeB bilayers, highlighting
the characteristic effect of single variant on spin transport. The
demonstration of single-variant RuO2(101) films marks a significant advancement
in the field of altermagnetism and paves the way for exploring their potential
applications.

The formation of extended sulfur vacancies in MoS2 monolayers is closely
associated with catalytic activity and may also be the basis for its memristive
behavior. Nanosecond-scale molecular dynamics simulations using machine
learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) reveal key mechanisms of cooperative
vacancy transport, including incorporation of vacancies into clusters of
arbitrary size. The simulations provide a coherent atomistic explanation for
irradiation-induced vacancy patterns observed experimentally, especially the
formation of line defects spanning tens of nanometers. Results and performance
are compared of two MLIP frameworks: (i) on-the-fly learning with Gaussian
approximation potential, and (ii) fine-tuning of an equivariant foundation
model.

Known method of fibrous oxides production (first of all, V2O5) by intensive
stirring in water is treated in the frame of driven systems approach developed
in 80s by Georges Martin et al for systems under irradiation or severe plastic
deformation. Instead of ballistic diffusion, the ballistic detachments of atoms
from the oxide surface under stirring are introduced. Simplified Monte Carlo
scheme is suggested for crystal evolution within TLK model, taking into account
anisotropy and additional athermal detachment probabilities. Individual cluster
in limited volume becomes elongated in steady-state or dissolve. For the
ensemble of clusters, the number is decreasing (as in common ripening), but the
mean length of fibers grows, as well as the total surface energy (contrary to
common ripening).

### Atomistic mechanisms of phase transitions in all-temperature barocaloric material KPF$_6$

- **TL;DR**: KPF₆通过压力驱动的相变实现全温度范围压热效应，研究发现其四种相态转变机制与氟取向无序性、非谐性密切相关

Conventional barocaloric materials typically exhibit limited operating
temperature ranges. In contrast, KPF$_6$ has recently been reported to achieve
an exceptional all-temperature barocaloric effect (BCE) via pressure-driven
phase transitions. Here, we elucidate the atomistic mechanisms underlying the
phase transitions through first-principles calculations and machine-learning
potential accelerated molecular dynamics simulations. We identify four distinct
phases: the room-temperature cubic (C) plastic crystal characterized by strong
fluorine orientational disorder (FOD) and anharmonicity, the
intermediate-temperature monoclinic (M-II) phase with decreasing FOD, the
low-temperature monoclinic (M-I) phase with suppressed FOD, and the fully
ordered rhombohedral (R) phase under pressure. Phonon calculations confirm the
dynamic stability of the M-II, M-I, and R phases at 0 K, whereas the C phase
requires thermal fluctuations for stabilization. Under pressure, all the C,
M-II, and M-I phases transform to the R phase, which are driven by cooperative
PF$_6$ octahedral rotations coupled with lattice modulations. These
pressure-induced phase transitions result in persistent isothermal entropy
changes across a wide temperature range, thereby explaining the experimentally
observed all-temperature BCE in this material. Hybrid functional calculations
reveal wide-bandgap insulating behavior across all phases. This work deciphers
the interplay between FOD, anharmonicity, and phase transitions in KPF$_6$,
providing important insights for the design of BCE materials with broad
operational temperature spans.

Ferroelectric control of altermagnetism in momentum space has been studied
widely, while the control of magnetism in real space of altermagnets are still
rare. We present a design rule to identify multiferroicity in n=2
Ruddlesden-Popper halides. Our results show that a Jahn-Teller distortion can
cooperate with oxygen octahedral rotations to break inversion symmetry, which
we demonstrate in K3Cr2F7 and cation-ordered KAg2Cu2Cl7, and leads to a
ferrielectric-to-ferroelectric phase transition in K3Cr2F7. Altermagnetic spin
order in the ferrielectric phase of K3Cr2F7 transforms into a conventional
antiferromagnetic order in the ferroelectric phase, at which strain/pressure
engineered sizable changes of weak ferromagnetism can occur. Our study is not
only conducive to realize strong magnetoelectric coupling in multiferroics, but
also reveals more functionalities in altermagnetic materials.

Metal halides, particularly MX and MX$_2$ compounds (where M represents metal
elements and X = F, Cl, Br, I), have attracted significant interest due to
their diverse electronic and optoelectronic properties. However, a
comprehensive understanding of their structural and electronic behavior,
particularly the evolution of these properties from bulk to low-dimensional
forms, remains limited. To address this gap, we performed first-principles
calculations to develop a database of 60 MX and MX$_2$ metal halides, detailing
their structural and electronic properties in both bulk and slab
configurations. Calculations were performed using the advanced
\texttt{HSE06-D3} hybrid functional for density functional theory (DFT),
ensuring high precision in predicting material properties despite the
associated computational cost. The results reveal that these materials are
predominantly semiconductors, but their bandgaps range from 0 to 9 eV. A
detailed analysis of the transition from bulk to slab structures highlights
notable shifts in electronic properties, including bandgap modifications. Upon
dimensional reduction, 9 materials exhibit an indirect-to-direct bandgap
transition, enhancing their potential for energy conversion. Beyond structural
dimensionality, the influence of chemical composition on bandgap variations was
also examined. To further assess their practical applicability, the catalytic
and magnetic properties of these metal halides were systematically evaluated.
These findings not only illuminate previously underexplored MX and MX$_2$ metal
halides but also identify promising candidates for electronic, optoelectronic,
catalytic and spintronic applications. This database serves as a valuable
resource for guiding future research and technology development in
low-dimensional materials.
