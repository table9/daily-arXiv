- **TL;DR**: 本研究应用响应理论研究电子电荷动力学，特别关注电荷分离现象。通过分析线性和二次响应理论在描述电荷密度和电流方面的优缺点，发现二次响应理论能更好地描述电荷动力学和分离过程。

This study applies response theory to investigate electron charge dynamics,
with a particular focus on charge separation. We analytically assess the
strengths and limitations of linear and quadratic response theories in
describing charge density and current, illustrated by a model that simulates
charge transfer systems. While linear response accurately captures optical
properties, the quadratic response contains the minimal ingredients required to
describe charge dynamics and separation. Notably, it closely matches exact time
propagation results in some regime that we identify. We propose and test
several approximations to the quadratic response and explore the influence of
higher-order terms and the effect of an on-site interaction $U$.

- **TL;DR**: DFT-1/2方法用于计算硅中浅层缺陷的结合能，通过大超胞（4096原子）和无限超胞尺寸外推方案，解决了传统DFT的带隙低估和离域误差问题，同时保持计算效率。

Accurately calculating the binding energies of shallow defects requires large
supercells to capture the extended nature of their wavefunctions. This makes
many beyond-DFT methods, such as hybrid functionals, impractical for direct
calculations, often requiring indirect or approximate approaches. However,
standard DFT alone fails to provide reliable results due to the well-known band
gap underestimation and delocalization errors. In this work, we employ the
DFT-1/2 method to address these deficiencies while maintaining computational
efficiency allowing us to reach supercells of up to 4096 atoms. We develop a
practical procedure for applying DFT-1/2 to shallow defects and demonstrate its
effectiveness for group V donors in silicon (P, As, Sb, Bi). By using an
extrapolation scheme to infinite supercell size, we obtain accurate binding
energies with minimal computational overhead. This approach offers a simple and
direct method for calculating donor binding energies.

### Nonadiabatic force matching for alchemical free-energy estimation

- **TL;DR**: 一种基于激光去噪生成模型的非准静态化学变换方法，用于计算自由能，通过估计散射而非最小化散射来提高效率

We propose a method to compute free energies from nonadiabatic alchemical
transformations using diffusion-denoising generative models. The method,
nonadiabatic force matching, hinges on estimating -- rather than minimizing --
the dissipation along an alchemical transition as the functional of a
nonadiabatic potential, which plays the role of a diffusion-denoising protocol.
Applying the algorithm to compute alchemical free energies of simple atomistic
models shows it can significantly cut the simulation cost of a free-energy
estimate at no loss of accuracy compared with thermodynamic integration.

### Average weighted ratio of consecutive level spacings for infinite-dimensional orthogonal random matrices

- **TL;DR**: 这篇论文提出了一种加权相邻能级间隔比值的新方法，用于量化量子各态性的起始，并通过解Painlevé微分方程为无穷维随机矩阵提供了参考值。

The onset of quantum ergodicity is often quantified by the average ratio of
consecutive level spacings. The reference values for ergodic quantum systems
have been obtained numerically from the spectra of large but finite-dimensional
random matrices. This work introduces a weighted ratio of consecutive level
spacings, having the propery that the average can be computed numerically for
random matrices of infinite dimension. A Painlev\'e differential equation is
solved numerically in order to determine this average for infinite-dimensional
orthogonal random matrices, thereby providing a reference value for ergodic
quantum systems obeying time-reversal symmetry. A Wigner surmise-inspired
analytical calculation is found to yield a qualitatively accurate picture for
the statistics of high-dimensional random matrices from each of the symmetry
classes. For Poissonian level statistics, a significantly different average is
found, indicating that the average weighted ratio of consecutive level spacings
can be used as a probe for quantum ergodicity.

### Mott transition from the non-analyticity of the one-body reduced density-matrix functional

- **TL;DR**: 本文构建了多轨道Hubbard模型的一体约化密度矩阵泛函(1RDMF)，通过变分离散作用理论(VDAT)的N=3变分ansatz，在热力学极限下准确描述了Mott和Hund物理，揭示了Hund交换使连续Mott相变变为一级相变的机制。

One-body reduced density-matrix functional (1RDMF) theory has yielded
promising results for small systems such as molecules, but has not addressed
quantum phase transitions such as the Mott transition. Here we explicitly
execute the constrained search within a variational ansatz to construct a 1RDMF
for the multi-orbital Hubbard model with up to seven orbitals in the
thermodynamic limit. The variational ansatz is the \mathcal{N}=3 ansatz of the
variational discrete action theory (VDAT), which can be exactly evaluated in
d=\infty. The resulting 1RDMF exactly encapsulates the \mathcal{N}=3 VDAT
results, which accurately captures Mott and Hund physics. We find that
non-analytic behavior emerges in our 1RDMF at fixed integer filling, which
gives rise to the Mott transition. We explain this behavior by separating the
constrained search into multiple stages, illustrating how a nonzero Hund
exchange drives the continuous Mott transition to become first-order. Our
approach creates a new path forward for constructing an accurate 1RDMF for
strongly correlated electron materials.

### NV-like Defects More Common Than Four-Leaf Clovers: A Perspective on High-Throughput Point Defect Data

Point defects for quantum technologies is an emerging research area, with the
nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond at the forefront. However, how rare are
defects with NV-like properties? In this perspective, I highlight the results
of NV-like defects across 17 different materials, revealing that they are more
common than finding four-leaf clovers. I also discuss expanding the search
criteria to identify other defects relevant to quantum technologies. Utilizing
point defect databases will be instrumental in assisting researchers in
discovering previously unexplored defects suitable for quantum technologies.

### Single layer clathrane: A potential superconducting two-dimensional (2D) hydrogenated metal borocarbide

- **TL;DR**: 提出了新型二维金属硼碳化物笼形超导体，通过氢钝化和表面金属装饰稳定化，具有可调超导性，应变工程可将超导临界温度平均提高15.5K

We propose a new family of two-dimensional (2D) metal-borocarbide clathrane
superconductors, derived from three-dimensional (3D) MM$^\prime$B$_6$C$_6$
clathrates. First-principles calculations reveal that hydrogen passivation and
surface metal decoration stabilize the M$_2$M$^\prime$B$_8$C$_8$H$_8$
monolayers. These 2D systems exhibit tunable superconductivity governed by hole
concentration, structural anisotropy, and electron-phonon coupling. We find
that in-plane anisotropy competes with superconductivity, reducing \tc\ despite
favorable doping. Biaxial strain mitigates this anisotropy, enhances Fermi
surface nesting, and increases \tc\ by an average of 15.5~K. For example, the
\tc\ of Sr$_3$B$_8$C$_8$H$_8$ is predicted to increase from 11.3~K to 22.2~K
with strain engineering. These findings identify 2D clathranes as promising,
strain-tunable superconductors and highlight design principles for optimizing
low-dimensional superconducting materials.

### Role of electron-electron interactions in $M$-valley twisted transition metal dichalcogenides

- **TL;DR**: 本文研究了M-谷莫尔系统中长程库仑相互作用的作用，发现在有限掺杂和层间偏压下，电子-电子相互作用会显著改变莫尔能带，导致范霍夫奇点固定在费米能级上，从而增强超导性和强关联态。

We investigate the role of long-range Coulomb interactions in $M$-valley
moir\'e systems using the self-consistent Hartree-Fock approximation. This
platform was recently proposed [Nature 643, 376 (2025) and arXiv:2411.18828
(2024)] as a new class of experimentally realizable moir\'e materials using
twisted transition metal dichalcogenides homobilayers with the 1T structure.
While these seminal studies considered the noninteracting theory without an
interlayer bias due to an electric displacement field, this work shows that
both electron-electron interactions at finite doping and an interlayer bias
strongly modify the moir\'e bands. For small twist angles, the density of
states as a function of filling and interlayer bias shows qualitatively
different behavior for twisting near aligned ($0^\circ$) and antialigned
($60^\circ$) stacking. More interestingly, the Van Hove singularity becomes
pinned to the Fermi energy over a finite range of doping, an effect known to
enhance both superconductivity and strongly correlated states. For aligned
stacking this occurs only at zero electric field, while for antialigned
stacking this happens both at zero and finite field. Our work demonstrates that
correlated states in $M$-valley 1TtTMDs can be strongly tuned \textit{in situ}
both by applying an electric displacement field and by electron doping.

### Numerically "exact" charge transport dynamics in a dissipative electron-phonon model rationalizing the success of the transient localization scenario

Optical conductivity in molecular semiconductors is suppressed in the
terahertz region, featuring the displaced Drude peak that reflects carriers'
transient localization (TL) by slow intermolecular vibrations. Meanwhile,
recent computations in minimal models evidence optical-conductivity
enhancements below the characteristic vibrational frequency, which cannot be
captured by the TL phenomenology. These models assume undamped vibrations,
whereas atomistic simulations show that the vibrations most strongly modulating
carrier's hopping amplitude are damped. Here, we use the dissipaton equations
of motion (DEOM) method to compute finite-temperature real-time current
autocorrelation function in a one-dimensional model with Brownian-oscillator
spectral density of nonlocal carrier-phonon interaction. We exploit the
dissipaton algebra to handle the phonon-assisted current, reduce the method's
computational requirements by working in momentum space, and confirm that
numerically stable transport dynamics are virtually independent of a specific
DEOM closing scheme. With increasing damping, we find that DEOM
optical-conductivity profiles become increasingly qualitatively similar to TL
predictions. For parameters representative of room-temperature hole transport
in single-crystal rubrene, we conclude that the TL phenomenology is established
already in the underdamped-oscillator regime. Reasonable variations in the
damping constant weakly affect the carrier mobility, which remains within
experimental bounds. Overall, our results strongly suggest that
optical-conductivity enhancements at very low frequencies are artifacts of
undamped vibrations, and rationalize the success of the TL phenomenology in
describing experimental data.

### Quadrupole-conserving dynamics in the non-commutative plane

- **TL;DR**: 本文基于分形流体动力学启发，在非对易平面上提出了一个新的动力学普适性类别，源于局部面积守恒动力学和特殊的对称性群。

Inspired by ``fracton hydrodynamic" universality classes of dynamics with
unusual conservation laws, we present a new dynamical universality class that
arises out of local area-preserving dynamics in the non-commutative plane. On
this symplectic manifold, the area-preserving spatial symmetry group
$\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})\rtimes \mathbb{R}^2$ is a symmetry group compatible
with non-trivial many-body dynamics. The conservation laws associated to this
symmetry group correspond to the dipole and quadrupole moments of the
particles. We study the unusual dynamics of a crystal lattice subject to such
symmetries, and argue that the hydrodynamic description of lattice dynamics
breaks down due to relevant nonlinearities. Numerical simulations of classical
Hamiltonian dynamical systems with this symmetry are largely consistent with a
tree-level effective field theory estimate for the endpoint of this
instability.

### Matrix Product Operator Constructions for Gauge Theories in the Thermodynamic Limit

- **TL;DR**: 提出使用无限矩阵乘积态(iMPS)模拟低维晶格规范理论的一般方法，通过积分规范场得到有效哈密顿量，构建矩阵乘积算子(MPO)表示，适用于1+1维规范理论研究

We present a general method for simulating lattice gauge theories in low
dimensions using infinite matrix product states (iMPS). A central challenge in
Hamiltonian formulations of gauge theories is the unbounded local Hilbert space
associated with gauge degrees of freedom. In one spatial dimension, Gauss's law
permits these gauge fields to be integrated out, yielding an effective
Hamiltonian with long-range interactions among matter fields. We construct
efficient matrix product operator (MPO) representations of these Hamiltonians
directly in the thermodynamic limit. Our formulation naturally includes
background fields and $\theta$-terms, requiring no modifications to the
standard iDMRG algorithm. This provides a broadly applicable framework for 1+1D
gauge theories and can be extended to quasi-two-dimensional geometries such as
infinite cylinders, where tensor-network methods remain tractable. As a
benchmark, we apply our construction to the Schwinger model, reproducing
expected features including confinement, string breaking, and the critical
behavior at finite mass. Because the method alters only the MPO structure, it
can be incorporated with little effort into a wide range of iMPS and
infinite-boundary-condition algorithms, opening the way to efficient studies of
both equilibrium and non-equilibrium gauge dynamics.

### Engineering and exploiting self-driven domain wall motion in ferrimagnets for neuromorphic computing applications

- **TL;DR**: 本文展示了通过局域工程化横向交换耦合在过渡金属-稀土亚铁磁体中实现自发畴壁运动，为神经形态计算提供了一种可调谐、可扩展的简单平台。

Magnetic domain wall motion has recently garnered significant interest as a
physical mechanism to enable energy-efficient, next-generation brain-inspired
computing architectures. However, realizing all behaviors required for
neuromorphic computing within standard material systems remains a significant
challenge, as these functionalities often rely on competing interactions. Here,
we demonstrate how spontaneous domain wall motion in response to locally
engineered lateral exchange coupling in transition metal-rare earth
ferrimagnets can be leveraged to achieve numerous neuromorphic computing
functionalities in devices with minimal complexity. Through experiments and
micromagnetic simulations, we show how tuning the feature size, material
composition, and chiral interaction strength controls the speed of self-driven
domain wall motion. When integrated with spin-orbit torque, this control gives
rise to behaviors essential for neuromorphic computing, including leaky
integration and passive resetting of artificial neuron potential. These results
establish locally engineered ferrimagnets as a tunable, scalable, and
straightforward platform for domain wall-based computing architectures.

### Emergent superconducting stripes in two-orbital superconductors

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种在二维均匀系统中自然形成超导条纹的本征机制，无需无序、电荷不均匀性或竞争序的参与，基于双轨道模型和蒙特卡洛模拟证明了超导条纹的形成。

Motivated by recent experiments in KTaO$_3$/EuO interface, we propose an
intrinsic mechanism where superconducting stripes emerge naturally without
involving disorder, charge inhomogeneity, or competing orders. Our theory is
based on a two-orbital model of superconductivity, where one orbital displays a
quasi-one-dimensional dispersion and the other orbital is more localized and
contributes pairing interactions along the perpendicular direction. Our
auxiliary-field Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the pairing amplitude
exhibits spatial modulation such that the superconductivity naturally
disaggregates into two-leg or three-leg superconducting stripes separated by
non-superconducting blocks. Our work provides a promising scenario of emergent
superconducting stripes in homogeneous two-dimensional systems and reveals
unexpectedly rich physics in two-orbital superconductors for future materials
design.

### Jahn-Teller-like Distortion in a One-dimensional π-Conjugated Polymer

- **TL;DR**: 一维共轭聚合物PDFHE在金属表面自发发生面外骨架扭曲，打破镜面对称性，通过Jahn-Teller类机制稳定非平面构象，降低能量并增大带隙

Structurally distorting low-dimensional {\pi}-conjugated systems can
profoundly influence their electronic properties, but controlling such behavior
in extended-width systems remains challenging. Here we demonstrate that a
one-dimensional conjugated polymer, poly-(difluorenoheptalene-ethynylene)
(PDFHE), undergoes a pronounced out-of-plane backbone distortion, equivalent to
a spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of its mirror symmetry. We synthesized
PDFHE on noble metal surfaces and characterized its structure and electronic
states using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy. Rather than
adopting a planar, high-symmetry conformation, PDFHE relaxes into non-planar
isomers stabilized by a Jahn-Teller-like mechanism that relieves an electronic
instability relative to the gapped planar structure. Density functional theory
calculations corroborate these findings, revealing that distortion lowers the
total polymer energy and enlarges the bandgap, providing a microscopic
explanation for the SSB. Our results show that even in mechanically robust
extended {\pi}-systems, subtle electron-lattice coupling can spontaneously
drive significant structural rearrangements.

### A Simple and Scalable Kernel Density Approach for Reliable Uncertainty Quantification in Atomistic Machine Learning

Machine learning models are increasingly used to predict material properties
and accelerate atomistic simulations, but the reliability of their predictions
depends on the representativeness of the training data. We present a scalable,
GPU-accelerated uncertainty quantification framework based on
$k$-nearest-neighbor kernel density estimation (KDE) in a PCA-reduced
descriptor space. This method efficiently detects sparsely sampled regions in
large, high-dimensional datasets and provides a transferable, model-agnostic
uncertainty metric without requiring retraining costly model ensembles. The
framework is validated across diverse case studies varying in: i) chemistry,
ii) prediction models (including foundational neural network), iii) descriptors
used for KDE estimation, and iv) properties whose uncertainty is sought. In all
cases, the KDE-based score reliably flags extrapolative configurations,
correlates well with conventional ensemble-based uncertainties, and highlights
regions of reduced prediction trustworthiness. The approach offers a practical
route for improving the interpretability, robustness, and deployment readiness
of ML models in materials science.

### Size-structured populations with growth fluctuations: Feynman--Kac formula and decoupling

- **TL;DR**: 本文研究了一个基于内部表型波动的细胞增殖模型，分析了生长和分裂速率如何影响种群表型分布，并推导了尺寸与内部状态分布解耦的条件。

We study a size--structured population model of proliferating cells in which
biomass accumulation and binary division occur at rates modulated by
fluctuating internal phenotypes. We quantify how fluctuations in internal
variables that influence both growth and division shape the distribution of
population phenotypes. We derive conditions under which the distributions of
size and internal state decouple. Under this decoupling, population--level
expectations are obtained from lineage-level expectations by an exponential
tilting given by the Feynman--Kac formula. We further characterize weaker
(ensemble-specific) versions of decoupling that hold in the lineage or the
population ensemble but not both. Finally, we provide a more general
interpretation of the tilted expectations in terms of the mass-weighted
phenotype distribution.

### The numerical case for identifying paired quantum Hall phases by their daughters

- **TL;DR**: 该论文通过数值方法证明，非阿贝尔量子霍尔态的'子态'能够可靠地预测母体拓扑相，为识别非阿贝尔量子霍尔相提供了有力证据

Many candidate non-Abelian quantum Hall states are accompanied by nearby
`daughter' states, which are proposed to identify their topological order.
Combining exact diagonalization and trial wave functions, we provide numerical
evidence that daughter states reliably predict the parent topological phase. In
the contexts of bilayer graphene and wide GaAs quantum wells, we show that the
same interactions simultaneously stabilize Pfaffian, anti-Pfaffian, and their
daughters, while suppressing the Jain states. The competition between Pfaffian
and anti-Pfaffian, which is decided by particle-hole symmetry-breaking
interactions, can likewise be deduced from their daughters. These findings
strongly support the daughter-state-based identification of non-Abelian quantum
Hall phases.

### Lattice anharmonicity effects in fluorite oxide single crystals and anomalous increase in phonon lifetime in ceria at elevated temperature

We investigate the temperature dependence of the frequency and linewidth of
the triply-degenerate T$_{2g}$ zone-centered optical phonon in flux-grown ceria
and hydrothermally-synthesized thoria single crystals from room temperature to
1273 K using Raman spectroscopy. Both crystals exhibit an expected increase in
the phonon linewidth with temperature due to enhanced phonon-phonon scattering.
However, ceria displays an anomalous linewidth reduction in the temperature
range of 1023-1123 K. First-principles phonon linewidth calculations
considering cubic and quartic phonon interactions within
temperature-independent phonon dispersion fail to describe this anomaly. A
parameterization of the temperature-dependent second order interatomic force
constants based on previously reported phonon dispersion measured at room and
high temperatures, predicts a deviation from the monotonic linewidth increase,
albeit at temperatures lower than those observed experimentally for ceria. The
qualitative agreement in the trend of temperature-dependent linewidth suggests
that lattice anharmonicity-induced phonon renormalization plays a role in
phonon lifetime. Specifically, a change in the overlap between softened
acoustic and optical branches in the dispersion curve reduces the available
phonon scattering phase space of the Raman active mode at the zone center,
leading to an increased phonon lifetime within a narrow temperature interval.
These findings provide new insights into higher-order anharmonic interactions
in ceria and thoria, motivating further investigations into the role of
anharmonicity-induced phonon renormalization on phonon lifetimes at high
temperatures.

Superconductivity and ferromagnetism are naturally competing, while their
interplay can give rise to exotic quantum phases, such as triplet pairing,
exemplified by heavy-fermion compounds like UTe$_2$, where magnetic
fluctuations stabilise multiple superconducting states. However, such phenomena
have remained elusive in high-temperature superconductors. Here we report the
discovery of robust field-induced re-entrant superconductivity in heavily
Eu-doped infinite-layer nickelate Sm$_{0.95-x}$Ca$_{0.05}$Eu$_x$NiO$_2$. In the
heavily over-doped regime, we observe a remarkable superconducting state that
emerges under high magnetic fields ($&gt;$ 6 Tesla) after the initial suppression
of zero-field superconductivity. Both zero-resistance transport and Meissner
diamagnetic effect confirm the superconducting nature of this high-field phase,
which persists up to at least 45 Tesla. This re-entrant behaviour is featured
by the coexistence of ferromagnetism and superconductivity on distinct
sublattices -- magnetic Eu$^{2+}$ ions and the Ni-O planes, respectively. Such
an exotic state may arise from the compensation between external and internal
exchange fields (Jaccarino-Peter effect) combined with magnetic
fluctuation-enhanced pairing near quantum criticality. Our findings establish
infinite-layer nickelates as a unique platform for high-temperature
ferromagnetic superconductivity, opening new avenues for discovering and
manipulating unconventional quantum phases in strongly correlated materials.

This study explores the optical properties of quantum dots doped with a
Ni$^{2+}$ ion that interacts with a charged exciton. Systematic magneto-optical
analysis reveals that the strain distribution at the Ni$^{2+}$ site
significantly influences its spin structure. In positively charged dots
dominated by in-plane biaxial strain, the three spins states of the Ni$^{2+}$
(S$_z$=0, S$_z$=$\pm$1) can be observed and the magneto-optical spectra enables
a local strain anisotropy to be determined. However, in most of the dots,
lower-symmetry strain mixes all the Ni$^{2+}$ spin states, thereby increasing
the number of observed optical transitions. In charged dots, we identify
optical transitions that share a common excited state. They form a series of
$\Lambda$ levels systems that can be individually addressed optically to
determine the energy level structure. Magneto-optical measurements demonstrate
that the hole-Ni$^{2+}$ exchange interaction is antiferromagnetic and
considerably stronger than the electron-Ni$^{2+}$ interaction. A spin-effective
model that incorporates local strain orientation can successfully reproduce key
experimental results. Furthermore, we demonstrate that low-symmetry terms in
the hole-Ni$^{2+}$ exchange interaction must be considered in order to
accurately describe the emission spectra details in a magnetic field.

We study many-body correlation functions within various Fundamental Measure
Theory (FMT) formulations and compare their predictions to Monte Carlo
simulations of hard-sphere fluids. FMT accurately captures key features of
three- and four-body structure, particularly at low and intermediate
wavevectors. We show that the dominant contributions to the four-point
structure factor arise from direct triplet correlations, allowing evaluation of
four-point correlations to be greatly simplified. In glass-forming liquids at
high volume fractions, FMT correctly reproduces deviations from the convolution
approximation, highlighting FMT's ability to capture growing structural
multipoint correlations upon supercooling.

### Universal winding properties of chiral active motion

We propose the area swept $A(t)$ and the winding angle $\Omega(t)$ as the key
observables to characterize chiral active motion. We find that the
distributions of the scaled area and the scaled winding angle are described by
universal scaling functions across all well-known models of active particles,
parametrized by the chirality $\omega$, along with a self-propulsion speed
$v_0$, and the persistence time $\tau$. In particular, we show that, at late
times, the average winding angle grows logarithmically with time $\la\Omega
\ra\sim(\omega\tau/2)\,\ln t$, while the average area swept has a linear
temporal growth $\la A(t)\ra\simeq(\omega\tau D_{\text{eff}})\,t$, where
$D_{\text{eff}}=v_0^2 \tau /[2(1+ \omega^2 \tau^2)]$ is the effective diffusion
coefficient. Moreover, we find that the distribution of the scaled area
$z=[A-\la A\ra]/(2D_{\text{eff}}t)$ is described by the universal scaling
function $F_{\text{ch}}(z)=\text{sech}(\pi z)$. From extensive numerical
evidence, we conjecture the emergence of a new universal scaling function
$G_{\text{ch}}(z)=\mathcal {N}/[e^{\alpha z} + e^{-\beta z}]$ for the
distribution of the scaled winding angle $z=\Omega/[\ln t]$, where the
parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are model-dependent and $\mathcal{N}$ is the
normalization constant. In the absence of chirality, i.e., $\omega=0$, the
scaling function becomes $G_{\text{ch}}(z)=(\alpha/\pi)\,\mathrm{sech}(\alpha
z)$.

The Eu-based EuA$_2$X$_2$ (A = Zn, Cd, In, Sn; X = P, As, Sb) family of
compounds has recently attracted significant attention as a promising platform
for exploring magnetic topological materials, with several members either
predicted or reported to exhibit nontrivial topological properties. We
investigate the previously reported topological semimetals, EuZn$_2$As$_2$ and
EuCd$_2$Sb$_2$, using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy,
complemented by various first-principles computational approaches. Through
examination of the cleaved surfaces, step-edges, and defect states, we
determine the trivial semiconducting behavior in both material systems, with no
evidence of topological surface or edge states. These experimental results are
consistent with our theoretical analysis revealing the absence of topological
band inversion in either system. Our experimental observations also reveal
numerous intrinsic defects that trap charge carriers. These defects may
facilitate the formation of magnetic polarons, providing a natural explanation
for the colossal negative magnetoresistance observed in many of the
EuA$_2$X$_2$ material systems.

### Real-space first-principles approach to orbitronic phenomena in metallic multilayers

We develop a real-space first-principles method based on density functional
theory to investigate orbitronic phenomena in complex materials. Using the
Real-Space Linear Muffin-Tin Orbital method within the Atomic Sphere
Approximation (RS-LMTO-ASA) combined with a Chebyshev polynomial expansion of
the Green's functions, we compute orbital (spin) Hall transport and orbital
(spin) accumulation directly in real space. The approach scales linearly with
system size and naturally incorporates disorder, finite-size effects, and
interface roughness. We apply the method to transition-metal-based
heterostructures and demonstrate the emergence of substantial orbital (spin)
accumulation, even in centrosymmetric systems. Our methodology provides a
scalable and flexible framework for realistic simulations of orbital transport
phenomena in complex heterostructures.

### Correlated phases in rhombohedral N-layer graphene

We investigate the emergence of correlated electron phases in rhombohedral
$N$-layer graphene due to two-valley Coulomb interactions within a low-energy
$k \cdot p$ framework. Analytical expressions for Lindhard susceptibilities in
intra- and intervalley channels are derived, and the critical temperatures for
phase transitions are estimated using both the random phase approximation (RPA)
and the parquet approximation (PA). Within RPA, only Stoner and intervalley
coherent (IVC) phases are supported, while the PA reveals a richer phase
structure including particle-particle (PP) channel instabilities. We establish
a general scaling law for the critical temperature with respect to layer number
$N$, highlighting an upper bound as $N \rightarrow \infty$, and demonstrate a
non-monotonic decrease of the critical temperature with increasing chemical
potential. The PA uncovers the role of interaction symmetry: $SU(4)$-symmetric
interactions favor intervalley Stoner order in the density channel, whereas
$SU(2) \times SU(2)$-symmetric interactions permit a broader set of phases. A
crossover in the dominant instability occurs in the particle-hole channel at a
critical layer number, suggesting the emergence of magnetic or IVC phases in
thicker systems. We also identify conditions under which pair-density wave
(PDW) order could form in the PP channel, though its physical realization may
be constrained.

Si/SiGe heterostructures on bulk Si substrates have been shown to host high
fidelity electron spin qubits. Building a scalable quantum processor would,
however, benefit from further improvement of critical material properties such
as the valley splitting landscape. Flexible control of the strain field and the
out-of-plane electric field $\mathcal{E}_z$ may be decisive for valley
splitting enhancement in the presence of alloy disorder. We envision the
Si/SiGe membrane as a versatile scientific platform for investigating
intervalley scattering mechanisms which have thus far remained elusive in
conventional Si/SiGe heterostructures and have the potential to yield
favourable valley splitting distributions. Here, we report the fabrication of
locally-etched, suspended SiGe/Si/SiGe membranes from two different
heterostructures and apply the process to realize a spin qubit shuttling device
on a membrane for future valley mapping experiments. The membranes have a
thickness in the micrometer range and can be metallized to form a back-gate
contact for extended control over the electric field. To probe their elastic
properties, the membranes are stressed by loading with a profilometer stylus at
room temperature. We distinguish between linear elastic and buckling modes,
each offering new mechanisms through which strain can be coupled to spin
qubits.

### On the electronic normal modes of the Meyer-Miller-Stock-Thoss representation of non-adiabatic dynamics

- **TL;DR**: 该研究分析了非绝热Matsubara动力学中电子变量截断对量子玻尔兹曼分布守恒的影响，发现MMST表示法中的电子正则模式不适合构建准确的QBD守恒方法。

Accurate and efficient simulation of non-adiabatic dynamics is highly
desirable for understanding charge and energy transfer in complex systems. A
key criterion for obtaining an accurate method is conservation of the Quantum
Boltzmann Distribution (QBD). For a single surface, Matsubara dynamics is known
to conserve the QBD, as a consequence of truncating the dynamics in the higher
normal modes of the imaginary-time path integral. Recently, a Non-Adiabatic
Matsubara (NA-Mats) dynamics has been proposed (J. Chem. Phys., 2021, 154,
124124) which truncates in the normal modes of the nuclear variables but not in
the electronic variables, which are described with the Meyer-Miller-Stock-Thoss
(MMST) representation. Surprisingly, this NA-Mats method does not appear to
conserve the QBD for a general system. This poses the question of the effect of
truncating the higher normal modes of the electronic variables in the MMST
representation. In this article, we present what we believe is the first study
of electronic normal modes of the MMST representation. We find that observables
are not usually a function of a finite number of normal modes and that the
higher normal modes are not constrained by the distribution, unlike in
conventional nuclear normal modes. While for an ensemble of trajectories,
truncation in MMST normal modes appears to numerically conserve the QBD, this
is not the case for a single trajectory. When considering a correlation
function, all MMST normal modes are required to obtain reasonable dynamics.
Overall, this suggests that MMST variables are not optimal for obtaining an
accurate, QBD conserving nonadiabatic dynamics method.

### Non-invertible symmetries out of equilibrium

Through the study of the Rep($D_8$) non-invertible symmetry, we show how
non-invertible symmetries manifest in dynamics. By considering the effect of
symmetry preserving disorder, the non-invertible symmetry is shown to give rise
to degeneracies in the spectra that can only be completely lifted at orders of
perturbation that scale with system size. The eigenstates of disordered
Hamiltonians, whose ground state correspond to non-trivial symmetry protected
topological (SPT) states, are shown to have either trivial or non-trivial SPT
order that are detected as non-zero expectation value of string
order-parameters. In contrast, non-trivial SPT order is absent in the
eigenstates of trivial SPT Hamiltonians with disorder. The interface between
two different SPT phases host edge modes whose dynamics is studied numerically
and analytically. The edge mode is shown to oscillate at frequencies related to
different effective chain lengths that are weighted by the temperature,
becoming an exact zero mode in the limit of zero temperature. A Floquet model
with the non-invertible symmetry is constructed whose edge mode is shown to
exhibit period-doubled dynamics at low effective-temperatures.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种Δ学习工作流，通过结合色散校正紧束缚基线和机器学习势能，为周期性系统生成具有CCSD(T)精度的原子间势能，解决了传统DFT方法化学精度不足的问题。

Machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) enable large-scale atomistic
simulations at moderate computational cost while retaining ab initio accuracy.
However, most MLIPs are trained on density-functional theory (DFT), which often
falls short of chemical accuracy (1 kcal/mol). Conversely, coupled-cluster
methods, particularly CCSD(T), which includes single, double, and perturbative
triple excitations, are considered the gold standard of computational chemistry
but rarely applied to periodic systems due to their huge computational cost.
Here we present a $\Delta$-learning workflow to produce interatomic potentials
with CCSD(T) accuracy for periodic systems including van der Waals (vdW)
interactions. The procedure combines a dispersion-corrected tight-binding
baseline with an MLIP trained on the differences of the target CCSD(T) energies
from the baseline. This $\Delta$-learning strategy enables training on compact
molecular fragments while preserving transferability. The dispersion
interactions are captured by including vdW-bound multimers in the training set;
together with the vdW-aware tight-binding baseline, the formally local MLIP
attains CCSD(T) accuracy for systems governed by long-range vdW forces. The
resulting potential yields root-mean-square energy errors below 0.4 meV/atom on
both training and test sets and reproduces electronic total atomization
energies, bond lengths, harmonic vibrational frequencies, and inter-molecular
interaction energies for benchmark molecular systems. We apply the method to a
prototypical quasi-two-dimensional covalent organic framework (COF) composed of
carbon and hydrogen. The COF structure, inter-layer binding energies, and
hydrogen absorption are analyzed at CCSD(T) accuracy. Overall, the developed
$\Delta$-learning approach opens a practical route to large-scale atomistic
simulations that include vdW interactions with chemical accuracy.

We present measurements of the cooling length $\ell_E$ for hot electrons in a
GaAs-based high mobility two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG). The thermal
measurements are performed on a long 60 $\mu$m-wide channel, which is
Joule-heated at one end, along which there are three similar hot-electron
thermocouples, spaced 30 $\mu$m apart. The thermocouples measure an
exponentially decaying temperature profile with a characteristic length
$\ell_E$, which decreases from 23 to 16 $\mu$m as the lattice temperature
increases from 1.8 to 5 K. From a simple one-dimensional model of heat
diffusion, we measure an inelastic scattering time which decreases from $\tau_i
\approx$ 0.36 to 0.18 ns. The measured $\tau_i$ has a magnitude and temperature
dependence consistent with acoustic phonon scattering times. We discuss how the
sample design can be varied for further thermal investigations. Knowledge of
the temperature profile and its gradient will prove useful in measurements of
the thermal conductivity and the Nernst effect.

We report a set of adiabatic potential energy surfaces (PESs) for
diiodomethane, including the ground electronic state and all excited states
accessible via single-photon absorption near 260 nm. Although constrained to
four dimensions, these PESs capture the essential photochemical processes
following photoexcitation--namely, bond breaking and rearrangement among the
methyl radical and the two iodine atoms. Constructed using an accurate and
efficient spline interpolation algorithm, the PESs reproduce local features
with high fidelity and exhibit overall smooth first-order derivatives, making
them suitable for molecular dynamics simulations, including non-adiabatic
dynamics. We identify key stationary points on the ground-state PES and on
three excited-state PESs, and map reaction pathways leading to
$\text{CH}_2\text{I}+\text{I}$ dissociation via the intermediate formation of a
$\text{CH}_2\text{I}$-$\text{I}$ isomer. A second photoisomerization pathway is
also confirmed, in which the molecule is initially photoexcited and then
undergoes a nonadiabatic transition to the ground state to form the isomer.
These PESs provide a valuable resource for molecular dynamics studies, enabling
detailed exploration of photochemistry in diiodomethane.

We have investigated the element specific magnetic characteristics of
single-crystal FeCr2S4 using x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and x-ray
magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD). We have found that the Fe L2,3-edge XAS
spectra do not exhibit clear multiplet structures, indicating strong
hybridization between the Fe 3d and S 3p orbitals, leading to delocalized
rather than localized electronic states. The Fe 3d and Cr 3d spin moments are
antiferromagnetically coupled, consistent with the Goodenough-Kanamori rule.
The orbital magnetic moments of Fe and Cr are determined to be -0.23 and -0.017
{\mu}B/ion, respectively. The large orbital magnetic moment of Fe is due to the
d6 configuration under the relatively weak tetrahedra crystal field at the Fe
site, and the delocalized Fe electrons maintain the orbital degree of freedom
in spite of their itinerant nature. To understand phenomena such as the
gigantic Kerr rotation, it is essential to consider not only the orbital
degrees of freedom but also the role of spin-orbit coupling, which induces a
finite orbital magnetic moment through t2 and e level hybridization under the
tetrahedral crystal field. This finite orbital moment serves as a direct
indicator of spin-orbit interaction strength and links element-specific orbital
magnetism to the large Kerr rotation. On the other hand, the octahedral
crystal-field splitting of the Cr 3d level is large enough to result in the
quenching of the orbital moment of the Cr ion in FeCr2S4.

Silver released from TRISO fuel particles can migrate through the SiC layer
and deposit on reactor components, posing radiation hazards and operational
challenges. Despite numerous proposed mechanisms, the precise pathway of silver
transport through intact 3C-SiC remains unresolved. We present a
physics-informed model for estimating the effective diffusivity of silver in
polycrystalline 3C-SiC. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations yield diffusivities
for {\Sigma 3} and {\Sigma 9} grain boundaries (GBs), while literature values
are used for other GB types and the bulk. These are combined using a
bounds-averaging approach accounting for distinct GB transport properties.
Bayesian inference of experimental data provides credible intervals for
effective Arrhenius parameters and reveals a correlation between activation
energy and pre-exponential factor. Although the homogenized model captures
GB-mediated transport mechanisms, it overpredicts silver diffusivity relative
to experiments. To resolve this, a multiplicative correction based on
reversible trapping at nano-pores is introduced. It is derived from first
principles and is shown to reproduce observed transport behavior. Sensitivity
analysis identified trap desorption energy and {\Sigma 9} GB diffusivity as
dominant factors influencing Ag transport. The resulting framework provides a
mechanistic description of Ag transport suitable for integration into
higher-scale fuel performance models.

Unconventional magnets with zero net magnetization yet momentum-dependent
spin splitting constitute a newly identified class of materials that provide a
rich platform for quantum-geometry-driven transport phenomena. Exploiting the
interplay between momentum translation and spin rotation, we uncover a distinct
linear transport response governed by a generalized quantum geometric tensor,
the Zeeman quantum geometric tensor (ZQGT). We show that the ZQGT drives a
linear intrinsic gyrotropic magnetic current (IGMC) in the three prototypical
two-dimensional unconventional magnets: a time-reversal-broken $d_{x^2 - y^2}$
altermagnet, a time-reversal-symmetric $p$-wave magnet, and a mixed $d$-wave
altermagnet. Depending on symmetry, these magnets exhibit longitudinal,
transverse, or combined conduction and displacement IGMCs in the presence of
spin-orbit coupling. Notably, this response persists even when conventional
Berry curvature contributions vanish, offering a unique probe of hidden
spin-split band structures of unconventional magnets. In particular, for mixed
$d$-wave altermagnets, symmetric Berry curvature and antisymmetric quantum
metric respectively generate longitudinal conduction IGMC and transverse
displacement IGMC- responses absent in conventional quantum geometry. The
predicted signatures, relevant to compounds such as RuO$_2$, CrSb, and MnTe,
provide experimentally accessible diagnostics for distinguishing unconventional
magnetic phases. These findings position the ZQGT as a powerful framework for
probing and controlling transport in next-generation quantum materials.

### Modeling oxygen-void interactions in uranium nitride

- **TL;DR**: 氧杂质通过降低氮化铀表面能促进辐照肿胀，主要机制是氧在表面氮位点的偏析，对小型空腔在中等温度下影响最显著

Oxygen impurities in uranium nitride (UN) are reported to influence its
swelling behavior under irradiation, yet the underlying mechanism remains
unknown. In this work, we develop a first-principles model that quantifies the
interaction of oxygen with voids and fission gas bubbles in UN, leading to a
reduction in surface energy that can promote swelling. The analysis reveals
that segregation of substitutional oxygen at surface nitrogen sites is the
primary driver of surface energy reduction, $|\Delta \sigma|$, while oxygen in
surface hollow sites plays a minor and sometimes counteracting role. $|\Delta
\sigma|$ is most pronounced for small cavities ($R_v$ = 1--10 nm) at
intermediate temperatures that coincide with the onset of breakaway swelling in
UN. Larger voids require higher temperatures for oxygen adsorption to
significantly lower their surface energy. The temperature dependence of
$|\Delta \sigma|$ exhibits three regimes: negligible reduction at low
temperatures due to sluggish oxygen diffusion, a maximum at intermediate
temperatures where oxygen incorporation is optimal, and a decline at high
temperatures due to enhanced bulk solubility. A parametric analysis reveals
that $|\Delta \sigma|$ depends strongly on both oxygen concentration and cavity
size, but is largely insensitive to porosity. Our results suggest that
oxygen-induced surface energy reduction is essential for reconciling the
mechanistic swelling model of UN with experimental observations.

- **TL;DR**: 提出通过磁梯度场将兆赫兹谐振器与核自旋耦合的方法，利用自旋系综的极化涨落来测量谐振器频率方差，实现单核自旋检测

Mechanical resonators operating in the megahertz range have become a
versatile platform for fundamental and applied quantum research. Their
exceptional properties, such as low mass and high quality factor, make them
also appealing for force sensing experiments. In this work, we propose a method
for detecting, and ultimately controlling, nuclear spins by coupling them to
megahertz resonators via a magnetic field gradient. Dynamical backaction
between the sensor and an ensemble of $N$ nuclear spins produces a shift in the
sensor's resonance frequency. The mean frequency shift due to the Boltzmann
polarization is challenging to measure in nanoscale sample volumes. Here, we
show that the fluctuating polarization of the spin ensemble results in a
measurable increase of the resonator's frequency variance. On the basis of
analytical as well as numerical results, we predict that the variance
measurement will allow single nuclear spin detection with existing resonator
devices.

### Gauge flux generations of weakly magnetized Dirac spin liquid in a kagomé lattice

Inspired by the recent progress on the Dirac spin liquid and the kagom\'{e}
lattice antiferromagnets, we revisit the U(1) Dirac spin liquid on the
kagom\'{e} lattice and consider the response of this quantum state to the weak
magnetic field by examining the matter-gauge coupling. Even though the system
is in the strong Mott insulating regime, the Zeeman coupling could induce the
internal U(1) gauge flux with the assistance of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
interaction. In addition to the perturbatively-induced non-uniform flux from
the microscopic interactions, the system spontaneously generates the uniform
U(1) gauge flux in a non-perturbative fashion to create the spinon Landau
levels and thus gains the kinetic energy for the spinon matters. Renormalized
mean-field theory is employed to validate these two flux generation mechanisms.
The resulting state is argued to be an ordered antiferromagnet with the
in-plane magnetic order, and the gapless Goldstone mode behaves like the
gapless gauge boson and the spinons appear at higher energies. The dynamic
properties of this antiferromagnet, and the implication for other
matter-gauge-coupled systems are discussed.

### Dynamic Vacancy Levels in CsPbCl3 Obey Equilibrium Defect Thermodynamics

Halide vacancies are the dominant point defects in perovskites with
$V_\mathrm{Cl}$ identified as a detrimental trap for the optoelectronic
performance of CsPbCl$_3$, with applications ranging from photodetectors to
solar cells. Understanding these defects under operating conditions is key
since their electronic levels exhibit large thermal fluctuations that challenge
the validity of static 0 K models. However, quantitative modelling of defect
processes requires hybrid density functional theory with spin-orbit coupling,
which is too expensive for direct molecular dynamic simulations. To address
this, we train a multi-task machine learning force field to study
$V_\mathrm{Cl}$ in orthorhombic CsPbCl$_3$ at 300 K.While we observe strong
oscillations in the optical transition level arising from the soft potential
energy surface, neither the non-radiative capture barriers nor the
thermodynamic charge transition levels are affected. Our results reveal that
$V_\mathrm{Cl}$ is not responsible for the non-radiative losses previously
assumed. Instead, its impact on performance arises from other mechanisms, such
as limiting the open-circuit voltage and promoting ionic migration. Our
findings demonstrate that, despite strong dynamical effects in halide
perovskites, the conventional static formalism of defect theory remains valid
for predicting thermodynamic behavior, providing a sound basis for the design
of high-performance energy materials.

### Controlling Skyrmion Lattice Orientation with Local Magnetic Field Gradients

Precise control over the formation and arrangement of magnetic skyrmion
lattices is essential for understanding their emergent behavior and advancing
their integration into spintronic and magnonic devices. We report on a simple
and minimally invasive technique to nucleate and manipulate skyrmion lattices
in soft magnetic CoFeB using single-pass magnetic force microscopy (MFM). By
tuning the scan-line spacing to match the intrinsic stripe domain periodicity,
the stray field gradient from the MFM tip induces reversible transitions from
stripe domains to isolated skyrmions and locally ordered lattices. The
resulting skyrmion positions are extracted to compute the local orientational
order parameter $\psi_6$, enabling quantitative evaluation of lattice ordering.
A systematic improvement in $\langle |\psi_6| \rangle$ is observed with
repeated scanning, indicating a transition from a disordered state to ordered
hexagonal lattices. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the lattice orientation
can be deterministically rotated by changing the scanning direction, as
confirmed by both real-space analysis and fast Fourier transformations. This
method enables the controlled creation, reordering, and deletion of metastable
skyrmion textures on demand. Our approach establishes a practical and
accessible platform for studying two-dimensional phase behavior in topological
spin systems, offering direct and reconfigurable control over lattice symmetry,
order, and orientation.

### Electron coherent phonon coupling in Pr$_{0.5}$Ca$_{1.5}$MnO$_4$ measured with ultrafast broadband spectroscopy

Photoexcitation of single-layered La$_{0.5}$Mn$_{1.5}$MnO$_4$ has played a
key role in understanding orbital ordering and non-thermal states in the
manganites. However, while orbital ordering in La$_{0.5}$Sr$_{1.5}$MnO$_4$
breaks the in-plane C$_4$ symmetry, many layered manganites show much more
complex phase diagrams in which orbital ordering emerges from an already
symmetry-broken high-temperature phase and also exhibit additional
low-temperature phases. In this work, we examine the role of these phases in
relation to orbital ordering in the single-layered manganite
Pr$_{0.5}$Ca$_{1.5}$MnO$_4$ with a combination of optical reflection anisotropy
and ultrafast broadband pump-probe spectroscopy. We find that the reflection
anisotropy, measured in equilibrium, is strongly sensitive to charge and
orbital-ordering transition only. However, the ultrafast response, measuring
the non-equilibrium state is sensitive to all phases. In particular, we deduce
that coherent phonons modulate unoccupied electronic states that are sensitive
to the different phases of the material. This gives rise to a non-linear
scaling of the phonon signal with pump fluence at specific probe wavelengths.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种改进的Thiele方法，通过引入更真实的涡旋磁化分布来半解析地提取陀螺和阻尼项，能够以低计算成本高保真地捕捉STVO动力学的关键非线性特性。

Understanding the nonlinear dynamics of magnetic vortices in spin-torque
vortex oscillators (STVOs) is essential for their application in neuromorphic
computing. Existing models either rely on the standard Thiele equation approach
(TEA), which offer only qualitative predictions, or on micromagnetic
simulations (MMS), which are computationally demanding. We present a refined
Thiele approach that incorporates the deformation of the vortex profile for the
evaluation of the gyrotropic and damping terms. In this manuscript, a more
realistic ansatz of the vortex magnetization profile is introduced to extract
these effective parameters semi-analytically. A method to extract the
gyrotropic and damping terms directly from MMS is also presented. The resulting
expressions are benchmarked against state-of-the-art analytical derivations,
and reveal a damping anisotropy of the vortex core. This framework captures the
essential nonlinearities of STVO dynamics with high fidelity at low
computational cost, paving the way for predictive modeling of large-scale
neuromorphic circuits based on STVOs.

### Anyon superfluidity of excitons in quantum Hall bilayers

- **TL;DR**: 该论文研究了量子霍尔双层系统中分数统计激子的超流性，提出了'anyonic exciton superfluidity'概念，并分析了其在拓扑相变附近的特性。

The charged anyons of a fractional quantum Hall fluid are necessarily
dispersionless due to the continuous magnetic translation symmetry. Neutral
anyons, however, can disperse, resulting in a much richer space of possible
``daughter'' states when doped to finite density. We discuss a natural
realization of such physics in quantum Hall bilayers, where a finite density of
excitons with fractional statistics is argued to give rise to `anyonic exciton
superfluidity,' the charge-neutral analog of anyon superconductivity. In a
balanced bilayer of two Laughlin $\nu = 1/3$ states, the minimal interlayer
exciton carries anyonic exchange statistics. A finite density of these excitons
is argued to yield an exciton superfluid stitched to a specific bulk
topological order and edge spectrum. Such superfluidity should be most robust
near the direct transition into the Halperin $(112)$ state, and near analogous
transitions in the bilayer Jain sequence at total filling $\nu_\text{T} =
2\times \frac{n}{2n+1}$. These topological transitions can be described by
Chern-Simons QED$_3$, from which we derive several novel and general properties
of anyon superfluidity near such transitions, including an anomalously large
superfluid stiffness of $\kappa_\text{s} \propto |\delta\nu|^{1/2}$ at layer
imbalance fraction $\delta\nu$. A notable feature of the phase diagrams we
construct is the prevalence of spatial symmetry breaking, driven by an
underlying composite Fermi surface. Our results can be directly tested with
currently available experimental techniques. We compare our theory with
existing data and make concrete predictions for future measurements, including
higher-pseudospin exciton superfluids when doping higher Jain fractions.

### Altermagnetic magnon transport in the \textit{d}-wave altermagnet \ch{LuFeO3}

Altermagnets exhibit a spin-split band structure despite having zero net
magnetization, leading to special magnonic properties such as anisotropic
magnon lifetimes and field-free spin transport. Here, we present a direct
experimental demonstration of non-local magnon transport in the \textit{d}-wave
altermagnet \ch{LuFeO3}, using both spin Seebeck and spin Hall effect-based
injection and detection. We observe a non-local spin signal at zero magnetic
field when the transport is along an altermagnetic direction, but not for
transport along other directions. The observed sign reversal between two
distinct altermagnetic directions in the spin Seebeck response demonstrates the
altermagnetic nature of the magnon transport. In contrast, when transport is
aligned along or perpendicular to the easy axis, both the first-harmonic signal
and the sign-reversal effect vanish, consistent with symmetry-imposed
suppression. These findings are supported by atomistic spin dynamics
simulations, as well as linear spin wave theory calculations, which explain how
our altermagnetic system hosts anisotropic spin Seebeck transport. Our results
provide direct evidence of direction-dependent magnon splitting in altermagnets
and highlight their potential for field-free magnonic spin transport, offering
a promising pathway for low-power spintronic applications.

We develop a microscopic theoryof the trion polaron: a bound state of two
electrons and one hole, dressed by longitudinal optical (LO) phonons. Starting
from the Frohlich Hamiltonian, which describes the interaction of charged
particles with LO phonons in three-dimensional (bulk) and two-dimensional
(monolayer) polar crystals, we adopt the intermediate coupling variational
approximation of Lee, Low, and Pines, and generalize it for the three-body
problem. This yields an effective three-particle Hamiltonian with renormalized
electron-electron and electron-hole interactions, similar to those obtained for
exciton polaron and bipolaron problems. We compute the binding energies for a
family of bulk perovskite materials and several atomic monolayer materials
characterized by pronounced polar effects, providing quantitative benchmarks
for spectroscopic measurements.

Processes involving severe plastic deformations (SPD) and phase
transformations and chemical reactions (PTs/CRs) under high pressures are
widespread for obtaining new nanostructured phases and their processing,
mechanochemical synthesis, military applications, and nature. SPD strongly
reduce the pressure required for PTs/CRs (by one-two orders of magnitude) and
PT hysteresis; lead to hidden metastable phases, which cannot be obtained
otherwise, and substitute reversible PTs/CRs with irreversible ones. This
review is devoted to breakthroughs in understanding multifaceted interactions
between high-pressure PTs/CRs, SPD, and microstructure evolution from the
viewpoint of advanced mechanics and thermodynamics of materials under stress
and plastic strain tensors. A novel concept of plastic strain-induced PTs/CRs
under high pressure is explored using four-scale theory and simulations (from
atomistic to nano- and scale-free phase-field approaches to macroscale) coupled
to in situ experiments in traditional and rotational diamond anvil cells, and
their integration. Its development revealed various phenomena and
misinterpretations, resolved numerous puzzles, found the first general rules in
these fields, and suggested ways for economic defect-induced synthesis of
high-pressure phases and nanostructures. Coupled
analytical/computational/experimental approaches are developed for complete
characterization of occurring processes and finding all heterogeneous scalar
and tensorial fields. Applications include high-pressure torsion, surface
treatment, high-pressure tribology, PTs/CRs in shear bands leading to severe
transformation/reaction-induced plasticity and self-blown-up processes,
mechanisms of deep-focus earthquakes, the appearance of microdiamonds in
low-pressure-temperature Earth crust, and the mechanochemical origin of life
beyond Earth. Unresolved problems and future directions are outlined.

The study of Eu intermetallic compounds has allowed the exploration of
valence fluctuations and transitions in 4f electron systems. Recently, a
Eu$_2$Pt$_6$Al$_{15}$ phase synthesized by arc-melting followed by a thermal
treatment was reported [M. Radzieowski \textit{et al.}, J Am Chem Soc 140(28),
8950-8957 (2018)], which undergoes a transition upon cooling below 45~K that
was interpreted as a valence transition from Eu$^{2+}$ to Eu$^{3+}$. In this
paper, we present the discovery of another polymorph of Eu$_2$Pt$_6$Al$_{15}$
obtained by high-temperature solution growth, that presents different physical
properties than the arc-melted polycrystalline sample. Despite the similarities
in crystal structure and chemical composition, the Eu valence transition is
almost fully suppressed in the solution-grown crystals, allowing the moments
associated with the Eu$^{2+}$ state to order antiferromagnetically at around
14~K. A detailed analysis of the crystal structure using single crystal X-ray
diffraction reveals that, although the solution grown crystals are built from
the same constituent layers as the arc-melted samples, these layers present a
different stacking. The effect of different thermal treatments is also studied.
Different anneal procedures did not result in significant changes of the
intrinsic properties, and only by arc-melting and quenching the crystals we
were able to convert them into the previously reported polymorph.

Sodium-ion batteries are a cost-effective and sustainable alternative to
lithium-ion systems for large-scale energy storage. Hard carbon (HC) anodes,
composed of disordered graphitic and amorphous domains, offer high capacity but
exhibit complex, poorly understood ion transport behavior. In particular, the
relationship between local microstructure and sodium mobility remains
unresolved, hindering rational performance optimization. Here, we introduce a
data-driven framework that combines machine-learned interatomic potentials with
molecular dynamics simulations to systematically investigate sodium diffusion
across a broad range of carbon densities and sodium loadings. By computing
per-ion structural descriptors, we identify the microscopic factors that govern
ion transport. Unsupervised learning uncovers distinct diffusion modes,
including hopping, clustering, and void trapping, while supervised analysis
highlights tortuosity and NaNa coordination as primary determinants of
mobility. Correlation mapping further connects these transport regimes to
processing variables such as bulk density and sodium content. This
physics-informed approach establishes quantitative structure-transport
relationships that capture the heterogeneity of disordered carbon. Our findings
deliver mechanistic insights into sodium-ion dynamics and provide actionable
design principles for engineering high-performance HC anodes in next-generation
battery systems.

Electron-phonon coupling is a key interaction that governs diverse physical
processes such as carrier transport, superconductivity, and optical absorption.
Calculating such interactions from first-principles with methods beyond
density-functional theory remains a challenge. We introduce here a
finite-difference framework for computing electron-phonon couplings for any
electronic structure method that provides eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and
showcase applications for hybrid and Koopmans functionals, and $GW$ many-body
perturbation theory. Our approach introduces a novel projectability scheme
based on eigenvalue differences and bypasses many of the limitations of the
direct finite difference methods. It also leverages symmetries to reduce the
number of independent atomic displacements, thereby keeping computational costs
manageable. This approach enables seamless integration with established
first-principles codes for generating displaced supercells, performing Wannier
interpolations, and evaluating transport properties. Applications to silicon
and gallium arsenide show that advanced electronic-structure functionals
predict different electron-phonon couplings and modify band curvatures,
resulting in much more accurate estimates of intrinsic carrier drift mobilities
and effective masses. In general, our method provides a robust and accessible
framework for exploring electron-phonon interactions in complex materials with
state-of-the-art electronic structure methods.
