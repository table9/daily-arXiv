- **TL;DR**: 本文研究绝缘体性质的不同度量指标之间的关系，发现在特定无序条件下会出现一种新型超介电相，具有金属和绝缘体的混合特性。

We study the relationship between the quantities that encode the insulating
properties of matter: the ground-state quantum metric, the average localization
length, and the electric susceptibility. By examining the one-dimensional
Anderson insulator model and the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain with chiral
disorder, we demonstrate that the former two measures are proportional in
one-dimensional systems near criticality, and both are determined by the
properties of the hybridized localized states around the Fermi energy. We
employ these insights to demonstrate that the behavior of the electric
susceptibility is drastically different in the bond-disordered SSH chain, with
the possibility that it may diverge even when the localization length and the
quantum metric remain finite. This divergence, caused by the proliferation of
impurity resonances at a particular energy, leads to a novel regime that
exhibits mixed characteristics of metals and insulators. We term this regime
superdielectric: an insulating state characterized by a finite quantum metric
and divergent static electric susceptibility, which implies perfect screening
in the absence of the dc conductivity. We demonstrate that the superdielectric
phase also emerges in higher-dimensional materials, such as graphene with
vacancies and Kekul\'e bond distortion.

### Entropy-Seebeck ratio as a tool for elementary charge determination

- **TL;DR**: 本研究探讨了塞贝克系数与微分熵粒子比之间的关系，发现两者在带隙能量区域高度关联，其比值收敛于基本电荷e，验证了开尔文公式S=s/e。

In this work, we investigate the relationship between the Seebeck coefficient
$(S)$, and the differential entropy per particle (DEP, $s$), as a tool for
characterizing charge carriers in two-dimensional systems. Using armchair
silicene nanoribbons as a model platform, we analyze how both quantities and
their ratio depend on chemical potential at room temperature. While the Seebeck
coefficient captures transport properties through the energy dependence of the
electronic transmission, the DEP is directly connected to the system's
electronic entropy, offering a direct thermodynamic alternative for estimating
$S$. We evaluate these transport-thermodynamic properties considering diverse
ribbon widths, defining metallic and semiconducting regimes. We find both
quantities $S$ and $s$, are highly interconnected within the ribbon's band gap
energy region, and their ratio $s/S$ converges to the elementary charge $e$
across that energy window, fulfilling the Kelvin formula $S=s/e$. On the
contrary, $s/S$ is undefined for gapless ribbons in the energy window of the
first transmission channel. These results establish the ratio between the DEP
and the Seebeck coefficient as a reliable and complementary probe for the
determination of the elementary charge, and to identify the cleanness of
electronic band gaps as $s/S$ matches with $e$.

### Bending nanoribbon to induce large anisotropic magnetoconductance

- **TL;DR**: 弯曲纳米带在磁场中会产生几何诱导的各向异性磁导效应，磁导率变化可达100%以上，且在室温弱磁场下稳定存在

When a nanoribbon is bent under a homogeneous external magnetic field, the
effective magnetic field inside becomes either homogeneous or inhomogeneous,
depending on the direction of the field. This enables the selective creation of
bulk, interface, and edge magnetic states in the bent structure, for a magnetic
field with a strength. We establish theoretically that these tuneable states
lead to a strong geometry-induced anisotropic magnetoconductance (GAMC) in
perpendicularly bent nanoribbon, which can reach up to 100\%. Moreover, the
GAMC can be further enhanced to 200\%, 300\%, or even higher by either further
bending or tuning the bending angle. The potential of this phenomenon for
practical applications is demonstrated by its stable anisotropy, which remains
consistent across a wide range of Fermi energies, can be observed even at weak
magnetic fields and room temperature, and occurs in various systems such as
two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) and graphene.

### Quantum Geometric Renormalization of the Hall Coefficient and Unconventional Hall Resistivity in ZrTe5

The anomalous Hall effect (AHE), conventionally associated with time-reversal
symmetry breaking in ferromagnetic materials, has recently been observed in
nonmagnetic topological materials, raising questions about its origin. We
unravel the unconventional Hall response in the nonmagnetic Dirac material
ZrTe5, known for its massive Dirac bands and unique electronic and transport
properties. Using the Kubo-Streda formula within the Landau level framework, we
explore the interplay of quantum effects induced by the magnetic field (B) and
disorder across the semiclassical and quantum regimes. In the semiclassical
regime, the Hall resistivity remains linear in the magnetic field, but the Hall
coefficient will be renormalized by the quantum geometric effects and
electron-hole coherence, especially at low carrier densities where the disorder
scattering dominates. In quantum limit, the Hall conductivity exhibits an
unsaturating 1/B scaling. As a result, the transverse conductivity dominates
transport in the ultra-quantum limit, and the Hall resistivity crosses over
from B to B^{-1} dependence as the system transitions from the semiclassical
regime to the quantum limit. This work elucidates the mechanisms underlying the
unconventional Hall effect in ZrTe5 and provides insights into the AHE in other
nonmagnetic Dirac materials as well.

### GEN2: A Generative Prediction-Correction Framework for Long-time Emulations of Spatially-Resolved Climate Extremes

- **TL;DR**: GEN2是一个生成式预测-校正框架，用于高效准确地预测极端事件统计。它结合条件高斯模拟器和非高斯机器学习校正，能在单一训练场景下准确预测不同气候情景的极端事件统计。

Accurately quantifying the increased risks of climate extremes requires
generating large ensembles of climate realization across a wide range of
emissions scenarios, which is computationally challenging for conventional
Earth System Models. We propose GEN2, a generative prediction-correction
framework for an efficient and accurate forecast of the extreme event
statistics. The prediction step is constructed as a conditional Gaussian
emulator, followed by a non-Gaussian machine-learning (ML) correction step. The
ML model is trained on pairs of the reference data and the emulated fields
nudged towards the reference, to ensure the training is robust to chaos. We
first validate the accuracy of our model on historical ERA5 data and then
demonstrate the extrapolation capabilities on various future climate change
scenarios. When trained on a single realization of one warming scenario, our
model accurately predicts the statistics of extreme events in different
scenarios, successfully extrapolating beyond the distribution of training data.

### Theoretical Study of Impurity Effects on Superconductivity in UTe2

- **TL;DR**: 本研究通过自洽玻恩近似和六轨道f-d-p模型，分析了不同配对对称性下UTe2超导转变温度对杂质浓度的依赖性，发现杂质在U位点的位置对Tc变化起主导作用，杂质磁性性质对识别配对对称性至关重要

This study investigates the impurity effects on UTe2 within the
self-consistent Born approximation using the six-orbital f-d-p model which
contains two uranium and tellurium atoms in the minimum unit cell. We analyze
the dependence of superconducting transition temperature (Tc) on impurity
concentration for various pairing symmetries proposed by experiments and
theories. It clarifies that the decrease of Tc significantly depends on which
atom sites the impurities reside. Particulalry, the analysis shows that the
impurity at U-site has dominant effect on the change of Tc. Then, either the
singlet state in the case of magnetic impurities or the triplet states in both
non-magnetic and magnetic impurities are consistent with experiments. Thus,
this indicates that elucidating the magnetic properties of impurities (i.e.
magnetic or non-magnetic) is crucial for identifying the pairing symmetry of
UTe2.

### Beyond Superexchange: Emergent Unconventional Ferromagnetism in Thin-Film Sandwich Structures of Intrinsic Magnetic Topological Insulators

- **TL;DR**: 研究人员通过异质结构和夹心结构实验，发现Mn(Bi1-xSbx)2Te4系统中存在强烈的层间磁作用，并推断磁性质可能来自于拓扑学相关的van Vleck和Bloembergen-Rowland机制，而非传统的直接交换或超交换作用。

In this work, we investigate the nature of magnetic interactions in intrinsic
magnetic topological insulator Mn(Bi1-xSbx)2Te4 (MBST in short) systems, which
possesses highly-ordered ferromagnetic septuple-layers (SLs), using two types
of structures: MBST(1 SL)/(Bi1-xSbx)2Te3 heterostructures and MBST(1
SL)/(Bi1-xSbx)2Te3/MBST(1 SL) sandwich structures. The out-of-plane
magnetization in the sandwich structure turned out to be significantly larger
than that in the heterostructure, indicating that the interlayer magnetic
interaction between two MBST layers is ferromagnetic. Furthermore, the Curie
temperature increased with decreasing the in-plane Mn-Mn distance in the MBST
layer, which suggests the enhancement of the intralayer ferromagnetic
interaction within each MBST layer. Meanwhile, in the sandwich structures with
various spacer thicknesses, the Curie temperature with the spacer layer was
higher than that with no spacer layer. In addition, the curve shape of
anomalous Hall effects for the sandwich structure was almost unchanged by
carrier-density modulation, which implies that the ferromagnetism in this
system is carrier-independent. Based on the above results, magnetic behaviors
in our systems cannot be explained only by the direct exchange nor
superexchange interactions reported previously for MBST systems, and are
instead proposed to arise from topology-related mechanisms such as the van
Vleck and Bloembergen-Rowland mechanisms. This work provides a new perspective
on magnetic mechanisms in MBST systems, which helps us to realize
next-generation spintronic and electronic devices by flexibly controlling
magnetism in intrinsic magnetic topological insulators.

### Obstacle-tuned transition from chaotic to coherent vortex flows and odd diffusion in chiral active fluids

The interaction of a suspension of rotating colloids with a periodically
patterned structure is here investigated by means of continuum theoretical
predictions and hydrodynamic simulations. Close to the obstacle surface, rotors
circulate opposite to their inherent direction of rotation as a result of
unidirectional rotational stresses, which is in agreement with a prediction of
the generalised Stokes equation. The resulting stationary background flow
significantly affects the system dynamics and coexists with the intrinsic
active turbulent behaviour. The relative importance of either of the two
contributions can be controlled with the rotor density and the obstacle size,
such that the system is either dominated by stationary vortices pinned to the
obstacles or vivid active turbulent dynamics. While momentum dissipation into
an underlying frictional substrate damps the related flows, small values of the
friction can enhance the vortex flow around an obstacle. The colloids'
diffusive dynamics are governed by odd diffusive fluxes guiding the colloids
around the excluded volume introduced by obstacles, such that enhanced
effective diffusive transport is obtained at finite obstruction. Our results
pave the way to systematically address how confinement can be employed in order
to control or harness the dynamics of colloidal chiral active turbulence and
how the interplay of emerging edge currents and active turbulent dynamics at
varying densities can be systematically determined.

### Thermodynamics of dilute anyon gases from fusion constraints

- **TL;DR**: 该论文提出了一个有限温度下任意子气体的统计力学通用理论，适用于稀薄弱相互作用任意子体系，基于任意子排斥原理和通用编织融合数据构建分布函数和热力学可观测量。

Recent measurements on 2d materials tuning between fractional quantum
anomalous Hall phases and a plethora of correlated electronic states call for a
detailed understanding of the dynamics of anyons. Here we develop a general
theory of the statistical mechanics of anyon gases at finite temperature, valid
in regimes where the anyons are sufficiently dilute and can be treated as
weakly interacting particles. We find that with a minimal set of universal
braiding and fusion data, along with information about the hierarchy of anyon
gaps, it is possible to construct a distribution function for any dilute anyon
gas, as well as derive thermodynamic observables. Our results are built on an
anyon exclusion principle manifesting as a constraint on fusion outcomes of
physical states. Our approach unifies and streamlines a range of results for
itinerant anyon models, from solvable lattice Hamiltonians to large-N field
theories.

### A novel framework for disinfection analisys in drinking water networks

- **TL;DR**: 提出基于二阶动力学模型的新框架，分析饮用水管网中消毒剂与管道内壁有机化合物的反应机制，包括水流冲刷反应和管壁局部反应，支持水质管理。

Disinfection in drinking water networks is performed to ensure water safety
and potability. However, disinfectants can react with organic compounds present
in the water networks. The reaction of disinfectants with such compounds
generates byproducts that could be dangerous for human health. The compounds
are generally endogenous, i.e., adhered or/and released by the pipe wall, and
not introduced from reservoirs because water utilities efficiently monitor and
manage their water quality. The present effort, starting from the relevant
scientific literature, proposes a novel framework which is based on analysing
the disinfectant consumption using a second order kinetic model. The novel
framework allows analysing the two endogenous mechanisms of compounds
reactions: the first mechanism refers to compounds detached by the momentum of
water flow and reacting into the bulk while transported by flow, the second one
refers to local reaction at wall. The use of a chemically based second order
kinetic model, furthermore, allows for emphasizing the role of stoichiometry
and reaction rate constants of reactants and byproducts as relevant parameters
to be evaluated at laboratory scale for the specific water system. Thus, the
proposed framework can effectively support water quality management using
monitoring data together with hydraulic modelling. Two real water distribution
systems, located in southern Italy and managed by Acquedotto Pugliese, were
used as case studies: the small-sized network of Monteparano and the
large-sized one of Bari.

### Rotating Spin Wave Modes in Nanoscale Möbius Strips

Curved and topologically nontrivial magnetic structures offer new pathways to
control spin-wave behavior beyond planar geometries. Here, we study spin-wave
dynamics in M\"obius-shaped soft-magnetic nanostrips using micromagnetic
simulations. By comparing single-, double-, and triple-twisted M\"obius strips
to a topologically trivial bent ring, we isolate the roles of helical twist and
non-orientable topology. M\"obius geometries exhibit non-degenerate mode
doublets associated with counterpropagating spin waves, in contrast to the
standing-wave doublets in the trivial case. This splitting arises from a
twist-induced geometric (Berry) phase that breaks propagation symmetry,
producing non-reciprocal dispersion relations. The M\"obius topology further
imposes antisymmetric boundary conditions, resulting in half-integer wavelength
quantization. Local RF excitation allows for the selective generation of spin
waves with defined frequency and direction. An analytical model reproduces the
dispersion behavior with excellent agreement. These results highlight how
geometric and topological design can be leveraged to engineer spin-wave
transport in three-dimensional magnonic systems.

### Bridging the Analog and the Probabilistic Computing Divide: Configuring Oscillator Ising Machines as P-bit Engines

- **TL;DR**: 提出了将振荡器伊辛机配置为概率比特引擎的理论框架，通过一阶和二阶谐波注入的新颖相互作用实现功能，拓展了两种方法的协同应用范围

Oscillator Ising Machines (OIMs) and probabilistic bit (p-bit)-based
computing platforms have emerged as promising paradigms for tackling complex
combinatorial optimization problems. Although traditionally viewed as distinct
approaches, this work presents a theoretically grounded framework for
configuring OIMs as p-bit engines. We demonstrate that this functionality can
be enabled through a novel interplay between first- and second harmonic
injection to the oscillators. Our work identifies new synergies between the two
methods and broadens the scope of applications for OIMs. We further show that
the proposed approach can be applied to other analog dynamical systems, such as
the Dynamical Ising Machine.

### Quantum-size effect induced Andreev bound states in ultrathin metallic islands proximitized by a superconductor

- **TL;DR**: 通过高分辨率扫描空空镜技术在NbN超导体上的超薄金属岛屼中直接观测到了安德列夫绑定态，显示了量子尺度效应和空间振荡特征

While Andreev bound states (ABSs) have been realized in engineered
superconducting junctions, their direct observation in normal
metal/superconductor heterostructures-enabled by quantum confinement-remains
experimentally elusive. Here, we report the detection of ABSs in ultrathin
metallic islands (Bi, Ag, and SnTe) grown on the s-wave superconductor NbN.
Using high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, we
clearly reveal in-gap ABSs with energies symmetric about the Fermi level. While
the energies of these states show no position dependence, their wave functions
exhibit spatial oscillations, demonstrating a quantum size effect. Both the
energy levels and spatial distribution of the ABSs can be reproduced by our
effective model in which a metallic island is coupled to the superconducting
substrate via the proximity effect. We demonstrate that the coupling strength
plays a critical role in determining the ABS energies. Our work introduces a
novel physical platform for implementing ABSs, which hold promise for
significant device applications.

### Probing Magnetic Properties of RuO$_{2}$ Heterostructures Through the Ferromagnetic Layer

- **TL;DR**: RuO₂作为典型altermagnetic材料的地位受到质疑，实验显示其磁有序可能源于与铁磁层界面效应而非本征特性

RuO$_{2}$ has been proposed as the prototypical altermagnetic material.
However, several reports have recently questioned its intrinsic magnetic
ordering, leading to conflicting findings, especially in thin film
heterostructures pointing to possible interface effects being convoluted with
supposed antiferromagnetic/altermagnetic signatures. Here, extensive
magnetometry measurements were performed on two independently grown thin film
heterostructures of RuO$_{2}$ interfaced with either NiFe or Fe acting as the
ferromagnetic layer. Below about 15 K, both samples exhibit exchange bias
fields when cooled to approximately 2 K in a $+$1 T field, and a spin
transitional feature is observed around 31 K. Magneto-Raman measurements on
RuO$_{2}$ thin films only reveal a magnon mode when there is a NiFe layer,
suggesting that RuO$_{2}$ does not intrinsically possess long range magnetic
ordering.. When in contact with a ferromagnet, RuO$_2$ displays effects that
could be ascribed to antiferromagnetism. However, the lack of intrinsic magnon
modes points toward possible diffusion between the layers or spin disorder at
the interface as seen by density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

The transient behaviours of a Blume-Capel ferromagnetic needle have been
studied extensively by Monte-Carlo simulation. The needle has an elongated
length in one direction compared to its cross-section. In the context of
transient behaviour, we have captured the decay of the metastable state and the
magnetic relaxation behaviours in our study. The dependence of metastable
behaviour with anisotropy (single site) has been studied. \emph{Interestingly,
we have observed multiple (different values of $n$ in different time domains)
crossover in the decay of metastable volume fraction (obeying Avrami's law
$\beta \sim {\rm exp}(-Kt^n)$). We have identified the crossover time, and the
values of $n$ are estimated precisely.} The mean (magnetic) reversal time has
been studied as a function of anisotropy. It is observed to be almost
independent of anisotropy for its negative value; however, it is found to
decrease exponentially with positive anisotropy. The exponential relaxation
behaviour (in the corresponding paramagnetic phase) is observed. The range of
the relaxation time is observed to decrease as the temperature increases.

### The beginning of the endpoint bootstrap for conformal line defects

- **TL;DR**: 通过数值监策技术研究3d Ising CFT中的符合线缺陷，获得了与模糊球正则化相一致的缺陷CFT数据，并提供了缺陷不稳定性的近似严格证据

A challenge in the study of conformal field theory (CFT) is to characterize
the possible defects in specific bulk CFTs. Given the success of numerical
bootstrap techniques applied to the characterization of bulk CFTs, it is
desirable to develop similar tools to study conformal defects. In this work, we
successfully demonstrate this possibility for endable conformal line defects.
We achieve this by incorporating the endpoints of a conformal line defect into
the numerical four-point bootstrap and exploit novel crossing symmetry
relations that mix bulk and defect CFT data in a way that further possesses
positivity, so that rigorous numerical bootstrap techniques are applicable. We
implement this approach for the pinning field line defect of the $3d$ Ising
CFT, obtaining estimates of its defect CFT data that agree well with other
recent estimates, particularly those obtained via the fuzzy sphere
regularization. An interesting consequence of our bounds is nearly rigorous
evidence that the $\mathbb Z_2$-symmetric defect exhibiting long range order
obtained as a direct sum of two conjugate pinning field defects is unstable to
domain wall proliferation.

### Impact of ligand (OH) deformation on LuOH$^+$ rovibrational spectra

- **TL;DR**: 本文通过从头计算研究LuOH⁺三原子阳离子的电子结构和振动转动结构，发现配体变形会降低弯曲频率并增加l-双重分裂常数，为寻找CP破坏物理提供了可行平台

Triatomic cation $^{175}$LuOH$^+$, featuring near-degenerate, opposite-parity
$l$-doublets, offers enhanced sensitivity to $\mathcal{P}$- and
$\mathcal{T}$-violating interactions. We present \emph{ab initio} calculations
of its electronic structure and rovibrational structure beyond the rigid-ligand
approximation by explicitly including OH-ligand deformation together with
bending and stretching motions. Potential-energy surfaces are computed at the
relativistic coupled cluster level of theory. The nuclear Schr\"{o}dinger
equation in Jacobi coordinates is solved by means of a coupled-channel
expansion. Ligand deformation reduces the bending frequency by a few percent
and increases the $l$-doubling constant $q$, while the stretching frequencies
and rotational constants remain largely unchanged. For the first excited
bending level, we predict $\Delta E_{J=1}=2q \approx 24.9$--$26.4$ MHz. These
results establish LuOH$^+$ as a viable platform for precision searches for
$\mathcal{CP}$-violating physics via the electron electric dipole moment and
the nuclear magnetic quadrupole moment.

- **TL;DR**: 提出一种利用热激活斯格明子和霍尔效应交叉结构可靠检测单个移动斯格明子的方法，通过实时霍尔电压信号与克尔显微镜成像的相关性验证了检测可靠性

Magnetic skyrmions, topologically stabilized spin textures, are promising
candidates for future memory devices and non-conventional computing
applications due to their enhanced stability, non-linear interactions, and
low-power manipulation capabilities. Despite their significant potential, the
reliable electrical readout of individual skyrmions remains a fundamental
challenge. While magnetic tunnel junctions and anomalous-Hall-effect-based
techniques have demonstrated skyrmion detection capabilities, they currently
fail to reliably detect single moving skyrmions as required for applications.
Our approach leverages thermally activated skyrmions, where a low constant
drive current simultaneously generates both skyrmion motion and the Hall
voltage necessary for detection. We demonstrate the reliability of this method
through real-time correlation between measured Hall voltage signals and direct
Kerr microscopy imaging. Two consecutive Hall crosses allow for determining the
skyrmion velocity, in accordance to Kerr microscopy videos. These advances
establish a robust platform for skyrmion-based sensors, counters and
unconventional computing systems that depend on precise individual skyrmion
control and detection.

- **TL;DR**: 在kagome超导体CsV3Sb5中实现了量子整流效应，通过超导体二极管效应和AC Josephson效应将无线电频转换为量子化直流电压输出

Rectification of electromagnetic fields into direct current (DC) is pivotal
for energy harvesting, wireless charging, and next-generation communication
technologies. The superconducting diode effect, which exploits the
nonreciprocal transport of dissipationless superconducting currents, offers
ultra-low power consumption and high rectification ratios. Combining the
superconducting diode effect with the AC Josephson effect holds promise for
converting radio-frequency (rf) irradiation into a quantized DC output.
However, experimental realization has been hindered by challenges in achieving
the necessary symmetry breaking and fabricating high-performance Josephson
junctions. Here we demonstrate the quantum rectification in kagome
superconductor CsV3Sb5, which hosts emergent Josephson effects and a zero-field
Josephson diode. Under rf irradiation, a DC voltage emerges without applied
bias, scaling linearly with frequency as V = hf/2e, where h is Planck's
constant, f is the microwave frequency, and e is the electron charge.
Furthermore, the rectified voltage exhibits quantized steps with increasing rf
power, consistent with Shapiro step quantization. Our work establishes CsV3Sb5
as a versatile platform for wireless quantum power supplies and charging, and
underscores the intertwined order parameters as a promising pathway for precise
quantum matter control.

- **TL;DR**: 开发了基于半谐振子哈密顿量的第一性原理模型，用于预测固体在中高温下的热容，无需拟合参数即可获得与实验数据相符的结果，并证明了Maier-Kelley经验公式的理论基础。

The heat capacity of solids at intermediate-to-high temperatures is of
fundamental importance to several fields ranging from geology to material
science. It depends on a variety of factors, with anharmonicity and,
ultimately, melting playing a pivotal role. In this work we develop a
first-principles model from an analytically tractable semi-harmonic oscillator
Hamiltonian. The resulting specific heat expression depends not only on the
Einstein temperature of the material but also on other physical parameters. We
compare our predictions with experimental data for copper, aluminum, lead,
silicon, and germanium with rather satisfactory results, especially considering
that there are no fitting parameters in our theory. We finish this work by
showing that our results formally justify the otherwise purely empirical
formula by Maier and Kelley, also providing its coefficients in terms of
elementary physical quantities.

### Flow Matching at Scale: A Machine Learning Framework for Efficient Large-Size Sampling of Many-Body Systems

We propose a machine learning framework based on Flow Matching to overcome
the scaling limitations of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. We
demonstrate its capability in the 2D XY model, where a single network, trained
only on configurations from a small ($32\times 32$) lattice at sparse
temperature points, generates reliable samples for a significantly larger
system ($128\times 128$) across a continuous temperature range without
retraining. The generated configurations show strong agreement with key
thermodynamic observables and correctly capture the signatures of the
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition. This dual generalization is
enabled by the Flow Matching framework, which allows us to learn a continuous,
temperature-conditioned mapping. At the same time, the inductive biases of the
underlying CNN architecture ensure that the learned local physical rules are
scale-invariant. This "train-small, generate-large" capability establishes a
new paradigm for efficiently studying critical phenomena, offering a
significant computational advantage for exploring the thermodynamic limit. The
method can be directly applied to other classical or quantum many-body systems
described by continuous fields on a lattice.

We study bulk photovoltaic effects in electron-phonon coupled systems. The
conservation of current or gauge invariance, manifested as the Ward-Takahashi
identity, plays an essential role in the analysis of the Feynman diagrams, and
the leading order contribution to the phonon shift current is identified
accordingly. The leading order contribution essentially arises from the
electric polarization carried by optically excited phonons, where the shift
current is generated due to a change of electric polarization in the steady
state under the optical excitation of phonons.

### Re-Engineering Hematite: Synergistic Co-Doping Routes to Efficient Solar Water Splitting

Solar-driven water electrolysis requires high-performance photoelectrodes
that exhibit excellent photoabsorption, superior charge transport, and
optimized thermal management. In this work, we conducted a first-principles
investigation to explore optimized doping conditions for hematite
($\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$) by incorporating boron (B), yttrium (Y), and niobium
(Nb) mono-dopants, as well as (B, Y) and (B, Nb) co-dopants. To identify the
optimal dopant elements and concentrations, we evaluated electronic charge
transport, thermal properties, and magnetic susceptibility over a temperature
($T$) range of 300 to 900 K and doping densities ($N$) from $10^{19}$ to
$10^{21}$ cm$^{-3}$. The B-doped, (B, Y)-doped, and (B, Nb)-doped
$\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ photoelectrodes showed significantly reduced band gap
energy ($E_g$) relative to $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$. In comparison, Y and Nb
dopants only slightly reduced $E_g$ relative to $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$. While B
doping introduced impurity states near the Fermi level that limited
thermoelectric charge transport, $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ photoelectrodes doped by
other elements exhibited notable improvements, including enhanced visible-light
absorption, increased carrier concentration, improved electrical conductivity
($\sigma$), and efficient thermal management. Additionally, these doped
photoelectrodes exhibited a remarkable increase in Pauli magnetic
susceptibility ($\chi$) by two orders of magnitude compared to pristine
$\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$, indicating exciting potential for generating
spin-selective polarized currents. Overall, our findings revealed that the
co-doping conditions are the most effective for enhancing the performance of
$\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$, providing a low-cost and high-efficiency solution for
sustainable green hydrogen (H$_2$) generation in photocatalytic water
splitting.

### Optimizing energy conversion with nonthermal resources in steady-state quantum devices

We provide a framework for optimizing energy conversion processes in coherent
quantum conductors fed by nonthermal resources. Such nonthermal resources,
which cannot be characterized by temperatures or electrochemical potentials,
occur in small-scale systems that are smaller than their thermalization length.
Using scattering theory in combination with a Lagrange multiplier method, we
optimize the device's performance based on the efficiency, precision, or a
trade-off between the two at a given output current. The transmission
properties leading to this optimal performance are identified. We showcase our
findings with the example of a refrigerator exploiting experimentally relevant
nonthermal resources, which could result from competing environments or from
light irradiation. We show that the performance is improved compared to a
device exploiting a thermal resource. Our results can serve as guidelines for
the design of energy-conversion processes in future nanoelectronic devices.

### Investigating the sliding behavior of graphene nanoribbons

- **TL;DR**: 这篇论文开发了一种欧拉-伯努利梁有限元模型，用于研究石墨烯纳米带在石墨烯基底上的层间相互作用机理，重点分析边界条件对滑动行为和应变传递的影响。

This work presents a Euler-Bernoulli beam finite element (FE) model to study
the interlayer interaction mechanics of graphene nanoribbon (GNR) over a
graphene substrate. The FE model is calibrated using molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations employing the potential of Kolmogorov and Crespi. This study
focuses mainly on the effect of boundary conditions on sliding behavior and
strain transfer between layers when the substrate is subjected to uniform
biaxial deformations. The interlayer shearing or sliding behavior is found to
depend on the presence of critical parameters, namely, the applied strain to
the substrate and the length of the GNR. The FE results indicate that the
applied strain transferred from the substrate to the GNR varies linearly up to
a critical value ec beyond which it decreases suddenly. Further, ec is found to
appear beyond a critical GNR length, Le is approximately 10 nm. Furthermore, a
length parameter Ld is approximately 10 nm is computed, beyond which the
sliding of GNR is dissipative. Through FE simulations, it is also found that
for a GNR length is greater than or equal to 17 nm, the edge pulling force
saturates. Our results also highlight the importance of the inertia of GNR on
its sliding for different boundary conditions. It is also concluded that the
maximum strain that can be transferred to GNR lies between 0.57% and 1.15%. The
results of the FE approach align with MD simulations within an error of
approximately 10% that can be attributed to the choice of material parameters
and the simulation setup.

The ambient-pressure superconductivity in
$\mathrm{La}_{3}\mathrm{Ni}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{7}$ thin films via compressive
epitaxial strain provides a highly accessible platform for diverse
characterization techniques, facilitating the studies of high-temperature
superconductivity. Here, we systematically map the superconducting dome in
compressively strained
$\mathrm{La}_{3-x}\mathrm{Sr}_{x}\mathrm{Ni}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{7-\delta}$ thin
films by simultaneously tuning Sr doping and oxygen content and reveal an
electron-hole crossover associated with the maximum transition temperature
(${T}_{c}$). This electron-hole crossover, marked by an anomalous sign change
in the Hall coefficient (${R}_{H}$), is reminiscent of electron-doped cuprates,
which may signal a Fermi surface reconstruction. Beyond the superconducting
dome, a $\ln1/T$ insulating regime and a $T$-linear resistivity regime are also
resolved, resembling behaviors observed in cuprates and infinite-layer
nickelates. This work reveals a dome-shaped relationship between ${T}_{c}$ and
${R}_{H}$ and establishes a key framework for understanding unconventional
superconductivity in nickelate systems.

Machine learning surrogates of Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory
Hamiltonians offer a powerful tool to accelerate the prediction of electronic
properties of materials, such as electronic band structures and
densities-of-states. For large-scale applications, an ideal model would exhibit
high generalization ability and computational efficiency. Here, we introduce
the MACE-H graph neural network, which combines high body-order message passing
with a node-order expansion to efficiently obtain all relevant $O(3)$
irreducible representations. The model achieves high accuracy and computational
efficiency and captures the full local chemical environment features of,
currently, up to $f$ orbital matrix interaction blocks. We demonstrate the
model's accuracy and transferability on several open materials benchmark
datasets of two-dimensional materials and a new dataset for bulk gold,
achieving sub-meV prediction errors on matrix elements and eigenvalues across
all systems. We further analyse the interplay of high body order message
passing and locality that makes this model a good candidate for high-throughput
material screening.

### Analytical Theory of Chiral Active Particle Transport in a Fluctuating Density Field

- **TL;DR**: 开发了三维手性活性布朗粒子在密度波动场中传输的闭式解析理论，揭示了手性和密度耦合如何重新定向持久性并产生动力学交叉效应

We develop a closed-form analytical theory for the transport of a chiral
active Brownian particle (cABP) in three dimensions, moving through a
fluctuating local density field that coarse-grains steric and dynamical
interactions in a dense active medium. The density field is modeled as an
Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process with finite correlation time $\tau$ and fluctuation
strength $\sigma_\rho^2$, capturing both spatial variations and temporal
memory. Within this framework, we derive exact expressions for the mean-squared
displacement (MSD) and time-dependent diffusivity, showing how chirality and
density coupling renormalize orientational persistence and generate dynamical
crossovers. The theory predicts: (i) anomalously high initial diffusivity in
denser regions, arising from a transient drift driven by local swim-pressure
gradients; (ii) a finite crossover time $t_c$ for homogenizing density
inhomogeneities, with steady-state diffusivity retaining memory of the initial
environment; (iii) a non-monotonic $t_c(\Omega)$ with a global minimum at
intermediate chirality, and a three-regime suppression of $D_\infty(\Omega)$
consistent with clustered phases in simulations; and (iv) a resonance-like peak
in early-time oscillatory transport at an optimal chirality $\Omega^*$. The
framework reproduces known scaling of $D_\infty$ with activity and chirality,
while uncovering new memory effects and chirality-controlled optimal transport,
offering predictive insight for biological circle swimmers and active
metamaterials.

We present a new constrained Random Phase Approximation (cRPA) method, termed
spectral cRPA (s-cRPA), and compare it to established cRPA approaches for
Scandium and Copper by varying the 3d shell filling. The s-cRPA consistently
yields larger Hubbard $U$ interaction values. Applied to the realistic system
CaFeO$_3$, s-cRPA produces interaction parameters significantly closer to those
required within DFT+$U$ to induce the experimentally observed insulating state,
overcoming the metallic behavior predicted by standard density functionals. We
also address the issue of negative interaction values found in the projector
cRPA method for filled d-shells, demonstrating that s-cRPA offers superior
numerical stability through electron conversion. Overall, s-cRPA is more robust
and effectively overcomes the known underestimation of $U$ in standard cRPA,
making it a promising tool for the community. Additionally, we have enhanced
our implementation with features for computing multi-center interactions to
analyze spatial decay and developed a low-scaling variant with a compressed
Matsubara grid to efficiently obtain full frequency-dependent interactions.

Montmorillonite, a ubiquitous clay mineral, plays a vital role in geochemical
and environmental processes due to its chemically complex edge surfaces.
However, the molecular-scale acid-base reactivity of these interfaces remains
poorly understood due to the limitations of both experimental resolution and
conventional simulations. Here, we employ machine learning potentials with
first-principles accuracy to perform nanosecond-scale molecular dynamics
simulations of montmorillonite nanoparticles across a range of pH. Our results
reveal clear amphoteric behavior: edge sites undergo protonation in acidic
environments and deprotonation in basic conditions. Even at neutral pH,
spontaneous and directional proton transfer events are common, proceeding via
both direct and solvent-mediated pathways. These findings demonstrate that
montmorillonite edges are not static arrays of hydroxyl groups but dynamic,
proton-conducting networks whose reactivity is modulated by local structure and
solution conditions. This work offers a molecular-level framework for
understanding proton transport and buffering in clay-water systems, with broad
implications for catalysis, ion exchange, and environmental remediation.

- **TL;DR**: 本研究通过三维弹性波传播建模，揭示了齿鲸在没有外耳廓的情况下能够精确定位声源的机制，发现声音通过头部组织传播后在耳周复合体处产生的时间域波形相关性可用于声源定位

The sound-localization and, in particular, biosonar system of toothed whales
is exceptionally performant. How this is achieved is not clear, given that: (i)
toothed whales have no pinnae; (ii) while their auditory pathways have been
studied in detail, no specific feature apparently replacing the pinna has been
identified. In this study, we employ a pseudo-spectral time domain (PSTD)
numerical scheme to model three-dimensional elastic wave propagation through a
toothed-whale head including soft tissues. Computed tomography (CT) scans were
utilized to build a three-dimensional velocity-density model of the specimen's
head, parametrized on a high-resolution $1.11$ mm voxel grid. We first validate
our wave propagation solver, identifying a range of frequencies and spatial
scale lengths where the PSTD scheme captures the complexities of elastic wave
propagation through toothed-whale anatomy. We next focus on the toothed whale's
ability to locate sources on the median plane, where the role of anatomy is
crucial. A 45 kHz central frequency burst (dolphin-like click) was modeled and
directed at elevation angles from $-90^\circ$ to $+90^\circ$ in $5^\circ$ steps
along the midsagittal plane. We find that the incoming sound can be localized,
via correlation, from the reverberated portion of the time-domain waveforms
recorded at the tympano-periotic complex locations.

### Superpotentials, flat bands and the role of Quantum Geometry for the superfluid stiffness

We investigate the stability and enhancement of superconductivity in a system
subject to a 2D periodic superpotential. This externally imposed modulation
leads to a reconstructed multi-band structure with flat bands emerging in
certain energy regions. When the chemical potential is tuned into one of these
flat bands, the associated increase in the density of states can strongly
enhance the superconducting critical temperature Tc compared to the homogeneous
case while maintaining the superfluid stiffness Ds at a sizeable value. We also
clarify the role of the quantum geometric effect for flat bands in such
topologically trivial systems. While the overall paramagnetic interband
contribution to the stiffness is negative we identify a class of certain
interband scattering processes which enhance Ds and scale with the interaction,
playing therefore the same role as quantum geometric effects in conventional
flat band models. The enhancement of superconductivity is found to be robust
against weak to moderate disorder, suggesting that the system is not overly
sensitive to imperfections which is an important prerequisite for experimental
realizations. Our results demonstrate that engineered superpotentials offer a
compelling alternative to twist-based moire systems, providing a pathway toward
tailoring superconductivity via lithographic design.

This work explores erbium-doped calcium molybdate (CaMoO$_4$) thin films
grown on silicon and yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) substrates, as a
potential solid state system for C-band (utilizing the $\sim$1.5 $\mu$m
Er$^{3+}$ 4f-4f transition) quantum emitters for quantum network applications.
Through molecular beam epitaxial growth experiments and electron microscopy,
X-ray diffraction and reflection electron diffraction studies, we identify an
incorporation limited deposition regime that enables a 1:1 Ca:Mo ratio in the
growing film leading to single phase CaMoO$_4$ formation that can be in-situ
doped with Er (typically 2-100 ppm). We further show that growth on silicon
substrates is single phase but polycrystalline in morphology; while growth on
YSZ substrates leads to high-quality epitaxial single crystalline CaMoO$_4$
films. We perform preliminary optical and microwave characterization on the
suspected $Y_1 - Z_1$ transition of 2 ppm, 200 nm epitaxial CaMoO$_4$ annealed
thin films and extract an optical inhomogeneous linewidth of 9.1(1) GHz, an
optical excited state lifetime of 6.7(2) ms, a spectral diffusion-limited
homogeneous linewidth of 6.7(4) MHz, and an EPR linewidth of 1.10(2) GHz.

When used to describe \textit{finite} systems the {conjugate}
statistical-mechanical ensembles are \textit{not} equivalent. This has physical
implications for the behavior of the fluctuation induced forces pertinent to
the different ensembles. Here, {we study the Nagle-Kardar model within the
grand-canonical ensemble (GCE) and the canonical ensemble (CE) (with conserved
total magnetization) for periodic boundary conditions (PBC)}. {We focus on two
fluctuation-induce forces: the Casimir force (CF) in the GCE and the Helmholtz
force (HF) in the CE}. In the infinite system limit the model exhibits a
critical line, which ends at a tricritical point. Unexpectedly, the critical
Casimir force (CCF) is \textit{repulsive} near the critical line and
tricritical point, decaying rapidly upon departure from those two regions and
becoming \textit{attractive}. This violates the widely-accepted ``boundary
condition rule,'' which presumes that the CCF is attractive for equivalent
boundary conditions (BC) and repulsive for conflicting BC. For the HF we find
that it also changes sign as a function of temperature and the magnetization.
We conclude, that CCF and HF have a behavior quite different from each other as
a function of the tunable parameters (temperature, magnetic field, or
magnetization) of the model. This dependence allows {for the control of the}
\textit{sign} of these forces, as well as their magnitude.

- **TL;DR**: 通过门电压调控SrTiO3基界面二维电子气的非互逆运输和异常震勒效应，实验证明了Rashba磁性的存在和可调控性

The broken inversion symmetry at interfaces of complex oxides gives rise to
emergent phenomena, including ferromagnetism and Rashba spin-orbit coupling
(SOC), which profoundly influence the electronic structure by entangling spin
and momentum. While the interplay between Rashba SOC and ferromagnetism is
theoretically intriguing, its experimental manifestations remain largely
unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that ferromagnetic 2DEGs at SrTiO$_3$-based
interfaces exhibit spontaneous nonreciprocal transport - a distinctive hallmark
of Rashba ferromagnets - even in the absence of an external magnetic field.
This nonreciprocal response, along with clear signatures of ferromagnetism such
as anisotropic magnetoresistance and the anomalous Hall effect (AHE), is
strongly tunable by gate voltage. Remarkably, the AHE not only varies in
amplitude but even reverses sign, reflecting a subtle interplay between Fermi
level position and Berry curvature distribution. These results establish
SrTiO$_3$ 2DEGs as a model platform for studying Rashba ferromagnetism and
demonstrate active control over transport phenomena in time- and
inversion-symmetry-broken systems, paving the way for gate-tunable spintronic
devices.

- **TL;DR**: 通过震动和频洒气产生光谱技术直接比较水气界面和体直水的电场强度，发现界面电场并不比体直水强，反对了当前认为界面强电场可以催化化学反应的观点

The notion that large electric fields at the air-water interface catalyze
spontaneous chemical reactions has sparked significant debate, with far
reaching implications for atmospheric chemistry and interfacial reactivity.
Using vibrational sum frequency generation spectroscopy, we test this
hypothesis by directly comparing local electric field strengths at the
air-water interface and in bulk water. By applying established vibrational
frequency-to-field mappings to the OH stretch of interfacial and bulk water, we
extract effective electric field distributions under ambient conditions.
Contrary to prevailing claims, our results reveal no spectroscopic evidence for
exceptionally strong or long-lived interfacial electric fields. Instead, bulk
water consistently exhibits broader distributions and statistically larger
field magnitudes. The absence of key spectral signatures, such as redshifted
continua, or slowed spectral diffusion, further undermines the idea of
anomalous surface fields. Our findings call into question the growing narrative
that electrostatic forces at pristine and charge neutral water surfaces can
drive chemical reactions and instead highlight the importance of rigorous
spectroscopic benchmarks when evaluating interfacial phenomena.

### Second Harmonic Generation by Multilayer Graphenes and its Dependence on Stacking Order and Encapsulation Environment

In this work, we analyze the effects of external influences on the second
harmonic generation (SHG) signal produced by multilayer graphenes.
Specifically, we vary the encapsulation conditions and doping of graphenes,
seeking to identify SHG "fingerprints" that are unsensitive to external
perturbations. We identify characteristic features in the infrared regime that
may be used as a stacking-order fingerprint for the mixed stacking tetralayer
and the trilayer polytypes caused by a strong double resonance effect. Further
to this, we find that the tetralayers systematically produce an SHG response
that is significantly larger as compared to the trilayers. We then studied the
SHG signal by the tetralayer polytypes in the terahertz regime and demonstrated
the signal is highly sensitive the environmental conditions. Furthermore, we
also find that accidental doping of graphene will strongly suppress the SHG
signal in this regime. The above findings emphasize the need for a spectral
approach to the identification of stacking order by SHG. Thus, measurements at
one frequency are insufficient to confidently identify the stacking order due
to the environmental sensitivities, since SHG can be readily induced with a
comparable magnitude in the centrosymmetric polytypes through external
symmetry-breaking.

### Unraveling Shear Strain Induced Ferroelectric-to-Antiferroelectric Phase Transition and Accessing Intrinsic Antiferroelectricity in Two-dimensional NbOCl2

Compared to the well studied two-dimensional (2D) ferroelectricity, much rare
is the appearance of 2D antiferroelectricity, where local dipoles from the
nonequivalent sublattices within 2D monolayers are oppositely orientated. Using
NbOCl2 monolayer with competing ferroelectric (FE) and antiferroelectric (AFE)
phases as a 2D material platform, we demonstrate the emerging of intrinsic
antiferroelectricity in NbOCl2 monolayer under the experimentally accessible
shear strain, and new functionality associated with electric field induced
AFE-to-FE phase transition. Specifically, the complex configuration space
accommodating FE and AFE phases, polarization switching kinetics and finite
temperature thermodynamic properties of 2D NbOCl2, are all accurately predicted
by large-scale molecular dynamic (MD) simulations based on deep learning
interatomic potential (DP) model. Moreover, room temperature stable
antiferroelectricity with low polarization switching barrier and
one-dimensional (1D) collinear polarization arrangement is predicted in shear
deformed NbOCl2 monolayer. Transition from AFE to FE phase in 2D NbOCl2 can be
triggered by the low critical electric field, leading to the double
polarization-electric (P-E) loop with small hysteresis. A new type
optoelectronic device composed of AFE-NbOCl2, enabling electric "writing" and
nonlinear optical "reading" logical operation with fast operation speed and low
power consumption is also proposed.

### From Near-Integrable to Far-from-Integrable: A Unified Picture of Thermalization and Heat Transport

- **TL;DR**: Error

Whether and how a system approaches equilibrium is central in nonequilibrium
statistical physics, crucial to understanding thermalization and transport.
Bogoliubov's three-stage (initial, kinetic, and hydrodynamic) evolution
hypothesis offers a qualitative framework, but quantitative progress has
focused on near-integrable systems like dilute gases. In this work, we
investigate the relaxation dynamics of a one-dimensional diatomic hard-point
(DHP) gas, presenting a phase diagram that characterizes relaxation behavior
across the full parameter space, from near-integrable to far-from-integrable
regimes. We analyze thermalization (local energy relaxation in nonequilibrium
states) and identify three universal dynamical regimes: (i) In the
near-integrable regime, kinetic processes dominate, local energy relaxation
decays exponentially, and the thermalization time $\tau$ scales as $\tau
\propto \delta^{-2}$. (ii) In the far-from-integrable regime, hydrodynamic
effects dominate, energy relaxation decays power-law, and thermalization time
scales linearly with system size $N$. (iii) In the intermediate regime, the
Bogoliubov phase emerges, characterized by the transition from kinetic to
hydrodynamic relaxation. The phase diagram also shows that hydrodynamic
behavior can emerge in small systems when sufficiently far from the integrable
regime, challenging the view that such effects occur only in large systems. In
the thermodynamic limit, the system's relaxation depends on the order in which
the limits ($N \to \infty$ or $\delta \to 0$) are taken. We then analyze heat
transport (decay of heat-current fluctuations in equilibrium), demonstrating
its consistency with thermalization, leading to a unified theoretical
description of thermalization and transport. Our approach provides a pathway
for studying relaxation dynamics in many-body systems, including quantum
systems.

Altermagnetism, an unconventional magnetic phase characterized by zero net
magnetism and a spin-split electronic band, has been studied exclusively in
conventional crystalline materials. In this work, we extend the theoretical
framework of altermagnetism to quasicrystals (QCs), which lack translational
symmetry. We classify magnetic phases in 2D QCs with $n$-fold rotational
symmetry without spin-orbit coupling, by using the irreducible representation
(IRRP) of the $D_n$ point group. Based on symmetry analysis, we propose the
conjecture that magnetic phases corresponding to 1D non-identity IRRPs are
generally altermagnetic, with the exception of those possessing parity-time
symmetry. To verify our conjecture, we take the Hubbard model as an example and
develop a systematic approach to determine the magnetic pattern in the QC,
which effectively avoids getting trapped at local energy minima. Consequently,
our tests for the Hubbard model on various QCs with different symmetries are
unexceptionally consistent with our proposal. Our work highlights the QC as a
platform where the altermagnetism is common among magnetic phases.

We present GridFF, an efficient method for simulating molecules on rigid
substrates, derived from techniques used in protein-ligand docking in
biochemistry. By projecting molecule-substrate interactions onto precomputed
spatial grids with tricubic B-spline interpolation, GridFF reduces the
computational cost by orders of magnitude compared to traditional pairwise
atomistic models, without compromising the accuracy of forces or trajectories.
The CPU implementation of GridFF in the open-source FireCore package provides a
100-1000x speedup over all-atom simulations using LAMMPS, while the GPU
implementation - running thousands of system replicas in parallel - samples
millions of configurations per second, enabling an exhaustive exploration of
the configuration space of small flexible molecules on surfaces within minutes.
Furthermore, as demonstrated in our previous application of a similar technique
to high-resolution scanning probe microscopy, GridFF can be extended beyond
empirical pairwise potentials to those derived from ab initio electron
densities. Altogether, this unlocks accurate high-throughput modeling of
molecular self-assembly, adsorption, and scanning probe manipulation in surface
science.

Transformer models and end-to-end learning frameworks are rapidly
revolutionizing the field of artificial intelligence. In this work, we apply
object detection transformers to analyze charge stability diagrams in
semiconductor quantum dot arrays, a key task for achieving scalability with
spin-based quantum computing. Specifically, our model identifies triple points
and their connectivity, which is crucial for virtual gate calibration, charge
state initialization, drift correction, and pulse sequencing. We show that it
surpasses convolutional neural networks in performance on three different spin
qubit architectures, all without the need for retraining. In contrast to
existing approaches, our method significantly reduces complexity and runtime,
while enhancing generalizability. The results highlight the potential of
transformer-based end-to-end learning frameworks as a foundation for a
scalable, device- and architecture-agnostic tool for control and tuning of
quantum dot devices.

Layered transition metal oxides typified by the Ruddlesden-Popper phase have
been extensively studied for its applications in high-temperature
superconductivity, catalysis, and battery technologies. Despite the remarkable
structural diversity and catalytic functionality of platinum oxides, the
exploration of layered polymorphs has remained significantly constrained mainly
due to the high inertness of platinum. Here, we discover a new homologous
series of layered ternary oxides, Na(PtO$_2$)$_{2\it{n}+1}$, by a combination
of highly oxidizing high-pressure methods and density functional theory (DFT)
calculations. This series features unprecedented layered structural motifs,
rutile-based PtO$_6$ octahedra and one-dimensional PtO$_4$ square-planar
columns, which enables systematic control of dimensionality. Furthermore, we
demonstrate a computationally-assisted identification of isomeric and putative
members of this homologous series as confirmed by controlled synthesis and
quantitative analysis of diffuse scattering data. This approach provides an
effective platform for the exhaustive exploration of metastable transition
metal oxides with rich structural variations.

We investigate the landscape of many-body memories: families of local
non-equilibrium dynamics that retain information about their initial conditions
for thermodynamically long time scales, even in the presence of arbitrary
perturbations. In two dimensions, the only well-studied memory is Toom's rule.
Using a combination of rigorous proofs and machine learning methods, we show
that the landscape of 2D memories is in fact quite vast. We discover memories
that correct errors in ways qualitatively distinct from Toom's rule, have
ordered phases stabilized by fluctuations, and preserve information only in the
presence of noise. Taken together, our results show that physical systems can
perform robust information storage in many distinct ways, and demonstrate that
the physics of many-body memories is richer than previously realized.

Uncertainty quantification is an important scheme in active learning
techniques, including applications in predicting quantum chemical properties.
In quantum chemical calculations, there exists the notion of a fidelity, a less
accurate computation is accessible at a cheaper computational cost. This work
proposes a novel low-fidelity informed uncertainty quantification for active
learning with applications in predicting diverse quantum chemical properties
such as excitation energies and \textit{ab initio} potential energy surfaces.
Computational experiments are carried out in order to assess the proposed
method with results demonstrating that models trained with the novel method
outperform alternatives in terms of empirical error and number of iterations
required. The effect of the choice of fidelity is also studied to perform a
thorough benchmark.

### Orientation dependent anomalous Hall and spin Hall currents at the junctions of altermagnets with $p$-wave magnets

We study charge and spin transport across a junction between an altermagnet
(AM) and a $p$-wave magnet (PM) using a continuum model with boundary
conditions tailored to the spin-split band structures of the two materials.
Remarkably, although neither AM nor PM is spin-polarized, we find that the
junction supports finite spin currents both longitudinally and transversely. We
compute the longitudinal and transverse charge and spin conductivities as
functions of the crystallographic orientations and the relative angle between
the N\'eel vectors of AM and PM. Our results reveal that transverse charge and
spin conductivities can be finite even when the longitudinal charge
conductivity vanishes. For suitable parameter choices and orientation angles,
the transverse conductivities are more prominent than the longitudinal ones.
The origin of these effects lies in the matching and mismatching of transverse
momentum modes ($k_y$) across the junction combined with the spin-dependent
band splitting in AM and PM. Furthermore, while the transverse charge
conductivity may cancel for certain orientations, the transverse spin
conductivity remains finite due to unequal contributions of opposite $k_y$
channels. These findings highlight altermagnet/$p$-wave magnet junctions as a
promising platform for tunable generation and control of transverse charge and
spin currents driven purely by crystallographic orientation and spin structure.

### The effect of multi-occupancy traps on the diffusion and retention of multiple hydrogen isotopes in irradiated tungsten and vanadium

We propose a computational scheme for the diffusion and retention of multiple
hydrogen isotopes (HI) with multi-occupancy traps parameterized by first
principles calculations. We show that it is often acceptable to reduce the
complexity of the coupled differential equations for gas evolution by taking
the dynamic steady state, a generalisation of the Oriani equilibrium for
multiple isotopes and multi-occupancy traps. The effective gas diffusivity
varies most with mobile fraction when the total gas concentration approximates
the trap density. We show HI binding to a monovacancy in vanadium produces a
non-monotonic dependence between diffusivity and gas concentration, unlike the
tungsten system. We demonstrate the difference between multiple single
occupancy traps and multi-occupancy traps in long-term diffusion dynamics. The
applicability of the multi-occupancy, multi-isotope model in steady state is
assessed by comparison to an isotope exchange experiment between hydrogen and
deuterium in self-ion irradiated tungsten. The vacancy distribution is
estimated with molecular dynamics, and the retention across sample depth shows
good agreement with experiment using no fitting parameters.

A new approach is proposed to assess the reliability of the truncated
wavefunction methods by estimating the deviation from the full configuration
interaction (FCI) wavefunction. While typical multireference diagnostics
compare some derived property of the solution with the ideal picture of a
single determinant, we try to answer a more practical question, how far is the
solution from the exact one. Using the density matrix renormalization group
(DMRG) method to provide an approximate FCI solution for the self-consistently
determined relevant active space, we compare the low-level CI expansions and
one-body reduced density matrixes to determine the distance of the two
solutions ($\tilde{d}_\Phi$, $\tilde{d}_\gamma$). We demonstrate the
applicability of the approach for the CCSD method by benchmarking on the W4-17
dataset, as well as on transition metal-containing species. We also show that
the presented moderate-cost, purely wavefunction-based metric is truly unique
in the sense that it does not correlate with any popular multireference
measures. We also explored the usage of CCSD natural orbitals
($\tilde{d}_{\gamma,\mathrm{NO}}$) and its effect on the active space size and
the metric. The proposed diagnostic can also be applied to other wavefunction
approximations, and it has the potential to provide a quality measure for
post-Hartree-Fock procedures in general.

Kosterlitz-Thouless-Halperin-Nelson-Young (KTHNY) theory. While 2D melting in
skyrmion systems has been demonstrated, achieving controlled ordering in
skyrmion lattices remains challenging due to pinning effects from a non-uniform
energy landscape, which often results in polycrystalline structures. Skyrmions
in thin films, however, offer thermal diffusion with high tunability and can be
directly imaged via Kerr microscopy, enabling real-time observation of their
dynamics. To regulate lattice order in such flexible systems, we introduce
geometric confinements of varying shapes. Combining Kerr microscopy experiments
with Thiele model simulations, we demonstrate that confinement geometry
critically influences lattice order. Specifically, hexagonal confinements
commensurate with the skyrmion lattice stabilize monodomain hexagonal ordering,
while incommensurate geometries induce domain formation and reduce overall
order. Understanding these boundary-driven effects is essential for advancing
the study of 2D phase behavior and for the design of skyrmion-based spintronic
applications, ranging from memory devices to unconventional computing
architectures.

- **TL;DR**: 通过模仿生物的砖磨结构设计，在保持压电性能的同时显著提高了无铂Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3瓷瓷的机械强度、断裂粘性和疲劳耐受性

Durable, high-performance and eco-friendly lead-free piezoceramics are
essential for next-generation sustainable energy transducers and
electromechanical systems. While significant performance enhancements have been
made, through chemical composition, texture, or crystal defects, piezoceramics
are intrinsically weak mechanically, which negatively impact their working
conditions and durability. What's more, improving comprehensive mechanical
durability without sacrificing piezoelectric performance remains a key
challenge. Here, we design bioinspired Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3 (BNT) ceramics using a
scalable colloidal process that enables multiscale control over the
microstructure. The design comprises plate-like monocrystalline BNT bricks
stacked to induce a crystallographic texture along the poling direction, bonded
together by a silica-based mortar, forming the brick-and-mortar phase. This
deliberate microstructure design yields 2- to 3-fold increase in flexural
strength, and 1.6- to 2-fold increase in fracture toughness compared with a BNT
synthesized conventionally, comparable to common structural ceramics, without
sacrificing the piezoelectric performance. In addition, the bioinspired BNT
exhibit dramatically enhanced ferroelectric fatigue resistance, with a 40- to
600-folds improvement in the number of field-induced electromechanical cycles
before failure. These gains stem from residual stress fields generated at the
interface between silica pockets and BNT bricks, which delay crack initiation.
Furthermore, we demonstrated enhanced transducing capability and
electromechanical fatigue resistance using a cantilever beam-based
piezoelectric transducer under bending mode. Given its
non-chemical-compositional origin, this bioinspired strategy could be broadly
applicable to other piezoelectric material systems for applications where both
functional and structural performance are critical.

- **TL;DR**: 开发了两个软件库metatensor和metatomic，用于弥合传统原子模拟软件与现代机器学习框架之间的差距，促进机器学习在原子尺度建模中的应用

Incorporation of machine learning (ML) techniques into atomic-scale modeling
has proven to be an extremely effective strategy to improve the accuracy and
reduce the computational cost of simulations. It also entails conceptual and
practical challenges, as it involves combining very different mathematical
foundations, as well as software ecosystems that are very well developed in
their own merit, but do not share many commonalities. To address these issues
and facilitate the adoption of ML in atomistic simulations we introduce two
dedicated software libraries. The first one, metatensor, provides
cross-platform and cross-language storage and manipulation of arrays with many
potentially sparse indices, designed from the ground up for atomistic ML
applications. By combining the actual values with metadata that describes their
nature and that facilitates the handling of geometric information and gradients
with respect to the atomic positions, metatensor provides a common framework to
enable data sharing between ML software - typically written in Python - and
established atomistic modeling tools - typically written in Fortran, C or C++.
The second library, metatomic, provides an interface to store an atomistic ML
model and metadata about this model in a portable way, facilitating the
implementation, training and distribution of models, and their use across
different simulation packages. We showcase a growing ecosystem of tools, from
low-level libraries, training utilities, to interfaces with existing software
packages that demonstrate the effectiveness of metatensor and metatomic in
bridging the gap between traditional simulation software and modern ML
frameworks.

### Competition Between Controllable Non-Radiative and Intrinsic Radiative Second-Order Recombination in Halide Perovskites

- **TL;DR**: 该研究揭示了卤化物钙钛矿太阳能电池中二阶非辐射复合的起源和影响，发现浅表面态是主要来源，在室温下可导致Voc降低约80mV，需要针对一阶和二阶非辐射复合分别制定不同的抑制策略。

Halide perovskite solar cells have demonstrated a rapid increase in power
conversion efficiencies. Understanding and mitigating remaining carrier losses
in halide perovskites is now crucial to enable further increases to approach
their practical efficiency limits. Whilst the most widely known non-radiative
recombination from solar cells relates to carrier trapping and is first order
in carrier density, recent reports have revealed a non-radiative pathway that
is second order. However, the origin and impact of this second-order process on
devices remain unclear. Here, we understand this non-radiative second-order
recombination (k2non) pathway by manipulating the charge carrier dynamics via
controlling the bulk and surface conditions. By combining temperature-dependent
spectroscopies, we demonstrate that the value of k2non depends on extrinsic
factors, in contrast to intrinsic second-order recombination, which aligns with
theoretical evaluations through van Roosbroeck-Shockley relations. Based on
density functional theory simulations and Quasi-Fermi level calculations, we
propose that shallow surface states are the primary origin of this second-order
non-radiative component, contributing up to ~80 mV of the overall reduction in
Voc at room temperature. This work reveals that carrier losses from two
non-radiative recombination types (first and second order) are not linked,
emphasizing the need for distinctive mitigation strategies targeting each type
to unlock the full efficiency potential of perovskite solar cells.

### Gaussian-Based Periodic Grand Canonical Density Functional Theory with Implicit Solvation for Computational Electrochemistry

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种基于高斯型轨道的固体系统巨正则密度泛函理论数值方法，通过密度矩阵直接最小化巨正则自由能，并与隐式溶剂模型结合用于电化学模拟。

We present a numerical method for grand canonical density functional theory
(DFT) tailored to solid-state systems, employing Gaussian-type orbitals as the
primary basis. Our approach directly minimizes the grand canonical free energy
using the density matrix as the sole variational parameter, while
self-consistently updating the electron number between self-consistent field
iterations. To enable realistic electrochemical modeling, we integrate this
approach with implicit solvation models. Our solvation scheme introduces less
than 50% overhead relative to gas-phase calculations. Compared to existing
plane wave-based implementations, our method shows improved robustness in grand
canonical simulations. We validate the approach by modeling corrosion at silver
surfaces, finding excellent agreement with previous studies. This work lays the
groundwork for future wavefunction-based simulations beyond DFT under
electrochemical operando conditions.

- **TL;DR**: 基于注意力机制的神经网络用于揭示材料科学中的结构-性能关系，以PbTiO3铁电薄膜为案例，通过分析注意力分数解析不同畴结构对极化切换过程的影响。

Machine learning methods are emerging as a universal paradigm for
constructing correlative structure-property relationships in materials science
based on multimodal characterization. However, this necessitates development of
methods for physical interpretability of the resulting correlative models.
Here, we demonstrate the potential of attention-based neural networks for
revealing structure-property relationships and the underlying physical
mechanisms, using the ferroelectric properties of PbTiO3 thin films as a case
study. Through the analysis of attention scores, we disentangle the influence
of distinct domain patterns on the polarization switching process. The
attention-based Transformer model is explored both as a direct interpretability
tool and as a surrogate for explaining representations learned via unsupervised
machine learning, enabling the identification of physically grounded
correlations. We compare attention-derived interpretability scores with
classical SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis and show that, in
contrast to applications in natural language processing, attention mechanisms
in materials science exhibit high efficiency in highlighting meaningful
structural features.

### Octahedral tilting and B-site off-centering in halide perovskites are not coupled

Metal halide perovskites show exceptional potential for solar energy,
thermoelectrics, catalysis, and other photochemical technologies, with
performance rooted in electronic structure-driven properties. In ABX3 halide
perovskites, localized and often aspherical local electron densities from
B-site lone pairs or polarizable X- anions can distort the lattice. However,
the links among electronic structure fluctuations and distortions like tilting
of the BX6 octahedra and off-centering of the B-site from the center of its
octahedron are not fully understood. Using group theory and ab initio molecular
dynamics, we quantify how lone pairs, halide polarization, off-centering, and
octahedral tilting interact in the cubic phase CsBBr3, with B = Pb, Sn, and Ge.
We find that lone pair-induced off-centering and octahedral tilting are
symmetry-decoupled. Instead, stereochemical lone pair expression of the B-site
ion is correlated to octahedral tilting through the propensity of the B-site to
form a transient, partial covalent bond with the surrounding halide ions that
stiffens octahedral tilting modes. These results link local electronic
asymmetry to structural fluctuations and suggest that dynamic modulation of
electronic symmetry offers a pathway to control functional properties in halide
perovskites.

### Revisiting thermal transport in CuCl: First-principles calculations and machine learning force fields

- **TL;DR**: 该研究通过重整化力常数和四声子散射计算，准确预测了强非谐材料CuCl的晶格热导率，并利用机器学习力场揭示了压力对热导率的异常影响机制。

Accurate prediction of lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_l$) in strongly
anharmonic materials requires renormalized interatomic force constants (IFCs)
and appropriate incorporation of diagonal and off-diagonal contributions and
higher-order scattering. We investigate CuCl, a highly anharmonic system with a
simple zincblende structure and ultralow $\kappa_l$. Our calculations,
including IFC renormalization and four-phonon scattering, show excellent
agreement with the experiment, underscoring the critical role of both effects
in the accurate estimation of $\kappa_l$. Furthermore, the unusual pressure
dependence of $\kappa_l$ is explored using a rigorously validated
machine-learned force field, with the predicted values showing good agreement
with the experimentally observed trend of monotonic decrease. This behavior is
primarily driven by a significant increase in four-phonon scattering and a
reduction in the group velocity of transverse acoustic modes. Overall, this
study establishes a robust framework for modeling thermal transport in strongly
anharmonic materials.

### Regularized Perturbation Theory for Ab initio Solids

- **TL;DR**: 本文开发并评估了三种正则化二阶微扰理论（κ-MP2、σ-MP2和BW-s2），用于解决传统MP2方法在金属、窄带隙和色散稳定系统中的发散和过相关性问题。BW-s2在金属、半导体和分子晶体中表现出色，但在稀有气体固体中表现不佳。

Second-order Moller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) for ab initio
simulations of solids is often limited by divergence or over-correlation
issues, particularly in metallic, narrow-gap, and dispersion-stabilized
systems. We develop and assess three regularized second-order perturbation
theories: $\kappa$-MP2, $\sigma$-MP2, and the size-consistent Brillouin-Wigner
approach (BW-s2), across metals, semiconductors, molecular crystals, and rare
gas solids. BW-s2 achieves high accuracy for cohesive energies, lattice
constants, and bulk moduli in metals, semiconductors, and molecular crystals,
rivaling or surpassing coupled-cluster with singles and doubles at lower cost.
In rare gas solids, where MP2 already underbinds, $\kappa$-MP2 does not make
the results much worse while BW-s2 struggles. These results illustrate both the
potential and the limitations of regularized perturbation theory for efficient
and accurate solid-state simulations. While broader testing is warranted,
BW-s2($\alpha$ = 2) appears particularly promising, with possible advantages
over modern random-phase approximations and coupled-cluster theory.

MnBi2Te4 (MBT) is the first intrinsic magnetic topological insulator,
combining a topologically protected surface metallic state and intrinsic
magnetic order. A structural compatibility with the nonmagnetic Bi2Te4 (BT)
parent compound gives a possibility to create MBT/BT heterostructures and
manipulate their magnetic state in view of optimizing the Quantum Anomalous
Hall Effect (QAHE). In this work an extensive NMR study, supported by the bulk
magnetization measurements has been performed at 4.2 K on a self-organized
single crystal MnBi2Te4(Bi2Te4)n heterostructure. 55Mn and 209Bi NMR signal
have been recorded as a function of the out-of-plane magnetic field up to 6T,
covering a spin-flop transition from the antiferromagnetic (AFM) to the canted
antiferromagnetic (CAFM) configuration of the Mn layers. Structural defects
were shown to contribute a small ferromagnetic component below the spin-flop
field. Presence of the AFM-coupled Mn antisites has been evidenced and shown to
induce an antiparallel magnetic moment on Bi atoms within the host Bi layer.
Detection of the induced magnetic moment on bismuth which contributes a new
ferromagnetic component is of utmost importance for understanding the magnetic
interactions in the MBT/BT system. These findings have potentially important
implications for engineering the QAH devices.

To gain a deeper insight into the anomalous yield behavior of Ni3Al, it is
essential to obtain temperature-dependent formation Gibbs energies of the
relevant planar defects. Here, the Gibbs energy of the complex stacking fault
(CSF) is evaluated using a recently proposed ab initio framework [Acta
Materialia, 255 (2023) 118986], accounting for all thermal contributions -
including anharmonicity and paramagnetism - up to the melting point. The CSF
energy shows a moderate decrease from 300K to about 1200 K, followed by a
stronger drop. We demonstrate the necessity to carefully consider the
individual thermal excitations. We also propose a way to analyze the origin of
the significant anharmonic contribution to the CSF energy through atomic pair
distributions at the CSF plane. With the newly available high-temperature CSF
data, an increasing energy barrier for the cross-slip process in Ni3Al with
increasing temperature is unveiled, necessitating the refinement of existing
analytical models.

Post-transfer in-depth morphological characterization of graphene grown by
chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is of great importance to evaluate the quality
and to understand the origin of defects of the transferred sheets. Herein, a
semi-dry transfer technique is used to peel off millimeter-sized CVD graphene
flakes from polycrystalline copper foils and transfer them onto SiO2/Si
substrates. We take advantage of the unique feature of this semi-dry process:
it preserves the copper substrate, enabling location-specific morphological
comparisons between graphene and copper at various stages of the transfer.
Thanks to a combination of morphological characterization techniques, this
leads to trace and elucidate the origin of various post-transfer graphene
defects (cracks, wrinkles, holes, tears). Specifically, thermally induced
wrinkles are shown to evolve into nanoscale cracks, while copper surface steps
lead to folds. Furthermore, we find that the macroscale topography of the
copper foil also plays a critical role in defect formation. This work provides
guidelines on how to correctly interpret the post-transfer morphology of
graphene films on relevant substrates and how to properly assess their quality.
This contributes to the optimization of both the graphene CVD growth and
transfer processes for future applications.

### Lattice distortions and non-sluggish diffusion in BCC refractory high entropy alloys

Refractory high-entropy alloys (RHEAs) have emerged as promising candidates
for extreme high-temperature applications, for example, in next-generation
turbines and nuclear reactors. In such applications, atomic diffusion
critically governs essential properties including creep resistance and
microstructural stability. The present study systematically investigates
impurity diffusion of Co, Mn, and Zn in single phase (BCC solid solution)
HfTiZrNbTa and HfTiZrNbV RHEAs applying the radiotracer technique. A neutron
total scattering technique is used to evaluate the pair distribution functions
and element-specific lattice distortions in these alloys. \textit{Ab
initio}-based calculations give access to lattice distortions and solubilities
of the impurities under investigation, including the impact of short-range
order. The diffusion results are discussed in relation to calculated
substitutional and interstitial solution energies, local lattice distortions,
and short-range order effects. Co diffusion is found to be dominated by the
interstitial mechanism, exhibiting fast diffusion. These findings reveal
important structure-property relationships between local atomic environments
and diffusion kinetics in BCC RHEAs, providing critical insights for designing
alloys with enhanced high-temperature performance through targeted control of
impurity diffusion processes.

Polarons are widespread in functional materials and are key to device
performance in several technological applications. However, their effective
impact on material behavior remains elusive, as condensed matter studies
struggle to capture their intricate interplay with atomic defects in the
crystal. In this work, we present an automated workflow for modeling polarons
within density functional theory (DFT). Our approach enables a fully automatic
identification of the most favorable polaronic configurations in the system.
Machine learning techniques accelerate predictions, allowing for an efficient
exploration of the defect-polaron configuration space. We apply this
methodology to Nb-doped TiO$_2$(110) surfaces, providing new insights into the
role of defects in surface reactivity. Using CO adsorbates as a probe, we find
that Nb doping has minimal impact on reactivity, whereas oxygen vacancies
contribute significantly depending on their local arrangement via the
stabilization of polarons on the surface atomic layer. Our package streamlines
the modeling of charge trapping and polaron localization with high efficiency,
enabling systematic, large-scale investigations of polaronic effects across
complex material systems.

Molecular modeling of thermally activated chemistry in condensed phases is
essential to understand polymerization, depolymerization, and other processing
steps of molecular materials. Current methods typically combine molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations to describe short-time relaxation with a stochastic
description of predetermined chemical reactions. Possible reactions are often
selected on the basis of geometric criteria, such as a capture distance between
reactive atoms. Although these simulations have provided valuable insight, the
approximations used to determine possible reactions often lead to significant
molecular strain and unrealistic structures. We show that the local molecular
environment surrounding the reactive site plays a crucial role in determining
the resulting molecular strain energy and, in turn, the associated reaction
rates. We develop a graph neural network capable of predicting the strain
energy associated with a cyclization reaction from the pre-reaction, local,
molecular environment surrounding the reactive site. The model is trained on a
large dataset of condensed-phase reactions during the activation of
polyacrylonitrile (PAN) obtained from MD simulations and can be used to adjust
relative reaction rates in condensed systems and advance our understanding of
thermally activated chemical processes in complex materials

L12 precipitates are known to significantly enhance the strength and
ductility of single-phase face-centered cubic (FCC) medium- or high-entropy
alloys (M/HEAs). However, further improvements in mechanical properties remain
untapped, as alloy design has historically focused on systems with specific
CrCoNi- or FeCoCrNi-based FCC matrix and Ni3Al L12 phase compositions. This
study introduces novel Co-Ni-Mo-Al alloys with L12 precipitates by
systematically altering Al content, aiming to bridge this research gap by
revealing the strengthening mechanisms. The (CoNi)81Mo12Al7 alloy achieves
yield strength of 1086 MPa, tensile strength of 1520 MPa, and ductility of 35
%, demonstrating an impressive synergy of strength, ductility, and
strain-hardening capacity. Dislocation analysis via transmission electron
microscopy, supported by generalized stacking fault energy (GSFE) calculations
using density functional theory (DFT), demonstrates that Mo substitution for Al
in the L12 phase alters dislocation behavior, promoting the formation of
multiple deformation modes, including stacking faults, super-dislocation pairs,
Lomer-Cottrell locks, and unusual nano-twin formation even at low strains.
These behaviors are facilitated by the low stacking fault energy (SFE) of the
FCC matrix, overlapping of SFs, and dislocation dissociation across anti-phase
boundaries (APBs). The increased energy barrier for superlattice intrinsic
stacking fault (SISF) formation compared to APBs, due to Mo substitution,
further influences dislocation activity. This work demonstrates a novel
strategy for designing high-performance M/HEAs by expanding the range of FCC
matrix and L12 compositions through precipitation hardening.

Understanding the interface between metals and two-dimensional materials is
critical for their application in electronics and for the development of
metal-mediated exfoliation of large area monolayers. Studying the intricate
interactions at the interface requires model systems that enable control of the
roughness, purity, and crystallinity of the metal surface. Here, we investigate
the layer-dependent electronic structure of WSe_2 on template-stripped gold
substrates fabricated using both silicon and mica templates, giving
crystallographically disordered and Au(111) ordered surfaces, respectively, and
contrast these findings with ab initio predictions. We observe strong
hybridization around the Brillouin zone centre at $\overline{\Gamma}$,
indicating a covalent admixture in the gold-\WSe~interaction, and band shifts
that suggest charge rearrangement at the Au(111) / WSe_2 interface. Core-level
spectroscopy shows a single chemical environment for the interfacial WSe_2
layer on the template-stripped gold, distinct from the subsequent layers. These
results reveal a mixture of van der Waals and covalent interactions, best
described as a covalent-like quasi-bonding with intermediate interaction
strength.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一个评估通用机器学习原子间势在不同维度系统预测能力的基准测试，发现所有模型在三维系统中表现优秀，但精度随维度降低而下降。最佳模型在原子位置误差达到0.01-0.02埃，能量误差低于10meV/原子。

We present a benchmark designed to evaluate the predictive capabilities of
universal machine learning interatomic potentials across systems of varying
dimensionality. Specifically, our benchmark tests zero- (molecules, atomic
clusters, etc.), one- (nanowires, nanoribbons, nanotubes, etc.), two- (atomic
layers and slabs) and three-dimensional (bulk materials) compounds. The
benchmark reveals that while all tested models demonstrate excellent
performance for three-dimensional systems, accuracy degrades progressively for
lower-dimensional structures. The best performing models for geometry
optimization are orbital version 2, equiformerV2, and the equivariant Smooth
Energy Network, with the equivariant Smooth Energy Network also providing the
most accurate energies. Our results indicate that the best models yield, on
average, errors in the atomic positions in the range of 0.01-0.02 angstrom and
errors in the energy below 10~meV/atom across all dimensionalities. These
results demonstrate that state-of-the-art universal machine learning
interatomic potentials have reached sufficient accuracy to serve as direct
replacements for density functional theory calculations, at a small fraction of
the computational cost, in simulations spanning the full range from isolated
atoms to bulk solids. More significantly, the best performing models already
enable efficient simulations of complex systems containing subsystems of mixed
dimensionality, opening new possibilities for modeling realistic materials and
interfaces.

- **TL;DR**: 高次谐波光谱学应用于拓扑材料的研究，发现对于Chern绝缘体和拓扑绝缘体，螺旋度、圆二色性和椭圆度依赖性可以捕捉拓扑相特征，但对于高阶拓扑绝缘体(HOTIs)，谐波谱中未发现明显的拓扑特征，需要更仔细的分析。

Over the last decade, high-harmonic spectroscopy has been successfully
extended to the study of ultrafast electron motion in solids, shedding light on
fundamental processes such as Bloch oscillations and higher-order nonlinear
phenomena. In this work, we present theoretical studies of high-harmonic
spectroscopy applied to topological materials including higher-order ones,
focusing on several key observables associated with high-harmonic generation -
namely, helicity, circular dichroism, and ellipticity dependence. We extend
current all-optical measurement approaches from lower-order topological
insulators (LOTIs) to higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs), employing
three distinct models: a Haldane model for Chern insulators, Kane-Mele model
for topological insulators, and a breathing Kagome lattice for HOTIs. This work
aims to resolve whether helicity, circular dichroism, and ellipticity
dependence can reveal signatures of topological states. For the Chern
insulators and topological insulators, we find that these observables can
indeed capture topological phases. In contrast, for HOTIs, no clear signatures
of topology emerge in the harmonic spectrum, suggesting that a more careful
analysis is required to identify topological invariants in higher-order
topological insulators. In particular, for the topological semimetal phase, we
find a harmonic enhancement by two to three orders of magnitude in the Kagome
lattice. Our study delineates the conditions under which high-harmonic
spectroscopy serves as a unique tool for diagnosing topological phases,
particularly for those associated with topological corner states.
