- **TL;DR**: 该论文提出了基于纠缠熵的精确框架来检测无序系统中的拓扑相变，通过SSH模型变体证明半填充与近半填充基态之间的纠缠熵差异在拓扑相中消失而在平庸相中保持有限，这一特征在准周期或二元无序下依然存在。

Entanglement entropy (EE) provides a powerful probe of quantum phases, yet
its role in identifying topological transitions in disordered systems remains
underexplored. We introduce an exact EE-based framework that captures
topological phase transitions even in the presence of disorder. Specifically,
for a class of Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model variants, we show that the
difference in EE between half-filled and near-half-filled ground states,
$\Delta S^{\mathcal{A}}$, vanishes in the topological phase but remains finite
in the trivial phase -- a direct consequence of edge-state localization. This
behavior persists even in the presence of quasiperiodic or binary disorder.
Exact phase boundaries, derived from Lyapunov exponents via transfer matrices,
agree closely with numerical results from $\Delta S^{\mathcal{A}}$ and the
topological invariant $\mathcal{Q}$, with instances where $\Delta
S^{\mathcal{A}}$ outperforms $\mathcal{Q}$. Our results highlight EE as a
robust diagnostic tool and a potential bridge between quantum information and
condensed matter approaches to topological matter.

- **TL;DR**: 本文研究了菱面体六层石墨烯的半金属态，发现了丰富的相图，包括电场驱动的能带反转、类超导态和两种多铁性轨道磁相

Rhombohedral multilayer graphene has emerged as a promising platform for
exploring correlated and topological quantum phases, enabled by its
Berry-curvature-bearing flat bands. While prior work has focused on separated
conduction and valence bands, we probe the extensive semimetallic regime of
rhombohedral hexalayer graphene. We survey a rich phase diagram dominated by
flavor-symmetry breaking and reveal an electric-field-driven band inversion
through fermiology. Near this inversion, we find a superconducting-like state
confined to a region with emergent electron and hole Fermi surfaces. In
addition, two multiferroic orbital-magnetic phases are observed: a ferrovalley
state near zero field and a ferroelectric state at large fields around charge
neutrality. The latter shows electric-field-reversible magnetic hysteresis,
consistent with a $\Delta P \cdot M$ multiferroic order parameter. Our
fermiology analysis elucidates the correlated semimetal regime in rhombohedral
graphene and underscores its potential to host diverse quantum phases.

- **TL;DR**: 在具有中心对称晶体结构的单轴铁磁体CeRu₂Ga₂B中，通过霍尔效应、交流磁化率和磁力显微镜研究，发现有序相中存在拓扑霍尔效应，磁泡随磁场从普通拓扑演变为拓扑自旋结构。

We study the Hall effect, AC magnetic susceptibility ($\chi_{\rm ac}$), and
magnetic force microscopy of the uniaxial ferromagnet CeRu$_2$Ga$_2$B with a
centrosymmetric crystal structure. We observe a finite topological Hall effect
(THE) within the ordered phase before the magnetization is polarized by applied
field. By comparing the field dependences of the area fraction of the magnetic
bubbles, the derivative of $\chi_{\rm ac}$, and the THE signal, we deduce that
the magnetic bubbles of CeRu$_2$Ga$_2$B evolve from the trivial to topological
spin texture with field. Our findings will be utilized to expand the search for
magnetic materials hosting the topological spin textures to ones with uniaxial
anisotropy, and open a new possibility to tailor the topological spin texture.

We report on time-resolved ultrafast terahertz third-harmonic generation
spectroscopy of nonequilibrium dynamics of Weyl fermions in a nanometer thin
film of the Weyl semimetal TaP. Under a strong multicycle narrowband terahertz
drive, very efficient terahertz third-harmonic generation is observed at room
temperature which exhibits a perturbative cubic power-law dependence on the
terahertz drive. By varying the polarization of the drive pulse from linear to
elliptical, we realize a sensitive tuning of the third harmonic yield. We
ascribe the observed strong nonlinearity to THz field driven nonlinear kinetics
of the Weyl fermions.

### Unconventional superconductivity induced by rare-earth substitution in Nd1-xEuxNiO2 thin films

- **TL;DR**: Eu替代NdNiO2中的Nd增强了超导能隙，使系统进入强耦合状态，并观察到磁场增强的超导现象，2Δ/kBTc ≈ 5-6表明强耦合配对机制

High temperature superconductivity is typically associated with strong
coupling and a large superconducting gap, yet these characteristics have not
been demonstrated in the nickelates. Here, we provide experimental evidence
that Eu substitution in the spacer layer of Nd1-xEuxNiO2 (NENO) thin films
enhances the superconducting gap, driving the system toward a strong-coupling
regime. This is accompanied by a magnetic-exchange-driven
magnetic-field-enhanced superconductivity. We investigate the upper critical
magnetic field, Hc2, and superconducting gap of superconducting NENO thin films
with x=0.2 to 0.35. Magnetoresistance measurements reveal
magnetic-field-enhanced superconductivity in NENO films. We interpret this
phenomenon as a result of interaction between magnetic Eu ions and
superconducting states in the Ni dx2-y2 orbital. The upper critical magnetic
field strongly violates the weak-coupling Pauli limit. Infrared spectroscopy
confirms a large gap-to-Tc ratio $2 \Delta k_B T_c \approx 5 - 6$, indicating a
stronger coupling pairing mechanism in NENO relative to the Sr-doped NdNiO2.
The substitution of Eu in the rare-earth layer provides a method to modify the
superconducting gap in Nd-based nickelates, an essential factor in engineering
high-Tc superconductivity in infinite-layer nickelates.

### Node-Equivariant Message Passing for Efficient and Accurate Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials

- **TL;DR**: 提出节点等变消息传递框架NEMP，通过中心节点与虚拟聚合节点间的操作，在保持精度的同时大幅降低计算和内存成本1-2个数量级

Machine learned interatomic potentials, particularly equivariant
message-passing (MP) models, have demonstrated high fidelity in representing
first-principles data, revolutionizing computational studies in materials
science, biophysics, and catalysis. However, these equivariant MP models still
incur substantial computational and memory needs due to their expensive tensor
product operations over edge space, significantly limiting their applicability
in large-scale or long-time simulations. In this work, we propose a
node-equivariant MP (NEMP) framework that performs equivariant operations
between the central node and a virtual summed node encoding structure
information of its neighbors. Crucially, NEMP maintains comparable or even
superior accuracy across diverse test systems-including molecules, extended
systems, and universal potential benchmarks-while achieving 1-2 orders of
magnitude reduction in memory and computational costs compared to edge
equivariant MP models. In fact, NEMP reaches computational efficiency
comparable to that of local descriptor-based models, and enabling previously
inaccessible large-scale simulations.

### Interpretability of linear regression models of glassy dynamics

- **TL;DR**: 本文分析了基于高维结构描述符的线性回归模型在玻璃态动力学研究中的优缺点，通过二维玻璃模型数据展示了多重共线性问题，并比较了不同回归方法在预测准确性和物理可解释性之间的平衡。

Data-driven models can accurately describe and predict the dynamical
properties of glass-forming liquids from structural data. Accurate predictions,
however, do not guarantee an understanding of the underlying physical phenomena
and the key factors that control them. In this paper, we illustrate the merits
and limitations of linear regression models of glassy dynamics built on
high-dimensional structural descriptors. By analyzing data for a
two-dimensional glass model, we show that several descriptors commonly used in
glass-transition studies display multicollinearity, which hinders the
interpretability of linear models. Ridge regression suppresses some of the
shortcomings of multicollinearity, but its solutions are not succinct enough to
be physically interpretable. Only by using dimensional reduction techniques we
eventually obtain linear models that strike a balance between prediction
accuracy and interpretability. Our analysis points to a key role of local
packing and composition fluctuations in the glass model under study.

### Dual Topology as a Fingerprint of Relativistic Altermagnetism in AgF$_2$ Monolayer

- **TL;DR**: 单层AgF₂材料通过铁弹性畸变实现电子和磁子的双重拓扑态，具有相反的陈数(C^E=±3和C^M=±1)，为拓扑交替磁子学提供了实验可验证的平台。

Altermagnets have emerged as a fertile ground for quantum phenomena, but
topological phases unifying different quasiparticles remain largely unexplored.
Here, we demonstrate that monolayer AgF$_2$ hosts a dual topological state,
driven by a single ferroelastic distortion. This polar transition breaks
inversion symmetry and unleashes relativistic spin-orbit effects,
simultaneously imparting non-trivial topology to electrons and magnons. The
result is valence bands with opposite Chern numbers, $C^E=\pm3$, and a magnon
spectrum with a full topological gap and chiral bands, $C^M=\pm1$. This work
realizes topological altermagnonics in a tangible material platform, with a
clear experimental fingerprint in the transverse thermal Hall effect. The
coexistence of fermionic and bosonic topology in AgF$_2$ opens new directions
for designing intrinsically hybrid quantum matter.

### Coupled Continuous-Discontinuous Galerkin Finite Element Solver for Compound Flood Simulations

- **TL;DR**: 本文发展了一种稳健的渗透性计算方法，通过结合DG-CG离散化浅水方程和ADCIRC模型，用于模拟台风雨水与风暴潮的复合洪水效应。

Several recent tropical cyclones, e.g., Hurricane Harvey (2017), have lead to
significant rainfall and resulting runoff. When the runoff interacts with storm
surge, the resulting floods can be greatly amplified and lead to effects that
cannot be correctly modeled by simple superposition of its distinctive sources.
In an effort to develop accurate numerical simulations of runoff, surge, and
compounding floods, we develop a locally conservative coupled DG-CG
discretization of the shallow water equations and integrate it into the
Advanced Circulation Model (ADCIRC). We also modify the continuity equation to
include spatially and temporally variable rainfall into the model using
parametric rainfall models. We demonstrate the capabilities of the scheme
though a sequence of physically relevant numerical tests, including small scale
test cases based on laboratory measurements and large scale experiments with
Hurricane Harvey in the Gulf of Mexico. The results highlight the conservation
properties and robustness of the developed method and show the potential of
compound flood modeling using our approach.

### Wiener Hopf Analysis of Transient Mode-I/Mode-II Fracture in Rotating Heterogeneous Magnetoelastic Orthotropic Media under Initial Stresses

- **TL;DR**: 研究旋转磁弹性各异向性分层材料中半无穷裂纹的断裂行为，分析了材料分层、旋转、磁弹耦合和初始应力对应力强度因子时间演化的影响。

This study investigates the fracture behavior under both opening (Mode I) and
in-plane sliding (Mode II) conditions for a semi-infinite crack in a rotating,
spatially graded magnetoelastic orthotropic strip with combined horizontal and
vertical initial normal stresses. The strip is assumed infinite in extent, with
the crack aligned along its longitudinal axis and parallel to the rotation
axis. The governing field equations are reduced to an analytically tractable
form by employing the Fourier transform in the spatial domain and the Laplace
transform in the temporal domain. The effect of a sudden application of
traction, represented by a Heaviside step function, is analyzed for both normal
and shear loading conditions. The resulting boundary-value problem is addressed
through the Wiener Hopf method, yielding analytical representations of the
stress intensity factors (SIFs). The near tip asymptotic stress fields are
evaluated to derive explicit SIF representations for each loading
configuration. Laplace inversion is performed using the generalized Chebyshev
Laguerre polynomial method. Numerical simulations are conducted for Uranium and
Graphite--Epoxy, with isotropic materials considered for comparison to assess
the role of anisotropy. The temporal evolution of the SIFs is investigated for
varying material gradation parameters, rotation rates, magnetoelastic coupling,
and initial stresses. Results reveal that functional grading significantly
influences both the magnitude and time evolution of the SIFs, rotation
introduces a stabilizing effect, and magnetoelasticity exhibits mode-dependent
impacts. These findings provide valuable insight into fracture behavior in
advanced magnetoelastic composites, with relevance to high-performance rotating
structures such as surface acoustic wave devices, aircraft wings, and
helicopter blades.

### Investigating structure and physical properties of quaternary layered transition metal oxide Na2Cu2TeO6

We investigated the crystal structure, magnetic behavior, and optical
properties of the layered honeycomb compound Na2Cu2TeO6. X-ray and neutron
diffraction confirmed a monoclinic structure, with Cu ions arranged in
dimerized chains. Magnetic susceptibility measurements yielded a Curie-Weiss
temperature significantly lower than the expected spin-only value, indicating
the presence of strong antiferromagnetic interactions and enhanced quantum
fluctuations. A broad maximum near 160 K in the susceptibility data is
consistent with short-range one-dimensional antiferromagnetic correlations.
Magnetization measurements showed negligible coercivity, and specific heat data
revealed no anomalies down to 3 K. Temperature-dependent neutron diffraction
showed no evidence of long-range magnetic order. Optical absorption studies
using UV-Visible spectroscopy displayed a sharp absorption edge in the UV
region. Tauc analysis estimated a direct optical band gap of approximately 2.10
eV, with no clear indication of an indirect transition. These observations
provide insight into the interplay between structural distortions,
low-dimensional magnetism, and optical behavior in Na2Cu2TeO6

Superconducting chiral domains associated with a time-reversal
symmetry-breaking order parameter have garnered significant attention in Kagome
systems. In this work, we demonstrate both the intrinsic direct-current and
alternating-current Josephson effects in the nanoplates of the vanadium-based
Kagome material CsV3Sb5, as evidenced by Fraunhofer-like patterns and Shapiro
steps. Moreover, both the Fraunhofer-like patterns and Shapiro steps are
modulated by thermal cycling, suggesting that the Josephson effects arise from
dynamic superconducting domains. These findings may provide new insights into
chiral superconductivity in CsV3Sb5 and highlight the potential of these
intrinsic Josephson junctions for applications in chiral superconductor based
quantum devices.

### Vibrational Spectra of Materials and Molecules from Partially-Adiabatic Elevated-Temperature Centroid Molecular Dynamics

- **TL;DR**: 提出了部分绝热的Te-CMD方法，通过双温度路径积分朗之万恒温器实现环聚合物质心和内部模式的温度分离，无需预计算平均力势，解决了CMD中的曲率问题并降低了计算成本。

Centroid molecular dynamics (CMD) incorporates nuclear quantum statistics
into the calculation of vibrational spectra. However, when performed in
Cartesian coordinates, CMD shows serious unphysical artifacts in certain
vibrational bands, known as the curvature problem. Recent work showed that CMD
spectra can be freed from the curvature problem by evolving the ring-polymer
centroid on a potential of mean force (PMF) calculated at an elevated
temperature ($T_e$-CMD). Here we present a partially-adiabatic implementation
of $T_e$-CMD (PA-$T_e$-CMD), which eliminates the need for precomputed PMFs and
instead yields the centroid force \textit{on-the-fly}. We introduce a
two-temperature path-integral Langevin thermostat to achieve a temperature
separation between centroid and internal modes of the ring-polymer. Because it
is paramount that the elevated temperature be chosen as low as possible for a
given physical temperature in this formulation, we present a general scheme for
its determination. We benchmark PA-$T_e$-CMD against exact vibrational spectra
for the isolated water monomer and discuss its performance for challenging
anharmonic systems: the carbonic acid fluoride molecule (CAF) and the
methylammonium lead iodide perovskite (MAPI). We conclude that PA-$T_e$-CMD
mitigates the curvature problem and eliminates the steep increase in
computational cost with decreasing temperature of conventional path-integral
methods. We observe some energy leakage from the hot internal modes to
high-frequency centroid modes at low physical temperatures. Nevertheless,
compared to other imaginary path-integral approximate methods, the PA-$T_e$-CMD
spectra show more accurate lineshapes. While a fully adiabatic setup based on a
coarse-grained centroid PMF is still preferable when a good pre-trained PMF can
be easily obtained, PA-$T_e$-CMD presents a low-barrier single-shot setup for
any system.

### Universal Fluctuations in the Tail Probability for d=2 Random Walks in Space-Time Random Environments

- **TL;DR**: 本文研究了二维随机环境中的随机行走模型，发现在极端值（最快或最远的行走者）的尾概率中表现出与一维情况不同的普适标度形式，但具有相同的系数λ_ext。

Many diffusive systems involve correlated random walkers due to a shared
environment. Such systems can be modeled as random walks in random environments
(RWRE). These models differ from classical diffusion in the behavior of the
extremes -- the walkers that move the fastest or farthest. In spatial dimension
$d=1$ RWRE models have been well studied numerically and analytically and
exhibit universal behavior in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class. Here,
we study discrete lattice RWRE models in $d=2$. We find that the tail
probability exhibits a different universal scaling form, which is nevertheless
characterized by the same coefficient, $\lambda_\mathrm{ext}$, as in the $d=1$
case. We observe a critical scaling regime for fluctuations in the tail
probability at positions that scale linearly in time.

### Strong Correlation Driven Quadrupolar to Dipolar Exciton Transitions in a Trilayer Moiré Superlattice

- **TL;DR**: 三层过渡金属二硫化物莫尔超晶格中的四极激子可通过强激子-激子和电子-激子相互作用实现向偶极激子的可控转变

The additional layer degree of freedom in trilayer moir\'e superlattices of
transition metal dichalcogenides enables the emergence of novel excitonic
species, such as quadrupolar excitons, which exhibit unique excitonic
interactions and hold promise for realizing intriguing excitonic phases and
their quantum phase transitions. Concurrently, the presence of strong
electronic correlations in moir\'e superlattices, as exemplified by the
observations of Mott insulators and generalized Wigner crystals, offers a
direct route to manipulate these new excitonic states and resulting collective
excitonic phases. Here, we demonstrate that strong exciton-exciton and
electron-exciton interactions, both stemming from robust electron correlations,
can be harnessed to controllably drive transitions between quadrupolar and
dipolar excitons. This is achieved by tuning either the exciton density or
electrostatic doping in a trilayer semiconducting moir\'e superlattice. Our
findings not only advance the fundamental understanding of quadrupolar excitons
but also usher in new avenues for exploring and engineering many-body quantum
phenomena through novel correlated excitons in semiconducting moir\'e systems.

Modern supercomputers are increasingly relying on Graphic Processing Units
(GPUs) and other accelerators to achieve exa-scale performance at reasonable
energy usage. The challenge of exploiting these accelerators is the
incompatibility between different vendors. A scientific code written using CUDA
will not operate on a AMD gpu. Frameworks that can abstract the physics from
the accelerator kernel code are needed to exploit the current and future
hardware. In the world of machine learning, several auto differentiation
frameworks have been developed that have the promise of abstracting the math
from the compute hardware. However in practice, these framework often lag in
supporting non-CUDA platforms. Their reliance on python makes them challenging
to embed within non python based applications. In this paper we present the
development of a graph computation framework which compiles physics equations
to optimized kernel code for the central processing unit (CPUs), Apple GPUs,
and NVidia GPUs. The utility of this framework will be demonstrated for a Radio
Frequency (RF) ray tracing problems in fusion energy.

### Modeling Energy- and Momentum-dependent Scattering Relaxation Times in a Semi-Classical Model of Charge Transport using the Self-Scattering Technique

- **TL;DR**: 本文改进了自散射技术在玻尔兹曼输运方程模拟中的应用，证明了该技术能够准确恢复能量和动量相关的散射弛豫时间，为材料电荷输运性质计算提供了更高效准确的方法。

Improvement of numerical methods for calculating charge transport quantities
of materials from the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) is important for
prediction of material properties. In particular, techniques which allow for
more accurate models of scattering rates and band structures while remaining
less computationally involved are valuable. The self-scattering technique is
one such technique for implementing energy- and momentum-dependent scattering
relaxation times in Monte Carlo simulations of charge transport or iterative
techniques for solving the BTE. While the technique initially uses a constant
relaxation time in the simulation algorithm, we found, upon analysis of the
technique, that the energy and momentum total scattering relaxation time may be
recovered. To show this, we preformed self-scattering Monte Carlo simulations
of electron transport for both energy-dependent and independent relaxation
times. The relaxation times and the fraction of scattering type selected in the
simulation matched the full rates implemented in the simulation. In order to
understand these results, we developed the theory behind the technique,
demonstrating that the probability distribution function of free-flight times
created using the self-scattering algorithm produces the analytical probability
distribution function expression generated by full energy, momentum and time
dependent relaxation times and probabilities. However, certain forms of
relaxation times may cause the simulation to fail, depending on implementation.
Clarity about such techniques is important for improvement of charge transport
simulation models and implementation of ab initio scattering rates and band
structures.

solve the fundamental yet difficult problem of $U(1)$ gauge field coupled to
fermions, which gives rise to a $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid state under the
description of (2+1)d quantum electrodynamics QED$_3$. The algorithm renders a
good acceptance rate and, more importantly, nearly linear space-time volume
scaling in computational complexity $O(N_{\tau} V_s)$, where $N_\tau$ is the
imaginary time dimension and $V_s$ is spatial volume, which is much more
efficient than determinant QMC with scaling behavior of $O(N_\tau V_s^3)$. Such
acceleration is achieved via a collection of technical improvements, including
(i) the design of the efficient problem-specific preconditioner, (ii)
customized CUDA kernel for matrix-vector multiplication, and (iii) CUDA Graph
implementation on the GPU. These advances allow us to simulate the $U(1)$ Dirac
spin liquid state with unprecedentedly large system sizes, which is up to
$N_\tau\times L\times L = 660\times66\times66$, and reveal its novel
properties. With these technical improvements, we see the asymptotic
convergence in the scaling dimensions of various fermion bilinear operators and
the conserved current operator when approaching the thermodynamic limit. The
scaling dimensions find good agreement with field-theoretical expectation,
which provides supporting evidence for the conformal nature of the $U(1)$ Dirac
spin liquid state in the \qed. Our technical advancements open an avenue to
study the Dirac spin liquid state and its transition towards symmetry-breaking
phases at larger system sizes and with less computational burden.

- **TL;DR**: 在无限层镍酸盐中发现磁场诱导的高温超导现象，Tc可达40K，通过Jaccarino-Peter补偿机制解释

Magnetic fields typically suppress superconductivity through Pauli and
orbital limiting effects. However, there are rare instances of
magnetic-field-induced superconductivity, as seen in Chevrel phase compounds
[1], organic conductors [2], uranium-based heavy-fermion systems [3, 4], and
moire graphene [5], though these materials possess inherently low
superconducting transition temperatures (Tc). Here, we demonstrate high
field-stabilized superconductivity in a class of materials with a significantly
higher Tc (up to 40 K): the infinite-layer nickelates [6]. Both low-field and
high-field superconducting states can be plausibly explained by a compensation
mechanism akin to the Jaccarino-Peter effect. These findings demonstrate the
possibility of achieving substantially enhanced upper critical fields in
high-temperature superconductors.

### Double excitations in molecules

Double excitations in organic molecules have garnered significant interest as
a result of their importance in singlet fission and photophysics. These
excitations play a crucial role in understanding the photoexcitation processes
in polyenes. To describe photoexcited states with both single and double
excitation character, we use a first-principles many-body theory that combines
the GW / Bethe-Salpeter equation and the configuration interaction (CI)
methods. Specifically, we develop and employ two CI-based methods: screened
configuration interaction singles and doubles (scrCISD) and screened
configuration interaction singles with perturbative doubles (scrCIS(D)),
applied to an effective many-body Hamiltonian that incorporates screening. We
apply these methods to Thiel's set of molecules, which exhibit excited states
predominantly characterized by single excitations with a partial double
excitation character. Our results indicate that the scrCISD method
systematically underestimates the excitation energies compared to the best
theoretical estimates, while the scrCIS(D) method shows good agreement with
these estimates. Furthermore, we used the scrCISD method to calculate the
binding energies of the dominantly doubly excited correlated triplet pair
states, $\mathrm{TT^1}$, in pentacene dimers, finding that the $\mathrm{TT^1}$
binding energies agree well with empirical calculations.

- **TL;DR**: 本文讨论了伊辛模型临界点磁化概率密度函数中的幂律修正项，分析了该修正项是否存在与边界条件对有限系统平均磁化影响的函数渐近行为之间的关系。

At the critical point, the probability density function of the Ising
magnetization is believed to decay like $\exp{(-x^{\delta+1})}$, where $\delta$
is the Ising critical exponent that controls the decay to zero of the
magnetization in a vanishing external field. In this paper, we discuss the
presence of a power-law correction $x^{\frac{\delta-1}{2}}$, which has been
debated in the physics literature. We argue that whether such a correction is
present or not is related to the asymptotic behavior of a function that
measures the extent to which the average magnetization of a finite system with
an external field is influenced by the boundary conditions. Our discussion is
informed by a mixture of heuristic calculations and rigorous results. Along the
way, we review some recent results on the critical Ising model and prove
properties of the average magnetization in two dimensions which are of
independent interest.

We study the magnon spin photocurrent in effective spin models for Cr2O3, a
material known for its magnetoelectric effect. Using nonlinear response theory,
we show that magnon spin current can be generated by both linearly and
circularly polarized electromagnetic waves via one-magnon processes. While
linearly polarized waves induce a spin current even in the absence of a static
magnetic field, circularly polarized waves lead to a spin current only when a
static field is present, and the current reverses its direction upon field
inversion. The distinct dependence on the external magnetic field and the
contrasting responses to different polarizations allow the spin photocurrent to
be differentiated from competing effects such as spin pumping or inhomogeneous
heating, facilitating experimental verification. These results suggest that
Cr2O3 is a promising candidate for experimental studies of magnon photocurrent.

Foundation models for materials modeling are advancing quickly, but their
training remains expensive, often placing state-of-the-art methods out of reach
for many research groups. We introduce Nequix, a compact E(3)-equivariant
potential that pairs a simplified NequIP design with modern training practices,
including equivariant root-mean-square layer normalization and the Muon
optimizer, to retain accuracy while substantially reducing compute
requirements. Built in JAX, Nequix has 700K parameters and was trained in 500
A100-GPU hours. On the Matbench-Discovery and MDR Phonon benchmarks, Nequix
ranks third overall while requiring less than one quarter of the training cost
of most other methods, and it delivers an order-of-magnitude faster inference
speed than the current top-ranked model. We release model weights and fully
reproducible codebase at https://github.com/atomicarchitects/nequix

### Hybrid Monte Carlo Metadynamics (hybridMC-MetaD)

We propose the powerful integration of the Hybrid Monte Carlo (hybridMC)
algorithm and Well-Tempered Metadynamics. This new algorithm, hybridMC-MetaD,
enhances the flexibility and applicability of metadynamics by allowing for the
utilization of a wider range of collective variables (CVs), namely
non-differentiable CVs. We demonstrate the usage of hybridMC-MetaD through five
examples of rare events in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, including a
rare transition in a model potential system, condensation of the argon system,
crystallization in a nearly-hard sphere system, a nearly-hard bipyramid system
and a colloidal suspension. By taking advantage of hybridMC, which combines
molecular dynamics (MD) and MC, we are able to bias the transitions along
non-differentiable CVs for all five cases, which would be unfeasible with
conventional MD simulations. Enabled by metadynamics, we observed significant
acceleration of the phase transitions and calculated free energy barriers using
the hybridMC-MetaD simulation data. For the nearly-hard bipyramid system whose
crystallization is primarily driven by entropy, we report the free energy
surface for the first time. Through our case studies, we show that our
hybridMC-MetaD scheme reduces the complexity of using metadynamics and
increases its accessibility. We believe the hybridMC-MetaD algorithm will
stimulate greater interest in, and foster broader applications of metadynamics.

### Universal Entanglement Pattern Formation via a Quantum Quench

- **TL;DR**: 本文发现了一种普遍存在于对称性分辨纠缠动力学中的短时结构——纠缠通道波(ECW)，该结构源于纠缠在守恒量子数扇区中的分解，具有鲁棒的通道特异性模式。

We identify a universal short-time structure in symmetry-resolved
entanglement dynamics -- the entanglement channel wave (ECW) -- arising from
the decomposition of entanglement into conserved-quantum-number sectors that
host robust, channel-specific patterns. Focusing on domain-wall melting, we
conduct a systematic investigation across three paradigmatic classes of
many-body systems: U(1) fermions, U(1) bosons, and SU(2) spinful fermions. For
each class, we explore four distinct regimes defined by the presence or absence
of interactions and disorder, employing both the Krylov-subspace iterative
method and the correlation matrix approach. The ECW emerges universally across
all cases, establishing its independence from particle statistics, interaction
strength and disorder. In free fermions, the ECW formalism further enables
analytical determination of the correlation matrix spectrum. The subsequent
melting of the ECW exhibits symmetry- and statistics-dependent signatures,
revealing finer structures in the growth of symmetry-resolved entanglement.

### Charge transfer empties the flat band in 4H$_b$-TaS$_2$ -- except at the surface

The 4H\textsubscript{b} polytype of TaS$_2$ is a natural heterostructure of H
and T-type layers. Intriguing recent evidence points towards a possibly chiral
superconducting ground state, unlike the superconductivity found in other
polytypes where the T layers are absent, requiring understanding of the
possible contributions of electrons from the T layers. Here we use
micro-focused angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy to reveal that the T
termination of the 4H\textsubscript{b} structure is metallic, but a subsurface
T layer -- seen below an H termination and thus more representative of the bulk
case -- is gapped. The results imply a complete charge transfer of 1 electron
per 13 Ta from the T to adjacent H layers in the bulk, but an incomplete charge
transfer at the T termination, yielding a metallic Fermi surface with a
planar-chiral character. A similar metallic state is found in an anomalous
region with likely T-H-H' stacking at the surface. Our results exclude cluster
Mott localisation in either the bulk or surface of 4H$_b$-TaS$_2$ and point to
a scenario of superconductivity arising from Josephson-like tunneling between
the H layers.

The development of new electronic structure methods is a very time consuming

an open-source Julia package we have developed for working with automated
electronic structure theory development. The code focuses on being
user-friendly and extensible, allowing for easy use of both user- and
pre-defined fermionic and/or bosonic operators, tensors, and orbital spaces.
This allows the code to be used to efficiently investigate and prototype new
electronic structure methods for many different types of systems. This includes
both exotic systems with wave functions consisting of different kinds of
particles at once, as well as new parametrizations for traditional many
electron systems. The code is spin-adapted, working directly with spin-adapted
fermionic operators, and can easily be used to derive common electronic
structure theory equations and expressions, such as the coupled cluster energy,
ground and excited state equations, one- and two-electron density matrices,
etc. Additionally, the code can translate expressions into code, accelerating
the process of going from ideas to implemented methods.

- **TL;DR**: 重新定义时间量化蒙特卡洛(TQMC)方法中的时间单位，通过独立碳粒子松弛获得MC时间单位，并验证该方法在相互作用系统中的有效性

The study of the response of magnetic nanoparticles (MNP) assemblies to an
external alternating magnetic field is of great interest for applications such
as hyperthermia. The key quantity here is the complex susceptibility and its
behavior in terms of temperature and frequency. From a theoretical point of
view it can be obtained by Monte Carlo (MC) simulation with the time quantified
Monte Carlo (TQMC) method if a physical time is associated with the MC step.
Here we revisit this method by showing that the time unit can be derived from
the MC stochastic process of the isolated particle. We first obtain a MC unit
of time from the relaxation of the system at fixed temperature. Then this unit
of time is used to compute complex susceptibilities. We show that it is now
possible to match the TQMC results with actual experimental results regarding
frequency dependent in phase susceptibilities and quantify the unit of time in
seconds. Finally we show that the time unit obtained for the isolated particle
remains valid when considering interacting particles such as the Heisenberg
coupling or dipole dipole interactions.

It is of great interest to develop methods to rapidly and effectively control
the magnetic configurations in artificial spin ices, which are arrangements of
dipolar coupled nanomagnets that have a variety of fascinating collective
magnetic phenomena associated with them. This is not only valuable in terms of
acquiring fundamental understanding but is also important for future
high-performance applications. Here, we demonstrate ultrafast control of
magnetic relaxation in square artificial spin ice through femtosecond laser
pulsed excitation, enabling rapid access to low-energy states via dipolar
interactions. Time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect measurements reveal
that, after laser-induced demagnetization, the magnetization recovers within
picoseconds. During this brief transient window, dipolar coupling drives a
collective magnetic ordering. Ex-situ magnetic force microscopy confirms the
emergence of extended Type I vertex domains, characteristic of ground-state
ordering, thus establishing ultrafast laser-driven relaxation as a route to
attain the low-energy states. Through complementary energy barrier calculations
and micromagnetic simulations incorporating Landau-Lifshitz-Bloch dynamics, we
elucidate the underlying mechanism: transient ultrafast demagnetization
followed by rapid remagnetization that enables a dipolar-driven collective
rearrangement. Moreover, a tailored decreasing-fluence laser annealing protocol
is shown to enhance ground-state ordering, consistently achieving over 92%
ground-state vertex populations. This work opens the way to ultrafast and
spatially selective control of magnetic states in artificial spin ice for
spin-based computation and memory technologies, and highlights the critical
interplay of thermal fluctuations, magnetostatic coupling, and transient
magnetization dynamics.

This study aims to develop a simulation framework for rotating detonation
engines (RDEs) using multicomponentFluid solver in OpenFOAM v12 and to
demonstrate reducing the computational costs by adaptive mesh refinement (AMR)
and dynamic load balancing (DLB). RDEs have been extensively studied for
improvements in efficiency for power generation and aircraft propulsion
systems. A well-established framework, showing both high accuracy and cost
efficiency, is required to facilitate further research and development in RDEs.
The multicomponentFluid solver is validated against two problems:
one-dimensional planar detonation simulation and two-dimensional RDE
simulation, in which the present study's results are compared to reference
results of experiments and simulations, respectively. In the problems, the
present simulation results agree well with the validation data both
qualitatively (e.g., pressure distribution and temperature field) and
quantitatively (e.g., detonation velocity, mass flux, and specific impulse and
thrust). In the two-dimensional RDE simulation, we propose a detonation
velocity correction method for fair comparison with Chapman-Jouguet (CJ)
detonation velocity. Moreover, the two-dimensional RDE simulation is optimized
using AMR and DLB. By adopting both, computational costs decrease by up to 11.2
times. The effect of each of them is examined as well, which highlights the
importance of DLB.

One main limiting factor towards achieving high coherence times in
superconducting circuits is two level system (TLS) losses. Mitigating such
losses requires controlling the formation of native oxides at the metal-air
interface. Here, we report the growth of alkyl-phosphonate self-assembled
monolayers (SAMs) on Nb thin films following oxide removal. The impact of
passivation was evaluated via the performance of coplanar waveguide resonators
at 10mK, in terms of quality factor and resonant frequency, over six days of
air exposure. Un-passivated resonators exhibited an ~80% increase in loss at
single-photon power levels, whereas SAM-passivated resonators maintained
excellent temporal stability, attributed to suppressed oxide regrowth. By
employing a two-component TLS model, we discern distinct prominent loss
channels for each resonator type and quantified the characteristic TLS loss of
the SAMs to be ~5x10^-7. We anticipate our passivation methodology to offer a
promising route toward industrial-scale qubit fabrication, particularly where
long-term device stability is critical.

Flat-band (FB) materials have emerged as promising platforms for exploring
exotic quantum phases. While numerous candidates have recently been identified
through spectroscopic techniques such as angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy, central challenges remain on how to tune FBs towards the Fermi
level $E_F$ and to understand their impact on low-energy excitations probed in
electronic transport experiments. Here, we show that, by attributing the
temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity at elevated temperatures
to electron-phonon interband scattering, one can infer the position of FBs near
$E_F$ across diverse material classes. As charge carriers scatter off phonons,
interband transitions into FB states lead to distinctive sub- or superlinear
resistivity at elevated temperatures, governed by the proximity of the FB to
$E_F$. Our phenomenological model captures these universal transport behaviors
observed across several recently studied FB compounds and offers a simple,
broadly applicable method for detecting flat bands.

The discovery of Ruddlesden-Popper (R-P) nickelate superconductors under high
pressure heralds a new chapter of high-transition temperature (high-Tc)
superconductivity. Recently, ambient-pressure superconductivity is achieved in
R-P bilayer nickelate thin films through epitaxial compressive strain,
unlocking in-depth investigations into the superconducting characteristics.
Here, through electrical transport study, we report the observation of
spin-glass superconductivity with hysteretic magnetoresistance and glass-like
dynamics in the bilayer nickelate (La, Pr, Sm)3Ni2O7 films. The
superconductivity develops in a two-step transition, with onset Tc exceeding 50
K and zero-resistance Tc around 15 K. Remarkably, magnetoresistance hysteresis,
indicative of time-reversal symmetry breaking, is observed exclusively during
the second-step transition to zero resistance. The hysteresis is observed under
both out-of-plane and in-plane magnetic fields with significant anisotropy, and
exhibits coalescing minima at zero field, fundamentally distinct from trapped
vortices or long-range-ordered magnetism with coercivity. Successive oxygen
reductions simultaneously suppress the superconductivity and hysteresis,
revealing their mutual connections to the selective electronic orbitals. The
removal of magnetic field triggers spontaneous and logarithmically slow
resistance relaxations in the second-step transition, signatures of glassy
dynamics, indicating that the superconducting ground state is correlated with
an electronic spin-glass order. Our findings uncover an unprecedented
superconducting state in the nickelate superconductors, providing
phenomenological and conceptual advances for future investigations on high-Tc
superconductivity.

Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have achieved remarkable
accuracy on standard benchmarks, yet their ability to reproduce molecular
kinetics -- critical for reaction rate calculations -- remains largely
unexplored. We introduce Landscape17, a dataset of complete kinetic transition
networks (KTNs) for the molecules of the MD17 dataset, computed using
hybrid-level density functional theory. Each KTN contains minima, transition
states, and approximate steepest-descent paths, along with energies, forces,
and Hessian eigenspectra at stationary points. We develop a comprehensive test
suite to evaluate the MLIP ability to reproduce these reference landscapes and
apply it to a number of state-of-the-art architectures. Our results reveal
limitations in current MLIPs: all the models considered miss over half of the
DFT transition states and generate stable unphysical structures throughout the
potential energy surface. Data augmentation with pathway configurations
improves reproduction of DFT potential energy surfaces, resulting in
significant improvement in the global kinetics. However, these models still
produce many spurious stable structures, indicating that current MLIP
architectures face underlying challenges in capturing the topology of molecular
potential energy surfaces. The Landscape17 benchmark provides a straightforward
but demanding test of MLIPs for kinetic applications, requiring only up to a
few hours of compute time. We propose this test for validation of

- **TL;DR**: 该研究发现许多平衡和非平衡系统的稳态分布近似满足类似玻尔兹曼分布的形式，其中状态的一个局部动力学性质扮演能量的角色。通过研究一维粒子系统和Sherrington-Kirkpatrick自旋玻璃的随机动力学，首次提供了这种相关性的显式估计。

A growing body of theoretical and empirical evidence shows that the global
steady-state distributions of many equilibrium and nonequilibrium systems
approximately satisfy an analogue of the Boltzmann distribution, with a local
dynamical property of states playing the role of energy. The correlation
between the effective potential of the steady-state distribution and the
logarithm of the exit rates determines the quality of this approximation. We
demonstrate and explain this phenomenon in a simple one-dimensional particle
system and in random dynamics of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin glass by
providing the first explicit estimates of this correlation. We find that, as
parameters of the dynamics vary, each system exhibits a threshold above and
below which the correlation dramatically differs. We explain how these
thresholds arise from underlying transitions in the relationship between the
local and global "parts" of the effective potential.

Negative magnetoresistance in Dirac semimetals is conventionally considered
as a manifestation of chiral magnetic effect (CME), by means of a postulated
Chiral Kinetic equation. In this paper we study magnetoconductivity in large
Fermi energy Dirac semimetals, in one of which (ZrTe$_5$) the effect was
observed for the first time. Starting with a Hamiltonian for a semi-realistic
model of such a Dirac semimetal, we apply the Non-equilibrium Diagram Technique
(NDT, or the Keldysh technique) to derive the kinetic equations, to investigate
the electrons relaxation due to interaction with phonons and disorder, and,
finally, to calculate the DC magnetoconductivity (the longitudinal to magnetic
field component of conductivity) as a function of magnetic field strength and
temperature. Finally, we compare the obtained temperature dependencies with
available to us experimental data.

### Advancing Quantum Transport Calculations: An Effective Medium Theory with Plane-Wave Basis and PAW Potentials in Eigenstates

- **TL;DR**: 本文提出了一种基于密度泛函理论的有效介质理论(EMT-PW)，通过三种方法计算传输系数，并与NEGF-DFT方法进行比较，展示了在纳米器件电流特性分析中的优势。

We present an effective medium theory based on density functional theory that
is implemented in VASP using the PAW method with a plane wave basis set. The
transmission coefficient is derived through three complementary approaches: the
current density relation J=nqv, the field operator method, and the
nonquilibrium Green's function formalism. We compare transmission coefficients
calculated using EMT-PW with results from NEGF-DFT, based on the NanoDCAL
package utilizing a linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) basis set, for
both periodic and nonperiodic boundary conditions. The minor discrepancies
observed are attributed to differences in basis sets, pseudopotentials, and the
treatment of lead regions. Notably, the EMT-PW framework avoids the common
issue of overcompleteness encountered in non-equilibrium transport theories and
allows for the decomposition of the total transmission coefficient into
contributions from individual eigenstates. Furthermore, when combined with an
effective gate model, EMT-PW is shown to be a powerful tool for analyzing
current characteristics in nanodevices under applied gate voltages. By
leveraging one-electron wavefunctions in eigenstates, this method provides a
robust foundation for exploring the quantum statistics of electrons and current
quantum correlations within the second quantization framework.

### A simulation-based training framework for machine-learning applications in ARPES

- **TL;DR**: 开发了开源合成ARPES光谱模拟器aurelia，用于生成训练机器学习模型所需的大规模数据集，并通过训练卷积神经网络验证了模拟数据在光谱质量评估任务中的有效性

In recent years, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) has
advanced significantly in its ability to probe more observables and
simultaneously generate multi-dimensional datasets. These advances present new
challenges in data acquisition, processing, and analysis. Machine learning (ML)
models can drastically reduce the workload of experimentalists; however, the
lack of training data for ML -- and in particular deep learning -- is a
significant obstacle. In this work, we introduce an open-source synthetic ARPES
spectra simulator - aurelia - for the purpose of generating the large datasets
necessary to train ML models. As a demonstration, we train a convolutional
neural network to evaluate ARPES spectra quality -- a critical task performed
during the initial sample alignment phase of the experiment. We benchmark the
simulation-trained model against actual experimental data and find that it can
assess the spectra quality more accurately than human analysis, and swiftly
identify the optimal measurement region with high precision. Thus, we establish
that simulated ARPES spectra can be an effective proxy for experimental spectra
in training ML models.

- **TL;DR**: 通过微角解射光电子能谱技术研究4Hb-TaS2中的手性充电密度波，发现其中存在左右手性域共存现象，而且层间耦合弱于纯1T相

We use micro-angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (micro-ARPES) to
investigate chiral charge density waves (CDWs) in 4Hb-TaS$_2$ with micron-scale
spatial resolution. In the 1T layers of 4Hb-TaS$_2$, we uncover coexisting
left- and right-handed CDW domains and resolve four distinct spectral patterns
arising from the interplay of chirality and rotational stacking. In contrast,
bulk 1T-TaS$_2$ exhibits a uniform chirality. In addition, 4Hb-TaS$_2$ shows
negligible out-of-plane dispersion of the 1T-derived bands, in contrast to the
pronounced interlayer coupling observed in bulk 1T-TaS$_2$. Density functional
theory (DFT) calculations corroborate this picture, revealing that the
interlayer interaction of the chiral order in 4Hb-TaS$_2$ is nearly two orders
of magnitude weaker than in the 1T polytype. Our findings establish 4Hb-TaS$_2$
as a quasi-two-dimensional platform for exploring tunable chiral CDW phenomena.

### Universal Multistate Kinetic Models for the In-Silico Discovery of Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters

- **TL;DR**: 开发了KinLuv多态动力学模型，包含高阶激发态和Herzberg-Teller振动耦合效应，成功预测TADF材料的光物理性能

Many thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters exhibit complex
photophysical behaviors that cannot be fully captured by the conventional three
state model (S0, S1, T1). The lack of kinetic models that incorporate vibronic
coupling effects and high lying excited states has long limited the systematic
understanding and rational design of these materials. To address this, we
developed KinLuv, an extended multistate kinetic model that not only includes
higher lying excited states (S2, T2) but also accounts for the Herzberg Teller
(HT) vibronic coupling in the rate constant calculations. Applied to two
representative TADF emitters, i.e., DOBNA and DiKTa, KinLuv successfully
predicts photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY) and prompt/delayed
fluorescence lifetimes in good agreement with reported experimental results.
These findings highlight that incorporating HT vibronic coupling effects and
higher lying excited states is essential for quantitatively modeling TADF
mechanisms and guiding the design of high performance emitters.

- **TL;DR**: 本文通过考虑零熵事件概率，改进了基于涨落定理的有限时间热力学不确定性关系，获得了更严格的热力学电流涨落界限

Fluctuation theorems establish that thermodynamic processes at the microscale
can occasionally result in negative entropy production. At the microscale,
another distinct possibility becomes more likely: processes where no entropy is
produced overall. In this work, we explore the constraints imposed by such
null-entropy events on the fluctuations of thermodynamic currents. By
incorporating the probability of null-entropy events, we obtain tighter bounds
on finite-time thermodynamic uncertainty relations derived from fluctuation
theorems. We validate this framework using an example of a qudit SWAP engine.

### Observation of negative orbital torque from Vanadium

- **TL;DR**: 研究发现钙金属V产生负的轨道扭矩，证实了钙金属V中存在负的轨道射射效应，具有高的有效轨道射射电导率和长轨道滴漏长度。

We present systematic investigations of orbital torques generated from the
light metal $V$, revealing a negative orbital torque. We observe that the
damping-like torque (DLT) per unit electric field depends on the choice of the
ferromagnetic layer, with approximately seven times higher torque efficiency in
$Ni/V$ as compared to $Fe_{60}Co_{20}B_{20}/V$. We find the sign of DLT per
unit electric field from $V$ is opposite to that from $Pt$. These results
collectively confirm the existence of negative orbital Hall effect (OHE) in
$V$. Furthermore, the DLT per unit electric field increases with the $V$ layer
thickness, maintaining the negative sign at all thicknesses. We also note that
the DLT per unit electric field exceeds that of the $Pt$ reference samples at
higher $V$ thicknesses. Through fitting using the drift-diffusion equation, we
extract a high effective orbital Hall conductivity of $-(1.46 \pm
0.09)\,\frac{\hbar}{2e}\,\times 10^{5}\,\Omega^{-1}\,\mathrm{m}^{-1}$ and a
long orbital diffusion length of $(13.7 \pm 0.9)\,\mathrm{nm}$ in $V$. .

The work function and cleavage energy of a surface are critical properties
that determine the viability of materials in electronic emission applications,
semiconductor devices, and heterogeneous catalysis. While first principles
calculations are accurate in predicting these properties, their computational
expense combined with the vast search space of surfaces make a comprehensive
screening approach with density functional theory (DFT) infeasible. Here, we
introduce FIRE-GNN (Force-Informed, Relaxed Equivariance Graph Neural Network),
which integrates surface-normal symmetry breaking and machine learning
interatomic potential (MLIP)-derived force information, achieving a twofold
reduction in mean absolute error (down to 0.065 eV) over the previous
state-of-the-art for work function prediction. We additionally benchmark recent
invariant and equivariant architectures, analyze the impact of symmetry
breaking, and evaluate out-of-distribution generalization, demonstrating that
FIRE-GNN consistently outperforms competing models for work function
predictions. This model enables accurate and rapid predictions of the work
function and cleavage energy across a vast chemical space and facilitates the
discovery of materials with tuned surface properties

- **TL;DR**: EuTe4是一种层状磁性半导体，其电荷密度波状态在650K高温下仍保持稳定，具有优异的塞贝克系数（500 uVK-1）和低热导率（0.02 Wcm-1K-1），热电优值zT达到0.22

We investigate the layered magnetic semiconductor EuTe4, focusing on its
intricate charge-density wave (CDW) states near and above room temperature
through single-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD), magnetic, and thermoelectric
measurements.The XRD measurement revealed that the CDW state inducing the polar
lattice distortion persists even at 650 K, demonstrating its remarkable thermal
stability. Notably, the Seebeck coefficient near room temperature reaches
values exceeding 500 uVK-1. This large Seebeck coefficient, not fully captured
by a simple band calculation, is comparable to those observed in heavy-electron
semiconducting oxides, suggesting the importance of electron correlation and
spin/lattice instabilities. Furthermore, potentially reflecting the competition
of two types of CDW states, the thermal conductivity near room temperature is
as low as 0.02 Wcm-1K-1. As a result, the thermoelectric figure of merit zT
reaches 0.22 at 460 K. These findings establish EuTe4 as a compelling platform
to explore novel types of thermoelectric materials with multiple electronic
instability.

### Chemical and Conformational Control of the Spectroscopic Properties of Multi-Layer and Multi-Defect Carbon Dots

Carbon dots (CDs) are renowned for their bright and tunable photoluminescence
(PL), stability, and biocompatibility, yet it remains challenging to link their
heterogeneous structures to their spectroscopic properties. This study utilizes
density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) to
systematically investigate how the spectroscopic properties of CDs of complex
CDs with multiple layers and multiples defects are determined by their
structures and compositions. Calculations reveal that strongly oxidizing
groups, such as carbonyl and carbonyl acetate, significantly redshift
absorption and emission spectra. In contrast, less oxidizing groups, such as
hydroxyl, behave as spectators with minimal impact on absorption and emission,
except when they interact strongly with more oxidizing groups. We find that not
only the excitation energy, but also the excitation character itself is
impacted by the presence of specific groups, and the pH-dependence of the
spectroscopic properties can be attributed to their protonation state-dependent
excitation character. We show that the twisting, sliding, and linker-mediated
folding of surface-functionalized layers in CDs markedly alter excitation
energies and characters, offering a molecular explanation for experimentally
observed emission intermittency and polarization fluctuations. These insights
provide strategies for optimizing CDs for various applications, including
bioimaging, photocatalysis, and optoelectronic devices.

Mechanical cantilevers are central to nanotechnology, with ultimate
sensitivity achieved at the atomic limit, where low bending rigidity makes
stability the fundamental challenge. Here, we introduce a wrinkle-induced
stiffening approach that enhances the bending rigidity of monolayer graphene by
several orders of magnitude, enabling the fabrication of mechanically robust
graphene cantilevers. When suspended over microcavities, these wrinkled
membranes exhibit significant increases in both in-plane and out-of-plane
stiffness, as confirmed by nanoindentation and resonance measurements, which
also reveal that enhanced bending rigidity strongly influences their
vibrational response. This behavior marks a transition from tension-dominated
mechanics to a regime where bending effects become prominent, even in a single
atomic layer. By sculpting these structures, we realize graphene cantilevers
with measured bending rigidities between $10^6$ and $10^7$ eV, while
maintaining femtogram-scale mass. These findings open new directions in
nanomechanical sensing and cantilever-based technologies.

Ball milling is a powerful synthetic tool for discovering new inorganic
materials. Inspired by the high ionic conductivity in Li$_2$ZrCl$_6$
synthesized via mechanochemistry, we synthesized MgZrCl$_6$ with a similar
method. High resolution synchrotron X-ray diffraction shows that MgZrCl$_6$ is
poorly crystalline after ball milling, but crystallizes in a layered hexagonal
structure ($P31c$) after heat treatment. In situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction
reveals a narrow temperature window around 400 {\deg}C in which crystallization
occurs. At higher temperatures the phase decomposes. Pair distribution function
analysis shows 2D sheets of MgZrCl$_6$ form after milling, with heating driving
3D crystallization. Raman spectroscopy also shows evidence of MgZrCl$_6$ after
milling. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy does not reveal ionic
conductivity in MgZrCl$_6$ (limit of detection ca. $1.4 \times 10^{-8}$ S/cm).
In addition to supporting existing design rules for Mg-based solid
electrolytes, this work shows the power of ball milling to synthesize
temperature-sensitive inorganic compounds with high yield.

### Intrinsic Strain-Driven Topological Evolution in SrRuO3 via Flexural Strain Engineering

Strain engineering offers a powerful route to tailor topological electronic
structures in correlated oxides, yet conventional epitaxial strain approaches
introduce extrinsic factors such as substrate-induced phase transitions and
crystalline quality variations, which makes the unambiguous identification of
the intrinsic strain effects challenging. Here, we develop a flexural strain
platform based on van der Waals epitaxy and flexible micro-fabrication,
enabling precise isolation and quantification of intrinsic strain effects on
topological electronic structures in correlated oxides without extrinsic
interference. Through strain-dependent transport measurements of the Weyl
semimetal SrRuO3, we observed a significant enhancement of anomalous Hall
conductivity by 21% under a tiny strain level of 0.2%, while longitudinal
resistivity remains almost constant -- a hallmark of intrinsic topological
response. First-principles calculations reveal a distinct mechanism where
strain-driven non-monotonic evolution of Weyl nodes across the Fermi level,
exclusively governed by lattice constant modulation, drives the striking AHC
behavior. Our work not only highlights the pivotal role of pure lattice strain
in topological regulation but also establishes a universal platform for
designing flexible topological oxide devices with tailored functionalities.

Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) is a widely used method to
investigate electron dynamics under external time-dependent perturbations such
as laser fields. In this work, we present a novel approach to accelerate
electron dynamics simulations based on real time TDDFT using autoregressive
neural operators as time-propagators for the electron density. By leveraging
physics-informed constraints and featurization, and high-resolution training
data, our model achieves superior accuracy and computational speed compared to
traditional numerical solvers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on
a class of one-dimensional diatomic molecules under the influence of a range of
laser parameters. This method has potential in enabling real-time, on-the-fly
modeling of laser-irradiated molecules and materials with varying experimental
parameters.

### On the nature and charge state of the X-Defect, a radiation-induced Silicon defect with field-enhanced charge carrier emission

The elusive X-Defect, a defect found in low-resistivity $p$-type Silicon
after irradiation, observed as a low-temperature shoulder of the
$\mathrm{B}_\mathrm{i}\mathrm{O}_\mathrm{i}$ defect
(Boron-interstitial-Oxygen-interstitial complex) in Thermally Stimulated
Current (TSC) measurements, was investigated to determine its properties,
matching them with those of a previously identified defect. Through a
combination of TSC, Deep-Level Transient Spectroscopy (DLTS), Difference-DLTS
(DDLTS), numerical simulations of field-enhanced charge carrier emissions in
TSC measurements and a comparison to literature, the X-Defect was identified as
the singly positively charged Silicon di-vacancy $\mathrm{V}_2(+/0)$. This
assignment is supported by an agreement in activation energy, capture
cross-section, trap type and charge emission process, as well as simulations
comparing the effects of phonon-assisted tunnelling (PAT) and Poole-Frenkel
(PF) mechanisms on TSC spectra. DDTLS measurements revealed a quadratic
dependence of the activation energy on the electric field strength, confirming
PAT as the prevailing mechanism over PF in the case of the radiation-induced
X-Defect. Assigning the X-Defect to an electrically neutral defect in the space
charge region resolves previous contradictions regarding its deficiency in
impacting on the effective doping concentration.

- **TL;DR**: 这篇论文通过非微氧方法分析了平行几何一维金属中的多股范德协作用，反驳了之前认为偶数数量股会更稳定的假说，发现奇数股数的数据包具有更低的总能量。

Parallel quasi-one-dimensional metals are known to experience strong
dispersion (van der Waals, vdW) interactions that fall off unusually slowly
with separation between the metals. Examples include nanotube brushes,
nano-wire arrays, and also common biological structures. In a many-stranded
bundle, there are potentially strong multi-strand vdW interactions that go
beyond a simple sum of negative (attractive) pairwise inter-strand energies.
Perturbative analysis showed that these contributions alternate in sign, with
the odd (triplet, quintuplet, ...) terms being positive (repulsive). The
triplet case leds to the intriguing speculation that these strands may prefer
to coalesce into even-numbered bundles, which could have implications for the
formation kinetics of DNA, for example. Here we use a non-perturbative vdW
energy analysis to show that this conjecture is not true in general. As our
counter-example we consider 6 strands and show that 2 well-separated bundles of
3 strands have a more negative total vdW energy than 3 well-separated bundles
of 2 strands ( i.e. an odd-number preference). We also discuss a bundle of 6
strands and explore the relative contributions beyond pairwise interactions.

properties have been computed using four different approximations: independent
particle approximation (IPA), IPA with scissor correction (IQPA), random phase
approximation for local-field effects (LFEs), and the Bethe-Salpeter equation
(BSE). The estimated highest value of the imaginary part of the dielectric
function using IQPA is 7 at 2 eV, which slightly decreases to 5.7 due to LFEs.
Within BSE, the peak value is obtained to be maximum at 1.6 eV with a magnitude
of 10.8, which indicates the strong excitonic effect below the optical gap.
Large number of bright and dark bound excitons are found, where the binding
energies of four main bound bright excitons are found in the range of 299-350
meV. The exciton amplitude in both reciprocal and real space is analyzed. The
main bound bright exciton is localized in the reciprocal space, while this
exhibits a delocalized nature in real space. The BSE predicts a highest
absorption coefficient of 3.6 $\times$ $10^{6}$ cm$^{-1}$ at 1.7 eV, while a
minimum reflectivity in the active region of the solar energy spectrum is
obtained to be around 2.7\%. Finally, the solar efficiency has been estimated
using the spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency approach and obtained
highest value is 15.5% at a thickness of 0.5 $\mu$m. These findings reveal a
significant excitonic effect in the absorption spectra of RbTlCl$_{3}$ and
highlight its potential as a promising material for single-junction thin-film
solar cells.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文提出了一种改进的Hubbard U校正方法，通过仔细分离局域化和离域化态，准确预测三元铀酸盐的电子态和结构畸变，解决了传统U校正对杂化态描述不佳的问题。

Accurately modeling compounds with partially filled $d$ and $f$ shells
remains a hard challenge for density-functional theory, due to large
self-interaction errors stemming from local or semi-local exchange-correlation
functionals. Hubbard $U$ corrections can mitigate such errors, but are often
detrimental to the description of hybridized states, leading to spurious force
contributions and wrong lattice structures. Here, we show that careful
disentanglement of localized and delocalized states leads to accurate
predictions of electronic states and structural distortions in ternary
monouranates (AUO$_4$, where A represents Mn, Co, or Ni), for which standard
$U$ corrections generally fail. Crucial to achieving such accuracy is a
minimization of the mismatch between the spatial extension of the projector
functions and the true coordination geometry. This requires Wannier-like
alternatives to atomic-orbital projector functions, or corrections of Hubbard
manifolds exclusively comprised of the most localized A-$3d$, U-$5f$ and O-$2p$
orbitals. These findings open up the computational prediction of fundamental
properties of actinide solids of critical technological importance.

Despite the significant application potential of laser powder bed fusion
(L-PBF) processed Ti-6Al-4V components, a detailed understanding of their
deformation mechanisms remains limited. This study investigates the deformation
behavior of the {\alpha^\prime} and {\alpha} phases in the as-built and
heat-treated specimens, respectively, using in-situ high-energy X-ray
diffraction (HEXRD) combined with crystal plasticity modeling. Both phases
exhibited similar elastic anisotropy, with the highest modulus along \{00.2\}
and the lowest along \{10.0\}, although the {\alpha} phase consistently showed
higher directional moduli than the {\alpha^\prime} phase. Their plastic
deformation responses differed markedly: in the as-built {\alpha^\prime} phase,
slip activation followed the sequence prismatic \rightarrow basal \rightarrow
pyramidal I \langle c+a \rangle, whereas in the heat-treated {\alpha} phase,
the sequence was basal \rightarrow prismatic \rightarrow pyramidal I \langle
c+a \rangle. Analyses of full width at half maximum (FWHM) and diffraction peak
intensities further supported these observations. Finally, inverse modeling
within a crystal plasticity framework was employed to determine slip
family--specific critical resolved shear stresses (CRSS), revealing higher CRSS
values in the {\alpha^\prime} phase for all slip systems except the prismatic
family.

The structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of (100)-oriented
Co$_{2}$MnAl/MgO and Co$_{2}$MnAl/GaAs heterostructures are investigated using
plane-wave pseudopotential density functional theory. For the Co$_{2}$MnAl/MgO,
CoCo-MgMg, CoCo-OO, MnAl-MgMg, and MnAl-OO interfaces in top-to-top
configurations are studied, while for Co$_{2}$MnAl/GaAs, both top-to-top
(Co-Ga, Co-As, Mn-Ga, Mn-As, Al-Ga, Al-As) and bridge-site (CoCo-Ga, CoCo-As,
MnAl-Ga, MnAl-As) interfaces are considered. The interfacial geometries
featuring Co- or CoCo-atomic terminations for the Co2MnAl slab exhibit larger
adhesion energies compared to those terminated with Mn-, Al-, or MnAl-atomic
terminations. This indicates their greater interfacial stability. In contrast,
MnAl-, Mn-, or Al-terminated interfaces preserve near half-metallicity, whereas
Co- and CoCo-terminated geometries display a strongly metallic character. All
studied interfaces show enhanced magnetic moments relative to their bulk
counterparts, primarily arising from interfacial atoms and their nearest
neighbours. These findings offer valuable insights for optimizing Co2MnAl-based
heterostructures in spintronic applications.

### Symmetries in zero and finite center-of-mass momenta excitons

We present a symmetry-based framework for the analysis of excitonic states,
incorporating both time-reversal and space-group symmetries. We demonstrate the
use of time-reversal and space-group symmetries to obtain exciton eigenstates
at symmetry-related center-of-mass momenta in the entire Brillouin zone from
eigenstates calculated for center-of-mass momenta in the irreducible Brillouin
zone. Furthermore, by explicitly calculating the irreducible representations of
the little groups, we classify excitons according to their symmetry properties
across the Brillouin zone. Using projection operators, we construct
symmetry-adapted linear combinations of electron-hole product states, which
block-diagonalize the Bethe-Salpeter Equation (BSE) Hamiltonian at both zero
and finite exciton center-of-mass momenta. This enables a transparent
organization of excitonic states and provides direct access to their
degeneracies, selection rules, and symmetry-protected features. As a
demonstration, we apply this formalism to monolayer MoS$_{2}$, where the
classification of excitonic irreducible representations and the block structure
of the BSE Hamiltonian show excellent agreement with compatibility relations
derived from group theory. Beyond this material-specific example, the framework
offers a general and conceptually rigorous approach to the symmetry
classification of excitons, enabling significant reductions in computational
cost for optical spectra, exciton-phonon interactions, and excitonic band
structure calculations across a wide range of materials.

The sequence of phase transitions in PbHf0.83Sn0.17O3 has been studied by
THz, far infrared and Raman spectroscopies, revealing the complementary
behaviour of both, polar and non-polar phonons and their impact on the
transition lattice dynamics. Pb atom is sensitive to all phase transitions,
changing its dynamics with temperature. As temperature decreases, the crystal
undergoes a sequence of three phase transitions. The first one to an
intermediate (IM) phase, in which polar fluctuations are detected by THz and IR
spectroscopy at frequencies below 100 cm-1 contributing to the maximum of
permittivity and revealing important softening. Additional antipolar Pb
fluctuations and softening were detected by Raman spectroscopy. At lower
temperature, another transition to an antiferroelectric (AFE2) phase is
revealed by nonpolar soft modes (antipolar and antiferrodistortive ones), and
by an important drop of the dielectric strength of polar phonons. The final
transition to the antiferroelectric phase (AFE1) is revealed by the appearance
of new modes and a sudden change in the frequency of the soft modes when the
antipolar shifts become larger. Using symmetry analysis and optical observation
to study how the domain pattern changes with temperature, we identified a path
for the cubic-AFE2 transition throughout the IM phase, of plausible tetragonal
symmetry, driven by an instability from the center of the Brillouin zone. This
mechanism coexists with antiferrodistortive instabilities that eventually drive
the material into the AFE2 phase. The final phase transition to the AFE1 phase
naturally follows from a mode outside the center of the Brillouin zone and a
further doubling of the unit cell.

- **TL;DR**: 本文研究了氟化物结构铁电材料中掺杂剂对性能的影响，提出了共掺杂解决方案来改善可靠性、结晶行为和极化特性，并展示了共掺杂在多个应用领域的优势。

Fluorite structure ferroelectrics, especially hafnium oxide, are widely
investigated for their application in non-volatile memories, sensors,
actuators, RF devices and energy harvesters. Due to the metastable nature of
the ferroelectric phase in these materials, dopants and process parameters need
to be optimized for its stabilization. Here, we present clear evidence of how
dopants affect the properties in this material system and solutions to achieve
improved reliability, desired crystallization behavior and polarization
hysteresis shape/position through co-doping. Finally, the benefits of co-doping
in a variety of application fields are demonstrated.
