The interaction of highly-charged ions with monolayers of graphene and MoS2
is theoretically investigated based on nonequilibrium Green Functions (NEGF).
In a recent paper [Niggas et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 086802 (2022)] dramatic
differences in the response of the two materials to an impacting slow ion were
reported. Here, this analysis is extended, focusing on the effect of
electron-electron correlations in the monolayer on the electronic response to
the ion. We apply the recently developed time-linear G1-G2 scheme [Schluenzen
et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 124, 076601 (2020)] combined with an embedding
approach [Balzer et al., Phys. Rev. B 107, 155141 (2023)]. We demonstrate that,
while electronic correlations have a minor effect in graphene, they
significantly influence the electron dynamics in the case of MoS2. Our key
results are the ultrafast dynamics of the charge density and induced
electrostatic potential in the vicinity of the impact point of the ion.

### Electrostatic gating and the interference of chiral Majoranas in thin slabs of magnetic topological insulators

- **TL;DR**: 该研究通过静电门控调控手性马约拉纳模的干涉效应，在磁性拓扑绝缘体薄膜中实现了门控可调的马约拉纳二极管效应和特征振荡模式。

We study the interference of chiral Majoranas in a magnetic topological
insulator thin slab having a grounded section proximity coupled to a
superconductor and another section under the influence of top-bottom
electrostatic gating. The gated section locally widens an energy gap and
mediates the coupling between the quantum anomalous Hall states of the leads
and the chiral Majorana states of the proximitized sector. Local and non-local
conductances offer measurable hints of the existence of transport mediated by
chiral Majorana modes. Local conductances on the two leads reveal
characteristic oscillatory patterns as a function of the gating strength, with
peculiar correlations depending on the distance between gated and proximitized
sectors. A gate tunable Majorana diode effect on nonlocal conductances emerges
when the chemical potential deviates from zero. We suggest a protocol to
identify chiral Majorana physics based on a sequence of electrostatic gates
that allows the tuning of chiral Majorana interference.

- **TL;DR**: 基于单分子二自由基的粒子交换量子热机，在低温下通过Kondo关联显著提升功率输出和效率，达到Curzon-Ahlborn极限的53%

Particle-exchange heat engines operate without moving parts or time-dependent
driving, relying solely on static energy-selective transport. Here, we realize
a particle-exchange quantum heat engine based on a single diradical molecule,
only a few nanometers in size. We experimentally investigate its operation at
low temperatures and demonstrate that both the power output and efficiency are
significantly enhanced by Kondo correlations, reaching up to 53 % of the
Curzon-Ahlborn limit. These results establish molecular-scale particle-exchange
engines as promising candidates for low-temperature applications where extreme
miniaturization and energy efficiency are paramount.

### Resonant transport and line-type resonances in tilted Dirac cone double-barrier structures

- **TL;DR**: 研究石墨烯双势垒结构中狄拉克锥倾斜对狄拉克费米子传输特性的影响，发现倾斜角度会改变费米面重叠和共振峰特征

We study the transport properties of Dirac fermions in a graphene-based
double-barrier structure composed of two tilted-cone regions separated by a
central pristine graphene region. Using the transfer matrix method, we
systematically analyze how different cone tilts affect Dirac fermion
transmission. In reciprocal space, at fixed energy, the Dirac cones of distinct
regions generate isoenergetic conical surfaces (Fermi surfaces). When these
surfaces overlap, their intersections define ``active surfaces'' that enable
fermion transmission. In the symmetric double-barrier configuration, coupling
between the barriers and the central well gives rise to multiple resonance
peaks, including line-type resonances, even within nominally forbidden energy
zones. The number and positions of these resonances depend sensitively on the
system parameters. These findings provide new insights into the role of Dirac
cone tilt in complex junctions and may guide the design of nanoelectronic
devices based on two-dimensional tilted-cone materials such as
$\alpha$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$I$_3$ and borophene.

- **TL;DR**: FDTRImageEnhancer是一个开源计算框架，通过结合物理基础的Gaussian卷积抽象和微结构感知深度学习，从FDTR相位数据改进热导率映射。

We present FDTRImageEnhancer, an open-source computational framework that
improves thermal conductivity mapping from Frequency Domain ThermoReflectance
(FDTR) phase data by integrating a physics-based Gaussian convolution
abstraction with microstructure-aware deep learning. The Gaussian kernel models
the spatial averaging effects of pump and probe beams, while k-means clustering
of high-resolution structural images reduces the parameter space for inverse
modeling. A physics-informed neural network jointly minimizes phase-data error
and deviation from analytically recovered conductivity maps, enabling the
detection of grain boundary thermal conductivity drops visually obscured in
conventional FDTR inversions. Demonstrated on finite element-generated
synthetic data, the framework recovers bulk values within less than 0.5% error
and qualitatively resolves grain boundary effects despite limited image
resolution. Full Python code and datasets are provided for reproducibility,
with the methodology readily adaptable to other inverse thermal transport
problems.

### Selectively enabling linear combination of atomic orbital coefficients to improve linear method optimizations in variational Monte Carlo

- **TL;DR**: 本文开发了一种扩展-剪枝选择性线性组合原子轨道算法，用于解决二阶随机优化方法中不重要参数对重要参数更新的负面影响问题。

Second order stochastic optimization methods, such as the linear method,
couple the updates of different parameters and, in so doing, allow statistical
uncertainty in one parameter to affect the update of other parameters. In
simple tests, we demonstrate that the presence of unimportant orbital
optimization parameters, even when initialized to zero, seriously degrade the
statistical quality of the linear method's update for important orbital
parameters. To counteract this issue, we develop an expand-and-prune selective
linear combination of atomic orbitals algorithm that removes unimportant
parameters from the variational set on the fly. In variational Monte Carlo
orbital optimizations in propene, butene, and pentadiene, we find that large
fractions of the parameters can be safely removed, and that doing so can
increase the efficacy of the overall optimization.

### Orbital-selective two-gap superconductivity in kagome metal CsV3Sb5

Recent experiments have revealed anisotropic multigap superconductivity in
the kagome metal CsV3Sb5. However, the interplay between its multi-orbital
character and electron-phonon coupling (EPC) in governing multiple
superconducting gaps remains incompletely understood. In this work, we
theoretically investigate the superconducting gap of CsV3Sb5 by combining
first-principles calculations with superconducting density functional theory
(SCDFT). Our results demonstrate that orbital-selective pairing drives the
observed two-gap superconductivity in CsV3Sb5. Specifically, the two distinct
gaps exhibit strong orbital dependence: a large, highly anisotropic gap
(average magnitude ~0.64 meV) primarily originates from V-3d orbitals, while a
small, isotropic gap (~0.25 meV) is associated with the Sb-5pz orbital. The
V-3d orbitals strongly couple to the in-plane V-V bond-stretching and
out-of-plane V-Sb bending phonon modes, whereas the kagome-plane Sb-5pz orbital
weakly interacts with Cs shearing phonon mode. Moreover, our calculations
reveal EPC-induced band renormalization, manifested as kinks at approximately
-13 meV and -30 meV in the electronic dispersion, consistent with prior
experimental observations. These findings provide fundamental insights into the
orbital-selective superconductivity and EPC mechanisms in kagome CsV3Sb5.

### A Universal Thermodynamic Inequality: Scaling Relations Between Current, Activity, and Entropy Production

- **Categories**: cond-mat.stat-mech
- **TL;DR**: 该论文推导了一个普适的热力学界限，约束非平衡系统中的定向输运，建立了净速度平方、熵产生率和动力学活动之间的不等式关系。

We derive a universal thermodynamic bound constraining directional transport
in both discrete and continuous nonequilibrium systems. For continuous-time
Markov jump processes and overdamped diffusions governed by Fokker--Planck
equations, we prove the inequality $ \frac{2 V(t)^2}{A(t)} \leq \dot{e}_p(t), $
linking the squared net velocity $V(t)$, entropy production rate
$\dot{e}_p(t)$, and dynamical activity $A(t)$. This relation captures a
fundamental trade-off between transport, dissipation, and fluctuation
intensity, valid far from equilibrium and without detailed balance. In
addition, we introduce dimensionless thermodynamic ratios that quantify
dissipation asymmetry, entropy extraction, and relaxation. These scaling laws
unify discrete and continuous stochastic thermodynamics and provide
experimentally accessible constraints on transport efficiency in nanoscale
machines and active systems.

### Hunting for superconductivity in doped triangular lattice Kitaev magnets

Motivated by exploring correlated metals with frustrating bond-dependent
exchange interactions, we study hole and electron doped Kitaev Mott insulators
on the triangular lattice. Using homogeneous parton mean field theory, we find
that the stripe antiferromagnetic (AFM) order for Kitaev coupling $K&gt;0$ and the
ferromagnetic (FM) order for $K&lt;0$, both vanish at sufficiently large doping,
beyond which we find regimes with chiral $d\pm i d$ singlet pairing and $p\pm
ip$ triplet pairing respectively. Our tensor network computations however
reveal that the superconducting correlations are strongly suppressed; while FM
order stubbornly persists for the doped $K&lt;0$ model, the doped $K&gt;0$ model
features emergent spin-charge modulated stripe orders. At higher hole doping
for $K &gt; 0$, where AFM order is more strongly suppressed than for the electron
doped case, incorporating a sufficiently strong nearest-neighbor attraction
yields evidence for singlet $d$-wave superconductivity with Luttinger parameter
$K_{\rm sc} &lt; 1$. Our work sets the stage for a broader exploration of doping
effects in triangular lattice magnets such as NaRuO$_2$ which feature
bond-dependent exchange interactions.

### Spontaneous spiral patterns etched on Germanium

- **TL;DR**: 锌基金属蜜蜜在水存在下自发形成螺旋纳米结构，通过晶体缺陷的远场作用实现几何排序，量化验证了金属催化腐蚀模型。

Thin metal film on Germanium, in the presence of water, results in a
remarkable pattern forming system. Here we present an analysis of spirals
spontaneously etched on the Ge surface. We obtain measurements of the growth
dynamics of the spirals and measurements of the local strain field in the metal
film. Both indicate that the near geometric order of the pattern originates
from the unique far field of a singularity - a crystal defect. The measured
engraving profile is found in quantitative agreement with a model of metal
catalyzed corrosion of the Ge surface. Specifically, local etch depth is
inversely proportional to the normal velocity of the Ge-metal contact line. The
growth mechanism combines crack propagation, reaction diffusion dynamics, and
thin film mechanical instabilities, and illustrates how a defect's long range
field can impose geometric order in a non-equilibrium growth process. General
features relevant to other pattern forming systems are the coupling of
chemistry and mechanics and the singularity driven order.

### Correlations in the Binding Energy of Triexcitons and Biexcitons in Single CdSe/CdS Nanoplatelets Revealed by Heralded Spectroscopy

Semiconductor nanoplatelets present reduced Auger recombination, giving rise
to enhanced multiexciton emission. This virtue makes them good candidates to
investigate higher-order carrier dynamics, allowing to extract important
excitonic properties, such as biexciton and triexciton binding energies that
highly influence applications involving high excitation fluxes. Here, we
explore triexciton emission, emanating from single core/shell CdSe/CdS
nanoplatelets. We apply heralded post-selection of photon triplets using an
advanced home-built single-photon spectrometer in order to resolve the
triexciton$-$biexciton$-$exciton$-$ground state cascaded relaxation both in
time and spectrum, and unambiguously determine the triexciton relaxation route
and interaction nature. The results show a characteristic blue shift of the
biexciton and triexciton, pointing to repulsive multiexciton interaction in the
nanoplatelets under study. The relatively small measured energy shift of the
triexciton (5.9 $\pm$ 0.7 meV) indicates that it recombines through the 1S
bands rather than the 1P bands, in agreement with findings on other colloidal
quantum dot systems. Most importantly, the strong correlation between the
biexciton and triexciton binding energies, and the ability to tune them via
control of the particle dimensions and composition, paves the way for
developing emitters of nearly degenerate photon triplets.

### The non-contact assessment of the bridge expansion joint

- **TL;DR**: 开发了一种桥梁扩张结合部位噪声发放和技术状况评估方法，包括无死亡检测和数据处理方案

The aim of the paper is to provide information on a newly developed design
methodology for the evaluation of bridge expansion joints with respect to their
noise emission and overall technical condition. The methodology also gives
recommendations for operational non-destructive measurements of the condition
of bridge gates using a crossing laser sensors, CPX sensors or the necessary
technical equipment and the method of collecting, processing and evaluating the
measured data. The method can easily scan and evaluate geometry and/or noise
emission of extensive number of joints by passing them without traffic
interruption. The aim is to establish a methodology for comparing the noise and
condition of bridge expansion joints in the road network, both over time
(monitoring long-term trends in noise emission and degradation) and comparing
different states and different types of bridge closures between each other.

### A universal machine learning model for the electronic density of states

- **TL;DR**: 基于Point Edge Transformer架构的PET-MAD-DOS模型，通过机器学习预测任意组成和结构的电子能带密度，并能推演准确的股带缺口，在多种技术相关材料中达刻半定量一致性。

In the last few years several ``universal'' interatomic potentials have
appeared, using machine-learning approaches to predict energy and forces of
atomic configurations with arbitrary composition and structure, with an
accuracy often comparable with that of the electronic-structure calculations
they are trained on. Here we demonstrate that these generally-applicable models
can also be built to predict explicitly the electronic structure of materials
and molecules. We focus on the electronic density of states (DOS), and develop
PET-MAD-DOS, a rotationally unconstrained transformer model built on the Point
Edge Transformer (PET) architecture, and trained on the Massive Atomistic
Diversity (MAD) dataset. We demonstrate our model's predictive abilities on
samples from diverse external datasets, showing also that the DOS can be
further manipulated to obtain accurate band gap predictions. A fast evaluation
of the DOS is especially useful in combination with molecular simulations
probing matter in finite-temperature thermodynamic conditions. To assess the
accuracy of PET-MAD-DOS in this context, we evaluate the ensemble-averaged DOS
and the electronic heat capacity of three technologically relevant systems:
lithium thiophosphate (LPS), gallium arsenide (GaAs), and a high entropy alloy
(HEA). By comparing with bespoke models, trained exclusively on system-specific
datasets, we show that our universal model achieves semi-quantitative agreement
for all these tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fine-tuning can be
performed using a small fraction of the bespoke data, yielding models that are
comparable to, and sometimes better than, fully-trained bespoke models.

### Spontaneous Lattice Distortion in the Spin-Triplet Superconductor Cu$_{x}$Bi$_2$Se$_3$

The doped topological insulator Cu$_x$Bi$_2$Se$_3$ has attracted considerable
attention as a new platform for studying novel properties of spin-triplet and
topological superconductivity. In this work, we performed synchrotron x-ray
diffraction measurements on Cu$_x$Bi$_2$Se$_3$ (0.24$\leq x\leq$ 0.46) to
investigate the coupling between the superconducting order parameter and
crystal lattice. In the crystals in which the vector order parameter
(${\boldsymbol d}$ vector) is tilted from the crystal high-symmetry directions
as evidenced by nematic diamagnetic susceptibility, we find a sizable lattice
distortion ($\sim$100 ppm) associated with the onset of superconductivity. In
contrast, in crystals with the ${\boldsymbol d}$ vector aligned along the
high-symmetry directions, we find no appreciable change in lattice constant.
Together with a pronounced vestigial behavior of the distortion, the results
are clear evidence for an odd-parity $E_u$ order parameter that couples with
trigonal lattice. Furthermore, in the crystal with $x$ = 0.46 where diamagnetic
susceptibility is isotropic in the plane, no lattice distortion accompanying
the superconducting transition is found, which is in line with a chiral
superconducting state in the highly doped region. Our work shows that lattice
distortion can be a powerful diagnosing quantity for nematic superconductivity
with two-component order parameter.

### Memory-aware feedback enhances power in active information engines

- **TL;DR**: 研究在活性浴中运行的信息引擎，发现传统反馈策略在具有时间相关波动的活性环境中性能下降，提出了保留记忆的反馈协议来利用活性涨落的时间持续性

We study an information engine operating in an active bath, where a Brownian
particle confined in a harmonic trap undergoes feedback-driven displacement
cycles. Unlike thermal environments, active baths exhibit temporally correlated
fluctuations, introducing memory effects that challenge conventional feedback
strategies. Extending the framework of stochastic thermodynamics to account for
such memory, we analyze a feedback protocol that periodically shifts the
potential minimum based on noisy measurements of the particle's position. We
show that conventional feedback schemes, optimized for memoryless thermal
baths, can degrade performance in active media due to the disruption of
bath-particle memory by abrupt resetting. To overcome this degradation, we
introduce a class of memory-preserving feedback protocols that partially retain
the covariance between the particle's displacement and active noise, thereby
exploiting the temporal persistence of active fluctuations. Through asymptotic
analysis, we show how the feedback gain -- which quantifies the strength of
positional shifts -- nontrivially shapes the engine's work and power profiles.
In particular, we demonstrate that in active media, intermediate gains
outperform full-shift resetting. Our results reveal the critical interplay
between bath memory, measurement noise, and feedback gain, offering guiding
principles for designing high-performance information engines in nonequilibrium
environments.

### Unnecessary quantum criticality in $SU(3)$ kagome magnets

Algebraic/Dirac spin liquids (DSLs) are a class of critical quantum ground
states that do not have a quasi-particle description. DSLs and related spin
liquid phases often arise in strongly frustrated quantum spin systems, in which
strong correlations and quantum fluctuations among constituent spins persist
down to zero temperature. In this work, we analyze Mott insulating phases of
$SU(3)$ fermions on a kagome lattice which may realize a DSL phase, described
at low energies by $(2 + 1)d$ quantum electrodynamics (QED$_3$) with $N_f=6$
Dirac fermions. By analyzing the action of physical symmetries on the operators
of the QED$_3$ theory, we conclude that the low energy DSL is a quantum
critical point that can be accessed by tuning a single microscopic parameter.
Aided by the emergent symmetry and anomalies of the low energy effective
theory, we conjecture and present supporting arguments that the $SU(3)$ Kagome
magnet DSL is an unnecessary quantum critical point, lying completely within a
single phase.

### Enhanced Performance of FeFET Gate Stack via Heterogeneously co-doped Ferroelectric HfO$_2$ Films

- **TL;DR**: 通过空间控制的Zr和Al异质共掺杂调控HfO2薄膜，优化FeFETs中MFIS栅堆栈的性能和可靠性

In this work, we explore the impact of spatially controlled Zr and Al
heterogeneous co-doping in HfO$_2$ thin films tailored for
metal-ferroelectric-insulator-semiconductor (MFIS) gate stacks of ferroelectric
field effect transistors (FeFETs). By precisely modulating the vertical
arrangement of Zr and Al dopants during atomic layer deposition, we introduce
deliberate compositional gradients that affect crystallization dynamics during
subsequent annealing. This strategy enables us to systematically tune the phase
evolution and domain nucleation within the ferroelectric layer, directly
influencing device reliability and performance. From a structural perspective,
our findings demonstrate that the phase composition of annealed HfO$_2$ films
in MFIS stacks is primarily determined by the spatial arrangement of dopants.
From an electrical perspective, we observe significant enhancement of remanent
polarization and endurance of the gate stacks through heterogeneous co-doping,
depending on the spatial arrangement of dopants.

### Revisiting the adiabatic limit in ballistic multiterminal Josephson junctions

Motivated by recent experiments on multiterminal Josephson junctions (MJJs)
that probe different ranges of the size and bias voltage parameters, we
introduce a two-dimensional (2D) cross-over diagram to map the relationship
between device dimension (x-axis) and bias voltage (y-axis). This cross-over
diagram conveniently separates the different physical regimes of the devices.
This framework is used to explore the regime of increasing bias voltage in
large-scale devices near the x-axis, where the electrochemical potential
becomes comparable to the 1D energy level spacing. In a perfect waveguide
geometry, we find that the relative number of quantum-correlated pairs formed
by colliding Floquet-Kulik levels is equal to the inverse of the number of
transverse channels, due to the number of conserved quantities equal to the
number of channels. This observation motivates a model for the intermediate
regime in which the ballistic central two-dimensional normal metal is treated
as a continuum under the adiabatic approximation, while Andreev modes propagate
in a background of voltage- and flux-tunable nonequilibrium electronic
populations. The model predicts characteristic voltage scales that govern the
mesoscopic oscillations of the critical current, and these scales are at the
crossroads of interpreting experiments in all sectors of the MJJs: quartets,
topology, and Floquet theory.

The paper thoroughly analyses the significant cracking on the newly
refurbished masonry bridge pier in Lovosice. The cracks of width up to 15 mm
appeared shortly after the reconstruction of the bridge and were the subject of
a detailed assessment. First, a monitoring system was mounted to analyse the
behaviour during the year and the dependency on the temperature. Next, a dive
inspection was done in order to evaluate the conditions under the water. The
next step was to make a diagnostics survey, based on the drilling, endoscopic
tests and water pressure tests. Based on the results, several detailed
numerical models were created in order to analyse the pier behaviour and
conduct a parametric study to investigate various factors, leading to the
defects. The numerical models covered the complex geometry of the pier,
consisting of the inner poor concrete core and outer shell from sandstone
masonry blocks. The above-described procedure revealed the causes of the
defects and also recommended the proper strengthening of the pier.

The wettability of monolayer and multilayer graphene remains a topic of
longstanding debate. Here, we combined first-principles molecular dynamics
simulations accelerated with the atomic cluster expansion machine learning
interatomic potential to investigate how substrate, graphene layer number, and
intercalated water molecules influence graphene's wettability. Simulated
vibrational sum-frequency generation (vSFG) spectra revealed that the
experimentally observed hydrophilic behavior of monolayer graphene on
hydrophilic substrates arose not from wetting transparency, but from signal
cancellation induced by intercalated water. Energetic analyses further showed
that intercalated water molecules were thermodynamically favorable for
monolayer graphene on hydrophilic substrates, but not for multilayer systems,
leading to changes in the vSFG response in line with experimental observations.
These results offer a mechanistic understanding of graphene-water interactions
and have broad implications for the design of graphene-based interfaces and
devices.

### Ambient-Pressure Superconductivity from Boron Icosahedral Superatoms

We identify a new family of XB$_{12}$, boron-rich compounds formed by
interconnected B$_{12}$ icosahedra and electropositive guest atoms ($X$). These
structures emerged from first-principles crystal structure prediction at 50
GPa, as part of a pressure-quenching strategy to discover superconductors that
could be synthesized under pressure and retained at ambient conditions. The
resulting structures are thermodynamically competitive, dynamically stable at
zero pressure, and - when $X$ is a mono- or trivalent element - metallic and
superconducting. Predicted critical temperatures reach up to 42 K for
CsB$_{12}$, rivaling MgB$_2$, the highest-$T_c$ ambient-pressure conventional
superconductor.
  We interpret the XB$_{12}$ phase as a superatomic crystal: the B$_{12}$ units
retain their molecular identity while forming extended crystalline networks.
Their delocalized orbitals support doping without structural destabilization,
while their covalent bonding promotes strong electron-phonon coupling. Unlike
MgB$_2$, where superconductivity is driven by a narrow subset of phonon modes,
the XB$_{12}$ compounds exhibit broad, mode- and momentum-distributed coupling
through both intra- and inter-superatomic vibrations. Our results highlight the
XB$_{12}$ family as a promising platform for metastable superconductivity and
demonstrate the potential of superatoms as functional building blocks in
solid-state materials design.

### Neo-Gibbsian Statistical Energetics with Applications to Nonequilibrium Cells

Generalization through novel interpretations of the inner logic of the
century-old Gibbs' statistical thermodynamics is presented: i) Identifying
$k_B\to 0$ as classical energetics, one directly derives a pair of
thermodynamic variational formulae \[
  F(T) = \min_{E\ge E_{min}}\Big\{E-TS(E) \Big\}
  \,\text{ and }\
  S(E) = \min_{T&gt;0}\left\{\frac{E}{T}-\frac{F(T)}{T} \right\}, \] that dictate
all the more familiar $1/T=d S(E)/d E$, $E=d\{F(T)/T\}/d(1/T)$, and $S(E)=-d
F(T)/d T$ in equilibrium, which is maintained by a duality symmetry with
one-to-one relation between $T^{\text{eq}}(E)=\arg\min_T\{E/T-F(T)/T\}$ and
$E^{\text{eq}}(T)=\arg\min_E\{E-TS(E)\}$. ii) In contradistinction, taking
derivative of the statistical free energy w.r.t. $T$, a mesoscopic energetics
with fluctuations emerges: This yields two information entropy functions which
historically appeared 50 years postdate Gibbs' theory. iii) Combining the above
pair of inequalities yields an irreversible thermodynamic potential $\psi(T,E)
\equiv \{E-F(T)\}/T-S(E)\ge 0$ for nonequilibrium states. The second law of
thermodynamics as a universal principle reflects $\psi\ge 0$ due to a
disagreement between $E$ and $T$ as a dual pair. Our theory provides a new
energetics of living cells which are nonequilibrium, complex entities under
constant $T$, pressure $p$ and chemical potential $\mu$. $\psi$ provides a
``distance'' between statistical data from a large ensemble of cells and a set
of intrinsic energetic parameters that encode the information within.

We examine the $S=1/2$ Heisenberg magnet on four three-dimensional lattices
-- simple-cubic, diamond, pyrochlore, and hyperkagome ones -- for ferromagnetic
and antiferromagnetic signs of the exchange interaction in order to illustrate
the effect of lattice geometry on the finite-temperature thermodynamic
properties with a focus on the specific heat $c(T)$. To this end, we use
quantum Monte Carlo simulations or high-temperature expansion series
complemented with the entropy method. We also discuss a recent proposal about
hidden energy scale in geometrically frustrated magnets.

Scanning probe microscopy (SPM) investigations of on-surface chemistry on
passivated silicon have only shown in-plane chemical reactions, and studies on
bare silicon are limited in facilitating additional reactions
post-molecular-attachment. Here, we enable subsequent reactions on Si(100)
through selectively adsorbing 3D, silicon-specific "molecular tools". Following
an activation step, the molecules present an out-of-plane radical that can
function both to donate or accept molecular fragments, thereby enabling
applications across multiple scales, e.g., macroscale customizable
silicon-carbon coatings or nanoscale tip-mediated mechanosynthesis. Creation of
many such molecular tools is enabled by broad molecular design criteria that
facilitate reproducibility, surface specificity, and experimental
verifiability. These criteria are demonstrated using a model molecular tool
tetrakis(iodomethyl)germane ($Ge(CH_{2}I)_{4}$; TIMe-Ge), with experimental
validation by SPM and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and theoretical
support by density functional theory (DFT) investigations. With this framework,
a broad and diverse range of new molecular engineering capabilities are enabled
on silicon.

### Out-of-plane angle resolved second harmonic Hall analysis in perpendicular magnetic anisotropy systems

Second Harmonic Hall (SHH) measurement is a standard and well accepted
technique to estimate spin orbit torque (SOT) efficiencies in perpendicular
magnetic anisotropy (PMA) systems. Generally, field sweep and in-plane angle
sweep SHH measurements are performed and SOT efficiency calculation is done
using effective fields based formalism. In this article, we demonstrate an
alternate experimental approach of out-of-plane (OOP) angle resolved SHH
measurement in PMA systems for SOT efficiencies estimation. Also, we present an
alternate formalism for SOT efficiency extraction, derived by solving LLGS
equation in the low frequency limit of magnetic susceptibility. Along with SHH
measurements, we also experimentally demonstrate anomalous Hall effect (AHE)
based spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance (STFMR) for PMA systems.

### Global Forecasting of Tropical Cyclone Intensity Using Neural Weather Models

Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models that integrate coupled physical
equations forward in time are the traditional tools for simulating atmospheric
processes and forecasting weather. With recent advancements in deep learning,
Neural Weather Models (NeWMs) have emerged as competent medium-range NWP
emulators, with performances that compare favorably to state-of-the-art NWP
models. However, they are commonly trained on reanalyses with limited spatial
resolution (e.g., 0.25{\deg} horizontal grid spacing), which smooths out key
features of weather systems. For example, tropical cyclones (TCs)-among the
most impactful weather events due to their devastating effects on human
activities-are challenging to forecast, as extrema like wind gusts, used as
proxies for TC intensity, are smoothed in deterministic forecasts at 0.25{\deg}
resolution. To address this, we use our best observational estimates of wind
gusts and minimum sea level pressure to train a hierarchy of post-processing
models on NeWM outputs. Applied to Pangu-Weather and FourCastNet v2, the
post-processing models produce accurate and reliable forecasts of TC intensity
up to five days ahead. Our post-processing algorithm is tracking-independent,
preventing full misses, and we demonstrate that even linear models extract
predictive information from NeWM outputs beyond what is encoded in their
initial conditions. While spatial masking improves probabilistic forecast
consistency, we do not find clear advantages of convolutional architectures
over simple multilayer perceptrons for our NeWM post-processing purposes.
Overall, by combining the efficiency of NeWMs with a lightweight,
tracking-independent post-processing framework, our approach improves the
accessibility of global TC intensity forecasts, marking a step toward their
democratization.

### Nodal error behind discrepancies between coupled cluster and diffusion Monte Carlo: AcOH dimer case study

The small magnitude and long-range character of non-covalent interactions
pose a significant challenge for computational quantum chemical and
electronic-structure methods alike. State-of-the-art coupled cluster (CC)
theory and benchmark-grade diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) are ideally positioned
to tackle these problems, but concerning differences between both methods have
been reported in numerous studies of the interaction energy of non-covalently
bound dimers. Given that the basic theoretical frameworks underpinning both
methods are exact in principle, the error must arise from one or several of the
approximations required to make the calculations computationally tractable.
Here we carry out a rigorous and systematic case study of the effect of each of
these approximations using the acetic acid dimer as a convenient testing
ground. Thanks to the use of stringently optimized backflow wave functions we
are able to find that the $\sim 0.8$ kcal mol$^{-1}$ discrepancy is dominated
by a &gt;0.5 kcal mol-1 fixed-node error incurred by the Slater-Jastrow DMC
result, while errors in the CC calculations only account for up to ~0.2 kcal
mol-1. This finding, likely applicable to other non-covalent systems, helps
establish that CC should be regarded as the benchmark for these systems, and
can potentially guide the search for pragmatic solutions to the fixed-node
problem in the future.

### Mechanisms of superconductivity and inhomogeneous states in metallic hydrogen and electron systems with attraction

In the Review we discuss anomalous aspects of superconductivity (SC) and
normal state, as well as formation of inhomogeneous (droplet-like or
cluster-like) states in electron systems with attraction. We consider both the
models with the retardation (Eliashberg mechanism of SC for strong
electron-phonon interaction in metallic hydrogen) and without retardation (but
with local onsite attraction). We concentrate on the mechanism of the BCS-BEC
crossover for the Hubbard model with local attraction and diagonal disorder for
the two-dimensional films of the dirty metal. We analyze also the model of the
inhomogeneous spaceseparated Fermi-Bose mixture for the bismuth oxides BaKBiO,
which contains the paired clusters of bosonic states as well as unpaired
fermionic clusters. Superconductivity is realized in this system due to local
pairs tunneling from one bosonic cluster to the neighboring one via the
fermionic barrier. For metallic hydrogen and metallic hydrides, we calculate
the critical temperature and discuss important possibility for practical
applications how to increase the temperature by decreasing pressure in the
framework of the generalized Eliashberg approach. We advocate also interesting
analogies with the quantum (vortex) crystal for long-living low-dimensional
metastable phases of metallic hydrogen including filamentous phase with proton
chains embedded in 3D electron Fermi liquid and planar phase with proton
plains. We formulate the concept of two Bose-condensates in SC electron and
superfluid (SF) ion subsystems and provide the estimate for the lifetime of the
long-living metastable phases at normal pressure. The estimate is connected
with the formation and growth of the critical seeds of the new (molecular)
phase in the process of quantum under-barrier tunneling.

Lehmann representation for the finite temperature single-particle Green's
function in the repulsive Lieb-Liniger model. This allows us to determine the
spectral function in the full range of temperatures and interactions, as well
as in generalized Gibbs ensembles. We test our results against the known limit
of infinite interaction strength and find excellent agreement.

We introduce an analytic slave boson method for treating the finite $U$
Anderson impurity model. Our approach introduces two bosons to track both
$Q\rightleftharpoons Q\pm1$ valence fluctuations and reduces to a single
symmetric $s$-boson in the effective action, encoding all the high energy
atomic physics information in the boson's kinematics, while the low energy part
of the action remains unchanged across finite $U$, infinite $U$, and Kondo
limits. We recover the infinite $U$ and Kondo limit actions from our approach
and show that the Kondo resonance already develops in the normal state when the
slave boson has yet to condense. We show that the slave rotor and $s$-boson
have the same algebraic structure, and we establish a unified functional
integral framework connecting the $s$-boson and slave rotor representations for
the single impurity Anderson model.

### On the Relationship and Distinction Between Atomic Density and Coordination Number in Describing Grain Boundaries

- **TL;DR**: 本文提出原子密度场作为比传统配位数更全面的晶界缺陷描述符，能够同时捕捉键缺失和间距变化，统一结构和体积信息。

Crystal defects are often rationalized through broken-bond counting via the
nearest neighbor coordination number. In this work, we highlight that this
perspective overlooks intrinsic heterogeneities in interatomic spacing that
decisively shape defect properties. We analyze excess free volume, energy, and
entropy for a large set of BCC-Fe grain boundaries relaxed by molecular statics
and demonstrate that an atomic-density field, as a systematically
coarse-grained field variable, provides a more comprehensive descriptor. Unlike
coordination alone, the density field simultaneously captures bond depletion
and spacing variations, thereby unifying structural and volumetric information.
Our results establish density-based descriptors as principled surrogates for
grain-boundary thermodynamics and kinetics, offer a direct bridge from
atomistic data to mesoscale models, and motivate augmenting broken-bond rules
in predictive theories of interfacial energetics, excess properties,
segregation and phase behavior.

We study the quantum critical point between the fermionic $\nu=8$ quantum
Hall state and the bosonic $\nu=2$ quantum Hall state of Cooper pairs. Our
study is motivated by the composite fermion construction for the daughter
states of even-denominator fractional quantum Hall states and the
experimentally observed transition between the daughter and the Jain states at
the same filling. We show that this transition is equivalent to the transition
between a neutral invertible $E_8$ state and a topologically trivial state.
These transitions can be described in a partonic framework as a cascade of mass
changes of four neutral Dirac fermions coupled to multiple Abelian Chern-Simons
$U(1)$ gauge fields. In the absence of fine-tuning, the transition is split
into a series of four or more different transitions, with at least three
distinct intermediate topologically ordered phases hosting neutral anyons.

The Stochastic Backscatter Model involves the generation of a set of random
variables characterised by prescribed correlations in space and time. These
variables are obtained by smoothing an initially uncorrelated random field,
which produces an exponentially decaying spatial correlation. The smoothing is
applied implicitly and sequentially along the three coordinate directions of
the computational domain, making the approach suitable only for structured CFD
solvers. To extend the method to unstructured solvers, implicit Laplace
smoothing can be employed instead. However, the spatial correlation resulting
from this alternative approach must be derived analytically. This constitutes
the main objective of the present dissertation.

We study the electronic spin Zeeman effect for an effective spin-1/2-system
subject to both strong coupling to a low-frequency optical cavity and an
external static magnetic field. Specifically, we address the interplay between
the cavity magnetic field component in a cavity Zeeman interaction and the
canonical spin Zeeman interaction from the perspective of an effective
spin-polariton Hamiltonian. The latter is derived from the minimal coupling
Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian beyond the common dipole approximation via first-order
quasi-degenerate perturbation theory. We find the spin Zeeman effect to be
modified in the presence of the cavity field due to the formation of
spin-polariton states, which result from an intricate interplay of cavity and
external magnetic fields in our model. Spin-polariton signatures are discussed
in the context of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy along with
cavity-induced modifications of the electronic g-factor.

We report the development of a reactive sputtering process for high
$T_\mathrm{c}$ NbN films with high normal-state resistivity, tailored for
kinetic inductance parametric amplifiers. The process includes precise control
to ensure full nitridation of the target prior to deposition. Under optimized
conditions, the resulting NbN thin films exhibit a critical temperature of
$10.5\,\mathrm{K}$ and a resistivity of $\sim1000\,\mathrm{\mu\Omega\,cm}$. The
high $T_\mathrm{c}$ of the NbN thin-films suggests strong potential for
application over the entire millimetre-wave frequency range from
$24\,\mathrm{GHz}$ to $300\,\mathrm{GHz}$, whereas the high resistivity
suggests a reduced power requirement for the pump tone to achieve high gain.
Resonator parametric amplifiers have been fabricated from these films using
coplanar waveguide geometry. The devices were able to produce high gain
exceeding $20\,\mathrm{dB}$ at $25\,\mathrm{GHz}$, with artefact-free,
reproducible amplification profiles in good agreement with theoretical models.

- **TL;DR**: 通过Log-Lattices投影流体研究，证明可逆Navier-Stokes方程满足Gallavotti-Cohen港动定理，并在某些假设下扩展到不可逆NS方程

Using the recent concept of fluids projected onto Log-Lattices, we
investigate the validity of the Gallavotti-Cohen Fluctuation Theorem (GCFT) in
the context of fluid mechanics. The dynamics of viscous flows are inherently
irreversible, which violates a fundamental assumption of the fluctuation
theorem. To address this issue, Gallavotti introduced a new model, the
Reversible Navier-Stokes Equation (RNS), which recovers the time-reversal
symmetry of the Navier-Stokes (NS) equations while retaining the core
characteristics of the latter. We show that for fluids on Log-Lattices, the
GCFT holds for the RNS system. Furthermore, we show that this result can be
extended, under certain assumptions, to the traditional, irreversible
Navier-Stokes equations. Additionally, we show that the phase space contraction

We study an extended spin-$1/2$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the
triangular lattice, which includes both nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor
interactions, as well as a scalar chiral term. This model exhibits a rich phase
diagram featuring several competing phases: different quantum spin liquids and
various magnetically ordered states, including coplanar $120^\circ$ order,
stripe order, and non-coplanar tetrahedral order. We employ large-scale matrix
product state simulations optimized for GPUs to obtain high-resolution
dynamical responses. Our calculations reveal the spectral features across both
ordered and liquid regimes of the phase diagram, which we analyze in comparison
with analytical predictions and field-theoretical approaches. We identify
unique signatures of the ordered phases in the form of gapless Goldstone modes
at the ordering wave vectors. Our results in the $J_1-J_2$ quantum spin-liquid
regime are indicative of a $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid. In the chiral spin-liquid
phase, we find signatures of spinons as the fractional excitations of the
underlying theory, manifested as the onset of a two-spinon continuum that
agrees with predictions from the Kalmeyer-Laughlin ansatz for the ground-state
wave function, and collective modes that can be viewed as spinon bound states.
We discuss finite-size effects, their consistency with the presumptions from
field-theory, and review the dynamical structure factor with regard to
experimentally relevant features such as the occurrence of highly dispersive
signals and the global distribution of spectral weight.

Multicomponent Heusler alloys exhibit various magnetic properties arising
from their diverse atomic compositions and crystal structures. Identifying the
general physical principles that govern these behaviors is essential for
advancing their potential in spintronic applications. In this work, we combine
density functional theory with atomistic Monte Carlo simulations to investigate
the magnetic ground states, finite-temperature magnetic transitions, and
electronic structures of fully-ordered $L2_1$-, $XA$-type, and
partially-ordered V$_2X$Al ($X=$ Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) Heusler alloys. We
introduce the concept of magnetic genes, defined as V-$X$-V triangular motifs
connected by the nearest-neighbor (NN) exchange interactions
$J_{\mathrm{V-}X}$. Within this framework, the magnetic ground states and
transition temperatures across the V$_2X$Al family can be consistently
understood. The magnetic order is primarily governed by the NN
$J_{\mathrm{V-}X}$ interactions in the triangular genes, while the transition
temperatures are additionally influenced by $J_{X-X}$ couplings. Furthermore,
the magnetic genes are still proven to be effective in our calculations on
partially-ordered V$_2$$X$Al alloys from $L2_1$ to $XA$-type structures. Our
results suggest that the concept of magnetic genes provides a unifying
principle for understanding magnetic ordering in V-based Heusler alloys and
could serve as a powerful guide for exploring magnetism and designing advanced
spintronic materials in a broader class of Heusler systems.

The coherent spin dynamics of electrons are investigated for CsPbI$_3$
perovskite nanocrystals in a glass matrix using time-resolved Faraday
ellipticity. In nanocrystals with a diameter of about 11 nm, the Larmor
precession frequency has a linear dependence on magnetic field corresponding to
the electron Land\'e $g$-factor of 2.07. We find a finite Larmor precession
frequency at zero magnetic field, corresponding to the electron spin splitting
of $0.8$ $\mu$eV. This splitting is explained by the hyperfine interaction with
nuclear spin fluctuations. Our model analysis shows that the hyperfine
interaction for the conduction band electrons is contributed both by the
$p$-orbitals of the lead atoms and by the $s$-orbitals of the iodine atoms,
with the leading contribution to the hyperfine field fluctuations coming from
iodine. This fact agrees well with the 9% iodine contribution to the Bloch
amplitude of the conduction band, obtained by DFT calculations. From these
findings, the atomic hyperfine constant for the $5s$-orbital of iodine is
evaluated as 190 $\mu$eV.

The finite difference time domain method is one of the most popular methods
in computational electromagnetics. This work considers two possible ways of
generalising it to a meshless setting by employing local radial basis function
interpolation. The resulting methods turn out to be unstable, but can be
stabilised by adding properly chosen hyperviscosity terms to the update
equations. We demonstrate that the proposed meshless methods are convergent and
can enjoy a decreased dispersion anisotropy compared to the finite difference
time domain method.

Non-equilibrium molecular-scale dynamics, where fast electron transport
couples with slow chemical state evolution, underpins the complex behaviors of
molecular memristors, yet a general model linking these dynamics to
neuromorphic computing remains elusive. We introduce a dynamic memristor model
that integrates Landauer and Marcus electron transport theories with the
kinetics of slow processes, such as proton/ion migration or conformational
changes. This framework reproduces experimental conductance hysteresis and
emulates synaptic functions like short-term plasticity (STP) and
spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). By incorporating the model into a
reservoir computing (RC) architecture, we show that computational performance
optimizes when input frequency and bias mapping range align with the molecular
system's intrinsic kinetics. This chemistry-centric, bottom-up approach
provides a theoretical foundation for molecular-scale neuromorphic computing,
demonstrating how non-equilibrium molecular-scale dynamics can drive
information processing in the post-Moore era.

The determination of the critical current density from magnetic hysteresis
loops is widely used to characterize and compare superconducting samples.
Magnetic hysteresis loops for tapes and single crystals depend on both the
critical current density and sample size. The latter sets the scale of
supercurrent circulation. However, in polycrystalline high-temperature
superconductors prepared by solid-phase synthesis or by sol-gel method, the
magnetization is determined by the circulation of supercurrents in individual
grains. The paper discusses the effect of the grain size distribution on the
effective scale of current circulation. Log-normal and Weibull distributions
are both considered as possible for grain sizes. The effective size for
calculating the intragrain current density has been shown to be significantly
larger than the average grain size.

We introduce jerky chiral active Brownian particles (jcABPs), a
generalization of conventional chiral active Brownian particles (cABPs)
subjected to jerk, the time derivative of acceleration, and analytically derive
their mean displacement and mean squared displacement (MSD). Our results show
that jerk induces anomalous fluctuations and oscillatory behavior on the
standard circular swimming of chiral active particles. The interplay of jerk,
chirality and persistence produces a family of mean trajectories including
damped and exploding Lissajous patterns alongside the well-known spira
mirabilis (logarithmic spirals). Our work on jerky chiral active particles
opens a new route to explore rich dynamical effects in active matter.

Kagome materials have attracted extensive attention due to their correlated
properties. The breathing kagome material system Nb3X8 (X = F, Cl, Br, I) is
regarded as a Mott insulator. However, studies on the influence of interlayer
coupling on its magnetic and Mott properties are lacking. In this work, we
investigated the effect of interlayer coupling on bilayer properties of each
Nb3X8 (X = F, Cl, Br, I) compound via density functional theory (DFT)
calculations, considering 24 stacking configurations per material. We found
that each bilayer material is a Mott insulator. Due to the competition between
interlayer Pauli repulsion and hopping, most interlayer magnetism is AFM, a
small number of cases show AFM-FM degeneracy, and the magnetic ground state of
3 configurations is interlayer FM, i.e., tunable interlayer magnetism occurs.
This robustness of Mott states coexisting with tunable interlayer magnetism
provide novel and comprehensive analysis and insights for the research of
breathing kagome Mott insulators.

Charge density wave (CDW), a symmetry-breaking collective phenomenon in
condensed matter systems, exhibits periodic modulations of electron density
coupled with lattice distortions, where the lattice plays a critical role via
electron-phonon coupling. In transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs)
1T-TaS2/TaSe2, experiments reveal rich temperature- and pressure-dependent CDW
phase behaviors, along with metastable CDW states induced by ultrafast optical
excitation. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms governing
thermal/pressure-driven transitions and particularly the microscopic evolution
of CDW phases remain incompletely understood. Here, we perform first-principles
anharmonic phonon calculations and machine-learning force-field molecular
dynamics at finite temperatures/pressures to investigate the CDW transitions in
1T-TaS2/TaSe2. The calculated CDW transition temperature TCDW and critical
pressure Pc are in quantitative agreement with experimental values. Our results
demonstrate that the melting of CDW originates from phonon anharmonicity, with
ionic fluctuations dominating the transition dynamics. We observe the
microscopic evolution of CDW under varying temperature/pressure, revealing an
ultrafast nucleation process of CDW (~3 ps). Our results emphasize the
essential role of phonon anharmonicity in elucidating CDW transition mechanisms
underlying, and advance fundamental understanding of CDW-related phenomena in
TMDs.

Scattering analysis offers a fundamental route to revealing particle
interactions with direct implications for device technologies relying on
ensembles of particles such as magnetic skyrmions. Here, we directly visualize,
in real time, the nanosecond current-driven dynamics of an antiferromagnetic
(AFM) skyrmion lattice using element-specific pump-probe X-ray microscopy. By
tuning spin-orbit torque relative to local pinning potentials, we reveal two
regimes: incoherent flow, where mobile skyrmions scatter from pinned ones,
inducing recoil dynamics with 3-20 ns relaxation, and coherent flow, where the
lattice translates uniformly. Quantification of the reproducible post-pulse
relaxation trajectories via an inverse analyis method based on the Thiele
equation yields the nanoscale AFM skyrmion-skyrmion scattering potential, which
decays exponentially with a range of 30 nm, in full agreement with
micromagnetic simulations. At higher current densities, the lattice exhibits
coherent motion free from detectable Hall and inertial effects or dynamical
deformation, enabling robust GHz operation. These findings establish a
quantitative framework for AFM skyrmion interactions and demonstrate
deterministic control of their collective dynamics over billions of cycles even
in the incoherent flow regime, thereby paving the way for multi-skyrmion
spintronic devices.

- **TL;DR**: Ba5Ru3O12三聚体钌酸盐系统在60K发生反铁磁有序，存在自旋挫败和非共线自旋结构，磁激发在高温下仍存在短程关联，muSR显示动态磁有序特性

We report a detailed inelastic neutron scattering (INS) and muon spin
relaxation (muSR) investigation of a trimer Ruthenate Ba5Ru3O12 system, which
undergoes long-range antiferromagnetic ordering at TN = 60 K. The INS reveals
two distinct spin wave excitations below TN: one at 5.6 meV and the other at
10-15 meV. By accompanying the INS spectra based on a linear spin wave theory
using SpinW software and machine learning force fields (MLFFs), we show that
Ba5Ru3O12 exhibits spin frustration due to competing exchange interactions
between neighboring and next-neighboring Ru-moments, exchange anisotropy, and
strong spin-orbit coupling, which yields a non-collinear spin structure, in
contrast to other ruthenate trimers in this series. Interestingly, these
magnetic excitations do not completely vanish even at high temperatures above
TN, evidencing short-range magnetic correlations in this trimer system. This is
further supported by muSR spectroscopy, which exhibits a gradual drop in the
initial asymmetry around the magnetic phase transition and is further verified
through maximum entropy analysis. The results of muSR spectroscopy indicate a
dynamic nature of magnetic order, attributed to local magnetic anisotropy
within the trimer as a result of local structural distortion and different
hybridization, consistent with canted spin-structure. We predict the ground
state of Ru3O12-isolated trimer through theoretical calculations, which agree
with the experimentally observed spin excitation

- **TL;DR**: 本研究通过扫描隧道光谱定量描述了4Hb-TaS2异质结构中填充控制的Mott态及其与超导性的相互作用，揭示了Mott物理机制和Brinkman-Rice方案预测的能谱演化过程。

Mott physics is at the root of a plethora of many-body quantum phenomena in
quantum materials. Recently, the stacked or twisted structures of van der Waals
(vdW) materials have emerged as a unique platform for realizing exotic
correlated states in the vicinity of the Mott transition. However, the
definitive feature of Mottness and how it rules the low-energy electronic state
remain elusive and experimentally inaccessible in many interesting regimes.
Here, we quantitatively describe a filling-controlled Mott state and its
interplay with superconductivity by scanning tunnelling spectroscopy in a vdW
bulk heterostructure, 4Hb-TaS$_2$, that interleaves strongly correlated
1T-TaS$_2$ layers with superconducting 1H-Ta$_2$ layers. The fine tunability of
electron doping induced by interlayer charge transfer allows us to continuously
track the spectral function with unsurpassed energy resolution from a depleted
narrow band (0.2 electrons per site) toward a Mott transition at half filling.
The gradually emerging Mott-Hubbard bands, followed by the sharpening and
vanishing of the central quasiparticle peak as predicted in the Brinkman-Rice
scenario, unambiguously demonstrate the Mott physics at play. Importantly, the
renormalization of the low-energy electrons acts destructively on the
superconducting pairing potential, leaving behind nonsuperconducting,
paramagnetic puddles at the nanoscale. Our results reveal a seminal system near
the border of the Mott criterion that enables us to illustrate the predictive
power of the Hubbard model, and set such heterostructures as promising ground
for realizing new correlated states in the heavily doped Mott regime.

Recent work has highlighted that the strong correlation inherent in spin
Hamiltonians can be effectively reduced by mapping spins to fermions via the
Jordan-Wigner transformation (JW). The Hartree-Fock method is straightforward
in the fermionic domain and may provide a reasonable approximation to the
ground state. Correlation with respect to the fermionic mean-field can be
recovered based on Lie-algebraic similarity transformation (LAST) with two-body
correlators. Specifically, a unitary LAST variant eliminates the dependence on
site ordering, while a non-unitary LAST yields size-extensive correlation
energies. Whereas the first recent demonstration of such methods was restricted
to small spin systems, we present efficient implementations using analytical
gradients for the optimization with respect to the mean-field reference and the
LAST parameters, thereby enabling the treatment of larger clusters, including
systems with local spins s &gt; 1/2.

### Segregation-driven cross-slip mechanism of shockley partials in the gamma prime phase of CoNi-based superalloys

In general, the cross-slip of superdislocations (a/2&lt;011&gt;) from {111} planes
to {001} planes has been frequently observed in superalloys, accompanied by the
formation of an antiphase boundary (APB) and driven by thermal activation.
However, no prior studies have evidenced the occurrence of Shockley partial
dislocation (a/6&lt;112&gt;) cross-slip within the gamma prime phase of superalloys.
In this work, we present a newly observed cross-slip phenomenon: the Shockley
partial dislocations cross-slip from one {111} plane to another {111} conjugate
plane, facilitated by the formation of a stair-rod dislocation in the ordered
gamma prime phase of a CoNi-based superalloy. Compression tests were conducted
at 850 degrees Celsius with a strain rate of 10^-4 s^-1. Defects such as
stacking faults and dislocations, along with the associated chemical
fluctuations, were characterized using high-resolution scanning transmission
electron microscopy (HRSTEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS).
Elemental segregation was found to reduce the activation energy required for
cross-slip by decreasing the energies of stacking faults and dislocations. In
addition to elemental segregation, local stress concentrations, arising from
the combined effects of applied stress, shearing dislocations within the gamma
prime phase, and dislocation pile-ups, also play a critical role in triggering
cross-slip. The formation of sessile stair-rod dislocations via this newly
identified Shockley partial cross-slip in the gamma prime phase is beneficial
for enhancing the high-temperature deformation resistance of the alloy by
increasing the critical resolved shear stress required for further plastic
deformation.

The Casimir method for determining the dispersive force by varying zero
vacuum energy fluctuations is applied to two graphene sheets in the
approximation of the Drude model for surface conductivity. As an alternative,
the Van Kampen summation method is used. The force is determined for small and
for large distances between the sheets. The results of both models are quite
similar. Precisely, at large distances, the attractive force decreases
inversely proportional to the fourth power of the distance. At short distances,
the force is a finite attractive one. With a small chemical potential, the
force can have a minimum at distances of the order of 0.3 nm, then increases,
reaches a maximum at distances of the order of 200 nm, and at large distances
decreases inversely proportional to the fourth power of the distance. At a
chemical potential of significantly more than 1 eV, a minimum is not observed.

### Cooperative Suppression Strategy for Dual Thermal Transport Channels in Crystalline Materials

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种通过"重轻软硬"结构设计实现晶体材料超低热导率的新方法，同时抑制粒子性和波动性声子传输通道

We propose a novel design principle for achieving ultralow thermal
conductivity in crystalline materials via a "heavy-light and soft-stiff"
structural motif. By combining heavy and light atomic species with soft and
stiff bonding networks, both particle-like ($\kappa_p$) and wave-like
($\kappa_c$) phonon transport channels are concurrently suppressed.
First-principles calculations show that this architecture induces a
hierarchical phonon spectrum: soft-bonded heavy atoms generate dense
low-frequency modes that enhance scattering and reduce $\kappa_p$, while
stiff-bonded light atoms produce sparse high-frequency optical branches that
disrupt coherence and lower $\kappa_c$. High-throughput screening identifies
Tl$_4$SiS$_4$ ($\kappa_p$ = 0.10, $\kappa_c$ = 0.06 W/mK) and Tl$_4$GeS$_4$
($\kappa_p$ = 0.09, $\kappa_c$ = 0.06 W/mK) as representative candidates with
strongly suppressed transport in both channels. A minimal 1D triatomic chain
model further demonstrates the generality of this mechanism, offering a new
paradigm for phonon engineering beyond the conventional $\kappa_p$-$\kappa_c$
trade-off.

using a cubic-anvil high-pressure (CA-HP) apparatus through both ex-situ and
in-situ processes, applying pressures of up to 4 GPa and heating temperatures
of up to 1600{\deg}C. A comprehensive characterization has been performed,
including structural, microstructural, transport, and magnetic measurements.
Our findings indicate that a modest growth pressure of approximately 0.5 GPa is
sufficient for the formation of the Sm1111 phase in the ex-situ process. In
contrast, the in-situ process requires higher synthesis pressure (4 GPa) and
temperature (1400 {\deg}C for 1 hour) to achieve the Sm1111 phase with enhanced
superconducting properties. Notably, the optimized in-situ process
significantly reduces the reaction time needed for the formation of the Sm1111
phase compared to conventional synthesis process at ambient pressure (CSP),
leading to an increase in the transition temperature by 3 K and improvements in
critical current density (Jc). Conversely, the optimized ex-situ process
results in an onset transition temperature (Tc) of approximately 53 K, similar
to that of CSP, though it enhances the Jc by an order of magnitude. Despite
these advancements, a small amount of impurity phases, as observed during CSP,
persists in all Sm1111 samples prepared through either the in-situ or ex-situ
CA-HP processes. These results suggest that the in-situ process under optimized
conditions (1400 {\deg}C, 4 GPa for 1 hour) can effectively improve the
superconducting properties of Sm1111. Additionally, a comprehensive analysis
comparing these results with high gas pressure techniques, spark plasma
sintering, and CSP methods suggests that a small amount of impurity phases in
Sm1111 is persistent and cannot be completely eliminated by various pressure
techniques, even at the applied pressure of up to 4 GPa.

Recently discovered high-$T_c$ superconductivity in thin-film bilayer
nickelates La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under ambient pressure has attracted great
interest. Non-Fermi-liquid transport behaviors, such as $T$-linear resistivity
and positive Hall coefficient increasing at low temperatures, have been
reported in this system. In this study, we analyze the non-Fermi-liquid
transport phenomena in the thin-film bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using
a multiorbital tight-binding model. In La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, the orbital-selective
cold spots composed of Ni $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital emerge since the spin
fluctuations cause stronger quasi-particle damping $\gamma$ in the Ni $d_{z^2}$
orbital. Notably, in the present study, we derive a rigorous formula for the
Hall coefficient $R_H$ incorporating the $\gamma$ in the quasi-quantum metric
(qQM) term. We discover that the $T$-dependence of $\gamma$ in the qQM term is
important in determining $R_H$, and that the qQM term is inevitably enhanced by
the nearly degenerate bands at the orbital-selective cold spots located around
$(\pi/4,\pi/4)$. Moreover, the qQM term plays an essential role in describing
the Nernst coefficient and other transport phenomena involving the second
derivative velocity $v^{\mu\nu}$. La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ provides a novel platform
for exploring the physics of the qQM.

A fundamental objective of materials modeling is identifying atomic
structures that align with experimental observables. Conventional approaches
for disordered materials involve sampling from thermodynamic ensembles and
hoping for an experimental match. This process is inefficient and offers no
guarantee of success. We present a method based on modified molecular dynamics,
that we call molecular augmented dynamics (MAD), which identifies structures
that simultaneously match multiple experimental observables and exhibit low
energies as described by a machine learning interatomic potential (MLP) trained
from ab-initio data. We demonstrate its feasibility by finding representative
structures of glassy carbon, nanoporous carbon, ta-C, a-C:D and a-CO$_x$ that
match their respective experimental observables -- X-ray diffraction, neutron
diffraction, pair distribution function and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
data -- using the same initial structure and underlying MLP. The method is
general, accepting any experimental observable whose simulated counterpart can
be cast as a function of differentiable atomic descriptors. This method enables
a computational "microscope" into experimental structures.

Van der Waals heterostructures offer a versatile platform for tailoring
electrical, magnetic, optical, and spin transport properties of materials
through proximity effects. Notably, hexagonal transition metal dichalcogenides
have been shown to induce valley-Zeeman spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in graphene,
resulting in significant spin lifetime anisotropy between in-plane and
out-of-plane spin orientations. However, in-plane lifetimes remain isotropic
due to the inherent threefold symmetry of the heterostructure. Here, we
demonstrate that pentagonal PdSe$_2$, characterised by unique in-plane
anisotropy, induces an unprecedented gate-tunable SOC in graphene. Our
measurements reveal a remarkable 10-fold modulation of the spin lifetime for
spins oriented within the graphene plane at room temperature. Moreover, the
directional dependence of the spin lifetimes, along the three spatial
directions, suggests the existence of a persistent in-plane spin texture
component that dominates the spin dynamics. These findings deepen our
understanding of spin dynamics in van der Waals heterostructures and open
avenues for designing and engineering novel topological phases in
graphene-based heterostructures within the strong SOC regime.

### Anomalous narrow-band correlation in a natural superconducting heterostructure

A new frontier in condensed matter physics is to stack atomically thin
layered-materials with different properties and create intriguing phenomena
which do not exist in any of the constituent layers. Transition metal
dichalcogenide 4Hb-TaS$_2$, with an alternating stacking of a spin liquid
candidate 1T-TaS$_2$ and a superconductor 1H-TaS$_2$, is a natural
heterostructure for such a purpose. Recently, rare phenomena are indeed
observed, including chiral superconductivity, two-component nematic
superconductivity, topological surface superconductivity and enigmatic magnetic
memory. A widely proposed starting point to understand such a mysterious
heterostructure requires strong electronic correlation, presumably provided by
1T-TaS$_2$ layers with a narrow flat band near the Fermi level ($E_F$). Here,
by using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we reveal the theoretically
expected flat band near $E_F$ in the energy-momentum space for the first time.
However, this flat band only exists on the 1T-TaS$_2$ terminated surface layer
with broken translational symmetry, but not on the 1T-TaS$_2$ layers buried in
the bulk. These results directly challenge the foundation of the current
theoretical paradigm. On the 1T-TaS$_2$ terminated surface layer, we further
reveal a pseudogap and an anomalous doping effect. These phenomena and the
dichotomy between surface and bulk layers also shed new light on the unusual
coexistence of distinct electronic orders in this mysterious heterostructure.

We present an end-to-end, symmetry-aware pipeline that converts interacting
fermionic and quantum-spin models into annealer-ready QUBOs while preserving
low-energy physics. The workflow combines Bravyi-Kitaev encoding, exact Z2
symmetry tapering, Xia-Bian-Kais (XBK) diagonalization to a Z-only form, and
k-local to 2-local quadratization, with ground energies recovered via a
Dinkelbach fixed-point over the resulting Ising objective. We validate the
approach across a complexity ladder: (i) a frustrated 2D Ising model run on a
D-Wave Advantage QPU reproduces the known ferromagnet-stripe transition; (ii)
finite-temperature checks on 1D Ising recover standard finite-size trends;
(iii) a genuinely quantum spin target (XXZ) matches exact diagonalization (ED)
on small chains; and (iv) interacting fermions (t-V) in 1D (rings L=2-8) show
ED-level energies and the expected kink near V/t ~ 2, with a 2D 2x2 cluster
tracking ED slopes up to a uniform offset. A replication-factor study
quantifies the accuracy-overhead trade-off, with order-of-magnitude error
reduction and diminishing returns beyond r ~ Nq. Except for the classical Ising
benchmark and molecular benchmarks, experiments use D-Wave's public DIMOD and
Neal simulators; a molecular benzene case in the appendix illustrates
portability beyond lattices. The results establish a practical pathway for
mapping quantum matter to current annealers, with clear knobs for fidelity,
resources, and embedding.

### Tunable Valley Polarization and Anomalous Hall Effect in Ferrovalley NbX2 and TaX2 (X = S, Se, Te): A First-Principles Study

- **TL;DR**: Error

Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides lack inversion symmetry and
have broken time-reversal symmetry due to the honeycomb structure and intrinsic
ferromagnetism, which leads to their valley polarization. Here, we explored the
electronic and magnetic properties of the novel ferrovalley materials 1H-NbS2,
1H-NbSe2, 1H-NbTe2, 1H-TaS2, 1H-TaSe2, and 1H-TaTe2 using first-principles
calculations based on density functional theory. The materials are dynamically
stable bipolar magnetic semiconductors. Among the magnetic semiconductors,
NbSe2 showed the maximum Curie temperature of 176.25 K. For these materials,
the ferromagnetic state was more favorable than the antiferromagnetic state,
indicating robust ferrovalley characteristics. These ferrovalley materials
showed a giant tunable valley polarization at K and K' points in the Brillouin
zone without applying any external factors due to intrinsic exchange
interactions of transition metal d-orbital electrons and spin-orbit coupling.
TaTe2 exhibited an outstanding valley splitting of 541 meV. Reversing Bloch
electrons' magnetic moment caused an alteration of valley polarization.
Additionally, the application of uniaxial and biaxial strain led to the
manipulation and variation of the bandgap and valley polarization. Berry
curvature exhibited opposite signs and unequal magnitudes at K and K' points,
which led to the anomalous valley Hall effect in these materials. NbS2, NbSe2,
and NbTe2 exhibited Berry curvature at unstrained crystals, whereas Berry
curvature appeared only in TaSe2 and TaTe2 with the application of strain.
These ferrovalley materials exhibited distinct band gaps for spin-up and
spin-down electrons, enabling the selective transport of spin-polarized
electrons.

One of the central tenets of the theory of the fractional quantum Hall effect
is that the bulk quantized Hall response requires the existence of a gapless
chiral edge mode. The field theoretical arguments for this rely on locality.
While locality is typically met in standard experimental settings, it need not
always apply. Motivated by experimental capabilities of photonic platforms, we
study confining potentials that are step-like in angular momentum, and thus
non-local in position. We show that this non-local potential does not host
conventional chiral edge modes. These are replaced by gapless spin-2 edge
states, which we show are connected to the collective 'graviton' excitations
that are gapped in the bulk. Furthermore, we show that FQH states host gapless
(charged) quasiparticles on their edges, even in the absence of conventional
edge modes. The edge state energies vanish as a power-law in system size, with
an exponent that characterises the bulk topological order.

Using molecular orbital theory, we introduce magnetism in pure-carbon,
charge-neutral fullerene monolayers which are otherwise non-magnetic. By
controlling either molecular or lattice symmetry, we can realise
highly-tuneable magnetic fullerene monolayers. We demonstrate a general design
principle based on group theory analysis and explain the origin of magnetism
using two representative systems with $S_4$ and $C_3$ molecular symmetries.
Moreover, for building blocks that lack appropriate molecular symmetry, we can
enforce crystalline symmetry to induce magnetism as well. Finally, we discuss
the experimental feasibility of realising our proposed magnetic fullerene
monolayers by examining a previously synthesised C$_{60}$ system. Our work
opens a new direction in introducing magnetism in non-magnetic building blocks
by enforcing either molecular or lattice symmetry.

The discovery of ambient-pressure nickelate high-temperature
superconductivity provides a new platform for probing the underlying
superconducting mechanisms. However, the thermodynamic metastability of
Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates Lnn+1NinO3n+1 (Ln = lanthanide) presents
significant challenges in achieving precise control over their structure and
oxygen stoichiometry. This study establishes a systematic approach for growing
phase-pure, high-quality Ln3Ni2O7 thin films on LaAlO3 and SrLaAlO4 substrates
using gigantic-oxidative atomic-layer-by-layer epitaxy. The films grown under
an ultrastrong oxidizing ozone atmosphere are superconducting without further
post annealing. Specifically, the optimal Ln3Ni2O7/SrLaAlO4 superconducting
film exhibits an onset transition temperature (Tc,onset) of 50 K. Four critical
factors governing the crystalline quality and superconducting properties of
Ln3Ni2O7 films are identified: 1) precise cation stoichiometric control
suppresses secondary phase formation; 2) complete atomic layer-by-layer
coverage coupled with 3) optimized interface reconstruction minimizes stacking
faults; 4) accurate oxygen content regulation is essential for achieving a
single superconducting transition and high Tc,onset. These findings provide
valuable insights for the layer-by-layer epitaxy growth of diverse oxide
high-temperature superconducting films.

inelastic neutron scattering results on the compound
$\text{Cs}_\text{2}\text{CoBr}_\text{4}$ with numerically exact simulations

bound states of spinon excitations can arise in XYZ beyond the requirement of
strong Ising anisotropies. We analyze the role of the frustrated triangular
couplings on the excitations giving rise to the spin dynamical structure factor
and show how the features of the bound states manifest themselves in the
different polarization channels.

We address the problem of interacting electrons in an external potential by
introducing the occupied spectral density $\rho(\mathbf{r},\omega)$ as
fundamental variable. First, we formulate the problem using an embedding
framework, and prove a one-to-one correspondence between a
$\rho(\mathbf{r},\omega)$ and the local dynamical external potential
$v_{\text{ext}}(\mathbf{r},\omega)$ that embeds the interacting electrons into
an open quantum system. Then, we use the Klein functional to ($i$) define a
universal functional of $\rho(\mathbf{r},\omega)$, ($ii$) introduce a
variational principle for the total energy as a functional of
$\rho(\mathbf{r},\omega)$, and ($iii$) formulate a non-interacting mapping of
spectral self-consistent equations suitable for numerical applications. At
variance with time-dependent density-functional theory, this formulation aims
at studying charged excitations and electronic spectra -- including electronic
correlations -- with a functional theory; An explicit and formally correct
description of all electronic levels could also lead to more accurate
approximations for the total energy.

We study the degree of band flatness and the anisotropic quantum geometry in
magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene by varying the twist angle and the
parameters of lattice relaxation using optical conductivity. We show that the
degree of band flatness and its quantum geometry can be revealed through
optical absorption and its resulting optical bounds, which are based on the
trace condition in quantum geometry. More specifically, the narrow and isolated
peak of optical absorption in the low-energy region provides information about
the bandwidth of the two flat bands. When this value is smaller than the
electron interaction, it serves as a critical condition for the emergence of
flat band superconductivity. Furthermore, optical absorption also provides the
gap value between the flat band and the dispersive band, and when this gap is
larger than the electron interaction, it facilitates the realization of
fractional Chern insulating phases. We show that the narrow and isolated peak
of optical bound near zero energy decreases as lattice relaxation increases.
Meanwhile, we demonstrate that the imaginary part of (generalized) optical Hall
conductivity reveals the vanishing of the negative part of Berry curvature,
which is enforced by the refined trace-determinant inequality. Accordingly, we
show that the total amount of the negative part and component of the Berry
curvature approaches zero in the single ideal flat-band case. In contrast, when
considering all occupied bands, the total amount of the negative component is
slightly different from zero. Lastly, we demonstrate that the vanishing of flat
band velocity and the emergent chiral symmetry are sufficient conditions for
the saturation of the trace condition, which pertains to the isotropic case. In
contrast, the determinant condition can only be saturated in anisotropic
systems.

Large lossless currents in high-temperature superconductors (HTS) critically
rely on dense defects with suitable size and dimensionality to pin vortices,
with dislocations being particularly effective due to their one-dimensional
geometry to interact extensively with vortex lines. However, in non-metallic
compounds such as HTS with rigid lattices, conventional deformation methods
typically lead to catastrophic fracture rather than dislocation-mediated
plasticity, making it a persistent challenge to introduce dislocations at high
density. Here, we propose an asymmetric stress field strategy using extrusion
to directly nucleate a high-density of dislocations in HTS by activating
shear-driven lattice slip and twisting under superimposed hydrostatic
compression. As demonstrated in iron-based superconductors (IBS), atomic
displacements of nearly one angstrom trigger the formation of tilted
dislocation lines with a density approaching that of metals. With further
structural refinement, these dislocations serve as strong pinning centers that
lead to a fivefold enhancement in the current-carrying capacity of IBS at 33 T,
along with low anisotropy and a large irreversibility field. This work not only
establishes a scalable route to engineer pinning landscapes in HTS, but also
offers a generalizable framework for manipulating dislocation structures in
rigid crystalline systems.

The interplay of nanoscale electronic domains underpins many emergent
phenomena of quantum materials, including the competition between charge
density waves (CDW) and superconductivity in high-Tc cuprates, or the storage
of information in phase-change memory devices. Coupling to electronic domains
provides an observable for pinpointing key interactions, e.g. affecting phase
transitions. While the equilibrium phase diagram of 1T-TaS2 - characterized by
unique transport properties and varying degrees of CDW commensurability - has
been studied extensively, an understanding of how the electronic domains in the
bulk behave across phase boundaries is lacking. We reveal the three-dimensional
evolution of electronic domains in 1T-TaS2 using temperature-dependent X-ray
diffraction and reciprocal space mapping, complemented by structure factor
simulations based on the Hendricks-Teller method. With this methodology, we
identify an increasing number of stacking faults near the phase transitions,
and a growing fraction of dimerized layers in the commensurate phase upon
cooling. We provide structural evidence that the CDW domains mediate the
transport properties at phase boundaries, and that they also account for an
anomalous intermediate electronic phase within the triclinic regime upon
heating. As a paradigmatic material with potential in phase-change memory
applications, our study underscores the importance of domain sizes and layer
stacking in defining electronic behaviors of van der Waals materials.

Achieving robust room-temperature ferromagnetism in purely organic 2D
crystals remains a fundamental challenge, primarily due to antiferromagnetic
(AFM) coupling mediated by {\pi}-electron superexchange. Here, we present a
mix-topology design strategy to induce strong ferromagnetic (FM) coupling in
metal-free 2D systems. By covalently connecting radical polyaromatic
hydrocarbon monomers (also referred to as nanographenes) with distinct
sublattice topologies, this approach rationally breaks inversion symmetry and
enables selective alignment of majority spins across the extended network,
giving rise to metal-free ferromagnetism. Based on this strategy, we designed a
family of 32 organic 2D crystals featuring spin-1/2 and mixed spin-1/2-spin-1
honeycomb lattices. Systematic first-principles calculations reveal that these
materials are robust FM semiconductors with tunable spin-dependent bandgaps
ranging from 0.9 to 3.8 eV. Notably, we demonstrate record-high magnetic
coupling of up to 127 meV, spin-splitting energies exceeding 2 eV, and Curie
temperatures surpassing 550 K, indicating thermal stability well above room
temperature. The microscopic origin of the strong FM exchange stems from
enhanced spin-orbital overlap and dominant direct exchange, while AFM
superexchange is effectively suppressed. Our findings establish a generalizable
design principle for realizing robust metal-free FM semiconductors and open new
avenues for developing flexible and biocompatible magnets for next-generation
spintronic and quantum technologies.

The study of quantum Hall effect (QHE) is a foundation of topological
physics, inspiring extensive explo- rations of its high-dimensional
generalizations. Notably, the four-dimensional (4D) QHE has been experi-
mentally realized in synthetic quantum systems, including cold atoms, photonic
lattices, and metamaterials. However, the many-body effect in the 4D QHE system
remains poorly understood. In this study, we explore this problem by
formulating the microscopic wavefunctions inspired by Laughlin's seminal work.
Employing a generalized pseudo-potential framework, we derive an exact
microscopic Hamiltonian consisting of two-body projectors that annihilate the
microscopic wavefunctions. Diagonalizations on a small size system show that
the quasi-hole states remain zero energy while the quasi-particle states
exhibit a finite gap, in consistency with an incompressible state. Furthermore,
the pairing distribution is calculated to substantiate the liquid-like nature
of the wavefunction. Our work provides a preliminary understanding to the
fractional topological states in high dimension.

- **TL;DR**: 本文通过考虑电子-声子耦合效应，解决了β-Bi₄I₄拓扑相变的理论预测与实验观测之间的差异，发现热声子驱动材料从强拓扑绝缘体转变为弱拓扑绝缘体

Quasi-one-dimensional bismuth halides offer an exceptional platform for
exploring diverse topological phases, yet the nature of the room-temperature
topological phase transition in Bi$_4$I$_4$ remains unresolved. While theory
predicts the high-temperature $\beta$-phase to be a strong topological
insulator (TI), experiments observe a weak TI. Here we resolve this discrepancy
by revealing the critical but previously overlooked role of electron-phonon
coupling in driving the topological phase transition. Using our newly developed
ab initio framework for phonon-induced band renormalization, we show that
thermal phonons alone drive $\beta$-Bi$_4$I$_4$ from the strong TI predicted by
static-lattice calculations to a weak TI above ~180 K. At temperatures where
$\beta$-Bi$_4$I$_4$ is stable, it is a weak TI with calculated surface states
closely match experimental results, thereby reconciling theory with experiment.
Our work establishes electron-phonon renormalization as essential for
determining topological phases and provides a broadly applicable approach for
predicting topological materials at finite temperatures.

### Self-consistent dynamical Hubbard functional for correlated solids

- **TL;DR**: 本文提出了一个完全自洽的动态泛函方法，用于处理强关联固体的电子结构，能够同时准确预测光谱和热力学性质。

Many-body functionals of the Green's function can provide fundamental
advances in electronic-structure calculations, due to their ability to
accurately predict both spectral and thermodynamic properties, such as
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) experiments and total
energies of materials. However, fully first-principles, self-consistent
calculations with these dynamical functionals remain a major challenge,
ultimately limiting their application to thermodynamic quantities, and
restricting spectral predictions to one-shot calculations. In this paper, we
present a fully self-consistent treatment of the electronic structure of solids
using a dynamical functional. Our approach leverages the so-called dynamical
Hubbard functional, which generalizes the DFT+$U$ correction by incorporating
frequency-dependent screening, augmenting the static density functional to
accurately describe both spectral and thermodynamic properties of materials
with $d$- or $f$-localized orbitals near the Fermi level. To enable this, we
employ the algorithmic-inversion method based on a sum-over-poles
representation, resulting in a numerically accurate self-consistent scheme for
frequency-integrated properties, while keeping real-axis spectral resolution
for dynamically-resolved quantities. Using this framework, we study the
paradigmatic correlated solid SrVO$_3$, accurately reproducing its spectral
features, essentially confirming previous one-shot predictions, and improving
the description of its equilibrium properties, such as the equilibrium volume
and bulk modulus, bringing these significantly closer to experimental
measurements.

We report the development of the [Pt0.75Ti0.25/Co-Ni multilayer/Ta]n
superlattice with strong spin-orbit torque, large perpendicular magnetic
anisotropy, and low switching current density. We demonstrate that the
efficiency of the spin-orbit torque increases linearly with the repetition
number n, which is in good agreement with the spin Hall effect of the
Pt0.75Ti0.25 being the only source of the spin-orbit torque. Meanwhile, the
perpendicular magnetic anisotropy field is also enhanced by more than a factor
of 2 as n increases from 1 to 6. The [Pt0.75Ti0.25/(Co/Ni)3/Ta]n superlattice
also exhibits deterministic, low-current-density magnetization switching
despite the very large layer thicknesses. The combination of the strong
spin-orbit torque, perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, and low-current-density
switching makes the [Pt0.75Ti0.25/Co-Ni multilayer/Ta]n superlattice a
compelling material candidate for ultrafast, energy-efficient,
long-data-retention spintronic technologies.

V$_{1-x}$Al$_x$ is a representative example of highly resistive metallic
alloys exhibiting a crossover to a negative temperature coefficient of
resistivity (TCR), known as the Mooij correlation. Despite numerous proposals
to explain this anomalous behavior,none have provided a satisfactory
quantitative explanation thus far. In this work, we calculate the electrical
conductivity using an ab initio methodology that combines the Kubo-Greenwood
formalism with the coherent potential approximation (CPA). The temperature
dependence of the conductivity is obtained within a CPA-based model of thermal
atomic vibrations. Using this approach, we observe the crossover to the
negative TCR behavior in V$_{1-x}$Al$_x$, with the temperature coefficient
following the Mooij correlation, which matches experimental observations in the
intermediate-to-high temperature range.Analysis of the results allows us to
clearly identify a non-Boltzmann contribution responsible for this behavior and
describe it as a function of temperature and composition.

### Pulsed laser synthesis of mesoporous metal chalcogenide thin films

Mesoporous films of the metal chalcogenide $\beta$-FeSe were grown on MgO
substrates by KrF pulsed laser deposition (PLD) in an argon background. At 100
mTorr, gated intensified charge-coupled device imaging and ion probe
measurements showed that the plasma plume responsible for crystal growth
initially comprised three components, with distinct expansion velocities. Plume
interactions with the substrate heater and ablation target gave rise to complex
dynamics, including collisions between the charged leading edge -- rebounding
between the substrate and the target -- and slower-moving species in the plume
interior. Film growth was dominated by species with kinetic energies $\le$0.5
eV/atom. X-ray reflectivity and atomic force microscopy revealed that films
grown in this environment -- with a substrate temperature of 350$^\circ$C, a
laser fluence of 1.0 J cm$^{-2}$, and a 7.5 mm$^2$ spot area -- formed a porous
framework with 15% porosity and pore sizes below 100 nm. X-ray diffraction
indicated that the porous films were epitaxial with respect to the substrate
and likely grew by oriented-attachment of gas-phase molecular clusters or very
small nanoparticles, in contrast to the conventional epitaxy of vacuum films
from atomic constituents. The in-plane orientation of the mesoporous films was
$\beta$-FeSe[100]$\parallel$[110]MgO, attributed to the soft landing of
pre-formed crystallites on the MgO substrates, where protruding Se rows of
$\beta$-FeSe aligned with corrugations of the MgO surface. This work implies
that growth of candidate electrocatalyst materials by PLD in inert gas
background may allow mesoporous frameworks with a single crystallographic
orientation that expose specific crystal facets for electrochemical reactions
and active site engineering.

Kagome materials have garnered substantial attention owing to their diverse
physical phenomena, yet canonical systems such as the AV$_3$Sb$_5$ family
exhibit poor $Z_{2}$-type topological properties, spurring an urgent quest for
kagome platforms hosting ideal topological states. Recently, Zhou et al.
proposed the kagome-type IAMX family, which exhibits distinctive ideal
topological states; however, their analysis is primarily restricted to the
spinless approximation. In this work, we model relativistic effects in the IAMX
family, demonstrating that tuning the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) strength drives
topological phase transitions and induces novel topological states, resulting
in a rich phase diagram. The configuration of topological surface states
evolves continuously as the SOC strength is modulated, consistent with the
evolution of the topological phase transition. This suggests a viable route
toward designing multi-functional topological devices. First-principles
calculations performed on three specific IAMX compounds confirm that SOC
governs their topological phases, in complete accord with our model analysis.

Efficient and scalable photocatalysts for solar water splitting remain a
critical challenge in renewable energy research. The work presents a
high-throughput first-principles discovery of two-dimensional (2D) type-II van
der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs) optimized for visible-light-driven
photocatalytic water splitting. We screened 482 heterostructures constructed
from 60 experimentally realizable 2D monolayers and identified 148 stable
type-II vdWHs with spatially separated valence and conduction band edges, out
of which 65 satisfy the thermodynamic redox conditions for water splitting over
a broad pH range. Among these, the best two, MoTe2/Tl2O and MoSe2/WSe2, exhibit
a high visible-light absorption coefficient exceeding 0.6X10^6 cm-1, resulting
in a high power conversion efficiency of 2%. Quantum kinetic analysis of the
hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) reveals nearly barrierless free energy
profiles across multiple adsorption sites. Our study further reveals that
intrinsic interlayer electric fields in these vdWHs drive directional charge
separation, suppressing carrier recombination. Our results establish a design
framework for using type-II 2D heterostructures as tunable and experimentally
accessible 2D photocatalysts for efficient hydrogen production.

### Symmetry Classification of Altermagnetism and Emergence of Type-IV Magnetism in Two Dimensions

- **TL;DR**: 本文提出了二维类型-IV磁性的新概念，超越了传统的铁磁、反铁磁和交变磁性的分类框架，建立了对称性分类体系并展示了其丰富的功能特性。

Two-dimensional (2D) magnetism, particularly 2D altermagnetism (AM), has
attracted considerable interest due to its exceptional physical properties and
broad application potential. However, the classification of AM undergoes a
fundamental paradigm shift when transitioning from three-dimensional (3D) to 2D
symmetry-enforced fully compensated collinear magnetism$-$a shift that has
remained largely overlooked. Here, by extending unconventional magnetism to 2D
collinear systems, we identify the symmetry conditions and electronic band
characteristics of a distinct magnetic phase: type-IV magnetism. This new class
lies beyond the established descriptions of ferromagnetism, conventional
antiferromagnetism, and AM. Type-IV magnetism supports the successive emergence
of both nonrelativistic spin-degenerate and relativistic spin-splitting
phenomena, belonging strictly to neither conventional antiferromagnetism nor
standard AM. We further establish a universal symmetry classification framework
for 2D type-IV magnets via a mapping from the collinear spin layer group to the
magnetic layer group. Monolayer MgCr$_2$O$_3$ and monolayer BaMn$_2$Ch$_3$
(Ch=Se, Te) are showcased as representative materials, exhibiting gate-tunable
reversible spin textures and the quantum electric Hall effect, respectively.
Our work underscores the rich functional prospects of type-IV magnets, offering
a new route toward spin manipulation and anomalous transport that promises
innovative designs for high-performance spintronic devices.

### Learning Reaction-Diffusion Kinetics from Mechanical Information

A central challenge in materials science is characterizing chemical processes
that are elusive to direct measurement, particularly in functional materials
operating under realistic conditions. Here, we demonstrate that mechanical
strain fields contain sufficient information to reconstruct hidden chemical
kinetics in coupled chemomechanical systems. Our partial differential
equation-constrained learning framework decodes concentration-dependent
diffusion kinetics, thermodynamic driving forces, and spatially heterogeneous
reaction rates solely from mechanical observations. Using battery electrode
materials as a model system, we demonstrate that the framework can accurately
identify complex constitutive laws governing three distinct scenarios:
classical Fickian diffusion, spinodal decomposition with pattern formation, and
heterogeneous electrochemical reactions with spatial rate variations. The
approach demonstrates robustness while maintaining accuracy with limited
spatial data and reasonable experimental noise levels. Most significantly, the
framework simultaneously infers multiple fundamental processes and properties,
including diffusivity, reaction kinetics, chemical potential, and spatial
heterogeneity maps, all from mechanical information alone. This method
establishes a paradigm for materials characterization, enabling accurate
learning of chemical processes in energy storage systems, catalysts, and
phase-change materials where conventional diagnostics prove difficult. By
revealing that mechanical deformation patterns serve as information-rich
fingerprints of the underlying chemical processes, this work follows the
pathway of inversely learning constitutive laws, with broad implications in
materials science and engineering.

### Experimental demonstration of two distinct pathways of trion generation in monolayer MoS2

Excitation power and energy dependent photoluminescence (PL) and transient
absorption spectroscopy (TAS) studies are carried out on chemical vapour
deposition (CVD) grown 1L-MoS2 films to understand the process of trion
formation. The study shows that the excitation with sufficiently low photon
energy results in the creation of trions directly in the K/K' valleys through
photon absorption followed by phonon scattering events. On the other hand,
excitation energy sufficiently larger than the band-gap can generate the
carriers away from the K/K' valleys. Dissimilarity in the rates of relaxation
of the photo-excited electrons and the holes to the bottom of the K/K' valleys
results in the transformation of the excitons residing there into trions. Our
TAS study clearly demonstrates a temporary increase of the trion population in
the K/K' valleys. Moreover, excitation intensity dependent PL spectroscopy
performed under above-band-gap excitation, also suggests the coexistence of
both the pathways of trion generation in this material. This conclusion is
further validated by a rate equation model. Our findings provide valuable
insight into the formation of trions in monolayer transition metal
dichalcogenides (TMDC), which could be crucial in designing valleytronic
devices based on trions.

We develop a twist-angle transferable continuum model for twisted transition
metal dichalcogenide (tTMD) homobilayers, using tMoTe2 and tWSe2 as examples.
All model parameters are extracted from density functional theory (DFT)
calculations at a single twist angle (3.89{\deg}) and monolayer data. Our model
captures both lattice relaxation effects and the long-range behavior of
piezoelectric and ferroelectric potentials. Leveraging lattice relaxations
obtained via machine learning force fields (MLFFs), the model can be
efficiently transferred to other twist angles without requiring additional DFT
calculations. It accurately reproduces the DFT band dispersions and quantum
geometries across a wide range of twist angles. Furthermore, our model reveals
that a second flat Chern band arises near 2{\deg} when the interlayer potential
difference becomes comparable to the interlayer tunneling. This continuum model
provides a clear understanding and starting point for engineering novel
electronic phases in moir\'e TMDs through twist angles and lattice relaxations.

Universal machine learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs) represent arguably
the most successful application of machine learning to materials science,
demonstrating remarkable performance across diverse applications. However,
critical blind spots in their reliability persist. Here, we address one such
significant gap by systematically investigating the accuracy of uMLIPs under
extreme pressure conditions from 0 to 150 GPa. Our benchmark reveals that while
these models excel at standard pressure, their predictive accuracy deteriorates
considerably as pressure increases. This decline in performance originates from
fundamental limitations in the training data rather than in algorithmic
constraints. In fact, we show that through targeted fine-tuning on
high-pressure configurations, the robustness of the models can be easily
increased. These findings underscore the importance of identifying and
addressing overlooked regimes in the development of the next generation of
truly universal interatomic potentials.

We investigate the microscopic origin and spectral features of X-ray magnetic
circular dichroism (XMCD) in collinear antiferromagnets with trigonal crystal
fields, using $\alpha$-MnTe as a prototypical example. Although such systems
exhibit zero net magnetization, we demonstrate that XMCD can emerge from the
anisotropic magnetic dipole operator $T_{z}$, arising from quadrupolar spin
distributions. By constructing a complete multipole basis and analyzing the
symmetry conditions under trigonal distortion, we identify specific spin and
orbital configurations that enable a finite XMCD response. Further, we employ
both one-electron and multi-electron models, including spin-orbit coupling and
Coulomb interactions, to calculate the XMCD spectra for various $d^n$
configurations. Our findings provide theoretical benchmarks for XMCD in
altermagnets and highlight the key role of orbital symmetry and magnetic
anisotropy in realizing observable dichroic effects.

Hexagonal boron nitride ($h$-BN), with its strong in-plane bonding and good
lattice match to hcp and fcc metals, offers a promising alternative barrier
material for magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). Here, we investigate
spin-dependent transport in
hcp-Co$_{1-x}$Ni$_{x}$$/$$h$-BN$/$hcp-Co$_{1-x}$Ni$_{x}$(0001) MTJs with
physisorption-type interfaces using first-principles calculations. We find that
a high TMR ratio arises from the resonant tunneling of the down-spin surface
states of the hcp-Co$_{1-x}$Ni$_{x}$, having a $\Delta_1$-like symmetry around
the $\Gamma$ point. Ni doping tunes the Fermi level and enhances this effect by
reducing the overlap between up-spin and down-spin conductance channels in
momentum space under the parallel configuration, thereby suppressing
antiparallel conductance and increasing the TMR ratio. This mechanism is
analogous to Brillouin zone spin filtering and is sensitive to the interfacial
distance but not specific to $h$-BN barriers; similar behavior may emerge in
MTJs with other two-dimensional insulators or semiconductors. These findings
provide insight into surface-state-assisted tunneling mechanisms and offer
guidance for the interface engineering of next-generation spintronic devices.

We present MACE-Field, a field-aware $O(3)$-equivariant interatomic potential
that provides a compact, derivative-consistent route to dielectric properties
(such as polarisation $\mathbf P$, Born effective charges $Z^*$ and
polarisability $\boldsymbol\alpha$) and finite-field simulations across
chemistry for inorganic solids. A uniform electric field is injected within
each message-passing layer via a Clebsch-Gordan tensor-product which couples
the field to latent spherical-tensor features, and perturbs them via an
equivariant residual mixing. This plug-in design preserves the standard MACE
readout and can inherit existing MACE foundation weights, turning pretrained
models into field-aware ones with minimal change. To demonstrate, we train: (i)
a cross-chemistry ferroelectric polarisation model (2.5k nonpolar$\!\to$polar
polarisation branches), (ii) a cross-chemistry BECs/polarisability model
($\sim$6k Materials Project dielectrics spanning 81 elements), and (iii-iv)
single-material molecular dynamics on BaTiO$_3$ and $\alpha$-SiO$_2$. The
models recover polarisation branches and spontaneous polarisation, predict
$Z^*$ and $\boldsymbol\alpha$ (hence $\varepsilon_\infty$) across diverse
chemistries, and reproduce BaTiO$_3$ hysteresis and the IR/Raman and dielectric
spectra of $\alpha$-quartz, benchmarking comparatively with Allegro-pol.

Altermagnetic materials have attracted a lot of attention recently due to the
numerous effects, which have an application potential and occur due to the
spin-split band structure coexisting with the compensated magnetic order.
Incorporation of such intriguing compounds into low-dimensional structures
represents an important avenue towards exploiting and enhancing their
functionalities. Prominent examples of this group are semiconductors well
suited to the band-gap engineering strategies. Here, we present for the first
time visible-light-emitting CdSe quantum wells, in which wurtzite MnSe as an
alermagnetic candidate plays the role of a barrier. Photoluminescence
experiments with temporal resolution demonstrate that in such quantum wells, a
built-in electric field is present and strongly influences the energies of the
emitted photons, the dynamics of recombination, and excitation power
dependence. Numerical simulations allow us to estimate that the magnitude of
the electric field is 14MV/m. We anticipate that such quantum wells offer
potential to probe the barrier properties and that wurtzite MnSe is an
interesting platform to study the interplay of the altermagnetism and built-in
electric field.

Foundational machine learning interatomic potentials that can accurately and
efficiently model a vast range of materials are critical for accelerating
atomistic discovery. We introduce universal potentials based on the graph
atomic cluster expansion (GRACE) framework, trained on several of the largest
available materials datasets. Through comprehensive benchmarks, we demonstrate
that the GRACE models establish a new Pareto front for accuracy versus
efficiency among foundational interatomic potentials. We further showcase their
exceptional versatility by adapting them to specialized tasks and simpler
architectures via fine-tuning and knowledge distillation, achieving high
accuracy while preventing catastrophic forgetting. This work establishes GRACE
as a robust and adaptable foundation for the next generation of atomistic
modeling, enabling high-fidelity simulations across the periodic table.

Coherent phonon control using ultrashort pulse trains is the key to realizing
structural phase transitions in solids by non-thermal pathways. By combining
double-pulse excitation and time-resolved second harmonic generation techniques
under high-density electronic excitation in a 2D layered material, WTe$_{2}$,
we demonstrate that the lattice symmetry switching from the Weyl semimetallic
T$_{d}$ to the semimetallic 1T$^{\prime}$ phases is independent of the
amplitude of the coherent interlayer shear phonons. This finding provides new
insights into the mechanisms for symmetry switching that electronic
excitation-driven shear sliding plays a dominant role.

- **TL;DR**: 研究通过全局适度透火或局部激光加热导致GeSe系统中高导电性gamma-GeSe向半导体alpha-GeSe相变，并在相界面保持良好对准的晶体定向

Understanding phase transitions between crystalline phases of a material is
crucial for both fundamental research and potential applications such as
phase-change memory. In this study, we investigate the phase transition between
GeSe crystalline polymorphs induced by either global annealing at moderate
temperatures or localized laser-induced heating. The highly conductive
gamma-GeSe transforms into semiconducting, single-crystalline alpha-GeSe while
preserving a well-aligned crystal orientation. The distinct structural and
electronic properties at the gamma-GeSe/alpha-GeSe interface were investigated
by transmission electron microscopy analysis. We propose that the clustering of
Ge vacancies in the gamma-GeSe phase at elevated temperatures is a key
mechanism driving the transition, leading to the formation of alpha-GeSe
through the segregation of a minor GeSe2 phase. Furthermore, we observe a high
electrical resistance contrast of approximately 10^7 between gamma-GeSe and
alpha-GeSe, underscoring the potential of GeSe as a model polymorphic system
for electronic applications, including phase-change memory.

### Highly anisotropic 1D materials supported in exfoliable 2D coordination polymers with optical anisotropy switching via twist-engineering

- **TL;DR**: 该研究开发了一种分子策略，通过将一维材料组装到二维金属有机框架(MOFs)中，创建了由互连链组成的层状结构，展示了高度各向异性的光学性质，并可通过化学取代和vdW异质结构进行调控。

Van der Waals (vdW) materials provide a platform to study and control the
physical properties of low-dimensional materials. While strategies developed
for two-dimensional (2D) crystals are not directly transferable to
one-dimensional (1D) systems, we can benefit from them by creating layers
formed by interconnected chains. Here, we develop a molecular strategy to
illustrate this concept consisting of assembling 1D materials in 2D
metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). Crystals of [FeX(pzX)(bpy)] (X = Cl, F; pz =
pyrazole; bpy = bipyridine) consist of iron chains along the b-axis,
crosslinked via bpy ligands along the a-axis to form 2D layers, stacked along
the c-axis via vdW forces. This structural anisotropy manifests itself in
highly-anisotropic optical properties, as demonstrated by optical measurements
in the visible and terahertz ranges, results which are supported by DFT
calculations. Chemical substitution enables the tuning of the optical
properties, as exemplified by the photoluminescence of the Cl-derivative, which
is quenched for the F-derivative. Thin-layers are obtained by mechanical
exfoliation, and their optical properties are further tuned through the
fabrication of orthogonally-twisted vdW heterostructures, enabling to
effectively switch-off the optical anisotropy. Our work highlights the chemical
flexibility of vdW layered MOFs as a platform for designing and manipulating 1D
architectures.

We present a versatile confocal microscopy setup for optical second harmonic
generation (SHG) and multi-photon spectroscopy that enables
polarization-resolved studies of semiconductor bulk crystals and
low-dimensional structures. The system offers full polarization control in both
excitation and detection, spatial scanning with micrometer resolution, and
spectrally tunable excitation over a broad energy range from 0.5 to 4.0 eV,
using femtosecond and picosecond laser pulses. Samples are mounted in a
helium-flow cryostat, allowing temperature control from 4 to 300 K. Magnetic
fields up to 0.625 T can be applied in the Voigt geometry via an electromagnet.
The nonlinear optical signals are analyzed using a high-resolution spectrometer
with a spectral resolution of 60 $\mu$eV. We demonstrate the potential of the
setup by means of SHG polarization tomography measurements on a Cu$_2$O crystal
as well as through a SHG spectral scan of a ZnSe crystal over a wide energy
range from 1.4 to 3.1 eV. Polarization-resolved confocal SHG mapping of various
twisted mono- and bilayer MoS$_2$ structures is also presented. In addition,
time-resolved two-color pump-probe experiments are shown for a Cs$_2$AgBiBr$_6$
crystal, illustrating the potential of the system for investigating coherent
exciton and phonon dynamics.

- **TL;DR**: 成功生长出YSGAG固溶体单晶，并用于外延生长高质量YIG薄膜，在低温下表现出优于传统GGG基底的微波性能

Y3Sc2Ga3O12-Y3Sc2Al3O12 and Y3Sc2Ga3O12-Y3Al5O12 (YSGAG) solid solution
single crystals with diameters up to 30 mm and total lengths up to about 100 mm
were grown by the conventional Czochralski technique. Rocking curve
measurements on polished sections revealed typical FWHM values of about 22
arcsec, which is indicative of relatively high structural quality for a
solid-solution crystal. The grown substrate crystals are nearly lattice-matched
with Y3Fe5O12 (YIG) to allow epitaxial growth of high-quality thin films.
Single crystalline YIG films with thicknesses between 100 nanometer and 2.9
micrometer were successfully grown on epi-polished YSGAG substrates using
liquid phase epitaxy (LPE). Selected magnetic and microwave properties of the
epitaxial films, which still exhibit small lattice misfits to the substrates,
were then studied at room temperature. In addition, initial low-temperature
investigations confirm that the YIG/YSGAG system is superior to the
conventional YIG/GGG (Gd3Ga5O12) system at temperatures below 10 K, as the
ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) linewidth does not increase with decreasing
temperature. Therefore, the novel diamagnetic substrates are better suited for
microwave applications at low temperature, as excessive damping losses induced
by paramagnetic substrates can be avoided. It therefore seems to be a suitable
pathway to achieve scalable microwave components for hybrid-integrated quantum
systems based on ultralow-damping YIG films that can operate efficiently at
millikelvin temperatures.

- **TL;DR**: 开发了Cu-Ag二元合金的矩矩矩指数潜力(MTP)，在精度、转移性和热力学保真度方面显著改善了传统EAM潜力，特别是在缺陷能量、表面性质和共湿相图预测方面

A Moment Tensor Potential (MTP) has been developed for the Cu-Ag binary alloy
and its accuracy, transferability, and thermodynamic fidelity evaluated. The
model was trained on a diverse dataset encompassing solid, liquid, and
interfacial configurations derived from density functional theory (DFT)
calculations. Benchmarking against experiment and DFT data demonstrated
significant improvements over the widely used classical Embedded Atom Method
(EAM) potential, particularly in predicting defect energetics, surface
properties, and the eutectic phase diagram. Despite a slight underestimation of
Ag's melting point, the MTP model achieved consistent accuracy across elemental
and binary systems without direct fitting to high-temperature phase
transitions. The predicted eutectic temperature and composition were found in
close agreement with experimental observations. These results establish MTP as
a robust framework for modeling immiscible metallic systems and pave the way
for its integration into large-scale atomistic simulations where both fidelity
and generalizability are essential.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究合成了Zr2CuSb3单晶，通过实验和理论计算证实其具有棋盘格晶格结构，表现出金属性行为和显著的kz展宽电子特征。

The checkerboard lattice has been proposed to host topological flat bands as
a result of destructive interference among its various electronic hopping
terms. However, it has proven challenging to realize experimentally due to the
difficulty of isolating this structure from any significant out-of-plane
bonding while maintaining structural integrity. Here, single crystals of
Zr2CuSb3, a potential candidate for the checkerboard lattice, were synthesized
using the solution (self-flux) method, and their structure was confirmed via
X-ray diffraction. Electrical transport measurements indicate metallic behavior
with electron-dominated carriers. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
reveals multiple electron pockets and significant kz broadening due to its
large c-axis and low dispersion features in k z. Density functional theory
calculations further disentangle the contributions from each high-symmetry
plane, providing a comprehensive characterization of electronic behavior.

### Atomistic Structure of Transient Switching States in Ferroelectric AlScN

- **TL;DR**: 通过多种先进技术结合，发现AlScN的极化切换机制是通过集体的逐列原子位移进行，形成棱棕形180°域壁，而非之前认为的过渡非极性中间相。Sc内容增加会降低域壁能和核形成障碍，从而降低切换场强。

We resolve the microscopic mechanism of polarization switching in wurtzite
ferroelectric AlScN by integrating advanced thin-film fabrication,
ferroelectric switching dynamics characterizations, high-resolution scanning
transmission electron microscopy (STEM), and large-scale molecular dynamics
simulations enabled by a deep neural network-based interatomic potential.
Contrary to earlier interpretations proposing a transient nonpolar intermediate
phase, we demonstrate that the broad transitional regions previously observed
in STEM images are projection artifacts resulting from the intrinsic
three-dimensional zigzag morphology of 180$^\circ$ domain walls, which are a
characteristic form of inversion domain boundary. This is further confirmed by
STEM imaging of strategically prepared, partially switched
Al$_{0.75}$Sc$_{0.25}$N thin films. Our simulations reveal that switching
proceeds through collective, column-by-column atomic displacements, directly
explaining the emergence of zigzag-shaped domain walls, and is consistent with
the nucleation-limited switching behavior observed in experimental switching
dynamic measurements. Furthermore, we show that increasing Sc content
systematically lowers domain wall energy and associated nucleation barrier,
thereby reducing the switching field in agreement with experimental trends.
These findings establish a direct connection between local domain wall
structure, switching kinetics, and macroscopic ferroelectric behavior.
