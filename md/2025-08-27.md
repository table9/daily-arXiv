- **TL;DR**: 提出一种低成本计算超导临界温度的方法，通过粗网格计算电子-声子谱函数并重新标定，可快速准确预测Tc值

First principles computational methods can predict the superconducting
critical temperature $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ of conventional superconductors through
the electron-phonon spectral function. Full convergence of this quantity
requires Brillouin zone integration on very dense grids, presenting a
bottleneck to high-throughput screening for high $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ systems. In
this work, we show that an electron-phonon spectral function calculated at low
cost on a coarse grid yields accurate $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ predictions, provided
the function is rescaled to correct for the inaccurate value of the density of
states at the Fermi energy on coarser grids. Compared to standard approaches,
the method converges rapidly and improves the accuracy of predictions for
systems with sharp features in the density of states. This approach can be
directly integrated into existing materials screening workflows, enabling the
rapid identification of promising candidates that might otherwise be
overlooked.

### Why Compressed Metal Hydrides are Near-room-temperature Superconductors

- **TL;DR**: 这篇论文提供了对金属氢化物超导体高过渡温度的部分解释，提出通过原子位移简化效应的新方法来深入理解为什么氢元素能够实现高温度超导，并提高计算效率和指导新材料搜索。

This contribution provides a partial response to the titular statement since,
it will be claimed,the ``why'' is not yet understood, but there is a pathway
for achieving a more complete understanding. The sense of the community has
been that, given a prospective metal hydride and pressure, the energy landscape
can be surveyed computationally for thermodynamic and dynamic stability, the
Eliashberg spectral function with its required input (energy bands, phonon
modes, coupling matrix elements) can be calculated, and the critical
temperature T$_c$ obtained. Satisfyingly large values of the electron-phonon
coupling strength $\lambda$=2-3 at high mean frequency are obtained, giving
very reasonable agreement with existing high T$_c$ hydrides. Typically 80-85\%
of $\lambda$ is attributable to high frequency H vibrations. This much was
envisioned by Ashcroft two decades ago, so why should there be any angst? This
paper addresses more specifically the question {\it why hydrogen?} Light mass
is indeed a factor, but with possibilities not yet explored. This paper
provides a concise overview of related formal developments occurring
sporadically over several decades that, when implemented, could resolve the
question of {\it why hydrogen, why so high T$_c$.} The dearth of success of
numerous high throughput searches proposing higher T$_c$ materials, especially
hydrides, is touched on briefly. Based on as yet unapplied developments in
simplifying effects of atomic displacement, it is proposed that there is a
straightforward path toward a deeper understanding of ``metallic hydrogen
superconductivity" in conjunction with added computational efficiency, and that
some human-learning should assist in focusing the search for higher T$_c$
superconductors.

- **TL;DR**: 利用二维超导体NbSe₂制造纳米线单光子探测器，在780和1550nm波长实现单光子探测，暗计数率低于1Hz，时间抖动小于50ps，理论截止波长可达毫米波范围

Superconducting Nanowire Single-Photon Detectors (SNSPDs) are key building
blocks for photonic quantum technologies due to their ability to detect single
photons with ultra-high efficiency, low dark counts and fast temporal
resolution. Superconducting materials exhibiting high uniformity, large
absorption cross-section and atomic-scale thickness are desirable to extend
single-photon detection from the near-infrared up to the terahertz regime,
where existing material choices are especially constrained. Substrate
independence would further open the way to integrate detectors onto functional
materials and heterostructures, enhancing performance and enabling proximal
read-out of a wide range of individual excitations. Here, we top-down shape the
prototypical two-dimensional superconductor niobium diselenide (NbSe$_2$) into
few-layer nanowires less than 100 nm wide and demonstrate single-photon
detection at 780 and 1550 nm. At the same time, the dark-count rate remains
below 1 Hz up to the switching current and we achieve a timing jitter below 50
ps. We use a diffusive hot-spot model to estimate a theoretical cut-off
wavelength that surpasses the millimetre range. Our results open up routes
toward quantum limited detectors integrated into quantum-photonic circuits and
quantum devices, with the potential for novel detection capabilities and
unprecedented energy sensitivity.

### Scalable Effective Models for Superconducting Nanostructures: Applications to Double, Triple, and Quadruple Quantum Dots

- **TL;DR**: 提出了链展开(ChE)方法，用于构建超导纳米结构的有效模型，通过将超导引线映射到有限紧束缚链，保持低能物理的同时实现高效模拟

We introduce a versatile and scalable framework for constructing effective
models of superconducting (SC) nanostructures described by the generalized SC
Anderson impurity model with multiple quantum dots and leads. Our Chain
Expansion (ChE) method maps each SC lead onto a finite tight-binding chain with
parameters obtained from Pad\'e approximants of the tunneling self-energy. We
provide an explicit algorithm for the general case as well as simple analytical
expressions for the chain parameters in the wide-band and infinite-chain
limits. This mapping preserves low-energy physics while enabling efficient
simulations: short chains are tractable with exact diagonalization, and longer
ones with density matrix renormalization group methods. The approach remains
reliable and computationally efficient across diverse geometries, both in and
out of equilibrium. We use ChE to map the ground-state phase diagrams of
double, triple, and quadruple quantum dots coupled to a single SC lead. While
half-filled symmetric systems show similar overall diagrams, the particular
phases differ substantially with dot number. Here, large parameter regions are
entirely missed by the widely used zero-bandwidth approximation but are
captured by ChE. Away from half-filling, additional dots markedly increase
diagram complexity, producing a rich variety of stable phases. These results
demonstrate ChE as a fast, accurate, and systematically improvable tool for
exploring complex SC nanostructures.

### Spin Freezing in Oscillator Ising Machines: When Second Harmonic Injection Impedes Computation

- **TL;DR**: 二次谐波注入在振荡器伊辛机中会导致自旋冻结现象，阻碍系统达到更低能量状态。研究发现特定相位初始化（π或π/2）能延迟冻结并提高解的质量。

Second harmonic injection (SHI) has emerged as a critical mechanism in
enabling networks of coupled oscillators to function as Oscillator Ising
Machines (OIMs), capable of minimizing the Ising Hamiltonian. While SHI
facilitates phase binarization essential for mapping oscillator phases to spin
states, we demonstrate that it can also induce a previously unreported
phenomenon -- spin freezing -- where oscillator spins are unable to transition
between spin states, even when such a transition can reduce the Ising energy.
This freezing effect can impair the analog dynamics of the OIM, preventing it
from reaching lower-energy spin configurations. Through theoretical analysis
and numerical simulations, we show that the onset of spin freezing is highly
sensitive to the initial phase configuration of the oscillators. Contrary to
conventional practice, which favors random initialization, we find that
initializing all oscillators at specific phase values ($\phi = \pi$ or $\phi =
\frac{\pi}{2}$) delays the onset of spin freezing and consistently yields
higher-quality solutions. These findings point to the need to carefully
engineer the SHI for optimal performance.

### Computational study of alpha-ray induced electron excitation in diamonds for radiation detection

- **TL;DR**: 基于时间依存密度函数理论的实时模拟方法，研究钻石在阿射线煮射下的电子激发机制和检测性能

To investigate the mechanism of radiation detection in diamonds, we developed
a real time time dependent density functional theory based calculation scheme
to evaluate changes in the density of states induced by alpha ray irradiation.
A bulk diamond structural model was constructed, with impurities optionally
introduced to assess their effect on electronic excitation. Simulations
revealed that the passage of high speed helium ions, representing alpha
particles, produced significant electronic excitation in the diamond model.
Subsequent calculations of the excited state dynamics after ion removal
indicated that excitation can persist for several hundred femtoseconds without
triggering nonradiative relaxation. These findings demonstrate that the
proposed approach offers a robust theoretical framework for evaluating the
performance of diamond-based radiation detectors.

### Destructive Interference induced constraints in Floquet systems

- **TL;DR**: 本文提出通过量子轨迹间的破坏性多体干涉来生成Floquet系统中的预热动力学约束，展示了如何通过驱动频率控制产生有/无偶极矩守恒的强希尔伯特空间碎片化。

We introduce the paradigm of destructive many-body interference between
quantum trajectories as a means to systematically generate prethermal
kinetically constrained dynamics in Floquet systems driven at special
frequencies. Depending on the processes that are suppressed by interference,
the constraint may or may not be associated with an emergent global
conservation; the latter kind having no mechanism of generation in
time-independent settings. As an example, we construct an one-dimensional
interacting spin model exhibiting strong Hilbert space fragmentation with and
without dipole moment conservation, depending on the drive frequency. By
probing the spatiotemporal profile of the out-of-time-ordered correlator, we
show that this model, in particular, has initial states in which quantum
information can be spatially localized - a useful feature in the field of
quantum technologies. Our paradigm unifies various types of Hilbert space
fragmentation that can be realized in driven systems.

### Full counting statistics and first-passage times in quantum Markovian processes: Ensemble relations, metastability, and fluctuation theorems

- **TL;DR**: 本文开发了一个统一框架，结合全计数统计和首次通过时间两种方法，研究量子输运和非平衡热力学中的涨落现象，揭示了马尔可夫量子系统中首次通过时间统计的完整图像。

We develop a comprehensive framework for characterizing fluctuations in
quantum transport and nonequilibrium thermodynamics using two complementary
approaches: full counting statistics and first-passage times. Focusing on open
quantum systems governed by Markovian Lindblad dynamics, we derive general
ensemble relations that connect the two approaches at all times, and we clarify
how the steady states reached at long times relate to those reached at large
jump counts. In regimes of metastability, long-lived intermediate states cause
violations of experimentally testable cumulant relations, as we discuss. We
also formulate a fluctuation theorem governing the probability of rare
fluctuations in the first-passage time distributions based on results from full
counting statistics. Our results apply to general integer-valued trajectory
observables that do not necessarily increase monotonically in time. Three
illustrative applications, a two-state emitter, a driven qubit, and a variant
of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, highlight the physical implications of our
results and provide guidelines for practical calculations. Our framework
provides a complete picture of first-passage time statistics in Markovian
quantum systems, encompassing multiple earlier results, and it has direct
implications for current experiments in quantum optics, superconducting
circuits, and nanoscale heat engines.

### Enzyme-free in situ polymerization of conductive polymers catalyzed by porous Au@Ag nanowires for stretchable neural electrodes

- **TL;DR**: 使用具有过氧化酯激活性的多孔金包银纳米线作为催化剂，在中性pH条件下实现了无霉素参与的导电聚合物原位聚合，提高了电极的电气性能

In situ polymerization of conductive polymers (CPs) represents a
transformative approach in bioelectronics, by enabling the controlled growth of
electrically active materials right at the tissue or device surface to create
seamless biotic-abiotic interfaces. Traditional CP deposition techniques often
use high anodic potentials, non-physiological electrolytes, or strong oxidants,
making them harmful to adjacent tissues. A possible solution is enzymatic
polymerization which operates under milder conditions, but it is limited by the
stability and activity window of the enzyme catalysts, low throughput, and
challenges in spatially confining polymer growth. To resolve these issues, here
we developed one-dimensional porous Au-coated Ag nanowires with horseradish
peroxidase (HRP)-like catalytic properties, thereby for the first time enabling
mild in situ enzyme-free polymerization of conductive polymers near neutral pH.
The enzyme-free polymerization is demonstrated both in aqueous dispersions at
pH=6 and in situ onto porous Au coated Ag nanowire based stretchable
electrodes. Following enzyme-free catalytic polymerization, the electrically
conducting polymer coating on the electrode greatly improves the impedance and
achieves an impedance of 2.6 kOhm at 1 kHz for 50x50 um large electrodes.

### Odd relaxation in three-dimensional Fermi liquids

- **TL;DR**: 三维费米液体中也存在奇偶宇称模式弛豫速率差异，与二维情况类似，奇宇称模式弛豫更慢，差异可达40%，并在横向电导率和集体模式结构中有特征表现

Recent theoretical works predict a hierarchy of long-lived, non-hydrodynamic
modes in two-dimensional Fermi liquids arising from the feature -- supposedly
unique to two dimensions -- that relaxation by head-on scattering is not
efficient in the presence of Pauli blocking. This leads to a parity-based
separation of scattering rates, with odd-parity modes relaxing much more slowly
than even-parity ones. In this work, we establish that a similar effect exists
in isotropic three-dimensional Fermi liquids, even though relaxation does not
proceed solely by head-on scattering. We show that while the relaxation rates
of even and odd modes in 3D share the same leading-order $\sim T^2$
low-temperature scaling typical of Fermi liquids, their magnitudes differ, with
odd-parity modes relaxing more slowly than even ones for a broad class of
interactions. We find a relative difference between odd-and even-parity
relaxation rates as large as $40\%$ just by Pauli blocking alone, with a strong
additional dependence on the scattering potential, such that the odd-even
staggering is further enhanced by interactions that favor large-angle
scattering. We identify signatures of these odd-parity relaxation rates in the
static transverse conductivity as well as the transverse collective mode
structure. Our results establish the unexpected existence of a tomographic-like
regime in higher-dimensional Fermi liquids and suggest experimental probes via
transport measurements.

### Molecular polaritons dynamics in realistic cavities

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种结合经典麦克斯韦方程和量子DFTB电子动力学的新方法，用于模拟大量分子在光学腔中的极化激元化学过程，能够计算透射光谱并获得局部分子响应信息。

The large number of degrees of freedom involved in polaritonic chemistry
processes considerably restricts the systems that can be described by any ab
initio approach, due to the resulting high computational cost. Semiclassical
methods that treat light classically offer a promising route for overcoming
these limitations. In this work, we present a new implementation that combines
the numerical propagation of Maxwell's equations to simulate realistic cavities
with quantum electron dynamics at the density functional tight-binding (DFTB)
theory level. This implementation allows for the simulation of a large number
of molecules described at the atomistic level, interacting with cavity modes
obtained by numerically solving Maxwell's equations. By mimicking experimental
setups, our approach enables the calculation of transmission spectra, in which
we observe the corresponding polaritonic signals. In addition, we have access
to local information, revealing complex responses of individual molecules that
depend on the number, geometry, position, and orientation of the molecules
inside the cavity.

### Light-induced odd-parity altermagnets on dimerized lattices

Altermagnets are an emerging class of collinear magnets with
momentum-dependent spin splitting and zero net magnetization. These materials
can be broadly classified into two categories based on the behavior of spin
splitting at time-reversal-related momenta: even-parity and odd-parity
altermagnets. While even-parity altermagnets have been thoroughly investigated
both theoretically and experimentally, the systems capable of hosting
odd-parity altermagnetism remain largely unexplored. In this work, we
demonstrate that circularly polarized light dynamically converts collinear
PT-symmetric antiferromagnets on dimerized lattices into odd parity p-wave
altermagnets. Because of the underlying Dirac band structure of the dimerized
lattice, we find that the resulting p-wave altermagnets can realize Chern
insulators (2D) and Weyl semimetals (3D) under appropriate drive conditions.
Our findings demonstrate that collinear antiferromagnets on dimerized lattices
provide ideal platforms to investigate the dynamical generation of odd-parity
altermagnetism.

- **TL;DR**: 本文研究了d¹过渡金属三卤化物的强耦合模型，在强自旋轨道耦合极限下发现了SU(4)对称性在多个参数空间点出现，产生了独特的狄拉克自旋轨道液体态。

We study the strong coupling model of $d^1$ transition metal tri-halides in
the large spin-orbit coupled limit. By considering
ab-initio-calculation-inspired hierarchy of hopping pathways of these
compounds, SU(4) symmetry is found to emerge at multiple points in the
parameter space of the hopping parameters. The resultant Dirac spin-orbital
liquids, within the parton mean field description, are distinct. The calculated
dynamical structure factor fingerprints this distinctive nature, giving rise to
observable effects. This opens up a playground for SU(4) Dirac Spin-Orbital
liquid in $d^1$ Honeycomb lattice systems.

### Linear approximations of large deviations: Cubic diffusion test

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种基于线性化有效过程的近似方法，用于计算扩散过程时间积分可观测量的大偏差率函数，在一维非线性扩散模型上验证了有效性。

We propose a method for approximating the large deviation rate function of
time-integrated observables of diffusion processes, used in statistical physics
to characterize the fluctuations of nonequilibrium systems. The method is based
on linearizing the effective process associated with the large deviations of
the process and observable considered, and is tested for a simple
one-dimensional nonlinear diffusion model involving a cubic drift. The results
show that the linear approximation compares well with the exact rate function,
especially in the large fluctuation regime, and that its accuracy is related to
the way the linearized process localizes in space. Possible extensions and
applications to more complex diffusion models are proposed for future work.

### Reweighting scheme for the calculation of grand-canonical expectation values in quantum Monte Carlo simulations with a fermion sign problem

Ab initio path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations constitute the gold
standard for the estimation of a broad range of equilibrium properties of a
host of interacting quantum many-body systems spanning conditions from
ultracold atoms to warm dense quantum plasmas. A key practical limitation is
given by the notorious fermion sign problem, which manifests as an exponential
computational bottleneck with respect to system size and inverse temperature.
In practice, the sign problem is particularly severe in the grandcanonical
ensemble, where the bosonic and fermionic configuration spaces differ not only
with respect to the symmetry of the thermal density matrix but, crucially, also
with respect to the particle number distribution for a given chemical potential
$\mu$ [T. Dornheim, J. Phys. A 54, 335001 (2021)]. Here, we present a simple
reweighting scheme that basically allows one to retain access to grandcanonical
expectation values at the cost of fermionic PIMC simulations in the canonical
ensemble for the largest significant particle number in the fermionic sector.
As a practical example, we consider the warm dense electron gas, which has
attracted considerable recent attention due to its relevance, e.g., for the
modeling of compact astrophysical objects and inertial fusion energy
applications

### Odd-Parity Altermagnetism Originated from Orbital Orders

Odd-parity spin-splitting plays a central role in spintronics and
unconventional superconductivity, yet its microscopic realization in collinear
magnetic systems remains elusive. We propose a general symmetry-based strategy
for realizing odd-parity altermagnetism by stacking two noncentrosymmetric
monolayers in an interlayer antiferromagnetic configuration and applying an
in-plane layer-flip operation. In this setting, odd-parity spin-splitting
originates from nonrelativistic orbital orders rather than spin-orbit coupling,
and is protected by an effective time-reversal symmetry despite the explicit
time-reversal symmetry being broken. By exploiting lattice symmetries, our
framework enables the realization of both $p$- and $f$-wave altermagnets. The
resulting models generically host quantum spin Hall insulator phases, featuring
topologically protected helical edge states and quantized spin Hall
conductance. Our work expands the landscape of altermagnetic phases and opens a
pathway toward spintronics and unconventional superconductivity in
altermagnetic systems.

Directional solidification of water-based solutions has emerged as a
versatile technique to template hierarchical porous materials, but this
nonequilibrium process remains incompletely understood. Here we use phase-field
simulations to shed light on the mechanism that selects the growth direction of
the lamellar ice structure that templates those materials. Our results show
that this selection can be understood within the general framework of
spontaneous parity breaking, yielding quantitative predictions for the tilt
angle of lamellae with respect to the thermal axis. The results provide a
theoretical basis to interpret a wide range of experimental observations.

### Higher-Dimensional Chirally Stabilized Fixed Points and Their Deformations

Non-Fermi liquids in $d&gt;2$ remain poorly understood, particularly when
relevant perturbations destabilize them. In one spatial dimension, chirally
stabilized fixed points provide a rare class of analytically tractable
non-Fermi-liquid critical points, but their higher-dimensional analogues have
been elusive. Here, we develop a Wilsonian operator-product-expansion
renormalization group scheme that captures power-divergent terms and use it to
construct finite-$N$ higher-dimensional analogues of chirally stabilized fixed
points in arbitrary dimension $d\le4$. This exposes a conformal window at
finite $N$. We further show that symmetry-breaking masses, far from being
trivial, can collapse this window and drive the system to strong coupling,

- **TL;DR**: 表面活性剂通过电荷互补性实现减摩效果，异电荷表面活性剂能形成致密分子刷提供持久润滑，而同电荷或中性表面活性剂无效

From soap-covered dishes to freshly cleaned floors, surfactants can make
surfaces slippery; yet, the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood.
Here, we identify the molecular origin behind this ubiquitous phenomenon using
macroscopic tribology and surface molecular spectroscopy. We demonstrate that
reducing friction through surfactants hinges on charge complementarity:
surfactants of opposite charge to the solid surface reduce friction even at
extreme contact pressures, whereas like-charged or neutral surfactants are
ineffective. Oppositely charged surfactants self-assemble into dense and robust
molecular brushes, creating a persistent lubrication beyond the limits of
conventional mechanisms. This charge-mediated approach offers a universal and
scalable framework for friction control across length scales without
significant surface modification.

Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures offer a tunable platform for the
realization of emergent phenomena in layered electron systems. While scanning
probe microscopy techniques have proven useful for the characterization of
surface states and 2D crystals, the subsurface imaging of quantum phenomena in
multi-layer systems presents a significant challenge. In 3D heterostructures,
states that occupy different planes can simultaneously contribute to the signal
detected by the microscope probe, which complicates image analysis and
interpretation. Here we present a quantum imaging technique that offers a
glimpse into the third dimension by resolving states out of plane: it extracts
the charge density landscape of individual atomic planes inside a vdW
heterostructure, layer by layer. As a proof-of-concept, we perform
layer-resolved imaging of quantum Hall states and charge disorder in
double-layer graphene using milliKelvin microwave impedance microscopy. Here
the discrete energy spectrum of the top layer enables transmission of
microwaves through gapped states, thus opening direct access to quantum phases
in the subsurface layer. Resolving how charge is distributed out-of-plane
offers a direct probe of interlayer screening, revealing signatures of negative
quantum capacitance driven by many-body correlations. At the same time, we
extract key features of the band structure and thermodynamics, including gap
sizes. Notably, by imaging the charge distribution on different atomic planes
beneath the surface, we shed light on the roles of surface impurities and
screening on the stability of fractional quantum Hall states. We also show that
the uppermost graphene layer can serve as a top gate: This unlocks access to a
wide range of phenomena that require displacement field control, from
fractional Chern insulators in Moir\'e superlattices to correlated states in
multilayer graphene.

### Lattice vacancy migration barriers in Fe-Ni alloys, and why Ni atoms diffuse slowly: An ab initio study

- **TL;DR**: 通过第一性原理计算研究Fe-Ni合金中Fe和Ni原子的迁移性，发现Ni原子比Fe原子迁移性显著更低，这与局域晶格畸变和电子自旋极化耦合有关。

The mobility of both Fe and Ni atoms in ferromagnetic $\textrm{Fe}_x
\textrm{Ni}_{1-x}$ alloys ($0.4 \leq x \leq 0.6$) is investigated within the
framework of ab initio electronic structure calculations, using the nudged
elastic band (NEB) method to accurately quantify energetic barriers to lattice
vacancy migration. Both the atomically disordered ($A1$) fcc phase, as well as
the atomically ordered, tetragonal $\textrm{L}1_0$ phase - which is under
consideration as a material for a rare-earth-free 'gap' magnet for advanced
engineering applications - are investigated. Across an ensemble of NEB
calculations performed on supercell configurations spanning a range of
compositions and containing disordered, partially ordered, and fully ordered
structures, we find that Ni atoms are consistently significantly less mobile
than Fe atoms. Crucially, we are able to interpret these findings in terms of
the ferromagnetic alloy's underlying spin-polarised electronic structure.
Specifically, we report a coupling between the size of local lattice
distortions and the magnitude of the local electronic spin polarisation around
vacancies. This causes Fe atoms to relax into lattice vacancies, while Ni atoms
remain rigidly fixed to their original lattice positions. This effect plays a
key role in determining the reduced mobility of Ni atoms compared to that of Fe
atoms. These results shed atomic-scale insight into the longstanding
experimental observation that Ni exhibits remarkably slow atomic diffusion in
Fe-Ni alloys.

### Phase-Field Model of Freeze Casting

Directional solidification of water-based solutions has emerged as a
versatile technique for templating hierarchical porous materials. However, the
underlying mechanisms of pattern formation remain incompletely understood. In
this work, we present a detailed derivation and analysis of a quantitative
phase-field model for simulating this nonequilibrium process. The phase-field
model extends the thin-interface formulation of dilute binary alloy
solidification with anti-trapping to incorporate the highly anisotropic
energetic and kinetic properties of the partially faceted ice-water interface.
This interface is faceted in the basal plane normal to the &lt;0001&gt; directions
and atomically rough in other directions within the basal plane. On the basal
plane, the model reproduces a linear or nonlinear kinetic relationship that can
be linked to experimental measurements. In both cases, spontaneous parity
breaking of the solidification front is observed, leading to the formation of
partially faceted ice lamellae that drift laterally in one of the &lt;0001&gt;
directions. We demonstrate that the drifting velocity is controlled by the
kinetics on the basal plane and converges as the thickness of the diffuse
solid-liquid interface decreases. Furthermore, we examine the effect of the
form of the kinetic anisotropy, which is chosen here such that the inverse of
the kinetic coefficient varies linearly from a finite value in the &lt;0001&gt;
directions to zero in all other directions within the basal plane. Our results
indicate that the drifting velocity of ice lamellae is not affected by the
slope of this linear relation, and the radius and undercooling at the tip of an
ice lamella converge at relatively small slope values. Consequently, the
phase-field simulations remain quantitative with computationally tractable
choices of both the interface thickness and the slope assumed in the form of
the kinetic anisotropy.

### Interplay of Intersite Charge Transfer, Antiferromagnetism, and Strain in Barocaloric ACu$_3$Fe$_4$O$_{12}$ Quadruple Perovskites

We develop a minimal Landau theory for the concomitant intersite
charge-transfer, antiferromagnetic, and isostructural phase transitions in
ACu$_3$Fe$_4$O$_{12}$ perovskites (A = La, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb). The model
incorporates the difference in average ligand-hole occupancy between Cu and Fe,
the staggered magnetization of the Fe sublattice, volume strain, and intrinsic
thermal expansion, together with their couplings. It qualitatively reproduces
key thermodynamic properties of the ACu$_3$Fe$_4$O$_{12}$ family, including the
staggered magnetization, lattice volume, magnetic susceptibility, and the
nearly linear temperature-pressure phase boundary. The framework predicts a
pronounced elastic softening near the phase boundary, consistent with
experiments where the bulk modulus of the low-pressure, charge-transferred
antiferromagnetic phase exceeds that of the high-pressure, non-transferred
paramagnetic phase. It also yields pressure-driven isothermal entropy changes,
revealing that the intrinsic thermal expansion of the high- and low-temperature
phases significantly shapes the overall barocaloric response. These results
contrast with previous analyses of NdCu$_3$Fe$_4$O$_{12}$, where thermal
expansion was neglected in the entropy construction, and call for a
reevaluation of barocaloric effects in quadruple perovskites.

### The charge-carrier trapping effect on 1/f noise in monolayer graphene

- **TL;DR**: 本文解释了石墨烯-氮化硼异质结构中1/f噪声频率指数随载流子浓度出现多个极值的现象，归因于氮化硼中杂质对载流子的俘获效应。

The frequency exponent of 1/f noise in graphene-boron nitride
heterostructures is known to have multiple extrema in its dependence on the
charge carrier concentration. This behavior is explained in the present paper
as a result of the charge carrier trapping by impurities in the boron nitride.
A kinetic equation for the charge carriers subject to trapping and interacting
with acoustic phonons is derived. This equation is solved numerically, and the
equilibrium solutions are used to evaluate the frequency exponent according to
the quantum theory of 1/f noise. It is found that the frequency exponent does
develop several minima and maxima, provided that the trapping probability is
sufficiently wide and has a threshold with respect to the charge carrier
energy. A detailed comparison with the experimental data is made, and the
results are used to estimate the energy threshold and the trapping
cross-section.

Model Hamiltonians offer a cost-effective way to capture the key physics of
large $\pi$-conjugated systems. In this work, we combine the
Pariser--Parr--Pople (PPP) model Hamiltonian with pair Coupled Cluster Doubles
(pCCD)-based methods to study the ground- and excited-state electronic
structures of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The model Hamiltonian
implementation is done in the open-source PyBEST software package, where
numerous pCCD-type models are available. We investigate canonical Hartree--Fock
and natural pCCD-optimized orbitals to compute ground- and excited-state
properties using pCCD and its linear response extension. Their performance is
compared with configuration-interaction-based methods. Finally, we introduce a
generalized parameterization of the long-range Coulomb interaction using a
rescaled interaction prefactor to adopt the PPP parameters to the pCCD approach
and the localized nature of the pCCD orbitals. Our results demonstrate that
pCCD-based methods, combined with a suitably parametrized PPP model, provide a
reliable and scalable framework for studying the optoelectronic properties of
large $\pi$-extended systems relevant to organic electronics.

### Exploration of Hexagonal, Layered Carbides and Nitrides as Ultra-High Temperature Ceramics

Layered, hexagonal crystal structures, like zeta and eta phases, play an
important role in ultra-high temperature ceramics, often significantly
increasing toughness of carbide composites. Despite their importance open
questions remain about their structure, stability, and compositional
pervasiveness. We use high-throughput density functional theory to characterize
the thermodynamic stability and elastic constants of layered carbides and
nitrides M$_{n+1}$X$_{n}$ with $n$ = 1, 2, and 3, $M$ = Ta, Ti, Hf, Zr, Nb, Mo,
V, W, Sc, Cr, Mn and $X$ = C, N. The stacking sequences explored are inspired
by the possible use of MXenes as precursors to enable relatively low
temperature processing of high-temperature ceramics. We identified 67 new
hexagonal, layered materials with thermal stability comparable or better than
previously observed zeta phases. To assess their potential for high temperature
applications, we used machine learning and physics-based models with DFT inputs
to predict their melting temperatures and discovered several candidates on par
with the current state of the art zeta-like phases and five with predicted
melting temperatures above 2500 K. The findings expand the range of chemistries
and structures for high-temperature applications.

### Itinerant and topological excitations in a honeycomb spiral spin liquid candidate

The frustrated insulating magnet can stabilize a spiral spin liquid, arising
from cooperative fluctuations among a subextensively degenerate manifold of
spiral configurations, with ground-state wave vectors forming a continuous
contour or surface in reciprocal space. The atomic-mixing-free honeycomb
antiferromagnet GdZnPO has recently emerged as a promising spiral spin-liquid
candidate, hosting nontrivial topological excitations. Despite growing
interest, the transport and topological properties of spiral spin liquids
remain largely unexplored experimentally. Here, we report transport
measurements on high-quality, electrically insulating GdZnPO single crystals.
We observe a giant low-temperature magnetic thermal conductivity down to
$\sim$50 mK, described by $\kappa_{xx}^\mathrm{m}$ $\sim$ $\kappa_0+\kappa_1T$,
where both $\kappa_0$ and $\kappa_1$ are positive constants associated with
excitations along and off the spiral contour in reciprocal space, respectively.
This behavior parallels the magnetic specific heat, underscoring the presence
of mobile low-energy excitations intrinsic to the putative spiral spin liquid.
Furthermore, the observed positive thermal Hall effect confirms the topological
nature of at least some of these excitations. Our findings provide key insights
into the itinerant and topological properties of low-lying spin excitations in
the spiral spin-liquid candidate.

We present a relativistic third-order algebraic diagrammatic construction
(ADC(3)) approach for calculating double ionization potentials (DIPs). By
employing the exact two-component atomic mean-field (X2CAMF) Hamiltonian in
combination with a Cholesky decomposition (CD) representation of two-electron
integrals and the frozen natural spinor (FNS) framework for virtual space
truncation, we achieve a significant reduction in both memory requirements and
computational cost. The DIPs obtained using the X2CAMF Hamiltonian show
excellent agreement with results from fully relativistic four-component
calculations. We have validated the accuracy of our implementation through
comparisons with available experimental and theoretical data for inert gas
atoms and diatomic species. The effect of higher-order relativistic corrections
is also explored.

### Twisted light drives chiral excitations of interacting electrons in nanostructures with magnetic field

Twisted light (TL), a special kind of light carrying orbital angular
momentum, provides a powerful tool for driving symmetry resolved transitions in
quantum confined nanostructures. We study a realistic model where a TL pulse
excites two interacting electrons in a nanostructure under a perpendicular
magnetic field. To include image charge effects in layered systems, we use an
effective electron electron potential of the form 1/r^n. For n = 2, the system
exhibits an underlying su(1,1) dynamical symmetry, enabling analytical
solutions and a clear interpretation of selection rules, parity changes, and
angular momentum resolved absorption. We show that the bare Coulomb 1/r
interaction produces similar spectra, indicating that twisted light driven
excitations are robust against the precise interaction form. The excitation
spectrum reveals strong chiral properties: TL pulses, unlike conventional
dipolar fields, directly access interaction-driven transitions otherwise
symmetry-forbidden. In particular, TL breaks the generalized Kohn theorem,
exposing internal excitations through multi quanta orbital processes. More
broadly, our results establish TL as a sensitive probe of correlations,
symmetry, and magneto-optical dynamics in strongly interacting quantum systems,
uncovering features that remain invisible to standard infrared absorption.

### Electron-Phonon interaction and lattice thermal conductivity from metals to 2D Dirac crystals: a review

Electron--phonon (e--ph) coupling governs electrical resistivity, hot-carrier
cooling, and critically, thermal transport in solids. Recent first-principles
advances now predict e--ph limited thermal conductivity from d-band metals and
wide-band-gap semiconductors to 2D Dirac crystals without empirical parameters.
In bulk metals, ab-initio lifetimes show that phonons, though secondary, still
carry up to 40\% of the heat once e--ph scattering is included. We next survey
coupled Boltzmann frameworks, exemplified by \textsc{elphbolt}, that capture
mutual drag and ultrafast non-equilibrium in semiconductors. For 2D Dirac
crystals, mirror symmetry, carrier density, strain, and finite size rearrange
the scattering hierarchy: ZA modes dominate pristine graphene yet become the
main resistive branch in nanoribbons once symmetry is broken. At low Fermi
energies and high temperatures, the standard 3-particle decay is partially
cancelled, elevating 4-particle processes and necessitating dynamically
screened, higher-order theory. Throughout, we identify the microscopic levers
such as the electronic density of states, phonon frequency, deformation
potential, and show how doping, strain, or dielectric environment can tune
e--ph damping. We conclude by outlining open challenges such as: developing
coupled e--ph solvers, solving the full mode-to-mode Peierls--Boltzmann
equation with 4-particle terms, embedding correlated electron methods in e--ph
workflows, and leveraging higher-order e--ph coupling and symmetry breaking to
realise phononic thermal diodes and rectifiers. Solving these challenges will
elevate e--ph theory from a diagnostic tool to a predictive, parameter-free
platform that links symmetry, screening, and many-body effects to heat and
charge transport in next-generation electronic, photonic, and thermoelectric
devices.

We study the tunneling density of states (TDOS) in one-dimensional Mott
insulators at energies below the charge gap. By employing nonlinear Luttinger
liquid theory and density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we
predict that in the presence of a magnetic impurity at the boundary,
characteristic Fermi-edge singularity features can appear at subgap energies in
the TDOS near the boundary. In contrast to the Kondo effect in a metal, these
resonances are strongly asymmetric and of power-law form. The power-law
exponent is universal and determined by the spinon-Kondo effect.

Machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have shown significant promise
in predicting infrared spectra with high fidelity. However, the absence of
general-purpose MLIPs capable of handling a wide range of elements and their
combinations has limited their broader applicability. In this work, we
introduce MACE4IR, a machine learning foundation model built on the MACE
architecture and trained on 10 million geometries and corresponding
density-functional theory (DFT) energies, forces and dipole moments from the
QCML dataset. The training data encompasses approximately 80 elements and a
diverse set of molecules, including organic compounds, inorganic species, and
metal complexes. MACE4IR accurately predicts energies, forces, dipole moments,
and infrared spectra at significantly reduced computational cost compared to
DFT. By combining generality, accuracy, and efficiency, MACE4IR opens the door
to rapid and reliable infrared spectra prediction for complex systems across
chemistry, biology, and materials science.

Tellurium (Te), a two-dimensional material with pronounced structural
anisotropy, exhibits exceptional electrical and optical properties that are
highly sensitive to its crystallographic orientation. However, conventional
synthesis techniques offer limited control over the in-plane alignment of Te's
crystallographic c-axis, hindering large-scale integration. Here, we report a
novel, non-contact method to dynamically manipulate the c-axis orientation of
Te thin films using linearly polarized picosecond laser pulses. We show that
the c-axis can be omnidirectionally reoriented perpendicular to the laser
polarization, even in initially polycrystalline films. This reorientation is
fully reversible, allowing for rewritable and spatially selective control of
the c-axis orientation post-deposition. Our light-driven approach enables
programmable anisotropy in Te, opening new avenues for reconfigurable
optoelectronic and photonic devices, such as active metasurfaces and
CMOS-compatible architectures.

- **TL;DR**: 通过锂吸附在二维磁体表面诱导大Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya相互作用，在Fe3GeTe2单层中实现纳米级斯格明子，具有高能垒和长寿命特性

The Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), which originates from spin-orbit
coupling and relies on broken inversion symmetry, is recognized as a key
ingredient in forming magnetic skyrmions. However, most 2D magnets exhibit
inversion symmetry; therefore, the DMI is suppressed. Here, we propose a
strategy to induce large DMI via lithium absorption on the surface of 2D
magnets -- an experimentally feasible approach. Using first-principles and
atomistic spin simulations, we predict the formation of nanoscale skyrmions in
lithium-decorated monolayer Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ by imposing small out-of-plane
magnetic fields ($B_z$). Notably, we find very large skyrmion energy barriers
of more than 300 meV at $B_z = 0.4$ T, comparable to those observed in
ferromagnet/heavy-metal interfaces. The origin of these unique skyrmions is
attributed to the competition between strong DMI, exchange frustration, and
small magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy. We further show that the lifetimes
of metastable skyrmions exceed one hour for temperatures up to 75 K.

Kagome metals provide a material platform for probing new correlated quantum
phenomena due to the naturally incorporated linear dispersions, flat bands, and
Van Hove singularities in their electronic structures. Among these quantum
phenomena is the charge density wave (CDW), or the distortion of the lattice
structure due to the motion of correlated electrons through the material. CDWs
lower the energy of the compound, creating an energy gap that facilitates
behaviors akin to superconductivity, nonlinear transport, or other quantum
correlated phenomena. The kagome metal FeGe has been shown to host a CDW
transition at approximately 100 K, and its occurrence is strongly influenced by
the sample annealing conditions. However, a notable gap in the literature is
the lack of clear thermoelectric transport evidence for electronic structure
changes associated with this CDW transition. Here we present evidence of
electron behavior modification due to annealing disorder via thermoelectric
measurements on FeGe crystals presenting a CDW transition and those without a
CDW. The observed Nernst effect and Seebeck effect under sufficient annealing
demonstrate modified electrical transport properties resulting from induced
disorder, including a change in carrier sign and an enhancement of the Nernst
effect due to the CDW. Our results provide evidence of multiple phase
transitions, which confirms the influence of CDW on the thermal properties of
FeGe and demonstrates the suppression of CDW with sufficient disordering.

With the widespread use of self-consistent field methods, including
Hartree-Fock and Density Functional Theory, the implications of accelerating
these methods are immense. To this end, we develop a tensor hypercontraction
construction with $O(N^3)$ formal scaling that can accelerate self-consistent
field calculations. Using tensor hypercontraction, we implement an empirically
$O(N^2)$ scaling Fock matrix construction that is 2-4$\times$ faster than
existing integral-direct methods, as it avoids the repeated recalculation of
two-electron repulsion integrals. In combination with a density-difference
ansatz, our tensor hypercontraction self-consistent field implementation tests
show errors below $7.0 x 10^{-3} E_h$ for relative energies on protein systems
containing up to 3000 basis functions.

- **TL;DR**: 本文提出了一种通过调控自旋轨道耦合强度来可逆切换反铁磁体中自旋波手性的新方法，为基于手性比特的自旋电子器件开发奠定了基础。

Chirality of spin waves offers an advantageous binary carrier for data
transmission and processing with ultrafast dynamics and low power consumption.
Altermagnets possess intrinsic chirality-splitting spin waves and vanishing net
magnetization, thus emerging as ideal platforms to host chirality bits.
However, active control of the chiral states remains a key challenge for
realizing logic operations in chirality-based circuits. Here, we propose a
novel scheme for reversibly switching spin-wave chirality in altermagnets
between right- and left-handedness by tuning spin-orbit coupling (SOC)
strength. Specifically, for in-plane spin polarization, SOC hybridizes with the
altermagnetism, which induces a momentum-dependent competition. The
chirality-splitting structure of spin waves is dominated by either SOC or
altermagnetism in different Brillouin zone regions, allowing chirality
switching by altering their relative strength. An experimental design utilizing
an antiferromagnetic substrate to induce SOC and a heavy-metal stripe for
chirality detection is proposed. Our work establishes a novel pathway for
controlling spin-wave chirality in altermagnets via SOC, laying the groundwork
for developing spintronic devices utilizing switchable chiral spin waves as
dynamic information carriers.

### Ice-assisted soft-landing deposition for van der Waals integration

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种利用冰层作为缓冲的原位转移策略，用于范德华集成，实现无损伤金属-半导体界面制备，显著提升二维晶体管性能。

Van der Waals integration enables the creation of electronic and
optoelectronic devices with unprecedented performance and novel functionalities
beyond the existing material limitations. However, it is typically realized
using a physical pick-up-and-place process to minimize interfacial damages and
is hardly integrated into conventional lithography and metallization
procedures. Here we demonstrate a simple in situ transfer strategy for van der
Waals integration, in which a thin film of amorphous water ice acts as a buffer
layer to shield against the bombardment of energetic clusters during
metallization. After ice sublimation, the deposited metal film can be gently
and in situ placed onto underlying substrates, to form an atomically clean and
damage-free metal-semiconductor interface. This strategy allows ultra-clean and
non-destructive fabrication of high-quality contacts on monolayer MoS2, which
is extremely beneficial to produce a high-performance 2D field-effect
transistor with an ultra-high on/off ratio of 1010, mobility of 80 (cm2
V-1s-1), and also with reduced Fermi level pinning effect. We also demonstrate
the batch production of CVD-grown MoS2 transistor arrays with uniform
electrical characteristics. Such a gentle and ultra-clean fabrication approach
has been further extended to materials with high reactivity, such as halide
perovskites. Our method can be easily integrated with mature semiconductor
manufacturing technology and may become a generic strategy for fabricating van
der Waals contacted devices.

- **TL;DR**: Pr2Sn2O7单晶在低温下表现出量子自旋冰行为，在T_f≈0.15K时进入无序诱导的自旋冻结相，接近U(1)量子自旋液体态

We report a comprehensive bulk characterization and neutron scattering
investigation of single-crystalline Pr$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$, a magnetic pyrochlore
synthesized via a flux-growth method. Unpolarized neutron diffuse scattering
reveals the emergence of spin-ice correlations below $T \sim 1$ K, evidenced by
the development of anisotropic pinch-point features that are consistent with
quantum-spin-ice (QSI) behavior. A.C. susceptibility measurements indicate a
progressive slowing of spin dynamics in this regime, culminating in complete
spin freezing below $T_f \approx 0.15$ K. Inelastic neutron scattering at $T =
0.5$ K reveals a broad spectrum of quasi-elastic magnetic excitations, with
intensity in the low-energy range $[0, 0.2]$ meV significantly suppressed below
$T_f$. Meanwhile, an incipient (100)-type magnetic order begins to nucleate,
and a gapped excitation centered at $\hbar\omega = 0.23$ meV persists. We
further identify two distinct dynamical timescales above $T_f$, a slow
component $\tau_{\mathrm{slow}} \sim 10^{-5}$ s and a fast component
$\tau_{\mathrm{fast}} \sim 10^{-10}$ s, in quantitative agreement with
theoretical predictions for QSI systems. Taken together, these results indicate
that Pr$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$ enters a disorder-induced spin-frozen phase below $T_f$,
lying in close proximity to a $U(1)$ quantum spin liquid.

We computationally design antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 chains in fullerene
nanoribbons by introducing extra C$_{60}$ cages at one of their edges. The
resulting odd number of intermolecular bonds induces an unpaired $\pi$-electron
and hence a quantised magnetic moment in otherwise non-magnetic nanoribbons. We
further reveal the formation of an antiferromagnetic ground state upon the
linear arrangement of spin-$1/2$ C$_{60}$ cages that is insensitive to the
specific structural motifs. Compared with graphene nanoribbons, Janus fullerene
nanoribbons may offer an experimentally more accessible route to magnetic edge
states with atomic precision in low-dimensional carbon nanostructures, possibly
serving as a versatile nanoarchitecture for scalable spin-based devices and the
exploration of many-body quantum phases.

- **TL;DR**: 通过圆偏振光激光对扩反应碱化钼双层进行光学控制，实现了碱碱碱化极化和拓扑状态的准确切换与空间编程

Optical control of topology, particularly in the presence of electron
correlations, is a fascinating topic with broad scientific and technological
impact. Twisted MoTe$_2$ bilayer (tMoTe$_2$) is a newly discovered zero-field
fractional Chern insulator (FCI), exhibiting the fractionally quantized
anomalous Hall (FQAH) effect. Since the chirality of the edge states and sign
of the Chern number are determined by the underlying ferromagnetic
polarization, manipulation of ferromagnetism would realize control of the
CI/FCI states. Here, we demonstrate control and switching of ferromagnetic
polarization, and thus the CI and FCI states by circularly polarized optical
pumping in tMoTe$_2$. At low optical excitation power, we achieve on-demand
preparation of ferromagnetic polarization by optical training, i.e.,
electrically tuning the system from non-ferromagnetic to desirable
ferromagnetic states accompanied with helicity-selective optical pumping. With
increased excitation power, we further realize direct optical switching of
ferromagnetic polarization at a temperature far below the Curie temperature.
Both optical training and direct switching of ferromagnetism are most effective
near CI/FCI states, which we attribute to a gap enhanced valley polarization of
photo-injected holes. We show that the magnetization can be dynamically
switched by modulating the helicity of optical excitation. Spatially resolved
measurements further demonstrate optical writing of a ferromagnetic, and thus a
CI (or FCI) domain. Our work realizes precise optical control of a topological
quantum many-body system with potential applications in topological
spintronics, quantum memories, and creation of exotic edge states by
programmable patterning of integer and fractional QAH domains.

### Origin of Glass-like Thermal Conductivity in Crystalline TlAgTe

Ordered crystalline compounds exhibiting ultralow and glass-like thermal
conductivity are both fundamentally and technologically important, where phonon
quasi-particles dominate their heat transport. Understanding the microscopic
mechanisms that govern such unusual transport behavior is necessary to unravel
the complex interplay of crystal structure, phonons, and collective excitations
of these quasi-particles. Here, we use state-of-the-art first-principles
calculations based on quantum density functional theory to investigate the
origin of experimentally measured unusually low and glassy thermal conductivity
in semiconducting TlAgTe. Utilizing a unifying framework of anharmonic lattice
dynamics theory that combine phonon self-energy induced frequency
renormalization, particle-like Peierls ($kappa_l^P$) and wave-like coherent
($kappa_l^C$) thermal transport contributions including three and four-phonon
scattering channels, we successfully explain the experimental results both in
terms of magnitude and temperature dependence. Our analysis reveals that TlAgTe
exhibits several localized phonon modes arising from concerted rattling-like
vibration of Tl atoms, which show strong temperature dependence and enhanced
four-phonon scattering rates that are dominated by Umklapp processes,
suppressing $kappa_l^P$ to ultralow values. The ensuing strong anharmonicity
induced by local structural distortions, lone-pair electrons, and rattling-like
vibrations of the heavy cations lead to a transition from particle-like
behavior to wave-like tunneling characteristics of the phonon modes above 40
cm$^-1$, contributing significantly to $kappa_l^C$ which increases with
temperature. Our analysis uncovers important structure-property relationship,
which may be used in designing of novel materials with tunable thermal
conductivity.

The alloying elements introduced into carbon steel to enhance its mechanical
properties also diffuse into cementite (Fe$_3$C) particles, modifying their
characteristics and thereby influencing the overall performance of the steel.
This study employs density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate
cementite doped with Ni and Cr which exhibit contrasting effects. The preferred
lattice sites of impurity atoms were determined through a comparison of
calculated and experimental structural parameters. The formation mechanism of
the hyperfine magnetic field (HFF) and its correlation with atomic magnetic
moments were systematically investigated. The validity of common approximations
in M\"ossbauer spectroscopy analysis was evaluated for the cementite system.
HFF distribution functions were modeled using calculated values and compared
with experiments.

We investigate an interesting interplay of destructive interference due to
lattice geometry and band folding due to enlargement of the Brillouin zone in
generating and subsequently modifying the band topology in a twisted bilayer
$\alpha$-$T_3$ system. The pronounced degeneracy of the emergent flat band in
the dice limit of the $\alpha$-$T_3$ lattice is removed on alignment with h-BN
layers, resulting in the formation of sub-bands with varying topological
characteristics. Remarkably, while the sub-band near charge neutrality exhibits
a trivial behavior, a topologically non-degenerate singular sub-band emerges
away from charge neutrality. The topological band remains isolated from the
rest of the bands for a substantial area of the $\alpha - \theta$ plane (where
$\alpha$ and $\theta$ correspond to the hopping ratio and twist angle
respectively) while exhibiting multiple phase transitions as a function of the
aforementioned parameters via hybridization with its nearest bands. We study
the evolution of the hybrid Wannier charge center and the Chern number to
characterize the different emergent topological phases. Finally, the degree of
flatness of the topological band is studied as a function of both $\alpha$ and
$\theta$ to explicitly show the influence of quantum interference and band
folding on the width of the topological band.

### Flexible orbital torque device with ultralow switching current

Orbital torque (OT) offers a highly efficient way for electrical
magnetization manipulation. However, its potential in the emerging field of
flexible spintronics remains largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate a
flexible and robust OT device based on a mica/SrRuO3(SRO)/CoPt heterostructure.
We measure a large torque efficiency of -0.31, which originates from the
significant orbital Hall effect in the SRO layer. Leveraging the low thermal
conductivity of the mica substrate, a thermally-assisted switching mechanism is
activated, enabling an ultralow threshold current density of 9.2x109 A/m2. This
value represents a 90% reduction compared to conventional spin-torque devices
and a 52% reduction against its rigid counterpart on a SrTiO3 substrate. The
superior performances is well-maintained after 103 bending cycles, conforming
its exceptional flexibility and durability. Our work pioneers the development
of flexible OT devices, showcasing a viable path toward next-generation,
low-power wearable spintronic applications.

### Theoretical investigation of Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect in Potassium Tri-vanadium Pentantimonide

The Kagome metal Potassium Tri-vanadium Pent-antimonide can support the
quantum anomalous Hall effect theoretically. This is justified by flat bands
and Dirac points susceptible to gap opening by spin-orbit coupling or magnetic
ordering. The theoretical investigation of this quantum effect is possible
exploring strategies like magnetic proximity, and strain or electric gating
tuning. Our goal here is to explore the possibility of quantum anomalous Hall
effect with a system Hamiltonian involving nearest-neighbour and complex next
nearest-neighbour hopping, Rashba spin-orbit coupling, exchange field due to
magnetic proximity, and charge density wave. Our preliminary analysis with
these ingredients reveals that the system hosts multiple bands whose Chern
numbers values suggest weak topological characteristics-not yet quantized, but
showing signs of nontrivial Berry curvature accumulation. Upon introducing
momentum-space winding, mimicking an orbital magnetic flux, through the
momentum-dependence of the phase of the complex hopping, we find that two bands
in the multiple band system carry opposite Chern numbers, indicating the
emergence of chiral edge states and a quantized anomalous Hall effect. The rest
remain trivial, but the system as a whole is no longer topologically inert.

### Chemical control of polymorphism and ferroelectricity in PbTiO3 and SrTiO3 monolayers and bilayers

Layers of perovskites, found in 3D materials, 2D heterostructures, and
nanotubes, often distort from high symmetry to facilitate dipole polarisation
that is exploitable in many applications. Using density-functional theory
calculations, ferroelectricity in bilayers of the 2D materials PbTiO3 and
SrTiO3 is shown to be controlled by bond breakage and formation processes that
act as binary switches. These stacking-dependent processes turn on and off as a
function of relaxation from high-symmetry structures and the application of
biaxial strain, and their concerted rearrangements lead to low energy barriers
for ferroelectric polarisation switching. Structures with symmetry intermediate
between high-symmetry octahedral forms and low-symmetry ferroelectric forms are
identified, allowing the intrinsic processes associated with traditional
"ferrodistortive" and "antiferrodistortive" distortions of TiO6 octahedra to be
identified. Ferrodistortive-mode activity is shown to be generated by the
simultaneous application of two different types of curvilinear
antiferrodistortive motions. In this way, four angular variabes control
polarisation switching through the concerted making and breaking of chemical
bonds. These subltities make the polarisation sensitive to chemical-environment
and temperature effects that manipulate strain and structure, features
exploitable in futuristic devices.

### Room temperature giant magnetoresistance detection of spin hall nano-oscillator dynamics in synthetic antiferromagnetic Spin-Valve

- **TL;DR**: 基于合成反铁磁磁阵利用巨磁阻小效应的新型旋氯振荡器，充分充分解决了传统旋氯振荡器的功率限制问题

Conventional spin Hall nano-oscillators (SHNOs) face fundamental power
limitations due to the low anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR &lt; 0.3%) of
ferromagnetic layers. To address this, we developed a synthetic
antiferromagnetic spin-valve (SAF-SV) heterostructure
[Ta/NiFe/Ru/NiFe/Cu/NiFe/Hf/Pt] that enables efficient giant magnetoresistance
(GMR)-based detection of SHNO dynamics at room temperature. The NiFe/Ru/NiFe
SAF reference layer, operating in the spin-flop state, couples with the NiFe
free layer through a Cu spacer to achieve a remarkable GMR ratio of 0.568% -
exhibiting complete independence of magnetic field/current orientation.
Spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance (ST-FMR) verifies that the ferromagnetic
resonance linewidth of the free layer can be effectively modulated by dc
current through the Pt heavy metal layer, while maintaining decoupled dynamics
from the SAF layer. Thermal management via high-thermal-conductivity SiC
substrates and AlN capping layers successfully mitigates
current-shunting-induced Joule heating. Notably, stable auto-oscillation peaks
are observed at 820 mA bias current, with oscillation frequency tunable by
external magnetic field and potential dual-mode behavior at low fields. This
work establishes a new paradigm for room-temperature, high-power spintronic
oscillators, offering significant potential for neuromorphic computing and
coherent RF communication applications.

In solar cells, the absorbers are the key components for capturing solar
energy and converting photons into electron-hole pairs. The search for
high-performance absorbers with advantageous characteristics is an ongoing task
for researchers. In this work, we investigated promising and environmentally
benign Ba-based ternary chalcogenides for photovoltaic applications. The total
number of Ba-based ternary chalcogenides in the Materials Project database was
found to be 279. Materials screening based on bandgap size and stability
reduced the number of compounds to 19. The performance of an absorber depends
on the charge carrier lifetime, which is controlled by non-radiative processes
involving defects. Hence, we investigated the intrinsic defects and p-type
dopability of the compounds. We identified two Ba-based compounds, namely
\ch{BaCu2Se2} and \ch{ZrBaSe3}, as promising absorbers for single-junction and
tandem cells and investigated them in detail.

Magnon spintronics aims to harness spin waves in magnetic films for
information technologies. Color center magnetometry is a promising tool for
imaging spin waves, using electronic spins associated with atomic defects in
solid-state materials as sensors. However, two main limitations persist: the
magnetic fields required for spin-wave control detune the sensor-spin detection
frequency, and this frequency is further restricted by the color center nature.
Here, we overcome these limitations by decoupling the sensor spins from the
spin-wave control fields -- selecting color centers with intrinsic anisotropy
axes orthogonal to the film magnetization -- and by using color centers in
diamond and hexagonal boron nitride to operate at complementary frequencies. We
demonstrate isofrequency imaging of field-controlled spin waves in a magnetic
half-plane and show how intrinsic magnetic anisotropies trigger bistable spin
textures that govern spin-wave transport at device edges. Our results establish
color center magnetometry as a versatile tool for advancing spin-wave
technologies.

- **TL;DR**: 提出TRNO神经网络架构，用于温度依赖的塑性响应建模，解决了传统GRU/LSTM模型训练时间长、时间分辨率依赖和外推能力差的问题，在镁合金多晶材料上实现了高精度预测和三个数量级的加速。

Neural network surrogate models for constitutive laws in computational
mechanics have been in use for some time. In plasticity, these models often
rely on gated recurrent units (GRUs) or long short-term memory (LSTM) cells,
which excel at capturing path-dependent phenomena. However, they suffer from
long training times and time-resolution-dependent predictions that extrapolate
poorly. Moreover, most existing surrogates for macro- or mesoscopic plasticity
handle only relatively simple material behavior. To overcome these limitations,
we introduce the Temperature-Aware Recurrent Neural Operator (TRNO), a
time-resolution-independent neural architecture. We apply the TRNO to model the
temperature-dependent plastic response of polycrystalline magnesium, which
shows strong plastic anisotropy and thermal sensitivity. The TRNO achieves high
predictive accuracy and generalizes effectively across diverse loading cases,
temperatures, and time resolutions. It also outperforms conventional GRU and
LSTM models in training efficiency and predictive performance. Finally, we
demonstrate multiscale simulations with the TRNO, yielding a speedup of at
least three orders of magnitude over traditional constitutive models.

Controlling quantum matter with light offers a promising route to dynamically
tune its many-body properties, ranging from band topology to superconductivity.
However, achieving such optical control for strongly correlated electron
systems in the steady-state has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate
all-optical switching of the spin-valley degree of freedom of itinerant
ferromagnets in twisted MoTe2 homobilayers. This system uniquely features flat
valley-contrasting Chern bands and exhibits a range of strongly correlated
phases at various moir\'e lattice fillings, including Chern insulators and
ferromagnetic metals. We show that the spin-valley orientation of all of these
phases can be dynamically reversed by resonantly exciting the attractive
polaron transition with circularly-polarized light. These findings not only
constitute the first direct evidence for non-thermal switching of a
ferromagnetic spin state at zero magnetic field, but also demonstrate the
possibility of dynamical control over topological order parameter, paving the
way for all-optical generation of chiral edge modes and topological quantum
circuits.

We present direct observation of the ring-down dynamics in the rotating frame
of a resonantly driven single-mode nonlinear nanomechanical resonator. An
additional close to resonance harmonic force excites nonlinear oscillations
about the fixed point in the rotating frame. When the secondary drive is
removed, we measure decay of the in-phase and quadrature components toward this
fixed point. We show that the decay of the in-phase signal is non-exponential,
even though the vibration amplitude decays exponentially if both forces are
switched off. A minimalistic model captures these dynamics as well as the
spectrum of the vibrations excited by the additional force, relating them to
the dissipation-induced symmetry breaking of the dynamics in the rotating
frame.

Quantum geometry appears as a key factor in understanding the optical
properties of quantum materials, with the anticipation on diverging or
quantized responses near the Dirac and Weyl points. Here we investigate linear
and nonlinear optical responses -- optical conductivity and injection current
-- in a magnetic Rashba semiconductor in the mid-infrared region, with varying
the Fermi energy across the Dirac point. We reveal that the linear optical
conductivity reflects quantum metric, which remains finite irrespective of the
diminishing joint density-of-states at lower photon energy. It is also
confirmed that the magnetic injection current enhances depending on the energy
of the Fermi level relative to the Dirac point. These optical spectra are
nicely reproduced by our theoretical calculations with geometrical effects
taken into account.

### Mass-induced Coulomb drag in capacitively coupled superconducting nanowires

We investigate Coulomb drag in a system of two capacitively coupled
superconducting nanowires. In this context, drag refers to the appearance of a
stationary voltage in the passive wire in response to a current bias applied to
the active one. Quantum phase slips (QPS) in the biased wire generate voltage
fluctuations that can be transmitted to the other. Using perturbative and
semiclassical approaches, we show that when both wires are superconducting the
induced voltage vanishes due to exact cancellation of plasmon contributions. By
contrast, when the second wire is tuned below the superconductor-insulator
transition and develops a mass gap, this cancellation is lifted and a finite
drag voltage emerges. The drag coefficient exhibits a crossover from weak drag
in short wires to a maximal value set by the mutual capacitance in long wires.
A semiclassical picture of voltage pulse propagation clarifies the physical
origin of the effect: the mass term synchronizes plasmon modes and prevents
complete cancellation of induced signals. Our results establish a mechanism of
mass-induced Coulomb drag in low-dimensional superconductors and suggest new
routes for probing nonlocal transport near quantum criticality.

### Giant octupole moment in magnetic multilayers

Multipole moments serve as order parameters for characterizing higher-order
magnetic effects in momentum space, providing a framework to describe diverse
magnetic responses by extending the concept of magnetism. In this letter, we
introduce a methodology to quantitatively determine the multipole moment
contributions in anomalous Hall effect through angle-dependent anomalous Hall
current, with explicit incorporation of discrete crystal symmetries. Our
technique uniquely enables the investigation of octupole contribution in
non-periodic systems, particularly at interfaces and surfaces. Typically, in
(Ag$_{2}$Fe$_{5}$)$_{n}$ multilayers with quantum-well-engineered $k$-point
selectivity, we observe an octupole-dominated anomalous Hall effect in
conventional ferromagnetic materials, through first-principles calculations.
These results fundamentally challenge the existing theoretical understanding of
the anomalous Hall effect, showing that even the conventional contribution
arises not only from the dipole moment (net magnetization). Furthermore, we
establish practical control over the octupole contribution through two distinct
approaches: interface engineering and magnetic ordering reconfiguration,
opening new possibilities for manipulating higher-order transport effects.

Optical anisotropy is a key property for numerous photonic devices. However,
bulk anisotropic materials suitable for such applications remain relatively
scarse and are often challenging to synthesize as thin films. Additionally, the
optical losses as well as the complex structuration of anisotropic
metamaterials hinder their integrability in photonic devices. Based on
ellipsometry measurements coupled with reflectance, it is demonstrated here
that Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) SrO(SrTiO 3 ) N phases (STO-RP N ), epitaxial thin
films composed of a SrTiO 3 lattice periodically interrupted by one SrO atomic
plane every N unit cells, exhibit pronounced dichroism and birefringence over a
broad spectral range. Notably, this anisotropy is tunable by adjusting the RP
order N. In contrast to most other anisotropic materials reported in the
literature, STO-RP N thin layers can be fabricated using industry-standard
growth processes. As it can be epitaxially grown on Si and GaAs using SrTiO 3
templates, the work paves the way for their compact integration on these
photonic platforms.

### YSGAG: The Ideal Substrate for YIG in Quantum Magnonics

- **TL;DR**: 该研究开发了一种新型的YSGAG基板替代传统的GGG基板，用于生长YIG薄膜，在极低温下(30mK)实现了超低磁阻尼(α=4.29×10⁻⁵)，消除了GGG基板中顺磁性自旋导致的阻尼机制，为量子磁子学应用提供了理想平台。

Quantum magnonics leverages the quantum mechanical properties of magnons for
advancing nanoscale quantum information technologies. Ferrimagnetic yttrium
iron garnet (YIG), known for its exceptionally long magnon lifetimes, is a
cornerstone material for magnonics and is typically grown into thin films on
gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG) substrates due to near-perfect lattice
matching. However, the paramagnetic nature of GGG introduces damping mechanisms
detrimental to quantum applications at low temperatures. Here, we present a
study of magnetic damping in a 150$\,$nm-thick YIG film grown on a
500$\,\mu$m-thick yttrium scandium gallium aluminium garnet (YSGAG) substrate,
a newly developed diamagnetic alternative to GGG. Using ferromagnetic resonance
(FMR) spectroscopy at temperatures as low as 30$\,$mK, we compare the damping
characteristics of the YIG/YSGAG system with those of a conventional YIG/GGG
reference system. Our results demonstrate that the YIG/YSGAG system maintains
low magnetic damping from room temperature, with $\alpha = 4.29\times10^{-5}$,
which is the lowest value reported so far for YIG/GGG films and comparable to
the best YIG bulk material, and down to 30$\,$mK, with no significant
temperature-dependent increase in damping. In this substrate, the
low-temperature damping mechanisms associated with paramagnetic spins,
prominent in GGG, are effectively eliminated. Consequently, YSGAG serves as an
ideal substrate for YIG films in quantum magnonics and is paving the way for
the development of spin-wave-based quantum technologies.

- **TL;DR**: 开发了基于卤化物钙钛矿的微型光电人工突触，利用离子迁移实现光电流调制，具有挥发性特性，支持STDP学习规则，可用于神经形态视觉处理

Efficient visual data processing by neuromorphic networks requires volatile
artificial synapses that detect and process light inputs, ideally in the same
device. Here, we demonstrate microscale back-contacted optoelectronic halide
perovskite artificial synapses that leverage ion migration induced by a bias
voltage to modulate their photocurrent. The photocurrent changes are due to the
accumulation of mobile ions, which induces a transient electric field in the
perovskite. The photocurrent changes are volatile, decaying on the order of
seconds. The photocurrent changes can be controlled by both the applied voltage
and illumination. The symmetric device supports changing of the photocurrent
polarity, switching between inhibitory and exhibitory functioning. The
photocurrent can be updated by spike-timing-dependent plasticity
(STDP)-learning rules inspired by biology. We show with simulations how this
could be exploited as an attention mechanism in a neuromorphic detector. Our
fabrication procedure is compatible with high-density integration with CMOS and
memristive neuromorphic networks for energy-efficient visual data processing
inspired by the brain.

### 3D Strain Field Reconstruction by Inversion of Dynamical Scattering

Strain governs not only the mechanical response of materials but also their
electronic, optical, and catalytic properties. For this reason, the measurement
of the 3D strain field is crucial for a detailed understanding and for further
developments of material properties through strain engineering. However,
measuring strain variations along the electron beam direction has remained a
major challenge for (scanning-) transmission electron microscopy (S/TEM). In
this article, we present a method for 3D strain field determination using
4D-STEM. The method is based on the inversion of dynamical diffraction effects,
which occur at strain field variations along the beam direction. We test the
method against simulated data with a known ground truth and demonstrate its
application to an experimental 4D-STEM dataset from an inclined
pseudomorphically grown Al$_{0.47}$Ga$_{0.53}$N layer.

Topological materials are characterized by integer invariants that underpin
their robust quantized electronic features, as famously exemplified by the
Chern number in the integer quantum Hall effect. Yet, in most candidate
systems, the observable linked to the topological invariant is unknown,
preventing direct verification of their topological nature. Here we present a
general method to identify topological materials by analyzing the local
electronic density, $\delta \rho(\boldsymbol{r})$, and connecting it to Atiyah
Singer index theorems. This approach enables a direct measurement of the
winding number, the topological invariant of Hamiltonians with chiral symmetry,
through a contour independent dislocation pattern of $\delta
\rho(\boldsymbol{r})$ created by interference from topological defects. Our
method thus provides a direct route to detect and characterize quantum
topological states, paving the way for their use as robust and entangleable
building blocks in quantum technologies.

### A comparative nanotribological investigation on amorphous and polycrystalline forms of MoS2

- **TL;DR**: 通过纳米压痕和原子力显微镜研究，发现非晶态MoS2的耐磨性比多晶态高约4倍，且两种形态都遵循Archard磨损方程，磨损后摩擦系数显著降低。

The wear behavior of two amorphous and polycrystalline forms of MoS2 prepared
by magnetron sputtering has been characterized in a combined nanoindentation
and atomic force microscopy study. From the analysis of the depth and width of
wear tracks estimated after scratching the surfaces with a Berkovich indenter
and a loading force up to 2 mN, we conclude that both forms follow the Archard
wear equation, and the wear resistance is about four times higher on the
amorphous MoS2. Moreover, a comparison of lateral force maps on pristine and
worn areas shows a considerable reduction of friction on both forms, which is
possibly due to the significant smoothing of the surfaces caused by scratching.
With normal forces in the micro N range, the analysis is made difficult by the
fact that the linear dimensions of the wear tracks are comparable to those of
the granular structures forming the surfaces. Even if the Archard equation
could not be tested in this case, the wear resistance is considerably larger on
amorphous MoS2 also on the nanoscale. In this way, our results disclose
information on the nanotribology of MoS2 thin films in forms different from the
layered structures commonly discussed in the literature. The amorphous form
outperforms the polycrystalline one.

### Measuring high field gradients of cobalt nanomagnets in a spin-mechanical setup

Hybrid systems composed of a single nitrogen-vacancy center spin magnetically
coupled to a macroscopic mechanical resonator constitute promising platforms
for the realization of quantum information protocols and for quantum sensing
applications. The magnetic structure that mediates the interaction must ensure
high field gradients while preserving the spin and mechanical properties. We
present a spin-mechanical setup built around a cobalt nanomagnet grown with
focused electron beam-induced deposition. The magnetic structure is fully
characterized, and a maximum gradient of $170\,\mathrm{kT/m}$ is directly
measured at a spin-oscillator distance of a few hundred nanometers. Spin
coherence was preserved at the value of $20\,\mathrm{ \mu s}$ up to a gradient
of $25\,\mathrm{kT/m}$. The effect of the mechanical motion onto the spin
dynamics was observed, thus signifying the presence of spin-mechanics coupling.
Given the noninvasive nature of the nanomagnet deposition process, we foresee
the adoption of such structures in hybrid platforms with high-quality factor
resonators, in the "magnet on oscillator" configuration.

Nanoscale metallic multilayer (NMM) films are systems offering insight into
the role of interfaces in metal plasticity, deformation, and strengthening
mechanisms. Magnetron sputtering was used to fabricate the Ta-Cu NMM films with
a periodicity (equal Ta and Cu layer thickness) from 6 to 80 nm, with resulting
structure exhibiting strongly incoherent tetragonal beta-Ta and face-centered
cubic Cu phase. The high-load indentation test, TEM studies, and the rCLS model
collectively demonstrate that all NMM films predominantly undergo plastic
deformation. This plastic deformation primarily occurs within the soft Cu
layer, while the propagation of dislocations across the incoherent interface is
largely excluded.

The mechanical properties of a solid, which relate its deformation to
external applied forces, are key factors in enabling or disabling the use of an
otherwise optimal material in any application, strongly influencing also its
service lifetime. Intrinsic crystal deformation mechanisms, investigated
experimentally on single crystals with low dislocation densities, have been
studied theoretically through atomistic simulations, mainly focusing on
lattice-induced instabilities. Here, instead, we employ density functional
theory and a thermodynamic analysis to probe and analyze the way in which the
electronic charge of crystalline solids (Cu, Al and diamond) responds to
uniaxial strain and affects their mechanical properties. Indeed, despite the
very simple nature of our models, and in the presence of minimal atomic
displacements, we find that the stress strain curves of Cu and Al deviate from
a simple linear elastic behavior. Within a thermodynamics perspective, the
features of such curves can be interpreted in terms of first and second order
phase transitions. Within a thermodynamics perspective, the features of such
curves can be interpreted in terms of first and second order phase transitions,
which originate from Van-Hove singularities of the electronic density of states
crossing the Fermi level and electron redistribution within the solid,
respectively.

Elemental tellurium (Te) is a compelling van der Waals material due to its
interesting chiral crystal structure and predicted topological properties.
Here, we report the fabrication and comprehensive quantum transport study of
devices based on Te flakes with varying thicknesses. We demonstrate a hole
mobility reaching up to 1000 cm2/V.s in a 17 nm thick flake at 30 Kelvin. At
deep cryogenic temperatures (&lt; 50mK), the transport characteristics transition
from Coulomb blockade in the low carrier density regime to pronounced
Fabry-P\'erot (F-P) interference at higher densities. Notably, the visibility
of these F-P oscillations is significantly enhanced in the thinner flake
device. The application of a magnetic field reveals a clear Zeeman splitting of
the conductance peaks. The rich variety of quantum transport phenomena observed
underscores the high quality of our thin Te flakes and establishes them as a
promising platform for exploring novel physics and device concepts, such as
topological superconductivity and low-power spintronic applications.

DFT is a widely used method to compute properties of materials, which are

studies. In this article, we present the Materials Cloud Three-Dimensional
Structure Database (MC3D), an online database of computed three-dimensional
(3D) inorganic crystal structures. Close to a million experimentally reported
structures were imported from the COD, ICSD and MPDS databases; these were
parsed and filtered to yield a collection of 72589 unique and stoichiometric
structures, of which 95% are, to date, classified as experimentally known. The
geometries of structures with up to 64 atoms were then optimized using
density-functional theory (DFT) with automated workflows and curated input
protocols. The procedure was repeated for different functionals (and
computational protocols), with the latest version (MC3D PBEsol-v2) comprising
32013 unique structures. All versions of the MC3D are made available on the
Materials Cloud portal, which provides a graphical interface to explore and
download the data. The database includes the full provenance graph of all the
calculations driven by the automated workflows, thus establishing full
reproducibility of the results and more-than-FAIR procedures.
