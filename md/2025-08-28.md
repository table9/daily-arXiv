- **TL;DR**: 结合Boltz-2结构预测模型与绝对自由能扰动(FEP)协议，开发了Boltz-ABFE流程，可在无实验晶体结构情况下准确估算小分子结合亲和力

Free energy perturbation (FEP) is considered the gold-standard simulation
method for estimating small molecule binding affinity, a quantity of vital
importance to drug discovery. The accuracy of FEP critically depends on an
accurate model of the protein-ligand complex as an initial condition for the
underlying molecular dynamics simulation. This requirement has limited the
impact of FEP in earlier stages of the discovery process, where appropriate
experimental crystal structures are rarely available. The latest generation of
structure prediction models, such as Boltz-2, promise to overcome this
limitation by predicting protein-ligand complex structures. In this work, we
combine Boltz-2 with our own absolute FEP protocol to build Boltz-ABFE, a
robust pipeline for estimating the absolute binding free energies (ABFE) in the
absence of experimental crystal structures. We investigate the quality of the
structures predicted by Boltz-2, propose automated approaches to improve
structures for use in molecular dynamics simulations, and demonstrate the
effectiveness of the Boltz-ABFE pipeline for four protein targets from the FEP+
benchmark set. Demonstrating the feasibility of absolute FEP simulations
without experimental crystal structures, Boltz-ABFE significantly expands the
domain of applicability of FEP, paving the way towards accelerated early-stage
drug discovery via accurate, structure-based affinity estimation.

### Current-Driven Symmetry Breaking and Spin-Orbit Polarization in Chiral Wires

- **TL;DR**: 通过实时含时密度泛函理论模拟发现，在临界电流阈值以上，手性分子系统中的时间反演对称性约束被动态解除，导致显著的spin和轨道极化，即使哈密顿量保持对称。spin和轨道角动量的出现与线性动量的损失相关，表明角自由度重新分布是手性系统中电流驱动对称性降低的内在结果。

The spin dynamics of electrons in chiral molecular systems remains a topic of
intense interest, particularly regarding whether geometric chirality inherently
induces spin polarization or simply modulates spin transport. In this work, we
employ ab initio real-time time-dependent density functional theory (rt-TDDFT)
to directly simulate the interplay between charge current, spin, and orbital.
This real-time tracking goes beyond perturbative treatments, and we analyze how
nonequilibrium currents effectively lift the symmetry constraints of
screw-rotation and time-reversal symmetry. We find that above a critical
current threshold, time-reversal symmetry constraints are dynamically lifted --
leading to pronounced spin and orbital polarizations, even when the underlying
Hamiltonian remains symmetric. Notably, the emergence of spin and orbital
angular momenta dynamics correlates with a loss of translational (linear)
momentum, suggesting a redistribution of angular degrees of freedom as an
intrinsic consequence of a current-driven symmetry lowering in a chiral system,
with implications for chirality-induced spin selectivity and spintronic device
design.

### Universal Generalization Theory for Physical Intuitions from Small Artificial Neural Networks

- **TL;DR**: 该论文提出了一种基于变分原理的机制，通过小型人工神经网络从少量相似样本中学习，模拟人类大脑快速形成物理直觉的过程，成功解决了最速降线和量子谐振子问题。

Physical intuitions are native functions from human brains, yet the
understanding of how physical intuitions are formulated has remained elusive.
In this Letter, we propose a mechanism that simulates how human brain can
quickly develop intuitional understandings from limited observations.
Conceiving a training algorithm adapted from the well-known variational
principle in physics, small artificial neural networks can possess strong
physical intuitions that master the problems of brachistochrone and quantum
harmonic oscillators, by learning from a few highly similar samples. Our
simulations suggest that the variational principle is the governing mechanism
for artificial physical intuitions. A unified generalization theory is derived,
which hinges upon a variational operation on the Euler-Lagrange equation. Our
theory also rationalizes that there is a threshold of artificial neural network
size below which satisfactory physical intuitions are not possible. Our work
offers insights into how strong physical intuition can be formulated as humans
or as artificial intelligences.

### Tunable quantum anomalous Hall effect in fullerene monolayers

- **TL;DR**: 通过设计自定制分子建筑块实现可调控的量子异常震测效应，以C26富勒烯蜂窝格子为例，获得了丰富的相图和不同的谦息数

Nearly four decades after its theoretical prediction, the search for material
realizations of quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) remains a highly active
field of research. Many materials have been predicted to exhibit quantum
anomalous Hall (QAH) physics under feasible conditions but the experimental
verification remains widely elusive. In this work, we propose an alternative
approach towards QAH materials design by engineering customized molecular
building blocks. We demonstrate this ansatz for a two-dimensional (2D)
honeycomb lattice of C26 fullerenes, which exhibits a ferromagnetic ground
state and thus breaks time-reversal symmetry. The molecular system is found to
be highly tunable with respect to its magnetic degrees of freedom and applied
strain, giving rise to a rich phase diagram with Chern numbers C= +/-2, +/-1,
0. Our proposal offers a versatile platform to realize tunable QAH physics
under accessible conditions and provides an experimentally feasible approach
for chemical synthesis of molecular networks with QAHE.

### Non-Hermitian edge burst of sound

- **TL;DR**: 本文在经典波超材料中演示了非厄米边缘爆发现象，揭示了非厄米能带拓扑与虚能隙闭合之间的复杂相互作用，展示了在不同边界条件下边缘爆发的多种表现形式。

Non-Hermitian band topology can give rise to phenomena with no counterparts
in Hermitian systems. A well-known example is the non-Hermitian skin effect
(NHSE), where Bloch eigenstates localize at a boundary, induced by a nontrivial
spectrum winding number. In contrast, recent studies on lossy non-Hermitian
lattices have uncovered an unexpected boundary-localized loss probability-a
phenomenon that requires not only non-Hermitian band topology but also the
closure of the imaginary (dissipative) gap. Here, we demonstrate the
non-Hermitian edge burst in a classical-wave metamaterial: a lossy
nonreciprocal acoustic crystal. We show that, when the imaginary gap remains
closed, edge bursts can occur at the right boundary, left boundary, or both
boundaries simultaneously, all under the same non-Hermitian band topology; the
latter scenario is known as a bipolar edge burst. The occurrence of each
scenario depends on the number and location of the imaginary gap closure points
in the eigenenergy spectra. These findings generalize the concept of edge burst
from quantum to classical wave systems, establish it as an intrinsic material
property, and enrich the physics of the complex interplay between non-Hermitian
band topology and other physical properties in non-Hermitian systems.

### Nambu Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics II:Reduction of a complex system to a simple one

- **TL;DR**: 提出了基于Nambu动力学的非平衡热力学框架(NNET)，用多个哈密顿量和熵来描述远离平衡态的复杂非线性系统，但该理论目前仅为形式证明。

Non-equilibrium thermodynamics far from equilibrium is investigated in terms
of a generalized ``Nambu dynamics'' (termed Nambu non-equilibrium
thermodynamics (NNET)); NNET consists of Nambu dynamics with multiple
Hamiltonians and an entropy causing dissipation.
  It is shown that a general complex non-linear non-equilibrium system far from
equilibrium can be reduced to a simple NNET, on the basis of an existence
proposition of NNET. This proposition is, however, proved only formally, so
that there may exist various obstacles to destroy it.
  Non-equilibrium thermodynamics studied in this article is quite general,
including the case in which the product of dynamical and affinity forces forms
a higher-order mixed tensor.

### Two-dimensional electronic spectra from trajectory-based dynamics: pure-state Ehrenfest and spin-mapping approaches

- **TL;DR**: 本文开发了基于轨迹的非绝热动力学方法用于模拟二维电子光谱，提出了改进的纯态Ehrenfest方法和自旋映射方法，并在Frenkel激子模型中验证了准确性。

Two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) provides a detailed picture of
electronically nonadiabatic dynamics that can be interpreted with the aid of
simulations. Here, we develop and contrast trajectory-based nonadiabatic
dynamics approaches for simulating 2DES spectra. First, we argue that an
improved pure-state Ehrenfest approach can be constructed by decomposing the
initial coherence into a sum of equatorial pure states that contain equal
contributions from the states in the coherence. We then use this framework to
show how one can obtain a more accurate, but computationally more expensive,
approximation to the third-order 2DES response function by replacing Ehrenfest
dynamics with spin mapping during the pump-probe delay time. We end by
comparing and contrasting the accuracy of these methods in reproducing the
exact linear, pump-probe, and 2DES spectra of two Frenkel exciton models: a
coupled dimer system and the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex.

### Non-Hermitian Josephson junctions with four Majorana zero modes

Josephson junctions formed by finite-length topological superconductors host
four Majorana zero modes when the phase difference between the superconductors
is $\varphi=\pi$ and their length is larger than the Majorana localization
length. While this picture is understood in terms of a Hermitian description of
isolated junctions, unavoidable transport conditions due to coupling to
reservoirs make them open and ground for non-Hermitian effects that still
remain largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate the impact of
non-Hermiticity on Josephson junctions hosting four Majorana zero modes when
they are coupled to normal leads. We demonstrate that, depending on whether
inner or outer Majorana zero modes are subjected to non-Hermiticity, Andreev
exceptional points can form between lowest (higher energy) Andreev bound states
connected by stable zero real energy lines. We further find that the Andreev
exceptional points give rise to strong local and nonlocal spectral weights,
thus providing a way for their identification via, e.g., conductance
measurements. Our findings unveil non-Hermiticity for designing non-Hermitian
topological phases and for operating Andreev bound states in Josephson
junctions hosting Majorana zero modes.

### No-go theorem for single time-reversal invariant symmetry-protected Dirac fermions in 3+1d

- **TL;DR**: 通过异常匹配方法推导出新的阻塞定理，证明在时间反转不变的3+1维粒子模型中，不可能存在单独的低能量对称性保护的迪克拉粒子，必须以多重态或细调的形式存在。

We employ a general method, known as anomaly-matching, to derive new no-go
theorems of fermionic lattice models. For our main result, we show that
time-reversal invariant 3+1d lattice systems (such as Dirac and Weyl
semimetals) can never admit a lone low-energy symmetry-protected Dirac fermion
(or node), i.e., it must always come in higher muliplets or be fine-tuned. This
theorem holds for both non-interacting and interacting systems as long as the
electromagnetic $U(1)_{V,{\rm UV}}$ symmetry is a normal subgroup of the
microscopic symmetry group $G_{\mathrm{UV}}$; a condition that is ubiquitous in
physical $U(1)_{V,{\rm UV}}$ preserving lattice models. To show that our
theorems are tight, we also explore both well-known and new systems that are
converses of the no-go theorem, obtained by forfeiting certain assumptions such
as a broken time-reversal symmetry (magnetic Weyl semimetal), a non-compact
non-on-site $U(1)$ (almost local Dirac node model), no-symmetry protection
(fine-tuned Dirac semimetal), or multiple low-energy Dirac nodes (time-reversal
invariant Weyl and Dirac semimetals). We will also explicitly demonstrate that,
while this theorem strictly prohibits single time-reversal invariant
symmetry-protected Dirac node, it does allow for other odd numbers of Dirac
nodes under certain circumstances, such as three Dirac nodes in the
Fu-Kane-Mele diamond lattice model. This is akin to the Nielsen-Ninomiya
theorem for an odd number of differently-charged chiral fermions, whose lattice
realizations are allowed if certain anomaly cancellation conditions are met.

### Quantification of mobile ions in perovskite solar cells with thermally activated ion current measurements

- **TL;DR**: 提出一种基于温度激活移动移子流(TAIC)的新形式化技术，能在单次温度扫描中完整描述锌镜矿太阳能电池中移动移子的密度、扩散系数和激活能，并区分不同移子种类

Mobile ions play a key role in the degradation of perovskite solar cells,
making their quantification essential for enhancing device stability. Various
electrical measurements have been applied to characterize mobile ions. However,
discerning between different ionic migration processes can be difficult.
Furthermore, multiple measurements at different temperatures are usually
required to probe different ions and their activation energies. Here, we
demonstrate a new characterization technique based on measuring the thermally
activated ion current (TAIC) of perovskite solar cells. The method reveals
density, diffusion coefficient, and activation energy of mobile ions within a
single temperature sweep and offers an intuitive way to distinguish mobile ion
species. We apply the TAIC technique to quantify mobile ions of MAPbI3 and
triple-cation perovskite solar cells. We find a higher activation energy and a
lower diffusion coefficient in the triple-cation devices. TAIC measurements are
a simple yet powerful tool to better understand ion migration in perovskite
solar cells.

- **TL;DR**: 本文提出了一种从原子层面系统构建分子液体统计场模型的策略，通过引入分子粗粒化模型作为中间步骤，弥合了粒子基和场论建模技术之间的鸿沟。

Multiscale computer simulations facilitate the efficient exploration of large
spatiotemporal scales in chemical and physical systems. However, molecular
simulations predominantly rely on particle-based representations, which become
computationally prohibitive when applied beyond the molecular scale.
Field-theoretical simulations have emerged as an alternative to overcome these
limitations. Despite their applicability in mesoscopic simulations, these
approaches are typically derived from top-down principles, leaving a gap in the
bottom-up derivation of field-theoretical models for targeted molecular
systems. This work presents a systematic strategy for constructing statistical
field models for molecular liquids from the atomistic level, marking a critical
step toward bridging particle-based and field-theoretical modeling techniques.
By introducing molecular coarse-grained models as an intermediate step, this
hierarchical approach reduces the complexity of the
atomistic-to-field-theoretical transformation while preserving important
microscopic structural correlations. We systematically derive field-theoretical
models in reciprocal space for both canonical and grand canonical ensembles
using the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation. By incorporating additional
fields for both positive and negative Fourier modes, our generalized mode
theory extends the applicability of bottom-up field-theoretical models beyond
the conventional Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation, which can be limited to
positive Fourier modes. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient perturbative
approach for approximating Fourier modes of molecular interactions, reducing
computational cost and allowing for integrating complex molecular interactions
into the field-theoretic description.

### Observation of topological switch between Weyl semimetal and third-order topological insulator phases

- **TL;DR**: 通过巩体电路元质材施加三维旋旋耦合，实现了韦尔半金属与三阶拓扑绝缘体的共存和可控转换

Weyl semimetals and higher-order topological insulators represent two
fundamental yet distinct classes of topological matter. While both have been
extensively studied in classical-wave systems, their coexistence and
controllable transition within a single platform remain largely unexplored.
Meanwhile, implementing three-dimensional spin-orbit couplings, which is
crucial for realizing a broad class of higher-dimensional topological phases,
continues to pose significant experimental challenges. Here, we experimentally
realize three-dimensional spin-orbit couplings and demonstrate that tuning the
dimerized spin-orbit coupling strength enables both the coexistence of and a
controllable switch between Weyl semimetal and third-order topological
insulator phases. By engineering a three-dimensional circuit metamaterial, we
synthesize the required spin-orbit interactions and observe hallmark signatures
of both phases: frequency spectroscopy reveals the Fermi arcs, while local
density of states measurements identify the topological corner modes.
Interestingly, the corner mode degeneracy doubles compared to that in the
canonical Benalcazar-Bernevig-Hughes model, signaling an enriched topological
structure. Our study establishes a fundamental connection between two
paradigmatic topological phases and paves the way for further exploring
spin-orbit-coupling induced exotic higher-dimensional topological phases.

### Phase transition properties via partition function zeros: The Blume-Capel ferromagnet revisited

- **TL;DR**: 该研究扩展了配分函数零点分析方法，证明无需在精确相变点进行模拟即可获得可靠的临界指数估计，且小系统尺寸已足够，提高了计算效率并减少碳足迹。

Since the landmark work of Lee and Yang, locating the zeros of the partition
function in the complex magnetic-field plane has become a powerful method for
studying phase transitions. Fisher later extended this approach to complex
temperatures, and subsequent generalizations introduced other control
parameters, such as the crystal field. In previous works [Moueddene et al, J.
Stat. Mech. (2024) 023206; Phys. Rev. E 110, 064144 (2024)] we applied this
framework to the two- and three-dimensional Blume-Capel model -- a system with
a rich phase structure where a second-order critical line meets a first-order
line at a tricritical point. We showed that the scaling of Lee-Yang, Fisher,
and crystal-field zeros yields accurate critical exponents even for modest
lattice sizes. In the present study, we extend this analysis and demonstrate
that simulations need not be performed exactly at the nominal transition point
to obtain reliable exponent estimates. Strikingly, small system sizes are
sufficient, which not only improves methodological efficiency but also advances
the broader goal of reducing the carbon footprint of large-scale computational
studies.

### Ultrafast Solvent Dynamics Drives the Formation of the Hydrated Electron in Photoexcited Water

The photophysics and photochemistry associated with irradiating UV light in
liquid water is central to numerous physical, chemical and biological
processes. One of the key events involved in this process is the generation of
the hydrated electron. Despite long study from both experimental and
theoretical fronts, a unified understanding of the underlying mechanisms
associated with the generation of the solvated electron have remained elusive.
Here, using excited-state molecular dynamics simulations of condensed phase
photoexcited liquid water, we unravel the key sequence of chemical events
leading to the creation of the hydrated electron on the excited state. The
process begins through the excitation of electrons localized mostly on specific
topological defects in water's hydrogen network which is subsequently followed
by two main reaction pathways. The first, leads to the creation of a hydrogen
atom culminating in non-radiative decay back to the ground-state within 100
femtoseconds. The second involves a proton coupled electron transfer, giving
rise to the formation of the hydronium ion, hydroxyl radical and the hydrated
excess electron on the excited-state. This process is facilitated by ultrafast
coupled rotational and translational motions of water molecules leading to the
formation of water mediated ion-radical pairs in the network. These species can
survive on the picosecond timescale and ultimately modulate the emission of
visible photons. All in all, our findings provide fresh perspectives into the
interpretation of several independent time-dependent spectroscopies measured
over the last decades, paving the way for new directions on both theoretical
and experimental fronts.

### Theory of superconductivity and mass enhancement near CDW critical point based on Bethe-Salpeter equation method: application to cuprates

In recent years, charge-channel orders in strongly correlated metals have
attracted great attention. Famous examples are the electronic nematic orders in
cuprates and iron-based superconductors, and Star-of-David order in kagome
metals. Critical phenomena and unconventional superconductivity arising from
fluctuations of such charge-channel orders are central issues today; however,
the essential role is played by the vertex corrections, which are the many-body
effects that are dropped in conventional mean-field type approximations. To
solve this difficulty, in this study, we propose the Bethe-Salpeter equation
theory to evaluate electron-electron interactions in two dimensional Hubbard
models. This method satisfies the criteria of the Baym-Kadanoff conserving
approximation. Here, we find that an attractive interaction in the charge
channel emerges from the Aslamazov-Larkin vertex corrections that describe the
interference processes among spin fluctuations. Applying this method to the
square-lattice Hubbard model, we reveal that the cooperation of attractive
charge fluctuations and repulsive spin fluctuations yields high-$T_c$ $d$-wave
superconductivity together with enhanced effective mass. These results
naturally explain the phase diagram of cuprate superconductors, where
strong-coupling $d$-wave superconductivity appears near the charge-order
quantum critical point. The theory can also be applied to multi-orbital Hubbard
models, like iron-based and nickelate superconductors, suggesting broad
potential for future applications.

### Thermodynamics in a split Hilbert space: Quantum impurity at the edge of a one-dimensional superconductor

We present a thermodynamic description of a single magnetic impurity at the
edge of a superconducting wire. The impurity exhibits four phases
$\unicode{x2014}$ Kondo, Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) I and II, and local moment
$\unicode{x2014}$ a phase diagram richer than in the gapless case, contrary to
the expectation that the effects of impurities in gapped hosts are less
consequential. We derive the impurity contribution to free energy $F_{\rm
imp}(T)$ and entropy in each phase: in Kondo phase, the entropy flows
monotonically from $\ln 2$ (UV) to 0 (IR) with critical exponents same as that
of the conventional Kondo model; in YSR phases, thermal activation of a midgap
bound state produces entropy overshoots above $\ln 2$, saturating to $\ln 2$ at
high $T$ and approaching either 0 or $\ln 2$ at low $T$ depending on whether
impurity is screened or not; in the local-moment phase the impurity remains
effectively decoupled, with entropy near $\ln 2$, with some
intermediate-temperature features that progressively fade as $\delta \to 0$.
These behaviors, including the entropy overshoots in the YSR and local-moment
phases, stem from a splitting of the Hilbert space into distinct excitation
towers: one in the Kondo phase, two in YSR~I, and three in YSR~II and the
local-moment phase. Resolving these tower structures and thereby going beyond
conventional TBA yields closed-form analytic expressions for the impurity
contribution to the free energy and entropy across the entire phase diagram.

magnetism. We show that this difficulty arises from an overestimate of the $4f$
charge asphericity, and thus the magnetic anisotropy energy, due to the
inadequacy of single Slater-determinant representations. We propose an
effective solution by combining constrained DFT+U with crystal field theory and
a systematic many-body correction to the charge asphericity. We confirm the
validity of this combination on TbV$_6$Sn$_6$ and TbCo$_5$, and then show how
the many-body correction adjusts the calculated magnetic anisotropy energy of
SmCo$_5$ to match experiment. Our method is an efficient DFT-based approach to
address light-rare-earth magnetism.

Many materials with novel or exotic properties are highly sensitive to
environmental factors such as air, solvents, and heat, which complicates device
fabrication and limits their potential applications. Here, we present a
universal submicron fabrication method for mesoscopic devices using a
dry-transfer technique, tailored specifically for sensitive materials. This
approach utilizes PMMA masks, combined with a water-dissoluble coating as a
sacrificial layer, to ensure that sensitive materials are processed without
exposure to harmful environmental conditions. The entire fabrication process is
carried out in a glove box, employing dry techniques that avoid air, solvents,
and heat exposure, culminating in an encapsulation step. We demonstrate the
utility of this method by fabricating and characterizing K2Cr3As3 and WTe2
devices, a one- and two-dimensional material, respectively. The results show
that our technique preserves the integrity of the materials, provides excellent
contact interfaces, and is broadly applicable to a range of sensitive
materials.

We investigate thermal spin pumping in gadolinium iron garnet (GdIG),
focusing on the mode-resolved dynamics of antiferromagnetic magnons and their
impact on spin and heat transport. Antiferromagnets support both right-handed
and left-handed magnon modes, which we treat as positive and negative frequency
branches, analogous to electrons and holes in semiconductors. Using a
two-sublattice model with a minimal exchange interaction scheme, we derive the
temperature-dependent spin-wave spectrum and evaluate the associated thermal
spin pumping coefficients. Our analysis reveals that the competition between
left- and right-handed modes gives rise to a compensation temperature, where
the net thermally generated spin current vanishes. Importantly, we show that
this compensation point does not necessarily coincide with the crossing of
magnon dispersion branches. While previous research considers a detailed
microscopic model including all magnetic sublattices and exchange couplings,
our approach demonstrates that key features of mode-resolved spin transport can
be captured by a simplified and analytically transparent model. These findings
advance the understanding of spin-caloritronic phenomena in ferrimagnets and
offer new perspectives for the design of chiral magnon-based spintronic
devices.

### Rank-reduced equation-of-motion coupled cluster formalism with full inclusion of triple excitations

- **TL;DR**: 提出了基于Tucker分解的降秩方程运动耦合簇理论，包含完整的单、双、三重激发，将计算复杂度从N^7降至N^6，存储需求降至N^4。

In this work we describe the rank-reduced variant of the equation-of-motion
coupled cluster theory with complete inclusion of single, double, and triple
excitations. The advantage of the proposed formalism in comparison with the
canonical theory stems from the application of Tucker decomposition format to
the ground- and excited-states triply-excited amplitudes tensors. By exploiting
the linear scaling of the dimension of the decomposed amplitudes with respect
to the system size $N$, one can reduce the computational cost of the method to
the level of $N^6$ and storage requirements to $N^4$. While in practice the
proposed rank-reduced formalism introduces an error, we show that it is several
times smaller than the inherent error of the parent theory with the proposed
default settings for a wide range of problems. Higher level of accuracy can be
achieved by increasing the value of a single parameter present in this
formulation, recovering the canonical method in an appropriate limit. We
illustrate the accuracy and performance of the proposed method by calculations
for a group of molecules with excited states of different character -- from
dominated by single excitations with respect to the reference determinant to
states with moderate and large contribution of double and higher excitations.
We report calculations of potential energy curves and related spectroscopic
parameters for the first four singlet excited states of magnesium dimer, as
well as the potential energy curve for the excited state of charge-transfer
character in the NH$_3$-F$_2$ complex as a function of intermolecular
separation.

High and medium-entropy superconductors with significant intrinsic disorder
are a fascinating class of superconductors. Their combination of robust
structural integrity, superior mechanical properties, and exceptional
irradiation tolerance makes them promising candidates for use in advanced
superconducting technologies. Herein, we present a comprehensive theoretical
and experimental investigation on the superconductivity of equiatomic
entropy-stabilized Nb0.25Ta0.25Ti0.25Zr0.25. The material shows bulk
superconductivity (transition temperature = 8K) with a high upper critical
field of 11.94T. Interestingly, both the electronic band structure and specific
heat data point toward unconventional multiband superconductivity. Our ab
initio calculations reveal Dirac-like band crossings close to the Fermi level,
with certain degeneracies persisting even in the presence of spin-orbit
coupling, suggesting a possible interplay between topological electronic states
and the observed unconventional superconductivity. Remarkably, the critical
current density exceeds the benchmark of 10^5 A/cm2, surpassing all previously
reported as-cast entropy-stabilized superconductors. This high critical current
density is likely attributed to strong flux pinning at the grain boundaries,
facilitated by extreme intrinsic lattice distortion. Taken together, the
demonstrated dynamical stability, excellent metallicity, potential to host
unconventional superconductivity, and exceptionally high critical current
density highlight the potential of entropy-stabilized alloys as a platform for
exploring the confluence of disorder, topology, and unconventional
superconductivity.

### Thermodynamics in a split Hilbert space: Quantum impurity at the edge of the Heisenberg chain

We study the isotropic spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg chain with a single
edge-coupled impurity of arbitrary exchange strength $J$. The model exhibits
four impurity phases. For antiferromagnetic couplings ($J&gt;0$): a \textit{Kondo
phase} at weak $J$, where the impurity is screened by many-body excitations and
the impurity entropy decreases monotonically from $\ln 2$ at $T \to \infty$ to
$0$ at $T\to 0$; and an \textit{antiferromagnetic bound-mode (ABM) phase} at
strong $J$, where the impurity screened by an exponentially localized bound
mode drives $S_{\mathrm{imp}}(T)$ nonmonotonically, with undershoots below zero
at intermediate temperatures, while tending to $\ln 2$ as $T \to \infty$ and to
$0$ as $T \to 0$. For ferromagnetic couplings ($J&lt;0$): a local-moment (LM)
phase at weak $|J|$, where the impurity remains unscreened with
$S_{\mathrm{imp}}\to \ln 2$ as $T \to 0$ but exhibits shallow undershoots at
intermediate scales; and a \textit{ferromagnetic bound-mode (FBM) phase} at
strong $|J|$, where $S_{\mathrm{imp}}=\ln 2$ in both UV and IR limits, yet
develops an intermediate-temperature undershoot. We provide an analytic
understanding of this behavior, showing that the undershoots originate from the
fractionalization of the Hilbert space into several towers of states: for
antiferromagnetic couplings this occurs only at strong $J$, driven by
boundary-localized bound modes, while for ferromagnetic couplings undershoots
occur for all $J&lt;0$, becoming deeper with increasing $|J|$ and vanishing as
$J\to 0^{-}$. These bound modes screen the impurity. Incorporating the bound
modes and edge states provides a complete analytic understanding of this
phenomenon and yields closed expressions for the impurity contribution to free
energy and entropy that are valid across all phases. These are checked and
found to be in excellent agreement with tensor network and exact
diagonalization results.

### Band gap formation theory: An alternative to the Bragg diffraction model

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种不依赖布拉格衍射的能带隙形成新理论，将晶格视为离散采样点，基于奈奎斯特频率概念解释能带隙的起源

The band gap, a key concept in solid-state physics, is traditionally
explained by the Bragg diffraction of electron waves in the periodic potential
of a crystal. Although widely accepted, this framework raises fundamental
issues in one-dimensional systems, where Bragg diffraction-which requires
multidirectional wave interactions-reduces to simple interference, thus failing
to explain band gap formation. In this paper, we introduce an alternative
theory that does not rely on Bragg reflection. Using the Schr\"{o}dinger
equation for Bloch waves, we consider the crystal lattice as a discrete set of
observation points. This discreteness introduces a sampling-like constraint
analogous to the Nyquist frequency in signal processing. We show that when the
electron wavenumber changes under a periodic potential while the lattice
spacing remains fixed, a band gap naturally emerges as a sampling effect. By
constructing an energy diagram that incorporates this effect, we reveal that
the band gap originates from both the wavenumber change and the role of the
lattice as discrete samplers, leading the energy curve to exhibit translational
and mirror symmetries with respect to the Nyquist wavenumber. This approach
provides a novel, physically grounded explanation of band gap formation and can
be naturally extended to higher dimensions.

### Intrinsic nonlinear valley Nernst effect

- **TL;DR**: 研究本质非线性谷Nernst效应，通过二阶热电响应在纵向温度梯度下产生横向谷流，与非线性谷霍尔导率通过Mott关系相关联，并在值散模型和第一原理计算中验证。

We investigate the intrinsic nonlinear valley Nernst effect, which induces a
transverse valley current via a second-order thermoelectric response to a
longitudinal temperature gradient. The effect arises from the Berry connection
polarizability dipole of valley electrons and is permissible in both
inversion-symmetric and inversion-asymmetric materials. We demonstrate that the
response tensor is connected to the intrinsic nonlinear valley Hall
conductivity through a generalized Mott relation, with the two being directly
proportional at low temperatures, scaled by the Lorenz number. We elucidate the
symmetry constraints governing this effect and develop a theory for its
nonlocal measurement, revealing a nonlocal second-harmonic signal with a
distinct $\rho^2$ scaling. This signal comprises two scaling terms, with their
ratio corresponding to the square of the thermopower normalized by the Lorenz
number. Key characteristics are demonstrated using a tilted Dirac model and
first-principles calculations on bilayer WTe$_2$. Possible extrinsic
contributions and alternative experimental detection methods, e.g., by valley
pumping and by nonreciprocal directional dichroism, are discussed. These
findings underscore the significance of band quantum geometry on electron
dynamics and establish a theoretical foundation for nonlinear valley
caloritronics.

### Kinetic pathways of coesite densification from metadynamics

- **TL;DR**: 研究使用元动力学和机器学习势能函数模拟了柯石英在高压下的结构转变，发现了三种不同的转变路径，包括非晶化、形成缺陷八面体相和形成复杂致密相，并预测了温度对转变路径选择的影响。

We study compression of coesite to pressures above 35 GPa, substantially
beyond the equilibrium transition pressure to octahedral phases (8 GPa to
stishovite). Experiments at room temperature showed that up to 30 GPa the
metastable coesite structure develops only minor displacive changes (coesite-II
and coesite-III) while the Si atoms remain 4-coordinated. Beyond 30 GPa,
reconstructive transformations start, following different pathways from the
complex structure of coesite. Besides amorphization, two different crystalline
outcomes were observed. One is formation of defective high-pressure octahedral
phases (Hu et al., 2015) and another one is formation of unusual and complex
dense phases coesite-IV and coesite-V with Si atoms in 4-fold, 5-fold and
6-fold coordination (Bykova et al., 2018). Capturing these structural
transformations computationally represents a challenge. Here we show that
employing metadynamics with Si-O coordination number and volume as generic
collective variables in combination with a machine-learning based ACE potential
(Erhard et al., 2024), one naturally observes all three mentioned pathways,
resulting in the phases observed experimentally. We describe the atomistic
mechanisms along the transformation pathways. While the pathway to coesite-IV
is simpler, the transformation to octahedral phases involves two steps: first,
a hcp sublattice of O atoms is formed where Si atoms occupy octahedral
positions but the octahedra chains do not form a regular pattern. In the second
step, the Si atoms order and the chains develop a more regular arrangement. We
predict that the pathway to coesite-IV is preferred at room temperature, while
at 600 K the formation of octahedral phases is more likely.

- **TL;DR**: 通过机器学习筛选和第一性原理计算，在热力学稳定的氢化物中发现了22种临界温度超过4.2K的超导体，最高达到17K

Hydrides are considered to be one of the most promising families of compounds
for achieving high temperature superconductivity. However, there are very few
experimental reports of ambient-pressure hydride superconductivity, and the
superconducting critical temperatures ($T_{\rm c}$) are typically less than 10
K. At the same time several hydrides have been predicted to exhibit
superconductivity around 100 K at ambient pressure but in thermodynamically
unfavorable phases. In this work we aim at assessing the superconducting
properties of thermodynamically stable hydride superconductors at room pressure
by investigating the GNoME material database, which has been recently released
and includes thousands of thermodynamically stable hydrides. To scan this large
material space we have adopted a multi stage approach which combines machine
learning for a fast initial evaluation and cutting edge ab initio methods to
obtain a reliable estimation of $T_{\rm c}$. Ultimately we have identified 22
cubic thermodynamically stable hydrides with $T_{\rm c}$ above 4.2 K and reach
a maximum $T_{\rm c}$ of 17 K. While these critical temperatures are modest in
comparison to some recent predictions, the systems where they are found, being
stable, are likely to be experimentally accessible and of potential
technological relevance.

We compute the disorder averaged dc conductance in the non-equilibrium steady
state that sets in between a longer-range Kitaev chain and a metallic lead
connected to an external reservoir, as a function of the system parameters and
of the disorder strength. From our results, we map out the phase diagram of the
disordered chain for different types of disorder and discuss the corresponding
effects of the interplay between topology and disorder in the system. To do so,
we set up a combined analytical and numerical approach, which is potentially
amenable of straightforward generalizations to other disordered topological
systems.

### Giant Anomalous Hall Conductivity and Gilbert Damping in Room-temperature Ferromagnetic Half-Heusler Alloys PtMnBi

Half-Heusler alloys have emerged as promising candidates for novel spintronic
applications due to their exceptional properties including the high Curie
temperature (TC) above room temperature and large anomalous Hall conductivity
(AHC). In this work, we systematically study the magnetic and electronic
properties of PtMnBi in {\alpha}-, \{beta}-, and {\gamma}-phase using
first-principles calculations and Monte Carlo simulations. The three phases are
found to be ferromagnetic metals. In particular, the {\alpha}-phase PtMnBi
shows a high TC up to 802 K and a relatively large Gilbert damping of 0.085.
Additionally, the {\gamma}-phase PtMnBi possesses a non-negligible AHC,
reaching 203 {\Omega}-1cm-1 at the Fermi level. To evaluate its potential in
nanoscale devices, we further investigate the {\alpha}-phase PtMnBi thin films.
The Gilbert dampings of {\alpha}-phase PtMnBi thin films varies with film
thickness and we attribute this variation to the distinct band structures at
the high-symmetry point {\Gamma}, which arise from differences in film
thickness. Moreover, the 1-layer (1L) {\alpha}-phase thin film retains robust
ferromagnetism (TC = 688 K) and shows enhanced Gilbert damping (0.14) and AHC
(1116 {\Omega}-1cm-1) compared to the bulk. Intriguingly, under a 2% in-plane
biaxial compressive strain, the Gilbert damping of 1L {\alpha}-phase PtMnBi
thin film increases to 0.17 and the AHC reaches 2386 {\Omega}-1cm-1. The
coexistence of giant Gilbert damping and large AHC makes {\alpha}-phase PtMnBi
a compelling platform for practical spintronic applications, and highlights the
potential of half-Heusler alloys in spintronic device design.

Optical manipulation of quantum matter offers a non-contact, high-precision
and fast control. Fractional Chern ferromagnet states in moir\'e superlattices
are promising for topological quantum computing, but an effective optical
control protocol has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate robust optical
switching of integer and fractional Chern ferromagnets in twisted MoTe2
bilayers using circularly polarized light. Highly efficient optical
manipulation of spin orientations in the topological ferromagnet regime is
realized at zero field using a pump light power as low as 28 nanowatts per
square micrometer. Utilizing this optically induced transition, we also
demonstrate magnetic bistate cycling and spatially resolved writing of
ferromagnetic domain walls. This work establishes a reliable and efficient
optical control scheme for moir\'e Chern ferromagnets, paving the way for
dissipationless spintronics and quantized Chern junction devices.

A diagrammatic formalism for lattices of 1/2 is developed. It is based on an
unconstrained mapping between spin and Majorana operators. This allows the use
of standard tools of diagrammatic quantum many-body theory without requiring
projections. We derive, in particular, the Feynman rules for the expansion
around a color-preserving mean-field theory. We then present the numerical
results obtained by computing the corrections up to second order for the
Heisenberg model in one and two dimensions, showing that perturbative
corrections are not only numerically important, but also qualitatively improve
the results of mean-field theory. These results pave the way for the use of
Majorana diagrammatic tools in theoretical and numerical studies of quantum
spin systems.

Magnetic systems are highly promising for implementing probabilistic
computing paradigms because of the fitting energy scales and conspicuous
non-linearities. While conventional binary probabilistic computing has been
realized, implementing more advantageous multi-value probabilistic computing
(MPC) remains a challenge. Here, we report the realization of MPC by leveraging
the thermally activated diffusion of magnetic skyrmions through an effectively
non-flat energy landscape defined by a discrete number of pinning sites. The
time-averaged spatial distribution of the diffusing skyrmions directly realizes
a discrete probability distribution, which is tunable by current-generated
spin-orbit torques, and can be quantified by non-perturbative electrical
measurements. Even a very straightforward implementation with global tuning,
already allows us to demonstrate the softmax computation - a core function in
artificial intelligence. As a key advance, we demonstrate invertible logic
without the need to create a network of probabilistic devices, offering major
scalability advantages. Our proof of concept can be generalized to multiple
skyrmions and can accommodate multiple locally tunable inputs and outputs using
magnetic tunnel junctions, potentially enabling the representation of highly
complex distribution functions.

Engineering and controlling heat and spin transport on the femtosecond
time-scale in spintronic devices opens up new ways to manipulate magnetization
with unprecedented speed. Yet the underlying reversal mechanisms remain poorly
understood due to the challenges of probing ultrafast, non-equilibrium spin
dynamics. In this study, we demonstrate that typical magneto-optical
experiments can be leveraged to access the time evolution of the spin
accumulation generated within a magnetic multilayer following an ultrafast
laser excitation. Furthermore, our analysis shows that the final magnetic state
of the free-layer in a spin-valve is mainly dictated by the ultrafast dynamics
of the reference-layer magnetization. Our results disentangle magnetization and
spin transport dynamics within a multilayer stack and identify demagnetization
and remagnetization-driven spin accumulation as the key mechanism for
all-optical switching. These findings establish new design principles for
ultrafast spintronic devices based on tailored spin current engineering.

- **TL;DR**: 本文研究了层状拓扑反铁磁体EuAl2Si2中的平面霍尔效应(PHE)和各向异性磁阻，发现其主要由经典轨道磁阻和场抑制自旋涨落主导，而非贝里曲率，这为探索自旋构型与能带拓扑的耦合提供了新视角。

In topological materials, the planar Hall effect (PHE) is often regarded as a
hallmark of profound quantum phenomena-most notably the Adler-Bell-Jackiw
chiral anomaly and Berry curvature-rendering it an indispensable tool for
deciphering the topological essence of emergent phases. In this study, we delve
into the PHE and anisotropic magnetoresistance in the recently discovered
layered topological antiferromagnet EuAl2Si2. Our analysis of the robust PHE
signal (~3.8 {\mu}{\Omega} cm at 2 K and 8 T) unveils a distinct interplay of
mechanisms. While Berry curvature plays a minor role, the dominant
contributions stem from classical orbital MR in the field-induced ferromagnetic
state and field-suppressed spin fluctuations in the paramagnetic regime. These
insights not only position EuAl2Si2-with its highly tunable spin texture-as an
exemplary system for probing the intricate coupling between spin configurations
and band topology in magnetotransport but also pave the way for designing novel
materials with tailored PHE responses, highlighting significant application
prospects in quantum sensing, spintronic devices, and topologically protected
electronic systems.

- **TL;DR**: 使用机器学习原子间势分子动力学模拟研究氢在非晶和晶体IGZO中的扩散行为，揭示了不同相态中氢扩散机制及其对氧化物薄膜晶体管性能稳定性的影响

Understanding hydrogen diffusion is critical for improving the reliability
and performance of oxide thin-film transistors (TFTs), where hydrogen plays a
key role in carrier modulation and bias instability. In this work, we
investigate hydrogen diffusion in amorphous IGZO ($a$-IGZO) and $c$-axis
aligned crystalline IGZO (CAAC-IGZO) using machine learning interatomic
potential molecular dynamics (MLIP-MD) simulations. We construct accurate
phase-specific MLIPs by fine-tuning SevenNet-0, a universal pretrained MLIP,
and validate the models against a comprehensive dataset covering
hydrogen-related configurations and diffusion environments. Hydrogen
diffusivity is evaluated over 650--1700 K, revealing enhanced mobility above
750 K in $a$-IGZO due to the glassy matrix, while diffusion at lower
temperatures is constrained by the rigid network. Arrhenius extrapolation of
the diffusivity indicates that hydrogen in $a$-IGZO can reach the
channel/insulator interface within $10^{4}$ seconds at 300--400 K, likely
contributing to negative bias stress-induced device degradation. Trajectory
analysis reveals that long-range diffusion in $a$-IGZO is enabled by a
combination of hydrogen hopping and flipping mechanisms. In CAAC-IGZO, hydrogen
exhibits high in-plane diffusivity but severely restricted out-of-plane
transport due to a high energy barrier along the $c$-axis. This limited
vertical diffusion in CAAC-IGZO suggests minimal impact on bias instability.
This work bridges the atomic-level hydrogen transport mechanism and
device-level performance in oxide TFTs by leveraging large-scale MLIP-MD
simulations.

### Regularized Micromagnetic Theory for Bloch Points

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种正则化微磁模型，通过将磁化向量约束在S3球面上来允许磁化强度变化但不超出阈值，从而解决了布洛赫点(BP)处有效场发散的问题。

Magnetic singularities known as Bloch points (BPs) present a fundamental
challenge for micromagnetic theory, which is based on the assumption of a fixed
magnetization vector length. Due to the divergence of the effective field at a
BP, classical micromagnetics fails to adequately describe BP dynamics. To
address this issue, we propose a regularized micromagnetic model in which the
magnetization vector can vary in length but not exceed a threshold value. More
specifically, the magnetization is treated as an order parameter constrained to
a S3-sphere. This constraint respects fundamental properties of local spin
expectation values in quantum systems. We derive the corresponding regularized
Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation and the analogue of the Thiele equation
describing the steady motion of spin textures under various external stimuli.
We demonstrate the applicability of our theory by modeling the dynamics of
several magnetic textures containing BPs, including domain walls in nanowires,
chiral bobbers, and magnetic dipolar strings. The presented results extend
micromagnetic theory by incorporating a regularized description of BP dynamics.

- **TL;DR**: 本文研究了在石墨烯/Ir(110)衬底上生长的单层MnBr$_2$结构，系统表征了其生长形貌、外延关系和超摩尔纹图案的形成机制。

Single-layer MnBr$_2$ is grown on graphene (Gr) supported by Ir(110) and
investigated using low-energy electron diffraction, scanning tunneling
microscopy, and spectroscopy. The structure and epitaxial relationship with the
substrate are systematically characterized. The growth morphology strongly
depends on the growth temperature, evolving from fractal to dendritic and
eventually to compact dendritic skeletal islands, reflecting changes in the
underlying surface diffusion processes. MnBr$_2$ on Gr/Ir(110) constitutes a
three-lattice system, giving rise to a super-moir\'e pattern --a moir\'e of
moir\'es. Due to the involvement of lattices of differing symmetries and the
partial electronic transparency of Gr, a "virtual" moir\'e formed by MnBr$_2$
and Ir(110) contributes to the super-moir\'e formation. Ab initio calculations
play a crucial role in understanding the complexity of super-moir\'e. Moreover,
the pronounced variation in the apparent height with tunneling conditions for
the magnetic insulator is explained based on the measured electronic structure.

We show that periodically time-modulating the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
interaction (DMI) in a two-dimensional magnon insulator may induce a
topological phase transition that results in the presence of robust edge modes.
To this end, we study a square lattice of spins interacting via an XXZ
Heisenberg model with a ferromagnetic longitudinal coupling and
antiferromagnetic transverse coupling, as well as the aforementioned
time-modulated DMI. The topologically protected edge states of this system are
composed of coherent superpositions of single-magnon excitations and two magnon
bound states. Furthermore, we show that the chirality of the edge states can be
controlled by adjusting the relative phase for the drive on the DMI associated
with nearest neighbors in the x and y directions.

Light emissive nanostructures were prepared from boron nitride nanotubes
(BNNTs) filled with inorganic lead halide perovskites. BNNTs provide a platform
for facile synthesis of high aspect ratio perovskite quantum wires having
color-tunable, highly polarized emission. BNNTs form a flexible and robust
protective shell around individual nanowires, that mitigate degradation during
post-processing for practical applications, while allowing to exploit the
emission of the perovskite nanowires due to its optical transparency. The wire
diameter can be tuned by choosing appropriate BNNT hosts, giving easy access to
the strongly quantum confined diameter range. The individual encapsulated
quantum wires can be used as building blocks for nanoscale photonic devices,
and to create large-scale flexible assemblies.

Physical reservoir computing is a promising framework for efficient
neuromorphic in and near-sensor computing applications. Here, we demonstrate a
multimodal optoelectronic reservoir network based on halide perovskite
semiconductor devices, capable of processing both voltage and light inputs. The
devices consist of micrometer-sized, asymmetric crossbars covered with a MAPbI3
perovskite film. In a network, we simulate the performance by transforming
MNIST images and videos based on the NMNIST dataset using 4-bit inputs and
training linear readout layers for classification. We demonstrate multimodal
networks capable of processing both voltage and light inputs, reaching mean
accuracies up to 95.3 p/m 0.1% and 87.8 p/m 0.1% for image and video
classification, respectively. We observed only minor deterioration due to
measurement noise. The networks significantly outperformed linear classifier
references, by 3.1% for images and 14.6% for video. We show that longer
retention times benefit classification accuracy for single-mode networks, and
give guidelines for choosing optimal experimental parameters. Moreover, the
microscale device architecture lends itself well to further downscaling in
high-density sensor arrays, making the devices ideal for efficient in-sensor
computing.

Two-dimensional (2D) silicates have emerged as a promising class of ultrathin
materials, expanding the landscape of 2D systems beyond conventional van der
Waals crystals. Their unique crystal chemistries and structural anisotropies
make them attractive for applications ranging from sensors and flexoelectric
devices to drug delivery and catalysis. To unlock their full potential, it is
critical to understand their thickness-dependent mechanical properties within
the family of 2D silicates. In this study, we investigate the nanomechanical
and frictional behaviors of two structurally distinct natural silicates:
layered Biotite and chain-structured Rhodonite. Using atomic force microscopy
(AFM), we found that Rhodonite exhibits nearly ten times higher adhesion force
and modulus response compared to Biotite. Despite this, Biotite demonstrates
superior frictional performance, with ultrathin (5 nm) flakes showing a
remarkably low coefficient of friction ($\sim 0.6 \times 10^{-3}$) versus
Rhodonite ($\sim 3.6 \times 10^{-3}$). To further elucidate interlayer
adhesion, density functional theory (DFT) calculations with Hubbard correction
were employed. These findings offer valuable insights into the design and
selection of 2D silicates for advanced mechanical and tribological
applications.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究通过掺杂MnTe晶体引入缺陷，发现缺陷驱动的对称性破缺可以产生准交变磁性材料，并实现可调控的反常霍尔电导率

Governed by specific symmetries, altermagnetism is an emerging field in
condensed matter physics, characterized by unique spin-splitting of the bands
in the momentum space co-existing with the compensated magnetization as in
antiferromagnets. As crystals can have tailored and unintended defects, it is
important to gain insights on how altermagnets are affected by the
defects-driven symmetry-breaking which, in turn, can build promising
perspectives on potential applications. In this study, considering the widely
investigated MnTe as a prototype altermagnet, defects are introduced through
substitutional doping to create a large configuration space of spin space
groups. With the aid of density functional theory calculations, symmetry
analysis, and model studies in this configuration space, we demonstrate the
generic presence of spin-split of the antiferromagnetic bands in the momentum
space. This is indicative of a wider class of quasi-altermagnetic materials,
augmenting the set of ideal altermagnetic systems. Furthermore, we show that
while pristine MnTe does not show anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) with
out-of-plane magnetization, suitable doping can be carried out to obtain finite
and varied AHC. Our predictions of quasi-altermagnetism and doping driven
tailored AHC have the potential to open up as-yet-unexplored directions in this
developing field.
