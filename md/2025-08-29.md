### Qubit parametrization of the variational discrete action theory for the multiorbital Hubbard model
- **arXiv**: [2508.20111](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20111)  ·  [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.20111.pdf)
- **Title (EN)**: Qubit parametrization of the variational discrete action theory for the multiorbital Hubbard model
- **Authors**: Zhengqian Cheng, Chris A. Marianetti
- **Categories**: cond-mat.str-el
- **TL;DR**: 本文开发了变分离散作用理论(VDAT)在N=3时的量子比特参数化方法，用于处理多轨道Hubbard模型，能够高效捕获Mott和Hund物理，成本与Gutzwiller近似相当。

The variational discrete action theory (VDAT) at \mathcal{N}=3 is a potent
tool for accurately capturing Mott and Hund physics at zero temperature in
d=\infty at a cost comparable to the Gutzwiller approximation, which is
recovered by VDAT at \mathcal{N}=2. Here we develop a qubit parametrization of
the gauge constrained algorithm of VDAT at \mathcal{N}=3 for the multiorbital
Hubbard model with general density-density interactions. The qubit
parametrization yields an explicit variational trial energy, and the
variational parameters consist of the momentum density distribution, the shape
of a reference fermi surface, and the pure state of a qubit system with
dimension of the local Hilbert space. To illustrate the power of the qubit
parametrization, we solve for the ground state properties of the multiorbital
Hubbard model with Hund coupling for local orbital number N_{orb}=2-7. A Taylor
series expansion of the partially optimized trial energy is used to explain how
the Hund's coupling changes the order of the Mott transition. For the case of
the SU(2N_{orb}) Hubbard model, an explicit approach for computing the critical
U_{c} for the Mott transition is provided, yielding an analytical expression
for U_{c} in the large N_{orb} limit. Additionally, we provide an analytical
solution for the ground state properties of the single band Hubbard model with
a special density of states. Finally, we demonstrate that the qubit
parametrization can also be applied to \mathcal{N}=2, for both G-type and
B-type variants, where the G-type yields an identical expression to the slave
spin mean-field theory. The qubit parametrization not only improves the
efficiency and transparency of VDAT at \mathcal{N}=3, but also provides the key
advances for the construction of a one-body reduced density matrix functional
capable of capturing Mott and Hund physics.

- **TL;DR**: 提出一种结合自一致聚类分析(SCA)和Lippmann-Schwinger方程的降级模型，用于快速多级均化循环微结构板材料，计算效率提高超1个数量级。

This work introduces a reduced-order model for plate structures with periodic
micro-structures by coupling self-consistent clustering analysis (SCA) with the
Lippmann-Schwinger equation, enabling rapid multiscale homogenisation of
heterogeneous plates. A plate-specific SCA scheme is derived for the first time
and features two key elements: (i) an offline-online strategy that combines
Green's functions with k-means data compression, and (ii) an online
self-consistent update that exploits the weak sensitivity of the reference
medium. The framework handles both linear and nonlinear problems in classical
plate theory and first-order shear deformation theory, and its performance is
verified on linear isotropic perforated plates and woven composites, as well as
on non-linear elasto-plastic perforated plates and woven composites with
damage. Across all cases the proposed model matches the accuracy of FFT-based
direct numerical simulation while reducing computational cost by over an order
of magnitude.

### MicroLad: 2D-to-3D Microstructure Reconstruction and Generation via Latent Diffusion and Score Distillation

- **Authors**: Kang-Hyun Lee, Faez Ahmed

- **TL;DR**: MicroLad是一个潜在扩散框架，能够从2D数据重建3D微观结构，并通过评分蒸馏采样实现逆向控制的2D到3D微观结构生成。

A major obstacle to establishing reliable structure-property (SP) linkages in
materials engineering is the scarcity of diverse 3D microstructure datasets.
Limited dataset availability and insufficient control over the analysis and
design space restrict the variety of achievable microstructure morphologies,
hindering progress in solving the inverse (property-to-structure) design
problem. To address these challenges, we introduce MicroLad, a latent diffusion
framework specifically designed for reconstructing 3D microstructures from 2D
data. Trained on 2D images and employing multi-plane denoising diffusion
sampling in the latent space, the framework reliably generates stable and
coherent 3D volumes that remain statistically consistent with the original
data. While this reconstruction capability enables dimensionality expansion
(2D-to-3D) for generating statistically equivalent 3D samples from 2D data,
effective exploration of microstructure design requires methods to guide the
generation process toward specific objectives. To achieve this, MicroLad
integrates score distillation sampling (SDS), which combines a differentiable
score loss with microstructural descriptor-matching and property-alignment
terms. This approach updates encoded 2D slices of the 3D volume in the latent
space, enabling robust inverse-controlled 2D-to-3D microstructure generation.
Consequently, the method facilitates exploration of an expanded 3D
microstructure analysis and design space in terms of both microstructural
descriptors and material properties.

### Spectral density characteristics of self-organized structuring in phase-synchronized oscillator ensembles

- **TL;DR**: 该论文通过模拟相位同步振荡器群体，展示了自组织湍流中涌现结构的普适标度律，为天体物理和地球物理等离子体中的耦合系统结构提供了新的自组织原理解释。

Self-organized turbulence represents a way for structuring in nature to arise
through sheer complexity rather than through linear instability theory.
Simulating ensembles of oscillators that undergo phase synchronization through
a propagating Kuramoto-interaction field, we present the spectral
characteristics of spontaneous, self-organized structures of locally coupled
oscillators. We demonstrate that the spectral density of emergent structures
can exhibit universal scaling laws, in line with expectations from nature,
indicating that observed statistical outcomes of complex physical interactions
can be achieved through a more general principle of self-organization. We
suggest that spontaneously generated structures may provide nuance to the
reigning reductionist explanations for the observed structure in coupled
systems of astrophysical and geophysical plasmas.

### Revealing degradation mechanisms in YSZ ceramics through machine learning-guided aging and multiscale characterization

- **TL;DR**: 机器学习引导的水热老化与多尺度表征相结合，揭示了3mol% YSZ的两阶段降解机制，发现晶界化学而非晶粒尺寸是低温降解的关键驱动因素

The long-term performance of yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) based energy
and biomedical devices is compromised by low-temperature degradation (LTD).
This study presents a novel integration of machine learning-guided hydrothermal
aging with multiscale characterization to resolve a two-stage degradation
mechanism in 3 mol% YSZ. Stage 1 (0 to 30 hrs) features initial surface relief
building, which transitions to partial refinement and relief distribution in
stage 2 (30 to 60 hrs), alongside a rise in monoclinic phase content. The
evolving microstructure increases triple-junction grain boundary density, and
these junctions act as degradation hotspots, where vacancy exchange and water
access accelerate the transformation. These findings highlight grain boundary
chemistry, rather than grain size alone, as a key LTD driver, suggesting
boundary engineering as a strategy to enhance YSZ stability for energy,
biomedical, and thermal applications.

### Machine learning topological defect formation

- **Authors**: Fumika Suzuki, Ying Wai Li, Wojciech H. Zurek
- **Categories**: cond-mat.stat-mech, gr-qc, hep-ph, hep-th, physics.comp-ph
- **TL;DR**: 机器学习可以基于临界点附近短时间间隔内序参量的时间演化，预测相变过程中拓扑缺陷的最终构型，且这种可预测性遵循Kibble-Zurek机制确定的幂律标度规律。

According to the Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM), the density of topological
defects created during a second-order phase transition is determined by the
correlation length at the freeze-out time. This suggests that the final
configuration of topological defects in such a transition is largely
established during the impulse regime, soon after the critical point is
traversed. Motivated by this, we conjecture that machine learning (ML) can
predict the final configuration of topological defects based on the time
evolution of the order parameter over a short interval in the vicinity of the
critical point, well before the order parameter settles into the emerging new
minima resulting from spontaneous symmetry breaking. Furthermore, we show that
the predictability of ML also follows the power law scaling dictated by KZM. We
demonstrate these using a Recurrent Neural Network.

### Distinct Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Thermoelectric Transport Across Superconducting Transition

- **TL;DR**: 超导体热运输松尝动力学研究，在临界温度Tc附近发现线性和非线性两种不同的松尝模式，体现超导相变过程中传输机制的基本变化

We investigate the relaxation dynamics of heat transport in superconductors,
shaped by the interplay of diffusion, nonlinearity, and magnetic fields.
Focusing on regimes near the critical temperature Tc, we analyze two classes of
relaxation diffusion equations that give rise to qualitatively distinct
dynamics, which we denote as Type I (linear) and Type II (nonlinear). Type I
relaxation, characteristic of the normal state above Tc, results in a steady
and spatially uniform heat current governed by linear diffusion. By contrast,
Type II relaxation, relevant below Tc, exhibits non steady dynamics marked by
pronounced spatial inhomogeneities and an evolving pattern, in which an
initially localized hot spot propagates transiently through the system. The
striking distinction between these regimes underscores a fundamental shift in
transport mechanisms across the superconducting phase transition and provides
experimentally relevant predictions in light of emerging techniques for probing
local dissipation.

### Nonlinear Hall effect in topological Dirac semimetals in parallel magnetic field

- **TL;DR**: 本文计算了二维拓扑狄拉克半金属在面内磁场作用下的二次谐波响应，通过量子动力学方程分析Berry曲率偶极子和场致项对电流密度的贡献，并提出了在多种拓扑材料中通过反常霍尔电阻率测量来验证理论的方法。

We compute the second-harmonic response of two-dimensional topological Dirac
semimetals subjected to an external in-plane magnetic field. The quantum
kinetic equation for the Wigner distribution function is derived and then
solved to evaluate the second-order electric-field contributions to the current
density. Both the Berry curvature dipole and the field-induced terms in the
current are analyzed across a broad range of model parameters. We propose that
our theory can be tested experimentally by measuring the dependence of the
anomalous Hall resistivity on the in-plane magnetic field in the surface states
of the topological insulator SnTe, in WTe$_2$ and WSe$_2$ monolayers, as well
as in the Kondo lattice material Ce$_3$Bi$_4$Pd$_3$ at very low temperatures.

### Lee-Yang-zero ratio method in three-dimensional Ising model

- **Categories**: cond-mat.stat-mech, hep-lat, hep-ph, physics.comp-ph
- **TL;DR**: 通过蒙特卡洛模拟三维Ising模型，应用Lee-Yang-zero ratio (LYZR)方法确定临界点位置，证明该方法与传统的Binder累积量方法同样有效，且能更好地抑制有限尺寸标度破坏和非线性效应。

By performing Monte Carlo simulations of the three-dimensional Ising model,
we apply the recently proposed Lee-Yang-zero ratio (LYZR) method to determine
the location of the critical point in this model. We demonstrate that the LYZR
method is as powerful as the conventional Binder-cumulant method in studying
the critical point, while the LYZR method has the advantage of suppressing the
violation of the finite-size scaling and non-linearity near the critical point.
We also achieve a precise determination of the values of the LYZRs at the
critical point, which are universal numbers. In addition, we propose an
alternative method that uses only a single Lee-Yang zero and show that it is
also useful for the search for the critical point.

### Towards Balanced Description of Ground and Excited States with Transcorrelated F12 Methods

- **Title (EN)**: Towards Balanced Description of Ground and Excited States with Transcorrelated F12 Methods
- **Authors**: Conner Masteran, Bimal Gaudel, Edward F. Valeev
- **Categories**: physics.chem-ph
- **TL;DR**: 本文提出了一种改进的F12显式相关方法，通过将F12相关器扩展到占据和价带未占据状态，实现对基态和激发态的更均衡描述，减少基集要求并提高计算效果。

By correlating only the 1-particle states occupied in the reference
determinant the conventional design for the single-reference R12/F12
explicitly-correlated methods biases them towards the ground state description
thereby making treatment of response properties of the ground state, and
energies and other properties of excited states less robust. While the use of
multireference methods and/or extensions of the standard SP projected geminals
can achieve a more balanced description of ground and excited states, here we
show that the same goals can be achieved by extending the action of F12
correlators to the occupied and valence unoccupied 1-particle states only. This
design choice reflects the strong dependence of the optimal correlation
lengthscale of the F12 ansatz on the orbital energies/structure, and helps to
avoid the unphysical raising of the ground state energy if the F12 geminals are
used to correlate pairs of all 1-particle states. The improved F12 geminal
design is incorporated into the unitary transcorrelation framework to produce a
unitary 2-body Hamiltonian that incorporates the short-range dynamical
correlation physics for ground and low-energy excited states in a balanced
manner. This explicitly-correlated effective Hamiltonian reduces the basis set
requirement on the correlation-consistent basis cardinal number by 1 or more
over the uncorrelated counterpart for the description of the ground state
coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) energies, the vertical excitation
energies and harmonic vibrational frequencies of equation-of-motion CCSD
low-energy excited states.

### $su(2)$ symmetry of XX spin chains

- **TL;DR**: 通过调整均匀横向磁场，非均匀开放XX自旋链具有双重简并性和精确的su(2)对称性

We show that, after suitably adjusting a uniform transverse magnetic field,
the generic inhomogeneous open XX spin chain has a two-fold degeneracy, and an
exact $su(2)$ symmetry whose "inhomogeneous" generators depend on coefficients
that can be explicitly computed for models associated with discrete orthogonal
polynomials.

### Extended s-wave altermagnets

- **TL;DR**: 提出扩展s波交变磁体(sAMs)作为一类完全带隙、自旋补偿且具有自旋极化能带的磁性状态，通过谷交换对称性形成，展现出各向同性自旋分裂和自旋选择性传输特性

We propose extended s-wave altermagnets (sAMs) as a class of magnetic states
which are fully gapped, spin-compensated, and feature spin-polarized bands.
sAMs are formed through valley-exchange symmetries, which act as momentum-space
translations beyond standard crystallographic spin-group classifications. Using
an effective two-valley model, we demonstrate that sAMs exhibit isotropic spin
splitting, enable spin-selective transport in tailored heterostructures, and
give rise to descendant pair density wave order. From a microscopic sAM minimal
model, we develop the guiding principles to identify sAMs in quantum magnets.

### Altermagnetic Shastry-Sutherland fullerene networks

- **TL;DR**: 利用C40富勒烯分子构建了Shastry-Sutherland晶格中的交替磁性单层，展示了d波自旋极化能带分裂和手性分裂磁子带，可通过双轴应变调控多种量子相

Molecular building blocks provide a versatile platform for realising exotic
quantum phases. Using charge neutral, pure carbon fullerene molecules as an
example, we design altermagnetic C$_{40}$ monolayers in Shastry-Sutherland
lattice. The resonance structure of one unpaired electron leads to an effective
spin-1/2 cluster on both long sides of the molecule, which, after rotating into
a 2D rutile-like crystal structure, forms altermagnetic ground state. We show
$d$-wave spitting of the spin-polarised electronic band structure and strong
chiral-split magnon bands. Most interestingly, the effective spin-1/2 clusters
form the Shastry-Sutherland model with a rich phase diagram including
altermagenti, quantum spin liquid, plaquette, and dimer phases, which can be
easily accessed to via moderate bi-axial strains. Our findings present magnetic
fullerene monolayers as a tunable platform for exotic quantum magnetism and
spintronic applications.

- **TL;DR**: 分子机器学习在化学工程中的应用前景综述，包括分子性质预测、化学空间探索，以及如何将分子ML整合到过程设计和优化中

We present a perspective on molecular machine learning (ML) in the field of
chemical process engineering. Recently, molecular ML has demonstrated great
potential in (i) providing highly accurate predictions for properties of pure
components and their mixtures, and (ii) exploring the chemical space for new
molecular structures. We review current state-of-the-art molecular ML models
and discuss research directions that promise further advancements. This
includes ML methods, such as graph neural networks and transformers, which can
be further advanced through the incorporation of physicochemical knowledge in a
hybrid or physics-informed fashion. Then, we consider leveraging molecular ML
at the chemical process scale, which is highly desirable yet rather unexplored.
We discuss how molecular ML can be integrated into process design and
optimization formulations, promising to accelerate the identification of novel
molecules and processes. To this end, it will be essential to create molecule
and process design benchmarks and practically validate proposed candidates,
possibly in collaboration with the chemical industry.

### Long-range spatial extension of exciton states in van der Waals heterostructure

- **TL;DR**: 研究发现MoSe2/WSe2异质结构中的间接激子存在宏观空间扩展的窄线发射，这些窄线对应moire势中的局域激子态，而非传统纳米尺度的局域态

Narrow lines in photoluminescence (PL) spectra of excitons are characteristic
of low-dimensional semiconductors. These lines correspond to the emission of
exciton states in local minima of a potential energy landscape formed by
fluctuations of the local exciton environment in the heterostructure. The
spatial extension of such states was in the nanometer range. In this work, we
present studies of narrow lines in PL spectra of spatially indirect excitons
(IXs) in a MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ van der Waals heterostructure. The narrow lines
vanish with increasing IX density. The disappearance of narrow lines correlates
with the onset of IX transport, indicating that the narrow lines correspond to
localized exciton states. The narrow lines extend over distances reaching
several micrometers and over areas reaching ca. ten percent of the sample area.
This macroscopic spatial extension of the exciton states, corresponding to the
narrow lines, indicates a deviation of the exciton energy landscape from random
potential and shows that the excitons are confined in moir\'e potential with a
weak disorder.

### Critical quantum liquids and the cuprate high temperature superconductors

- **TL;DR**: 提出了铜氧化物超导体的理论框架，基于分数化费米液体(FL*)描述低掺杂下的赝能隙相，预测了面积为p/8的空穴口袋，与实验观测一致。

We present a theoretical framework for the cuprate superconductors, rooted in
a fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*) description of the intermediate-temperature
pseudogap phase at low doping. The FL* theory predicted hole pockets each of
fractional area $p/8$ at hole doping $p$, in contrast to the area $p/4$ in a
spin density wave state or its thermal fluctuation. A recent magnetotransport
observation of the Yamaji angle is in good agreement with area $p/8$.
  We review a theory for the FL* phase of a single-band model using a pair of
ancilla qubits on each site. Its mean field theory yields hole pockets of area
$p/8$, and matches the gapped photoemission spectrum in the anti-nodal region
of the Brillouin zone. Fluctuations are described by the SU(2) gauge theory of
a background spin liquid with critical Dirac spinons. A Monte Carlo study of
the thermal SU(2) gauge theory transforms the hole pockets into Fermi arcs. One
route to confinement upon lowering temperature yields a $d$-wave superconductor
via a Kosterlitz-Thouless transition of $h/(2e)$ vortices, with nodal
Bogoliubov quasiparticles featuring anisotropic velocities and vortices
surrounded by charge order halos. An alternative route produces a
charge-ordered metallic state that exhibits quantum oscillations in agreement
with experimental data.
  Increasing doping from the FL* phase drives a transition to a conventional
Fermi liquid at large doping, passing through an intermediate strange metal
regime. We formulate a theory of this metal using a critical quantum `charge'
liquid of mobile electrons in the presence of disorder, developed via an
extension of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model.
  At low temperatures, and across optimal and over doping, we address the
regimes of extended non-Fermi liquid behavior by Griffiths effects near quantum
phase transitions in disordered metals.

### Radial asymmetry in quadrupole mass filters: stability, multipole fields and resolution enhancement

- **TL;DR**: 研究分析了线性四极杆质量分析器中径向不对称性（电极半径变化或电极位移）对传输特性和分辨率的影响，发现不对称参数会导致传输峰线性偏移，并建立了分辨率与高阶场效应之间的经验关系。

This study examines the effects of radial asymmetry in a linear quadrupole
mass filter with circular rods, introduced either by a change in electrode
radii or by displacement of a diametrically opposite pair. A radial potential
model is developed to account for the resulting geometric deviations, enabling
analysis of the first stability region specific to the quadrupole component.
The transmission characteristics of such asymmetric configurations are
systematically examined, revealing a linear shift in the transmission peak
along the q-axis as a function of the asymmetry parameter. This behavior is
interpreted through modifications observed in the stability diagram.
Furthermore, increased asymmetry is shown to broaden the transmission contours
and generally reduce resolution. Notably, a `magic' asymmetry parameter of
-0.02 corresponding to electrode displacement, yields enhanced resolution
compared to the symmetric case for a fixed rod-to-field radius ratio. An
empirical relationship is established between the resolution and the combined
contribution of the coefficients of octupole and dodecapole potential
components, highlighting the critical role of higher-order field effects in
performance optimization.

### Strong Raman Optical Activity and Chiral Phonons in Chiral Hybrid Organic-Inorganic Perovskites

- **TL;DR**: 该论文报道了手性杂化有机-无机钙钛矿中低频拉曼模式对圆偏振激发的敏感性，揭示了手性从有机连接体向无机八面体结构的转移机制。

Hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites with chiral organic cations are very
interesting for optoelectronic applications because of their intrinsically
chiral light-matter interactions. Chiral distortions in these materials lead to
circular dichroism, circular birefringence, and circularly polarized
luminescence in the band transitions of the inorganic sublattice. Raman-active
vibrational modes in these crystals are governed by crystal symmetry and
therefore are also strongly impacted by the nature and magnitude of the chiral
distortions. Here, we report low-frequency Raman modes that are sensitive to
circularly polarized excitation in chiral hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites
(CHOIPs) across a wide range of structures and compositions. The circularly
polarized Raman spectra from enantiomers of CHOIP single crystals exhibit sharp
modes below 150 cm-1, corresponding to vibrations of the lead iodide octahedra.
These modes exhibit strong differences in intensities (Raman optical activity,
ROA) depending on the handedness of the excitation, with high degree of
polarization for several modes. Calculations reveal the presence of several
chiral phonon modes with opposite phonon angular momenta. The strong ROA and
the chiral phonon modes are a direct consequence of chirality transfer from the
chiral organic linker to the lead iodide octahedra in the CHOIP structure,
resulting in a strong chiroptical response in the phonon modes.

- **TL;DR**: 电压探针(VP)和电压温度探针(VTP)在量子输运中模拟退相干时并不等价，只有在高度对称条件下才等效。VTP能保持热力学一致性，而VP可能成为热源或热沉，无法正确模拟热输运中的退相干。

Understanding how decoherence influences heat and information flow is
essential for realizing the promise of quantum technologies. Two widely used
models for incorporating decoherence in quantum transport are the voltage probe
(VP), which imposes local charge current conservation, and the
voltage-temperature probe (VTP), which also conserves heat current. Although
these models are often treated as functionally equivalent, we demonstrate that
this equivalence actually exists only under highly symmetric conditions, which
may be challenging to achieve experimentally Under asymmetric coupling or
thermal bias, the VTP respects thermodynamic constraints and enforces
decoherence in both charge and heat channels, while the VP instead acts as a
source or sink of heat. Strikingly, the VP can fail to model decoherence in the
heat transport entirely, even with large probe coupling strengths. Using a
benzene-based molecular junction as a realistic example, we show that these
effects significantly impact the predicted heat transport. These results
establish that the VP and VTP models are not interchangeable: only the VTP
provides a thermodynamically consistent framework for modeling decoherence in
quantum transport.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文构建了Majorana链与自旋系统之间的高维推广映射，通过宇称规范化的费米子系统与任意多面体分解上定义的自旋系统之间的幺正等价性，建立了高维Kramers-Wannier对偶性。

It is well known that the noninteracting Majorana chain is dual to the
one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model, either through the Jordan-Wigner
transformation or by gauging fermion parity. In this correspondence, the
minimal translation of the Majorana chain maps to the celebrated
Kramers-Wannier (KW) duality of the spin model, with the critical point mapped
to the self-dual point. In this work, we generalize this mapping to two and
higher dimensions by constructing a unitary equivalence between the
parity-gauged fermionic system and a spin system defined on arbitrary
polyhedral decompositions of space. Imposing the flatness condition on the
gauge field yields a bosonization duality between the original (ungauged)
fermionic system and a gauged spin system obeying a Gauss law. The dependence
of the Gauss law in the spin system on the Kasteleyn orientation (and the
discrete spin structure) of the fermionic system is made explicit. Applying
this bosonization to one or two copies of Majorana fermions on translationally
invariant lattices, we derive higher-dimensional analogs of KW (self-)dualities
in spin systems arising from fermionic minimal translations. The KW
(self-)dualities are non-invertible due to projections onto eigenspaces of
higher-form symmetries in the associated symmetry operators. The bosonization
framework we present is intuitive, general, and systematic, encompassing other
known exact bosonization methods while offering a novel approach to establish
new connections between fermionic and spin systems in arbitrary dimensions.

### Representative Random Sampling of Chemical Space

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种无需枚举分子即可生成化学空间无偏随机样本并估计分子数量的方法，适用于图表示的分子，可高效处理30原子分子

The overwhelming majority of molecules remains unexplored. This is mostly due
to the sheer number of them, which prohibits any enumeration of chemical space,
the set of all such molecules. In practice, only subsets of chemical space are
considered, but those subsets exhibit substantial bias, prohibiting data-driven
characterization of chemical space itself. In this work, we provide a method
produce unbiased representative random samples of chemical space without
enumeration of constituent molecules and to estimate the number of molecules in
any custom chemical space. The approach is applicable to molecules which can be
represented as graph and runs efficiently even for molecules of 30 atoms. We
use it to estimate the representativeness of current databases with respect to
their underlying chemical space and to establish a necessary criterion for a
lower bound of database sizes to be representative of an underlying chemical
space.

Hydrogen bubble formation within nanoscale voids is a critical mechanism
underlying the embrittlement of metallic materials, yet its atomistic origins
remains elusive. Here, we present an accurate and transferable machine-learned
potential (MLP) for the tungsten-hydrogen binary system within the
neuroevolution potential (NEP) framework, trained through active learning on
extensive density functional theory data. The developed NEP-WH model reproduces
a wide range of lattice and defect properties in tungsten systems, as well as
hydrogen solubility, with near first-principles accuracy, while retaining the
efficiency of empirical potentials. Crucially, it is the first MLP capable of
capturing hydrogen trapping and H\textsubscript{2} formation in nanovoids, with
quantitative fidelity. Large-scale machine-learning molecular dynamics
simulations reveal a distinct aggregation pathway where planar hydrogen
clusters nucleate and grow along \{100\} planes near voids, with hexagonal
close-packed structures emerging at their intersections. Under uniaxial
tension, these aggregates promote bubble fracture and the development of
regular \{100\} cracks, suppressing dislocation activity and resulting in
brittle fracture behavior. This work provides detailed atomistic insights into
hydrogen bubble evolution and fracture in nanovoids, enables predictive
modeling of structural degradation in extreme environments, and advances
fundamental understanding of hydrogen-induced damage in structural metals.

### Quantum Interference Supernodes, Thermoelectric Enhancement, and the Role of Dephasing

Quantum interference (QI) can strongly enhance thermoelectric response, with
higher-order "supernodes" predicted to yield scalable gains in thermopower and
efficiency. A central question, however, is whether such features are
intrinsically more fragile to dephasing. Using $B\"uttiker$ voltage-temperature
probes, we establish an order-selection rule: the effective near-node order is
set by the lowest among coherent and probe-assisted channels. Supernodes are
therefore fragile in an absolute sense because their transmission is
parametrically suppressed with order. However, once an incoherent floor
dominates, the fractional suppression of thermopower, efficiency, and figure of
merit becomes universal and order-independent. Illustrating these principles
with benzene- and biphenyl-based junction calculations, we show that the
geometry of environmental coupling -- through a single orbital or across many
-- dictates whether coherence is lost by order reduction or by floor building.
These results yield general scaling rules for the thermoelectric response of
interference nodes under dephasing.

### Run-and-tumble particle with diffusion: boundary local times and the zero-diffusion limit

Incorporating boundary conditions into stochastic models of passive or active
particle motion is usually implemented at the level of the associated forward
or backward Kolmogorov equation, whose solution determines the probability
distribution of sample paths. In order to write down the corresponding
stochastic differential equation (SDE) that generates the individual sample
paths, it is necessary to introduce a Brownian functional that keeps track of
the boundary-particle contact time. We previously constructed the SDE for a
(non-diffusing) run-and-tumble particle (RTP) on the half-line with either a
reflecting or sticky wall at $x=0$. In this paper we extend the theory to
include the effects of diffusion. One of the non-trivial consequences of
combining drift-diffusion with tumbling is that the zero diffusion limit
$D\rightarrow 0$ is singular in the sense that the number of boundary
conditions is doubled when $D&gt;0$. We use stochastic calculus to derive the
forward Kolmogorov equation for two distinct boundary conditions that reduce,
respectively, to non-sticky and sticky boundary conditions in the
zero-diffusion limit. In the latter case, it is necessary to include a boundary
layer in a neighbourhood of the wall and use singular perturbation theory. We
also treat the wall as partially absorbing by assuming that the particle is
absorbed when the amount of boundary-particle contact time (discrete or
continuous local time) exceeds a quenched random threshold. Finally, we analyse
the survival probability and corresponding FPT density for absorption at a
non-sticky wall by deriving the corresponding backward Kolmogorov equation

- **TL;DR**: K₂Mn₃(AsO₄)₃被预测为理想Weyl半金属，但实验和计算表明它是绝缘体，具有复杂的磁性结构，破坏了Weyl节点所需的对称性。

The ideal Weyl 'Hydrogen-atom' semi-metal exhibits only a single pair of Weyl
nodes and no other trivial states at the Fermi energy. Such a material would be
a panacea in the study of Weyl quasi particles allowing direct unambiguous
observation of their topological properties. The alluaudite-like
K$_2$Mn$_3$(AsO$_4$)$_3$ compound was recently proposed as such a material.
Here we use comprehensive experimental work and first principle calculations to
assess this prediction. We find K$_2$Mn$_3$(AsO$_4$)$_3$ crystallizes in the
$C2/c$ symmetry with a quasi-1D Mn sublattice, growing as small needle-like
crystals. Bulk properties measurements reveal magnetic transitions at $\approx$
8 and $\approx$ 4 K which neutron scattering experiments show correspond to two
distinct magnetic orders, first a partially ordered ferrimagnetic
$\mathbf{k_1}$= (0, 0, 0) structure at 8 K and a second transition of
$\mathbf{k_2}$= (1, 0, 0) at 4 K to a fully ordered state. Below the second
transition, both ordering vectors are necessary to describe the complex
magnetic structure with modulated spin magnitudes. Both of the best-fit
magnetic structures in this work are found to break the symmetry necessary for
the generation of the Weyl nodes, though one of the magnetic structures allowed
by $\mathbf{k_1}$ does preserve this symmetry. However, the crystals are
optically transparent and ellipsometry measurements reveal a large band-gap,
undermining expectations of semi-metallic behavior. Density functional theory
calculations predict an insulating antiferromagnetic ground state, in contrast
to previous reports, and suggest potential frustration on the magnetic
sublattice. Given the wide tunability of the alluaudite structure we consider
ways to push the system closer to semi-metallic state.

### Intermolecular Interactions between Polyethylene, Water, and Potential Antistatic and Slip Additives: a Molecular Dynamics Study

Additives are essential to enhance or modify the properties of plastics for
target applications. However, finding appropriate additives may be challenging,
since we lack knowledge on their interactions with the plastics and with
moisture, and the interplay between them. In this work, we study a commercial
additive as well as two new potential additives for their antistatic and slip
properties in polyethylene by means of atomistic molecular dynamics
simulations. We reveal the most favorable interactions between polyethylene,
each of these molecules and water, along with providing a microscopic picture
of their interfacial structure. All additives interact with water mainly by
their polar heads, with water acting as a hydrogen bond acceptor or donor
depending on the additive. As expected, water does not enter the polyethylene
matrix; it accumulates at its surface instead, without any preferencial
orientation. The additives studied exhibit remarkably different structures when
they are mixed with the polymer: two of them enter the polymer matrix to
various degrees, either by intercalating their chains with the polyethylene
ones or by forming miscellar-like structures, while the third one stays at the
surface. When water is incorporated into the system, the structure of some of
the additive/polyethylene systems changes. The magnitude and nature of these
changes depend on the relative concentrations of all species. If the additives
are in low concentrations, water stays at the surface of the material, in a
drop-like shape. The additives penetrate and organize the polymer more or less
depending on whether water is present or not. We predict that one of our two
proposed molecules has promising antistatic properties while the other one
could be applied as a slip agent. We hope that our predictions will spark
interest in testing these molecules in the laboratory as polyethylene
additives.

- **TL;DR**: 通过THz波泵光和磁光探针时间分辨光谱学研究CoTiO3的光驱动梯式动力学对磁性质的影响，发现外在对称性破坏在复杂氧化物的光驱动现象中可能起重要作用

Spin-lattice coupling is crucial for understanding the spin transport and
dynamics for spintronics and magnonics applications. Recently, cobalt titanate
(CoTiO3), an easy-plane antiferromagnet, has been found to host axial phonons
with a large magnetic moment, which may originate from spin-lattice coupling.
Here, we investigate the effect of light-driven lattice dynamics on the
magnetic properties of CoTiO3 using time-resolved spectroscopy with a THz pump
and a magneto-optic probe. We found resonantly driven Raman active phonons,
phonon-polariton-induced excitation of the antiferromagnetic magnons, and a
slow increase in the polarization rotation of the probe, all indicating
symmetry breaking that is not intrinsic to the magnetic space group. The
temperature dependence confirmed that the observed spin dynamics is related to
the magnetic order, and we suggest surface effects as a possible mechanism. Our
results of THz-induced spin-lattice dynamics signify that extrinsic symmetry
breaking may contribute strongly and unexpectedly to light-driven phenomena in
bulk complex oxides.

### Topological invariant responsible for the stability of the Fermi surfaces in non - homogeneous systems

The topological invariant responsible for the stability of Fermi point/Fermi
surface in homogeneous systems is expressed through the one particle Green
function, which depends on momentum. It is given by an integral over the 3D
hypersurface in momentum space surrounding the Fermi surface. Notion of Fermi
surface may be extended to the non - homogeneous systems using Wigner - Weyl
calculus. The Fermi surface becomes coordinate dependent, it may be defined as
the position of the singularity in momentum space of the Wigner transformed
Green function. Then the topological invariant responsible for the stability of
this Fermi surface is given by the same expression as for the homogeneous case,
in which the Green function is replaced by its Wigner transformation while the
ordinary products are replaced by the Moyal products. We illustrate the
proposed construction by the examples of the systems, in which the given
topological invariant is nontrivial and may be calculated explicitly.

### Evanescent random walker on networks: Hitting times, budget renewal, and survival dynamics

- **TL;DR**: 本文研究了一个在网络上的有寿命随机游走模型，游走者具有初始预算，每步消耗预算，到达目标节点时预算重置。分析了目标命中统计、生存概率、预期寿命等关键指标。

We consider a mortal random walker evolving with discrete time on a network,
where transitions follow a degree-biased Markovian navigation strategy. The
walker starts with a random initial budget $T_1 \in \mathbb{N}$ and must
maintain a strictly positive budget to remain alive. Each step incurs a unit
cost, decrementing the budget by one; the walker perishes (is ruined) upon
depletion of the budget. However, when the walker reaches designated target
nodes, the budget is renewed by an independent and identically distributed
(IID) copy of its initial value. The degree bias is tuned to either favor or
disfavor visits to these target nodes. Our model exhibits connections with
stochastic resetting. The evolution of the budget can be interpreted as a
deterministic drift on the integer line toward negative values, where the
walker is intermittently reset to positive IID random positions and dies at the
first hit of the origin. The first part of the paper focuses on the
target-hitting statistics of an immortal Markovian walker. We analyze the
\textit{target hitting counting process} (THCP) for an arbitrary set of target
nodes. Within this framework, the second part of the paper addresses the
dynamics of the evanescent walker. We derive analytical results for arbitrary
configurations of target nodes, including the evanescent propagator matrix, the
survival probability, the mean residence time on a set of nodes during the
walker's lifetime, and the expected lifetime itself. Additionally, we compute
the expected number of target hits (i.e., budget renewals) in a lifetime of the
walker and related distributions. We explore both analytically and numerically
various scenarios affecting the life expectancy of the walker.

We reintroduce the parafermion-paraboson classification in $R$-paraparticles
in terms of their average occupation numbers, analogous to Green's
parastatistics. The notion of $p$-order in $R$-parafermions is also redefined
as the maximum number of particles that can occupy a quantum state. An example
of an order-$2$ $R$-parafermion with $m=2$ internal degrees of freedom is
presented, which obeys an exclusion principle that is not Pauli's. The
interacting $R$-parafermions are studied in the context of bosonization.
Specifically, we show that while density waves are generally bosonic in nature
and that flavor-charge separation naturally occurs for any one-dimensional
$R$-parafermion system described by the Luttinger model, flavor waves do not
always satisfy bose statistics. Comparison of the partition functions further
show that only $(p=1)$-ordered $R$-parafermions are compatible with the
bosonization procedure in the low-energy limit. Based from these results, we
discuss a potential realization of parafermion signatures in one-dimensional
systems.

\b{eta}-Ga2O3 is a promising candidate for next-generation semiconductors,
but is limited by its intrinsic brittleness, which hinders its application in
flexible electronics and high-precision devices. This study explores a new
approach to improving the damage tolerance of (001)-oriented \b{eta}-Ga2O3 by
introducing mechanically seeded dislocations via surface scratching. By
applying a Brinell indenter to scratch the surface along the [100] direction,
we effectively generate edge-type dislocations belonging to the (011)[01-1]
and/or (0-11)[011] slip systems within a mesoscale wear track. Through a
combination of nanoindentation tests, surface morphology analysis, and
microstructural characterization using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and
transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we reveal that the introduction of
dislocations significantly mitigates the formation of cleavage cracks during
indentation, in contrast to that observed in as-received \b{eta}-Ga2O3. The
mechanically seeded dislocations in the subsurface layers play an important
role in preventing brittle fracture by facilitating stable plastic deformation.

While tremendous research has revealed that symmetry enriches topological
phases of matter, more general principles that protect topological phases have
yet to be explored. In this Letter, we elucidate the roles of subspaces in
free-fermionic topological phases. A subspace property for Hamiltonians enables
us to define new topological invariants. They result in peculiar topological
boundary phenomena, i.e., the emergence of an unpaired zero mode or
zero-winding skin modes, characterizing subspace-protected topological phases.
We establish and demonstrate the bulk-boundary correspondence in
subspace-protected topological phases. We further discuss the interplay of the
subspace property and internal symmetries. Toward application, we also propose
possible platforms possessing the subspace property.

We prove that for quantum spin chains with finite-range interactions, the
existence of a specific conservation law known as the Reshetikhin condition
implies the presence of infinitely many local conserved quantities, i.e.,
integrability. This shows that the entire hierarchy of conservation laws
associated with solutions of the Yang--Baxter equation is already encoded in
the lowest nontrivial conservation law. Combined with recent rigorous results
on nonintegrability, our theorem strongly restricts the possibility of
partially integrable systems that admit only a finite but large number of local
conserved quantities. Our work establishes a rigorous foundation for the
systematic identification of new integrable models and deepens the algebraic
understanding of conservation-law structures in quantum spin chains.

Muon spin relaxation is a powerful technique for probing static and dynamic
local magnetic fields. The strong collision model, based on a
Gaussian-Markovian process, is commonly used to account for dynamical effects.
Yet, it remains limited in describing systems where the local field undergoes
discrete state changes. To address this, I introduce a generalized two-state
strong collision model that explicitly incorporates transitions between
distinct local field environments during fluctuations. This extension allows
for a more accurate representation of dynamical effects, particularly in
systems where each collision alters the underlying static polarisation
function. Analytical and numerical solutions are presented, and the model's
applicability is demonstrated {\color{black}and discussed} across relevant
physical systems -- including low-dimensional magnets, systems with dynamic
disorder and ion and muon diffusion. These results offer an enhanced framework
for interpreting data in complex materials and extend the method's reach to a
broader class of dynamical phenomena in condensed matter physics.

This work presents the results of a study on the solid-state synthesis of
barium titanate under continuous microwave radiation from a 24 GHz gyrotron in
a multimode cavity reactor. It is shown that in localized domains where
fine-scale thermal instabilities develop, initiated by microwave radiation
within the initial stoichiometric reaction mixture of ultrafine barium
carbonate and titanium dioxide powders, the synthesis can proceed within 1,5 -
7 minutes, achieving a target product yield of up to 90%. Based on a developed
realistic numerical model of the multimode reactor, involving an iterative
solution of stationary Maxwell and heat conduction equations, it is
demonstrated that the specific absorbed power in the domains where fine-scale
thermal instabilities develop can reach 670 W/cm3 under an input microwave
power of 400 W.

Predicting optoelectronic properties of large-scale atomistic systems under
realistic conditions is crucial for rational materials design, yet
computationally prohibitive with first-principles simulations. Recent neural
network models have shown promise in overcoming these challenges, but typically
require large datasets and lack physical interpretability. Physics-inspired
approximate models offer greater data efficiency and intuitive understanding,
but often sacrifice accuracy and transferability. Here we present HAMSTER, a
physics-informed machine learning framework for predicting the
quantum-mechanical Hamiltonian of complex chemical systems. Starting from an
approximate model encoding essential physical effects, HAMSTER captures the
critical influence of dynamic environments on Hamiltonians using only few
explicit first-principles calculations. We demonstrate our approach on halide
perovskites, achieving accurate prediction of optoelectronic properties across
temperature and compositional variations, and scalability to systems containing
tens of thousands of atoms. This work highlights the power of physics-informed
Hamiltonian learning for accurate and interpretable optoelectronic property
prediction in large, complex systems.

Thermoelectric devices at the nanoscale offer promising routes for on-chip
refrigeration and waste-heat recovery, yet most semiconductor-based
implementations suffer from limited tunability and narrow operational ranges.
We introduce a highly flexible thermoelectric platform based on a ballistic
junction formed by two gate-tunable regions of a topological insulator surface
state bridged by a magnetic barrier. We theoretically demonstrate that such
device exhibits strong electrical control over both refrigeration and
thermoelectric power generation via side gates. We exploit the interplay
between strong spin-orbit coupling and magnetism to achieve pronounced
nonreciprocal transport, asymmetric cooling and tunable diode-like behavior. To
demonstrate experimental feasibility, we further analyze refrigeration
efficiency and phonon-limited performance in realistic material settings.

- **TL;DR**: 研究对称自化学向性粒子的随机动力学，发现在低空间维度（d≤2）下会出现异常扩散行为，具体变化取决于化学吐羞作用的吸引或排斥性质。

We study the stochastic dynamics of a symmetric self-chemotactic particle and
determine the long-time behavior of its mean squared displacement (MSD). The
attractive or repulsive interaction of the particle with the chemical field
that it generates induces a non-linear, non-Markovian effective dynamics, which
results into anomalous diffusion for spatial dimensions $d \leq 2$. In one
spatial dimension, we map the case of repulsive chemotaxis onto a
run-and-tumble-like dynamics, leading to an MSD which, as a function of the
elapsed time $t$, grows superdiffusively with exponent $4/3$. In the presence
of attractive chemotaxis, instead, the particle exhibits a slowdown, with the
MSD growing logarithmically with time. In $d=2$, we find logarithmic aging of
the diffusion coefficient, while in $d=3$ the motion reverts standard diffusive
behavior with a renormalized diffusion coefficient.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种基于组态相互作用(CI)的高效动力学平均场理论求解器，相比传统精确对角化方法具有更好的计算效率，可在普通笔记本电脑或超级计算机上运行。

Accurate calculations of strongly correlated materials remain a formidable
challenge in condensed matter physics, particularly due to the computational
demand of conventional methods. This paper presents an efficient solver for
dynamical mean field theory using configuration interaction (CI). The method is
shown to have improved efficiency compared to traditional, exact
diagonalization approaches. Hence, it provides an accessible, open-source
alternative that can be executed on standard laptop computers or on
supercomputers. The solver is demonstrated on cerium in the $\gamma$-,
$\alpha$- and $\epsilon$-phases. An analysis of how the electronic structure of
Ce evolves as function of lattice compression is made. It is argued that the
electronic structure evolves from a localized nature of the 4f shell in
$\gamma$-Ce to an essentially itinerant nature of the 4f shell of
$\epsilon$-Ce. The transition between these two phases, as function of
compression, can hence be seen as a Mott transition. However, this transition
is intercepted by the strongly correlated $\alpha$-phase of elemental Ce, for
which the 4f shell forms a Kondo singlet.

### Revival of Layered Ferroelectrics in Thin Films

Layered perovskites are a versatile class of ferroelectrics with their
structural anisotropy reflected in unusual electrostatics that give rise to
exceptional ferroelectric properties. These materials fall into four main
families: Aurivillius, Carpy-Galy, Ruddlesden-Popper, and Dion-Jacobson phases;
each forming natural superlattices by interleaving perovskite slabs with spacer
layers. For a long time, these materials were considered too structurally
complex to prepare as high-quality thin films. However, recent breakthroughs in
deposition and advanced characterization have made it possible to stabilize
high-quality films with atomic precision, uncovering a wide range of
unconventional ferroelectric functionalities. These include robust in-plane
polarization without a critical thickness, the emergence of charged domain
walls and non-trivial polar textures, resilience to doping with magnetic ions
and charge carriers, and possibility to epitaxially integrate them into
standard perovskite heterostructures. This review aims to unify current
knowledge on the fabrication and characterization of layered ferroelectric thin
films, and to present research findings across all four structural families,
with the goal of highlighting their common features despite differences in
crystal structure and polarization mechanisms. We also discuss promising
research directions, including polar metallicity, (alter-)magnetoelectricity,
exfoliation, and soft-chemistry-driven phase transformations, with the goal of
consolidating the field and encouraging further exploration of these materials
for both fundamental studies and applications.

A machine learning-accelerated high-throughput (HTP) workflow for the
discovery of magnetic materials is presented. As a test case, we screened
quaternary and all-$d$ Heusler compounds for stable compounds with large
magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy ($E_{\mathrm{aniso}}$). Structure
optimization and evaluation of formation energy and distance to hull convex
were performed using the eSEN-30M-OAM interatomic potential, while local
magnetic moments, phonon stability, magnetic stability, and
$E_{\mathrm{aniso}}$ were predicted by eSEM models trained on our DxMag Heusler
database. A frozen transfer learning strategy was employed to improve accuracy.
Candidate compounds identified by the ML-HTP workflow were validated with
density functional theory, confirming high predictive precision. We also
benchmark the performance of different MLIPs, and discuss the fidelity of local
magnetic moment prediction and its extension to other magnetic materials.

### Quantum melting a Wigner crystal into Hall liquids

Recent experiments have shown that, counterintuitively, applying a magnetic
field to a Wigner crystal can induce quantum Hall effects. In this work, using
variational Monte Carlo, we show that magnetic fields can melt zero-field
Wigner crystals into integer quantum Hall liquids. This melting originates from
quantum oscillations in the liquid's ground state energy, which develops
downward cusps at integer filling factors due to incompressibility. Our
calculations establish a range of densities in which this quantum melting
transition occurs.

We examine the dynamics of the three-state Potts quantum spin chain in the
extreme ferromagnetic regime using perturbation theory in the transverse
magnetic field. We demonstrate that this approach provides access to features
well beyond the semiclassical method applied previously, including the
description of resonant excitations and analytic prediction for the time
evolution after a quantum quench. We also demonstrate that it agrees with the
meson/bubble spectrum results from exact diagonalisation and the numerical
simulations of the time evolution.

### Evolution of quasiparticle edge states with Hubbard interaction in Rice-Mele chain

- **TL;DR**: 研究Hubbard相互作用下Rice-Mele模型边缘态行为，发现排斥作用导致零能边缘态，且边缘态从物理电荷隙迁移到高能隙

We study the behaviour of edge states in Rice-Mele model with Hubbard
interaction, U , at half-filling using density matrix renormalization group,
exact diagonalization and effective charge dynamics in Kumar representation.
For a fixed dimerization, $\delta$, and staggered potential, V , we find by
increasing U the quasiparticle edge states in the charge gap to come down in
energy from V in the absence of Hubbard interaction to zero energy for U
$\approx$ 2V . This presents an uncommon case where repulsion leads to
zero-energy edge states. Upon increasing U further, the edge state energy
starts increasing again until they are lost in the bulk. However, upon
increasing U even further, these edge states reappear in the high energy gap.
So, with Hubbard interaction, the edge states in Rice-Mele chain transmigrate
from the physical charge gap to a high energy gap.

### Lithiation Analysis of Metal Components for Li-Ion Battery using Ion Beams

- **TL;DR**: 该研究筛选了六种单原子金属（Mg、Zn、Al、Ag、Sn和Cu）在锂离子电池中的锂化行为，通过离子束分析技术揭示了三种不同的锂化机制，并与理论模拟结果相吻合。

Metal components are extensively used as current collectors, anodes, and
interlayers in lithium-ion batteries. Integrating these functions into one
component enhances the cell energy density and simplifies its design. However,
this multifunctional component must meet stringent requirements, including high
and reversible Li storage capacity, rapid lithiation/delithiation kinetics,
mechanical stability, and safety. Six single-atom metals (Mg, Zn, Al, Ag, Sn
and Cu) are screened for lithiation behavior through their interaction with ion
beams in electrochemically tested samples subjected to both weak and strong
lithiation regimes. These different lithiation regimes allowed us to
differentiate between the thermodynamics and kinetic aspects of the lithiation
process. Three types of ions are used to determine Li depth profile: $H^+$ for
nuclear reaction analysis (NRA), $He^+$ for Rutherford backscattering (RBS),
and $Ga^+$ for focused ion beam (FIB) milling. The study reveals three
lithiation behaviors: (i) Zn, Al, Sn form pure alloys with Li; (ii) Mg, Ag
create intercalation solid solutions; (iii) Cu acts as a lithiation barrier.
NRA and RBS offer direct and quantitative data, providing a more comprehensive
understanding of the lithiation process in LIB components. These findings fit
well with our ab-initio simulation results, establishing a direct correlation
between electrochemical features and fundamental thermodynamic parameters.

### A perspective on inelastic light scattering spectroscopy for probing transport of collective acoustic excitations

Understanding and manipulating nanoscale energy transport and conversion
processes are essential for diverse applications, ranging from thermoelectrics
and energy harvesting to thermal management of microelectronics. While it has
long been recognized that acoustic and thermal properties in condensed matters
are primarily due to microscopic transport of phonons as quasiparticles,
probing thermal acoustic excitations particularly at sub-THz remains a
challenge primarily due to limitations in experimental techniques with
spatiotemporal resolutions pertinent to probing them. Brillouin light
scattering (BLS) and its variant, impulsive stimulated Brillouin scattering
(ISS), provide access to these thermal acoustic excitations, enabling
measurement of quantities such as acoustic dispersions along with relaxation
dynamics occurring in ultrasonic as well as hypersonic frequencies. In this
perspective, we provide a brief overview of the operational principles of BLS
and ISS, and highlight their applications in probing acoustic, thermal, and
magnetic excitations in emerging and low-dimensional materials. We conclude by
discussing current challenges and future opportunities for advanced material
characterization using Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy techniques.

### Optical Response by Time-Varying Plasmonic Nanoparticles

- **TL;DR**: 通过时间调制金属纳粒子的材料参数，在线性介质中实现光强化，通过Floquet复制本地化表面充液元激发具有放大特性。

The temporal modulation of material parameters enables optical amplification
within linear media. Here we consider the fundamental building block of
plasmonics, a subwavelength metal nanoparticle, and study how temporal
modulation alters the optical response of the frequency-dispersive scatterers.
We show that modulating in time leads to Floquet replicas of the localized
surface plasmon resonance of the nanoparticle, which can result in light
amplification. We propose a model based on a point-like dipole description of
the time-varying frequency-dispersive nanoparticle that fully captures the
radiative and amplifying properties of the system in the subwavelength regime.
By comparing our simplified model to full Floquet-Mie scattering calculations,
we demonstrate that the optical scattering by the nanoparticle is accurately
described by an analytical two-band model. This allows us to introduce a
two-frequency effective polarizability that fully incorporates the properties
of the localized surface plasmon and its amplifying replica, as well as their
interaction. In addition, we analyze the emergence of the parametric
amplification condition for the modulated nanoparticle, showing that
amplification can be obtained in a broad range of parameters.

### Multicritical Infection Spreading

- **TL;DR**: 该文章通过大规模蒙特卡洛模拟研究了二维和三维空间中的多重关键接触过程，发现其具有激活动态缩放特性，并与多重关键量子伊鑫模型属于同一普遍性类。

The contact process is a simple infection spreading model showcasing an
out-of-equilibrium phase transition between a macroscopically active and an
inactive phase. Such absorbing state phase transitions are often sensitive to
the presence of quenched disorder. Traditionally, a phase transition in the
disordered contact process is either triggered by dilution or by locally
varying the infection rate. However, when both factors play an important role,
a multicritical point emerges that remains poorly understood. Here, we study
the multicritical contact process by large-scale Monte Carlo simulations in two
and three dimensions. The multicritical behavior is found to be universal and
exhibits ultra-slow, activated dynamical scaling, with exponents consistent
with those predicted by the strong disorder renormalization group method. This
finding indicates that the multicritical contact process belongs to the same
universality class as the multicritical quantum Ising model, opening future
directions to measure quantum entanglement properties via classical
simulations.

We combine single-crystal neutron diffraction studies and Monte Carlo
simulations to determine the spin structures and finite-temperature phase
diagram of the spin-5/2 triangular-lattice antiferromagnet
Na$_2$BaMn(PO$_4$)$_2$ in magnetic field. With the application of a magnetic
field in two different directions, namely along the $c$-axis and in the
$ab$-plane of the trigonal symmetry, we track the evolution of the spin
structure through changes of the magnetic propagation vector. We account for
these results with a minimal Heisenberg Hamiltonian that includes easy-axis
anisotropy and weak, frustrated interlayer couplings in addition to intralayer
exchange. Guided by representation analysis, we refine symmetry-allowed modes
to the measured intensities and obtain the spin structures for all
field-induced phases, which we compare quantitatively with simulated
configurations. Taken together, our measurements and simulations show that
frustrated interlayer exchange -- rather than purely 2D physics -- organizes
the unexpectedly rich field-induced phases of Na$_2$BaMn(PO$_4$)$_2$.

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with ultra-small pores offer an optimal
environment to effectively capture guest molecules such as CO2. Subtle local
dynamics of their frameworks, either throughout reorientation of functional
groups grafted to the organic linkers or those present in their inorganic
nodes, is expected to play a major role in their sorption behaviors. Here, we
combine density-functional theory (DFT) with a purpose-trained machine-learned
potential to systematically investigate the local dynamics of the bridging
hydroxyl groups, {\mu}2-OH groups present in the prototypical ultra-small pore
MOF MIL-120(Al), reported recently as an attractive CO2 sorbent. We identified
six MOF configurations associated with distinct {\mu}2-OH orientations with
relatively low interconversion energy barriers (0.07-0.19 eV per unit cell)
suggesting that all these states can be observed experimentally at room
temperature. We demonstrated that our MLP achieves near-DFT-level fidelity,
reproducing the energy barriers and phonon spectra of the empty MOF, and
accurately predicting CO2 adsorption geometries depending on the {\mu}2-OH
orientations with CO2 adopting either parallel or perpendicular alignment to
the pore axis, which in turn governs the adsorption energetics. This work
establishes that a reliable description of the local structure, such as
reorientation/flipping of bridging hydroxyl groups, is a key feature to gain an
accurate description of the guest locations and energetics in ultra-small pore
MOFs.

### Activity propagation with Hebbian learning

- **TL;DR**: 本文研究了赫布学习对接触过程的影响，发现局部学习激励会产生相反的全局效应：正强化导致活性相消失，负强化可使非活性相转为全局活性相。

We investigate the impact of Hebbian learning on the contact process, a
paradigmatic model for infection spreading, which has been also proposed as a
simple model to capture the dynamics of inter-regional brain activity
propagation as well as population spreading. Each of these contexts calls for
an extension of the contact process with local learning. We introduce Hebbian
learning as a positive or negative reinforcement of the activation rate between
a pair of sites after each successful activation event. Learning can happen
either in both directions motivated by social distancing (mutual learning
model), or in only one of the directions motivated by brain and population
dynamics (source or target learning models). Hebbian learning leads to a rich
class of emergent behavior, where local incentives can lead to the opposite
global effects. In general, positive reinforcement (increasing activation
rates) leads to a loss of the active phase, while negative reinforcement
(reducing activation rates) can turn the inactive phase into a globally active
phase. In two dimensions and above, the effect of negative reinforcement is
twofold: it promotes the spreading of activity, but at the same time gives rise
to the appearance of effectively immune regions, entailing the emergence of two
distinct critical points. Positive reinforcement can lead to Griffiths effects
with non-universal power-law scaling, through the formation of random loops of
activity, a manifestation of the ``ant mill" phenomenon.

### Prediction of EDS Maps from 4DSTEM Diffraction Patterns Using Convolutional Neural Networks

Understanding the relationship between atomic structure (order) and chemical
composition (chemistry) is critical for advancing materials science, yet
traditional spectroscopic techniques can be slow and damaging to sensitive
samples. Four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM)
captures detailed diffraction patterns across scanned regions, providing rich
structural information, while energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) offers
complementary chemical data. In this work, we develop a machine learning
framework that predicts EDS spectra directly from 4D-STEM diffraction patterns,
reducing beam exposure and acquisition time. A convolutional neural network
(CNN) accurately infers elemental compositions, particularly for elements with
strong diffraction contrast or higher concentrations, such as Oxygen and
Tellurium. Both extrapolation and interpolation strategies demonstrate
consistent performance, with improved predictions when additional structural
context is available. Visual and cross-correlation analyses confirm the model's
ability to capture global and local compositional trends. This approach
establishes a data-driven pathway to non-destructive, high-throughput materials
characterization.

Two-dimensional (2D) half-metals with intrinsic ferromagnetism hold great
potential for applications in spintronics. In this study, we aim to expand the
known space of such 2D ferromagnetic (FM) half-metals by investigating bilayer
of Janus VSSe, an FM semiconductor. Its structural, electronic, and magnetic
properties are examined using density functional theory, employing the DFT+$U$
method, coupled with the PBE functional. The stability of the bilayer is
examined using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations at finite temperatures
up to 400 K. To ensure the stability further, the elastic constants of the
system have also been investigated and we found that VSSe bilayer manifests an
easy plane of magnetization similar to its monolayer counterpart. At the
DFT+$U$ level, the considered VSSe bilayer exhibits a tendency towards
half-metallicity with a small band gap of 0.11 eV for the majority spin
carriers, and of 0.66 eV for the minority ones. To include a transition from a
semiconductor to a half-metal, the bilayer is subjected to an external electric
field of varying strengths normal to the plane. The lack of horizontal mirror
symmetry in the bilayer allows bidirectional tuning of the band gap, with
different values for the field in "upward" and "downward" directions. The band
gaps for the two spin channels increase with the increasing upward electric
field, while the opposite happens for the downward fields, with the majority
carrier gap closing at 0.16 V/$\unicode{x212B}$, making the material a spin
gapless semiconductor. Further increase in the electric field renders the
material half metallic at 0.18 V/$\unicode{x212B}$. Given the fact that these
values of the external electric field are achievable in the lab suggests that
the FM Janus VSSe bilayer is a promising candidate for spintronic devices.

computing and memory applications. However, domain morphology and dynamics in
buried ferroelectric stacks have remained underexplored, despite the importance
for real device performance. Here, nanoprobe X-ray diffraction (nano-XRD) is
used to image ferroelectric domains inside BiFeO3-based capacitors, revealing
striking differences from bare films such as local disorder in domain
architecture and partial polarization reorientation. We demonstrate sensitivity
to ferroelectric reversal in poled capacitors, revealing expansive/compressive
(001) strain for up-/down-polarization using nano-XRD. We observe quantitative
and qualitative differences between poling by piezoresponse force microscopy
(PFM) and in devices. Further, biasing induces lattice tilt at electrode edges
which may modify performance in down-scaled devices. Direct comparison with PFM
polarized structures even demonstrates potential nano-XRD sensitivity to domain
walls. Our results establish nano-XRD as a noninvasive probe of buried
ferroelectric domain morphologies and dynamics, opening avenues for operando
characterization of energy-efficient nanoscale devices.

- **TL;DR**: 对玻璃态GeO₂在激光诱导动态压缩下的研究，包括高压状态方程、光学性质变化以及首次观察到激光冲击诱导的结晶和熔化现象

In this work we present an extensive study of glassy GeO$_2$ under laser
induced dynamic compression. New VISAR and SOP data provide the extension of
Hugoniot EoS up to the TPa range for this material including temperature
measurements. Reflectivity data at both 532 and 1064 nm wavelenght are also
reported. In the low compression range we observe changes of the optical
properties from transparent, to opaque, to metallic state. The second part of
this work describes a further laser shock experiment combined with in-situ
X-ray diffraction. Here we observe, for the first time, the laser shock-induced
crystallization of glassy GeO$_2$ to a structure compatible with the rutile
phase at pressure higher than 20 GPa and melting occurring at around 75 GPa.

### Control of polarization and polar chiral textures in BiFeO$_3$ by epitaxial strain and interfacial chemistry

- **TL;DR**: 该研究通过调控界面化学、静电和应变之间的平衡，在BiFeO3薄膜中实现了极化方向和手性织构的控制。研究发现表面氟化物层的形成可以补偿极化电荷，并通过插入Aurivillius缓冲层成功稳定了均匀的面外极化。

The balance between interfacial chemistry, electrostatics, and epitaxial
strain plays a crucial role in stabilizing polarization in ferroelectric thin
films. Here, we bring these contributions into competition in BiFeO$_3$ (BFO)
thin films grown on the charged-surface-terminated La$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$MnO$_3$
(LSMO)-buffered NdGaO$_3$ (001) substrates. The large anisotropic compressive
strain from the substrate promotes the formation of ferroelectric domains
despite the expected stabilization of a uniform out-of-plane polarization by
the (La,Sr)O$^{0.7+}$ termination of the metallic buffer. Piezoresponse force
microscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy reveal that the
resulting nanoscale domain architecture is stabilized by the deterministic
formation of a fluorite-like Bi$_2$O$_2$ surface layer on regions polarized
oppositely to the LSMO-imposed polarization orientation. Leveraging this
polarization compensation mechanism, we stabilize a uniform out-of-plane
polarization in our highly strained BFO films by inserting a
Bi$_2$O$_2$-terminated Aurivillius film as a buffer layer. Additionally, we
reveal signatures of homochiral polarization textures in our BFO films on the
level of domain configurations using local polarization switching experiments.
Our work thus brings new strategies for controlling polarization direction and
chiral textures in oxide ferroelectrics, opening pathways for functional
domain-wall and domain-based electronics.

We present the synthesis and study of the magnetic and electronic properties
of NiFe2O4/{\gamma}-Al2O3/SrTiO3 heterostructure. The {\gamma}-Al2O3/SrTiO3
interface hosts a high-mobility two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) with large
spin-orbit coupling, making it promising for spintronics applications if it can
be coupled to a suitable source of spin currents. Here, we synthesize a
ferrimagnetic insulating NiFe2O4(001) layer on {\gamma}-Al2O3(001)/SrTiO3(001)
using a low-temperature reactive sputtering at 150 deg C without compromising
the mobility and charge carrier density of the 2DEG at the
{\gamma}-Al2O3(001)/SrTiO3(001) interface. The sheet resistance of both
{\gamma}-Al2O3/SrTiO3 and NiFe2O4/{\gamma}-Al2O3/SrTiO3 exhibits metallic
behavior down to cryogenic temperatures, with a low temperature upturn driven
by the Kondo-like scattering. Most importantly, NiFe2O4/{\gamma}-Al2O3/SrTiO3
behaves as a magnetic diode at low temperatures, and its rectification
performance increases significantly with increasing magnetic field strength
giving rise to a robust magneto-electronic rectification effect at low
temperatures, which provides a first step towards the development of all-oxide
heterostructures capable of efficient spin-charge conversion.

Noncollinear antiferromagnets (NCAFs) have recently emerged as promising
candidates for future spintronic technologies, offering ultrafast switching,
negligible stray fields allowing dense packing, and robustness against external
magnetic perturbations. When interfaced with ferromagnets (FMs), they can
strongly influence interfacial exchange and spin-torque mechanisms that enable
manipulating magnetic order and realizing functionalities beyond conventional
heavy metals (HMs) based FM/HM heterostructures. Here, we perform a broadband
ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) study to systematically investigate the
magnetization dynamics and spin-to-charge conversion in permalloy (Py) and
Mn$_3$Pt bilayers. High-quality Py films provide a well-defined FMR spectra
with a low Gilbert damping parameter ( $\alpha_{\mathrm{eff}} \approx 9.8
\times 10^{-3}$). We observe a pronounced enhancement of damping with intrinsic
value $\alpha_{\mathrm{int}} \approx 3.1 \times 10^{-2}$ in the Py/Mn$_3$Pt
bilayer, indicating efficient spin pumping into the NCAF layer. Frequency
dependent linewidth analysis shows a predominantly Gilbert type damping in the
bilayers and the corresponding effective spin-mixing conductance (
$g^{\uparrow\downarrow}_{\mathrm{eff}} \approx 4.8 \times 10^{18}$m$^{-2}$) is
comparable to that of other high-performance antiferromagnetic
heterostructures. These results are significant for establishing NCAFs as a
candidate material for spin generation and highlights the potential of
Py/Mn$_3$Pt bilayers for efficient and ultrafast spintronic applications.

Oxygen vacancies play a crucial role in controlling the physical properties
of complex oxides. In La0.7Sr0.3MnO3-{\delta}, the topotactic phase transition
from Perovskite (PV) to Brownmillerite (BM) can be triggered e.g. via oxygen
removal during thermal annealing. Here we report on a very efficient thermal
vacuum annealing method using aluminum as an oxygen getter material. The
topotactic phase transition is characterized by X-ray Diffraction which
confirms a successful transition from PV to BM in La0.7Sr0.3MnO3-{\delta} thin
films grown via physical vapor deposition. The efficiency of this method is
confirmed using La0.7Sr0.3MnO3-{\delta} micron-sized bulk powder. The
accompanying transition from the original Ferromagnetic (FM) to an
Antiferromagnetic (AF) state and the simultaneous transition from a metallic to
an insulating state is characterized using Superconducting Quantum Interference
Device (SQUID)-magnetometry and Alternating Current (AC) resistivity
measurements, respectively. The near surface manganese oxidation states are
probed by synchrotron X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy. Moreover, X-ray
Reflectivity, Atomic Force Microscopy and Scanning Transmission Electron
Microscopy reveal surface segregation and cation redistribution during the
oxygen getter assisted annealing process.

- **TL;DR**: 这篇论文提出了一种多模态测量方法，通过结合多种测量技术到单个集成平台，实现对超过100个镜钥矿元气电池设备的快速精准测量和预测。

Perovskite photovoltaic technologies are approaching commercial deployment,
yet single junction and tandem architectures both still have significant room
to improve power conversion efficiency and stability. The ability to perform
rapid screening of material quality after altering processing conditions is
critical to accelerating the optimization and commercialization of
perovskite-based technologies. Currently, researchers utilize a wide range of
stand-alone metrology tools to isolate sources of power loss throughout a
device stack, which can be slow and labor intensive. Here, we demonstrate the
use of a multimodal metrology approach to rapidly determine the maximum
achievable and predicted open circuit voltages of &gt; 100 perovskite devices
during fabrication. Acquisition of these different data are facilitated by
combining them into a single integrated measurement platform. We show that
these data and automated analysis can be used to rapidly understand and
ultimately predict quantitative trends in open circuit voltages of
state-of-the-art devices architectures. The data and automated analysis
workflow presented provides a reliable approach to quickly identify absorber
and charge transport layer combinations that can lead to improved open circuit
voltages.
