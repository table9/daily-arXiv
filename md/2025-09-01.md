- **TL;DR**: 在高温度（40-300K）和强磁场（至60T）下，在韦尔半导体碳化铁中观测到量子线性磁阻，通过关键的豫尔带空隔降低热激发保持赛德光量子化，并首次实验验证了高温声子散射导致量子极限物理的理论预测。

The realization of quantum transport effects at elevated temperatures has
long intrigued researchers due to the implications for unveiling novel physics
and developing quantum devices. In this work, we report remarkable quantum
linear magnetoresistance (LMR) in the Weyl semiconductor tellurium at high
temperatures of 40-300 K under strong magnetic fields up to 60 T. At high
fields, the Weyl band features a large energy gap between the lowest and first
Landau levels, which suppresses thermal excitation and preserves Landau
quantization at high temperatures. The LMR is observed as long as majority
carriers remain in the lowest Landau level without requiring monochromaticity,
allowing it to persist up to room temperature. The inverse relationship between
the LMR slope and temperature provides clear evidence that quantum LMR
originates from high-temperature phonon scattering in the quantum limit,
firstly demonstrating a theoretical prediction made nearly fifty years ago.
This study highlights the key role of electron-phonon interaction and reveals
an innovative quantum mechanism for achieving high-temperature LMR,
fundamentally distinct from previous findings. Our results bridge a gap in the
understanding of phonon-mediated quantum-limit physics and establish strong
magnetic fields at high temperatures as a promising platform for exploring
novel quantum phenomena.

- **TL;DR**: 研究了不同参考层材料（Co、Ni、Fe）对碳秒激光脉冲导致的磁化反转过程的影响，发现只有Co参考层能够实现并行到反并行的切换，这与参考层的超快磁化动力学特性相关

We investigate the magnetization reversal process induced by a single
femtosecond laser pulse in ferromagnetic spin valves by systematically
comparing reference layers composed of pure Co, Ni, and Fe. To circumvent the
loss of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy associated with changes in reference
layer material and thickness, we design spin valves with in plane
magnetizations. While antiparallel to parallel switching is observed for all
three elements, parallel to antiparallel switching occurs only with a Co
reference layer and is absent with Ni and Fe. This difference is attributed to
the distinct ultrafast magnetization dynamics of the reference materials. Our
results support the hypothesis that parallel to antiparallel switching requires
a rapid remagnetization of the reference layer, which generates a substantial
negative spin current polarized opposite to the free layer magnetization an
essential condition for triggering its reversal.

- **TL;DR**: 通过弱局域扰动实现Haldane自旋链边缘分数自旋的量子态远程操控，利用局域场在一端可强烈影响另一端磁化强度

We consider the remote manipulation of the quantum state of the edge
fractional spins of Haldane spin chains using a weak local perturbation on the
other edge. We derive an effective four-level model that correctly captures the
response of the local magnetization to local perturbations and we use it to
show that applying a small local field on one edge of the chain induces a
strong variation of the magnetization on the opposite edge. Using a
Landau-Zener protocol, we show how local control of the field on one edge of
the chain, implemented for instance with a spin-polarized scanning tunnel
microscope tip, can adiabatically switch the magnetization direction on the
other side of the chain.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了刷新模式SQUID-on-tip技术，结合AFM和nanoSQUID感测，能同时形成电流、磁性、散热和形势图像，无需激光器和深冷放大

Studying nanoscale dynamics is essential for understanding quantum materials
and advancing quantum chip manufacturing. Still, it remains a major challenge
to measure non-equilibrium properties such as current and dissipation, and
their relation to structure. Scanning nanoprobes utilizing superconducting
quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) are uniquely suited here, due to their
unparalleled magnetic and thermal sensitivity. Here, we introduce tapping-mode
SQUID-on-tip, which combines atomic force microscopy (AFM) with nanoSQUID
sensing. Our probes minimize nanoSQUID-sample distance, provide in-plane
magnetic sensitivity, and operate without lasers. Frequency multiplexing
enables simultaneous imaging of currents, magnetism, dissipation and
topography. The large voltage output of our proximity-junction nanoSQUIDs
allows us to resolve nanoscale currents as small as 100 nA using a simple
four-probe electronic readout without cryogenic amplification. By capturing
local magnetic, thermal, and electronic response without external radiation,
our technique offers a powerful non-invasive route to study dynamic phenomena
in exotic materials and delicate quantum circuits.

### Fast Methods For Multisite Charge Transfer Processes I: Constrained, State Averaged CASSCF(1,M) and CASSCF(2M-1,M) Simulations

- **TL;DR**: 开发了动态权重状态平均约束CASSCF方法(eDSCn/hDSCn)来处理n个分子片段间的电子/空穴转移，通过约束优化和DIIS-SQP算法高效求解，成功应用于SSH链并验证了耦合的指数衰减特性。

We design a dynamically-weighted state-averaged constrained CASSCF to treat
\ul{e}lectrons or \ul{h}oles moving between $n$ molecular fragments (where $n$
can be larger than 2). Within such a so-called eDSCn/hDSCn approach, we
consider configurations that are mutually single excitations of each other, and
we apply a generalized set of constraints to tailor the method for studying
charge transfer problems. The constrained optimization problem is efficiently
solved using a DIIS-SQP algorithm, thus maintaining computational efficiency.
We demonstrate the method for a finite Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain,
successfully reproducing the expected exponential decay of diabatic couplings
with distance. When combined with a gradient, the current extension immediately
enables efficient nonadiabatic dynamics simulations of complex multi-state
charge transfer processes.

### Hybrid Quantum-Classical Simulations of Graphene Analogues: Adsorption Energetics Beyond DFT

- **TL;DR**: 开发了一种混合量子-经典计算框架，将MCSCF与VQE结合，用于处理强关联系统的电子结构计算，在石墨烯类似物与水的相互作用以及过渡金属结合能预测方面取得了化学精度的结果。

Understanding strongly correlated systems is essential for advancing quantum
chemistry and materials science, yet conventional methods like Density
Functional Theory (DFT) often fail to capture their complex electronic
behavior. To address these limitations, we develop a hybrid quantum-classical
framework that integrates Multiconfigurational Self Consistent Field (MCSCF)
with the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE). Our initial benchmarks on water
dissociation enabled the systematic optimization of key computational
parameters, including ansatz selection, active space construction, and error
mitigation. Building on this, we extend our approach to investigate the
interactions between graphene analogues and water, demonstrating that our
framework produces binding energies consistent with high accuracy quantum
methods. Furthermore, we apply this methodology to predict the binding energies
of transition metals (Fe, Co, Ni) on both pristine and defective graphene
analogues, revealing strong charge transfer effects and pronounced
multireference character phenomena often misrepresented by standard DFT. In
contrast to many existing quantum algorithms that are constrained to small
molecular systems, our framework achieves chemically accurate predictions for
larger, strongly correlated systems such as metal graphene complexes. This
advancement highlights the capacity of hybrid quantum-classical approaches to
address complex electronic interactions and demonstrates a practical route
toward realizing quantum advantage for real world materials applications in the
Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) era.

### Unconventional superconducting correlations in fermionic many-body scars

- **TL;DR**: 该论文在双轨道晶格系统中构建了动态退耦的量子疤痕子空间，这些子空间具有强超导配对关联特性，包含自旋单态和三重态配对，由群不变量子多体疤痕态张成。

Weak ergodicity breaking in interacting quantum systems may occur due to the
existence of a subspace dynamically decoupled from the rest of the Hilbert
space. In two-orbital spinful lattice systems, we construct such subspaces that
are in addition distinguished by strongest inter-orbital and spin-singlet or
spin-triplet, long-range superconducting pairing correlations. All
unconventional pairing types we consider are local in space and unitary.
Alternatively to orbitals, the additional degree of freedom could originate
from the presence of two layers or through any other mechanism. Required
Hamiltonians are rather non-exotic and include chemical potential, Hubbard, and
spin-orbit interactions typically used for two-orbital superconducting
materials. Each subspace is spanned by a family of group-invariant quantum
many-body scars combining both 2e and 4e pairing/clustering contributions. One
of the basis states has the form of a BCS wavefunction and can always be made
the ground state by adding a mean-field pairing potential. Analytical results
in this work are lattice-, dimension- and (mostly) system size-independent. We
confirm them by exact numerical diagonalization in small systems.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了基于赝势平面波的刚性muffin-tin近似(RMTA)实现，为超导体高通量筛选提供高效计算工具

We present a pseudopotential-based plane-wave implementation of the rigid
muffin-tin approximation (RMTA), offering a computationally efficient
alternative to its traditional use in all-electron codes. This approach enables
the evaluation of angular-momentum-resolved electron-phonon matrix elements and
McMillan-Hopfield parameters of not only elemental transition metals but also
their compounds. The results are benchmarked against full-potential linearized
augmented plane wave calculations, showing excellent agreement. We further
outline a practical route to extract atom- and symmetry-type-resolved
electron-phonon coupling constants. By enabling the use of RMTA descriptors
within high-throughput workflows, this framework significantly lowers the
computational cost of screening candidate superconductors, providing a valuable
tool for materials discovery.

### Nonlinear refrigerator with a finite-sized cold heat bath

- **TL;DR**: 研究有限尺寸冷热源与无限尺寸热源之间的非线性响应制冷机性能优化

We study the refrigerator working between a finite-sized cold heat bath and
an infinite-sized hot heat bath (environment) in the nonlinear response regime.
We assume that the initial temperature $T_i$ of the finite-sized cold heat bath
satisfies $T_i\leq T_h$, where $T_h$ is the temperature of the hot heat bath.
By consuming the input power, the refrigerator transfers the heat from a
finite-sized cold heat bath to the hot heat bath. Hence, the temperature of the
finite-sized cold heat bath decreases until it reaches the desired
low-temperature $T_f$. By minimizing the input work for the heat transport
process, we derive the optimal path for temperature change. We calculate the
coefficient of performance as a function of average input power. We also obtain
the bounds for the coefficient of performance by applying the asymmetric
dissipation limits.

### The crystalline properties of silica biomorphs vary within and between morphologies

- **TL;DR**: 使用X射线纹理和衍射断层扫描技术研究硅酸钡生物形态的3D晶体结构，揭示了不同形态间的生长模式差异以及单个结构内部的晶体性质变化

Silica-carbonate biomorphs are a class of emergent materials, i.e. composite
microstructures made of nanometric carbonate crystallites surrounded by
amorphous silica. They form via a co-precipitation process in an interplay
between alkaline earth metal carbonate and siliceous species, and self-organize
into a multitude of shapes with a distinct long-range order of the carbonate
nanocrystals. Biomorphs are frequently studied to understand the formation of
life-like structures emerging from geochemical processes at extreme conditions.
Further, due to their optical properties they lend themselves as a platform for
optical, electronic or magnetic functionalization. A big hurdle in this task is
our incomplete understanding of the underlying formation process and how the
interplay between synthesis parameters affects important nanoscale properties
such as crystalline structure and texture, as well as the shape on the
microscale. Here, we use X-ray texture and diffraction tomography to unveil the
local crystalline texture in 3D of silica-witherite biomorphs. We find
surprisingly different growth motifs across different morphologies, but also
that the crystalline properties vary significantly within a single structure.
We distinguish different growth regimes and from that, infer how the
co-precipitating silica shapes the crystalline particles. Thereby, we gain
deeper insight into how biomorphs form these distinct complex morphologies.

### High fidelity flopping-mode single spin operation with tuning inter-dot orbital levels

- **TL;DR**: 通过调控三重量子点中间间旋转能带耦合和使用机器学习反馈控制，在GaAs量子点中实现了高保真度的旋氧子操控，达到超过100 MHz的Rabi频率和99.7%的门保真度

Fast spin manipulation and long spin coherence time in quantum dots are
essential features for high fidelity semiconductor spin qubits. However,
generally it has not been well established how to optimize these two properties
simultaneously, because these two properties are usually not independent from
each other. Therefore, the scheme for high fidelity operation by simultaneous
tuning Rabi frequency and coherence time, which does not rely on the
material-dependent strong spin-orbit interaction and the local magnetic field
gradient limiting their scalability, are strongly demanded. Here, we
demonstrate an approach to achieve high-fidelity spin control by tuning
inter-dot spin-orbit coupling in a GaAs triple quantum dot (TQD), where the
third dot provides precise control over orbital energy levels. In an
electrically stable charge state with optimized tunnel coupling, we achieve
Rabi frequencies exceeding 100 MHz while maintaining coherence through proper
tuning of the inter-dot orbital levels of the TQD. By implementing a machine
learning-based feedback control that efficiently estimates qubit frequency
using past measurement data, we characterize and mitigate the impact of low
frequency noise on qubit coherence with minimal measurement overhead. Finally,
we demonstrate a $\pi$/2 gate fidelity of 99.7\% with a gate time of 4 ns
through randomized benchmarking, even in a GaAs quantum dot device where
electron spin coherence is typically limited by strong hyperfine interaction
with nuclear spins. Our approach provides a scalable strategy for high-fidelity
spin control in semiconductor quantum dot arrays by utilizing device-specific
parameters rather than relying on material properties or external field
gradients.

### Fast Methods For Multisite Charge Transfer Processes II: Analytic Nuclear Gradients and Nonadiabatic Dynamics For cCASSCF(1,M) and cCASSCF(2M-1,M) Wavefunctions

We derive and implement analytic nuclear gradients and derivative couplings
for a constrained Complete Active Space Self-Consistent Field with a small
active space designed to model electron or hole transfer. Using a Lagrangian
formalism, we are able to differentiate both the CASSCF energy and the
constraint (which is required for globally smooth surfaces), and the resulting
efficient algorithm can be immediately applied to nonadiabatic dynamics
simulations of charge transfer processes. Here, we run initial surface-hopping
simulations of a proton coupled electron transfer event for a phenoxyl-phenol
system.

### Convex Hartree-Fock theory: A simple framework for ground state conical intersections

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种改进的Hartree-Fock框架（Convex Hartree-Fock），通过在定制子空间中优化参考态来准确模拟锥形交叉，解决了传统单参考方法在此类问题上的局限性。

Accurate modeling of conical intersections is crucial in nonadiabatic
molecular dynamics, as these features govern processes such as radiationless
transitions and photochemical reactions. Conventional electronic structure
methods, including Hartree-Fock, density functional theory, and their
time-dependent extensions, struggle in this regime. Due to their single
reference nature and separate treatment of ground and excited states, they fail
to capture ground state intersections. Multiconfigurational approaches overcome
these limitations, but at a prohibitive computational cost. In this work, we
propose a modified Hartree-Fock framework, referred to as Convex Hartree-Fock,
that optimizes the reference within a tailored subspace by removing projections
along selected Hessian eigenvectors. The ground and excited states are then
obtained through subsequent Hamiltonian diagonalization. We validate the
approach across several test cases and benchmark its performance against
time-dependent Hartree-Fock within the Tamm-Dancoff approximation.

### Charge density wave induced gapped nodal line

We investigate the interplay between charge density wave (CDW) order and
topological nodal-line states in square-net materials. Our Ginzburg-Landau
theory predicts a CDW instability that generically opens a gap at the Fermi
energy while preserving the nodal line crossing. However, as the Fermi level
approaches the nodal line, the density of states at the nodal line decreases,
eventually disappearing as the CDW vector $\mathbf{Q}$ goes to zero. Exactly at
$\mathbf{Q} = 0$, the order parameter explicitly breaks the glide symmetry
protecting the nodal line, which allows a gap to open. Yet, for small but
finite $\mathbf{Q}$, the nodal line may vanish within experimental resolution
even when the glide symmetry is preserved. Our results provide a consistent
explanation for recent experimental observations.

- **TL;DR**: 对过掺杂单层铜酸盐Pb-Bi2201的光诱导瞬态反射动力学研究，发现在赝能隙终点附近出现量子临界行为特征

A comprehensive study of photoinduced transient reflectivity dynamics in
heavily overdoped single-layer cuprate (Bi,Pb)$_{2}$Sr$_{2}$CuO$_{6+\delta}$
(Pb-Bi2201), across the end points of the pseudogap and superconducting phases,
has been conducted using optical ultrafast time-resolved pump-probe
spectroscopy. In the Pb-Bi2201 just before reaching the pseudogap end point,
the transient reflectivity dynamics above $T_{{\rm c}}$ resemble the pseudogap
response observed in optimally doped La-Bi2201. At low temperatures, however,
the relaxation time exhibits a power-law divergence,
$\tau\sim10\hbar/k_{\mathrm{B}}T$, signaling quantum critical behavior at the
pseudogap end point doping. A similar power-law increase in relaxation time is
also observed in Pb-Bi2201 just beyond the pseudogap doping end point, though
it is less pronounced.

### Critical and quasicritical behavior in a three-species dynamical model of semi-directed percolation

We investigate a three-species dynamical model whose dynamics naturally
generate the semi-directed percolation cluster and show a non-equilibrium
absorbing state phase transition from an active to inactive state. The critical
threshold and exponents associated with the dynamic process are determined
using Monte Carlo simulations. Critical behavior observed shows that the model
belongs to the directed percolation (DP) universality class. Further, we
consider the effect of spontaneous activity generation in the dynamical model.
While this destroys the usual critical behaviour, we find that the dynamic
susceptibility shows a maximum at a specific value of the control parameter,
indicating a quasi-critical behaviour, similar to the findings in the case of
DP models and DP-inspired models of neuronal activity with spontaneous activity
generation. Interestingly, in the presence of spontaneous activity, we find
that spatial and temporal correlations exhibit power-law decays at a value of
the control parameter different from the quasi-critical threshold indicating
that there are two effective thresholds in such a case, one where the response
function is maximum and another where the spatial and temporal correlations
show scale free behaviour.

- **TL;DR**: 通过密度函数理论模拟[XM(COD)Cl]2系统的电子结构，将计算谱与实验X光光电子谱直接对比，以研究X光辐射对材料的损坏机制

Theoretical calculations of materials have in recent years shown promise in
facilitating the analysis of convoluted experimental data. This is particularly
invaluable in complex systems or for materials subject to certain environmental
conditions, such as those exposed to X-ray radiation during routine
characterisation. Despite the clear benefit in this use case to shed further
light on intermolecular damage processes, the use of theory to study radiation
damage of samples is still not commonplace, with very few studies in existing
literature. In this paper, we demonstrate the potential of density functional
theory for modelling the electronic structure of two industrially important
organometallic systems of the formula [M(COD)Cl]$_2$ where M=Ir/Rh and
COD=1,5-cyclooctadiene, which are subject to X-ray irradiation via X-ray
Diffraction and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy. Our approach allows
calculated spectra to be compared directly to experimental data, in this case,
the X-ray photoelectron valence band spectra, enabling the valuable correlation
of individual atomic states to the electronic structure.

### Topological Magnon Frequency Combs

Exploring the synergy between topological physics and nonlinear dynamics
unveils profound insights into emergent states of matter. Inspired by recent
experimental demonstrations of topological frequency combs in photonics, we
theoretically introduce topological magnon frequency combs (MFCs) in a
two-dimensional triangular skyrmion lattice. Computing the Chern numbers of
magnon bands reveals robust chiral edge states. Strikingly, these topological
MFCs originate from nonlinear four-magnon scattering among the chiral edge
modes, activated by dual-frequency driving without an amplitude threshold. Comb
spacings are readily tunable through excitation frequency detuning.
Micromagnetic simulations validate our predictions with good concordance. This
work paves the way for defect-immune magnonic devices exploiting MFCs and

This paper presents a porting of DG-SWEM, a discontinuous Galerkin solver for
coastal ocean circulation, and in particular storm surge, to GPU using two
separate approaches: CUDA Fortran and OpenACC. Time-explicit discontinuous
Galerkin methods have been shown to exhibit a large amount of data parallelism
due to the loose coupling between elements, and thus are naturally mapped to
the GPU architecture. For each porting approach, we discuss the code design,
ease of programming, and performance when running on realistic use cases.
Specifically for the OpenACC version, we also aim to preserve maintainability
within the same codebase through using Unified Memory. We test the codes on
NVIDIA's Grace Hopper chip and compare the GPU performance on each node to the
MPI version on a single CPU node (144 cores).

Singlet Fission (SF) into two triplets offers exciting avenues for
high-efficiency photovoltaics and optically initializable qubits. While the
chemical space of SF chromophores is ever-expanding, the mechanistic details of
electronic-nuclear motions that dictate the photophysics are unclear. Rigid SF
dimers with well-defined orientations are necessary to decipher such details.
Here, using polarization-controlled white-light two-dimensional and pump-probe
spectroscopies, we investigate a new class of contorted naphthalenediimide
dimers, recently reported to have a favorable intramolecular SF (iSF) pathway.
2D cross-peaks between the two Davydov components and strongly
wavelength-dependent TT1 formation kinetics together implicate a coherently
coupled excimer-like intermediate. Enhanced quantum beats in the TT1
photoproduct suggest that inter-chromophore twisting and ruffling motions drive
the ~200 fs evolution towards excimer-like intermediate and the subsequent ~2
ps relaxation to the TT1 photoproduct. Polarization anisotropy directly tracks
electronic motion during these steps and reveals surprisingly minimal
electronic reorientation with significant singlet-triplet mixing throughout the
nuclear evolution away from the Franck-Condon geometry towards relaxed TT1. The
combination of white-light 2DES and polarization anisotropy experiments
presented here lends powerful insights for refinement of the existing
theoretical models for iSF, and lays the foundation for a broader mechanistic
investigation of iSF across various molecular platforms.

- **TL;DR**: 本文提出了一种位移场D控制的超导-铁磁相变机制，在二维自旋轨道耦合六角系统中，当范霍夫奇点位于费米能级时，通过简单的VHS-only模型和重整化群方法，预测了从手性d/p波超导到谷铁磁相的转变。

Recent experiments have observed transitions between superconductivity and
correlated magnetism in twisted bilayer WSe$_2$ near van-Hove fillings, driven
by the displacement field $D$. Motivated by the experiment, we theoretically
propose a general mechanism for a $D$-controlled transition between
superconductivity and ferromagnetism in two-dimensional (2D) spin-orbit-coupled
hexagonal systems, where van Hove singularities (VHS) lie on the Fermi level.
We show that such a transition can be naturally captured by a simple VHS-only
model without Fermi surface details, where the inter-VHS interactions that
govern the Fermi surface instabilities is controlled by $D$ through the band
projection of screened Coulomb interaction. By treating this simple model with
renormalization group technique beyond mean-field level, we find that a chiral
$d/p$-wave superconductivity naturally dominates under a weak displacement
field $D&lt;D_c$. At a stronger displacement field $D&gt;D_c$, a \textit{valley
ferromagnetic phase} (vFM) takes over, which is spatially non-uniform due to
valley-modulated magnetization. Finally, we discuss generic conditions for the
predicted superconductivity-to-ferromagnetism transition to take place in the
rich family of few-layer hexagonal van der Waals material systems. Taking
twisted bilayer WSe$_2$ as a case study, we discuss experimental detections
that can falsify our prediction.

### Edge dependent Josephson Diode effect in WTe$_{2}$-Based Josephson junction

The Josephson diode effect (JDE), a nonreciprocal supercurrent, is a
cornerstone for future dissipationless electronics, yet achieving high
efficiency in a simple device architecture remains a significant challenge.
Here, we theoretically investigate the JDE in a junction based on monolayer
1T'-WTe$_2$. We first establish that different edge terminations of a WTe$_2$
nanoribbon lead to diverse electronic band structures, some of which host
asymmetric edge states even with crystallographically equivalent terminations.
This intrinsic asymmetry provides a natural platform for realizing the JDE.
With a WTe$_2$-based Josephson junction, we demonstrate a significant JDE
arising purely from these asymmetric edges when time-reversal symmetry is
broken by a magnetic flux. While the efficiency of this edge-state-driven JDE
is inherently limited, we discover a crucial mechanism for its enhancement: by
tuning the chemical potential into the bulk bands, the interplay between edge
and bulk transport channels boosts the maximum diode efficiency more than
$50\%$. Furthermore, we show that this enhanced JDE is robust against moderate
edge disorder. Our findings not only propose a novel route to achieve a highly
efficient JDE using intrinsic material properties but also highlight the
potential of engineered WTe$_2$ systems for developing advanced superconducting
quantum devices.

The general, multidimensional barrier crossing problem for diffusive
processes under the action of conservative forces is studied with the goal of
developing tractable approximations. Particular attention is given to the
effect of different statistical interpretations of the stochastic differential
equation and to the relation between the approximations and the known, exact
solutions to the one-dimensional problem. Beginning with a reasonable, but
heuristic, simplifying assumption, a one-dimensional solution to the problem is
developed. This is then simplified by introducing further approximations
resulting in a sequence of increasingly simple expressions culminating in the
classic result of Langer(Ann. Phys. 54, 258 (1969)) and others. The various
approximations are tested on two dimensional problems by comparison to
simulation results and it is found that the one-dimensional approximations
capture most of the non-Arrhenius dependence on the energy barrier which is
lost in the Langer approximation while still converging to the latter in the
large-barrier limit.

- **TL;DR**: 本文研究通过X射衍射技术测量动态压缩材料的应变状态，对比了水静压力和单轴变形两种模型的差异，获得了多种金属材料在高压下的压缩比和应变数据。

Dynamically compressed materials in longitudinal waves are described by two
physical models: hydrostatic pressure, with equal, normal, principal stresses
or material uniaxially strained in the wave propagation direction. These models
are disparate, so experimental comparisons and evaluations are important.
Polycrystalline material in a state of hydrostatic pressure, will have no
eccentricity of X-ray diffracted Debye-Scherrer rings. A general
three-dimensional solution of Bragg diffracted X-rays based on principal
crystallographic strains in the compression wave was found. The distortion of
X-ray diffraction beams has been used for strain measurements; the analysis
developed incorporates a strained reciprocal lattice and the incident X-ray
beam. Strain distorted Polanyi surfaces form an annulus of compression with an
ellipsoid of revolution in reciprocal space which is intersected by Ewald
sphere for Bragg diffraction. The in-situ measurements for strain describe
nanosecond diffraction evaluated using two planes, and both in the same
crystallographic phase. Diffraction from Al, Ni, Na, and Invar quantify the
compression axial strains in these materials: the compression axial ratios are
0.65, 1.05, 0.88 and 1.58 at pressures of 291, 402, 409, and 367 GPa for the
respective materials. Crystal structure transformations with homogeneous
pressurized stresses, mandating equal normal strains, should not be anticipated
to agree with heterogeneous, uniaxially strained and sheared crystalline
phases. Measurements support in-plane strains increasing with pressure, p, in
fcc and hcp aluminum as with p in GPa.

### Control of growth morphology of deposited fcc metals through tuning substrate-metal interactions

Precise control over thin film morphology is critical for optimizing material
properties across diverse technological applications, as the growth mode
(whether 2D layer-by-layer or 3D island formation)determines key functional
properties such as electrical conductivity in CMOS interconnect applications
and catalytic activity, where island distribution and size dictate performance.
To explore the role of the substrate on the morphology of deposited metals, we
present extensive kinetic Monte Carlo simulations on six fcc metals growing in
the (111) direction: Ag, Au, Cu, Ni, Pd and Pt. Our simulation framework
enables screening and evaluation of their growth mode under homoepitaxial
growth scenarios and proposes morphology control strategies by variation of
substrate-metal interaction strengths, modeled by modifying the activation
energies for upward and downward migration, combined with thermal vacuum
annealing within typical back end of line (BEOL) integration thermal budget.
Our simulation results demonstrate that modulation of the substrate interaction
strength can be effectively employed to promote island formation or
layer-by-layer growth modes overcoming limitations in achieving large flat
surface areas. Au, Pd and Pt exhibit the highest sensitivity to substrate
interaction strength variations, followed by Ag, showing that strongly
interacting substrates decrease the root mean square (RMS) roughness,
(uncovered) substrate exposure, island number and island aspect ratios, with
moderate increases in flat surface areas and atomic coordination numbers.
Additionally, interconnect relevant metrics are improved through thermal vacuum
annealing particularly when sufficiently strong metal-substrate interactions
are employed, reducing surface roughness, achieving larger flat surface areas,
merging and smoothing islands, and decreasing defect density...

- **TL;DR**: 通过建立具有反转对称性的单味道平坡带模型，证明地方吸引作用能够产生准确的超导基态，为矩形石墨炭中的超嫻性提供理论解释

Recent experiments have reported the surprising observation of
superconductivity in flavor polarized, nearly flat bands (FBs) of rhombohedral
graphene. Motivated by these findings, we introduce a class of models for
single-flavor FBs with inversion symmetry, where we show a local attractive
interaction between orbitals with opposite parities leads to an exact
superconducting ground state. We argue that this model can be relevant to
realistic multi-flavor systems including short-range repulsion, since the main
effect of such repulsion is to induce flavor polarization leaving possibly
attractive residual interaction between different flavorless orbitals. The
nature of the pairing is determined by the interplay between the FB quantum
geometry and the interaction, and is often topological when the parent FB is
so. Interestingly, each such model has two nearly degenerate pairing modes,
whose energetic competition can be tuned by a change in the charge transfer gap
between the two orbitals or electron density. These modes have the same angular
momentum but different pairing amplitude structure and possibly different
topology. We show that the superfluid stiffness is proportional to the
attractive interaction scale using a combination of analytical variational
upper bounds and numerical bootstrap lower bounds. We find empirically that the
maximum superfluid stiffness is achieved when the hot spots of quantum geometry
in the Brillouin zone are marginally filled.

### Odd-Parity Magnetism in Fe-Based Superconductors

Odd-parity magnetism constitutes an intriguing phase of matter which breaks
inversion symmetry while preserving time-reversal symmetry. Here we demonstrate
that the Fe-based superconductors exhibiting coplanar magnetic order realize an
odd-parity magnetic state by combining low-energy modeling with
density-functional theory. In the absence of spin-orbit coupling, the
electronic spins are polarized along the $k_z$-direction and the splitting of
the up and down states exhibits an $h$-wave form-factor. The magnitude of the
splitting depends sensitively on specific parameters of the low-energy model,
including specific out-of-plane hopping parameters and the Fermi energies of
the hole- and electron-pockets. Interestingly, despite this state breaking
inversion symmetry and exhibiting a finite out-of-plane Berry curvature and
non-linear anomalous Hall effect, the Edelstein effect vanishes. Incorporating
spin-orbit coupling tilts the momentum-space electronic spins into the
($k_x,k_y$)-plane and imparts finite in-plane components to the Edelstein
response. Our findings highlight the Fe-based superconductors as platforms for
exploring odd-parity magnetism both on its own and coexisting with
unconventional superconductivity.

We propose a four-stroke quantum thermal machine based on the 1D anyon
Hubbard model, which is capable of extracting the excess energy arising from
anyon exclusion statistics at low temperature into finite work. Defining a
hybrid anyon-Otto (HAO) cycle, we find that the low temperature work, in the
absence of any interactions, is maximised in the pseudo fermionic limit, where
the anyons most closely resemble free fermions. However, when weak interactions
are introduced, the work output is no longer maximized at the bosonic or
pseudo-fermionic extremes, but instead peaks at intermediate statistical
angles. This clearly demonstrates that interactions and anyonic statistics
conspire non-trivially to enhance performance, with interacting anyons offering
greater quantum thermodynamic advantage than either bosons or pseudo-fermions,
in this regime. Furthermore, we also identify different modes of operation of
the HAO cycle, one of which emerges as a direct consequence of the finite anyon
energy at low temperature.

The failure of mechanical metamaterials is a function of the interplay
between the properties of the base material and the microstructural geometry.
Stochastic failure properties of the base material and disordered
microstructural geometries can contribute to variations in the global failure
mechanics that are not captured in traditional analyses of ordered,
deterministic architected materials. We present a probabilistic framework that
couples stochastic material failure and geometric disorder to predict failure
in lattice mechanical metamaterials. These predictions are verified through
finite element analysis, which confirm that disorder and stochasticity affect
both the mean and variance of the damage initiation load in a lattice, with
average failure loads being generally reduced and variance increasing with
higher levels of disorder and stochasticity. The fracto-cohesive length and
representative volume element size are also predicted and constrain the minimum
defect and lattice sizes, respectively, for failure to be considered a fracture
process. The framework is extended to consider the fracture behavior of the
lattice, the development of damage zones, and their impact on the steady-state
fracture toughness.

We theoretically study the role of electron-electron interactions in
one-dimensional magnetized helical states coupled to an s-wave superconductor.
We consider a partially mixed helical (superhelical) regime, where the magnetic
field (superconductivity) has a dominant contribution. Using bosonization and
renormalization group techniques, it is shown how the interactions affect the
correlation functions in the system. In the partially mixed helical regime, we
find that superconducting pairing promotes spin-density-wave correlations,
while singlet and triplet pairing correlations suppress, especially under
attractive interactions. In contrast, in the superhelical regime, a
perturbative Zeeman field enhances both spin singlet and spin triplet-x
pairings under repulsive interactions. We calculate both logarithmic and
residual corrections to charge-density-wave, spin-density-wave, and pairing
correlations, revealing short- and long-range behaviors. We further investigate
spin transport properties supplemented by a renormalization group analysis of
the temperature and frequency dependence of spin conductivity. We also analyze
the transport of momentum-spin-locked carriers in the presence of
Zeeman-induced and pairing-induced gaps, uncovering the effect of interactions
and the interplay between the two gaps in helical systems.

Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have revolutionized
computational materials science by bridging the gap between quantum mechanical
accuracy and classical simulation efficiency, enabling unprecedented
exploration of materials properties across the periodic table. Despite their
remarkable success in predicting bulk properties, no systematic evaluation has
assessed how well these universal MLIPs (uMLIPs) can predict cleavage energies,
a critical property governing fracture, catalysis, surface stability, and
interfacial phenomena. Here, we present a comprehensive benchmark of 19
state-of-the-art uMLIPs for cleavage energy prediction using our previously
established density functional theory (DFT) database of 36,718 slab structures
spanning elemental, binary, and ternary metallic compounds. We evaluate diverse
architectural paradigms, analyzing their performance across chemical
compositions, crystal systems, thickness, and surface orientations. Our results
reveal that training data composition dominates architectural sophistication:
models trained on the Open Materials 2024 (OMat24) dataset, which emphasizes
non-equilibrium configurations, achieve mean absolute percentage errors below
6% and correctly identify the thermodynamically most stable surface
terminations in 87% of cases, without any explicit surface energy training. In
contrast, architecturally identical models trained on equilibrium-only datasets
show five-fold higher errors, while models trained on surface-adsorbate data
fail catastrophically with a 17-fold degradation. Remarkably, simpler
architectures trained on appropriate data achieve comparable accuracy to
complex transformers while offering 10-100x computational speedup. These
findings show that the community should focus on strategic training data
generation that captures the relevant physical phenomena.

The quantum many-electron problem is not just at the heart of condensed
matter phenomena, but also essential for first-principles simulation of
chemical phenomena. Strong correlation in chemical systems are prevalent and
present a formidable challenge in the simulation of these systems, while
predictive phenomena in this domain often also requires a demanding level of
accuracy to inform chemical behavior. Efficient representations of the
many-electron states of chemical systems are therefore also being inspired by
machine learning principles to provide an alternative to established
approaches. In this chapter, we review recent progress in this endeavor for
quantum chemical problems represented in second quantization, and the
particular challenges present in this field. In particular, we focus on the
application of Gaussian Process States emerging from efficient representations
of the many-body wavefunction with rigorous Bayesian modeling frameworks,
allowing for the unification of multiple paradigms under a common umbrella. We
show how such models (and other representations derived from machine learning)
can be used as novel tools to compute ab initio chemical properties, while in
turn also informing the design of machine learning models to extract
correlation patterns in classical data.

We investigate the dispersions of anyon quasi-particles in the Kitaev
honeycomb spin-liquid perturbed by $\Gamma$ and $\Gamma'$ couplings in order to
understand phase transitions into competing states through anyon gap-closing
instabilities. We demonstrate how anyon gap closings allow to understand phase
transitions into a plethora of previously identified competing phases --
including zigzag, stripy, $120^\circ$, and incommensurate spiral phases -- and
are in agreement with numerical studies not only on the nature of the phases,
but also on the specific critical values of $\Gamma$ and $\Gamma'$ couplings.
Remarkably, when the anti-ferromagnetic Kitaev model is perturbed by an
ferromagnetic $\Gamma$ interaction, we find that the single-vison and fermion
gaps remain open while the gap of a magnon-like local boson vanishes, implying
that the resulting state has coexistence of a spontaneous broken symmetry and
the fractionalization pattern of the Kitaev spin liquid. The magnetic
long-range order could be either a stripy antiferromagnet or an incommensurate
spiral, depending on the sign of $\Gamma'$.

Superconducting electronics offer significant advantages in speed and power
efficiency for next-generation computing and communication systems. However,
their practical deployment is limited by the absence of simple, efficient, and
scalable superconducting counterparts to key semiconductor components. In this
work, we investigate diodes based on planar Josephson junctions fabricated from
a conventional niobium superconductor. The nonreciprocity in these diodes
arises from the self-field effect induced by the geometrical asymmetry of the
junction. By deliberate tuning of the junction parameters, we achieved
effectively infinite nonreciprocity (within experimental resolution),
characterized by a complete suppression of the superconducting critical current
in one direction while maintaining a significant current in the opposite
direction. The key novelty of this work lies in the demonstration of the
optical diode effect. We observed threshold-free rectification of 75 GHz
microwave radiation, indicating that these diodes exhibit near-ideal optical
nonreciprocity. Our results open new avenues for ultrafast superconducting
electronics and lay the groundwork for wireless sub-THz signal processing.

transport harboring chiral anomaly, negative magnetoresistance, and Majorana
zero modes. While FAs were observed in exemplary Weyl semimetal TaAs and
Co3Sn2S2, the manipulation of FAs has been rarely explored. Here we take
Co3Sn2S2 as an example and demonstrate that tuning the electronic correlation
strength is an effective way to control the topology and connectivity of FAs.
After achieving a good agreement with experimentally measured band structure by
employing combined density functional theory and dynamical mean field theory
(DFT+DMFT) calculations, we show that the experimental charge dynamics are well
reproduced by DFT+DMFT calculations but not DFT calculations. Electronic
correlation renormalizes the bands around the Fermi level and modifies the
energy and location of Weyl points, and the resulting FAs. In particular, on
the Co-terminated surface, the FAs are formed by connecting Weyl points located
in adjacent Brillouin zones in DFT+DMFT calculations and experiments, in strong
contrast to the FAs connecting Weyl points within the same Brillouin zone in
DFT calculations. We further show the evolution of FAs with correlation and
reveal a topological change of the FAs on the Sn-terminated surface at stronger
correlation strength. Our study sheds new light on experimental manipulation of
FAs to improve the electronic properties of correlated Weyl semimetals.

The heterointerfaces at complex oxides have emerged as a promising platform
for discovering novel physical phenomena and advancing integrated sensing,
storage, and computing technologies. Nevertheless, achieving precise control
over a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in a ferroelectric oxide-based
field-effect transistor (FET) configuration remains challenging. Here, we
firstly demonstrate a tunable 2DEG system fabricated by depositing an amorphous
LaAlO3(LAO) film onto a (001)-oriented ferroelectric potassium tantalate
niobate substrate. Interfaces grown under high-temperature and
high-oxygen-pressure conditions exhibit a good metallic conduction. Notably,
well-defined metallic 2DEGs displaying pronounced hysteresis and persistent
electric-field-modulated resistance are observed below 108 K, achieving a
resistance modulation of 11.6% at 7 K. These results underscore the potential
for extending such behavior to other oxide-based 2DEG systems and facilitate
further exploration of ferroelectric metals in complex oxide heterostructures.

### Nonperturbative Semiclassical Spin Dynamics for Ordered Quantum Magnets

In ordered quantum magnets where interactions between elementary excitations
dominate over their kinetic energy, perturbative approaches often fail, making
non-perturbative methods essential to capture spectral features such as bound
states and the redistribution of weight within excitation continua. Although an
increasing number of experiments report anomalous spin excitation continua in
such systems, their microscopic interpretation remains an open challenge. Here,
we investigate the spin dynamics of the triangular-lattice antiferromagnet in
its 1/3-plateau phase using two complementary non-perturbative approaches:
exact diagonalization in a truncated Hilbert space for a gas of elementary
excitations (THED) and matrix product state (MPS) simulations. Alongside
cross-validation between these methods, we benchmark our results against
inelastic neutron scattering (INS) data. The THED analysis confirms the
presence of two-magnon bound states and identifies the anomalous scattering
continuum observed in both MPS and INS as a two-magnon resonance, arising from
hybridization between the bound state and the two-magnon continuum.
Furthermore, THED reveals bound states overlapping with the continuum,
enriching the interpretation of continuum anomalies. More broadly, THED
provides a robust framework for investigating anomalous spin excitation
continua and bound-state effects in other materials with gapped spectra. Its
combination of accuracy and computational efficiency makes it a powerful tool
for extracting reliable microscopic models in semiclassical regimes.

Chiral two-dimensional electron gases, which capture the electronic
properties of graphene and rhombohedral graphene systems, exhibit singular
momentum-space vortices and are susceptible to interaction-induced topological
Haldane phases. Here, we investigate pairing interactions in these
inversion-symmetric Haldane phases of chiral two-dimensional electron gases. We
demonstrate that the nontrivial band topology of the Haldane phases enhances
intra-valley (${\bf Q} = \pm 2 {\bf K_D}$) pair susceptibility relative to
inter-valley (${\bf Q} = 0$) pair susceptibility, favoring the emergence of a
lattice-scale pair-density wave order. When longitudinal acoustic phonons
mediate the pairing interaction, the system supports a chiral Kekul\`{e}
superconducting order. Our findings are relevant to superconductivity in
rhombohedral graphene and Kagome metals.

### Understanding the atomically precise evolution of the miscibility of newly prepared face-centered cubic W-Cu nanoalloys and its asymmetry

According to classical Miedema theory, reducing crystals to the order of
nanometer sizes might greatly modulate the mixing enthalpy of elements, thus
enabling the invention of a lot of new bulk-immiscible alloys. Although
numerous alloys with higher mixing enthalpies remain unexplored, this strategy
is approaching its limit, as reflected by the critical diameter of recent
alloys of 1.8 nm, which corresponds to ~150 atoms and hardly provides a
crystalline order. Future development requires not only even smaller
atomic-scale control but also a new surface energy-saving mechanism. Here, we
report the formation of W-Cu nanoalloys with a very large miscibility gap in
the bulk via the use of an atomically size-selected cluster beam source as an
example. The face-centered cubic (FCC) structure was demonstrated through
electron diffraction, which indicated a lattice constant of 3.88{\AA} for
W0.85Cu0.15 nanoalloys (~2280 atoms). In this comprehensive study that covers a
large parameter space of W/Cu compositions and numbers of atoms, an asymmetric
miscibility nanophase diagram in which W-rich compositions favor mixing and the
critical size is approximately 6000 atoms, which far exceeds the approximately
tens of atoms predicted via classical theory, was obtained for the first time.
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed a mutual strain-induced
mechanism that simultaneously lowers the surface energies while reducing the
size to the atomic scale. This approach paves the way for the development of
new high-performance nonequilibrium phase alloys.

### Anharmonic Collective Oscillations in Isotropic Spin Systems and their Spectroscopic Signatures

Spin waves are the fundamental excitations in magnetically ordered spin
systems and are ubiquitously observed in magnetic materials. However, the
standard understanding of spin waves as collective spin oscillations in an
effective harmonic potential does not consider the possibility of soft modes,
such as those due to an effective quartic potential. In this work, we show that
such quartic potentials arise under very general conditions in a broad class of
isotropic spin systems without a fine-tuning of the interaction parameters.
Considering models with spin spiral ground states in two and three spatial
dimensions, we numerically demonstrate that quartic amplitude spin oscillations
produce a fluctuation-induced spin-wave gap which grows with temperature
according to a characteristic power-law. In conjunction with a phenomenological
theory, the present work provides a general theoretical framework for
describing soft spin modes, extending the previously discussed spin dynamics in
the presence of order-by-disorder, and highlighting the important role of
finite-size effects. Our predictions of a temperature-dependent gap in spiral
spin systems could be tested in inelastic neutron scattering experiments,
providing direct spectroscopic evidence for thermal effects arising from soft
spin modes in magnetic materials.

The precise understanding of adsorption energetics and molecular geometry at
catalytic sites is fundamental for advancing catalysis, particularly under the
constraints of resource efficiency and environmental sustainability. This study
benchmarks the performance of density functional theory (DFT) calculations
against diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) calculations for adsorption properties of
small gas molecules relevant to CO oxidation -- namely O$_2$, CO, CO$_2$, and
atomic oxygen -- on a single Pt atom supported by pristine graphene. Our
findings reveal that DMC calculations provide a significantly different
landscape of adsorption energetics compared to DFT results. Notably, DFT
predicts different lowest-energy configurations and spin states, particularly
for O$_2$, which suggests potential discrepancies in predicting the catalytic
behavior. Furthermore, this study identifies the critical issue of CO
poisoning, highlighted by the large disparity between the DMC adsorption
energies of O$_2$ ($-1.23(2)$ eV) and CO ($-3.37(1)$ eV), which can inhibit the
catalytic process. These results emphasize the necessity for more sophisticated
computational approaches in catalysis research, aiming to refine the prediction
accuracy of reaction mechanisms and to enhance the design of more effective
catalysts.

This study presents a comprehensive investigation of hybrid interfaces formed
by monolayer MoS$_2$ coupled with the organic molecules perylene (P), perylene
diimide (PDI), and perylene orange (PO). Using density functional theory, we
demonstrate the extent to which the mechanical and electronic properties of a
hybrid system can be altered by the chemical modification of a given
chromophore. The three systems exhibit distinct differences due to their
chemical composition and van der Waals contact enabled by their geometry. All
systems are structurally stable. The binding energies follow the order
PD$&gt;$P$&gt;$PO due to the large $\pi$-system (PD) and strong structural distortion
(PO). Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio exhibit pronounced anisotropy in all
cases. PO exhibits the greatest anisotropy due to steric effects and a
permanent dipole, which introduce directionality to the molecule-surface
interaction. Physisorption is accompanied by net charge transfer in the same
order as the binding energies. The associated interfacial polarization results
in a change in the work function compared to pristine MoS$_2$ in the order
P$&gt;$PO$&gt;$PD. Finally, the presence of organic molecules introduces states into
the MoS$_2$ energy gap, with the band alignment being either type II (P, PO) or
type I (PD).

- **TL;DR**: 在vdW电子化物YCl中首次实验发现了理论预言已久的骰子晶格平带结构，通过ARPES测量确认了费米能级附近的平带特征，验证了阴离子电子晶格作为实现特殊晶格几何结构的新方案

Flat electronic bands, where interactions among electrons overwhelm their
kinetic energies, hold the promise for exotic correlation physics. The dice
lattice has long been theorized as a host of flat bands with intriguing band
topology. However, to date, no material has ever been found to host the
characteristic flat bands of a dice lattice. Here, using angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we discover a dice-lattice flat band at
$E_F$ in the van der Waals (vdW) electride [YCl]$^{2+}$: 2e-. In this system,
excess valence electrons from Y deconfine from the cation framework to form an
interstitial anionic electron lattice that constitutes the dice lattice. Our
ARPES measurements unambiguously identify two sets of dice-lattice bands in
YCl, including a nearly dispersionless band at the Fermi level. The flat bands
and other dispersive bands observed in ARPES find excellent agreement with
first-principles calculations, and theoretical analysis reveals that the
near-$E_F$ electronic structure is well captured by a simple dice-lattice
model. Our findings thus end the long quest of a real dice flat band material
and establish vdW electride YCl as a prototype of dice metals. Our results
further demonstrate the anionic electron lattice as a novel scheme for
realizing lattice geometries and electronic structures rare to find in
conventional crystalline systems.

We provide an exact evaluation of the out-of-time correlation (OTOC)
functions for the localized $f$-particle states in the Falicov-Kimball model

quantum scrambling are distinguished by the winding numbers of the block
Toeplitz matrices used in the calculation. The similarities of these fermionic
OTOCs and their Lyapunov exponents for time evolution with the OTOCs for
quantum spin models with disorder are also discussed.

### Exploring the signature of two ferromagnetic states and goniopolarity in LaCrGe3 through Hall effect

LaCrGe3 has become a playground to understand quantum critical phenomena in
ferromagnetic (FM) materials. It has also garnered attention due to its
peculiar two FM phases. Here, we demonstrate the presence of these phases using
the Hall effect. Continuous temperature-dependent Hall resistivity measurements
at fixed magnetic fields clearly demonstrate the presence of these phases,
regardless of the direction of the applied magnetic field. The remanent Hall
resistivity and Hall coefficient undergo a maximum and a minimum, respectively,
at the boundary between the two phases. We observe significantly large
anomalous Hall conductivity of 1160 ohm-1cm-1 at 2 K when the magnetic field is
applied along the magnetic easy axis, which is dominated by intrinsic effects,
at least in the low-temperature FM phase. In the paramagnetic (PM) phase,
hexagonal LaCrGe3 exhibits opposite charge carrier polarities along different
crystallographic directions, attributed to the anisotropic Fermi surface
geometry, a phenomenon known as "goniopolarity". The coexistence of goniopolar
transport and unconventional magnetic phases may lead this material as a
promising candidate for future electronic devices.

Within the framework of imaginary-time evolution for matrix product states,
we introduce a cluster version of the infinite time-evolving block decimation
algorithm for simulating quantum many-body systems, addressing the
computational accuracy challenges in strongly correlated physics. By redefining
the wave-function ansatz to incorporate multiple physical degrees of freedom,
we enhance the representation of entanglement, thereby improving the accuracy
of the ground states. Utilizing the Trotter-Suzuki decomposition and optimized
truncation schemes, our method maintains roughly the same computational
complexity while capturing more quantum correlations. We apply this approach to
three nontrivial cases: the gapless spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain, the spin-1
anisotropic XXZD chain with a higher-order Gaussian-type phase transition, and
a spin-1/2 twisted triangular prism hosting a magnetic plateau phase. Improved
accuracy in physical quantities, such as magnetization, ground-state energy,
and entanglement entropy, has been demonstrated. This method provides a
scalable framework for studying complex quantum systems with high precision,
making it suitable for situations where a pure increase in bond dimension alone
cannot guarantee satisfactory results.

2H-TaS$_2$ few layers have been grown epitaxially onto GaN(0001). A high
substrate growth temperature of 825$^{\circ}$C induces best structural
properties of the overlayer, as revealed by in-situ electron diffraction (RHEED
and LEED). The 2D-overlayer grows unstrained right after deposition of a
monolayer. However, evidence of pits at the interface is provided by scanning
transmission electron microscopy, most probably due to GaN thermal
decomposition at the high growth temperature. In-situ x-ray photoemission
spectroscopy shows core level shifts that are consistently related to electron
transfer from the n-GaN(0001) to the 2H-TaS$_2$ epitaxial layer as well as the
formation of a high concentration of nitrogen vacancies close to the interface.
Further, no chemical reaction at the interface between the substrate and the
grown TaS$_2$ overlayer is deduced from XPS, which corroborates the possibility
of integration of 2D 2H-TaS$_2$ with an important 3D semiconducting material
like GaN.

We introduce the electronic structure factor as a phase-sensitive
contribution to diffraction that directly encodes the properties of the
occupied-band wave functions. In the one-dimensional SSH model,
$F_{\mathrm{cond}}$ is governed by the relative sublattice phase, which
integrates to the Zak phase. This provides a clear diffraction-based criterion
to distinguish trivial and topological regimes in the absence of any structural
change. Beyond the SSH limit, the same Bloch-based construction naturally
accounts for commensurate and incommensurate magnetic satellites in
antiferromagnets, reproducing the additional peaks at $q=G\pm Q$ observed in
NiO, MnO, chromium, and cuprates. These results demonstrate that diffraction
can probe electronic topology and magnetic ordering on equal footing, opening a
route to phase-sensitive structural characterization of correlated electron
systems.

Two-dimensional (2D) layered magnetic materials (LMMs) are a newly emerging
class of van der Waals materials, opening new opportunities to study
magneto-excitonic coupling. The air-stable, structurally and optically
anisotropic A-type antiferromagnetic chromium sulfur bromide (CrSBr) is one of
the most prominent examples of such LMMs. We investigate photoluminescence (PL)
and PL excitation of mono- to tri-layers CrSBr and find that it exhibits a
unique duplexity, supporting both Frenkel- and Wannier-Mott-like excitons. Our
magneto-optical experiments reveal a similar excitonic response from the mono-
and trilayer systems and a completely different signature in the bilayer flake.
This shows a different origin of the low-lying excitonic species (A, A', and B)
in the band structure. We confirm the robustness of the magneto-excitonic
coupling in few-layer CrSBr. Our work enables a more comprehensive exploration
of the dual excitonic behavior in 2D materials.

The effects of strong electronic correlations and disorder are crucial for
emergent phenomena such as unconventional superconductivity, metal-insulator
transitions, and quantum criticality. While both are omnipresent in real
materials, their individual impacts on charge transport remain elusive. To
disentangle their respective roles, we have independently varied the degree of
randomness and the strength of electronic correlations -- by chemical
substitution and physical pressure, respectively -- within the metallic phase
nearby a Mott-insulating state. We find a distinct correlation dependence of
the disorder-dependent residual resistivity $\rho_0$ in the Fermi-liquid regime
$\rho(T)=\rho_0 + A T^2$, where $A\propto (m^{\star}/m)^2$ quantifies the
electronic mass enhancement. Contrary to conventional expectations, we observe
that at fixed disorder level $\rho_0$ grows linearly with $A$. This scaling can
be understood in terms of chemical-potential fluctuations with variance
$\sigma_\mu^2$, yielding $\rho_0 \propto A\,\sigma_\mu^2$. By comparing our
findings to transport data on other organic Mott systems, oxides, heavy-fermion
compounds, and moir\'e materials, we demonstrate that this new relation between
residual resistivity and mass enhancement is a universal feature of correlated
metals.

We demonstrate that switching of ferroelectric thin-films sandwiched between
metallic electrodes can be controlled by laser-assisted heating, reminiscent of
heat-assisted magnetic recording. We employ electrical switching cycles that
quantify the electrically switchable remanent polarization $P_\mathrm{r}$ and
show that 300\,ns voltage pulses alone change the polarization by less than
$\Delta P&lt;P_\mathrm{r}$. Transient heating of the metallic top electrode by
synchronized ns laser-pulses induces a reversal $\Delta
P^\mathrm{L}&gt;P_\mathrm{r}$ of the average polarization. The transient average
temperature modeled by the heat equation can rationalize the polarization
change observed for different relative timing $\Delta t$ of the laser pulse, if
it arrives before the electrical pulse.

Disorder plays an important role in materials science, influencing material
behavior across different length scales. Imperfections like vacancies, atomic
substitutions, lattice distortions, and microstructural inhomogeneities,
disrupt ideal periodicity thereby altering physical properties. Analogous to
spin-glass systems, electrical 'glassiness' arises when charge carriers
confront disordered energy landscapes, leading to a broad range of relaxation
times, especially in polycrystalline materials where dipoles experience
competing exchange interactions. Complex impedance, permittivity, and electric
modulus distill out separate resistive and capacitive effects, offering
insights into how microstructural inhomogeneities affects conduction mechanism.
In polycrystalline double perovskites A2SmTaO6 (A = Ba, Ca), with a power law
driven ac conductivity, the hopping and relaxation of carriers is affected by
both grains and grain boundaries. Scaling of ac conductivity and impedance
response reveals correlation between conduction and relaxation timescales. The
inhomogeneities in local energy landscape of 'frustrated' dipoles restrict the
'universality' of conduction mechanism across the bulk length scale.

We report transient highly strained structural states in individual palladium
(Pd) nanocrystals, electronically heated using an optical laser, which precede
their uniform thermal expansion. Using an X-ray free-electron laser probe, the
evolution of individual 111 Bragg peaks is measured as a function of delay time
at various laser fluences. Above a laser fluence threshold at a sufficient
pump-probe delay, the Bragg peak splits into multiple peaks, indicating
heterogeneous strain, before returning to a single peak, corresponding to even
heat distribution throughout the lattice expanded crystal. Our findings are
supported by a lattice displacement and strain model of a single nanocrystal at
different delay times, which agrees with the experimental data. Our
observations have implications for understanding femtosecond laser interactions
with metals and the potential photo-catalytic performance of Pd.

- **TL;DR**: CoSn kagome金属薄膜通过磁控溅射制备，在Ru(10-10)缓冲层上实现外延生长，展现出沿c轴[0001]方向的低电阻率(13 μΩ cm)和约10倍的电阻率各向异性，但存在表面粗糙度和晶界问题。

CoSn kagome metal is a pseudo-one-dimensional electronic conductor,
exhibiting low resistivity (\r{ho}) along the [0001] direction (c-axis) and
significantly higher \r{ho} along other crystallographic directions. Such
anisotropic conduction is expected to mitigate resistivity increases in narrow
interconnect wires at advanced semiconductor technology process nodes, making
CoSn a promising candidate for future interconnect applications. In this study,
CoSn thin films were fabricated by magnetron sputtering, and their resistivity
anisotropy was investigated with respect to crystallographic orientation.
Epitaxial growth of single-crystalline CoSn(10-10) films was achieved on a
Ru(10-10) buffer layer at deposition temperatures above 350 {\deg}C. The CoSn
films exhibited relatively low \r{ho} along [0001], reaching 13 micro{\Omega}
cm, and an approximately tenfold anisotropy of \r{ho} between [0001] and
[2-1-10] (a-axis), consistent with previous reports on bulk CoSn single
crystals. However, the CoSn(10-10) surface exhibited pronounced roughness,
attributed to three-dimensional crystal growth during sputtering, which hinders
accurate evaluation of the thickness dependence of resistivity. Scanning
transmission electron microscopy revealed the growth of a CoSn(10-10)
single-crystal with (11-20) and (01-10) side wall facets, as well as domain
boundaries within the films. These results highlight both the potential and
challenges of employing CoSn kagome metal in future interconnect technologies.

- **TL;DR**: 本研究通过计算模拟分析不同pH条件下离子化草甘膦与单壁碳纳米管的相互作用，发现除中性状态外，其他电离形式均表现出更强的吸附能力和电子耦合，表明碳纳米管在草甘膦环境修复中具有应用潜力。

The extensive use of glyphosate in agriculture has raised environmental
concerns due to its adverse effects on plants, animals, microorganisms, and
humans. This study investigates the interactions between ionized glyphosate and
single-walled carbon nanotubes (CNT) using computational simulations through
semi-empirical tight-binding methods (GFN2-xTB) implemented in the xTB
software. The analysis focused on different glyphosate ionization states
corresponding to various pH levels: G1 (pH &lt; 2), G2 (pH ~ 2-3), G3 (pH ~ 4-6),
G4 (pH ~ 7-10), and G5 (pH &gt; 10.6). Results revealed that glyphosate in G1, G3,
G4, and G5 forms exhibited stronger interactions with CNT, demonstrating higher
adsorption energies and greater electronic coupling. The neutral state (G2)
showed lower affinity, indicating that molecular protonation significantly
influences adsorption. Topological analysis and molecular dynamics confirmed
the presence of covalent, non-covalent, and partially covalent interactions,
while the CNT+G5 system demonstrated moderate interactions suitable for
material recycling. These findings suggest that carbon nanotubes, with their
extraordinary properties such as nanocapillarity, porosity, and extensive
surface area, show promise for environmental monitoring and remediation of
glyphosate contamination.

For large-scale deployment and use of polymer electrolyte fuel cells,
high-performance electrocatalysts with low platinum consumption are desirable.
One promising strategy to meet this demand is to explore alternative materials
that retain catalytic efficiency while introducing new mechanisms for
performance enhacement. In this study, we investigate a ferromagnetic CoPt as a
candidate material to accelerate oxygen reduction reactions. By using density
functional theory calculations, we find the spin-polarized Co-$d$ states to
enhance O$_2$ surface bonding due to local exchange splitting of Co-$d$
carriers at the Fermi level. Furthermore, O and O$_2$ adsorption and
dissociation energies are found to be tuned by varying the thickness of the Pt
layers. Our study gives insight into the role magnetism plays in the oxygen
reduction reaction process and how magnetic ions may aid in the design of new
advanced catalysts.
