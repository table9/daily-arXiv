- **TL;DR**: 本文研究了Cr掺杂BaFe2As2中的自旋激发，发现无序效应比电荷掺杂效应更占主导地位，Cr引入的局域自旋通过阻尼软化Fe衍生磁激发

Partial chemical substitution inevitably introduces disorder. In doped Hund's
metals, such as the iron-based superconductors, effects like charge doping and
chemical pressure are often considered dominant. Here, we investigate spin
excitations in Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Cr$_x$)$_2$As$_{2}$ (CrBFA) by high-resolution
Resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) for samples with $x = 0, 0.035,$ and
$ 0.085$. In CrBFA, Cr acts as a hole dopant, but also introduces localized
spins that compete with Fe-derived magnetic excitations. We found that the
Fe-derived magnetic excitations are softened primarily by damping, becoming
overdamped for $x = 0.085$. At this doping level, complementary angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy measurements (ARPES) show the absence of electronic
structure reconstruction effects such as the nematic band splitting. We propose
a localized spin model that explicitly incorporates substitutional disorder and
Cr local moments, successfully reproducing our key observations. These results
reveal a case where disorder dominates over charge doping in the case of a
correlated Hund's metal.

- **TL;DR**: 在La(Rh,Ir)Si手性晶体家族中发现非常规超导性，通过Rh到Ir的取代增强自旋轨道耦合，实现了从完全能隙超导体到拓扑节线超导体的转变

Chiral crystals, whose key feature is the structural handedness, host exotic
quantum phenomena driven by the interplay of band topology, spin-orbit coupling
(SOC), and electronic correlations. Due to the limited availability of suitable
chiral-crystal materials, their unconventional superconductivity (SC) remains
largely unexplored. Here, we report the discovery of unconventional SC in the
La(Rh,Ir)Si family of materials by combining muon-spin spectroscopy,
band-structure calculations, and perturbation theory. This family,
characterized by a double-helix chiral structure, hosts exotic multifold
fermions that are absent in other topological chiral crystals. While LaRhSi
behaves as a fully-gapped superconductor, the substitution of 4$d$-Rh by
5$d$-Ir significantly enhances the SOC and leads to the emergence of
topological nodal-line SC in LaIrSi. The developed model shows that the
nodal-line SC arises from an isotropic SOC with a specific strength. Such an
exotic mechanism expands our conventional understanding of material candidates
for unconventional SC, which typically rely on a significantly anisotropic SOC
to promote the triplet pairing. Our work establishes a new type of phase
diagram, which provides a comprehensive roadmap for identifying and engineering
unconventional SC in chiral crystals. Furthermore, it calls for renewed
investigations of unconventional SC in other widely studied superconductors
with a chiral structure.

### Radio-Frequency Method for Detecting Superconductivity Under High Pressure

- **TL;DR**: 一种无接触RF传感技术，通过碳素碾碳上的循环镜头系统，在极端压力下高敏感地探测微米样品的超导、磁性计算和金属-绝缘过渡。在La-Ce超氢化物中观察到超过传统测量的高过渡温度(215-220K)，并发现Tc随时间增至260-270K。

We introduce a contactless technique for probing superconductivity,
metal-insulator transitions, and magnetic ordering in micron-sized samples
under extreme pressure. Utilizing a multistage Lenz lens system, directly
sputtered onto diamond anvils, we realize a radio-frequency (RF, 50 kHz - 200
MHz) transformer with a sample, of 50-100 microns in diameter, as its core.
This configuration enables efficient transfer and focusing of an
electromagnetic field within the diamond anvil cell's chamber. Consequently,
the transmitted RF signal exhibits high sensitivity to variations in the
sample's surface conductivity and magnetic permeability. We validate this
method by determining the critical temperatures ($T_{\text{c}}$) of known
superconductors, including NbTi, MgB$_2$, Hg-1223, BSCCO, and REBCO in various
magnetic fields, as well as the magnetic ordering temperatures of Gd and Tb,
and the metal-insulator transition in VO$_2$. Notably, we apply this technique
to the (La,Ce)H$_{10-12}$ superhydride at a pressure of about 150 GPa. The
observed superconducting transition, at 215-220 K, is noticeably higher than
the $T_{\text{c}}$ determined via traditional electrical-resistance
measurements (200-205 K), demonstrating the method's enhanced sensitivity.
Moreover, we show how multiple repetitions of the RF experiment with the La-Ce
superhydride make it possible to detect the increase in $T_{\text{c}}$ over
time up to 260-270 K. This finding opens a pathway towards reaching a critical
$T_{\text{c}}$ above 0$^\circ$C in the La-based superhydrides.

- **TL;DR**: 利用梯度界面应变在Nb0.5Ti0.5N薄膜中实现可调谐超导二极管效应，无需复杂材料工程

The superconducting diode effect (SDE), combining superconductivity with
diode-like nonreciprocal current flow, recently emerges as an ideal candidate
for zero-dissipation electronic circuits. Such technologically advantageous
diodes are achieved by intricate material engineering to disrupt inversion
symmetry, which leads to the production challenges as well as a limited pool of
viable materials. Here we exploit the gradient interfacial strain to
experimentally induce the SDE in Nb0.5Ti0.5N (NTN) films grown on MgO
substrates. Additionally, the SDE is tunable with an in-plane magnetic field
and can be further enhanced by introducing an interfacial anisotropic pinning
potential. Our findings establish interfacial strain gradient as a versatile
tool for creating and enhancing tunable SDE.

### Statistical Mechanics of Paraparticles

Quantum mechanics broadly classifies the particles into two categories: $(1)$
fermions and $(2)$ bosons. Fermions are half-integer spin particles, obeying
Pauli's exclusion principle and Fermi-Dirac statistics. Whereas bosons are
integer spin particles, not obeying Pauli's exclusion principle, and obeying
Bose-Einstein statistics. However, there are two exceptions to this standard
case: first, anyons, which exist in 2-dimensional systems, and secondly,
paraparticles, which can exist in any dimension. Paraparticles follow their
non-trivial parastatistics, obeying their generalised exclusion principle. In
this paper, we provide a detailed review of the foundations of paraparticle
statistics established in \cite{wang2025particle}. We extend this work further
and then derive an important expression for the heat capacity of paraparticles
for a specific case, which would provide a handle for the experimental
detection of paraparticles in appropriate systems.

### AFSI: Automated Fluid-Structure Interaction Solver Development for Nonlinear Solid Mechanics

- **TL;DR**: AFSI是一个开源的流固耦合求解器，基于FEniCS有限元库开发，采用浸没边界法处理大变形问题，特别适用于心脏组织等超弹性材料的模拟。

AFSI is a novel, open-source fluid-structure interaction (FSI) solver
  that extends the capabilities of the FEniCS finite element library through
  an immersed boundary (IB) framework. Designed to simulate large deformations
  in hyperelastic materials (such as cardiac tissue), AFSI avoids the need for
expensive remeshing by coupling a Lagrangian representation of the solid with
an Eulerian description of the surrounding fluid. This approach retains the
full expressiveness of FEniCS's variational formulations, function spaces, and
time integration schemes.
  Implemented in a hybrid Python/C++ architecture, AFSI allows users to define
geometries, constitutive models (e.g., the Holzapfel-Ogden law for myocardium),
and strain energy functions directly in Python, while delegating
performance-critical tasks such as assembly and linear solvers to optimized C++
backends. Its concise and modular Python API facilitates the setup of FSI
simulations, enabling users to easily modify discretization strategies or
analyze results using standard FEniCS post-processing tools.
  By combining the flexibility of FEniCS with a robust immersed boundary
formulation, AFSI empowers rapid prototyping of complex nonlinear solid-fluid
interaction problems, making it a powerful tool for simulating biomechanical
systems and other applications involving highly deformable structures in flow.

- **TL;DR**: 使用电子能谱光谱技术研究单层WS2在静电门控下的光子特性，发现了电子材与门场交互导致的新型光子限制机制

Engineering and probing excitonic properties at the nanoscale remains a
central challenge in quantum photonics and optoelectronics. While exciton
confinement via electrical control and strain engineering has been demonstrated
in 2D semiconductors, substantial nanoscale heterogeneity limits the
scalability of 2D quantum photonic device architectures. In this work, we use
cathodoluminescence spectroscopy to probe the excitonic landscape of monolayer
$WS_2$ under electrostatic gating. Exploiting the high spatial resolution of
the converged electron beam, we resolve a homojunction arising between gated
and ungated regions. Moreover, we reveal an exciton confinement channel arising
from an unconventional doping mechanism driven by the interplay between the
electron beam and the applied gate fields. These findings offer new insights
into the optoelectronic behavior of monolayer semiconductors under the combined
influence of electron-beam excitation and electrostatic gating. Our approach
provides a pathway for exciton manipulation at the nanoscale and opens
opportunities for controlling quantum-confined exciton transport in
two-dimensional materials.

### Majorana edge modes in number-conserving models with long-range interactions

- **TL;DR**: 本文通过数值研究具有长程相互作用的费米子数守恒模型，在开放链中发现Majorana边缘模式的存在证据，并开发了基于关联函数的方法来揭示完全相互作用多体系统中的Majorana模式空间结构

Topological superconductors are believed to host exotic quasiparticle
excitations known as Majorana zero-modes, with much of the evidence based on
BCS mean-field theory. The direct application of mean-field arguments is
tenuous in finite, isolated systems relevant in some experiments. Here, we
numerically study fermion number-conserving models with long-range
interactions, which under periodic boundary conditions exhibit robust
topological and non-topological superconductivity, tuned by the strength of
interaction [1]. We find evidence that, on the topological side, Majorana edge
modes appear in open chains, manifesting as the vanishing of the energy
splitting between odd- and even-parity ground states with increasing system
size. Additionally, off-diagonal two-point correlation functions show nonlocal,
parity-dependent edge effects consistent with Majorana phenomenology. We
develop a correlation-based method revealing the spatial structure of Majorana
modes in this fully interacting many-body setting.

### Nonadiabatic Wave-Packet Dynamics: Nonadiabatic Metric, Quantum Geometry, and Analogue Gravity

- **TL;DR**: 提出了布洛赫电子在缓慢时空扰动下的非绝热波包动力学统一理论，通过扩展波包拟设包含带间贡献，推导出非绝热修正项，包括量子度规、修正的贝里联络和能量修正，并将动力学重新表述为相空间中的测地运动。

We develop a unified theory for the nonadiabatic wave-packet dynamics of
Bloch electrons subject to slowly varying spatial and temporal perturbations.
Extending the conventional wave-packet ansatz to include interband
contributions, we derive equations for the interband coefficients using the
time-dependent variational principle, referred to as the wave-packet
coefficient equation. Solving these equations and integrating out interband
contributions yields the leading-order nonadiabatic corrections to the
wave-packet Lagrangian. These corrections appear in three forms: (i) a
nonadiabatic metric in real and momentum space, which we identify with the
energy-gap-renormalized quantum metric, (ii) modified Berry connections
associated with the motion of the wave-packet center, and (iii) an energy
correction arising from spatial and temporal variations of the Hamiltonian.
This metric reformulates the wave-packet dynamics as geodesic motion in phase
space, enabling an analogue-gravity perspective in condensed matter systems. As
an application, we analyze one-dimensional Dirac electron systems under a
slowly varying exchange field $\bm{m}$. Our results demonstrate that variations
in the magnitude of $\bm{m}$ are important to nonadiabatic dynamics, in sharp
contrast to the adiabatic regime where directional variations of $\bm{m}$ are
crucial.

- **TL;DR**: MolErr2Fix是一个专门评估大语言模型在化学错误检测和修正方面能力的基准测试，包含1193个精细标注的错误实例，揭示了当前LLMs在化学推理方面的显著性能差距。

Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown growing potential in molecular
sciences, but they often produce chemically inaccurate descriptions and
struggle to recognize or justify potential errors. This raises important
concerns about their robustness and reliability in scientific applications. To
support more rigorous evaluation of LLMs in chemical reasoning, we present the
MolErr2Fix benchmark, designed to assess LLMs on error detection and correction
in molecular descriptions. Unlike existing benchmarks focused on
molecule-to-text generation or property prediction, MolErr2Fix emphasizes
fine-grained chemical understanding. It tasks LLMs with identifying,
localizing, explaining, and revising potential structural and semantic errors
in molecular descriptions. Specifically, MolErr2Fix consists of 1,193
fine-grained annotated error instances. Each instance contains quadruple
annotations, i.e,. (error type, span location, the explanation, and the
correction). These tasks are intended to reflect the types of reasoning and
verification required in real-world chemical communication. Evaluations of
current state-of-the-art LLMs reveal notable performance gaps, underscoring the
need for more robust chemical reasoning capabilities. MolErr2Fix provides a
focused benchmark for evaluating such capabilities and aims to support progress
toward more reliable and chemically informed language models. All annotations
and an accompanying evaluation API will be publicly released to facilitate
future research.

### Luminescence-Induced Tunable Superconductivity in BSCCO via GaP Quantum Dots

- **TL;DR**: 在B(P)SCCO高温超导材料中引入GaP量子点作为异相，利用其发光特性显著增强了超导性能，包括临界温度、临界电流密度和迈斯纳场。

The enhancement of superconducting properties in high-temperature
copper-oxide superconductor B(P)SCCO remains a hot research topic in the field
of superconducting materials. Building on previous research, here we introduce
GaP quantum dots as an heterophase into the B(P)SCCO superconductor, aiming to
enhance its superconductivity through the luminescent properties of GaP quantum
dots. The experimental results demonstrate that the introduction of GaP quantum
dots into B(P)SCCO generates significant tunable superconducting effects,
leading to enhanced critical transition temperature (Tc), critical current
density (Jc), and Meissner field (Hc) of B(P)SCCO with increasing luminescent
intensity of the GaP quantum dots. The enhancement effect induced by GaP
quantum dots exhibits a positive correlation with luminescent intensity,
meaning samples with the addition of GaP quantum dots exhibiting higher
luminescent intensity show elevated Tc, Jc, and Hc values. Unlike impurity
effects, a distinct critical concentration dependency is observed. Notably,
this GaP quantum dot modification strategy is not only effective in
conventional superconductors but also applicable to high-temperature oxide
superconductors.

### Pattern formation in a coupled driven diffusive system

- **TL;DR**: 本文通过引入场基晶格模型(FLM)研究驱动二元混合体系中的模式形成，发现该模型能有效捕捉驱动Widom-Rowlison晶格气体的体相行为，并揭示了中间相的不规则条纹结构。

We investigate pattern formation in a driven mixture of two repulsive
particles by introducing a Field-based Lattice Model (FLM), a hybrid model that
combines aspects of the driven Widom-Rowlison lattice gas (DWRLG) and its
statistical field theory \cite{DWRLG1,DWRLG2}. We find that the FLM effectively
captures the bulk behavior of the DWRLG in both low- and high-density phases,
suggesting that phase transitions in these models may share a universality
class. Under the effect of the drive, the FLM additionally reveals an
intermediate regime, not reported in the previous DWRLG studies, characterized
by ``irregular stripes" with widely fluctuating widths, contrasting with the
``regular", well-ordered stripes found at higher densities. In this
intermediate phase, the system exhibits long-range order, predominantly
perpendicular to the drive direction. To construct a continuum description, we
derive two coupled partial differential equations via a gradient expansion of
the FLM mean mass-transfer equations, supplemented with additive noise.
Designing a numerical solver using the pseudospectral method with dealiasing
and stochastic time differencing, we reproduce the low-density microemulsion
phase (characterized by a non-zero characteristic wavenumber $q^*$) and
perpendicular stripes at high density. We identify the non-zero difference in
the characteristic velocities of the fields as a necessary condition for
perpendicular stripe formation in the high-density phase. The continuum model
also uncovers novel behaviors not previously observed in the FLM, such as
stripes aligned parallel to the drive and chaotic patterns. This work
highlights how the interplay of external drive, particle interactions, and
noise can lead to a rich phenomenology in strongly driven binary mixtures.

Foundation models trained as autoregressive PDE surrogates hold significant
promise for accelerating scientific discovery through their capacity to both
extrapolate beyond training regimes and efficiently adapt to downstream tasks
despite a paucity of examples for fine-tuning. However, reliably achieving
genuine generalization - a necessary capability for producing novel scientific
insights and robustly performing during deployment - remains a critical
challenge. Establishing whether or not these requirements are met demands
evaluation metrics capable of clearly distinguishing genuine model
generalization from mere memorization.
  We apply the influence function formalism to systematically characterize how
autoregressive PDE surrogates assimilate and propagate information derived from
diverse physical scenarios, revealing fundamental limitations of standard
models and training routines in addition to providing actionable insights
regarding the design of improved surrogates.

Shot noise emerges due to the discrete nature of charge transport and
provides direct access to the underlying microscopic transport mechanisms
governing current flow in mesoscopic conductors. In this work, we demonstrate
that quantum shot noise offers a direct and robust fingerprint of Andreev
reflection, distinguishing between retro and specular processes in
graphene-superconductor, graphene-superconductor-graphene, and
superconductor-graphene-superconductor junctions. At the
graphene-superconductor interface, exact reflection amplitudes obtained from
full wavefunction matching within the Bogoliubov-de Gennes formalism capture
retro and specular regimes. The associated Fano factor exhibits distinct
Fermi-level-dependent signatures, with retro Andreev reflection suppressing and
specular Andreev reflection enhancing the shot noise. Extensions to
graphene-superconductor-graphene and superconductor-graphene-superconductor
configurations reveal how the transmission spectrum and, consequently, the
noise profile are modified in the presence of multiple interfaces, coherent
quasiparticle interference, and superconducting phase variations. Our findings
establish shot noise spectroscopy as a potent and experimentally viable probe
for differentiating Andreev reflection types in graphene-based quantum devices,
providing complementary insights beyond conventional conductance measurements.

### Universal Mott quantum criticality in a modified periodic Anderson model

- **TL;DR**: Error

Mott quantum criticality is a central theme in correlated electron physics,
observed in systems featuring both continuous zero-temperature transitions and
those with finite-temperature critical endpoints. Within dynamical mean-field
theory (DMFT), the paradigmatic single-band Hubbard model (SBHM) displays such
criticality only above a finite-temperature endpoint. In contrast, the modified
periodic Anderson model (MPAM) is a rare example known to host a surface of
genuinely continuous Mott quantum critical points (QCPs) at zero temperature.
Using DMFT with the numerical renormalization group as an impurity solver, we
investigate the finite-temperature, real-frequency properties of the MPAM. Our
central finding is the emergence of quantum critical scaling in the electrical
resistivity, with critical exponents $z_{\text{met}} = 0.76$ and
$z_{\text{ins}} = 0.66$ on the metallic and insulating sides, respectively.
These values fall within the range reported for the SBHM, suggesting that both
transitions are governed by a common universality class. We further
substantiate the presence of local quantum criticality by demonstrating robust
$\omega/T$ scaling in single- and two-particle correlation functions. Finally,
we identify novel transport signatures in the optical conductivity, where the
distinct evolution of two isosbestic points serves as a unique fingerprint of
the QCP. These results establish the MPAM as a canonical model for
investigating genuine Mott quantum criticality and support the existence of a
universal framework for this fundamental phenomenon.

### Reexamining Machine Learning Models on Predicting Thermoelectric Properties

Thermoelectric materials can generate clean energy by transforming waste heat
into electricity. The effectiveness of thermoelectric materials is measured by
the dimensionless figure of merit, ZT. The quest for high ZT materials has
drawn extensive research experimentally and theoretically. However, due to the
vast material space, finding high ZT materials is time-consuming and costly. To
improve the efficiency of discovering new thermoelectric materials, recent
studies have employed machine learning with databases to search for high ZT
candidates. In this work, we examine the effects of adding various physical
concepts on the performance of machine learning models in predicting TE
properties. The objective is to improve the model ability to capture the
underlying physics in designing TE materials. These concepts include short
range order and crystal structure class. Results show some improvements in
accuracy. However, the current models do not distinguish between dilute alloys
and concentrated alloys, rendering them inadequate in predicting doping
effects. To better capture the electronic band structure effect from doping, we
included various dopant properties as features. This increases the prediction
accuracy in doped materials. Furthermore, we used a genetic algorithm to rank
features for various thermoelectric properties to provide physical insight into
key parameters in designing thermoelectric materials.

there is a low-energy resonance, which has a repulsive character along the
H+NC$_3$ coordinate and becomes a bound electronic state of the HNC$_3^-$ anion
near the equilibrium of HNC$_3$. The anion state dissociates without a
potential barrier towards C$_3$N$^-$+H. The cross section and the rate
coefficient of the process were computed. The obtained rate coefficient at low
temperatures is $5\times 10^{-9}$cm$^3$/s at 300~K. Such a value of the DEA
rate coefficient makes the DEA process by three orders of magnitude more
efficient in producing negative molecular ions in the interstellar space than
the radiative electron attachment (REA). It is suggested that negative
molecular carbon-chain ions, observed in the interstellar medium, are produced
by DEA rather than REA.

Superconducting coplanar waveguide (SCPW) resonators, key components for
quantum computing and sensing applications, require a high internal quality
factor (Qi) for effective qubit readout and quantum sensing applications.
Minimizing two-level system (TLS) losses, particularly at material interfaces,
is critical for gatemon and topological qubits operating at low temperatures
and in high magnetic fields. NbTi, a superconducting alloy with a high upper
critical field, enables SCPW resonators resilient to such conditions. We
fabricated NbTi SCPW resonators on Si/SiO2 substrates and systematically
characterized their TLS-limited quality factors as functions of temperature and
microwave photon number. Our results demonstrate that NbTi-based SCPWs on
Si/SiO2 substrates provide a promising platform for developing next-generation
quantum circuits.

The thermodynamics of mesoscopic systems driven by time-varying temperatures
is crucial for understanding biological systems, designing nanoscale engines,
and performing micro-particle cooling. In this work, we analyze an underdamped
Brownian particle in a harmonic trap under a sinusoidal thermal protocol.
Through analytical methods and numerical simulations, we analyze the system's
dynamics and heat statistics. We report the emergence of resonant
position-velocity correlations and a non-Gaussian, asymmetric heat distribution
consistent with the Fluctuation Theorem. We demonstrate that inertia is a key
parameter, damping the system's response and slowing its relaxation to a
periodic non-equilibrium steady state. Our results show that oscillatory
thermal driving is a powerful tool for controlling nanoscale energy flow.

### Generative Latent Space Dynamics of Electron Density

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种结合3D卷积自编码器和潜在扩散模型的生成框架，用于从第一性原理分子动力学模拟中学习电子密度轨迹，实现稳定的长期预测。

Modeling the time-dependent evolution of electron density is essential for
understanding quantum mechanical behaviors of condensed matter and enabling
predictive simulations in spectroscopy, photochemistry, and ultrafast science.
Yet, while machine learning methods have advanced static density prediction,
modeling its spatiotemporal dynamics remains largely unexplored. In this work,
we introduce a generative framework that combines a 3D convolutional
autoencoder with a latent diffusion model (LDM) to learn electron density
trajectories from ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. Our method
encodes electron densities into a compact latent space and predicts their
future states by sampling from the learned conditional distribution, enabling
stable long-horizon rollouts without drift or collapse. To preserve statistical
fidelity, we incorporate a scaled Jensen-Shannon divergence regularization that
aligns generated and reference density distributions. On AIMD trajectories of
liquid lithium at 800 K, our model accurately captures both the spatial
correlations and the log-normal-like statistical structure of the density. The
proposed framework has the potential to accelerate the simulation of quantum
dynamics and overcome key challenges faced by current spatiotemporal machine
learning methods as surrogates of quantum mechanical simulators.

Cu2OSeO3 is a skyrmion host material in which two distinct thermodynamically
stable skyrmion phases were identified. We report magnetic force microscopy
imaging of the low-temperature magnetic phases in bulk Cu2OSeO3(100) single
crystal. Tuning the external magnetic field over the various phase transition
at a temperature of 10 K, we observe the formation of helical, conical, tilted
conical and skyrmion lattice domains in real space.

### Strange diffusivity of incoherent metal in half-filled two-dimensional Hubbard model

- **TL;DR**: 本文开发了多尺度方法研究二维Hubbard模型中的金属-绝缘体交叉输运行为，发现异常电阻率标度关系和奇特非费米液体态

We study charge transport across the metal-insulator crossover in the
half-filled two-dimensional Hubbard model, with particular emphasis on
precision control. The dynamic current-current correlation function is obtained
directly in the thermodynamic limit, and the optical conductivity is extracted
using numerical analytic continuation. To achieve this, we develop a multiscale
approach: the non-perturbative low-frequency behavior is computed using the
unbiased diagrammatic Monte Carlo technique, while the high-frequency physics
is captured via a self-consistent (semi-)analytic diagrammatic theory. We found
that across a broad temperature range where the DC resistivity displays
anomalous scaling, $\sim T^\alpha$ with $0&lt;\alpha\lesssim 1$, the
Nernst-Einstein relation implies the diffusion constant with the characteristic
$\sim 1/\sqrt{T}$ "strange metal" behavior. It was also revealed that the
insulating regime is entered through a peculiar non-Fermi liquid state-which we
call a Pseudogap Metal-characterized by insulating charge compressibility
coexisting with metallic transport. Diagrammatically, the high-temperature
incoherent transport is captured by the dressed polarization bubble, whereas
near the metal-insulator crossover, the effective interaction vertex between
opposite-spin particles is responsible for transferring the Drude weight to a
high-frequency continuum.

### Free-carrier screening unlocks high electron mobility in ultrawide bandgap semiconductor CaSnO$_3$

- **TL;DR**: 通过第一性原理计算发现CaSnO₃的本征电子迁移率受长程纵向光学声子散射限制，但高掺杂下自由载流子屏蔽效应显著抑制声子散射，使迁移率提升至实验值的两倍

Alkaline earth stannates have emerged as promising transparent conducting
oxides due to their wide band gaps and high room-temperature electron
mobilities. Among them, CaSnO$_3$ possesses the widest band gap, yet reported
mobilities vary widely and are highly sample-dependent, leaving its intrinsic
limit unclear. Here, we present ab initio calculations of electron mobility in
CaSnO$_3$ across a range of temperatures and doping levels, using
state-of-the-art methods that explicitly account for free-carrier screening in
electron-phonon interactions. We identify the dominant limiting mechanism to be
the long-range longitudinal optical phonon scattering, which is significantly
suppressed at high doping due to free-carrier screening, leading to enhanced
phonon-limited mobility. While ionized impurity scattering emerges as a
competing mechanism at carrier concentrations up to ~10$^{20}$ cm$^{-3}$, the
phonon scattering reduction dominates, yielding a net mobility increase with
predicted room-temperature values reaching about twice the highest experimental
report. Our work highlights the substantial untapped conductivity in CaSnO$_3$,
establishing it as a compelling ultrawide bandgap semiconductor for transparent
and high-power electronic applications.

### Migration as a Probe: A Generalizable Benchmark Framework for Specialist vs. Generalist Machine-Learned Force Fields in Doped Materials

- **TL;DR**: 该研究对比了从头训练的专业模型与微调基础模型在机器学习力场中的性能差异，发现针对特定任务微调能显著提升动力学准确性，但可能损害长程物理表征。

Machine-learned force fields (MLFFs), particularly pre-trained foundation
models, promise to bring ab initio-level accuracy to the length and time scales
of molecular dynamics. Yet this shift raises a central question: is it better
to build a specialist model from scratch or adapt a generalist foundation model
for a specific system? The trade-offs in data efficiency, predictive accuracy,
and risks of out-of-distribution (OOD) failure remain unclear. Here, we present
a benchmarking framework that contrasts bespoke (from scratch) and fine-tuned
foundation models in a test case of a technologically relevant 2D material,
Cr-intercalated Sb2Te3, using the MACE architecture. Our framework employs
migration pathways, evaluated through nudged elastic band (NEB) trajectories,
as a diagnostic probe that tests both interpolation and extrapolation. We
assess accuracy for equilibrium, kinetic (atomic migration), and mechanical
(interlayer sliding) tasks. While all models capture equilibrium structures,
predictions for non-equilibrium processes diverge. Task-specific fine-tuning
substantially improves kinetic accuracy compared with both from-scratch and
zero-shot models, but can degrade learned representations of long-range
physics. Analysis of internal representations shows that training paradigms
yield distinct, non-overlapping latent encodings of system physics. This work
offers a practical guide for MLFF development, highlights migration-based
probes as efficient diagnostics, and suggests pathways toward uncertainty-aware
active learning strategies.

### Reentrant superconductivity and superconductor-to-insulator transition in a naturally occurring Josephson junction array tuned by RF power

- **TL;DR**: 在粒独铝系统中通过无线电频功率调控实现了重入超导性，这是一种随温度和磁场增加而重新出现的超导现象

Superconductivity, characterized by dissipationless current flow with flux
expulsion or quantization, is usually muted when the magnetic field or the
temperature is sufficiently high. However, in rare instances, superconductivity
can reappear upon increasing the temperature or magnetic field, a phenomenon
known as reentrant superconductivity. It usually emerges from competing orders
in strongly correlated materials. Here we demonstrate reentrant
superconductivity as a function of both temperature and magnetic field, tuned
by radio frequency (RF) power in a relatively simple system: granular aluminum
(grAl), which exhibits the properties of a naturally occurring Josephson
junction array. At low temperatures, giant Shapiro steps emerge, exhibiting
characteristics of a single Josephson junction. Coherent phase locking across
the array's multiple junctions amplifies the quantized voltage, enabling
tunability at radio frequencies, as observed in artificially designed Josephson
arrays. We show that our system can be tuned from a coherent superconducting
(stiff-phase) to an insulating (phase-fluctuating) state using RF power. We
propose that the RF power modulates the Josephson coupling energy, $E_J$.
Remarkably, at elevated temperatures, the screening of the electron charge
suppresses the charging energy, causing superconductivity to reappear. This
many-body effect cannot be described within a single junction framework and
involves many-body correlations. Our system can therefore be tuned to observe
both the single-junction regime and many-body correlation effects, serving as a
quantum simulator for complex phenomena in condensed matter physics.

### Stochastic Two-temperature Nonequilibrium Ising model

- **TL;DR**: 研究二维Ising模型在两个不同温度间随机切换下的非平衡稳态，发现碳化和能量对切换速率呈现非单调依赖，快速切换时稳态类似热力学分布但仍有能量流表明非平衡特性。

We investigate the nonequilibrium stationary state (NESS) of the
two-dimensional Ising model under a stochastic dichotomous modulation of
temperature, which alternates between $T_c \pm \delta$ around the critical
temperature $T_c$ at a rate $\gamma$. Both magnetization and energy exhibit
non-monotonic dependence on $\gamma$, explained by a renewal approach in the
slow-switching limit, while for small $\delta$ dynamical response theory
quantitatively captures the $\gamma$-dependence of the observables. In the
fast-switching regime, the NESS appears Boltzmann-like with a
$\gamma$-dependent effective temperature. However, a finite energy current
flowing through the system from hot to cold reservoir confirms the intrinsic
nonequilibrium nature of the dynamics.

Divertor targets in magnetic confinement fusion devices must be designed to
handle extreme heat loads. Fast approximation of heat loads with FLARE based on
field line reconstruction from an unstructured flux tube mesh is utilized in
particle swarm optimization (PSO) of the divertor target geometry. Optimization
of the outer divertor target in ITER is evaluated with a constraint for the
head loads onto baffles. The optimal configuration is found to depend on
assumptions for the background plasma in the heat load proxy simulation.

Magnetic hopfions are three-dimensional topological solitons whose static
stability has recently been confirmed in experiments, yet their dynamical modes
remain largely unexplored. Here we combine micromagnetic simulations and
analytical modelling to characterise the fundamental breathing excitation of
hopfions. We show that the breathing mode corresponds to a coherent oscillation
of both the hopfion core diameter and the shell width, while preserving the
topological charge. An analytical domain-wall interaction model explains the
weak field dependence of the shell thickness and yields a closed-form
expression for the restoring stiffness. From this curvature and the
collective-coordinate inertia, we derive an estimated breathing frequency in
excellent agreement with micromagnetic spectra. The ability to capture the
hopfion dynamics quantitatively from material constants highlights a direct
route to experimental detection by ferromagnetic resonance or Brillouin light
scattering, and establishes a framework for frequency-encoded control in
reconfigurable spintronic devices.

### Theory of Emergent Trionic Order in One-Dimensional Bose-Fermi Mixtures

We study a one-dimensional (1D) lattice mixture of hard-core bosons and
spinless fermions with attractive interspecies interaction and correlated
fermion pair hopping. Using Schrieffer-Wolff (SW) transformation and
bosonization, we derive an effective low-energy theory that reveals a
density-induced resonance mechanism. When the filling ratio satisfies
$\rho_{c0}:\rho_{b0} = 2:1$, a non-oscillatory cosine term emerges in the
bosonized theory. This term favors the formation of trions, i.e., bound states
of two fermions and one boson. By performing a renormalization-group (RG)
analysis, we identify a phase transition from a gapless two-component Luttinger
liquid to a partially gapped trionic phase, where trionic correlations exhibit
dominant quasi-long-range order. Our findings provide a microscopic
understanding of composite superfluidity and offer experimentally relevant
signatures for Bose-Fermi mixtures in 1D lattices.

Bound states in the continuum (BICs), with the ability of trapping and
manipulating waves within the radiation continuum, have gained significant
attention for their potential applications in optics and acoustics. However,
challenges arise in reducing wave leakage and noise from fabrication
imperfections. The emergence of robust wave manipulations based on topological
BICs (TBICs) offers promising solutions. Traditionally, TBICs of different
dimensions are observed separately in distinct systems. Here, we report the
experimental discovery of the coexistence of two-dimensional surface TBICs and
one-dimensional hinge TBICs in a single three-dimensional phononic crystal
system. Such an unprecedented dimensional hierarchy of TBICs is triggered by
the mechanism of separability and protected by the valley Chern numbers.
Notably, these TBICs inherit dispersive propagation characteristics from valley
topology and can propagate robustly against defects without leakage. Our
findings offer an efficient approach to multidimensional TBICs and can be
applied in designing highly efficient acoustic devices for wave trapping and
manipulation in multidimensional environments.

We have studied the effect of microhydration on the shape resonances of
uracil nucleobase. The resonance parameters were determined using the resonance
via Pad\'e approach along with the efficient wave function-based
EA-EOM-DLPNO-CCSD method. Our results showed that the uracil resonances become
stabilized with an increase in the extent of microsolvation. The energy of the
resonances decreased, and the width increased as the number of water molecules
surrounding uracil was increased. It showed that ten water molecules are
sufficient to make the lowest shape resonance of uracil a bound radical anionic
state. Our results also indicate that the lowest energy resonance state may
become a bound state under bulk solvation.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文发现三角铂铋化物(t-PtBi2)表面满足高温超导的三个关键条件，为在拓扑材料中实现和优化高温超导提供了新途径。

Although the generic mechanism behind high-temperature superconductivity
remains notoriously elusive, a set of favorable conditions for its occurrence
in a given material has emerged: (i) the electronic structure should have a
very high density of states near the Fermi level; (ii) electrons need to be
susceptible to a sizable interaction with another degree of freedom to ensure
pairing themselves; (iii) the ability to fine-tune some of the system
properties significantly helps maximising the critical temperature. Here, by
means of high-resolution ARPES, we show that all three criteria are remarkably
fulfilled in trigonal platinum bismuthide (t-PtBi$_2$). Specifically, this
happens on its surface, which hosts topological surface states known as Fermi
arcs. Our findings pave the way for the stabilisation and optimisation of
high-temperature superconductivity in this topological material.

In this study, we reveal nontrivial quantum physics in an
infinite-temperature system. By performing an unbiased quantum Monte Carlo
simulation, we study a hybrid model composed of hard-core bosons, whose hopping
amplitude is mediated by the density of another type of soft-core bond bosons
that can absorb entropy indefinitely. It is shown that the Bose-Einstein
condensate can persist in three dimensions even when the temperature approaches
the infinite-temperature limit. In contrast, in two dimensions, the
quasi-superfluid is depleted by the fluctuations of the bond bosons, which, on
the other hand, enhance the conductivity of the hard-core bosons in the normal
phase. A generalization to the fermionic model has also been discussed.

### rhodent: A Python package for analyzing real-time TDDFT response

- **TL;DR**: rhodent是一个模块化的Python包，用于处理rt-TDDFT计算输出，支持多种分析功能，并能通过线性响应假设加速频率相关激发分析。

Real-time time-dependent density functional theory (rt-TDDFT) is a
well-established method for studying the dynamic response of matter in the
femtosecond or optical range. In this method, the Kohn-Sham (KS) wave functions
are propagated forward in time, and in principle, one can extract any
observable at any given time. Alternatively, by taking a Fourier transform,
spectroscopic quantities can be extracted. There are many publicly available
codes implementing rt-TDDFT, which differ in their numeric solution of the KS
equations, their available exchange-correlation functionals, and in their
analysis capabilities. For users of rt-TDDFT, this is an inconvenient situation
because they may need to use a numerical method that is available in one code,
but an analysis method available in another. Here, we introduce rhodent, a
modular Python package for processing the output of rt-TDDFT calculations. Our
package can be used to calculate hot-carrier distributions, energies, induced
densities, and dipole moments, and various decompositions thereof. In its
current version, rhodent handles calculation results from the gpaw code, but
can readily be extended to support other rt-TDDFT codes. Additionally, under
the assumption of linear response, rhodent can be used to calculate the
response to a narrow-band laser, from the response to a broad-band
perturbation, greatly speeding up the analysis of frequency-dependent
excitations. We demonstrate the capabilities of rhodent via a set of examples,
for systems consisting of Al and Ag clusters and organic molecules.

Free gases of spinless fermions moving on a geometric background with lattice
symmetries are considered. Their Fermi seas and corresponding boundaries may be
classified according to their topological properties at zero temperature. This
is accomplished by considering the flat orbifolds $R^{d}/\Gamma$, with $\Gamma$
being the crystallographic group of symmetry in $d$-dimensional momentum space.
For $d=1$, there are 2 topological classes: a circumference, corresponding to
an insulator and an interval, identified as a conductor. For $d=2$, the number
of topological classes extends to 17: there are 8 with the topology of a disk
identified as conductors and 4 corresponding to a 2-sphere matching insulators,
both sets eventually including finite numbers of conical singularities and
reflection corners at the boundaries. The rest of the listing includes single
cases corresponding to insulators (2-torus, real projective plane, Klein
bottle) and conductors (annulus, M\"obius strip). Physical interpretations of
the singularities are provided, as well as examples that fit within this
listing. Given the topological nature of this classification, its results are
expected to be robust against small perturbative interactions.

framework for describing nonadiabatic effects at metal surfaces, particularly
in electrochemical and molecular electronic applications. We investigate the
electronic friction behavior for the Hubbard-Holstein model using density
matrix renormalization group (DMRG) theory. We show that electron-electron
interactions lead to the formation of two energy levels in the impurity,
resulting in two peaks in the electronic friction at the resonances of electron
attachment or detachment with the metal's Fermi level. We further benchmark our
results against mean field theory (MFT) and exact diagonalization (ED). The
results calculated by ED and DMRG show strong agreement at high temperatures,
suggesting the results from DMRG are reliable; however, at low temperatures, ED
exhibits significant deviations relative to DMRG due to the finite-size
limitations inherent in ED calculations. MFT completely fails to recover Fermi
resonance in electronic friction. Moreover, we investigate the dynamics of the
electronic friction using EF-LD. Simulations reveal differences between the
electronic population and kinetic energy dynamics predicted by MFT and DMRG
approaches, suggesting that MFT approach is unreliable for nonadiabatic
dynamics of strongly correlated systems.

An integrated model of grain growth deuterium-exposed tungsten polycrystals,
consisting of a two-dimensional vertex dynamics model fitted to atomistic data,
has been developed to assess the grain growth kinetics of deuterium-exposed
polycrystalline tungsten (W). The model tracks the motion of grain boundaries
under the effect of driving forces stemming from grain boundary curvature and
differential deuterium concentration accumulation. We apply the model to
experimentally-synthesized W polycrystals under deuterium saturated conditions
consistent with those of the ARC concept design, and find fast grain growth
kinetics in the material region adjacent to the plasma (at 1400 K, &lt;100 seconds
for full transformation), while the microstructure is stable deep inside the
material (several days to complete at a temperature of 1000 K). Our simulations
suggest that monolithic W fabricated using conventional techniques will be
highly susceptible to grain growth in the presence of any driving force at
temperatures above 1000 K.

- **TL;DR**: 使用神经网络势能扩展了Co3O4-水界面的模拟时间和尺度，揭示了两种不同表面终止方式(A和B)在结构和反应性上的显著差异

Co$_3$O$_4$ is an important catalyst for the oxidation of organic molecules
in the liquid phase. Still, understanding the atomistic details of
Co$_3$O$_4$-water interfaces under operando conditions remains extremely
challenging. While ab initio molecular dynamics have become an essential tool
for investigating these dynamic interfaces in silico, they are limited to only
a few picoseconds and a few hundred atoms. In this work, we overcome these
limitations by training a high-dimensional neural network potential (HDNNP) on
density functional theory data, which allows us to significantly extend the
accessible time and length scales. Employing this HDNNP, we perform simulations
to unravel the structure, dynamics, and reactivity of Co$_3$O$_4$(001)-water
interfaces in detail. Our simulations reveal distinct characteristics of the
two possible A and B terminations. The B-terminated surface stabilizes a
compact, quasi-epitaxial hydration layer with strong templating effects,
enhanced hydroxylation, and a well-organized hydrogen-bond network. In
contrast, the A-termination forms a more diffuse contact layer with weaker
templating, lower hydroxylation, and less ordered interfacial water. Extended
simulations further uncover proton transfer pathways, including intermittent
protonation of surface hydroxyls, migration of water molecules into the
epitaxial layer, and rare hydronium-like configurations.

### Diamagnetic Meissner response of odd-frequency superconducting pairing from quantum geometry

- **TL;DR**: 量子几何在多层系统中奇频超导对的迈斯纳响应中起关键作用，使奇频配对产生抗磁响应而非传统的顺磁响应，从而稳定奇频超导相。

We investigate the role of quantum geometry in the Meissner response for
odd-frequency superconducting pairs in multiband systems. Odd-frequency pairing
is traditionally associated with a paramagnetic Meissner response, which raises
questions about the stability of the superconducting phase, especially in
multiband systems where odd-frequency pairing is ubiquitous. Using analytical
calculations in a general two-band, we show that the quantum geometric
contribution to the Meissner response from odd-frequency pairs is always
diamagnetic for its interband processes, while intraband processes always yield
a paramagnetic response. With odd-frequency pairing itself generated by
interband pairing, an overall diamagnetic response may often be anticipated. We
confirm these results with numerical calculations of models with both flat and
dispersive bands. In flat band systems, where geometric effects dominate, the
diamagnetic odd-frequency response can even exceed the even-frequency
contribution, making odd-frequency pairs the primary source of the diamagnetic
Meissner response. In a dispersive two-band system with finite quantum
geometry, we similarly find a robust diamagnetic contribution from
odd-frequency pairing, even when the total response turns paramagnetic due to
even-frequency contributions. These results establish that quantum geometry
stabilizes odd-frequency superconductivity and also identify flat-band
materials as candidates for realizing odd-frequency superconductivity with a
diamagnetic Meissner effect.

The effective diffusion of Brownian particles in periodic potential has been
a central topic in nonequilibrium statistical physcis. A classical result is
the Lifson formula which provides the effective diffusion constant in periodic
potentials. Extending beyong periodicity, our recent work [arXiv:2504.16527]
has demonstrated that a modified Lifson expression remains valid for Brownian
motion in quasi-periodic potentials. In this work, we extend our previous
results by incorporating spatial quasi-periodic noise and examining different
stochastic interpretations, $\alpha\in[0,1]$. The proposed framework is simple,
computationally efficient, and unifies the treatment of diffusion in both
periodic and quasi-periodic systems.

### Statistics of Residual Stress in Random Microstructures: Mean-Field Estimates and Full-Field Validations

Fluctuations of local fields are crucial for the prediction of failure in
random composites across different scales as well as estimating the inelastic
behaviour of it. This can be quantified statistically through second moments of
the local fields, which can be quickly estimated using mean field
homogenization (MFH). However, the exact fluctuation field can be estimated
using full-field methods though it comes at the cost of intensive computational
resources and limited scalability to complex microstructures. In this work, MFH
is used to estimate the statistical variation of the field quantities and then
cross-verified with full-field methods for a linear-thermoelastic
homogenization problem. An analytical expression to calculate the second
moments of the local fields for a linear thermo-elastic problem using MFH is
obtained based on the Hill-Mandel condition. The expressions fundamentally rely
on the solution of linear elastic problem which in turn depends on the
derivatives of Hill's polarization tensor. Solution of this derivative term has
been analytically and semianalytically derived in previous work [1]. The
statistical distribution of residual stress tensor components and equivalent
stress in particulate and unidirectional fibrous composites, arising purely due
to differential thermal expansion, is computed and compared with full-field
homogenization. Full-field simulations indicated a non-Gaussian distribution of
stress components, whereas Weibull-like distributions for equivalent residual
stress. Nevertheless, the assumed Gaussian distribution in mean-field estimates
captures the essential features.

Topological magnons, quantized spin waves featuring nontrivial boundary
modes, present a promising route toward lossless information processing.
Realizing practical devices typically requires magnons excited in a controlled
manner to enable precise manipulation of their topological phases and transport
behaviors. However, their inherent charge neutrality and a high frequency
nature pose a significant challenge for nonvolatile control, especially via
electric means. Herein, we propose a general strategy for electrical control of
topological magnons in bilayer ferromagnetic insulators. With strong spin-layer
coupling, an applied vertical electric field induces an interlayer potential
imbalance that modifies intralayer Heisenberg exchanges between adjacent
layers. This electric-field-driven modulation competes with the bilayer's
intrinsic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, enabling the accurate tuning of
the band topology and nonreciprocal dynamics of magnons. More importantly, such
an electric control mechanism exhibits strong coupling with external magnetic
fields, unveiling new perspectives on magnetoelectric coupling in
charge-neutral quasiparticles

### Möbius-topological auxiliary function for $f$ electrons

$f$-electron systems exhibit a subtle interplay between strong spin--orbit
coupling and crystal-field effects, producing complex energy landscapes that
are somewhat cumbersome to compute. We introduce auxiliary functions,
constructed by extending hydrogen-like wave functions through a modification of
the Legendre function. These functions often possess a M\"obius-like topology,
satisfying $\psi(\varphi) = -\psi(\varphi + 2\pi)$, while their squared modulus
respects inversion symmetry. By aligning $|\psi|^2$ with the symmetry of the
crystal field, they allow rapid determination of eigenstate structures without
the need for elaborate calculations. The agreement with established results
indicates that these functions capture the essential physics while offering
considerable computational simplification.

### Hidden ferromagnetism of centrosymmetric antiferromagnets

- **TL;DR**: 该论文提出了一种将反常反铁磁态表示为单磁性子晶胞的方法，通过自旋轨道相互作用和晶格对称性约束，解释了反常霍尔效应和轨道磁性的出现机制。

The time-reversal symmetry ($\mathcal{T}$) breaking is a signature of
ferromagnetism, giving rise to such phenomena as the anomalous Hall effect
(AHE) and orbital magnetism (OM). Nevertheless, $\mathcal{T}$ can be also
broken in certain classes of antiferromagnets, such as weak ferromagnets or
altermagnets, which remain invariant under the spatial inversion. In the light
of this similarity with the ferromagnetism, it is tempting to ask whether such
anomalous antiferromagnetic (AFM) state can be presented as a simplest
ferromagnetic one, i.e. within a minimal unit cell containing only one magnetic
cite. We show that such presentation is possible due to the special form of the
spin-orbit (SO) interaction in an antiferroelectrically distorted lattice
hosting this AFM state. The inversion symmetry, combined with the lattice
translations, imposes a severe constraint on the form of the SO interaction,
which becomes invariant under the symmetry operation $\{ \mathcal{S}| {\bf t}
\}$, combining the $180^{\circ}$ rotation of spins ($\mathcal{S}$) with the
lattice shift ${\bf t}$, connecting antiferromagnetically coupled sublattices.
This is the fundamental symmetry property of centrosymmetric antiferromagnets,
which justifies the use of the generalized Bloch theorem and transformation to
the local coordinate frame with one magnetic cite per cell. It naturally
explains the emergence of AHE and OM, and provides transparent expressions for
these properties in terms of the electron hoppings and SO interaction operating
between nearest neighbors as well as the orthorhombic strain of the
next-nearest-neighbor hoppings. The idea is illustrated on a number of
examples, using realistic models derived from first-principles calculations.
These examples include two-dimensional square lattice, monoclinic VF$_4$ and
CuF$_2$, and RuO$_2$-type materials with the tetragonal symmetry.

We show that the combination of molecular chirality and phase controlled
driving can lead to rectification of vibrational energy transfer. We
demonstrate this effect using classical models of (1) a single helical chain
and (2) a more realistic model of polyethylene double helix. We examine the
effect of the driving frequency, polarization, and temperature on this
phenomenon. Notably, we find that the direction and magnitude of the observed
directionality preference depends on the driving frequency and phase, and that
the effect persists at room temperature.

### Short-time blowup statistics of a Brownian particle in repulsive potentials

We study the dynamics of an overdamped Brownian particle in a repulsive
scale-invariant potential $V(x) \sim -x^{n+1}$. For $n &gt; 1$, a particle
starting at position $x$ reaches infinity in a finite, randomly distributed
time. We focus on the short-time tail $T \to 0$ of the probability distribution
$P(T, x, n)$ of the blowup time $T$ for integer $n &gt; 1$. Krapivsky and Meerson
[Phys. Rev. E \textbf{112}, 024128 (2025)] recently evaluated the leading-order
asymptotics of this tail, which exhibits an $n$-dependent essential singularity
at $T = 0$. Here we provide a more accurate description of the $T \to 0$ tail
by calculating, for all $n = 2, 3, \dots$, the previously unknown large
pre-exponential factor of the blowup-time probability distribution. To this
end, we apply a WKB approximation -- at both leading and subleading orders --
to the Laplace-transformed backward Fokker--Planck equation governing $P(T, x,
n)$. For even $n$, the WKB solution alone suffices. For odd $n$, however, the
WKB solution breaks down in a narrow boundary layer around $x = 0$. In this
case, it must be supplemented by an ``internal'' solution and a matching
procedure between the two solutions in their common region of validity.

Neural operators (NOs) provide a new paradigm for efficiently solving partial
differential equations (PDEs), but their training depends on costly
high-fidelity data from numerical solvers, limiting applications in complex
systems. We propose a self-supervised neural operator (SNO) that generates
accurate and diverse training data on the fly without numerical solvers. SNO
consists of three parts: a physics-informed sampler (PI-sampler) based on
Bayesian PINNs for efficient data generation, a function encoder (FE) for
compact input-output representations, and an encoder-only Transformer for
operator learning, mapping boundary/initial conditions, source terms, and
geometries to PDE solutions. We validate SNO on 1D steady/unsteady nonlinear
reaction-diffusion equations, a 2D nonlinear PDE with varying geometries, and
vortex-induced vibration of a flexible cylinder in fluid dynamics. SNO achieves
high accuracy in all cases, and lightweight finetuning (O(100) trainable
variables) further improves predictions with only a few hundred steps. This
work provides a new route toward pretrained foundation models as efficient PDE
surrogates.

Non-reciprocal devices are key components in both classical and quantum
electronics. One approach to realizing passive non-reciprocal microwave devices
is through capacitive coupling between external electrodes and materials
exhibiting non-reciprocal conductance. In this work, we develop an analytic
framework that captures the response of such devices in the presence of
dissipation while accounting for the full AC dynamics of the material. Our
results yield an effective circuit model that accurately describes the device
response in experimentally relevant regimes even at small dissipation levels.
Furthermore, our analysis reveals counterpropagating features arising from the
intrinsic AC response of the material that could be exploited to dynamically
switch the non-reciprocity of the device, opening pathways for tunable
non-reciprocal microwave technologies.

The recent discovery of superconductivity in thin films of the bilayer
Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (La327) under compressive
strain has generated enormous interest, opening up further opportunities to
stabilize superconductivity in this class of materials at ambient pressure. To
better understand the many-body normal state from which superconductivity
arises, it is important to ascertain the nature and role of correlations in its
electronic structure. To provide insights into this question, we use a fully
charge self-consistent DFT+e-DMFT (eDMFT) approach to study La327 at several
compressive strain levels. At the strain level where superconductivity has been
observed experimentally (-2\%), in contrast with DFT and DFT+$U$ results, the
so-called $\gamma$ pocket emerges and the associated band, of mostly $d_{z^2}$
character, crosses the Fermi level exhibiting `flat band''-like features when
dynamical correlations are included. Larger strain levels suppress the $\gamma$
pocket, which may have implications for superconductivity or its pairing
symmetry.

The strategy of breaking AFM ground state of alpha-Fe2O3 by doping
non-magnetic Sc3+ (3d0) ions at the Fe3+ (3d5) sites has been used to
understand modified lattice-structure, magnetic spin order, and charge-spin
coupling in Fe$_{2-x}$Sc$_x$O$_3$ system ($x =$ 0.2, 0.5, 1.0). The material
has been stabilized in single-phased (rhombohedral $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$) or
mix-phased (rhombohedral alpha-Fe$_2$O$_3$ and cubic Sc$_2$O$_3$-types)
structures by varying the Sc content and heat treatment temperature. Neutron
diffraction confirmed magnetic moment approximately 2.75-4.68 Bohr-magneton per
Fe site and spin reorientation from in-plane to out of plane direction below
the Morin transition approximately 260 K. The material showed magnetic
coercivity (0.2 to 6 kOe). The electrical properties transformed from
insulating state (conductivity 10-14-10-10 S/cm and polarization 0.5-2
micro-C/cm$^2$) to high conductive state (conductivity approximately 10-10
-10-7 S/cm and polarization greater than 2 micro-C/cm$^2$) above Morin
transition. The material at 300 K produced the maximum current density 20-95
micro-A/cm$^2$, ferroelectric polarization 2.7-15.6 micro-C/cm$^2$, ME voltage
up to 5 mV with coupling coefficient 0.53 mV/Oe/cm and huge negative
magnetoconductance up to 90%. The results in the present hematite based canted
ferromagnetic materials are expected to be useful for applying in low power
spintronic devices.

Tensor network methods, such as time-dependent density matrix renormalization
group (TD-DMRG) and multi-layer multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree
(ML-MCTDH), are powerful tools for simulating quantum dynamics. While both
methods are theoretically exact in the limit of large bond dimensions, a recent
study reported up to 60% discrepancy in their calculations for exciton
dissociation. To resolve this inconsistency, we conduct a systematic comparison
using Renormalizer, a unified software framework for matrix product states
(MPS) and tree tensor network states (TTNS). By revisiting the benchmark
P3HT:PCBM heterojunction model, we show that the observed discrepancies arise
primarily from insufficient bond dimensions. By increasing bond dimensions, we
first reduce the difference to less than 10%. Further refinement using an
extrapolation scheme and an optimized tensor network structure lowers the
difference to approximately 2%. Our results confirm both methods converge to
numerically exact solutions when bond dimensions are adequately scaled. This
work not only validates the reliability of both methods but also provides
high-accuracy benchmark data for future developments in quantum dynamics
simulations.

The Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation is a celebrated non-linear stochastic
equation yielding non-equilibrium universal scaling. It exhibits notorious
non-perturbative aspects. The KPZ fixed point is strong-coupling, all the more

equation, called inviscid Burgers fixed point, has been recently unveiled.
These non-pertubative features can be theoretically accessed and studied in a
controlled way in all dimensions using the functional renormalisation group. We
propose an overview of the related results, which provide the full picture of
the fixed-point structure and associated scaling regimes of the KPZ equation in
$d=1$ and in higher dimensions.

best-characteristics-matching hardware units, while metamodel-space algebra
minimizes communication and precision requirements. Using 60,000 GPUs of
Aurora, DC-MESH (divide-and-conquer Maxwell-Ehrenfest-surface hopping) and
XS-NNQMD (excited-state neural-network quantum molecular dynamics) modules of
MLMD (multiscale light-matter dynamics) software were 152- and 3,780-times
faster than the state-of-the-art for 15.4 million-electron and 1.23
trillion-atom PbTiO3 material, achieving 1.87 EFLOP/s for the former. This
enabled the first study of light-induced switching of topological superlattices
for future ferroelectric 'topotronics'.

The ability to tune the degree of interaction among particles at the
nanoscale is highly intriguing. The spectroscopic signature of such interaction
is often subtle and requires special probes to observe. To this end,
inter-layer excitons trapped in the periodic potential wells of a moir\'e
superlattice offer rich interaction physics, specifically due to the presence
of both attractive and repulsive components in the interaction. Here we show
that the Coulomb force between two inter-layer excitons switches from repulsive
to attractive when the length scale reduces from inter-moir\'e-pocket to
intra-moir\'e-pocket in a WS$_2$/WSe$_2$ hetero-bilayer - thanks to the complex
competition between direct and exchange interaction. The finding is a departure
from the usual notion of repelling inter-layer excitons due to layer
polarization. This manifests as the simultaneous observation of an anomalous
superlinear power-law of moir\'e exciton and a stabilization of moir\'e trapped
biexciton. The experimental observation is facilitated by placing the
hetero-bilayer on a polymer-nanopillar/gold-film stack which significantly
reduces the inhomogeneous spectral broadening by selectively probing a smaller
ensemble of moir\'e pockets compared with a flat sample. This creates an
interesting platform to explore interaction among moir\'e trapped excitons and
higher order quasiparticles.

In many materials, ordered phases and their order parameters are easily
characterized by standard experimental methods. "Hidden order" refers to a
phase transition in which an ordered state emerges without such an easily
detectable order parameter, despite clear thermodynamic evidence of the
transition. The underlying mechanisms for these unconventional states of matter
stem from spin-orbit coupling, which intertwines inter-site exchange, classical
electron-magnetic interactions, and electron-lattice effects. This physics is
elusive to experimental probes and beyond traditional theories of insulating
magnetism, requiring sophisticated methodologies for its exploration. In this
Review, we survey exotic hidden-order phases in correlated insulators,
particularly focusing on the latest progress in material-specific theories and
numerical approaches. The relevant degrees of freedom in these phases are local
high-rank multipole moments of magnetic and charge density that emerge from
spin-orbit entangled correlated shells of heavy d and f electron ions and
interact on the lattice via various mechanisms. We discuss approaches to
modelling hidden orders in realistic systems via direct ab initio calculations
or by constructing low-energy many-body effective Hamiltonian. We also describe
how these new theoretical tools have helped to uncover driving mechanisms for
recently discovered multipolar phases in double perovskites of heavy transition
metals, and how they have proved instrumental in disentangling the role of
various interactions in "traditional" f-electron multipolar materials like
actinide dioxides. In both cases, material-specific theories have played a key
role in interpreting and predicting experimental signatures of hidden orders.

wurtzite-type ferroelectricity, and freestanding membranes ferroelectricity.
Moreover, multiferroic materials are reviewed, particularly the interplay
between novel magnetic states and ferroelectricity, as well as
ferrovalley-ferroelectric coupling. Finally, we conclude by discussing current
challenges and future opportunities in this field.

One of the intriguing effects due to conical intersections is the geometric
phase, manifested as destructive quantum interference in the nuclear
probability distribution. However, whether such geometric phaseinduced
interference can survive in dissipative environments remains an open question.
We demonstrate by numerically exact dissipative conical intersection dynamics
simulations that the destructive interference is highly robust against
non-Markovian quantum dissipation. To do so, we integrate the recently proposed
local diabatic representation to describe vibronic couplings and the
hierarchical equations of motion for system-bath interactions. Both vibrational
and electronic environments are considered. An intuitive path integral-like
picture isprovided to explain the robustness of geometric phase-induced
interference.

- **TL;DR**: 通过角分辨光电子能谱(ARPES)研究天然矿物超导体covellite(CuS)的实验能带结构，与DFT计算结果高度一致，揭示了结构相变的微妙特征和准二维电子性质

Covellite (CuS) is the first known natural mineral superconductor. Despite
its simple chemical formula, covellite exhibits a rich crystal structure at the
origin of several remarkable properties. The ionic arrangement in CuS crystals
leads to a mixed valence of Cu and a second-order structural transition at 55
K. Despite the abundance of structural studies and theoretical reports on its
electronic structure, there are scarce references on its experimental band
structure. By means of Angle Resolved PhotoEmission Spectroscopy (ARPES), we
have probed the experimental electronic structure of covellite. We compare our
results with the predictions of density-functional theory (DFT) calculations.
Our experimental data are in remarkable agreement with the calculations,
revealing subtle fingerprints of the structural phase transition, and
confirming the quasi-2D nature of the electronic structure of CuS.

We study the dynamics of Loschmidt echoes in noisy quantum many-body systems
without conservation laws. We first show that the operator Loschmidt echo in
noisy unitary dynamics is equivalent to the operator norm of the corresponding
dissipative dynamics upon noise averaging. We then analyze this quantity in two
complementary ways, revealing universal dynamical behavior. First, we develop a
heuristic picture for generic Floquet systems that connects Loschmidt echoes,
out-of-time-order correlators, and operator growth, which is valid at any
dissipation strength. We assert that the Loschmidt echo has two dynamical
regimes depending on the time $t$ and the strength of the noise $p$: Gaussian
decay for $pt\ll1$ and exponential decay (with a noise-independent decay rate)
for $pt\gg1$. Lastly, we rigorously prove all our results for a solvable
chaotic many-body quantum circuit, the dissipative random phase model -- thus
providing exact insight into dissipative quantum chaos.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究探索了无序系统在循环逆向设计中的适应机制，发现系统会演化到边际吸收流形(MAM)，这种流形编码了训练范围记忆，类似于循环驱动系统中的返回点记忆。

Many living and artificial systems improve their fitness or performance by
adapting to changing environments or diverse training data. However, it remains
unclear how such environmental variation influences adaptation, what is learned
in the process, and whether memory of past conditions is retained. In this
work, we investigate these questions using athermal disordered systems that are
subject to cyclic inverse design, enabling them to attain target elastic
properties spanning a chosen range. We demonstrate that such systems evolve
toward a marginally absorbing manifold (MAM), which encodes memory of the
training range that closely resembles return-point memory observed in
cyclically driven systems. We further propose a general mechanism for the
formation of MAMs and the corresponding memory that is based on gradient
discontinuities in the trained quantities. Our model provides a simple and
broadly applicable physical framework for understanding how adaptive systems
learn under environmental change and how they retain memory of past
experiences.

Carbon Nanotubes have shown to be an attractive option in the race to find a
replacement to silicon-based transistors, due to its high electrical
conductivity, extraordinary mechanical strength, and thermal conductivity.
However, challenges with regards to controlling the purity and chirality of
CNTs have raised doubts if the mass production of these transistors are even
viable. This paper explores the challenges of scalability and proposes methods
such as Liquid and Gas phase oxidative methods and microwave heating to tackle
the problem of metal impurities found within CNTs and the methods of Catalyst
Engineering and Chemical Vapor Deposition to control the chirality of CNTs. It
also suggests techniques such as Lithography, Screen Printing and Stack
Engineering to facilitate the large-scale production of CNT transistors. This
paper also attempts to explore the methods of Laser Ablation and Arc Discharge
that allows for the synthesis of CNTs of pure quality and high yield further
facilitating the rise of mass production of CNT transistors. The feasibility
and challenges relating to the integration of CNT transistors with already
pre-existing circuitry was also investigated and the methods of annealing and
potassium doping were studied and analyzed. The main aim of this paper is
providing a comprehensive guide to allow for the mass production and rapid
integration of CNT transistors into the semi-conductor market.

### Probing Non-Fermi-Liquid Behaviour of Composite Fermi Liquid via Efficient Thermal Simulations

The two-dimensional electron gas in a perpendicular magnetic field, i.e., the
quantum Hall system, is remarkably rich. At half filling of the lowest Landau
level, it has been predicted that ``composite fermions'' -- emergent
quasiparticle of an electron with two magnetic flux quanta -- can experience
zero net magnetic field and form a Fermi sea, dubbed composite Fermi liquid
(CFL). However, the seemingly simple appearance of CFL is a strongly correlated
quantum many-body state in disguise, and to solve it in a controlled manner is
extremely difficult, to the level that the thermodynamic properties of CFL is
still largely unknown. In this work, we perform state-of-the-art thermal tensor
network simulations on the $\nu=1/2$ Landau level systems, and observe
low-temperature power-law behaviour of the specific heat, signaling the gapless
nature of CFL. More importantly, the power is extracted to be closed to $2/3$,
clearly deviated from the ordinary linear-$T$ Fermi liquid behaviour,
suggesting the coupling between the CFs and the dynamical emergent gauge field
and therefore revealed the quantum many-body aspect of the CFL state. Relevance
of our methodology to other quantum Hall settings and moir\'e systems is
discussed.

large random supercells of hafnia and zirconia and study the relative phase
stability of the centrosymmetric cubic and monoclinic phases compared with the
polar orthorhombic phase. We find that Y2O3-doping stabilizes the polar
ferroelectric phase over the monoclinic baddeleyite phase in both hafnia and
zirconia.

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful and
widely used tools for molecular structure elucidation in organic chemistry.
However, the interpretation of NMR spectra to determine unknown molecular
structures remains a labor-intensive and expertise-dependent process,
particularly for complex or novel compounds. Although recent methods have been
proposed for molecular structure elucidation, they often underperform in
real-world applications due to inherent algorithmic limitations and limited
high-quality data. Here, we present NMR-Solver, a practical and interpretable
framework for the automated determination of small organic molecule structures
from $^1$H and $^{13}$C NMR spectra. Our method introduces an automated
framework for molecular structure elucidation, integrating large-scale spectral
matching with physics-guided fragment-based optimization that exploits
atomic-level structure-spectrum relationships in NMR. We evaluate NMR-Solver on
simulated benchmarks, curated experimental data from the literature, and
real-world experiments, demonstrating its strong generalization, robustness,
and practical utility in challenging, real-life scenarios. NMR-Solver unifies
computational NMR analysis, deep learning, and interpretable chemical reasoning
into a coherent system. By incorporating the physical principles of NMR into
molecular optimization, it enables scalable, automated, and chemically
meaningful molecular identification, establishing a generalizable paradigm for
solving inverse problems in molecular science.

### Disorder-aided Early Warning Signals: Predicting Catastrophic Shifts in Athermal Systems

The early prediction of tipping points, distinguished by sudden and
catastrophic shifts from stable states, poses a challenging task that would
enable us to assess the impending threat across natural and engineered systems.
This threat becomes particularly acute in low-fluctuation environments, where
tipping occurs through saddle-node bifurcation without prior warning in noise
dynamics. In this study, we investigate the tipping point dynamics of avalanche
catastrophes in low-fluctuation domain, employing model system like the zero
temperature random field Ising model and thermally deposited cobalt films. As
the system approaches the tipping point, avalanche activity reveals pronounced
critical behaviour, including critical slowing down, variance enhancement, and
a growing spatial correlation length--hallmarks that may serve as early warning
signals of impending collapse. Crucially, we demonstrate that increasing
disorder in the system reduces its vulnerability to catastrophic failure. In
highly disorder regimes, these early warning signals emerge well before the
transition, thereby providing a large margin for anticipation and mitigation.
This key finding suggests a protective role of disorder offering a novel
perspective on resilience in complex systems. Our results not only deepen the
understanding of tipping phenomena in disorder materials but also have broader
implications for forecasting regime shift in diverse real-world systems.

experiments. By developing a model using this framework, we could capture the
nonlinear orientation dynamics of an optically levitated, nearly cylindrically

features observed in the power spectral density of libration, which we show
arising from the interplay between confined libration and thermally driven
rotation around the particle symmetry axis.

Transport through zero-dimensional states in a tunneling barrier can occur
via co-tunneling, wherein a carrier occupying a state outside the range of
energies between the chemical potentials of the two leads hops to a lead, and
within the brief time permitted by the energy-time uncertainty relationship the
occupancy is replenished from the other lead. Here, we calculate the current in
such junctions using a Lindblad formalism within the Markovian approximation.
We consider transport in the Coulomb blockade regime with spin-polarized leads
and a magnetic field smaller than the coercive field of either lead.
Dependences on magnetic field and lead spin polarization of the spin blockade,
decoherence, and spin lifetime of the subsystems of this model are calculated.

The combination of localized magnetic moments, their frustration and
interaction with itinerant electrons is a key challenge of condensed matter
physics. Frustrated magnetic interactions promote degenerate ground states with
enhanced fluctuations, a topic that is predominantly studied in magnetic
insulators. The coupling between itinerant and localized electrons in metals
add complexity to the problem, and presently formulated only for extreme cases
in which the itinerant electrons mediate exchange between localized spins (RKKY
interaction) or suppress the formation of magnetic moments (Kondo screening).
Here, we report an in-depth experimental study of the distorted Kagome metal
YbAgGe, unravelling the open questions of how frustration, localized magnetism
and itinerant electrons are intertwined in frustrated Kondo metals. We find
that coupled itinerant and localized electrons give rise to dynamic magnetic
correlations below T* ~ 20 K. At lower temperature, frustrated magnetic
interactions establish anisotropic magnetic short-range correlations that
culminate into antiferromagnetic long-range order below TN = 0.68 K with a
significantly reduced modulated magnetic moment. We show that local moment
Hamiltonians can yield limited understanding of the microscopic behaviour in
frustrated metals, and prompt the extension of more sophisticated model
Hamiltonians incorporating itinerant effects.

The experimental observation of elusive post-diamond carbon phases at extreme
pressures remains a major challenge in high-pressure science. Using
metadynamics with coordination-number-based collective variables and SNAP
machine-learned interatomic potential, we uncover atomistic mechanisms
governing the transformation of cubic and hexagonal diamond into post-diamond
phases above 1.5 TPa. The transition initiates via homogeneous nucleation of
nanoscale liquid droplets, which rapidly crystallize into either BC8 (below 1.8
TPa) or simple cubic phases (above 2.1 TPa), once the liquid nucleus surpasses
a critical size. Favorable conditions for synthesizing BC8 are identified near
1.8 TPa and 3500--5000 K. Decompression pathways from simple cubic and BC8
phases were also simulated to study possible experimental recovery of
post-diamond carbon allotropes at ambient conditions. We also find a new
metastable low-enthalpy structure with four-coordinated carbon atoms and space
group P222. Our insights provide a theoretical foundation for experimental
discovery of ultra-dense carbon phases under extreme conditions.

The Hartree-Fock exchange potential is fundamental for capturing quantum
mechanical exchange effects but faces critical challenges in large-scale
applications due to its nonlocal and computationally intensive nature. This
study introduces a generalized framework for constructing approximate Fock
exchange operators in Hartree-Fock theory, addressing the computational
bottlenecks caused by the nonlocal nature. By employing low-rank decomposition
and incorporating adjustable variables, the proposed method ensures high
accuracy for occupied orbitals while maintaining Hermiticity and structural
consistency with the exact Fock exchange operator. Meanwhile, a two-level
nested self-consistent field iteration strategy is developed to decouple the
exchange operator stabilization (outer loop) and electron density refinement
(inner loop), significantly reducing computational costs. Numerical experiments
on several molecules demonstrate that the approximate exchange operators
achieve near-identical energies compared to that of the exact exchange operator
and the NWChem references, with substantial improvements in computational
efficiency.

### Reduced fidelities for free fermions out of equilibrium: From dynamical quantum phase transitions to Mpemba effect

We investigate the out-of-equilibrium dynamics after a quantum quench of the
reduced fidelities between the states of a subregion $A$ at different times.
Precisely, we consider the fidelity between the time-dependent state of $A$ and
its initial value, as well as with the state at infinite time. We denote these
fidelities as the reduced Loschmidt echo (RLE) and the final-state fidelity
(FSF), respectively. If region $A$ is the full systems, the RLE coincide with
the standard Loschmidt echo. We focus on quenches from Gaussian states in
several instances of the XY spin chain. In the hydrodynamic limit of long times
and large sizes of $A$, with their ratio fixed, the reduced fidelities admit a
quasiparticle picture interpretation. Interestingly, for some quenches in the
hydrodynamic regime the RLE features a complicated structure with an infinite
sequence of nested lightcones, corresponding to quasiparticles with arbitrary
large group velocities. This leads to a ''staircase'' of cusp-like
singularities in the time-derivative of the fidelity. At the sub-hydrodynamic
regime for some quenches the RLE exhibits cusp-like singularities, similar to
the so-called dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPT). We conjecture a
criterion for the occurrence of the DQPT and for the ''critical'' times at
which the singularities occur. Finally, we discuss the hydrodynamic limit of
the FSF. In particular, we show that it provides a valuable tool to detect the
so-called quantum Mpemba effect.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究开发了结合数学和计算方法来估计传染病传播树概率的框架，通过整合感染人数、地理位置和基因信息的感染概率、感染和采样时间等数据，使用MCMC方法采样传播树并分析网络特性。

We investigate how the properties of epidemic networks change depending on
the availability of different types of data on a disease outbreak. This is
achieved by introducing mathematical and computational methods that estimate
the probability of transmission trees by combining generative models that
jointly determine the number of infected hosts, the probability of infection
between them depending on location and genetic information, and their time of
infection and sampling. We introduce a suitable Markov Chain Monte Carlo method
that we show to sample trees according to their probability. Statistics
performed over the sampled trees lead to probabilistic estimations of network
properties and other quantities of interest, such as the number of unobserved
hosts and the depth of the infection tree. We confirm the validity of our
approach by comparing the numerical results with analytically solvable
examples. Finally, we apply our methodology to data from COVID-19 in Australia.
We find that network properties that are important for the management of the
outbreak depend sensitively on the type of data used in the inference.

Critical edge states appear at the bulk gap closing points of topological
transitions. Their emergence signify the existence of topologically nontrivial
critical points, whose descriptions fall outside the scope of gapped
topological matter. In this work, we reveal and characterize topological
critical points and critical edge states in non-Hermitian systems. By applying
the Cauchy's argument principle to two characteristic functions of a
non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, we obtain a pair of winding numbers, whose
combination yields a complete description of gapped and gapless topological
phases in one-dimensional, two-band non-Hermitian systems with sublattice
symmetry. Focusing on a broad class of non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger
chains, we demonstrate the applicability of our theory for characterizing
gapless symmetry-protected topological phases, topologically distinct critical
points, phase transitions along non-Hermitian phase boundaries and their
associated topological edge modes. Our findings not only generalize the
concepts of topologically nontrivial critical points and critical edge modes to
non-Hermitian setups, but also yield additional insights for analyzing
topological transitions and bulk-edge correspondence in open systems.

### Transient Dynamical Phase Diagram of the Spin-Boson Model at Finite Temperature

We present numerically exact inchworm quantum Monte Carlo results for the
real-time dynamics of the spin polarization in the sub-Ohmic spin--boson model
at finite temperature. We focus in particular on the localization and coherence
behavior of the model, extending our previous study at low temperature [Phys.
Rev. Lett. 134, 056502 (2025)]. As the temperature increases, the system
becomes less localized and less coherent. The loss of coherence, which is
controlled by two independent mechanisms -- a smooth damping-driven crossover
and a sharp frequency-driven transition -- exhibits a nontrivial temperature
dependence. While both types of coherence loss occur at lower coupling in the
high temperature regime, the frequency exhibits a sharper drop at high
temperatures and this drop is observed for all values of the sub-Ohmic
exponent, in contrast to the zero-temperature case. We discuss the full
temperature-dependent dynamical phase diagram of the system and the interplay
between coherence and localization across a wide range of physical parameters.

### Sliding-induced ferrovalley polarization and possible antiferromagnetic half-metal in bilayer altermagnets

Altermagnets, a newly discovered class of materials, exhibit zero net
magnetization while hosting spin-split electronic bands. However, monolayer
altermagnets maintain degenerate band gaps at the high-symmetry X and Y points
in the Brillouin zone, manifesting a paravalley phase characterized by
unpolarized valley states. In this work, we demonstrate that spontaneously
broken valley degeneracy can be achieved through interlayer sliding in
engineered M$_2$A$_2$B and M$_2$AA$'$B bilayer altermagnets by first-principles
calculations and minimal microscopic model. We propose a promising route to
achieve antiferromagnetic half-metal driven by sliding and emergent ferrovalley
phase without applied electric field, which is realized in the V$_2$SSeO
engineered bilayer. Our calculations also reveal that Mo$_2$O$_2$O exhibits the
largest valley splitting gap of ~0.31 eV, making it a promising candidate for
valley-spin valve devices. Furthermore, band structure calculations on
Mo$_2$AA$'$O materials demonstrate that increasing the difference in atomic
number ($\Delta$Z) between A and A$'$ site atoms effectively enhances valley
polarization. This work establishes a novel platform for discovering and
controlling ferrovalley states in altermagnetic systems.

- **TL;DR**: 这篇论文通过模拟STM图像研究了kekulene和isokekulene分子在铜表面上的充电转移机制，并验证了高选择性合成的效果

On-surface synthesis has allowed for the tuneable preparation of numerous
molecular systems with variable properties. Recently, we demonstrated the
highly selective synthesis of kekulene (&gt;99%) on Cu(111) and isokekulene (92%)
on Cu(110) from the same molecular precursor (Ruan et al., Angew. Chem. Int.
Ed. 2025, e202509932). Scanning tunneling microscopy with CO-functionalized
tips can identify the single molecules on the basis of their geometric
structure at a low coverage on Cu(110), but it also detects complex features
due to electronic contributions close to the Fermi energy. Here, we investigate
the origin of these features by simulating STM images based on a weighted sum
of multiple molecular orbitals, for which we employ weights based on the
calculated molecular-orbital projected density of states. This allows for an
experimental confirmation of charge transfer from the surface into multiple
formerly unoccupied molecular orbitals for single molecules of kekulene as well
as isokekulene in its two nonplanar adsorption configurations. In comparison,
the area-integrating photoemission orbital tomography technique confirms the
charge transfer as well as the high selectivity for the formation of a full
monolayer of mainly isokekulene on Cu(110). Our STM-based approach is
applicable to a wide range of adsorbed molecular systems and specifically also
suited for strongly interacting surfaces, nonplanar molecules, and such
molecules which can only be prepared at extremely low yields.

### Generalized Rényi Entropy Production Rate in Non-equilibrium Systems: From Markov Processes to Chaotic Dynamics

A generalization of the entropy production rate is proposed $\Pi_q$ in
non-equilibrium systems by extending the formalism of classical stochastic
thermodynamics to regimes with non-Gaussian fluctuations. Through the R\'enyi
entropy $S_q$ , where entropic parameter $q$ modulates critical fluctuations,
it is defined $\Pi_q$ and the postulated generalized $q$-affinity ${\cal A}_q$
for Markov processes, where it is demonstrated that $\Pi_q \geq 0$,
generalizing the second thermodynamics law.The derived formal framework was
applied to the R\"ossler model, a nonlinear dynamical system exhibiting chaos.
Numerical simulations show that the entropy production rate $\Pi_q$ can be used
as an index of robustness and complexity by quantitatively corroborating the
greater robustness of funnel-type chaos compared to spiral-type chaos. Our
results reveal limitations of Gibbs-Shannon entropy in capturing non-Gaussian
fluctuations induced by nonlinearity. On the contrary, it is found that $\Pi_q$
it can be a suitable magnitude to measure the intensity of chaotic dynamics
through the entropy parameter $q$ , indicating a plausible link with Lyapunov
exponents. The proposed formal framework extends the scope of stochastic
thermodynamics to complex systems, integrating chaotic dynamics and the role of
the entropic index q as a source of irreversibility and in capturing
non-Gaussian contributions to entropy production.

### Probing the partition function for temperature-dependent potentials with nested sampling

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种基于扩展配分函数的新方法，通过将温度作为额外采样参数，在单次运行中计算温度依赖的有效势能系统的配分函数，解决了传统嵌套采样方法需要为每个温度单独计算的问题。

Thermodynamic properties can be in principle derived from the partition
function, which, in many-atom systems, is hard to evaluate as it involves a sum
on the accessible microscopic states. Recently, the partition function has been
computed via nested sampling, relying on Bayesian statistics, which is able to
provide the density of states as a function of the energy in a single run,
independently of the temperature. This appealing property is lost whenever the
potential energy that appears in the partition function is
temperature-dependent: for instance, mean-field effective potential energies or
the quantum partition function in the path-integral formalism. For these cases,
the nested sampling must be carried out at each temperature, which results in a
massive increase of computational time. Here, we introduce and implement a new
method, that is based on an extended partition function where the temperature
is considered as an additional parameter to be sampled. The extended partition
function can be evaluated by nested sampling in a single run, so to restore
this highly desirable property even for temperature-dependent effective
potential energies. We apply this original method to compute the quantum
partition function for harmonic potentials and Lennard-Jones clusters at low
temperatures and show that it outperforms the straightforward application of
nested sampling for each temperature within several temperature ranges.

### Quantum Spin Hall effect on planar Archimedean lattices

- **TL;DR**: 对8种阿基米德晶格进行系统紧束缚研究，发现多个晶格存在平坦带和拓扑边缘态，特别是截断三六边形晶格具有高度自旋极化的拓扑保护边缘态

Archimedean lattices constitute a unique family of two-dimensional tilings
formed from regular polygons arranged with uniform vertex configurations. While
the kagome lattice has been extensively studied and the snub square lattice has
served as a quasicrystal approximant, the broader family remains comparatively
unexplored in the context of electronic and topological properties. In this
work, we present a systematic tight-binding study of all eight pure Archimedean
lattices, incorporating both $s$ and $p$ orbitals. We analyze their band
structures, investigate topological edge states arising from unconventional
nanoribbon geometries, and evaluate $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariants as well as
intrinsic spin Hall conductivities using the Kubo formalism. Our results reveal
that several Archimedean lattices, such as the truncated hexagonal and
truncated trihexagonal lattices, host nearly dispersionless flat bands
extending across the Brillouin zone, which remain robust even in the presence
of next-nearest-neighbor hopping and strong spin-orbit coupling. In particular,
the truncated trihexagonal lattice supports topologically protected, highly
spin-polarized edge states across multiple ribbon geometries. These states are
stable against defects and spin-flip scattering, and they give rise to sizable
spin Hall currents.

In two-dimensional (2D) nearly square-lattice quantum materials, electron
correlations can induce an electronic nematic phase with twofold rotational
($C_2$) symmetry that profoundly impacts their properties. For 2D materials
with threefold rotational ($C_3$) symmetry, such as the honeycomb lattice, a
vestigial three-state Potts nematic order has been observed in the van der
Waals antiferromagnet (AFM) FePSe$_3$ via optical and thermodynamic methods
under uniaxial strain. Here, we use neutron scattering to study the magnetic
order and spin excitations of FePSe$_3$ under uniaxial strain. In the AFM
ordered state, we find that $\sim$0.6% tensile strain significantly suppresses
one zigzag domain and promotes the other two, lowering the AFM order and spin
waves to $C_2$ symmetry. The broken $C_3$ symmetry in spin excitations persists
slightly above $T_{\rm{N}}\approx 108.6$ K, where the zigzag AFM order is
absent. Our results thus provide direct evidence of magnetoelastic coupling and
suggest that the three-state Potts nematicity in paramagnetic spin excitations
arises from the vestigial order associated with the low-temperature zigzag AFM
order.

### "One defect, one potential" strategy for accurate machine learning prediction of defect phonons

Atomic vibrations play a critical role in phonon-assisted electron
transitions at defects in solids. However, accurate phonon calculations in
defect systems are often hindered by the high computational cost of
large-supercell first-principles calculations. Recently, foundation models,
such as universal machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs), emerge as a
promising alternative for rapid phonon calculations, but the quantitatively low
accuracy restricts its fundamental applicability for high-level defect phonon
calculations, such as nonradiative carrier capture rates. In this paper, we
propose a "one defect, one potential" strategy in which an MLIP is trained on a
limited set of perturbed supercells. We demonstrate that this strategy yields
phonons with accuracy comparable to density functional theory (DFT), regardless
of the supercell size. The predicted accuracy of defect phonons is validated by
phonon frequencies, Huang-Rhys factors, and phonon dispersions. Further
calculations of photoluminescence (PL) spectra and nonradiative capture rates
based on this defect-specific model also show good agreements with DFT results,
meanwhile reducing the computational expenses by more than an order of
magnitude. Our approach provides a practical pathway for studying defect
phonons in 10$^4$-atom large supercell with high accuracy and efficiency.

Modeling lithium's atomic-scale behavior is critical for its roles in
plasma-facing fusion components and lithium-ion batteries, yet it remains
challenging across phase regimes. This study benchmarks ReaxFF, 2NN-MEAM, and
SNAP potentials from 100 to 1000 K using molecular dynamics, with ensemble and
cooling protocols carefully controlled. Compared to reliable experimental data,
ReaxFF diverges above 800 K, underestimating density by ~10% at 1000 K and
overestimating diffusivity, yielding anomalously low-density liquid behavior.
Radial distribution functions and coordination profiles further reveal possible
excessive disorder above 800 K. While ReaxFF offers qualitative insight into
disordered lithium, its quantitative reliability diminishes at high
temperatures, requiring validation against ab initio or experimental
benchmarks. These findings inform potential selections for fusion- and
battery-relevant simulations, underscoring the sensitivity of glassy phase
modeling to potential choices and thermal histories.

In this work, we propose two models of coupled harmonic oscillators under
Brownian motion to computationally study the applications of fluctuation
theorems. This paper also illustrates how to analytically calculate free energy
differences for these systems. The computational results clearly show that
Crooks relation is able to predict free energy differences between initial and
final canonical ensembles with around $1\%$ accuracy by using probability
distributions of cumulative work done during nonequilibrium protocols carried
out with velocities up to three orders of magnitude larger than the
quasi-stationary evolution velocity. The curves of instantaneous force and
cumulative work for the second model resemble those obtained experimentally on
the unfolding of ARN molecules. Hence, the proposed systems are not just useful
to illustrate the performance and conceptual significance of the fluctuation
theorems, but also they could be studied as simplified models for biophysical
systems.

Open-source simulation frameworks are evolving rapidly to provide accessible
tools for the numerical solution of partial differential equations. Modern
finite element (FEM) software such as FEniCS, Firedrake, or dune-fem alleviates
the need for modelers to recode the discretization and linear solver backend
for each application and enables rapid prototyping of solvers. However, while
it has become easier to build prototype FEM models, creating a solver reusable
beyond its specific initial simulation setup remains difficult. Moreover,
simulation setups typically cover an ample input parameter space, and tracking
complex metadata on research project time scales has become a challenge. This
implies the need to supplement model development with a coding-intensive
complementary workstream, seldom developed for sustainable reuse. To address
these issues, we introduce our open-source Python package Bryne. Bryne is an
object-oriented framework for FEM solvers built with the dune-fem Python API.
In this article, we describe how it helps to evolve rapid-prototyping solver
development into sustainable simulation building. First, we show how to
translate a minimal dune-fem solver into a Bryne FEM model to build
human-readable, metadata-enriched simulations. Bryne then offers a simulation
driver and model coupling interfaces to combine implemented solvers in
operator-split multiphysics simulations. The resulting reproducibility-enabled
infrastructure allows users to tackle complex simulation setups without
sacrificing backend flexibility. We demonstrate the workflow on a
convection-coupled phase-change simulation, where a discontinuous Galerkin flow
solver is coupled with a solver for solidification phase change.

- **TL;DR**: Error

Optical control of magnetization has emerged as a promising approach to
achieve ultrafast and energy-efficient magnetization reversal. Here, we
investigate helicity-dependent switching of magne- tization driven by the
resonant excitation of circularly-polarized transverse-optical phonons, using a
polarization-modulated transient grating. Our results show that the polarized
phonons within the sample substrate induce robust, helicity-defined
magnetization reversal in the magnetic overlayer. Moreover, the quality of
switching remains largely unaffected when the degree of ellipticity of the
infrared excitation is varied at frequencies resonant with the targeted phonon
modes. Conversely, as the excitation is moved slightly off-resonance, switching
quality becomes highly sensitive to the ellipticity of the incident light.

The ilmenite NiTiO3 consists of a buckled honeycomb lattice, with the Ni
spins aligned ferromagnetically in-plane and antiferromagnetically
out-of-plane. Using neutron spectroscopy, the magnetic structure and the
dynamics were investigated as a function of temperature. Dispersive acoustic
bands and nearly dispersionless optical bands at ~3.7 meV are described by a
highly anisotropy Heisenberg model with stronger antiferromagnetic (AFM)
out-of-plane, weaker ferromagnetic (FM) in-plane interactions and an anisotropy
gap of 0.95 meV. The order parameter yields a critical exponent between the
Heisenberg and two-dimensional Ising models, consistent with highly anisotropic
Heisenberg systems. The frustration parameter ~ 2 supports a weakly frustrated
system.

Separation of hydrocarbon isomers with closely matched physicochemical
properties remains an energetically demanding challenge in the petrochemical
refineries. This study presents a comparative analysis of three methods: the
fractional distillation, the Molex process, and the Levi-Blow (LB) technique.
Using experimentally validated thermodynamic data and heat-transfer estimates,
we quantify the energy expenditure and number of cycles required to achieve
ultrahigh-purity separation. The LB method achieves eight-9s purity in a single
cycle with just 39.4~kJ/mol, while fractional distillation and Molex require
multiple iterations and up to five orders of magnitude more energy. Each method
is also benchmarked against the thermodynamic minimum work of separation of the
mixture of interest. It is found that the LB technique operates within a factor
of 23 of this lower bound, compared to $\sim 10^2$ for Molex (Molex is a
trademark and/or service mark of UOP Inc.) and $\sim 10^5$ for fractional
distillation, demonstrating its thermodynamic and operational superiority.

- **TL;DR**: 研究记忆衰减如何影响具有偏好重访机制的随机行走模型中的空间学习过程，发现适度的遗忘（1/τ衰减）可以加速学习而不影响定位稳定性

Random walks on lattices with preferential relocation to previously visited
sites provide a simple modeling of the displacements of animals and humans.
When the lattice contains a single impurity or resource site where the walker
spends more time on average at each visit than on the other sites, the long
range memory can suppress diffusion and induce by reinforcement a steady state
localized around the resource. This phenomenon can be identified with a spatial
learning process by the walker. Here we study theoretically and numerically how
the decay of memory impacts learning in these models. If memory decays as
$1/\tau$ or slower, where $\tau$ is the time backward into the past, the
localized solutions are the same as with perfect, non-decaying memory and they
are linearly stable. If forgetting is faster than $1/\tau$, for instance
exponential, an unusual regime of intermittent localization is observed, where
well localized periods of exponentially distributed duration are interspersed
with intervals of diffusive motion. At the transition between the two regimes,
for a kernel in $1/\tau$, the approach to the stable localized state is the
fastest, opposite to the expected critical slowing down effect. Hence
forgetting can allow the walker to save memory without compromising learning
and to achieve a faster learning. These findings agree with biological evidence

Realizing exotic Hamiltonians beyond the Ising model is a key pursuit in
experimental statistical physics. One such example is the Blume-Capel model, a
three-state spin model, whose phase diagram features a tricritical point where
second-order and first-order transition lines converge, leading to a
coexistence of paramagnetic, ferromagnetic, and disordered phases. Here, we
realize an artificial crystal of single-domain nanomagnets, placed on the links
of the Ruby lattice, enabling real-space observation of the Blume-Capel degrees
of freedom. These Blume-Capel degrees of freedom are represented by the
presence, sign and interactions of the toroidal moments that emerge naturally
in plaquettes of nanomagnets in the Ruby artificial spin ice. By precisely
tuning the lattice parameters of the Ruby artificial spin ice, we demonstrate
control over the two-step ordering process of the toroidal moments, whereby
there is a high-temperature crossover from a paramagnetic phase to an
intermediate paratoroidic regime, followed by a second-order phase transition
to a ferrotoroidic ground state. This sequence of toroidal phases and
transitions is accurately captured by the Blume-Capel framework and provides a
direct realization of a substantial portion of the phase diagram associated
with the model. This establishes a new platform for exploring exotic
Hamiltonians in terms of artificial spin ice superstructures, here with groups
of nanomagnets forming toroidal moments. The success of this mapping paves the
way for an entirely new frontier in artificial spin ice: intentionally
engineering lattice designs whose effective Hamiltonians mediate unconventional
forms of magnetic order, with new behaviors and functionalities.

The emergence of ferro- and ferrimagnetic behavior in insulating materials is
uncommon, largely due to Hund's rules. Utilizing symmetry analysis,
first-principles methods, and classical Monte Carlo simulations,
\textcolor{black}{we report technologically important insulating ferro and
ferrimagnetic double-double perovskite oxides. Our study predicts
LaA$^{\prime}$MnNiO$_6$ (A$^{\prime}$ = V, Cr, Mn, Co, and Ni) as promising
candidates for spintronic and optical applications exhibiting band gaps between
1.3 eV and 1.9 eV. We explain the mechanisms driving band gap openings and
magnetic exchange interactions in these ferro and ferrimagnetic compounds.
Monte Carlo simulations, together with state-of-the-art orbital-decomposed
exchange parameter analysis, reveal intriguing variations in magnetic
transition temperatures (up to 242 K) and the corresponding exchange mechanisms
in all LaA$^{\prime}$MnNiO$_6$ compounds.} In addition, we assess the
thermodynamic and dynamic stability of these compounds to comment on the
feasibility of these systems.

- **TL;DR**: 本文提出了RPI+PC方法，通过引入三阶和四阶势能导数来修正环聚合物框架下的瞬子速率理论，显著提高了瞬子理论在量子隧穿计算中的精度。

In this paper, we derive a perturbatively-corrected instanton rate theory in
the ring-polymer framework (RPI+PC), which significantly enhances the accuracy
of instanton theory by using third and fourth derivatives of the potential to
capture anharmonic effects. Instanton theory is a rigorous semiclassical method
that extends transition-state theory by including quantum tunneling along a
well-defined optimal tunneling pathway. However, the standard leading-order
instanton theory (RPI) neglects anharmonicity perpendicular to this tunneling
path. The RPI+PC method described here corrects this using only local
information along the same instanton trajectory as the leading-order theory.
Hence, RPI+PC does not require a global potential energy surface and is readily
applicable in combination with ab initio electronic-structure methods. The
derivation of the RPI+PC result is performed within the flux-correlation
formalism using standard techniques from asymptotic analysis, and the final
rate expression is shown to be independent of the choice of dividing surface.
We demonstrate that RPI+PC represents a systematic improvement over RPI by
analyzing its asymptotic properties in the semiclassical limit ($\hbar\to0$
with total thermal time $\tau^{\mathrm{tot}}=\beta\hbar$ kept constant) and
illustrate its improved performance on a series of model systems for which
exact results are available for comparison, including the collinear H+H$_2$
reaction and its isotopic variants.

### Thermodynamic uncertainty relation for generalized time-reversal observables

Time-reversal symmetry plays an essential role in the thermodynamic
uncertainty relation, which bound the fluctuations of observables in terms of
the associated dissipation. In fact, thermodynamic uncertainty relations are
typically derived under the assumption that the observable of interest is
antisymmetric under time reversal. This also suggests that existing
thermodynamic uncertainty relations are restricted to a limited class of
observables. In this paper, we mitigate this restriction by introducing a new
class of observables that do not exhibit the exact antisymmetry but only change
the sign under time reversal. We call it generalized time reversal and derive a
broadly applicable thermodynamic uncertainty relation for observables with this
condition. The generalization is achieved by direct statistical arguments on
the probability distributions of dissipation and the observable, and holds for
both deterministic and stochastic dynamics. We demonstrate the derived
thermodynamic uncertainty relation in a quantum refrigeration model, showing
that the precision of generalized observables remains expressible in terms of
the heat-dissipation cost. The result extends the scope of thermodynamic
uncertainty relations beyond what was reached by frameworks relying on strong
symmetries imposed by fluctuation theorems.

### Dipolar Nematic State in Relaxor Ferroelectrics

Relaxor ferroelectrics exhibit exceptional dielectric and electromechanical
properties, yet their microscopic origins remain elusive due to the interplay
of hierarchical polar structures and chemical complexity. While models based on
polar nanoregions or nanodomains offer valuable phenomenological insights, they
often lack the first-principles predictive capability necessary for
quantitatively describing functional properties such as piezoelectric
coefficients. Here, we use large-scale molecular dynamics simulations, enabled
by a universal first-principles-based machine-learning interatomic potential,
to investigate atomic-scale polar dynamics in canonical Pb-, Bi-, and Ba-based
relaxors. Across all systems, we uncover a universal dipolar nematic state,
characterized by long-range orientational order of local polarizations without
local alignment, challenging conventional polar cluster-based paradigms. We
introduce a universal order parameter, derived from the skewness of the
distributions of the local polarization autocorrelation functions, that
captures the thermal evolution of both lead-based and lead-free systems within
a single master curve. This nematic order, and its robust structural memory
under electric field cycling, underpins key relaxor phenomena, including
diffuse phase transition, frequency-dependent dielectric dispersion, and
reversible giant piezoelectricity. Our findings establish a unified microscopic
framework for relaxors and present a broadly applicable statistical approach to
understanding complex disordered materials.

### Electron transfer between surface-acoustic-wave-induced moving and static quantum dots

Fast long-range interactions between distant quantum dots in arrays remains
an unsolved issue, which can be key to solve scalability issues in quantum
simulation and computation processes, particularly related to the overhead
associated with quantum error correction schemes. Furthermore, transport
between static and moving quantum dots, relevant in surface acoustic wave
induced experiments, has not been studied in detail. This article presents a
paradigmatic model for picturing this process, where non-adiabatic terms
driving a two-state transfer process are derived and discussed. Moreover, the
main effects in the spin state of the electron and its effect on the transfer
probability of the loading are analyzed including the most relevant interaction
in semiconductor heterostructure induced 2 dimensional electron gases i.e. the
Rashba-Dresselhaus terms.

Magnetic anisotropy is a key parameter to describe the exchange bias effect
in heterostructures. In this paper, we describe explicit density functional
calculations of the magnetic structure of an interface between the industrially
critically antiferromagnetic material, IrMn, and Fe, which together form a
simple ferromagnet-antiferromagnet heterostructure. Additionally, the magnetic
anisotropy was evaluated for several terminations of the IrMn. It was found
that the [111] surface had a perpendicular anisotropy of 1.62
meV/$\text{\AA}^2$, whereas the two possible [100] surfaces (Ir-rich and
Mn-rich) had in-plane anisotropies of 0.13 meV/$\text{\AA}^2$ and 1.39
meV/$\text{\AA}^2$ respectively. The affect of the magnetic order of the easy
and hard configurations were calculated and used to explain the relative values
of the anisotropies.

### Membrane-Electrode Assemblies for Electrochemical Reduction of CO2 to Ethylene: Design for Minimal Energy Consumption

- **TL;DR**: 使用多物理连续模型研究MEA单元中铜电极的电化学CO2转化到乙烯的性能，发现电极层厚度和激活表面积对乙烯选择性和电压有显著影响

Membrane-electrode-assembly (MEA) cells with copper (Cu) cathodes show strong
potential for electrochemical CO2 reduction to ethylene (C2H4), but achieving
high C2H4 selectivity remains a challenge due to competing hydrogen evolution.
This selectivity is highly sensitive to the local microenvironment near the Cu
catalyst surface. In this study, a 1-D, multiphysics continuum model is
utilized to investigate how MEA cell performance and faradaic efficiency (FE)
to C2H4 are affected by both component properties and operating conditions,
with particular focus on coupled transport and reaction phenomena. Key
parameters include cathode electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) and
catalyst layer thickness. Halving catalyst layer thickness increases FE to C2H4
by 2% and lowers the cell voltage by 40 mV. In contrast, a tenfold decrease in
ECSA results increases the FE to C2H4 by 7% but leads increase cell voltage at
a given current density by 150 mV. This tradeoff occurs because the potential
distribution within the cathode catalyst layer is the primary driving force for
C2H4 formation. Increased cell voltage also raises the energy cost of C2H4
production. This model framework enables techno-economic assessments and
identifies key factors that must be optimized to enable economically viable
production of C2H4 via electrochemical reduction of CO2.

### Boundary Renormalization Group Flow of Entanglement Entropy at a (2+1)-Dimensional Quantum Critical Point

We investigate the second order R\'enyi entanglement entropy at the quantum
critical point of spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on a columnar
dimerized square lattice. The universal constant $\gamma$ in the area-law
scaling $S_{2}(\ell) = \alpha\ell - \gamma$ is found to be sensitive to the
entangling surface configurations, with $\gamma_{\text{sp}} &gt; 0$ for
strong-bond-cut (special) surfaces and $\gamma_{\text{ord}} &lt; 0$ for
weak-bond-cut (ordinary) surfaces, which is attributed to the distinct
conformal boundary conditions. Introducing boundary dimerization drives a
renormalization group (RG) flow from the special to the ordinary boundary
criticality, and the constant $\gamma$ decreases monotonically with increasing
dimerization strength, demonstrating irreversible evolution under the boundary
RG flow. These results provide strong numerical evidence for a
higher-dimensional analog of the $g$-theorem, and suggest $\gamma$ as a
characteristic function for boundary RG flow in (2+1)-dimensional conformal
field theory.

- **TL;DR**: 通过DFT和机器学习分子动力学研究AlScN的铁电极化切换机制，发现畴壁动力学在降低矫顽场中的关键作用，提出畴工程是控制矫顽场和增强器件性能的有效途径。

Aluminum nitride is a traditional wide-bandgap semiconductor that has been
widely used in high-power electronic and optoelectronic devices. Recently,
scandium-doped aluminum nitride (AlScN) was shown to host ferroelectricity with
high remnant polarization and excellent thermal stability. However, its
practical use is currently limited by its high coercive field, $E_c$.
Understanding the atomic-scale switching mechanism is essential to guide
strategies for reducing $E_c$. Here, we combine density functional theory and
machine-learning molecular dynamics to investigate polarization switching
mechanisms in AlScN over various Sc concentrations and applied electric fields.
We find that collective switching induces excessive lattice strain and is
therefore unlikely to occur. Rather, pre-existing domain walls relieve strain
and lead to a distinct switching dynamics, with the associated switching
mechanism being field dependent. More precisely, at low electric fields,
switching proceeds via gradual domain-wall propagation, well described by the
Kolmogorov-Avram-Ishibashi model; meanwhile high fields trigger additional
nucleation events, producing rapid and more homogeneous reversal, whose mixed
switching process is better described by the simultaneous non-linear nucleation
and growth model. These findings highlight the critical role of domain-wall
dynamics in nitride ferroelectrics and suggest that domain engineering provides
a viable route to control coercive fields and enhance device performance.

### Unravelling the unique kinetic interactions between N2O and unsaturated hydrocarbons

- **TL;DR**: 本研究发现了N2O与不饱和烃之间新的直接反应路径，通过量子化学计算和实验验证揭示了这些反应机制，显著提升了低温下点火延迟时间的预测准确性。

The interaction between unsaturated hydrocarbons and N2O has attracted
considerable attention in recent years due to their important roles as
potential propellants for advanced propulsion systems e.g. NOFBX, key
combustion intermediates in EGR systems, and as major pollutants and precursors
in atmospheric chemistry. Although experimental studies and kinetic models have
been developed to investigate its fuel chemistry, discrepancies remain between
modeled and measured ignition delay times at low temperatures. In this work, we
characterize previously unreported direct interaction pathways between N2O and
unsaturated hydrocarbons C2H4, C3H6, C2H2, and C3H4 through quantum chemistry
calculations, comprehensive kinetic modeling, and experimental validation.
These reactions proceed via O-atom addition from N2O to unsaturated
hydrocarbons, forming five membered ring intermediates that decompose into N2
and hydrocarbon specific products. Distinct mechanistic differences are
identified between alkenes and alkynes, arising from the disparity in N C bond
lengths within the intermediates 1.480 A vs. 1.381 A, which governs their
decomposition pathways. The corresponding rate coefficients are determined and
implemented into multiple kinetic models, with autoignition simulations showing
a pronounced promoting effect on model reactivity and improved agreement with
experiments, especially at low temperatures. Flux analysis further reveals that
the new pathways suppress conventional inhibiting channels while enabling
aldehyde and ketone forming pathways that enhance overall reactivity. This work
provides a more complete description of N2O hydrocarbon interactions, advancing
predictive capability for combustion and atmospheric chemistry.

We describe in detail a mathematical framework in which statistical ensembles
of hybrid classical- quantum systems can be properly described. We show how a
maximum entropy principle can be applied to derive the microcanonical ensemble
of hybrid systems. We investigate its properties, and in particular how the
microcanonical ensemble and its marginal classical and quantum ensembles can be
defined for arbitrarily small range of energies for the whole system. We show
how, in this situations, the ensembles are well defined for a continuum of
energy values, unlike the purely quantum microcanonical ensemble, thus proving
that hybrid systems translate properties of classical systems to the quantum
realm. We also analyze the relation with the hybrid canonical ensemble by
considering the microcanonical ensemble of a compound system composed of a
hybrid subsystem weakly coupled to a reservoir and computing the marginal
ensemble of the hybrid subsystem. Lastly, we apply the theory to the statistics
of a toy model, which gives some insight on the different properties presented
along the article.

We investigate the emergence of geometric phases in graphene-based
nanostructures through the lens of the Atiyah-Singer index theorem. By modeling
low-energy quasiparticles in curved graphene geometries as Dirac fermions, we
demonstrate that topological defects arising from the insertion of pentagonal
or heptagonal carbon rings generate effective gauge fields that induce
quantized Berry phases. We derive a compact expression for the geometric phase
in terms of the genus and number of open boundaries of the structure, providing
a topological classification of zero-energy modes. This framework enables a
deeper understanding of quantum holonomies in graphene and their potential
application in holonomic quantum computation. Our approach bridges discrete
lattice models with continuum index theory, yielding insights that are both
physically intuitive and experimentally accessible.

### First principles study on the oxidation resistance of two-dimensional intrinsic and defective GeO2

Although two-dimensional (2D) oxide semiconductors exhibit remarkable
oxidation resistance compared to conventional 2D materials, the microscopic
physical processes that govern this behavior at the atomic scale remains
elusive. Using first-principles calculations, we investigated the defect
formation and oxidation dynamics of the GeO${_2}$ monolayer (ML). The
investigations reveal that the intrinsic GeO${_2}$ ML is resistant to oxidation
due to strong electrostatic repulsion between surface oxygen ions and
approaching O$_2$ molecules, effectively suppressing chemisorption. In
contrast, defective GeO$_2$ ML with surface O vacancies shows vulnerability to
oxidation with the O$_2$ molecule occupying the vacancy through a low-energy
activation energy ($E_a$) of 0.375 eV. Remarkably, the subsequent O$_2$
dissociation into atomic species faces a higher activation barrier ($E_a$ =
1.604 eV), suggesting self-limiting oxidation behavior. Electronic structure
analysis demonstrates that oxidation primarily modifies the valence bands of
defective GeO${_2}$ MLs through oxygen incorporation, while the conduction
bands and electron effective mass recover to pristine-like characteristics. We
further proved that the high O$_2$ pressure hinders the formation of the O
vacancy, while high temperature increases the oxidation rate in GeO$_2$ ML.
These atomic-level insights not only advance our understanding of oxidation
resistance in 2D oxides but also provide guidelines for developing stable
GeO${_2}$-based nanoelectronic devices.

As interest in nanomaterials grows, ab initio simulations play a crucial role
in designing electrochemical catalysts. Electrochemical reactions depend on
electrode potential, highlighting the importance of the grand canonical
representation, especially when integrated with Density Functional Theory. The
Grand Canonical Potential - Kinetics (GCP-K) method is a valuable approach for
determining electrocatalytic reaction mechanisms and kinetics rooted in quantum
mechanics, relying on assumptions of quadratic free energy dependence on charge
and a constant differential capacitance-potential relationship. However, it is
known that differential capacitance is potential-dependent in several practical
electrocatalysts. Here we present $\mu$-GCP-K, a practical approach which makes
no assumptions about the relationships between thermodynamic and
electrochemical properties. We demonstrate the method's efficiency by computing
the surface charge density and differential capacitance of graphene, further
emphasizing the importance of accurately calculating the thermodynamic
stability of reaction intermediates in carbon dioxide electroreduction, while
also showing the role of potential-dependent differential capacitance.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种非线性坐标变换方法，将紧束缚模型中的非线性准确映射到超材料几何结构中，实现了三种不同计算范式的信息处理超材料设计

Designing metamaterials that carry out advanced computations poses a
significant challenge. A powerful design strategy splits the problem into two
steps: First, encoding the desired functionality in a discrete or tight-binding
model, and second, identifying a metamaterial geometry that conforms to the
model. Applying this approach to information-processing tasks requires
accurately mapping nonlinearity -- an essential element for computation -- from
discrete models to geometries. Here we formulate this mapping through a
nonlinear coordinate transformation that accurately connects tight-binding
degrees of freedom to metamaterial excitations in the nonlinear regime. This
transformation allows us to design information-processing metamaterials across
the broad range of computations that can be expressed as tight-binding models,
a capability we showcase with three examples based on three different computing
paradigms: a coherent Ising machine that approximates combinatorial
optimization problems through energy minimization, a mechanical racetrack
memory exemplifying in-memory computing, and a speech classification
metamaterial based on analog neuromorphic computing.

Two-dimensional (2D) Janus materials show great promise as piezoelectric
materials and photocatalysts for water splitting. In this work, we
systematically investigated the piezoelectric and photocatalytic properties of
the hexagonal Janus InXY (X = S, Se, Te; Y = Cl, Br, I) monolayers (MLs) using
first-principles calculations. Except for InSeCl ML, the remaining eight InXY
MLs are stable and exhibit exceptionally high in-plane piezoelectric
coefficients ($|d_{22}| = $6.07--155.27 pm/V), which exceed those of most known
2D materials. InXY MLs possess band edges straddling the water redox potentials
at pH = 0. Their intrinsic vertical polarization induces an intralayer
polarization field $E_{\rm intra}$, leading to low exciton binding energies
(0.44--0.78 eV). Moreover, their strong vertical piezoelectric responses
($|d_{32}|$ = 0.34--0.65 pm/V) suggest that in-plane stress can further enhance
$E_{\rm intra}$ to facilitate the separation of photogenerated carriers.
Additionally, these InXY MLs exhibit high electron mobility (101--899
cm$^2$/V/s) and a pronounced anisotropy ratio in carrier mobility, which
effectively suppresses charge recombination. To optimize performance, we
constructed a van der Waals heterojunction (InSI/InSeBr), which demonstrates
remarkable photocatalytic properties, including enhanced redox ability, a
direct Z-scheme charge transfer pathway, strong visible-light absorption, high
carrier mobility, and excellent photocorrosion resistance. Our results indicate
that hexagonal Janus InXY MLs and their heterojunctions are multifunctional
materials integrating piezoelectricity and photocatalysis, paving the way for
energy conversion applications.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究在弹性超材料中实现了拓扑边界棘轮机制，通过循环加载以量子化方式传输编码在屈曲域中的数字信息，为中性系统中的赛道存储器提供了一般性途径

Multistable order parameters provide a natural means of encoding non-volatile
information in spatial domains, a concept that forms the foundation of magnetic
memory devices. However, this stability inherently conflicts with the need to
move information around the device for processing and readout. While in
magnetic systems, domains can be transported using currents or external fields,
mechanisms to robustly shuttle information-bearing domains across neutral
systems are scarce. Here, we experimentally realize a topological boundary
ratchet in an elastic metamaterial, where digital information is encoded in
buckling domains and transported in a quantized manner via cyclic loading. The
transport is topological in origin: neighboring domains act as different
topological pumps for their Bogoliubov excitations, so their interface hosts
topological boundary modes. Cyclic loading renders these modes unstable through
inter-domain pressure, which in turn drives the motion of the domain wall. We
demonstrate that the direction of information propagation can be controlled
through adjustable mechanical constraints on the buckling beams, and
numerically investigate buckling-based domain-wall logic circuits in an elastic
metamaterial network. The underlying tight-binding structure with low-order
nonlinearities makes this approach a general pathway toward racetrack memories
in neutral systems.

Polar topological textures like the bubble domains, flux--closures, and
labyrinth etc., unlock functional responses in ferroic systems but are
difficult to stabilize and control in chemically simple, solution--grown
materials. Here we show that ultra--thin, large--area CsPbBr$_3$ nanoplatelets
host room--temperature ferroelectric bubble domains whose characteristic size
is tunable by thickness. Using contact--resonance piezoresponse force
microscopy (PFM) across 125\~nm--2\~$\mu$m, we observe a systematic decrease in
domain size with decreasing thickness, consistent with a depolarization--field
controlled stability window. Repeated scanning transforms bubbles into
labyrinthine patterns, indicating metastability under weak
mechanical/electrical perturbations. Upon heating, bubbles evolve into
labyrinths and vanish at $T_C\!\approx\!90^\circ$C, with domain nucleation
recovered on cooling. These results establish a controllable platform for polar
topology in a stable, stochiometric perovskite grown via a solvothermal route,
and clarify how electrical boundary conditions (set by thickness and
temperature) govern texture selection. The thickness--tunable polar textures
identified here offer a route to engineer domain--wall--mediated
functionalities in halide perovskites.

Van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs) composed of transition-metal
dichalcogenides (TMDs) and layered magnetic semiconductors offer great
opportunities to manipulate exciton and valley properties of TMDs. Here, we
present magneto-photoluminescence (PL) studies in a WSe2 monolayer (ML) on a
CrSBr crystal, an anisotropic layered antiferromagnetic semiconductor. Our
results reveal unique behavior of each of the ML-WSe2 PL peaks under magnetic
field that is distinct from the pristine case. An intriguing feature is the
clear enhancement of the PL intensity that we observe each time the external
magnetic field tunes the energy of an exciton in CrSBr into resonance with one
of the optical states of WSe2. This result suggests a magnetic field-controlled
resonant energy transfer (RET) beyond other effects reported in similar
structures. Our work provides deep insight on the importance of different
mechanisms into magnetic vdWHs and underscores its great potential for light
harvesting and emission enhancement of two-dimensional materials.

Additive Manufacturing (AM) processes present challenges in monitoring and
controlling material properties and process parameters, affecting production
quality and defect detection. Machine Learning (ML) techniques offer a
promising solution for addressing these challenges. In this study, we introduce
a comprehensive framework, AM-DefectNet, for benchmarking ML models in melt
pool characterization, a critical aspect of AM. We evaluate 15 ML models across
10 metrics using 1514 training and 505 test datasets. Our benchmarking reveals
that non-linear tree-based algorithms, particularly CatBoost, LGBM, and
XGBoost, outperform other models, achieving accuracies of 92.47%, 91.08%, and
90.89%, respectively. Notably, the Deep Neural Network (DNN) also demonstrates
competitive performance with an accuracy of 88.55%. CatBoost emerges as the
top-performing algorithm, exhibiting superior performance in precision, recall,
F1-score, and overall accuracy for defect classification tasks. Learning curves
provide insights into model performance and data requirements, indicating
potential areas for improvement. Our study highlights the effectiveness of ML
models in melt pool characterization and defect detection, laying the
groundwork for process optimization in AM.

We report on the electronic, magnetic, and magneto-transport properties of
Fe-based kagome Dirac system, RFe$_6$Sn$_6$ (R = Ho, Dy). Magnetic properties
study reveals an antiferromagnetic order with N$\acute{e}$el temperature of
$T_N \approx$ 570 K. Additionally, a weak ferromagnetic order emerge at low
temperatures. Magnetotransport measurements demonstrate an extremely large
magnetoresistance (XMR) reaching as high as $3\times 10^{3} \%$ for
HoFe$_6$Sn$_6$ and $ 1\times 10^{3} \%$ for DyFe$_6$Sn$_6$ when measured at 2 K
with 9 T of magnetic field. The semi-classical two-band model fitting of the
Hall conductivity reveals nearly perfect electron-hole compensation and high
carrier mobility, which leads to XMR behaviour in these system. Further, we
identify large magnetoresistance anisotropy for the magnetic fields applied in
different crystallographic orientations. In addition, considerable modification
in the angle-dependent magnetoresistance (ADMR) pattern has been noticed
between 2 and 50 K, indicating temperature-dependent changes in the Fermi
surface topology of these systems.

### Protocol for Clustering 4DSTEM Data for Phase Differentiation in Glasses

- **TL;DR**: 通过无监督机器学习分析4D-STEM数据，识别了Ge-Sb-Te相变材料中的四种组成和结构异质性集群

Phase-change materials (PCMs) such as Ge-Sb-Te alloys are widely used in
non-volatile memory applications due to their rapid and reversible switching
between amorphous and crystalline states. However, their functional properties
are strongly governed by nanoscale variations in composition and structure,
which are challenging to resolve using conventional techniques. Here, we apply
unsupervised machine learning to 4-dimensional scanning transmission electron
microscopy (4D-STEM) data to identify compositional and structural
heterogeneity in Ge-Sb-Te. After preprocessing and dimensionality reduction
with principal component analysis (PCA), cluster validation was performed with
t-SNE and UMAP, followed by k-means clustering optimized through silhouette
scoring. Four distinct clusters were identified which were mapped back to the
diffraction data. Elemental intensity histograms revealed chemical signatures
change across clusters, oxygen and germanium enrichment in Cluster 1, tellurium
in Cluster 2, antimony in Cluster 3, and germanium again in Cluster 4.
Furthermore, averaged diffraction patterns from these clusters confirmed
structural variations. Together, these findings demonstrate that clustering
analysis can provide a powerful framework for correlating local chemical and
structural features in PCMs, offering deeper insights into their intrinsic
heterogeneity.

- **TL;DR**: 通过相场模型模拟研究了温度和外部压力对固态锂电池锂树晶生长的抑制效果，发现高温高压条件下锂沉积更均匀平坦

Solid-state lithium batteries possess numerous advantages, such as high
energy density, excellent cycle stability, superior mechanical strength,
non-flammability, enhanced safety, and extended service life. These
characteristics make them highly suitable for applications in aerospace, new
energy vehicles, and portable electronic devices. However, the growth of
lithium dendrite at the electrode/electrolyte interface remains a critical
challenge, limiting both performance and safety. The growth of lithium
dendrites in the electrolyte not only reduces the Coulombic efficiency of the
battery but also poses a risk of puncturing the electrolyte, leading to
internal short circuits between the anode and cathode. This study is to solve
the problem of lithium dendrite growth in solid-state lithium batteries by
employing phase-field theory for numerical simulations. A phase-field model is
developed by coupling the mechanical stress field, thermal field, and
electrochemical field, to investigate the morphology and evolution of lithium
dendrites under the condition of different ambient temperatures, external
pressures, and their combined effects. The results indicate that higher
temperature and greater external pressure significantly suppress lithium
dendrite growth, leading to fewer side branches, smoother surfaces, and more
uniform electrochemical deposition. Increased external pressure inhibits
longitudinal dendrite growth, resulting in a compressed morphology with higher
compactness, but at the cost of increased mechanical instability. The combined
effect of temperature and pressure exhibits a pronounced inhibitory influence
on dendrite growth, with stress concentrating at the dendrite roots. This
stress distribution promotes lateral growth, facilitating the formation of
flatter and denser lithium deposits.

Electrical discharge machining (EDM) is a crucial process in precision

electrode contact. In this study, we delve into the realm of Machine Learning
(ML) to enhance the efficiency and precision of EDM, particularly focusing on
Powder-Mixed Electrical Discharge Machining (PMEDM) with the integration of a
vibration system. We comprehensively evaluate four leading ML models - Deep
Neural Network (DNN), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Adaptive Gradient
Boosting (AdaBoost), and ElasticNet, against a pool of ML models, employing
various evaluation metrics including Accuracy, Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root
Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Our evaluations,
conducted on datasets enriched with features derived from powder addition and
electrode vibration, reveal XGBoost superior accuracy, followed by AdaBoost,
DNN, and ElasticNet. Furthermore, through the integration of Multi-Objective
Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) such as NSGA-II, NSGA-III, UNSGA-III, and
C-TAEA, we explore and optimize the Pareto front to attain optimal solutions.
Our findings underscore the transformative potential of ML and optimization
techniques in advancing EDM processes, offering cost-effective, time-efficient,
and reliable solutions for precision manufacturing applications.

### Performance Improvement of Deorbitalized Exchange-Correlation Functionals

- **TL;DR**: 本文提出了一种基于RPP去轨道化器的改进方法，用于r^2SCAN交换相关泛函的去轨道化处理，通过优化密度拉普拉斯项的处理来改善计算效率和精度。

Deorbitalization of a conventional meta-generalized-gradient
exchange-correlation approximation replaces its dependence upon the Kohn-Sham
kinetic energy density with a dependence on the density gradient and Laplacian.
In principle, that simplification should provide improved computational
performance relative to the original meta-GGA form because of the shift from an
orbital-dependent generalized Kohn-Sham potential to a true KS local potential.
Often that prospective gain is lost because of problematic roughness in the
density caused by the density Laplacian and consequent roughness in the
exchange-correlation potential from the resulting higher-order spatial
derivatives of the density in it. We address the problem by constructing a
deorbitalizer based on the RPP deorbitalizer [Phys. Rev. Mater. 6, 083803
(2022)] with comparative smoothness of the potential along with retention of
constraint satisfaction as design goals. Applied to the r^2SCAN
exchange-correlation functional [J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 11, 8208 (2020)], we find
substantial timing improvements for solid-state calculations over both r^2SCAN
and its earlier deorbitalization for high precision calculations of structural
properties, while improving upon the accuracy of RPP deorbitalization for both
solids and molecules.

### Spin-orbit torque control of topology in intrinsic antiferromagnetic insulators

Magnetic topological insulators host exotic phenomena such as the quantum
anomalous Hall effect and quantized magnetoelectric responses, but dynamic
electrical control of their topological phases remains elusive. Here we
demonstrate from first principles that spin-orbit torque enables direct
switching of the topological state in the intrinsic antiferromagnetic bilayer
MnBi$_2$Te$_4$. A symmetry-enforced interband (time-reversal even) torque
persists inside the bulk gap and deterministically reverses the N\'eel order
and layer-resolved Chern number without free carriers. Upon doping, both
interband and intraband torques are amplified, lowering the critical electric
field for switching by two orders of magnitude. Together, these results
establish two complementary regimes of control, dissipationless in-gap torques
without Joule heating and enhanced current-induced torques, providing a robust
route to manipulate local Chern numbers, quasi-helical edge states, and
topological responses in antiferromagnetic topological insulators.

Boltzmann transport calculations based on band structures computed from first
principles play an important role in modern thermoelectric materials research.
Among available codes, the \textsc{BoltzTraP} code is the most widely adopted,
but many recent studies contain systematic mistakes. We identify three error
modes: (1) inserting the electronic thermal conductivity at zero electric
field, $\kappa_0$, in place of the electronic thermal conductivity at zero
electric current, $\kappa_e$, (2) computing the figure of merit $zT$ by
combining a constant relaxation time of unity while keeping the lattice thermal
conductivity $\kappa_\ell$ in standard units, and (3) doing both errors at
once. We have found many examples of the third error, but since the first two
are simpler, we suspect they are also present in the literature. For the single
parabolic band model, we derive exact analytical limits in the non-degenerate
and near-degenerate regimes, and we show how mistakes appear for the realistic
case study of ZrNiSn. Our results illustrate how faulty calculations can appear
reasonable at certain temperatures and Fermi levels, and we provide practical
guidance for identifying faulty results and avoiding such pitfalls in
thermoelectric transport studies.

### Medium-range structural order in amorphous arsenic

Medium-range order (MRO) is a key structural feature of amorphous materials,
but its origin and nature remain elusive. Here, we reveal the MRO in amorphous
arsenic (a-As) using advanced atomistic simulations, based on machine-learned
potentials derived using automated workflows. Our simulations accurately
reproduce the experimental structure factor of a-As, especially the first sharp
diffraction peak (FSDP), which is a signature of MRO. We compare and contrast
the structure of a-As with that of its lighter homologue, red amorphous
phosphorus (a-P), identifying the dihedral-angle distribution as a key factor
differentiating the MRO in both. The pressure-dependent structural behaviors of
a-As and a-P differ as well, which we link to the interplay of ring topology
and structural entropy. We finally show that the origin of the FSDP is closely
correlated with the size and spatial distribution of voids in the amorphous
networks. Our work provides fundamental insights into MRO in an amorphous
elemental system, and more widely it illustrates the usefulness of automation
for machine-learning-driven atomistic simulations.

A cost-effective and robust image-processing pipeline is presented for the
detection and characterization of exfoliated two-dimensional (2D) material
flakes in optical microscope images, designed to facilitate automation in van
der Waals heterostructure assembly. The system combines shallow machine
learning (ML)-based material classification with a precision-first flake
detection algorithm driven by edge morphology and color discontinuity. Step
edges are resolved when supported by optical contrast, while spurious features
such as dust and background texture are reliably rejected. Each identified
flake is exported in a structured format that includes centroid coordinates,
bounding geometries, average RGB color, and estimated optical thickness,
enabling seamless integration into automated pick-up and stacking workflows.
The pipeline is hardware-light and operates without the need for deep learning
models or nanoscale ground-truth labels, making it practical for scalable
front-end wafer processing at a hardware cost of under 30,000 USD. In contrast
to prior approaches that focus solely on detection accuracy, the proposed
system unifies flake segmentation with indexing, filtering, and
blueprint-driven stacking, forming a closed-loop workflow from image
acquisition to device planning. Its low annotation requirement and flexible
implementation enable rapid deployment across diverse 2D material systems and
imaging conditions.

We investigate the electromagnetic responses of a bilayer excitonic
insulators (EI) and identify two types of collective modes:
  (1) Two gapped plasmon modes couple to the layer symmetric gauge field. The
transverse mode is nearly dispersionless in the long-wavelength limit, while
the longitudinal mode, accounting for total charge fluctuations, has a linear
dispersion with velocity proportional to two dimensional (2D) electrical
polarizability.
  (2) A gapless phase (Goldstone) mode and a gapped amplitude mode, associated
with the fluctuations of EI order parameter, couple to the layer antisymmetric
gauge field.
  In the long-wavelength limit, the Goldstone mode exhibits linear dispersion
with velocity inversely proportional to the square root of exciton
compressibility, representing the first sound mode of the exciton condensate
  Significantly, its linear dispersion yields a cubic frequency dependence of
the real admittance in microwave impedance microscopy (MIM), providing a method
to detect the Goldstone mode directly.

- **TL;DR**: 通过调控Gd5Ge4化合物晶胞内的Sn(Ge)3/Sn(Ge)3键合，实现了热滞消除和磁热性能的协同提升，为磁制冷技术提供了新范式。

Magnetic cooling, harnessing the temperature change in matter when exposed to
a magnetic field, presents an energy-efficient and climate-friendly alternative
to traditional vapor-compression refrigeration systems, with a significantly
lower global warming potential. The advancement of this technology would be
accelerated if irreversible losses arising from hysteresis in magnetocaloric
materials were minimized. Despite extensive efforts to manipulate crystal
lattice constants at the unit-cell level, mitigating hysteresis often
compromises cooling performance. Herein, we address this persistent challenge
by forming Sn(Ge)3/Sn(Ge)3 bonds within the unit cell of the Gd5Ge4 compound.
Our approach enables an energetically favorable phase transition, leading to
the elimination of thermal hysteresis. Consequently, we achieve a synergistic
improvement of two key magnetocaloric figures of merit: a larger magnetic
entropy change and a twofold increase in the reversible adiabatic temperature
change (from 3.8 to 8 K) in the Gd5Sn2Ge2 compound. Such synergies can be
extended over a wide temperature range. This study demonstrates a paradigm
shift in mastering hysteresis toward simultaneously achieving exceptional
magnetocaloric metrics and opens up promising avenues for gas liquefaction

Spin wave and magnetic domain wall are two of basic excitations in magnetic
systems, and their spatiotemporal interplay encodes rich information of
underlying magnetic interactions. In synthetic antiferromagnets, the domain
wall acquires an inertia and the spin wave unlocks the full polarization degree
of freedom, lays a salient platform for their interplay. Here we show that both
the translational and angular velocities of domain wall in synthetic
antiferromagnets can be detected via the scattered spin wave, through the
synergy of translational and angular Doppler effects. Following the setup of an
electromagnetic or acoustic radar, the time evolution of a domain wall state
are accessible via a series of spin wave packets, in both non-invasive and
invasive fashion. The inspections in frequency domain, offer new paradigms in
exploration and exploitation of magnetic excitations.

- **TL;DR**: 本研究揭示了宇称禁戒电子跃迁系统中声子边带的宇称依赖性强度分布规律，并通过扩展Huang-Rhys理论成功解释了其物理机制

Mn4+-doped fluoride phosphors represent a significant class of narrow band
red-emitting materials, whose luminescent properties are profoundly influenced
by electron-phonon coupling. However, the parity-forbidden nature of these
electronic transition systems is incompatible with the conventional Condon
approximation, which is widely adopted in the classic theories such as the
Huang-Rhys theory, a framework established on the assumption of parity-allowed
electric dipole transitions. This results in a critical knowledge gap regarding
the principles governing the phonon sidebands of parity-forbidden electronic
transitions. This study experimentally reveals a pronounced parity-dependent
intensity distribution in the phonon sidebands of these systems: significantly
suppressed even-order sidebands and normally observed odd-order sidebands. To
elucidate the phenomenon, we extend the Huang-Rhys theory to parity-forbidden
systems by incorporating the Herzberg-Teller approximation into the treatment
of the transition matrix elements. The improved theory successfully uncovers
the physical mechanism behind the strong suppression of the even-order
sidebands in the parity-forbidden systems, in which the Huang-Rhys factor is
derived as S=((2I_3)/(9I_1 ))^(1/2). This work not only reveals new findings
regarding the phonon sidebands of the parity-forbidden electronic transition
systems, but also establishes an improved theoretical framework for
understanding the electron-phonon coupling mechanisms of color centers in
solids.

### Intrinsic nonlinear valley Nernst effect in the strained bilayer graphene

- **TL;DR**: 本文理论分析了非线性谷能斯特效应作为温度梯度的二阶响应，发现在具有反演和时间反演对称性的材料中可以产生垂直于温度梯度的本征非线性纯谷电流。

We theoretically analyze the nonlinear valley Nernst effect (NVNE) as the
second-order response of temperature gradient through the semiclassical
framework of electron dynamics up to second order. Our study shows that an
intrinsic nonlinear pure valley current can be generated vertically to the
applied temperature in the materials with both inversion and time-reversal
symmetries. This intrinsic NVNE has a quantum origin from the quantum metric
and shows independence from the relaxation time. It's found that the local
largest symmetry near the valleys for the nonvanishing intrinsic NVNE is a
single mirror symmetry in two-dimensional systems. We theoretically investigate
the intrinsic NVNE in the uniaxially strained gapless bilayer graphene and find
the intrinsic NVNE can emerge when applying the temperature gradient vertically
to the direction of strain. Interestingly, a transition from the compressive
strain to the tensile one results in the sign reversal of the intrinsic NVNE.

Indium-Arsenide (InAs) nanowire field-effect transistors (NWFETs) are
promising platforms for high-speed, low power nanoelectronics operating at
cryogenic conditions, relevant for quantum information processing. We present
selective area growth (SAG) of nanowires, which enable scalability and planar
geometries that are compatible with standard semiconductor processing
techniques. NWFETs are fabricated and their low temperature characteristics -
including ION/IOFF ratios, threshold voltages, sub-threshold slope, interfacial
trap density, hysteresis, and mobility - are characterized. The NWFETs operate
successfully in integrated circuitry relying on saturation-mode operation. In
sub-threshold applications such as amplifiers, we find bandwidths exceeding our
cryostat wiring, but the gate hysteresis presents challenges for precise tuning
of the amplifier operating point. We discuss the role of crystal imperfections
and fabrication processes on the transistor characteristics and propose
strategies for further improvements.

Understanding the effects of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) has
become increasingly important in the context of nanoscale magnetism and
spintronics. In this study, we derive a general structure factor equation for
an S = 1/2 dimer and show that the anisotropic ratio $D_z/|J|$ and complex
phase $\phi$ of the DMI control the gap energy and intensity of the
$|0,0\rangle \to |1,0\rangle$ transition. {Using exact diagonalization of the
Heisenberg spin-spin Hamiltonian that incorporates both isotropic and
anisotropic interactions,} as well as the effects of an external magnetic field
and an electric field. Our results show that the DM interaction splits energy
eigenstates, induces level repulsion, and significantly modifies the spin dimer
structure factor. These effects reveal a direct correspondence between
thermodynamic anomalies in the heat capacity and spin-resolved selection rules.

### Conductive domain walls in ferroelectrics as tunable coherent THz radiation source

THz emission associated with currents in conductive domains in BiFeO$_3$
following infrared radiation is theoretically investigated. This experimentally
observed phenomenon is explained by the domain wall stripes acting as metallic
resonators with the oscillating charge accumulation being at the domain wall
edges. The charge oscillation frequency is related to the plasma frequency
inside the domain wall. The value of plasma frequency determines both the
frequency and the amplitude of the emission emanating from the BiFeO$_3$
lattice. We show that for certain geometries of the domain wall structure and
for specific polarization of the incident pulse the THz emission embodies a
non-vanishing chirality.

### Domain Wall Engineering in Graphene-Based Josephson Junctions

Recent progress has enabled the controlled fabrication of domain walls (DWs)
in graphene, which host topological kink states. Meanwhile, reliable techniques
for constructing graphene-based Joseph- son junctions have been established.
While the experimental prerequisites for combining DWs with Josephson junctions
are now available, this direction remains largely unexplored. In this work, we
theoretically investigate transport properties in graphene-based Josephson
junctions mediated by topological kink states and propose three DW engineering
strategies. (i) DW number engineering uncovers a continuous evolution of
critical current interference pattern from Aharonov-Bohm oscil- lation to
Fraunhofer diffraction with increasing DW number, reproducing experimental
observations [Barrier et al., Nature 628, 741 (2024)] and suggesting enhanced
sensitivity for magnetometry ap- plications. (ii) DW symmetry engineering
demonstrates that an asymmetric configuration of DWs under magnetic field
yields an ideal Josephson diode characterized by pronounced nonreciprocal
transport. (iii) DW geometry engineering reveals that intersecting DWs enable
controllable super- current splitting with ratios among leads tunable through
the intersection angle, magnetic field, and superconducting phase difference.
Our findings elucidate the rich physics of DW-based Josephson junctions and
establish a versatile platform for next-generation quantum devices.

### Floquet multiple exceptional points with higher-order skin effect

We investigate the rich non-equilibrium physics arising in periodically
driven open quantum systems, specifically those realized within microcavity
resonators, whose dynamics are governed by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian hosting
Floquet Exceptional Points (FEPs). By introducing a periodically quenched
driving protocol, we analytically derive the Floquet effective Hamiltonian and
determine the locations of multiple FEPs harbored within the Floquet bulk
bands. We demonstrate that the pair-production and annihilation of these FEPs
can be precisely controlled by fine-tuning the system parameters, and zero and
$\pi$ FEPs are topologically characterized by robust integer quantized winding
numbers. To probe these singularities, we introduce a bi-orthogonal Floquet
fidelity susceptibility, whose value exhibits large non-zero peaks at the
momentum points hosting FEPs in the Brillouin zone. Furthermore, the
momentum-summed susceptibility displays a sharp divergence when the number of
FEPs change with respect to the time period of the drive. Our findings also
reveal the emergence of Floquet edge states around zero energy and Dirac-like
dispersion around $\pi$. Moreover, our model reveals a higher-order skin
effect, where the periodically driven Hamiltonian hosts skin modes localized at
both edges and corners. These insights offer novel avenues for the Floquet
engineering of topological singularities in driven dissipative systems, with
significant potential for manipulating light and matter at the microscale.

Over the last decade, researchers have been working to improve a crucial
aspect of quantum computing to predict Hamiltonian energy of solids. Quantum
algorithms such as Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and Variational
Quantum Deflation (VQD) have been used to study the molecular systems. However,
there is growing interest in adapting and applying these methods to periodic
solid-state materials. In this work, we have integrated first-principles
density functional theory with VQE and VQD algorithms and utilizing the Wannier
Tight-Binding Hamiltonian (WTBH) method to predict the electronic
characteristics of solids. We demonstrate that VQE and VQD algorithms can be
used to accurately predict electronic characteristics in a variety of
multi-component prototype solid-state materials such as-Silicon
(semiconductor), Gold (metallic), Boron Nitrile (insulator), Graphene
(semi-metal). Efficient SU2 performs well among all the predefined ansatz used
in the study. COBYLA is the fastest optimizer among the classical optimizers
with minimum number of iterations for convergence. Results of noise models help
to understand the band structure when calculated on real quantum hardware. As
quantum hardware advances, our method stands as a prototype for future quantum
simulations of materials pushing us closer to autonomous quantum discovery
engines.

The valley splitting of 2D electrons in doubly-gated silicon-on-insulator
quantum wells is studied by low temperature transport measurements under
magnetic fields. At the buried thermal-oxide SiO$_{2}$ interface, the valley
splitting increases as a function of the electrostatic bias $\delta n =
n_{B}-n_{F}$ (where $n_{B}$ and $n_{F}$ are electron densities contributed by
back and front gates, respectively) and reaches values as high as $6.3$~meV,
independent of the total carrier concentration of the channel. We show that
$\delta n$ tunes the square of the wave function modulus at the interface and
its penetration into the barrier, both of which are key quantities in a theory
describing interface-induced valley splitting, and is therefore the natural
experimental parameter to manipulate valleys in 2D silicon systems. At the
front interface, made of a thin ``high-k'' dielectric, a smaller valley
splitting is observed, adding further options to tune the valley splitting
within a single device.

- **TL;DR**: 通过无接触波泰光学显微镜观察到BiFeO3单晶中的不对称运输现象，证实了本质的体积光电效应，发现缺陷在非平衡条件下的不对称动量散射是导致长寿命像差的关键因素

The bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE), a manifestation of broken
centrosymmetry, has attracted interest as a probe of the symmetry and quantum
geometry of materials, and for use in novel optoelectronic devices. Despite its
bulk nature, the BPVE is typically measured with interfaces and metal contacts,
raising concerns as to whether the observed signals are genuinely of bulk
origin. Here, we use a contactless pump-probe microscopy method to observe the
space- and time-resolved dynamics of photoexcited carriers in single-crystal,
monodomain $BiFeO_{3}$. We observe asymmetric transport of carriers along the
polar axis, confirming the intrinsic bulk and symmetry-driven nature of BPVE.
This asymmetric transport persists for several nanoseconds after
photoexcitation, which cannot be explained by the shift or phonon ballistic
current BPVE mechanisms. Monte Carlo simulations show that asymmetric momentum
scattering by defects under non-equilibrium conditions explains the long-lived
carrier drift, while first principles calculations confirm that oxygen
vacancies have an asymmetric electronic state that can cause such asymmetric
scattering. Our findings highlight the critical role of defects in long-lived
photoresponses.

X-ray scattering at the carbon absorption edge is uniquely sensitive to local
molecular bond identity and orientation in organic nanostructures, encoded as a
function of photon energy and polarization. However, quantitative analysis is
precluded due to the lack of accurate optical models with bond and orientation
specificity. We generate such a model through an algorithm that parameterizes
and refines density functional theory calculations with angle-resolved
absorbance spectroscopy measurements. The resulting optical tensor is shown to
reproduce data from samples with domains of different orientation and
crystalline packing, enabling label-free orientation analyses of individual
chemical moieties within molecular nanostructures using resonant X-rays.

We present a method for computing the classification groups of topological
insulators and superconductors in the presence of $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\times n}$
point group symmetries, for arbitrary natural numbers $n$. Each symmetry class
is characterized by four possible additional symmetry types for each generator
of $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\times n}$, together with bit values encoding whether pairs
of generators commute or anticommute. We show that the classification is fully
determined by the number of momentum- and real-space variables flipped by each
generator, as well as the number of variables simultaneously flipped by any
pair of generators. As a concrete illustration, we provide the complete
classification table for the case of $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\times 2}$ point group
symmetry.

Two-dimensional (2D) carbon allotropes have received considerable attention
due to their unique properties and potential applications in several fields,
including electronics, catalysis, energy storage, and sensing. Following the
experimental realization of graphene, numerous other 2D carbon structures have
been proposed and, in some cases, successfully synthesized. This work presents
a concise review of the recently experimentally realized 2D carbon allotropes,
including graphynes, biphenylene-based networks, fullerene networks, and
monolayer amorphous carbon. For each class, we discuss structural
characteristics, theoretical predictions, and synthesis methods, with emphasis
on the interplay between theory and experiment. We also highlight instances
where experimental studies overlooked relevant theoretical contributions.
Finally, we identify theoretically predicted structures that remain unexplored
experimentally, suggesting opportunities for synthesis-driven investigations.

We investigate dipolar coupling fields in two square-lattice artificial spin
ice (ASI) systems with different lattice constants using scanning probe
microscopy based on a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond. This
technique offers unprecedented spatial resolution, operates under ambient
condition, and provides quantitative stray field measurements, making it
uniquely suited for studying nanoscale magnetic textures. Our approach combines
fluorescence quenching imaging and continuous-wave optically detected magnetic
resonance (cODMR). A comparison of the two ASI samples, which differ in their
lattice constants of 1000 nm and 910 nm respectively, reveals differences in
the appearance of ice-rule violations - deviations from the lowest energy
configuration in ASI vertices. We attribute these variations to varying
coupling strengths dictated by the lattice constant. From the cODMR data, we
extract both axial and transverse components of the local magnetic field
relative to the NV axis. Micromagnetic modeling of these measurements allows
for an iterative determination of the external magnetic field orientation, the
detection of subtle magnetization tilts induced by weak external fields (well
below the nanomagnets' switching threshold), and an estimation of the effective
saturation magnetization, thereby accounting for deviations in nanomagnet
dimensions. These findings provide crucial insights into the tunable magnetic
interactions in ASI, paving the way for the design of advanced magnonic and
spintronic devices.

We report a high-pressure Raman spectroscopy study of a graphite-water
mixture using water as the pressure-transmitting medium up to 9.9 GPa. In the
graphite-rich region, three characteristic Raman features-the $E_{2g}^{(1)}$
shear mode, the G band ($E_{2g}^{(2)}$), and the 2D band-were observed and
tracked as a function of pressure. The G band exhibits a pronounced blue shift
with increasing pressure, indicating enhanced interlayer coupling between
graphite planes. In the water-rich region, the librational band and three
distinct O-H stretching modes were identified. Notably, above 8 GPa, the slope
of the pressure dependence decreases relative to the earlier report, likely due
to the influence of the water pressure medium, emphasizing the need for further
investigation at higher pressures.

Atomically thin metallic chains serve as pivotal systems for studying quantum
transport, with their conductance strongly linked to the orbital picture. Here,
we report a non-monotonic electro-mechanical response in a gold-ferrocene
junction, characterized by an unexpected conductance increase over a factor of
ten upon stretching. This response is detected in the formation of
ferrocene-assisted atomic gold chain in a mechanically controllable break
junction at a cryogenic temperature. DFT based calculations show that tilting
of molecules inside the chain modifies the orbital overlap and the transmission
spectra, leading to such non-monotonic conductance evolution with stretching.
This behavior, unlike typical flat conductance plateaus observed in metal
atomic chains, pinpoints the unique role of conformational rearrangements
during chain elongation. Our findings provide a deeper understanding of the
role of orbital hybridization in transport properties and offer new
opportunities for designing nanoscale devices with tailored electro-mechanical
characteristics.

The recently proposed term "heterostructured (HS) materials" serves as an
umbrella classification encompassing a wide range of materials that hold great
promise for enhanced mechanical properties. Most HS materials exhibit
back-stress strengthening, as is typical for all plastically non-homogeneous
materials. To better embody the distinctiveness of materials crafted via
innovative heterostructuring, here we introduce the concept of "structural
gradient hardening" (SGH), which captures an essential feature of HS materials
and complements traditional strengthening mechanisms. SGH refers to the extra
strengthening that arises from a characteristic gradient structure introduced
by heterostructuring, beyond what is predicted by the rule of mixtures. This
distinction is useful, as the overall back stress can in fact be partitioned
into Type I and Type II components, with the latter specifically quantifying
the extra hardening originating from the structural and strain gradients
established by heterostructuring, as articulated in this Viewpoint article.

such as the breaking of time reversal symmetry in topological insulators, can
lead to the emergence of band gaps on small energy scales. It is, thus,
important to quantify potential gaps of the Dirac cone with meV precision. Yet
established band structure measurements are often challenged by their strict
surface sensitivity or limited energy resolution. In this work, we use
broadband, time-resolved THz magneto-spectroscopy to access the band structure
of Dirac electrons in a buried HgTe quantum well by contact-free, all-optical
measurements. Optical doping allows us to control the Fermi level without
applying any electrical gate voltages. The background-free measurement of the
cyclotron resonance of the Dirac system over 2.5 optical octaves, a broad range
of magnetic field strengths, and different Fermi energies allows us to
reconstruct the band structure near the Dirac point with sub-meV precision, and
to observe a crossover of Landau quantization from a quasi-classical to the
relativistic regime.

This work reports the fabrication and characterization of high-quality
tungsten-doped vanadium dioxide (WxV1-xO2, x = 0~3 at. %) by thermal oxidation
of sputtered tungsten-vanadium alloyed thin films with different atomic
percentages and high-temperature annealing in an extremely low oxygen
atmosphere (5 to 20 ppm) along with reduction of surface over-oxides in high
vacuum (1 mPa). Oxidation parameters such as temperature, time and nitrogen
purging rate are first optimized for obtaining high quality undoped VO2 thin
film. Insulator-to-metal (IMT) phase transition behavior of VO2 thin films
fabricated in a low-O2 environment is characterized with temperature dependent
spectral infrared transmittance and electrical resistivity measurements, where
there is 15% higher infrared transmittance change and additional 1 order change
in resistivity in comparison with VO2 thin films fabricated in a O2-rich
environment. Grazing angle X-ray diffraction scan confirms no presence of
higher oxides in the VO2 oxidized in low-O2 environment, which improves its
quality significantly. Comprehensive studies on thermal annealing and vacuum
reduction for tungsten doped VO2 thin films are also carried out to find the
optimal fabrication conditions. With the tungsten at. % measured by X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy, the optimal WVO2 thin films fabricated through this
streamlined oxidation, annealing and reduction processes in extremely low-O2
furnace environment exhibit lowered IMT temperature at -23{\deg}C per at.% of
tungsten dopants from 68{\deg}C without doping. This low-cost and scalable
fabrication method could facilitate the wide development of tunable WVO2
coatings in thermal and energy applications.

- **TL;DR**: 磁性双鱼网在域壁中通过边缘缺陷阵列稳定运输，形成集体磁虫状态，速度与电流密度呈线性关系但受缺陷和数量影响

Magnetic bimerons in a domain wall provide a practical route for current
driven transport in patterned magnetic stripes. However, coupling between
bimerons and pinning by defects complicate reliable motion. Here we show that a
periodic array of edge defects both stabilizes transport of multiple bimerons
and gives rise to a distinctive collective state, the magnetic worm. A single
bimeron travels at constant speed; defects lower this speed while preserving an
approximately linear relation between velocity $v$ and current density $J$.
With two bimerons, the center of mass advances nearly uniformly while their
separation exhibits a bounded oscillation whose frequency increases and
amplitude decreases with current. For larger trains, these oscillations lose
synchrony, producing segmented, worm like motion. The center of mass speed
grows with current but decreases as the number of bimerons increases. Notably,
eight bimerons cannot be sustained in a smooth stripe but can be stabilized by
the periodic defects

- **TL;DR**: 通过将Fe原子插入Fe3GaTe2/In2Se3异质结构的载尔空隙层，大大增强了垂直碳异向性，同时实现了通过界面充电重新分布来调节电极化的碳电耦合效应。

Two-dimensional multiferroic van der Waals heterostructures provide a
promising platform for the simultaneous control of distinct ferroic orders,
with potential applications in magnetoelectric devices and spintronics. The
practical implementation of such technologies requires 2D magnets with high
Curie temperatures and strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA). Here,
based on first-principles calculations, we propose a multiferroic
heterostructure composed of the room-temperature ferromagnet
$\text{Fe}_3\text{Ga}\text{Te}_2$ and the ferroelectric
$\text{In}_2\text{Se}_3$. We show that intercalation of Fe atoms into the van
der Waals gap of the $\text{Fe}_3\text{Ga}\text{Te}_2$/$\text{In}_2\text{Se}_3$
heterostructure enhances PMA by nearly an order of magnitude relative to the
pristine $\text{Fe}_3\text{Ga}\text{Te}_2$ monolayer, while simultaneously
allowing electric polarization to be modulated through interfacial charge
redistribution. The enhancement of PMA arises from interfacial hybridization
that modifies the spin-orbit coupling of Fe $d$-orbitals. Our results
demonstrate an effective pathway to engineer magnetoelectric coupling in
two-dimensional multiferroic heterostructures and pave the way toward
energy-efficient spintronic devices.

Thermoelectric materials, long explored for energy harvesting and thermal
sensing, convert heat directly into electrical signals. Extending their
application to the terahertz (THz) frequency range opens opportunities for
low-noise, bias-free THz detection, yet conventional thermoelectrics lack the
sensitivity required for practical devices. Thermoelectric coefficients can be
strongly enhanced near van Hove singularities (VHS), though these are usually
difficult to access in conventional materials. Here we show that moir\'e band
engineering unlocks these singularities for THz optoelectronics. Using 2D
moir\'e structures as a model system, we observe strong enhancement of the THz
photothermoelectric response in monolayer and bilayer graphene superlattices
when the Fermi level is tuned to band singularities. Applying a relatively
small magnetic field further boosts the response through the THz-driven Nernst
effect, a transverse thermoelectric current driven by the THz-induced
temperature gradient. Our results establish moir\'e superlattices as a
versatile platform for THz thermoelectricity and highlight engineered band
structures as a route to high-performance THz optoelectronic devices.

Monolayer Janus transition-metal dichalcogenides possess Ising- and
Rashba-type spin-orbit-couplings (SOC), leading to intriguing spin splitting
effects at K and K$'$, and around $\Gamma$ points across the wide energy range.
Using first-principles calculations, we unveil these SOC characteristics in
metallic Janus NbSSe and demonstrate its potential for optically controlled
spin current eneration. On the basis of the symmetry of the system, we show
that different linear polarized light can selectively drive spin currents of
distinct spin components. Our findings establish NbSSe as a promising candidate
for next-generation optospintronic technologies, which is offering a pathway
toward the development of polarization-tunable spin-current sources.

### Interaction-limited conductivity of twisted bilayer graphene revealed by giant terahertz photoresistance

Identifying the microscopic processes that limit conductivity is essential
for understanding correlated and quantum-critical states in quantum materials.
In twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) and other twist-controlled materials, the
temperature dependence of metallic resistivity follows power-law scaling, with
the exponent spanning a broad range, rendering standard transport measurements
insufficient to unambiguously identify the dominant scattering processes and
giving rise to competing interpretations ranging from phonon-limited transport
and umklapp scattering to strange metallicity and heavy fermion
renormalization. Here, we use terahertz (THz) excitation to selectively raise
the electron temperature in TBG while keeping the lattice cold, enabling a
direct separation of electron-electron and electron-phonon contributions to
resistivity. We observe a giant THz photoresistance, reaching up to 70% in
magic-angle devices, demonstrating that electronic interactions dominate
transport even in regimes previously attributed to phonons, including the
linear-in-temperature resistivity near the magic angle. Away from the magic
angle, we observe coexisting photoresistance and robust
quadratic-in-temperature resistivity at extremely low carrier densities where
standard electron-electron scattering mechanisms (umklapp and Baber inter-band
scattering) are kinematically forbidden. Our analysis identifies the breakdown
of Galilean invariance in the Dirac-type dispersion as a possible origin of the
interaction-limited conductivity, arising from inter-valley electron-electron
collisions. Beyond twisted bilayer graphene, our approach establishes
THz-driven hot-electron transport as a general framework for disentangling
scattering mechanisms in low-density quantum materials.

We present first principles exploration of 529 Fe$_3$XY$_2$ compounds, where
$X$ and $Y$ elements are selected from the $p$-block of the periodic table. Out
of the entire set, 31 compounds satisfy all criteria for energetic, dynamic,
mechanical, and thermal stability. Our analysis reveals several key trends:
halide-containing systems exhibit the highest average magnetic moments and the
highest magnetic transition temperatures, highlighting their potential for
room-temperature spintronic applications. The majority of stable compounds
display perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA), with Fe$_3$SiTe$_2$ exhibiting
the strongest PMA among all candidates. Exchange interactions are found to be
governed by a dual mechanism, direct exchange between nearest-neighbor Fe atoms
and indirect, $p$-orbital-mediated exchange for second-nearest neighbors and
beyond. Notably, four compounds have non-centrosymmetric crystal structures and
exhibit finite spiralization constants. Among them, Fe$_3$AsBr$_2$ is predicted
to host N\'eel-type skyrmions even at zero external magnetic field, as
confirmed by micromagnetic simulations. These findings offer a roadmap for
experimental realization of novel 2D ferromagnets with enhanced
functionalities.

We present a comprehensive computational framework for reproducing the full
X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) through quantum-chemical simulations.
The near-edge region is accurately captured using an efficient implementation
of time-dependent density-functional perturbation theory applied to core
excitations, while ab initio molecular dynamics provides essential sampling of
core-excitation energies and interatomic distance distributions for
interpreting extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) features. Owing
to the efficiency of the approach, the total spectrum can be decomposed into
contributions from bulk, defective, and surface environments, which commonly
coexist in experimental systems. The methodology is demonstrated for sodium at
the Na K-edge in NaCl, where the predicted spectra show good agreement with
experimental measurements on thin film samples. This strategy offers a
practical route to generating chemically specific XAFS cross-section data for
elements and species that remain challenging to characterize experimentally,
thereby enabling deeper insights into materials of technological importance.

- **TL;DR**: 氮掺杂通过快速热退火处理可以稳定Y:HfO₂薄膜中的正交铁电相，消除单斜相，实现明确的铁电性能，为铁电材料研究提供了新途径。

Oxygen vacancies are often essential for stabilizing the orthorhombic
ferroelectric phase in HfO$_2$, with cationic doping widely employed to
introduce such defects. In contrast, systematic studies on anionic doping to
induce ferroelectricity remain largely in nascent stages. On epitaxial
Y:HfO$_2$ grown on ITO buffered YSZ substrates that crystallize in a mixed
monoclinic (non-polar) and orthorhombic (polar) phases, we introduce nitrogen
doping via post deposition rapid thermal annealing (RTA) in N$_2$ atmosphere at
900~$^\circ$C. As the annealing time increases from 10s to 4min, the monoclinic
phase fraction diminishes, enabling the emergence of well-defined ferroelectric
loops in films annealed beyond 2~min. We clearly show that this is an effect of
nitrogen incorporation (doping) into the samples through a suite of
structure-property correlation measurements including x-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy. These results reveal that nitrogen actively participates in the
RTA-induced phase stabilization, enabling ferroelectricity in epitaxial
Y:HfO$_2$ without sacrificing crystallographic coherence, providing a viable
pathway for structure-property correlation studies and a model system to study
opto-electronic devices integrated with ferroelectrics.

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is a key tool for characterising nanoscale
structures, with functionalised tips now offering detailed images of the atomic
structure. In parallel, AFM simulations using the particle probe model provide
a cost-effective approach for rapid AFM image generation. Using
state-of-the-art machine learning models and substantial simulated datasets,
properties such as molecular structure, electrostatic potential, and molecular
graph can be predicted from AFM images. However, transferring model performance
from simulated to experimental AFM images poses challenges due to the subtle
variations in real experimental data compared to the seemingly flawless
simulations. In this study, we explore style translation to augment simulated
images and improve the predictive performance of machine learning models in
surface property analysis. We reduce the style gap between simulated and
experimental AFM images and demonstrate the method's effectiveness in enhancing
structure discovery models through local structural property distribution
comparisons. This research presents a novel approach to improving the
efficiency of machine learning models in the absence of labelled experimental
data.

### Van der Waals Density Functional for Molecular Crystals

Since the development of the nonlocal correlation functional vdW-DF, the
family of van der Waals density functionals has grown to better describe a wide
variety of systems. A recent generation of the vdW-DF family, vdW-DF3, featured
a newly-constructed form of the nonlocal correlation that more accurately
modeled molecular dimers, layered structures, and surface adsorption. However,
it also revealed an intrinsic tradeoff in vdW-DF3's parametrization and
inflexibility of exchange in the generalized gradient approximation (GGA),
limiting its accuracy for molecular crystals. In this paper we propose a new
optimization of vdW-DF3 that is tailored to 3D molecular crystals. This
functional, called vdW-DF3-mc, contains a new, tunable form of the exchange
enhancement factor with parameters that directly correspond to physically
relevant qualities. In addition, within the nonlocal correlation, we prioritize
smoothness of the kernel switching function as a means of restoring flexibility
to vdW-DF3's design. Testing vdW-DF3-mc on several benchmark sets, we achieve
highly accurate energetics and geometries for molecular crystals. This is
particularly evident for the case of polymorphs of ice, for which errors in the
volume and cohesive energy are on the order of only 1%, indicating very
promising performance for important subcategories of molecular crystals, such
as polymorphism and hydrogen-bonded solids.

Silicon carbide is widely used in electronics, ceramics, and renewable energy
due to its exceptional hardness and resistance. In this study, we investigate
the effects of hydrostatic and uniaxial pressure (both compressive and tensile)
on the structural and electronic properties of $3C$-SiC. Our analysis is based
on atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using an efficient
tight-binding Hamiltonian, whose accuracy is validated against density
functional theory calculations. Moreover, to account for nuclear quantum
effects, we employ path-integral MD simulations. Our results show significant
changes in the direct electronic gap as a function of temperature and pressure,
with a renormalization of about 80 meV due to zero-point motion. Under
hydrostatic tensile pressure, the direct band gap $E_{\Gamma}$ vanishes at the
material's mechanical stability limit (spinodal point, where the bulk modulus
$B \to 0$). For uniaxial pressure, we observe instabilities (Young's modulus $Y
\to 0$) at approximately 90 GPa for both tension and compression, where
$E_{\Gamma} \to 0$. Additionally, we analyze the pressure dependence of the
internal energy, lattice parameter, and bond length, along with their
finite-temperature fluctuations, which exhibit anomalies near the instability
points.
