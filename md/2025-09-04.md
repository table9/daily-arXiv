Nanometer-scale surface chemistry limits the performance of SRF cavities and
quantum circuits. We present a first-principles framework coupling DFT of
interfacial energetics with strong-coupling Eliashberg theory for Nb and Ta
bilayers. The approach identifies Au and Au alloys (AuPd, AuPt) as effective
passivation layers. We also we introduce a thin Cu wetting underlayer as a
means to minimize cap thickness while preserving superconductivity. These newly
proposed design rules explain observed behavior in Nb- and Ta-based qubits and
will enable longer coherence times and lower surface resistance.

We report the observation of electric-field-induced superconductivity on the
surface of bulk polycrystalline MoS2 using electric double-layer doping. A gate
voltage applied in an ionic liquid environment systematically increased carrier
density, leading to an insulator-to-metal transition and a sharp resistance
drop at low temperatures, indicating superconductivity. The onset temperature
of superconductivity strongly depended on carrier density inferred from
conductance, showing a significant increase and eventual saturation. Unlike
prior studies limited to single-crystalline MoS2, our results demonstrate that
superconductivity can also be electrostatically induced in polycrystalline
systems, broadening the scope for exploring gate-controlled superconductivity
in a wider range of materials.

- **TL;DR**: 本文研究PT对称非厄米超导体中的一阶相变，发现非厄米耗散与超导配对相互作用的相互作用在PT对称破缺点驱动新颖的一阶相变。

The interplay between superconductivity and environmental dissipation,
effectively captured by non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, is a new frontier for exotic
quantum phases. We explore a PT-symmetric non-Hermitian superconductor with
balanced gain and loss. To ensure experimental relevance, we develop a
right-eigenstate-based non-Hermitian mean-field theory. We uncover a novel
first-order phase transition that coincides exactly with the PT symmetry
breaking point, driven by the interplay between superconducting pairing
interactions and non-Hermitian dissipation. In the PT-symmetric phase, moderate
NH dissipation enhances superconductivity, while in the PT-broken phase,
intensified dissipation significantly suppresses it. These phenomena,
characterized by abrupt jumps in observables, can be probed through localized
spectral measurements and macroscopic superfluid density analysis.
Additionally, the stability analysis offers robust theoretical insights to
support experimental investigations of this unique transition.

- **TL;DR**: 本文对trellis晶格上的量子自旋液体进行了系统分类，发现了7种U(1)和25种Z2短程Ansätze，包括新型半狄拉克自旋液体，并绘制了相图，识别了四种实验候选材料。

Geometrical frustration in quantum magnets provides a fertile setting for
unconventional phases of matter, including quantum spin liquids (QSLs). The
trellis lattice, with its complex site arrangements and edge-sharing triangular
motifs, presents a promising platform for such physics. In this work, we
undertake a comprehensive classification of all fully symmetric QSLs on the
trellis lattice using the projective symmetry group approach within the
Abrikosov fermion representation. We find 7 U(1) and 25 $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$
short-ranged $\textit{Ans\"atze}$, uncovering both gapped and Dirac QSLs as
well as a novel semi-Dirac spin liquid, in which the spinon dispersion is
linear along one momentum direction but quadratic along the orthogonal one. We
demonstrate that such dispersions can occur only at high-symmetry points in the
Brillouin zone with $C_{2v}$ little groups and analyze their characteristic
correlation signatures. Moreover, by optimizing over all mean-field states, we
map out a phase diagram -- featuring six distinct phases -- of the
nearest-neighbor Heisenberg Hamiltonian on the trellis lattice. Going beyond
mean field, we also assess equal-time and dynamical spin structure factors of
these phases using density-matrix renormalization group and Keldysh
pseudofermion functional renormalization group calculations. Finally, we
identify four cuprate and vanadate compounds as promising experimental
realizations and provide spectroscopic predictions, based on first-principles
Hamiltonians, as a guide for future neutron-scattering studies on these
materials.

### Aging of glass-forming materials following a temperature jump

- **Categories**: cond-mat.stat-mech
- **TL;DR**: 研究玻璃形成模型中同时存在陷获效应和自由能景观延迟响应时的老化行为，发现两种效应分别导致不同类型的老化，并可在短时行为中区分

Aging in a glass forming model in which both trapping effect and delayed
response of the free energy landscape (FEL) exist is studied after the
temperature is changed. It is confirmed that the trapping effect gives rise to
Type-I aging where the relaxation time increases with waiting time regardless
of the direction of temperature change, and that the delayed response of the
FEL produces Type-II aging where the waiting-time dependence of the relaxation
time depends on the direction of temperature change. When both effects exist
and the response time of the FEL is appropriate, these effects can be
differentiated in the short-time behavior of the temporal relaxation time. It
is argued that the material time or the internal clock and the fictive
temperature introduced phenomenologically are understood as the concepts
describing the delayed response of the FEL to temperature change.

### Machine learning-accelerated search of superconductors in B-C-N based compounds and R3Ni2O7-type nickelates

- **TL;DR**: 使用机器学习与密度函数理论相结合的方法，系统性地挖掘了B-C-N基高温超导体和R3Ni2O7型双层镇氧化物超导体，发现了12种新的高超导转变温度材料，包括几种TC达到70K的高温超导体。

Superconductor research has traditionally depended on experiments and
theoretical approaches. However, the rapid advancement of data-driven methods
and machine learning (ML) has opened avenues for accelerating superconductor
discovery. Here, we integrated ML with density functional theory (DFT)
calculations to efficiently screen conventional B-C-N based superconductors and
identify potential high-TC candidates among R3Ni2O7-type bilayer nickelates. We
identified 12 new binary and ternary B-C-N based superconductors with TC &gt;= 10
K, including 3 with TC &gt;= 25 K, such as two structural forms of B2CN (TC = 44.8
K and 41.5 K) and TiNbN2 (TC = 26.2 K). These materials share a common feature
of strong {\sigma}-bonds, which is key to achieving relatively high TC.
Moreover, we proposed Tb3Ni2O7 (TC = 61.6 K) and Ac3Ni2O7 (TC = 70.3 K) as
potential high-TC nickelate superconductors under high pressure. Their
electronic structures closely resemble those of La3Ni2O7, especially in the
hole-type band dominated by Ni-3dz2 orbital character. We also analyzed feature
importance in the ML results for both conventional and high-TC superconductors.
These results advance the search for new superconductors and enhance the
fundamental understanding of superconducting mechanisms.

### Doping a spin-one Mott insulator: possible application to bilayer nickelate

- **Categories**: cond-mat.str-el, cond-mat.supr-con
- **TL;DR**: 本文综述了基于自旋-1 Mott绝缘体的高温超导理论进展，重点研究双层镍酸盐超导体La₃Ni₂O₇的Kondo晶格模型，揭示了强层间耦合可诱导高Tc超导和赝能隙金属态

In this article, we review some recent theoretical developments on potential
high-temperature superconductors and unconventional metallic states that can
arise from doping a spin-one Mott insulator in the $d^{8}$ valence. These
studies are particularly relevant-though not limited-to the recently discovered
bilayer nickelate superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. We focus on a ferromagnetic
(FM) Kondo lattice model with mobile electrons in the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital
coupled to the localized spin moments in $d_{z^2}$ orbital through a large
Hund's coupling $J_H$. In the large $J_H$ limit, the model reduces to the type
II t-J model with a mixture of spin-half singlon states and spin-one doublon
states. We summarize DMRG results on the Luther-Emery liquid in one dimensional
chain and two-leg ladder. Then we mainly focus on bilayer square lattice and
show that a large inter-layer coupling $J_\perp$ of $d_{z^2}$ orbital can
induce strong inter-layer pairing of $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital. In the strong
$J_\perp$ limit, a kinetic-energy driven high $T_c$ superconductivity is
demonstrated in an ideal model with only a single hopping term. Furthermore,
the model predicts a symmetric pseudogap metal-dubbed `second Fermi liquid"-in
the underdoped regime, yielding a phase diagram analogous to that of hole-doped
cuprates. The bilayer Kondo model therefore, presents a promising platform for
both realizing higher-Tc superconductors and exploring non-Fermi liquid
physics. We also comment on the possible limitations of the current models for
the bilayer nickelate material and point out some future directions.

### The frustrated Ising model on the honeycomb lattice: Metastability and universality

- **TL;DR**: 该研究通过改进的蒙特卡洛模拟方法，证明了蜂窝晶格上具有竞争相互作用的Ising模型在J2 &gt; -J1/4范围内都经历二阶相变，属于Ising普适类，而非之前认为的一阶相变。

We study the Ising model with competing ferromagnetic nearest- and
antiferromagnetic next-nearest-neighbor interactions of strengths $J_1 &gt; 0$ and
$J_2 &lt; 0$, respectively, on the honeycomb lattice. For $J_2 &gt; - J_1 / 4$ it has
a ferromagnetic ground state, and previous work has shown that at least for
$J_2 \gtrsim -0.2 J_1$ the transition is in the Ising universality class. For
even lower $J_2$ some indicators pointing towards a first-order transition were
reported. By utilizing population annealing Monte Carlo simulations together
with a rejection-free and adaptive update, we can equilibrate systems with
$J_2$ as low as $-0.23 J_1$. By means of a finite-size scaling analysis we show
that the system undergoes a second-order phase transition within the Ising
universality class at least down to $J_2 =-0.23 J_1$ and, most likely, for all
$J_2 &gt; - J_1 / 4$. As we show here, there exist very long-lived metastable
states in this system explaining the first-order like behavior seen in only
partially equilibrated systems.

### Etching-free dual-lift-off for direct patterning of epitaxial oxide thin films

- **TL;DR**: 本文提出了一种双重提前剪刀方法，用于直接形成单晶氧化物蜜片的图案，避免传统的腐刻流程及其问题。

Although monocrystalline oxide films offer broad functional capabilities,
their practical use is hampered by challenges in patterning. Traditional
patterning relies on etching, which can be costly and prone to issues like film
or substrate damage, under-etching, over-etching, and lateral etching. In this
study, we introduce a dual-lift-off method for direct patterning of oxide
films, circumventing the etching process and associated issues. Our method
involves an initial lift-off of amorphous Sr$_3$Al$_2$O$_6$ or
Sr$_4$Al$_2$O$_7$ ($a$SAO) through stripping the photoresist, followed by a
subsequent lift-off of the functional oxide thin films by dissolving the $a$SAO
layer. $a$SAO functions as a ``high-temperature photoresist", making it
compatible with the high-temperature growth of monocrystalline oxides. Using
this method, patterned ferromagnetic La$_{0.67}$Sr$_{0.33}$MnO$_{3}$ and
ferroelectric BiFeO$_3$ were fabricated, accurately mirroring the shape of the
photoresist. Our study presents a straightforward, flexible, precise,
environmentally friendly, and cost-effective method for patterning high-quality
oxide thin films.

### Quantum anomalous Hall effect with high Chern number in two dimensional ferromagnets Ti2TeSO

- **TL;DR**: 提出一种新型二维碳纳纳粒子Ti2TeSO，具有C=2的高碳数和双无散庄缘渠道，能在较高温度下实现谷极化和拓扑状态的共存。

Two-dimensional Chern insulators have emerged as crucial platforms for the
realization of the quantum anomalous Hall effect, and as such have attracted
significant interest in spintronics and topological quantum physics due to
their unique coexistence of spontaneous magnetization and nontrivial
topological characteristics. Nonetheless, substantial challenges persist in
such systems, encompassing spin entanglement and the possession of only one
edge state (Chern number C=1), which significantly hinder their practical
applications. Herein, we propose a novel two-dimensional ferromagnetic
half-semi-Weyl-metal, monolayer Ti2TeSO, that exhibits exceptional electronic
properties. Its majority spin channel possesses only a pair of
symmetry-protected Weyl points at the Fermi level, while the states of minority
one locate far away from the Fermi level. When spin-orbit coupling is included,
a substantial band gap of ~ 92.8 meV is induced at the Weyl points. Remarkably,
the emergence of dual dissipationless chiral edge channels and a quantized Hall
conductivity plateau at 2e2/h collectively establish monolayer Ti2TeSO as a
high-Chern-number insulator with C=2. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that
valley polarization can be achieved and controlled through the application of
strain and the manipulation of the direction of magnetization. The
first-principles calculations, in conjunction with Monte Carlo simulations,
yield a Curie temperature of 161 K for monolayer Ti2TeSO, thereby indicating
the plausibility of coexistence of valley polarization and topological states
at elevated temperatures. These findings could provide a foundation for the
development of multi-channels dissipationless transport devices and nonvolatile
multistate memory architectures.

### BioMD: All-atom Generative Model for Biomolecular Dynamics Simulation

- **Categories**: physics.chem-ph, cs.AI
- **TL;DR**: BioMD是首个全原子生成模型，通过分层预测和插值框架模拟蛋白质-配体长时间尺度动力学，解决了传统分子动力学模拟计算成本高的问题。

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are essential tools in computational
chemistry and drug discovery, offering crucial insights into dynamic molecular
behavior. However, their utility is significantly limited by substantial
computational costs, which severely restrict accessible timescales for many
biologically relevant processes. Despite the encouraging performance of
existing machine learning (ML) methods, they struggle to generate extended
biomolecular system trajectories, primarily due to the lack of MD datasets and
the large computational demands of modeling long historical trajectories. Here,
we introduce BioMD, the first all-atom generative model to simulate
long-timescale protein-ligand dynamics using a hierarchical framework of
forecasting and interpolation. We demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility
of BioMD on the DD-13M (ligand unbinding) and MISATO datasets. For both
datasets, BioMD generates highly realistic conformations, showing high physical
plausibility and low reconstruction errors. Besides, BioMD successfully
generates ligand unbinding paths for 97.1% of the protein-ligand systems within
ten attempts, demonstrating its ability to explore critical unbinding pathways.
Collectively, these results establish BioMD as a tool for simulating complex
biomolecular processes, offering broad applicability for computational
chemistry and drug discovery.

### Inherent momentum-dependent gap structure of altermagnetic superconductors

- **TL;DR**: 该论文研究了反铁磁金属在低温下转变为超导态时的超导能隙结构特征，发现亚晶格结构会强烈影响能隙结构，在动量无关吸引通道下会在布里渊区边界产生能隙节点，而最近邻配对则允许边界配对并倾向于d波能隙结构。

Altermagnetic metals break time-reversal symmetry and feature spin-split
Fermi surfaces generated by compensated N\'eel-ordered collinear magnetic
moments. Being metallic, such altermagnets may undergo a further instability at
low temperatures to a superconducting state, and it is an interesting open
question what are the salient features of such altermagnetic superconductors?
We address this question on the basis of realistic microscopic models that
capture the altermagnetic sublattice degrees of freedom. We find that the
sublattice structure can strongly affect the superconducting gap structure in
altermagnetic superconductors. In particular, it imposes nodes in the gap on
the Brillouin zone edges for superconductors stabilized by momentum-independent
bare attraction channels. We contrast this to the case of nearest-neighbor
pairing where pairing is allowed on the Brillouin zone edges and $d$-wave gap
structures can be favored.

### Robust superconductivity upon doping chiral spin liquid and Chern insulators in a Hubbard-Hofstadter model

- **TL;DR**: 该论文通过数值计算证明了在三角晶格Hubbard-Hofstadter模型中存在稳健的超导性，特别是在每个晶格π/2磁通条件下，为纯排斥性Hubbard模型中的超导现象提供了有力证据。

Demonstrating superconductivity in purely repulsive Hubbard models is a
compelling goal which underscores the counter-intuitive ability of Coulomb
interactions to mediate superconductivity. Here, we present numerical evidence
for robust superconductivity in a triangular Hubbard-Hofstadter model at
$\pi/2$ flux per plaquette. Employing infinite density matrix renormalization
group calculations on infinite cylinders of finite circumference, we observe
superconducting ground states for a wide range of dopings, whose
pair-correlations strengthen as the 2D limit is approached. At a density of one
electron per site, Hubbard interactions have been reported to drive the
insulating parent state of the superconductor from an integer quantum Hall
(IQH) state to a chiral spin liquid (CSL). Our findings give credence to a
recent proposal that proximity to the IQH-CSL transition serves to make chiral
superconductivity energetically favorable on doping, and also correctly
predicts the nature of the edge modes in the superconductor. On the CSL side,
this suggests the superconductor can be thought of as arising from Laughlin's
`anyon superconductivity' mechanism. Thus the Hubbard-Hofstadter model studied
here offers a clean and experimentally accessible setup, potentially realizable
in moir\'e heterostructures, for exploring the properties of anyonic matter at
finite density and the interplay of topological order, quantum criticality and
superconductivity.

### Speeding up Brownian escape via intermediate finite potential barriers

- **TL;DR**: 通过将单势垒重塑为多个较低中间势垒的结构化能量景观，可以显著减少布朗粒子克服势垒的平均首次通过时间，即使总势垒高度保持不变

The mean first-passage time (MFPT) for a Brownian particle to surmount a
potential barrier of height $\Delta U$ is a fundamental quantity governing a
wide array of physical and chemical processes. According to the Arrhenius Law,
the MFPT typically grows exponentially with increasing barrier height,
reflecting the rarity of thermally activated escape events. In this work, we
demonstrate that the MFPT can be significantly reduced by reshaping the
original single-barrier potential into a structured energy landscape comprising
multiple intermediate barriers of lower heights, while keeping the total
barrier height $\Delta U$ unchanged. Furthermore, this counterintuitive result
holds across both linear and nonlinear potential profiles. Our findings suggest
that tailoring the energy landscape -- by introducing well-placed intermediate
barriers -- can serve as an effective control strategy to accelerate thermally
activated transitions. These predictions are amenable to experimental
validation using optical trapping techniques.

As in many other fields, the rapid rise of generative artificial intelligence
is reshaping materials discovery by offering new ways to propose crystal
structures and, in some cases, even predict desired properties. This review
provides a comprehensive survey of recent advancements in generative models
specifically for inorganic crystalline materials. We begin by introducing the
fundamentals of generative modeling and invertible material descriptors. We
then propose a taxonomy based on architecture, representation, conditioning,
and materials domain to categorize the diverse range of current generative AI
models. We discuss data sources and address challenges related to performance
metrics, emphasizing the need for standardized benchmarks. Specific examples
and applications of novel generated structures are presented. Finally, we
examine current limitations and future directions in this rapidly evolving
field, highlighting its potential to accelerate the discovery of new inorganic
materials.

Phosphorene is a two-dimensional (2D) material exhibiting strong in-plane
structural anisotropy. In this work, we investigate the influence of structural
anisotropy on the optics, dynamics, and transport of excitons in phosphorene by
combining microscopic many-body theory with first principles calculations. Our
framework offers a complete and material specific description of the excitonic
properties of phosphorene, including exciton states and exciton-phonon
interactions, which allow us to quantitatively evaluate the optical absorption
spectra, exciton relaxation, and exciton transport, revealing
direction-dependent characteristics. Interestingly, we identify the critical
role of long-range exchange interactions, which significantly enhance the
anisotropy of exciton diffusion, particularly at low temperatures. Our work
provides fundamental insights into exciton dynamics in an intrinsically
anisotropic 2D material, offering guiding principles for the design of
next-generation optoelectronic devices.

### Incorporating Anharmonicity within Density Functional Theory Calculations

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种在DFT计算中结合非谐效应的简单高效方法，使用高斯型轨道作为基组计算非谐哈密顿量，可准确计算非谐校正的振动频率和键长修正

We present a simple and efficient method to incorporate anharmonic effects in
the vibrational frequency of molecules within density functional theory (DFT)
calculations. This approach is closely related to the traditional vibrational
complete interaction (VCI) technique, which uses the harmonic oscillator
wavefunctions as the basis. In our implementation, we employ Gaussian-type
orbitals (GTOs), with polynomial prefactors, as the basis set to evaluate the
anharmonic Hamiltonian. Although these basis functions are non-orthogonal, the
matrix elements such as overlap, kinetic energy terms, and position moments can
be evaluated analytically. The terms in the Hamiltonian due to the anharmonic
potentials are numerically calculated on a Hermite-Quadrature grid. The
potentials can be evaluated using any electronic structure method. This
framework enables us to accurately calculate the anharmonicity-corrected
vibrational frequencies, the fundamental frequencies, and the corrections to
bond lengths in diatomic molecules. This method is also generalized to handle
coupled anharmonic oscillators, which is essential to model more complex
phenomena such as nitrogen tunneling in the umbrella mode of ammonia (NH$_3$)

Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelates have emerged as a crucial platform for
exploring the mechanisms of high-temperature superconductivity. However, the
Fermi surface topology required for superconductivity remains elusive. Here, we
report the thin film growth and ambient-pressure superconductivity of both
hybrid monolayer-bilayer (1212) and pure bilayer (2222) structures, together
with the absence of superconductivity in hybrid monolayer-trilayer (1313)
structure, under identical compressive epitaxial strain. The onset
superconducting transition temperature is up to 50 K, exceeding the McMillan
limit, in the 1212 structure. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy reveals
key Fermi surface differences in these atomically-engineered structures. In
superconducting 1212 and 2222 films, a dispersive hole-like band (i.e. the
{\gamma} band) crosses the Fermi level, surrounding the Brillouin zone corner.
In contrast, the top of the {\gamma} flat band is observed ~70 meV below the
Fermi level in the non-superconducting 1313 films. Our findings expand the
family of ambient-pressure nickelate superconductors and establish a connection
between structural configuration, electronic structure, and the emergence of
superconductivity in nickelates.

### Competing Dirac masses in one dimension: Symmetry-enhanced pseudo-first-order transition and deconfined criticality

- **TL;DR**: 这篇论文发现了一种对称增强的伪一级相变，作为解限临界性的概念对应物。通过模型研究电子-声子耦合系统的相变行为，显示了从中间相到解限临界点的调控过程。

Emergent symmetries and slow crossover phenomena are central themes in
quantum criticality and manifest themselves in the pseudocritical scaling
experienced in the context of deconfined criticality. Here we discover its
conceptual counterpart, i.e., a symmetry-enhanced pseudo-first-order
transition. It emerges from a one-dimensional realization of deconfined
criticality between charge- and bond-ordered states driven by competing
Holstein and Su-Schrieffer-Heeger electron-phonon couplings, for which quantum
fluctuations and thereby the nature of the transition can be tuned
systematically via the phonon frequency $\omega_0$. In the classical limit
$\omega_0 \to 0$, a low-energy Dirac theory predicts a direct first-order
transition with emergent U(1) symmetry. Using exact quantum Monte Carlo
simulations, we provide strong evidence for symmetry enhancement and even
finite-size scaling on intermediate length scales but in the thermodynamic
limit it turns into a narrow intermediate phase where both order parameters are
finite, as chiral U(1) symmetry is weakly broken on the lattice. Including
quantum lattice fluctuations diminishes the width of the intermediate phase,
gradually restores the U(1) symmetry, and eventually tunes the system to a
deconfined quantum critical point.

Heusler compounds have emerged as important thermoelectric materials due to
their combination of promising electronic transport properties, mechanical
robustness and chemical stability -- key aspects for practical device
integration. While a wide range of XYZ-type half-Heusler compounds have been
studied for high-temperature applications, X$_2$YZ-type full-Heuslers, often
characterized by narrower band gaps, may offer potential advantages at
different temperature regimes but remain less explored. In this work, we report
the discovery of $p$-type Ru$_2$Ti$_{1-x}$Hf$_x$Si full-Heusler
thermoelectrics, exhibiting a high figure of merit $zT \sim 0.7$ over a broad
range of temperatures $700-1000$ K. These results not only represent the
largest values known to date among full-Heusler materials but confirm earlier
theoretical predictions that $p$-type Ru$_2$TiSi systems would be superior to
their $n$-type counterparts. Moreover, using a two-band model, we unveil
electronic structure changes induced by the Hf substitution at the Ti site and
outline strategies to further improve $zT$ up to $zT &gt; 1$. Our findings
highlight the untapped potential of new semiconducting full-Heusler phases and
the crucial need for continued exploration of this rich materials class for
thermoelectric applications.

### Quantum Transport in Ultrahigh-Conductivity Carbon Nanotube Fibers

- **TL;DR**: 研究解液旋线制造的对齐碳纳米管纤中的量子运输，发现低温下弱定基效应和跨维度量子干溉特征，建立了3D+1D混合模型来描述纤绳的层级结构运输机制

We investigate quantum transport in aligned carbon nanotube (CNT) fibers
fabricated via solution spinning, focusing on the roles of structural
dimensionality and quantum interference effects. The fibers exhibit metallic
behavior at high temperatures, with conductivity increasing monotonically as
the temperature decreases from room temperature to approximately 36 K. Below
this temperature, the conductivity gradually decreases with further cooling,
signaling the onset of quantum conductance corrections associated with
localization effects. Magnetoconductance measurements in both parallel and
perpendicular magnetic fields exhibit pronounced positive corrections at low
temperatures, consistent with weak localization (WL). To determine the
effective dimensionality of electron transport, we analyzed the data using WL
models in 1D, 2D, and 3D geometries. We found that while the 2D model can
reproduce the field dependence, it lacks physical meaning in the context of our
fiber architecture and requires an unphysical scaling factor to match the
experimental magnitude. By contrast, we developed a hybrid 3D+1D WL framework
that quantitatively captures both the field and temperature dependences using
realistic coherence lengths and a temperature-dependent crossover parameter.
Although this combined model also employs a scaling factor for magnitude
correction, it yields a satisfactory fit, reflecting the hierarchical structure
of CNT fibers in which transport occurs through quasi-1D bundles embedded in a
3D network. Our results establish a physically grounded model of phase-coherent
transport in macroscopic CNT assemblies, providing insights into enhancing
conductivity for flexible, lightweight power transmission applications.

- **TL;DR**: 本文探讨了超越GW近似的parquet形式理论，该理论平等处理所有双体散射通道，为分子系统提供了更精确的准粒子性质预测方法。

The $GW$ approximation has become a method of choice for predicting
quasiparticle properties in solids and large molecular systems, owing to its
favorable accuracy-cost balance. However, its accuracy is the result of a
fortuitous cancellation of vertex corrections in the polarizability and
self-energy. Hence, when attempting to go beyond $GW$ through inclusion of
vertex corrections, the accuracy can deteriorate if this delicate balance is
disrupted. In this work, we explore an alternative route that theoretically
goes beyond $GW$: the parquet formalism. Unlike approaches that focus on a
single correlation channel, such as the electron-hole channel in $GW$ or the
particle-particle channel in $T$-matrix theory, parquet theory treats all
two-body scattering channels on an equal footing. We present the formal
structure of the parquet equations, which couple the one-body Green's function,
the self-energy, and the two-body vertex. We discuss the approximations
necessary to solve this set of equations, the advantages and limitations of
this approach, outline its implementation for molecular systems, and assess its
accuracy for principal ionization potentials of small molecular systems.

Moir\'e materials provide exciting platforms for studying the interplay of
strong electronic correlation and large magnetic flux effects. We study the
lightly doped Hofstadter-Hubbard model on a triangular lattice through
large-scale density matrix renormalization group and determinantal quantum
Monte Carlo simulations. We find strong evidence for a robust chiral
superconducting (SC) phase with dominant power-law pairing correlations and a
quantized spin Chern number. The SC phase emerges at very weak interaction and
grows stronger at intermediate interaction strengths (U ) for a wide range of
hole doping. We also discuss the possible distinct nature of the normal state
in different U regimes. Our work provides theoretical insights into the
emergence of topological superconductivity from doping topological Chern bands
or magnetic flux induced chiral spin liquid states of Moir\'e materials.

### Decomposition of low-angle grain boundaries

Grain boundaries (GBs) merge and grains disappear during microstructure
evolution. However, the Peach-Koehler model predicts that particular stress
states may reverse such a process by exerting differential Peach-Koehler forces
on different dislocations. This work considers this reversal as GB
decomposition and illustrates it in a low-angle asymmetric tilt GB and a
low-angle mixed tilt-twist GB via atomistic simulation. In both cases, the
dislocations separate into two GBs separated by a new grain. This work
describes the requirements for decomposition and the importance of dislocation
separability. Additionally, we examine the dislocation behaviors and stress
signatures associated with this process, along with the impact of strain rate
and temperature on those aspects.

The growing interest in topological materials with symmetry-protected surface
states as catalytic platforms has sparked the emerging field of
\textit{topocatalysis}. As robust transport is one of the key features of
topological insulators, here we explore current-induced molecular dissociation
in a transport setup. Using the non-equilibrium Green's function formalism, we
compare how the occupancies of bonding and antibonding levels, as well as the
associated electronic forces in a diatomic molecule, are affected when the
molecule is coupled to either a metallic (graphene) or a topological
(Kane-Mele) substrate. We find a greater dissociative capability in the
topological substrate than in graphene, a difference mainly attributed to the
localized nature of the edge states. The inclusion of vacancy disorder within
the substrate further enhances this disparity in the dissociative force. Our
findings highlight the role of topological protection in molecular dissociation
under non-equilibrium conditions, pointing to new opportunities for robust
catalysis in topological materials.

Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) represents an emerging paradigm that
integrates various forms of physical knowledge into machine learning (ML)
components, thereby enhancing the physical consistency of ML models compared to
purely data-driven paradigms. The field of combustion, characterized by a rich
foundation of physical laws and abundant data, is undergoing a transformation
due to PIML. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of PIML for
combustion, systematically outlining fundamental principles, significant
contributions, key advancements, and available resources. The application of
PIML in combustion is categorized into three domains: combustion chemical
kinetics, combustion reacting flows, and other combustion-related problems.
Additionally, current challenges, potential solutions, and practical guidelines
for researchers and engineers will be discussed. A primary focus of this review
is to demonstrate how combustion laws can be integrated into ML, either through
soft or hard constraints, via loss functions or representation models, and
within coordinate-to-variable or field-to-field paradigms. This paper shows
that PIML offers a unified framework linking physics, model, and data in
combustion--integrating physical knowledge in model-to-data simulation and
reconstruction tasks, as well as data-to-model modeling tasks--resulting in
enhanced data, improved physical models, and more reliable ML models. PIML for
combustion presents significant opportunities for both the combustion and ML
communities, encouraging greater collaboration and cross-disciplinary
engagement.

- **TL;DR**: 通过数值重正规组方法分析Ho^{3+}离子的7轨道李德森模型，发现三通道康奎相在(V_8, V_7)平面上占据较广区域，并与非费米涵两通道康奎相相邻

By employing a numerical renormalization group method, we analyze a
seven-orbital impurity Anderson model for Ho$^{3+}$ ion with ten $4f$
electrons. This model includes both $V_7$ and $V_8$, which are hybridizations
between localized $4f$- and conduction electrons in $\Gamma_7$ and $\Gamma_8$
orbitals, respectively. For the case of $V_7=V_8$ with the local $\Gamma_5$
triplet ground state, we have reported the discovery of a three-channel Kondo
(TCK) phase, characterized by a residual entropy of $\log \phi$ with the golden
ratio $\phi=(1+\sqrt{5})/2$. In this research, by depicting the ground-state
phase diagram on the $(V_8, V_7)$ plane, we attempt to unveil the effect of
$V_7$ and $V_8$ on the emergence of the TCK phase. After performing a lot of
numerical calculations, we find that the TCK phase appears in a relatively wide
region on the $(V_8, V_7)$ plane. The boundary curves surrounding the TCK phase
are determined by the variation of the temperature dependence in entropy and
the abrupt change in energy spectra. We consider that most of the phases
surrounding the TCK phase are Fermi liquids, but the non-Fermi liquid
two-channel Kondo phase is unexpectedly found to exist next to the TCK phase.
Finally, we briefly comment on the actual material concerning the detection of
the TCK phase.

The future of space exploration and human settlement beyond Earth hinges on a
deeper understanding of in space manufacturing processes. The unique physical
conditions and scarcity of experimental data demand robust computational models
to investigate the atomic scale physics of solidification. This work presents a
molecular dynamics (MD) model to examine the solidification behavior of the Al
Cu binary alloy, focusing on the influence of varying compositions and gravity
levels (Earth, Lunar, Martian, and microgravity) on atomistic solidification
mechanisms and the resulting mechanical properties specifically, hardness of as
solidified nanostructures. Hardness is evaluated via nanoindentation
simulations. The study confirms that gravitational forces significantly affect
the solidification pathways of Al Cu alloys. Notably, by tuning alloy
composition, the influence of gravity can be modulated and in some cases, even
reversed. Moreover, hardness exhibits a coupled dependence on both composition
and gravity, offering a promising avenue for bottom-up design of components
tailored for extraterrestrial environments. The article delves into the
nanoscale physical mechanisms underlying these phenomena and outlines future
directions for extending this modeling framework to broader applications.

Electron spin qubits in quantum dot devices are promising for scalable
quantum computing. However, architectural support is currently hindered by the
lack of realistic and performant simulation methods for real devices.
Physics-based tools are accurate yet too slow for simulating device behavior in
real-time, while qualitative models miss layout and wafer heterostructure. We
propose a new simulation approach capable of simulating real devices from the
cold-start with real-time performance. Leveraging a key phenomenon observed in
physics-based simulation, we train a compact convolutional neural network (CNN)
to infer the qubit-layer electrostatic potential from gate voltages. Our
GPU-accelerated inference delivers &gt;1000x speedup with &gt;96% agreement to the
physics-based simulation. Integrated into the experiment control stack, the
simulator returns results with millisecond scale latency, reproduces key tuning
features, and yields device behaviors and metrics consistent with measurements
on devices operated at 9 mK.

Ferroelectric anomalous photovoltaic (APV) effect, as a fascinating physical
conceptual phenomenon, holds significant potentials for new optoelectronic
device applications. However, due to the knowledge lacking on the origin and
underlying mechanism of ferroelectric APV effect, substantial challenges still
remain in exploring new APV-active candidate materials. The emerging shift
current model, involving the transfer of photogenerated charges through the
displacement of wave functions, has attracted considerable attention for its
unique insights into the bulk photovoltaic effect. Here, we present strong APV
properties in a high-temperature double perovskite ferroelectric
(cyclohexylmethylammonium)$_2$CsAgBiBr$_7$, showing an extremely large
above-bandgap photovoltage up to about 40 V. This figure-of-merit is far beyond
its bandgap of about 2.3 eV and comparable to the state-of-art molecular
ferroelectrics. Strikingly, the shift current model reveals an intrinsic
correlation with Cs$^{+}$ cation displacement and provides, for the first time,
an explicit explanation for the structural origin of ferroelectric APV
activities. Besides, its steady-state APV photocurrent exhibits the unique
light-polarization dependence, which endows remarkable polarization-sensitivity
with the highest polarization ratios of about 41 among the known 2D
single-phase materials. As the unprecedented exploration of ferroelectric APV
characteristics illuminated by the shift current mechanism, this finding paves
a pathway to assemble new optoelectronic smart devices.

A site-selective $^{27}$Al nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) study is carried
out on the Kondo lattice compound CePtAl$_4$Ge$_2$, which crystallizes in a
rhombohedral lattice with quasi-two-dimensional Ce layers forming a triangular
lattice network. Two inequivalent Al sites, Al(1) and Al(2), are unambiguously
assigned by comparing measured nuclear quadrupole parameters with electric
field gradients obtained from electronic structure calculations. Knight shift
analysis yields distinct hyperfine coupling constants, revealing that they
arise predominantly from RKKY-type transferred hyperfine fields through
conduction electrons. Spin-lattice relaxation measurements reveal pronounced
anisotropic spin fluctuations, and comparison of the relaxation rates between
the two Al sites clarifies the momentum-space structure of these fluctuations.
At low magnetic fields, $(T_1T)^{-1}$ is strongly enhanced on cooling toward
the N\'eel temperature, indicating the growth of in-plane antiferromagnetic
correlations in the paramagnetic state.

Transition metal dichalcogenide homobilayers unite two frontiers of quantum
materials research: sliding ferroelectricity, arising from rhombohedral (R)
stacking, and moir\'e quantum matter, emerging from small-angle twisting. The
spontaneous polarization of ferroelectric R-stacked homobilayers produces a
highly tunable band structure, which, together with strain-induced
piezoelectricity, governs the topology and correlated electronic phases of
twisted bilayers. Here we present a systematic low-temperature optical
spectroscopy study of R-stacked bilayer WSe$_2$ to quantitatively establish its
fundamental electronic and ferroelectric properties. Exciton and
exciton-polaron spectroscopy under doping reveals a pronounced electron-hole
asymmetry that confirms type-II band alignment, with the conduction and valence
band edges located at the $\Lambda$ and K valleys, respectively. Through
distinct excitonic responses and tunable interlayer-intralayer exciton
hybridization under displacement fields, we uncover the coexistence of AB and
BA ferroelectric domains. Using exciton-polarons as a probe, we directly
measure the intrinsic polarization field and extract the interlayer potential.
Finally, we demonstrate electric-field-driven symmetric switching of the
valence band maximum, attributed to ferroelectric domain switching. These
results provide a complete experimental picture of the band alignment,
spontaneous polarization field, and domain dynamics of R-stacked WSe$_2$,
establishing key parameters to understand twisted bilayers and enabling new
ferroelectric and excitonic device opportunities.

High-quality-factor ($Q$) mechanical resonators are essential components for
precise sensing and control of mechanical motion at a quantum level. While
amorphous materials such as SiN have been widely used in high-$Q$ mechanical
resonators utilizing stress-induced dissipation dilution, crystalline materials
have emerging potential to achieve higher quality factors by combining low
intrinsic loss and high tensile stress. In this paper, we demonstrate high-Q
membrane resonators using ultra-high-stress crystalline TiN. Our membrane
resonator exhibits a tensile stress exceeding 2.3 GPa and a quality factor of
$Q = 8.0 \times 10^6$ at 2.2 K. By estimating the dilution factor, we infer
that our TiN resonator has a intrinsic quality factor comparable to that of SiN
membrane resonators. With its ultra-high stress and crystalline properties, our
TiN films can serve as a powerful tool for opto- and electromechanical systems,
offering highly dissipation-diluted mechanical resonators.

intersite exchange interactions within the ground-state doublet manifold using
an ab initio Hubbard-I based approach for a representative set of Ce and Yb
triangular-lattice compounds. These include the putative quantum spin liquids
(QSL) RbCeO$_2$ and YbZn$_2$GaO$_5$ and the antiferromagnets KCeO$_2$ and
KCeS$_2$. The calculated nearest-neighbor (NN) couplings are antiferromagnetic
and exhibit noticeable anisotropy. The next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) couplings
are ferromagnetic in the Ce systems and dominated by classical dipole-dipole
interactions in the Yb case. Solving the resulting effective spin-1/2 models by
exact diagonalization up to $N=36$ sites, we predict ordered magnetic ground
states for all systems, including the two QSL candidates. We explore the phase
space of an anisotropic NN + isotropic NNN triangular-lattice model finding
that a significant antiferromagnetic NNN coupling is required to stabilize QSL
phases, while the NN exchange anisotropy is detrimental to them. Our findings
highlight a possibly important role of deviations from the perfect triangular
model - like atomic disorder - in real triangular-lattice materials.

Deconfined quantum critical points (DQCPs) represent an unconventional class
of quantum criticality beyond the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson-Fisher paradigm.
Nevertheless, both their theoretical identification and experimental
realization remain challenging. Here we report compelling evidence of a DQCP in
quantum Hall bilayers with half-filled $n=2$ Landau levels in each layer, based
on large-scale variational uniform matrix product state (VUMPS) simulations and
exact diagonalization (ED). By systematically analyzing the ground-state
fidelity, low-lying energy spectra, exciton superfluid and stripe order
parameters, and ground-state energy derivatives, we identify a direct and
continuous quantum phase transition between two distinct symmetry-breaking
phases by tuning the layer separation: an exciton superfluid phase with
spontaneous $U(1)$ symmetry breaking at small separation, and a unidirectional
charge density wave with broken translational symmetry at large separation. Our
results highlight quantum Hall bilayers as an ideal platform for realizing and
experimentally probing DQCPs under precisely tunable interactions.

Unconventional superconductors exhibit multiple broken symmetries and exceed
the range of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory. For instance,
time-reversal symmetry can be broken in addition to the gauge symmetry,
resulting in superconductors that can be enhanced or induced by a magnetic
field. However, such unconventional superconductivities are more vulnerable to
impurities than their BCS counterparts, requiring highly ordered and clean
material systems to observe them. Crystalline rhombohedral multilayer graphene
is a promising platform to explore unconventional superconductivity due to its
superior material quality and gate-tunable strong correlation effects. Here we
report transport measurements of rhombohedral tetralayer and pentalayer
graphene, where a spectrum of superconductivities in a clean limit are
observed. Three of them (SC2-4) show highly unusual enhancements by magnetic
fields: 1. SC2 is strengthened by an in-plane field; 2. SC3 is boosted by a
small out-of-plane field; 3. SC4 is induced by an in-plane field. All these
superconductors are robust against an in-plane field up to 8.5 Tesla, exceeding
the Pauli limit of conventional superconductors by tens of times and suggesting
their unconventional nature. Moreover, we observed that proximitized spin-orbit
coupling generates a plethora of new superconductors in the phase diagram,
while maintaining the high quality of bare rhombohedral graphene. Our work
establishes a family of new superconductors in rhombohedral multilayer
graphene, which also provides an ideal platform to engineer non-Abelian
quasiparticles by proximitizing with quantum anomalous Hall states existing in
the same material system.

### Role of Fe intercalation on the electronic correlation in resistively switchable antiferromagnet Fe$_{x}$NbS$_2$

Among the family of intercalated transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs),
Fe$_{x}$NbS$_2$ is found to possess unique current-induced resistive switching
behaviors, tunable antiferromagnetic states, and a commensurate charge order,
all of which are tied to a critical Fe doping of $x_c$ = 1/3. However, the
electronic origin of such extreme stoichiometry sensitivities remains unclear.
Combining angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) with density
functional theory (DFT) calculations, we identify and characterize a dramatic
eV-scale electronic restructuring that occurs across the $x_c$. Moment-carrying
Fe 3$d_{z^2}$ electrons manifest as narrow bands within 200 meV to the Fermi
level, distinct from other transition metal intercalated TMD magnets. This
state strongly interacts with the itinerant electron in TMD layer, and rapidly
loses coherence above $x_c$. These observations resemble the exceptional
electronic and magnetic sensitivity of strongly correlated systems upon charge
doping, shedding light on the important role of electronic correlation in
magnetic TMDs.

Colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) is a fascinating quantum phenomenon that
continues to draw significant interest in condensed matter physics. Mn3Si2Te6
has emerged as a prototypical CMR material, notable for its puzzling
magnetoresistance behavior and pronounced directional anisotropy. Despite
extensive research, the mechanisms driving CMR in Mn3Si2Te6 remain elusive
[1-4]. In this work, we explore the magnetic resonance of Mn3Si2Te6 and observe
a reduced g-factor for magnetic fields applied along the crystalline c-axis
compared to the ab-plane, indicating a substantial orbital magnetization
contribution along the c-axis. Furthermore, we detect resistance modulation
under resonance conditions, suggesting that CMR in Mn3Si2Te6 is sensitive to
the out-of-the plane spin polarization. These findings shed new light on the
role of orbital magnetic moment in Mn3Si2Te6, offering a deeper understanding
of the interplay between spin, orbital and lattice degrees of freedom of
electrons in this system.

We study the effects of magnetic anisotropy and crystalline axes in surface
acoustic waves (SAWs) driven magnetic resonances of Ni/LiNbO3 hybrid devices.
SAW absorption from the interaction with magnons in Ni displays a strong
anisotropic dependence on the direction of the applied in-plane magnetic field.
Magnetic anisotropy is further investigated by magneto-optical Kerr effect
measurements to show both uniaxial and biaxial anisotropy components in Ni
films on LiNbO3. By introducing a dipolar interaction term in addition to the
anisotropies, we successfully explain the anisotropic SAW absorption in our
devices. These findings show the importance of substrate-induced anisotropy and
long-range dipolar effects in SAW-magnons hybrid devices and indicate future
directions for optimizing these spin-acoustic devices through comprehensive
anisotropy engineering.

### Signatures of emergent surface states across a displacive topological phase transition in Bi$_4$I$_4$

- **TL;DR**: Bi4I4材料在室温下经历拓扑相变，从高温β相的表面态转变为低温α相的铰链态，通过实验观测到由一阶热力学结构变化介导的位移型拓扑相变特征

Topological phase transitions involving crystalline symmetry breaking provide
a fertile ground to explore the interplay between symmetry, topology, and
emergent quantum phenomena. Recently discovered quasi-one-dimensional
topological material, Bi$_4$I$_4$, has been predicted to host topologically
non-trivial gapless surfaces at high temperature, which undergo a finite
temperature phase transition to a low temperature gapped phase. Here we present
experimental signatures of this room temperature phase transition from a
high-temperature $\beta$-phase with a surface state to a gapped $\alpha$-phase
hosting hinge states. Using real-space current mapping and resistance
fluctuation spectroscopy, we identify signatures of a displacive topological
phase transition mediated by a first-order thermodynamic structural change.
Near the emergence of $\beta$-phase, we observe pronounced telegraphic noise,
indicating fluctuating phase domains with topological surface states. The
spatially resolved current map reveals electron transport via the gapless
surface states in the $\beta$-phase, which vanishes upon transitioning to the
$\alpha$-phase with localized conduction channels (or hinge modes). Our
experimental results, supported by first principles estimates and effective
theory of a topological displacive phase transition, establish Bi$_4$I$_4$ as a
candidate material showing intricate interplay of classical thermodynamic phase
transitions with topological quantum phenomena.

- **TL;DR**: 本文展示了基于二氧化钒（VO2）的可调谐超薄膜，通过低氧炉氧化在不同基底材料上制备，实现白天自适应太阳能加热和夜间辐射冷却的双功能性能。

In this work, tunable vanadium dioxide (VO2) metafilms on different substrate
materials fabricated via low-oxygen furnace oxidation are demonstrated for
self-adaptive daytime solar heating and nighttime radiative cooling. Because of
its thermally-driven insulator-to-metal phase transition behavior, the VO2
metafilms work as spectrally-selective solar absorber with a high solar
absorptance of 0.86 and a low infrared emissivity of ~0.2 at daytime, while
they behave as selective cooler at nighttime to dissipate heat effectively
through the atmospheric transparency window with a high emissivity of ~0.76 to
cold outer space. From the outdoor vacuum tests, a significant temperature rise
up to 169 K upon solar heating and a temperature drop of 17 K at night are
experimentally observed from these tunable VO2 metafilms. With the atmosphere
temperature fitted in-situ, the accurate heat transfer model shows excellent
agreement with the stagnation temperature measurement, and indicates a high
heating power of ~400 W/m2 at 80{\deg}C sample temperature in the middle of the
day, and a cooling power of ~60 W/m2 at 30{\deg}C in equilibrium with ambient
at night. This work would facilitate the development of self-adaptive coatings
with cost-effective and scalable fabrication approaches for all-day energy
harvesting.

In relation to recent experimental data [1], we develop a theory framework
for demonstrating the feasibility of detecting sharp Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
(NMR) oscillations in a real time ESR data. The procedure is to follow real
time oscillations of the ESR signal measured at a selected frequency of a
hyperfine transition. We study a variety of systems such as a single radical
molecule with one or two hyperfine coupled nuclei or two molecules that coexist
as either radicals or non-radicals, facilitated by charge transfer. We develop
a master equation for describing these scenarios and find parameters for which
a sharp NMR line can be observed. We show that in all cases an off-diagonal
term in the hyperfine tensor is essential for the observation.

### Dissipationless dynamics of spin supersolid states in a spin-1/2 triangular antiferromagnet with impurities

- **TL;DR**: 研究三角晶格自旋超固态在杂质存在下的动力学性质，发现Goldstone模式和自旋超流性在杂质影响下保持稳健，而传统磁态出现磁子能带分裂

Motivated by recent experimental observations of possible spin supersolid
states in triangular lattice compounds, we study the dynamical properties of
various ground states in the spin-1/2 easy-axis antiferromagnetic Heisenberg
model with impurities under magnetic fields, using numerical Density Matrix
Renormalization Group methods. For both spin supersolid states in the low and
high fields, the gapless Goldstone mode at the $K$ points remains robust with
impurities, which is related to the presence of spin superfluidity. As a
comparison, we find a splitting of magnon band at the same impurity density
level in the conventional magnetic state, the so-called up-up-down state. In
addition, the finite superfluid stiffness probed by the twisted phase in the
spin supersolid states is consistent with the excitation spectrum. We argue
that this excitation spectrum with impurity provides direct evidence of the
dissipationless dynamics in the spin supersolid states, which could be tested
in neutron scattering experiments.

We present a comprehensive density functional theory (DFT) study of Mo-doped
silver clusters Ag$_n$Mo ($n=1$-14), focusing on their structural, electronic,
and bonding properties. Global optimization reveals an evolution from planar
and low-symmetry isomers in small clusters to compact three-dimensional
geometries with higher symmetry, culminating in a highly stable icosahedral
structure at $n=12$. Binding energy and second-order energy difference analyses
identify $n=12$ as a "magic number" cluster exhibiting enhanced thermodynamic
stability and a pronounced HOMO-LUMO gap, indicative of electronic shell
closure. Bond length analysis shows relatively constant Ag-Mo distances
alongside a size-dependent increase in Ag-Ag bond lengths, reflecting the
growth of metallic bonding networks. Hirshfeld charge analysis reveals
significant charge transfer from Ag to Mo in small clusters, which decreases
with size as the system transitions toward delocalized metallic bonding. These
findings provide detailed insights into the size-dependent interplay of
geometry, bonding, and electronic structure in Ag$_n$Mo clusters, with
implications for their catalytic and material applications.

Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) based on ferromagnets are canonical devices
in spintronics, with wide-ranging applications in data storage, computing, and
sensing. They simultaneously exhibit mechanisms for electrical detection of
magnetic order through the tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) effect, and
reciprocally, for controlling magnetic order by electric currents through
spin-transfer torque (STT). It was long assumed that neither of these effects
could be sizeable in tunnel junctions made from antiferromagnetic materials,
since they exhibit no net magnetization. Recently, however, it was shown that
all-antiferromagnetic tunnel junctions (AFMTJs) based on chiral
antiferromagnets do exhibit TMR due to their non-relativistic
momentum-dependent spin polarization and cluster magnetic octupole moment,
which are manifestations of their spin-split band structure. However, the
reciprocal effect, i.e., the antiferromagnetic counterpart of STT driven by
currents through the AFMTJ, has been assumed non-existent due to the total
electric current being spin-neutral. Here, in contrast to this common
expectation, we report nanoscale AFMTJs exhibiting this reciprocal effect,
which we term octupole-driven spin-transfer torque (OTT). We demonstrate
current-induced OTT switching of PtMn3|MgO|PtMn3 AFMTJs, fabricated on a
thermally oxidized silicon substrate, exhibiting a record-high TMR value of
363% at room temperature and switching current densities of the order of 10
MA/cm2. Our theoretical modeling explains the origin of OTT in terms of the
imbalance between intra- and inter-sublattice spin currents across the AFMTJ,
and equivalently, in terms of the non-zero net cluster octupole polarization of
each PtMn3 layer. This work establishes a new materials platform for
antiferromagnetic spintronics and provides a pathway towards deeply scaled
magnetic memory and room-temperature terahertz technologies.

- **TL;DR**: 研究噪声对二维周期驱动拓扑相的影响，发现边界模式呈现两阶段衰减：短时间指数衰减和长时间代数衰减，显示出意外的稳健性。

We study the effect of noise on two-dimensional periodically driven
topological phases, focusing on two examples: the anomalous Floquet-Anderson
phase and the disordered Floquet-Chern phase. Both phases show an unexpected
robustness against timing noise. The noise-induced decay of initially populated
topological edge modes occurs in two stages: At short times, thermalization
among edge modes leads to exponential decay. This is followed by slow algebraic
decay $\sim n^{-1/2}$ with the number of Floquet cycles $n$. The exponent of
$1/2$ is characteristic for one-dimensional diffusion, here occurring along the
direction perpendicular to the edge. In contrast, localized modes in the bulk
exhibit faster decay, $\sim n^{-1}$, corresponding to two-dimensional
diffusion. We demonstrate these behaviors through full-scale numerical
simulations and support our conclusions using analytical results based upon a
phenomenological model. Our findings indicate that two-dimensional Floquet
topological phases are ideal candidates for potential applications of Floquet
topology, given the unavoidable presence of both quenched disorder and
decoherence in experiments.

While the spin ice state of bulk pyrochlores such as $\rm{Dy_2Ti_2O_7}$ and
$\rm{Ho_2Ti_2O_7}$ has been extensively studied in the last several decades due
to its unique degenerate ground state and emergent monopole excitation, whether
it survives in the thin-film form remains a mystery. The limited volume of
thin-film sample makes it challenging to study the intrinsic magnetic
properties. Here, we synthesized 18nm-thick $\rm{Dy_2Ti_2O_7}$ thin film on YSZ
substrate and capped it by a thin conductive $\rm{Bi_2Ir_2O_7}$ layer, and
performed the proximitized magnetoresistance measurements. Our study found that
the ice-rule-breaking phase transition survives but with a modified effective
nearest-neighbor interaction and distorted Ising spin axes compared to the bulk
crystal. The results are supported by the simultaneously measured capacitive
torque magnetometry. Our study demonstrates that proximitized transport is an
effective tool for thin films of insulating frustrated magnets.

Insulating altermagnets like MnTe exhibit spin configurations where opposing
spins are not only aligned antiparallel but also rotated relative to each
other. This is an arrangement reminiscent of antiferromagnetism with a twist of
spin canting. This study investigates a model Hamiltonian that captures the
essential physics of such systems, incorporating key interactions including
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya and conventional exchange terms, relativistic spin-orbit
coupling, and d-wave and g-wave orderings. Non-Hermitian dynamics are
introduced through complex potentials that simulate energy dissipation and
amplification. The paper delves into the behavior of the quantum geometric
tensor and the emergence of the quantum anomalous Hall effect within the
topologically insulating regime. It also broadens the scope to encompass
non-Hermitian metallic altermagnets, focusing on phases characterized by
symmetry-breaking d-wave and g-wave order parameters.

Silica fume is a valuable by-product from the silicon and ferrosilicon
production. It is therefore important to understand the impact on the silica
fume quality when converting the furnace feed from fossil-based to renewable
reduction materials. Using self-consistent numerical simulations of the
nucleation and condensation process, we present a detailed study of the silica
fume formation process.
  It is found that the most critical physical effect that determines the final
particle size distribution is coalescence due to Brownian motion. Furthermore,
it is crucial to use appropriate thermophysical parameters in order to
reproduce reliable particle size distributions. Contrary to what has been done
in previous studies on the same topic, this is now done by using reasonable
expressions for surface energy, saturation pressure and the nucleation
pre-exponential factor.
  It is also found that under conditions relevant to furnaces, the liberation
of latent heat leads to an explosive chain reaction of particle nucleation and
condensation when the first particles nucleate and start growing due to
condensation. This process continues until the relative saturation pressure of
silicon dioxide is reduced to unity.
  Finally, it is found that the Lagrangian approach for particle tracking is
more flexible and accurate, and also more CPU efficient, than the Eulerian

Interfacial thermal transport is a critical bottleneck in nanoscale systems,
where heat dissipation and energy efficiency are strongly modulated by
molecular ordering at solid-liquid boundaries. Here, using atomistic
simulations of hexadecane confined by structured silica substrates, we reveal
how interfacial geometry, specifically curvature, governs the density
distribution and thermal transport across the interface. At flat and mildly
curved surfaces, the liquid exhibits surface-templated layering, promoting
efficient heat transfer, which is enhanced with increasing contact surface
area. As curvature increases, this ordering breaks down, giving rise to
interference-like density patterns, reduced molecular packing, and localized
depletion zones. This structural reorganization leads to a systematic increase
in interfacial thermal resistance (ITR), even when the contact area is kept
constant. By decomposing the interface into convex ("hill" of solid) and
concave ("valley" of solid) regions, we find that valleys consistently offer
lower thermal resistance. In contrast, hills act as bottlenecks to heat flow.
Remarkably, we show that the work of adhesion and entropy-related energy losses
scale non-trivially with curvature: while adhesion increases with contact area,
the entropic penalty dominates the total energy change, reflecting
curvature-induced frustration of molecular alignment. These findings unveil a
direct link between surface geometry, thermodynamic dissipation, and heat
transport, offering new design principles for thermally tunable nanostructured
materials, thermal interface coatings, and phase-change systems.

The growth of thin films and nanostructures is a fundamental process for
constructing both model-type systems and nanoscale devices, where performance
and functionalities can be controlled by the choice of parameters. For magnetic
systems the crystal structure, material composition, size, and shape determine
already most of the magnetism-related properties. Here, we investigate the
reciprocal route, which is controlling nanostructure growth via magnetism. To
this end we deposit Co on a uniaxial antiferromagnetic surface above and below
its N\'eel temperature. Growth above the N\'eel temperature results in the
formation of roughly hexagonal islands, reflecting the surface symmetry. For
growth below the N\'eel temperature we find quasi-one-dimensional Co
nanostructures along distinct crystallographic directions, which signal the
local antiferromagnetic domain orientation. Our findings demonstrate the
feasibility of controlling growth via magnetism and the necessity to take
magnetism-related effects into account for growth on magnetic surfaces.

We study two-dimensional Dirac fermions in a one-dimensional mass
superlattice under a perpendicular magnetic field. Using exact solutions for
isolated and finite arrays of domain walls, we demonstrate the persistence of
Jackiw-Rebbi modes with a field-dependent renormalized velocity. For the
periodic case, we adopt a gauge-invariant projection method onto magnetic Bloch
states, valid for arbitrary fields and mass profiles, which yields dispersive
Landau levels, and confirm its accuracy by comparison with finite arrays
spectra. From the miniband spectra we predict modified quantum Hall plateaus
and Weiss-like magnetoconductivity oscillations, characterized by a strongly
reduced amplitude and a $\pi/2$ phase shift compared to electrostatic
superlattices.

### Integral $ab$ $initio$/DFT and experimental TDPAC approach enlightening the $aftereffects$ phenomenon: probing electronic properties in $α$-Al$_2$O$_3$:$^{111}$In($\rightarrow$ $^{111}$Cd) at the atomic scale

By means of an integral experimental and $ab$ $initio$/DFT approach we
contribute here to enlighten and quantify the origin of dynamic hyperfine
interactions (HFIs) assigned to the electron-capture (EC) decay aftereffects
(ECAE) phenomenon observed in time-differential perturbed $\gamma$-$\gamma$
angular correlation (TDPAC) experiments in oxides doped with ($^{111}$In
(EC)$\rightarrow$)$^{111}$Cd as probe-atom. In previous works [Darriba et al.,
Phys. Rev. B 105, 195201 (2022)] we proposed an $ab$ $initio$ scenario in which
the fluctuating electric-field gradients (EFG) producing the dynamic HFI were
related with fluctuating electronic environments close to the $^{111}$Cd
nucleus, succeeding to identify the environment which produce the final static
EFG when the dynamic ($on-off$) process have stopped. In this work we show that
in addition it is possible to obtain, for each temperature and HFI observed,
the set of initial electronic configurations close to the probe nucleus as well
as their related EFGs among which the system fluctuates to generate these
dynamic HFIs. For this, we demonstrate analytically and checked experimentally
the conditions to stablish the equivalence between the two approaches most used
to analyze this type of dynamic HFIs, proposed by B\"averstam et al. and by
Lupascu et al.. To unravel the unexpected TDPAC results in
$^{111}$In($\rightarrow$ $^{111}$Cd)-implanted $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$ single
crystals reported in the literature, we perform a complete $ab$ $initio$/DFT
study of Cd-doped $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$ semiconductor and a detailed defect
formation energy analysis as a function of the charge state of the Cd impurity.
The presence of an unexpected second interaction was a key factor to provide
experimental support to identify and quantify the different charge states the
$^{111}$Cd atom goes through during its electronic recovery process.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文提出了一种在硅中确定性制造锑离子供体杂质的方法，检测效率达94%，适用于构建量子计算所需的耦合qudit系统

A reliable route to the deterministic fabrication of impurity ion donors in
silicon is required to advance quantum computing architectures based upon such
systems. This paper reports the ability to dope isotopically-defined unique
(${}^{121}\mathrm{Sb}{}^{123}\mathrm{Sb}$) clusters into silicon with measured
detection efficiencies of 94% being obtained. Atomically resolved imaging of
the doped clusters reveals a Sb-to-Sb separation of ~2 nm post-implantation,
thus indicating suitability to form coupled qudit systems. The method used is
fully compatible with integration into processing that includes pre-enrichment
of the silicon host to &lt; 3ppm ${}^{29}\mathrm{Si}$ levels. As such, we present
a potential pathway to the creation of scaled qudit arrays within silicon
platforms for quantum computing.

A Moire superlattice on the topological insulator surface is predicted to
exhibit many novel properties but has not been experimentally realized. Here,
we developed a two-step growth method to successfully fabricate a topological
insulator Sb2Te3 thin film with a Moire superlattice, which is generated by a
twist of the topmost layer via molecular beam epitaxy. The established Moire
topological surface state is characterized by scanning tunneling microscopy and
spectroscopy. By application of a magnetic field, new features in Landau levels
arise on the Moire region compared to the pristine surface of Sb2Te3, which
makes the system a promising platform for pursuing next-generation electronics.
Notably, the growth method, which circumvents contamination and the induced
interface defects in the manual fabrication method, can be widely applied to
other van der Waals materials for fabricating Moire superlattices.

- **TL;DR**: 这篇论文系统性评测了六种万能机器学习潜力在声子性质预测中的表现，发现EquiformerV2模型在力常数和热导率预测中表现最优

The rapid development of universal machine learning potentials (uMLPs) has
enabled efficient, accurate predictions of diverse material properties across
broad chemical spaces. While their capability for modeling phonon properties is
emerging, systematic benchmarking across chemically diverse systems remains
limited. We evaluate six recent uMLPs (EquiformerV2, MatterSim, MACE, and
CHGNet) on 2,429 crystalline materials from the Open Quantum Materials
Database. Models were used to compute atomic forces in displaced supercells,
derive interatomic force constants (IFCs), and predict phonon properties
including lattice thermal conductivity (LTC), compared with density functional
theory (DFT) and experimental data. The EquiformerV2 pretrained model trained
on the OMat24 dataset exhibits strong performance in predicting atomic forces
and third-order IFC, while its fine-tuned counterpart consistently outperforms
other models in predicting second-order IFC, LTC, and other phonon properties.
Although MACE and CHGNet demonstrated comparable force prediction accuracy to
EquiformerV2, notable discrepancies in IFC fitting led to poor LTC predictions.
Conversely, MatterSim, despite lower force accuracy, achieved intermediate IFC
predictions, suggesting error cancellation and complex relationships between
force accuracy and phonon predictions. This benchmark guides the evaluation and
selection of uMLPs for high-throughput screening of materials with targeted
thermal transport properties.

- **TL;DR**: WS₂/ReSe₂异质双层结构中的层间相互作用导致二次谐波产生(SHG)的各向异性增强，可通过范德华堆叠调控非线性光学响应的强度和偏振依赖性

Van der Waals stacking presents new opportunities for nonlinear optics with
its remarkable tunability and scalability. However, the fundamental role of
interlayer interactions in modifying the overall nonlinear optical
susceptibilities remains elusive. In this letter, we report an anisotropic
enhancement of second-harmonic generation (SHG) from a WS$_2$/ReSe$_2$
heterobilayer, where the individual composite layers possess distinctive
crystal phases. We investigate polarization-resolved response and twist-angle
dependence in SHG and reveal that band alignment alone is insufficient to
explain the observed anisotropy in the modified SHG response. Spectral shifts
in excitonic features highlight band renormalization, supporting the role of
hybridization between the two layers. Furthermore, SHG enhancement is highly
anisotropic and can even be suppressed in some orientations, suggesting
possible intensity-borrowing mechanisms within the heterostructure. Our work
demonstrates the ability to tune both the intensity and polarization dependence
of nonlinear optical responses with van der Waals stacking of distinctive
crystal phases.
