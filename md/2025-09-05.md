Neural networks have promise as surrogate partial differential equation (PDE)
solvers, but it remains a challenge to use these concepts to solve problems
with high accuracy and scalability. In this work, we show that neural network
surrogates can combine with iterative algorithms to accurately solve PDE
problems featuring different scales, resolutions, and boundary conditions. We
develop a subdomain neural operator model that supports arbitrary Robin-type
boundary condition inputs, and we show that it can be utilized as a flexible
preconditioner to iteratively solve subdomain problems with bounded accuracy.
We further show that our subdomain models can facilitate the construction of
global coarse spaces to enable accelerated, large scale PDE problem solving
based on iterative multilevel domain decomposition. With two-dimensional
Maxwell's equations as a model system, we train a single network to simulate
large scale problems with different sizes, resolutions, wavelengths, and
dielectric media distribution. We further demonstrate the utility of our
platform in performing the accurate inverse design of multi-wavelength
nanophotonic devices. Our work presents a promising path to building accurate
and scalable multi-physics surrogate solvers for large practical problems.

- **Title (EN)**: A Highly Scalable TDMA for GPUs and Its Application to Flow Solver Optimization

- **Categories**: physics.comp-ph
- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种用于多GPU系统的线程三对角矩阵算法(Pipelined-TDMA)，通过水线化技术隐藏通信延迟，解决了传统分治算法的可扩展性瓶颈。在64个A100 GPU上实现了理想的弱扩展和74.7%的强扩展效率，并在流体水动力学模拟中实现了1.31倍的整体加速效果。

A tridiagonal matrix algorithm (TDMA), Pipelined-TDMA, is developed for
multi-GPU systems to resolve the scalability bottlenecks caused by the
sequential structure of conventional divide-and-conquer TDMA. The proposed
method pipelines multiple tridiagonal systems, overlapping communication with
computation and executing GPU kernels concurrently to hide non-scalable stages
behind scalable compute stages. To maximize performance, the batch size is
optimized to strike a balance between GPU occupancy and pipeline efficiency:
larger batches improve throughput for solving tridiagonal systems, while
excessively large batches reduce pipeline utilization. Performance evaluations
on up to 64 NVIDIA A100 GPUs using a one-dimensional (1D) slab-type domain
decomposition confirm that, except for the terminal phase of the pipeline, the
proposed method successfully hides most of the non-scalable execution
time-specifically inter-GPU communication and low-occupancy computation. The
solver achieves ideal weak scaling up to 64 GPUs with one billion grid cells
per GPU and reaches 74.7 percent of ideal performance in strong scaling tests
for a 4-billion-cell problem, relative to a 4-GPU baseline. The optimized TDMA
is integrated into an ADI-based fractional-step method to remove the
scalability bottleneck in the Poisson solver of the flow solver (Ha et al.,
2021). In a 9-billion-cell simulation on 64 GPUs, the TDMA component in the
Poisson solver is accelerated by 4.37x, contributing to a 1.31x overall speedup
of the complete flow solver.

- **TL;DR**: 这篇综述论文全面介绍了机器学习技术如何重塑增强采样分子动力学模拟领域，特别关注数据驱动的集体变量构建、改进的偏置方案以及强化学习和生成方法的新策略。

Molecular dynamics simulations hold great promise for providing insight into
the microscopic behavior of complex molecular systems. However, their
effectiveness is often constrained by long timescales associated with rare
events. Enhanced sampling methods have been developed to address these
challenges, and recent years have seen a growing integration with machine
learning techniques. This review provides a comprehensive overview of how they
are reshaping the field, with a particular focus on the data-driven
construction of collective variables. Furthermore, these techniques have also
improved biasing schemes and unlocked novel strategies via reinforcement
learning and generative approaches. In addition to methodological advances, we
highlight applications spanning different areas such as biomolecular processes,
ligand binding, catalytic reactions, and phase transitions. We conclude by
outlining future directions aimed at enabling more automated strategies for
rare-event sampling.

### An exact multiple-time-step variational formulation for the committor and the transition rate

- **TL;DR**: 本文提出了一个新的转移率表达式，能够在任意滞后时间下被精确的承诺概率最小化，解决了现有方法只在单时间步滞后时无偏的问题。

For a transition between two stable states, the committor is the probability
that the dynamics leads to one stable state before the other. It can be
estimated from trajectory data by minimizing an expression for the transition
rate that depends on a lag time. We show that an existing such expression is
minimized by the exact committor only when the lag time is a single time step,
resulting in a biased estimate in practical applications. We introduce an
alternative expression that is minimized by the exact committor at any lag
time. Numerical tests on benchmark systems demonstrate that our committor and
resulting transition rate estimates are much less sensitive to the choice of
lag time. We derive an additional expression for the transition rate, relate
the transition rate expression to a variational approach for kinetic statistics
based on the mean-squared residual, and discuss further numerical
considerations with the aid of a decomposition of the error into dynamic modes.

### Combining feature-based approaches with graph neural networks and symbolic regression for synergistic performance and interpretability

- **TL;DR**: MatterVial是一个创新的混合框架，通过整合多种预训练图神经网络模型的潜在表示来扩展特征空间，将传统特征模型的化学透明度与深度学习的预测能力相结合，在多个材料科学任务中显著提升性能并超越最先进的端到端GNN模型。

This study introduces MatterVial, an innovative hybrid framework for
feature-based machine learning in materials science. MatterVial expands the
feature space by integrating latent representations from a diverse suite of
pretrained graph neural network (GNN) models including: structure-based
(MEGNet), composition-based (ROOST), and equivariant (ORB) graph networks, with
computationally efficient, GNN-approximated descriptors and novel features from
symbolic regression. Our approach combines the chemical transparency of
traditional feature-based models with the predictive power of deep learning
architectures. When augmenting the feature-based model MODNet on Matbench
tasks, this method yields significant error reductions and elevates its
performance to be competitive with, and in several cases superior to,
state-of-the-art end-to-end GNNs, with accuracy increases exceeding 40% for
multiple tasks. An integrated interpretability module, employing surrogate
models and symbolic regression, decodes the latent GNN-derived descriptors into
explicit, physically meaningful formulas. This unified framework advances
materials informatics by providing a high-performance, transparent tool that
aligns with the principles of explainable AI, paving the way for more targeted
and autonomous materials discovery.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了qUCCSD[T]方法，这是一种基于相对论性二次酉耦合簇单双激发方法的微扰三重激发校正方法，通过X2CAMF哈密顿量包含相对论效应，使用FNS和CD近似降低计算成本。

We present a perturbative triples correction to the relativistic quadratic
unitary coupled cluster singles and doubles (qUCCSD) method, denoted as
qUCCSD[T]. The method builds upon the Hermitian structure of the unitary ansatz
and employs a many-body perturbation theory framework to consistently include
the effects of triple excitations without the need for computationally
intensive iterative procedures. Relativistic effects are incorporated using the
exact two-component atomic mean-field (X2CAMF) Hamiltonian, and the
computational cost is further reduced through the frozen natural spinor (FNS)
and Cholesky decomposition (CD) approximations. Benchmark results demonstrate
that qUCCSD[T] outperforms previously proposed triples corrections to the
unitary coupled cluster method in the clasical computing regime and yields
excellent agreement with experimental data and Full CI benchmarks.
Specifically, the method shows high accuracy in computing bond dissociation
enthalpies, molecular geometries, vibrational frequencies, ionization
potentials, and electron affinities of heavy-element-containing systems.

Recent advances on neural quantum states have shown that correlations between
quantum particles can be efficiently captured by {\it attention} -- a
foundation of modern neural architectures that enables neural networks to learn
the relation between objects. In this work, we show that a general-purpose
self-attention Fermi neural network is able to find chiral $p_x \pm i p_y$
superconductivity in an attractive Fermi gas by energy minimization, {\it
without prior knowledge or bias towards pairing}. The superconducting state is
identified from the optimized wavefunction by measuring various physical
observables: the pair binding energy, the total angular momentum of the ground
state, and off-diagonal long-range order in the two-body reduced density
matrix. Our work paves the way for AI-driven discovery of unconventional and
topological superconductivity in strongly correlated quantum materials.

### Escape over a saddle by coloured noise: theory and numerics

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种计算随机动力系统罕见转移事件的方法——分割法，用于近似最可能路径、转移率和概率，适用于无界时间、有色和退化强迫的实际情况

Stochastic dynamical systems allow modelling of transitions induced by
disturbances, in particular from an attracting equilibrium and crossing the
stable manifold of a saddle. In the small-noise limit, the probability of such
transitions is governed by a large deviation principle. We illustrate a
computational approach-the Method of Division-for approximating rare transition
events, including their most likely paths, transition rates, and associated
probabilities. To cater for realistic applications, we allow unbounded time,
coloured and degenerate forcing. Its effectiveness is demonstrated on two
examples: an inverted double-well potential and a simplified roll-heave ship
capsize model.

- **TL;DR**: 本文首次研究二维系统中的拓扑阻挫，发现拓扑阻挫能移动量子临界点位置，并通过纠缠结构分析揭示基态中存在三个离域准粒子激发。

Topological frustration arises when boundary conditions impose geometric
frustration in a quantum system, creating delocalized defects in the ground
states and profoundly altering the low-energy properties. While previous
studies have been concerned with one-dimensional systems, showing that the
ground state structure can be described in terms of quasiparticle excitations,
the two-dimensional setting remains unexplored. We address this gap by studying
a three-legged antiferromagnetic quantum Ising ladder on a torus using tensor
network methods, where topological frustration is induced by an odd number of
spins along both spatial directions. Our results reveal the first instance in
which topological frustration shifts the position of the quantum critical
point. By studying the entanglement structure, we find that the ground state
can be characterized as hosting three delocalized quasiparticles. This work
builds the quasiparticle picture of topological frustration toward higher
dimensions and more complex systems than those considered so far.

### From Qubits to Qumodes: Information Capacity of Anyonic Excitations

- **TL;DR**: 该论文推导了受Haldane排斥统计约束的量子态的最大信息容量，发现容量公式S_max(g)=log2(⌊1/g⌋+1)在费米子极限(g=1)和玻色子极限(g→0)之间连续插值，并预测ν=1/3分数量子霍尔态(g=1/3)具有2比特容量，可通过量子点光谱中的四个量子化电导平台观测

The interplay between quantum statistics and information encoding is a
cornerstone of quantum physics. Here, the maximum information capacity of a
quantum state governed by Haldane's exclusion statistics is derived. The
capacity, defined by the maximum von Neumann entropy of its occupancy
distribution, follows S_max(g) = log2(\lfloor 1/g \rfloor + 1). This result
continuously interpolates between the fermionic limit of a single qubit (g = 1)
and the bosonic limit of a continuous-variable qumode (g -&gt; 0). For the nu =
1/3 fractional quantum Hall state (g = 1/3), we predict a 2-bit capacity,
observable as four distinct quantized conductance plateaus in quantum dot
spectroscopy, providing a direct signature of anyonic statistics.

### Exploiting correlations in multi-coincidence Coulomb explosion patterns for differentiating molecular structures using machine learning

- **TL;DR**: 提出基于机器学习分析的高维库仑爆炸成像新方法，可同时检测8个离子碎片，实现分子结构识别和异构体区分

Coulomb explosion imaging (CEI) is a powerful technique for capturing the
real-time motion of individual atoms during ultrafast photochemical reactions.
CEI generates high-dimensional data with naturally embedded correlations that
allow mapping the coordinated motion of nuclei in molecules. This enables
reliable separation of competing reaction pathways and makes this approach
uniquely suited for characterizing weak reaction channels. However, rich
information contained in experimental CEI patterns remains largely
underexploited due to challenges in visualizing correlations between multiple
observables in multi-dimensional parameter space. Here we present a new
approach to CEI of intermediate-sized polyatomic molecules, detecting up to
eight ionic fragments in coincidence and leveraging machine-learning-based
analysis to identify patterns and correlations in the resulting
high-dimensional momentum-space data, enabling robust molecular structure
identification and differentiation. Our approach provides high-dimensional
background-free data encoding exceptionally rich structural information and
establishes an automated, scalable framework for extracting insightful
information from the data. As a demonstration, we apply this method to image
and distinguish dichloroethylene isomers, showcasing its potential for broader
applications in molecular imaging. Our results pave the way for
channel-specific analysis of ultrafast structural dynamics in chemically
relevant systems, particularly for disentangling mixed reaction pathways and
detecting contributions from weak channels and minority species.

### Hydrogen storage in nanocrystalline high entropy material

In this study, a single-phase nanocrystalline Al-Cu-Fe-Ni-Cr high-entropy
alloy (HEA) has been synthesized by mechanical alloying and comprehensively
investigated for hydrogen storage responses evaluated in details. High-energy
attritor ball mill was used to synthesize the alloy from elemental powder, and
hexane medium was used as a process control agent. As synthesized materials was
nanocrystalline in nature after 40 h of milling with a lattice parameter of
0.289 nm body-centered cubic (BCC) phase. As synthesized nanocrystalline
Al-Cu-Fe-Ni-Cr HEA demonstrated remarkable hydrogen storage properties,
absorbing 2.1 wt.% of hydrogen in 3 minutes at 300{\deg}C with 50 atm of
hydrogen pressure. At the same temperature, it also desorbed about 1.6 wt.% of
hydrogen in 6 minutes. These quick rates of absorption and desorption
demonstrate how well the alloy absorbs and releases hydrogen. Additionally, the
alloy showed outstanding cyclic stability, retaining almost all of its hydrogen
capacity across 25 cycles with only a slight 0.2 wt.% loss. The nanocrystalline
Al-Cu-Fe-Ni-Cr HEA is a potential option for hydrogen storage applications due
to its outstanding cycle stability and fast kinetics of hydrogen storage and
release.

### Proximitizing altermagnets with conventional superconductors

- **TL;DR**: 通过邻近效应在反铁磁薄膜中诱导出混合单重态/三重态序参量的节点超导相，能够产生自旋极化持续电流

Recent theoretical work highlighted unique properties of superconducting
altermagnets, including the wealth of topologically non-trivial phases as well
as their potential uses in spintronic applications. Given that no intrinsically
superconducting altermagnets have yet been discovered, we study here the
possibility of superconducting order induced by proximity effect from a
conventional s-wave superconductor. Through symmetry analysis and microscopic
modeling we find that interesting superconducting phases can indeed be
proximity-induced in a thin altermagnetic film provided that weak Rashba
spin-orbit coupling is present at the interface. Surprisingly, the resulting
superconductor is generically nodal with a mixed singlet/triplet order
parameter and, importantly for applications, capable of generating
spin-polarized persistent current. We propose a set of candidate
heterostructures with low lattice mismatch suitable to probe these effects
experimentally.

### Ferromagnetism vs. Antiferromagnetism in Narrow-Band Systems: Competition Between Quantum Geometry and Band Dispersion

- **TL;DR**: 该研究提出了一个统一的理论框架来分析窄带系统中的自旋物理，发现非原子波函数特性倾向于铁磁有序，而能带色散促进反铁磁关联，两者竞争产生可调谐的磁相和丰富的自旋现象。

Magnetism in narrow-band systems arises from the interplay between electronic
correlations, quantum geometry, and band dispersion. In particular, both ferro
and anti-ferro magnets are known to occur as ground states of (different)
models featuring narrow bands. This poses the question of which is favored and
under what conditions. In this work, we present a unified theoretical framework
to investigate spin physics within narrow bands. By deriving an effective spin
model, we show that the non-atomic wavefunction of the narrow bands generally
favors ferromagnetic ordering, while band dispersion promotes antiferromagnetic
correlations. We find that the competition between these effects gives rise to
a tunable magnetic phase and rich spin phenomena. Our approach offers a
systematic way to study the magnetic properties of narrow-band systems,
integrating the roles of wave function, band structure, and correlation
effects.

### Exchange tensors, generalized RKKY interactions, and magnetization dynamics in heterostructures of ferromagnets and topological insulators

We present a comprehensive theoretical analysis of magnetic heterostructures
composed of ferromagnetic (FM) layers interfaced with three-dimensional
topological insulators (TIs). Integrating out the topological surface states
and computing the spin determinant to second order in spins, we derive the
effective generalized Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) exchange
interactions mediated by topological surface states. These interactions
inherently incorporate spin-momentum locking and anisotropic spin
susceptibilities stemming from the Dirac-like dispersion of the TI surface
electrons. The analysis reveals that the interplay between the spin-orbit
coupling intrinsic to the TI and the magnetization texture in the FM layer
induces highly nonlocal and retarded, chiral, and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
(DM)-like contributions to the effective spin Hamiltonian. Furthermore, the
spin dynamics is studied through a derivation of the LLG equation for this
problem. The induced interactions renormalize many of the FM's intrinsic
properties, but a term in the LLG equation is induced that is related to the
rate of change of the magnetization's curl, which is relevant to skyrmion
dynamics. The magnon dispersion exhibits modifications due to the TI-mediated
interactions, including tunable magnon gaps, sensitive to a tunable chemical
potential and interfacial exchange coupling strength. The results also apply to
finite temperatures. They elucidate topologically induced magnetic phenomena
and pave the way for engineering exotic spin textures, such as skyrmions and
chiral domain walls, in TI/FM hybrid systems with tunable interactions.

Our work is concerned with simplicial complexes that describe higher-order
interactions in real complex systems. This description allows to go beyond the
pairwise node-to-node representation that simple networks provide and to
capture a hierarchy of interactions of different orders. The prime contribution
of this work is the introduction of geometric measures for these simplicial
complexes. We do so by noting the non-commutativity of the algebra associated
with their matrix representations and consequently we bring to bear the
spectral triplet formalism of Connes on these structures and then notions of
associated dimensions, curvature, and distance can be computed to serve as
characterizing features in addition to known topological metrics.

### Surface Passivation for Halide Optoelectronics: Comparing Optimization and Reactivity of Amino-Silanes with Formamidinium

- **TL;DR**: 这篇论文比较了两种氨基硅烷基表面处理剂(APTMS和AEAPTMS)在碳化钠盐光电子学中的性能差异，发现AEAPTMS具有更宽的处理窗口和更高的性能，同时揭示了这些氨基硅烷与碳化钠盐之间的反应化学机理。

Amino-silane-based surface passivation schemes are gaining attention in
halide perovskite optoelectronics, with varying levels of success. We compare
surface treatments using (3-aminopropyl)trimethoxysilane (APTMS) and
[3-(2-aminoethylamino)propyl]trimethoxysilane (AEAPTMS), applied via
room-temperature vacuum deposition, to the perovskite
FA0.78Cs0.22Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 (FA = formamidinium). Both molecules improve
thin-film photoluminescence properties and photovoltaic device performance,
although their effectiveness depends strongly on deposition time. We show
AEAPTMS has a wider, more robust processing window and yields higher
performance under optimized conditions. In contrast, over-exposure,
particularly with APTMS, reduces performance, with notable reductions in
photoluminescence lifetime and absorbance. To probe the underlying chemistry,
we employ nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and depth-resolved
time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS), demonstrating that
both amino-silanes react with formamidinium (FA+) cations in solution and in
the solid state. This work underscores the importance of optimizing deposition
conditions to balance effective passivation with potential performance loss and
elucidates previously unrecognized reactive chemistry between amino-silane
passivating agents and halide perovskites.

others. WaveMixings.jl includes implementations of various methods developed by

create a versatile platform to perform simulations and develop methodologies
within the quasi-classical doorway-window approximation framework.

We study the Josephson effects in the superconductor/two-dimensional Weyl
nodal line semimetal/superconductor junctions using the Green's function
method. When the Rashba spin-orbit coupling and an external magnetic field
coexist in the semimetal, the symmetries protecting the reciprocity of
supercurrent can be broken and the Josephson diode effect with the
nonreciprocity of supercurrent can be realized. A high efficiency exceeding
$40\%$ can be achieved with the experimentally accessible values of the
magnetic field and the Rashba spin-orbit coupling. The diode efficiency can be
easily controlled by the direction and magnitude of the field and the strength
of the spin-orbit coupling. When the spin-orbit coupling is absent or the
external field is absent, the Josephson diode effect vanishes but the
current-phase difference relations still show strong dependence on the field or
the coupling. The tunable $0$-$\pi$ transition and the switch effect of
supercurrent in the junctions can be formed if the direction of the field is
rotated or the magnitude of the field and the strength of the coupling are
changed. The obtained Josephson diode effect, the $0$-$\pi$ transition and the
switch effect of supercurrent are helpful in the design of the quantum devices
based on nodal line semimetals.

We show that in classical spin systems the precise nature of the late-time
hydrodynamic tails of the autocorrelation functions of a generic observable is
determined by (i) the dynamical critical exponent and (ii) the equilibrium
thermodynamic properties of the corresponding observable. We provide numerical
results for one- and two-dimensional systems and present theoretical
considerations that only rely on the notion of ergodicity. Our result extends
to the classical framework the relaxation-overlap inequality, first introduced
in Capizzi et al. Phys. Rev. X 15, 011059 (2025)] for quantum many-body systems
satisfying the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis.

### Dissociation of bulk and entanglement phase transitions in the Haldane phase

We revisit the momentum-resolved entanglement spectrum (ES) of the spin-1/2
ladder in the Haldane phase, long believed to exhibit a des Cloizeaux-Pearson
(dCP)-type $\sin|k|$ dispersion. Using exact diagonalization up to 40 spins, we
resolve two distinct branches at $k=0$ and $k=\pi$, which were previously
interpreted as a single smooth mode due to SU(2) degeneracy and limited
resolution. Breaking SU(2) symmetry via XXZ anisotropy opens a spin or neutral
gap at $k=\pi$, depending on the anisotropy direction, triggering an
entanglement quantum phase transition that is disconnected from the bulk
critical point. In the easy-plane regime, the entanglement ground state is
unique in the $S_A^z=0$ sector but becomes quasi-degenerate across $S_A^z$
sectors in the thermodynamic limit, consistent with spontaneous U(1) symmetry
breaking. This separation between bulk and entanglement transitions
demonstrates that the Li-Haldane correspondence can fail in topological
ladders, even at the level of low-energy dispersions. These results revise the
prevailing picture of ES in spin ladders under extensive bipartitioning, and
suggest that the entanglement Hamiltonian, being nonlocal, can circumvent
conventional constraints such as the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis and Mermin-Wagner
theorems.

Moir\'e lattices provide a highly tunable platform for exploring the
interplay between electronic correlations and band topology. Introducing a
second moir\'e pattern extends this paradigm: interference between the two
moir\'e patterns produces a supermoir\'e modulation, opening a route to further
tailor electronic properties. Twisted trilayer graphene generally exemplifies
such a system: two distinct moir\'e patterns arise from the relative twists
between adjacent graphene layers. Here, we report the observation of correlated
phenomena across a wide range of twisted trilayer graphene devices whose twist
angles lie along two continuous lines in the twist-angle parameter space.
Depending on the degree of lattice relaxation, twisted trilayer graphene falls
into two classes: moir\'e polycrystals, composed of periodic domains with
locally commensurate moir\'e order, and moir\'e quasicrystals, characterized by
smoothly varying local moir\'e configurations. In helically twisted moir\'e
polycrystals, we observe an anomalous Hall effect, consistent with topological
bands arising from domains with broken $xy$-inversion symmetry. In contrast,
superconductivity appears generically in our moir\'e quasicrystals. A subset of
these systems exhibits signatures of spatially modulated superconductivity,
which we attribute to the supermoir\'e structure. Our findings uncover the
organizing principles of the observed correlated phases in twisted trilayer
graphene, highlight the critical roles of the supermoir\'e modulation and
lattice relaxation, and suggest a broader framework in which magic conditions
arise not as isolated points but as extended manifolds within the
multi-dimensional twist-angle space of complex moir\'e materials.

Dislocations are line defects in crystals that multiply and self-organize
into a complex network during strain hardening. The length of dislocation
links, connecting neighboring nodes within this network, contains crucial
information about the evolving dislocation microstructure. By analyzing data
from Discrete Dislocation Dynamics (DDD) simulations in face-centered cubic
(fcc) Cu, we characterize the statistical distribution of link lengths of
dislocation networks during strain hardening on individual slip systems. Our
analysis reveals that link lengths on active slip systems follow a
double-exponential distribution, while those on inactive slip systems conform
to a single-exponential distribution. The distinctive long tail observed in the
double-exponential distribution is attributed to the stress-induced bowing out
of long links on active slip systems, a feature that disappears upon removal of
the applied stress. We further demonstrate that both observed link length
distributions can be explained by extending a one-dimensional Poisson process
to include different growth functions. Specifically, the double-exponential
distribution emerges when the growth rate for links exceeding a critical length
becomes super-linear, which aligns with the physical phenomenon of long links
bowing out under stress. This work advances our understanding of dislocation
microstructure evolution during strain hardening and elucidates the underlying
physical mechanisms governing its formation.

### Excitonic description of singlet fission beyond dimer model : a matrix product state approach

The importance of singlet fission as a fundamental process with a variety of
implications in energy harvesting cannot be overstated. The challenge is in
characterizing the energy states of these large singlet fission molecular
aggregates that participate in the process. Large dimensionality and essential
multi-configuration nature of the electronic states of interest combine to make
accurate ab initio calculations prohibitively difficult. We present a
spin-resolved tight-binding excitonic model for singlet fission that can be
parameterized based on ab initio calculations on monomers and dimers of
molecules, and is highly suitable for the study of aggregates using tensor
network methods such as the density matrix renormalization group. This tensor
network coarse-grained model is demonstrated specifically on the pentacene
crystal, where we evaluate the spectra and density of states. We show the
natural emergence of bands of states in some cases, and characterize them.
Through an analysis of entanglement entropy of the eigenstates, we gain crucial
insight into the extent of their multireference character. This method is
useful in understanding not just the structure of these extended aggregates,
but also being the cornerstone for incorporation of vibronic features and
simulation of the singlet fission dynamics.

### Unconventional superconductivity in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides

A variety of experimental observations in monolayer transition metal
dichalcogenide superconductors with Ising spin-orbit coupling suggest the
presence of an unconventional superconducting pairing mechanism. Some of these
experiments include observation of Leggett modes and a nodal superconducting
gap in STM experiments, a large in-plane upper critical field compared to the
Pauli limit, and the observation of a two-fold gap anisotropy in
magnetoresistance measurements. Here, we propose a superconducting pairing
mechanism mediated by spin and charge fluctuations and identify the dominant
superconducting instability relevant to monolayer TaS$_2$. We then explore the
effect of an additional electron-phonon pairing contribution, and compare our
results with recent experimental findings. In particular, our theory stabilizes
a superconducting ground state with nodal-like density of states that agrees
with STM experiments. The theory obtains a large in-plane upper critical field
due to a combination of Ising spin-orbit coupling and even-odd parity mixing in
the superconducting state. Further, we find that an in-plane magnetic field
splits the degeneracy of the superconducting ground state, and the resulting
two-fold symmetric superconducting order parameter could explain the gap
anisotropy observed in magnetoresistance experiments. Overall, the proposed
theoretical pairing model can reconcile diverse experimental observations and
remains consistent with observations on other dichalcogenide superconductors
such as monolayer NbSe$_2$.

### Kinetic Random-Field Nonreciprocal Ising Model

We introduce and analyse the kinetic random-field nonreciprocal Ising model,
which incorporates bimodal disorder along with pairwise nonreciprocal
interactions between two different species. Using mean-field and
effective-field theory, in combination with kinetic Monte Carlo simulations (3D
Glauber dynamics), we identify a nonequilibrium tricritical (Bautin) point
separating Hopf-type transitions (continuous) from saddle-node-of-limit-cycle
(SNLC) transitions (discontinuous). For a weak random field which is less than
a critical value, the onset of collective oscillations (the "swap" phase)
occurs via a supercritical Hopf bifurcation, whereas for fields greater than
the critical value, the transition is first-order (SNLC), exhibiting hysteresis
and Binder-cumulant signatures. The finite-size scaling of the susceptibility
is consistent with the distinct critical and discontinuous behaviour shown in
the Hopf and SNLC regimes, respectively (effective exponents $\approx1.96$ in
the Hopf regime and $\approx3.0$ in the SNLC regime). Additionally, in the
first-order regime, the swap phase is sustained only above a threshold
nonreciprocity, and this threshold increases monotonically with the disorder
strength. We further identify a new droplet-induced swap phase in the larger
field-strength region, which cycles eight different metastable states. A
dynamical free-energy picture rationalises droplet nucleation as the mechanism
for these cyclic jumps. Together, these results demonstrate how disorder and
nonreciprocity combined generate rich nonequilibrium criticality, with
implications for driven and active systems.

### Mott Glass and Criticality in a S=1/2 Bilayer Heisenberg Model with Interlayer Bond Dilution

We employ the stochastic series expansion quantum Monte Carlo (SSE-QMC)
method to investigate the $S = 1/2$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on a
bilayer square lattice with diluted interlayer couplings. Both regular and
random dilution patterns are considered. In systems with regular dilution,
tuning the interlayer interaction drives a quantum phase transition from a
N\'eel-ordered phase to a quantum disordered phase, consistent with the $O(3)$
universality class. In contrast, random dilution gives rise to a two-step
transition: from the N\'eel phase to an intermediate Mott glass (MG) phase,
followed by a transition to the quantum disordered phase. Within the MG phase,
the uniform magnetic susceptibility exhibits a stretched-exponential
temperature dependence $\chi_u \sim \exp(-b/T^\alpha)$, $0 &lt; \alpha &lt; 1$. At
the N\'eel-to-glass transition, quenched disorder modifies the critical
exponents in a manner consistent with the Harris criterion. These findings
provide new insights into disorder-driven quantum phase transitions and the
emergence of glassy phases in diluted bilayer quantum magnets.

### Optical selection rules of topological excitons in flat bands

Topological excitons are superpositions of electron-hole pair states with an
envelope wavefunction that has finite vorticity in momentum space, dictated by
the topology of the electronic bands. We derive the optical selection rules for
topological excitons in flat bands, considering different topological two-band
models: a family of Hamiltonians with skyrmion pseudo-spin textures, the
flattened BHZ model for a single spin, which can have a net Chern number, and
the flattened Haldane model. We derive the selection rules for these three
models accounting for short-range interactions. We also consider the
non-hydrogenic spectrum of excitons in the single-spin flattened BHZ model with
Coulomb interactions. We show that for the case of two flat bands with skyrmion
pseudo-spin textures, all excitons are bright, and the handedness of the light
that couples to them is fixed by the vorticity of the pseudo-spin texture. For
the single-spin flattened BHZ model, we show that bright excitons couple to
circularly polarized light, regardless the range of the interactions. In the
flattened Haldane model, we find that topological excitons couple to
elliptically polarized light. We obtain the phase diagram for the polarization
of light in this model as a function of the microscopic parameters of the
Hamiltonian.

Designing metal hydrides for hydrogen storage remains a longstanding
challenge due to the vast compositional space and complex structure-property
relationships. Herein, for the first time, we present physically interpretable
models for predicting two key performance metrics, gravimetric hydrogen density
$w$ and equilibrium pressure $P_{\rm eq,RT}$ at room temperature, based on a
minimal set of chemically meaningful descriptors. Using a rigorously curated
dataset of $5,089$ metal hydride compositions from our recently developed
Digital Hydrogen Platform (\it{DigHyd}) based on large-scale data mining from
available experimental literature of solid-state hydrogen storage materials, we
systematically constructed over $1.6$ million candidate models using
combinations of scalar transformations and nonlinear link functions. The final
closed-form models, derived from $2$-$3$ descriptors each, achieve predictive
accuracies on par with state-of-the-art machine learning methods, while
maintaining full physical transparency. Strikingly, descriptor-based design
maps generated from these models reveal a fundamental trade-off between $w$ and
$P_{\rm eq,RT}$: saline-type hydrides, composed of light electropositive
elements, offer high $w$ but low $P_{\rm eq,RT}$, whereas interstitial-type
hydrides based on heavier electronegative transition metals show the opposite
trend. Notably, Be-based systems, such as Be-Na alloys, emerge as rare
candidates that simultaneously satisfy both performance metrics, attributed to
the unique combination of light mass and high molar density for Be. Our models
indicate that Be-based systems may offer renewed prospects for approaching
these benchmarks. These results provide chemically intuitive guidelines for
materials design and establish a scalable framework for the rational discovery
of materials in complex chemical spaces.

### Dynamical simulation of chiral induced spin-polarization and magnetization

Despite generally lacking ferromagnetic properties or strong spin-orbit
coupling, electrons in chiral molecules exhibit unique spin-dependent transport
behavior, known as chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS). This phenomenon
implies a profound connection between chirality and spin, and draws attention
to the link between chirality and magnetism. Experiments in recent years have
shown that chirality can induce spin-polarizations and magnetizations,
providing fresh insights into interpreting chirality-related biochemical
processes and designing nano-magnetic devices. In this paper, we present a
dynamical theoretical model aimed at elucidating how charge-polarization
combined with the CISS leads to spin-polarization and magnetization. Our
theoretical model successfully explains the spin-polarization and magnetization
observed in three types of experiments, where the charge-polarization is
induced in the chiral molecules by the dispersion interaction, gate voltage,
and molecular adsorption. The model simulates a clear time evolution process
and provides a comprehensive theoretical framework for this field.

We study the superconducting transport phenomena, involving lensing effect
and supercurrent in AA-stacked bilayer graphene, which is characterized by a
linear gapless band with two shifted Dirac cones. Our findings indicate that
cross Andreev reflection and Josephson current occur exclusively within the
intracone process, while intercone scatterings are strictly prohibited. The
normal/superconductor/normal junction can act as a superconducting lens for the
upper and lower cones. Depending on cone index, the transmitted electrons and
holes can be focused, collimated or diverged by adjusting the gate voltages. In
superconductor/normal/superconductor junction, due to interlayer coupling, the
critical currents of the two cones exhibit distinct oscillation periods with
junction width, leading to an irregular oscillation of the total critical
current. Furthermore, the oscillations of critical currents with exchange field
maintain a stable phase difference of one quarter period between the two cones.
Consequently, a cone-dependent 0-\pi transition is achieved in this Josephson
junction.

### Hyperuniformity and conservation laws in non-equilibrium systems

We demonstrate that hyperuniformity, the suppression of density fluctuations
at large length scales, emerges generically from the interplay between
conservation laws and non-equilibrium driving. The underlying mechanism for
this emergence is analogous to self-organized criticality. Based on this
understanding, we introduce four non-equilibrium models that consistently
demonstrate hyperuniformity. Furthermore, we show that systems with an
arbitrary number of conserved mass multipole moments exhibit an arbitrary
strong tunable hyperuniform scaling, with the structure factor following $S(k)
\sim k^m$, where $m$ is set by the number of conserved multipoles. Finally, we
find that hyperuniformity arising from a combination of conserved noise and
partially conserved average motion is not robust against non-linear
perturbations. These results highlight the central role of conservation laws in
stabilizing hyperuniformity and reveal a unifying mechanism for its emergence
in non-equilibrium systems.

We review quantum tunneling provoked by external field driving, focusing on
the role of geometric effects. The discussion begins with an overview of
tunneling phenomena, including the Landau-Zener model and the Schwinger effect,
both of which are essential frameworks to describe the generation of elementary
excitation of the system. We also refer to the relation between the modern
theory of polarization and the geometry of the system, and introduce the shift
vector via adiabatic perturbation theory. Then we introduce the twisted
Landau-Zener model and shown how the shift vector modulates tunneling
probability, followed by several illustrative applications of this model. We
also explain the Keldysh crossover, which is the crossover from a quantum
tunneling regime to photon absorption regime in driven systems.

We theoretically investigate strategies for harnessing quantum interference
to optimize the figure of merit $ZT$, power output, and thermodynamic
efficiency in multi-quantum-dot Aharonov-Bohm (AB) thermoelectric heat engines.
Using the non-equilibrium Green function formalism, we show that interference
effects such as Fano-type asymmetries, Dicke-like superradiant and subradiant
modes, and multi-peaked transmission spectra can be tailored through device
geometry, magnetic flux, and dot-lead coupling to produce hybrid transmission
profiles that combine Lorentzian, boxcar, and Fano lineshapes. Such engineered
profiles enable configurations that balance the high efficiency of sharp
Lorentzian resonances with the high power output of boxcar-like spectra,
yielding near-optimal power-efficiency trade-offs. For symmetric quantum-dot
arrays in square, pentagonal, and hexagonal configurations, we identify an
optimal regime, $t/\gamma \approx 2$, where the interdot tunneling amplitude
$t$ and the dot-lead coupling $\gamma$ yield the best balance of power and
efficiency. A hexagonal six-dot configuration achieves $ZT \sim 30$ at dilution
temperatures, while the four-dot geometry reaches about $76\%$ of Carnot
efficiency with output power $4.74$ fW. We also find a direct correspondence
between the high-$ZT$ regime and maximal violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law.
Introducing source-drain coupling asymmetry further enhances both efficiency
and power. A scaling analysis reveals that efficiency systematically increases
with the number of quantum dots, whereas power output is maximized at
intermediate system sizes. These findings establish coherent control in
multi-dot nanostructures as a promising pathway toward high-performance quantum
thermoelectric heat engines for ultralow-power electronics applications.

5 nm $\alpha$-Sn film shows an odd-function dependence on incident angle,
whereas that of the 10 and 30 nm films exhibit an even-function dependence.
Combined with high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM),
point-group symmetry analysis, and first-principles calculations, it is
revealed that a thickness-driven topological phase transition from a two
dimensional (2D) to a three dimensional (3D) topological insulator occurs
between 5 and 10 nm. These results demonstrate that HDPC serves as a sensitive
diagnostic tool for topological phase transitions. The tunable electronic
properties of $\alpha$-Sn(110) films enable thickness- and strain-mediated
control of topological states, establishing a versatile platform for exploring
emerging topological phenomena and developing spin-based devices.

The chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect, a phenomenon where the
chirality of molecules imparts significant spin selectivity to electron
transfer processes, has garnered increasing interest among the chemistry,
biology, and physics communities. Although this effect was discovered more than
a decade ago, the dynamical process of how electron spin polarization is caused
by chiral molecules is still unclear. Here, we propose a dynamical theory of
electron transfer in donor-chiral molecule bridge-acceptor systems without
electrodes or substrates based on the Lindblad-type master equation. We
demonstrate that the molecular spin-orbit coupling generates unequal spin
velocities and achieves steady spin polarization with the help of dephasing.
Our work elucidates the dynamical process of CISS and may promote the
applications of chiral-based spintronic devices.

We theoretically analyze two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS) signals
for disordered superconductors in two limits: One is the narrow-band limit with
sinusoidal pulse waves, and the other is the broad-band limit with
delta-function pulses. While the 2DCS signal in the narrow-band limit is
related to the third-order nonlinear susceptibilities $\chi^{(3)}(3\Omega;
\Omega, \Omega, \Omega)$ (third harmonic generation) and $\chi^{(3)}(\Omega;
\Omega, \Omega, -\Omega)$ (ac Kerr effect), we find that in the broad-band
limit the signal along the diagonal and horizontal lines in the two-dimensional
frequency space is related to another nonlinear susceptibility
$\chi^{(3)}(\Omega; \Omega, 0, 0)$ (dc Kerr effect). We numerically evaluate
those susceptibilities for a lattice model of superconductors based on the BCS
mean-field theory and self-consistent Born approximation for impurities. The
2DCS signals in the narrow-band and broad-band limits show threshold and
resonance behaviors at the superconducting-gap frequency, respectively, whose
physical origin is discussed in light of quasiparticle and Higgs-mode
excitations.

### Twisted quantum doubles are sign problem-free

- **TL;DR**: 双semion模型等拓扑相可以在无符号问题的局域哈密顿量中实现，打破了传统认为这些相必然存在符号问题的观念

The sign problem is one of the central obstacles to efficiently simulating
quantum many-body systems. It is commonly believed that some phases of matter,
such as the double semion model, have an intrinsic sign problem and can never
be realized in a local sign problem-free Hamiltonian due to the non-positivity
of the wavefunction. We show that this is not the case. Despite failing to be
stoquastic - the standard criteria for the existence of a sign problem - the
double semion model as well as all twisted quantum double phases of matter for
finite groups $\mathcal{G}$ can be realized in local sign problem-free
Hamiltonians. The lack of a sign problem is not fine-tuned and does not require
the Hamiltonian to be exactly solvable, with sign problem-free perturbations
allowing access to a variety of topological phase transitions.

### Three-channel charge Kondo model at high transparency

Quantum impurity models involving a localized charge that is weakly coupled
to electronic leads usually map to Kondo-like Hamiltonians that exhibit various
quantum critical behaviors. Here, we address the opposite regime of high
contact transparency by solving the model of a quantum island coupled to three
quantum Hall edge channels. Using a functional renormalization group (FRG)
approach, we demonstrate that the low-energy physics is controlled by a
nonperturbative fixed point. The universal energy crossover in both the linear
conductance and the impurity entropy is obtained. We reproduce the
zero-frequency conductance and the leading low-energy exponent of the
three-channel Kondo model, confirming their universality across all
transparencies. For interacting leads -- a model that continuously connects to
the pseudo-gap Kondo model at low transparency -- we find a line of fixed
points as the Luttinger parameter $K$, which encodes the strength of the
interactions, changes. Our work demonstrates that FRG methods are an efficient
tool for solving quantum impurity problems in regimes where standard approaches
fail.

### Grain boundary energy models and boundary splitting

- **TL;DR**: 该论文研究了晶界能模型中的边界解离问题，推导了防止边界分裂的不等式条件，并分析了能量模型允许边界分解的情况。

Models of grain boundary energy are essential for predicting the behavior of
polycrystalline materials. Typical models represent the minimum boundary energy
as a function of macroscopic boundary parameters. An energy model may allow for
boundary dissociation, i.e., for a further reduction of the overall energy by
splitting a boundary into two boundaries parallel to the original one. Such
splitting is prevented by constraining the energy model with inequalities
opposite to the boundary wetting condition. The inequalities are applicable
only to triplets of boundaries that match the assumed geometric configuration.
Relationships connecting the parameters of such boundaries are derived,
implications of the inequalities that prevent boundary splitting are
considered, and an example energy model is shown to allow boundary
decomposition. Knowing whether a given energy model permits boundary
dissociation and which boundaries can be affected is important for evaluating
its performance in polycrystal simulations.

Molecular chirality and electron spin are intricately intertwined via the
fascinating phenomenon of chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS), which has
garnered considerable attention due to its extensive potential applications. A
recent experiment has revealed that chiral molecules self-assembled on the gold
surface can modulate the inverse spin Hall effect, providing an alternative
platform for studying the interplay between chirality and spin transport. Our
study uncovers that this modulation stems from the CISS effect, which enhances
spin currents of one spin orientation while suppressing those of the opposite
spin orientation. We provide numerical results that are highly consistent with
the experimental phenomena and further investigate the influence of various
factors on this modulation. This work offers a theoretical explanation of
previously unexplained experimental findings, and the underlying physical
mechanism broadens current perspectives on understanding and applying CISS.

### Tunable Majorana corner states driven by superconducting phase bias in a vertical Josephson junction

The realization and manipulation of Majorana zero modes is a key step in
achieving topological quantum computation. In this paper, we demonstrate the
existence of Majorana corner states in a
superconductor-insulators-superconductor vertical Josephson junction. The
position of these Majorana corner states can be precisely and easily controlled
by the superconducting phase bias, which be confirmed through both numerical
and edge state theoretical analysis. In addition, we propose a protocol for
achieving topological braiding of the Majorana corner states in a system of
three circular vertical Josephson junctions. Our findings advance the field of
topological quantum computation by providing new insights into the efficient
and precise manipulation of Majorana corner states.

### The influence of the Casimir effect on the binding potential for 3D wetting

- **TL;DR**: 本文通过微观Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson哈密顿量，揭示了3D短程润湿中先前被忽视的熵性（低温卡西米尔）贡献WC对总结合势的重要作用。

We provide comprehensive details of how a previously overlooked entropic, or
low temperature Casimir contribution, $W_C$, to the total binding potential for
3D short-ranged wetting may be determined from a microscopic
Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson Hamiltonian. The entropic contribution comes from the
many microscopic configurations corresponding to a given interfacial one, which
arise from bulk-like fluctuations about the mean-field (MF) constrained
profile, and adds to the usual MF contribution $W_{MF}$. We determine the
functional dependence of $W_C$ on the interface (and wall) shape using a
boundary integral method which can be cast as a diagrammatic expansion with
each diagram corresponding to successively higher-order exponentially decaying
contributions. The decay of $W_C$ is qualitatively different for first-order
and critical wetting with the change in form occurring at the MF tricritical
point. Including the Casimir contribution to the binding potential preserves
the global surface phase diagram but changes, radically, predictions for
fluctuation effects at first-order and tricritical wetting, even when
capillary-wave fluctuations are not considered.

### Lattice dynamics of the infinite-layer nickelate LaNiO$_2$

- **TL;DR**: 本文通过中子散射研究了无限层镍酸盐LaNiO2的晶格动力学，首次在块状单晶样品中观察到多个色散声子支，并与铜酸盐超导体进行了比较。

Infinite-layer (IL) nickelates have rapidly emerged as a new class of
superconductors. However, due to the technical challenges of their topotactic
synthesis, they have so far been realized primarily as thin films or
polycrystalline powder samples, limiting comprehensive investigations of
fundamental physical properties such as the lattice dynamics. Here, we present
a time-of-flight inelastic neutron scattering study on a sample composed of a
large number of co-aligned bulk crystals of the IL nickelate LaNiO$_2$. We
observe several dispersive phonon branches, which are in good agreement with
lattice dynamical calculations based on density-functional perturbation theory.
In addition, we compare the characteristics of selected LaNiO$_2$ phonon modes
to those of isostructural cuprate superconductors. Our findings provide a
reference point for future experimental and theoretical efforts aimed at
understanding the interplay between lattice dynamics and electronic properties
in IL nickelates.

### Topological edge states in a double isomeric Class-II oligo(indenoindene)

I report the theoretical prediction of non-trivial physics in a one
dimensional multiradical system consisting in fused six and five membered
${\pi}$-conjugated carbon rings, known as oligo(indenoindene) (OInIn).
Topologically protected electronic states may emerge in fermionic chains if
there is an alternation in the coupling of adjacent unpaired electrons, being
described effectively by the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. Class-II OInIn
isomers act as tight-binding chains in the non-interacting regime, thus we can
expect the emergence of SSH physics in an OInIn produced by the combination of
two isomers that belong to this class. That is the case of the system studied
in this manuscript, whose calculated non-interacting band structure shows a gap
opening compared to the gapless pure isomeric forms, hosting ingap localized
states at the chain termini depending on the termination, and a non-zero Zak
phase that confirms the non-trivial topology. These results were consistent
with spin unrestricted mean-field Hubbard and density functional theory
calculations, showing antiferromagnetic unquenched local magnetic moments at
the pentagons, and strong edge localization depending on the termination. This
work advances in the understanding of the physics of non-alternant multiradical
${\pi}$-conjugated hydrocarbons.

Local positional disorder in soft, anharmonic materials has emerged as a
central factor in shaping their electronic, vibrational, optical, and transport
properties. Viewed mainly as a source of performance degradation, recent
theoretical insights reveal that local disorder profoundly influences the
electronic structure and phonon dynamics, without inducing deep electronic
traps or non-radiative recombination pathways. In this work, we highlight
advances in modeling local disorder using polymorphous and anharmonic
frameworks, showing how these methods explain experimental observations and
predict new trends. We emphasize the role of disorder in the breakdown of the
phonon quasiparticle picture and in modulating electron-phonon and
phonon-phonon interactions, particularly in soft, anharmonic phases of matter,
with significant effects on electrical and thermal transport. We outline
opportunities for integrating these insights into predictive modeling for
energy materials and propose combining advanced first-principles methods with
machine learning.

Chiral molecules have attracted significant multidisciplinary interest and
extensive research owing to their remarkable ability to achieve charge-to-spin
conversion, known as the chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS). A recent
experiment has revealed that chiral molecules also exhibit an unexpected
capability for spin-to-charge conversion, referred to as the inverse CISS
(ICISS), opening unprecedented avenues for the study and application of chiral
molecules. Here, we propose a specific theoretical explanation, suggesting that
ICISS arises from the spin-dependent deflection of electrons caused by the
interaction between the spin and chiral structure. Our numerical results are in
excellent agreement with experimental observations, demonstrating that ICISS
persists under strong disorder. Our model also reproduces the inverse spin Hall
effect (ISHE) in this experiment. Comparative analysis reveals that ICISS
employs an unconventional spin-to-charge conversion mechanism distinct from
conventional ISHE approaches. We provide a comprehensive explanation of ICISS,
elucidate experimental phenomena, and pave the way for organic-based
spintronics.

### Design of a Josephson diode based on double magnetic impurities

We theoretically propose a universal superconducting diode device based on
double magnetic impurities which are coupled to the connection region of the
Josephson junction. The positive and negative currents flowing across the
junction can generate opposite magnetic fields, flipping the magnetic moment of
the side magnetic impurity to the opposite directions, and in turn, the two
impurities will have different impacts on the opposite currents. This results
in the phenomenon that the positive and negative critical currents are unequal,
referred to as the superconducting diode effect (SDE). Using the nonequilibrium
Green's function method (NEGF), we obtain the direction-dependent critical
currents. We confirm the emergency of the SDE and demonstrate the dependence of
the superconducting diode efficiency on a range of parameters including the
magnitude, the direction, and the position of the magnetic moment. Besides, we
systematically analyze the symmetry relations of the nonreciprocity in our
system. Our proposal has high practicability by avoiding the demand on the
external magnetic field, the Cooper pair momentum, and the spin-orbit coupling.
Our approach opens up new possibilities for the development of nonreciprocal
electronic circuits and provides an alternate perspective on the advancement of
superconducting devices.

In topological materials, dissipationless edge currents are protected against
local defect scattering by the bulk inverted band structure and band gap. We
propose that large uniaxial strain can effectively switch a 2D Chern insulator
to a topologically trivial state. Further, we suggest that the boundary between
strained and unstrained regions of a sample can act as a new edge for
dissipationless current flow. Using density functional theory (DFT)
calculations we demonstrate the strain-tunability of the monolayer MnBi2S2T2
band structure and the switching of the Chern number. We combine uniaxial and
biaxial strain results to map out the strain-tuned topological phase diagram.

The Rashba effect, which plays a crucial role in fundamental materials
physics and potential spintronics applications, has been engineered in diverse
systems, including semiconductor quantum wells, oxide heterostructures,
metallic surfaces, topological insulators, ferroelectrics, etc. However,
generating it in systems that preserve bulk inversion symmetry (BIS), for
example, in bulk metals, has not been possible so far. We demonstrate a unique
strategy to introduce and tune Rashba spin-orbit interaction (SOI) to
unprecedented magnitudes in inversion-symmetric solids, by incorporating
ultra-small silver nanoparticles in bulk gold. The near-identical lattice
constants of Ag and Au allowed dense packing of the Ag/Au hetero-interfaces
without compromising the global BIS. By varying the density of embedded
nanoparticles, we generate Rashba SOI in a bulk metal with a coupling strength
of ~15 meV.Angstrom, higher than any known system preserving BIS globally, and
up to ~20 times increase in the spin-orbit scattering rate. We argue that the
combined effect of charge-transfer at the interfaces and polaronic localization
enhances the SOI.

The active layer in a perovskite solar cell is usually composed of a
polycrystalline thin film. Fabrication of this layer by solution processing is
a promising candidate for up-scaling to the mass market. However, the evolution
of an evaporating and simultaneously crystallizing thin film is not yet fully
understood. To contribute to the understanding of the formation of thin films,
we develop a geometrical model that deals with the effect of the interplay
between solvent evaporation and crystal growth on the dry film morphology. The
possible film formation mechanisms are investigated, depending on the
processing conditions. We find eleven formation pathways leading to four
distinct morphologies. It is shown how these formation pathways can be utilized
by adapting the process parameters to the material properties. Pinhole-free and
flat films can be fabricated if the evaporation rate is high in comparison to
the crystal growth rate. Alternatively, providing a high crystal number density
on the substrate can lead to the desired film morphology at low drying rates.
The generality of the model makes it applicable to any evaporating and
simultaneously crystallizing thin film.

We present a particle-number conserving theory for many-body effects in
mesoscopic superconducting islands connected to normal electrodes, which
explicitly includes quantum fluctuations of Cooper pairs in the condensate.
Beyond previous BCS mean-field descriptions, our theory can precisely treat the
pairing and Coulomb interactions over an unprecedentedly broad range of
parameters by using the numerical renormalization group method. On increasing
the ratio of pairing to Coulomb interactions, the low-energy physics of the
system evolves from the spin Kondo to mixed valence regimes and eventually
reaches an anisotropic charge Kondo phase, while a crossover from $1e$- to
$2e$-periodic Coulomb blockade of transport is revealed at high temperatures.
For weak pairing, the superconducting condensate is frozen in the local
spin-flip processes but fluctuates in the virtual excitations, yielding an
enhanced spin Kondo temperature. For strong pairing, massive fluctuations of
Cooper pairs are crucial for establishing charge Kondo correlations whose Kondo
temperature rapidly decreases with the pairing interaction. Surprisingly, a
charge-exchange induced local field may occur even at the charge degenerate
point, thereby destroying the charge Kondo effect. These are demonstrated in
the spectral and transport properties of the island.

underlying Hamiltonian. Our approach extends the mode-shell correspondence,
originally formulated for single-particle Hamiltonians, to Gaussian states
subject to chiral constraints. In this correspondence, the mode index counts
topological boundary modes, while the shell index quantifies the bulk topology
in a surrounding region, providing a bulk-boundary diagnostic. In
one-dimensional topological insulators, the shell index reduces to the local
chiral marker, recovering the winding number in the translation-invariant
limit. We apply the mode-shell correspondence to a $C_4$-symmetric higher-order
topological insulator with a chiral constraint and show that a fractional shell
index implies that the higher-order phase is intrinsic. The one-particle
density matrix is formulated in real space, so the mode-shell correspondence
applies to models without translation invariance. By introducing structural
disorder into the $C_4$-symmetric higher-order insulator, we show that the
mode-shell correspondence remains a meaningful diagnostic in the amorphous
limit. The mode-shell correspondence generalizes to interacting states with a
gapped bulk spectrum in the one-particle density matrix, providing a practical
and diverse route to characterize higher-order topology from the quantum state
itself.

- **TL;DR**: Error

Magnetic exchange interactions (MEIs) in kagome magnets exhibit rich features
due to the interplay of charge, spin, orbital and lattice degrees of freedom,
giving rise to a variety of exotic quantum states. Through first-principles
calculations, we systematically investigate the MEIs in kagome antiferromagnets
FeGe and FeSn. While the antiferromagnetic order originates from the interlayer
coupling between neighboring kagome layers, Fe atoms within each kagome layer
couple ferromagnetically, driven by the competition between ferromagnetically
favorable direct MEIs and antiferromagnetically favorable
Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interactions. The stronger direct MEIs but
weaker RKKY interactions in FeGe result in a substantially higher N\'eel
temperature with respect to FeSn. Interestingly, the nearest neighboring
exchange energy in both materials approximately linearly depends on the Fe-Fe
bond length, so that moderate compressive strain can significantly enhance
their N\'eel temperatures.

The development of advanced diagnostic systems to measure and optimize
emerging energetic material performance is critical for the defeat of Chemical
Warfare Agents (CWA). This study presents an integrated multi-spectroscopic
approach to monitor the interaction between a CWA simulant, Diisopropyl Methyl
Phosphonate (DIMP), and combusting composite metal particles. A custom benchtop
Polygonal Rotating Mirror Infrared Spectrometer (PRiMIRS), equipped with a
customizable experimental chamber, is employed to observe DIMP decomposition.
Tunable Diode Laser Absorption Spectroscopy (TDLAS) is used to measure
path-averaged gas temperature profiles during combustion. In the experiment,
the chamber is preheated to evaporate liquid DIMP. Various composite metal
powders (Al-8Mg):3Zr, (Al-8Mg):Zr, 2(Al-8Mg):Zr, and 4(Al-8Mg):Zr are placed on
a stainless steel mount and ignited using 3Al-2Ni sputter-deposited nanolayered
foils. The combusting metal particles mix with the DIMP vapor, initiating
chemical and thermal interactions. PRiMIRS captures DIMP spectral evolution,
while TDLAS simultaneously monitors gas temperature. A spectral defeat
parameter was developed to enable quantitative real-time assessment of the DIMP
destruction. It uses infrared light absorption by both from DIMP and its
immediate decomposition products Isopropyl Methyl Phosphonate (IMP) and
Isopropyl Alcohol (IPA). Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) serves
as a secondary verification tool quantifying the decomposition products over
extended timeframes, and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) confirms the
expected metal oxide dispersion within the reaction space. This study reports
variability in DIMP defeat as a function of metal powder stoichiometry, metal
powder loading, and path-averaged gas temperature profiles, offering critical
insights into optimizing reactive materials for effective CWA neutralization.

We investigate the persistent current in a correlated trimer nanoring
comprising of three magnetic atoms, which sits on a metallic host and encloses
a magnetic flux. In the molecular-orbital regime, charge fluctuations can
reverse the aromaticity of the trimer molecule by driving quantum phase
transitions between many-body states. It is shown that in frustrated trimers
the superexchange-induced current as a function of interatom hopping is
enhanced by the competition of conflicting magnetic orders, with an asymmetric
peak at the quantum criticality separating the ferromagnetic and
antiferromagnetic Kondo regimes. Interestingly, the critical current undergoes
an anomalous rise with temperature before decaying, signaling the suppression
of Kondo bound state at finite temperature. Our results demonstrate that the
coherent current response to external flux indeed conveys important information
on the states of strongly correlated systems.

We investigate double quantum dots defined by electrostatic gating in
semiconductor PbTe nanowire devices. We perform transport measurements to
obtain charge stability diagrams distinguished by negligible separation between
paired triple points and by the spin degeneracy of all transport resonances at
zero magnetic field. We show a fourfold splitting of high-bias stability
diagram triangles in an applied magnetic field to illustrate the lifting of
this spin degeneracy. We also identify patterns of narrow transport resonances
in these high-bias triangles and discuss their possible physical origins. Our
results represent a step towards the realization of PbTe-based spin qubits.

Understanding and modeling energy transfer mechanisms in rare-earth-doped
nanomaterials is essential for advancing luminescent technologies used in
bioimaging, optical thermometry, and solid-state lasers. In this work, we
investigate the photoluminescence dynamics of Yb3+ and Er3+ ions in Y2O3
nanoparticles over a wide concentration range (0.5-17%), using both direct and
upconversion excitation. Luminescence decays of green, red, and near-infrared
transitions were measured and analyzed using a rate-equation model
incorporating radiative and non-radiative processes, energy transfer
mechanisms, and defect-related quenching. The model successfully reproduces
experimental trends across most concentrations and excitation paths. This work
provides a reliable and predictive framework for modeling energy transfer in
rare-earth doped materials and offers valuable insights for optimizing
photoluminescent properties in nanostructured systems.

### Toward an affordable density-based measure for the quality of a coupled cluster calculation

- **TL;DR**: 提出两个新的静态相关诊断标志：聚合集CCSD和CCSD(T)之间Matito静态相关诊断标志的变化量，以及该变化量与总相关诊断标志变化量的比值。这些诊断标志可用于评估聚合集计算中静态相关的影响程度和预测高阶相关效应的重要性。

We propose two new diagnostics for the degree to which static correlation
impacts the quality of a coupled cluster calculation. The first is the change
in the Matito static correlation diagnostic $\overline{I_{ND}}$ between CCSD
and CCSD(T), $\Delta
I_{ND}[\textrm{(T)}]=\overline{I_{ND}}[\textrm{CCSD(T)}]-\overline{I_{ND}}[\textrm{CCSD}]$.
The second is the ratio of the same and of the corresponding change in the
total correlation diagnostic
$\overline{I_{T}}=\overline{I_{ND}}+\overline{I_{D}}$, i.e., $r_I[(T)]=\Delta
I_{ND}[\textrm{(T)}]/\Delta I_{T}[\textrm{(T)}]$. The first diagnostic can be
extended to higher-order improvements in the wave function, e.g., $\Delta
I_{ND}[\textrm{(Q)}]=\overline{I_{ND}}[\textrm{CCSDT(Q)}]-\overline{I_{ND}}[\textrm{CCSDT}]$.
In general, a small $\Delta I_{ND}$[\textrm{level$_1$}] value indicates that at
this level$_1$ of theory, the density is converged and any further changes to
the energy come from dynamical correlation, while larger $\Delta
I_{ND}$[\textrm{level$_2$}] indicates that the density is still not converged
at level$_2$ and some static correlation remains. $r_I[(T)]$ is found to be a
moderately good predictor for the importance of post-CCSD(T) correlation
effects.

The magnetic doublet ground state (GS) of a quantum dot (QD) could be changed
to a spin-singlet GS by coupling to a superconductor. In analogy, here we study
the GS phase transitions in QD-Majorana zero mode (MZM) coupling systems: GS
behaves phase transition versus intra-dot energy level and QD-MZM coupling
strength. The phase diagrams of GS are obtained, for cases with and without
Zeeman term. Along with the phase transition, we also study the change of spin
feature and density of states. The properties of the phase transition are
understood via a mean-field picture. Our study not only serves as an analogue
to QD-superconductor phase transitions, but also gives alternative explanations
on MZM-relevant experiments.

We present a combined computational and experimental study of Nb$_3$Cl$_8$, a
correlated layered material containing Nb trimers, through the lens of
competing intra- and intercluster interactions. Different proposed explanations
for its magnetostructural transition such as charge disproportionation,
antiferromagnetic quenching, and interlayer singlet formation are investigated
in light of the various reported low-temperature structures. Our findings rule
out the previously proposed charge-disproportionation, suggest an intricate
interplay between Mott physics and the formation of interlayer singlets, and
also hint at a possible explanation of the observed intratrimer scissoring
distortion. We suggest that the physics of Nb$_3$Cl$_8$ should be understood in
the context of weakly coupled Hubbard dimers.

We study surface plasmons in minimally-twisted bilayer graphene that contains
a triangular network of partial dislocations (or AB-BA domain walls) hosting
one-dimensional electronic states. We calculate plasmon dispersion by solving
classical equations of motion for charge dynamics on the network links with
impedance boundary conditions at the network nodes. The plasmon band structure
is shown to be quasi-periodic in frequency and damped everywhere except at
high-symmetry points of the moir\'e Brillouin zone. We compare our
network-based formalism with the conventional random phase approximation and
discuss when each approach is valid. Calculations of plasmon waves launched by
local scatterers are presented to simulate terahertz nano-imaging experiments.

### Low-rank matrix and tensor approximations: advancing efficiency of machine-learning interatomic potentials

- **TL;DR**: 通过低秩矩阵和张量因子分解技术，对机器学习间原子潜力（MLIPs）进行压缩，在保持准确性的前提下实现了达到50%的压缩效果。

Machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have become a mainstay in
computationally-guided materials science, surpassing traditional force fields
due to their flexible functional form and superior accuracy in reproducing
physical properties of materials. This flexibility is achieved through
mathematically-rigorous basis sets that describe interatomic interactions
within a local atomic environment. The number of parameters in these basis sets
influences both the size of the training dataset required and the computational
speed of the MLIP. Consequently, compressing MLIPs by reducing the number of
parameters is a promising route to more efficient simulations. In this work, we
use low-rank matrix and tensor factorizations under fixed-rank constraints to
achieve this compression. In addition, we demonstrate that an algorithm with
automatic rank augmentation helps to find a deeper local minimum of the fitted
potential. The methodology is verified using the Moment Tensor Potential (MTP)
model and benchmarked on multi-component systems: a Mo-Nb-Ta-W medium-entropy
alloy, molten LiF-NaF-KF, and a glycine molecular crystal. The proposed
approach achieves up to 50% compression without any loss of MTP accuracy and
can be applied to compress other MLIPs.

We study the subgap transport through the antiferromagnet/superconductor
(AF/S) and antiferromagnet/superconductor/antiferromagnet (AF/S/AF) junctions
controlled by electric field in a generic buckled honeycomb system, such as
silicene, germanene, and stanene. In the present of electric field and
antiferromagnetic exchange field, the spin-valley polarized half metallic phase
can be achieved in the honeycomb system due to the spin-orbit coupling, which
affords an opportunity to generate the pure crossed Andreev reflection (CAR).
It is found that the pure CAR can be generated without local Andreev reflection
(AR) and elastic cotunneling (EC) over a wide range of electric field. A
spin-valley switch effect can be realized between the pure CAR and the pure EC
by adjusting the electric field. The properties of AR process and CAR process
strongly depend on the spin-valley polarized states. Our results suggest that
the device can implement an electrical measurement of the CAR process and
spin-valley switch.

The subtle interplay between spin-orbit coupling, exchange interactions, and
cation ordering can lead to exotic magnetic states in transition-metal ions. We
report a comprehensive study of the Re-based (5$d^1$) ordered double perovskite
oxide Sr$_2$ZnReO$_6$ combining synchrotron x-ray diffraction (XRD), magnetic
susceptibility, muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR) measurements, and density
functional theory (DFT) calculations. XRD reveals that Sr$_2$ZnReO$_6$
crystallizes in the monoclinic structure (space group $P2_1/n$) at low
temperature. Magnetic susceptibility data indicate a transition below $\sim$13
K, with $M$--$H$ loops showing ferromagnetic-like hysteresis and an unusually
high coercive field of 23 kOe at 2 K. Zero-field $\mu$SR measurements detect
static and spatially disordered internal fields below $T_M \simeq $ 12 K,
consistent with a canted antiferromagnetic ground state determined by detailed
DFT and force-theorem in Hubbard-I calculations. The reduced high-temperature
effective moment ($\sim0.76~\mu_B$) and very small static moment ($\lesssim
0.222~\mu_B$) derived from $\mu$SR analysis and local-field simulations
indicate a decisive role of spin-orbit coupling. Through a combined
experimental and computational approach we unambiguously determine the canted
antiferromagnetic order in Sr$_2$ZnReO$_6$, showing that a very small ordered
moment coexists with an exceptionally large coercivity. These results
underscore the crucial role of spin-orbit coupling and orbital ordering,
providing new insights into magnetism in 5$d^1$ double perovskites.

### Spin Splitting Nernst Effect in Altermagnet

Altermagnet is a distinctive magnet phase, which has spin-split energy band
but with zero net magnetic moment. In this paper, we propose that altermagnet
behaves spin splitting Nernst effect: Under a longitudinal temperature
gradient, the electrons with opposite spins tend to split oppositely in the
transverse direction, thus generating a transverse spin current. The spin
splitting Nernst effect is understood from the contribution of the longitudinal
wave vector to the transverse group velocity. Using the nonequilibrium Green's
function method, we calculate the spin-dependent transmission coefficient in
the four-terminal altermagnet device. From the spin-dependent transmission
coefficient, the nonzero transverse spin current from longitudinal temperature
gradient is obtained, and the spin splitting Nernst effect is verified. We
systematically study the parameter dependence of the spin splitting Nernst
effect, while also performing symmetry analysis. The spin splitting Nernst
effect can be easily regulated by Fermi surface energy, temperature, transport
direction, and system size. Furthermore, in altermagnet, the $xy$-response and
$yx$-response spin splitting Nernst coefficients are equal with
$N_{s,xy}=N_{s,yx}$, different from the conventional spin Nernst effect where
they are opposite. Meanwhile, the spin splitting Nernst effect require neither
spin-orbit coupling nor net magnetism.

Motivated by the recent observation of giant room-temperature magnon spin
conductivity in an ultrathin ferromagnetic insulator [X.-Y. Wei et al., Nat.
Mater. 21, 1352 (2022)], we investigate thickness-dependent magnon spin
transport in thin antiferromagnetic insulators (AFIs). We study the
prototypical AFI hematite, known for its exceptionally low magnetic damping and
two distinct magnetic phases: a low-temperature uniaxial easy-axis phase and a
high-temperature biaxial easy-plane phase. Using stochastic micromagnetic
simulations, we investigate thickness-dependent magnon spin transport across
both magnetic phases. Our results uncover a crossover from
quasi-three-dimensional to quasi-two-dimensional magnon spin transport at a
critical thickness, determined by the frequency or energy of the excited
magnons. Below this critical thickness, we observe a pronounced enhancement in
the magnon diffusion length in both magnetic phases. This rise is attributed to
a change in the effective magnon density of states, reflecting the reduced
phase space available for scattering in the thinner, quasi-two-dimensional
regime. Understanding and controlling long-distance magnon spin transport in
AFIs is crucial for developing next-generation spintronic nanodevices,
especially as materials approach the two-dimensional limit.

Kitaev magnets have emerged as pivotal systems for investigating frustrated
magnetism, providing a unique platform to explore quantum phases governed by
the interplay between bond-dependent anisotropy and external magnetic fields.
However, the quantum phase diagrams, particularly near the dominant
antiferromagnetic Kitaev regime, remain puzzling despite extensive studies. In
this work, we perform unbiased exact diagonalization calculations of the
Kitaev-$\Gamma$ model in a [111] magnetic field on a $C_{6}$-symmetric 24-site
cluster. By calculating the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ flux density and the topological
entanglement entropy, we reveal multiple phase transitions and identify
signatures of both scalar and vector chiral orders in the intermediate-field
regime between the Kitaev spin liquid and the polarized phase. As the negative
$\Gamma$ interaction increases, we discover a proximate quantum spin liquid
featured by a three-peak specific heat and a spin-flop phase at a moderate
magnetic field. Our findings provide insight into the field-induced
intermediate phases in the antiferromagnetic Kitaev model and pave the way for
the hunt for emergent phases in real materials.

Artificial atoms in graphene hosting a series of quasi-bound states can serve
as an excellent platform to explore atomic collapse and become a basis to
design novel graphene nanodevices. We theoretically study behaviors of massless
Dirac fermions in singular potentials with a general form of 1/r^{\gamma}.
Different from the Coulomb potential that demands a supercritical charge Z &gt;
Zc, a high-order singular potential ({\gamma} &gt; 1) is found to in principle
induce atomic collapse with an infinitesimal charge Z. The energies of atomic
collapse states (ACSs) within these potentials are arranged roughly as a power
sequence. We also show that some special ACSs can exist even above the bulk
Dirac point, which cannot appear in the Coulomb potential. These findings
uncover the anomalies of massless Dirac fermions in diverse charge potentials
and provide guidance for further experiments and graphene nanodevice
applications.

### Chiral Graviton Theory of Fractional Quantum Hall States

Recent polarized Raman scattering experiments indicate that fractional
quantum Hall systems host a chiral spin-2 neutral collective mode, the
long-wavelength limit of the magnetoroton, which behaves as a condensed-matter
graviton. We present a nonlinear, gauge-invariant effective theory by gauging
area-preserving diffeomorphisms (APDs) with a unimodular spatial metric as the
gauge field. A Stueckelberg construction introduces an APD-invariant local
potential that aligns the dynamical metric with a reference geometry, opening a
tunable gap while preserving gauge redundancy. Together with a geometric
Maxwell kinetic sector and the Wen-Zee and gravitational Chern-Simons terms,
the theory yields a gapped chiral spin-2 excitation consistent with universal
long-wavelength constraints. The tunable gap emerges naturally from symmetry
and provides a route to an isotropic-nematic quantum critical point where the
spin-2 mode softens. We further establish a linear dictionary to quadrupolar
deformations in composite Fermi liquid bosonization, and outline applications
to fractional Chern insulators as well as higher-dimensional generalizations.
Finally, the approach can be extended to non-Abelian fractional quantum Hall

Antiferromagnetic superlattices (AFSL) are proposed based on the buckled
hexagonal two-dimensional materials, which can be realized by the proximity
effect of the periodically deposited antiferromagnets. It is found that the AF
proximity effect can give rise to valley-polarized minibands and conductance,
which are not held under ferromagnetic proximity. The spin degeneracy and
valley degeneracy are lifted simultaneously in the presence of AF proximity and
electric field. In consequence, both minibands and conductance could be
spin-valley polarized completely in AFSL. The symmetry of spin-valley
polarization is analysed by considering the pseudospin rotation operations and
spatial inversion operations. Furthermore, AFSL also induce a highly
anisotropic band structure due to the spin-orbit coupling (SOC). In particular,
the group velocity parallel to the periodic direction of AFSL is greatly
renormalized, while the velocity perpendicular to the periodic direction
remains unaffected, contrary to that observed in graphene superlattices. With
the increase of SOC, the anisotropy becomes more prominent, leading to
flattened band and electron supercollimation. The direction of anisotropy can
be regulated by adjusting the potential and SOC. These findings offer an
alternative approach to engineering anisotropic two-dimensional materials. As
an application, the AFSL may well work as a symmetry-protected spin-valley
valve easily controlled by the gate voltages.

- **TL;DR**: Error

Recently, antiferromagnetic (AF) materials have attracted rapid attention,
because they are considered as outstanding candidates to replace the widely
used ferromagnets in the next generation of spintronics. We propose a
magnetoresistance model based on the quantum anomalous Hall effect in an AF
system, which is protected by the topological Chern number. By regulating the
AF exchange field and an electric field, the system can be controlled between
the quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI) phases and the quantum anomalous Hall
insulator (QAHI) phases. As a result, a QAHI/QSHI/QAHI junction can be formed.
In the QAHI region, the spin orientation of chiral edge state can be
manipulated by tuning the AF exchange field and the electric field. Therefore,
the spin directions of two QAHIs in the junction can have parallel and
antiparallel configurations. The conductances of two configurations offered by
chiral edge states are significantly different, and this is a magnetoresistance
effect that can be electrically controlled. Because of the topological
invariance, the magnetoresistance plateaus are robust to the size effect and
the disorder.

We present angle-resolved reflected electron spectroscopy (ARRES) data for
the three molybdenum-based transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) \mos, \mose,
and \mote. To follow the changes as the series moves from S to Se to Te in more
detail, we determine accurate IV-spectra for monolayers and bulk TMDs. These
experimental data sets are then compared with theoretical predictions for both
the unoccupied band structure and the scattering density of states. We find
good agreement, especially for lower energies where inelastic effects are
relatively unimportant. Furthermore, we identify a series of interlayer
resonances for which the dependence of the hybridization effects on the layer
count is observed. Although these resonances bear similarity to interlayer
resonances in hBN and graphene, they differ in their character, being dominated
by unoccupied $d$-states of the chalcogen-atoms. The unoccupied states studied
and analyzed here play a key role in all processes that require an electron to
temporarily reside in a state above the vacuum level, such as in photoemission
and secondary electron emission experiments.

### Two-dimensional Dirac semimetals with tunable edge states

We theoretically propose a design for two-dimensional Dirac semimetals using
a bilayer-modified Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang (BHZ) model. By introducing new sites
into the BHZ model, we engineer flat bands at the Fermi energy. In the bilayer
system, interlayer coupling separates these flat bands, resulting in two Dirac
points that preserve time-reversal and inversion symmetries. Two Dirac points
are connected by a one-dimensional Fermi arc edge state, whose bound nature is
confirmed by quantized transmission resonance peaks. Notably, the position of
the Dirac points can be precisely tuned by adjusting interlayer coupling
strengths and symmetries.

We investigate the energy band structure and energy levels of graphene with
staggered intrinsic spin-orbit coupling and in-plane Zeeman fields. Our study
demonstrates that staggered intrinsic spin-orbit coupling induces bulk band
crossover at the the \( K \) and \( K' \) valleys and generates antihelical
edge states at the zigzag boundaries, resulting in topological metallic phases.
Quantized transport coefficients confirm the existence of these antihelical
edge states. Furthermore, an in-plane Zeeman field, regardless of orientation,
opens a gap in the antihelical edge states while preserving bulk band closure,
leading to higher-order topological metals with corner states. We also validate
the presence of these corner states in nanoflakes with zigzag boundaries and
confirm the metallic phases with crossed bands through a continuum low-energy
model analysis.

### Zero modes and index theorems for non-Hermitian Dirac fermions

Dirac fermions, subject to external magnetic fields and in the presence of
mass orders that assume topologically nontrivial spatial textures such as
domain-wall and vortices, for example, bind robust mid-gap states at
zero-energy, the number of which is governed by the Aharonov-Casher and
Jackiw-Rebbi or Jackiw-Rossi index theorems, respectively. Here I extend the
jurisdiction of these prominent index theorems to Lorentz invariant
non-Hermitian (NH) Dirac operators, constructed by augmenting the celebrated
Dirac Hamiltonian by a masslike anti-Hermitian operator that also scales
linearly with momentum. The resulting NH Dirac operator manifests real
eigenvalues over an extended NH parameter regime, characterized by a real
effective Fermi velocity for NH Dirac fermions. From the explicit solutions of
the zero-energy bound states, I show that in the presence of external magnetic
fields of arbitrary shape such modes always exist when the system encloses a
finite number of magnetic flux quanta, while in the presence of spatially
non-trivial textures of the mass orders localized zero-energy modes can only be
found in the spectrum when the effective Fermi velocity for NH Dirac fermions
is real. These findings pave a concrete route to realize nucleation of
competing orders from the topologically robust zero-energy manifold in NH or
open Dirac systems. Possible experimental setups to test these predictions are
discussed.

### Altermagnetism-Induced Parity Anomaly in Weak Topological Insulators

- **TL;DR**: 在弱拓扑绝缘体表面引入交变磁性可产生具有奇偶异常的无质量迪克拉子，导致半整数边缘流和半量子化震电导，为研究奇偶异常提供了无净磁矢量平台。

We demonstrate that introducing altermagnetism on the surface of a weak
topological insulator (TI) results in the emergence of a single massless Dirac
fermion, exhibiting a parity anomaly. To explore the transport properties
induced by this parity anomaly, we propose an effective two-dimensional (2D)
lattice model to describe the weak TI surface. This model captures both the
energy spectrum and spin texture of the weak TI surface while reducing
computational complexity. We show that the weak TI surface hosts a half-integer
chiral edge current under the influence of altermagnetism. Additionally, in the
presence of decoherence, the Hall conductance attains a half-quantized value.
Layer-resolved calculations from a 3D slab model further confirm that surface
altermagnetism drives the surface Hall conductance to transition to $e^{2}/2h$,
aligning with calculation from the 2D effective lattice model. Our findings
establish a link between altermagnetism and quantum anomalies, positioning weak
TIs as a potential platform for investigating the parity anomaly without a net
magnetic moment.

### Interplay of Altermagnetic Order and Wilson Mass in the Dirac Equation: Helical Edge States without Time-Reversal Symmetry

- **TL;DR**: Error

We investigate topological phases in three-dimensional topological insulator
(3DTI) thin films interfaced with altermagnetic (AM) orders. Starting from a
modified Dirac equation, we elucidate the interplay between the Wilson mass,
arising from lattice regularization, and the altermagnetic mass, and show how
this interplay fundamentally alters the band topology and boundary modes. In
particular, we demonstrate that coupling a 3DTI thin film to AM order induces a
topological phase transition: although the total Chern number remains zero
across the transition, topological helical edge states emerge after the
transition. These helical edge states arise from opposite Chern numbers at
different high-symmetry points, and are distinct from both the chiral edge
states of the quantum anomalous Hall phase and the helical edge states of the
conventional quantum spin Hall states. The quantum transport simulations reveal
robust, quantized nonlocal resistance plateaus associated with these helical
edge states, which persist even under strong potential and magnetic disorder.
Our results establish 3DTI/AM heterostructures as a feasible material platform
for engineering and detecting helical topological edge transport without
time-reversal symmetry, thus expanding the landscape of topological matter and
providing new opportunities for quantum devices.

### Band bending and zero-conductance resonances controlled by edge electric fields in zigzag silicene nanoribbons

- **TL;DR**: 通过在碳化硅纳米带边缘加不同电场，实现了能带弯曲、谷极化狄流子狄斯坦狄狄态等量子运输特性的控制，并考察了哈伯相互作用的影响。

We study the band structure and transport property of a zigzag silicene
nanoribbon when the electric fields are applied to the edges. It is found that
a band bending could be induced and controlled by the antisymmetric edge
fields, which can be understood based on the wave functions of the edge states.
The highest valence band and the lowest conduction band coexist in the band
bending region. With the narrowing of edge potentials, the bending increases
gradually. When the edge fields become symmetric, an asymmetric band gap at the
Dirac points can be obtained due to the intrinsic spin-orbit interaction,
suggesting a valley polarized quantum spin Hall state. The gap could reach a
maximum value rapidly and then decrease slowly as the electric fields increase.
Due to the combining effect of the band bending, band selective rule, and
resonant states, many zero-conductance resonances and resonance peaks appear in
different regions, which could be described by the Fano resonance effect.
Furthermore, the band bending and zero-conductance resonances are robust
against the Hubbard interaction. The Hubbard interaction could work as a
spin-dependent edge field, together with the edge electric fields, leading to a
spin-dependent band gap and various quantum phases such as metal and
half-metal.

Intraatomic orbital hybridization and interatomic bond formation are the two
fundamental processes when real atoms are condensed to form matter. Artificial
atoms mimic real atoms by demonstrating discrete energy levels attributable to
quantum confinement. As such, they offer a solid-state analogue for simulating
intraatomic orbital hybridization and interatomic bond formation. Signatures of
interatomic bond formation has been extensively observed in various artificial
atoms. However, direct evidence of the intraatomic orbital hybridization in the
artificial atoms remains to be experimentally demonstrated. Here we, for the
first time, realize the orbital hybridization in artificial atoms by altering
the shape of the artificial atoms. The anisotropy of the confining potential
gives rise to the hybridization between quasibound states with different
orbital quantum numbers within the artificial atom. These hybridized orbits are
directly visualized in real space in our experiment and are well reproduced by
both numerical calculations and analytical derivations. Our study opens an
avenue for designing artificial matter that cannot be accessed on real atoms
through experiments. Moreover, the results obtained inspire the progressive
control of quantum states in diverse systems.

As an unconventional magnet, altermagnetism attracts great interest in
condensed matter physics and applies a new research platform for the
spintronics. Since the tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) effect is an important
research aspect in spintronics, we theoretically propose a universal
altermagnetic sandwich device to achieve the TMR effect and investigate its
transport properties. Using the nonequilibrium Green's function method and the
Landauer-B\"uttiker formula, we obtain the conductance and the TMR ratio. By
systematically rotating the orientations of the altermagnet and spin, we
investigate how the altermagnetic orientations affect the conductance and the
TMR ratio, and comprehensively demonstrate the dependence of the conductance
and the TMR ratio on a range of parameters in the system. By tuning the
altermagnetism strength and the Fermi energy, as well as rotating the
orientations in the altermagnet, the TMR ratio can reach a value of over 1000%.
In addition, we analyze the detailed symmetry relations of the conductance and
the TMR ratio in our system. Our approach provides a new design concept for the
next-generation information technologies based on the altermagnetic platform,
paving the way for the development of spintronics applications.

Based on the tight-binding formalism, we study the effect of side potential
on the spin and valley related electronic property of $2$D honeycomb lattices
with intrinsic spin-orbit coupling, such as silicene and germanene. The side
potential is composed of potential field and exchange field applied on the
boundaries of the zigzag nanoribbon. It is found that the side potential could
greatly affect the helical edge states with different spin indices and the spin
and valley are locked to each other. By adjusting the side potential and ribbon
width, the system shows quantum spin-valley Hall effect, valley polarized
quantum spin Hall effect, and spin polarized quantum anomalous Hall effect. Due
to the side potential and the coupling of edge states in narrow ribbon, a band
gap could be opened for specific spin and the time-reversal symmetry could be
broken, leading to a spin polarized quantum anomalous Hall phase. Various kinds
of spin-valley polarized edge states are formed at the two boundaries.
Furthermore, the spin-valley polarized insulating states can be used to realize
a perfect spin-valley switch.

Twisted van der Waals (vdW) materials have emerged as a promising platform

moir\'e magnons. We further highlight the ability to accelerate the discovery
and design multifunctional materials for moir\'e spintronics with the

For decades, semiconductors and their heterostructures have underpinned both
fundamental and applied research across all areas of electronics.
Two-dimensional, 2D (atomically thin) semiconductors have now the potential to
push further the miniaturization of electronic components, enabling the
development of more efficient electronics. Here, we report on a giant anomalous
zero-bias spin voltage in magnetic tunnel junctions based on 2D materials. The
generation, manipulation and detection of electron spin across a
nanometer-thick magnetic tunnel junction do not require any applied bias. It is
achieved by exploiting high-quality ferromagnetic/semiconductor interfaces and
the asymmetric diffusion of spin-up/spin-down electrons across a semiconductor
p-n junction. The large spin-voltage signal exceeds 30,000% and is far greater
than the highest magnetoresistance signals reported to date. Our findings
reveal unexplored opportunities to transform and amplify spin information for
low-power electronics.

The detection of fractionally charged quasiparticles, which arise in the
fractional quantum Hall regime, is of fundamental importance for probing their
exotic quantum properties. While electronic interferometers have been central
to probe their statistical properties, their interpretation is often
complicated by bulk-edge interactions. Antidots, potential hills in the quantum
Hall regime, are particularly valuable in this context, as they overcome the
geometric limitations of conventional designs and act as controlled impurities
within a quantum point contact. Furthermore, antidots allow for quasiparticle
charge detection through straightforward conductance measurements, replacing
the need for more demanding techniques. In this work, we employ a gate-defined
bilayer graphene antidot operating in the Coulomb-dominated regime to study
quasiparticle tunneling in both integer and fractional quantum Hall states. We
show that the gate-voltage period and the oscillation slope directly reveal the
charge of tunneling quasiparticles, providing a practical method to measure
fractional charge in graphene. Moreover, we report the first measurement of the
$e/3$ fractional charge in a graphene-based device. The simplicity and
tunability of this design open a pathway to extend AD-based charge measurements
to other van der Waals materials, establishing antidots as a powerful and
broadly applicable platform to study the quantum Hall effect.

this Hamiltonian self-consistently describes exciton spin relaxation in
monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC) due to local electric fields
caused by spatial asymmetries in the dielectric environment. For a monolayer
MoSe$_2$ on a SiO$_2$ substrate above 77\,K showing a meV bright-dark
splitting, the local electric field causes fast intravalley spin relaxation on
a sub-picosecond timescale, whereas it is negligible for other TMDCs with
larger bright-dark splitting.

consists only of extended states. We analyze and illustrate the difference in
the behavior of
  the electron density distribution for extended and local electronic states.
Explicit analytic expressions for the Green's function coefficients of the
pyrene molecule are also presented.

MoS$_2$ monolayers hosted on substrates with nano-structured holes. As the
profiles are spatially bent, the suspended MoS$_2$ monolayers act as exciton

realized by controlling the environmental pressure on the monolayers, which
allows to control hundreds of suspended MoS$_2$ monolayers on a single
substrate. The in-situ read-out is based on Fabry-P\'erot interferences and a
model of the corresponding reflectance contrast maps of the investigated
monolayers.

This paper studies an extended Kitaev chain with three sublattices per unit
cell. This extended version is obtained by hybridizing a modified
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model featuring trimerized unit cells with the standard

the interplay between the sublattice configuration and the $p$-wave
superconducting pairing, a rich structure of edge modes beyond the expected
Majorana zero modes is obtained. The various Majorana edge modes are further
found to demonstrate considerable robustness against some generic perturbations
and disorder. The presence of robust Majorana edge modes beyond their zero
energy variations potentially offers a step forward in the ongoing efforts to
unambiguously detect Majorana modes in experiments.
