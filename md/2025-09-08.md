- **TL;DR**: 研究kagomé梯子中超导状态，发现充电订序和时间反转对称破碎循环流会产生不同的结对对称性，包括s波对密度波和旋性对密度波等

We investigate the superconducting state in a kagom\'e lattice, with
intertwined charge order and time-reversal symmetry-breaking loop current,
using self-consistent Bogoliubov-de Gennes formalism to find the emergent
pairing symmetries. Using local and nearest-neighbor attractive interactions,
treated within Hartree-Fock mean-field approximation, we obtain all possible
pairing symmetries in position space. Our findings indicate that the uniform
$s$-wave symmetry, arising in the absence of the charge order and the loop
current, modifies to a pair density wave of $s$-wave symmetry of 2$\times$2
lattice periodicity in the presence of the charge order, and a chiral pair
density wave of $d_{x^2-y^2}\!+\!id_{xy}$-wave symmetry of the same 2$\times$2
periodicity in the presence of the charge order and loop current order, in both
onsite and nearest-neighbor channels. In the absence of inversion symmetry,
such as in the thin-film geometry, Rashba spin-orbit coupling appears, inducing
an additional nearest-neighbor triplet $p_x\pm ip_y$-wave pairing. The results
are relevant to superconductivity found in $A$V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ ($A$ = K, Rb,
Cs), coexisting with a charge order that breaks time-reversal symmetry. We
discuss fingerprints of these different pairing symmetries in scanning
tunneling microscopy experiments.

We study the subgap transport through a ferromagnet/Ising
superconductor/ferromagnet (F/ISC/F) junction by solving the Bogoliubov-de
Gennes equations. It is found that the crossed Andreev reflection (CAR) and
local Andreev reflection (LAR) strongly depend on the spin polarized F, the
magnetization direction, and the Ising superconducting phase. For the same
magnetization directions of the two F leads, the equal-spin CAR could take
place due to spin-flip mechanism induced by the Ising spin-orbit coupling and
equal-spin-triplet pairing. Both equal-spin CAR and equal-spin LAR exhibit a
remarkable magnetoanisotropy with period \pi and show oscillatory behavior with
chemical potential. The equal-spin CAR is more prominent for half-metal F and
double-band ISC while the normal CAR is completely suppressed. When the
magnetization directions of the two F leads are different, the oblique-spin CAR
occurs and its magnetoanisotropic period generally becomes 2\pi instead of \pi.
In the oblique-spin CAR process, the spins of the electron and hole are neither
parallel nor antiparallel. Furthermore, the property of oblique-spin CAR is
very sensitive to the spin and valley degrees of freedom. The spin and valley
polarized CAR can be achieved and controlled by the chemical potentials and the
magnetization directions.

- **TL;DR**: 通过微波双频技术测量FeSe$_x$Te$_{1-x}$外延电影的磁通流电阻率，揭示了该多带超导体的微观电子状态和清洁度特性。

We measure the flux-flow resistivity in FeSe$_x$Te$_{1-x}$ epitaxial films
using a microwave, dual-frequency technique. The flux-flow resistivity allows
to open a window on the microscopic electronic state of quasiparticles. We
obtain that the field-dependence of flux-flow is typical for multiband
superconductors. Once this is assessed, we are able to extract the temperature
dependence of the orbital upper critical field and of the normalised vortex
core quasiparticle scattering time. Our data suggest that our epitaxial
FeSe$_x$Te$_{1-x}$ films are in the moderately clean regime.

- **TL;DR**: 使用外部式Nb-AlO$_x$-Nb约瑟普梯节连接实现光驱动的约瑟普随意波形合成器(JAWS)电路，展示了数据传输60 Gbit/s的高速性能

We employ externally shunted Nb-AlO$_x$-Nb Josephson junctions for
demonstrating a circuit that is suitable for an optically driven Josephson
Arbitrary Waveform Synthesizer (JAWS). This technology enables overdamped
junctions with characteristic frequencies above 100 GHz and critical currents
of the order of 100 $\mu$A, which is promising, e.g., for low-dissipation
optical control of quantum circuits such as superconducting quantum bits. Here
we utilize a double-pulse technique to experimentally determine the maximum
rate at which optical pulse data can be reliably delivered to the
superconducting circuit. We demonstrate the feasibility of data transfer up to
60 Gbit/s, which is about factor 4 higher than for typical JAWS.

### Deep learning for the semi-classical limit of the Schrödinger equation

- **TL;DR**: 该论文结合神经网络和高斯波包数值求解半经典极限下的薛定谔方程，重点关注小普朗克常数情形下的精确解和多尺度特性算子构建。

In this paper, we integrate neural networks and Gaussian wave packets to
numerically solve the Schr\"odinger equation with a smooth potential near the
semi-classical limit. Our focus is not only on accurately obtaining solutions
when the non-dimensional Planck's constant, $\varepsilon$, is small, but also
on constructing an operator that maps initial values to solutions for the
Schr\"odinger equation with multiscale properties. Using Gaussian wave packets
framework, we first reformulate the Schr\"odinger equation as a system of
ordinary differential equations. For a single initial condition, we solve the
resulting system using PINNs or MscaleDNNs. Numerical simulations indicate that
MscaleDNNs outperform PINNs, improving accuracy by one to two orders of
magnitude. When dealing with a set of initial conditions, we adopt an
operator-learning approach, such as physics-informed DeepONets. Numerical
examples validate the effectiveness of physics-informed DeepONets with Gaussian
wave packets in accurately mapping initial conditions to solutions.

### Dirac quantum criticality in twisted double bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides

- **TL;DR**: 研究ABBA堆叠碹角双双层TMD材料的相图，在空穴填充度ν=2时发现由轻旋角度和压力驱动的连续半金属-绝缘体相变，属于(2+1)D相对论性Gross-Neveu-Heisenberg普遍类

We investigate the phase diagram of moir\'e double bilayer transition metal
dichalcogenides with ABBA stacking as a function of twist angle and applied
pressure. At hole filling $\nu = 2$ per moir\'e unit cell, the noninteracting
system hosts a Dirac semimetal with graphene-like low-energy bands in the
moir\'e Brillouin zone. At small twist angles, the Fermi velocity is reduced
and interactions dominate the low-temperature behavior. A strong-coupling
analysis identifies insulating ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic ground-state
candidates, characterized by spin-density modulations set by the moir\'e scale.
Using a realistic continuum model with long-range Coulomb interactions, we
perform self-consistent Hartree-Fock calculations to study the competition
between these states. Varying the twist angle or pressure drives a transition
from a Dirac semimetal to an antiferromagnetic insulator, which breaks SU(2)
spin rotation and two-fold lattice rotation symmetries. This
semimetal-to-insulator transition is continuous and belongs to the (2+1)D
relativistic Gross-Neveu-Heisenberg universality class with $N = 2$
four-component Dirac fermions. Finite heterostrain, relevant in realistic
samples, induces a crossover from Gross-Neveu-Heisenberg universality at
intermediate temperatures to conventional (2+1)D Heisenberg criticality at the
lowest temperatures. Further decreasing the twist angle can cause a level
crossing from the antiferromagnetic insulator into a ferromagnetic insulator
with spin-split bands. Our results provide a comprehensive theoretical
framework that complements and elucidates recent experiments in twisted double
bilayer WSe$_2$.

### Hierarchical Equations of Motion Solved with the Multiconfigurational Ehrenfest Ansatz

- **TL;DR**: 提出MCE-HEOM方法，将多构型Ehrenfest方法与HEOM结合，显著降低计算复杂度，有效处理强非马尔可夫效应

Being a numerically exact method for the simulation of dynamics in open
quantum systems, the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) still suffers from
the curse of dimensionality. In this study, we propose a novel MCE-HEOM method,
which introduces the multiconfigurational Ehrenfest (MCE) ansatz to the second
quantization formalism of HEOM. Here, the MCE equations of motion are derived
from the time-dependent variational principle in a composed Hilbert-Liouville
space, and each MCE coherent-state basis can be regarded as having an infinite
hierarchical tier, such that the truncation tier of auxiliary density operators
in MCE-HEOM can also be considered to be infinite. As demonstrated in a series
of representative spin-boson models, our MCE-HEOM significantly reduces the
number of variational parameters and could efficiently handle the strong
non-Markovian effect, which is difficult for conventional HEOM due to the
requirement of a very deep truncation tier. Compared with MCE, MCE-HEOM reduces
the number of effective bath modes and circumvents the initial samplings for
finite temperature, eventually resulting in a huge reduction of computational
cost.

### Domain coarsening in fractonic systems: a cascade of critical exponents

- **TL;DR**: 研究多极矩守恒下的畴生长动力学，发现高阶矩守恒导致异常缓慢的生长行为，揭示了新的非平衡普适性类别

We study the dynamics of domain growth when multipole moments of the order
parameter are conserved. Following a quench into the ordered phase of the Ising
model, the typical size of domains grows with time as $R(t) \sim t^{1/2}$ in
the absence of conserved quantities. When the order parameter is conserved, the
domain growth slows to $R(t) \sim t^{1/3}$. Conservation of higher moments of
the order parameter fundamentally modifies this behavior: coarsening proceeds
via anomalously slow growth. We analytically and numerically show that
conservation of the $m$-th multipole moment causes domains to grow as $R(t)
\sim t^{1/(2m+3)}$. This cascade of dynamical critical exponents characterizes
a new family of non-equilibrium universality classes for fractonic systems.

### Symmetric entanglers for non-invertible SPT phases

- **TL;DR**: 本文证明非可逆对称性保护的拓扑相（SPT）可以通过对称纠缠器连接，特别是在1+1维系统中当非可逆对称性具有固定电荷对偶性时。

It has been suggested that non-invertible symmetry protected topological
phases (SPT), due to the lack of a stacking structure, do not have symmetric
entanglers (globally symmetric finite-depth quantum circuits) connecting them.
Using topological holography, we argue that a symmetric entangler should in
fact exist for $1+1$d systems whenever the non-invertible symmetry has SPT
phases connected by fixed-charge dualities (FCD). Moreover, we construct an
explicit example of a symmetric entangler for the two SPT phases with
$\mathrm{Rep}(A_4)$-symmetry, as a matrix product unitary (MPU).

### Non-equilibrium Ion Transport in a Hybrid Battery Material

Hybrid materials, which combine inorganic and molecular components, often
exhibit structural flexibility that enables unusual functional responses. Among
them, Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) are a promising class for post-lithium
battery technologies. Here, we show that non-equilibrium transformation
processes govern the charge-storage mechanism of a PBA electrode,
K2Mn[Fe(CN)6]. Ostensibly, this behavior mirrors that observed in high-rate
cycling of conventional cathodes such as LiFePO4, yet arises here for
fundamentally different reasons -- namely, low elastic moduli and cooperative
distortions inherent to the hybrid framework. Using \emph{operando} methods, we
show that framework flexibility limits transport kinetics and promotes
collective, metastable pathways. Our results highlight new directions for PBA
cathode optimisation, but also suggest a broader relevance of non-equilibrium
mechanisms for mass transport in hybrid materials beyond PBAs alone.

We use resonant X-ray scattering at the nickel L$_{2,3}$ edges to investigate
the interplay between orbital degrees of freedom and charge density waves (CDW)
in the superconductor BaNi$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$. Both the incommensurate
and commensurate CDWs in this system exhibit strong resonant enhancement with
distinct energy and polarization dependencies, indicative of orbital ordering.
Azimuthal-angle-dependent measurements reveal a lowering of the local Ni site
symmetry, consistent with monoclinic or lower point group symmetry. The
scattering signatures of both CDWs are dominated by contributions from Ni
d$_{xz,yz}$ orbitals, with similar orbital character despite their distinct
wave vectors. These findings point to a shared orbital-driven formation
mechanism and provide new insight into the symmetry breaking and
orbital/nematic fluctuations in the high-temperature regime of the
superconductor BaNi$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种计算多个非经典等离子体纳米球光散射的方法，支持多(非)同心介电或金属层结构，使用三种介观模型描述金属电子响应，并通过数值验证和物理检查证实了方法的准确性。

A computational method for the scattering of light by multiple nonclassical
plasmonic nanospheres, each of which has multiple (non-)concentric dielectric
or metallic layers, is presented. The electromagnetic (EM) response of the free
electrons in the metals is described by three popular mesoscopic models: the
nonlocal hydrodynamic Drude model (NLHDM) and its diffusive variant, namely the
generalized nonlocal optical response (GNOR) model, as well as the surface
response model (SRM). The main equation behind the method is set up by
detailing the evaluation of the S-matrix for each individual spherical
interface and the interactions amongst the interfaces. The algorithm is
numerically validated by comparing with an in-house boundary element method
(BEM) solver for a spherical NP with two smaller embedded spheres, and
physically checked on a trimer configuration, where the responses from the
NLHDM and SRM are contrasted with the local response model (LRM). In both cases
a very good agreement is seen regarding frequency shifts and field
enhancements.

Graphene has emerged as a paradigmatic material in condensed matter physics
due to its exceptional electronic, mechanical, and thermal properties. A deep
understanding of its thermoelectric transport behavior is crucial for the
development of novel nanoelectronic and energy-harvesting devices. In this
work, we investigate the thermoelectric transport properties of monolayer
graphene subjected to randomly distributed localized strain fields, which
locally induce impurity-like perturbations. These strain-induced impurities are
modeled via 2D Dirac oscillators, capturing the coupling between
pseudorelativistic charge carriers and localized distortions in the lattice.
Employing the semiclassical Boltzmann transport formalism, we compute the
relaxation time using a scattering approach tailored to the Dirac oscillator
potential. From this framework, we derive analytical expressions for the
electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, and thermal conductivity. The
temperature dependence of the scattering centers density is also investigated.
Our results reveal how strain modulates transport coefficients, highlighting
the interplay between mechanical deformations and thermoelectric performance in
graphene. This study provides a theoretical foundation for strain engineering
in thermoelectric graphene-based devices.

Nickel/zinc (Ni/Zn) technology is a promising post-lithium battery type for
stationary applications with respect to aspects such as safety, environmental
compatibility and resource availability. Although this battery type has been
known for a long time, the theoretical knowledge about the processes taking
place in the battery is limited. In order to gain a deeper understanding of the
general cycling behaviour and the underlying processes, but also specific
phenomena intrinsic to zinc-based cells such as zinc shape change, we carry out
simulations based on a thermodynamically consistent and volume-averaged
continuum model. We use a Ni/Zn prototype cell as a reference framework to
provide a basis for modelling, parameter estimation and systematic comparison
between simulated and experimental cell behaviour to improve cyclability and
performance.

### Exploring the variational method for thermodynamic models

This work explores the possibilities of the Gibbs-Bogoliubov-Feynman
variational method, aiming at finding room for designing various drawing
schemes. For example, mean-field approximation can be viewed as a result of
using site-independent drawing in the variational method. In subsequent
sections, progressively complex drawing procedures are presented, starting from
site-independent drawing in the $k$-space. In the next, each site in the
real-space is again drawn independently, which is followed by an adjustable
linear transformation $T$. Both approaches are presented on the discrete
Ginzburg-Landau model. Subsequently, a percolation-based procedure for the
Ising model is developed. It shows a general way of handling multi-stage
drawing schemes. Critical inverse temperatures are obtained in two and three
dimensions with a few percent discrepancy from exact values. Finally, it is
shown that results in the style of the real-space renormalization group can be
achieved by suitable fractal-like drawing. This facilitates a new
straight-forward approach to establishing the renormalization transformation,
but primarily provides a new view on the method. While the first two approaches
are capable of capturing long-range correlations, they are not able to
reproduce the critical behavior accurately. The main findings of the paper are
developing the method of handling intricate drawing procedures and identifying
the need of fractality in these schemes to grasp the critical behavior.

- **TL;DR**: Error

Applying angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and density functional
theory calculations, we present compelling spectroscopic evidence demonstrating
the intertwining and mutual interaction between the Kondo and kagome
sublattices in heavy-fermion intermetallic compound YbV$_6$Sn$_6$. We reveal
the Yb 4$f$-derived states near the Fermi level, along with the presence of
bulk kagome bands and topological surface states. We unveil strong interactions
between the 4$f$ and itinerant electrons, where the kagome bands hosting the
Dirac fermions and van Hove singularities predominate. Such findings are well
described using a $c$-$f$ hybridization model. On the other hand, our
systematic characterization of magnetic properties demonstrates an unusually
enhanced antiferromagnetic ordering, where the kagome-derived van Hove
singularities near $E_F$ play a vital role in determining the unconventional
nature of the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interaction and Kondo coupling.
These unique kagome-state-mediated exchange interactions have never been
reported before and could lead to a novel phase diagram and various quantum
critical behaviors in YbV$_6$Sn$_6$ and its siblings. Our results not only
expand the family of exotic quantum phases entangled with kagome structure to
the strongly correlated regime, but also establish YbV$_6$Sn$_6$ as an
unprecedented platform to explore unconventional many-body physics beyond the
standard Kondo picture.

- **TL;DR**: 研究无机反钙钛矿氮化物X3NSb（X=Ca,Sr,Ba）中X位阳离子取代对非辐射电子-空穴复合的影响，发现Sr3NSb具有最长的载流子寿命

Inorganic antiperovskite nitrides have recently emerged as promising
materials for photovoltaic applications, yet their nonradiative recombination
dynamics remain largely unexplored. Here, we examine the influence of X-site
cation substitution on the nonradiative electron-hole recombination in
$\mathrm{X_{3}NSb}$ ($X = \mathrm{Ca}, \mathrm{Sr}, \mathrm{Ba}$). Ca- and
Sr-based compounds adopt a cubic phase, whereas Ba stabilizes in a hexagonal
structure, introducing pronounced symmetry-driven effects. Substituting Ca with
Sr narrows the band gap, suppresses octahedral and band-edge fluctuations,
reduces nonadiabatic (NA) coupling by $\sim 54\%$, and extends carrier
lifetimes by a factor of $2.5$. In contrast, Ba substitution increases lattice
distortion, widens the band gap, and enhances NA coupling beyond that of
$\mathrm{Sr_{3}NSb}$, thereby accelerating recombination through stronger
lattice fluctuations. The resulting band gap fluctuations in
$\mathrm{Ba_{3}NSb}$ also shorten decoherence times, following the trend
$\mathrm{Ba_{3}NSb} &lt; \mathrm{Ca_{3}NSb} &lt; \mathrm{Sr_{3}NSb}$. Our results
demonstrate how the interplay between band gap, NA coupling, and decoherence
time governs recombination lifetimes, with $\mathrm{Sr_{3}NSb}$ exhibiting the
longest lifetime. These findings highlight the coupled influence of cation
chemistry and crystal symmetry in tailoring carrier dynamics for

The comment (arXiv:2505.23490) fails to identify any scientific errors and
its central arguments actually support the main conclusions of our publication
[Nat. Phys. 21, 708 (2025)]. Firstly, the whole argument of the comment to try
to explain our data explicitly relies on the existence of a large crossed
Andreev reflection (CAR) effect. The presence of a sizable CAR transmission
probability over a surprisingly long distance is the first conclusion of our
publication. Secondly, the comment discusses the complex interplay of CAR and
elastic co-tunneling, especially in the presence of local effects. This complex
interplay is precisely the second conclusion of our publication. In essence,
the comment amounts to merely pointing out that there is a broader sense in the
notion of "dominant CAR" when nonlinear effects become relevant.

- **TL;DR**: 高阶张量机器学习汉密顿量方法Hot-Ham，通过局部坐标变换和Gaunt张量积技术，大幅提高E(3)等变消息传递神经网络的效率和性能

The combinations of machine learning with ab initio methods have attracted
much attention for their potential to resolve the accuracy-efficiency dilemma
and facilitate calculations for large-scale systems. Recently, equivariant
message passing neural networks (MPNNs) that explicitly incorporate symmetry
constraints have demonstrated promise for interatomic potential and density
functional theory (DFT) Hamiltonian predictions. However, the high-order
tensors used to represent node and edge information are coupled through the
Clebsch-Gordan tensor product (CGTP), leading to steep increases in
computational complexity and seriously hindering the performance of equivariant
MPNNs. Here, we develop High-order Tensor machine-learning Hamiltonian
(Hot-Ham), an E(3) equivariant MPNN framework that combines two advanced
technologies local coordinate transformation and Gaunt tensor product (GTP) to
efficiently model DFT Hamiltonians. These two innovations significantly reduce
the complexity of tensor products from O(L^6) to O(L^3) or O(L^2 log^2 L) for
the max tensor order L, and enhance the performance of MPNNs. Benchmarks on
several public datasets demonstrate its state-of-the-art accuracy with
relatively few parameters, and the applications to multilayer twisted moir\'e
systems, heterostructures and allotropes showcase its generalization ability
and high efficiency. Our Hot-Ham method provides a new perspective for
developing efficient equivariant neural networks and would be a promising
approach for investigating the electronic properties of large-scale materials
systems.

### Cone-dependent retro and specular Andreev reflections in AA-stacked bilayer graphene

We theoretically study the Andreev reflection (AR) in AA-stacked bilayer
graphene/superconductor (AABG/SC) junction. AABG has a linear gapless energy
band with two shifted Dirac cones and the electronic states are described by
the cone indices. The results indicate that the property of AR strongly depends
on the cone degree of freedom. In the absence of the inter-layer potential
difference, only intra-cone AR and normal reflection (NR) could occur, and the
inter-cone process is forbidden. By adjusting the potential, the intra-cone AR
can be specular AR (SAR) in one cone and it is retro-AR (RAR) in the other
cone. The existence of the inter-layer potential difference would lead to the
inter-cone scattering. As a result, double ARs and double NRs can take place
between the two cones. The inter-cone SAR could happen in a broad potential
region. Furthermore, the inter-cone retro-NR (RNR) could happen as well. The
switch between SAR and RAR, and the switch between specular NR (SNR) and RNR
can be achieved by regulating the potential. Therefore, different cone carriers
can be separated spatially based on the RAR and SAR. The cone-dependent Andreev
conductance may be separately measured near the critical values where RAR
crosses over to SAR.

### Kinetics of Barrier Crossing Events from Temperature Accelerated Sliced Sampling Simulations

- **TL;DR**: 本文扩展了温度加速切片采样(TASS)方法，提出了从高维自由能数据中计算能垒跨越事件速率常数的协议，通过神经网络表示自由能面和Infrequent Metadynamics方法恢复动力学信息。

Temperature-accelerated sliced sampling (TASS) is a well-established enhanced
sampling method that facilitates exhaustive exploration of high-dimensional
collective variable (CV) space through directed sampling employing a
combination of umbrella restraining biases, metadynamics biases, and
temperature acceleration of CVs. In this work, we broaden the applicability of
TASS by introducing a protocol for computing rate constants of barrier crossing
events. The challenge addressed here is to recover kinetics from free energy
data computed from different slices of the TASS simulation. The proposed
protocol utilizes artificial neural networks based representation of
high-dimensional free energy landscapes, and Infrequent Metadynamics. We
demonstrate the accuracy of the approach by obtaining rate constants for the
conformational change of alanine dipeptide in vacuo, the unbinding of
benzamidine from trypsin, and the unbinding of aspirin from
$\beta$-cyclodextrin.

### Stochastic processes with multiple temporal scales: timescale separation and information

- **TL;DR**: 这篇论文提出了一种通用的时间尺度分离方法，用于分析多重时间尺度耦合的随机微分方程，揭示了多尺度结构对系统信息产生和传播的重要影响。

Complex systems are often characterized by the interplay of multiple
interconnected dynamical processes operating across a range of temporal scales.
This phenomenon is widespread in both biological and artificial scenarios,
making it crucial to understand how such multiscale dynamics influence the
overall functioning and behavior of these systems. Here, we present a general
timescale separation approach that is valid for any set of stochastic
differential equations coupled across multiple timescales. We show two
alternative derivations, one based on an iterative procedure, and the other
grounded on an a priori expansion in relevant small parameters associated with
faster timescales. We provide an explicit expression for the conditional
structure of the joint probability distribution of the whole set of processes
that is solely determined by the multiscale interactions. This result has
important consequences in determining how information is generated in the
system and how it propagates across different timescales. To demonstrate that
our findings are valid independently of the specific dynamical model, we test
them against four different (linear and non-linear) dynamics. Then, we focus on
the scenario in which two degrees of freedom are reciprocally coupled across
their timescales. In this case, we show that the statistics of the fastest
dynamics is captured by an effective self-interaction term in the slowest one,
creating a regulatory loop. Finally, a connection with analogous previous
results obtained for discrete-state systems with higher-order interactions is
drawn, elucidating similarities and differences in the physical interpretation
of the system. The presented framework might open the avenue for a clearer
understanding of the interplay between the underlying multiscale structure and
emergent functional behavior of biological and artificial systems.

### $^{51}$V NMR evidence for interlayer-modulated charge order and a first-order low-temperature transition in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$

- **TL;DR**: 本文使用51V NMR技术研究了kagome超导体CsV3Sb5中的电荷有序态，揭示了其三维电荷密度波(CDW)的堆叠结构和中间温度相变的一级相变特征。

Charge order in the kagome superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ exhibits a complex
three-dimensional organization and intermediate-temperature anomalies whose
bulk character has remained unsettled. We use orientation-dependent $^{51}$V
NMR as a site-selective probe to determine the stacking of the charge density
wave (CDW) state and its thermal evolution. Below
$T_{\mathrm{CDW}}\!\approx\!94$~K, the field-linear splitting of the $^{51}$V
central transition together with the anisotropy of the Knight-shift tensor
identify an interlayer-modulated $3\mathbf{q}$ CDW whose local environments are
consistent with a four-layer $2\times2\times4$ stacking with mixed
trihexagonal/Star-of-David distortions, in agreement with synchrotron x-ray
determinations. For comparison, RbV$_3$Sb$_5$ serves as a reference exhibiting
a uniform trihexagonal $2\times2\times2$ stacking, allowing us to isolate
features unique to the $2\times2\times4$ state in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. With
$\mathbf{H}_0\!\parallel\!c$, the $^{51}$V quadrupolar satellites through the
intermediate temperature scale near $T_{\mathrm{CO}}\!\approx\!65$ K reorganize
into two well-resolved electric-field-gradient manifolds that coexist over a
finite interval; their relative spectral weights interchange on cooling while
the total integrated satellite intensity remains conserved and $\nu_Q$ within
each manifold is nearly temperature independent. The coexistence without
critical broadening, together with conserved intensity, provides bulk evidence
consistent with a first-order charge-order transition near $T_{\mathrm{CO}}$.
Our measurements do not resolve whether this lower-temperature transition
corresponds to a distinct in-plane order or a reorganization of the
$3\mathbf{q}$ state; rather, they delimit this window and provide bulk,
site-resolved constraints that connect prior reported anomalies to a
thermodynamic first-order transition.

- **TL;DR**: 研究发现MoS2在氮化原子取代反应中的化学活性随层数减少而降低，单层MoS2反应性最低，这归因于Mo原子重排形成热力学稳定MoN相所需的高能量成本。

Two-dimensional (2D) materials offer a valuable platform for manipulating and
studying chemical reactions at atomic level, owing to the ease of controlling
their microscopic structure at the nanometer scale. While extensive research
has been conducted on the structure-dependent chemical activity of 2D
materials, the influence of structural transformation during the reaction
remains largely unexplored. In this work, we report the layer-dependent
chemical reactivity of MoS2 during a nitridation atomic substitution reaction
and attribute it to the rearrangement of Mo atoms. Our results show that the
chemical reactivity of MoS2 decreases as the number of layers is reduced in the
few-layer regime. In particular, monolayer MoS2 exhibits significantly lower
reactivity compared to its few-layer and multilayer counterparts.
Atomic-resolution transmission electron microscope (TEM) reveals that MoN
nanonetworks form as reaction products from monolayer and bilayer MoS2, with
the continuity of the MoN crystals increasing with layer number, consistent
with the local conductivity mapping data. The layer-dependent reactivity is
attributed to the relative stability of the hypothetically formed MoN phase
which retain the number of Mo atomic layers present in the precursor.
Specifically, the low chemical reactivity of monolayer MoS2 is attributed to
the high energy cost associated with Mo atom diffusion and migration necessary
to form multi-layer Mo lattices in the thermodynamically stable MoN phase. This
study underscores the critical role of lattice rearrangement in governing
chemical reactivity and highlights the potential of 2D materials as versatile
platforms for advancing the understanding of materials chemistry at atomic
scale.

Boltzmann method. Populations are projected onto a discontinuous piecewise
linear basis and streamed using an exact geometrical mapping. The method is

operation. A convergence rate of $\geq2$ is achieved, indicating improved
accuracy over precursor methods. For flow around a 2D airfoil, the method
yields better lift and drag predictions.

We give a review on Poor Man's Majorana (PMM) modes, which are theoretically
established in the minimal Kitaev chain implementation consisting of two
grounded, spinless quantum dots (QDs) operating at the sweet spot condition,
where electron cotunneling and crossed Andreev reflection amplitudes achieve
precise balance. Particularly, we systematically review, within the Green's
functions theoretical framework, the PMM hybridization dynamics under
spin-exchange perturbations proposed by some of us in J. Phys.: Condens. Matter
37, 205601 (2025), which demonstrates a characteristic spatial delocalization
when subjected to an exchange coupling $J$ mediated by a quantum spin $S$. This
spin-exchange induced PMM spillover effect provides a spectroscopic protocol
for determining the quantum statistics of $S$ through the emergent multi-level
structure in the proximal QD's density of states. Our principal theoretical
result establishes that the exchange interaction generates $2S+2$ ($2S+1$)
satellite states symmetrically distributed about the zero-bias anomaly, serving
as a definitive signature of bosonic (fermionic) spin statistics. As novelty,
we demonstrate that multi-terminal environmental coupling induces significant
suppression of the spin-exchange spillover mechanism. Under constrained
variations of $J$, this effectively localizes the perturbed PMM within its host
QD, preventing spatial hybridization with adjacent site. The absence of
topological protection in this minimal Kitaev realization is strategically
leveraged to: (i) Develop a novel spectroscopic technique for quantum spin
characterization through PMM hybridization signatures; (ii) Propose an
engineered protection scheme for PMM qubits against exchange fluctuations in
multi-terminal architectures, enabling moderately robust quantum computation
protocols.

### Analysis of fourth-, fifth-, and infinite-order triple excitations in unitary coupled cluster theory

In this work, we introduce a correction to the unitary coupled cluster method
with single and double excitations (UCCSD) that incorporates the effects of
missing triple excitations through a treatment that is correct through
fifth-order in many-body perturbation theory (MBPT), which we refer to as
UCCSD[T-5]. We then benchmark the performance of UCCSD[T-5] alongside the
previously developed fourth-order UCCSD[T], comparing both against the
infinite-order treatment of triples in UCCSDT as well as full configuration
interaction (FCI). Two key findings emerge from this analysis. First, the
fourth-order correction in UCCSD[T] consistently provides the closest agreement
with FCI in estimating ground state energies, outperforming both UCCSD[T-5] and
UCCSDT. Second, the inclusion of fifth-order corrections as in UCCSD[T-5]
largely recovers the infinite-order triples limit in UCCSDT. With the growing
interest in UCC ans\"atze for quantum computing and the constraints imposed by
current quantum hardware, these results underscore the potential of using
classically computed perturbative corrections within UCC theory to salient
triple excitation effects without requiring the additional quantum resources as
would be demanded by the UCCSDT ansatz.

### Cheaper access to universal fluctuations in integrable spin chains from boundary effects

Observing super-diffusive fluctuations from Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ)
universality in isotropic integrable spin chains is usually challenging as it
requires a fairly large number of spins in interaction. We demonstrate in this
paper, in the context of classical spins, that accounting for boundary effects
lowers the bar, down to a few dozen spins in some cases. Additionally,
boundaries control the relaxation to stationarity, which leads to many new
universal scaling functions to explore, both in periodic spin chains and for
open chains with magnetization imposed by reservoirs at the ends.

Anomalous relaxation is one of the hallmarks of disordered systems. Following
perturbation by an external source, many glassy, jammed and amorphous systems
relax as a stretched or compressed exponential as a function of time. However,
despite their ubiquity, the origins of and the connection between these
phenomenological relaxation functions remains to be understood. Here, we
observe a tunable crossover from stretched- to compressed-exponential
relaxation by photoexciting single crystal Ca3Ru2O7 across a structural phase
transition. We present a simple lattice model that shows how spatial
inhomogeneity and local, strain-mediated interactions cooperate to produce the
dynamical crossover. Our work reveals anomalous relaxation dynamics in an
idealized single crystal material and establishes photoexcited solids as
promising platforms for probing the mechanisms underlying anomalous relaxation.

Density functional theory (DFT)-based simulations of materials have
first-principles accuracy, but are very computationally expensive. For
simulating various properties of multi-component alloys, the cluster expansion
(CE) technique has served as the standard workaround to improve computational
efficiency. However, the standard CE technique is difficult to extend to exotic
and/or low-symmetry lattices, often implemented via iteration over particular
cluster types, which must be enumerated per lattice structure. In this work, we
introduce the tensor cluster expansion (TCE), implemented in the open-source
code tce-lib, which maps correlation functions to mixed tensor contractions,
eliminating the need to iterate over cluster types and additionally making the
calculation of correlation functions well-suited for massively parallel
architectures like GPUs. We show that local interaction energies are an
immediate consequence of the TCE formalism, yielding nearly $\mathcal{O}(1)$
energy difference calculations. We then use this formalism to fit CE models for
the TaW and CoNiCrFeMn systems, and use these models to respectively compute
the enthalpy of mixing curve and Cowley short-range order parameters, showing
excellent agreement with ground truth data.

resistive-type and work function based detection mechanisms, we evaluate
interactions with ten hazardous gases (NH3, NO, NO2, SO2, CS2, H2S, HCN, CCl2O,
CH2O, CO) as well as ambient molecules (O2, CO2, H2O). The monolayer shows
pronounced sensitivity towards NO and H2S, and work function modulation enables
detection of NH3 and HCN. Mechanical strain further broadens detection
capability, enhancing adsorption and selectivity. These results establish 2D
In2O3 as a tunable platform for next-generation miniaturized gas sensors for
environmental monitoring and safety applications.

### Universal Boundary-Modes Localization from Quantum Metric Length

The presence of localized boundary modes is an unambiguous hallmark of
topological quantum matter. While these modes are typically protected by
topological invariants such as the Chern number, here we demonstrate that the
{\it quantum metric length} (QML), a quantity inherent in multi-band
topological systems, governs the spatial extent of flat-band topological
boundary modes. We introduce a framework for constructing topological flat
bands from degenerate manifolds with large quantum metric and find that the
boundary modes exhibit dual phases of spatial behaviors: a conventional
oscillatory decay arising from bare band dispersion, followed by another
exponential decay controlled by quantum geometry. Crucially, the QML, derived
from the quantum metric of the degenerate manifolds, sets a lower bound on the
spatial spread of boundary states in the flat-band limit. Applying our
framework to concrete models, we validate the universal role of the QML in
shaping the long-range behavior of topological boundary modes. Furthermore, by
tuning the QML, we unveil extraordinary non-local transport phenomena,
including QML-shaped quantum Hall plateaus and anomalous Fraunhofer patterns.
Our theoretical framework paves the way for engineering boundary-modes
localization in topological flat-band systems.

### A computationally efficient subspace harmonic relaxation algorithm for coarse-graining of molecular systems with nearly exact thermodynamic consistency

In a recent paper, J. Chem. Phys. 162, 214101 (2025), a novel approach for
the rigidification of a molecular cluster was proposed, in which starting with
an all-atom (AA) potential, a coarse-grained (CG) potential for the associated
cluster of rigid monomers was constructed directly. The method is based on
using the harmonic approximation for the fast intramolecular degrees of
freedom. While conceptually primitive, the resulting CG model turned out to be
surprisingly accurate for selected water and ammonia clusters. However, as
originally formulated, a single evaluation of the CG potential turned out to be
much more expensive than the evaluation of the AA potential, since the former
required a subspace minimization followed by a subspace normal mode
calculation. In this communication, we formulate the approach more broadly,
making it applicable, e.g., to coarse-graining a large protein. We also
introduce key algorithmic improvements, reducing the cost of the subspace
minimization and normal mode calculation. Combined with the fact that the CG
simulation requires roughly an order of magnitude fewer Monte Carlo steps to
reach similar statistical accuracy for selected observables compared to the AA
model, the overall computational cost becomes comparable. These improvements
are demonstrated on a water cluster.

### Constraint effective action and critical correlation functions at fixed magnetization

We present an extension of the functional renormalization group (FRG)
framework developed to compute critical probability distributions of the order
parameter to momentum-dependent observables. Focusing on the constraint
effective action at fixed magnetization for the Ising universality class, we
derive its exact flow equations and solve them at the second-order of the
derivative expansion (DE2). We solve these flow equations numerically for two-
and three-dimensional systems, extract universal rate functions and
momentum-dependent correlation functions, and benchmark them against Monte
Carlo simulations. In three dimensions, we recover the rate function and
accurately reproduce the first few Fourier modes of the constrained correlation
function, and demonstrate the convergence of the method. In two dimensions, the
lowest order approximations such as local potential approximation (LPA) fail,
and it is required to consider at least the DE2 to describe the critical point.
Our results are in qualitative agreement with the numerics. We confirm the
robustness of the FRG approach for calculating both zero- and finite-momentum
critical observables at fixed magnetization.

The strong interlayer coupling in black phosphorus (BP), arising from
wavefunction overlap between layers, is critical for understanding its
electronic and optical properties. Here, we utilize terahertz (THz)
spectroscopy to study phonon dynamics in BP. We identify two peaks at 6 and 8.5
meV in steady-state THz spectra, which are attributed to low-frequency
interlayer phonon modes. Both modes exhibit anharmonic phonon coupling behavior
below 150 K, manifesting as temperature-dependent red-shifts. Using
time-resolved THz spectroscopy, we observe significantly increased THz
absorption under photoexcitation, arising from the transient enhancements of
the extended Drude component and the oscillator strengths of interlayer phonons
in non-equilibrium. These findings highlight the critical role of interlayer
phonon dynamics in understanding many-body physics in BP.

In this work, we investigate Vacuum-Packed Particle (VPP) dampers --
granular-core dampers offering tunable damping performance -- as a more
sustainable alternative to conventional systems such as magnetorheological
fluid dampers. A comprehensive computational model of the entire VPP damper
system is developed using the Discrete Element Method (DEM). A novel
discrete-element model of the flexible foil, responsible for consistently
transmitting the external pressure resulting from vacuum application, is
introduced and implemented by extending the open-source Yade DEM framework. A
prototype VPP damper is also designed and experimentally tested, enabling both
model calibration and validation of the simulation results. The calibrated DEM
model is subsequently employed in a parametric study to assess the influence of
material, geometrical, and process parameters on damper performance. All code,
along with the associated experimental and simulation datasets, is made
available in an open-access repository.

To realize the creation of advanced multifunctional materials in energy
storage and conversion technologies, the present research evaluates the
structural, electronic, magnetic, thermodynamic, mechanical, thermoelectric,
piezoelectric and optical properties of pristine and vanadium-doped Co2NiSe4 by
first-principles density functional theory (DFT + U ). It addresses the use of
vanadium substitution to tailor the material, its performance and the inclusion
of diverse fields by changing its electronic structure and its bonding
properties. It can be seen in the results that V doping improves electrical
conductivity and magnetic ordering because of a higher density of states and a
stronger spin polarization at the Fermi level. Thermodynamic calculations show
enhanced entropy stabilization at high temperatures and, mechanical analysis
suggests an enhanced elastic moduli that proves the enhanced structural
integrity without affecting ductility. The thermoelectric properties have been
greatly improved realize an optimal ZT of ~1.1 at 900 K with 5 at.% V doping
owing to an ideal combination of Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity,
and inhibited thermal conductivity. Also, optical analysis reveals that
expanded absorption spectra, increased dielectric response, adjustable
reflectivity and energy loss spectra, optical properties can be used in
photonic, and other optoelectronic devices. Better piezoelectric coefficients
due to its effectiveness when doped also appeal to the usefulness of its
application in nanoscale electromechanical systems. The combination of these
results makes V-doped Co2NiSe4, a versatile material platform of
next-generation energy storage, thermoelectric generation, and novel
multifunctional sensors.

### Continuum Landau surface states in a non-Hermitian Weyl semimetal

- **TL;DR**: 本文研究了非厄米拓扑相表面态中的反常电流机制，发现连续朗道模式介导了非厄米手征反常，这些模式具有空间局域化和连续谱的奇特性质。

The surface states of topological phases, which owe their existence to bulk
topological band invariants, possess many features of deep physical
significance. In some instances, they can be linked to a quantum anomaly: the
violation of a classical symmetry by a field theory through the emergence of a
non-conserved current. This phenomenon was recently generalized to the
non-Hermitian (NH) regime, in the form of an NH chiral anomaly occurring in the
surfaces states of an NH Weyl phase. Here, we show that the anomalous NH
current is mediated by continnum Landau modes (CLMs) an exotic class of NH
eigenstates exhibiting both spatial localization and a continuous spectrum,
contrary to the usual distinction between bound and free states. The conditions
for which CLMs are normalized, and their scaling of localization length with
magnetic field strength, are found to match the requirements of the NH anomaly
equation. We also discuss the conditions under which these surface states can
be probed experimentally, such as on metamaterial platforms. For instance,
under open boundary conditions, the surface states are a mix of CLMs and skin
modes induced by the NH skin effect, but the NH anomaly can be observed through
transmission measurements under different magnetic fields.

We study the effects of nonreciprocity and network structure on percolation.
To this end, we investigate nonreciprocal random networks - directed networks
for which the probability of a link occurring from node i to node j differs
from the probability of the reverse link occurring from node j to node i. We
analytically determine the degree and percolation properties of such networks
with exactly two types of link probability, demonstrating that whether the
networks are structured such that the nodes are not statistically
indistinguishable has profound effects on these measures, both quantitively and
in how such networks need to be approached. In particular, we develop a
technique for solving the percolation problem which can be applied to both
structured and unstructured networks. The method entails writing
self-consistent integral and differential equations for the probability that
each node will belong to the network's giant component. Exact solutions to
these equations are obtained and simulations which confirm our analytic
predictions are presented.

- **TL;DR**: 在kagome网格金属YbCr6Ge6中发现了拒头子平面背与拒头子关联重费米液体的前所未有共存，形成了拒头子-Dirac半金属相，为相关量子物质提供了新平台

Flat bands, emergent in strongly correlated electron systems, stand at the
frontier of condensed matter physics, providing fertile ground for
unconventional quantum phases. Recent observations of dispersionless bands at
the Fermi level in kagome lattice open the possibility of unifying the disjoint
paradigms of topology and correlation-driven heavy fermion liquids. Here, we
report the unprecedented coexistence of these mechanisms in the layered kagome
metal YbCr6Ge6. At high temperatures, an intrinsic kagome flat band-arising
from the frustrated hopping on the kagome lattice-dominates the Fermi level.
Upon cooling, localized Yb 4f-states hybridize with the topological kagome flat
bands, transforming this state into the Kondo resonance states that are nearly
dispersionless across the entire Brillouin zone. Crystalline symmetry forbids
hybridization along specific high-symmetry lines, which stabilizes Dirac
crossings of heavy-fermion character. Topological analysis of the resulting
gaps reveals both trivial and nontrivial Z2 invariants, establishing the
emergence of a Dirac-Kondo semimetal phase. Taken together, these results
identify YbCr6Ge6 as a prototype of a topological heavy-fermion system and a
platform where geometric frustration, strong correlations, and topology
converge, with broad implications for correlated quantum matter.

- **TL;DR**: 表面诱导的对称性破缺在SrAl4和EuAl4中产生了与体相不同的电子序，通过ARPES和STM揭示了面内C4对称性破缺的电子态和表面重构现象

Surface-induced symmetry breaking in quantum materials can stabilize exotic
electronic phases distinct from those in the bulk, yet its momentum-space
manifestations remain elusive due to domain-averaging effects. Here, using
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and scanning tunneling
microscopy (STM), we present a microscopic investigation of the electronic
structures of SrAl4 and EuAl4, layered tetragonal intermetallic compounds that
exhibit well-characterized incommensurate charge-density-wave (CDW)
transitions. Below the CDW transition temperatures, we uncover linearly
dispersing electronic states and pronounced unidirectional replica bands
orthogonal to the bulk CDW wave vector, evidencing the emergence of an in-plane
C4 symmetry-breaking electronic order that is not dictated by the bulk
incommensurate CDW. STM measurements further reveal a 1 times 2 surface
reconstruction with quasi-one-dimensional modulations and half-unit-cell steps,
traced to ordered 50 percent Sr/Eu vacancies, which vanish irreversibly upon
thermal cycling, indicating decoupled surface and bulk orders. These findings
establish SrAl4 and EuAl4 as model platforms for exploring surface-confined
nematicity and emergent low-dimensional phases in quantum materials.

- **TL;DR**: 通过DFT计算研究Eu掺杂对ZnWO4结构和光电性能的影响，发现Eu掺杂能减小带隙、引入局域态、增强光学响应，使其成为w-LEDs的潜在候选材料

Tungstate-based oxides have attracted significant attention owing to their
excellent structural stability, chemical robustness, and versatile optical
properties, making them suitable for next-generation optoelectronic and
phosphor applications. Among these, ZnWO$_4$ has emerged as a promising host
matrix; however, the role of europium (Eu) substitution in modulating its
optoelectronic behavior remains underexplored. In this work, we employ
spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) within the GGA+U framework to
investigate the structural, electronic, and optical properties of pristine
ZnWO$_4$ and Eu-doped ZnWO4 systems. Phonon dispersion analysis confirms
dynamical stability for both pristine and doped structures. Eu doping reduces
the bandgap, introduces new localized states near the Fermi level, and
significantly alters the density of states, thereby enhancing electronic
transitions. The optical response reveals a broadened dielectric function,
red-shifted absorption edge, and intensified extinction coefficient, consistent
with the presence of Eu 4f states. Additionally, reflectivity and energy-loss
spectra indicate improved photon-phonon coupling and optical tunability upon
doping. These findings highlight that Eu incorporation not only stabilizes the
ZnWO$_4$ lattice but also tailors its optoelectronic features, positioning
Eu-doped ZnWO4 as a potential candidate for white-light-emitting diodes
(w-LEDs) and related optoelectronic technologies.

- **TL;DR**: 金属化学界面阻尽效应(CID)的实验分解：包括制造粗糕度和直接充电转移两种机制，通过光谱偏振仪在十磺醇自组装单层覆盖的Au(111)表面进行广港研究

The chemical interface damping (CID) effect increases the collision frequency
of free electrons in metals by changes of the metal surface. We have now
experimentally disentangled the two contributions to CID: induced roughness and
direct charge transfer. The latter is an important area of research in
photoelectrochemistry with potential applications in light-induced chemical
reactions. We present a broadband investigation of the CID effect on Au(111)
covered by a self-assembled monolayer of decanethiol. Spectroscopic
ellipsometry measurements show a photon energy dependent increase of collision
frequency. We observe a constant, photon energy independent contribution, which
is attributed to induced roughness and a contribution that linearly increases
with photon energy from about 1 eV upwards which we attribute to direct charge
transfer. The onset of the charge transfer mechanism corresponds to occupied
orbitals of thiols bound to the Au surface, as confirmed by density functional
theory calculations.

An entropy function is proposed in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 251602] as a way to
detect criticality even when the system size is small. In this note we apply
this strategy in the search for criticality of lattice transfer matrices
constructed based on the topological holographic principle. We find that the
combination of strategy is indeed a cost-effective and efficient way of
identifying critical boundary conditions, estimating central charges and
moreover, plotting entire phase diagrams in a multi-dimensional phase space.

### Active Learning of A Crystal Plasticity Flow Rule From Discrete Dislocation Dynamics Simulations

Continuum-scale material deformation models, such as crystal plasticity, can
significantly enhance their predictive accuracy by incorporating input from
lower-scale (i.e., mesoscale) models. The procedure to generate and extract the
relevant information is however typically complex and ad hoc, involving
decision and intervention by domain experts, leading to long development times.
In this study, we develop a principled approach for calibration of
continuum-scale models using lower scale information by representing a crystal
plasticity flow rule as a Gaussian process model. This representation allows
for efficient parameter space exploration, guided by the uncertainty embedded
in the model through a process known as Bayesian optimization. We demonstrate a
semi-autonomous Bayesian optimization loop which instantiates discrete
dislocation dynamics simulations whose initial conditions are automatically
chosen to optimize the uncertainty of a model crystal plasticity flow rule. Our
self-guided computational pipeline efficiently generated a dataset and
corresponding model whose error, uncertainty, and physical feature
sensitivities were validated with comparison to an independent dataset four
times larger, demonstrating a valuable and efficient active learning
implementation readily transferable to similar material systems.

We study the optical absorption spectra of small Ag_n (n=2,4,6,8) clusters
using the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) formalism with a Hamiltonian built from
GW quasiparticle energies. Calculations are based on an effective core
potential including the 4sp shells in the valence. Non-self-consistent G0W0
calculations relying on input Kohn-Sham eigenstates generated with semilocal
functionals lead to very poor BSE absorption spectra, confirming a previous
observation. However, eigenvalue or quasiparticle self-consistent GW
calculations dramatically improves the agreement with experiments and TD-DFT
spectra obtained with range-separated hybrid functionals. The importance of the
position of the 4d occupied band is emphasized.

We develop a QR-based corner transfer matrix renormalization group (CTMRG)
framework for contracting infinite projected entangled-pair states (iPEPS) on
honeycomb lattices. Our method explicitly uses the lattice's native C3v
symmetry at each site, generalizing QR-based acceleration (previously limited
to square lattices) to enable efficient and stable contractions. This approach
achieves order-of-magnitude speedups over conventional singular value
decomposition (SVD)-based CTMRG while maintaining high numerical precision.
Comprehensive benchmark calculations for the spin-1/2 Heisenberg and Kitaev
models demonstrate higher computational efficiency without sacrificing
accuracy. We further employ our method to study the Kitaev-Heisenberg model,
where we provide numerical evidence for the universal 1/r^4 decay of the
dimer-dimer correlation function within the quantum spin liquid (QSL) phase.
Our work establishes a framework for extending QR-based CTMRG to other lattice
geometries, opening new avenues for studying exotic quantum phases with tensor
networks.

### Enhancement of spin-wave nonreciprocity and group velocity in a low-wavenumber regime

Nonreciprocity of spin waves is essential for components such as magnetic
isolators and circulators used in spin-wave-based computing. A ferromagnetic
(FM) bilayer exhibits significant frequency nonreciprocity and has attracted
attention in recent years. Prior research on bilayers has predominantly focused
on the high-wavenumber regime, where spin waves display significant
nonreciprocity and are accessible through Brillouin light scattering (BLS).
However, the dynamics at low wavenumbers (k &lt; 5 rad/um), which enable rapid
magnon propagation, have yet to be thoroughly investigated. We investigate
spin-wave propagation in the bilayer using coplanar waveguides (CPWs) and
demonstrate that increasing the bilayer thickness enhances nonreciprocity even
at low wavenumbers, which leads to the high group velocity originating from the
Damon-Eshbach (DE) mode. These findings establish design principles for
high-speed, low-loss spin-wave-based information processing.

LiV2O4 is a spinel-structured compound that stands out as the first known
3d-electron system exhibiting typical heavy fermion behavior. A central
question is how such strong mass renormalization emerges in the absence of
f-electrons. In this work, we investigate the three-dimensional electronic
structure of LiV2O4 thin films using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
(ARPES). We identify that an electron-like flat band is derived from a1g
orbitals, along with a highly dispersive e'g band strongly coupled with
phonons. The overall agreement with dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT)
calculations highlights the essential role of inter-orbital Hund's coupling in
reducing the a1g bandwidth to 25 meV, approaching a Mott state. Notably, we
find that heavy-fermion behavior arises from additional renormalization at the
a1g band near the Fermi level, likely driven by many-body interactions at
energy scales down to a few meV and potentially linked to geometric frustration
inherent to the spinel lattice. These results provide crucial insights into the
origin of the heavy fermion behavior in 3d-electron systems.

### Dislocation interaction with a tilt low angle grain boundary in bi-crystal SrTiO3

For potentially wider applications of ceramics with dislocation-tuned
mechanical and functional properties, it is pertinent to achieve dislocation
engineering in polycrystalline ceramics. However, grain boundaries (GBs) in
general are effective barriers for dislocation glide and often result in crack
formation when plastic deformation in ceramics is attempted at room
temperature. To develop strategies for crack suppression, it is critical to
understand the fundamental processes for dislocation-GB interaction. For this
purpose, we adopt here a model system of bi-crystal SrTiO3 with a 4{\deg} tilt
GB, which consists of an array of edge dislocations. Room-temperature Brinell
indentation was used to generate a plastic zone at the mesoscale without crack
formation, allowing for direct assessment of GB-dislocation interaction in bulk
samples. Together with dislocation etch pits imaging and transmission electron
microscopy analysis, we observe dislocation pileup, storage, and transmission
across the low-angle tilt GB. Our experimental observations reveal new insight
into dislocation-GB interaction at room temperature at the mesoscale.

Spin dynamics in the natural mineral aegirine, NaFeSi$_2$O$_6$, a member of
the pyroxene family, was studied by elastic and inelastic neutron scattering.
Magnetization and specific heat measurements as well as single-crystal neutron
diffraction maps, taken in the temperature range 2 - 20 K, confirm two
successive magnetic transitions at 8.8 and 5.8 K, consistent with previous
studies. The observed spin-wave excitations emerge from the incommensurate
magnetic Bragg peaks corresponding to the propagation vector $k_{\rm ICM} = (0,
0.77, 0)$, and extend up to energies of about 1.5 meV. In the low-temperature
helical phase, the spin dynamics of the Fe$^{3+}$ ions is well described by a
simple linear spin-wave model. The observed excitations can be modeled using a
spin Hamiltonian that includes three primary exchange interactions - intrachain
coupling $J=0.142(2)$ meV, interchain couplings $J_1=0.083(1)$ meV and
$J_2=0.186(1)$ meV - and an easy-plane anisotropy $D=0.020(6)$ meV. Our results
show that no single exchange interaction dominates the spin dynamics. The
similar strengths of the intrachain and interchain couplings point to the fact
that the magnetic interactions in aegirine are three-dimensional rather than
confined along one direction. As a result, the system cannot be considered
quasi-one-dimensional, as previously suggested, and calls for further
investigations.

Dislocations control the mechanical behavior of crystalline materials, yet
their quantitative characterization in bulk has remained elusive. Transmission
Electron Microscopy provides atomic-scale resolution but is restricted to thin
foils, limiting relevance to structural performance. Dark-field X-ray
microscopy (DFXM) has recently opened access to three-dimensional,
non-destructive imaging of dislocations in macroscopic crystals. A critical
bottleneck, however, is the reliable identification of weak- versus strong-beam
conditions. Weak-beam imaging enhances dislocation contrast, while strong-beam
conditions are dominated by multiple scattering and obscure interpretation.
Current practice depends on manual classification by specialists, which is
subjective, slow, and incompatible with the scale of modern experiments. Here,
we introduce a deep learning framework that automates this task using a
lightweight convolutional neural network trained on small, hand-labeled
datasets. By enabling robust, rapid, and scalable identification of imaging
conditions, this approach transforms DFXM into a high-throughput tool,
unlocking statistically significant studies of dislocation dynamics in bulk
materials.

- **TL;DR**: 通过分析计算和实验研究，证明了在YIG/Py双层系统中，磁化颈前进相位由微波光子场力矩和层间交换力矩共同控制，形成了可调控磁光谱的双通道污激发方案。

Multi-channel coupling in hybrid systems makes an attractive testbed not only
because of the distinct advantages entailed in each constituent mode, but also
the opportunity to leverage interference among the various excitation pathways.
Here, via combined analytical calculation and experiment, we demonstrate that
the phase of the magnetization precession at the interface of a coupled yttrium
iron garnet(YIG)/permalloy(Py) bilayer is collectively controlled by the
microwave photon field torque and the interlayer exchange torque, manifesting a
coherent, dual-channel excitation scheme that effectively tunes the
magneto-optic spectrum. The different torque contributions vary with frequency,
external bias field, and types of interlayer coupling between YIG and Py, which
further results in destructive or constructive interferences between the two
excitation channels, and hence, selective suppression or amplification of the
hybridized magnon modes.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究通过多尺度建模方法计算了Nd₃MgNi₁₄合金的氢吸收等温线，结合几何分析、DFT计算和蒙特卡洛模拟，发现混合泛函和零点能修正对准确预测氢吸收性能至关重要。

Intermetallic compounds such as {A$_{2}$B$_{7}$} alloys are promising
candidates for mobile hydrogen storage applications due to their high and
reversible hydrogen absorption capacity. We compute the absorption isotherm of
{Nd$_{3}$MgNi$_{14}$} from first-principles using a multiscale modeling
approach. Absorption sites are identified through a systematic geometrical
analysis, and are characterized with Density Functional Theory (DFT)
calculations. The absorption site properties are used in room-temperature Grand
Canonical Monte Carlo simulations to predict hydrogen uptake as a function of
pressure, leading to a full absorption isotherm in good agreement with
experimental data. We show that both hybrid exchange-correlation functionals
and zero-point energy corrections are necessary to obtain accurate absorption
properties. The analysis of the fully hydrogenated structure with DFT shows
considerable volume expansion, which stabilizes the structure at large hydrogen
content.
