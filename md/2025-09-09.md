- **TL;DR**: 在碳化物Mn3Si2Te6中发现了一种新型的巨大感应现象，该现象来自旋光轨道流域的一阶重构，不需要超导或工程纳米结构

We report the discovery of a new form of inductance in the bulk ferrimagnet
Mn3Si2Te6, which features strong spin-orbit coupling, large magnetic
anisotropy, and pronounced magnetoelastic interactions. Below its Curie
temperature, Mn3Si2Te6 hosts chiral orbital currents (COC) that circulate
within the crystal lattice and give rise to collective electronic behavior [1].
By applying a magnetic field along the hard c axis and driving the system with
low-frequency currents, we uncover a giant inductive response up to millihenry
scale, originating from first-order reconfigurations of COC domains. These
domains act as coherent mesoscopic inductive elements that resist reversal upon
current reduction, producing a large electromotive force and sharply increasing
voltage. This emergent inductance defies classical models, occurs without
superconductivity or engineered nanostructures, and opens a new frontier in
orbital-based quantum functionality and device concepts.

For a certain antiferromagnet, the magnetization does not increase gradually
with increasing magnetic field but exhibits field region(s) typically at an
integer fraction of its saturation magnetization. This phenomenon is understood
by the supposition that such an antiferromagnet undergoes field-induced
partitioning of its spin lattice into ferrimagnetic fragments. We searched for
a theoretical basis for this supposition by investigating how external magnetic
fields affect the magnetic entropy of such an antiferromagnet, to find that the
field region of the magnetization plateau has a single magnetic phase, but a
nonzero slope region of the magnetization curve has two magnetic phases of
different magnetic entropy, and that the magnetic entropy of a single-phase
region does not depend on magnetic field but that of a two-phase region does.
We tested these predictions by carrying out magnetization and specific heat
measurements for g-Mn3(PO4)2. It was found that the magnetic entropy of the
two-phase region increases with field, indicating that field-induced breaking
of magnetic bonds and hence field-induced partitioning of an antiferromagnetic
spin lattice are time-averaged results of all allowed spin arrangements that
occur repeatedly during static magnetization measurements. The
temperature-dependent magnetic specific heats of g-Mn3(PO4)2 between 2 - 6 K
shows a larger excitation gap when measured at 9 T than at 0 T, suggesting that
these energy gaps reflect the two successive local excitations of linear
Mn2+-Mn2+-Mn2+ ferrimagnetic trimers embedded in the antiferromagnetic spin
lattice of g-Mn3(PO4)2 and arise from the Boltzmann factor associated with
these excitations

### Interaction-driven quantum criticality in two-dimensional quadratic band crossing semimetals with time-reversal symmetry breaking

- **TL;DR**: 对二维时间反演对称性破缺的kagome半金属中16种边际相关费米子-费米子相互作用的系统研究，通过重整化群方法识别了多个固定点及其对应的量子临界行为。

We present a systematic investigation of all sixteen marginally relevant
fermion-fermion interactions in two-dimensional time-reversal symmetry-breaking
kagom\'{e} semimetals hosting a quadratic band crossing point. Employing a
momentum-shell renormalization group approach that treats every interaction on
equal footing, we derive energy-dependent flow equations that capture the
hierarchical evolutions of interaction parameters. Our analysis begins by
tracking the energy-dependent flows of fermion-fermion interactions. The
interaction couplings go towards divergence at a critical energy scale,
signaling quantum critical behavior. Such behavior is characterized by a
certain fixed point (FP) whose characteristics depends intimately on structural
parameters $d_{0,1,2,3}$ that cluster the microscopic model into rotationally
symmetric and asymmetric cases. Then, we identify two stable FPs in the
rotationally symmetric and nine additional FPs in asymmetric case dubbed
FP$_{1-10}$. Their boundary conditions are approximately demarcated and
established by linear and plane fitting techniques in the structural parameter
space. Furthermore, we examine distinct interaction-driven instabilities nearby
these FPs by incorporating the relevant external source terms and computing
their susceptibilities. It indicates that the charge density wave and
superconductivity become dominant at FP$_{2,4,5,6,8}$ and FP$_{1,9,10}$, while
the $x$-current and bond density prevail at FP$_3$ and FP$_7$, respectively. In
addition to these leading states, several underlying subordinate instabilities
are presented as well. These results would be helpful to further study the
low-energy critical behavior in 2D kagom\'{e} QBCP and related materials.

### Giant Splitting of Folded Dirac Bands in Kekulé-ordered Graphene with Eu Intercalation

- **TL;DR**: 通过在石墨烯和SiC衬底之间插层Eu原子层实现Kekulé有序石墨烯，发现狄拉克费米子与Eu 4f局域磁矩的强耦合导致巨大的狄拉克能带分裂

Kekul\'{e}-ordered graphene on SiC realized by intercalating two-dimensional
metal layers offers a versatile platform for exploring intriguing quantum
states and phenomena. Here, we achieve the intercalation of
$(\mathrm{\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}})\mathit{R}30^\circ$-ordered Eu layer between
epitaxial graphene and SiC substrate, realizing a Kekul\'{e} graphene with
large local magnetic moments of intercalated Eu atoms. Combining angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and density functional theory (DFT)
calculations, we revealed that the Kekul{\'{e}} order folds the Dirac cones of
graphene from the corners to the Brillouin zone center via intervalley
scattering, forming the replica Dirac bands with gap opening. More
intriguingly, the Dirac fermions in the replica Dirac bands show a strong
exchange coupling with the localized magnetic moments of Eu $4f$ orbitals,
resulting in a giant splitting of the folded Dirac bands. The observation of
strong coupling between Dirac fermions and local magnetic moments of Eu $4f$
electrons via Kekul\'{e} order pave a new way for generating Dirac band
splitting in graphene, advancing the potential applications of
Kekul\'{e}-ordered graphene in spintronics, as well as exploring intriguing
physical properties and correlation states for quantum technology.

- **TL;DR**: 通过考虑磁性邻近效应将非磁-铁磁界面移向手性分子，解释了手性分子-铁磁电极器件中异常高磁阻现象，证明自旋轨道耦合在手性诱导自旋选择性中的基本作用

The issue of anomalous high magnetoresistance, beyond the Julli\`ere model,
observed in nonmagnetic electrode-chiral molecular-ferromagnetic electrode
devices has puzzled the community for a long time. Here, by considering the
magnetic proximity effect which shifts the nonmagnetic-ferromagnetic interface
toward chiral molecules, we show the anomalous high magnetoresistance beyond
the spin polarization in ferromagnetic electrodes even in the very weak
spin-orbit coupling. Our results are in excellent agreement with the
experiments, demonstrating that the spin-orbit coupling plays a fundamental
role in chiral-induced spin selectivity and the magnetic proximity effect can
dramatically enhance the magnetoresistance. These results elucidate the
interaction between chiral molecules and ferromagnetic electrodes and
facilitate the design of chiral-based spintronic devices.

### Causal Multi-fidelity Surrogate Forward and Inverse Models for ICF Implosions

- **TL;DR**: 该论文提出了一种用于惯性约束聚变(ICF)逆问题求解的因果动态多保真度降阶代理模型，通过机器学习优化辐射温度驱动以重现观测到的界面动力学。

Continued progress in inertial confinement fusion (ICF) requires solving
inverse problems relating experimental observations to simulation input
parameters, followed by design optimization. However, such high dimensional
dynamic PDE-constrained optimization problems are extremely challenging or even
intractable. It has been recently shown that inverse problems can be solved by
only considering certain robust features. Here we consider the ICF capsule's
deuterium-tritium (DT) interface, and construct a causal, dynamic,
multifidelity reduced-order surrogate that maps from a time-dependent radiation
temperature drive to the interface's radius and velocity dynamics. The
surrogate targets an ODE embedding of DT interface dynamics, and is constructed
by learning a controller for a base analytical model using low- and
high-fidelity simulation training data with respect to radiation energy group
structure. After demonstrating excellent accuracy of the surrogate interface
model, we use machine learning (ML) models with surrogate-generated data to
solve inverse problems optimizing radiation temperature drive to reproduce
observed interface dynamics. For sparse snapshots in time, the ML model further
characterizes the most informative times at which to sample dynamics.
Altogether we demonstrate how operator learning, causal architectures, and
physical inductive bias can be integrated to accelerate discovery, design, and
diagnostics in high-energy-density systems.

### Emergent collective heat engines from neighborhood-dependent thermal reservoirs

- **TL;DR**: 该论文研究了一类由相互作用单元组成的热机系统，其中每个单元的热库与其周围邻居相关联。系统可映射到随机意见模型，在低温下表现出集体行为，并存在不同类型的相变。

We introduce and analyze a class of heat engines composed of interacting
units, in which the thermal reservoir is associated with the neighborhood
surrounding each unit. These systems can be mapped onto stochastic opinion
models and are characterized by collective behavior at low temperatures, as
well as different types of phase transitions, marked by spontaneous symmetry
breaking and classifications that depend on topology and neighborhood
structure. For the case of contact with two thermal baths, equivalent to each
unit having $k = 4$ nearest neighbors, the system can be tuned to operate at
maximum power without sacrificing efficiency or increasing dissipation. These
quantities are related by the general expression $ \beta_2 {\cal P} \eta_c
=-J_4 \eta \sigma$ when the worksource stems from different interaction
energies. The heat engine placed in contact with more than three reservoirs is
more revealing, showing that the intermediate thermal reservoir can be
conveniently adjusted to achieve the desired compromise between power,
efficiency, and dissipation. The influence of lattice topology (regular and
random-regular networks), as well as the distinct ratios between the
temperatures of the thermal baths, has also been investigated.

### A universal route to chiral Ising superconductivity in monolayer TaS$_2$ and NbSe$_2$

We investigate Ising superconductivity in two archetypal intrinsic
superconductors, monolayer 1H-TaS$_2$ and 1H-NbSe$_2$, in a bottom-up approach.
Using ab initio-based tight-binding parameterizations for the relevant
low-energy d-bands, the screened interaction is evaluated microscopically, in a
scheme including Bloch overlaps. In direct space, the screened potential
displays for both systems long-range Friedel oscillations alternating in sign.
Upon scaling, the oscillation pattern becomes universal, with the periodic
features locked to the lattice. Solving the momentum-resolved gap equations, a
chiral ground state with p-like symmetry is generically found. Due to the
larger Ising spin-orbit coupling, the chiral gap is more anisotropic in TaS$_2$
than in NbSe$_2$. This is reflected in tunneling spectra displaying V-shaped
features for the former, in quantitative agreement with low-temperature
scanning tunneling experiments on TaS$_2$. At the same time, our results
reconcile the apparent discordance with hard gap tunneling spectra reported for
the sibling NbSe$_2$.

### Modifying the Optical Emission of Vanadyl Phthalocyanine via Molecular Self-Assembly on van der Waals Materials

- **TL;DR**: 通过控制VOPc在范德华材料基底上的沉积，可以将其主要光学跃迁移动超过250 meV，实现光学行为的调控

Vanadyl phthalocyanine (VOPc) is a promising organic molecule for
applications in quantum information because of its thermal stability, efficient
processing, and potential as a spin qubit. The deposition of VOPc in different
molecular orientations allows the properties to be customized for integration
into various devices. However, such customization has yet to be fully leveraged
to alter its intrinsic properties, particularly optical emission. Normally,
VOPc films on dielectric substrates emit a broad photoluminescence peak in the
near-infrared range, attributed to transitions in the Pc ring from its pi
orbital structure. In this work, we demonstrate that the dominant optical
transition of VOPc can be shifted by over 250 meV through the controlled
deposition of thin films on van der Waals material substrates. The weak
interactions with van der Waals materials allow the molecules to uniquely
self-assemble, resulting in modified optical behavior modulated by molecular
phase and thickness. This work connects the self-assembling properties of
molecules with their altered electronic structures and the resulting optical
emission.

### Spin-transport characteristics in a Si-based spin metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (spin MOSFET): Bias dependence of the spin polarization in Si and magnetoresistance in spin-valve signals

- **TL;DR**: 研究了自旋MOSFET的自旋输运特性，实现了50%的自旋极化和0.35%的磁阻比，创下了该类型器件的最高记录。通过改进自旋输运模型，发现自旋极化仅由结电压决定，并提出了进一步优化器件性能的方法。

We have studied the spin transport characteristics of a spin
metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (spin MOSFET), particularly
the bias voltage dependence of the electron spin polarization P_S in Si and the
magnetoresistance ratio MR in spin-valve signals, to optimize the device
performance. The spin MOSFET device has an 8-nm-thick p-Si channel with a back
gate (G) and ferromagnetic source / drain (S/D) junctions consisting of
Fe/Mg/MgO/SiOx/n+-Si. In addition to transistor characteristics with an on-off
ratio of 104, clear spin-valve signals and Hanle spin precession signals were
observed at 4 K in a wide range of the source-to-gate V_GS and source-to-drain
V_DS bias voltages. We achieved a high P_S of 50% and a high MR of 0.35% as the
maximum values in their single-peaked curves plotted as a function of the
junction voltage V_J, mainly because the ferromagnetic S/D junction can
generate high P_S and the spin diffusion length is very long in the Si
inversion channel. These P_S and MR values are the highest ever reported in
spin-MOSFETs. Our spin transport model for our spin MOSFET structure was
improved in this study by taking into account the electron distribution and
band profile of the n+-Si regions in the ferromagnetic S/D junctions, which
enables the accurate estimation of P_S. Detailed analyses with various V_GS and
V_J clarified that P_S is determined only by V_J. Our analyses also revealed
that the main parameters for determining MR, such as P_S and the
resistance-area products of the S/D ferromagnetic junctions, have different V_J
dependences, leading to the finding that the present device does not exploit
the full potential of the ferromagnetic S/D junctions to maximize MR. Based on
the results, we discuss the device physics and engineering for further
enhancement of MR, with a focus on the electrical and spin-related properties
of the ferromagnetic S/D junctions.

### Exact many-body wavefunction of the Kondo model with time-dependent interaction strength

We present an exact solution of the nonstationary Schrodinger equation for
the Kondo Hamiltonian with a time-dependent spin-exchange coupling $J(t)$ under
periodic boundary conditions. Unlike previously studied time-dependent
integrable models, which are rooted in the classical Yang-Baxter structure and
associated Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations, our approach is based on the
quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov framework and the quantum Yang-Baxter algebra.
We demonstrate that the dynamics is integrable for a class of exchange
couplings $J(t)$ of the form $\lambda t + p(t) \pm \sqrt{(\lambda t + p(t))^2 +
4/3}$, where $p(t)$ is an arbitrary periodic function, and construct the
corresponding many-body wavefunction. We also discuss extensions to other
one-dimensional integrable models with linear dispersion, such as Gross-Neveu
and Thirring. Our results broaden the domain of time-dependent integrability to
a genuinely quantum class of models and provide a new platform for exploring
coherent nonequilibrium dynamics in strongly correlated systems.

### Exponential convergence of the local diabatic representation for nonadiabatic models

- **TL;DR**: LDR方法在锥形交叉动力学模拟中表现出色，特别是在强振动耦合情况下，相比传统Born-Huang表示和粗绝热表示具有更快的收敛速度。

The discrete variable local diabatic representation (LDR) provides a
divergence-free framework for exact conical intersection dynamics simulation.
In this work, we investigate the convergence with respect to the number of
"nuclear" grid points and "electronic" states of LDR for the eigenvalue
problems using coupled oscillator models. The performance of LDR is compared
with traditional approaches based on the Born-Huang ansatz and on the crude
adiabatic representation. Our results demonstrate that for weak vibronic
couplings, LDR shows similar convergence rate as the exact Born-Huang
representation including not only the first-order derivative couplings but also
the diagonal Born-Oppenheimer corrections and second-order derivative
couplings. Surprisingly, for strong vibronic couplings, LDR shows a significant
faster convergence rate with respect to the number of grid points, hence the
number of electronic structure computations, than the exact Born-Huang
representation. The crude adiabatic representation in generally shows a much
slower convergence rate for all cases. The diagonal Born-Oppenheimer
corrections and second-order derivative couplings are found to be important in
the Born-Huang framework.

The (inverse) magnetostrictive effect in ferromagnets couples the magnetic
properties to the mechanical stress, allowing for an interaction between the
magnetic and mechanical degrees of freedom. In this work, we present a
time-integration scheme for the self-consistent simulation of coupled
magnetoelastic dynamics within the framework of finite-difference
micromagnetism. The proposed implementation extends the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert
equation by a strain-induced effective field and concurrently solves the
elastic equation of motion, while correctly incorporating stress and strain
discontinuities at material interfaces. We then present a comprehensive set of
examples, ranging from static stress configurations over material boundaries to
simulations of surface acoustic wave attenuation in magnetically structured
thin and thick films. These computational experiments both validate the
implementation and underscore the importance of properly handling jump and
boundary conditions in magnon-phonon interaction studies.

- **TL;DR**: 这是一本关于谱方法在复杂系统中应用的实用手册，重点介绍跨学科可用的工具、恒等式和视角，而非定理证明教科书

These notes offer a unified introduction to spectral methods for the study of
complex systems. They are intended as an operative manual rather than a
theorem-proof textbook: the emphasis is on tools, identities, and perspectives
that can be readily applied across disciplines. Beginning with a compendium of
matrix identities and inversion techniques, the text develops the connections
between spectra, dynamics, and structure in finite-dimensional systems.
Applications range from dynamical stability and random walks on networks to
input-output economics, PageRank, epidemic spreading, memristive circuits,
synchronization phenomena, and financial stability. Throughout, the guiding
principle is that eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and resolvent operators provide a
common language linking problems in physics, mathematics, computer science, and
beyond. The presentation is informal, accessible to advanced undergraduates,
yet broad enough to serve as a reference for researchers interested in spectral
approaches to complex systems.

### A Strongly Anisotropic Superconducting Gap in the Kagome Superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$: A Study of Directional Point-Contact Andreev Reflection Spectroscopy

In the recently discovered V-based kagome superconductors AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A =
K, Rb, and Cs), superconductivity is intertwined with an unconventional charge
density wave (CDW) order, raising a fundamental concern on the superconducting
gap structure of such kagome superconductors in the presence of CDW orders.
Here, we report directional soft point-contact Andreev reflection (SPCAR)
spectroscopy measurements on the kagome superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, revealing
compelling evidence for the existence of a strongly anisotropic superconducting
gap pairing state. The SPCAR spectra measured with current injected parallel to
the $ab$-plane exhibit an in-gap single conductance peak, in contrast to those
of SPCAR spectra: a double-peak structure in the perpendicular direction. These
spectra are well described by an anisotropic single-gap BTK model. The
extracted superconducting gaps comprise an isotropic large gap and a strongly
anisotropic gap, originating from different Fermi surface sheets. Quantitative
analysis reveals an anisotropy around $\ sim$70\% with a gap minimum of about
0.15 meV. These results shed new light on the unconventional multiband pairing
states in kagome superconductors.

Designing high-entropy alloys (HEAs) that are both mechanically hard and
possess soft magnetic properties is inherently challenging, as a trade-off is
needed for mechanical and magnetic properties. In this study, we optimize HEA
compositions using a multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) framework to
achieve simultaneous optimal mechanical and magnetic properties. An ensemble
surrogate model is constructed to enhance the accuracy of machine learning
surrogate models, while an efficient sampling strategy combining Monte Carlo
sampling and acquisition function is applied to explore the high-dimensional
compositional space. The implemented MOBO strategy successfully identifies
Pareto-optimal compositions with enhanced mechanical and magnetic properties.
The ensemble model provides robust and reliable predictions, and the sampling
approach reduces the likelihood of entrapment in local optima. Our findings
highlight specific elemental combinations that meet the dual design objectives,
offering guidance for the synthesis of next-generation HEAs.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文定义了Wilson-loop-ideal能带的概念，统一了Chern-ideal和Euler-ideal能带，并提出了构建Z2-ideal能带的方法。通过构造单调流从非理想能带实现理想状态，在扭曲双层MoTe2和moire Rashba模型中成功实现了Chern-ideal和Z2-ideal态。

Quantum geometry is universally bounded from below by Wilson-loop windings.
In this work, we define an isolated set of bands to be Wilson-loop-ideal, if
their quantum metric saturates the Wilson-loop lower bound. The definition
naturally incorporates the known Chern-ideal and Euler-ideal bands, and allows
us to define other types of ideal bands, such as Kane-Mele $Z_2$-ideal bands.
In particular, we find that an isolated set of two $Z_2$-ideal bands with
non-singular nonabelian Berry curvature always admits a Chern-ideal gauge
(i.e., effectively behaving as two decoupled Chern-ideal bands), even in the
absence of any global good quantum number (such as spin). This enables the
direct construction of fractional topological insulator wavefunctions. We
further propose a general framework of constructing monotonic flows that
achieve Wilson-loop-ideal states starting from non-ideal bands through band
mixing, where Wilson-loop-ideal states are not energy eigenstates but have
smooth projectors similar to isolated bands. We apply the constructed flows to
the realistic model of $3.89^\circ$ twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ and a moir\'e
Rashba model, and numerically find Chern-ideal and $Z_2$-ideal states,
respectively, with relative error in the integrated quantum metric below
$5\times 10^{-3}$. Our general definition of Wilson-loop-ideal bands and
general procedure of constructing Wilson-loop-ideal states provide a solid
basis for future study of novel correlated physics.

We study interaction-driven quantum phases in a two-dimensional generalized
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) defined on a square lattice with inequivalent
nearest-neighbor hopping, next-nearest-neighbor hopping and a staggered on-site
potential. In the non-interacting limit, the model hosts either a quadratic
band touching (QBT) at the Brillouin-zone center or symmetry-protected Dirac
nodes, depending on microscopic parameters. In the parameter regime with a QBT,
our self-consistent Hartree-Fock analysis shows that weak to intermediate
interactions can spontaneously break time-reversal symmetry and stabilize a
quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulating phase with a finite Chern number.
Interestingly, this QAH phase is found to weakly break lattice-symmetries,
leading to a small but finite nematic bond order. This is in contrast to the
standard QAH phase in checkerboard lattice, which preserves all lattice
symmetries. Additionally, we find an enhanced bond-nematic Dirac semimetallic
(BNDS) phase due to asymmetric hopping, which is thought to be absent in the
Hartree-Fock approach. In the parameter regimes where QBT splits into two Dirac
nodes, the QAH phase survives up to a finite staggered on-site potential.
However, as the staggered potential increases, the QAH phase is suppressed
while the BNDS phase grows stronger.

Excited-state gradients and derivative couplings are critical for simulating
excited-state dynamics. However, their calculations are very expensive within
the coupled-cluster framework due to the steep scaling. In this work, we
present two implementations of stochastic resolution of identity to CC2
(sRI-CC2) for excited-state analytical gradients and derivative couplings. The
first method employs sRI for both Coulomb and exchange terms, reducing the
formal scaling to cubic. However, this method has a significant stochastic
noise. Consequently, we introduce a substitute, termed partial sRI-CC2, which
applies sRI selectively to the exchange terms only. The partial sRI-CC2 shows a
quartic scaling with a modest prefactor, rendering it a practical alternative.
Compared to conventional RI-CC2, the partial sRI-CC2 can handle systems with
hundreds or even thousands of electrons. This work is an extension to our
previous implementation of sRI-CC2 method and provides essential ingredients
for large-scale nonadiabatic dynamics.

- **TL;DR**: 自学习量子蒙特卡洛方法(SLQMC)利用机器学习近似自由能，模拟经典Holstein-转子-费米子模型的相变，显著降低计算成本，但在大粒子网格和相变附近效率下降。

To evaluate the effectiveness of machine learning in systems with competing
interactions, we developed a self-learning quantum Monte Carlo (SLQMC) method
to simulate the phase transition in the classical Holstein-spin-fermion model.
In SLQMC, machine learning techniques are employed to approximate the free
energy, thereby bypassing the need for exact diagonalization and significantly
reducing computational cost. We assess the performance of SLQMC using both
linear regression and neural network models. Our results show that both models
are capable of capturing the phase transition from the antiferromagnetic state
to the charge-density-wave state. However, the sampling efficiency decreases
near the AFM-CDW phase transition, which is attributed to the increased
mean-squared-error of the machine learning model. Additionally, the sampling
efficiency decreases with increasing lattice size. This suppression is due to
the increased root-mean-squared-error as the machine learning model is applied
to a large lattice and the finite-size effect, wherein the energy gap between
the ground state and low-energy excited states decreases as the lattice grows.
Our findings highlight the necessity of highly accurate machine learning models
to simulate theoretical models with complex, competing microscopic interactions
on a large lattice.

### Stochastic Compartment Model of Epidemic Spreading in Complex Networks with Mortality and Resetting

- **TL;DR**: 提出包含死亡但排除人口出生死亡的流行病隔室模型，使用随机游走者模拟S、E、I、R、D状态，在Watts-Strogatz网络上研究疾病传播

We propose an epidemic compartment model, which includes mortality caused by
the disease, but excludes demographic birth and death processes. Individuals
are represented by random walkers, which are in one of the following states
(compartments) S (susceptible to infection), E (exposed: infected but not
infectious corresponding to the latency period), I (infected and infectious), R
(recovered, immune), D (dead). The disease is transmitted with a certain
probability at contacts of I to S walkers. The compartmental sojourn times are
independent random variables drawn from specific (here Gamma-) distributions.
We implement this model into random walk simulations. Each walker performs an
independent simple Markovian random walk on a graph, where we consider a
Watts-Strogatz (WS) network. Only I walkers may die. For zero mortality, we
prove the existence of an endemic equilibrium for basic reproduction number
${\cal R}_0 &gt; 1$ and for which the disease free (globally healthy) state is
unstable. We explore the effects of long-range-journeys (stochastic resetting)
and mortality. Our model allows for various interpretations, such as certain
chemical reactions, the propagation of wildfires, and in population dynamics.

- **TL;DR**: 在FeSe超导薄膜的涡旋流区域观察到纵向和横向的非互易电荷输运现象，揭示了表面对称性破缺和热激发涡旋/反涡旋的作用

We report the nonreciprocal charge transport along the longitudinal and
transverse directions in the vortex flow regime of FeSe superconducting films.
Clear nonreciprocal signals under an inplane magnetic field reveals symmetry
breaking at the film surfaces since the crystal structure of FeSe is
centrosymmetric. Although the symmetry in such polar superconductors allows the
nonreciprocal transverse response under a magnetic field parallel to the
electric current, its observation is physically counterintuitive because vortex
motion is not expected in this configuration. We propose that thermally excited
(anti)vortices due to the two-dimensional nature of FeSe give rise to the
nonreciprocal transverse signals when the mirror symmetry is broken by the
inplane magnetic field.

Graph Neural Networks have rapidly advanced in materials science and
chemistry,with their performance critically dependent on comprehensive
representations of crystal or molecular structures across five dimensions:
elemental information, geometric topology, electronic interactions, symmetry,
and long-range interactions. Existing models still exhibit limitations in
representing electronic interactions, symmetry, and long-range information.
This study compares physics-based site feature calculators with data-driven
graph representation strategies. We find that the latter achieve superior
performance in representation completeness, convergence speed, and
extrapolation capability by incorporating electronic structure generation
models-such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) that compress Kohn-Sham wave
functions and leveraging multi-task learning. Notably, the CHGNet-V1/V2
strategies, when integrated into the DenseGNN model,significantly outperform
state-of-the-art models across 35 datasets from Matbench and JARVIS-DFT,
yielding predictions with accuracy close to that of DFT calculations.
Furthermore, applying a pre-training and fine-tuning strategy substantially
reduces the prediction error for band gaps of complex disordered materials,
demonstrating the superiority and potential of data-driven graph
representations in accelerating materials discovery.

### Giant Molecular Toroidal Moment Amenable to Direct Observation in a Fe$_{10}$Dy$_{10}$ Ring

In single molecule toroics (SMTs) atomic spins and orbital currents generate
magnetic vortices known as toroidal moments $\boldsymbol{\tau}$, endowed with
both magnetic and electric dipole symmetries, which can enable spin control via
magnetoelectric effects as well as the development of robust qubits. In the
archetypal Dy$_3$ SMT, $\boldsymbol{\tau}$ is challenging to detect and
control. Larger molecular rings can offer an enhanced toroidal response
amenable to direct observation and manipulation. Here we report SMT properties
for the $3d$-$4f$ icosanuclear molecular ring Fe$_{10}$Dy$_{10}$, displaying
toroidal excitations of unprecedented magnitude and energy dispersion spanning
a $\sim$62 billion dimensional toroidal space. We show these properties can be
modeled using an ab initio-parameterised transfer matrix approach yielding
excellent agreement with experiments. To assess the bulk toroidal polarization
attainable in this system, we introduce the molar toroidal susceptibility
$\xi$, a thermodynamic linear response function measuring the SMT
finite-temperature toroidal polarization induced by a magnetic field with a
small non-vanishing curl. Direct calculation of $\xi$ for Fe$_{10}$Dy$_{10}$
reveals a significant finite-temperature ground state toroidal polarization
which should be amenable to experimental detection via spatially-focused
magnetic field curls, as attainable e.g. using focused femtosecond laser
pulses. Our findings could thus pave the way for direct observation and
manipulation of molecular toroidal moments.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究通过应变调控和X射线衍射揭示了CsV₃Sb₅中2×2×4电子晶格的巨大应变响应和轨道自由度在电子有序中的关键作用

The kagome metals AV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ (A = K, Rb, Cs) provide a unique platform
to investigate the physics of interacting electrons, a central challenge in
condensed matter physics. A key obstacle in unraveling their correlated
behavior is to determine which structural and electronic degrees of freedom are
involved and how they couple. Here we address this important issue with a novel
approach, namely by exploring the strain dependence of electronic superlattices
in CsV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$. Using high-resolution x-ray diffraction, we track the
detwinning of the $2\times 2\times 4$ electronic crystal and uncover a gigantic
strain response of its domains. We further show that the detwinned $2\times
2\times 4$ phase exhibits an intrinsic 2$\textbf{q}$-modulation and strong mode
coupling. Density functional theory reveals that the structural $2\times
2\times 4$ modulation couples strongly to the V $3d$-orbitals, naturally
explaining its pronounced strain response. In contrast, the $2\times 2\times 2$
phase at lower temperatures remains essentially unaffected by small uniaxial
strain. This dichotomy points to fundamental differences in the symmetry
breaking and stabilization mechanisms of the two electronic orders. More
specifically, our results provide evidence for the active role of orbital
degrees of freedom, which can realize distinct, complex ordering patterns
driven by competing interactions.

### An orthogonal electronic state view on charge delocalization and transfer

We present a configuration interaction (CI) framework which serves
quantitative and conceptual purposes for charge delocalization and electron
transfer processes in molecular systems. The electronic Hamiltonian is
expressed in a basis of charge-localized determinants and used to independently
generate adiabatic CI states and charge-localized CI states, both of which are
unambiguously defined through a diagonalization procedure. The CI framework
offers a simple interpretation of adiabatic states as resonance hybrids of
different electron distributions, providing a simple picture for discussing
charge-delocalization in chemical bonding. The charge-localized states serve as
a convenient orthogonal representation of initial and final states in electron
transfer processes, and provides an unambiguous definition of their electronic
coupling. These two models enable an analysis of the water dimer hydrogen bond.
We demonstrate that although the overall charge delocalization is small, the
occurrence of particular ionic contributions are crucial to get the correct
electronic description.

### Persistent Charge and Spin Currents in a Ferromagnetic Hatano-Nelson Ring

We investigate persistent charge and spin currents in a ferromagnetic
Hatano-Nelson ring with anti-Hermitian intradimer hopping, where non-reciprocal
hopping generates a synthetic magnetic flux and drives a non-Hermitian
Aharonov-Bohm effect. The system supports both real and imaginary persistent
currents, with ferromagnetic spin splitting enabling all three spin-current
components, dictated by the orientation of magnetic moments. The currents are
computed using the current operator method within a biorthogonal basis. In
parallel, the complex band structure is analyzed to uncover the spectral
characteristics. We emphasize how the currents evolve across different
topological regimes, and how they are influenced by chemical potential,
ferromagnetic ordering, finite size, and disorder. Strikingly, disorder can
even amplify spin currents, opening powerful new routes for manipulating spin
transport in non-Hermitian systems.

### Irreversibility of the pendulum revisited from Husimi's adiabaticity parameter

We revisit the irreversibility of the pendulum with time-dependent angular
frequency, considered in a classical paper by K. Husimi. He introduced a
parameter that measures the adiabaticity of a process utilizing an adiabatic
invariant for the equation of motion of the pendulum. With this adiabaticity
parameter, Husimi showed the irreversibility of the pendulum for a cyclic
process, which is reminiscent of the Planck principle in thermodynamics, based
on the microscopic mechanics. In this study, we generalize the argument by
Husimi to a damped pendulum with friction, and highlight the role of
conservation of a phase-space area on the Husimi's adiabaticity parameter.
Moreover, we also investigate the second law of thermodynamics and its
generalization for a general non-cyclic process as well as a cyclic process,
and elucidate how the Husimi's adiabaticity parameter impacts on this law. In
particular, for a general non-cyclic process, we show the law of entropy
non-decrease for the pendulum without friction by using the property of the
Husimi's adiabaticity parameter.

### Euler band topology in superfluids and superconductors

Real band topology often appears in systems with space-time inversion
symmetry and is characterized by invariants such as the Euler and second
Stiefel-Whitney classes. Here, we examine the generic band topology of
Bogoliubov de-Gennes (BdG) Hamiltonians with $C_{2z}T$ symmetry, where $C_{2z}$
and $T$ are twofold rotation about the $z$ axis and time-reversal symmetries,
respectively. We discuss the Euler band topology of superfluids and
superconductors in the DIII and CI Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classes, where
the Euler class serves as an integer-valued topological invariant of the
$4\times4$ BdG Hamiltonian. Using expressions for the Euler class under
$n$-fold rotational symmetry, we derive formulas relating the Euler class to
previously known topological invariants of class DIII and CI systems. We
demonstrate that three-dimensional class DIII topological phases with an odd
winding number, including the B phase of superfluid Helium 3, are topological
superconductors or superfluids with a nontrivial Euler class. We refer to these
as Euler superconductors or superfluids. Specifically, the $^3$He-B superfluid
in a magnetic field is identified as an Euler superfluid. Three-dimensional
class CI topological phases with twice an odd winding number are also Euler
superconductors or superfluids. When spatial inversion symmetry is present,
class CI superconductors with a nontrivial Euler class exhibit superconducting
nodal lines with a linking structure. This phenomenon is demonstrated using a
model of a three-dimensional $s_\pm$-wave superconductor. These findings
provide a unified framework for exploring Euler band topology in superfluids
and superconductors, connecting various phenomena associated with $T$-breaking
perturbations, including Majorana Ising susceptibility and higher-order
topology.

Ionic liquid (IL) gating has emerged as a powerful tool to control the
structural, electronic, optical, and magnetic properties of materials by
driving ion motion at solid interfaces. In magneto-ionic systems, electric
fields are used to move ions, typically oxygen, from a donor layer into an
underlying magnetic metal. Although oxygen distribution is key to enabling
precise and stable control in magneto-ionic systems, the spatial distribution
and voltage-dependence of oxygen incorporation in such nanoscale stacks remain
unknown. Here, we quantify oxygen depth profiles and oxide formation in Si/
SiO2/ Ta (15)/ HfO2 (t) films after IL gating as a function of the gate voltage
and HfO2 capping thickness (2 and 3 nm). X-ray reflectivity and X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy measurements revealed a threshold electric field of
~ -2.8 MV/cm to initiate oxygen migration from HfO2 into metallic Ta. The
resulting Ta2O5 thickness increases linearly with gate voltage, reaching up to
4 nm at -3 V gating. Notably, the required electric field rises with oxide
thickness, indicating a progressively growing barrier for thicker oxide films.
The Ta/Ta2O5 interface remains atomically sharp for all gate voltages. This
suggests that complete Ta2O5 layers form sequentially before further oxygen
penetration, with no sign of deeper diffusion into bulk Ta. Thinner capping
layers enhance oxidation, relevant for optimized stack design. Additionally,
indium migration from the indium tin oxide electrode to the sample surface was
observed, which should be considered for surface-sensitive applications. These
insights advance design principles for magneto-ionic and nanoionic devices
requiring precise interface engineering.

We consider a coupled system of Dirac operators that finds applications as a
macroscopic model of spin and valley polarized gated rhombohedral graphene
(RHG) with an arbitrary number of layers as well as in replica models of
Floquet topological insulators. We classify all quantum anomalous Hall phases
that are compatible with the model and show that a bulk-edge correspondence
between bulk phases and chiral edge states carrying a quantized anomalous Hall
charge applies. When the displacement field is sufficiently small compared to
the inter-layer coupling in the RHG application, we retrieve the known phases
where the charge is given by the number of graphene layers. When the
displacement field increases, we identify all possible topological phase
transitions and corresponding quantized chiral edge charges. Numerical
simulations confirm the theoretical findings.

Symmetry informed diffraction patterns for magnetically ordered MnF2
illuminated by x-rays tuned in energy to a Mn atomic resonance depend on
circular polarization in the primary beam. The change in intensity of a Bragg
spot with a change in handedness defines a chiral signature for the compensated
antiferromagnet that is calculated for electric dipole (E1) and electric
quadrupole (E2) absorption events. E1-E2 absorption events are forbidden by
inversion symmetry in Wyckoff positions assigned to Mn ions in the established
MnF2 magnetic symmetry. Spin-flip signals from the magnetic scattering of
polarized neutrons depend on electronic quadrupole and octupole moments that
are zero for the nominal 3d5 configuration of Mn2+, which make them good tests
of the actual electronic structure.

Platinum-water interfaces underpin many electrochemical energy conversion
processes. However, despite decades of research, the real-space liquid
structure of these interfaces remains elusive. Using three-dimensional atomic
force microscopy (3D-AFM), we mapped Pt-water interface in real space with
angstrom-level resolution. Topographic imaging revealed atomically flat (type
I) and stripe-like (type II) surface nanodomains. Force-distance profiles above
type I domains exhibited oscillatory decay patterns with periodicity of ~0.33
nm, consistent with water. In contrast, type II domains showed stronger
oscillations with larger periodicity of ~0.45 nm and extended decay lengths,
indicative of a different liquid structure with stronger correlation and
ordering. Wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) measurements of pure water and a
series of liquid n-alkanes revealed peaks at ~0.31 nm and ~0.46 nm, in
agreement with 3D-AFM observations of type I and type II structures,
respectively. Our findings uncover the coexistence of two types of liquid
structures at Pt-water interfaces modulated by surface heterogeneity, enabling

- **TL;DR**: GPUTB是一个GPU加速的紧束缚机器学习框架，能够高效地将原子结构映射到电子结构，处理百万原子系统，在计算精度和效率之间取得良好平衡。

The high computational cost of ab-initio methods limits their application in
predicting electronic properties at the device scale. Therefore, an efficient
method is needed to map the atomic structure to the electronic structure
quickly. Here, we develop GPUTB, a GPU-accelerated tight-binding (TB) machine
learning framework. GPUTB employs atomic environment descriptors, enabling the
model parameters to incorporate environmental dependence. This allows the model
to transfer to different basis, xc-functionals, and allotropes easily. Combined
with the linear scaling quantum transport method, we have calculated the
electronic density of states for up to 100 million atoms in pristine graphene.
Trained on finite-temperature structures, the model can be easily extended to
millions of atom finite-temperature systems. Furthermore, GPUTB can also
successfully describe h-BN/graphene heterojunction systems, demonstrating its
capability to handle complex material with high precision. We accurately
reproduce the relationship between carrier concentration and room temperature
mobility in graphene to verify the framework's accuracy. Therefore, our GPUTB
framework presents a delicate balance between computational accuracy and
efficiency, providing a powerful computational tool for investing electronic
properties for large systems with millions of atoms.

The statistics of the slowest first-passage time among a large population of
$N$ searchers is crucial for determining the completion time of many stochastic
processes. Classical extreme-value theory predicts that for diffusing particles
in a finite domain of size $L$, the slowest first passage time follows a Gumbel
distribution, but a Fr\'echet distribution in an infinite domain. Here, we
study the physically relevant thermodynamic limit where both $N$ and $L$
diverge while the density $\rho = N/L$ remains constant. We obtain an explicit
solution for the extreme value in the thermodynamic limit, which recovers the
Fr\'echet and Gumbel distributions in the low- and high-density limits,
respectively, and reveals new, nontrivial behavior at intermediate densities.
We then extend the framework to compact diffusion on fractal domains, showing
that the walk dimension $d_w$ and fractal dimension $d_f$ control the
extreme-value statistics via geometry-dependent scaling. The theory yields the
full set of moments and finite-density corrections, providing a unified
description of slowest-arrival times in confined Euclidean and fractal media.

We investigate high-energy spin excitations in hole-doped
La$_{2-x}$Ca$_{x}$CuO$_{4-\delta}$ films across a broad Ca doping range $x =
0.05-0.50$ using resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS). Polarization
analysis and incident-photon energy detuning measurements confirm the
persistence of collective paramagnon excitations up to $x = 0.50$. Consistent
with previous studies on other cuprate families, we observe a pronounced
crossover near $x = 0.15$, where paramagnon spectral weight is transferred to
incoherent spin-flip excitations associated with the particle-hole continuum.
The overall behavior of paramagnons in LCCO resembles that in other hole-doped
cuprates and appears insensitive to the persistence of superconductivity at
high doping levels in LCCO - up to at least $x = 0.50$, as demonstrated in
prior work. These findings support the view that high-energy magnetic
excitations probed by RIXS are not a major contributor to superconducting
pairing, in line with theories of spin-fluctuation mediated superconductivity.

The reliable identification of magnetic ground states remains a major
challenge in high-throughput materials databases, where density functional
theory (DFT) workflows often converge to ferromagnetic (FM) solutions. Here, we
partially address this challenge by developing machine learning classifiers
trained on experimentally validated MAGNDATA magnetic materials leveraging a
limited number of simple compositional, structural, and electronic descriptors
sourced from the Materials Project database. Our propagation vector classifiers
achieve accuracies above 92%, outperforming recent studies in reliably
distinguishing zero from nonzero propagation vector structures, and exposing a
systematic ferromagnetic bias inherent to the Materials Project database for
more than 7,843 materials. In parallel, LightGBM and XGBoost models trained
directly on the Materials Project labels achieve accuracies of 84-86% (with
macro F1 average scores of 63-66%), which proves useful for large-scale
screening for magnetic classes, if refined by MAGNDATA-trained classifiers.
These results underscore the role of machine learning techniques as corrective
and exploratory tools, enabling more trustworthy databases and accelerating
progress toward the identification of materials with various properties.

### Gate-Tunable Ambipolar Josephson Current in a Topological Insulator

- **TL;DR**: 在量子零点附近观测到可门控的双极性超流，这为实现拓扑超导和Majorana物理提供了基础

Dirac surface states in a topological insulator (TI) with proximity-induced
superconductivity offer a promising platform for realizing topological
superconductivity and Majorana physics. However, in TIs, the Josephson effect
is usually observed in regimes where transport is dominated by either
substantial bulk conduction channels or unipolar surface states. In this work,
we demonstrate gate-tunable ambipolar Josephson current in lateral Josephson
junction (JJ) devices based on bulk-insulating (Bi,Sb)2Te3 thin films grown by
molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). For thinner films, the supercurrent exhibits
pronounced gate-tunable ambipolar behavior and is significantly suppressed as
the chemical potential approaches the Dirac point, yet persists across it. In
contrast, thicker films exhibit a much weaker ambipolar response. Moreover, we
find that the supercurrent becomes significantly less resilient to external
magnetic fields when the chemical potential is tuned near the Dirac point in
both thickness regimes. Our numerical simulations demonstrate the ambipolar
behavior of these TI JJ devices and attribute the asymmetric supercurrent
observed in thicker TI films to the coexistence of Dirac surface states and
bulk conduction channels. The demonstration of gate-tunable ambipolar Josephson
transport in MBE-grown TI films paves the way for realizing
Dirac-surface-state-mediated topological superconductivity and establishes a
foundation for future exploration of electrically tunable Majorana modes.

- **TL;DR**: 研究FeSb2表面碳轻轨道运输性质，发现了沿[100]方向的碳晶各异性和3D变程跳跃导电机制，与强拓扑结构不符

Motivated by the recent discovery of metallic surface states in the
d-electron Kondo insulator candidates FeSi and FeSb2, along with some recent
reports of magnetic correlations in the surface transport properties of FeSi,
we have investigated the low temperature surface magnetotransport properties of
FeSb2. By using a Corbino disk transport geometry, we were able to isolate the
electrical transport properties of a single surface of our samples and study
the [110] and [101] naturally forming faces separately. Studying the
relationship between the applied magnetic field, current direction and crystal
symmetry has allowed us to separate possible contributions to the
magnetotransport anisotropy. Unlike previous studies of SmB6 surface states, we
find no two-dimensional Drude-like dependence on field orientation relative to
current direction, but instead a magnetocrystalline anisotropy that appears to
originate from local moment scattering with a well defined easy-axis along the
[100] direction. We compare these results with the magnetotransport properties
of the conducting surface states on the [111] facet of FeSi. We also find
evidence of 3D variable-range hopping conduction below the bulk-to-surface
crossover, extending below 1 K, which implies that the electrical transport at
the surface of these materials is carried by a thin, but 3D conducting channel,
which is inconsistent with the lower dimensional states expected for a strong
topological insulator.

### Duality between dissipation-coherence trade-off and thermodynamic speed limit based on thermodynamic uncertainty relation for stochastic limit cycles in the weak-noise limit

- **TL;DR**: 该论文推导了弱噪声极限下随机极限环的两个基本权衡关系：耗散-相干权衡和热力学速度极限，通过热力学不确定性关系证明它们是相互对偶的。

We derive two fundamental trade-offs for general stochastic limit cycles in
the weak-noise limit. The first is the dissipation-coherence trade-off, which
was numerically conjectured and partially proved by Santolin and Falasco [Phys.
Rev. Lett. 135, 057101 (2025)]. This trade-off bounds the entropy production
required for one oscillatory period using the number of oscillations that occur
before steady-state correlations are disrupted. The second is the thermodynamic
speed limit, which bounds the entropy production with the Euclidean length of
the limit cycle. These trade-offs are obtained by substituting mutually dual
observables, derived from the stability of the limit cycle, into the
thermodynamic uncertainty relation. This fact allows us to regard the
dissipation-coherence trade-off as the dual of the thermodynamic speed limit.
We numerically demonstrate these trade-offs using the noisy R\"{o}ssler model.

### Oxygen-driven altermagnetic symmetry inducing d-wave superconductivity in the cuprates and nickelates

Since the discovery of cuprate high-Tc superconductivity, numerous
theoretical frameworks have been proposed; Anderson's RVB picture (Science 235,
1196-1198, 1987) and U(1) gauge theory (Phys. Rev. Lett. 76, 503-506, 1996)
motivate a minimal one-band view that largely integrates out oxygen. By
contrast, altermagnetism (Phys. Rev. X 12, 040501, 2022) yields a d-wave-like
k-space magnetic texture from alternatingly rotated nonmagnetic cages; La2CuO4
(the parent of a high-Tc cuprate) is a prototypical example. As a proof of
principle, we show in La2CuO4 that an alternating local pairing potential on
the two Cu sublattices (plus/minus s(r)) produces a nodal, d-wave-like
Delta(k). Since orthorhombic tilts are not the driver (and even suppress
superconductivity in nickelates; Nature 621, 493, 2023), we then show that the
in-plane oxygen sublattice of CuO2/NiO2 layers - ubiquitous in cuprates and
nickelates - intrinsically realizes the same symmetry. Imposing an
oxygen-centered, staggered s pairing yields a d-wave gap with perfect C4
symmetry, demonstrated self-consistently in NdNiO2 from first principles. While
the microscopic origin remains open, we outline possible scenarios, and our
real-space construction maps directly onto lattice models, placing
superconductivity and Hubbard physics on the same footing.

### Skyrmion manipulation and logic gate functionality in transition metal multilayers

Magnetic skyrmions, due to their topological stability and high mobility, are
strong candidates for information carriers in spintronic devices. To advance
their practical applications, a detailed understanding of their nucleation and
current-driven dynamics is essential. We investigate the formation and
manipulation of skyrmions in a square nano structure (200 $\times$ 200
nm$^{2}$, 1 nm thick) of PdFe/Ir(111) multilayers subjected to nano second
current pulses with magnitude ranging from (1-5)$\times$10$^{11}$ A/m$^2$.
Using micromagnetic simulations, we demonstrate controlled motion of skyrmion
under different types of spin-transfer torque (STT). The calculated skyrmion
Hall angle (SkH) for Slonczewski type STT is ${\theta_{SkH}^{SL}} =
89.53^{\circ}$ for PdFe/Ir(111) multilayers which ensures the edge accululation
of skyrmion like a track within the nano structure and we extend this idea
further for different shape engineering of skyrmion in 4d tranisition metal
multilayers by manipulating the magnitude and direction of current pulses.
Next, we investigate the influence of voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy
ranging from (1.4 - 4.2) $\times$ 10$^6$ J/m$^3$ with external magnetic field
B$_{ext}$ = 2 T, and (0 - 2.8) $\times$ 10$^6$ J/m$^3$ with B$_{ext}$ = 3 T
respectively, on skyrmion dynamics for designing anisotropy-engineered barriers
to guide their trajectories in PdFe/Ir(111) multilayers. We use further these
barriers to implement basic logic operations, including OR and AND gates, with
skyrmions representing binary states. The calculatd skyrmion Hall angle for
Zhang-Li type STT in PdFe/Ir(111) multilayers is ${\theta_{SkH}^{ZL}} =
3.26^{\circ}$. Consequently, the skyrmions propagate predominantly along the
direction of the applied current with minimal deflection, a feature that
renders them highly suitable for logic operations.

In low-dimensional superconductors, the interplay between quantum confinement
and interfacial hybridization effects can reshape Cooper pair wavefunctions and
induce novel forms of unconventional superconductivity. In this work, we employ
a plasma-free, carbon buffer layer-assisted confinement epitaxy method to
synthesize trilayer gallium (Ga) sandwiched between a graphene layer and a
6H-SiC(0001) substrate, forming an air-stable graphene/trilayer Ga/SiC
heterostructure. In this confined light-element Ga layer, we demonstrate
interfacial Ising-type superconductivity driven by atomic orbital hybridization
between the Ga layer and the SiC substrate. Electrical transport measurements
reveal that the in-plane upper critical magnetic field u0Hc2,|| reaches ~21.98T
at T=400 mK, approximately 3.38 times the Pauli paramagnetic limit (~6.51T).
Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements combined with
theoretical calculations confirm the presence of split Fermi surfaces with
Ising-type spin textures at the K and K' valleys of the confined Ga layer
strongly hybridized with SiC. Moreover, by incorporating finite relaxation time
induced by impurity scattering into an Ising-type superconductivity model, we
reproduce the entire temperature-dependent u0Hc2,|| phase diagram. This work
establishes a new strategy to realize unconventional pairing wavefunctions by
combining quantum confinement and interfacial hybridization effects in
superconducting thin films. It also opens new avenues for designing scalable
superconducting quantum electronic and spintronic devices through interfacial
engineering.

### Dynamically emergent correlations in Brownian particles subject to simultaneous non-Poissonian resetting protocols

- **TL;DR**: 本文研究了一维N个独立布朗粒子在同时随机重置下的动力学行为，通过分析不同重置时间分布ψ(τ)对系统的影响，发现重置会动态产生粒子间相关性，最终形成强相关的非平衡稳态。

We consider a one-dimensional gas of $N$ independent Brownian particles
subject to simultaneous stochastic resetting, with inter-reset times drawn from
a general waiting-time distribution $\psi(\tau)$. This includes the well-known
Poissonian case, where $\psi(\tau)=re^{-r\tau}$, and extends to more general
classes of resetting, such as heavy-tailed and bounded distributions. We show
that the simultaneous resetting generates correlations between particles
dynamically. These correlations grow with time and eventually drive the system
into a strongly correlated non-equilibrium stationary state (NESS). Exploiting
the renewal structure of the resetting dynamics, we derive explicit analytical
expressions for the joint distribution of the positions of the particles in the
NESS. We show that the NESS has a conditionally independent and identically
distributed (CIID) structure that enables us to compute various physical
observables exactly for arbitrary $\psi(\tau)$. These observables include the
average density, extreme value and order statistics, the spacing distribution
between consecutive particles and the full counting statistics, i.e., the
distribution of the number of particles in a given interval centered at the
origin. We discuss the universal features of the large $N$ scaling behaviors of
these observables for different choices of the resetting protocol $\psi(\tau)$.
Our results provide an interesting example of a stochastic control whereby, by
tuning the inter-reset distribution $\psi(\tau)$, one can generate a class of
tunable, and yet solvable, strongly correlated NESS in a many-body system.

Ferromagnetic superconductors, where ferromagnetism and superconductivity
coexist despite their antagonism, exhibit strikingly diverse behaviors.
Depending on the interplay between the ferromagnetic exchange field and the
superconducting condensate, superconductivity may vary with temperature
monotonically, non-monotonically, or even reentrantly, all of which can be
tuned by external magnetic fields. Here, we present a unified theoretical
framework and construct comprehensive phase diagrams that capture these regimes
and predict new phenomena, including doublereentrant superconductivity. We
further demonstrate how magnetic fields drive systematic shifts between
distinct temperature-dependent behaviors, thereby explaining recent
experimental results and predicting new transitions. In addition, we show that
the field-induced enhancement of superconductivity, previously observed as a
slight increase in Tc, can under certain conditions become dramatic.

### Intrinsic Topological Dice Flat Band in Yttrium Monochloride Electrides

In a recent experiment [arXiv:2508.21311] the long-sought dice lattice and
its characteristic flat band has been discovered for the first time in the
two-dimensional layered electride yttrium monochloride (YCl), in which the
interstitial anionic electrons of the electride self-organize into a dice
lattice geometry. In this Letter, combining symmetry analysis, relativistic
density-functional theory and realistic tight-binding model calculations, we
predict that the dice flat band in YCl is intrinsically topological and
characterized by a high Chern number of $\mathcal{C} = \pm 4$. In particular,
the intrinsic atomic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) from $4d$-electrons of yttrium
atoms creates topological gaps on the scale of 20 meV near $\pm K$ and leads to
the emergence of nontrivial Berry curvatures and band topology. Displacement
fields applied across the layered electride architecture can easily drive
topological phase transitions. Our findings establish the newly discovered YCl
electride as the first natural material hosting a dice flat Chern band without
any extrinsic band engineering.

### Quantization of spin circular photogalvanic effect in altermagnetic Weyl semimetals

We theoretically predict a spin-current analog of the quantized circular
photogalvanic effect in Weyl semimetals. This phenomenon is forbidden in
antiferromagnets by symmetry but uniquely allowed in altermagnets, highlighting
a novel and intrinsic characteristic of altermagnetism. To systematically
explore second-order spin current responses, we classify all symmetry-allowed
responses based on spin point groups. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive
classification of altermagnetic Weyl semimetals by identifying spin space
groups that host symmetry-enforced Weyl points. Utilizing this classification,
we construct a symmetry-guided tight-binding model and confirm our predictions.
Finally, we identify Weyl crossings in a material candidate via first-principle
calculations. Our work unveils a distinctive optical response of altermagnets,
paving the way for a new frontier in altermagnetism.

We demonstrate that strongly bound excitons, whose radii approach the lattice
constant, display physics that eludes continuum descriptions not just
quantitatively but qualitatively. We investigate such phenomenology by
calculating the exciton spectra for several one- and two-dimensional lattice
models, whose valence band has a multi-orbital character. We identify sharp
transitions in the character and momentum of the lowest-energy exciton driven
directly by the multi-orbital nature of the lattice models. Such transitions
cannot occur in simple continuum descriptions.

We investigate a simple fermionic system designed to detect an unknown
hopping rate between two sites by analyzing current circulation. The system
exploits geometric asymmetry and utilizes the connection between the additional
energy degeneracy point (AEDP) and current circulation for precise parameter
detection. In the low-temperature, low-bias regime, with baths chemical
potentials aligned near the degenerate energy, we find that a balanced
Wheatstone bridge condition emerges when the direction of current circulation
reverses, providing a direct means to determine the unknown hopping strength.
We further examine the impact of environmental interactions, demonstrating that
the device remains functional under moderately strong dephasing and particle
losses, though extreme environmental effects eventually degrade performance.
Extending the analysis to general operating conditions, we show that the device
continues to function effectively at higher voltages and temperatures. Our
results highlight geometric asymmetry as a robust and practical tool for
quantum metrology.

such as superconductivity-rather than merely enhancing local pairing. Here we
show that impulsively driven low-frequency phonons enhance long-range
electronic correlations in a low-dimensional metal. Through numerically exact
simulations, we demonstrate that slow phonons suppress dynamical disorder,
enabling buildup of coherence and enhancement of charge (and pairing) orders.
These findings provide direct evidence that light can mediate enhancement of
long-range order and suggest that future experimental strategies-such as the
design of selective excitations of narrow phonon distributions to limit
dephasing-may offer viable routes to design and stabilize transient
superconducting states.

Phonon anharmonicity are ubiquitous in real materials, creating finite phonon
lifetimes. These effects are crucial for understanding thermal properties and
phase stability. In this work, we define optimal phonon quasiparticles as those
that maximize their lifetimes, and prove that the information about these
quasiparticles is contained in two small matrices $\mathcal{S}$ and
$\mathcal{Q}$, which can be constructed directly from molecular dynamics
simulations. Based on these knowledge, we proposed an optimization scheme,
which allows us to efficiently determine temperature-dependent phonon modes,
frequencies and lifetimes. We applied this method to silicon and cubic
CaSiO$_3$, revealing their temperature-dependent phonon behaviors and obtaining
the well-known phonon softening in cubic CaSiO$_3$. This theory provides a
convenient tool for investigating phonon quasiparticles and can be extended to
study other quasiparticles, such as electrons and magnons.

Orbital-selective correlations have been observed to play an important role
in Fe-based superconductors. Here, in contrast to previous site-local Mott
transition-based origins, we present a band-theory-based mechanism for
orbital-selective physics in monolayer FeSe, for which only electron pockets
appear. Underlying our mechanism is our density functional theory (DFT)-based
observation that, for the electron pockets, antiferromagnetic fluctuations are
strongly coupled to electrons in $x^2-y^2$ orbitals but weakly coupled to those
in $\{xz,yz\}$ orbitals. Symmetry-arguments reveal that this orbital selective
coupling originates from the different intertwined orbital and Fe-site
sublattice Bloch wavefunctions for these two sets of orbitals, specifically,
the $x^2-y^2$ orbitals can be Fe-site localized. The strong coupling of
electrons in $x^2-y^2$ orbitals to the magnetic fluctuations enables
orbital-selective electronic renormalizations that can account for important
features of our angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements.
Our symmetry-required mechanism for orbital selective physics can be
generalized to a range of crystal space groups with four-fold and six-fold
screw axes.

This work presents a comprehensive investigation of the HH alloy PdCrAs using
first - principles methods, highlighting its potential applications in various
fields, including spintronics, thermoelectrics, and optoelectronics. We
employed density functional theory (DFT) within the full potential linearized
augmented plane wave (FLAPW) framework. Structural optimizations indicate that
the alloy stabilizes in the ferromagnetic phase. Both mechanical and dynamical
stability have been confirmed through analyses of elastic constants and phonon
dispersion. Our calculations of the electronic band structure and density of
states (DOS) reveal that PdCrAs exhibits half-metallic behavior, with a
spin-polarized band gap of 0.670 eV in the minority spin channel. The magnetic
moment aligns with the Slater Pauling (SP) rule, indicating robust
ferromagnetism. Mechanical analysis shows that the material is ductile in
nature. Thermodynamic analysis highlights the alloy's resilience, supported by
consistent trends in entropy, heat capacity, and Debye temperature.Its optical
response demonstrates strong absorption in the visible and ultraviolet (UV)
regions, along with pronounced dielectric and plasmonic features, suggesting
potential applications in optoelectronics and refracective coatings.
Furthermore, evaluations of the transport properties reveal high Seebeck
coefficients and a significantly tunable figure of merit (ZT), with values
approaching 0.9 across the temperature range of 300 - 1500 K, indicating
excellent thermoelectric characteristics. Overall, these findings position
PdCrAs as a promising multifunctional material suitable sustainable energy

We address finite crystallization in two dimensions in the presence of a flat
crystalline substrate. Particles interact through short-range two- and
three-body potentials favoring local square-lattice arrangements. An additional
interaction term of relative strength $\beta&gt;0$ couples the particles and the
substrate. Our first main result proves crystallization for all $\beta&gt;0$,
corresponding to
  the onset of discrete Winterbottom configurations. The proof relies on a
stratification technique from [31], characterizing the topology of the bond
graph of minimizing configurations.
  Our second main result concerns fluctuations estimates for $\beta\in (0,1)$.
We obtain bounds on the distance between distinct minimizers with the same
number $N$ of particles, showing a sharp scaling law $N^{3/4}$ when $\beta$ is
rational, and $N^{1/3}$ when $\beta$ is irrational and algebraic. This reveals
a genuine substrate-driven effect on fluctuation laws. As a corollary, we
derive a discrete-to-continuum convergence of minimizers towards the
Winterbottom equilibrium shape in the large-particle limit.

### Site Basis Excitation Ansatz for Matrix Product States

- **Authors**: Steven R. White

- **TL;DR**: Error

We introduce a simple and efficient variation of the tangent-space excitation
ansatz used to compute elementary excitation spectra of one-dimensional quantum
lattice systems using matrix product states (MPS). A small basis for the
excitation tensors is formed based on a single diagonalization analogous to a
single site DMRG step but for multiple states. Once overlap and Hamiltonian
matrix elements are found, obtaining the excitation for any momentum only
requires diagonalization of a tiny matrix, akin to a non-orthogonal band-theory
diagonalization. The approach is based on an infinite MPS description of the
ground state, and we introduce an extremely simple alternative to variational
uniform matrix product states (VUMPS) based on finite system DMRG. For the
$S=1$ Heisenberg chain, our method -- site basis excitation ansatz (SBEA) --
efficiently produces the one-magnon dispersion with high accuracy. We also
examine the role of MPS gauge choices, finding that not imposing a gauge
condition -- leaving the basis nonorthogonal -- is crucial for the approach,
whereas imposing a left-orthonormal gauge (as in prior work) severely hampers
convergence. We also show how one can construct Wannier excitations, analogous
to the Wannier functions of band theory, where one Wannier excitation,
translated to all sites, can reconstruct the single magnon modes exactly for
all momenta.

In the journey of computer vision system development, the acquisition and
utilization of annotated images play a central role, providing information
about object identity, spatial extent, and viewpoint in depicted scenes.
However, thermal manufacturing processes like Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF)
often yield surfaces with defects such as Spatter, Crack, Pinhole, and Hole due
to the Balling phenomenon. Preprocessing images from LPBF, riddled with
defects, presents challenges in training machine learning (ML) algorithms.
Detecting defects is critical for predicting production quality and identifying
crucial points in artificial or natural structures. This paper introduces a
deep learning-based approach utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to
automatically detect and segment surface defects like cracks, spatter, holes,
and pinholes on production surfaces. In contrast to traditional machine
learning techniques requiring extensive processing time and manual feature
crafting, deep learning proves more accurate. The proposed architecture
undergoes training and testing on 14,982 labeled images annotated using the
LabelImg tool. Each object in the images is manually annotated with bounding
boxes and segmented masks. The trained CNN, coupled with OpenCV preprocessing
techniques, achieves an impressive 99.54% accuracy on the dataset with
resolutions of 1536 x 1103 pixels. Evaluation metrics for 50 true crack tests
demonstrate precision, recall, and F1-score exceeding 96%, 98%, and 97%,
respectively. Similarly, for 124 true pinhole tests, the metrics are 99%, 100%,
and 100%, for 258 true hole tests, they are 99%, 99%, and 99%, and for 318
spatter tests, the metrics are 100%, 99%, and 100%. These results highlight the
precision and effectiveness of the entire process, showcasing its potential for
reliable defect detection in production surfaces.

### Generalizing the composite fermion theory for fractional Chern insulators

- **TL;DR**: 通过量子力学方法将复合费米子理论扩展到分数柯西绝缘体，提出了有效复合费米子汉密顿量和波函数形式，并在扩弥MoTe2双层系统中验证了理论的有效性。

We propose a generalized composite fermion (CF) theory for fractional Chern
insulators (FCIs) by adapting the quantum mechanics approach of CFs. The
theoretical framework naturally produces an effective CF Hamiltonian and a
wavefunction ansatz, and the Bloch band characteristics of FCIs determine
effective scalar and vector potentials experienced by CFs. Our analysis
clarifies the construction of CF wavefunctions and state counting in CF phase
space, which is subject to a density-of-states correction for filling factors
$|\nu| \neq 1/2$. We apply the theory to study the $\nu=-2/3$ FCI state of the
twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ system, modeling it as either a $1/3$-filled electron
band or a $2/3$-filled hole band. While both CF models exhibit trends and
features consistent with exact diagonalization results, the electron-based
model shows better agreement. Furthermore, we find that the FCI phase
transition coincides with a topological phase transition in unoccupied CF
$\Lambda$-bands.

The direct integration of high-performance ferroelectric oxides with silicon
remains challenging due to lattice mismatch, thermal incompatibility, and the
need for high-temperature epitaxial growth. Here, a hybrid integration approach
is demonstrated in which crystalline BaTiO3 (BTO) membranes are first
transferred onto Pt coated Si substrates and subsequently used as vector
substrates (VS) for the growth of epitaxial (001) Pb(Zr0.52Ti0.48)O3 (PZT) thin
films via chemical solution deposition (CSD). A KI and HCl based etchant
enables rapid and complete dissolution of the SrVO3 sacrificial layer in about
30 minutes, reducing the release time from days to minutes compared with
conventional water based approaches to dissolve AVO3 and AMoO3 (A is Ca, Sr,
Ba). The BTO VS imposes dominant (00l) out of plane orientation and in plane
cube on cube epitaxy in the overlying PZT. Devices exhibit remnant polarization
10 to 12 micro coulomb/cm2 and coercive field of 100 kV/cm, with stable
switching to 10^8 cycles on the VS. From piezoelectric butterfly loops, we
extract effective d33 of 70 pm/V for PZT on VS, and 54 pm/V for PZT grown on
conventional Pt Si substrates. This approach demonstrates a scalable and cost
effective route for integrating functional ferroelectric materials onto silicon
and offers a promising platform for future CMOS compatible oxide electronics.

- **TL;DR**: 在高移动性2D电子气中实现了近低磁场强度下的近完全费拉算旋转(θ_F=1.43 rad)，Verdet常数远超其他材料系统

We report the realization of near total Faraday rotation of $\theta_F$=1.43
rad (82 degrees) on a single pass through a 2D electron gas (2DEG), approaching
the ideal limit of $\pi/2$ rad (90 degrees). The corresponding Verdet constant
V = $9.5\times10^{8}$ rad T$^{-1}$m$^{-1}$, exceeds by approximately one order
of magnitude that reported in other material systems. Our measurements were
conducted at microwave frequencies (f=9.2-11.2 GHz) in a 2DEG with a high dc
mobility $\mu$ = $7\times10^6$ cm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$, in a hollow waveguide at
low-magnetic field (B &lt; 200 mT). Near-total Faraday rotation is attributed to
the Hall effect with weak radiative coupling to the 2DEG in the inertial,
collisionless regime, $\omega \tau \gg 1$, where $\tau$ is the charge transport
scattering time. A conducting iris was used to realize weak radiative coupling.
Under these conditions, Faraday rotation is strongly enhanced away from the
dissipation peak at cyclotron resonance. Our work demonstrates that the
classical Hall effect could be ideally suited for the implementation of ideal
non-reciprocal devices.

Magnetization, torque magnetometry, specific heat and nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) are used to study the high field intermediate phase between the
1/3-magnetization plateau and polarized state in the quantum Ising
antiferromagnet Rb$_2$Co(SeO$_3$)$_2$ with a triangular lattice. The magnetic
phase diagram with the magnetic field up to 30 T is mapped by the comprehensive
experimental data. The "up-up-down" (UUD) spin configuration of the
1/3-magnetization plateau state is identified by NMR spectral analysis. At
higher magnetic fields, this UUD structure persist to the intermediate phase,
which is finally destroyed in the polarized state. This observation supplies
unambiguous spectroscopic evidence for the absence of proposed high field spin
supersolid phase. The high-field phase diagram of this quantum magnet proximate
to the Ising-anisotropy limit contradicts with that proposed by theoretical
studies.

### Towards effective models for low-dimensional cuprates: From ground state Hamiltonian reconstruction to spectral functions

Understanding which minimal effective model captures the essential physics of
cuprates is a key step towards unraveling the mechanism behind high-$T_c$
superconductivity. Recent measurements of the dynamical spin structure factor
(DSF) in cuprate ladder compounds have indicated the presence of a large
effective attraction in the single-band Hubbard model, possibly mediated by
phonons. Here, we demonstrate that similar DSF features can also be captured by
$t$-$J$ descriptions with or even without any attractive term. Motivated by
this observation, we systematically investigate the strength and origin of
different contributions to the single-band Hamiltonians by downfolding either
from the three-band Emery model or the electron-phonon coupled Hubbard-Holstein
model. For one-dimensional systems, we find that the extended versions of both
single-band descriptions can reproduce the experimentally observed DSF
signatures. Finally, we extend our analysis to two dimensions by comparing
two-hole correlation functions for the different single-band models. Our
results provide new insights into the long-standing question of which
single-band Hamiltonian can capture the essential physics of cuprates.

### Electric-field Control of Giant Ferronics

Ferrons are quantum excitations of electric polarization in ferroelectrics
and electric analogues of magnons but have lacked direct experimental
verification at room temperature. We harness the coupling of soft phonons and
ferroelectric order in layered NbOX2 (X = I, Br, Cl) to generate, detect, and
control giant ferrons, creating a new class of ultralow-power, chip-scale
terahertz (THz) sources. Multiple ferron modes produce intense, narrowband THz
emission with quality factors up to 228 and radiation efficiencies up to five
orders of magnitude greater than state of the art semiconductor emitters.
Resonant excitation of a high-Q ferron mode achieves efficiencies two orders of
magnitude higher than intense lithium niobate THz sources. We further
demonstrate direct, non-volatile electric-field control of ferron oscillations.
These findings provide evidence for multiple ferrons and establish Ferronics as
a foundational platform for light- and field-driven control of quantum order,
with broad impact on ultrafast electronics, photonics, quantum technologies,
and next-generation wireless communication.

The Hubbard model, despite its simplicity, is remarkably successful at
describing numerous many-body phenomena. However, due to the small class of
problems which can be solved exactly, there has been substantial interest in
quantum simulations of extended Hubbard models to in turn, simulate materials
and the interaction-driven phases they host. Here, we study small clusters of
molecular anions of 3,4,9,10-perylene tetracarboxylic dianhydride on NaCl
bilayers on Ag(111) using non-contact Atomic Force Microscopy, Electrostatic
Force Spectroscopy, and Scanning Tunnelling Microscopy and Spectroscopy, and
show that the occupation and transition energies are well described by an
extended Hubbard model. In particular, asymmetric clusters of four molecules
require the addition of differing inter-site electrostatic interaction terms
and on-site potentials, as well as asymmetric hoping terms. With $t&lt;&lt;U$,
occupation asymmetry is driven by these terms, independent of U. The good
agreement between the model and the data indicate such molecular anion clusters
could be used to probe larger systems and a more varied phase space of
realistic fermionic Hubbard models.

We investigate the nature of low-energy excitations in a spin chain with
antiferrmomagnetic nearest-neighbor $J_1$, next-nearest-neighbor $J_2$, and
three-site $J_3$ interactions using the time-dependent density matrix
renormalization group and the single mode approximation techniques. In the
absence of the $J_2$ interaction, we identify clear distinctions in the
spectral functions in the fully dimerized phase across the exactly dimerized
line for different magnitudes of the spins. In contrast to the spin-$1/2$
chain, where the spinon continuum dominates the spectral functions, the magnon
modes are prominent in the spectral functions of the spin-$1$ and spin-$3/2$
chains. Through single mode approximation and valence bond solid approaches, we
disentangle magnon and spinon contributions to the spectral functions. After
including the $J_2$ interactions, for the spin-$1$ chain we trace the evolution
of the dynamical structure factor along the phase transition line between the
Haldane phase and the fully dimerized phase. We find that the excitation
spectrum is a continuum along this line and the spectral gap closes as the
order of the transition changes from first order to second order. Along the
line of first-order transitions, the spinon-like domain walls are deconfined,
and the model exhibits their confinement into discrete bound states away from
the transition line. A similar phenomenon occurs in the spin-$3/2$ chain across
the phase transition between partially dimerized to fully dimerized phases,
revealing a universal spinon confinement phenomenon across first-order phase
transitions. This study presents the dynamical structure factor corresponding
to the ground state phase diagram and establishes a unified quasiparticle
framework for understanding the fundamental nature of excitations across
distinct quantum phases in frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$ Heisenberg spin chains.

within these amorphous complexions and how local structure is altered. High
resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy and elemental analysis are
used to study both grain boundaries and interphase boundaries, with chemical
partitioning observed for both. Notably, the amorphous-crystalline transition
region is observed to be enriched in certain dopant species and depleted of
others as compared to the interior of the amorphous complexions. This chemical
patterning can be explained in terms of the elemental preference for ordered or
disordered grain boundary environments. As only a qualitative measure of
structural short-range order can be obtained with nanobeam electron diffraction
for these specimens, atomistic simulations with a custom-built machine learning
interatomic potential are then used to probe how dopant patterning affects
local structural state. Increased grain boundary chemical complexity is found
to result in a more disordered complexion structure, with segregation to the
amorphous-crystalline transition regions driving changes in local structure
that are sensitive to dopant ratios. As a whole, the intimate connection
between local chemistry and order in amorphous interfacial complexions is
demonstrated, opening the door for microstructural engineering within the
amorphous complexions themselves.

The purpose of this paper is to formulate a kinetic theory describing
transport properties of electrons in a uniform magnetic field of arbitrary
magnitude. Exposing an electronic system to a constant magnetic field quenches
its energy bands into a series of discrete energy levels, known as Landau
levels. The Landau-level states, exact solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation
in a constant background magnetic field, are natural and suitable basis to use,
especially, for the investigation of strong-magnetic-field phenomena. Starting
from the Keldysh formalism, we derive the quantum kinetic equation from the
Landau-level basis. As an illustration, we apply the kinetic equation to
calculate the electrical conductivity of a two-dimensional electron gas exposed
to a perpendicular magnetic field.

- **TL;DR**: 通过XAS和XMCD技术研究BaCo₂(AsO₄)₂的电子结构，发现CoO₆八面体存在显著三角畸变，t₂g空穴主要局域在a₁g轨道，结构畸变对磁性质有重要影响

We conducted x-ray absorption (XAS) and magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD)
measurements at the Co $L_{2,3}$ edges on single crystals of the Kitaev
candidate honeycomb lattice compound BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$. The measurements
employed the inverse partial fluorescence yield technique, which is ideal for
acquiring reliable x-ray absorption spectra from highly insulating samples,
enabling precise quantitative analysis. Our experimental results revealed a
significant linear dichroic signal, indicating strong trigonal distortion in
the CoO$_{6}$ octahedra in BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$. We performed a detailed
analysis of the experimental XAS and XMCD spectra using a full-multiplet
configuration-interaction cluster model. This analysis unveiled that the
$t_{2g}$ hole density is predominantly localized in the $a_{1g}$ orbital.
Through XMCD sum rules and theoretical calculations, we quantified both the
spin and orbital magnetic moments. Our study demonstrates that the local
electronic structure of the CoO$_{6}$ octahedra displays an effective trigonal
distortion of approximately $-0.114$ eV. This distortion is larger than the Co
$3d$ spin-orbit coupling constant, emphasizing the crucial impact of local
structural distortions on the electronic and magnetic properties of
BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$.

Domain switching is the cornerstone of ferroelectric materials. Most
associated functionalities can be tuned via domain switching, including but not
limited to piezoelectricity, thermal conductivity, domain wall conductivity and
topological structures. However, achieving the full potential of reversible
ferroelectric domain switching is restricted by the incomplete access to the
entire ferroelectric texture space, as well as the memory effects and energy
dissipation associated with the hysteretic nature of ferroelectrics. The
manipulation of domain switching behaviour is moderately attainable in
epitaxial heterostructures by exploiting the valence or lattice mismatch at
heterointerfaces, which is generally constrained by the necessity for two
dimensional architectures. In this study, domain-engineered bulk ferroelectric
heterostructures (DE-BFH), constructed via elemental partitioning, are employed
to unleash full potential of bulk ferroelectrics, providing comprehensive
control of domain switching characteristics and adjustable reversibility within
the entire range of ferroelectric texture space. Exemplar DE-BFH ceramics
exhibit unprecedented enhancement in reversible electrostrain and stability in
both axial and shear modes, including a record high peak to peak shear strain
up to 0.9% at intermediate field levels, confirmed by digital image correlation
measurements and in-situ synchrotron XRD studies. The advancement of domain
switching behaviour in DE-BFH could also promote development of new types of
lead-free piezoelectric devices, including actuators, energy harvesters,
multiple state memory devices, and domain wall switch. Moreover, design concept
of DE-BFH could contribute to the creation of distinctive ferroelastic,
ferromagnetic, and multiferroic materials by broadening its scope to the entire
ferroic family, encompassing polycrystalline, single-crystal, and thin-film
forms.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种准经典格林函数方法，用于描述量子系统作为自身环境的不可逆但幺正动力学，扩展了之前的工作到非微扰区域，能够描述从短散射时间到多体海森堡时间的整个热化动力学过程。

We introduce a quasiclassical Green function approach describing the unitary
yet irreversible dynamics of quantum systems effectively acting as their own
environment. Combining a variety of concepts of quantum many-body theory,
notably the nonlinear $\sigma$-model of disordered systems, the $G
\Sigma$-formalism for strong correlations, and real time path integration, the
theory is capable of describing a wide range of system classes and disorder
models. It extends previous work beyond perturbation theory (in inverse Hilbert
space dimensions), enabling a description of thermalization dynamics from short
scattering times, through the onset of ergodicity at an effective `Thouless
time', up to the many-body Heisenberg time. We illustrate the approach with two
case studies, (i) a brickwork model of unitarily coupled quantum circuits with
and without conserved symmetries, and (ii) an array of capacitively coupled
quantum dots. Using the spectral form factor as a test observable, we find good
agreement with numerical simulations. We present our formalism in a
self-contained and pedagogical manner, aiming to provide a transferable toolbox
for the first-principles description of many-body chaotic quantum systems in
regimes of strong entanglement.

The honeycomb magnet $\alpha$-RuCl$_{3}$ has been a leading candidate for
realizing the Kitaev quantum spin liquid (QSL), but its intrinsic spin dynamics
have remained obscured by crystal twinning. Here we apply biaxial anisotropic
strain to detwin $\alpha$-RuCl$_{3}$ single crystals and directly visualize the
intrinsic magnetic excitations using inelastic neutron scattering. We discover
that the low-energy spin waves emerge from the $M$ points -- transverse to the
magnetic Bragg peaks -- providing direct evidence of anisotropic magnetic
interactions in $\alpha$-RuCl$_{3}$. The intrinsic spin-wave spectrum imposes
stringent constraints on the extended Kitaev Hamiltonian, yielding a refined,
quantitatively consistent set of exchange couplings for the zigzag ground state
and its low-energy dynamics. Above the magnon band, we uncover broad excitation
continua: while a twofold-symmetric feature near 6 meV at $\Gamma$ is
consistent with bimagnon scattering, the dominant spectral weight forms a
sixfold-symmetric continuum extending up to $\sim 16$ meV that cannot be
explained by conventional magnons. This strongly supports the presence of
fractionalized excitations-a hallmark of Kitaev QSL physics. Our findings
establish biaxial strain as a powerful symmetry-breaking probe to access the
intrinsic spin dynamics of Kitaev materials and provide critical benchmarks for
refining theoretical models of quantum magnetism in $\alpha$-RuCl$_{3}$.

Polar topology, an analogue of the magnetic topology, serves as a large
playground for exotic physical phenomena with a wide range of multifunctional
applications. Polar vortices and skyrmions are representative polar topologies
that have been predicted to significantly enhance the functionality and
information density of nanoelectronic devices due to their ultrasmall
dimensions. Despite these advantages, the practical realization of polar
topologies in devices is impeded by the intrinsic challenges associated with
their controlled motion and manipulation. Therefore, harnessing vortex
manipulation-such as motion, on demand creation, annihilation, and shape
transformation-is essential for practical device integration. However, vortex
motion is often challenged by intrinsic physical limitations in collective
lattice distortions and strong pinning effects from the surrounding
environment, which remains elusive. In this study, we present real time
observation of vortex motion in PbTiO3/SrTiO3 heterostructures, achieved
through the application of localized pulsed electric fields and trailing bias
fields from a conductive tip. Notably, the vortices exhibit reversible motion
in response to the field direction. Furthermore, by precisely manoeuvring the
conductive Atomic-Force-Microscopy tip along specific trajectories, we achieved
controlled vortex reshaping, with reconfigured vortices showing remarkable
stability over extended periods. This underline physical mechanism is further
pinpointed by phase-field simulations, which revealed that the motion of the
vortex boundary is controlled through the switching of the zigzag patterns of
the vortex core. This study highlights the feasibility of harnessing vortex
dynamics through external stimuli, advancing the fundamental physical
understanding and prospects for next-generation polar vortex-based
nanoelectronic devices.

### Magnetic inertia induced spin-wave dispersion in two-sublattice ferromagnets

- **TL;DR**: 这篇论文研究了包含magnetic inertia tensor的双子粒磁性系统的磁波谱，发现了领光子带与惯性子带的交叉现象，以及通过惯性调控实现非互逆磁波谱的新机制。

Magnetic inertial dynamics has recently been predicted and experimentally
observed in two-sublattice ferromagnets such as CoFeB and NiFe permalloy. In
this work, we investigate the spin-wave spectrum of such systems by
incorporating the full magnetic inertia tensor. Decomposing the tensor into its
symmetric and antisymmetric components allows us to identify isotropic,
anisotropic, and chiral contributions to the magnetic inertia. Using linear
spin-wave theory, we find that the spectrum consists of two precessional magnon
bands and two inertial magnon bands. Remarkably, the upper precessional magnon
band crosses the lower inertial magnon band within the Brillouin zone. We show
that both cross-sublattice inertia and chiral inertia provide effective tuning
knobs for these magnon band structures. Furthermore, our results reveal that
the inertial spin-wave spectrum becomes nonreciprocal along directions where
the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction is finite. On the other hand, a
nonreciprocal spin-wave spectrum can also be engineered through chiral inertia,
even in the absence of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. These findings open
avenues for engineering nonreciprocal magnonic devices and ultrafast spintronic
applications through control of magnetic inertia.

Single-crystalline yttrium iron garnet (YIG) thin films (&lt; 100 nm) form the
backbone of magnonics, owing to the record-low losses affecting their
magnetization dynamics. However, thin epitaxial YIG has mostly been
investigated under ambient temperatures, limited by the paramagnetic losses
occurring at low temperatures due to the gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG)
substrates required for epitaxial growth. Driven by a growing interest in
magnonic devices that can operate in cryogenic conditions and address quantum
information applications, there is a strong need for iron garnet epitaxial
films grown on diamagnetic substrates that can maintain low losses at low
temperatures. In this work, we use liquid phase epitaxy (LPE) to grow ultrathin
films of strained YIG on a commercial diamagnetic substrate, yttrium scandium
gallium garnet (YSGG). We investigate their magnetization dynamics in the 3-300
K temperature range, and compare them to equivalent films grown on paramagnetic
GGG. We demonstrate for LPE YIG on YSGG substrates a ferromagnetic resonance
linewidth below 1 mT at 3 K, together with a very weak temperature and
frequency dependence of the losses. The growth of YIG/YSGG by LPE provides a
straightforward approach to producing iron garnet thin films for use in
low-temperature investigations.

### Topological energy pumping in a quasi-periodically driven four-level system

We investigate a quasi-periodically driven four-level system that serves as a
temporal analog of topological phenomena found in four-band models with
intertwined spin and orbital degrees of freedom. Under a two-tone drive in the
strong-driving regime, the system realizes a two-dimensional synthetic Floquet
lattice, thus facilitating the realization of topological energy pumping. For a
temporal quantum spin Hall insulator, we find that the rates of emission and
absorption of energy between the two drives are not exactly opposite for a
given band. However, when contributions from two chiral symmetric partner bands
are added, they become exactly opposite. This quantized rate of energy exchange
is a direct consequence of propagating edge modes in the real-space model,
which we further characterize by computing the spin-Chern number.
Interestingly, our analysis yields zero rate of exchange of energy between the
drives for a temporal higher-order topological insulator, suggesting the
presence of localized corner modes that we characterize by the mid-gap Wannier
spectra. Finally, we demonstrate that the perfect (imperfect) nature of the
fidelity during the time-evolution of the system serves as a characteristic
signature of a topological (trivial) phase.

Despite sharing a common lattice structure, monolayer M$_2$X$_2$ compounds
realize quantum anomalous Hall phases with distinct Chern numbers, a striking
phenomenon that has not been fully exploared. Combining first-principles
calculations with symmetry analysis and tight-binding models, we identify two
generic band-inversion mechanisms governed by the orbital composition and
symmetry representations of 3$d$ states near the Fermi level. When
$d_{xz}/d_{yz}$ orbtials dominate, a doubly degenerate $\Gamma$-point inversion
yields $C=1$; otherwise, inversions occur along $\Gamma$-X and $\Gamma$-Y at
four $C_4$-related momenta, whose Berry-curvature contributions add to give
$C=2$, distinct from scenarios relying on multiple bands inversions at a single
$\mathbf{k}$ point. The same mechanism consistently explains related
two-dimensional systems, including LiFeSe, KTiSb, MgFeP, and Janus M$_2$X$_2$
derivatives. The mechanism provide practical guidance for screening and
engineering tunable high-Chern-number insulators.

We investigate the interplay of chiral anomaly and dissipation in one -
dimensional Dirac semimetal. For definiteness we consider the Su Schrieffer
Heeger (SSH) model, which on the language of lattice field theory represents 1
D Wilson fermions. We employ the non-equilibrium Keldysh Green function
formalism, and calculate the chiral imbalance and electric conductivity in the
presence of energy dissipation, revealing how these observables are connected
to the chiral anomaly. By systematically incorporating dissipation effects into
the Keldysh framework, we demonstrate how the anomaly-induced contributions
manifest in both axial charge density and electric current.

This study clarifies the hydrogen embrittlement (HE) behavior in a 1.5 GPa
ferrite-martensite dual-phase (DP) steel. Hydrogen pre-charging (3.8 mass ppm
diffusible hydrogen), followed by slow strain tensile testing (10-4 s-1),
resulted in a brittle fracture at 900 MPa within the elastic regime.
Fractographic studies indicated that surface crack initiation consists of
intergranular and quasi-cleavage morphology; site-specific transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) investigations revealed sub-surface secondary crack
blunting by ferrite. A mixed-mode morphology consisting of ductile and brittle
features was observed adjacent to crack initiation. It differs from the
previous investigation of uncharged DP steel, wherein a predominant brittle
fracture was observed. Following significant crack growth, the pre-charged
specimen exhibited predominant brittle fracture; site-specific TEM and
transmission Kikuchi diffraction studies revealed {100} ferrite cleavage
cracking. Electron backscatter diffraction studies were performed on the
cross-sectional cracks. We explain the HE via hydrogen-induced fast fracture
mechanism. During loading, hydrogen diffuses to the prior austenite grain
boundary, resulting in hydrogen-induced decohesion. Subsequent hydrogen
diffusion to the crack tip promotes brittle fracture at high crack velocity
(&gt;Vcrit). The high crack velocity effectively inhibits crack blunting via
dislocation emission, ensuring sustained brittle crack growth even after
hydrogen depletion at the crack tip, resulting in {100} ferrite cleavage
cracking. Based on TEM observations, we explain the formation of river pattern
features on the {100} cleavage surface.

### Ferroelectricity in antiferromagnetic wurtzite nitrides

Wurtzite-type nitrides have recently emerged as promising candidates for
ferroelectric applications, yet their magnetic counterparts remain largely
unexplored. Here, we establish MnSiN$_2$ and MnGeN$_2$ as aristotypes of a new
multiferroic wurtzite family that simultaneously exhibits ferroelectricity and
antiferromagnetism. These Mn(II)-based nitrides crystallize in polar structures
and display robust G-type antiferromagnetism at room temperature.
First-principles calculations reveal that nonmagnetic analogs incorporating Zn
and Mg possess high polarization reversal barriers (0.735 and 0.683 eV per
formula unit) and wide band gaps (4.0 and 4.8 eV), making them ideal
ferroelectric candidates. In contrast, MnSiN$_2$ and MnGeN$_2$ exhibit strong
antiferromagnetic exchange interactions (5--9 meV per Mn site) and moderate
band gaps (1.6 and 1.0 eV), with reversal barriers of 0.963 and 0.460 eV per
formula unit, respectively. Despite their limited magnetoelectric coupling, we
show this family of Type-1 multiferroics exhibits altermagnetic spin splitting
which reverses sign upon polarization switching. By strategically substituting
alkaline-earth metals, we engineer multiple materials with coexisting
switchable polarization, spin texture, and magnetic order. These findings open
new avenues for the design of nitride-based altermagnetic multiferroics,
offering a platform for integrated antiferromagnetic spintronic devices.

Altermagnets, featuring non-relativistic spin splitting, have drawn enormous
attention due to their intriguing properties. Here, we investigate the effects
of shining bicircularly polarized light (BCL) on altermagnets with Rashba
spin-orbit coupling. We discover a remarkable tunability of topology,
spin-textures, and Fermi surfaces of altermagnets by means of BCL illumination,
going beyond monochromatic light. We illustrate a cascade of topological phase
transitions controllable by BCL and demonstrate how these transitions are
reflected in the anomalous Hall response of the altermagnet. Furthermore, we
show that the spin-textures and Fermi surfaces can be directly tuned by the
relative phase of the BCL, stemming from the underlying symmetry changes. Our
findings can pave the way for effectively controlling altermagnetic materials
with structured light.

### An Approach to the Quantum Hall Effect in Three- Dimensional Electron Systems

We present a theoretical framework to describe the integer quantum Hall
effect (IQHE) in three-dimensional (3D) electron systems. This extends our
previous single-electron approach, which was successfully applied to
two-dimensional (2D) systems such as semiconductor quantum wells and graphene,
where insights provided into both the IQHE and the fractional quantum Hall
effect (FQHE). Starting from the graphene model, where the unconventional
sequence of Hall plateaux, 2(2n+1), naturally emerges from Landau quantization,
we generalize the formulation to 3D semimetals with low carrier density and
high mobility, where recent experiments have reported signatures of the QHE.
For 3D systems, the model accounts for strong band anisotropy by introducing an
effective correction to the cyclotron frequency, and, also by considering large
effective gyromagnetic factor, as observed in semimetallic materials. From the
calculated density of states and carrier concentration, we derive semiclassical
expressions for the diagonal and Hall conductivities. The resulting Hall
conductivity exhibits quantized values in agreement with theoretical
predictions and experimental observations of 3D quantum Hall states.
Simulations reproduce both Hall plateaux and Shubnikov de Haas oscillations
under realistic parameter sets. Our results demonstrate that the IQHE in 3D
semimetals can be understood as a natural extension of the single-electron
Landau quantization framework originally developed for 2D systems. This
provides a unified picture of quantum magnetotransport across dimensions,
highlighting the crucial role of low carrier density and high mobility. The
model further suggests new avenues for analyzing thermodynamic and transport
properties in 3D systems under quantum Hall conditions.

low-power spintronics, is fundamentally challenged by the long-standing
trade-off between ferromagnetic ordering and indirect exchange interactions in
insulators. Ionic evolution offers tempting opportunities for accessing exotic
magnetoelectric states and physical functionality beyond conventional doping
paradigm via tailoring the charge-lattice-orbital-spin interactions. Here, we
showcase the precise magneto-ionic control over magnetoelectric states in LSMO
system, delicately delivering silicon-compatible weakly ferromagnetic insulator
state above room temperature. Of particular note is the decoupling of
ion-charge-spin interplay in correlated LSMO system, a primary obstacle in
clarifying underlying physical origin, with this process concurrently giving
rise to an emergent intermediate state characterized by a weakly ferromagnetic
half-metallic state. Benefiting from the SrTiO3 buffer layer as epitaxial
template to promote interfacial heterogeneous nucleation, hydrogenation enables
diverse magnetoelectric states in LSMO integrated on silicon, fully compatible
with traditional semiconductor processing. Assisted by theoretical calculations
and spectroscopic techniques, hydrogen-induced magnetoelectric transitions in
LSMO are driven by band-filling control and suppression in double exchange
interaction. Our work not only defines a novel design paradigm for exploring
exotic quantum states in correlated system, with transformative potential for
spintronics, but also fundamentally unveils the physical origin behind ionic
evolution via disentangling the ion-charge-spin coupling.

- **TL;DR**: 研究发现1T-TiSe2存在7种近简并的2×2×2电荷密度波相，支持165K处可能存在第二次相变，提出了165-200K之间的新中间CDW有序相

Transition metal dichalcogenides have been actively studied for their
intriguing charge density wave (CDW) formations and their impacts on material
properties. Among these, 1T-TiSe$_2$ is well-known to exhibit a
2$\times$2$\times$2 CDW state transition at 200 K, but its true ground state
nature remains under debate. In this study, we investigate possible CDW states
in 1T-TiSe$_2$ and their consequences for transport properties by employing
first-principles electronic structure calculations and angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy. We identify seven distinct types of
2$\times$2$\times$2 CDW phases, most of which have not been reported
previously. All of these phases are nearly degenerate in energy with each other
($&lt; 1.41$ meV per formula unit). Using the band unfolding technique, we compare
the electronic band structures of these CDW phases with experimental
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy data. Our findings support the
presence of a possible second phase transition at 165 K and suggest a new
intermediate CDW order between 165 and 200 K that was previously unexplored.
This result provides a possible resolution to the conflict between previous
reports on the ground state symmetry of 1T-TiSe$_2$, and opens a viable route
to phase engineering of 1T-TiSe$_2$ for functional applications.

Indium selenide attracts the interest due to its outstanding electronic and
optical properties which are potentially prospective in view of applications in
electronic and photonic devices. Most of the polymorphic crystal phases of this
semiconductor belong to the family of two-dimensional van der Waals
semiconductors. In this study optically active indium selenide crystal phase
heterostructures are fabricated by molecular beam epitaxy in a well-controlled
manner. It is demonstrated that by changing the growth conditions one may
obtain either {\gamma}-InSe, or {\gamma}-In2Se3, or \b{eta}-yIn2Se3 crystal
phases. The most promising crystal phase heterostructures from the point of
view of photonic applications is found to be the {\gamma}-InSe/{\gamma}-In2Se3
heterostructure. An intense optical emission from this heterostructure appears
in the near infrared spectral range. The emission energy can be tuned over 250
meV by changing {\gamma}-InSe layer thickness which is explained by the quantum
size effect. The optically active indium selenide crystal phase
heterostructures represent, therefore, an interesting platform for the design
of light sources and detectors in the near infra-red. The use of molecular beam
epitaxy for this purpose ensures that the structures are fabricated on large
surfaces opening the possibility for the design of device prototypes by using
lithography methods

- **TL;DR**: 新的时间分辨垂直-水平温度梯度法(t-resolved T(t)-HVOT)用于研究相变过程中热电超导效应的增强机制，发现巨大和轻微增强都非本质现象

We propose a new time (t)-resolved method of both vertical- and
horizontal-temperature gradients in an orthogonal configuration (t-resolved
T(t)-HVOT) to have real interpretations of the enhancement in thermoelectric
Seebeck effect (SE) observed during the structural phase transition. We apply
our new method to superionic-state semiconductors of p-type Cu2Se and n-type
Ag2S. The experimental data differentiate the two types of enhancements during
the phase transition: a colossal SE (Scolossal), exhibiting an enormous value
of up to 5 mV/K, and a slight enhancement in SE (Sstructure), approximately
1.5-2.0 times larger than those in the absence of the phase transition. We
provide critical insights that both enhancements in SE arising during the
structural phase transition are not intrinsic phenomena.

Computational hardware designed to mimic biological neural networks holds the
promise to resolve the drastically growing global energy demand of artificial
intelligence. A wide variety of hardware concepts have been proposed, and among
these, photonic approaches offer immense strengths in terms of power
efficiency, speed and synaptic connectivity. However, existing solutions have
large circuit footprints limiting scaling potential and they miss key
biological functions, like inhibition. We demonstrate an artificial
nano-optoelectronic neuron with a circuit footprint size reduced by at least a
factor of 100 compared to existing technologies and operating powers in the
picowatt regime. The neuron can deterministically receive both exciting and
inhibiting signals that can be summed and treated with a non-linear function.
It demonstrates several biological relevant responses and memory timescales, as
well as weighting of input channels. The neuron is compatible with commercial
silicon technology, operates at multiple wavelengths and can be used for both
computing and optical sensing. This work paves the way for two important
research paths: photonic neuromorphic computing with nanosized footprints and
low power consumption, and adaptive optical sensing, using the same
architecture as a compact, modular front end

- **TL;DR**: 本研究通过ARPES和DFT计算揭示了3R α-In2Se3的独特电子结构特征，包括价带反转、间接带隙和表面电子积累层

Two-dimensional (2D) ferroelectric (FE) materials offer a large variety of
electronic properties depending on chemical composition, number of layers and
stacking-order. Among them, alpha-In2Se3 has attracted much attention due to
the promise of outstanding electronic properties, attractive quantum physics,
in- and out-of-plane ferroelectricity and high photo-response. Precise
experimental determination of the electronic structure of rhombohedral (3R)
alpha-In2Se3 is needed for a better understanding of potential properties and
device applications. Here, combining angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy
(ARPES) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we demonstrate that
3R alpha-In2Se3 phase exhibits a robust inversion of the valence band
parabolicity at the Gamma point forming a bow-shaped dispersion with a depth of
140 +- 10 meV between the valence band maximum (VBM) along the GammaK direction
of the Brillouin zone (BZ). Moreover, we unveil an indirect band gap of about
1.25 eV, as well as a highly electron doping of approximatively 5.1012
electrons per cmsquare at the surface. This leads to surface band bending and
the formation of a prominent electron accumulation layer. These findings allow
a deeper understanding of the rhombohedral alpha-In2Se3 electronic properties
underlying the potential of III/VI semiconductors for electronic and photonic
technologies.

We present a theoretical study of spin Hall phenomena in a nanoribbon made of
a two-dimensional square lattice with Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit
coupling. We show that the nanoribbon can give rise to a number of additional
spin degeneracy points as well as anti-crossing points, apart from the $\Gamma$
point, between two nearest sub-bands. We compute the spin Hall conductivity and
demonstrate that it diverges and gives rise to a resonance when chemical
potential passes through those spin-degenerate or anti-crossing points.
Contrary to the previous studies, here such resonance emerges even without any
external perturbation like magnetic field or light. In addition, we examine the
influence of anisotropy in Rashba and Dresselhaus interactions, as well as
finite-temperature effects, and show that the inter subband resonance remains
robust. Finally, we also investigate the signature of such additional spin
degeneracy and anti-crossing points in the longitudinal conductance by using
retarded Green function approach in lattice model. The peculiar features of the
bands are reflected in the longitudinal conductance, which takes quantized
values of $2n e^{2}/{h},$ where $n$ denotes the number of bands occupied by the
chemical potential with each band having spin split sub-bands.

Ferroelectric thin films under epitaxial strain exhibit a variety of
vortex-like topological polarization textures. To analyze them, we build on the
Ginzburg-Landau-Devonshire framework and extend the previously introduced
soft-domain approach. This formulation provides a compact variational
theoretical description of polarization morphologies in strained PbTiO$_3$
films. It yields phase diagrams as a function of temperature, strain, and
thickness, and clarifies the morphological structure of emergent topological
states. The method is computationally efficient and offers practical guidance
for experimental studies of ferroelectric nanostructures.

### Symmetry-enforced Moiré Topology

Topological flat bands in two-dimensional (2D) moir\'e materials have emerged
as promising platforms for exploring the interplay between topology and
correlation effects. However, realistic calculations of moir\'e band topology
using density functional theory (DFT) are computationally inefficient due to
the large number of atoms in a single moir\'e unit cell. In this work, we
propose a systematic scheme to predict the topology of moir\'e bands from
atomic symmetry data and moir\'e symmetry group, both of which can be
efficiently extracted from DFT. Specifically, for $\Gamma$-valley electron
gases, we find that certain combinations of atomic symmetry data and moir\'e
symmetry groups can enforce nontrivial band topology in the low-energy moir\'e
bands, as long as the moir\'e band gap is smaller than the atomic band
splitting at the moir\'e Brillouin zone boundary. This symmetry-enforced
nontrivial moir\'e topology, including both topological insulators and
topological semimetals, is robust against various material-specific details
such as the precise form and strength of the moir\'e potential or the exact
twist angle. By exhaustively scanning all 2D atomic symmetry data and moir\'e
symmetry groups, we identify 197 combinations that can yield symmetry-enforced
nontrivial moir\'e topology, and we verify one such combination using a moir\'e
model with cubic Rashba spin-orbit coupling. Our approach is generalizable to
other valleys and provides a useful guideline for experimental efforts to
discover and design new topologically nontrivial moir\'e materials.

### Non-linear jog-dragging effect on the mobility law of edge dislocations in face-centered cubic nickel

Dislocation jogs have strong effects on dislocation motion that governs the
strain-hardening behavior of crystalline solids, but how to properly account
for their effect in mesoscale models remains poorly understood. We develop a
mobility model for jogged edge dislocations in FCC nickel, based on systematic
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations across a range of jog configurations,
stresses, and temperatures. At low stresses, jogged edge dislocations exhibit
non-linear, thermally activated dragging and a higher Peierls barrier compared
to straight dislocations. Surprisingly, stress-velocity curves for a given jog
configuration across varying temperatures intersect at an invariant point
($\tau_{\rm c}$, $v_{\rm c}$), where $\tau_{\rm c}$ delineates
thermally-activated and phonon-drag regimes and is close to the Peierls stress
($\tau_{\rm p}$). Motivated by this observation, we propose a simple
three-section expression for jogged dislocation mobility, featuring minimal and
physically interpretable parameters. This mobility law offers a realistic
description of jog effects for dislocation dynamics (DD) simulations, improving
their physical fidelity for crystal plasticity predictions.

Martensitic transformations drive a multitude of emerging applications, which
range from high stroke actuation and, mechanocaloric refrigeration, to
thermoelastic energy harvesting. All these applications benefit from faster
transformations, as a high cycle frequency is essential for achieving high
power density. However, systematic investigations of the fast dynamics and
fundamental speed limits of martensitic transformations are scarce. Especially
for ultrashort time transformations, the temperature evolution throughout the
transformation is not measured, which is a substantial shortcoming as
temperature is the intrinsic force driving the transformation. Here, we present
a synchrotron-based time-resolved X-ray diffraction study of a 270 fs
laser-induced martensitic transformation in a Ni-Mn-Ga-based epitaxial thin
film. We observe the transformation from martensite to austenite within about
100 ps, just limited by the synchrotron probe pulse duration. Furthermore, a
full transformation cycle from martensite to austenite and back to martensite
can almost be finished within 5 ns, which is the fastest martensitic
transformation reported so far. Measurements and calculations of the
temperature evolution allow us to analyse the influence of temperature on
transformation time. By time-resolved strain measurements we demonstrate that
in addition to temperature, thermal film stress must be considered as a
competing influence on the martensitic transformation. Our experimental
findings are supported by molecular dynamics simulations with machine learned
force fields adapted to density functional theory calculations. These reveal
that the huge distortion during a martensitic transformation requires the
collective movement of many atoms within the microstructure, which delays the
transformation.

Electron irradiation and annealing treatments are a method of colour
centre/defect creation in diamond. The depth profile of defects created by low
energy 200 keV electrons in single crystal high purity (type II) electronic
grade diamond grown via chemical vapour deposition has been investigated. The
depth profile of monovacancies created was found, using photoluminescence (PL),
to decay exponentially, with decay length $12\pm1$ $\mu$m and production rate
of $(1.1\pm0.2)\times 10 ^{-1}$ V/e$^{-}$/cm at the surface. The depth
distribution of the neutral and negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy
(NV$^{0/-}$) centre, and the 733 nm zero phonon line defect formed during an
isochronal annealing study have also been investigated by PL. The observed NV
profiles, which do not match the vacancy profiles, can be qualitatively
explained in terms of a simple model that includes the formation of vacancy
clusters and the nitrogen-divacancy (NV$_{2}$) defect. The production of
(NV$^{0/-}$) has been assumed to be nitrogen limited, but this paper has shown
that this is not the case, with NVs lost to the production of NV$_{2}$ when the
concentration of vacancies greatly exceeds that of substitutional nitrogen.

Nonreciprocal magnons, characterized by propagation with differing energies
along the k and -k directions, are crucial for modern spintronics applications.
However, their realization in van der Waals layered antiferromagnets remains
elusive. In this letter, we report robust nonreciprocal magnon behavior in
layered honeycomb antiferromagnets VPX3(X =S,Se,Te). Our results demonstrate
that, in addition to their intrinsic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI),
the nonreciprocity of magnons is strongly influenced by the layer number,
interlayer coupling, and magnon-magnon interactions. More importantly, in such
layered antiferromagnets, the magnon nonreciprocity exhibits an asymmetric
periodic dependence on the Neel vector, offering a novel route for
experimentally probing antiferromagnetic order parameters in the 2D limit.

- **TL;DR**: 通过控制光激光偏振方向的技术，识别了二维过渡金属硅化物材料中关键子形成的两种竞争机制：相关形成和双分子形成过程

The optical properties of atomically thin semiconductors are dominated by
excitons, tightly bound electron-hole pairs, which give rise to particularly
rich and remarkable physics. Despite their importance, the microscopic
formation mechanisms of excitons remain very poorly understood due to the
complex interplay of concurrent phenomena occurring on an ultrafast timescale.
Here, we investigate the exciton formation processes in 2D materials based on
transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers using a technique based on the
control of excitation light polarization. It allows us to distinguish between
the two competing models of exciton formation: geminate and bimolecular
formation. The geminate process is the direct formation of the exciton from the
initially photogenerated electron hole pair before the loss of correlation
between them, whereas the bimolecular process corresponds to the random binding
of free electron hole-pairs from the initially photogenerated plasma. These
processes control the exciton formation time. Our findings reveal that the
luminescence intensity is higher by up to 40% for circularly polarized
excitation compared to linearly polarized excitation for laser energy above the
free carrier gap. We show that this spin-dependent exciton emission is a
fingerprint of the bimolecular formation process. Importantly, we observe that
exciton linear polarization (valley coherence) persists even for laser
excitation energies exceeding the gap. We demonstrate that it is the result of
a fraction of excitons formed by a geminate process. This shows that two
formation processes coexist for excitation energies above the gap, where both
mechanisms operate concurrently.

Hybrid structures incorpora1ng both III-nitride and Transi1on Metal
Dichalcogenide (TMD) semiconductors have strong applica1on poten1al for light
harves1ng and optoelectronics. Here we have inves1gated the proper1es of hybrid
structures based on a MoSe2 monolayer coupled to an InGaN quantum well (QW).
The coupling efficiency is controlled by a thin GaN barrier of variable
thickness located between them. Time-integrated and 1me-resolved
micro-photoluminescence experiments show a quenching of the InGaN QW exciton
emission which increases with the decrease of the GaN barrier thickness d: the
PL intensity is reduced by a factor 3 for d=1 nm as a consequence of carrier
transfer to the MoSe2 monolayer. This interplay between the two semiconductors
is confirmed by 1meresolved photoluminescence spectroscopy highligh1ng a clear
reduc1on of the QW exciton life1me in the presence of the monolayer.
Interes1ngly the coupling between the QW and the TMD monolayer is also
demonstrated by measuring op1cally the excitonic transport proper1es in the
quantum well: the exciton diffusion length decreases in the presence of the
MoSe2 monolayer. The measured dependences as a func1on of temperature highlight
the role played by localiza1on effects in the QW. All these results can be well
interpreted by a type II band alignment between the InGaN QW and the MoSe2
monolayer and a tunneling process between the two semiconductors.

- **TL;DR**: 这篇论文提出了一种混合筛选策略，结合UFF力场和PFP u-MLIP机器学习间原子潜力来精准评估MOF的乙烷吸附性能，特别在湿度条件下的吸附选择性。

High-throughput computational screening (HTCS) of gas adsorption in
metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) typically relies on classical generic force
fields such as the Universal Force Field (UFF), which are efficient but often
fail to capture complex host-guest interactions. Universal machine-learned
interatomic potentials (u-MLIPs) offer near-quantum accuracy at far lower cost
than density functional theory (DFT), yet their large-scale application in
adsorption screening remains limited. Here, we present a hybrid screening
strategy that merges Widom insertion Monte Carlo simulations performed with
both UFF and the PreFerred Potential (PFP) u-MLIP to evaluate the adsorption
performance of a large MOF database, using ethylene capture under humid
conditions as a benchmark. From a curated set of MOFs, 88 promising candidates
initially identified using UFF-based HTCS were re-evaluated with the PFP
u-MLIP, benchmarked against DFT calculations to refine adsorption predictions
and assess the role of framework flexibility. We show that PFP u-MLIP is
essential to accurately assess the sorption performance of MOFs involving
strong hydrogen bonding or confinement pockets within narrow pores, effects
poorly captured using UFF. Notably, accounting for framework flexibility
through full unit cell relaxation revealed deviations in ethylene affinity of
up to 20 kJ mol-1, underscoring the impact of guest-induced structural changes.
This HTCS workflow identified seven MOFs with optimal pore sizes, high ethylene
affinity, and high C2H4/H2O selectivity, offering moisture-tolerant performance
for applications from food packaging to trace ethylene removal. Our findings
highlight the importance of accurately capturing host-guest energetics and
framework flexibility, and demonstrate the practicality of incorporating
u-MLIPs into scalable HTCS for identifying top MOF sorbents.

Proximity effects not only complement the conventional methods of designing
materials, but also enable realizing properties that are not present in any
constituent region of the considered heterostructure. Here we reveal an
unexplored altermagnetic proximity effect (AMPE), distinct from its
ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic counterparts. Using first-principles and
model analyses of van der Waals heterostructures based on the prototypical
altermagnet V$_2$Se$_2$O, we show that its hallmark momentum-alternating spin
splitting can be directly imprinted onto adjacent nonmagnetic layers -- a
process we term altermagnetization. This is demonstrated in a monolayer PbO
through characteristic band splitting and real-space spin densities, with
systematic dependence on interlayer spacing and magnetic configuration. We
further predict broader AMPE manifestations: Valley-selective spin splitting in
a monolayer PbS and a topological superconducting phase in monolayer NbSe$_2$,
both inheriting the alternating $k$-space spin texture of the altermagnet.
These results establish AMPE not only as a distinct proximity mechanism, but
also as a powerful method of using altermagnetism in designing emergent
phenomena and versatile applications.

We present a systematic first-principles investigation of linear-response
spin-dependent quantum transport in the van der Waals ferromagnets
Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$, Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$, Fe$_5$GeTe$_2$, and Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$. Using
density functional theory combined with the non-equilibrium Green's function
formalism, we compute their Fermi surfaces, transmission coefficients, and
orbital-projected density of states. All compounds exhibit nearly half-metallic
conductance along the out-of-plane direction. This is characterized by a finite
transmission coefficient for one spin channel and a gap in the other, resulting
in spin polarization values exceeding 90$\%$ in the bulk. Notably,
Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$ displays the ideal half-metallic behavior, with the Fermi energy
located deep in the spin-down transmission gap. We further show that this high
spin polarization is preserved in bilayer magnetic tunnel junctions, which
exhibit a large tunnel magnetoresistance of the order of several hundred
percent. This findings underscore the promise of these materials, and in
particular of Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$, for spintronics applications.
