- **TL;DR**: 该论文通过研究Kitaev梯子模型，解释了量子自旋液体中热导率消失的现象，指出即使没有外部缺陷或无序，分数化导致的瞬态局域化也会抑制输运响应。

Several candidate materials for gapless quantum spin liquids exhibit a
vanishing thermal conductivity, which is at odds with theoretical predictions.
Here, we show that a suppressed response can arise due to transient
localization from fractionalization, even in the absence of extrinsic defects
or disorder. Concretely, we consider a Kitaev ladder model in a uniform
magnetic field, whose spin degrees of freedom fractionalize into visons and
spinons. For moderate magnetic fields, visons are heavy and act as quasi-static
disorder that induce transient localization of light spinons even in the
translation-invariant model and at zero temperature, which strongly suppresses
the residual conductivity at finite but low frequencies. At ultralow
frequencies the conductivity is restored; however, such scales can be extremely
hard to reach in experiments. Our results identify transient localization as a
signature of fractionalization and provide a framework for interpreting
anomalous transport in gapless spin liquid candidates.

- **TL;DR**: 通过分析反反碱决策模型在反反几何结构上的超稳定状态，证明了匀填充情况下碱化地形重组相变的存在

Geometric frustration lies at the heart of many unconventional quantum phases
in strongly interacting electron systems. Here, we analytically determine the
ground state magnetization of the half-filled Hubbard model on frustrated
geometries where superstable states -- eigenstates which are robust against
frustration -- are manifest. Our results apply to a broad class of lattices,
including those where altermagnetic and superconducting states are known to
emerge. Furthermore, they provide evidence for phase transitions involving a
geometric rearrangement of magnetic correlations in the thermodynamic limit.

- **TL;DR**: 本文通过极化中子散射实验首次直接观测到MnF₂中的磁振子能带分裂和非零手性，证明该材料实际上是altermagnet而非传统反铁磁体

Motivated by possible spintronics applications in antiferromagnets, it was
recently observed that symmetry admits magnets that combine attractive features
of both ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. These systems, dubbed altermagnets,
have been the subject of intense study with direct spectroscopic evidence, from
ARPES and RIXS, techniques reported in a handful of materials in the last year.
Inelastic neutron scattering (INS) is one of the most powerful direct probes of
magnetism and has recently been used to witness a splitting of magnon bands in
MnTe that is compatible with altermagnetism although the nature and origin of
the splitting remain to be fully characterized. However, the full power of
neutron scattering for such systems comes from using polarized neutrons to
measure the chirality of the magnon bands. Such a measurement provides a direct
characterization of altermagnetism directly from the spin wave excitations. In
this article, we present results on MnF$_2$ once thought to be an archetypal
antiferromagnet. We present a polarized INS data that demonstrate the material
is, in fact, altermagnetic. It had long been realized that the magnon bands in
this material should have a weak splitting coming from the long-range dipolar
coupling. Our data is the first to visualize this splitting directly. While the
dipolar splitting on its own is not altermagnetic, using a domain biased
sample, the data reveals a nonzero chirality in the neutron scattering cross
section that reverses sign between the two magnon modes. It is this feature
that clearly demonstrates altermagnetism in MnF$_2$. This finding highlights
the potential for polarized INS to characterize altermagnets not least through
its exquisite sensitivity to fine-structure in the magnon spectrum.

In this work, we investigate the softening of the in-plane transverse
acoustic phonon driven by electronic nematicity in
BaFe$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$ using inelastic X-ray scattering, with a focus on
the optimally doped sample ($x = 0.31$) sample, a system exhibiting signatures
of a putative nematic quantum critical point and minimal disorder among iron
pnictides. We observe only a modest softening of the phonon frequency and no
evidence of critical damping, suggesting that the nematic quantum critical
fluctuations couple only weakly to the lattice from our quantum critical model.
Given the close proximity of the structural and magnetic transition
temperatures in the underdoped sample, which implies that spin-nematic
fluctuations couple strongly to the lattice. We conjecture that the quantum
critical nematic fluctuations are predominantly orbital in origin.

Neuromorphic computing, inspired by biological intelligence, offers a pathway
to revolutionize artificial intelligence (AI) by unifying memory and processing
in an energy-efficient, sustainable framework for data-intensive tasks.
Ferroelectric (FE) materials have emerged as promising candidates for
implementing artificial synapses, yet achieving low-voltage operation in CMOS
back-end compatible devices remains a major challenge. In this work, we
demonstrate that proper tuning of ferro and antiferroelectric phases in
HfO2-ZrO2(HZO) superlattice based capacitors can lead to imprint-free switching
with record switchable polarization (2Pr) of 76 micro Coulomb cm-2 under an
external field of only 2 MV cm-1. The sizable remanent polarization of the
superlattice HZO further enables linear potentiation and depression with an on
to off ratio of 20 within a 3 MV cm-1 bias window. Under pulsed operation, the
devices show robust endurance, either maintaining polarization with less than
10 per cent degradation up to 10^8 cycles or surviving beyond 10^9 cycles with
recoverable fatigue. By elucidating two distinct fatigue mechanisms, this work
highlights strategies for optimizing FE devices to meet the stringent demands
of neuromorphic training applications.

- **TL;DR**: 本文通过CFD-DEM模拟分析水泥粉碎过程，评估了当前模拟技术的局限性和突破可能，以实现对水泥粉碎过程的定量预测能力。

Predicting the outcome of jet-milling based on the knowledge of process
parameters and starting material properties is a task still far from being
accomplished. Given the technical difficulties in measuring thermodynamics,
flow properties and particle statistics directly in the mills, modelling and
simulations constitute alternative tools to gain insight in the process physics
and many papers have been recently published on the subject. An ideal
predictive simulation tool should combine the correct description of
non-isothermal, compressible, high Mach number fluid flow, the correct
particle-fluid and particle-particle interactions and the correct fracture
mechanics of particle upon collisions but it is not currently available. In
this paper we present our coupled CFD-DEM simulation results; while comparing
them with the recent modelling and experimental works we will review the
current understating of the jet-mill physics and particle classification.
Subsequently we analyze the missing elements and the bottlenecks currently
limiting the simulation technique as well as the possible ways to circumvent
them towards a quantitative, predictive simulation of jet-milling.

We report on a scanned superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID)
microscope operating in a cryogen-free cryostat, with the capability of up to
forty RF connections with 20 GHz bandwidth to a device under test. The system
utilizes planar gradiometric DC SQUIDs, which are fully shielded except for a
pair of pickup coils with radii as small as 250 nm and have on chip field coils
allowing for susceptometry. The system noise is 1.3 $\mu\Phi_{0}/\sqrt{Hz}$ at
the base temperature of 3.3 K. The sample temperature is variable and both
magnetometry and susceptibility measurements are simultaneously possible with
the sample temperature above 40 K. Through the use of a cryogenic chip socket
and silicon interposer round trip RF losses to a sample are approximately 15 dB
at 20 GHz. A combination of both active and passive magnetic shielding result
in a residual magnetic field less than 100 nT at the sample location.

### Quantum control of exciton motion in electric field

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种优化二维激子量子控制的搜索方法，通过时间依赖电场精确操控激子的最终位置和速度

We study quantum control of classical motion of a two-dimensional exciton by
optimizing the time-dependent electric field of a stripe-like gate acting on
the exciton and inducing its time-dependent quantum dipole moment. We propose a
search method that significantly reduces computational requirements while
efficiently identifying optimal control parameters. By leveraging this method,
one can precisely manipulate the exciton's final position and velocity over a
specified evolution time. These results can be applied for control of exciton
fluxes and population, and for spatially resolved light emission in
two-dimensional semiconducting structures.

Chatterjee and Diaconis, which rely exclusively on the high-energy behavior,

### Tracking photophysical relaxation in spiropyran with simulated time-resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy

- **TL;DR**: 通过组合非准温动力学模拟和X射线吸收光谱计算，研究了螺吡烟光物理松弛机制，预测C-N键断裂会导致氮K边X射线吸收红移

Spiropyran is a prototype photoswitch that undergoes photoinduced
ring-opening via C-O bond fission. The quantum yield for this photochemical
reaction is low, with photophysical relaxation being the dominant process.
Previous theoretical studies have suggested that photophysical relaxation
proceeds via cleavage and subsequent reformation of a C-N bond. However,
experimental evidence for this mechanism is lacking; most time-resolved studies
have probed in the ultraviolet-visible domain, where C-N bond fission is
unlikely to leave clear signatures. Here, we use non-adiabatic dynamics
simulations in conjunction with X-ray absorption spectroscopic calculations to
investigate the possibility of tracking the photophysical relaxation in
spiropyran with time-resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy at the nitrogen
K-edge. The simulations predict that cleavage of the C-N bond results in a
transient red-shift of the X-ray absorption. These results indicate a potential
experimental route to gain a mechanistic understanding of the efficient
photophysical relaxation that limits the efficiency of spiropyran-based
photochromic systems.

### Kondo echo dynamics of terahertz-pumped heavy fermions

We provide a theoretical framework to describe the nonequilibrium temporal
dynamics of correlated electron systems for realistic system parameters and the
consequent, often exponentially long time scales. It is based on an entirely
integro-differential formulation of time-dependent dynamical mean-field theory,
the noncrossing approximation, and the quantum representation of a driving
electromagnetic field. For heavy-fermion systems, we identify two key
nonequilibrium mechanisms governing their time evolution after a single-cycle
terahertz excitation: transient, instantaneous shift from the Kondo toward the
mixed-valence regime by an enhanced, photoassisted hybridization, and slow
recovery of the heavy-fermion state due to the long Kondo coherence time. This
explains recent time-resolved terahertz spectroscopy experiments
microscopically and establishes the latter as a technique for direct
experimental access to the Kondo coherence time and to the heavy-fermion
quasiparticle weight, central for the classification of heavy-fermion quantum
phase transitions.

### 3D Mapping of Defects and Moiré Corrugations via Electron Ptychography Atomic Coordinate Retrieval

- **TL;DR**: 使用多层电子叠层成像技术以皮米级精度解析了扭曲双层WSe₂的三维原子坐标，揭示了各原子层的曲率、层间距变化、空位位置以及新型结构无序现象

Defects and reconstructions in 2D moir\'e materials cause out-of-plane
deformations which strongly modify their electronic properties but are
difficult to experimentally access. Here, we solve the 3D atomic coordinates of
twisted bilayer WSe$_2$ with picometer-scale accuracy using multislice electron
ptychography (MEP) acquired from a single orientation. The resulting atomic
models individually visualize each of the six atomic planes, revealing the
curvature of each WSe$_2$ layer, variations in the interlayer spacing, and the
3D locations of individual vacancies -- which lie exclusively in the outer Se
planes. We also observe a new, unexpected type of structural disorder
consisting of mixed bending -- and breathing-type moir\'e-induced corrugations
that should strongly impact the emergent electronic properties. Broadly, our
methods generate 3D atom-by-atom models of a 2D heterointerface from data
acquired in about 30 seconds, methods that should unlock routine access to 3D
atomic information in 2D systems and catalyze design methods to control
out-of-plane deformations.

### A unified framework for data-driven construction of stochastic reduced models with state-dependent memory

- **Categories**: physics.comp-ph
- **TL;DR**: 提出一种统一框架，通过数据驱动方法构建带有状态依赖记忆的降维模型，以准确描述高维哈密顿系统的非马尔可夫效应。

We present a unified framework for the data-driven construction of stochastic
reduced models with state-dependent memory for high-dimensional Hamiltonian
systems. The method addresses two key challenges: (\rmnum{1}) accurately
modeling heterogeneous non-Markovian effects where the memory function depends
on the coarse-grained (CG) variables beyond the standard homogeneous kernel,
and (\rmnum{2}) efficiently exploring the phase space to sample both
equilibrium and dynamical observables for reduced model construction.
Specifically, we employ a consensus-based sampling method to establish a shared
sampling strategy that enables simultaneous construction of the free energy
function and collection of conditional two-point correlation functions used to
learn the state-dependent memory. The reduced dynamics is formulated as an
extended Markovian system, where a set of auxiliary variables, interpreted as
non-Markovian features, is jointly learned to systematically approximate the
memory function using only two-point statistics. The constructed model yields a
generalized Langevin-type formulation with an invariant distribution consistent
with the full dynamics. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
framework on a two-dimensional CG model of an alanine dipeptide molecule.
Numerical results on the transition dynamics between metastable states show
that accurately capturing state-dependent memory is essential for predicting
non-equilibrium kinetic properties, whereas the standard generalized Langevin
model with a homogeneous kernel exhibits significant discrepancies.

Interest in Josephson junctions (JJs) has increased rapidly in recent years
not only because of their use in qubits and other quantum devices but also due
to the unique physics supported by the JJs. The advent of various novel quantum
materials for both the barrier region and the superconducting leads has led to
the possibility of adding new functionalities to the JJs. Thus, there is a
growing need for accurate modeling of the JJs and related systems to enable
their predictive control and atomistic level understanding. This review
presents an in-depth discussion of a Green's function-based formalism for
computing supercurrents in JJs. The formulation is tailored for large-scale
atomistic simulations and encompasses both dc and ac supercurrents. We hope
that this review will provide a timely and comprehensive reference for
researchers as well as beginning practitioners interested in
Green's-function-based methods to model supercurrents in JJs.

- **TL;DR**: 基于量子理论研究光谱学与磁测量结合中的凸光子磁响应，发现了包括凸光子带量子几何在内的新的理论项，从而解释了偏压双层石墨烯中理论与实验的越凸光子g因子差异

Combining magnetometry with optical spectroscopy has uncovered novel quantum
phenomena and is emerging as a platform for quantum information science. Yet,
the theory of magnetic response of excitons, correlated electron-hole pairs in
semiconductors, remains incomplete due to insufficient treatment of
electron-hole interaction and topological effects. In biased bilayer graphene,
for instance, theoretical predictions of valley g-factor for p-excitons deviate
from experiment by nearly an order of magnitude. Here, we develop a quantum
theory of exciton orbital magnetic moment that reveals several conceptually new
terms absent in prior theories, including an unforeseen contribution from
exciton band quantum geometry. Our ab initio calculations yield results in
excellent agreement with measurements, establishing the importance of a full
theory including interaction and topological effects for the magnetic response
of excitons.

Exploiting quantum measurements is a promising route for preparation of
correlated quantum states. We use methods from large deviation theory to solve
this problem exactly for a specific system: the deterministic quantum East
circuit with boundary measurements. We show that conditioning on measurement
outcomes generates a long-range correlated state, despite typical trajectories
being trivial. We derive the channel that optimally realizes the rare
measurement trajectories, and establish a formal connection with the Petz
recovery (time-reversal) map. We compute one- and two-point correlation
functions in the conditioned state, revealing finite two-body correlations at
arbitrarily large separations, and an underlying fractal structure, related to
the Sierpi\'nski triangle. These results demonstrate explicitly how boundary
measurements can be used to control bulk properties of a quantum system.

### Exploring the nature of the emergent gauge field in composite-fermion metals: A large-scale microscopic study

- **TL;DR**: 复合费米子金属模型的微观理论计算显示静态结构因子S(q)在q→0极限下呈现q³行为，而非之前预测的q³lnq行为

Field theories of the composite-fermion (CF) metal model it as a Fermi sea of
composite fermions coupled to an emergent gauge field. Within a random phase
approximation, these theories predict that the Landau damping of the gauge
field resulting from its coupling to the low-energy, long-wavelength CF
particle-hole excitations modifies the electrons' density-density correlation
function related to the static structure factor $S(q)$ at wave vector $q$. This
produces a non-analytic correction $\propto q^{3}\ln q$ to $S(q)$ (with the
magnetic length $\ell_{B}=1$). Thanks to the recently developed quaternion
formulation for Jain-Kamilla projection of CF wave functions, the evaluation of
$S(q)$ from the accurate microscopic theory of composite fermions has now
become possible for systems containing as many as $N=900$ CFs, which enables a
reliable determination of the small-$q$ behavior of $S(q)$. We study CF metals
corresponding to electrons at Landau level filling factors $\nu=1/2$ and $1/4$,
and for completeness, also of bosons at $\nu=1$ and $1/3$. In the
$q\rightarrow0$ limit, our microscopic calculation reveals a $q^{3}$ term in
$S(q)$ of the CF metals rather than $q^{3} \ln q$. This behavior is
well-predicted by a model of a non-interacting Fermi sea of dipolar CFs, which
also obtains its coefficient accurately.

(R/S-FMBA), which have been shown to lead to bright room-temperature circularly
polarized luminescence, with the similar achiral 4-fluorobenzylammonium (FBA).
Using density functional theory (DFT) with van der Waals (vdW) corrections, we
study relaxed structures (compared with X-ray diffraction, XRD) and optical
absorption spectra (compared with experiments), as well as bandstructure and
orbital character of transitions. We develop and provide a Python code to
calculate octahedral distortions and compare DFT and XRD results, finding that
vdW corrections are important for accuracy and that DFT overestimates
octahedral tilt angles. (FMBA)$_2$PbBr$_4$ shows among the largest tilt angle
differences (often termed $\Delta \beta$) reported, $14^\circ$, indicating
strong inversion symmetry-breaking which enables its chiral emission. The
lowest-energy optical transitions involve the perovskite only and are polarized
within the layer. This work furthers understanding of structure-property
relations with applications to optoelectronics and spintronics.

The accumulation of helium bubbles at grain boundaries (GBs) critically
degrades the mechanical integrity of structural materials in nuclear reactors.
While GBs act as sinks for radiation-induced defects, their inherent structural
anisotropy leads to complex helium bubble evolution behaviors that remain
poorly understood. This work integrates accelerated molecular dynamics
simulations and a novel atomic-scale metric, the flexibility volume (V_f), to
establish the interplay between GB character, helium segregation, and bubble
growth mechanisms in body-centered cubic iron. We demonstrate that V_f, which
incorporates both local atomic volume and vibrational properties, qualitatively
predicts deformation propensity. Our results reveal that the atomic-scale
segregation energy landscape dictates initial helium clustering and subsequent
bubble morphology, with low-energy channels in tilt {\Sigma}5 boundary
facilitating one-dimensional migration while isolated deep traps in twist
{\Sigma}13 boundary promote larger, rounder bubble morphology. Critically,
besides gradual bubble growth via trap mutation mechanism, we identify two
distinct stress-relief mechanisms: loop punching in anisotropic tilt {\Sigma}5
boundary and interfacial decohesion in twist {\Sigma}11 boundary, with the
dominant pathway determined by the interplay between bubble morphology and
local mechanical softness. This study establishes a fundamental connection
between GB crystallographic and energetical anisotropy and helium bubble
evolution, providing critical insights for designing radiation-tolerant
microstructures.

$\rm La_3Ni_2O_7$, a nickelate compound with a reported superconducting
transition temperature of $\rm 80~K$, has attracted significant attention in
recent years.Density-wave phenomena arising from strong electron correlations
are widely regarded as key to unraveling the superconductivity mechanism, but
the ordering and stability of these density waves remain a subject of
contention in existing theoretical studies. In this work, we employ the
variational Monte Carlo (VMC) method to thoroughly examine the nature of
density waves as functions of Coulomb repulsion and exchange interactions in
bilayer two-orbital model proposed for the high pressure phase of $\rm
La_3Ni_2O_7$. We analyse the spin and charge correlation functions in a wide
range of parameter space, and delineate a schematic phase diagram that
separates different density-wave ground states. Our results provide useful
insights into the understanding of electron correlations in $\rm La_3Ni_2O_7$,
and highlight the potential of VMC to elucidate its superconducting mechanism.

Seebeck coefficient, $S=L_{12}/(TL_{11})$, which is proportional to a ratio
of the thermoelectric conductivity $L_{12}$ to the electric conductivity
$L_{11}$ with $T$ being temperature is examined for two-dimensional Dirac
electrons in a three-quarter filled organic conductor,
$\alpha$-(BETS)$_2$I$_3$, [BETS = BEDT-TSeF =
bis(ethylenedithio)tetraselenafulvalene] at ambient pressure.Using a
tight-binding (TB) model obtained by first-principles relativistic
density-functi onal theory method [Eur. Phys. J. B 94, 17 (2021)], we calculate
$S$ in the presence of the impurity and electron--phonon (e--p) scatterings. It
is shown that $S_x &lt; 0$ and $S_y &gt;0$ at high temperatures, where $S_x$ ($S_y$)
denotes $S$ perpendicular (parallel) to the molecular stacking axis. There is a
sign change of $S_y$ with increasing $T$. It is found that, at low temperatures
the absolute value of $S$ is enhanced by the spin-orbit coupling. The Seebeck
coefficient is examined by dividing into components of the conduction and
valence bands to find that the electron and hole contributions compete each
other. Such $T$ dependence of $S$ is clarified using the spectral conductivity,
which determines $L_{12}$ and $L_{11}$.

### Thermodynamic Irreversibility in Underdamped Brownian Motion with Spatial Temperature Gradients

We analyze underdamped Brownian motion in non-isothermal media with
quadratic, linear, and piecewise-constant temperature profiles. Exact
identities for entropy production and entropy extraction are derived,
addressing whether a vanishing rate implies equilibrium. For a free particle
(no external forces or ratchets), the instantaneous entropy production and
extraction rates decay to zero at long times despite a spatial temperature
gradient. However, their time-integrated values remain finite, demonstrating
intrinsic irreversibility arising from kinetic-energy-mediated heat flow from
hot to cold regions. Hence, zero entropy-production rate does not certify
equilibrium in non-isothermal underdamped systems. Without loads/potentials,
most thermodynamic rates vanish asymptotically while irreversibility persists
via cumulative heat transfer.

### Model Order Reduction for Quantum Molecular Dynamics

Molecular dynamics simulations are indispensable for exploring the behavior
of atoms and molecules. Grounded in quantum mechanical principles, quantum
molecular dynamics provides high predictive power but its computational cost is
dominated by iterative high-fidelity electronic structure calculations. We
propose a novel model order reduction approach as an alternative to
high-fidelity electronic structure calculation. By learning a low-dimensional
representation of the electronic solution manifold within the Kohn-Sham density
functional theory framework, our model order reduction approach determines the
ground state electronic density by projecting the problem onto a
low-dimensional subspace, thereby avoiding the computationally expensive
iterative optimization of electronic wavefunctions in the full space. We
demonstrate the capability of our method on a water molecule, showing excellent
agreement with high-fidelity simulations for both molecular geometry and
dynamic properties, highlighting the generalizability through carefully
designed parametrization and systematic sampling.

Chirality in magnetic systems gives rise to a wide range of exotic phenomena,
yet its influence in $S=1$ chains remains largely unexplored. Here, we present
a comprehensive experimental study of a chiral antiferromagnetic (AFM) $S=1$
chain, [Ni(pym)(H$_{2}$O)$_{4}$]SO$_{4} \cdot$ H$_{2}$O (pym = pyrimidine),
where the Ni(II) octahedral orientation exhibits a four-fold chiral
periodicity. Muon spin rotation measurements indicate the onset of long-range
magnetic order below $T_{\rm N} = 1.82(2)\,\mathrm{K}$. Neutron diffraction
measurements reveal a chiral AFM order driven by a chiral modulation of the
easy-axis anisotropy direction, rather than the typical scenario of
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, geometrical frustration or higher-order
interactions. Inelastic neutron scattering (INS) measurements reveal dispersive
spin-wave excitations well described by linear spin-wave theory, with
Hamiltonian parameters $J_{0} = 6.81(1)\,\mathrm{K}$ (intrachain exchange),
$J'_{1\rm a} = -0.091(1)\,\mathrm{K}$ (interchain exchange), and $D =
-3.02(1)\,\mathrm{K}$ (easy-axis single-ion anisotropy). These parameters are
further validated by Monte Carlo simulations of the magnetisation.
Additionally, the INS data reveal multiple dispersionless bands, suggesting the
presence of further excitations beyond the scope of our linear spin-wave
theory.

Freestanding oxide membranes offer integration with advanced semiconductor
platforms, unlocking opportunities for flexible electronics, silicon-based
spintronics, neuromorphic computing, and high-performance energy technologies.
Scalable fabrication of such membranes is essential for bridging fundamental
discoveries in complex oxides with practical device deployment. However, the
lateral dimensions of crack- and wrinkle-free membranes remain limited to
millimeter scales, forming a critical bottleneck for large-area architectures.
Overcoming this challenge demands strategies that preserve crystalline quality
while suppressing defect transfer during release. Here, we demonstrate an
approach based on a water-soluble sacrificial layer of super-tetragonal
Sr4Al2O7, enabling the fabrication of ultrathin, crack-free, and wrinkle-free
free-standing oxide membranes spanning centimeter-scale areas. This method is
broadly applicable to a wide range of oxides and establishes a new pathway
toward large-scale silicon integration and flexible oxide technologies.
Nevertheless, dissolution of the sacrificial layer introduces oxygen vacancies
into the SrRuO3 membranes, with diffusion depths reaching six unit cells,
leading to anomalous "up-and-down" transport behavior. Although post-annealing
can eliminate these vacancies, the required temperatures are incompatible with
CMOS processes. Therefore, ultrathin freestanding membranes fabricated by
water-assisted lift-off still face critical challenges for integration into
miniaturized silicon-based oxide devices.

### An $ab\;initio$ answer to long-debated questions about superconducting Nb$_3$Sn

We present the first fully $ab\;initio$ microscopic description of cubic and
tetragonal Nb$_3$Sn. We compute the anharmonic free energy surface, phonon
spectra, and solve the full-bandwidth anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg equations
for the superconducting gap of the two phases. Our results show that anharmonic
effects are crucial to stabilize both the cubic and tetragonal structures,
yielding phonon spectra in excellent agreement with neutron scattering data. We
find that the martensitic transition is weakly first-order and that the
superconducting gap is strongly anisotropic yet fully-open, with contributions
from both longitudinal and transverse Nb $d$-orbitals, revealing an unexpected
three-dimensional pairing mechanism. We also find that the experimentally
observed reduction of the upper critical field $H_{c2}$ across the transition
is explained by a combination of overall weaker electron-phonon coupling and a
redistribution of Fermi velocities, which shifts parts of the Fermi surface to
longer coherence lengths and limits $H_{c2}$. Based on these insights, we
propose that Sn-site doping could enhance transverse-state coupling and gap
isotropy, potentially improving both $T_c$ and $H_{c2}$, while Nb-site doping
reinforce $H_{c2}$ at the cost of lowering $T_c$.

### Anisotropic resistivity of a $p$-wave magnet candidate CeNiAsO

Certain noncollinear antiferromagnets host momentum-dependent spin-splitting
bands with odd-parity $p$-wave symmetry, termed $p$-wave magnets. Metallic
$p$-wave magnets offer a unique platform for spintronic applications, yet
experimental realizations remain scarce. CeNiAsO, featuring a tetragonal
structure and developing a commensurate coplanar noncollinear antiferromagnetic
order at low temperatures, has been theoretically proposed as such a magnet.
Here, we show that its resistivity exhibits strong two-fold in-plane anisotropy
-- a key signature of its proposed $p$-wave magnetism. Reversible and
nonvolatile switching between high- and low-resistance states is achieved by
alternating the in-plane magnetic field direction, indicating potential for
field-controlled memory devices. Our results not only provide critical
experimental evidence for $p$-wave magnetism in CeNiAsO but also open new
avenues for high-performance antiferromagnetic spintronics based on resistivity
anisotropy.

### Bayesian Prior Construction for Uncertainty Quantification in First-Principles Statistical Mechanics

- **TL;DR**: 这篇论文提出了构建贝叶斯聚类扩展模型的实用策略，包括基准截断、超参数选择和基态复制方法，以减少代理模型带来的不确定性，并在Li-Mg和Li-Al合金系统上进行了验证。

First-principles statistical mechanics enables the prediction of
thermodynamic and kinetic properties of materials, but is computationally
expensive. Many approaches require surrogate models to calculate energies
within Monte Carlo or molecular dynamics simulations. Inexpensive surrogates
such as cluster expansions enable otherwise intractable calculations by
interpolating data from higher accuracy methods, such as Density Functional
Theory (DFT). Surrogate models introduce uncertainty into downstream
calculations, in addition to any uncertainty inherent to DFT calculations.
Bayesian frameworks address this by quantifying uncertainty and incorporating
expert knowledge through priors. However, constructing effective priors remains
challenging. This work introduces and describes practical strategies for
building Bayesian cluster expansions, focusing on basis truncation,
hyperparameter selection, and ground state replication. We analyze multiple
basis truncation schemes, compare cross-validation to the
evidence-approximation for hyperparameter optimization, and provide methods to
find and enforce ground-state-preserving models through priors. Additionally,
we compare the uncertainties between different approximations to DFT (LDA, PBE,
SCAN) against the uncertainty introduced with the use of cluster expansion
surrogate models. These approaches are demonstrated on the BCC Li$_x$Mg$_{1-x}$
and Li$_x$Al$_{1-x}$ alloys, which are both of interest for solid-state Li
batteries. Our results provide guidelines for constructing and utilizing
Bayesian cluster expansions, thereby improving the transparency of materials
modeling. The approaches and insights developed in this work can be transferred
to a wide range of cluster expansion surrogate models, including the atomic
cluster expansion and related machine-learned interatomic potential
architectures.

The experimental realization of strong light-matter coupling with molecules
initiated the rapidly evolving field of molecular polaritonics. Most studies
focus on how exciton polaritons, which combine electronic excitations with
confined light modes, alter photochemistry. In this paper, we investigate their
use in selectively exciting molecular vibrational states in the ground state.
Selectively exciting molecules to high vibrational states with infrared lasers
to catalyze ground-state chemical reactions is a challenging task. Here, we
propose a two-cavity mode setup in the electronic strong coupling regime
inspired by the process of Stimulated Raman Adiabatic Passage (STIRAP) to
selectively populate excited vibrational states. One cavity mode actively pumps
the molecular system, while the other provides a highly effective and tunable
decay channel via photon leakage. We demonstrate the ability to selectively
populate vibrational states for coherent and incoherent light sources using a
molecular model system. Our initial findings show high efficiency and suggest a
possible route to steering and controlling chemical reactions in the electronic
ground state based on electronic strong coupling.

Recent advances in quantum dot platforms have opened new pathways for
realizing Majorana zero modes (MZMs) and simulating topological quantum
computation. Here we propose an experimentally feasible setup for implementing
topological $\sqrt{X}$- and $X$-quantum gates in an interacting $Y$-shaped
quantum-dot array. The proposed novel architecture enables both braiding and
charge readout through simple fusion operations controlled by gate-tunable
potentials. Using many-body time-dependent simulations based on exact
diagonalization, we analyze the braiding and fusion dynamics of MZMs in the
presence of nearest-neighbor Coulomb interactions and pairing disorder. We
compute diabatic errors, braiding fidelity, and the time- and space-resolved
electron and hole components of the local density of states to monitor the
braiding process. Our results show that even weak interactions or pairing
disorder induce oscillations in the braiding fidelity, thereby setting an upper
bound on the braiding speed. Furthermore, we demonstrate that comparing fusion
outcomes before and after braiding provides a direct and experimentally
accessible signature of the non-Abelian nature of MZMs in quantum dot systems.

within density functional theory (DFT). Atoms are represented as probabilistic
mixtures of elements, enabling gradient-based optimizers to converge to a

combinatorial optimization methods. Applied to Co-Cr-Ni-V oxides for the
alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER), EAT leads to a final recommended
composition of Co0.19Cr0.06V0.31Ni0.44O.

The transition to an absorbing phase in a spatiotemporal system is a
well-investigated nonequilibrium dynamic transition. The absorbing phase
transitions fall into a few universality classes, defined by the critical
exponents observed at the critical point. We present a coupled map lattice
(CML) model with quenched disorder in the couplings. In this model, spatial
disorders are introduced in the form of asymmetric coupling with a larger
coupling ($p$) to a neighbor on the right and a smaller coupling ($1-p$) to the
neighbor on the left, for $0 \le p \le0.5$. For $p=0$, the system belongs to
the directed percolation universality class. For $p&gt;0$, we observe continuously
changing critical exponents at the critical point. The order parameter is the
fraction of turbulent sites $m(t)$. %sites that are not in the laminar region.
We observe a power-law decay, $m(t) \sim t^{-\delta}$, at the critical point
$\epsilon_c$, where $\epsilon$ is the diffusive coupling parameter. These
exponents change continuously and do not match any known universality class in
any limit. This could be related to changes in the eigenvalue spectrum of the
connectivity matrix as the disorder is introduced.

Lithium niobate-on-insulator (LNOI) is an emerging photonic platform with
high potential for scalable quantum information processing due to its strong
second-order nonlinearity. However, little progress has been made in developing
on-chip single-photon detectors on LNOI. Niobium titanium nitride (NbTiN)
superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) are a promising
candidate for this application. In this work, we use DC reactive magnetron
sputtering to grow high-quality NbTiN thin films using an ultra-high vacuum
deposition system with a base pressure lower than $2\times 10^{-10}$ mbar.
Enabled by the low concentration of background impurities in this system, we
investigate the impact of substrate temperature during NbTiN growth. We achieve
four nm thick superconducting films with a critical temperature ($T_{c}$) of
12.3 K grown at a substrate temperature of 825 K. We find that the NbTiN films
grow in the (111) orientation and evolve from a porous pillar structure when
grown at low temperatures to densely packed fibrous grains at higher
temperatures. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the increased substrate
temperature reduces the oxygen concentration in our films and improves the
overall stoichiometry. In addition, we integrate these films with the LNOI
platform and investigate the obtained interface quality. Lastly, we fabricate
SNSPDs from the NbTiN film on LNOI and characterize the detector performance.

Spin Hall magnetoresistance (SMR) is an intriguing spin-dependent transport
phenomenon in bilayers consisting of non-magnetic and magnetic layers. Here, we
report on the influence of longitudinal spin current absorption by the magnetic
layer on SMR in bilayers composed of Co$_{20}$Fe$_{60}$B$_{20}$ (CoFeB) and
epitaxial SrIrO$_{3}$, where SrIrO$_{3}$ is used as a highly-resistive spin
current source. We observed a clear SMR signal and an enhancement in the SMR
ratio with increasing CoFeB layer thickness, in qualitative agreement with an
SMR model that incorporates the spin current absorption. The effective spin
Hall angle is corrected from 0.07 to 0.12 with consideration of the spin
current absorption, corresponding to a relative correction of ~71%. Our
findings highlight the pronounced impact of the spin current absorption by the
magnetic layer on the SMR mechanism when employing highly-resistive
non-magnetic layer such as SrIrO$_{3}$, as well as other emerging quantum
materials.

The two-star random graph is the simplest exponential random graph model with
nontrivial interactions between the graph edges. We propose a set of auxiliary
variables that control the thermodynamic limit where the number of vertices N
tends to infinity. Such 'master variables' are usually highly desirable in
treatments of 'large N' statistical field theory problems. For the dense regime
when a finite fraction of all possible edges are filled, this construction
recovers the mean field solution of Park and Newman, but with an explicit
control over the 1/N corrections. We use this advantage to compute the first
subleading correction to the Park-Newman result, which encodes the finite,
nonextensive contribution to the free energy. For the sparse regime with a
finite mean degree, we obtain a very compact derivation of the
Annibale-Courtney solution, originally developed with the use of functional
integrals, which is comfortably bypassed in our treatment.

- **TL;DR**: 对多种通用原子间势能函数在沸石结构中的性能进行基准测试，发现机器学习势能函数（MLIPs）特别是eSEN-30M-OAM模型在所有测试结构中表现最一致

Interatomic potentials (IPs) with wide elemental coverage and high accuracy
are powerful tools for high-throughput materials discovery. While the past few
years witnessed the development of multiple new universal IPs that cover wide
ranges of the periodic table, their applicability to target chemical systems
should be carefully investigated. We benchmark several universal IPs using
equilibrium zeolite structures as testbeds. We select a diverse set of
universal IPs encompassing two major categories: (i) universal analytic IPs,
including GFN-FF, UFF, and Dreiding; (ii) pretrained universal machine learning
IPs (MLIPs), comprising CHGNet, ORB-v3, MatterSim, eSEN-30M-OAM, PFP-v7, and
EquiformerV2-lE4-lF100-S2EFS-OC22. We compare them with established tailor-made
IPs, SLC, ClayFF, and BSFF using experimental data and density functional
theory (DFT) calculations with dispersion correction as the reference. The
tested zeolite structures comprise pure silica frameworks and aluminosilicates
containing copper species, potassium, and organic cations. We found that GFN-FF
is the best among the tested universal analytic IPs, but it does not achieve
satisfactory accuracy for highly strained silica rings and aluminosilicate
systems. All MLIPs can well reproduce experimental or DFT-level geometries and
energetics. Among the universal MLIPs, the eSEN-30M-OAM model shows the most
consistent performance across all zeolite structures studied. These findings
show that the modern pretrained universal MLIPs are practical tools in zeolite
screening workflows involving various compositions.

Twisted homobilayer transition metal dichalcogenides - specifically twisted
bilayer MoTe$_2$ and twisted bilayer WSe$_2$ - have recently emerged as a
versatile platform for strongly correlated and topological phases of matter.
These two-dimensional systems host tunable flat Chern bands in which Coulomb
interactions can dominate over kinetic energy, giving rise to a variety of
interaction-driven phenomena. A series of groundbreaking experiments have
revealed a rich landscape of quantum phases, including integer and fractional
quantum anomalous Hall states, quantum spin Hall states, anomalous Hall metals,
zero-field composite Fermi liquids, and unconventional superconductors, along
with more conventional topologically trivial correlated states including
antiferromagnets. This review surveys recent experimental discoveries and
theoretical progress in understanding these phases, with a focus on the key
underlying mechanisms - band topology, electron interactions, symmetry
breaking, and charge fractionalization. We emphasize the unique physics of
twisted TMD homobilayers in comparison to other related systems, discuss open
questions, and outline promising directions for future research.

### Direct determination of antiferroelectric-to-ferroelectric phase transition pathways in PbZrO$_3$ with Operando Electron Microscopy

Under a sufficiently high applied electric field, a non-polar
antiferroelectric material, such as \ce{PbZrO3}, can undergo a rapid
transformation to a polar ferroelectric phase. While this behavior is promising
for energy storage and electromechanical applications, a complete understanding
of the atomic-scale mechanisms governing the phase transition remain elusive.
Here, we employ \textit{operando} scanning transmission electron microscopy
electric field biasing to directly resolve the
antiferroelectric-to-ferroelectric transition pathway in \ce{PbZrO3} thin films
under device-relevant conditions. Atomic-resolution imaging reveals a
multi-step transition that includes several metastable phases. Complementary
nano-beam electron diffraction and atomic scale analysis further show that this
pathway and its end states can be modulated, leading to the formation of a
\quotes{dead layer} near the substrate with suppressed switching behavior.
Taking advantage of this depth-dependent heterogeneity, dynamic phase
transformations are observed between coexisting antiferroelectric and
metastable ferroelectric phases. At this dynamic transition front, repeated
phase interconversion is shown to be driven by competing internal (due to
substrate clamping and extended defects) and external fields, allowing the
relative energies of intermediate phases to be compared as a function of
electric field. This work highlights the critical role of local energetics in
phase stability and provides key experimental insights into field-induced phase
transitions, guiding the design of antiferroelectric-based devices.

- **TL;DR**: 提出结合算法微分(AD)和密度函数异动理论(DFPT)的平面波密度函数理论微分框架(AD-DFPT)，能够计算任何DFT输出量对任何输入参数的导数而无需手动求导。

We present a differentiation framework for plane-wave density-functional
theory (DFT) that combines the strengths of algorithmic differentiation (AD)
and density-functional perturbation theory (DFPT). In the resulting AD-DFPT
framework derivatives of any DFT output quantity with respect to any input
parameter (e.g. geometry, density functional or pseudopotential) can be
computed accurately without deriving gradient expressions by hand. We implement
AD-DFPT into the Density-Functional ToolKit (DFTK) and show its broad
applicability. Amongst others we consider the inverse design of a semiconductor
band gap, the learning of exchange-correlation functional parameters, or the
propagation of DFT parameter uncertainties to relaxed structures. These
examples demonstrate a number of promising research avenues opened by
gradient-driven workflows in first-principles materials modeling.

### Electronic modes induced by spin and charge perturbations in Mott and Kondo insulators

- **TL;DR**: 强关联绝缘体在自旋和电荷扰动下会出现能带结构变化，产生新的电子模式，这与传统能带绝缘体不同。

Electronic band structures usually remain unaffected by doping via a
chemical-potential shift or by increasing the temperature in conventional band
insulators. In contrast, it has been shown that those of Mott and Kondo
insulators can change by doping or by increasing the temperature: electronic
modes are induced within the band gap, exhibiting momentum-shifted magnetic
dispersion relations from the band edges. Here, by generalizing the underlying
mechanism of the remarkable strong-correlation effects, this study shows that
various spin and charge perturbations, including magnetization of spin-gapped
Mott and Kondo insulators, can induce electronic modes. The emergent modes can
change the band structure, provided that a macroscopic number of spins or
charges are excited by the perturbations at a moment. The origins and
dispersion relations of the emergent modes are elucidated by investigating the
selection rules and using the Bethe ansatz and effective theory for weak
inter-unit-cell hopping. The theoretical results are validated by numerical
calculations for the one- and two-dimensional Hubbard models, periodic Anderson
models, Kondo lattice models, and ladder and bilayer Hubbard models. This study
significantly advances the fundamental understanding of the changes in the band
structure driven by spin and charge perturbations and paves the way for
band-structure engineering in strong-correlation electronics, utilizing the
unconventional characteristics of strongly correlated insulators.

### Janus Skyrmion: Interfacial Quasiparticle with Two-Faced Helicity

Janus particles are functional particles with at least two surfaces showing
asymmetric properties. We show at the interface between two magnetic regions
with different antisymmetric exchange interactions, a new species of
topological quasiparticles can emerge, in which different helicity structures
can coexist. We name such an interfacial quasiparticle a "Janus skyrmion", in
analogy to the Janus particle. As the Janus skyrmion shows helicity asymmetry,
its size could vary with both the in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic fields. A
vertical spin current could drive the Janus skyrmion into one-dimensional
motion along the interface without showing the skyrmion Hall effect, at a speed
which depends on both the spin polarization angle and current density. Thermal
fluctuations could also lead to one-dimensional random walk of a Brownian Janus
skyrmion. This work uncovers unique dynamics of interfacial quasiparticles with
exotic helicity structures, which may be realized in interface-engineered
magnetic layers.

### Quantum Fisher Information as a Measure of Symmetry Breaking in Quantum Many-Body Systems

- **TL;DR**: 量子Fisher信息(QFI)作为对称性破缺的通用度量，在量子资源理论框架下被提出，能够有效量化凝聚态系统中的对称性破缺现象。

Symmetry breaking underlies diverse phenomena from phase transitions in
condensed matter to fundamental interactions in gauge theories. Despite many
proposed indicators, a general quantification of symmetry breaking that is
faithful, computable, and valid in the thermodynamic limit has remained
elusive. Here, within quantum resource theory, we propose the quantum Fisher
information (QFI) as such a measure. We demonstrate its utility by computing
QFI for paradigmatic models: in the BCS superconductor, the QFI counts the
number of Cooper pairs; in the transverse-field XY spin chains, it captures
topological phase transition that has no local order parameter; and in quantum
quench dynamics, it allows us to exactly derive the microscopic origin and
conditions of the quantum Mpemba effect in terms of excitation propagation,
including in the thermodynamic limit--beyond the reach of previous analyses.
Our results show that the QFI, which is a complete resource monotone in the
resource theory of asymmetry that plays the role of entanglement entropy in
entanglement theory, faithfully captures symmetry breaking in condensed-matter
systems. These results highlight the QFI as a universal and physically
meaningful diagnostic of symmetry breaking in both equilibrium and
non-equilibrium quantum many-body systems.

### Chirality-Induced Orbital Selectivity through Linear-Orbital Coupling

This work investigates electron transport through chiral electrostatic
potentials by modeling the system in three spatial dimensions and demonstrates
that chirality-induced orbital selectivity (CIOS) produces pronounced
enantiospecific transmission, dependent on the electron's initial orbital
angular momentum (OAM) state. The results show that transverse electron motion
in a chiral environment, captured by OAM dynamics, gives rise to strong orbital
selectivity that reverses upon inversion of the handedness of the chiral
potential. This behavior originates from a coupling between the electron's
linear and orbital angular momenta, leading to effects that are significantly
stronger than those arising from spin-phonon and bare spin-orbit interactions
under realistic physical conditions. Moreover, the CIOS effect is shown to
increase with the length of the chiral region and remains robust against static
disorder. The orbital selectivity can give rise to spin selectivity when
initial correlations exist between spin and OAM states. These findings
underscore the importance of orbital contributions to enantiospecific electron
transport in chiral systems and suggest that CIOS plays a critical role
alongside existing spin-based mechanisms.

Magnetic field is one of the most fundamental control parameters in materials
science. Pulsed magnetic-field apparatus can generate high magnetic fields that
are inaccessible by conventional DC-field magnets. One important issue is that
measurement techniques compatible with pulsed fields are rather limited due to
short pulse duration and large electromagnetic or mechanical noises originating
from field pulses. Magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE), change in states of
light polarization upon reflection from magnetic materials, has potential to
become a powerful tool for investigation of magnetic properties of a wide range
of materials including non-transparent materials or thin films in pulsed
fields. Nevertheless, since MOKE response is typically very small, MOKE
measurements under pulsed fields are quite challenging. Here, we present a new
method to measure polar MOKE under high pulsed magnetic fields of 2-ms pulse
width. The keys of this new technique are a ferrule-based compact sample-fiber
fixture and a phase-resolved numerical lock-in analysis, combined with the
high-resolution optical apparatus based on an all-fiber loop-less Sagnac
interferometer. We succeeded in measuring MOKE of various ferromagnetic or
ferrimagnetic samples above 40 T and down to 77 K, largely extending limits of
previously reported pulse-field MOKE measurements. Our apparatus is simple
enough to be compatible with larger-scale experiments in pulse-field
facilities, thus becoming a new promising tool to optically investigate
materials properties in pulsed fields.

### Cavity-induced Eliashberg effect: superconductivity vs charge density wave

- **TL;DR**: 将Eliashberg效应理论从超导相扩展到电荷密度波相，研究腔光子耦合对非平衡态下量子材料相变的控制作用

Recent experiments have shown that non-equilibrium effects can play a key
role in cavity-based control of material phases, notably in systems with
charge-density-wave order. Motivated by this, we extend the theory of the
Eliashberg effect, originally developed for superconducting phases, to
charge-density-wave phases. Starting from a minimal electronic model where
superconductivity and charge-density-wave order are equivalent at equilibrium,
we introduce coupling to cavity photons, which are in turn coupled to an
environment at a temperature different from the one of the electronic
environment. This drives the system into a non-thermal steady state, which
breaks the equivalence between superconductivity and charge-density-wave order.
In the superconducting case, we recover the known behavior: a shift from
continuous to discontinuous phase transitions with bistability. In contrast,
the charge-density-wave case displays richer behavior: tuning the cavity
frequency induces both continuous and discontinuous transitions, two distinct
ordered phases, and a bistable regime ending at a critical point. These
findings demonstrate that the scope of cavity-based non-thermal control of
quantum materials is broader than at thermal equilibrium, and strongly depends
on the targeted phases.

Periodic driving of quantum dots is analyzed as a basis for developing
dynamic switching devices. We study transport through periodically modulated
energy levels which are coupled to leads via tunneling coefficients. Utilizing
Floquet theory a full analytic solution is found in terms of continued
fractions, enabling us to efficiently calculate and analyze the transmission
through the quantum dot in relevant parameter regimes. By considering levels at
higher energy outside the spectrum of the transmitted particles a resonant
switching effects is identified, where a very small oscillating control signal
on a weakly connected quantum dot can induce perfect transmission. We also find
closed form expressions using Bessel functions in the limit of small tunnel
couplings. The results predict and explain resonant tunneling in
nano-electronic devices as well as in corresponding setups using magnonic
systems, photonic waveguides, or ultra-cold gases in optical lattices.

Warm dense matter is a highly energetic phase characterized by strong
correlations, thermal effects, and quantum effects of electrons. Thermal
density functional theory is commonly used in simulations of this challenging
phase, driving the development of temperature-dependent approximations to the
exchange-correlation free energy. In this work, a finite-temperature extension
of the two-legged adiabatic connection construction is demonstrated for the
uniform electron gas and asymmetric Hubbard dimer at warm dense matter
conditions. This provides the structure of a temperature- and density-dependent
weighting scheme for a hybrid exchange-correlation approximation. The
construction also provides evidence that nonlinear thermal effects on the
balance between exchange and correlation, as well as that between kinetic,
entropic, and potential components of the correlation, persist and can even be
emphasized by strong electron-electron interaction. These findings point
additionally to a complicated interplay between temperature, density, and
interaction strength in the strong correlation character of these model
systems.

Powder X-ray diffraction experiments under pressure up to $\sim$10 GPa were
performed on tetragonal CeFeSi-type $R$MnSi ($R$ = La, Ce, Pr, Nd). A
structural phase transition was observed in CeMnSi at a critical pressure of
$P_{\rm s}$ $\sim$ 5.7 GPa. In contrast, LaMnSi, PrMnSi, and NdMnSi do not
exhibit any structural transitions within the same pressure range. The lattice
parameter ratio $c/a$ of CeMnSi decreases rapidly as pressure approaches
$P_{\rm s}$, whereas the $c/a$ ratios of the other $R$MnSi increase
monotonically with pressure. CeMnSi also shows a relatively small bulk modulus:
$B_0$ $\sim$ 41.4(4) GPa in the 0--2 GPa range and $B_0$ $\sim$ 32.8(2) GPa in
the 4--5 GPa range, suggesting valence instability under pressure. The
structural transition in CeMnSi is attributed to the pressure-induced decrease
in $c/a$ and its low bulk modulus. Above $P_{\rm s}$, the X-ray diffraction
pattern indicates a transition to a monoclinic structure with space group No.
11, $P2_1/m$. These findings highlight the unique pressure response of CeMnSi
and provide insight into the coupling between lattice and electronic degrees of
freedom in Ce-based intermetallic systems.

We investigate the nature of the 5$f$ electrons in the unconventional
odd-parity superconductor UTe$_2$, focusing on the degree of covalency,
localization versus itinerancy, and dominant electronic configuration. This is
achieved using density functional theory (DFT) in combination with dynamical
mean-field theory (DMFT) calculations. A key aspect of our approach is the
material-specific tuning of the double-counting correction parameter, $\mu_{\rm
dc}$, within the DFT+DMFT part. This tuning is guided by the energy dependence
of photo-ionization cross-sections in valence band photoelectron spectroscopy.
The reliability of the parameters is confirmed by the accurate reproduction of
the angle-resolved valence-band photoemission spectra and the U 4$f$ core-level
data. The DFT+DMFT model reveals that in UTe$_2$ U 5$f^n$ configurations with
n=1 to 4 contribute to the ground state, with the 5$f^2$ configuration being
most prevalent and an average 5$f$ shell fillings close to 2.5. The model
further suggests that the 5$f$ electrons form narrow bands and that charge
fluctuations due to degeneracy play a role in addition to coherent valence
dynamics arising from hybridization with the conduction bath. Additionally, the
significance of the U 6$d$ states in UTe$_2$ is discussed.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文分析了多终端多通道导体在任意时变驱动和静态电势/温度偏压下的噪声特性，提出了涨落耗散约束和基于电子分布形状的第二个更紧约束。

We analyze the noise in a multi-terminal multi-channel conductor under
arbitrary time-dependent driving and subject to -- possibly large -- static
potential and temperature biases. We show that the full out-of-equilibrium
zero-frequency noise is constrained by a fluctuation-dissipation bound. It
consists of an upper bound expressed in terms of weighted current components of
the separate Floquet bands arising from the time-dependent driving. In the
limit of large static temperature bias, it has an intuitive interpretation in
terms of the dissipated powers due to the static potential bias and due to the
time-dependent driving. Furthermore, we show the existence of a second bound
that relies on the specific shape of the electron distribution resulting from
the driving, which is often even tighter than the fluctuation-dissipation
bound. We show the implications of our bounds at the simple, but experimentally
relevant example of a two-terminal conductor in the presence of an ac bias.

Fluctuating pairwise interactions are understood to drive fluid-like states
in dense biological systems. These states find a broad range of
functionalities, such as directing growth during morphogenesis and forming
aggregates with heightened mechanical response. However, a tractable model
capturing the role of microscopic fluctuating interactions in these structural
transitions is crucially lacking. Here, we study a $p$-spin model with
fluctuating pairwise couplings (of strength $D_a$ and persistence time $t_a$)
as a schematic model for interaction-mediated fluidization. We find that while
stronger fluctuations suppress the glass transition, more persistent
fluctuations have the opposite effect. We identify the presence of an emergent
fluctuation-dissipation relation at long times. We numerically extract the
critical temperature $T_c(D_a, t_a)$ from a scaling relation near the
transition, illustrating how microscopic fluctuations control the glass
transition.

We present a calculation of the imaginary part of the polarizability of a
Wigner crystal using the Fluctuation-Dissipation theorem. The oscillations of
the localized electrons about their equilibrium positions are treated in the
harmonic approximation and the electric dipole-moment -- dipole-moment
correlator is computed by a normal mode expansion. The amplitudes and phases of
the different normal modes are assumed to be statistically independent. In the
first case, polarizability is computed in the high temperature limit, $k_B
T&gt;&gt;\hbar \Omega_W$ (here, $\Omega_W$ is the Wigner frequency, analogous to the
Debye frequency of the phonon case). In the second case, a general expression
(valid both at high and low temperature limits) is obtained using a
phenomenological damping model. The connection between our general expression
and that of the Lorentz oscillator model is discussed. It turns out that the
Wigner crystal would be transparent for applied frequencies greater than the
Wigner frequency. A standard ellipsometry set-up can test the predictions of
the theory.

Calcium fluoride (fluorspar, CaF2 ) is of consummate importance for the
manufacturing of optical components. In many cases, its wide transmission band
eliminates the need for antireflective coatings. It is thus of interest to
study its optical properties as a function of temperature. The optical
properties are mainly determined by a strongly temperature-dependent infrared
(IR) peak, and a series of nearly temperature-independent ultraviolet (UV)
peaks. We find that the temperature dependence of the IR peak can be modeled,
to good accuracy, by a radiation-reaction improved coupled-oscillator model,
with temperature-dependent parameters. For the UV peaks, we find a convenient
functional form which covers both the real as well as the imaginary parts of
the dielectric function and provide a comparison to first-principles
calculations. The result is a compact functional form for the dielectric
function of undoped CaF2 in the frequency range 0 &lt; omega &lt; 1.8 a.u., and in
the temperature range 22Celsius &lt; T &lt; 500Celsius. With the help of the
temperature-dependent dielectric function, we obtain temperature-dependent
values of the short-range and long-range asymptotics of atom-surface
interactions with CaF2, for hydrogen, as well as ground-state and metastable
helium.

Twisted graphene multilayers exhibit strong electronic correlations, which
manifest in a range of experimental signatures. Yet how these signatures relate
to each other and the microscopic ground states-and how twist angle and band
structure reshape them-remains poorly understood. Here we study this interplay
by correlating local thermodynamic and transport measurements in a twisted
trilayer graphene (TTG) sample with unequal angles and flat electronic bands.
We use a scanning single-electron transistor to map the impact of
electron-electron interactions in a region of the sample where the local twist
angle evolves smoothly. We observe gapped correlated insulators and a sawtooth
in electronic compressibility, both exhibiting pronounced electron-hole (e-h)
asymmetry with distinct magic angles for conduction and valence bands.
Subsequent transport measurements in the same region reveal robust
superconductivity with a similar e-h asymmetry. Our measurements indicate that
superconductivity is not directly tied to the correlated insulators. Instead,
its critical temperature correlates closely with the strength of the sawtooth
in compressibility, suggesting a common origin or link between the two. By
combining a local probe with transport measurements, we uncover connections
between superconductivity and thermodynamic correlation signatures that are not
apparent from either technique in isolation, highlighting the power of our dual
approach and establishing their dependence on interlayer twist angles in TTG.

We present a minimal model for mixtures of chiral active particles,
formulated solely in terms of the number densities of the species.
Nonreciprocity and chirality enter the chemical potential at vanishing order in
spatial gradients, taking the form of local and non-local contributions.
Chirality manifests as the curl of the nonreciprocal current, while the latter
is simultaneously strongly modified by former. Their interplay generates
distinctive dynamical states, including phase separation with edge currents and
a spatiotemporally disordered phase with both chiral and nonreciprocal
signatures.

### Spin susceptibility in a pseudogap state with fluctuating spiral magnetic order

We compute the electron spin susceptibility in the pseudogap regime of the
two-dimensional Hubbard model in the framework of a SU(2) gauge theory of
fluctuating magnetic order. The electrons are fractionalized in fermionic
chargons with a pseudospin degree of freedom and bosonic spinons. The chargons
are treated in a renormalized mean-field theory and order in a N\'eel or spiral
magnetic state in a broad range around half-filling below a transition
temperature $T^*$. Fluctuations of the spin orientation are captured by the
spinons. Their dynamics is governed by a non-linear sigma model, with spin
stiffnesses computed microscopically from the pseudospin susceptibility of the
chargons. The SU(2) gauge group is higgsed in the chargon sector, and the
spinon fluctuations prevent breaking of the physical spin symmetry at any
finite temperature. The electron spin susceptibility obtained from the gauge
theory shares many features with experimental observations in the pseudogap
regime of cuprate superconductors: the dynamical spin susceptibility
$S(\mathbf{q},\omega)$ has a spin gap, the static uniform spin susceptibility
$\kappa_s$ decreases strongly with temperature below $T^*$, and the NMR
relaxation rate $T_1^{-1}$ vanishes exponentially in the low temperature limit
if the ground state is quantum disordered. At low hole doping,
$S(\mathbf{q},\omega)$ exhibits nematicity below a transition temperature
$T_{\rm nem} &lt; T^*$, and at larger hole doping in the entire pseudogap regime
below $T^*$.

Monolayer tungsten diselenide (WSe$_2$) is a leading candidate for nanoscale
complementary logic. However, high defect densities introduced during thin-film
growth and device fabrication have limited p-type transistor performance. Here,
we report a combined strategy of precursor-engineered chemical vapor deposition
and damage-minimizing fabrication to overcome this limitation. By converting
tungsten trioxide and residual oxyselenides into reactive suboxides before
growth, and precisely regulating selenium delivery during deposition, we
synthesize uniform, centimeter-scale monolayer WSe$_2$ films with charged
defect densities as low as $5 \times 10^{9}$ cm$^{-2}$. Transistors fabricated
from these films achieve record p-type on-state current up to $888
\mu$A$\cdot\mu$m$^{-1}$ at $V_{\mathrm{DS}}=-1$ V, matching leading n-type
devices. This leap in material quality closes the p-type performance gap
without exotic doping or contact materials, marking a critical step towards
complementary two-dimensional semiconductor circuits.

Spin waves are attractive information carriers owing to their
gigahertz-to-terahertz frequencies, nanometric wavelengths, and negligible
Joule heating. Yet the efficient excitation of short-wavelength, high-frequency
spin waves and the exploitation of nonlinear effects remain challenging. We
propose a hybrid ferromagnetic nanostructure composed of a small,
in-plane-magnetized rim (a magnonic nanocavity) exchange-coupled to an
out-of-plane-magnetized region. Micromagnetic simulations show that a spatially
uniform out-of-plane microwave field excites the rim's fundamental mode; its
second harmonic is then coherently and efficiently launched into the second
region of the structure, yielding propagating spin waves. The process can be
realized in strip or disk geometries, providing excitation of plane-wave or
radial spin waves, respectively. The conversion efficiency grows nonlinearly
with the pump amplitude and can be further improved when the frequency of a
higher-order standing wave in the nanocavity matches the second-harmonic
frequency. The emission frequency is tunable via the bias magnetic field or the
width of the nanocavity, suggesting a compact route toward on-chip,
short-wavelength, high-frequency spin-wave sources for artificial neural
networks.

Causal relationships play a fundamental role in understanding the world
around us. The ability to identify and understand cause-effect relationships is
critical to making informed decisions, predicting outcomes, and developing
effective strategies. However, deciphering causal relationships from
observational data is a difficult task, as correlations alone may not provide
definitive evidence of causality. In recent years, the field of machine
learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool, offering new opportunities for
uncovering hidden causal mechanisms and better understanding complex systems.
In this work, we address the issue of detecting the intrinsic causal links of a
large class of complex systems in the framework of the response theory in
physics. We develop some theoretical ideas put forward by [1], and technically
we use state-of-the-art ML techniques to build up models from data. We consider
both linear stochastic and non-linear systems. Finally, we compute the
asymptotic efficiency of the linear response based causal predictor in a case
of large scale Markov process network of linear interactions.

### Alter-magnetic properties in the perovskite compounds

- **TL;DR**: 通过高速计算筛选找到140种Pnma空间群反铁磁材料，其91种具有交替磁性，以NaCoF3为例发现G-AFM为基态，具有各向异性光导和异常运输效应。

Our high-throughput computational screening of the Materials Project database
has identified 140 candidate materials exhibiting antiferromagnetic behavior in
the $Pnma$ space group. Through systematic density functional theory
calculations comparing various magnetic configurations, we demonstrate that 91
of these compounds preferentially stabilize in altermagnetic ground states,
with 20 adopting the perovskite structure. Using NaCoF$_3$ as a prototypical
example, we perform a comprehensive investigation of its electronic structure,
magnetic ordering, and orbital configurations. Our analysis reveals that the
magnetic Co$^{2+}$ ions occupy the 4c Wyckoff position and support three
distinct antiferromagnetic (AFM) phases, among which the $G$-AFM configuration
emerges as the ground state. Detailed symmetry analysis uncovers that the
inter-sublattice coupling in the $G$-AFM phase is mediated by the combined
time-reversal and rotation operation
$\hat{T}\{R_{2x}|\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}0\}$. This unique symmetry protection
gives rise to several remarkable physical phenomena: (i) anisotropic optical
conductivity, (ii) prominent anomalous transport effects including the
anomalous Hall effect (AHE), Nernst effect (ANE), and thermal Hall effect
(ATHE), and (iii) strong magneto-optical responses manifested through both Kerr
and Faraday effects.

Electron mobility due to electron-phonon interaction is investigated for
fully fluorinated/hydrogenated zig-zag carbon nanotubes containing
one-dimensional alternating chains of carbon atoms with $\pi$-bonds. The
behavior of mobility associated with changes in the tube diameter, coating type
(F/H) and temperature is revealed. In particular, it is shown that the
dependence of mobility on the diameter in such tubes is periodic with the
chirality index, which is associated with the absence of scattering on TA
phonons in the tubes with an even number of conducting chains due to mirror
symmetry. The obtained small values of phonon-limited mobility indicate that
tubes with one-dimensional conducting chains are more promising for use as gas
sensors than as elements of electronic devices. Calculations are performed
within the self-energy relaxation time approximation (SERTA) using the
non-orthogonal tight-binding approach.

Power and efficiency are fundamental criteria for evaluating the performance
of thermodynamic cycles. However, it is generally impossible to maximize both
simultaneously. In particular, achieving maximum efficiency inevitably leads to
vanishing power as the cycle duration approaches infinity. A quantitative
characterization of this trade-off yields significant theoretical and practical
implications. In this letter, we analytically derive an exact bound
constraining power and efficiency in low-dissipation finite-time heat engines.
This bound specifies the maximum power attainable at any prescribed efficiency,
thereby providing a benchmarking for evaluating the performance of heat
engines.

Reservoir computing (RC), a neural network designed for temporal data,
enables efficient computation with low-cost training and direct physical
implementation. Recently, quantum RC has opened new possibilities for
conventional RC and introduced novel ideas to tackle open problems in quantum
physics and advance quantum technologies. Despite its promise, it faces
challenges, including physical realization, output readout, and
measurement-induced back-action. Here, we propose to implement quantum RC
through quantum transport in mesoscopic electronic systems. Our approach
possesses several advantages: compatibility with existing device fabrication
techniques, ease of output measurement, and robustness against measurement
back-action. Leveraging universal conductance fluctuations, we numerically
demonstrate two benchmark tasks, spoken-digit recognition and time-series
forecasting, to validate our proposal. This work establishes a novel pathway
for implementing on-chip quantum RC via quantum transport and expands the
mesoscopic physics applications.

Cluster Dynamical Mean Field Theory (CDMFT) with an exact diagonalization
(ED) impurity solver faces exponential scaling limitations from the Hilbert
space dimension. We introduce subbath CDMFT (SB-CDMFT), an alternative to the
conventional CDMFT-ED method in which the discrete bath is subdivided into
separate subbaths, each coupled to the cluster with distinct hybridization
functions. In this approach, only one subbath at a time is actively involved in
ED, dramatically reducing the computational cost by replacing a single large
impurity problem with multiple smaller separate ones. Our method successfully
reproduces key physical properties including particle-hole symmetry and Mott
physics, while allowing for an extended bath representation at a fraction of
the typical computational cost.

Hafnium dioxide, also known as hafnia, is an extremely sought-after material
in opto- and nanoelectronics for creating optical coatings and various
functional media to have stable performance characteristics under varying
thermal operating conditions. In this paper, we have investigated the behavior
of the optical properties of hafnia thin films exhibiting an amorphous
structure in a wide temperature range of 7-296 K. For the first time we have
examined the temperature effects in the energy gap of HfO2 films and estimated
the effective phonon energy of 30 meV responsible for observed thermally
assisted shift of electronic levels. It has been shown that the electron-phonon
interaction in the oxygen subsystem predominantly causes the observed changes.
The obtained refractive index values for the tested films are established to be
compatible with independent predicted data and to decrease as the temperature
drops. The energy structure and electron-phonon interaction features that have
been found are critical for forecasting how hafnia-thin-film-based
optoelectronic devices will behave across a wide temperature range.

Moir\'e materials with opposite non-zero miniband Chern numbers in
time-reversal-partner valleys are two-dimensional topological insulators at
band filling $\nu=2$. We explore the possibility that in this class of moir'e
materials intervalley coherence can sometimes be present in interaction induced
insulators at band filling $\nu=1$ , using Landau levels with opposite signs of
the magnetic field as a convenient generic model. In the absence of intravalley
interactions the mean-field ground state at filling factor $\nu=1$ is a gapless
intervalley coherent state that maps under a particle-hole transformation of
one valley to a strong-field superconducting vortex-lattice state that has been
studied previously. When the ratio $\lambda$ of intravalley to intervalley
interactions is increased, gapped states appear, one with broken time-reversal
symmetry and a quantized Hall effect but no valley polarization and one with
broken parity symmetry and zero Hall conductivity. We discuss the possibility
that the latter state could be related to the fractional quantum spin Hall
effect recently observed at an odd filling factor in a moir'e topological
insulator and comment on related systems in which correlations between
electrons in bands with opposite Chern numbers might play a key role.

The paths of swift heavy ions are typically traceable in solids, because of
confined electronic interactions along the paths, inducing what is known in
literature as 'ion tracks', i.e. nano-sized in cross-section cylindrical zones
of modified material extending for microns in length. Such tracks readily form
in materials exhibiting low thermal conductivities, in particular insulators or
semiconductors, altering the homogeneity of materials. In this work, using
recently discovered gamma/beta-Ga2O3 polymorph heterostructures we show that,
in contrast to the trends in many other materials, including that in
beta-Ga2O3, swift heavy ions leave no tracks in gamma-Ga2O3. We explained this
trend in terms of amazingly fast disorder recovery, occurring because of
multiple configurations in the gamma-Ga2O3 lattice itself, so that the disorder
formed by ion impacts gets rapidly erased, giving a perception of ions leaving
no tracks. As such, gamma-Ga2O3, readily integrated with beta-Ga2O3 in
polymorph heterostructures, may become a promising semiconductor platform for
devices capable to operate in extremely harsh radiation environments.

Accurate quantification of the spin-orbit torques (SOTs) is critical for the
identification and applications of new spin-orbitronic effects. One of the most
popular techniques to qualify the SOTs is the switching angle shift, where the
applied direct current was assumed to shift, via domain wall depinning during
the anti-domain expansion, the switching angle of a perpendicular magnetization
in a linear proportion manner under a large rotating magnetic field. Here, we
report that, for the most commonly employed perpendicular magnetization
heterostructures in spintronics (e.g., those based on FeCoB, Co, and Co/Ni
multilayers), the switching angle shift considerably misestimates the SOT
within the domain wall depinning analysis of the slope of the linear-in-current
scaling and may also have a non-zero residual value at zero direct current. Our
experiments and simulations unveil that the switching angle shift is most
likely dominated by the chiral asymmetric nucleation rather than the expansion
of the anti-domains. The in-plane field from external magnet and
current-induced SOTs lower the perpendicular nucleation field and thus the
required switching angle, ultimately leading to underestimation of the SOTs by
the domain wall depinning analysis. These results have advanced the
understanding of magnetization switching of spintronic devices.

Formic acid is a promising liquid hydrogen carrier, but its catalytic
decomposition requires both high activity and selectivity toward
dehydrogenation. Here, we investigated the catalytic activity and selectivity
of formic acid decomposition on single Pt atoms supported on pristine and
heteroatom-doped graphene using first-principles calculations based on the
density functional theory. Reaction energy profiles reveal that single Pt atoms
on P- and O-doped graphene show catalytic activity comparable to Pt(111), while
all systems maintain strong dehydrogenation selectivity. These findings
highlight doped graphene as a promising support for reducing precious metal
usage in dehydrogenation catalysts.

Extending Hong--Ou--Mandel (HOM) interferometry to the fractional quantum
Hall effect (FQHE) promises direct access to anyonic statistics, yet remains
challenging: on-demand anyon injection is hindered by integer-charged minimal
excitations, and recent HOM experiments in the FQHE lack a fully consistent
theoretical framework. Here we provide a general theory of time-resolved HOM
interferometry in quantum Hall systems. Combining the nonequilibrium bosonized
edge theory (NEBET) with the unifying non-equilibrium perturbative theory
(UNEPT), we derive exact and perturbative relations obeyed by the relevant
cross-correlations of chiral currents valid for spatially extended tunneling
operators and generic quadratic edge dynamics. Then, within the
Tomonaga--Luttinger liquid (TLL) framework, we analyze the width of the HOM dip
for injected pulses carrying integer and fractional charges. We show that it is
governed by the width of the pulses and, for the fractional charge, by a
non-trivial power-law behavior of the scaling dimension. Our results establish
a robust theoretical foundation for interpreting recent experiments on anyonic
statistics and electronic interferometry in the quantum Hall regime.

Using first-principles density functional theory calculations in combination
with the climbing-image nudged elastic band method, we investigated the
adsorption, desorption, and diffusion of atomic chlorine and molecular chlorine
on the Al terminated 0001 surface of aluminum nitride. Our results reveal that
both atomic Cl and Cl2 exhibit a chemisorption character with high binding
energies. Calculations revealed that the splitting pathway of Cl2 on the Al
terminated AlN 0001 surface is a barrierless and exothermic process. These
findings provide new microscopic-scale insights into halogen-insulator surface
interactions and opportunities for new strategies in optimizing AlN atomic
layer etching process in semiconductor fabrication.

In this work, we develop methods for increasing the dispersion degree of
agglomerated multiwalled carbon nanotubes with subsequent introduction of them
into polyvinyl butyral to create transparent conductive films. The influence of
proton and a-proton solvents in combination with potassium triiodide (KI3) as a
redox component for oxidation of the multiwalled carbon nanotubes surface,
which reduces agglomeration due to electrostatic repulsion, is investigated. It
is demonstrated that a-proton solvent cyclohexanone ensures a smaller size of
the agglomerates (30-300 nm, with a maximum of ~145 nm) compared to proton
solvent propyl alcohol (100-3000 nm, with a maximum of ~920 nm). The reduced
aggregation is associated with the formation of oxygen-containing functional
groups (C=O, C-O, C-O-C, and COO), which increase electrostatic stabilization.
The impedance analysis showed that the constant component of the conductivity
in the samples with multiwalled carbon nanotubes and a-proton solvent shifts to
frequencies of ~104 rad/s after the addition of the redox component, which
indicates the formation of ion-conducting channels and stabilization of the
jump charge transfer.

- **TL;DR**: Eu10Hg55是一种非中心对称的金属间化合物，具有混合价态铕和脆弱的磁性基态，在低温下表现出复杂的磁有序行为。

In solid-state compounds, the valence of europium can sometimes be mixed --
which is especially favored in structures with several positions for the
europium atoms. In this work, we study the Eu-based intermetallic
noncentrosymmetric system Eu$_{10}$Hg$_{55}$ which has 65 atoms per unit cell
and 4 distinct crystallographic positions for europium and 17 positions for
mercury. Our detailed analysis of magnetism of large single crystals suggests
that europium in Eu$_{10}$Hg$_{55}$ might be present in two valence states,
resulting in a fragile magnetic ground state. Due to the cage-like structure
with a large distance between the Eu atoms, those atoms are weakly
ferromagnetically coupled and Eu$_{10}$Hg$_{55}$ orders at low temperatures,
below $T_{1} = 5.5$ K, with a subsequent spin re-orientation at $T_{2} = 4.3$
K. There is no sign of magnetic frustration. Interestingly, the magnetic
ordering of europium sub-lattices results in a magnetization pole reversal with
a weak ferrimagnetic ground state. Additional magnetic phases can be induced by
application of a modest external magnetic field.

Pump-probe spectroscopy is a powerful tool to study ultrafast exciton
dynamics, revealing the underlying complex interactions on the electronic
scale. Despite significant advances in experimental techniques, developing a
comprehensive and rigorous theoretical framework for modeling and interpreting
the transient response in photoexcited materials remains a challenge. Here, we
present a first-principles approach to simulating pump-probe spectroscopy and
disentangling the electronic and thermal contributions underlying exciton
dynamics. We showcase our method to three materials, representative for
different classes of solids: the transition-metal dichalcogenides WSe$_2$, the
halide perovskite CsPbBr$_3$, and the transition-metal oxide TiO$_2$, showing
remarkable agreement with experimental counterparts. We find that (i)
photoinduced Coulomb screening is the primary electronic effect, responsible
for a blue shift of exciton resonances, while (ii) Pauli blocking plays a minor
role, and (iii) thermal lattice expansion leads to a red shift of the spectra.
We further demonstrate how key parameters such as excitation density, pump
photon energy, and pump polarization modulate the transient absorption spectra,
offering direct control over the exciton-resonance energy. Our approach
establishes a quantitative and predictive framework for interpreting pump-probe
experiments, providing actionable insights for the design of energy-selective
optoelectronic devices through exciton engineering.

Due to its multiferroic properties and narrow optical bandgap, Bismuth
ferrite has been widely explored for spintronics, photovoltaics, and
photocatalysis applications. Bismuth ferrite can be synthesized in various
forms like bulk, thin films, and nanostructures using various synthesis
techniques. It is challenging to synthesize the pure BiFeO3 phase due to the
volatile nature of bismuth and the very narrow temperature range for forming
this phase. So, this work aims to synthesize the pure BiFeO3 phase at lower
annealing temperatures using an efficient sol-gel method. We have chosen the
annealing temperature from 450 to 650 C, and a detailed analysis of structural
and optical properties is performed here. X-ray diffraction is used to confirm
the crystalline nature of the material. Single-phase Rietveld analysis of XRD
patterns is carried out to study the effect of annealing temperature on
structural parameters. All the samples are crystalized in pure rhombohedral
BiFeO3 phase with the R3c space group symmetry, except those annealed at higher
temperatures, 600 C and 650 C. Strain and dislocation densities were decreasing
with an increase in the annealing temperature. From the UV-visible analysis, a
strong response is observed below 600 nm in the visible region, and the band
gap from the absorption behaviour is estimated in the range of 2.26 - 2.60 eV
for these Bismuth ferrite nanoparticles. Fourier transform infrared analysis
confirmed the existence of metal-oxygen bonds in Bismuth ferrite nanoparticles.
These nanoparticles were found to be thermally stable from the thermal analysis
performed using differential scanning calorimetry. Bismuth ferrite
nanoparticles were weakly magnetic from the vibrating sample magnetometry
analysis.

### Temperature and magnetic field dependent $g$-factors in electron spin resonance spectroscopy

- **TL;DR**: 该论文提出声子-电子耦合在电子自旋共振现象和测量解释中起重要作用，通过包含自旋轨道耦合产生的自旋相关电子-声子相互作用，揭示了g因子随温度变化的特性。

We propose that phonons coupled to electrons play an important role in both
the fundamental phenomenology of electron spin resonance as well as the
interpretation of such measurements. By including spin-dependent
electron-phonon interactions originating from spin-orbit coupling, we
demonstrate that the g-factor acquires emergent temperature dependencies that
are in excellent agreement with experimental observations. Moreover, we predict
that at low temperatures, the $g$-factor will exhibit a non-trivial dependence
on the magnetic field, indicating a dynamic property that has not been
previously considered in electron-phonon systems. We further predict the
influence of phonons to be negligible at very low and very high temperatures,
with the former requiring experimental verification.

### Electronic structure and thermoelectric properties of CoTiSi half-Heusler alloy: Doping overtones

- **TL;DR**: 使用密度泛函理论研究CoTiSi半赫斯勒合金的热电性能，发现P型掺杂比N型掺杂具有更高的塞贝克电压和热功率

The quest for thermoelectric materials with high figures of merit is an
ongoing and significant area of research. In this study, we investigate the
thermoelectric properties of the CoTiSi half-Heusler alloy using density
functional theory calculations implemented via the Wien2k package. Our approach
begins with a thorough structural optimization to determine the equilibrium
lattice parameter and the atomic positions of the constituent elements within
the unit cell of CoTiSi. Following this, we analyze the thermal transport
properties of the alloy under the constant relaxation time approximation, which
allows us to gain insights into its thermoelectric performance. Our
calculations reveal a substantial Seebeck voltage and thermopower, with notably
higher values for P-type doping than N-type doping. This finding highlights the
enhanced thermoelectric performance of P-type carriers in this material,
providing a starting point for experimentalists to utilize this alloy for real
device applications.

- **TL;DR**: 研究提出了一种模型来描述碱磁控喷涂Cu薄膜中合金元素的结构分布，重点研究了Cu-Nb和Cu-Pd两种对比系统

Structural characterization of nanoscale-two-metal-phase systems, which
exhibit partial, complete, or no mixing when co-sputtered with a few percent of
a minority element, is extremely challenging. Co-sputtering two metals at room
temperature results in frozen disorder within the deposited films.
Distinguishing the contribution of each metal phase, determining the
distribution and self-organization of the second constituent element within the
lattice, accurately quantifying the extra element content, and assessing
internal disorder through diffraction analysis are complex and require the
development of a suitable model to fit diffraction patterns from various
geometries. Here, we present a model to describe the structural distribution of
alloy elements in magnetron-sputtered Cu thin films, exploring two contrasting
cases: 1) with the mutually immiscible Nb and 2) with Pd, which has a negative
heat of mixing with Cu, forming stable alloys. A comparison between X-ray
diffraction data and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy-derived elemental
distribution is discussed.

### Selective band engineering of Bi/Si(111) by boron segregation

Atomically thin layers of metals deposited on semiconductors display a
variety of physical properties such as superconductivity, charge density waves,
topological phases, strong spin-orbit (Rashba) splitting, among others. To
access these exotic phases and induce new ones, it is necessary to control and
tune the energies of the electronic states of those heterostructures. In this
work we investigate the engineering of the band structure of the
two-dimensional Bi/Si(111) $\beta$-phase using a modulation doping approach
based on boron segregation at the surface. We demonstrate that the Bi-induced
Rashba bands can be displaced in energy by up to 200 meV without altering their
strong Rashba parameter. Importantly, while the Bi states shift upward, the
underlying Si valence states remain essentially fixed, which rules out a simple
band-bending scenario. Our density functional theory calculations reveal that
the displacement originates from changes in the hybridization of Si states near
the surface, induced by the presence of B atoms. This selective mechanism
halves the distance of the Rashba-split states from the Fermi level, opening
the way to their exploitation in transport and spintronic devices and
highlighting the broader potential of modulation doping as a band-engineering
strategy for two-dimensional metals on semiconductors.

The La2CoMnO6 (LCMO) perovskite has received a lot of attention due to its
near room temperature magnetodielectric effect. Despite the recent efforts, the
mechanism ruling the correlation between its magnetic and dielectric properties
is not yet fully understood. In order to address this issue, we conducted a
detailed investigation of the coupling between the structural, electronic and
magnetic properties of a polycrystalline LCMO sample. Using magnetic
field-dependent x-ray powder diffraction and measurements with a capacitive
dilatometer, we show that applying an external magnetic field decreases the
unit cell volume, thereby modifying the octahedral distortions. Experiments
involving temperature and field-dependent x-ray absorption spectroscopy at the
Co-L2,3 edges provide further evidence that the spin-orbit interaction of
outermost Co 3d-orbital and the field-induced enhancement of covalence effects
are the key contributors to the magnetostrictive effects. From a detailed
analysis using multiplet and density functional theory calculations, we propose
that the field-induced modulations of the orbital hybridization and the
ligand-to-metal charge transfer are responsible for the changes in the
dielectric response of LCMO, thus enabling a direct coupling between magnetic,
elastic and dielectric properties in this material.

- **TL;DR**: 通过分子动力学模拟发现，低角度晶界对位错传输的阻力主要受弹性相互作用控制，而非传统认为的位错反应主导。螺位错产生剪切应力形成强障碍，刃位错更容易传输。

Low-angle grain boundaries (LAGBs) are often regarded as penetrable
interfaces to dislocation motion, yet recent studies suggest they can also act
as strong barriers. The origin of this duality remains debated, particularly
regarding the role of elastic interactions. Here, large-scale molecular
dynamics simulations are employed to investigate dislocation transmission
across various tilt LAGBs in BCC Fe. The results show that transmission
resistance varies widely with boundary-dislocation geometry. Contrary to the
prevailing view that dislocation reactions dominate, elastic interactions
between lattice and boundary dislocations emerge as the primary controlling
factor. Screw and screw-like dislocations generate shear stresses that bend GB
dislocations and produce strong barriers, whereas edge dislocations lack such
stresses and transmit more readily. Consequently, barrier strength increases as
the dislocation character angle decreases, with screw dislocations experiencing
the strongest resistance. An analytical model is developed that quantitatively
predicts the net transmission stress, in excellent agreement with simulations.
These findings establish a mechanistic framework for LAGB-dislocation
interactions and offer guidance for designing LAGB-strengthened materials.

hyperferroelectrics. These findings highlight the potential of the decoratype
taxonomy to enhance our understanding of structure-driven material properties
and facilitate the discovery of promising yet underexplored regions of chemical
space.

Layered Cr-chalcogenides compounds offer a rich range of phases with
different magnetic properties some of which have been predicted only. Here we
demonstrate a not yet reported crystal phase of CrS2 which is the distorted
octahedral one (1T$'$) synthesized via metal-organic chemical vapour deposition
(MOCVD). We achieved the tuneable synthesis of either 1T$'$ CrS2, or 1T CrS2.
The phases were identified using polarized Raman spectroscopy, density
functional perturbation theory (DFPT) and 4D-scanning transmission electron
microscopy (STEM)-scanning electron diffraction. The phases of CrS2 were
uniquely identified also in contrast with Cr2S3 which was synthesized and
characterized by a Neel temperature of ~46 K. Using magneto-optic Kerr imaging,
the 1T$'$ CrS2 crystals have soft ferromagnetic nature at low temperature,
shedding light on the magnetic properties of this just predicated material. The
4DSTEM characterization reveals that the synthesis of the thermodynamically
stable 1T$'$ phase occurs via a complex transformation process from the 1T to
1T$'$ resulting in a spatially correlated domain structure of differently
oriented 1T$'$ crystals. Our MOCVD growth of complex and distorted phases of 2D
CrS2 with long-range magnetic order paves the way for the scalable synthesis of
2D magnets for ultrathin magnetic memories for logic-in-memory applications and
spintronics.
