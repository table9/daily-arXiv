- **TL;DR**: 通过单轴压缩应变在La2-xBaxCuO4单晶中诱导结构相分离，产生三种不同超导行为的结构：LTT、LTLO和PDNS相，展示了超导性对材料结构的高度敏感性

Strain engineering has attracted significant attention in recent years due to
its capability in tuning lattice and electronic structures of quantum
materials. Using moderate uniaxial compressive strain, we induce structural
phase separation in the low-temperature phase of x=1/8 La2-xBaxCuO4 (LBCO)
single crystals. These structures are low temperature tetragonal (LTT), low
temperature less orthorhombic (LTLO), and a plastically deformed nano-domain
structure (PDNS), comprised of few-nanometer-sized orthorhombic domains within
an amorphous matrix. These three structures exhibit distinct superconducting
behaviors. The volume fraction of the LTT structure is suppressed with
increasing strain, while its superconducting transition temperature increases
and broadens. The LTLO structure exhibits a sharp superconducting transition
above 32 K, which increases up to ~36 K at maximum strain. The PDNS phase
exhibits a very broad superconducting transition and persists even after
removing the strain. Our study illustrates the sensitivity of superconductivity
to the structure of the LBCO sample near its stripe instability.

- **TL;DR**: PT对称反铁磁双层系统表现出非常规约瑟夫森效应，具有电场可调的0-π振荡和约瑟夫森巨磁阻效应

We propose that unconventional Josephson effects typically emerge in {\it
PT}-symmetric antiferromagnetic (AFM) bilayer systems. When proximitized by a
conventional superconductor, these systems host dominant interlayer Cooper
pairing that features a distinctive spin texture enabled by the strong exchange
field. Specifically, we demonstrate a novel mechanism for electrically tunable
0-$\pi$ oscillations in lateral Josephson junctions, controlled by an
out-of-plane electric displacement field. This behavior originates from
field-induced finite-momentum Cooper pairing, a hallmark of the unique
layer-pseudospin structure in {\it PT}-symmetric AFM bilayers. Furthermore, we
introduce a Josephson giant magnetoresistor based on these exotic
spin-layer-locked Cooper pairs, in which the supercurrent exhibits a strong
dependence on the internal N\'{e}el order. Our findings establish {\it
PT}-symmetric AFM bilayers as a versatile platform for phase-controllable
Josephson junctions and superconducting magnetic random-access memory, with
promising applications in superconducting circuits and ultralow-power
computing.

- **TL;DR**: 本文通过超越平均场理论，结合Nambu-Goldstone相位涨落和Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless涨落，解释了单层WTe₂中门电压可调超导性的异常现象，包括载流子密度对Tc的不同依赖关系和超导涨落突然消失等现象。

The recently reported gate-tunable superconductivity in monolayer WTe$_2$
exhibits several striking anomalies beyond the standard paradigm, including a
contrasting carrier-density dependence of the transition temperature $T_c$ in
weakly and strongly disordered regimes and more surprisingly, the sudden
disappearance of superconducting fluctuations below a critical carrier density.
To understand these features, we go beyond the mean-field theory to treat the
superconducting gap and superfluid density by explicitly incorporating both
Nambu-Goldstone (NG) phase fluctuations and Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless
(BKT) fluctuations. We show that these fluctuations are minimal in the
weak-disorder regime but become crucial under strong disorder, where the
zero-temperature gap renormalized by NG quantum fluctuations becomes
density-dependent while the BKT fluctuations drive the superconducting $T_c$
below the gap-closing temperature. Simulations within this unified framework
combining with the density-functional-theory input to account for the excitonic
instability quantitatively reproduced nearly all key experimental observations
in monolayer WTe$_2$, providing a consistent understanding of reported
anomalies.

The discovery of superconductivity in nickelate compounds has opened new
avenues in the study of high-temperature superconductors. Here we provide a
comprehensive overview of recent progress in the field, including all different
nickelate systems, reduced-Ruddlesden-Popper-type infinite layer LaNiO$_2$,
Ruddlesden-Popper-type bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and trilayer
La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. We begin by introducing the superconducting properties of
the hole-doped LaNiO$_2$ system, which marked the starting point for nickelate
superconductivity. We then turn to the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ system,
discussing both its high-pressure and thin-film superconducting phases. This is
followed by an examination of the trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ system and
other related multilayer nickelates. Throughout the review, we highlight
emerging trends, key challenges, and open questions. We conclude by addressing
current limitations in materials synthesis and characterization, and future
directions that may help uncover the mechanisms driving superconductivity in
these complex oxide systems.

### Critical Majorana fermion at a topological quantum Hall bilayer transition

- **TL;DR**: 采用棉球正则化方法识别了量子震监双层中Halperin状态向Moore-Read Pfaffian状态过渡的低能谱，证实该过渡对应3D谱化Majorana共形场论，解决了长期以来关于这种拓扑相变过渡性质的问题

Quantum Hall bilayers are a uniquely tunable platform that can realize
continuous transitions between distinct topological phases of matter. One
prominent example is the transition between the Halperin state and the
Moore--Read Pfaffian, long predicted to host a critical theory of Majorana
fermions but so far not verified in unbiased microscopic simulations. Using the
fuzzy sphere regularization, we identify the low-energy spectrum at this
transition with the 3D gauged Majorana conformal field theory. We show that the
transition is driven by the closing of the neutral fermion gap, and we directly
extract the operator content in both integer and half-integer spin sectors. Our
results resolve the long-standing question of the nature of a topological phase
transition in a setting relevant to quantum Hall experiments, while also
providing the first realization of a fermionic theory on the fuzzy sphere,
previously limited to bosonic theories.

### Electronic Fluctuations and Ionic Dynamics in Molten Silver Iodide

- **TL;DR**: 本文研究了熔融AgI中电子波动对离子结构和动力学的影响，发现碘离子的定向极化波动增强了银离子的扩散，而经验力场因忽略动态电子波动无法准确模拟这些效应。

Molten salts are high-temperature ionic liquids whose unique combination of
strong Coulombic interactions, large polarizabilities, and high ionic
conductivities makes them central to energy storage, metallurgy, and nuclear
technology. Understanding their delicate balance of Coulomb forces, short-range
repulsion, and electronic polarization, particularly regarding the role that
electronic fluctuations play in their structure and dynamics, is critical to
predictively designing molten salts for applications of interest. We
investigate the importance of electronic fluctuations in molten AgI using
density functional theory, a universal machine learning model (Orb), and a
classical, empirical pairwise model of interionic interactions. We find that
directional polarization fluctuations of iodide ions enhance Ag+ diffusion,
manifesting as enhanced force fluctuations and structure in the time-dependent
friction experienced by the cations. The coupling between iodide polarization
fluctuations and silver diffusion creates a dynamic asymmetry; Ag+ motion is
tightly linked to the instantaneous polarization of neighboring I-, whereas I-
dynamics are relatively unperturbed by electronic fluctuations. For all
structural and dynamic quantities investigated, the Orb model is in excellent
agreement with density functional theory-based simulations, highlighting the
ability of this universal neural network potential to capture many-body
polarization effects. In contrast, the empirical force field fails to reproduce
key structural and dynamic quantities involving cations, ultimately because it
neglects dynamic electronic fluctuations. Our findings connect liquid=state
ionic dynamics with the "electronic paddle-wheel" mechanism of ionic diffusion
in superionic solids and motivate further exploration of polarization
fluctuation effects in complex electrolytes and ionic liquids.

### Residence-time theory applied to circulating-fuel reactors: zero-power analysis

- **TL;DR**: 这篇论文提出了一种基于停留时间理论的模型，用于分析循环燃料反应堆中延迟中子前驱体的运输和再循环效应，能够预测静态反应性损失和动态响应特性。

Circulating-fuel reactors (CFRs) lose reactivity when delayed-neutron
precursors (DNPs) drift out of the core and may regain part of it when the fuel
re-enters the core. This paper formulates a physics-based description of both
effects by combining DNP transport with residence-time theory. Then, treating
the core and ex-core regions as two mixing volumes in series, closed-form
expressions for (i) the static reactivity loss due to precursor drift and (ii)
the zero-power transfer function that governs linearised dynamics are derived.
When the gamma residence-time distributions are used, the new framework is
shown to reduce to the plug-flow and Continuous-Stirred-Tank-Reactor limits as
special cases, while generalising to intermediate mixing regimes via a single
parameter: the degree of mixing. Performed parameter studies show that DNP
recirculation has the highest impact when core and ex-core residence times are
comparable and the product of the DNP decay constant and the in-core residence
time is small. Benchmarks against the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment are able
to reproduce the measured static loss ($k_0 \approx 0.32$ \$) and its frequency
response, with $\approx$20% of the steady-state DNP worth arising from
recirculation. Additionally, for the EVOL reference Molten-Salt Fast Reactor
the model is shown to agree well with the results of high-fidelity Serpent-2
calculations coupled with Computational Fluid Dynamics. Overall, the
residence-time approach offers a computationally light yet versatile tool for
sensitivity studies and generation of physical intuition for the behaviour of
CFRs. Foundation for extensions to importance weighting of DNPs and application
of the framework to time-domain analysis is also briefly sketched.

### Reinterpretation of chiral anomaly on a lattice

- **TL;DR**: 通过高维陈数绝缘体构建了整个布里渥区的无质量戰克拉费米子有效模型，发现手性异常系数C5在象征面上精确量化，并提出手性异常的梯子解释：由象征面以下远处的对称性破碎状态引起，但被局部手性对称性保护。

The chiral anomaly is a quantum mechanical effect for massless Dirac fermions
in both particle physics and condensed matter physics. Here we present a set of
effective models for single massless Dirac fermions in one- and
three-dimensions in the whole Brillouin zone from higher-dimensional Chern
insulators, which uniquely capture both the chiral fermion behavior near the
Dirac point and high-energy states at Brillouin zone boundaries. In the
presence of electromagnetic fields, the chiral coefficient $C_{5}$ is found to
be chemical-potential dependent in general, but quantized precisely at the
Fermi surface where chiral symmetry is preserved. This result provides an
alternative interpretation of chiral anomaly on a lattice: the anomaly is
caused by the symmetry-broken states far below the Fermi surface, and protected
by the local chiral symmetry. Our analysis here might provide a potential
theoretical foundation for applying the concept of chiral anomaly in condensed
matter physics.

### PyPAS -- Python package for Positron Annihilation Spectroscopy Doppler Broadening Analysis

- **TL;DR**: PyPAS是一个开源的Python软件包，用于正电子湮没光谱分析，解决了传统VEDB分析工具界面过时和缺乏集成的问题，提供了CDB滤波、二维分析、扩散方程求解等功能。

Doppler Broadening (DB) of annihilation radiation is a well-established
technique within Positron Annihilation Spectroscopy (PAS), used for probing the
electronic structure of materials. The analysis of DB experimental data relies
on gamma spectroscopy analysis tools, while depth profiling using
variable-energy slow positron beams depends on solving the positron diffusion
equation. Traditional Variable Energy Doppler Broadening (VEDB) analysis tools,
such as VEPFIT and ROYPROF, often present limitations due to outdated
interfaces and lack of integration with comprehensive spectroscopy analysis
platforms. Addressing these challenges, an open-source Python package for PAS
analysis, PyPAS, is introduced. PyPAS offers functionalities including
Coincidence Doppler Broadening (CDB) filtering, two-dimensional CDB analysis
with DB and resolution extraction, and computation of lineshape parameters (S
and W). Furthermore, it integrates modules for generating thermal positron
implantation profiles based on established models, solving positron diffusion
equations using finite-difference methods and optimizing diffusion length. This
work presents the architecture of the PyPAS package and the validation results
and demonstrates the application of the package through case studies.

### Self-organized hyperuniformity in a minimal model of population dynamics

- **TL;DR**: 该研究在群体动力学模型中发现了新的超均匀性现象，该模型考虑了生物记忆和表观遗传，通过个体对共享资源的竞争达到临界稳态，并表现出超均匀密度波动。

We identify a novel scenario for hyperuniformity in a generic model of
population dynamics that has been recently introduced to account for biological
memory in the immune system and epigenetic inheritance. In this model,
individuals' competition over a shared resource guides the population towards a
critical steady state with prolonged individual life time. Here we uncover that
the spatially extended model is characterized by hyperuniform density
fluctuations. A hydrodynamic theory is derived by explicit coarse-graining,
which shows good agreement with numerical simulations. Unlike previous models
for non-equilibrium hyperuniform states, our model does not exhibit
conservation laws, even when approaching criticality. Instead, we trace the
emergence of hyperuniformity to the divergence of timescales close to
criticality. These findings can have applications in engineering, cellular
population dynamics and ecology.

### Weakly superconducting anisotropy in 4Hb-Nb0.95Ti0.05Se2 with 1T/1H heterostructure

Heterostructures of layered transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) exhibit
rich physical properties by the combination of strong electronic correlation
effects in 1T layer and superconductivity in 1H layer. But the limited number
of bulk TMD materials with such heterostructures impedes the in-depth
understanding of the physical mechanisms behind these properties, as well as
research on tuning of these properties. Here, we report a systematic study on
physical properties of the 4Hb-Nb0.95Ti0.05Se2 single crystals with 1T/1H
heterostructure. It exhibits a superconducting transition at temperature below
3.3 K. Further analysis indicates that 4Hb-Nb0.95Ti0.05Se2 is an intermediately
coupled type-II superconductor. Moreover, 4Hb-Nb0.95Ti0.05Se2 shows a rather
weak superconducting anisotropy (~ 2), distinctly different from other known
TMD superconductors with 4Hb heterostructure.

### Hidden frustration in the triangular-lattice antiferromagnet NdCd3P3

- **TL;DR**: NdCd3P3三角晶格反铁磁体中的Nd3+磁矩存在隐藏的阻挫迹象，表现为远高于TN温度下的Kramers基态和第一激发态双峰分裂，以及低能涨落特征。

We report a study of the magnetic ground state and crystal electric field
(CEF) scheme in the triangular-lattice antiferromagnet NdCd$_3$P$_3$. Combined
neutron scattering, magnetization, and heat capacity measurements demonstrate
that the Nd$^{3+}$ moments occupying the triangular lattice in this material
harbor hidden signs of frustration not detected in typical Curie-Weiss-based
parameterization of the frustration index ($f=\Theta_{CW} / T_N$). This is
evidenced by a zero-field splitting of the Kramers' ground state and first
excited state doublets at temperatures far in excess of $T_N$ as well as
signatures of low-energy fluctuations for $T&gt;&gt;T_N$. A suppression of the
zero-field ordered moment relative to its field saturation value is observed,
and the impacts of this magnetic frustration as well as the coexisting bond
frustration in the CdP honeycomb network on the physical properties of
NdCd$_3$P$_3$ are discussed.

### Configuration-interaction calculations with density-functional theory molecular orbitals for modeling valence- and core-excited states in molecules

- **TL;DR**: 使用DFT轨道作为基组进行CI计算，用于改进核心激发态建模，在具有强电子相关效应但弱多参考性质的分子（如CO2）中表现优于标准HF基CI，与多参考CI相当

We investigate configuration-interaction (CI) calculations on a basis of
molecular orbitals generated by preliminary density-functional theory (DFT)
calculations. We use this CI/DFT framework to improve the modeling of
core-excited states by exploiting the flexibility and account for electron
correlation of DFT orbitals compared to the canonical Hartree-Fock analogs. We
assess the performance of our approach on the valence- and core-excited
electronic states of three molecules with increasing levels of
electron-correlation complexity: the singly bonded CH4, doubly bonded CO2, and
triply bonded N2. For molecules with strong electron correlation effects, such
as CO2 and N2, the inclusion of double excitations is important to model the
core-hole excited states with reasonable accuracy. CI/DFT outperforms standard
single-reference CI on Hartree-Fock molecular orbitals and competes with
multi-reference CI calculations with multi-configuration self-consistent field
orbitals in the modeling of molecules with strong electron-correlation effects,
but weak multi-reference nature of their wave function such as CO2. In
contrast, the choice of the molecular-orbital basis is irrelevant when modeling
systems with negligible electron-correlation effects like CH4 or important
multi-reference nature of their wave function like N2.

### DDNet: A Unified Physics-Informed Deep Learning Framework for Semiconductor Device Modeling

- **TL;DR**: DDNet是一个基于物理信息的深度学习求解器，用于半导体器件建模中的漂移扩散方程，能够同时解决正向和逆向问题，相比传统仿真软件具有计算效率优势。

The accurate modeling of semiconductor devices plays a critical role in the
development of new technology nodes and next-generation devices. Semiconductor
device designers largely rely on advanced simulation software to solve the
drift-diffusion equations, a coupled system of nonlinear partial differential
equations that describe carrier transport in semiconductor devices. While these
tools perform well for forward modeling, they are not suitable to address
inverse problems, for example, determining doping profiles, material, and
geometrical parameters given a desired device performance. Meanwhile,
physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have grown in popularity in recent
years thanks to their ability to efficiently and accurately solve inverse
problems at minimal computational cost compared to forward problems. In this
study, we introduce the Drift-Diffusion Network (DDNet), a unified
physics-informed deep learning solver for the forward and inverse mesh-free
solutions of the drift-diffusion equations of semiconductor device modeling.
Using prototypical device configurations in one- and two spatial dimensions, we
show that DDNet achieves low absolute and relative error compared to
traditional simulation software while additionally solving user-defined inverse
problems with minimal computational overhead. We expect that DDNet will benefit
semiconductor device modeling by facilitating exploration and discovery of
novel device structures across comprehensive parameter sets in a fully
automated way.

### Sb doping effect on transport behavior in the topological insulator Bi2Se3

- **TL;DR**: 通过锑掺杂调控MBE生长的Bi2Se3薄膜费米能级，获得优异拓扑表面传导，但EuS异质结构中未实现表面态长程磁有序，强调界面质量对交换耦合的关键作用

Bismuth selenide (Bi2Se3) is a good topological insulator (TI) with its
surface band Dirac point inside the bulk bandgap. However, Bi2Se3 films grown
by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) often require tuning of Fermi level near the
Dirac point for optimal proximity effect with magnetic or superconducting
materials. In this study, we achieve the control of the Fermi level in
MBE-grown Bi2Se3 thin films by antimony (Sb) doping and systematically
investigate the transport properties of these Bi2-xSbxSe3 films with different
doping concentrations. Excellent topological surface conduction is attained,
and weak antilocalization is observed in all Sb-doped Bi2Se3 films. While the
carrier mobility shows no dependence on the Sb concentrations, indicating that
the phonon scattering dominates over the impurity scattering from Sb dopants,
the coherence length varies significantly with the Sb doping level at low
temperatures (&lt; 30 K), highlighting the non-negligible electron-electron
interactions in the low temperature regime. Furthermore, EuS/Bi2-xSbxSe3
heterostructures are fabricated to explore proximity-induced ferromagnetism in
the TI surface states. However, the long-range magnetic order is not formed in
the TI surface states under our growth conditions. Our results emphasize the
critical role of interface quality for realizing exchange coupling. This work
offers new insights into the interplay of disorder, decoherence, and scattering
mechanisms in Sb-doped Bi2Se3 thin films, providing guidance for the future
study of the proximity effect in heterostructures involving Sb-doped Bi2Se3.

We propose Josephson junction arrays as realistic platforms for observing
nonequilibrium scaling laws characterizing the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ)
universality class, and space-time soliton proliferation. Focusing on a
two-chain ladder geometry, we perform numerical simulations for the roughness
function. Together with analytical arguments, our results predict KPZ scaling
at intermediate time scales, extending over sufficiently long time scales to be
observable, followed by a crossover to the asymptotic long-time regime governed
by soliton proliferation.

### Laser-engineered $Γ$-point Topology in Trigonal Bismuthene

The $\Gamma$-point topology represents a significant segment in the family of
topological insulators. Here we provide a comprehensive prediction of
light-induced $\Gamma$-point-based topological manipulation in trigonal
bismuthene and its derivatives. Our findings unveil a two-stage process of
topological phase transitions (TPT) as the laser intensity increases.
Initially, a quantum-spin-Hall or metallic state transitions to a
quantum-anomalous-Hall (QAH) state ($C$ = $\pm$3), followed by another TPT that
yields a compensated Chern-insulating state ($C$ = 0). The trigonal warping
model accounts for these states, describing the $C_{3z}$-rotational
band-inversion process, which is determined by $\pm$1 orders of replica bands.
Notably, this high Chern-number QAH state persists over a broad range of laser
parameters, maintaining functionality beyond room temperature as evidenced by
the large global gaps ($\geq$ 60 meV). Our work provides a comprehensive
roadmap towards the designer $\Gamma$-point topology under laser excitation,

- **TL;DR**: 本文研究发现铜酸盐由于固有的电荷转移特性，铜价态被钉扎在+2.3附近，无法达到d⁸电子构型，从而阻碍了双轨道超导机制，解释了铜酸盐家族普遍存在的稳健单轨道物理现象。

The recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in the bilayer
nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has spurred intense interest in exploring analogous
mechanisms in other transition metal oxides. This raises a pivotal question:
can cuprates, as neighbors to nickelates in the periodic table, host similar
two-orbital superconductivity? Here, we systematically investigate the
electronic structure of a series of designed Ruddlesden-Popper cuprates. Our
calculations reveal that the parent compound La$_3$Cu$_2$O$_7$ is a weakly
correlated metal, and hole-doping fails to induce strong correlation. We find
that the actual valence of the copper cations becomes strikingly pinned around
+2.3, far away from the targeted $d^8$ configuration. This valence pinning is
attributed to the inherent charge-transfer nature of cuprates. We propose this
mechanism as a general principle explaining the robust single-orbital physics
consistently observed in the cuprate family, holding true even in materials
like the high-$T_c$ superconductor Ba$_2$CuO$_{3+\delta}$ that appear
structurally primed for two-orbital activity. Our results therefore conclude
that the route towards two-orbital superconductivity is fundamentally
obstructed in cuprates, providing a crucial constraint for the future design of
high-temperature superconductors.

We report the experimental realization of a spin-1/2 extended diamond chain
in a verdazyl-Cu complex, where competing interactions and lattice distortions
give rise to exotic quantum phases. The magnetic properties exhibit a
zero-field energy gap and 1/2 magnetization plateau, which is explained by a
dimer-monomer model. Considering the effective interactions between the
monomers, three types of dimer-dimer phases are expected to appear as the
ground state, depending on the magnitude of the lattice distortions. By mapping
to the nonlinear sigma model, three phases are distinguished topologically, and
a symmetry-protected topological phase equivalent to the Haldane phase is
identified. Furthermore, a nontrivial magnetization is observed above the 1/2
plateau region, suggesting a gapped dimer phase accompanied by a spontaneous
breaking of translational symmetry. The discovery of this rare quantum state
has broad implications for strongly correlated systems, topological matter, and
quantum information science, where symmetry and topology play crucial roles.

The multiphoton ionization of the simplest aromatic amine, aniline, was
examined utilizing a kinetic energy-correlated time-of-flight mass spectrometer
at a wavelength of 266 nm. The primary and secondary fragment channels have
been identified, and their plausible internal energy dependence has been
discussed. Furthermore, the sequential loss fragment channel has been analyzed
using the energy-correlated mass spectrum, revealing the fragment channels
along with their respective parent mass exclusively. The computed energetics
are corroborated with the experimental findings to further support the
dissociation hierarchy.

### Generative Quasi-Continuum Modeling of Confined Fluids at the Nanoscale

- **TL;DR**: 一种基于条件去噪液体力学模型的多尺度框架，通过结合有限AIMD数据预测密度分布，实现了比传统模拟方法更高效的计算速度和数据效率。

We present a data-efficient, multiscale framework for predicting the density
profiles of confined fluids at the nanoscale. While accurate density estimates
require prohibitively long timescales that are inaccessible by ab initio
molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations, machine-learned molecular dynamics
(MLMD) offers a scalable alternative, enabling the generation of force
predictions at ab initio accuracy with reduced computational cost. However,
despite their efficiency, MLMD simulations remain constrained by femtosecond
timesteps, which limit their practicality for computing long-time averages
needed for accurate density estimation. To address this, we propose a
conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) based
quasi-continuum approach that predicts the long-time behavior of force profiles
along the confinement direction, conditioned on noisy forces extracted from a
limited AIMD dataset. The predicted smooth forces are then linked to continuum
theory via the Nernst-Planck equation to reveal the underlying density
behavior. We test the framework on water confined between two graphene
nanoscale slits and demonstrate that density profiles for channel widths
outside of the training domain can be recovered with ab initio accuracy.
Compared to AIMD and MLMD simulations, our method achieves orders-of-magnitude
speed-up in runtime and requires significantly less training data than prior
works.

In this work, we investigate the coupling between a strong impurity and the
topological boundary of an SSH heterojunction, composed of two SSH chains
belonging to different topological classes. We show that impurity boundary
coupling gives rise to bonding and antibonding states within the SSH bulk gap.
This coupling produces an interference effect in the local density of states,
as the impurity approaches the boundary the LDOS evolves from a single sharp
peak to a characteristic double peak structure. Moreover, the interference
strength can be quantified by the decay length of the bonding or antibonding
wavefunction and by the energy splitting of the LDOS resonance peaks near the
Fermi energy.

We provide an overview of studies of hysteresis in models of magnets. We
discuss the shape of the hysteresis loop, dynamical symmetry breaking, and the
dependence of the area of the loop on the amplitude and frequency of the
driving field. The Barkhausen noise in the hysteresis loop may be modelled by
the wide distribution of sizes of magnetization jumps in the random-field Ising
model. We discuss the distribution of sizes of these jumps in the random field
Ising model on the Bethe lattice.

### Highly tunable Gilbert damping in two-dimensional van der Waals ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2: From bilayer to the twisted bilayer

- **TL;DR**: 研究通过第一原理计算分析了Fe3GaTe2双层和扩射双层的Gilbert渝氧阻尾水平，发现扩射结构可以有效降低垂直磁化方向的渝氧阻尾水平并显著增强方向各异性。

Van der Waals ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2 possesses both a high Curie temperature
and robust perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, holding promise for practical
spintronic applications. In particular, understanding and engineering its
Gilbert damping which determines magnetization dynamics are crucial for its
applications. Here, we investigate the Gilbert damping of bilayer and the
twisted bilayer Fe3GaTe2 through first-principles calculations. For the bilayer
Fe3GaTe2, we obtain a quite low Gilbert damping when its magnetization is along
the z axis at room temperature. In addition, the bilayer Fe3GaTe2 exhibits a
large orientational anisotropy of Gilbert damping when its magnetization is
rotated from the magnetic easy axis to the hard one. Such anisotropy is
attributed to the distinct band structures caused by the anisotropic spin-orbit
coupling. Surprisingly, we find that twisting the bilayer Fe3GaTe2 can
effectively reduce the Gilbert damping for the perpendicular magnetization, and
enhance the orientational anisotropy of Gilbert damping up to 635% when
rotating the magnetization from the magnetic easy axis to the hard one. These
findings open up an entirely new avenue for the manipulation of Gilbert damping
and its anisotropy in two-dimensional van der Waals ferromagnets.

### Terahertz nonlinear response in cuprate superconductors and the Higgs field in doped Mott insulators

- **TL;DR**: 本文解释了铜酸盐中反常的三次谐波产生现象，发现超导相和赝能隙相中都存在THG信号，但在超导转变时出现π相位偏移。

A puzzling phenomenon has been recently revealed in terahertz nonlinear
optical response experiments: A third harmonic generation (THG) signal,
identified only in the superconducting (SC) phase in a conventional BCS
superconductor, is found to persist into a wide pseudogap regime in the
underdoped cuprate, accompanied by a $\pi$ phase shift in the THG signal across
the SC transition. In this paper, we offer a consistent understanding of such
an unconventional phenomenon based on an emergent Higgs mode of the condensed
holons in the doped Mott insulator. Specifically, in the lower pseudogap phase
(LPP) where, although the holons still remain Bose condensed, the SC phase
coherence gets disordered by excited spinons, which induce vortex-like
responses from the holon condensate. By coupling to such internal fluctuations
described by a mutual Chern-Simons gauge theory, we show that an external
electromagnetic field can indeed produce the optical THG response in both the
SC and LPP states, which are distinguished by a $\pi$ phase shift with a
substantial suppression of the THG signal in the latter regime at higher
temperatures.

We report a systematic investigation of isomer- and state-dependent reactions
between Coulomb-crystallised laser-cooled Ca$^+$ ions and
\emph{cis/trans}-1,2-dichloroethene (DCE) isomers. By manipulating the
electronic state populations of Ca$^+$ through tuning of laser cooling
parameters, we observed distinct reactivities in its ground and excited states,
as well as with the geometric isomers of DCE. Our experiments revealed two
primary reaction channels, formation of CaCl$^+$ and C$_2$HCaCl$^+$, followed
by secondary reaction pathways. While excited-state reactions proceed at rate
coefficients consistent with capture theory predictions, ground-state reactions
show a systematically lower reactivity. \emph{Ab initio} calculations of
reaction pathways suggest that this suppression stems from the formation of
long-lived reaction complexes. The \textit{cis} isomer was found to exhibit a
higher reactivity with all electronic states of Ca$^+$ than its \textit{trans}
counterpart. The present study provides insights into the combined effects of
molecular structure and quantum states influencing ion-molecule reaction
dynamics.

- **TL;DR**: PCGBandit方法通过在线学习自适应求解器配置，在OpenFOAM中实现了瞬态PDE模拟的一次性加速

Data-driven acceleration of scientific computing workflows has been a
high-profile aim of machine learning (ML) for science, with numerical
simulation of transient partial differential equations (PDEs) being one of the
main applications. The focus thus far has been on methods that require
classical simulations to train, which when combined with the data-hungriness
and optimization challenges of neural networks has caused difficulties in
demonstrating a convincing advantage against strong classical baselines. We
consider an alternative paradigm in which the learner uses a classical solver's
own data to accelerate it, enabling a one-shot speedup of the simulation.
Concretely, since transient PDEs often require solving a sequence of related
linear systems, the feedback from repeated calls to a linear solver such as
preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) can be used by a bandit algorithm to
online-learn an adaptive sequence of solver configurations (e.g.
preconditioners). The method we develop, PCGBandit, is implemented directly on
top of the popular open source software OpenFOAM, which we use to show its
effectiveness on a set of fluid and magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) problems.

Two-dimensional (2D) materials have disrupted materials science due to the
development of van der Waals technology. It enables the stacking of ultrathin
layers of materials characterized by vastly different electronic structures to
create man-made heterostructures and devices with rationally tailored
properties, circumventing limitations of matching crystal structures, lattice
constants, and geometry of constituent materials and supporting substrates. 2D
materials exhibit extraordinary mechanical flexibility, strong light-matter
interactions driven by their excitonic response, single photon emission from
atomic centers, stable ferromagnetism in sub-nm thin films, fractional quantum
Hall effect in high-quality devices, and chemoselectivity at ultrahigh
surface-to-volume ratio. Consequently, van der Waals heterostructures with
atomically flat interfaces demonstrate an unprecedented degree of intertwined
mechanical, chemical, optoelectronic, and magnetic properties. This constitutes
a foundation for multiproperty sensing, based on complex intra- and
intermaterial interactions, and a robust response to external stimuli
originating from the environment. Here, we review recent progress in the
development of sensing applications with 2D materials, highlighting the areas
where van der Waals heterostructures offer the highest sensitivity,
simultaneous responses to multiple distinct externalities due to their atomic
thickness in conjunction with unique material combinations, and conceptually
new sensing methodology.

### Constraint correlation functions of the Ising model in the scaling limit

We study the correlation function of the one-dimensional Ising model at fixed
magnetization. Focusing on the scaling limit close to the zero-temperature
fixed point, we show that this correlation function, in momentum space,
exhibits surprising oscillations as a function of the magnetization. We show
that these oscillations have a period inversely proportional to the momentum
and give an interpretation in terms of domain walls. This is in sharp contrast
with the behavior of the correlation function in constant magnetic fields, and
sheds light on recent results obtained by Monte Carlo simulations of the
critical two-dimensional Ising model at fixed magnetization.

Moir\'e superlattices of transition-metal dichalcogenide bilayers host strong
Coulomb interactions residing in narrow electron bands, leading to correlated
insulating states at fractional carrier doping densities, known as generalized
Wigner crystals. In excited states, the formation of moir\'e excitons is
expected to be fundamentally shaped by the Wigner-crystal ground states,
manifesting an intricate interplay between electronic and excitonic
correlations. However, the microscopic description of these Wigner crystalline
excitons (WCEs) remains elusive, largely subject to speculations, and is
further needed for the understanding of exotic excitonic phases (e.g., exciton
insulators and exciton density waves) and their unique properties (e.g.,
anomalous exciton diffusion). Here, using first-principles many-body
GW-Bethe-Salpeter-equation calculations, we directly reveal the internal
structures of WCEs in angle-aligned MoSe2/MoS2 moir\'e heterostructure at hole
fillings of 1/3 and 2/3. Our results unveil the propagation of correlation
effects from the ground state to excited states, shaping the real-space
characteristics of WCEs. The strong two-particle excitonic correlations
dominate over the kinetic energy of free electron-hole pairs, in analog to the
strong single-particle correlations of flat bands. We propose that such unusual
excited-state correlation effects of WCEs can be experimentally probed by
photocurrent tunneling microscopy. Our work provides a microscopic
understanding of strongly correlated WCEs, suggesting them as a highly tunable
mixed boson-fermion platform to study many-body interactions and phenomena.

We investigate an approximation to the Schwinger-Dyson (SD) equations of the
collective Coulomb field of the large $N$ homogeneous electron fluid. The large
$N$ approximation transforms the infinite SD hierarchy is into a set of closed,

model - a small square Euclidean lattice with periodic boundary conditions -
are considered. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo numerical method evaluated the 1

derived equations are checked with the correlator values, and an agreement at
$N \sim 10^3$ to order $10^{-3}$ was found. The agreement can be further
strengthened by increasing runs in the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method.

- **TL;DR**: 使用Keldysh-Langevin分子动力学研究DNA分子结在电子电流作用下的非平衡机械运动，发现电子力会重塑势能面，在低电压下缩短DNA寿命，但在高电压下反而重新稳定结结构。

We investigate the non-equilibrium mechanical motion of double-stranded DNA
in a molecular junction under electronic current using Keldysh-Langevin
molecular dynamics. Non-equilibrium electronic force reshapes the effective
potential energy surface, and along with electronic viscosity force and
stochastic force, governs voltage-dependent dynamics of DNA's collective
mechanical coordinate. We compute mean first-passage times to quantify the
non-equilibrium lifetime of the DNA junction. At low voltage biases,
electron-mechanical motion coupling destabilises DNA by shifting the potential
minimum towards critical displacement and suppressing barriers, shortening
lifetimes by several orders of magnitude. Unexpectedly, at higher voltages the
trend reverses: the potential minimum shifts away from instability and the
barrier re-emerges, producing re-stabilisation of the junction. In addition, we
demonstrate the Landauer blowtorch effect in this system: coordinate-dependent
fluctuations generate a spatially varying effective temperature, changing
current-induced dynamics of mechanical degrees of freedom. Apparent
temperatures of DNA mechanical motion increase far above ambient due to
current-induced heating, correlating with suppressed electronic current at
stronger couplings. Our results reveal a non-equilibrium interplay between
current-driven forces, dissipation, and fluctuations in DNA junctions,
establishing mechanisms for both destabilisation and recovery of DNA stability
under electronic current.

Curved magnets offer a rich phase diagram and hold great promise for
next-generation spintronic technologies. This study establishes the paramount
significance of high-order vortex states (e.g., 3$\varphi$ with winding number
$n$ &gt; 1) in VSe2 nanotubes, which uniquely enable magnonic functionalities
fundamentally inaccessible to conventional magnetic systems. These states arise
from diameter-dependent competition between the nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic
($J_1$) and longer-range antiferromagnetic ($J_2$/$J_3$) couplings, as
rigorously validated through density-functional theory calculations and
Heisenberg modeling of phase diagrams. Critically, by the
Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, we find that high-order vortex configurations
unlock an intrinsic hybridization mechanism governed by strict orbital angular
momentum (OAM) selection rules ($\Delta l = \pm 2(n-1)$) -- a process strictly
forbidden in fundamental vortices ($n$ = 1) -- generating complex high-OAM
magnons with measurable topological charge. This is vividly demonstrated in the
3$\varphi$ state, where hybridization between $l$ = -4, 0 and 4 modes produces
eight-petal magnon density patterns. Such states provide an essential
platform-free solution for generating high-OAM magnons, wchich is crucial for
spin-wave-based information transport. These findings establish a predictive
theoretical framework for controlling high-order vortex states in curved
magnets and highlight VSe2 nanotubes as a promising platform for exploring
complex magnetism and developing future magnonic and spintronic devices.

We consider a one-dimensional run-and-tumble particle (RTP) confined by an
external potential and coupled to a thermal reservoir. Starting from the
corresponding Fokker-Planck equation, we derive an explicit expression for the
local entropy flux between the system and the heat bath. We then construct a
thermodynamic representation of the RTP dynamics, modeling the system as an
overdamped particle in a medium with a spatially inhomogeneous effective
temperature field, determined directly from the entropy flux. This forms the
basis of an Inverse Clausius Thermodynamics framework, in which thermodynamic
quantities are inferred from entropy exchange with the heat bath rather than
postulated. In addition to an exact expression for the entropy flux, the
framework introduces a physically motivated approximation for evaluating the
local entropy production rate. The approach is computationally efficient and
broadly applicable, and is particularly well suited for RTP models where
propulsion velocities are redrawn from a continuous distribution at each
tumbling event rather than restricted to discrete states.

Recent developments in the percolation theory of passivation have shown that
chemical short-range order (SRO) affects the aqueous passivation behavior of
alloys. However, there has been no systematic exploration to quantify these SRO
effects on percolation in practical alloys and the related passivation
behavior. In this study, we quantify the effects of SRO on percolation in a
binary size-mismatched Cu-Rh alloy and study the related passivation behavior.
We develop a mixed-space cluster expansion model trained on the mixing energy
calculated using density functional theory. We use the cluster expansion model
to sample the configuration space via variance-constrained semi-grand canonical
Monte Carlo simulations and develop SRO diagrams over a range of compositions
and temperatures. Building on this with the percolation crossover model,
specifically the variation of percolation threshold with SRO in the FCC
lattice, we construct the first nearest-neighbor chemical percolation diagram.
These diagrams can inform the design of the next generation of

- **TL;DR**: 本文研究了自旋-1/2 XXZ链的能量本征态，发现在各向同性点（Δ=1）时这些态导致扩散常数无限大，自旋输运呈现反常超扩散行为；当各向异性Δ&gt;1时扩散常数有限，自旋输运为正常扩散。通过Jordan-Wigner变换，还研究了相应的一维晶格无自旋费米子模型的电荷输运性质。

Here we consider a class of energy eigenstates of the spin-1/2 XXZ chain that
exist both for anisotropies 1 and larger than 1. We show that at the isotropic
point their contributions are behind the diffusion constant being infinite,
spin transport being anomalous superdiffusive for temperatures T&gt;0. That for
anisotropy larger than 1 such states do not contribute to the diffusion
constant is shown to imply it is finite, spin transport being normal diffusive
for T&gt;0. By combining the connection through a Jordan-Wigner transformation of
the spin-1/2 XXZ chain to the one-dimensional (1D) lattice spinless fermion
model at zero chemical potential for V/J larger or equal to 1 with its
Bethe-ansatz solution, where V is the nearest-neighbor Coulomb repulsion and J
is twice the hopping integrai, in this paper we also address the issue of the
T&gt;0 charge transport of that model at zero chemical potential. It is found to
be anomalous superdiffusive for V/J=1 and normal diffusive for V/J&gt;1.

Via the spin-Hall effect and its inverse, in-plane charge currents in a
normal metal$-$ferromagnet (N$|$F) bilayer can be used to excite and detect
magnetization dynamics in F. Using a magneto-electric circuit approach, we here
consider the current response to quadratic order in the applied electric field,
which is resonantly enhanced for driving frequencies close to frequencies of
coherent magnetization modes. Our theory can be applied to bilayers with a
magnetic insulator or with a magnetic metal. It focuses on the contribution of
coherent magnetization dynamics to spin currents collinear with the equilibrium
magnetization direction, but also takes into account relaxation of spin
accumulation via spin currents carried by incoherent magnons and conduction
electrons in F.

Altermagnetism, a recently discovered collinear magnetic order with net zero
magnetization but exhibits spin-splitting band structure, has attracted much
research interest due to the rich fundamental physics and possible
applications. In this work, we investigate the opto-magnetic response of
$d$-wave altermagnets, focusing on the inverse Cotton-Mouton effect--the
induction of static magnetization via linearly polarized light. We find that
the direction of the induced magnetization is determined by the N\'eel vector.
Moreover, its magnitude exhibits a periodic dependence on the polarization
angle of the incident light, a hallmark of the system's symmetry. Our findings
demonstrate that the inverse Cotton-Mouton effect provides both a method of
manipulating altermagnetic magnetization in altemagnets and a probe of their
intrinsic properties.

### Kitaev-derived Gapless Spin Liquid in the $K$-$J$-$Γ$-$Γ'$ Quantum Magnet Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$

The realization of quantum spin liquids (QSLs) in Kitaev magnets represents
an intriguing topic in frustrated quantum magnetism. Despite prediction in the
pure Kitaev honeycomb model, realization of QSLs in realistic systems and
materials remain scarce. The recent discovery of cobalt-based compound
Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$ has raised significant research interest. By establishing a
realistic $K$-$J$-$\Gamma$-$\Gamma'$ model for Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$ -- with a
dominant antiferromagnetic (AFM) Kitaev interaction ($K&gt;0$) that quantitatively
explains its thermodynamics measurements -- we reveal an intermediate gapless
QSL phase under [111] magnetic fields with tensor-network calculations. We
confirm the QSL nature of this phase by demonstrating its adiabatic connection
to the intensively studied intermediate QSL of the pure AFM Kitaev model under
out-of-plane fields. Our results show excellent agreement with recent
high-field experiments, thereby explaining the intermediate-field phase in
Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$. These findings bridge the gap between theoretical
proposals for a Kitaev-derived QSL and experimental realization, opening new
avenues for exploring exotic quantum states of matter in realistic Kitaev
materials.

### Probing up-conversion electroluminescence of decoupled porphyrin molecules in a plasmonic nanocavity

- **TL;DR**: 研究在STM中观察到PdOEP单分子的可见光范围单重态和三重态发光，证实了三重态作为中继状态的能量上转换机制

Molecular triplet states can produce significant phosphorescence and act as a
relay state for luminescence, such as in up-conversion processes. While this
property makes triplet emitters interesting for organic light-emitting diodes
(OLEDs), the study of their luminescence at the single molecule level in high
resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) is challenging. We investigate
individual Pd-octaethylporphyrin (PdOEP) molecules decoupled from Ag(100) and
Ag(111) by an ultrathin NaCl layer and observe singlet and triplet emission
lines at visible wavelengths, only about 100 nm apart from each other. This is
in stark contrast to the metal or free-base phthalocyanines, for which
typically the lowest triplet transitions lie in the far red or infrared where
the sensitivity of CCD camera decreases significantly. The singlet S1 state of
PdOEP emits photons even when the photon energy is higher than the energy
provided by a tunneling electron, in an energy up-conversion process. This
mechanism requires a relay (or shelving) state in which energy is stored in the
molecule for the interval between tunneling electrons. Analyzing the energy
levels of different molecular states (S1, D0, and T1 states) and fitting the
current dependencies of S1 under up-conversion electroluminescence (UCEL)
condition for S1 and T1 emission, we verify the validity of a triplet-mediated
up-conversion model. We also discuss a preliminary result for coupling with a
neighboring molecule.

### Controlling GaN nucleation via O$_2$-plasma-perforated graphene masks on c-plane sapphire

Atomically thin, perforated graphene on $c$-plane sapphire functions as a
nanoscale mask that enables GaN growth through thru-holes. We tune the
perforated-area fraction $f_p$ by controlled O$_2$-plasma exposure and quantify
its impact on early-stage nucleation: the nucleation-site density scales with
$f_p$, while the nucleation-delay time decreases approximately as $1/f_p$.
Time-resolved areal coverage and domain counts exhibit systematic
$f_p$-dependent trends. A kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) model that coarse-grains
atomistic events -- adatom arrival, surface diffusion, attachment at exposed
sapphire within perforations, and coalescence (the first front-front contact
between laterally growing domains) -- reproduces these trends using a constant
per-site nucleation rate. Fitting the kMC simulation data yields onset times
t$_0$ for the nucleation delay that closely match independently observed
no-growth thresholds (Set 1: 28.5s vs $\sim$30s; Set 2: 38s vs $\sim$35s),
validating the kMC-experiment mapping and highlighting plasma dose as an
activation threshold for plasma-induced through-hole formation in 2D materials.
Together, experiment and kMC identify $f_p$ as a single, surface-engineerable
parameter governing GaN nucleation statistics on perforated graphene masks,
providing a quantitative basis and process window for epitaxial lateral
overgrowth (ELOG)/thru-hole epitaxy (THE) workflows that employ two-dimensional
masks.

Chiral spin textures, such as spin spirals and skyrmions, are key to
advancing spintronics by enabling ultrathin, energy-efficient memory, and
high-density data storage and processing. However, their realization remains
hindered by the scarcity of suitable host materials and the formidable
experimental challenges associated with the characterization of these intricate
chiral magnetic states. Here, we report the observation of tunable chiral
magnetic textures in van der Waals magnet CrPS$_4$ with nonlinear optics. These
tunable textures exhibit strong chiral third-order nonlinear optical responses,
driven by interlayer and intralayer spin couplings under varying magnetic
fields and temperatures. These pronounced chiral nonlinear optical responses
highlight the potency and high sensitivity of the nonlinear optical readout for
probing non-collinear magnetic orders. Moreover, our findings position van der
Waals magnets and their heterostructures as an exceptional platform for
reconfigurable spin-photonics and spintronics, unifying optical, electrical,
and magnetic properties through unique intralayer and interlayer spin coupling
properties and effective spin interaction between photons and electrons.

Pillar-assisted growth is a technique in which short carbon nanotubes (CNTs)
form suspended networks by growing across closely spaced microfabricated
pillars. During growth, the CNT tips exhibit vibrations that allow them to
bridge the neighboring pillars. To improve the complexity and controllability
of the CNT networks, we introduce a kite-growth mechanism in which CNTs are
elongated and aligned by gas flow during growth, enabling a longer bridging
distance compared to vibrational bridging. By integrating theoretical modeling,
simulations, and experimental synthesis, we found that CNT tip vibrations
dominate bridging at short lengths, whereas gas flow increasingly influences
alignment as CNTs grow longer. This results in a crossover behavior governed by
gas flow and pillar arrangement. We also developed a bridging model based on
geometric constraints to quantify the bridging behavior based on pillar spacing
and angular accessibility. The statistical analysis of the resulting network
structures demonstrates that the pillar arrangement significantly influences
the connection types, with kite growth enabling more diverse network
topologies. These findings provide design principles for tuning the density and
structural complexity of suspended CNT networks, offering promising
applications in nanoscale electrical interconnect wiring and three-dimensional
circuit architectures.

- **TL;DR**: 量子异常集际系统中首次实验观测到磁场引起的量子化积累电荷，通过新颖的垂直平面电容检测方法直接探测这种现象

We report the first experimental observation of magnetic-field-induced
quantized charge accumulation in a quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) system -- a
phenomenon originating from the intrinsic two-dimensional surface state and
fundamentally distinct from conventional edge-dependent transport phenomena.
Our approach employs a novel out-of-plane capacitive detection method to
directly probe this charge accumulation, revealing its distinction and
correlation with other surface state properties, such as Laughlin charge
pumping. We demonstrate that the accumulated charge density is governed by the
quantized Hall conductance but is significantly influenced by dissipation
effects due to finite longitudinal conductance. By performing frequency and
longitudinal conductance dependence measurements, the underlying ideal
quantized charge accumulation is extracted, in agreement with theoretical
predictions. Importantly, our out-of-plane method of measuring charge
accumulation allows the detection of small electric polarization in future
studies, establishing a pathway toward the direct observation of the
topological magnetoelectric effect, a manifestation of the four-dimensional
quantum Hall effect.

### Comprehensive Structure Exploration and Thermodynamics of Heteroatom Doped Graphene Superstructures

Graphene has been studied in detail due to its mechanical, electrical, and
thermal properties. It is well documented that the introduction of dopants or
defects in the lattice can be used to tune material properties for a specific
application, such as in electronics, sensors, or catalysis. To design graphene
with specific properties, one must achieve control over the composition and
concentration of defects. This requires a fundamental understanding of the
stability of defects and their interaction in a superstructure. We present a
comprehensive defect structure determination approach that enables close to
exhaustive enumeration of all relevant defect structures. The approach uses a
combination of Density Functional Theory and machine learning to build a
transferable energy model for defect formation. Henceforth, we show the
capabilities of our approach for a proof-of-principle application on
free-standing graphene with heteroatom defects. This allows us to provide
physical insights into defect interactions and to establish a thermodynamic
model to investigate how temperature affects the configuration space of doped
graphene.

### Comparative study of terbium tellurides Tb2Te5 and TbTe3

Two terbium tellurides, TbTe3 and Tb2Te5, were studied by means of
thermodynamics, ultrafast pump-probe spectroscopy and torque magnetometry.
While crystal structure and some physical properties of TbTe3 were established
previously, the crystal structure of Tb2Te5 was solved only in this work in the
orthorhombic space group Cmcm with the parameters of unit cell a = 4.3120(5), b
= 41.0305(76) and c = 4.2979(8) {\AA}. In contrast to TbTe3, which experiences
three successive magnetic phase transitions, Tb2Te5 orders
antiferromagnetically in two steps at TN1 = 9.0 K and TN2 = 6.8 K, both readily
suppressed by an external magnetic field. The third transition in TbTe3 is due
to the interaction of the magnetic subsystem with the charge density waves. The
interaction of magnetic and electronic subsystems in Tb2Te5 has been revealed
by the pump probe. Torque measurements of TbTe3 show that the magnetic moments
of Tb are oriented predominantly in the ac plane at high temperatures and
switch to the b axis at low temperatures. In Tb2Te5, the magnetic moments of Tb
are oriented predominantly in the ac plane at low temperatures.

### Feynman paradox induced by vacuum and thermal fluctuations

- **TL;DR**: 量子版本的Feynman圆盘悖论：非互易粒子在热平衡电磁涨落下，当非互易源移除时开始旋转，展示了真空涨落主导的角动量存储和能量流。

A charged particle initially at rest in an external magnetic field starts to
rotate when the magnetic field is switched off. This is a variant of the
Feynman disc paradox, where the conservation of angular momentum is seemingly
violated. The paradox is understood by realizing that angular momentum is
initially stored in the electromagnetic field and is transferred to the
particle when the magnetic field is removed. In a classical description, no
rotation occurs if the particle is uncharged, as the initial angular momentum
is zero in this case. We show that electromagnetic fluctuations in thermal
equilibrium can induce a quantum analog of the Feynman paradox, where a
nonreciprocal particle without charge starts to rotate when the source of
nonreciprocity is removed. This paradox is due to persistent energy fluxes
arising in nonreciprocal systems at equilibrium, leading to angular momentum
stored in the electromagnetic field. We demonstrate that the contribution of
vacuum fluctuations to persistent energy fluxes dominate over thermal
fluctuations at finite temperature, so vacuum fluctuations dominate the
equilibrium angular momentum as well. Observation of the induced motion would
thus provide a means of detecting persistent energy fluxes and offer further
evidence for the physical reality of vacuum fluctuations.

Magnetic skyrmions with topologically protected properties are anticipated to
shape the future of electronics. Understanding how skyrmions may evolve in
ambient conditions presents a key challenge in the pursuit of technologically
significant materials. In this perspective, we focus on electronic
instabilities and the density of energy of established skyrmion hosts, where a
pathway to a skyrmion phase transition is readily available, to identify
signposts for the emergence of skyrmions. We value the impressive research
efforts in the field that have built the foundation for many more enticing
breakthroughs to come. We share a framework that connects the electronic
origins of skyrmion formation to the temperature and field requirements,
allowing predictions of candidate materials that may host skyrmions at ambient
conditions (the treasure).

The spin Seebeck effect (SSE) enables thermoelectric conversion through
thermally generated spin currents in magnetic materials, offering a promising
transverse geometry for scalable devices. However, conventional SSE devices are
confined to nanoscale thin-film architectures, with significantly restricted
output power due to the intrinsic constraints of spin and magnon diffusion
lengths. Here, we demonstrate a trans-scale SSE using nano-structured bulk
composite materials composed of Pt-coated yttrium iron garnet (YIG) powders
fabricated via dynamic powder sputtering and low-temperature sintering. The
resulting three-dimensional composites exhibit continuous Pt channels and
robust mechanical integrity. The effective electrical conductivity of the
composites is 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than conventional thin-film-based
YIG/Pt devices. Transverse thermoelectric measurements confirm isotropic SSE
signals at the bulk scale. This work establishes a scalable platform for bulk
SSE-based thermoelectrics, bridging nanoscale spin caloritronics with
macroscopic device integration.

- **TL;DR**: 通过时间依赖密度函数理论研究WSe2-石墨烯异质双层在圆偏振光照射下的超快旋波注入，发现旋波转移不是被动过程而是由界面处旋波选择性载流过滤主动驱动的

We report a real-time first-principles study of ultrafast spin injection in a
WSe$_2$-graphene heterobilayer under circularly polarized laser irradiation,
using time-dependent density functional theory. Contrary to conventional
expectations, spin transfer into graphene is not a passive process but is
actively driven by spin-selective carrier filtering at the interface.
Spin-polarized carriers generated in the WSe$_2$ layer induce a preferential
migration of opposite-spin carriers from graphene, which results in net spin
magnetization in graphene. This process is governed by interlayer band offsets,
density-of-state asymmetry, and Pauli blocking. These findings indicate a
microscopic mechanism of spin injection in non-magnetic systems and identify a
guiding principle for the design of ultrafast opto-spintronic functionalities
in van der Waals heterostructures.

Understanding interfacial interactions in two-dimensional (2D)
heterostructures is essential for advancing optoelectronic and quantum
technologies. We investigate metal-organic chemical vapor deposition
(MOCVD)-grown WSe$_2$ films (one to five layers) on graphene/SiC, directly
compared to exfoliated WSe$_2$ on SiO$_2$, using Raman and photoluminescence
(PL) spectroscopy complemented by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Raman
measurements reveal compressive strain and interfacial charge transfer in
WSe$_2$/graphene heterostructures, evidenced by blue-shifted phonon modes and
the emergence of higher-order interlayer breathing modes absent on SiO$_2$.
Concomitant shifts and attenuation of graphene's G and 2D modes with increasing
WSe$_2$ thickness indicate progressive p-type doping of graphene, while WSe$_2$
phonon shifts point to n-type doping of the semiconductor, consistent with
interfacial electron transfer. PL shows strong quenching for monolayer WSe$_2$
on graphene due to ultrafast charge transfer and F"orster resonance energy
transfer (FRET), with partial emission recovery in multilayers relative to
SiO$_2$-supported flakes. Exciton behavior differs strongly between substrates:
on SiO$_2$, A- and B-exciton energies vary markedly with thickness, whereas on
graphene they remain nearly pinned. This stability reflects the combined
effects of graphene's strong dielectric screening and charge-transfer-induced
free-carrier screening, with strain playing a secondary role. These results
establish graphene, unlike SiO$_2$, as an active interfacial partner that
stabilizes excitonic states and enables engineering of the optical response of
2D heterostructures.

- **TL;DR**: Facet是一种高效的等变图神经网络架构，通过使用样条函数替代MLP和创新的球面网格投影方法，显著降低了计算和内存需求，在保持性能的同时实现了10倍以上的训练加速。

Computational materials discovery is limited by the high cost of
first-principles calculations. Machine learning (ML) potentials that predict
energies from crystal structures are promising, but existing methods face
computational bottlenecks. Steerable graph neural networks (GNNs) encode
geometry with spherical harmonics, respecting atomic symmetries -- permutation,
rotation, and translation -- for physically realistic predictions. Yet
maintaining equivariance is difficult: activation functions must be modified,
and each layer must handle multiple data types for different harmonic orders.
We present Facet, a GNN architecture for efficient ML potentials, developed
through systematic analysis of steerable GNNs. Our innovations include
replacing expensive multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) for interatomic distances
with splines, which match performance while cutting computational and memory
demands. We also introduce a general-purpose equivariant layer that mixes node
information via spherical grid projection followed by standard MLPs -- faster
than tensor products and more expressive than linear or gate layers. On the
MPTrj dataset, Facet matches leading models with far fewer parameters and under
10% of their training compute. On a crystal relaxation task, it runs twice as
fast as MACE models. We further show SevenNet-0's parameters can be reduced by

We employ Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations to study atom vibrational
amplitudes in carbon-supported Molybdenum Disulphide (MoS2) nanoparticles.
Enhanced and correlated atom vibrational amplitudes are observed as the
nanoparticle edges are approached from the bulk, consistent with recent
experimental High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HR-TEM)
observations by Chen et al (Nature Communications 12, 5007 (2021). Analysis of
phonon modes in finite systems explains the experimental observation by
low-energy phonon modes confined at the nanoparticle edge, underscoring the
need of full MD modeling for accurate HR-TEM image interpretation. Noticeably,
we introduce a workflow for training Equivariant Neural Network-based machine
learning potentials using limited Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations.
This approach effectively captures both covalent and van der Waals
interactions, enabling accurate extrapolations of DFT calculations to larger
systems with built-in error estimation.

Universal machine learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs) deliver near ab
initio accuracy in energy and force calculations at low computational cost,
making them invaluable for materials modeling. Although uMLIPs are pre-trained
on vast ab initio datasets, rigorous validation remains essential for their
ongoing adoption. In this study, we use the CHGNet uMLIP to model thermal
disorder in isostructural layered 2Hc-WS2 and 2Hc-MoS2, benchmarking it against
ab initio data and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra,
which capture thermal variations in bond lengths and angles. Fine-tuning CHGNet
with compound-specific ab initio (DFT) data mitigates the systematic softening
(i.e., force underestimation) typical of uMLIPs and simultaneously improves
alignment between molecular dynamics-derived and experimental EXAFS spectra.
While fine-tuning with a single DFT structure is viable, using ~100 structures
is recommended to accurately reproduce EXAFS spectra and achieve DFT-level
accuracy. Benchmarking the CHGNet uMLIP against both DFT and experimental EXAFS
data reinforces confidence in its performance and provides guidance for
determining optimal fine-tuning dataset sizes.

Atomistic simulations of heat transport in complex materials are costly and
hard to converge. This has led to the development of several noise reduction
techniques applicable to equilibrium molecular-dynamics simulations. We analyze
the performance of those strategies, taking InAs nanowires as our benchmark due
to the diverse structures and complex phonon spectra of these quasi-1D systems.
We demonstrate how, for low-thermal-conductivity systems, cepstral analysis can
reduce computational demands while still delivering accurate results that do
not require discarding arbitrary parts of the dataset. However, issues with
this approach are revealed when treating high-thermal-conductivity systems,
where the thermal conductivity is significantly underestimated. We discuss
alternative methods to be used in that situation, relying on uncertainty
propagation from independent simulations. We show that the contributions of the
covariance matrix have to be included for a quantitative assessment of the
error. The combination of these strategies with machine-learning interatomic
potentials (MLIPs) provides an accelerated, robust workflow applicable to a
diverse set of systems, as our examples using a highly transferable MACE
potential illustrate.

### Microstructural Control and Heat Transport Enhancement in Lanthanum Sulfate for Thermochemical Heat Storage

Enhancing heat transport within thermochemical heat storage (TCHS) materials
is essential for improving the heat output. A common strategy is combining
salts with highly conductive additives such as carbon or metals. However, such
composites often suffer from drawbacks including interfacial instability and a
reduction of gas permeability. In this work, we propose an alternative approach
based on microstructural orientation control, aiming to create efficient heat
transport pathways without relying on conductive additives. As a model
material, La$_2$(SO$_4$)$_3$ was selected, which undergoes reversible hydration
and dehydration below 250 {\deg}C. Centimeter-scale hexagonal prismatic
La$_2$(SO$_4$)$_3\cdot$9H$_2$O grains were grown from solution and then formed
into plate-shaped specimens either parallel to the longitudinal direction or
transverse to it, and then dehydrated to $\beta$-La$_2$(SO$_4$)$_3$. Laser
flash analysis revealed clear orientation-dependent thermal diffusivity of
pre-dehydrated $\beta$-La$_2$(SO$_4$)$_3$, with values of about 0.24 mm$^2$/s
for the longitudinal plate and about 0.15 mm$^2$/s for the transverse plate at
room temperature. Microstructural observations indicated the formation of
aligned rod-like domains, suggesting that orientation provides an efficient
heat transport pathway. These findings demonstrate that controlling orientation
provides a viable route to enhance heat transport in TCHS materials, offering a
new design approach.

### Intertwined polar, chiral, and ferro-rotational orders in a rotation-only insulator

- **TL;DR**: 本文通过多模态光学方法研究Ni3TeO6中的极性、手性和铁旋转序的相互缠绕关系，揭示了这些序参量如何共同决定畴结构和畴壁性质。

Intertwined orders refer to strongly coupled and mutually dependent orders
that coexist in correlated electron systems, often underpinning key physical
properties of the host materials. Among them, polar, chiral, and
ferro-rotational orders have been theoretically known to form a closed set of
intertwined orders. However, experimental investigation into their mutual
coupling and physical consequences has remained elusive. In this work, we
employ the polar-chiral insulator Ni$_3$TeO$_6$ as a platform and utilize a
multimodal optical approach to directly probe and reveal the intertwining among
polarity, chirality, and ferro-rotational order. We demonstrate how their
coupling governs the formation of domains and dictates the nature of domain
walls. Within the domains, we identify spatial inversion symmetry as the
operation connecting two domain states of opposite polarity and chirality, with
a common ferro-rotational state serving as the prerequisite for these
interlocked configurations. At the domain walls, we observe a pronounced
enhancement of in-plane polarization accompanied by a suppression of chirality.
By combining with Ginzburg-Landau theory within the framework of a pre-existing
ferro-rotational background, we uncover the emergence of mixed N\'eel- and
Bloch-type domain walls. Our findings highlight the critical role of
intertwined orders in defining domain and domain wall characteristics and open
pathways for domain switching and domain wall control via intertwined order
parameters.

We apply a first-principles-based atomistic model to investigate the
BaTi(1-x)Zr(x)O3 phase diagram, focusing on both macroscopic and local
structural changes. Our approach, which combines molecular dynamics with
machine learning techniques, accurately captures the influence of Ti and Zr
cations on their local environment and its evolution with composition and
temperature. The computed phase diagram shows excellent agreement with existing
experimental and theoretical data. Beyond reproducing known results, our
analysis reveals that the behavior of the solid solution across different
compositions and temperatures can be understood in terms of coexisting Ti cells
with different symmetries, whose stability depends on the local B-site
configuration. This local-phase-based approach provides a unified description
of the distinct regions of the solid solution, including ferroelectric,
relaxor, and dipolar glass phases, and captures the continuous evolution from
one regime to another. Our findings demonstrate how atomic-level distortions
drive the complex macroscopic behavior of the material.

Crystal symmetries in solids give rise to spin-momentum locking, which
determines how an electron's spin orientation depends on its momentum. This
relationship, often referred to as spin texture, influences both charge-to-spin
conversion and spin relaxation, making it one of the essential characteristics
for spin-orbit-driven phenomena. Materials with strong spin-orbit coupling and
broken inversion symmetry can host persistent spin textures (PSTs) -
unidirectional spin configurations in momentum space, supporting efficient
charge-to-spin conversion and extended spin lifetimes. Monolayer WTe$_2$, a
topological material crystallizing in a rectangular lattice, is a notable
example; its symmetry enforces a canted PST enabling quantum spin Hall effect
with the nontrivial spin orientation. Here, we use first-principles
calculations to explore how these properties are modified when WTe$_2$ is
interfaced with graphene. We find that the PST is preserved by the local
symmetry present in different regions of the heterostructure, while the system
develops extended electron and hole pockets, resulting in semimetallic
behavior. Although the band gap closes and eliminates the quantum spin Hall
phase, spin Hall effects remain robust in both conventional and unconventional
geometries. The computed spin Hall conductivities are comparable to those of
other two-dimensional materials, and the survival of the PST suggests the
possibility of long-range spin transport even in the absence of topological
edge states. In addition, the graphene layer serves as an oxidation barrier,
helping protect the intrinsic properties of WTe$_2$ and supporting the
potential of this heterostructure for spintronic applications.

Hyperuniform continuous random fields suppress large-scale fluctuations while
preserving rich local disorder, making them highly attractive for
next-generation photonic, thermal and mechanical materials. However,
traditional reconstruction techniques often suffer from limited spectral
control or excessive computational cost, especially in high-resolution 2D and
3D settings. In this work, we present an ultra-efficient generative algorithm
based on generalized superellipse spectral filtering, which allows independent
tuning of isotropic and anisotropic spectral envelopes without resorting to
costly iterative schemes. We demonstrate our method on a comprehensive set of
2D and 3D examples, showing precise manipulation of spectral band shape and
orders-of-magnitude speedup compared to existing approaches. Furthermore, we
explore the effect of simple thresholding on the generated fields, analyzing
the morphological features and power-spectrum characteristics of the resulting
two-phase maps. Our results confirm that the proposed framework not only
accelerates hyperuniform field synthesis but also provides a versatile platform
for systematic study of binary microstructures derived from continuous designs.
This work opens new avenues for large-scale simulation and optimized design of
advanced hyperuniform materials.
