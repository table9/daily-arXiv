Twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ (tMoTe$_2$) is an emergent platform for exploring
exotic quantum phases driven by the interplay between nontrivial band topology
and strong electron correlations. Direct experimental access to its
momentum-resolved electronic structure is essential for uncovering the
microscopic origins of the correlated topological phases therein. Here, we
report angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements of
tMoTe$_2$, revealing pronounced twist-angle-dependent band reconstruction
shaped by orbital character, interlayer coupling, and moir\'e potential
modulation. Density functional theory (DFT) captures the qualitative evolution,
yet underestimates key energy scales across twist angles, highlighting the
importance of electronic correlations. Notably, the hole effective mass at the
K point exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on twist angle, peaking near
2{\deg}, consistent with band flattening at the magic angle predicted by
continuum models. Via electrostatic gating and surface dosing, we further
visualize the evolution of electronic structure versus doping, enabling direct
observation of the conduction band minimum and confirm tMoTe$_2$ as a direct
band gap semiconductor. These results establish a spectroscopic foundation for
modeling and engineering emergent quantum phases in this moir\'e platform.

- **TL;DR**: 滑动作为莫尔系统中普遍存在的现象，对多扭曲莫尔系统的量子几何特性具有独特调控作用，可产生非线性霍尔效应和量子度调控，为分数量子霍尔态研究提供新平台。

Sliding is a ubiquitous phenomenon in moir\'e systems, but its direct
influence on moir\'e bands, especially in multi-twist moir\'e systems, has been
largely overlooked to date. Here, we theoretically show that sliding provides a
unique pathway to engineer the quantum geometry (Berry curvature and quantum
metric) of moir\'e bands, exhibiting distinct advantages over conventional
strategies. Specifically, we first suggest alternating twisted trilayer
$\mathrm{MoTe_2}$ (AT3L-$\mathrm{MoTe_2}$) and chirally twisted triple bilayer
graphene (CT3BLG) as two ideal paradigmatic systems for probing
sliding-engineered quantum geometric phenomena. Then, two sliding-induced
exotic quantum geometry phenomena are predicted: (1) an intrinsic nonlinear
Hall effect via sliding-produced non-zero Berry curvature dipole, with CT3BLG
as an ideal platform; (2) significant quantum metric modulation in
AT3L-$\mathrm{MoTe_2}$, enabling tests of quantum geometric criteria for
fractional Chern insulating state (FCIS). Our work establishes sliding as a new
degree of freedom for manipulating quantum geometry of moir\'e bands, which
emerges as a signature phenomenon of multi-twist moir\'e systems.

- **TL;DR**: 通过μ-ARPES直接测量扭曲双层MoTe2的电子能带结构，发现其具有直接带隙特征，为理解分数量子反常霍尔效应提供了关键实验证据

The pursuit of emergent quantum phenomena lies at the forefront of modern
condensed matter physics. A recent breakthrough in this arena is the discovery
of the fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect (FQAHE) in twisted bilayer
MoTe2 (tbMoTe2), marking a paradigm shift and establishing a versatile platform
for exploring the intricate interplay among topology, magnetism, and electron
correlations. While significant progress has been made through both optical and
electrical transport measurements, direct experimental insights into the
electronic structure - crucial for understanding and modeling this system -
have remained elusive. Here, using spatially and angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy ({\mu}-ARPES), we directly map the electronic band structure of
tbMoTe2. We identify the valence band maximum, whose partial filling underlies
the FQAHE, at the K points, situated approximately 150 meV above the {\Gamma}
valley. By fine-tuning the doping level via in-situ alkali metal deposition, we
also resolve the conduction band minimum at the K point, providing direct
evidence that tbMoTe2 exhibits a direct band gap - distinct from all previously
known moire bilayer transition metal dichalcogenide systems. These results
offer critical insights for theoretical modeling and advance our understanding
of fractionalized excitations and correlated topological phases in this
emergent quantum material.

### Gain-driven magnon-polariton dynamics in the ultrastrong coupling regime: Effective circuit approach for coherence versus nonlinearity

- **TL;DR**: 研究增益驱动磁子子-光子杂交系统在强耦合和超强耦合渡中的自振荡动态。发现自Kerr非线性在强耦合下导致频率偏移，而超强耦合下可实现频率可调的磁子子自振荡动。

We theoretically study the dynamics of gain-driven magnon-polaritons (MPs),
which characterizes auto-oscillation of MPs, across the strong coupling (SC)
and ultrastrong coupling (USC) regimes. Taking into account the magnon dynamics
via the magnetic flux, we present an effective circuit model of gain-driven
MPs, which allows to manipulate the coupling strength of MPs by tuning the size
of a ferromagnet and incorporates the self-Kerr nonlinearity of magnons due to
the shape magnetic anisotropy. In the SC regime, we find that the self-Kerr
nonlinearity generates a frequency shift and reduces the coherent magnon-photon
coupling. In contrast, in the USC regime, we find that the coherent
magnon-photon coupling not only overcomes the self-Kerr nonlinearity but also
effectively couples to gain via the imaginary part of complex eigenfrequencies,
resulting in magnon-like auto-oscillations. Subsequently, the USC enables one
to widely tune the auto-oscillation frequency by means of an external magnetic
field. These findings indicate that there is a trade-off relation between the
coupling strength of MPs and the self-Kerr nonlinearity of magnons. This work
is attributed to understanding of the interplay between gain-loss and USC in
nonlinear polariton dynamics, offering a novel principle for frequency tunable
maser-like devices based on gain-driven MPs.

### Three-dimensional flat bands and possible interlayer triplet pairing superconductivity in the alternating twisted NbSe$_2$ moiré bulk

Moir\'e superlattices hosting flat bands and correlated states have emerged
as a focal topic in condensed matter research. Through first-principles
calculations, we investigate three-dimensional flat bands in alternating
twisted NbSe$_2$ moir\'e bulk structures. These structures exhibit enhanced
interlayer interactions compared to twisted bilayer configurations. Our results
demonstrate that moir\'e bulks undergo spontaneous large-scale structural
relaxation, resulting in the formation of remarkably flat energy bands at twist
angles $\leq$ 7.31{\deg}. The $k_z$-dependent dispersion of flat bands across
different moir\'e bulks reveals their intrinsic three-dimensional character.
The presence of out-of-plane mirror symmetry in these moir\'e bulk structures
suggests possible interlayer triplet superconducting pairing mechanisms that
differ from those in twisted bilayer systems. Our work paves the way for
exploring potential three-dimensional flat bands in other moir\'e bulk systems.

### Ultrafast probing of isotope-induced explciit symmetry breaking in ethylene

- **TL;DR**: 同位素诱导的对称性破缺加速乙烯光异构化过程，13C同位素取代使结构弛豫速度加倍

Symmetry governs nature's law, yet many of the natural phenomena occur due to
the breakdown of symmetry. Here, we show how isotope-induced inversion symmetry
breaking influences ultrafast photoisomerization processes in ethylene. Using
extreme ultraviolet pump-near infrared probe time-of-flight mass spectrometry,
we find that replacing one of the carbon atoms in ethylene with a 13C isotope
leads to twice-faster structural relaxation via ethylene-ethylidene
isomerization in the photo-excited molecular cation. Advanced trajectory
surface hopping calculations incorporating the nuclear symmetry of the
molecular systems, reveal that it arises from the mixing of different normal
modes in the isotope-substituted species, interactions otherwise forbidden by
symmetry. Although the mixing does not alter the symmetry of the electronic
Hamiltonian, it modifies that of the nuclear Hamiltonian, causing explicit
symmetry breaking. This facilitates efficient intra-molecular vibrational
energy redistribution, lowering the isomerization yield. Our findings offer
opportunities to use isotope-induced nuclear symmetry breaking to control the
outcome of light-molecule interactions across ultrafast timescales.

### Demystifying quantum escapism on the honeycomb lattice

- **TL;DR**: 使用最小化增强的自旋波理论研究蜘网格子上量子磁性模型的相图，发现量子波动稳定了多种非常规的凸线性相，且与DMRG计算结果一致。

We demonstrate the versatility, simplicity, and power of the
minimally-augmented spin-wave theory in studying phase diagrams of the quantum
spin models in which unexpected magnetically ordered phases occur or the
existing ones expand beyond their classical stability regions. We use this
method to obtain approximate phase diagrams of the two paradigmatic
spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ models on the honeycomb lattice: the $J_1$-$J_3$
ferro-antiferromagnetic and $J_1$-$J_2$ antiferromagnetic $XXZ$ models. For the
$J_1$-$J_3$ case, various combinations of the $XXZ$ anisotropies are analyzed.
In a dramatic deviation from their classical phase diagrams, which host
significant regions of the noncollinear spiral phases, quantum fluctuations
stabilize several unconventional collinear phases and significantly extend
conventional ones to completely supersede spiral states. These results are in
close agreement with the available density-matrix renormalization group
calculations. The applicability of this approach to the other models and its
potential extension to different types of orders are discussed.

### Activity-driven clustering of jamming run-and-tumble particles: Exact three-body steady state by dynamical symmetry

- **TL;DR**: 本文精确解析了具有阻塞相互作用的run-and-tumble粒子的三粒子稳态，首次提供了超越二体系统的微观描述。

We exactly resolve the three-particle steady state of run-and-tumble
particles with jamming interactions, providing the first microscopic
description beyond two bodies. The invariant measure, derived via a
piecewise-deterministic Markov process description and symmetry principles,
reveals persistent, separated, and diffusive regimes. A cascade of scales in
the activity parameter organizes the structural weights, showing the separated
phase dominates at finite activity, while non-uniformity plays only a minor
role. This approach lays the groundwork for tackling the $N$-body problem.

### A Phase-Field Approach to Fracture and Fatigue Analysis: Bridging Theory and Simulation

- **TL;DR**: 一种结合线性弹性断裂力学和相场断裂理论的疲劳裂纹传播框架，通过单次模拟和Paris定律预测疲劳寿命，简化参数化过程

This article presents a novel, robust and efficient framework for fatigue
crack-propagation that combines the principles of Linear Elastic Fracture
Mechanics (LEFM) with phase-field fracture (PFF). Contrary to cycle-by-cycle
PFF approaches, this work relies on a single simulation and uses standard crack
propagation models such as Paris' law for the material response, simplifying
its parametrization.
  The core of the methodology is the numerical evaluation of the derivative of
a specimen's compliance with respect to the crack area. To retrieve this
compliance the framework relies on a PFF-FEM simulation, controlled imposing a
monotonic crack growth. This control of the loading process is done by a new
crack-control scheme which allows to robustly trace the complete equilibrium
path of a crack, capturing complex instabilities. The specimen's compliance
obtained from the PFF simulation enables the integration of Paris' law to
predict fatigue life.
  The proposed methodology is first validated through a series of benchmarks
with analytical solutions to demonstrate its accuracy. The framework is then
applied to more complex geometries where the crack path is unknown, showing a
very good agreement with experimental results of both crack paths and fatigue
life.

Hydrodynamics And Radiation Diffusion} (HARD) is an open-source application
for high-performance simulations of compressible hydrodynamics with
radiation-diffusion coupling. Built on the FleCSI (Flexible Computational
Science Infrastructure) framework, HARD expresses its computational units as
tasks whose execution can be orchestrated by multiple back-end runtimes,

research across multiple domains.

### Bilateral Hydrogenation Realizes High-Temperature Quantum Anomalous Hall Insulator in 2D Cr$_{\text{2}}$Ge$_{\text{2}}$Te$_{\text{6}}$

- **TL;DR**: 通过双侧氢化技术在Cr2Ge2Te6中实现了高温完整的量子异常降大负导体，拥有118.1 meV的拓扑空隙和198 K的高底尔温度

The pursuit of high-temperature quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulators faces
fundamental challenges, including narrow topological gaps and low Curie
temperatures ($T_{\text{C}}$) in existing materials. Here, we propose a
transformative strategy using bilateral hydrogenation to engineer a robust QAH
state in the topologically trivial ferromagnetic semiconductor
Cr$_{\text{2}}$Ge$_{\text{2}}$Te$_{\text{6}}$. First-principles calculations
reveal that hydrogenation induces a topological phase transition in
Cr$_{\text{2}}$Ge$_{\text{2}}$Te$_{\text{6}}$ by shifting its Dirac
points-originally embedded in the conduction bands-to the vicinity of the Fermi
level in Cr$_{\text{2}}$Ge$_{\text{2}}$Te$_{\text{6}}$H$_{\text{6}}$. This
electronic restructuring, coupled with spin-orbit coupling, opens a global
topological gap of 118.1 meV, establishing a robust QAH state with Chern number
$C=$ 3. Concurrently, hydrogenation enhances ferromagnetic superexchange via
the $d_{z^{2}}$-$p_{z}$-$d_{xz}$ channel, significantly strengthening the
nearest-neighbor coupling $J_{\text{1}}$ by 3.06 times and switching
$J_{\text{2}}$ from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic. Monte Carlo simulations
predict a high $T_{\text{C}}$ = 198 K, sustained well above liquid nitrogen
temperature and far exceeding pristine
Cr$_{\text{2}}$Ge$_{\text{2}}$Te$_{\text{6}}$ (28 K). This work establishes
surface hydrogenation as a powerful route to simultaneously control topology
and magnetism in 2D materials, unlocking high-temperature QAH platforms for
dissipationless spintronic applications.

### Superconductivity in hyperbolic spaces: Regular hyperbolic lattices and Ginzburg-Landau theory

- **TL;DR**: 本文研究了双曲空间中的s波超导性，发现双曲几何通过增强边界效应显著改变了超导特性，边界可以增强超导性甚至产生仅边界超导态，粗糙边界能大幅提高临界温度。

We study $s$-wave superconductivity in hyperbolic spaces using the
Bogoliubov-de Gennes theory for discrete hyperbolic lattices and the
Ginzburg-Landau theory for the continuous hyperbolic plane. Hyperbolic lattices
maintain a finite fraction of boundary sites regardless of system size, thus
fundamentally altering superconductivity through enhanced boundary effects
absent in flat space. Within the BCS framework for hyperbolic lattices, uniform
systems reproduce standard bulk behavior, whereas finite systems with open
boundaries, studied through exact diagonalization and Cayley-tree
approximations, exhibit boundary-enhanced superconductivity and boundary-only
superconducting states that persist above the bulk critical temperature.
Numerical studies further reveal that boundary termination critically
determines superconducting properties; in particular, rough boundaries with
dangling bonds generate zero-energy modes that raise critical temperatures by
several times relative to smooth boundaries. Turning to the complementary
Ginzburg-Landau analysis of the hyperbolic plane, we find that finite
geometries permit radial variations of the condensate absent in infinite space.
Owing to the interplay between coherence length and curvature radius, the
theory exhibits two types of superconductivity even without magnetic fields,
with vortices replaced by lines of vanishing order parameter in the nontrivial
type. Our findings establish hyperbolic geometry as a platform for engineering
boundary-controlled superconductivity, opening new directions for physics in
curved spaces in condensed matter and holography.

### Automated selection of nuclear coordinates for reduced dimensionality nonadiabatic dynamics

Poor scaling of dynamics simulations with number of dimensions is currently a
major limiting factor in the simulation of photochemical processes. In this
work, we investigate ways to reduce the dimensionality of many-atom systems
with a view toward enhancing computational efficiency while maintaining
accuracy. Using mixed quantum-classical Trajectory Surface Hopping (TSH)
simulations of three photoreactive molecules - trans-azomethane (tAZM),
butyrolactone (Bulac), and furanone (Fur) - we explore two different
dimensionality reduction techniques: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and
Normal Mode Variance (NMV). Dynamics simulations are run in full dimensionality
and reduced dimensionality, employing either PCA or NMV, and the impact of the
dimensionality reduction on selected electronic and geometric properties of the
dynamics is evaluated. For all three molecules, both PCA and NMV can be used to
select lower-dimensional spaces in which the full-dimensionality dynamics
results are reproduced. PCA reduction outperforms NMV in all systems, allowing
for a more significant dimensionality reduction without loss of accuracy. The
improved accuracy of PCA is, for tAZM, mostly seen in the electronic properties
while for both Fur and Bulac the advantage is clear in the ring-opening
reaction itself as well. The present approach opens routes to simulation of
larger photochemically relevant systems, through the use of automated
dimensionality reduction, avoiding human bias.

### Emanant and emergent symmetry-topological-order from low-energy spectrum

- **TL;DR**: 通过分析1+1D系统在闭合边界条件下的低能谱，计算对应的对称性拓扑排列(symTO)，并发现反铁磁波茫模型具有D8量子双重对称性和出现的SO(4)对称性。

Low-energy emergent and emanant symmetries can be anomalous, higher-group, or
non-invertible. Such symmetries are systematically captured by topological
orders in one higher dimension, known as symmetry topological orders (symTOs).
Consequently, identifying the emergent or emanant symmetry of a system is not
simply a matter of determining its group structure, but rather of computing the
corresponding symTO. In this work, we develop a method to compute the symTO of
1+1D systems by analyzing their low-energy spectra under closed boundary
conditions with all possible symmetry twists. Applying this approach, we show
that the gapless antiferromagnetic (AF) spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg model
possesses an exact emanant symTO corresponding to the $D_8$ quantum double,
when restricted to the $\mathbb{Z}_2^x \times \mathbb{Z}_2^z$ subgroup of the
$SO(3)$ spin-rotation symmetry and lattice translations. Moreover, the AF phase
exhibits an emergent $SO(4)$ symmetry, whose exact components are described
jointly by the symTO and the $SO(3)$ spin-rotations. Using condensable algebras
in symTO, we further identify several neighboring phases accessible by
modifying interactions among low-energy excitations: (1) a gapped dimer phase,
connected to the AF phase via an $SO(4)$ rotation, (2) a commensurate collinear
ferromagnetic phase that breaks translation by one site with a $\omega \sim
k^2$ mode, (3) an incommensurate, translation-symmetric ferromagnetic phase
featuring both $\omega \sim k^2$ and $\omega \sim k$ modes, connected to the
previous phase by an $SO(4)$ rotation, and (4) an incommensurate ferromagnetic
phase that breaks translation by one site with both $\omega \sim k^2$ and
$\omega \sim k$ modes.

### A Unified Nonequilibrium Framework: Thermodynamic Distance, Dissipation, and Stationary Laws via Effective State Count, Variational Stationarity, and Thermodynamic Bounds

- **Categories**: cond-mat.stat-mech
- **TL;DR**: 提出了一个非平衡热力学的变分框架，基于有效可及状态数的概念，建立了热力学距离、熵产生分解和涨落对称性等理论体系

We propose a variational framework for nonequilibrium thermodynamics built
around the effective number of accessible state, a multiplicative count that
ranges from for a uniform distribution to one under complete localization, and
whose logarithm coincides with the Gibbs Shannon entropy. This gives a natural
thermodynamic distance to equipartition that bounds statistical
distinguishability and grows monotonically under doubly stochastic relaxation.
The construction extends to arbitrary nonequilibrium steady states with a
chosen reference distribution, where the Kullback Leibler divergence splits
into an entropy deficit and a reference weight coupling, acts as a Lyapunov
functional when the reference is fixed, and reduces to excess free energy in
canonical settings. We connect these static notions to dynamics by decomposing
entropy production into adiabatic (housekeeping) and nonadiabatic parts,
identify the latter with the rate of decay of the divergence to the reference,
and complement this with trajectory and activity-based potentials that yield
fluctuation symmetries, thermodynamic uncertainty bounds, and activity-limited
speed constraints on steady currents

Despite the rapid rise in perovskite solar cell efficiency, poor
reproducibility remains a major barrier to commercialization. Film
crystallization and device performance are highly sensitive to environmental
factors during fabrication, yet their complex interactions are not well
understood. In this work, we present a systematic framework to investigate the
influence of both individual and coupled environmental variables on device
efficiency and crystallization kinetics. We developed an integrated fabrication
platform with precise, independent control over ambient solvent partial
pressure, absolute humidity, and temperature during spin-coating and
thermal-annealing processes, respectively. Using the platform, we implemented a
closed-loop Bayesian optimization framework to efficiently explore the
multi-dimensional processing space. We mapped the impact of these environmental
variables on device performance and identified coupled effects among them.
In-situ grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering measurements further
validated these findings by revealing a nonlinear interaction between absolute
humidity and solvent partial pressure during spin-coating, which affects
crystallization dynamics. To isolate and quantify these interactions, we
developed an interpretable machine learning approach that combines knowledge
distillation with Shapley interaction analysis. The model revealed the
contribution of each interaction varies across different processing conditions.
Our study highlights the importance of integrated ambient sensing and control
to achieve repeatable perovskite solar cells, and demonstrates the utility of

Astronauts participating in deep-space exploration missions will be exposed
to significantly greater amounts of radiation than is typically encountered on
Earth or in low Earth orbit (LEO), which poses significant risks to crew health
and mission safety. Active magnetic radiation shields based on the Lorentz
deflection of charged particles have the potential to reduce astronaut doses
with lower mass costs than passive shielding techniques. Typically, active
shielding performance is evaluated using high-fidelity Monte Carlo simulations,
which are too computationally expensive to evaluate an entire trade space of
shield designs. A rapid, semi-analytical model based on the High Charge and
Energy Transport code (HZETRN) developed in 2014 provided an alternative method
by which to evaluate the performance of solenoidal shields. However, various
simplifying assumptions made in the original model have limited its accuracy,
and therefore require evaluation and correction. In this work, a number of
aspects of the original semi-analytical model are updated and validated by
Monte Carlo simulation, then used to recharacterize the design trade space of
solenoidal magnetic shields. The updated model predicts improved performance
for weaker shields as compared to the original model, but greatly diminished
performance for strong shields with bending powers greater than 20 T-m.
Overall, the results indicate that magnetic shields enable significant mass
savings over passive shields for mission scenarios where the requisite dose
reduction is greater than about 60% relative to free space, which includes most
exploration missions longer than one year with significant time spent outside
LEO.

Soliton-based computing architectures have recently emerged as a promising
avenue to overcome fundamental limitations of conventional information
technologies, the von Neumann bottleneck. In this context, magnetic skyrmions
have been widely considered for in-situ processing devices due to their
mobility and enhanced lifetime in materials with broken inversion symmetry.
However, modern applications in non-volatile reservoir or neuromorphic
computing raise the additional demand for non-linear inter-soliton
interactions. Here we report that solitons in easy-plane magnets, such as
bimerons and antibimerons, show greater versatility and potential for
non-linear interactions than skyrmions and antiskyrmions, making them superior
candidates for this class of applications. Using first-principles and
transition state theory, we predict the coexistence of degenerate bimerons and
antibimerons at zero field in a van der Waals heterostructure
Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$/Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ -- an experimentally feasible system. We
demonstrate that, owing to their distinct structural symmetry, bimerons exhibit
fundamentally different behavior from skyrmions and cannot be regarded as their
in-plane counterparts, as is often assumed. This distinction leads to unique
properties of bimerons and antibimerons, which arise from the unbroken
rotational symmetry in easy-plane magnets. These range from anisotropic
soliton-soliton interactions to strong entropic effects on their lifetime,
driven by the non-local nature of thermal excitations. Our findings reveal a
broader richness of solitons in easy-plane magnets and underline their unique
potential for spintronic devices.

Topological superconductors are one of the intriguing material groups from
the viewpoint of not only condensed matter physics but also industrial
application such as quantum computers based on Majorana fermion. For the real
application, developments of the thin-film topological superconductors are
highly desirable. Bi/Ni bilayer is a possible candidate for thin-film chiral
superconductors where the time-reversal symmetry is broken. Here we report the
phase shift of resistance oscillations by half flux quantum in a ring-shaped
device of epitaxial Bi/Ni bilayer induced by a small magnetic field through the
ring. The half quantum fluxoid can be a decisive evidence for unconventional
superconductors where the superconducting order parameter has an internal
degree of freedom. The present result provides a functional operating principle
for quantum devices where the phase of the supercurrent can be shifted by \pi
with a small magnetic field, based on the internal degree of freedom possessed
by topological superconductivity.

- **TL;DR**: 超短阿秒脉冲激发分子电子态相干叠加产生电荷迁移，虽然电子相干性寿命极短（&lt;1 fs），但能诱导持续50 fs以上的振动相干性，影响核运动。

Short-in-time, broad-in-energy attosecond or few-femtosecond pulses can
excite coherent superpositions of several electronic states in molecules. This
results in ultrafast charge oscillations known as charge migration. A key open
question in the emerging field of attochemistry is whether these electron
dynamics, which due to decoherence often last only for a few femtoseconds, can
influence longer-time scale nuclear rearrangements. Herein, we address this
question through full-dimensional quantum dynamics simulations of the coupled
electron-nuclear dynamics initiated by ionization and coherent excitation of
ethylene. The simulations of this prototype organic chromophore predict
electronic coherences with half-lives of less than 1 fs. Despite their brevity,
these electronic coherences induce vibrational coherences along the derivative
coupling vectors that persist for at least 50 fs. These results suggest that
short-lived electronic coherences can impart long-lasting legacies on nuclear
motion, a finding of potential importance to the interpretation of attosecond
experiments and the development of strategies for attochemical control.

### Noise-Activated Dopant Dynamics in Two-Dimensional Thermal Landscapes with Localized Cold Spots

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一个二维理论框架，通过各向异性四次限制和局部热冷点来控制掺杂剂传输，实现了噪声诱导的单稳态-双稳态转变和可调谐的噪声激活跳跃。

Controlling dopant transport with high spatial precision is crucial for
improving the semiconductor functionality, reliability, and scalability.
Although prior models of noise-assisted diffusion have been largely confined to
idealized one dimensional settings, we present a physically realistic
two-dimensional theoretical framework that integrates anisotropic quartic
confinement with localized thermal cold spots to direct impurity dynamics.
Using a generalized Fokker Planck formalism, we show that the geometry of the
thermal landscape, particularly the width and arrangement of cold spots,
governs a noise induced transition between monostable and bistable effective
potentials. This enables tunable noise activated hopping and supports
conditions favorable for stochastic resonance (SR) if weak periodic driving is
applied. Quantitative predictions are made for how impurity localization and
effective barrier heights depend on the cold spot width and trap depth ,
offering experimentally testable signatures. We propose an experimental
realization using optothermal techniques, such as dual beam optical tweezers
and laser cooling, which can sculpt reconfigurable thermal profiles with sub
micron resolution. This model establishes a versatile pathway for programmable
impurity manipulation and noise sensitive control in semiconductor structures,
bridging theoretical predictions with feasible experimental detection via
photoluminescence mapping or lock in signal amplification.

### Dichotomy in Low- and High-energy Band Renormalizations in Trilayer Nickelate $La_{4}Ni_{3}O_{10}$: a Comparison with Cuprates

Band renormalizations comprise crucial insights for understanding the
intricate roles of electron-boson coupling and electron correlation in emergent
phenomena such as superconductivity. In this study, by combining
high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and theoretical
calculations, we systematically investigate the electronic structure of the
trilayer nickelate superconductor $La_{4}Ni_{3}O_{10}$ at ambient pressure. We
reveal a dichotomy in the electronic band renormalizations of
$La_{4}Ni_{3}O_{10}$ in comparison to cuprate superconductors. At a high energy
scale of hundreds of meV, its band structure is strongly renormalized by
electron correlation effect enhanced by Hund coupling. The resultant
waterfall-like dispersions resemble the high-energy kinks in cuprate
superconductors. However, at low energy scales of tens of meV, the dispersive
bands are nearly featureless and devoid of any resolvable electron-boson
interactions, in drastic contrast to the low-energy kinks observed in cuprates
and other correlated 3d transition-metal compounds. The dichotomic band
renormalizations highlight the disparity between nickelate and cuprate
superconductors and emphasize the importance of strong electron-correlation in
the superconductivity of Ruddlesden-Popper phase nickelates.

Indium selenide (In2Se3), a ferroelectric semiconductor, offers a unique
platform for multifunctional nanoelectronics owing to the interplay between
polarization dynamics, interlayer sliding, and structural polymorphism.
Ferroelectric semiconductor field-effect transistors (FeS-FETs) provide an
ideal architecture to harness this coupling. Here, we demonstrate gate-tunable
negative differential resistance (NDR) with high peak-to-valley ratios and
hysteretic output conductance in In2Se3 FeS-FETs. Combining high-resolution
electron microscopy with electrical transport measurements, we attribute the
NDR to a field-induced, volatile phase transition from a low-resistance
alpha-2H phase to a high-resistance state. Atomic scale ex-situ imaging reveals
that in-plane electric fields (Vd) drive interlayer sliding, rotational
misalignments that generate Moire patterns, and intralayer shear-together
producing stress induced phase transitions. Out-of-plane field however results
in robust non-volatile polarization switching. These mechanistic insights
highlight both the promise of two dimensional ferroelectric devices for
multifunctional nanoelectronics and alternative computing paradigms, and the
intrinsic limitations of In2Se3 field-effect transistors for conventional
ferroelectric memory applications.

Based on the molecular Berry curvature (MBC) framework, we develop an
\textit{ab initio} algorithm to capture the quantitative effects of magnetic
order on lattice dynamics. Using the ferromagnetic Weyl semimetal
Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ as a prototype, we show that electronic-order-driven phonon
symmetry breaking requires spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and leads to an MBC term
that breaks both time-reversal ($\mathcal{T}$) and mirror symmetries. We
demonstrate that mirror-symmetry breaking is essential to account for the
experimentally observed phonon splitting, $\mathcal{T}$-breaking alone is
insufficient. The MBC is widely distributed across the Brillouin zone, giving
rise to significant off-$\Gamma$ effects. Our results agree well with
experiments and establish a framework for predicting large phonon magnetism in
magnetic materials with strong spin-orbit coupling and electron-phonon
coupling. This work also suggests new avenues for controlling non-reciprocal
phonon transport.

Recent experiments on twisted double bilayer tungsten diselenide have
demonstrated that moir\'e semiconductors can be used to realize a relativistic
Mott transition, i.e., a quantum phase transition from a Dirac semimetal to a
correlated insulating state, by twist-angle tuning. In addition, signatures of
van Hove singularities were observed in the material's moir\'e valence bands,
suggesting further potential for the emergence of strongly-correlated states in
this moir\'e semiconductor. Based on a Bistritzer-MacDonald-type continuum
model, we provide a detailed analysis of the twist-angle dependence of the
system's moir\'e valence band structure, focusing on both, the evolution of the
Dirac excitations and the Fermi-surface structure with its Lifshitz transitions
across the van Hove fillings. We exhibit that the twist angle can be used to
band engineer a high-order van Hove singularity with power-law exponent~$-1/4$
in the density of states, which can be accessed by gate tuning of the hole
filling. We then study the magnetic phase diagram of an effective Hubbard model
for twisted double bilayer tungsten diselenide on the effective moir\'e
honeycomb superlattice with tight-binding parameters fitted to the two topmost
bands of the continuum model. To that end, we employ a self-consistent
Hartree-Fock mean-field approach in real space. Fixing the angle-dependent
Hubbard interaction based on the experimental findings, we explore a broad
parameter range of twist angle, filling, and temperature. We find a rich
variety of magnetic states that we expect to be accessible in future
experiments by twist or gate tuning, including, e.g., a non-coplanar
spin-density wave with non-zero spin chirality and a half-metallic uniaxial
spin-density wave.

High temperature superconductivity has been found in Fe, Ni, and Cu
compounds, but not Co, where the Ni compounds include the recently found

predict several Co-based La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$-like high-temperature
superconducting materials. With electron doping to high-pressure bilayer
cobaltate La$_3$Co$_2$O$_7$, we find that LaTh$_2$Co$_2$O$_7$,
La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$, and La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Br$_2$ may show similar crystal
structures and strongly correlated electronic structures to bilayer nickelate
La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressure. Within the random-phase approximation
(RPA), the leading pairing symmetry in these materials is $s$-wave.

Electrochemical energy and substance conversion devices involve complex
electrode processes, characterized by multiple charge transfer steps, competing
pathways, and various intermediates. Such complexity makes it challenging to
enhance electrocatalytic activity. The prevailing strategy typically focuses on
optimizing the geometric and electronic structures of the electrocatalysts to
align the adsorption energies of reaction intermediates with the peak of the
activity Volcano curve. In this study, we demonstrate that surface decoration
can effectively shape the micro reaction environment for the model system of
oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on Pt electrodes. By applying a partial
hydrophobic I* adlayer on the Pt surface, we can shift the equilibrium of OH*
reduction and weaken H2O* adsorption, which significantly enhances ORR
kinetics. With in situ scan tunneling microscopy (STM) and theoretical
calculations, our study reveals the formation of isolated Pt2 surface units
situated in a hydrophobic valley surrounded by adsorbed iodine atoms. This
minimalist Pt2 active unit exhibits significantly greater activity for ORR
compared to an extended Pt surface. This strategy could pave the way for
developing highly efficient catalysts with potential applications in fuel cell
technology and metal air batteries and extension to other electrochemical
conversion reactions such as ammonia synthesis and CO2 reduction.

The equilibrium behaviours of a trilayered 6-state clock model has been
investigated by Monte Carlo simulation. The intralayer interaction is
considered ferromagnetic, whereas the interlayer interaction is
antiferromagnetic. Open boundary conditions are applied in all directions. The
thermodynamic behaviours of sublattice magnetisation, total magnetisation,
magnetic susceptibility and the specific heat are studied as functions of the
temperature. The interesting compensation phenomenon, i.e., the vanishing of
the total magnetisation even with nonvanishing sublattice magnetisation, has
been observed. The compensation temperature and the critical temperature are
found to depend on the strength of single-site anisotropy. The comprehensive
phase diagram is shown in the temperature-anisotropy plane. The finite size
analysis has been done through the temperature dependence of fourth order
Binder cumulant, and the scaling exponents are estimated.

- **TL;DR**: Error

We present the realization of a spin-1/2 hexagonal-plaquette chain with Ising
anisotropy, an unexplored quantum spin model that serves as a platform for
investigating anisotropic quantum magnetism. Specific heat at zero field
reveals a sharp peak at $T_{\rm{N}}$ = 1.0 K, indicating a phase transition to
a N$\acute{\rm{e}}$el order stabilized by interchain couplings. A perturbative
analysis maps the system onto an effective spin-1/2 Ising-like chain,
supporting the presence of an anisotropy-induced excitation gap. Furthermore,
the interchain interactions may induce discrete excitations in the spinon
continuum, reminiscent of Zeeman ladder physics observed in related 1D
Ising-like systems. These results establish a well-defined model system for
correlated spin phenomena in anisotropic magnets and highlight a route for
engineering Ising-like quantum states in molecular-based frameworks.

2D van der Waals ferromagnets hold immense promise for spintronic
applications due to their controllability and versatility. Despite their
significance, the realization and in-depth characterization of ferromagnetic
materials in atomically thin single layers, close to the true 2D limit, has
been scarce. Here, a successful synthesis of monolayer (ML) 1T-CrTe2 is
reported on a bilayer graphene (BLG) substrate via molecular beam epitaxy.
Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and magneto-optical Kerr effect
measurements, that the ferromagnetic transition is observed at the Curie
temperature (TC) of 150 K in ML 1T-CrTe2 on BLG, accompanied by unconventional
temperature-dependent band evolutions. The spectroscopic analysis and
first-principle calculations reveal that the ferromagnetism may arise from
Goodenough-Kanamori super-exchange and double-exchange interactions, enhanced
by the lattice distortion and the electron doping from the BLG substrate. These
findings provide pivotal insight into the fundamental understanding of
mechanisms governing 2D ferromagnetism and offer a pathway for engineering
higher TC in 2D materials for future spintronic devices.

Strongly correlated materials, such as twisted transition-metal
dichalcogenide homobilayers, host a variety of exotic quantum phases but remain
notoriously difficult to solve due to strong interactions. We introduce a
powerful neural network ansatz, Neural Transformer Backflow (NTB), formulated
within a multi-band projection framework. It naturally enforces momentum
conservation and enables efficient calculations of momentum-resolved ground
states. NTB attains high accuracy on small systems and scales to higher bands
and larger system sizes far beyond the reach of exact diagonalization. By
evaluating observables such as the structure factor and momentum distribution,
we show that NTB captures diverse correlated states in tMoTe$_2$, including
charge density waves, fractional Chern insulators, and anomalous Hall Fermi
liquids, within a unified framework. Our approach paves the way for
understanding and discovering novel phases of matter in strongly correlated
materials.

The combination of solid state single-photon emitters and mechanical
excitations into hybrid infrastructures is a promising approach for new
developments in quantum technology. Here we investigate theoretically the
resonance fluorescence (RF) spectrum of an acoustically modulated single-photon
emitter under arbitrarily strong optical driving. In the spectrum, the
combination of Mollow triplet physics and phonon sidebands results in a complex
structure of crossings, anti-crossings, and line suppressions. We apply Floquet
theory to develop an analytical expression for the RF spectrum. Complemented
with perturbative and non-perturbative techniques, this allows us to fully
understand the underlying acousto-optical double dressing physics of the hybrid
quantum system, explaining the observed spectral features. We use these
insights to perform an experimental feasibility study of existing emitter-based
acousto-optical platforms and come to the conclusion that bulk acoustic waves
interfaced with quantum dots render a promising infrastructure to perform
acousto-optical Floquet engineering.

relaxation for four isotopologues of ice and water, including the 1-10^5 Hz
region, in which only sporadic and inconsistent measurements were previously
available. In ice, the relaxation rates exhibit an activated temperature
dependence with an isotope-independent activation energy. Across 248-273 K, the
H_2O/D_2O relaxation rate ratio remains constant at 2.0 \pm 0.1. This scaling
agrees with Kramers' theory in the high-friction limit if the moving mass is
the proton or deuteron, indicating that dielectric relaxation is governed by a
classic proton transfer over an energy barrier rather than molecular
reorientation.

- **TL;DR**: 本文精确求解了两个离散随机游走者在非对称通道中的非平衡动力学，揭示了位置交换机制下的两个动力学交叉和持续空间各向异性现象。

We solve exactly the non-equilibrium dynamics of two discrete random walkers
moving in channels with transition rates $p \neq q$ that swap positions at a
rate $s$. We compute exactly the joint probability distribution $P_{n,m}(t)$
for the walkers, revealing the existence of two dynamical crossovers. The first
signals the passage from independent diffusion to a swap-dominated regime where
the particles act as identical random walkers swapping positions. The second
crossover occurs when both channels become indistinguishable and the walkers
move around the same position. Furthermore, we demonstrate the existence of a
persistent spatial anisotropy defined by the difference between the second
moments of the probability distributions in the two channels. Our results may
provide a quantitative framework to understand diverse systems. In biology, it
is motivated by motor proteins (kinesin/dynein) exchanging cargo leadership,
membrane receptors swapping binding partners, or brain synapses with
activity-dependent plasticity. In finance, it models traders with distinct risk
profiles swapping positions in limit-order books, or volatility spillover
between coupled markets. These diverse systems share a unifying theme: exchange
processes mediate macroscopic correlations despite individual heterogeneity.

Infinite-layer nickelate superconductors are typically synthesized as thin
films and thus include, besides the more bulk-like inner layers, distinct
surface and interface layers in contact with the vacuum and substrate,
respectively. Here, we employ density-functional theory and dynamical
mean-field theory to investigate how electronic correlations influence these
surface and interface regions. Our results show that electronic correlations
can significantly modify the electronic structure, even driving surface layers
into a Mott-insulating state with a 3$d^8$ electronic configuration. Moreover,
surface termination effects induce a polar field that can shift the $\Gamma$
and $A$ pocket above the Fermi level, even for the undoped parent compound
NdNiO$_2$. Finally, for an $n$-type interface, often synthesized
experimentally, we find the Ti 3$d$ orbitals to become electron doped.

Magnetic materials often exhibit complex energy landscapes with multiple
local minima, each corresponding to a self-consistent electronic structure
solution. Finding the global minimum is challenging, and heuristic methods are
not always guaranteed to succeed. Here, we apply a recently developed automated
workflow to systematically explore the energy landscape of 194 magnetic
monolayers obtained from the Materials Cloud 2D crystals database and determine
their ground-state magnetic order. Our approach enables effective control and
sampling of orbital occupation matrices, allowing rapid identification of local
minima. We find a diverse set of self-consistent collinear metastable states,
further enriched by Hubbard-corrected energy functionals, when the $U$
parameters have been computed from first principles using linear-response
theory. We categorise the monolayers by their magnetic ordering and highlight
promising candidates. Our results include 109 ferromagnetic, 83
antiferromagnetic, and 2 altermagnetic monolayers, along with 12 novel
ferromagnetic half-metals with potential for spintronics technologies.

In this work, making use of time-resolved in situ Joule heating of a
two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in the Corbino geometry, we report bulk
thermal conductance measurements for the {\nu} = 5/2 and {\nu} = 7/3 fractional
quantum Hall (FQH) states for electron temperatures ranging from 20 to 150 mK.
We compare our findings with a recent study by Melcer et al. [Nature 625, 489
(2024)] that observed a finite bulk thermal conductivity \k{appa}xx in FQH
states. In spite of the large size difference and the vastly different
experimental schemes used to extract \k{appa}xx, we find in large part that
both experiments yield similar results and conclude that the bulk of FQH states
thermally conducts and violate the Wiedemann-Franz law by a wide margin. Slight
discrepancies between both studies are further discussed in terms of
particle-hole symmetry in the vicinity of the 5/2 and 7/3 FQH states.

### Strong-to-Weak Symmetry Breaking Phases in Steady States of Quantum Operations

Mixed states can exhibit two distinct kinds of symmetries, either on the
level of the individual states (strong symmetry), or only on the level of the
ensemble (weak symmetry). Strong symmetries can be spontaneously broken down to
weak ones, a mechanism referred to as Strong-to-Weak Spontaneous Symmetry
Breaking (SW-SSB). In this work, we first show that maximally mixed symmetric
density matrices, which appear, for example, as steady states of symmetric
random quantum circuits have SW-SSB when the symmetry is an on-site
representation of a compact Lie or finite group. We then show that this can be
regarded as an isolated point within an entire SW-SSB phase that is stable to
more general quantum operations such as measurements followed by weak
postselection. With sufficiently strong postselection, a second-order
transition can be driven to a phase where the steady state is strongly
symmetric. We provide analytical and numerical results for such SW-SSB phases
and their transitions for both abelian $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and non-abelian $S_3$
symmetries in the steady state of Brownian random quantum circuits with
measurements. We also show that such continuous SW-SSB transitions are absent
in the steady-state of general strongly symmetric, trace-preserving quantum
channels (including unital, Brownian, or Lindbladian dynamics) by analyzing the
degeneracies of the steady states in the presence of symmetries. Our results
demonstrate robust SW-SSB phases and their transitions in the steady states of
noisy quantum operations, and provide a framework for realizing various kinds
of mixed-state quantum phases based on their symmetries.

- **TL;DR**: 研究Ce2Hf2O7的磁化和磁致伸缩行为，在50 mK低温下发现磁滞现象和磁化曲线异常特征，通过计算证实该化合物具有偶极-八极量子自旋冰基态

We investigate the magnetization and the magnetostriction of the
dipole-octupole quantum spin ice candidate Ce2Hf2O7 down to 50 mK. We find that
the magnetization curves observed with the magnetic field applied along all the
principal axes ([100], [110], and [111]) exhibit a magnetic hysteresis below
around 300 mK. In addition, a kink-like feature is observed in the
magnetization under B || [111], at which the magnetostriction also shows a
convex field dependence. Our classical Monte-Carlo and quantum exact
diagonalization calculations demonstrate that these features in the
magnetization are well reproduced by the spin Hamiltonian with a dominant
interaction between the octupole moments and with a QSI ground state,
indicating the emergence of a dipole-octupole QSI in this compound.

This study investigates the dependence of the static magnetoelectric (ME)
effect on the external field direction in the pyroelectric-ferrimagnet
CaBaCo$_4$O$_7$, a topic that remains largely unexplored compared to dynamical
nonreciprocal ME effects. We measured the magnetization with respect to the
inherent polarization and found that an external electric field stabilizes the
ferrimagnetic phase when applied parallel to the polarization, and destabilizes
it when antiparallel. These results clearly demonstrate the
electric-field-direction dependent control of the static ME effect, suggesting
a new route to enhancing ME effects in pyroelectric-magnetic materials.

### Magnetotransport across Weyl semimetal grain boundaries

- **TL;DR**: 研究发现Weyl半金属界面的磁导率在磁场下呈现线性关系，这种线性性对界面杂质具有稳健性。磁导率的斜率取决于特征磁场强度B_arc，这个值取决于空间相关杂质的相关长度。

A clean interface between two Weyl semimetals features a universal,
field-linear tunnel magnetoconductance of $(e^2/h)N_\mathrm{ho}$ per magnetic
flux quantum, where $N_\mathrm{ho}$ is the number of chirality-preserving
topological interface Fermi arcs. In this work we show that the linearity of
the magnetoconductance is robust with to interface disorder. The slope of the
magnetoconductance changes at a characteristic field strength $B_\mathrm{arc}$
-- the field strength for which the time taken to traverse the Fermi arc due to
the Lorentz force is equal to the mean inter-arc scattering time. For fields
much larger than $B_\mathrm{arc}$, the magnetoconductance is unaffected by
disorder. For fields much smaller than $B_\mathrm{arc}$, the slope is no longer
determined by $N_\mathrm{ho}$ but by the simple fraction $N_\mathrm{L}
N_\mathrm{R}/(N_\mathrm{L}+N_\mathrm{R})$, where $N_\mathrm{L}$ and
$N_\mathrm{R}$ are the numbers of Weyl-node pairs in the left and right Weyl
semimetal, respectively. We also consider the effect of spatially correlated
disorder potentials, where we find that $B_\mathrm{arc}$ decreases
exponentially with increasing correlation length. Our results provide a
possible explanation for the recently observed robustness of the negative
linear magnetoresistance in grained Weyl semimetals.

### Bogoliubov quasi-particles in superconductors are integer-charged particles inapplicable for braiding quantum information

We present a rigorous proof that under a number-conserving Hamiltonian,
one-body quasi-particles generally possess quantized charge and inertial mass
identical to the bare particles. It follows that, Bogoliubov zero modes in the
vortex (or on the edge) of superconductors $\textit{cannot}$ be their own
anti-particles capable of braiding quantum information. As such, the heavily
pursued Majorana zero mode-based route for quantum computation requires a
serious re-consideration. This study further reveals the conceptual challenge
in preparing and manipulating braid-able quantum states via physical
thermalization or slow external fields. These profound results should reignite
the long-standing quest for a number-conserving theory of superconductivity and
superfluidity without fictitiously breaking global U(1) symmetry.

A wide range of strongly correlated electron systems exhibit strange
metallicity, and they are increasingly recognized as in proximity to
correlation-driven localization-delocalization transitions. A prototype setting
arises in heavy fermion metals, where the proximity to the electron
localization is manifested as Kondo destruction. Here we show that the Kondo
destruction quantum critical point is linked to the phenomenon of fixed point
annihilation. This connection reveals the absence of residual entropy density
at the quantum critical point and, thus, its thermodynamic stability. Broader
implications of our results are discussed.

We study the classical dipole-octupole pyrochlore spin systems in an external
magnetic field along the $[111]$ direction. We identify an intermediate
fragmented spin liquid phase that precedes full spin saturation, characterized
by the coexistence of three phenomena: U(1) spin liquid on the Kagome planes,
spontaneous $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry breaking, and partial spin polarization
from explicit symmetry breaking. We show that even without dipolar
interactions, the dipolar components can form a spin liquid driven by the
octupolar spin liquid. The physics manifests itself experimentally as shadow
pinch points: low-intensity pinch points underlying the strong Bragg peaks. We
discuss how these discoveries are directly relevant to various experiments on
dipole-octupole pyrochlore materials, including neutron scattering,
magnetization, and magnetostriction.

The electrical response of a material when illuminated with light is a key to
many optoelectronic device applications. This so-called photoresponse typically
has a non-uniform spatial distribution through the active device area, and the
ability to spatially resolve the photoresponse enables an in-depth
understanding of the underlying physical mechanisms. Scanning photocurrent
microscopy (SPCM) is a method that allows the spatial mapping of the
photoresponse by raster scanning a focused laser beam over the sample. SPCM is
becoming more popular due to its simplicity and power in unraveling fundamental
optoelectronic processes. In this review, first, we provide the fundamentals of
SPCM to lay the basics for the subsequent discussions. Then, we focus on the
literature that employs SPCM to identify the photoresponse of one- and
two-dimensional materials. We discuss SPCM measurement results of common
materials in detail and introduce a systematic approach to interpreting the
SPCM measurements. We have given particular emphasis on the photothermal
mechanisms that are excited by the focused laser beam and critically reviewed
studies in the literature from the perspective of laser-induced heating of the
electronic and the lattice degrees of freedom. Finally, we discuss the
shortcomings of SPCM in determining the mechanisms leading to the
photoresponse.

Spatially modulated symmetries are one of the new types of symmetries whose
symmetry actions are position dependent. Yet exotic phases resulting from these
spatially modulated symmetries are not fully understood and classified. In this
work, we systematically classify one dimensional bosonic symmetry protected
topological phases protected respecting multipole symmetries by employing
matrix product state formalism. The symmetry action induces projective
representations at the ends of an open chain, which we identify via group
cohomology. In particular, for $r$-pole symmetries, for instance, $r$ = 0
(global), 1 (dipole), and 2 (quadrupole), the classification is determined by
distinct components of second cohomology groups that encode the boundary
projective representations.

A comprehensive experimental and physics informed neural network numerical
inverse diffusion analysis is conducted in technologically important NiAlTi
ternary and NiCoFeAlTi quinary solid solutions for estimating and extracting
composition dependent diffusion coefficients. A systematic variation of tracer,
intrinsic and interdiffusion coefficients with composition could be estimated
in the ternary solid solution. Following, the possibility of producing Al Ti
constant PB diffusion profiles keeping constant Ni, Co, Fe in the quinary
system is demonstrated. The estimation of diffusion coefficients of all the
elements at the Kirkendall marker plane of a single diffusion couple profile is
elaborated. PINN optimisation parameters are established using self and
impurity diffusion coefficients in Ni and tracer diffusion coefficients at the
Kirkendall marker plane. The reliability of optimized parameters is validated
by comparing with the interdiffusion coefficients estimated from binary NiTi,
NiAl and PB diffusion profiles, indicating extendibility to even lower order
systems.

The search for intrinsic excitonic insulators (EI) has long been confounded
by coexisting electron-phonon coupling in bulk materials. Although the ground
state of an EI may be difficult to differentiate from density-wave orders or
other structural instabilities, excited states offer distinctive signatures.
One way to provide clarity is to directly inspect the phonon spectral function
for long wavelength broadening due to phonon interaction with the high velocity
EI phason. Here, we report that the quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) EI
candidate Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ shows extremely anisotropic phonon broadening and
softening in the semimetallic normal state. In contrast, such a behavior is
completely absent in the broken symmetry state of Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ and in the
isostructural Ta$_2$NiS$_5$, where the latter has a fully gapped normal state.
By contrasting the expected phonon lifetimes in the BCS and BEC limits of a
putative EI, our results suggest that the phase transition in
Ta$_2$Ni(Se,S)$_5$ family is closely related to strong interband
electron-phonon coupling. We experimentally determine the dimensionless
coupling $\frac{g}{\omega_0}\sim10$, showing Ta$_2$Ni(Se,S)$_5$ as a rare
"ultra-strong coupling" material.

### NiSi$_2$ as seed layer for epitaxial growth of NiAl and Cr on Si(001)

- **TL;DR**: NiSi₂作为种子层可实现Cr在Si(001)上的外延生长，突破了金属难以在硅上外延生长的限制

In general, metal layers cannot be grown epitaxially on Si due to the
tendency of metals to react and form a silicide. Even in case the metal layer
has a matching lattice symmetry and atomic distance, the Si/metal interface is
disturbed by the silicide thus preventing epitaxial growth. One exception is
NiAl which is known to grow epitaxially when deposited on Si(001). During the
growth, NiAl reacts with Si to form NiSi$_2$. In this work, epitaxial NiAl is
grown and significant silicidation is observed in accordance with previous
reports. However, the role that this silicide plays as a template for the
epitaxial growth of NiAl has not been clear to this date. We hypothesize that
NiSi$_2$ acts as a necessary seed layer between the Si substrate and the NiAl
layer. Additionally, NiSi$_2$ can be used as a seed layer for the epitaxial
growth of other metals besides NiAl. This was tested by growing NiSi$_2$
seperately and replacing the NiAl layer with Cr. Growing Cr directly on Si(001)
produced a polycrystalline layer. When NiSi$_2$ was used as a seed layer, the
Cr layer was found to be a single crystal with Si(001)//Cr(001) and
Si(100)//Cr(100). NiSi was also tried as seed layer for Cr and was found to
produce a polycrystalline Cr layer. Using NiSi$_2$ as a seed layer could enable
the growth of various epitaxial materials for industrial semiconductor
applications.

We present a comprehensive investigation of the influence of Ru concentration
on the lattice parameters, atomic magnetic moments, electronic structure, and
magnetic anisotropy energy of the full Heusler L2$_1$-type Mn$_2$Ru$_{1-x_p}$Ga
alloy, where x$_p$ = 0.0834 p with p=0,...,12. This study combines
first-principles calculations with data-driven techniques from artificial
intelligence, specifically principal component analysis (PCA), to reveal trends
and correlations across multiple structural, magnetic, and electronic
descriptors. For each composition, a set of inequivalent atomic configurations
was fully optimized. Structurally, the relaxed lattices exhibit anisotropic
expansion, with a pronounced elongation of the out-of-plane lattice parameter
($c$) relative to the in-plane lattice vectors, which promotes the development
of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. Our results reveal that an out-of-plane
easy axis emerges at intermediate Ru concentrations (25-28%), while low and
high Ru levels favor an in-plane orientation or even vanishing anisotropy. The
half-metallic character is also modulated by Ru content, appearing selectively
at both ends of the composition range. Additionally, the ferrimagnetic coupling
between Mn(4a) and Mn(4c) sublattices leads to nearly compensated magnetic
moments below 50% Ru content, with a net moment close to zero around 30%. These
findings open a pathway toward the design of tunable spintronic materials with
co-optimized perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and half-metallicity, making
Mn$_2$RuGa a promising candidate for magnetic tunnel junctions,

The two-magnon problem in the $k=-\pi/2$ sector of a \emph{finite-size}
spin-1/2 chain with ferromagnetic nearest-neighbor (NN) interaction $(J_1&gt;0)$
and antiferromagnetic next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) interaction $(J_2&lt;0)$ and
anisotropy parameters $\Delta_1$ and $\Delta_2$ is solved exactly by combining
a set of exact two-magnon Bloch states and a plane-wave ansatz. Two types of
two-magnon bound states (BSs), i.e., the NN and NNN exchange BSs, are revealed.
We establish a phase diagram in the $J_1/(|J_2|\Delta_2)$-$\Delta_1$ plane
where regions supporting different types of BSs are analytically identified. It
is found that no BSs exist (the two types of BSs coexist) when both $\Delta_1$
and $\Delta_2$ are small (large) enough. Our results for the isotropic case
$\Delta_1=\Delta_2=1$ are consistent with an early work [Ono I, Mikado S and
Oguchi T 1971 \emph{J. Phys. Soc. Japan} \textbf{30} 358].

We have investigated the electronic, optical, and mechanical properties of
six structures belonging to the Tubulanes-cross-linked carbon nanotube family.
Our results highlight the remarkable anisotropic mechanical behavior of these
materials, distinguishing them from isotropic structures, such as diamond.
Notably, the 8-tetra-22 structure has a higher Young's modulus ($Y_M$) along
the $z$-direction compared to diamond. Unlike diamonds, the mechanical
properties of Tubulanes are direction-dependent, with significant variations in
Young's Modulus (2.3 times). Additionally, the Poisson's ratio is highly
anisotropic, with at least one direction exhibiting an approximately zero
value. The inherent anisotropy of these materials enables tunable mechanical
properties that depend on the direction of applied stress. Regarding their
electronic properties, all Tubulane structures studied possess indirect
electronic band gaps, dominated by $2p$ orbitals. The band dispersion is
relatively high, with band gaps ranging from 0.46 eV to 2.74 eV, all of which
are smaller than that of diamond. Notably, the 16-tetra-22 structure exhibits
the smallest bandgap (0.46 eV), making it particularly interesting for
electronic applications. Additionally, these structures exhibit porosity, which
provides an advantage over denser materials, such as diamond. Considering the
recent advances in the synthesis of 3D carbon-based materials, the synthesis of
tubulane-like structures is within our present-day technological capabilities.

We apply perturbation theory of boundary conditions, originally developed by
A.B. Migdal and independently by S.A. Moszkowski for deformed atomic nuclei, to
finding eigenfrequencies of Raman-active spheroidal modes of a spheroid from
these of a sphere and compare the outcomes with the results of numerical
calculations for CdSe and silver nanoparticles. The modes are characterized by
the total angular momentum $j=2$ and are five-fold degenerate for a sphere but
split into three distinct modes, characterized by the absolute value of the
total angular momentum projection onto the spheroidal axis, in case of a
spheroid. The perturbation method works well in case of the rigid boundary
conditions, with the displacement field set to zero at the boundary, and
accurately predicts the splittings when the spheroidal shape is close to a
sphere, but fails in case of the stress-free boundary conditions.
