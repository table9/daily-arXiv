The local rules of Wolfram cellular automata with one-dimensional three-cell
neighborhoods are represented by eight-bit binary that encode deterministic
update rules. These automata are widely utilized to investigate
self-organization phenomena and the dynamics of complex systems. In this work,
we employ numerical simulations and computational methods to investigate the
asymptotic density and dynamical evolution mechanisms in Wolfram automata. We
apply both supervised and unsupervised learning methods to identify the
configurations associated with different Wolfram rules. Furthermore, we explore
alternative initial conditions under which certain Wolfram rules generate
similar fractal patterns over time, even when starting from a single active
site. Our results reveal the relationship between the asymptotic density and
the initial density of selected rules. The supervised learning methods
effectively identify the configurations of various Wolfram rules, while
unsupervised methods like principal component analysis and autoencoders can
approximately cluster configurations of different Wolfram rules into distinct
groups, yielding results that align well with simulated density outputs.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了两种物理嵌入策略来解决机器学习力场在有机系统中模拟时的结构崩溃和宏观性质预测偏差问题：自适应的键长采样方法和基于物理方程的分子间修正策略。

Machine learning force fields possess unprecedented potential in achieving
both accuracy and efficiency in molecular simulations. Nevertheless, their
application in organic systems is often hindered by structural collapse during
simulation and significant deviations in the prediction of macroscopic
properties. Here, two physics-embedded strategies are introduced to overcome
these limitations. First, a physics-inspired self-adaptive bond-length sampling
method achieves long-timescale stable simulations by requiring only several
tens of single-molecule data sets, and has been validated across molecular
systems, including engineering fluids, polypeptides, and pharmaceuticals.
Second, a top-down intermolecular correction strategy based on a physical
equation is introduced. This strategy requires only a small amount of
simulation data and completes the optimization of tunable parameters within a
few hours on a single RTX 4090 GPU, significantly reducing errors in density
and viscosity, as validated in systems including ethylene carbonate, ethyl
acetate, and dimethyl carbonate. Together, these approaches directly integrate
physical insights into the machine learning models, thereby enhancing
robustness and generalizability, and providing a scalable pathway for
physics-embedded machine learning force fields.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了三种新型三维五边形石墨烯同素异形体（3D-PG-α、β、γ），通过双轴应变和压缩二维PG层构建，具有热力学稳定性、半导体特性和显著的各向异性力学光学性质。

Carbon-based materials have attracted great attention due to their
exceptional structural diversity and wide-ranging applications. Recently, a new
two-dimensional carbon allotrope, named pentagraphene (PG), was proposed. In
this study, we proposed three novel three-dimensional (3D) PG allotropes, named
3D-PG-$\alpha$, -$\beta$, and -$\gamma$, engineered through biaxial strain and
controlled compression of 2D PG layers. Comprehensive stability analyses,
including phonon dispersion and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations
(AIMD), confirm their thermodynamic stability under room and high-temperature
conditions. 3D-PG-$\alpha$ is the most stable, exhibiting a cohesive energy 0.5
eV/atom lower than the least stable structure, 3D-PG-$\gamma$. Electronic
property characterization reveals semiconducting behavior for all structures,
with indirect electronic band gaps ranging from 0.91 to 2.67 eV. The analyses
of the mechanical properties showed significant anisotropy, with higher
stiffness along the in-plane ($xy$-plane) direction. Optical properties
highlight strong absorption along a wide range and a pronounced anisotropic
response. Additionally, the absorption spectra exhibit activity in the visible
region, and the refractive index and reflectivity indicate potential use in
ultraviolet-blocking devices.

### Magnetism Induced by Azanide and Ammonia Adsorption in Defective Molybdenum Disulfide and Diselenide: A First-Principles Study

- **TL;DR**: 二维过渡金属二硫属化物中，通过NH2和NH3分子吸附与硫/硒空位缺陷结合，可在MoS2和MoSe2中诱导局域磁矩，而W基材料无磁性响应。

Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have attracted
considerable attention due to their tunable structural, electronic, and
spin-related properties, particularly in the presence of point defects and
molecular adsorbates. Motivated by these aspects, we have investigated using
first-principles methods the magnetic properties induced by azanide (NH$_2$)
and ammonia (NH$_3$) adsorption on defective monolayers of Molybdenum Disulfide
(MoS$_2$) and Diselenide(MoSe$_2$). Spin-polarized density functional theory
(DFT) was employed to investigate the impact of mono- and di-vacancies on the
local spin environment and the role of molecular adsorption in modifying
magnetic behavior. The results show that pristine chalcogen vacancies do not
generate magnetism, whereas the adsorption of NH$_2$ and NH$_3$ creates
localized magnetic moments in Mo-based dichalcogenides. A notable case occurs
for MoSe$_2$, where NH$_3$ dissociation into NH$_2$ and H fragments on the same
side of the surface produces a net magnetic moment of 2.0 $\mu_B$. Tests
performed on W-based dichalcogenides under equivalent conditions showed no
magnetic response, and are reported here only for comparison. These findings
demonstrate that molecular adsorption combined with defect engineering can be a
practical approach to tune magnetism in 2D materials, with potential relevance
for spintronic and sensing applications.

### Pseudogap-induced change in the nature of the Lifshitz transition in the two-dimensional Hubbard model

We study the behavior of the density of states and the $B_{1g}$ nematic
susceptibility extracted from Raman response data across the doping-driven
Lifshitz transition comparing the weak and strong interaction cases. Our
results were obtained using cluster dynamical mean field theory for the
two-dimensional Hubbard model. In the weakly correlated Fermi liquid regime,
both quantities are approximately symmetric around the Lifshitz transition
doping $p_{LT}$. In the strongly correlated regime, the low-doping pseudogap
leads to an asymmetric, discontinuous evolution when the Fermi surface changes
from hole-like to electron-like at $p_{LT}$. The Lifshitz transition thus
changes character because it is tied to the pseudogap-Fermi-liquid transition.
These results are consistent with available observations and should foster
further experimental investigations.

- **TL;DR**: 开发了一种AI驱动的近红外表面增强拉曼光谱平台，用于快速、精确的病毒株级鉴定，解决了传统SERS方法的等离子体不匹配和AI诊断泛化性不足的问题。

Strain-level identification of viruses is critical for effective public
health responses to potential outbreaks, yet current diagnostic methods often
lack the necessary speed or sensitivity. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy
(SERS) offers great potential for fast and precise virus clarification through
unique vibrational fingerprints of biological components. However, existing
protocols typically operate outside of the tissue's transparent near-infrared
(NIR) window, and are further limited by the intrinsic complexity of clinical
viral samples, which complicates spectral analysis and recognition. Here, we
report an artificial intelligence (AI)-empowered NIR-SERS platform that
integrates machine learning with a rationally designed hybrid substrate: gold
nanostars (AuNSt) coupled with gold-coated carbon nanotube arrays (AuCNT). This
architecture generates highly localized plasmonic hot spots resonant tuned to
NIR excitation, as confirmed by electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS),
enabling effective signal amplification from viral components. Our system and
protocols provide accurate classification of respiratory viruses, including
influenza viruses and coronaviruses, not only at the type and subtype levels,
but also the more challenging strain level. This approach overcomes the
plasmonic mismatch in conventional SERS and the lack of generalizability in
AI-driven diagnostics. It shows promise for enhancing rapid virus detection and
identification of novel strains and outbreak response capabilities, thus
potentially addressing critical challenges in global public health
preparedness.

### Bond percolation in distorted square and triangular lattices

- **TL;DR**: 本文通过蒙特卡洛方法研究了扭曲正方形和三角形格子中的键渗流行为，分析了不同连接阈值下渗流阈值随扭曲参数的变化规律，发现两种格子表现出截然不同的渗流特性。

This article presents a Monte Carlo study on bond percolation in distorted
square and triangular lattices. The distorted lattices are generated by
dislocating the sites from their regular positions. The amount and direction of
the dislocations are random, but can be tuned by the distortion parameter
$\alpha$. Once the sites are dislocated, the bond lengths $\delta$ between the
nearest neighbors change. A bond can only be occupied if its bond length is
less than a threshold value called the connection threshold $d$. It is observed
that when the connection threshold is greater than the lattice constant
(assumed to be $1$), the bond percolation threshold $p_\mathrm{b}$ always
increases with distortion. For $d\le 1$, no spanning configuration is found for
the square lattice when the lattice is distorted, even very slightly. On the
other hand, the triangular lattice not only spans for $d\le 1$, it also shows a
decreasing trend for $p_\mathrm{b}$ in the low-$\alpha$ range. These variation
patterns have been linked with the average coordination numbers of the
distorted lattices. A critical value $d_\mathrm{c}$ for the connection
threshold has been defined as the value of $d$ below which no spanning
configuration can be found even after occupying all the bonds satisfying the
connection criterion $\delta\le d$. The behavior of $d_\mathrm{c}(\alpha)$ is
markedly different for the two lattices.

- **TL;DR**: 发现了一种新型可见光吸收材料CaCd₂P₂，通过光稳定表面转变在碱性OER条件下保持稳定，解决了太阳能燃料中光电极材料稳定性和吸收强度难以兼顾的问题。

A key bottleneck to solar fuels is the absence of stable and strongly
absorbing photoelectrode materials for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER).
Modern approaches generally trade off between stable but weakly absorbing
materials, such as wide bandgap oxides, or strongly absorbing materials that
rely on encapsulation for stability and are weakly catalytic, such as the III-V
family of semiconductors. Of interest are materials like transition metal
phosphides, such as FeP$_2$, that are known to undergo beneficial in situ
surface transformations in the oxidative environment of OER, though stability
has remained a primary hurdle. Here we report on CaCd$_2$P$_2$, a Zintl phase
visible-light absorber with favorable 1.6 eV bandgap, that we identified using
high-throughput computational screening. Using a combination of
photoelectrochemical measurements, microscopy, and spectroscopy, we show that
CaCd$_2$P$_2$ undergoes a light-stabilized surface transformation that renders
it stable under alkaline OER conditions. We also show that the well known OER
catalyst CoPi can act as a stable co-catalyst in synergy with the
\textit{in-situ} CaCd$_2$P$_2$ surface. The light-induced stabilization that
CaCd$_2$P$_2$ displays is in sharp contrast to the photocorrosion commonly
observed in visible light-absorbing photoelectrodes. The broader AM$_2$P$_2$
family of Zintl phases offers a significant opportunity to explore stabilizing
interface chemistry and re-design the manner in which low-bandgap
semiconductors are used for photoelectrochemical energy conversion.

### Nonequilibrium nonlinear response theory of amplitude-dependent dissipative conductivity in disordered superconductors

- **TL;DR**: 本文通过Keldysh-Usadel理论研究了超导体中耗散电导率的振幅依赖性非线性修正，揭示了Higgs模式、Eliashberg效应和直接光子作用对非线性电导的贡献机制。

This work investigates amplitude-dependent nonlinear corrections to the
dissipative conductivity in superconductors, using the Keldysh-Usadel theory of
nonequilibrium superconductivity, which captures the nonequilibrium dynamics of
both quasiparticles and the pair potential. Our rigorous formulation naturally
incorporates both the direct nonlinear action of the photon field and indirect
contributions mediated by nonequilibrium variations in the pair potential,
namely the Eliashberg effect and the Higgs mode. The third-harmonic current,
often regarded as a hallmark of the Higgs mode, arises from both the direct
photon action and the Higgs mode. Our numerical results are in excellent
agreement with previous studies. In contrast, the first-harmonic current, and
consequently the dissipative conductivity, receives contributions from all
three mechanisms: the direct photon action, the Higgs mode, and the Eliashberg
effect. It is shown that that the nonlinear correction to dissipative
conductivity can serve as a fingerprint of the Higgs mode, appearing as a
resonance peak at a frequency near the superconducting gap \( \Delta \). In
addition, our results provide microscopic insight into amplitude-dependent
dissipation at frequencies well below \( \Delta \), which is particularly
relevant for applied superconducting devices. In particular, the long-standing
issue concerning the frequency dependence of the amplitude-dependent quality
factor is explained as originating from the direct nonlinear action of the
photon field, rather than from contributions by the Higgs mode and the
Eliashberg effect. Our practical and explicit expression for the nonlinear
conductivity formula makes our results accessible to a broad range of
researchers.

### Dimensionality reduction of optically generated vortex strings in a charge density wave

- **TL;DR**: 本文通过飞秒激光诱导相变研究Pd-ErTe3系统中的拓扑缺陷动力学，发现光激发可以控制拓扑缺陷的维度和取向，为稳定竞争量子态提供了新途径。

In phase transitions, mesoscale structures such as topological defects,
vortex strings, and domain walls control the path towards equilibrium, and thus
the functional properties of many active devices. In photoinduced phase
transitions driven by femtosecond laser excitation, the temporal (pulse
duration) and spatial (penetration depth) structure of the optical excitation
present opportunities for control and creating structures with unique
topologies. By performing time-resolved optical pump, x-ray probe experiments
on the CDW system Pd-intercalated ErTe$_{3}$, we gain access to the nanoscale
dynamics of the mesoscale topological features (vortex strings) produced after
a quench, which have a different apparent dimensionality than the topological
defects predicted from the bulk system. We show that these vortex strings
persist for much longer than the electronic recovery time. The critical
exponent obtained from power-law scaling of the intensity as a function of
wavevector shows a reduction in the effective dimensionality of the topological
defects in the system, corroborated by time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau
simulations. Our results demonstrate a novel pathway to use light to control
the dimensionality and orientation of topological defects in quantum materials,
which could be used to stabilize competing quantum states.

### Pressure tuning of putative quantum criticality on YbV6Sn6

- **TL;DR**: YbV6Sn6是一种重费米子化合物，在0.4K下有序化，具有磁场调谐的量子临界点。本研究通过高压电输运测量发现，在1GPa以下恢复费米液体行为，而高于1GPa时出现非费米液体行为，表明存在由静水压力调谐的新量子临界性。

YbV$_6$Sn$_6$ is a recently discovered heavy-fermion compound that orders at
T$_N\approx 0.4$ K and exhibits a magnetic field-tuned quantum critical point
at $H \approx 10$ kOe. In this work, we have grown YbV$_6$Sn$_6$ single
crystals by the self-flux method, to investigate their physical properties at
ambient pressure and their electrical transport properties under hydrostatic
pressure. At higher temperatures, we observed a decrease in the Kondo
temperature, accompanied by the appearance of a local minimum followed by a
local maximum, associated with the onset of the coherent Kondo regime. Power
law fitting at low temperatures indicated a recovery of the Fermi-liquid regime
for pressures below 1 GPa. Above 1 GPa, a reentrance of non-Fermi-liquid
behavior is suggested by a decrease in the exponent $n$, accompanied by a
substantial increase in the parameter $A$, indicating the approach of a new
quantum criticality tuned by hydrostatic pressure. The broad range of
interactions present in YbV$_6$Sn$_6$, including RKKY, crystalline electric
field (CEF), and Kondo lattice effects, appears to lead to a complex phase
diagram. We present a putative phase diagram featuring double quantum
criticality tuned by both magnetic field and hydrostatic pressure.

### Density-Functional Tight Binding Meets Maxwell: Unraveling the Mysteries of (Strong) Light-Matter Coupling Efficiently

- **TL;DR**: 提出了DFTB+Maxwell计算框架，将密度泛函紧束缚与有限差分时域方法结合，自洽处理光腔与分子系综的强耦合问题，解决多尺度光-物质相互作用的理论挑战。

Controlling chemical and material properties through strong light-matter
coupling in optical cavities has gained considerable attention over the past
decade. However, the underlying mechanisms remain insufficiently understood,
and a significant gap persists between experimental observations and
theoretical descriptions. This challenge arises from the intrinsically
multi-scale nature of the problem, where non-perturbative feedback occurs
across different spatial and temporal scales. Collective coupling between a
macroscopic ensemble of molecules and a photonic environment, such as
Fabry-Perot cavity, can strongly influence the microscopic properties of
individual molecules, while microscopic details of the ensemble in turn affect
the macroscopic coupling. To address this complexity, we present an efficient
computational framework that combines density-functional tight binding (DFTB)
with finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations for Maxwell's equations
(DFTB+Maxwell). This approach allows for a self-consistent treatment of both
the cavity and microscopic details of the molecular ensemble. We demonstrate
the potential for this method by tackling several open questions. First, we
calculate non-perturbatively two-dimensional spectroscopic observable that
directly connect to well-established experimental protocols. Second, we provide
local, molecule-resolved information within collectively coupled ensembles,
which is difficult to obtain experimentally. Third, we show how cavity designs
can be optimized to target specific microscopic applications. Finally, we
outline future directions to enhance the predictive power of this framework,
including extension to finite temperature, condensed phases, and correlated
quantum effects.

### Universal Driven Critical Dynamics near the Boundary

- **TL;DR**: 该论文系统研究了Ising模型中不同边界普适性类的驱动临界动力学，发现加热动力学和部分冷却动力学遵循边界有限时间标度(BFTS)，而普通转变的冷却动力学表现出异常对数标度。

The celebrated Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) describes the scaling of physical
quantities when external parameters sweep through a critical point. Boundaries
are ubiquitous in real systems, and critical behaviors near the boundary have
attracted extensive research. Different boundary universality classes,
including ordinary, special, extraordinary, and surface transitions, have been
identified. However, the driven critical dynamics near boundaries remains
unexplored. Here, we systematically investigate the driven critical dynamics in
various boundary universality classes of the Ising model in both two and three
dimensions, and discover a wealth of dynamic scaling behaviors. We find that
for heating dynamics in all boundary universality classes, as well as for
cooling dynamics in special, extraordinary, and surface transitions, the
dynamic scaling behaviors of the order parameter can be described by a normal
generalization of the KZM, called boundary finite-time scaling (BFTS). In
contrast, for cooling dynamics in ordinary transition, we discover an abnormal
logarithmic scaling on the driving rate. Moreover, for the special transition,
in addition to temperature driving, we also consider the driven dynamics by
driving the surface couplings. For increasing the surface coupling across the
special transition point along the line of the ordinary transition, the
prerequisite of the KZM, which requires that the correlation length/time in the
initial state to be short-ranged, breaks down. We develop a generalized BFTS
for a nonequilibrium initial state characterized by the waiting time, or the
``age'', of the boundary. Possible generalizations are also discussed.

Condensed matter systems with coexisting Dirac cones and flat bands, and a
switchable control between them within a single system, are desirable but
remarkably uncommon. Here we report a layered quantum material system, KxNi4S2
(0 &lt;= x &lt;= 1), that simultaneously hosts both characteristics without involving
typical Kagome/honeycomb lattices. Enabled by a topochemical K-deintercalation
process, the Fermi surface can be fine-tuned continuously over a wide range of
energies. Consequently, a non-magnetic Dirac-metal state with a topological
nontrivial Z2 index of 1;(000), supported by first-principles calculations and
high mobility up to 1471 cm2V-1s-1, is observed on the K-rich x = 1 side,
whereas a flat-band induced antiferromagnetic state with TN up to 10.1 K
emerges as K-content approaches 0. The KxNi4S2 system offers a versatile
platform for exploring emerging phenomena and underscores a viable pathway for
in-situ control of quantum materials dominated by Dirac cones, flat bands, and
their interplay.

Understanding crystal growth and morphology is a fundamental issue in
condensed matter physics. In this work, we reveal the fractal morphology of
growing crystals of higher-order topological insulators and show that the
corners of the crystals grow preferentially compared to the edges in the
presence of the corner states. We further demonstrate that when we compare the
crystal shape of the higher-order topological insulator with that of the
trivial insulator with the same value of the fractal dimension $D_f$, the
former has a smaller value of the fractal dimension of coastlines $D_{f,c}$
than the latter. This indicates that, for crystals with a similar degree of
corner development, those in the higher-order topological phase have smoother
edges. Because the relationship between the area and the perimeter of the
crystals is governed by the ratio of these fractal dimensions, the higher-order
topological insulator and the trivial insulator exhibit distinct perimeter-area
relationships.

The interplay between unconventional superconductivity and altermagnetic
order has attracted much attentions. In particular, whether spin-triplet
superconductivity can be achieved by suppressing altermagnetism remains an open
issue. We investigate this issue using a minimal single-orbital Hubbard model
on a square lattice with vacancy superstructure, in which both conventional
antiferromagnetic and altermagnetic order can emerge on equal footing. We
illustrate the existence of a metallic normal phase with altermagnetism even at
half-filling due to the geometric frustration and Coulomb interaction.
Suppressing the altermagnetic long-range order using charge doping can lead to
both conventional antiferromagnetic and altermagnetic spin fluctuation. The
spin-singlet pairing is always favored when the conventional antiferromagnetic
spin fluctuation dominates. However, when the altermagnetic spin fluctuation
dominates, spin-triplet pairing may be induced. Implications of our results in
possible material candidates are also briefly discussed.

In this article, we propose the realization of conformal manifolds, which are
smooth manifolds of scale-conformal invariant interacting Hamiltonians in
two-dimensional quantum many-body systems. Such phenomena can occur in various
interacting systems, including topological surfaces or 2D bulks. Building on
previous observations, we demonstrate that a conformal manifold can emerge as
an exact solution when the number of fermion colors, \(N_c\), becomes infinite.
We identify distinct exact marginal deformation operators uniquely associated
with the conformal manifolds. By considering \(N_c\) as finite but large, we
show that quantum fluctuations induce a fermion field renormalization that
results in mildly infrared relevant or irrelevant renormalization-group (RG)
flow within a conformal manifold, producing standard isolated infrared stable
Wilson-Fisher fixed points. These can be grouped with ultraviolet stable fixed
points into a discrete manifold due to the spontaneous symmetry breaking of an
emergent \(SO(\mathcal{N})\) dynamical symmetry in the RG flow as \(N_c
\rightarrow \infty\). Additionally, we find a correlation between the direction
of the RG flow within the manifold and an increase in EPR-like entanglement
entropy. The infrared-stable Wilson-Fisher fixed points, induced by quantum
fluctuations, are linked to theories on the conformal manifold where
interaction operators are maximally entangled in flavor space. Our studies
provide an effective framework for addressing topological quantum critical
points with high-dimensional interaction parameter spaces, potentially housing
many fixed points of various stabilities. They also highlight the central role
of entangled conformal operators and their entropy in shaping universality
classes of surface topological quantum phase transitions. We conclude with open
questions and possible future directions.

Simulating electrochemical interfaces using density functional theory (DFT)
requires incorporating the effects of electrochemical potential. The
electrochemical potential acts as a new degree of freedom that can effectively
tune DFT results as electrochemistry does. Typically, this is implemented by
adjusting the number of electrons on the solid surface within the Kohn-Sham
(KS) equation, under the framework of an implicit solvent model and the
Poisson-Boltzmann equation (PB equation), thereby modulating the potential
difference between the solid and liquid. These simulations are often referred
to as grand-canonical or fixed-potential DFT calculations. To apply this
additional degree of freedom, Legendre transforms are employed in the
calculation of free energy, establishing the relationship between the grand
potential and the free energy. Other key physical properties, such as atomic
forces, vibrational frequencies, and Stark tuning rates, can be derived based
on this relationship rather than directly using Legendre transforms. This paper
begins by discussing the numerical methodologies for the continuum model of
electrolyte double layers and grand-potential algorithms. We then show that
atomic forces under grand-canonical ensemble match the Hellmann-Feynman forces
observed in canonical ensemble, as previously established. However, vibrational
frequencies and Stark tuning rates exhibit distinct behaviors between these
conditions. Through finite displacement methods, we confirm that vibrational
frequencies and Stark tuning rates exhibit differences between grand-canonical
and canonical ensembles.

Void nucleation in ductile materials subjected to high strain-rate loading
remains a critical yet elusive phenomenon to understand. Traditional methods to
understand void nucleation typically rely on experiments and molecular dynamics
and do not capture the underlying factors leading to void nucleation. In this
study, a convolutional neural network, specifically a U-Net enhanced with
attention gates is developed, to predict void nucleation probability in
pristine tantalum microstructures. The approach leverages a multi-channel
input, incorporating four channels of grain orientations and an additional
channel of grain boundary energy calculated via the lattice matching method.
Void nucleation probability fields are determined from post-mortem micrographs
and serve as ground truth, distinguishing void from no-void regions at the
pixel level. Pixel-level class imbalance, commen in such images, is addressed
by using Focal loss to guide the network's training to predict void nucleation
sites more effectively. The model not only predicts void nucleation sites
consistent with ground-truth but also reveals additional potential void
nucleation sites, capturing the stochastic nature of void nucleation. This
study shows that CNN-based models can predict void nucleation sites while
considering combined interplay of factors such as grain boundary energy and
grain orientation. In this way, machine learning can serve as a means to
understand the underlying factors leading to void nucleation thereby
contributing to a fundamental understanding of failure due to spallation in
ductile materials.

Quantum Hall Fabry-P\'erot interferometers are sensitive to the properties of
bulk quasiparticles enclosed by the interferometer loop, with the interference
phase containing information about both the quasiparticle statistics and the
Coulomb-mediated bulk-edge coupling. Previous studies have explored the role of
the bulk-edge coupling in an equilibrium picture where quasiparticles enter and
exit the interferometer rapidly compared to the timescale over which the
interferometer phase is measured. Here, we present data from a monolayer
graphene quantum Hall interferometer in the integer quantum Hall regime at $\nu
= -1$ and $\nu = -2$. Quantum interference shows phase slips associated with
the entrance of quasiparticles to the interferometer bulk. Tracing the
dependence of these phase slips on the magnetic field, we show that the
equilibration time can become as long as several minutes. We further use our
multi-gated geometry to identify two classes of phase slips. The first is
associated with the addition of a quasiparticle to a bulk `puddle' of
quasiparticles uniformly coupled to the entire chiral edge state, while the
second is associated with the addition of a quasiparticle trapped by a defect
site that couples predominantly to the closest portion of the edge.

We investigate the crystal structure, transport properties and specific heat
in five selected FeSe single crystals containing different amounts of disorder.
Transport measurements show that disorder significantly suppresses
superconducting transition temperature, $T_\mathrm{c}$, and upper critical
field, $H_\mathrm{c2}$. Specific heat results confirm a robust multi-gap
nature, a larger isotropic gap ($\Delta_\mathrm{s}$) and a smaller anisotropic
gap ($\Delta_\mathrm{es}$). The smaller gap $\Delta_\mathrm{es}$ becomes more
isotropic with increasing disorder. Additionally, FeSe is regarded as a
superconductor in the crossover regime from Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) to
Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) because of its comparable $\Delta$ and Fermi
energy $E_\mathrm{F}$. By introducing disorder, the BCS-BEC crossover in FeSe
can be tuned closer to BCS limit, reducing $\Delta/E_\mathrm{F}$ from 1.3 to
0.4.

- **TL;DR**: 对TbPt6Al3单晶样品的磁性研究表明，该材料在3.5K以下呈现c轴方向的共线反铁磁有序，属于体g波交变磁体

The magnetic properties of the Tb-honeycomb lattice compound TbPt6Al3, which
crystallizes in the NdPt6Al3-type trigonal structure, have been studied by the
measurements of electrical resistivity, magnetization M(T, B), and specific
heat on single-crystalline samples. The magnetic susceptibility, M(T)/B, for B
|| c = 0.1 T shows a cusp at TN = 3.5 K, which temperature decreases with
increasing the magnitude of B || c, while M(T)/B for B || a = 0.1 T remains
constant with decreasing temperature below TN. This anisotropic behavior
suggests a collinear antiferromagnetic (AFM) order of the Tb3+ moments pointing
along the c axis. The data of M(T)/B for T &gt; 10 K on the single crystal and
that of inelastic neutron scattering from powdered samples have been
simultaneously analyzed using the crystal field model. The analysis reveals the
non-Kramers doublet ground state for the Tb3+ ion under the trigonal crystal
field. The neutron powder diffraction measurement shows that the collinear AFM
structure with a magnetic propagation vector k = [0, 0, 0] is associated with
moments of 5.1 {\mu}B/Tb pointing along the c axis. Comparison of the magnetic
point group with the nontrivial spin Laue group indicates that TbPt6Al3 is
classified into bulk g-wave altermagnets.

Donor-acceptor (D:A) cocrystals offer a promising platform for
next-generation optoelectronic applications, but the impact of residual solvent
molecules on their properties remains an open question. We investigate six
novel D:A cocrystals of dibenzotetrathiafulvalene (DBTTF) and
1,4,5,8,9,11-hexaazatriphenylenehexacarbo-nitrile (HATCN), prepared via solvent
evaporation, yielding 1:1 molar ratios, and horizontal vapor deposition,
resulting in solvent-free 3:2 cocrystals. Combining spectroscopy and
density-functional theory (DFT) calculations, we find that, while the
electronic and optical properties of the cocrystals are largely unaffected by
solvent inclusion, the charge transfer mechanism is surprisingly complex. Raman
spectroscopy reveals a consistent charge transfer of 0.11 $e$ across all
considered structures, corroborated by DFT calculations on solvent-free
systems. Partial charge analysis reveals that in solvated cocrystals, solvent
molecules actively participate in the charge transfer process as primary
electron acceptors. This involvement can perturb the expected D:A behavior,
revealing a faceted charge-transfer mechanism in HATCN even beyond the
established involvement of its cyano group. Overall, our study demonstrates
that while solution-based methods preserve the intrinsic D:A characteristics,
solvents can be leveraged as active electronic components, opening new avenues
for material design.

Nanoscale transistors require aggressive reduction of all channel dimensions:
length, width, and thickness. While monolayer two-dimensional semiconductors
(2DS) offer ultimate thickness scaling, good performance has largely been
achieved only in micrometer-wide channels. Here, we demonstrate both $\it{n}$-
and $\it{p}$-type nanoribbon transistors based on monolayer 2DS, fabricated
using a multi-patterning process, reaching channel widths down to 25 nm and
lengths down to 50 nm. 'Anchored' contacts improve device yield, while
nanoscale imaging, including tip-enhanced photoluminescence, reveals minimal
edge degradation. The devices reach on-state currents up to 560, 420, and 130
$\mu$A $\mu$m$^{-1}$ at 1 V drain-to-source voltage for $\it{n}$-type
MoS$_{2}$, WS$_{2}$, and $\it{p}$-type WSe$_{2}$, respectively, integrated with
thin high-$\kappa$ dielectrics. These results surpass prior reports for
single-gated nanoribbons, the WS$_{2}$ by over 100 times, even in normally-off
(enhancement-mode) transistors. Taken together, these findings suggest that top
down patterned 2DS nanoribbons are promising building blocks for future
nanosheet transistors.

### Switching magnetic texture via in-plane magnetic field in noncentrosymmetric dipolar magnets: From skyrmions to antiskyrmions and nontopological magnetic bubbles

We theoretically investigate field-induced switching of magnetic topology in
a nanodisk-shaped sample of noncentrosymmetric dipolar magnet in which the
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction that stabilizes an antiskyrmion with $N_{\rm
sk}$=+1 and the magnetic dipole interaction that stabilizes a skyrmion with
$N_{\rm sk}$=$-1$ are in keen competition where $N_{\rm sk}$ is the skyrmion
number. Our micromagnetic simulations demonstrate that the competition offers a
unique opportunity to switch magnetic textures with distinct magnetic topology
among the antiskyrmion ($N_{\rm sk}$=+1), elliptical skyrmion ($N_{\rm
sk}$=$-1$), and nontopological bubble ($N_{\rm sk}$=0) in a deterministic
manner by application of magnetic fields parallel to the sample plane. By
calculating time and spatial profiles of energy contributions from respective
interactions and magnetic anisotropy, we clarify the physical mechanism and
properties of the observed field-induced topology switching phenomena. Our
findings are expected to provide useful insights into the spintronic
application of topological magnetism.

### Direct evidence for the absence of coupling between shear strain and superconductivity in Sr2RuO4

The superconducting symmetry of Sr2RuO4 has been intensely debated for many
years. A crucial controversy recently emerged between shear-mode ultrasound
experiments, which suggest a two-component order parameter, and some uniaxial
pressure experiments that suggest a one-component order parameter. To resolve
this controversy, we use a new approach to directly apply three different kinds
of shear strain to single crystals of Sr2RuO4 and investigate the coupling to
superconductivity. After characterising the strain by optical imaging, we
observe variations of the transition temperature Tc smaller than 10mK/% as
measured by low-frequency magnetic susceptibility, indicating that shear strain
has little to no coupling to superconductivity. Our results are consistent with
a one-component order parameter model, but such a model cannot consistently
explain other experimental evidence such as time-reversal symmetry breaking,
superconducting domains, and horizontal line nodes, thus calling for
alternative interpretations.

### Entanglement architecture of beyond-Landau quantum criticality

Quantum critical points beyond the Landau paradigm exhibit fractionalized
excitations and emergent gauge fields. Here, we use entanglement
microscopy--full tomography of the reduced density matrix of small subregions
and subsequent extraction of their quantum correlations--to resolve the
entanglement architecture near such exotic critical points. We focus on genuine
multipartite entanglement (GME). Through unbiased quantum Monte Carlo sampling
of RDMs across conventional O(2)/O(3) Wilson-Fisher transitions, and
unconventional XY$^*$, and N\'eel-VBS transitions in (2+1)d, we discover a
dichotomy: Landau criticality amplifies GME within compact subregions, while
non-Landau criticality redistributes entanglement into larger, loopy
configurations. Key signatures at non-Landau criticality include the absence of
three-spin GME, and the loss of non-loopy entanglement in unicursal regions.
Similar results in a critical resonating valence bond wavefunction confirm this
multipartite entanglement structure as a common feature of emergent gauge
theories. Our findings reveal a distinct entanglement architecture in
beyond-Landau quantum critical theories.

Competitive adsorption is a major challenge in understanding catalytic
activity, selectivity and reaction mechanisms in confined environments such as
zeolites. This study investigated competitive adsorption in MFI-type zeolites
(ZSM-5) using solid-state NMR, focusing on the interplay between toluene and
water. Quantitative 1H NMR spectroscopy identified three distinct populations
of adsorbed toluene evolving with increasing toluene loading. The adsorption
behavior was consistent across a series of samples with Si/Al ratio ranging
from 11.5 to 140. Combining 1D and 2D NMR techniques with sample engineering
(e.g. pore-blocking) enabled the assignment of the populations to toluene
within the zeolite channels, at the pore mouths, and adsorbed on the external
crystal surface. Crucially, introducing water to toluene-loaded zeolites caused
a partial displacement of toluene from the internal channels, but significant
removal from the pore mouths. This dis-placement occurred even in the highly
hydrophobic zeolite (Si/Al = 140), where water still preferentially adsorbed to
Br{\o}nsted acid sites and silanol species. The results highlight the critical
impact that competitive adsorption from solvents, products, or impurities can
have on the efficiency and selectivity of zeolite-mediated transformations.

The machine learning based approaches efficiently solves the goal of
searching the best materials candidate for the targeted properties. The search
for topological materials using traditional first-principles and symmetry-based
methods often requires lots of computing power or is limited by the crystalline
symmetries. In this study, we present frequency-based statistical descriptors
for machine learning-driven topological material's classification that is
independent of crystallographic symmetry of wave functions. This approach
predicts the topological nature of a material based on its chemical formula.
With a balanced dataset of 3910 materials, we have achieved classification
accuracies of 82\% with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model and 83\% with
the Random Forest (RF) model, where both models have trained on common
frequency based features. We have checked the performances of the models using
$5-fold$ cross-validation approach. Further, we have validated the models on a
dataset of unseen binary compounds and have efficiently identified 22 common
materials using both the models. Next, we implemented the $first-principles$
approach to confirm the topological nature of these predicted materials and
found the topological signatures of Dirac, Weyl, and nodal-line semimetallic
phases. Therefore, we have demonstrated that the implications of
frequency-based descriptors is a practical and less complex way to find novel
topological materials with certain physical post-processing filters. This
approach lays the groundwork for scalable, data-driven topological property
screening of complex materials.

In commensurate twisted homobilayers, purely radial Rashba spin-orbit fields
can emerge. The observed in-plane spin textures are mostly radial, and the main
features are successfully reproduced using a model Hamiltonian based on two
effective mass models including spin-orbit coupling, and a general
(spin-conserving) interlayer coupling. Extracting the model Hamiltonian
parameters through fitting of several twisted supercells, we find a twist angle
dependency of the magnitude of the radial Rashba field, which is symmetric not
only around the untwisted cases ($\Theta=0^\circ$ and $\Theta=60^\circ$), but
also around $\Theta=30^\circ$. Furthermore, we observe that the interlayer
coupling between the $K/K'$-points of the two layers decreases with the
increase of the size of the commensurate supercells. Hence, peaks of high
interlayer coupling can occur only for twist angles, where small commensurate
supercells are possible. Exploring different lateral displacements between the
layers, we confirm that the relevant symmetry protecting the radial Rashba is
an in-plane 180$^\circ$ rotation axis. We additionally investigate the effects
of atomic relaxation and modulation of the interlayer distance. Our results
offer fundamental microscopic insights that are particularly relevant to
engineering spin-charge conversion schemes based on twisted layered materials.

### Breakdown of the critical state in the ferromagnetic superconductor EuFe$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$

There are very few materials in which ferromagnetism coexists with
superconductivity due to the destructive effect of the magnetic exchange field
on singlet Cooper pairs. The iron-based superconductor
EuFe$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$ is therefore unique in exhibiting robust
superconductivity with a maximum critical temperature of 25 K and long-range
ferromagnetism below $T_\mathrm{FM}\approx19$ K. Here we report a
spatially-resolved study of the irreversible magnetisation in this system that
reveals a variety of novel behaviours that are strongly linked with underlying
ferromagnetic domain structures. In the superconducting-only state, hysteretic
magnetisation due to irreversible vortex motion is consistent with typical weak
vortex-pinning behaviour. Just below $T_\mathrm{FM}$, very narrowly-spaced
stripe domains give rise to highly erratic and irreproducible fluctuations in
the irreversible magnetisation that we attribute to the dynamics of
multi-vortex clusters stabilised by the formation of vortex polarons. In
contrast, at lower temperatures, ferromagnetic domains become wider and
saturated with spontaneously nucleated vortices and antivortices, leading to a
smoother but unconventional evolution of the irreversible state. This
observation suggests that the penetrating flux front is roughened by the
presence of the magnetic domains in this regime, presenting a clear departure
from standard critical state models. Our findings indicate that the mechanism
governing irreversibility is strongly influenced by the precise nature of the
underlying ferromagnetic domains, being very sensitive to the specific material
parameters of EuFe$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$. We consider the possible
microscopic origins of these effects, and suggest further ways to explore novel
vortex-domain magnetic behaviours.

Quantum spin liquids with long-range entanglement are of great interest for
applications in quantum technology. The quantum spin ice Pr$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ is a
promising example, where it is believed that structural disorder plays a key
role in enhancing quantum mechanical effects by introducing strains that split
the ground state doublet akin to the effect of a local disordered transverse
field. However, the precise defect structure responsible for this behaviour is
unknown. Here we have determined the intrinsic defect structure of
Pr$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ using neutron and x-ray scattering techniques supported by
density functional theory. We find the main defect is the stuffing of Zr$^{4+}$
sites by Pr$^{3+}$ ions, accompanied by charge compensating O$^{2-}$ vacancies,
and the relaxation of a neighbouring O$^{2-}$ ion to an interstitial site. Our
results explain the single-ion magnetism by considering the non-magnetic
singlets that arise on neighbouring sites as a result of the defect structure.
These singlets account for additional features in the crystal electric field
excitations. The effects caused by this low level of structural disorder are
magnified since several neighbouring Pr sites are affected. This makes a
significant contribution towards the observed broadening of pinch points in the
magnetic diffuse scattering, which was previously attributed purely to quantum
effects.

- **TL;DR**: 二维SnSe2纳米片的电输运性质随厚度减小呈现从半导体到金属的异常转变，这归因于表面缺陷态导致的n型掺杂和费米能级态密度增加。

This work examines the influence of thickness on the electrical transport
properties of mechanically exfoliated two-dimensional SnSe$_2$ nanosheets,
derived from the bulk single crystal. Contrary to conventional trend observed
in two-dimensional systems, we find a semiconducting to metallic resistivity
behavior with decreasing thickness. The analysis of low-temperature conduction
indicates an increased density of states at Fermi-level with decreasing
thickness, which is further corroborated by gate bias dependent conductance
measurement. The enhanced conductivity in thinner flake is attributed to the
n-type doping arising from surface defect states. The presence and evolution of
these defect states with thickness is probed by thickness-dependent
room-temperature Raman spectroscopy. Our study provides insights into the
thickness-dependent electronic transport mechanism of SnSe$_2$ and the crucial
role of defect states in governing the observed conductivity behavior.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究通过分析CeCu$_{5.8}$Ag$_{0.2}$材料在不同磁场方向下的量子临界涨落行为，揭示了量子相变由三维自旋密度波涨落驱动的机制。

Quantum phase transitions are among the most intriguing phenomena that can
occur when the electronic ground state of correlated metals are tuned by
external parameters such as pressure, magnetic field or chemical substitution.
Such transitions between distinct states of matter are driven by quantum
fluctuations, and can give rise to macroscopically coherent phases that are at
the forefront of condensed matter research. However, the nature of the critical
fluctuations, and thus the fundamental physics controlling many quantum phase
transitions, remain poorly understood in numerous strongly correlated metals.
Here we study the model material CeCu$_{5.8}$Ag$_{0.2}$ to gain insight into
the implications of critical fluctuations originating from different regions in
reciprocal space. By employing an external magnetic field along the
crystallographic $a$- and $c$-axis as auxiliary tuning parameter we observe a
pronounced anisotropy in the suppression of the quantum critical fluctuations,
reflecting the spin anisotropy of the long-range ordered ground state at larger
silver concentration. Coupled with the temperature dependence of the quantum
critical fluctuations, these results suggest that the quantum phase transition
in CeCu$_{5.8}$Ag$_{0.2}$ is driven by three-dimensional spin-density wave
fluctuations.

### Resolving the Bulk-Boundary Correspondence Paradox on Low-Symmetry Surfaces of Weyl Semimetals

Low-symmetry surfaces of topological semimetals offer access to boundary
phenomena hidden on conventional facets, yet systematic studies remain scarce
due to experimental challenges and the lack of a general framework for
reconciling bulk and surface periodicities. Here, we investigate the (103)
surface of the Weyl semimetal NdAlSi using angle resolved photoemission
spectroscopy and density functional theory. The (103) surface is an example of
a low symmetry surface that presents an apparent paradox to the bulk-boundary
correspondence. The surface periodicity to which the topological surface states
are expected to adhere does not correspond to the bulk periodicity of the Weyl
points. By showing that successive bulk Brillouin zones generate replicas that
accumulate into a superlattice commensurate with the surface Brillouin zone, we
demonstrate how the apparent bulk boundary correspondence paradox is resolved
and establish a universal criterion for arbitrary facets. The framework and
experimental results further suggests that overlapping Fermi arcs can hybridize
into closed Fermi arc loops, enriching boundary topology and enabling
unconventional transport, interference, and collective phenomena unique to
lowsymmetry facets.

### Noncontact friction in ultracoherent nanomechanical resonators near dielectric materials

- **TL;DR**: 研究发现超相干纳米机械振荡器在附近存在电介质时会出现新的耗散机制，这种由静电荷引起的介电损耗会显著降低机械品质因数，限制了超相干纳米机械谐振器的集成应用。

Micro- and nanomechanical resonators are emerging as promising platforms for
quantum technologies, precision sensors and fundamental science experiments. To
utilize these devices for force sensing or quantum optomechanics, they must be
brought in close proximity with other systems for functionalization or
efficient readout. Improved understanding of the loss mechanisms in
nanomechanical resonators, specifically the advent of dissipation dilution, has
led to the development of resonators with unprecedented coherence properties.
The mechanical quality factors of this new class of ultracoherent micro- and
nanomechanical oscillators can now exceed 1 billion at room temperature,
setting their force sensitivities below 1 $\mathrm{aN}/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$,
surpassing those of the state-of-the-art atomic force microscopes (AFMs). Given
this new regime of sensitivity, an intriguing question is whether the proximity
of other materials hinders mechanical coherence. Here we show: it does. We
report a novel dissipation mechanism that occurs in ultracoherent
nanomechanical oscillators caused by the presence of nearby dielectrics. By
studying the parameter scaling of the effect, we show that the mechanism is
more severe for low-frequency mechanical modes and that it is due to dielectric
loss within the materials caused by the motion of a resonator which carries
static charges. Our observations are consistent with the noncontact friction
(NCF) observed in AFMs. Our findings provide insights into limitations on the
integration of ultracoherent nanomechanical resonators and highlight the
adverse effects of charged defects in these systems.

### Gradient-based search of quantum phases: discovering unconventional fractional Chern insulators

- **TL;DR**: 提出基于梯度的量子相发现框架，通过定义可微的目标相损失函数将相搜索转化为哈密顿量空间中的优化问题，成功在kagome晶格上发现两种新型分数陈绝缘体

The discovery and understanding of new quantum phases has time and again
transformed both fundamental physics and technology, yet progress often relies
on slow, intuition-based theoretical considerations or experimental
serendipity. Here, we introduce a general gradient-based framework for targeted
phase discovery. We define a differentiable function, dubbed "target-phase loss
function", which encodes spectral fingerprints of a quantum state, thereby
recasting phase search as a tractable optimization problem in Hamiltonian
space. The method is broadly applicable to phases characterized by ground-state
degeneracy and can be extended to a wide range of symmetry-broken and
topological orders. As a demonstration, we apply it to spinless fermions on the
kagome lattice and discover two distinctive fractional Chern insulators (FCIs),
verified through detailed exact diagonalization: (i) at filling $\nu = 1/3$, a
"non-ideal" Abelian FCI whose band geometry lies far beyond the Landau-level
mimicry paradigm and all recent generalizations; and (ii) at $\nu = 1/2$, a
non-Abelian FCI stabilized purely by finite-range two-body interactions. These
results provide the first explicit realization of such types of FCIs and
establish a versatile paradigm for systematic quantum-phase discovery.

### Pure dephasing increases partition noise in the quantum Hall effect

- **TL;DR**: 量子霍尔边缘通道中的纯退相干（非弹性散射）可以增强分区噪声，噪声功率在强退相干极限下增加1+1/N倍，这与传统认知相反。

Quantum Hall edge channels partition electric charge over N chiral
(uni-directional) modes. Intermode scattering leads to partition noise,
observed in graphene p-n junctions. While inelastic scattering suppresses this
noise by averaging out fluctuations, we show that pure (quasi-elastic)
dephasing may enhance the partition noise. The noise power increases by up to
50% for two modes, with a general enhancement factor of 1+1/N in the
strong-dephasing limit. This counterintuitive effect is explained in the
framework of monitored quantum transport, arising from the self-averaging of
quantum trajectories.

### Spectroscopy and transport of nonpolarons in silicon and germanium: the influence of doping and temperature

We perform a first-principles investigation of electron-phonon interactions
in silicon and germanium, uncovering distinct non-polaronic spectral and
transport fingerprints in these archetypal covalent semiconductors. Using
many-body perturbation theory with the retarded cumulant expansion, we compute
quasiparticle energies, lifetimes, and phonon satellites beyond the
Dyson-Migdal approximation. Short-range crystal fields dominate coupling in
both materials, yet their low-temperature spectral fingerprints differ: Si
exhibits well-resolved satellites at both band edges, whereas Ge displays
strong sidebands mainly at the valence band maximum (VBM) and much weaker
features at the conduction band minimum (CBM). Phonon-induced satellites in
both materials broaden and merge with the quasiparticle peak at elevated
temperatures. Doping broadens peaks and compresses satellite-quasiparticle
separation, with n-type carriers affecting the CBM and p-type the VBM. Mobility
calculations, combining cumulant-derived phonon scattering with experimentally
motivated ionized-impurity scattering models, reproduce measured trends and
reveal Ge's consistently higher mobilities than Si, stemming from lighter
effective masses and weaker coupling. These results link band-edge asymmetries
and phonon energetics to measurable transport differences, providing a unified
framework for predicting mobility in nonpolar semiconductors.

We propose using spin-qubit noise magnetometry to probe dynamical signatures
of magnetic Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) physics. For a
nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center coupled to two-dimensional XY magnets, we predict
distinctive features in the magnetic noise spectral density in the sub-MHz to
GHz frequency range. In the quasi-long-range ordered phase, the spectrum
exhibits a temperature-dependent power law characteristic of algebraic spin
correlations. Above the transition, the noise reflects the proliferation of
free vortices and enables quantitative extraction of the vortex conductivity, a
key parameter of vortex transport. These results highlight NV as a powerful
spectroscopic method to resolve magnetic dynamics in the mesoscopic and
low-frequency regimes and to probe exotic magnetic phase transitions.

### Disorder-driven Weyl-Kondo Semimetal Phase in WTe$_2$

In this Letter, we report the observation of disorder-driven anisotropic
Kondo screening and spontaneous Hall effect in bulk WTe${_2}$, a nonmagnetic
type-II Weyl semimetal. We show that Kondo scattering emerges more prominently
in disordered samples and produces magnetoresistance that is strongly
anisotropic with respect to both current and magnetic field orientation,
reflecting the underlying type-II Weyl dispersion. Strikingly, we find a
spontaneous Hall effect in zero magnetic field, whose magnitude is enhanced
with disorder, together with a large second-harmonic Hall signal exhibiting
quadratic current scaling. Our analysis indicates that disorder-driven Kondo
interactions pin the Fermi level near the Weyl nodes. This enhances the Berry
curvature-driven nonequilibrium transport, accounting for both the second-order
and spontaneous Hall responses. These findings establish disordered WTe${_2}$
as a platform hosting Weyl-Kondo fermions and highlight disorder as an
effective control knob for inducing correlated topological phases in weakly
correlated Weyl semimetals.

### Interplay of vibrational, electronic, and magnetic states in CrSBr

The van der Waals antiferromagnet CrSBr exhibits coupling of vibrational,
electronic, and magnetic degrees of freedom, giving rise to distinctive
quasi-particle interactions. We investigate these interactions across a wide
temperature range using polarization-resolved Raman spectroscopy at various
excitation energies, complemented by optical absorption and photoluminescence
excitation (PLE) spectroscopy. Under 1.96 eV excitation, we observe pronounced
changes in the A$_g^1$, A$_g^2$, and A$_g^3$ Raman modes near the N\'eel
temperature, coinciding with modifications in the oscillator strength of
excitonic transitions and clear resonances in PLE. The distinct temperature
evolution of Raman tensor elements and polarization anisotropy for Raman modes
indicates that they couple to different excitonic and electronic states. The
suppression of the excitonic state's oscillation strength above the N\'eel
temperature could be related to the magnetic phase transition, thereby
connecting these excitonic states and Raman modes to a specific spin alignment.
These observations make CrSBr a versatile platform for probing quasi-particle
interactions in low-dimensional magnets and provide insights for applications
in quantum sensing and quantum communication.

Artificial Kitaev chains engineered from semiconducting quantum dots coupled
by superconducting segments offer a promising route to realize and control
Majorana bound states for topological quantum computation. We study a dimerized
Kitaev chain--equivalent to a superconducting Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model--and
analyze the behavior of the resulting two coupled chains. We show that
interference between Majorana edge modes from each chain gives rise to
observable signatures in nonlocal conductance. Additionally, we identify a
parity effect in the system length that governs the coupling of edge states,
supported by an analytical model. Our results provide experimentally accessible
probes for Majorana hybridization in mesoscopic topological superconductors.

### OpenCSP: A Deep Learning Framework for Crystal Structure Prediction from Ambient to High Pressure

- **TL;DR**: OpenCSP是一个针对高压晶体结构预测的机器学习框架，通过压力感知的数据采集和可扩展架构，在较小训练数据集上实现了与大型模型相当或更优的高压性能

High-pressure crystal structure prediction (CSP) underpins advances in
condensed matter physics, planetary science, and materials discovery. Yet, most
large atomistic models are trained on near-ambient, equilibrium data, leading
to degraded stress accuracy at tens to hundreds of gigapascals and sparse
coverage of pressure-stabilized stoichiometries and dense coordination motifs.
Here, we introduce OpenCSP, a machine learning framework for CSP tasks spanning
ambient to high-pressure conditions. This framework comprises an open-source
pressure-resolved dataset alongside a suite of publicly available atomistic
models that are jointly optimized for accuracy in energy, force, and stress
predictions. The dataset is constructed via randomized high-pressure sampling
and iteratively refined through an uncertainty-guided concurrent learning
strategy, which enriches underrepresented compression regimes while suppressing
redundant DFT labeling. Despite employing a training corpus one to two orders
of magnitude smaller than those of leading large models, OpenCSP achieves
comparable or superior performance in high-pressure enthalpy ranking and
stability prediction. Across benchmark CSP tasks spanning a wide pressure
window, our models match or surpass MACE-MPA-0, MatterSim v1 5M, and
GRACE-2L-OAM, with the largest gains observed at elevated pressures. These
results demonstrate that targeted, pressure-aware data acquisition coupled with
scalable architectures enables data-efficient, high-fidelity CSP, paving the
way for autonomous materials discovery under ambient and extreme conditions.
