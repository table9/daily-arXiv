- **TL;DR**: 本文提出了一种基于精确对角化计算的方法来识别量子无序有序现象，通过定义有效的量子转子模型来描述对称性相关基态之间的竞争，并建立了有限尺寸能谱分裂与ObQD选择能标之间的关系。

In frustrated magnetic systems with a subextensive number of classical ground
states, quantum zero-point fluctuations can select a unique long-range ordered
state, a celebrated phenomenon referred to as \emph{order by quantum disorder}
(ObQD). For frustrated spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ systems, unbiased numerical methods
able to expose ObQD are necessary. We show that ObQD can be identified from
exact diagonalization (ED) calculations through an analysis akin to the
Anderson tower of states associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking. By
defining an effective quantum rotor model, we describe the competition between
ObQD-induced localization of the rotor and its tunneling between
symmetry-related ground states, identifying the crossover lengthscale from the
finite-size regime where the rotor is delocalized, to the infinite system-size
limit where it becomes localized. This rotor model relates the characteristic
splittings in the ED energy spectrum to the ObQD selection energy scale,
providing an estimate that can be compared to spin wave calculations. We
demonstrate the general applicability of this approach in one-, two- and
three-dimensional frustrated spin models that exhibit ObQD.

- **TL;DR**: 本文首次直接观测到金属MgB₂中的Lindhard连续谱，使用超软共振非弹性X射线散射技术证实了费米液体理论中的粒子-空穴激发连续谱。

Understanding the excitations of quantum materials is essential for
unraveling how their microscopic constituents interact. Among these,
particle-hole excitations form a particularly important class, as they govern
fundamental processes such as screening, dissipation, and transport. In metals,
the continuum of electron-hole excitations is described by the Lindhard
function. Although central to the theory of Fermi liquids, the corresponding
Lindhard continuum has remained experimentally elusive. Here, we report its
direct observation in the weakly correlated metal MgB$_{2}$ using ultra-soft
resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS). We resolve a linearly dispersing
excitation with velocity comparable to the Fermi velocity and find quantitative
agreement with simulations of the non-interacting charge susceptibility. A
detailed analysis and decomposition of the simulations reveal the intra-band
origin of this low-energy excitation, confirming it as the Lindhard continuum.
Our results establish ultra-soft RIXS as a momentum-resolved probe of the
fermiology in metals and call for deeper investigations of continuum features
in RIXS and related spectroscopy of other materials beyond MgB$_{2}$.

- **TL;DR**: 计算任意离散群G在任意亏格可定向闭曲面上的Kitaev量子双模型的能级简并度，通过Drinfeld中心的任意子融合规则推导，获得精确的有限温度配分函数

We compute the degeneracy of energy levels in the Kitaev quantum double model
for any discrete group $G$ on any planar graph forming the skeleton of a closed
orientable surface of arbitrary genus. The derivation is based on the fusion
rules of the properly identified vertex and plaquette excitations, which are
selected among the anyons, i.e., the simple objects of the Drinfeld center
$\mathcal{Z}(\mathrm{Vec}_G)$. These degeneracies are given in terms of the
corresponding $S$-matrix elements and allow one to obtain the exact
finite-temperature partition function of the model, valid for any finite-size
system.

### Interplay between Hubbard interaction and charge transfer energy in three-orbital Emery model

- **TL;DR**: 使用DQMC方法系统研究三轨道Emery模型，揭示了重过掺杂区域ZRS单态破坏的特征、赝隙随电荷转移能变化的行为，以及AFM自旋关联的最优条件

We use the numerically unbiased determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) method
to systematically investigate the three-orbital Emery model in the normal state
in a wide range of local interactions, charge transfer energy, and doping
levels. We focus on the influence of the onsite Hubbard $U_{dd}$ and charge
transfer energy scale $\epsilon_p$ on the electronic properties via the orbital
occupancies, local moments, spin correlations, and spectral properties. Rich
features of the orbital-resolved local and momentum-dependent spectra are
revealed to associate with the possible Zhang-Rice singlet (ZRS) breakdown
reflected by the peak splitting near the Fermi level in the heavily overdoped
regime. Moreover, the pseudogap features at small charge transfer energy scale
(relevant to cuprates) are shown to diminish at larger $\epsilon_p$, which
implies the weakening or absence of the pseudogap in the infinite-layer
nickelates. Besides, an optimal value of $\epsilon_p$ is identified for
maximizing the antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin correlations. Our large-scale
simulations provide new insights on the well-established Emery model,
particularly in the regime of heavily overdoped and/or large charge transfer
energy scale.

### Calibrating a Finite-strain Phase-field Model of Fracture for Bonded Granular Materials with Uncertainty Quantification

To study the mechanical behavior of mock high explosives, an experimental and
simulation program was developed to calibrate, with quantified uncertainty, a
material model of the bonded granular material Idoxuridine and nitroplasticized
Estane-5703. This paper reports on the efficacy of such a framework as a
generalizable methodology for calibrating material models against experimental
data with uncertainty quantification. Additionally, this paper studies the
effect of two manufacturing temperatures and three initial granular
configurations on the unconfined compressive behavior of the resulting bonded
granular materials. In each of these cases, the same calibration framework was
used; in that, hundreds of high-fidelity direct numerical simulations using a
new, GPU-enabled, high-performance finite element method software, Ratel, were
run to calibrate a finite-strain phase-field fracture model against
experimental data. It was found that manufacturing temperature influenced the
elastic response of the mock high explosives, with higher temperatures yielding
a stiffer response. By contrast, it was found that the initial configuration of
the grains had a negligible impact on the overall behavior of the mock high
explosives, though it remains possible that local damage accumulation within
the specimens could be altered by the initial configurations. Overall, the
calibration framework was successful at creating well-calibrated models,
showing its usefulness as an engineering and scientific tool.

### Metastable phase separation and information retrieval in multicomponent mixtures

- **TL;DR**: 本文开发了亚稳态相分离的热力学形式体系，研究了多组分液体中信息处理的机制，发现复杂生物混合物可以通过亚稳态相分离进行信息检索。

Liquid mixtures can separate into phases with distinct composition. This
phenomenon has recently come back to prominence due to its role in complex
biological liquids, such as the cytoplasm, which contain thousands of
components. For simple two-component mixtures phase-separated states are global
free energy minima. However, local free energy minima, i.e. metastable states,
are known to play a dominant role in complex systems with many components. For
example, Hopfield neural networks can retrieve information from partial cues
via relaxation to metastable states. Under what conditions can phase separated
states be metastable, and what are the implications for information processing
in multicomponent liquids? In this work we develop the general thermodynamic
formalism of metastable phase separation. We then apply this formalism to an
illustrative toy example inspired by recent experiments, binary mixtures with
high-order interactions. Finally, as core application of the formalism, we
study metastability in Hopfield liquids, a class of multicomponent mixtures
capable of storing information on the composition of phases. We show that these
phases can be retrieved from partial cues via metastable phase separation.
Spatial simulations of liquids with a large number of components match our
analytical solution. Our work suggests that complex biological mixtures can
perform information retrieval through metastable phase separation.

- **TL;DR**: 开发了超灵敏太赫兹光谱技术，首次测量了零磁场维格纳晶体的交流电导率，观察到钉扎模式共振，揭示了无序对晶体稳定性的影响以及绝缘体-金属转变机制

In clean two-dimensional (2D) systems, electrons are expected to
self-organize into a regular lattice, a Wigner crystal, when their mutual
Coulomb repulsion overwhelms kinetic energy. Understanding the Wigner crystal
at zero magnetic field is a long-sought goal in physics, thanks to its
fundamental simplicity and possible connection to the density-driven
metal-insulator transition. To date, evidence for such a crystal has been
reported across various platforms. However, the AC conductivity of a zero-field
Wigner crystal, a key observable characterizing its electrodynamics, has never
been measured. Here, we develop an ultrasensitive on-chip terahertz (THz)
spectroscopy technique to probe the AC conductivity in electrostatically gated
monolayer MoSe2 encapsulated in hexagonal boron nitride. We observe a sub-THz
resonance corresponding to the pinning mode of a zero-field Wigner crystal,
whose frequency is orders of magnitude higher than those under high magnetic
fields. Using the pinning mode as an indicator, we reveal that moderate
disorder notably stabilizes the Wigner crystal. With increasing density towards
melting, we find that the pinning mode of the Wigner crystal coexists with a
growing Drude component characteristic of an electron liquid, and the
competition between these two components in the conductivity spectra leads to
the insulator-metal transition of the 2D electron system. Our findings not only
elucidate the low-energy electrodynamics of a zero-field Wigner crystal, but
also establish on-chip THz spectroscopy as a powerful probe for correlated
quantum phases in two-dimensional materials.

### Crystal Systems Classification of Phosphate-Based Cathode Materials Using Machine Learning for Lithium-Ion Battery

- **TL;DR**: 使用机器学习算法预测锂离子磷酸盐正极材料的晶体系统分类，通过特征选择和集成学习方法实现了高精度预测

The physical and chemical characteristics of cathodes used in batteries are
derived from the lithium-ion phosphate cathodes crystalline arrangement, which
is pivotal to the overall battery performance. Therefore, the correct
prediction of the crystal system is essential to estimate the properties of
cathodes. This study applies machine learning classification algorithms for
predicting the crystal systems, namely monoclinic, orthorhombic, and triclinic,
related to Li P (Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, V) O based Phosphate cathodes. The data used
in this work is extracted from the Materials Project. Feature evaluation showed
that cathode properties depend on the crystal structure, and optimized
classification strategies lead to better predictability. Ensemble machine
learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Extremely Randomized Trees, and
Gradient Boosting Machines have demonstrated the best predictive capabilities
for crystal systems in the Monte Carlo cross-validation test. Additionally,
sequential forward selection (SFS) is performed to identify the most critical
features influencing the prediction accuracy for different machine learning
models, with Volume, Band gap, and Sites as input features ensemble machine
learning algorithms such as Random Forest (80.69%), Extremely Randomized Tree
(78.96%), and Gradient Boosting Machine (80.40%) approaches lead to the maximum
accuracy towards crystallographic classification with stability and the
predicted materials can be the potential cathode materials for lithium ion
batteries.

### Assessing the Limits of Graph Neural Networks for Vapor-Liquid Equilibrium Prediction: A Cryogenic Mixture Case Study

- **TL;DR**: 该研究探讨了图神经网络(GNN)作为状态方程(EoS)替代模型的可行性，发现在当前配置下，GNN在汽液平衡计算中表现不佳，无法提供稳健的求解结果，且没有计算速度优势。

Accurate and fast thermophysical models are needed to embed vapor-liquid
equilibrium (VLE) calculations in design, optimization, and control loops for
cryogenic mixtures. This study asks whether a structure-aware graph neural
network (GNN; DimeNet++) trained on GERG-2008/CoolProp data can act as a
practical surrogate for an equation of state (EoS). We generate a ternary
dataset over 90-200 K and pressures to 100 bar, curate it with a 15% density
filter (reducing 5,200 states to 1,516), and pair each state with a lightweight
molecular-dynamics snapshot to supply structural features. The model is trained
in two stages; pretraining on residual Helmholtz energy followed by pressure
fine-tuning with a stability penalty; and evaluated via single-phase
interpolation tests, solver-free derivative-quality diagnostics, an audited VLE
driver, and a latency benchmark. Within its regime, the GNN interpolates
single-phase properties reasonably well; however, the VLE driver accepts no GNN
equilibria on tested binaries (all plotted VLE points are CoolProp fallback or
the solver fails), and diagnostic probes reveal jagged P(V|T) paths and
thermal-stability flags concentrated in dense/cold regions, indicating
insufficient derivative smoothness/consistency for robust equilibrium solving.
An end-to-end timing comparison shows no single-phase speed advantage relative
to CoolProp (tens of milliseconds vs sub-millisecond). We conclude that, as
configured, the surrogate in this study is not solver-ready for VLE and offers
no runtime benefit; its value is methodological, delineating failure modes and
pointing to remedies such as physics-informed training signals and targeted
coverage near phase boundaries.

Superconductor-normal-superconductor (SC-N-SC) weak links enable Cooper-pair
tunneling and serve as Josephson junctions (JJs) used in modern superconducting
qubits. Conventional JJs rely on vertically stacked Al-AlOx-Al trilayers that
are difficult to fabricate and are sensitive to ambient exposure. Here, we
demonstrate an all-in-plane alternative by "nanosculpting" ~100 nm-wide
channels into thin films of FeTe0.75Se0.25/Bi2Te3 (FTS/BT), a candidate
topological superconductor, with a Si++ focusses ion beam (FIB). Systematic
irradiation shows that increasing the ion dose, while keeping the beam energy
constant, progressively suppresses both the critical temperature (Tc) and
critical current (Ic), confirming the creation of a controllable weak link even
though a Fraunhofer interference pattern is not observed. Kelvin prove force
microscopy , atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy
corroborate the structural and electronic modification of the irradiated
region. Ic (B) measurements reveal a slower field-induced decay of Ic at higher
doses, indicating that irradiation-induced defects act as vortex-pinning
centers that mitigate vortex motion and associated dissipation, By tuning beam
energy and dose, the process shifts from SC-N-SC regime toward a
superconductor-insulator-superconductor (SC-I-SC) geometry, offering a simple
scalable pathway to JJ fabrication. These results established FIB pattering as
a versatile platform for engineering robust, scalable fault-tolerant qubits.

### Antiferromagnetic ordering and critical behavior induced giant magnetocaloric effect in distorted kagome lattice Gd$_3$BWO$_9$

We synthesize the high-quality Gd$_3$BWO$_9$ single crystal and investigate
its lowtemperature magnetic and thermodynamic properties. Below $T\rm_{N}$ =
1.08 K, the anisotropic behavior of magnetic susceptibilities reveals that the
Gd$^{3+}$ moments exhibit the dominant antiferromagnetic coupling along the
$c$-axis, while displaying a ferromagnetic arrangement in kagome plane. With
pronounced magnetic frustration, in adiabatic demagnetization refrigeration
experiments starting from initial conditions of 9 T and 2 K, Gd$_3$BWO$_9$
polycrystal reaches a minimum temperature of 0.151 K, significantly lower than
its $T\rm_{N}$. Due to the high density of Gd$^{3+}$ ions ($S$=7/2), the
maximum magnetic entropy change reaches over 50 J kg$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$ under
fields up to 7 T in Gd$_3$BWO$_9$, nearly 1.5 times as large as commercial
sub-Kelvin magnetic coolant Gd$_3$Ga$_5$O$_{12}$(GGG). The H-T phase diagram of
Gd$_3$BWO$_9$ under $H$//$c$ exhibits field-induced critical behavior near the
phase boundaries. This observation aligns with the theoretical scenario in
which a quantum critical point acts as the endpoint of a line of classical
second-order phase transitions. Such behavior suggests the importance of
further investigations into the divergence of magnetic Gr\"uneisen parameter in
the vicinity of critical field at ultralow temperatures.

### A Phase Field Formulation of Frictional Sliding Contact for 3D Fully Eulerian Fluid Structure Interactions

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种基于相场的三维动态摩擦接触数值方法，在欧拉流体-结构框架中统一处理法向和切向接触力，通过多个验证案例展示了与解析解的良好一致性和工程应用潜力。

Frictional sliding contact in hydrodynamic environments can be found in a
range of engineering applications. Accurate modeling requires an integrated
numerical framework capable of resolving large relative motions, multiphase
interactions, and nonlinear contact responses. Building on our previously
developed fully Eulerian fluid structure formulation, we introduce a phase
field based formulation for dynamic frictional contact in 3D. Contact detection
is achieved via the overlap of diffuse interfaces of colliding solids. The
normal contact response is defined as a volumetric body force proportional to
the overlap parameter, while the tangential response is computed using the
Coulomb friction model. The direction of the friction forces are derived by
projecting phase-averaged relative velocities onto the local tangent plane of
colliding bodies. This proposed unified treatment enables the computation of
both normal and frictional forces within a single momentum balance equation,
avoiding separate velocity fields for individual solids. We present several
test cases with increasing complexity to verify and demonstrate our proposed
frictional contact model. Verification against the Hertzian contact problem
shows excellent agreement with the analytical solution, with errors below $3\%$
in the traction profile. In the sliding block benchmark, the computed
displacement profiles closely follow the analytical solution for point-mass
systems across multiple friction coefficients. The ironing problem demonstrates
stable force predictions under finite deformation, with normal and tangential
forces matching kinetic friction laws. The robustness and scalability of the
proposed formulation are further demonstrated through a representative ship ice
interaction scenario with free surface and frictional sliding effects.

Spin systems are important to understand various physical properties in
quantum many-body systems. We numerically study the Gaussian fixed lines (GFLs)
of the $S=1/2$ XXZ chain with next-nearest neighbor (NNN) interaction in the XY
phase. The GFLs are the set of points where the coefficient of the umklapp
scattering vanishes. We show that the GFLs pass through the ``special points'',
which are defined as the points where the $sl_2$ loop algebra symmetry governs
in low-energy physics. In addition, we have discussed the Tomonaga-Luttinger
parameter K, and the metamagnetism influences the shape of the GFLs.

### A new skyrmion topological transition driven by higher-order exchange interactions in Janus MnSeTe

- **TL;DR**: 该研究发现二维Janus MnSeTe材料中高阶交换相互作用（HOI）引发了一种新型拓扑相变——铁性转变，揭示了HOI在斯格明子拓扑转变中的意外作用，同时发现该材料具有极高的斯格明子能量势垒。

Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals magnets offer a promising platform for
pushing skyrmion technology to the single-layer limit with high tunability.
While Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) is often recognized as central to
skyrmion formation, their stability, collapse, and topological transition in 2D
materials remain largely unexplored. In particular, the effect of higher-order
exchange interactions (HOI) on these phenomena is unknown. Here, using
first-principles calculations and atomistic spin simulations, we report a new
topological transition generated by HOI, which we term 'ferric transition', in
single-layer MnSeTe. Surprisingly, skyrmion stability and collapse remain
largely unaffected by HOI due to the dominant role of DMI near the saddle
point, whereas the Bloch point is strongly modified, giving rise to this novel
transition. This mechanism is fundamentally distinct from the well-known radial
and chimera transitions. Moreover, we predict that Janus MnSeTe exhibits
remarkably high skyrmion energy barriers due to its strong DMI, among the
highest reported for intrinsic 2D magnets. Our findings unveil an unexpected
role of HOI in skyrmion topological transitions and establish Janus MnSeTe as a
robust platform for 2D skyrmionics.

### Diagonal Born-Oppenheimer Corrections in Condensed-Phase Ring Polymer Surface Hopping

- **TL;DR**: 本文系统研究了环聚合物表面跳跃（RPSH）方法的两种变体（RPSH-CA和RPSH-BA）在不同反应机制下的性能，并考察了对角Born-Oppenheimer修正（DBOC）的影响。

Ring-polymer surface hopping (RPSH) is a unique mixed quantum-classical
dynamics method that seamlessly incorporates nuclear quantum effects (NQEs)
into non-adiabatic dynamics simulations via the extended phase-space of a
classical ring polymer. Here, we systematically investigate several variants of
RPSH in the frameworks of centroid and bead approximations (RPSH-CA and
RPSH-BA) in modeling the dynamics of the spin-boson system across different
reaction regimes, reorganization energies, and temperatures. Moreover, the
effects of including the diagonal Born-Oppenheimer correction (DBOC) on the
performance of the RPSH-CA and RPSH-BA methods are investigated. Our results
show that the RPSH-CA method, where non-adiabatic transitions are handled at
the centroid level, reliably captures NQEs and remains robust across different
reaction regimes. Adding DBOC improves the method's accuracy in specific
intermediate and non-adiabatic reaction regimes at low temperature. Conversely,
adding DBOC to the conventional fewest-switches surface hopping method was
found to over-damp the dynamics significantly and reduce accuracy, especially
at low temperatures. On the other hand, RPSH-BA results, where non-adiabatic
transitions are handled at the level of individual beads of the ring polymers,
are generally unreliable unless in the adiabatic reaction regime and at high
temperature. The inclusion of DBOC is not particularly helpful in remedying
this erratic behavior. As such, RPSH-BA is not recommended for including NQEs
in condensed-phase non-adiabatic dynamics simulations despite its early
successful reports in 1D scattering models. Our findings clarify when geometric
corrections are beneficial or detrimental to non-adiabatic simulations using
RPSH, providing practical guidance for atomistic condensed-phase applications.

Programmable electron-beam scanning offers new opportunities to improve dose
efficiency and suppress scan-induced artifacts in scanning transmission
electron microscopy. Here, we systematically benchmark the impact of non-raster
trajectories, including spiral and multi-pass sequential patterns, on two dose
sensitive techniques: electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) and
ptychography. Using DyScO3 as a model perovskite, we compare spatial
resolution, spectral fidelity, and artifact suppression across scan modes.
Ptychographic phase reconstructions consistently achieve atomic resolution and
remain robust to large jumps in probe position. In contrast, atomic-resolution
EELS maps show pronounced sensitivity to probe motion, with sequential and
spiral scans introducing non-uniform elemental contrast. Finally, spiral
scanning applied under cryogenic conditions in BaTiO3 thin films improves dose
uniformity and mitigates drift related distortions. These results establish
practical guidelines for the implementation of programmable scan strategies in
low-dose 4D-STEM and highlight the inherent resilience of ptychography to
trajectory-induced artifacts.

- **TL;DR**: 在Kagome晶格超导体CsV3Sb5中首次观测到零磁场下的反常热霍尔效应，证实了超导态中时间反演对称性破缺，但该效应与杂质诱导的外在机制一致而非本征量子化边缘电流。

Broken time-reversal symmetry (TRS) in superconductors can induce not only
spontaneous magnetization by the finite angular momentum of Cooper pairs, but
also anomalous thermal Hall effects (ATHEs), whose detection has been extremely
challenging. Here we report the successful observation of an ATHE developing
below the superconducting transition temperature at zero magnetic field in the
kagome-lattice superconductor CsV3Sb5. This finding is verified by the absence
of a signal in a conventional type-II superconductor using the same setup and
by ruling out the trapped-vortex effects through micro-Hall array measurements.
Remarkably, both the temperature dependence and the magnitude of the observed
anomalous thermal Hall conductivity are quite different from those expected for
the quantized thermal edge current of an intrinsic ATHE, but consistent with
extrinsic impurity-induced ATHEs in chiral superconductivity. Our study of ATHE
offers an alternative approach to probe TRS breaking in the superconducting
states.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究在受挫Kagome反铁磁体Gd3BWO9中发现显著的亚开尔文温度磁热效应，实现了168 mK的极低温度和502.2 mJ/K/cm³的大体积熵密度，超越了大多数已知的Gd基制冷剂。

Rare-earth (RE) based frustrated magnets have attracted great attention as
excellent candidates for magnetic refrigeration at sub-Kelvin temperatures,
while the experimental identification on systems exhibiting both large
volumetric cooling capacity and reduced working temperatures far below 1 K
remain to be a challenge. Here, through the ultra-low temperature magnetism and
thermodynamic characterizations, we unveil the large magnetocaloric effect
(MCE) realized at sub-Kelvin temperatures in the frustrated Kagome
antiferromagnet Gd3BWO9 with TN~1.0 K. The isothermal magnetization curves
indicate the existence of field (B) induced anisotropic magnetic phase
diagrams, where four distinct magnetic phases for B // c-axis and five magnetic
phases for B // ab-plane are identified at T&lt; TN. The analysis of magnetic
entropy S(B, T) data and direct adiabatic demagnetization tests reveal a
remarkable cooling performance at sub-Kelvin temperatures featured by a large
volumetric entropy density 502.2 mJ/K/cm3 and a low attainable minimal
temperature Tmin~168 mK from the initial cooling condition of 2 K and 6 T,
surpassing most of Gd-based refrigerants previously documented in temperature
ranges of 0.25-4 K. The realized Tmin~168 mK far below TN ~ 1.0 K in Gd3BWO9 is
related to the combined effects of magnetic frustration and
criticality-enhanced MCE, which together leave a substantial magnetic entropy
at reduced temperatures by enhancing spin fluctuations.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一个自动化、开源的神经网络原子间势能（NNIP）开发工作流，简化了高精度分子动力学模拟的创建过程

Neural-network interatomic potentials (NNIPs) have transformed atomistic
simulations, by enabling molecular dynamics simulations with near ab initio
accuracy at reduced computational costs and improved scalability. Despite these
advances, crafting NNIPs remains complex, demanding specialized expertise in
both machine learning and electronic-structure calculations. Here, we introduce
an automated, open-source, and user-friendly workflow that streamlines the
creation of accurate NNIPs. Our approach integrates density-functional theory,
data augmentation strategies and classical molecular dynamics to systematically
explore the potential energy landscape. Our active-learning strategy leverages
on-the-fly calibration of committee disagreement against true errors to ensure
reliable uncertainty estimates. We use electronic-structure descriptors and
dimensionality reduction to analyze the efficiency of our active learning
strategy, which is shown to minimize both false positives and false negatives
when deciding what to relabel with ab initio calculations. The method is
validated on the fully automated training of a NNIP for a diverse set of carbon
allotropes, reaching state-of-the-art accuracy and data efficiency. This
platform democratizes NNIP development, empowering users to achieve
high-precision simulations with minimal human intervention.

- **TL;DR**: 量子退火校正(QAC)模型通过引入副本和额外相互作用，能够在短退火时间内解决能隙小的优化问题，利用非绝热跃迁获得最优解。

Quantum annealing correction (QAC) models provide a promising approach for
mitigating errors in quantum annealers. Previous studies have established that
QAC models are crucial for ensuring the robustness of the ground state of the
Ising model on hardware. In this work, the effects of QAC models incorporating
replicas with additional interactions, specifically, the penalty spin model and
the stacked model, are investigated for problems characterized by a small
energy gap between the ground and first excited states during quantum
annealing, a well-known bottleneck to reaching the ground state. The results
demonstrate that these QAC models can obtain the optimal solution within short
annealing times by exploiting diabatic transitions, even for problems with a
small energy gap. These findings highlight the potential of QAC models as
practical near-term algorithms for hardware subject to runtime limitations and
control noise.

### Localization and Wetting of 4He Inside Pre-plated Nanopores

Low dimensional quantum fluids, where one can probe the effects of enhanced
thermal and quantum fluctuations on macroscopic quantum wavefunctions, can be
experimentally realized through transverse physical confinement of superfluid
helium on scales smaller than the coherence length. Reaching this scale is
difficult, requiring confinement in single or multiple pores with nanometer
radii. Porous silicates such as MCM-41 have a pore radius larger than the
coherence length of 4He, and in this work we systematically explore the
possibility of pre-plating pores with different elements to reduce the pore
size without localizing the confined superfluid. Through a direct solution of
the few-body Schrodinger equation combined with quantum Monte Carlo
simulations, we explore the behavior of helium confined inside cylindrical
nanopores for a range of pre-plating elements, including rare gases and alkali
metals. For rare gases, we find that helium remains strongly attracted to the
pore walls and any atoms in the core form an incompressible liquid. For alkali
metals such as Cs, weak interactions between helium and the pre-plating
material prevent localization near the walls and enable delocalization in the
pore center. Our results extend previous results for helium wetting on flat two
dimensional coated substrates to the curved geometry inside nanopores, and
demonstrate that alkali pre-plated nanopores may enable a tunable
one-dimensional confined quantum liquid of helium.

### Artificial Thermalization in Ring-Polymer Molecular Dynamics: The Breakdown of RPMD for Gas-Phase Reactions with Pre-Reactive Complexes and How to Fix It

- **TL;DR**: 环聚合物分子动力学(RPMD)在低温低压条件下对通过预反应复合物进行的双分子反应会预测出虚假的大速率，这是由于人工热化问题导致的。

Ring-polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) has become a popular method for
describing chemical reactions due to its ability to simultaneously capture
tunneling, zero-point energy, anharmonicity and recrossing. Here we highlight
that despite its many successes, great care must be taken when applying RPMD to
study gas-phase reactions at low pressure. We show that for bimolecular
reactions that proceed via pre-reactive complexes, RPMD predicts spuriously
large rates at low temperatures and pressures. Using the rigorous connection of
RPMD and semiclassical instanton theory, we demonstrate that this breakdown can
be understood in terms of an intrinsic problem with RPMD: artificial
thermalization. In the present context, this opens up reactive channels below
the reactant asymptote that should be energetically inaccessible, resulting in
erroneously large rates. We discuss practical strategies to overcome this
problem by combining the steepest-descent inverse Laplace transform with
Bleistein's uniform approximation to calculate the thermal rate given an
appropriate lower energy bound.

Electron-doped strontium titanate $\rm{SrTiO_3}$, known to be one of the most
dilute superconductors, is investigated on the basis of the first-principles
calculations. When the carrier density n decreases, the frequencies of the
ferroelectric optical phonons near the $\Gamma$-point monotonically decreases
in the overdoped regime with $n&lt;10^{20}/\rm{cm}^{3}$, while unphysical
imaginary phonon frequencies due to ferroelectric instabilities appear in the
underdoped regime with $n&gt;10^{20}/\rm{cm}^{3}$. We estimate the superconducting
transition temperature $T_{\rm{c}}$ by using the McMillan equation in the
overdoped regime and find that $T_{\rm{c}}$ increases with decreasing n as
consistent with experiments in the overdoped regime. Detailed analysis of the
Eliashberg function reveals that the increases in $T_{\rm{c}}$ with decreasing
n in the overdoped regime is mainly due to the contributions from the
ferroelectric soft-mode optical phonons.

We studied formation of charge density wave between valleys in a system with
a double-well-like dispersive valence band relevant for the rhombohedral
graphene trilayer. In a regime with 2 Fermi surfaces, electron- and hole-like:
one of radius $p_i$, another of $p_o$, an instability in particle-hole channel
appears at $q=q_c+\delta q$, where $q_c=p_o-p_i$. In a weak coupling regime
($x/\epsilon_F\ll 1$) presence of an additional energy scale $\propto m
q_c\delta q$ gives rise to several regimes with distinct spectrum and transport
properties: in a regime with small order parameter $x\lessapprox m p_F \delta
q$ Fermi arcs show up and substantially change conductance. At larger values of
the order parameter Fermi arcs are gapped out. Regimes are also distinguished
by different effective exponents $\gamma$ in conductance correction
$\sigma\propto \tau_D^\gamma$ where $\tau_D$ is scattering time off disorder
and $1\leq\gamma\leq 2$.

### Mean first-passage time of a run-and-tumble particle with exponentially-distributed tumble duration in the presence of a drift

- **TL;DR**: 本文研究了一个在有限区间上具有三种速度状态（v,0,-v）和恒定漂移的run-and-tumble粒子模型，分析了其首次通过吸收边界的统计特性。

We consider a run-and-tumble particle on a finite interval $[a,b]$ with two
absorbing end points. The particle has an internal velocity state that switches
between three values $v,0,-v$ at exponential times, thus incorporating positive
tumble times. Moreover, a constant drift is added to the run-and-tumble motion
at all times. The combination of these two features constitutes the main
novelty of our model. The densities of the first-passage time through $a$
(given the initial position and velocity states) satisfy certain forward
Fokker--Planck equations. The Laplace transforms of these equations induce
evolution equations for the exit probabilities and the mean first-passage times
of the particle. We solve these equations explicitly for all possible initial
states. We consider the limiting regimes of instantaneous tumble and/or the
limit of large $b$ tend to infinity to confirm consistency with existing
results in the literature. In particular, in the limit of a half-line (large
$b$), the mean first-passage time conditioned on the exit through $a$ is an
affine function of the initial position if the drift is positive, as in the
case of instantaneous tumble.

Accurate modeling of spin dynamics in hole-based quantum dot qubits demands
high-fidelity simulations that capture realistic device geometries, material
interfaces, and self-consistent electrostatics. Here, we present a
comprehensive three-dimensional study of gate-defined quantum dot hole spin
qubits in strained Si$_{0.2}$Ge$_{0.8}$/Ge heterostructures. In contrast to
prior work relying on idealized confinement or decoupled Poisson-Schr\"odinger
treatments, our approach combines self-consistent electrostatics with a
four-band Luttinger-Kohn Hamiltonian to resolve spin-orbit interactions,
wavefunction asymmetries, and g-tensor anisotropies in realistic device
structures. We quantify the impact of device size and gate bias on wavefunction
localization, electric-field-induced g-factor modulation, and identify "sweet
spots" in vertical electric field where g-factor sensitivity to charge noise is
minimized, enhancing spin dephasing times. Spin relaxation due to phonon
coupling is also modeled, revealing size-dependent T1 behavior consistent with
strong Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling and a magnetic-field scaling near
$B^{-8}$. This work establishes a predictive modeling framework for optimizing
spin coherence in planar Ge quantum dots and provides quantitative design
guidance for scalable, electrically controlled hole spin qubits in group-IV
semiconductors.

- **TL;DR**: 开发了自动化非限制性耦合簇计算的新方法，创建了包含3119个有机分子构型的UCCSD(T)级别数据集，并训练了机器学习势函数，相比DFT数据在力精度和活化能重现方面有显著提升

Accurately modeling chemical reactions at the atomistic level requires
high-level electronic structure theory due to the presence of unpaired
electrons and the need to properly describe bond breaking and making
energetics. Commonly used approaches such as Density Functional Theory (DFT)
frequently fail for this task due to deficiencies that are well recognized.
However, for high-fidelity approaches, creating large datasets of energies and
forces for reactive processes to train machine learning interatomic potentials
or force fields is daunting. For example, the use of the unrestricted coupled
cluster level of theory has previously been seen as unfeasible due to high
computational costs, the lack of analytical gradients in many computational
codes, and additional challenges such as constructing suitable basis set
corrections for forces. In this work, we develop new methods and workflows to
overcome the challenges inherent to automating unrestricted coupled cluster
calculations. Using these advancements, we create a dataset of gas-phase
reactions containing energies and forces for 3119 different organic molecules
configurations calculated at the gold-standard level of unrestricted CCSD(T)
(coupled cluster singles doubles and perturbative triples). With this dataset,
we provide an analysis of the differences between the density functional and
unrestricted CCSD(T) descriptions. We develop a transferable machine learning
interatomic potential for gas-phase reactions, trained on unrestricted CCSD(T)
data, and demonstrate the advantages of transitioning away from DFT data.
Transitioning from training to DFT to training to UCCSD(T) datasets yields an
improvement of more than 0.1 eV/{\AA} in force accuracy and over 0.1 eV in
activation energy reproduction.

### Achieving fully-compensated ferrimagnetism through two-dimensional heterojunctions

- **TL;DR**: 提出通过堆叠两种不同但等磁化的二维铁磁材料形成垂直异质结构来实现完全补偿铁磁性，该方法对晶格匹配和堆叠方式不敏感，更易于实验实现。

In addition to altermagnets, fully-compensated ferrimagnets are another
category of collinear magnetic materials that possess zero-net total magnetic
moment and exhibit spin-splitting, making them promising for low-energy
spintronics, high-density data storage and high-sensitivity sensors. Although
many methods, such as alloying, external electric field, Janus engineering,
ferroelectric field and spin ordering, have been proposed to achieve
fully-compensated ferrimagnetism, these approaches either face experimental
difficulties or produce a small spin-splitting or are volatile. Here, we
propose to form vertical heterostructures by stacking two different but equally
magnetized two-dimensional ferromagnetic materials. If an A-type
antiferromagnetic ordering is satisfied, a fully compensated ferrimagnet can be
formed. This vertical heterostructure approach is insensitive to lattice
matching and stacking manner, thus being more conducive to experimental
realization. Through first-principles calculations, we verify our proposal with
several examples, focusing in particular on
$\mathrm{CrI_3}$/$\mathrm{CrGeTe_3}$ heterojunction composed of experimentally
synthesized $\mathrm{CrI_3}$ and $\mathrm{CrGeTe_3}$ monolayers. The
calculations show that $\mathrm{CrI_3}$/$\mathrm{CrGeTe_3}$ is a
fully-compensated ferrimagnet, with pronounced spin-splitting, and that tensile
strain is more favorable for achieving fully-compensated ferrimagnetism. Our
work provides an experimentally feasible strategy for realizing
fully-compensated ferrimagnetism, thereby further advancing the development of
this field.

Quantum sensing with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond enables the
characterization of magnetic properties in the extreme situation of tiny sample
with defects. Recent studies have reported superconductivity in La3Ni2O7-delta
under pressure, with zero-resistance near 80 K, though the Meissner effect
remains debated due to low superconducting volume fractions and limited
high-pressure magnetic measurement techniques. In this work, we use diamond
quantum sensors and four-probe detection to observe both zero resistance and
the Meissner effect in the same La3Ni2O7-delta single crystal. By mapping the
Meissner effect, we visualized superconducting regions and revealed sample
inhomogeneities. Our combined magnetic and electrical measurements on the same
crystal provide dual evidence of superconductivity, supporting the
high-temperature superconductivity of La3Ni2O7-delta. This study also offers
insights into its structural and magnetic properties under high pressure.

### Phases and phase transitions of an $S=3/2$ chain on metallic and semi-metallic surfaces

Motivated by recent scanning tunneling microscopy experiments on chains of Co
adatoms on Cu surfaces, we investigate the physics of a spin-$3/2$ Heisenberg
chain with single-ion anisotropy ($D$) on metallic and semi-metallic surfaces.
In the strong Kondo coupling ($J_k$) limit, a perturbative analysis maps the
system onto a Haldane spin-1 chain with single-ion anisotropy,
ferromagnetically coupled to the metallic surface. This Haldane state, arising
from underscreening of the $S=3/2$ chain, is stable against small $D$ and
characterized by topological edge modes. The nature of the $D$-driven
transitions out of this state depends on the environment. Coupling to a metal
(semi-metal) is a relevant (irrelevant) perturbation at the decoupled fixed
point between the spin-1 chain and the two-dimensional electron gas. In the
large positive $D$ limit, the system maps onto an anisotropic spin-$1/2$ Kondo
system. For large negative $D$, in the Ising phase, spins are frozen. For small
$J_k$, the nature of the metallic phase dominates. On a two-dimensional
semi-metal, the Kondo coupling is irrelevant at the decoupled fixed point
($J_k= 0$), leading to a Kondo breakdown phase at weak coupling, irrespective
of $D$. In contrast, on a two-dimensional metal, the resulting dissipative
Ohmic bath is a marginally relevant perturbation, inducing antiferromagnetic
ordering along the chain. In this case, $D$ drives a spin-flop transition
between Ising and XY ordered phases. At $D=0$, we observe continuous
transitions between the Kondo breakdown or dissipation-induced long-range
ordered phases and the underscreened Haldane phase. These phase diagrams are
supported by scaling arguments and sign-free auxiliary-field quantum Monte
Carlo simulations.

Performing thermodynamic tasks within finite time while minimizing
thermodynamic costs is a central challenge in stochastic thermodynamics. Here,
we develop a unified framework for optimizing the thermodynamic cost of
performing various tasks in finite time for overdamped Langevin systems.
Conventional optimization of thermodynamic cost based on optimal transport
theory leaves room for varying the final distributions according to the
intended task, enabling further optimization. Taking advantage of this freedom,
we use Lagrange multipliers to derive the optimal final distribution that
minimizes the thermodynamic cost. Our framework applies to a wide range of
thermodynamic tasks, including particle transport, thermal squeezing, and
information processing such as information erasure, measurement, and feedback.
Our results are expected to provide design principles for
information-processing devices and thermodynamic machines that operate at high
speed with low energetic costs.

Magnetic interactions between impurity spins play a crucial role in
determining magnetic configurations in spintronic systems. Using a Green's
function formalism, we investigate Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY)
exchange interactions between two localized spins mediated by a two-dimensional
electron gas arising from two spin-polarized bands with Rashba spin-orbit
coupling (RSOC) and altermagnetic dispersion. We analyze two distinct regimes:
(a) strong out-of-plane ferromagnetic order, and (b) weak in-plane order. For
out-of-plane magnetization, the Heisenberg, Ising, and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
(DM) exchange interaction terms exhibit oscillatory spatial modulations and
asymptotically decay as $1/R^{2}$ with impurity separation. Besides, all
exchange terms display beating-like patterns that can be tuned via the exchange
coupling strength between conduction electrons and ferromagnetic ordering. The
DM vector lies within the two-dimensional plane, with the DM interaction being
odd in the RSOC strength, oscillatory, and increasing in magnitude with RSOC
strength. In contrast, it is even in the out-of-plane Zeeman field strength and
oscillatory. Furthermore, the Heisenberg interaction exhibits a non-linear
dependence on the altermagnetic band parameter. In the case of weak in-plane
order, the Heisenberg exchange interaction shows a non-linear dependence on the
in-plane exchange coupling strength.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种分层机器学习框架，通过将少量高精度量子计算结果的知识蒸馏到粗粒度的机器学习量子哈密顿量中，实现了凝聚相化学反应自由能的高精度计算

Obtaining the free energies of condensed phase chemical reactions remains
computationally prohibitive for high-level quantum mechanical methods. We
introduce a hierarchical machine learning framework that bridges this gap by
distilling knowledge from a small number of high-fidelity quantum calculations
into increasingly coarse-grained, machine-learned quantum Hamiltonians. By
retaining explicit electronic degrees of freedom, our approach further enables
a faithful embedding of quantum and classical degrees of freedom that captures
long-range electrostatics and the quantum response to a classical environment
to infinite order. As validation, we compute the proton dissociation constants
of weak acids and the kinetic rate of an enzymatic reaction entirely from first
principles, reproducing experimental measurements within chemical accuracy or
their uncertainties. Our work demonstrates a path to condensed phase
simulations of reaction free energies at the highest levels of accuracy with
converged statistics.

The ordering of magnetic or electric dipoles leading to real-space
topological structures is at the forefront of materials research as their
quantum mechanical nature often lends itself to emergent properties. Atomic
lattice vibrations (phonons) are often a key contributor to the formation of
long-range dipole textures based on ferroelectrics and impact the properties of
the emergent phases. Here, using monochromated, momentum-resolved electron
energy-loss spectroscopy (qEELS) with nanometer spatial resolution and
meV-spectral-precision, we demonstrate that polar vortex lattices in PbTiO$_3$
spatially modulate the material's vibrational spectrum in patterns that
directly reflect the overlying symmetry of the topological patterns. Moreover,
by combining experiments with molecular dynamics simulations using machine
learned potentials we reveal how these structures modify phonon modes across
the vibrational spectrum. Beyond simple intensity modulation, we find that the
chirality of the vortex topology imparts its unique symmetry onto phonons,
producing a distinctive asymmetrical spectral shift across the vortex unit
cell. Finally, the high spatial resolution of the technique enables topological
defects to be probed directly, demonstrating a return to trivial PbTiO$_3$
modes at vortex dislocation cores. These findings establish a fundamental
relationship between ferroelectric-ordering-induced topologies and phonon
behavior, opening new avenues for engineering thermal transport,
electron-phonon coupling, and other phonon-mediated properties in
next-generation nanoscale devices.

The recent advent of a new class of magnetic material named as altermagnet
(AM), characterized by a combination of momentum-dependent spin-splitting with
zero net magnetization, has opened up promising prospects for spintronic
applications. We theoretically explore how the altermagnetic spin-splitting
affects the thermoelectric quasiparticle current in AM-based superconducting
heterostructures. Our setup comprises of a bilayer system where a $d$-wave AM
is proximity coupled to an ordinary $s$-wave superconductor (SC). We calculate
the thermoelectric current carried by the quasiparticles applying a finite
thermal bias accross the junction. The behavior of the thermoelectric current
with the system's base temperature and chemical potential is very similar to
that in traditional SC heterostructures. Remarkably, the dissipative
thermoelectric current found in the AM junction is spin-split and thus
generates finite spin-polarization in the AM-based junction, which can approach
$100\%$ spin-polarization in the strong altermagnetic phase. We further
investigate the thermoelectric current in AM-based Josephson junction (JJ) and
illustrate how to achieve the diode effect in this AM-based JJ. The efficiency
of our proposed thermoelectric diode reaches upto $\sim 80\%$ and changes its
sign depending on the strength of the AM, enhancing the potential for
spin-calotronics applications.

Hyperfine interactions couple nuclear and electronic degrees of freedom. The
present work explores how hyperfine coupling within the Tm ions in TmVO$_4$
single crystals affects an electronic ferroquadrupole ordered ground state and
its associated field-tuned quantum phase transition. For temperatures below the
hyperfine energy scale, the nuclear moments reduce the critical field for the
electronic order, resulting in a dramatic back-bending of the phase boundary
delineating the ferroquadrupole order. This behavior is well described by a
single-ion semiclassical mean-field model. Moreover, analysis of the effective
Hamiltonian leads to a prediction of spontaneous nuclear magnetic order
mediated by 4$f$ electrons, which in principle persists with the application of
orthogonal antisymmetric strain, yielding a proposed electro-nuclear
tetracritical point.

Stochastic resetting is a powerful strategy known to accelerate the
first-passage time statistics of stochastic processes. While its effects on
Markovian systems are well understood, a general framework for non-Markovian
dynamics is still lacking, mostly due to its mathematical complexity. Here, we
present an analytical and numerical framework to study non-Markovian processes
under resetting, focusing on the first-passage properties of escape kinetics
from metastable states. We show that resetting disrupts the inherent time
correlation, inducing Markovianity, thereby leading to an efficient escape
mechanism. This work, therefore, provides a much needed theoretical approach
for incorporating resetting into complex chemical and biological processes,
which follow non-Markovian dynamics.

### Measuring pulse heating in Si quantum dots with individual two-level fluctuators

- **TL;DR**: 量子点器件中电压脉冲导致发热的机制研究，通过测量Si/SiGe量子点中的带电双能级涨落源来表征脉冲发热效应

To encode quantum information in semiconductor spin qubits, voltage pulses
are necessary for initialization, gate operation, and readout. However, these
pulses dissipate heat, shifting spin-qubit frequencies and reducing gate
fidelities. The cause of this pulse heating in quantum-dot devices is unknown.
Here, we measure pulse heating using charged two-level fluctuators (TLFs) in
Si/SiGe quantum dots. We find that the TLFs are susceptible to pulse heating.
The amount of heating depends on the pulse amplitude and frequency, but not on
the distance between the pulsed gates and the TLFs. The amount of heating also
generally depends on the idling voltage of the pulsed gates, suggesting that
electrons accumulated under or near the gates contribute to the heating. We
hypothesize that reducing the area of the gates with electrons nearby could
mitigate the heating.

The fermion sign problem constitutes a fundamental computational bottleneck
across a plethora of research fields in physics, quantum chemistry and related
disciplines. Recently, it has been suggested to alleviate the sign problem in
\emph{ab initio} path integral Molecular Dynamics and path integral Monte Carlo
(PIMC) calculations based on the simulation of fictitious identical particles
that are represented by a continuous quantum statistics variable $\xi$
[\textit{J.~Chem.~Phys.}~\textbf{157}, 094112 (2022)]. This idea facilitated a
host of applications including the interpretation of an x-ray scattering
experiment with strongly compressed beryllium at the National Ignition Facility
[\textit{Nature Commun.}~\textbf{16}, 5103 (2025)]. In the present work, we
express the original isothermal $\xi$-extrapolation method as a special case of
a truncated Taylor series expansion around the $\xi=0$ limit of distinguishable
particles. We derive new PIMC estimators that allow us to evaluate the Taylor
coefficients up to arbitrary order and we carry out extensive new PIMC
simulations of the warm dense electron gas to systematically analyze the sign
problem from this new perspective. This gives us important insights into the
applicability of the $\xi$-extrapolation method for different levels of quantum
degeneracy in terms of the Taylor series radius of convergence. Moreover, the
direct PIMC evaluation of the $\xi$-derivatives, in principle, removes the
necessity for simulations at different values of $\xi$ and can facilitate more
efficient simulations that are designed to maximize compute time in those
regions of the full permutation space that contribute most to the final Taylor
estimate of the fermionic expectation value of interest.

### Sinusoidal Displacement Describes Disorder in CsPbBr3 Nanocrystal Superlattices

Disorder is an intrinsic feature of all solids, from crystals of atoms to
superlattices of colloidal nanoparticles. Unlike atomic crystals, in
nanocrystal superlattices a single misplaced particle can affect the positions
of neighbors over long distances, leading to cumulative disorder. This elusive
form of collective particle displacement leaves clear signatures in
diffraction, but little is known about how it accumulates and propagates
throughout the superlattice. Here we rationalize propagation and accumulation
of disorder in a series of CsPbBr3 nanocrystal superlattices by using
synchrotron grazing incidence small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering. CsPbBr3
nanocrystals of colloidal softness S in the range of 0.3-0.7 were obtained by
preparing particles with different sizes and ligand mixtures, consisting of
oleic acid and primary amines of variable lengths. Most diffraction patterns
showed clear signatures of anisotropic disorder, with multilayer diffraction
characteristics of high structural coherence visible only for the {100} axial
directions and lost in all other directions. As the softness decreased, the
superlattices transitioned to a more ordered regime where small-angle
diffraction peaks became resolution-limited, and superlattice multilayer
diffraction appeared for the (110) diagonal reflections. To rationalize these
anisotropies in structural coherence and their dependence on superlattice
softness, we propose a sinusoidal displacement model where longitudinal and
transverse displacements modulate nanocrystal positions. The model explains
experimental observations and advances the understanding of disorder in
mesocrystalline systems as they approach the limits of structural perfection.

We generalize the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki model to a spin-\(S\)
ferromagnetic model with exactly-written ground states, known as the
partially-magnetized valence bond solid (VBS) states with magnetization
$m=(S-1)/S$.
  We find that the VBS state and an antiferromagnetic ground state with
magnetization $m=0$ are degenerate for $S=3/2$ and $S=2$ by using the Lanczos
method and the density matrix renormalization group method (DMRG).
  However, increasing $S$, the magnetization of the ground states is uniquely
determined as the fraction $m=(S-1)/S$.
  This is not just a ferromagnet, but a quantum ferromagnet due to quantum
entanglement inherent in VBS states.
  In the low-energy excitation spectrum, we find the coexistence of the Haldane
gap and Goldstone-like ferromagnetic magnon excitation.
  This ``magnetic chimera'' clearly appears under a finite magnetic field.
  Finally, we discuss an application to the measurement-based quantum
computation and an extension of the Haldane's conjecture.

Exact single-time and two-time correlations and the two-time response
function are found for the order-parameter in the voter model with
nearest-neighbour interactions. Their explicit dynamical scaling functions are
shown to be continuous functions of the space dimension $d&gt;0$. Their form
reproduces the predictions of non-equilibrium representations of the
Schr\"odinger algebra for models with dynamical exponent $\mathpzc{z}=2$ and
with the dominant noise-source coming from the heat bath. Hence the ageing in
the voter model is a paradigm for relaxations in non-equilibrium critical
dynamics, without detailed balance, and with the upper critical dimension
$d^*=2$.

Trilayer graphene allows systematic control of its electronic structure
through stacking sequence and twist geometry, providing a versatile platform
for correlated states. Here we report magnetotransport in alternating twisted
trilayer graphene with a twist angle of about 5$^{\circ}$. The data reveal an
electron-hole asymmetry that can be captured by introducing layer-dependent
potential shifts. At charge neutrality ($\nu_{\mathrm{tot}}=0$), three
low-resistance states appear, which Hartree-Fock mean-field analysis attributes
to emerging spin-resolved helical edge modes similar to those of quantum spin
Hall insulators. At $\nu_{\mathrm{tot}}=-1$, we also observe suppressed
resistance when the middle and bottom layers are each half filled while the top
layer remains inert at $\nu=-2$, consistent with an interlayer excitonic
quantum Hall state. These results demonstrate correlated interlayer quantum
Hall phases in alternating twisted trilayer graphene, including spin-resolved
edge transport and excitonic order.

- **TL;DR**: 实验发现天然重晶石在低温下（50-80°C）仍能通过固态扩散与溶液进行快速的硫和钡同位素交换，挑战了低温下固态扩散可忽略的传统观点。

The prevailing view that solid-state diffusion is negligible at low
temperatures is challenged by rapid sulfur and barium isotope exchange between
natural barite crystals and aqueous solutions in laboratory experiments. This
assumption relies on diffusivities extrapolated from high-temperature
experiments. Here, isotope exchange rates were measured in solutions enriched
with 137Ba and 32S at 50 and 80 oC for less than 10,360 hours. SIMS depth
profiles revealed 137Ba enrichment to ~75 nm, with shapes characteristic of
classical diffusion. Isotope disequilibrium between the barite surface and
aqueous solution implies a continuous supply from the interior. These results
indicate that defects and vacancies in barite and similar low-temperature
minerals enable effective solid-state diffusion, with profound implications for
paleoenvironmental reconstructions, materials science, and engineering.

- **TL;DR**: 本文通过第一性原理计算揭示了金刚石中NV色心电致发光的机制，解释了电致发光强度弱于光致发光的原因以及NV-发光消失的现象

As the electroluminescence (EL) of NV color centers in diamond has been
realized in p-i-n diodes,the underlying mechanism remains a puzzle for longer
than a decade. In this study,using first-principles approaches,the electronic
configurations and the possible transitions are comprehensively investigated.
Based on the calculated carrier cross sections and transition rates,the
mechanism of the EL of NV centers and the charge-state dynamics are revealed.
The continuous EL is maintained by the cycle of NV0 ground (GNV0),NV+
metastable (MNV+) and NV0 excited state (ENV0). The weaker EL intensity
compared to photoluminescence (PL) is explained by the bottleneck transition
from MNV+ to ENV0 and another non-luminescent transition cycle.
Additionally,our results also explain the disappearance of the luminescence of
NV- as a result of unbalanced transitions between NV- and NV0. This study not
only reveal the mechanism of electroluminescence of NV centers and explain
experimental observations,but also provide first-principles insights to
understand the charge-dynamics of other color centers under electric and
optical field.

Femtosecond laser control of antiferromagnetic order is a cornerstone for
future memory and logic devices operating at terahertz clock rates. The advent
of altermagnets -- antiferromagnets with unconventional spin-group symmetries
-- creates new opportunities in this evolving field. Here, we demonstrate
ultrafast laser-induced switching in altermagnetic $\alpha$-MnTe that
orchestrates the concerted dynamics of charge, lattice, and spin degrees of
freedom. Time-resolved reflectivity and birefringence measurements reveal that
the transient melting of spin order is accompanied by pronounced structural and
electronic instabilities, as evidenced by phonon nonlinearity and accelerated
band gap shrinkage. Theoretical modeling highlights the key roles of robust
magnetic correlations and spin-charge coupling pathways intrinsic to this
altermagnet.

### Improving the efficiency of finite-time memory erasure with potential barrier shaping

Erasure of the binary memory, 0 or 1, is an essential step for digital
computation as it involves irreversible logic operations. In the classical
case, the erasure of a bit of memory is accompanied by the evolution of a
minimum amount of heat set by the Landauer bound kTln2, which can be achieved
in the asymptotic limit. However, the erasure of memory needs to be completed
within a finite time for practical and effective computational processes. It is
observed that the higher the speed of erasure, the greater the amount of heat
released, which leads to unfavorable environmental conditions. Therefore, this
is a fundamental challenge to reduce the evolved heat related to finite-time
memory erasure. In the present work, we address this crucial aspect in the
field of information thermodynamics, where the two memory states correspond to
the two wells of a bistable potential, as in the conventional cases. However,
the potential is asymmetric in terms of the width of the two wells. Moreover,
the two memory states are separated by a barrier that is asymmetric in
structure. We examine in detail the effect of the degree of asymmetry on the
success rate of the erasure process and the work done or heat released
associated with it. We find that the asymmetry in the potential barrier
partitioning the two memory states plays a very significant role in improving
the efficiency of the erasure process, in view of the success rate and the
thermodynamic costs.

We report real-time detection of longitudinal and transverse transport
responses across distinct frequency bands in a ferromagnetic filling factor
$\nu$ = 1 integer quantum Hall state. By tuning $\nu$, we simultaneously access
the evolution of the screening environment and bulk excitation structure. The
resulting asymmetric breakdown, for $\nu&gt;1$ and $\nu&lt;1$, reveals that
interaction effects, rather than a single-particle band picture, dominate the
transport instability. Our findings highlight the indispensability of
electron-electron interactions even in integer quantum Hall phases, suggesting
that distinct many-body entanglement structures underlie both integer and
fractional topological phases.

Polaritons - hybrid light-matter states formed from the strong coupling of a
bright molecular transition with a confined photonic mode - may offer new
opportunities for optical control of molecular behavior. Vibrational strong
coupling (VSC) has been reported to impact ground-state chemical reactivity,
but its influence on electronic excited-state dynamics remains unexplored.
Here, we take a first step towards excited-state VSC by demonstrating optical
modulation of the ReCl(CO)$_3$(bpy), (bpy = 2,2-bipyridine) complex under VSC
using femtosecond ultraviolet (UV)-pump/infrared (IR)-probe spectroscopy. We
establish ground-state VSC of ReCl(CO)$_3$(bpy) in a microfluidic Fabry-P\'erot
cavity equipped with indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated mirrors. ITO is effectively
dichroic as it is reflective in the IR and transmissive in the UV-visible and
therefore minimizes optical interference. Excitation with UV pump light drives
ReCl(CO)$_3$(bpy) into a manifold of electronic excited states which
subsequently undergo non-radiative relaxation dynamics. We probe the transient
response of the strongly-coupled system in the mid-IR, observing both Rabi
contraction and cavity-filtered excited state absorption signatures. We
reconstruct the intrinsic response of intracavity molecules from the transient
cavity transmission spectra to enable quantitative comparison with extracavity
control experiments. We report no changes in the excited-state dynamics of
ReCl(CO)$_3$(bpy) under ground-state VSC. However, we do observe significant
amplification of transient vibrational signals due to classical cavity-enhanced
optical effects. This effort lays the groundwork to pursue direct excited-state
VSC aimed at modulating photochemical reactivity.

Structural twirls form spontaneously in the domain wall networks of some
moir\'e materials. We show that in heterobilayers, neighboring twirl
chiralities tend to anti-align, forming staggered patterns that are well
described by antiferromagnetic lattice $\phi^4$ theories. In moir\'e systems
with triangular domains, this leads to frustration in the chirality
configuration of the structural twirls and to hysteresis with respect to
variation of the average twist angle and possibly other control parameters.

- **TL;DR**: 通过中子衍射研究CeAlGe的磁性结构，发现局域Ce磁矩模型能定量解释观测数据，支持具有半整数拓扑电荷的粒子状自旋纹理，为拓扑霍尔效应提供微观解释

We report a neutron diffraction study of the magnetic structure of CeAlGe, a
candidate topological semimetal that hosts a non-collinear, multi-$\mathbf{k}$
magnetic phase. By measuring both low- and high-momentum-transfer magnetic
Bragg peaks within a single experimental setup, we refine a magnetic structure
model based solely on localized Ce moments. This model, which differs from that
obtained using only high-$Q$ data, quantitatively reproduces the observed
intensities, including the $(000)$ zeroth-order magnetic satellites that are
especially sensitive to subtle components of the modulation. While a
contribution from itinerant electrons to the zeroth satellite cannot be
definitively excluded, our analysis reveals no unambiguous evidence for such
effects within experimental uncertainty. The refined magnetic structures
exhibit topologically nontrivial winding patterns, derived from the fitted
magnetic parameters, that support localized, particle-like spin textures with
half-integer topological charges. These features provide a natural microscopic
origin for the observed topological Hall effect, establishing CeAlGe as a model
system where magnetism and topology are intimately linked.

### Stochastic restarting with multiple restart conditions

We consider the mean first passage time (MFPT) for a diffusive particle in a
potential landscape with the extra condition that the particle is reset to its
original position with some rate r. We study non-smooth and non-convex
potentials and focus on the case where the restart rate depends on the space
coordinate. There, we show that it is beneficial to restart at a lower rate
once you are closer to your intended target.

### Large Chern-Number Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect from Canted Antiferromagnetic Order in $d$-Electron System on Kagome Lattice

Electrons of $d$-symmetry in a kagome lattice are considered which interact
with non-collinear antiferromagnetic order in the absence of spin-orbit
coupling. The non-collinearity of spin texture gives rise to non-relativistic
spin splitting and the associated intrinsic Berry curvature. The integral of
the latter over the Brillouin zone becomes nontrivial for non-coplanar (canted)
non-collinear spin order even without explicit on-site or transfer spin-orbit
coupling. That gives rise to a nonzero (scalar) spin chirality, and a record
value for the Chern number of $C=\pm 5$ can appear when the Fermi level is in
an appropriate gap for isotropic electron hopping integrals, or nearly
isotropic ones. The numerical results for this topological quantum anomalous
Hall effect are supported by an analytical formula. It is possible to split the
$C=\pm 5$ plateau into different possible nonzero values for the Chern number
by varying the onsite energies. The topological phase transitions between Hall
plateaus can be driven by flipping the Zeeman-like exchange field or
controlling the onsite energies, alluding to the potential of this system to
quantum information.

### Excited states in auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo

We systematically investigate the calculation of excited states in quantum
chemistry using auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC). Symmetry allows
targeting of the lowest triplet excited states in AFQMC based on restricted
open-shell determinants, effectively as a ground-state calculation. For
open-shell singlet states, excited state calculations can be stabilized with
the appropriate trial states, but their quality can have a larger effect on the
accuracy in AFQMC. We find that active space-based configuration interaction
trial states are often not sufficient to obtain accurate results. We instead
use truncated equation of motion coupled cluster with single and double
excitations (EOM-CCSD) as trial states. We benchmark the performance of these
calculations on a set of small and medium molecules and polyacenes, focusing on
predominantly single excitations. We find that the AFQMC results, obtained at a
per-sample cost scaling of $O(N^6)$, are systematically more accurate than
those obtained using EOM-CCSD, reducing excitation energy errors by
approximately half for open-shell singlets. In regimes where EOM-CC triples are
impractical, these results position AFQMC as a scalable, higher-accuracy
complement for low-lying excited states.

Molecular dynamics simulations using a Gaussian Approximation Potential (GAP)
reveal a stress triaxiality driven, two-step Si-I (diamond cubic) to Si-V
(simple hexagonal) phase transition pathway in a spherical Si nanoparticle with
a 10 nm diameter under triaxial compression. A transient amorphous phase first
forms at the surface and propagates inward around Si-I core, where stress
triaxiality is low (shear-dominated). Within the amorphous shell, the material
recrystallizes into Si-V at locations of elevated stress triaxiality and
hydrostatic pressure. The resulting Si-V structure transforms into a fully
amorphous state upon unloading. A subsequent loading-unloading cycle applied to
this amorphous nanoparticle reveals a reversible amorphous to Si-V
transformation, demonstrating a nanoscale phase memory effect.

### A shortcut through the macroscopic fluctuation theory: a generalised Fick law

- **TL;DR**: 本文证明了宏观涨落理论中一个简化计算累积量生成函数的公式，并将其推广到更一般的可观测量，应用于对称排斥过程和扩散系统。

The macroscopic fluctuation theory is a powerful tool to characterise the
large scale dynamical properties of diffusive systems, both in- and
out-of-equilibrium. It relies on an action formalism in which, at large scales,
the dynamics is fully determined by the minimum of the action. Within this
formalism, the analysis of the statistical properties of a given observable
reduces to solving the Euler-Lagrange equations with the appropriate boundary
conditions. One must then compute the action at its minimum to deduce the
cumulant generating function of the observable. This typically involves
computing multiple integrals of cumbersome expressions. Recently, a simple
formula has been conjectured to shortcut this last step, and compute the
cumulant generating function of different observables (integrated current or
position of a tracer) without the need to compute any integral. In this work,
we prove this simple formula, and extend it to more general observables. We
then illustrate the efficiency of this approach by applying it to compute the
variance of a generalised current in the semi-infinite symmetric exclusion
process and the joint properties of two occupation times in any diffusive
system. In the case of the integrated current, our formula can be interpreted
as a generalisation of Fick's law to obtain all the cumulants of the current
beyond the average value.

- **TL;DR**: 机器学习框架准确预测铂纳米颗粒的电化学氧还原反应质量活性，结合贝叶斯优化从5万多种结构中高效筛选出Top-10和Top-100最活跃结构

Establishing a mapping between nanocatalysts structure and their catalytic
properties is essential for efficient design. To this end, we demonstrate the
accuracy of a general machine learning framework on a representative and
challenging application: predicting the mass activity of Pt nanoparticles for
the electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction, estimated via a microkinetic
model. Accurate models are obtained when leveraging either a nanocatalyst's
structure representation accessible at the computational level, namely the
surface site generalized coordination number distributions, or one accessible
experimentally, namely the nanoparticle's pair distance distribution function.
Building on this result, we demonstrate that our machine learning model, in
tandem with Bayesian optimization, efficiently identifies the Top-10 and
Top-100 most active structures out of a large pool of candidates comprising
more than 50000 different structures, after probing the activity only of a few
thousand structures. These findings provide a robust blueprint for accelerated
theoretical and experimental identification of active nanocatalysts.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文提出了一种结合机器学习势能面与分布式电荷模型的新方法，用于精确描述纯液体和异质系统的分子间相互作用能量，在多个系统中实现了接近化学精度的结果。

Energy functions for pure and heterogenous systems are one of the backbones
for molecular simulation of condensed phase systems. With the advent of machine
learned potential energy surfaces (ML-PESs) a new era has started. Statistical
models allow the representation of reference data from electronic structure
calculations for chemical systems of almost arbitrary complexity at
unprecedented detail and accuracy. Here, kernel- and neural network-based
approaches for intramolecular degrees of freedom are combined with distributed
charge models for long range electrostatics to describe the interaction
energies of condensed phase systems. The main focus is on illustrative examples
ranging from pure liquids (dichloromethane, water) to chemically and
structurally heterogeneous systems (eutectic liquids, CO on amorphous solid
water), reactions (Menshutkin), and spectroscopy (triatomic probes for protein
dynamics). For all examples, small to medium-sized clusters are used to
represent and improve the total interaction energy compared with reference
quantum chemical calculations. Although remarkable accuracy can be achieved for
some systems (chemical accuracy for dichloromethane and water), it is clear
that more realistic models are required for van der Waals contributions and
improved water models need to be used for more quantitative simulations of
heterogeneous chemical and biological systems.

### Synergetic Enhancement of Power Factors and Suppression of Lattice Thermal Conductivities via Biaxial Strain in ScAgSe$_2$ and TmAgTe$_2$

- **TL;DR**: 通过施加双轴拉伸应变，在ScAgSe2和TmAgTe2银硫族化合物中实现了热电性能的显著提升，功率因子增加243-246%，晶格热导率降低26-37%，ZT值提高2-4倍。

The challenge of achieving high thermoelectric (TE) performance is mainly
from the entanglement among Seebeck coefficient ($S$), electrical conductivity
($\sigma$), and lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_{\mathrm{L}}$). In this
work, we propose a synergetic strategy of enhancing power factor (PF,
$S^2\sigma$) and suppressing $\kappa_{\mathrm{L}}$ by applying a biaxial
tensile strain in two silver chalcogenides ScAgSe$_2$ and TmAgTe$_2$ with
TlCdS$_2$-type structure. The forbidden $p$-$d$ orbital coupling at the
$\Gamma$ point and allowed $p$-$d$ orbital coupling at the A point and the
middle of $\Lambda$ line leads to high electronic band dispersion along the
$\Gamma$-A direction and a high-degeneracy valence band valley ($\Lambda_2$).
The elongation of the Ag-Se bond under tensile strain weakens the orbital
coupling between Ag-$d$ and Se/Te-$p$ orbitals and reduces the band energy at
the A point, which aligns the valence band and achieving a high band
degeneracy. Concurrently, the weaker Ag-Se/Ag-Te bond under a small tensile
strain leads to lower phonon group velocity and strong three- and four phonon
scatterings, leading to lower $\kappa_{\mathrm{L}}$. Our first-principles
calculations combined with electron-phonon coupling analysis as well as phonon
and electron Boltzmann transport equations show that applying a 3\% (2\%)
tensile strain can enhance the PF along the $c$-axis of ScAgSe$_2$ (TmAgTe$_2$)
by 243\% (246\%) at a carrier concentration of 3$\times$10$^{20}$ cm$^{-3}$ and
reduce the $\kappa_{\mathrm{L}}$ by 37\% (26\%) at 300 K. Consequently, 2
$\sim$ 4 times of $ZT$ enhancement is obtained by 3\% or 1\% tensile strain in
ScAgSe$_2$ (TmAgTe$_2$) at 300 K, achieving a maximum $ZT$ of 3.10 (3.62) at
800 K. Our material design strategy based on molecular orbital analysis reveals
an effective route to boosting TE performance, and can be extended to other
systems as well.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究通过比较含Ni和不含Ni的铁磁异质结构，发现Ni并没有表现出显著的spin pumping或orbital pumping效应，对Ni基异质结构中角动量转移的传统理解提出了挑战。

Excited ferromagnets can pump spin angular momentum, along with possibly
orbital angular momentum. Among elemental ferromagnets, Ni has been proposed to
exhibit substantial orbital pumping relative to spin pumping. Here, we search
for a signature of orbital pumping by Ni, specifically by comparing
out-of-plane ferromagnetic resonance in heterostructures without Ni (FeV/Nb)
and with Ni (FeV-Ni/Nb). The FeV/Nb series shows a clear increase in Gilbert
damping with the Nb sink thickness, attributed to spin pumping from FeV to Nb.
Surprisingly, the FeV-Ni/Nb series exhibits no such damping increase, revealing
no significant spin or orbital pumping from Ni to Nb. Our results offer a fresh
perspective on angular-momentum transfer in Ni-based heterostructures,
suggesting that the interpretation of some strong orbitronic effects may
require further consideration.

Chemical reaction optimisation is essential for synthetic chemistry and
pharmaceutical development, demanding the extensive exploration of many
reaction parameters to achieve efficient and sustainable processes. We report
$\alpha$-PSO, a novel nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithm that augments
canonical particle swarm optimisation (PSO) with machine learning (ML) for
parallel reaction optimisation. Unlike black-box ML approaches that obscure
decision-making processes, $\alpha$-PSO uses mechanistically clear optimisation
strategies through simple, physically intuitive swarm dynamics directly
connected to experimental observables, enabling practitioners to understand the
components driving each optimisation decision. We establish a theoretical
framework for reaction landscape analysis using local Lipschitz constants to
quantify reaction space "roughness", distinguishing between smoothly varying
landscapes with predictable surfaces and rough landscapes with many reactivity
cliffs. This analysis guides adaptive $\alpha$-PSO parameter selection,
optimising performance for different reaction topologies. Systematic evaluation
of $\alpha$-PSO across pharmaceutically relevant reaction benchmarks
demonstrates competitive performance with state-of-the-art Bayesian
optimisation methods, while two prospective high-throughput experimentation
(HTE) campaigns showed that $\alpha$-PSO identified optimal reaction conditions
more rapidly than Bayesian optimisation. $\alpha$-PSO combines the predictive
capability of advanced black-box ML methods with interpretable metaheuristic
procedures, offering chemists an effective framework for parallel reaction
optimisation that maintains methodological clarity while achieving highly
performant experimental outcomes. Alongside our open-source $\alpha$-PSO
implementation, we release $989$ new high-quality Pd-catalysed Buchwald-Hartwig
and Suzuki reactions.

Dislocations in perovskite oxides have drawn increasing research interest due
to their potential of tuning functional properties of electroceramics. Open
questions remain regarding the behavior of dislocations concerning their
stability under strong externally applied electric fields. In this study, we
investigate the dielectric breakdown strength of nominally undoped SrTiO3
crystals after the introduction of high-density dislocations. The
dislocation-rich samples are prepared using the Brinell scratching method, and
they consistently exhibit lower dielectric breakdown strength as well as a
larger scatter in the breakdown probability. We also study the impact of
electric field on the introduction and movement of dislocations in SrTiO3
crystals using Brinell indentation coupled with an electric field of 2 kV/mm.
No changes on the dislocation plastic zone size, depth, and dislocation
distribution are observed under this electric field. Based on the charge state
of the dislocations in SrTiO3 as well as the electrical and thermal
conductivity modified by dislocations, we discuss the forces induced by the
electric field to act on the dislocations to underline the possible mechanisms
for such dislocation behavior.

We propose an experimental methodology for probing the energy barrier
inhomogeneity at the metal/semiconductor interface without the need for
time-consuming microscopic survey. It is based on the known statistical nature
of the interfacial energy barrier and the use of planar tunnel junction as an
array of parallelly-connected ballistic electron emission microscopy (BEEM)
tips. In order to analyze a lump of local BEEM signals, we incorporate the Tung
model into the Bell-Kaiser theory. To validate our theoretical strategies, we
investigate the interfacial energy barrier inhomogeneity of Pt/4H-SiC(0001)
junction as a model system.

- **TL;DR**: DFT+U计算弹性常数时存在多个自洽电子解（亚稳态），如果应变构型与平衡态处于不同电子极小值，会导致弹性常数计算错误。本文提出了保持相同Hubbard占据分支的"绝热"计算方法，并在UO₂晶体中验证了该方法。

Since in DFT+U there are multiple self-consistent electronic solutions, the
so called metastable states, the elastic constants computed from
stress-vs-strain will be incorrect if some of the strained configurations fall
into a different local electronic minimum than the equilibrium non-strained
state. So, it is crucial to carefully take steps to keep the same electronic
Hubbard occupation branch when computing the stresses for small strained
geometries. In this work, we have explained this "adiabatic" method of
calculation for elastic constants and applied for UO$_2$ crystal described
within two different unit cells of cubic 12-atom and tetragonal 6-atom basis
sets. The calculation results for the two different unit cells are the same
within 0.1 GPa, and agreement with experiment is excellent.

### Topological excitonic insulators in electron bilayers modulated by twisted hBN

Equilibrium interlayer exciton condensation is common in bilayer quantum Hall
systems and is characterized by spontaneous phase coherence between isolated
layers. It has been predicted that similar physics can occur in the absence of
a magnetic field in some two-dimensional semiconductor bilayers. In this work
we consider the case of two transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers
separated by a twisted hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) bilayer or multilayer. The
hBN layers suppress tunneling between the TMD layers so that phase coherence is
spontaneous when it is present. When twisted, the hBN layers also form a
ferroelectric moir\'e pattern that applies opposite triangular-lattice
modulation potentials to the two TMD layers. We show via mean-field theory that
at total hole filling per moir\'e unit cell $\nu=1$, this geometry can favor a
chiral p-wave exciton condensate state in which the quantum anomalous Hall
effect coexists with counter-flow superfluidity. We present a mean-field phase
diagram for TMD hole bilayers modulated by twisted hBN, discuss the conditions
needed for the realization of the p-wave condensate state, and propose
experiments that could confirm its presence.

Impurities and intrinsic point defects, which profoundly influence spin,
charge, and topological degrees of freedom, are crucial parameters for tuning
quantum states in quantum materials. The magnetic Weyl semimetal Co3Sn2S2 with
its strong spin-orbit coupling, intrinsic ferromagnetism, and kagome lattice of
correlated electrons, provides a compelling platform for studying impurity
excited states. Yet, the role of intrinsic impurities in shaping its quantum
states remains elusive. Here, we uncover intrinsic quantum clusters-localized
intrinsic point defects that act as tunable quantum perturbations capable of
reshaping electronic states and order parameters, on the surface of Co3Sn2S2
via scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy and non contact atomic force
microscopy, combined with scanning transmission electron microscopy/electron
energy loss spectroscopy. These clusters are identified as native oxygen
defects that dominate the intrinsic defect landscape on both cleaved surface
terminations. On the Sn-terminated surface, oxygen impurities occupy hollow
sites between three Sn atoms, and tune the flat band near the Fermi level,
which exhibits orbital magnetism induced unconventional Zeeman effect under an
applied magnetic field. On the S-terminated surface, oxygen interstitials
reside slightly off center relative to the S lattice and generate occupied
impurity states that retain sixfold symmetry at higher energies but reduce to
C2 symmetry at lower energies. In contrast, these impurity states show no
measurable magnetic response. Our findings establish that intrinsic
oxygen-related quantum clusters act as tunable local perturbations in a
topological kagome magnet, offering a versatile platform to probe and engineer
impurity-driven phenomena in correlated and topological systems.

We show that characteristics of the electron's form factor in two-dimensional
materials are observable in quasiparticle interference (QPI) spectrum. We study
QPI in twisted bilayer graphene using real-space tight-binding calculations
combined with the kernel polynomial method, which agrees excellently with the
form factor norm obtained from the continuum Hamiltonian. The QPI signals,
displaying a chiral structure, reveal all distinct interference processes
between states near the Dirac points. We propose pseudospin textures of twisted
bilayer graphene to explain all the interference mechanisms. Our results
provide microscopic insights into electronic eigenstates of twisted bilayer
graphene and suggest QPI as a potential method for probing the form factor,
which governs the material's quantum geometry and many-body states.

Medium-entropy alloys (MEAs) such as CoCrFeNi and CoCrNi are promising
structural materials owing to their outstanding mechanical and thermal
properties, which arise from complex chemical disorder and atomic-scale
interactions. Although density functional theory (DFT) has provided fundamental
insights into these systems, its high computational cost limits exploration of
large-scale phenomena. Classical interatomic potentials have been used to
address this gap but often lack the fidelity needed to capture many-body
interactions and chemical short-range ordering (CSRO) effects. In this work, we
developed a machine-learned Moment Tensor Potential (MTP) to bridge accuracy
and efficiency. The MTP was trained on a comprehensive DFT database spanning
unary to quaternary configurations and reproduces energies, forces, and
stresses with near-DFT accuracy across diverse structural and chemical
environments. It accurately predicts elastic properties and recovers
compositional trends in bulk and shear moduli in agreement with DFT. Hybrid
Monte Carlo/molecular dynamics simulations capture CSRO, reproducing key
DFT-reported features including Cr-Cr and Fe-Fe repulsion and Ni-Cr ordering.
Stacking fault energetics were modeled, yielding ISF energies near 54 mJ/m2 for
CoCrNi and 36 mJ/m2 for CoCrFeNi, consistent with DFT predictions. Local
chemical environment effects on stacking faults were also resolved: Co-rich
planes reduce, whereas Cr- or Fe-rich planes increase, the stacking fault
energy. By enabling large-scale, high-fidelity simulations at a fraction of
DFT's cost, the developed MTP provides a robust framework for predictive
modeling of thermodynamic stability, defect behavior, and mechanical response
of FCC MEAs.

The present work comprehensively reviews electron hydrodynamics in graphene,
highlighting both experimental observations and theoretical developments. Key
experimental signatures such as negative vicinity resistance, Poiseuille flow,
and significant violation of the Wiedemann-Franz (WF) law have been discussed,

Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) using 2D nanomaterials has
emerged as a sophisticated approach to mitigate industrial CO2 emissions. In
this work, the potential application of pristine as well as strategically Fe,
Co, Ni-doped 2D AlSb was examined as a CO2RR electrocatalyst. The recation
pathways of CO2RR intermediate complexes, overpotential, stability, efficiency,
and selectivity were studied using density functional theory (DFT). Outstanding
overpotentials were achieved with pristine and doped 2D AlSb: Ni-doped 2D AlSb
was selective for HCOOH (0.12eV) and CH4 (0.28eV), and Fe-doped 2D AlSb for
HCHO (0.31eV) and CH3OH (0.31eV). The opposing effects of hydrogen evolution
reaction (HER) was mitigated with the application of electric potential and
solution pH. The main reasons for the enhancement of catalytic effect due to
doping with Fe, Co, and Ni are bandgap reduction and creation of states at the
edge of the valence band due to the 3d orbitals of these dopants.
Interestingly, the Fe-doped 2D AlSb catalyst exhibited the highest catalytic
activity. Excellent electrocatalytic properties of pristine and doped 2D AlSb
make them suitable as CO2RR catalysts contributing towards a green and
sustainable energy ecosystem.

Altermagnetic properties have been recently proposed in polar magnetic
oxides, M$_{2}$Mo$_{3}$O$_{8}$ (M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni), where improved
characteristics of stronger magnetoelectric coupling and higher magnetic
transition temperatures were observed. Thus, understanding their microscopic
origins is of fundamental and technological importance. However, the difficulty
in growing large single crystals hinders detailed experimental studies. Here,
we report the successful growth of large single crystals of the pyroelectric
antiferromagnet using two representative compounds, Fe$_{2}$Mo$_{3}$O$_{8}$ and
NiZnMo$_{3}$O$_{8}$. Growth was optimized using various parameters, finding the
transport agent density as a primary factor, which depends strongly on the
position of the pellet, the starting powder form, and the volume of the ampule.
We demonstrated a controlled growth method by manipulating the convection and
diffusion kinetics. High-quality crystals were characterized by using
single-crystal X-ray diffraction, Laue diffraction, magnetic susceptibility,
and Raman spectroscopy. Manipulation of magnetic properties through nonmagnetic
Zn doping was shown in NiZnMo$_{3}$O$_{8}$. Our results enable the detailed
investigation and manipulation of their unconventional altermagnetic and
multiferroic properties. This study provides crucial insight into the
controlled growth of other functional quantum materials.

Quantum Hall systems host quasiparticles demonstrating correlated electron
physics and non-trivial quantum statistics. Excitonic phases, archetypical for
interaction effect, have attracted significant interest in recent years in
double-layer quantum Hall systems where spatially separated electrons and holes
form bosonic condensate through Coulomb interaction. Here, employing the
approach of quantum Hall antidot with two spatially separated edge channels, we
demonstrate a new type of quantum Hall quasiparticle exciton which represents a
quantum-coherent bound state of an electron and a hole situated on their
corresponding edges coupled through intralayer tunneling and Coulomb
interaction. Quantum-coherent dynamics of the exciton is reflected in the
observed evolution of the position and magnitude of the antidot conductance
peaks around the electron-hole resonance. The quantum Hall antidot setup allows
localization and electrical tuning of individual quantum Hall excitons. Quantum
superposition of vacuum- and electron-hole pairing states is observed through
the gate-dependent tunneling conductance of the antidot. Modeling the
electron-hole pair as a coupled two-level system, semi-quantitative
understanding of experimental observations is achieved. This work opens avenues
for creating quantum systems of multiple quantum Hall quasiparticles.

Silicon-based MAX phases are a promising class of layered ceramics with
superior thermal and chemical stability. However, their synthesis remains
challenging due to inherent thermodynamic instability at high temperatures.
Herein, we develop a general top-down strategy to synthesize a broad family of
Si-substituted MAX phases (M = Ti, V, Nb, Ta, Cr; X = C, N) by reacting
Al-based MAX precursors with SiCl4 vapor. This approach not only circumvents
traditional high-temperature limitations but also enables precise A-site defect
engineering, resulting in phases with controlled vacancy concentrations (e.g.,
Nb2Si3/4C and Nb2Si1/2C). Furthermore, we introduce a redox potential-based
model that rationalizes the reaction pathway. Using Tin+1AlXn etched with SiCl4
as an example, the process simultaneously forms Cl-terminated MXene (Mn+1XnCl2)
and amorphous nano-Si, enabling the one-step synthesis of Si-coated MXene
composites. This methodology provides new avenues for designing advanced MAX
phases and MXene-based hybrids with tailored functionalities for applications
in energy storage and catalysis.

Nanofluidic memristors promise brain-inspired information processing with
ions, yet their microscopic origin remains debated. So far, ionic memory has
been attributed to ion-specific interactions, dynamic wetting, chemical
reactions or mechanical deformations, yet typically without direct evidence.
Here, by combining operando interferometric imaging with electrokinetic
measurements, we directly visualize voltage-induced blistering of the confining
walls of two-dimensional (2D) nanochannels, as key origin of memristive
hysteresis. We identify two distinct classes of blisters: unidirectional,
driven by electrostatic forces on surface charges, and bidirectional, arising
from osmotic pressure due to concentration polarization. This mechanistic
framework explains device evolution and device-to-device variability, and
reframes stochastic blistering as a functional design element. Our results
constitute a direct proof of electromechanical coupling as a robust pathway to
ionic memory in 2D nanochannels and open routes toward high-performance ionic
memristors and electrically actuated nanofluidic valves.

### Geometric Analysis of Magnetic Labyrinthine Stripe Evolution via U-Net Segmentation

- **TL;DR**: 使用深度学习U-Net模型和几何分析流程定量研究Bi:YIG薄膜中迷宫状磁条纹图案的演化，识别出两种与磁场极性相关的演化模式

Labyrinthine stripe patterns are common in many physical systems, yet their
lack of long-range order makes quantitative characterization challenging. We
investigate the evolution of such patterns in bismuth-doped yttrium iron garnet
(Bi:YIG) films subjected to a magnetic field annealing protocol. A U-Net deep
learning model, trained with synthetic degradations including additive white
Gaussian and Simplex noise, enables robust segmentation of experimental
magneto-optical images despite noise and occlusions. Building on this
segmentation, we develop a geometric analysis pipeline based on
skeletonization, graph mapping, and spline fitting, which quantifies local
stripe propagation through length and curvature measurements. Applying this
framework to 444 images from 12 annealing protocol trials, we analyze the
transition from the "quenched" state to a more parallel and coherent "annealed"
state, and identify two distinct evolution modes (Type A and Type B) linked to
field polarity. Our results provide a quantitative analysis of geometric and
topological properties in magnetic stripe patterns and offer new insights into
their local structural evolution, and establish a general tool for analyzing
complex labyrinthine systems.

We present results of comprehensive first-principles and kp-method studies of
electronic, magnetic, and topological properties of graphene on a monolayer of
CrI$_3$. First, we identify a twist angle between the graphene and CrI$_3$,
that positions the graphene Dirac cones within the bandgap of CrI$_3$. Then, we
derive the low-energy effective Hamiltonian describing electronic properties of
graphene Dirac cones. Subsequently, we examine anomalous and valley Hall
conductivity and discuss possible topological phase transition from a quantum
anomalous Hall insulator to a trivial insulating state, concomitant a change in
the magnetic ground state of CrI$_3$. These findings highlight the potential of
strain engineering in two-dimensional van der Waals heterostructures for
controlling topological and magnetic phases.

### Orbital Hybridization-Driven Stabilization and Reactivity on an Asymmetrically Reconstructed Polar CeO2(100) Surface

Understanding and controlling the atomic structure of polar oxide surfaces is
essential for unraveling surface reactivilty and designing advanced catalytic
materials. Among these, the polar CeO2(100) surface is a prototypical and
industrially important system in heterogeneous catalysis. However, due to the
vast complexity of the surface configurations, its reconstruction behavior
remains an open question. Here, we report a previously unidentified asymmetric
(1x2) reconstructed structure on the CeO2(100) surface, discovered through an
integrated approach that combines global structure search algorithms, machine
learning-based atomic potential models, density functional theory (DFT)
calculations, and in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). The
reconstructed surface is both thermodynamically and kinetically stable,
characterized by an alternating arrangement of Ce3+ and Ce4+ ions, increased
interlayer spacing, and reconfigured surface oxygen atoms. Importantly, the
formation of localized Ce3+ polarons introduces occupied 4f states that
strongly hybridize with surface O 2p orbitals, resulting in new occupied
electronic states below the Fermi level. This orbital hybridization activates
the O 2p states, enhances their electron-donating capacity, and facilitates the
dissociation of adsorbed molecules such as H2O. These findings reveal a
fundamental orbital-mediated mechanism by which surface reconstruction governs
electronic structure and reactivity, offering critical insights and a new
design strategy for tuning catalytic performance on polar oxide surfaces.

We present a spin Hall magnetoresistance sensor based on a NiFe/Pt multiring
bridge structure, which exhibits high sensitivity and good linearity in two
perpendicular directions within the sensor plane. Under DC excitation, it
responds linearly to magnetic field perpendicular to the current direction,
whereas AC excitation enables a linear response with near-zero offset to
magnetic field aligned with the current direction, driven by spin-orbit torque
effect. Moreover, the AC excitation effectively mitigates low-frequency 1/f
noise down to sub-microvolt per sqrt(Hz) at 1 Hz. Systematic investigations
have been performed to optimize the NiFe thickness while keeping the Pt
thickness at 2 nm. The biaxial sensing capability offers a promising approach
for multidimensional magnetic field detection in advanced sensing applications.

### Generic continuum model formalism for moiré superlattice systems

The moir\'e superlattice system provides an excellent platform for exploring
various novel quantum phenomena. To theoretically tackle the diverse correlated
and topological states emerging from moir\'e superlattices, one usually adopts
an effective low-energy continuum model based on which the electron-electron
effects are further considered. However, the construction of an accurate
continuum model remains a challenging task, particularly for complex moir\'e
superlattices such as twisted transition metal dichalcogenides. In this work,
we develop a formalism for constructing generic continuum models that are in
principle applicable for arbitrary moir\'e superlattices and are extrapolatable
to any twist angles. Our key insight is that the microscopic electronic
properties are intrinsic properties of the system, which should remain
invariant across all twist angles; the lattice relaxations act as external
inputs that vary with twist angles and are coupled with the electrons, and the
coupling coefficients are characterized by intrinsic parameters. This partition
enables a universal description of the angle variation of the continuum model
using a single set of model parameters. To extract the model parameters, we
design a numerical workflow based on data from first principles density
functional theory calculations. We apply this framework to twisted bilayer
MoTe$_{2}$, and obtain a single set of model parameters that accurately
reproduce first-principles results, including electronic band structures,
charge density distributions and Chern numbers, at three different twist
angles. Furthermore, the model extrapolates robustly to smaller twist angles.
Our work not only provides a more precise understanding of the microscopic
properties of moir\'e superlattices, but also lays a foundation for future
theoretical studies of low-energy electronic properties in generic moir\'e
superlattice systems.

Machine learning (ML) has become a commonplace approach in the development of
interatomic potentials for molecular dynamics simulations, and its use also for
radiation effect modelling is increasing. In this work, we investigate the
effects of training ML potentials to density functional theory data calculated
with different pseudopotentials in nickel. We look in detail at the differences
that appear in radiation damage simulations. The use of a "harder"
pseudopotential with semicore electrons has a direct impact on the short-range
interactions, which in turn has implications on the radiation damage
simulations. We find that despite these differences, the average threshold
displacement energy is quite similar (40-50 eV for Ni). However, we find
significant differences in the cumulative damage predicted by massively
overlapping cascade simulations and compare them with Rutherford Backscattering
Spectroscopy/channeling experiments. We also investigate approaches to modify
the repulsive pair interactions after training the potentials and discuss the
feasibility of such approaches.

### Non-Hermitian quantum geometric tensor and nonlinear electrical response

- **TL;DR**: 非厄米量子几何张量控制具有谱线间隙系统的非线性电响应，量子度规产生与散射时间无关的本征非线性电导，复贝里曲率导致波包宽度依赖的响应。

We demonstrate that the non-Hermitian quantum geometric tensor (QGT) governs
nonlinear electrical responses in systems with a spectral line gap. The quantum
metric, which is a component of the QGT and takes complex values in
non-Hermitian systems, generates an intrinsic nonlinear conductivity
independent of the scattering time, while the complex Berry curvature induces a
wavepacket-width-dependent response. Using one-dimensional and two-dimensional
non-Hermitian models, we establish a universal link between nonlinear dynamics
and the QGT, thereby connecting quantum state geometry to observable transport
phenomena. Crucially, our analysis indicates that the wavepacket width
significantly affects non-Hermitian transport -- a feature absent in Hermitian
systems. This framework unifies non-Hermitian response theory by revealing how
geometric degrees of freedom encode transport in open and synthetic quantum
matter. Our results bridge fundamental quantum geometry with emergent
functionality, offering pathways to exploit geometric effects in topological
devices and engineered materials.

Copolymers are highly versatile materials with a vast range of possible
chemical compositions. By using computational methods for property prediction,
the design of copolymers can be accelerated, allowing for the prioritization of
candidates with favorable properties. In this study, we utilized two distinct
representations of molecular ensembles to predict the seven different physical
polymer properties copolymers using machine learning: we used a random forest
(RF) model to predict polymer properties from molecular descriptors, and a
graph neural network (GNN) to predict the same properties from 2D polymer
graphs under both a single- and multi-task setting. To train and evaluate the
models, we constructed a data set from molecular dynamic simulations for 140
binary copolymers with varying monomer compositions and configurations. Our
results demonstrate that descriptors-based RFs excel at predicting density and
specific heat capacities at constant pressure (Cp) and volume (Cv) because
these properties are strongly tied to specific molecular features captured by
molecular descriptors. In contrast, graph representations better predict
expansion coefficients ({\gamma}, {\alpha}) and bulk modulus (K), which depend
more on complex structural interactions better captured by graph-based models.
This study underscores the importance of choosing appropriate representations
for predicting molecular properties. Our findings demonstrate how machine
learning models can expedite copolymer discovery with learnable
structure-property relationships, streamlining polymer design and advancing the
development of high-performance materials for diverse applications.

High-fidelity detection of charge transitions in quantum dots (QDs) is a key
ingredient in solid state quantum computation. We demonstrate high-bandwidth
radio-frequency charge detection in bilayer graphene quantum dots (QDs) using a
capacitively coupled quantum point contact (QPC). The device design suppresses
screening effects and enables sensitive QPC-based charge readout. The QPC is
arranged to maximize the readout contrast between two neighboring, coupled
electron and hole QDs. We apply the readout scheme to a single-particle
electron-hole double QD and demonstrate time-resolved detection of charge
states as well as magnetic field dependent tunneling rates. This promises a
high-fidelity readout scheme for individual spin and valley states, which is
important for the operation of spin, valley or spin-valley qubits in bilayer

Two-dimensional (2D) materials may host circular phonons, considered as
chiral if the presence of a substrate breaks mirror symmetry. In 2D transition
metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) monolayers lacking inversion symmetry, phonons with
a given chirality can be observed in the non-equilibrium state triggered by
optical excitations using circularly polarized light. Backed by
first-principles calculations, we present the antiferromagnetic semiconductor
MnPS$_3$ with a hexagonal crystal structure and bandstructure similar to TMDCs,
but a larger unit cell, as a novel candidate material that may allow for
excitation of circular phonons. Using DFT+U and the finite displacement method
we obtain in-plane chiral phonon modes at the valley points of a monolayer
MnPS$_3$. These modes can be classified according to the Mn or S atoms
performing circular motions about their equilibrium positions. In each case,
the quantized angular momentum of the phonons is calculated. Moreover, we point
out ways to populate the chiral phonons selectively via optical excitation with
circularly polarized light.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种非对称纳米收缩结构的自旋霍尔纳米振荡器设计，通过微磁模拟研究了两个此类器件的相互同步，展示了仅通过偶极杂散场实现的无电耦合同步。

We propose an asymmetric-nanoconstriction (ANC) design of spin-Hall
nano-oscillators (SHNOs) and investigate mutual synchronization of a pair of
such devices using micromagnetic simulations. The ANC geometry enables strong
dipolar coupling at sub-50 nm separations while preserving independent current
bias for each oscillator. We first characterize the auto-oscillation of a
single ANC-SHNO, revealing a broad frequency tuning range and a
field-controlled crossover between negative and positive nonlinearities. We
then demonstrate that two such oscillators can mutually synchronize solely via
dipolar stray fields, without electrical or spin-wave coupling. Depending on
the bias conditions, the coupled pair exhibits robust in-phase (0{\deg}) or
out-of-phase (180{\deg}) locking. Notably, we find a bias-dependent amplitude
correlation: when the oscillators sustain comparable amplitudes, both in-phase
and out-of-phase synchronization are accessible, whereas amplitude imbalance
drives the system into an out-of-phase state accompanied by suppression of the
weaker oscillator. By combining strong conservative coupling with independent
frequency and gain control, the ANC-SHNO platform provides a scalable route
toward phased oscillator arrays, neuromorphic computing architectures, and
experimental exploration of non-Hermitian spintronic dynamics.

With advances in informatics applied to materials science, predicting the
physical properties of numerous materials has become increasingly feasible,
creating a growing demand for their experimental validation. It has been
expected that the integration of robotic systems into experimental materials
science excels at efficiently performing repetitive and time-consuming tasks
without the need for human intervention, thus significantly increasing
throughput and reducing the risk of human error, while there have been a
limited number of reports tackled the synthesis process of solid bulk material
so far possibly because of the complex as well as a wide variety of processes
to deal with. In this paper, we report an automated arc melting system
controlled by a robot operating system2 (ROS2). Taking advantage of ROS2, we
have constructed a machine that can handle multiple experimental apparatuses
simultaneously with flexibility for future expansion of functions. The
constructed machine is capable of not only performing repeated operation of a
specific process but also dealing with multiple elements for synthesis of
intermetallic compounds. The system is expected to accelerate experimental
validation of data-driven materials exploration.

Many-body interactions strongly influence the structure, stability, and
dynamics of condensed-matter systems, from atomic lattices to interacting
quasi-particles such as superconducting vortices. Here, we investigate
theoretically the pairwise and many-body interaction terms among skyrmions in
helimagnets, considering both the ferromagnetic and conical spin backgrounds.
Using micromagnetic simulations, we separate the exchange,
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya, and Zeeman contributions to the skyrmion-skyrmion pair
potential, and show that the binding energy of skyrmions within the conical
phase depends strongly on the film thickness. For small skyrmion clusters in
the conical phase, three-body interactions make a substantial contribution to
the cohesive energy, comparable to that of pairwise terms, while four-body
terms become relevant only at small magnetic fields. As the system approaches
the ferromagnetic phase, these higher-order contributions vanish, and the
interactions become essentially pairwise. Our results indicate that realistic
models of skyrmion interactions in helimagnets in the conical phase must
incorporate many-body terms to accurately capture the behavior of skyrmion
crystals and guide strategies for controlling skyrmion phases and dynamics.

### Tuning the Magnetic Anisotropy Energy of MoS$_2$-supported Mn$_{12}$ complexes by Electric Field: A First-Principles Study

In this work, we examine low-energy adsorption configurations of four
dodecanuclear manganese single-molecule magnets
[Mn$_{12}$O$_{12}$(O$_2$CR)$_{16}$(H$_2$O)$_4$] (Mn$_{12}$), where the ligand R
being H, CH$_3$, CHCl$_2$ or C$_6$H$_5$, on a molybdenum disulfide (MoS$_2$)
monolayer using force field and density functional theory calculations. The van
der Waals interaction is shown to be crucial for determining the adsorption
energy. Some electrons transfer from the substrate to the molecules upon
surface adsorption, resulting in a reduction of the magnetic anisotropy energy
of Mn$_{12}$. Since the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of Mn$_{12}$ is
close to the valence band of MoS$_2$, a negative electric field is more
effective in modulating charge transfer and energy band alignment, and thus
altering the magnetic anisotropy energy, compared with a positive electric
field. A significant increase in the magnetic anisotropy energy of Mn$_{12}$
with the ligand R=CHCl$_2$ or R=C$_6$H$_5$ under a sufficiently high electric
field has been predicted. Our calculations show that the molecules remain
intact on the surface both before and after the electric field is applied.
Finally, a two-level system formed by different adsorption configurations is
evaluated, and the tunability of its energy barrier under an electric field is
demonstrated. Our study sheds light on tuning the properties of single-molecule
magnets using an electric field, when the molecules are supported on a surface.

### Detective quantum efficiency based comparison of HRTEM and ptychography phase imaging

- **TL;DR**: 本文比较了电子叠层衍射成像(ptychography)和HRTEM在低剂量条件下的成像效率，通过引入侦探量子效率(DQE)作为评估标准，发现ptychography虽然无法达到理想Zernike相位显微镜的效率，但对部分相干性更鲁棒。

High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) is an important
method for imaging beam sensitive materials often under cryo conditions.
Electron ptychography in the scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM)
has been shown to reconstruct low-noise phase data at a reduced fluence for
such materials. This raises the question of whether ptychography or HRTEM
provides a more fluence-efficient imaging technique. Even though the transfer
function is a common metric for evaluating the performance of an imaging
method, it only describes the signal transfer with respect to spatial
frequency, irrespective of the noise transfer. It can also not well defined for
methods, such as ptychography, that use an algorithm to form the final image.
Here we apply the concept of detective quantum efficiency (DQE) to electron
microscopy as a fluence independent and sample independent measure of technique
performance. We find that, for a weak-phase object, ptychography can never
reach the efficiency of a perfect Zernike phase imaging microscope but that
ptychography is more robust to partial coherence.
