- **TL;DR**: 本文提出了一种新的点群序参数(PGOPs)，用于连续量化点群对称性，弥补了传统键取向序参数无法直接量化对称性的不足，并开发了开源工具SPATULA。

Crystals and other condensed phases are defined primarily by their inherent
symmetries, which play a crucial role in dictating their structural properties.
In crystallization studies, local order parameters (OPs) that describe bond
orientational order are widely employed to investigate crystal formation.
Despite their utility, these traditional metrics do not directly quantify
symmetry, an important aspect for understanding the development of order during
crystallization. To address this gap, we introduce a new set of OPs, called
Point Group Order Parameters (PGOPs), designed to continuously quantify point
group symmetry order. We demonstrate the strength and utility of PGOP in
detecting order across different crystalline systems and compare its
performance to commonly used bond-orientational order metrics. PGOP
calculations for all non-infinite point groups are implemented in the
open-source package SPATULA (Symmetry Pattern Analysis Toolkit for
Understanding Local Arrangements), written in parallelized C++ with a Python
interface. The code is publicly available on GitHub.

- **TL;DR**: 本文系统比较了分子动力学模拟中不同恒温方法的性能，包括Nosé-Hoover链、Bussi速度重标定和多种Langevin方法，发现不同恒温器在温度控制、势能采样和计算成本方面存在显著差异。

A systematic comparison was carried out to assess the influence of
representative thermostat methods in constant-temperature molecular dynamics
simulations. The thermostat schemes considered include the Nos\'e--Hoover
thermostat and its chain generalisation, the Bussi velocity rescaling method,
and several implementations of the Langevin dynamics. Using a binary
Lennard-Jones liquid as a model glass former, we investigated how the sampling
of physical observables, such as particle velocities and potential energy,
responds to changes in time step across these thermostats. While the
Nos\'e--Hoover chain and Bussi thermostats provide reliable temperature
control, a pronounced time-step dependence was observed in the potential
energy. Amongst the Langevin methods, the Gr{\o}nbech-Jensen--Farago scheme
provided the most consistent sampling of both temperature and potential energy.
Nonetheless, Langevin dynamics typically incurs approximately twice the
computational cost due to the overhead of random number generation, and
exhibits a systematic decrease in diffusion coefficients with increasing
friction. This study presents a broad comparison of thermostat methods using a
binary Lennard-Jones glass-former model, offering practical guidance for the
choice of thermostats in classical molecular dynamics simulations. These
findings provide useful insights for diverse applications, including glass
transition, phase separation, and nucleation.

### Weak Generative Sampler for Stationary Distributions of McKean-Vlasov System

- **Authors**: Zhiqiang Cai, Chengyu Liu, Xiang Zhou
- **Categories**: physics.comp-ph
- **TL;DR**: 本文提出了一种基于弱生成采样器（WGS）框架的方法，使用归一化流和非线性Fokker-Planck方程的弱形式来计算和生成满足McKean-Vlasov过程平稳分布的独立同分布样本，解决了有限粒子截断模拟方法在捕获相变时失效的问题。

Stochastic interacting particle systems are widely used to model collective
phenomena across diverse fields, including statistical physics, biology, and
social dynamics. The McKean-Vlasov equation arises as the mean-field limit of
such systems as the number of particles tends to infinity, while its long-time
behaviour is characterized by stationary distributions as time tends to
infinity. However, the validity of interchanging the infinite-time and
infinite-particle limits is not guaranteed. Consequently, simulation methods
that rely on a finite-particle truncation may fail to accurately capture the
mean-field system's stationary distributions, particularly when the coexistence
of multiple metastable states leads to phase transitions. In this paper, we
adapt the framework of the Weak Generative Sampler (WGS) -- a generative
technique based on normalizing flows and a weak formulation of the nonlinear
Fokker-Planck equation -- to compute and generate i.i.d. samples satisfying the
stationary distributions of McKean-Vlasov processes. Extensive numerical
experiments validate the efficacy of the proposed methods, showcasing their
ability to accurately approximate stationary distributions and capture phase
transitions in complex systems.

### From higher-order moments to time correlation functions in strongly correlated systems: A DMRG-based memory kernel coupling theory

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种结合记忆核耦合理论(MKCT)和密度矩阵重整化群(DMRG)的混合方法，用于计算强关联系统中的动力学可观测量，避免了昂贵的实时传播计算。

We introduce a hybrid approach for computing dynamical observables in
strongly correlated systems using higher-order moments. This method integrates
memory kernel coupling theory (MKCT) with the density matrix renormalization
group (DMRG), extending our recent work on MKCT to strongly correlated systems.
The method establishes that correlation functions can be derived from the
moments. Within our framework, operators and wavefunctions are represented as
matrix product operators (MPOs) and matrix product states (MPSs), respectively.
Crucially, the repeated application of the Liouville operator is achieved
through an iterative procedure analogous to the DMRG algorithm itself. We
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of MKCT-DMRG by computing the
spectral function of the Hubbard model. Furthermore, we successfully apply the
method to compute the electronic friction in the Hubbard-Holstein model. In all
cases, the results show excellent agreement with time-dependent DMRG (TD-DMRG)
benchmarks. The advantage of MKCT-DMRG over TD-DMRG is the computational
efficiency, which avoids expensive real-time propagation in TD-DMRG. These
findings establish MKCT-DMRG as a promising and accurate framework for
simulating challenging dynamical properties in strongly correlated quantum
systems.

- **TL;DR**: Dalton项目的振动平均模块扩展至支持ADF程序，可计算重原子的ZORA相对论效应下的振动校正，应用于汞化合物的电场梯度张量和NMR参数计算。

The vibrational averaging module of the Dalton Project was extended to work
also with the Amsterdam Density Functional (ADF) program, making it possible to
calculate vibrational corrections to properties and at the same time include a
treatment of relativistic effects for heavier atoms at the level of the
Zeroth-Order Regular Approximation (ZORA). To illustrate the importance of the
relativistic contributions, zero-point vibrational corrections were calculated
for the electric field gradient tensor and the two NMR parameters, the
isotropic shielding and the spin-spin coupling constants (SSCC), of selected
mercury compounds. For all three properties, the vibrational corrected values
performed closest to experimental values, and the magnitudes of the corrections
depended on the level of relativity and the basis set in the calculation.

### Quantum Mechanics of an Abrikosov Vortex in Nanofabricated Pinning Potential

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种超导器件来实验研究阿布里科索夫涡旋是否能被建模为量子力学准粒子，通过设计能够稳定钉扎单个涡旋的II型超导结构，模拟粒子在盒子中的量子系统。

A superconducting device is proposed for experimentally investigating whether
an Abrikosov vortex can be modeled as a quantum mechanical quasiparticle. The
design process of a type-II superconducting device capable of reliably pinning
a single Abrikosov vortex is presented, creating a particle-in-a-box-like
system. The proposed device consists of a cylindrically symmetric Nb film, 30
nm in diameter and 5 nm thick, with a 14 nm diameter artificial pinning center
at its center. Time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau simulations indicate robust
single-vortex pinning under an applied field of 6 T. The presumed quantized
energy levels and associated quantum wavefunctions of the vortex quasiparticle
are obtained by numerically solving the two-dimensional time-independent
Schr\"odinger equation for this system. It is shown that distinguishing the
ground and first excited states is experimentally feasible. Beyond fundamental
physics studies, the application of the proposed device in cryogenic memory
technology and quantum computing warrant further exploration.

### Higher-Form Anomalies on Lattices

- **TL;DR**: 本文提出了一种在张量积希尔伯特空间的晶格模型中定义高形式对称性't Hooft反常的一般方法，构造了表征反常的拓扑指标。

Higher-form symmetry in a tensor product Hilbert space is always emergent:
the symmetry generators become genuinely topological only when the Gauss law is
energetically enforced at low energies. In this paper, we present a general
method for defining the 't Hooft anomaly of higher-form symmetries in lattice
models built on a tensor product Hilbert space. In (2+1)D, for given Gauss law
operators realized by finite-depth circuits that generate a finite 1-form $G$
symmetry, we construct an index representing a cohomology class in $H^4(B^2G,
U(1))$, which characterizes the corresponding 't Hooft anomaly. This
construction generalizes the Else-Nayak characterization of 0-form symmetry
anomalies. More broadly, under the assumption of a specified formulation of the
$p$-form $G$ symmetry action and Hilbert space structure in arbitrary $d$
spatial dimensions, we show how to characterize the 't Hooft anomaly of the
symmetry action by an index valued in $H^{d+2}(B^{p+1}G, U(1))$.

### Anomalous statistics in the Langevin equation with fluctuating diffusivity: from Brownian yet non-Gaussian diffusion to anomalous diffusion and ergodicity breaking

- **TL;DR**: 这篇综述论文探讨了复杂系统中的非经典扩散现象，特别是布朗但非高斯扩散(BYNGD)和反常扩散，重点介绍了基于涨落扩散率的朗之万方程(LEFD)理论框架。

Diffusive motion is a fundamental transport mechanism in physical and
biological systems, governing dynamics across a wide range of scales -- from
molecular transport to animal foraging. In many complex systems, however,
diffusion deviates from classical Brownian behaviour, exhibiting striking
phenomena such as Brownian yet non-Gaussian diffusion (BYNGD) and anomalous
diffusion. BYNGD describes a frequently observed statistical feature
characterised by the coexistence of linear mean-square displacement (MSD) and
non-Gaussian displacement distributions. Anomalous diffusion, in contrast,
involves a nonlinear time dependence of the MSD and often reflects mechanisms
such as trapping, viscoelasticity, heterogeneity, or active processes. Both
phenomena challenge the conventional framework based on constant diffusivity
and Gaussian statistics. This review focuses the theoretical modelling of such
behaviour via the Langevin equation with fluctuating diffusivity (LEFD) -- a
flexible stochastic framework that captures essential features of diffusion in
heterogeneous media. LEFD not only accounts for BYNGD but also naturally
encompasses a wide range of anomalous transport phenomena, including
subdiffusion, ageing, and weak ergodicity breaking. Ergodicity is discussed in
terms of the correspondence between time and ensemble averages, as well as the
trajectory-to-trajectory variability of time-averaged observables. The review
further highlights the empirical relevance of LEFD and related models in
explaining diverse experimental observations and underscores their value to
uncovering the physical mechanisms governing transport in complex systems.

### Reduced Order Modeling of Energetic Materials Using Physics-Aware Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks in a Latent Space (LatentPARC)

- **TL;DR**: 该论文提出了一种加速物理感知深度学习(PADL)的方法，通过将复杂场演化问题解耦为几何特征学习和低维特征空间动力学建模两个任务，显著减少了计算成本。

Physics-aware deep learning (PADL) has gained popularity for use in complex
spatiotemporal dynamics (field evolution) simulations, such as those that arise
frequently in computational modeling of energetic materials (EM). Here, we show
that the challenge PADL methods face while learning complex field evolution
problems can be simplified and accelerated by decoupling it into two tasks:
learning complex geometric features in evolving fields and modeling dynamics
over these features in a lower dimensional feature space. To accomplish this,
we build upon our previous work on physics-aware recurrent convolutions (PARC).
PARC embeds knowledge of underlying physics into its neural network
architecture for more robust and accurate prediction of evolving physical
fields. PARC was shown to effectively learn complex nonlinear features such as
the formation of hotspots and coupled shock fronts in various initiation
scenarios of EMs, as a function of microstructures, serving effectively as a
microstructure-aware burn model. In this work, we further accelerate PARC and
reduce its computational cost by projecting the original dynamics onto a
lower-dimensional invariant manifold, or 'latent space.' The projected latent
representation encodes the complex geometry of evolving fields (e.g.
temperature and pressure) in a set of data-driven features. The reduced
dimension of this latent space allows us to learn the dynamics during the
initiation of EM with a lighter and more efficient model. We observe a
significant decrease in training and inference time while maintaining results
comparable to PARC at inference. This work takes steps towards enabling rapid
prediction of EM thermomechanics at larger scales and characterization of EM
structure-property-performance linkages at a full application scale.

- **TL;DR**: 在单分子尺度上实现氧原子删除和环收缩的骨架编辑，将含氧七元环转化为苝骨架分子

Skeletal editing of cyclic molecules has garnered considerable attention in
the context of drug discovery and green chemistry, with notable examples in
solution-phase synthesis. Here, we extend the scope of skeletal editing to the
single-molecule scale. We demonstrate tip-induced oxygen deletion and ring
contraction of an oxygen-containing seven-membered ring on bilayer NaCl films
to generate molecules containing the perylene skeleton. The products were
identified and characterized by atomic force and scanning tunneling
microscopies, which provided access to bond-resolved molecular structures and
orbital densities. Insights into the reaction mechanisms were obtained by
density functional theory calculations. Our work expands the toolbox of
tip-induced chemistry for single-molecule synthesis.

### Enhancement of torque transmission capability in Magneto-Rheological fluid-based Clutch using novel hybrid corrugated plane transmission surface strategy

- **TL;DR**: 提出一种波纹状传输表面的新型磁流变离合器设计，通过增加传输面积和优化磁场线分布来提高扭矩传输能力，优化后传输能力提升39.37%

In an increased automated world, miniaturization is the key to widespread
deployment of advanced technologies. Enhancing the torque transmissibility by
abiding to the spatial constraints imposed by radial space availability has
consistently remained a hurdle in the implementation of Magneto-Rheological
(MR) clutches that use shear mode of MR fluid (MRF). This proves the necessity
of a novel design capable of providing required transmission capability with a
reduced transmission surface area. The present study analyzes a corrugated
transmissible surface design which improves torque transmissibility with the
help of increased transmission area and proper alignment of field lines passing
through the MRF gap. In this paper, the impact of various dimensional
parameters of a hybrid corrugated plane type MR clutch (MRC) design was studied
with the aid of magnetic analysis performed on COMSOL Multiphysics software.
The results obtained shows that various parameters in the design of MR
clutches, such as annular and radial MR gaps, disc width, individual
corrugation heights, corrugation width, bobbin thickness and radii of plane
surface influences the torque transmission capability of MR clutches. Also, an
optimization of the hybrid corrugated plane MR Clutch of the chosen geometry
has been conducted with the transmission capability increasing by 39.37%
compared with the non-optimized geometrical configuration.

### Atomic Radial Correlation Energy Density Components

The components of the radial correlation energy density are calculated and
analyzed for the atoms from He to Ar. The components include the
nucleus-electron potential correlation energy density, the kinetic correlation
energy density and the electron-electron potential correlation energy density.
The necessary correlated one and two-electron density matrices are obtained
from the Extrapolated-Full-Configuration-Interaction (exFCI) wave function
where the reference wave function is restricted Hartree-Fock (RHF) or
restricted open-shell Hartree-Fock (ROHF) depending on whether the atom is
closed or open-shell. The accuracy associated with integrating the HF and exFCI
energy density components, and the correlation energy density components, is
evaluated on the SG-1 and SG-2 atomic grids. The SG-1 grid provides atomic
energies that are accurate to about 1 kJ mol$^{-1}$, with the exception of the
kinetic energy. The SG-2 grid is required for the analysis of atomic kinetic
energies and more subtle energetic effects. There is also a significant amount
of integration error cancellation in the correlation energy densities. The
radial correlation energy densities display notable shell structure, and there
is a substantial difference between the $\alpha$ and $\beta$-electron
correlation energy densities for the open-shell atoms.

### Particle-hole symmetry in the pseudogap phase of moderately underdoped cuprate high temperature superconductors evidenced from joint density of states analysis

In conventional superconductors, the energy scale associated with the
superfluid stiffness is much larger compared to the pairing energy and hence,
the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) is entirely dictated by the
superconducting (SC) energy gap. The phase rigidity of the SC condensate in
unconventional superconductors, on the other hand, can be low enough to enable
destruction of superconductivity via phase incoherence and persistence of an
energy gap even at the absence of macroscopic superconductivity above Tc. This
is considered a possible mechanism of the pseudogap (PG) state of cuprate high
temperature superconductors (HTSCs). We have investigated the electronic energy
({\omega}) and momentum-separation vector (q) dependence of the joint density
of states (JDOS), derived from the autocorrelated Angle Resolved Photoemission
Spectroscopy (ARPES) data, from moderately underdoped
Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+{\delta}HTSC samples at temperatures below and above Tc. We found
that q-space structure of the constant {\omega} JDOS intensity maps and the
dispersions of the JDOS peaks are essentially the same both below and above Tc.
Furthermore, the dispersions of the JDOS peaks above Tc are particle-hole
symmetric. These observations evince similarity between the nature of the
energy gap below and above Tc, which supports preformed pairing scenario for
the PG state at least in the moderately underdoped regime.

### Antiferromagnetism and Stripe Channel Order in the $\mathrm{SU}(N)$-Symmetric Two-Channel Kondo Lattice Model

- **TL;DR**: 通过大规模无符号问题的行列式量子蒙特卡洛模拟，研究了SU(N)对称双通道Kondo晶格模型在强耦合区域发现自发通道对称性破缺，形成条纹二聚化模式。

We carry out large-scale, sign-problem-free determinant quantum Monte Carlo
simulations of the square lattice $\mathrm{SU}(N)$-symmetric two-channel Kondo
lattice model at half-filling. We map out the zero-temperature phase diagram
for $N = 2, 4, 6$, and $8$, as a function of the Kondo coupling strength. In
the weak-coupling regime, we observe antiferromagnetic order of the localized
moments. Remarkably, for $N \geq 6$, sufficiently strong Kondo coupling induces
spontaneous channel symmetry breaking, forming a stripe dimerization pattern
with a wave vector $\boldsymbol{k}=(\pi,0)$ alternating between channels. These
findings are supported by a complementary large-$N$ saddle point analysis,
which identifies the striped hybridization pattern as the energetically
preferred configuration. The spatial symmetry-breaking results in an
anisotropic Fermi surface reconstruction.

### Nambu Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics III: Application to specific phenomena

We apply Nambu non-equilibrium thermodynamics (NNET)-a dynamics with multiple
Hamiltonians coupled to entropy-induced dissipation-to paradigmatic
far-from-equilibrium systems. Concretely, we construct NNET realizations for
the Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction (oscillatory), the Hindmarsh-Rose neuron
model (spiking), and the Lorenz and Chen systems (chaotic), and analyze their
dynamical and thermodynamic signatures. Across all cases the velocity field
cleanly decomposes into a reversible Nambu part and an irreversible
entropygradient part, anchored by a model-independent quasi-conserved quantity.
This construction reproduces cycles, spikes, and strange-attractor behavior and
clarifies transitions among steady, periodic, and chaotic regimes via
cross-model diagnostics. These results demonstrate that NNET provides a
unified, quantitatively consistent framework for oscillatory, spiking, and
chaotic non-equilibrium systems, offering a systematic description beyond the
scope of linear-response theories such as Onsager's relations or GENERIC.

### Spectral Analysis of Light Interstitial Segregation Energies in Ni: The Role of Local Cr Coordination for Boron and Carbon

- **TL;DR**: 本文提出了一个光谱偏析框架，用于分析化学复杂合金中轻间隙原子（硼和碳）在镍中的偏析行为，通过映射偏析能量分布来揭示局部铬配位的影响。

Understanding interstitial segregation in chemically complex alloys requires
accounting for chemical and structural heterogeneity of interfaces, motivating
approaches that move beyond scalar descriptors to capture the full spatial and
compositional spectra of segregation behavior. Here, we introduce a spectral
segregation framework that maps distributions of segregation energies for light
interstitials in Ni as a function of local Cr coordination. Boron exhibits a
broad, rugged energy spectrum with significant positional flexibility whereas
carbon remains confined to a narrow spectrum with minimal displacement. At the
free surface, Cr-rich coordination destabilizes both interstitials (e.g.,
positive segregation energies), in sharp contrast to the stabilizing role of Cr
at the GB. This inversion establishes a natural segregation gradient that
drives interstitials away from undercoordinated internal surfaces and toward
GBs. These results underscore the limitations of single-valued segregation
descriptors and demonstrate how a distributional approach reveals the
mechanistic origins of interstitial--interface interactions in chemically
heterogeneous alloys.

### Topological Phononic Crystal on the Scale of Quasi-Ballistic Phonon Transport

Phonon engineering technology has opened up the functional thermal management
of semiconductor-based classical and quantum electronics at the micro- and
nanoscales. However, challenges have remained in designing accurate thermal
characteristics based on quasi-ballistic phonon transport. The quasi-ballistic
thermal transport arises from the combination of wave-like and diffusive phonon
behaviors unlike pure diffusion. The topological nature has been known to be
compatible with both wave and diffusive phenomena. Therefore, topological
phononic crystals have great potential for the development of controllable and
designable thermal transport based on quasi-ballistic phonons. In this study,
we experimentally investigated the thermal behavior at the scale of
quasi-ballistic phonon transport using a 1D Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model-based
topological phononic crystal. Quasi-ballistic phonon transport was observed
through change in thermal conductivity depending on the structural parameters
of topological systems using micro-thermoreflectance. Furthermore, using
topological interface states, the experimentally observed thermal behaviors
were found to agree well with the theoretically expected those. Accordingly,
the topological nature is an effective approach for thermal management in
micro- and nanoscale systems with quasi-ballistic phonon transport. Our results
pave the way for a unified control scheme for wave and diffusion phenomena,
such as quasi-ballistic phonons.

Recent advancements have led to the development of bright and heavy
metal-free blue-emitting quantum dot light-emitting diodes (QLEDs). However,
consensus understanding of their distinct photophysical and electroluminescent
dynamics remains elusive. This work correlates the chemical and electronic
changes occurring in a QLED during operation using depth-resolved and operando
techniques. The results indicate that oxygen vacancy forms in the ZnMgO layer
during operation, with important implications on the charge injection and
electrochemical dynamics. Taken together, the results suggest a causal
relationship between oxygen vacancy formation and operational degradation of
the blue-emitting ZnSeTe-based QLEDs.

The recent discovery of compressed superconductivity at 80~K in
La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$-$\delta$ has brought nickelates into the family of
unconventional high-temperature superconductors. However, due to the challenges
of directly probing the superconducting pairing mechanism under high pressure,
the pairing symmetry and gap structures of nickelate superconductors remain
under intense debate. In this work, we successfully determine the microscopic
information on the superconducting gap structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$-$\delta$
samples subjected to pressures exceeding 20~GPa, by constructing different
conductance junctions within diamond anvil cells. By analyzing the
temperature-dependent differential conductance spectra within the
Blonder--Tinkham--Klapwijk (BTK) model, we have determined the superconducting
energy gap at high pressure. The differential conductance curves reveal a
two-gap structure with $\Delta_{1} = 23~\mathrm{meV}$ and $\Delta_{2} =
6~\mathrm{meV}$, while the BTK fitting is consistent with an $s$-like, two-gap
spectrum. The gap ratio $2\Delta_{s1}(0) / k_{\mathrm{B}}T_{c}$ is found to be
7.61, belonging to a family of strongly coupled superconductors. Our findings
provide valuable insights into the superconducting gap structures of the
pressure-induced superconducting nickelates.

We revisit the global phase diagram of magic-angle twisted bilayer and
[symmetric] trilayer graphene (MA-TBG/TSTG) in light of recent scanning
tunneling microscopy (STM) measurements on these materials. These experiments
both confirmed the importance of strain in stabilizing the predicted
incommensurate Kekul\'{e} spiral (IKS) order near filling $|\nu|=2$ of the
weakly dispersive central bands in both systems, and suggested a key role for
electron-phonon couplings and short-range Coulomb interactions in selecting
between various competing orders at low strain in MA-TBG. Here, we show that
such interactions $\textit{also}$ play a crucial role in selecting the spin
structure of the strain-stabilized IKS state. This in turn influences the
visibility of the IKS order in STM in a manner that allows us to infer their
relative importance. We use this insight in conjunction with various other
pieces of experimental data to build a more complete picture of the phase
diagram, focusing on the spectrum of low-lying collective modes and the nature
of the doped Fermi surfaces. We explore the broad phenomenological implications
of these results for superconductivity.

For the system with inhomogeneous distribution of macroscopic parameters we
obtain thermodynamic relation which depends on the spatial point (coordinate).
In our approach, to obtain such a relation we use the basic ideas of the method
of nonequilibrium statistical operator combined with the Hubbard-Stratonovich
transformation. First of all, we define the thermodynamic relation for the
system with homogeneous distribution of particles. Possible behavior
peculiarities of systems with different character of interaction in
nonequilibrium case are predicted. By saddle-point method we find the dominant
contributions to the partition function and obtain all thermodynamic parameters
of the systems with different character of interaction. The formations of
saddle state in all systems of interacting particles at different temperatures
and particle distributions have the same physical nature and therefore they can
be described in the same way. We consider the systems with attractive and
repulsive interactions as well as self-gravitating systems.

Lead-halide perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) are established quantum emitters
with potential for entangled photon-pair generation via multiexciton cascades.
However, the energetics and dynamics of many-body excitations remain poorly
understood. Here, we perform time- and frequency-resolved photon-correlation
spectroscopy of single CsPbBr\textsubscript{3} PQDs at low temperatures using a
single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) array detector. We report biexciton
binding energies and assign their charged states, which undergo fast ($\mu$s)
switching dynamics. Most notably, we identify a spectral feature blue-shifted
from the exciton by $7.4 \pm 1.9$ meV as the bound triexciton and establish the
order of its cascade emission. These results highlight the power of
low-temperature, multidimensional photon-correlation spectroscopy for resolving
complex many-body dynamics.

### Reentrant localization in fractionally charged electron wave packets

We investigate the localization transition in fractionally charged electron
wave packets, which is injected into a quantum conductor by a single voltage
pulse with arbitrary flux quantum. We show that the transition is
unidirectional for individual electrons or holes. They always undergo a
delocalization-to-localization transition as the flux increases. In contrast,
the transition of the neutral electron-hole pairs is bidirectional. As the flux
increases, the transition can be a localization-to-delocalization transition or
vice versa, which is controlled via the long-time tail of the voltage pulse.
The localization-to-delocalization transition occurs in the case of
short-tailed pulses, which decay faster than Lorentzian. In this case, the
directions of the transitions for the neutral eh pairs and individual electrons
or holes are opposite. Certain localized neutral electron-hole pairs can first
evolve into delocalized ones, then split into individual electrons and holes
with localized wave functions, which gives a reentrant localization. The
delocalization-to-localization transition occurs in the case of long-tailed
pulses, which decay slower than Lorentzian. The reentrant localization vanishes
in this case, as the directions of the two transitions are the same. It is also
absent in the case of Lorentzian pulses, where the localized neutral
electron-hole pairs cannot be excited at all.

### Extension of the Jordan-Wigner mapping to nonorthogonal spin orbitals for quantum computing application to valence bond approaches

Quantum computing offers a promising platform to address the computational
challenges inherent in quantum chemistry, and particularly in valence bond (VB)
methods, which are chemically appealing but suffer from high computational cost
due to the use of nonorthogonal orbitals. While various fermionic-to-spin
mappings exist for orthonormal spin orbitals, such as the widely used
Jordan-Wigner transformations, an analogous framework for nonorthogonal spin
orbitals remains undeveloped. In this work, we propose an alternative
Jordan-Wigner-type mapping tailored for the nonorthogonal case, with the goal
of enabling efficient quantum simulations of VB-type wavefunctions. Our
approach paves the way towards the development of chemically interpretable and
computationally feasible valence bond algorithms on near-term quantum devices.
An initial theoretical analysis and a preliminary application demonstrate the
feasibility of this encoding and its potential for extending the applicability
of VB methods to larger and more complex systems.

The recent discovery of superconductivity in pressure-stabilized bulk
La3Ni2O7-delta, with a critical temperature (Tc) exceeding 77 K, has opened a
new frontier in high-temperature superconductivity research beyond cuprates.
Yet, the superconducting gap amplitude and symmetry, the key parameters to
characterize a superconductor, remain elusive due to the overwhelming
challenges of gap studies under high pressure. Here, we introduce in situ
directional point-contact spectroscopy conducted under truly hydrostatic
pressure, enabling the direct mapping of the superconducting gap in pressurized
La3Ni2O7-delta single crystals. Depending on the junction orientation,
differential conductance (dI/dV) spectra exhibit distinct V-shaped
quasiparticle features and a sharp zero-bias peak, indicating a predominant
d-wave-like pairing symmetry. Measurement of the c-axis gap amplitude Delta
yields a gap-to-Tc ratio of 2Delta/kBTc = 4.2(5), positioning La3Ni2O7-delta
firmly among unconventional, nodal high-Tc superconductors. These findings set
stringent constraints on theoretical models for nickelate superconductors and
establish a robust spectroscopic approach for understanding superconductors
under extreme pressures.

Landau levels (LLs) are the massively-degenerate discrete energy spectrum of
a charged particle in a transverse magnetic field and lie at the heart of many
intriguing phenomena such as the integer and fractional quantum Hall effects as
well as quantized vortices. In this Letter, we consider coupling of LLs of a
transversely driven charge neutral particle in a synthetic gauge potential to a
quantized field of an optical cavity -- a setting reminiscent of superradiant
self-ordering setups in quantum gases. We uncover that this complex system can
be surprisingly described in terms of two highly nonlinearly-coupled quantum
harmonic oscillators, thus enabling a full quantum mechanical treatment.
Light-matter coupling mixes the LLs and the superradiant photonic mode, leading
to the formation of hybrid states referred to as ``Landau polaritons''. They
inherit partially the degeneracy of the LLs and possess intriguing features
such as non-zero light-matter entanglement and quadrature squeezing. Depending
on the system parameters and the choice of initial state, the system exhibits
diverse nonequilibrium quantum dynamics and multiple steady states, with
distinct physical properties. This work lays the foundation for further
investigating the novel, driven-dissipative Landau-polariton physics in
quantum-gas--cavity-QED settings.

We investigate self-organized criticality in a two-dimensional electron gas
(2DEG) by introducing a lattice-based model that incorporates electron-electron
interactions through the concept of coherence length. Our numerical simulations
demonstrate that in the strongly interacting regime, the system exhibits a
distinct set of universal critical exponents, markedly different from those
observed in the weakly interacting limit. This dichotomy aligns with
experimental findings on the metal-insulator transition in 2DEGs, where high
interaction strength (low carrier density) leads to qualitatively different
behavior. The analysis includes scaling of the average electron density with
temperature, the power spectral density, and the statistics of electronic
avalanches - namely their size distributions and autocorrelation functions. In
all cases, the extracted exponents differ significantly between the weak and
strong interaction regimes, highlighting the emergence of two universality
classes governed by interaction strength. These results underscore the critical
role of electron correlations in the self-organized behavior of low-dimensional
electronic systems.

### Coupled Infrared Imaging and Multiphysics Modeling to Predict Three-Dimensional Thermal Characteristics during Selective Laser Melting

- **TL;DR**: 本文提出了一种结合高速红外成像和3D多物理场模拟的方法，用于重建增材制造过程中熔池的动态亚表面温度分布，从而预测微观结构变化。

Laser heating during additive manufacturing (AM) induces extreme and
transient thermal conditions which critically influence the microstructure
evolution and mechanical properties of the resulting component. However,
accurately resolving these conditions with sufficient spatiotemporal accuracy
remains a central challenge. We demonstrate a unique approach that couples
high-speed infrared imaging, during selective laser melting of MAR-M247, with a
transient three-dimensional (3D) multiphysics simulation to reconstruct the
dynamic sub-surface temperature distribution of the melt pool. This integrated
framework enables the estimation of experimentally-validated, 3D solidification
conditions-including solidification velocities and cooling rates-at the
solid-liquid interface while also significantly lowering computational cost. By
quantifying solidification conditions, we predict variations in microstructure
size and orientation driven by laser processing parameters and validate them
with ex situ scanning electron microscopy and electron backscatter diffraction
maps. Our findings substantiate that an integrated experimental-computational
approach is crucial to realize in situ prediction and optimization of
microstructures in commercial AM.

### Symmetry and Topology of Successive Quantum Feedback Control

We establish a symmetry classification for a general class of quantum
feedback control. For successive feedback control with a non-adaptive sequence
of bare measurements (i.e., with positive Kraus operators), we prove that the
symmetry classification collapses to the ten-fold AZ$^\dagger$ classes,
specifying the allowed topology of CPTP maps associated with feedback control.
We demonstrate that a chiral Maxwell's demon with Gaussian measurement errors
exhibits quantized winding numbers. Moreover, for general (non-bare)
measurements, we explicitly construct a protocol that falls outside the
ten-fold classification. These results broaden and clarify the principles in
engineering topological aspects of quantum control robust against disorder and
imperfections.

Molecular dynamics computer simulations have been conducted on neat liquid
methanol, using three different united atom (three site) interatomic
potentials: TraPPE [J. Phys. Chem. B 105, 3093 (2001)], UAM-I [J. Mol. Liq.
323, 114576 (2021)] and OPLS/2016 [J. Chem. Phys. 145, 034508 (2016)]. The
effects of pressure, between 1 bar and 6 kbar, have been evaluated on total
scattering structure factors, partial radial distribution functions, as well as
on collective characteristics such as ring size distributions and cluster size
distributions. Agreement with experimental density is nearly quantitative for
all the three force fields, and major trends observed for recent pressure
dependent neutron diffraction data are reproduced qualitatively. The OPLS/2016
force field, in general, generates properties that are markedly different from
results originating from the other potentials. Pressure effects are hardly
noticeable on most partial radial distribution functions and on the
distribution of the number of hydrogen bonded neighbours. On the other hand,
collective structural properties, like cluster- and ring size distributions
exhibit significant changes with increasing pressure: larger clusters become
more numerous, whereas the number of cyclic clusters, i.e., rings, decrease.
The self-diffusion coefficient decreases with increasing pressure, and the same
is valid for the average lifetime of hydrogen bonds.

### Systematic Schrieffer-Wolff-transformation approach to Josephson junctions: quasiparticle effects and Josephson harmonics

We use the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation (SWT) to analyze Josephson
junctions between superconducting leads described by the charge-conserving BCS
theory. Starting from the single-electron tunneling terms, we directly recover
the conventional effective Hamiltonian, $-E_J\cos\hat{\varphi}$, with an
operator-valued phase bias $\hat{\varphi}$. The SWT approach has the advantage
that it can be systematically extended to more complex scenarios. We show that
if a Bogoliubov quasiparticle is present its motion couples to that of Cooper
pairs, introducing correlated dynamics that reshape the energy spectrum of the
junction. Furthermore, higher-order terms in the SWT naturally describe
Josephson harmonics, whose amplitudes are directly related to the microscopic
properties of the superconducting leads and the junction. We derive expressions
that could facilitate tuning the ratio between the different harmonics in a
controlled way.

### A graphical diagnostic of topological order using ZX calculus

Establishing a universal diagnostic of topological order remains an open
theoretical challenge. In particular, diagnosing long-range entanglement
through the entropic area law suffers from spurious contributions, failing to
unambiguously identify topological order. Here we devise a protocol based on
the ZX calculus, a graphical tensor network, to determine the topological order
of a state circumventing entropy calculations. The protocol takes as input
real-space bipartitions of a state and returns a ZX contour diagram,
$\mathcal{D}_{\partial A}$, displaying long-range graph connectivity only for
long-range entangled states. We validate the protocol by showing that the
contour diagrams of the toric and color codes are equivalent except for the
number of non-local nodes, which differentiates their topological order. The
number of these nodes is robust to the choice of the boundary and ground-state
superposition, and they are absent for trivial states, even those with spurious
entropy contributions. Our results single out ZX calculus as a tool to detect
topological long-range entanglement by leveraging the advantages of
diagrammatic reasoning against entropic diagnostics.

In this article, a brief introduction is first given on infrared studies of
materials at high pressures using a diamond anvil cell. Then, our recent
results of high-pressure infrared studies are described for Mg$_2$Si, InAs, and
InSb. For Mg$_2$Si, pressure-induced metallization at pressures near 10 GPa
were clearly demonstrated for both carrier-doped and undoped Mg$_2$Si by large
increases of reflectivity. For InAs and InSb, their band gap ($E_g$) increased
rapidly and almost linearly with pressure with linear coefficients of
$dE_g/dP$=84.6 and 112 meV/GPa, respectively. Obtained values of $E_g$ versus
lattice parameter at high pressures are compared with those for other IIl-V
semiconductors at ambient pressure, giving unique insight into effects of
physical and chemical pressures on $E_g$. Above the structural transition
pressures of 7 and 3 GPa for InAs and InSb, respectively, they exhibit highly
metallic characteristics accompanied by high reflectivity.

Chiral photon interactions with two-dimensional (2D) materials enable
unprecedented control of quantum phenomena. In this paper, we report anomalous
inverse Faraday effects (IFE) in graphene quantum dots (GQDs) under linearly
polarized optical vortex illumination, where transferred orbital angular
momentum (OAM) generates light-induced magnetic moments. Employing our recently
developed time-dependent quantum perturbation framework [Phys. Rev. B 110,
085425 (2024)], we demonstrate a counterintuitive observation: some reversed
magnetic moments at off-axis positions occur-manifested as counter-rotating
currents to the vortex helical wavefront. Phase-difference analysis and
eigenmode decomposition resolve this anomaly, revealing that the OAM transfer
efficiency is orders of magnitude weaker than its spin counterpart. This work
establishes a new paradigm for optical OAM-to-magnetization conversion in
quantum-engineered 2D systems.

High-harmonic spectroscopy (HHS) in liquids promises real-time access to
ultrafast electronic dynamics in the native environment of chemical and
biological processes. While electron recollision has been established as the
dominant mechanism of high-harmonic generation (HHG) in liquids, resolving the
underlying electron dynamics has remained elusive. Here we demonstrate
attosecond-resolved measurements of recolliding electron wave packets,
extending HHS from neat liquids to aqueous solutions. Using phase-controlled
two-colour fields, we observe a linear scaling of the two-colour delay that
maximizes even-harmonic emission with photon energy, yielding slopes of
208+/-55 as/eV in ethanol and 124+/-42 as/eV in water, the latter matching ab
initio simulations (125+/-48 as/eV). In aqueous salt solutions, we uncover
interference minima whose appearance depends on solute type and concentration,
arising from destructive interference between solute and solvent emission. By
measuring the relative phase of solvent and solute HHG, we retrieve a variation
of electron transit time by 113+/-32 as/eV, consistent with our neat-liquid
results. These findings establish HHS as a powerful attosecond-resolved probe
of electron dynamics in disordered media, opening transformative opportunities
for studying ultrafast processes such as energy transfer, charge migration, and
proton dynamics in liquids and solutions.

Recent researches on tilted Dirac cone materials have unveiled an astonishing
property, the metric of the spacetime can be altered in these materials by
applying a perpendicular electric field. This phenomenon is observed near the
Fermi velocity, which is significantly lower than the speed of light. According
to this property, we derive the Ginzburg-Landau action from the microscopic
Hamiltonian of the BCS theory for the tilted Dirac cone materials. This
derivation is performed near the critical point within the framework of curved
spacetime. The novelty of the present work lies in deriving a general
Ginzburg-Landau action that depends on spacetime curvature, where the curvature
is tuned by an external electric field. Furthermore, this finding enables us to
apply the Ginzburg-Landau theory at high temperatures by changing the spacetime
metric, potentially offering insights into achieving high-temperature
superconductivity in these materials.

We investigate interacting Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chains with two- and
three-site unit cells using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG)
simulations. By selecting appropriate filling fractions and sweeping across
interaction strength \( J_z \) and dimerization \( \delta \), we map out their
phase diagrams and identify transition lines via entanglement entropy and
magnetization measurements. In the two-site model, we observe the emergence of
an interaction-induced antiferromagnetic intermediate phase between the
topologically trivial and non-trivial regimes, as well as a critical region at
negative \( J_z \) with suppressed magnetization and finite-size scaling of
entanglement entropy. In contrast, the three-site model lacks an intermediate
phase and exhibits asymmetric edge localization and antiferromagnetic ordering
in both positive and negative \( J_z \) regimes. We further examine the
response of edge states to Ising perturbations. In the two-site model,
zero-energy edge modes are topologically protected and remain robust up to a
finite interaction strength. However, in the three-site model, where the edge
states reside at finite energy, this protection breaks down. Despite this, the
edge-localized nature of these states survives in the form of polarized modes
whose spatial profiles reflect the non-interacting limit.

### Over One Order of Magnitude Enhancement in Hole Mobility of 2D III-V Semiconductors through Valence Band Edge Shift

- **TL;DR**: 二维GaAs作为III-V半导体原型，研究发现量子非谐性使空穴迁移率降低44%，提出价带边位移策略可通过1%双轴压应变使室温空穴迁移率提升1600%

Two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors show great potential to sustain Moore's
law in the era of ultra-scaled electronics. However, their scalable
applications are severely constrained by low hole mobility. In this work, we
take 2D-GaAs as a prototype of III-V semiconductors to investigate the effects
of quantum anharmonicity (QA) on hole transport, employing the stochastic
self-consistent harmonic approximation assisted by the machine learning
potential. It is found that the room-temperature hole mobility of 2D-GaAs is
reduced by $\sim$44% as the QA effects are incorporated, which is attributed to
the enhanced electron-phonon scattering from the out-of-plane acoustic
polarization. The valence band edge shift (VBES) strategy is proposed to
increase the hole mobility by $\sim$1600% at room temperature, which can be
realized by 1% biaxial compressive strain. The electron-phonon scattering rate
is dramatically decreased due to the full filtering of the original interband
electron-phonon scattering channels that existed in the flat hole pocket. The
VBES strategy can be further extended to other 2D III-V semiconductors to
promote their hole mobilities.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文发现石墨烯在磁场和最小长度存在下具有隐藏的su(1,1)对称性，这种对称性允许代数构造能谱，并通过广义不确定性关系控制或创建束缚态。

Graphene is a zero-gap semiconductor, where the electrons propagating inside
are described by the ultra-relativistic Dirac equation normally reserved for
very high energy massless particles. In this work, we show that graphene under
a magnetic field in the presence of a minimal length has a hidden $su(1,1)$
symmetry. This symmetry allows us to construct the spectrum algebraically. In
fact, a generalized uncertainty relation, leading to a non-zero minimum
uncertainty on the position, would be closer to physical reality and allow us
to control or create bound states in graphene. Using the partition function
based on the Epstein zeta function, the thermodynamic properties are well
determined. We find that the Dulong-Petit law is verified and the heat capacity
is independent of the deformation parameter.

### Formalizing dimensional analysis using the Lean theorem prover

Dimensional analysis is fundamental to the formulation and validation of
physical laws, ensuring that equations are dimensionally homogeneous and
scientifically meaningful. In this work, we use Lean 4 to formalize the
mathematics of dimensional analysis. We define physical dimensions as mappings
from base dimensions to exponents, prove that they form an Abelian group under
multiplication, and implement derived dimensions and dimensional homogeneity
theorems. Building on this foundation, we introduce a definition of physical
variables that combines numeric values with dimensions, extend the framework to
incorporate SI base units and fundamental constants, and implement the
Buckingham Pi Theorem. Finally, we demonstrate the approach on an example: the
Lennard-Jones potential, where our framework enforces dimensional consistency
and enables formal proofs of physical properties such as zero-energy separation
and the force law. This work establishes a reusable, formally verified
framework for dimensional analysis in Lean, providing a foundation for future
libraries in formalized science and a pathway toward scientific computing
environments with built-in guarantees of dimensional correctness.

### Non-Abelian Gauge Theory of Spin Triplet Superconductivity and Spin Triplet Magnon Spintronics

We present an SU(2)xU(1) Ginzburg-Landau theory of the spin triplet
ferromagnetic superconductivity which could also describe the physics of the
spin triplet magnon spintronics, where the SU(2) gauge interaction of the
magnon plays an important role. The theory is made of the massive photon,
massless neutral magnon, massive non-Abelian magnon, and the Higgs scalar field
which represents the density of the Copper pair. It has the following
characteristic features, the long range magnetic interaction mediated by the
massless magnon, two types of conserved supercurrents (the ordinary
electromagnetic current and the spin current made of the magnons) which could
explain the conversion between the charge and spin currents, and the
non-Abelian Meissner effect generated by the spin current. Moreover, it has
non-Abelian topological objects, the quantized non-Abelian magnonic vortex and
non-Abelian magnonic monopole, as well as the ordinary Abrikosov vortex. The
theory is characterized by three scales. In addition to the correlation length
fixed by the mass of the Higgs field it has two different mass scales, the one
fixed by the mass of the photon and the other fixed by the mass of the
off-diagonal magnon. We compare the theory with the non-Abelian gauge theory of
the spin doublet ferromagnetic superconductivity which could also be
interpreted as an effective theory of the electron spintronics. We discuss the
physical implications of the non-Abelian gauge theories in condensed matter
physics.

Neural quantum states (NQS) have emerged as a promising approach to solve
second-quantised Hamiltonians, because of their scalability and flexibility. In
this work, we design and benchmark an NQS impurity solver for the quantum
embedding methods, focusing on the ghost Gutzwiller Approximation (gGA)
framework. We introduce a graph transformer-based NQS framework able to
represent arbitrarily connected impurity orbitals and develop an error control
mechanism to stabilise iterative updates throughout the quantum embedding
loops. We validate the accuracy of our approach with benchmark gGA calculations
of the Anderson Lattice Model, yielding results in excellent agreement with the
exact diagonalisation impurity solver. Finally, our analysis of the
computational budget reveals the method's principal bottleneck to be the
high-accuracy sampling of physical observables required by the embedding loop,
rather than the NQS variational optimisation, directly highlighting the
critical need for more efficient inference techniques.

### Atomic-scale phase-field modeling with universal machine learning potentials

Atomic-scale phase-field modeling formulates the probability densities of
atomic vibrations as Gaussian distributions and derives a free energy
functional using variational Gaussian theory and interatomic potentials. This
framework permits per-Gaussian decomposition of the free energy, providing a
description of local thermodynamic states with atomic resolution. However,
existing formulations are limited to classical pairwise interatomic potentials,
restricting their applicability to specific materials and compromising
quantitative accuracy. In this work, we extend the atomic-scale phase-field
methodology by incorporating universal machine learning interatomic potentials,
thereby generalizing the free energy functional to many-body systems. This
extension enhances both the accuracy and transferability of the approach. We
demonstrate the method by applying it to bulk copper under NVT and NPT
ensembles, where the predicted pressures and equilibrium lattice constants show
excellent agreement with molecular dynamics simulations, validating the
theoretical framework. Furthermore, we apply the method to {\Sigma}5(310)[001]
grain boundaries in copper, enabling the visualization of local free energy
distributions with atomic-scale resolution. The results reveal a pronounced
free energy concentration at the grain boundary core, capturing the
thermodynamic signature of the interface. This study establishes a versatile
and accurate framework for atomic-scale thermodynamic modeling, significantly
broadening the scope of phase-field approaches to include complex materials and
defect structures.

Nanoelectromechanical resonators provide an ideal platform for investigating
the interplay between electron transport and nonlinear mechanical motion.
Externally driven suspended carbon nanotubes, containing an electrostatically
defined quantum dot are especially promising. These devices possess two main
sources of nonlinearity: the electromechanical coupling and the intrinsic
contributions of the resonator that induce a Duffing-like nonlinear behavior.
In this work, we observe the interplay between the two sources across different
driving regimes. The main nonlinear feature we observe is the emergence of
arch-like resonances in the electronic transport when the resonator is strongly
driven. We show that our model is in good agreement with our experimental
electron transport measurements on a suspended carbon nanotube. This
characterization paves the way for the exploration of nonlinear phenomena using
mesoscopic electromechanical resonators.

### Low-energy spin waves as potential driving force for superconductivity in electron-doped cuprates

In order to fully utilize the technological potential of unconventional
superconductors, an enhanced understanding of the superconducting mechanism is
necessary. In the best performing superconductors, the cuprates,
superconductivity is intimately linked with magnetism, although the details of
this remain elusive. In search of clarity in the magnetism-superconductivity
relationship, we focus on the electron-doped cuprate Nd1.85Ce0.15CuO(4-delta)
(NCCO). NCCO has an antiferromagnetic ground state when synthesized, and only
becomes superconducting after a reductive annealing process. This makes NCCO an
ideal template to study how the magnetism differs in the superconducting and
non-superconducting state, while keeping the material template as constant as
possible. Using neutron spectroscopy, we reveal that the as-grown crystal
exhibits a large energy gap in the magnetic fluctuation spectrum. Upon
annealing, defects that are introduced by the commonly employed synthesis
method, are removed and the gap is significantly reduced. While the energy gap
in the annealed sample is an effect of superconductivity, we argue that the gap
in the as-grown sample is caused by the absence of long-wavelength spin waves.
The defects in as-grown NCCO thus play the dual role of suppressing both
superconductivity and low-energy spin waves, highlighting the connection
between these two phenomena.

We report ultrahigh magnetic field Faraday rotation results on the chiral
helimagnet Cu2OSeO3, the first Mott insulator showing skyrmion lattice phases
and a linear magnetoelectric effect. Between 180 and 300 T, we find signatures
of a Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of magnons, which can be described as a
canted XY ferrimagnet. Due to the magnetoelectric coupling, the transverse
magnetic order of the indivual Cu2+ spins is accompanied by a characteristic
dome-like electric polarization which is crucial for the observation of the
condensate via the Faraday rotation effect.

The search for high-performance spintronic materials motivates the
exploration of Heusler alloys with unconventional electronic properties. Using
density functional theory with Hubbard correction (DFT+$U$, $U = 4$~eV), we
investigate X$_2$MnGa (X = Ti, Ir) alloys, which stabilize in the ferromagnetic
L2$_1$-type structure with strong thermodynamic stability. Electronic structure
calculations reveal contrasting behaviors: Ti$_2$MnGa transitions from a
metallic L2$_1$-type phase to a spin gapless semiconductor (SGS) in the
XA-type, while Ir$_2$MnGa exhibits gapless half-metallicity behavior in the
L2$_1$-type but becomes half-metallic in the XA-type. The magnetic properties
are governed by spd hybridization between Mn-3$d$ and X-$d$/Ga-$p$ states,
which stabilizes ferromagnetism and tailors electronic states near the Fermi
level. The Hubbard $U$ correction proves essential for accurately describing
the correlated Mn-3$d$ electrons. These alloys combine structural stability
with tunable electronic and magnetic properties, offering a promising platform
for spin-polarized transport in next-generation spintronic devices.

Exotic collective phenomena emerge when bosons strongly interact within a
lattice. However, creating a robust and tunable solid-state platform to explore
such phenomena has been elusive. Dual moir\'e systems$-$compromising two
Coulomb-coupled moir\'e lattices$-$offer a promising system for investigating
strongly correlated dipolar excitons (composite bosons) with electrical
control. Thus far, their implementation has been hindered by the relative
misalignment and incommensurability of the two moir\'e patterns. Here we report
a dual moir\'e system with perfect translational and rotational alignment,
achieved by utilizing twisted hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) bilayer to both
generate an electrostatic moir\'e potential and separate MoSe$_{2}$ and
WSe$_{2}$ monolayers. We observe strongly correlated electron phases driven by
intralayer interactions and identify interlayer Rydberg trions, which become
trapped in the presence of the Mott insulating state. Importantly, our platform
is electrostatically programmable, allowing the realization of different
lattice symmetries with either repulsive or attractive interlayer interactions.
In particular, we implement the latter scenario by optically injecting charges,
which form a dipolar excitonic phase. Our results establish a versatile
platform for the exploration and manipulation of exotic and topological bosonic
quantum many-body phases.

### Explaining Principles of Tip-Enhanced Raman Images with Ab Initio Modeling

Tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) is a powerful method for imaging
vibrational motion and chemically characterizing surface-bound systems.
Theoretical simulations of TERS images often consider systems in isolation,
ignoring any substrate support, such as metallic surfaces. Here, we show that
this omission leads to deviations from experimentally measured data through
simulations with a new finite-field formulation of first-principles simulation
of TERS spectra that can address extended, periodic systems. We show that TERS
images of tetracyanoethylene on Ag(100) and defective MoS$_2$ monolayers
calculated using isolated molecules or cluster models are qualitatively
different from those calculated when accounting for the periodicity of the
substrate. For Mg(II)-porphine on Ag(100), a system for which a direct
experimental comparison is possible, these simulations prove to be crucial for
explaining the spatial variation of TERS intensity patterns and allow us to
uncover fundamental principles of TERS spectroscopy. We explain how and why
surface interactions affect images of out-of-plane vibrational modes much more
than those of in-plane modes, providing an important tool for the future
interpretation of these images in more complex systems.

Understanding the emergence of unconventional superconductivity, where the
order parameter deviates from simple isotropic s-wave pairing, is a central
puzzle in condensed matter physics. Transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs),
though generally regarded as conventional superconductors, display signatures
of this unusual behavior and thus provide a particularly intriguing platform to
explore how exotic states arise. Here we investigate the misfit compound
(SnS)$_{1.15}$(TaS$_2$), a heterostructure composed of alternating SnS and
1H-TaS$_2$ layers. Using transport, photoemission, and scanning tunneling
spectroscopy, we demonstrate that the SnS layers effectively decouple the
TaS$_2$ into electronically isolated 1H sheets. In this limit, the tunneling
density of states reveals a clear two-gap superconducting spectrum with T$_c
\sim$ 3.1 K. A theoretical model based on lack of inversion symmetry and
finite-range attraction reproduces the observed multi-gap structure as a mixed
singlet-triplet state. These results establish misfit compounds as a powerful
platform for studying unconventional superconductivity in isolated 1H layers
and for realizing multiple uncoupled superconductors within a single crystal.

We investigate the nature of the topological phase transition of the
antiferromagnetic Kitaev model on the honeycomb lattice in the presence of a
magnetic field along the [111] direction. The field opens a topological gap in
the Majorana fermion spectrum and leads to a sequence of topological phase
transitions before the field polarised state is reached. At mean field level
the gap first closes at the three $M$ points in the Brillouin zone, where the
Majorana fermions form Dirac cones, resulting in a change of Chern number by
three. An odd number of Dirac fermions in the infrared is unusual and requires
Berry curvature compensation in the UV, which occurs via topological, ring-like
hybridisation gaps with higher-energy bands. We perform a renormalisation-group
analysis of the topological phase transition at the three $M$ points within the
Yukawa theory, allowing for intra- and inter-valley fluctuations of the
spin-liquid bond operators. We find that the latter lead to a breaking of
Lorentz invariance and hence a different universality compared to the standard
Ising Gross-Neveu-Yukawa class.

Transport measurements of hybrid nanowires often rely on the observation of a
zero-bias conductance peak as a hallmark of Majorana bound states (MBSs).
However, such signatures can also be produced by trivial zero-energy Andreev
bound states (ABSs) or by quasi-Majorana bound states (QMBSs), complicating
their unambiguous identification. Here we propose microwave absorption
visibility, extracted from parity-dependent cavity-nanowire susceptibility
measurements, as a complementary probe of MBSs nonlocality. We study a Rashba
spin-orbit nanowire consisting of a proximitized superconducting segment and an
uncovered quantum-dot region, capacitively coupled to a single-mode microwave
cavity. We show that true MBSs yield finite visibility only when both MBSs are
simultaneously coupled to the cavity, reflecting their intrinsic nonlocality.
In contrast, ABSs and QMBSs exhibit visibility extrema even when the cavity
couples only locally to part of the nanowire. We further demonstrate that this
distinction persists in the presence of Gaussian disorder, which may otherwise
generate trivial subgap states. Motivated by recent experiments, we also
analyze ``poor man's" Majoranas in double-quantum-dot setups, where analytical
results confirm the same nonlocal visibility criterion. Finally, we discuss a
cavity-driven scheme for initializing the electronic system in a given parity
state. Our results establish cavity-based visibility as a robust and versatile
probe of MBSs, providing a clear route to distinguish them from trivial
zero-energy states in hybrid superconducting platforms.

Collective modes capture the dynamical aspects of fractional quantum Hall
(FQH) fluids. Depending on the active degrees of freedom, different types of
collective modes can arise in a FQH state. In this work, we consider spinful
FQH states in the lowest Landau level (LLL) along the Jain sequence of fillings
$\nu{=}n/(2n{\pm}1)$ and compute the Coulomb dispersion of their spin-flip and
spin-conserving collective modes in the spherical geometry. We use the
LLL-projected density-wave and composite fermion (CF) exciton states as trial
wave functions for these modes. To evaluate the dispersion of density-wave
states, we derive the commutation algebra of spinful LLL-projected density
operators on the sphere, which enables us to extract the gap of the
density-wave excitations from the numerically computed density-density
correlation function, i.e., the static structure factor, of the FQH ground
state. We find that the CF excitons provide an accurate description of the
collective modes at all wavelengths, while the density-wave states fail to do
so. Specifically, the spin-flip density wave reliably captures the spin-flip
collective mode only for the Laughlin and Halperin states, and that too only in
the long-wavelength limit. Interestingly, for spin-singlet primary Jain states,
the spin-conserving density mode is inaccurate even in the long-wavelength
regime. We show that this discrepancy stems from the presence of an additional
high-energy spin-conserving parton mode, similar to that found in fully
polarized secondary Jain states at $\nu{=}n/(4n{\pm}1)$. We propose an ansatz
for this parton mode and compute its Coulomb dispersion in the singlet state at
$\nu{=}2/5$. The predicted parton mode can be observed in circularly polarized
inelastic light scattering experiments.

### Structural and Electrocatalytic Properties of La-Co-Ni Oxide Thin Films

- **TL;DR**: La-Co-Ni氧化物薄膜材料库通过组合溅射制备，研究发现钙钛矿/尖晶石两相区域具有最高的OER电催化活性，其中La11Co20Ni9O60在1.8V vs RHE下达到2.24 mA/cm²的最高电流密度。

La-Co-Ni oxides were fabricated in the form of thin-film materials libraries
by combinatorial reactive co-sputtering and analyzed for structural and
functional properties over large compositional ranges: normalized to the metals
of the film they span about 0 - 70 at.-% for Co, 18 - 81 at.-% for La and 11 -
25 at.-% for Ni. Composition-dependent phase analysis shows formation of three
areas with different phase constitutions in dependance of Co-content: In the
La-rich region with low Co content, a mixture of the phases La2O3, perovskite,
and La(OH)3 is observed. In the Co-rich region, perovskite and spinel phases
form. Between the three-phase region and the Co-rich two-phase region, a
single-phase perovskite region emerges. Surface microstructure analysis shows
formation of additional crystallites on the surface in the two-phase area,
which become more numerous with increasing Ni-content. Energy-dispersive X-ray
analysis indicates that these crystallites mainly contain Co and Ni, so they
could be spinels growing on the surface. The analysis of the oxygen evolution
reaction (OER) electrocatalytic activity over all compositions and phase
constitutions reveals that the perovskite/spinel two-phase region shows the
highest catalytic activity, which increases with higher Ni-content. The highest
OER current density was measured as 2.24 mA/cm2 at 1.8 V vs. RHE for the
composition La11Co20Ni9O60.

### Band geometric transverse current driven by inhomogeneous AC electric field

We develop a semiclassical theory for electron wavepacket dynamics in the
presence of an inhomogeneous AC electric field. While static electric-field
gradients are known to generate charge transport governed by the quantum
metric, we show that AC field gradients induce an additional geometric current
that vanishes in the DC limit. This response originates from a novel
band-geometric quantity, the higher-order connection (HOC) tensor, constructed
from cubic products of interband Berry connections. We derive explicit
expressions for the AC current and identify the symmetry conditions under which
it arises. Remarkably, inhomogeneous AC fields can generate an anomalous
Hall-like response even in nonmagnetic systems. Applying the theory to
Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene, we demonstrate that the HOC-induced response
produces a measurable Hall current peaking at band edges. These results
establish inhomogeneous AC fields as a powerful probe of higher-order band
geometric quantities beyond Berry curvature and the quantum metric.

### Origin of Reverse Size Effect in Ferroelectric Hafnia Thin Films

The persistence of ferroelectricity in ultrathin HfO$_2$ films challenges
conventional theories, particularly given the paradoxical observation that the
out-of-plane lattice spacing increases with decreasing thickness. We resolve
this puzzle by revealing that this anomalous lattice expansion is
counterintuitively coupled to suppressed out-of-plane polarization.
First-principles calculations combined with analytical modeling identify two
mechanisms behind this expansion: a negative longitudinal piezoelectric
response to the residual depolarization field and a positive surface stress
that becomes significant at reduced thickness. Their interplay quantitatively
reproduces the experimentally observed lattice expansion. Furthermore,
(111)-oriented HfO$_2$ films can support out-of-plane polarization even under
open-circuit conditions, in contrast to (001) films that stabilize a nonpolar
ground state. This behavior points to the emergence of orientation-induced
hyperferroelectricity, an unrecognized mechanism that enables polarization
persistence through orientation engineering without electrode screening. The
principle also extends to perovskite ferroelectrics, offering a strategy to
eliminate critical thickness limits by selecting appropriate film orientations.

### Odd-parity longitudinal magnetoconductivity in time-reversal symmetry broken materials

- **TL;DR**: 本文发现并理论解释了磁性材料中存在的奇宇称磁导率(OMC)现象，即在时间反演对称性破缺的材料中，纵向磁导率会出现线性依赖于磁场的奇函数响应，这为探测量子材料中的对称性和电子结构提供了新的敏感探针。

Magnetotransport measurements are a sensitive probe of symmetry and
electronic structure in quantum materials. While conventional metals exhibit
longitudinal magnetoconductivity that is even in a magnetic field ($B$) for
small $B$, we show that magnetic materials which intrinsically break
time-reversal symmetry (TRS) show an {\it odd-parity magnetoconductivity}
(OMC), with a leading linear-$B$ response. Using semiclassical transport
theory, we derive explicit expressions for the longitudinal and transverse
conductivities and identify their origin in Berry curvature and orbital
magnetic moment. Crystalline symmetry analysis shows that longitudinal OMC
follows the same point-group constraints as the anomalous Hall effect, while
transverse OMC obeys distinct rules, providing an independent probe of TRS
breaking. In the large $B$ quantum oscillation regime, we uncover both odd- and
even-$B$ contributions, demonstrating OMC beyond the semiclassical picture.
Explicit calculations in valley-polarized gapped graphene show that OMC peaks
near the band edges, vanish in the band gap and follow the temperature
dependence of the magnetic order parameter. Our results explain the odd-parity
magnetoresistance recently observed in magnetized graphene and establish OMC as
a robust transport signature of intrinsic TRS breaking in metals.

### Structural effects of boron doping in diamond crystals for gamma-ray light-source applications: Insights from molecular dynamics simulations

- **TL;DR**: 通过分子动力学模拟研究硼掺杂金刚石晶体的结构畸变，发现晶格常数和晶面间距与硼浓度呈线性关系，但偏离Vegard定律，为伽马射线晶体光源设计提供重要参考

Boron-doped diamond crystals (BDD, C$_{1-x}$B$_{x}$) exhibit exceptional
mechanical strength, electronic tunability, and resistance to radiation damage.
This makes them promising materials for use in gamma-ray crystal-based light
sources. To better understand and quantify the structural distortions
introduced by doping, which are critical for maintaining channelling
efficiency, we perform atomistic-level molecular dynamics simulations on
periodic C$_{1-x}$B$_{x}$ systems of various sizes. These simulations allow the
influence of boron concentration on the lattice constant and the (110) and
(100) inter-planar distances to be evaluated over the concentration range from
pure diamond (0%) to 5% boron at room temperature (300 K). Linear relationships
between both lattice constant and inter-planar distance with increasing dopant
concentration are observed, with a deviation from Vegard's Law. This deviation
is larger than that reported by other theoretical and computational studies;
however, this may be attributed to an enhanced crystal quality over these
studies, a vital aspect when considering gamma-ray crystal light source design.
The methodology presented here incorporates several refinements to closely
reflect the conditions of microwave plasma chemical vapour deposition (MPCVD)
crystal growth. Validation of the methodology is provided through a
comprehensive statistical analysis of the structure of our generated crystals.
These results enable reliable atomistic modelling of doped diamond crystals and
support their use in the design and fabrication of periodically bent structures
for next-generation gamma-ray light source technologies.

Recent advances in machine learning (ML) have accelerated progress in
calibrating and operating quantum dot (QD) devices. However, most ML approaches
rely on access to large, high-quality labeled datasets for training,
benchmarking, and validation, with labels capturing key features in the data.
Obtaining such datasets experimentally is challenging due to limited data
availability and the labor-intensive nature of labeling. QDFlow is an
open-source physics simulator for multi-QD arrays that generates realistic
synthetic data with ground-truth labels. QDFlow combines a self-consistent
Thomas-Fermi solver, a dynamic capacitance model, and flexible noise modules to
produce charge stability diagrams and ray-based data closely resembling
experiments. With extensive tunable parameters and customizable noise models,
QDFlow supports the creation of large, diverse datasets for ML development,
benchmarking, and quantum device research.

### Relaxation and Its Effects on Electronic Structure in Twisted Systems: An Analytical Perspective

Lattice relaxation profoundly reshapes electronic structures in twisted
materials. Prevailing treatments, however, typically rely on large-scale
density functional theory (DFT), which is computationally costly and
mechanistically opaque. Here, we develop a unified analytical framework to
overcome these limitations. From continuum elastic theory, we derive
closed-form solutions for both in-plane and out-of-plane relaxation fields. We
further introduce an analytical phase factor expansion theory that maps
relaxation into the electronic Hamiltonian. By applying this framework, the
relaxation-mediated single-particle and many-body topological phase transitions
in twisted MoTe$_{2}$ is accurately captured, and the evolution of flat bands
in magic-angle graphene is quantitatively reproduced. Our work transforms the
research of moir\'e relaxation from black-box numerical fitting to an
analytical paradigm, offering fundamental insights, exceptional efficiency, and
general applicability to a wide range of twisted materials.

- **TL;DR**: 本文通过第一性原理计算揭示了应变调控NiX₂单层磁电耦合和自旋驱动极化的机制，发现双轴和单轴应变通过两种不同途径精确控制材料中的自旋诱导电极化。

Using \textit{ab initio} methodology, we reveal a strain-mediated approach to
precisely tune the magnetoelectric coupling and spin-driven emergent
polarization of NiX$_2$ (X = I, Br) monolayers. In the absence of strain, these
systems spontaneously stabilize non-collinear spin states that break the
inversion symmetry, inducing a ferroelectric polarization in the plane of the
material. We show that biaxial and uniaxial strains broadly modulate the
magnetoelectric response in these materials through two distinct mechanisms:
(i) direct modification of the magnetoelectric tensor components, and (ii)
tuning of the characteristic propagation vectors of a spin texture. This dual
mechanism enables precise control over the magnitude of the spin-induced
electric polarization of these materials. With respect to the achievable
magnitude of the electric polarization, we demonstrate the critical role of
third-nearest-neighbor spin-pair contributions, which can increase under strain
to levels that compete with or even exceed the polarization driven by
first-nearest-neighbor effects. These findings offer important insights into
low-dimensional piezo-magnetoelectricity and expand the possibilities for
designing multifunctional two-dimensional straintronic devices.

Silver chromate ($\mathrm{Ag_{2}CrO_{4}}$) has attracted considerable
attention in recent years due to its promising photocatalytic performance,
which strongly depends on the crystallographic orientation of its exposed
surfaces. A detailed understanding of the structural stability of these
surfaces under realistic conditions is therefore essential for advancing its
applications. In this work, we combine density functional theory (DFT) with
first-principles atomistic thermodynamics to systematically investigate the
stability of multiple surface orientations and terminations of
$\mathrm{Ag_{2}CrO_{4}}$. The surface Gibbs free energy was evaluated as a
function of oxygen and silver chemical potentials, enabling the construction of
stability trends under non-vacuum environments. Our results reveal that the
degree of coordination of surface chromium-oxygen clusters plays a decisive
role in determining surface stability. Furthermore, Wulff constructions predict
morphology evolution as a function of external conditions, allowing us to
identify the atomic structures of the exposed facets in the equilibrium crystal
shape. These insights provide a fundamental framework for understanding
surface-dependent photocatalytic activity in $\mathrm{Ag_{2}CrO_{4}}$ and
related silver-based oxides.

Strain provides a powerful knob to tailor the electronic properties of
semiconductors. Simple yet accurate approximations that capture strain effects
in demanding simulations of mesoscopic nanostructures are therefore highly
desirable. However, for III-V compounds, key materials for quantum
applications, such approaches remain comparatively underdeveloped. In this
work, we derive a compact, effective Hamiltonian that describes the conduction
band of zincblende III-V semiconductors incorporating strain effects. Starting
from the eight-band k$\cdot$p model with Bir-Pikus corrections, we perform a
folding-down procedure to obtain analytical expressions for conduction-band
strain-renormalized parameters, including the effective mass, chemical
potential, spin-orbit coupling, and $g$-factor. The model reproduces full
multiband results under small to moderate strain, while retaining a form
suitable for device-scale calculations. We benchmark the model for bulk
deformations and apply it to representative nanostructures, such as core.shell
nanowires and planar heterostructures. Our results provide a practical and
versatile tool for incorporating strain into the design of III-V semiconductor
devices, enabling reliable predictions of their properties with direct
implications for spintronic, straintronic, optoelectronic, and topological
quantum technologies.

Two-dimensional (2D) materials with large spin Hall effect (SHE) have
attracted significant attention due to their potential applications in
next-generation spintronic devices. In this work, we perform high-throughput
(HTP) calculations to obtain the spin Hall conductivity (SHC) of 4486
non-magnetic compounds in the \texttt{2Dmatpedia} database and identify six
materials with SHC exceeding $500\,(\hbar/e)\,(\mathrm{S/cm})$, surpassing
those of previously known materials. Detailed analysis reveals that the
significant SHC can be attributed to spin-orbit coupling (SOC)-induced gap
openings at Dirac-like band crossings. Additionally, the presence of mirror
symmetry further enhances the SHC. Beyond the high-SHC materials, 57
topological insulators with quantized SHCs have also been identified. Our work
enables rapid screening and paves the way for experimental validation,
potentially accelerating the discovery of novel 2D materials optimized for
spintronics applications.
