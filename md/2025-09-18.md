- **TL;DR**: 本研究比较了五种不同线轴配置（矩形、半圆形、锥形、I型和H型）对磁流变离合器扭矩传递能力的影响，发现H型线轴提供最大扭矩传递能力，而锥形线轴效果最差。

Magneto-Rheological (MR) fluid based devices work on the principle of
changing the rheological properties of MR fluid (MRF) using magnetic field
excitation generated from an electromagnet. The electromagnet is usually
created with the aid of copper coils wound on a low magnetic permeable spindle
structure referred to as bobbin. In this paper, an attempt has been made to
investigate the different bobbin configurations and its effect on the torque
transmissibility of a MR clutch (MRC). A hybrid corrugated-plane type
transmission surface MRC is chosen for the study, due to the advantage of
enhanced transmission capability due to the simultaneous existence of plane and
corrugated extensions on the disc surface. This enhanced transmission
capability, resulting from the hybrid corrugated plane type transmission
surface facilitates mama,. BB vg BBC gg of the influence of bobbin
configuration on the torque transmission capability in an MRC. A comparative
analysis using COMSOL Multiphysics software is carried out between five
different innovative bobbin configurations such as rectangular, semi-circular,
conical, I-sectioned and H-sectioned. This study aims to simulate and reason
the variations in the magnetic field line characteristics upon variations in
bobbin topography. The results obtained testify for the need of a bobbin design
taking into account the transmission surface geometry. For the specific design
analyzed, it was found that the H-sectioned bobbin provided the maximum torque
transmission capability when compared with other topographies, whereas the
conical shaped bobbin topography proved to be least facilitating for torque
transmission.

- **TL;DR**: DeFINO是一种基于导数信息的神经算子训练框架，通过Fisher信息矩阵指导Jacobian投影，显著降低计算成本，同时保持梯度精度和流体动力学预测能力

Neural operators have emerged as cost-effective surrogates for expensive
fluid-flow simulators, particularly in computationally intensive tasks such as
permeability inversion from time-lapse seismic data, and uncertainty
quantification. In these applications, the fidelity of the surrogate's
gradients with respect to system parameters is crucial, as the accuracy of
downstream tasks, such as optimization and Bayesian inference, relies directly
on the quality of the derivative information. Recent advances in
physics-informed methods have leveraged derivative information to improve
surrogate accuracy. However, incorporating explicit Jacobians can become
computationally prohibitive, as the complexity typically scales quadratically
with the number of input parameters. To address this limitation, we propose
DeFINO (Derivative-based Fisher-score Informed Neural Operator), a
reduced-order, derivative-informed training framework. DeFINO integrates
Fourier neural operators (FNOs) with a novel derivative-based training strategy
guided by the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM). By projecting Jacobians onto
dominant eigen-directions identified by the FIM, DeFINO captures critical
sensitivity information directly informed by observational data, significantly
reducing computational expense. We validate DeFINO through synthetic
experiments in the context of subsurface multi-phase fluid-flow, demonstrating
improvements in gradient accuracy while maintaining robust forward predictions
of underlying fluid dynamics. These results highlight DeFINO's potential to
offer practical, scalable solutions for inversion problems in complex
real-world scenarios, all at substantially reduced computational cost.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种通过外加电场驱动偶极分子转子连续旋转的方案，使用金属原子将转子固定在石墨烯上，通过计算模拟验证了在0.5 V/Å的矩形交变电场下可实现2.96 ps周期的旋转

We propose a scheme for driving a dipolar molecular rotor to rotate
continuously by applying an external electric field: the dipolar rotor is fixed
on a graphene sheet via a metal atom to facilitate the free rotation; it is in
the meantime subjected to an electric field oriented parallel to the graphene
sheet. We use computational modeling with density functional theory and
Newtonian mechanics, similar to molecular dynamics simulations, to obtain the
torque, angular velocity, and rotation period of the rotor. Our results show
that the dipolar rotor designed here can rotate with a period of 2.96 ps by an
alternating rectangular electric field with a strength of 0.5 V/{\AA}. However,
a cosine wave alternating electric field depending on time cannot drive the
dipolar rotor to rotate regularly. Therefore, a cosine wave electric field
depending on the rotation angle is suggested, as it can not only drive the
rotor but also produce additional power. Machine learning molecular dynamics
(MLMD) simulations further confirm that the rotor remains thermodynamically
stable under an electric field. This work reveals the rotation mechanism of a
dipolar molecular rotor in a transverse electric field, and we hope this work
can open a new path for designing more diverse molecular machines in
experiments.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究开发了一个机器学习框架，利用元素描述符预测高熵合金的硬度，通过LightGBM等模型训练实验数据，并生成900多万个虚拟合金候选进行高通量筛选。

The growing need for structural materials with strength, mechanical
stability, and durability in extreme environments is driving the development of
high entropy alloys. These are materials with near equiatomic mixing of five or
more principal elements, and such compositional complexity often leads to
improvements in mechanical properties and high thermal stability, etc. Thus,
high-entropy alloys have found their applications in domains like aerospace,
biomedical, energy storage, catalysis, electronics, etc. However, the vast
compositional design and experimental exploration of high-entropy alloys are
both time consuming and expensive and require a large number of resources.
Machine learning techniques have thus become essential for accelerating high
entropy alloys discovery using data driven predictions of promising alloy
combinations and their properties. Hence, this work employs a machine learning
framework that predicts high entropy alloy hardness from elemental descriptors
such as atomic radius, valence electron count, bond strength, etc. Machine
learning regression models, like LightGBM, Gradient Boosting Regressor, and
Transformer encoder, were trained on experimental data. Additionally, a
language model was also fine tuned to predict hardness from elemental
descriptor strings. The results indicate that LightGBM has better accuracy in
predicting the hardness of high entropy alloys compared to other models used in
this study. Further, a combinatorial technique was used to generate over 9
million virtual high entropy alloy candidates, and the trained machine learning
models were used to predict their hardness. This study shows how machine
learning-driven high throughput screening and language modelling approaches can
accelerate the development of next generation high entropy alloys.

### Nematic Enhancement of Superconductivity in Multilayer Graphene via Quantum Geometry

- **TL;DR**: 本文发现多层石墨烯中向列序通过增强量子度量来显著提升超导耦合常数，为实验中观察到的向列性与超导性之间的关联提供了微观机制解释。

Multilayer graphene materials have recently emerged as a fascinating
versatile platform for correlated electron phenomena, hosting
superconductivity, fractional quantum Hall states, and correlated insulating
phases. A particularly striking experimental observation is the recurring
correlation between nematicity in the normal state -- manifested by spontaneous
breaking of the underlying $C_3$ symmetry -- and the stabilization of robust
superconducting phases. Despite its ubiquity across different materials,
devices and experiments, this trend has thus far lacked a clear microscopic
explanation. In this work, we identify a concrete mechanism linking nematic
order to enhanced superconductivity. We demonstrate that $C_3$-symmetry
breaking strongly reshapes the Bloch wavefunctions near the Fermi level,
producing a pronounced enhancement and redistribution of the so-called quantum
metric. This effect drastically amplifies superconducting pairing mediated by
the quantum geometric Kohn-Luttinger mechanism [G. Shavit \it{et al.},
\href{https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.134.176001}{Phys.
Rev. Lett. 134, 176001 (2025)}]. Our analysis reveals that nematicity naturally
boosts the superconducting coupling constant in experimentally relevant density
regimes, providing a compelling explanation for observed correlations. These
results establish the central role of geometric effects in graphene
superconductivity and highlight nematicity as a promising avenue for
engineering stronger unconventional superconducting states.

### Tunable Random Telegraph Noise in Stable Perpendicular Magnetic Tunnel Junctions for Unconventional Computing

- **TL;DR**: 本文展示了热稳定垂直磁隧道结(pMTJs)可通过纳秒脉冲驱动产生可调谐的随机行为，实现了可控的随机电报噪声，为概率计算、神经形态计算等新兴计算范式提供了多功能平台。

We demonstrate that thermally stable perpendicular magnetic tunnel junctions
(pMTJs), widely used in spin-transfer torque magnetic random-access memory, can
be actuated with nanosecond pulses to exhibit tunable stochastic behavior. This
actuated-stochastic tunnel junction (A-sMTJ) concept produces random telegraph
noise, with control over fluctuation rate and probability bias. The device
response is shown to be consistent with a Poisson process, with fluctuation
rates tunable over more than two orders of magnitude, with average state dwell
times varying from 29 ns to greater than 2.3 microseconds. These results
establish A-sMTJs as a versatile platform for integrating deterministic,
stochastic, and in-memory functionality on a single chip, advancing the
development of probabilistic, neuromorphic, and unconventional computing
systems.

### Exact mid-IR quantum vibrational spectra of neutral water clusters

- **TL;DR**: 使用选择性组态相互作用计算水单体、二聚体、三聚体和六聚体的中红外振动光谱，引入基于响应向量法的新光谱计算方法

We use selected configuration interaction to calculate the zero-temperature
mid-infrared (2800-3800 cm$^{-1}$) vibrational spectra of a water monomer,
dimer, trimer, and hexamer in its cage and prism geometries. We use the
recently introduced, accurate q-AQUA-pol potential energy surface along with
the n-mode representation of the potential to facilitate grid-based quadrature
and integral storage. Within selected configuration interaction, we introduce a
new approach to the calculation of spectra that is complementary to eigenstate
enumeration. In the new approach, we calculate the spectrum using the
response-vector method, and the system of linear equations is solved using a
basis of configurations that are optimally selected at each frequency of
interest. We compare our spectra to previous studies, and highlight limitations
of the local monomer approximation. To the best of our knowledge, our hexamer
spectra are the most accurate ones reported to date.

### Sandpiles with finite-range interactions

- **TL;DR**: 本文研究了具有汤川型相互作用的沙堆模型，发现特定相互作用范围R下系统会出现跨越系统的巨型雪崩和渗流现象，概率变化呈现两种不同机制，并提出了分层渗流模型。

We investigate the sandpile model with Yukawa-type interactions, whose
effective range is tuned by an external parameter $R$. Our results reveal that
at specific values of $R$, the system exhibits giant avalanches that span the
system, leading to percolation. The probability of such giant avalanches
demonstrates two distinct regimes as a function of $R$: for sufficiently small
$R$, it increases monotonically, whereas for large $R$ it undergoes threshold
dynamics, so that at certain values of $R$, the percolation probability
exhibits abrupt jumps. We refer it to as \textit{pseudo-percolation
transitions}, based on which we propose a hierarchical percolation model at the
mean-field level: each percolation transition corresponds to percolation within
a disc of radius $R$. We further examine both local and global geometrical
observables. The local quantities include avalanche size, mass, and duration
and sub-avalanche mass, while for the global characterization we analyze the
loop length and gyration radius of the external perimeter, as well as the mass
of sub-avalanches. Remarkably, all these observables exhibit power-law scaling
for all values of $R$, with exponents that vary systematically with $R$.
Notably, in the vicinity of the pseudo-percolation transition points, the
exponents approach characteristic values, signaling a distinct critical
behavior.

### Proximity Ferroelectricity in Compositionally Graded Structures

- **TL;DR**: 邻近铁电性是一种通过将非铁电极性材料（如AlN或ZnO）与可切换铁电层（如Al1-xScxN或Zn1-xMgxO）接触，使其成为可实际切换铁电体的新方法。通过成分梯度结构，可以在低于电击穿场的矫顽场下实现整个系统的极化切换。

Proximity ferroelectricity is a novel paradigm for inducing ferroelectricity
in a non-ferroelectric polar material such as AlN or ZnO that are typically
unswitchable with an external field below their dielectric breakdown field.
When placed in direct contact with a thin switchable ferroelectric layer (such
as Al1-xScxN or Zn1-xMgxO), they become a practically switchable ferroelectric.
Using the thermodynamic Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire theory, in this work we
performed the finite element modeling of the polarization switching in the
compositionally graded AlN-Al1-xScxN, ZnO-Zn1-xMgxO and MgO-Zn1-xMgxO
structures sandwiched in both a parallel-plate capacitor geometry as well as in
a sharp probe-planar electrode geometry. We reveal that the compositionally
graded structure allows the simultaneous switching of spontaneous polarization
in the whole system by a coercive field significantly lower than the electric
breakdown field of unswitchable polar materials. The physical mechanism is the
depolarization electric field determined by the gradient of chemical
composition "x". The field lowers the steepness of the switching barrier in the
otherwise unswitchable parts of the compositionally graded AlN-Al1-xScxN and
ZnO-Zn1-xMgxO structures, while it induces a shallow double-well free energy
potential in the MgO-like regions of compositionally graded MgO-Zn1-xMgxO
structure. Proximity ferroelectric switching of the compositionally graded
structures placed in the probe-electrode geometry occurs due to nanodomain
formation under the tip. We predict that a gradient of chemical composition "x"
significantly lowers effective coercive fields of the compositionally graded
AlN-Al1-xScxN and ZnO-Zn1-xMgxO structures compared to the coercive fields of
the corresponding multilayers with a uniform chemical composition in each
layer.

### From Quantum Tsallis Entropy to Strange Metals

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一个统一框架，将量子Tsallis统计与强相互作用系统中的电子输运联系起来，通过q变形参数在费米液体和非费米液体行为之间提供可控插值。

We develop a unified framework connecting quantum Tsallis statistics to
electronic transport in strongly interacting systems. Starting from R\'enyi and
Tsallis entropies, we construct a quantum Tsallis distribution that reduces to
the conventional Fermi--Dirac distribution when $q=1$. For $q$ slightly
deviating from unity, the correction term in the occupation function can be
mapped to a $q$-deformed Schwarzian action, corresponding to soft
reparametrization modes. Coupling these soft modes to electrons via the Fermi
Golden Rule yields a modified scattering rate, which reproduces conventional
Fermi-liquid behavior at low temperatures and linear-in-temperature resistivity
at high temperatures. Using the memory matrix formalism, we analyze
magnetotransport, finding a linear-in-field magnetoresistance and a Hall angle
consistent with Anderson's two-lifetime scenario. At sufficiently low
temperatures, both magnetoresistance and Hall response smoothly recover
Fermi-liquid quadratic behaviors. This approach provides a controlled
interpolation between Fermi-liquid and non-Fermi-liquid regimes, quantitatively
linking $q$-deformation, soft-mode dynamics, and experimentally measurable
transport coefficients in strange metals.

### Valley-Selective Linear Dichroism and Excitonic Effects in Lieb-Lattice Altermagnets

Altermagnets have recently been recognized as a distinct class of magnetic
materials characterized by alternative spin-split electronic structures without
net magnetization. Despite intensive studies on their single-particle
spintronic and valleytronic properties, many-electron interactions and optical
responses of altermagnets remain less explored. In this work, we employ
many-body perturbation theory to investigate excited states and their strain
tunability. Using monolayer Mn2WS4 as a representative candidate, we uncover a
novel spin valley-dependent excitonic selection rule in two-dimensional
altermagnetic Lieb lattices. In addition to strongly bound excitons, we find
that linearly polarized light selectively excites valley spin-polarized
excitons. Moreover, due to the interplay between altermagnetic spin symmetry
and electronic orbital character, we predict that applying uniaxial strain can
lift valley degeneracy and enable the selective excitation of spin-polarized
excitons, an effect not achievable in previously studied transition-metal
dichalcogenides. These spin-valley-locked excitonic states and their strain
tunability offer a robust mechanism for four-fold symmetric altermagnets to
encode, store, and read valley/spin information.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究通过时间依赖的Ginzburg-Landau理论，将氢化物耗散理论扩展到亚表面氢化物，发现亚表面氢化物是导致高场Q斜率(HFQS)行为的原因，并提出了通过杂质掺杂控制氢化物尺寸和深度来消除HFQS的方法。

Research linking surface hydrides to Q-disease, and the subsequent
development of methods to eliminate surface hydrides, is one of the great
successes of SRF cavity R&D. We use time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau to extend
the theory of hydride dissipation to sub-surface hydrides. Just as surface
hydrides cause Q-disease behavior, we show that sub-surface hydrides cause
high-field Q-slope (HFQS) behavior. We find that the abrupt onset of HFQS is
due to a transition from a vortex-free state to a vortex-penetration state. We
show that controlling hydride size and depth through impurity doping can
eliminate HFQS.

### Superparamagnetic and Stochastic-Write Magnetic Tunnel Junctions for High-Speed True Random Number Generation in Advanced Computing

- **TL;DR**: 本文综述了两种基于磁隧道结(MTJ)的真随机数生成器(TRNG)技术：超顺磁MTJ(sMTJ)和随机写入MTJ(SW-MTJ)，分别适用于高性能计算和边缘设备应用。

We review two magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) approaches for compact,
low-power, CMOS-integrated true random number generation (TRNG). The first
employs passive-read, easy-plane superparamagnetic MTJs (sMTJs) that generate
thermal-fluctuation-driven bit streams at $0.5$--$1$~Gb/s per device. The
second uses MTJs with magnetically stable free layers, operated with stochastic
write pulses to achieve switching probabilities of about $0.5$ (\emph{i.e.},
write error rates of $\simeq 0.5$), achieving $\gtrsim 0.1$~Gb/s per device; we
refer to these as stochastic-write MTJs (SW-MTJs). Randomness from both
approaches has been validated using the NIST~SP800 test suites. The sMTJ
approach uses a read-only cell with low power and can be compatible with most
advanced CMOS nodes, while SW-MTJs leverage standard CMOS MTJ process flows,
enabling co-integration with embedded spin-transfer torque magnetic random
access memory (STT-MRAM). Both approaches can achieve deep sub-0.01~$\mu$m$^2$
MTJ footprints and offer orders-of-magnitude better energy efficiency than
CPU/GPU-based generators, enabling placement near logic for high-throughput
random bit-streams for probabilistic computing, statistical modeling, and
cryptography. In terms of performance, sMTJs generally suit applications
requiring very high data-rate random bits near logic processors, such as
probabilistic computing or large-scale statistical modeling. By contrast,
SW-MTJs are an attractive option for edge-oriented microcontrollers, providing
entropy sources for computing or cryptographic enhancement. We highlight the
strengths, limitations, and integration challenges of each approach,
emphasizing the need to reduce device-to-device variability in sMTJs --
particularly by mitigating magnetostriction-induced in-plane anisotropy -- and
to improve temporal stability in SW-MTJs for robust, large-scale deployment.

### Evolution of surfactant-free 'pristine' emulsions

- **TL;DR**: 本研究监测了无表面活性剂的水油乳状液（pristine interface）形成初期的动力学过程，发现在开放和封闭系统中乳化行为存在显著差异，CO2吸附和碳酸根离子对乳液形成和液滴带电界面至关重要

The term pristine interface was introduced by Beattie and Djerdjev 20 years
ago for emulsions that consist of only water and oil with no surfactant. They
are different from Pickering emulsions, which are also surfactant-free but
stabilized with colloidal particles. In contrast to previous studies, we
monitor the kinetics of the initial stages of emulsion formation. We conducted
such tests in an open setup when samples are open to air and CO2 content in the
water varies, and in closed setup when samples are isolated with fixed CO2
content. For the open setup, sonication and initial pH &gt; 9 leads to emulsions
with high zeta potential and sub-micron droplet size. There are two evolution
patterns: short- and long-terms. The short term lasts about 1 day and has
changing pH and zeta potential, but almost constant droplet size. The long term
is is over several days or even weeks, with droplet size increase toward
saturation value (rate dependent on mixing conditions), with pH and zeta
potential remaining constant. Emulsification at the closed setup is much less
pronounced and pH remains constant. This difference points to the importance of
adsorbed CO2 and related carbonate ions in the formation of pristine emulsions
and charging droplets interfaces. We hypothesize the existence of structured
water molecule layer at the interface, following Eastoe and Ellis. The Electric
Double Layer exerts a (dielectrostatic) force on the water dipole moments in
this layer that compensates the Kelvins pressure. The droplet size from this
model is close to our measurements. Also, there is a repulsion of the water
dipole moments, which compensates for the surface tension parallel to the
interface. After ruling out alternative hypotheses with our data, we conclude
that the model suggested for explaining the stability of nano-bubbles is also
consistent with our results for these pristine emulsions.

- **TL;DR**: 本文提出了一个信息论框架来研究神经可塑性在不同时间尺度上如何优化神经信息编码和计算功能，发现长期可塑性引导神经活动达到最优信息编码状态，短期可塑性支持时序序列识别。

Neural circuits exhibit remarkable computational flexibility, enabling
adaptive responses to noisy and ever-changing environmental cues. A fundamental
question in neuroscience concerns how a wide range of behaviors can emerge from
a relatively limited set of underlying biological mechanisms. In particular,
the interaction between activities of neuronal populations and plasticity
modulation of synaptic connections may endow neural circuits with a variety of
functional responses when coordinated over different characteristic timescales.
Here, we develop an information-theoretic framework to quantitatively explore
this idea. We consider a stochastic model for neural activities that
incorporates the presence of a coupled dynamic plasticity and time-varying
stimuli. We show that long-term plasticity modulations play the functional role
of steering neural activities towards a regime of optimal information encoding.
By constructing the associated phase diagram, we demonstrate that either
Hebbian or anti-Hebbian plasticity may become optimal strategies depending on
how the external input is projected to the target neural populations.
Conversely, short-term plasticity enables the discrimination of temporal
ordering in sequences of inputs by navigating the emergent multistable
attractor landscape. By allowing a degree of variability in external stimuli,
we also highlight the existence of an optimal variability for sequence
discrimination at a given plasticity strength. In summary, the timescale of
plasticity modulation shapes how inputs are represented in neural activities,
thereby fundamentally altering the computational properties of the system. Our
approach offers a unifying information-theoretic perspective of the role of
plasticity, paving the way for a quantitative understanding of the emergence of
complex computations in coupled neuronal-synaptic dynamics.

Conventional topological Hall effects (THE) require conducting magnets,
leaving insulating systems largely inaccessible. Here we introduce the
interfacial topological Hall effect (ITHE), where the noncoplanar spin textures
of insulating magnets are imprinted onto an adjacent heavy metal via the
magnetic proximity effect (MPE) and detected electrically. In Pt/h-LuFeO3
bilayers, h-LuFeO3 hosts a topological spin structure robust against high
magnetic fields, arising from a 120{\deg} triangular spin lattice with small
spin canting that yields nontrivial topology but minimal magnetization. This
generates a giant Hall response in Pt up to 0.5% of the longitudinal
resistivity and a Hall-conductivity/magnetization ratio above 2 V^{-1}, clearly
distinguishable from the spin Hall Hanle effect background. Field- and
temperature-dependent analysis further reveals that Pt nanoclusters inherit
topological textures from h-LuFeO3 via MPE. Unlike the conventional THE narrow
peak-and-dip features, ITHE in Pt/h-LuFeO3 persists across a broad magnetic
field range up to 14 T, demonstrating the exceptional stability of the
underlying topological spin structure. This establishes ITHE as a powerful and
sensitive probe for topological magnetism in ultrathin insulating films and
paves the way for new spintronic applications.

Thermalization in isolated quantum systems is governed by the eigenstate
thermalization hypothesis, while strong disorder can induce its breakdown via
many-body localization. Here we show that disorder can also generate a narrow
band of thermal eigenstates embedded in an otherwise non-thermal spectrum. We
illustrate this generic mechanism using paradigmatic spin-1 models, including
Heisenberg, XY, and Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) models with several
types of disorder. By analyzing their level statistics, entanglement properties
and quench dynamics, we show that the disorder-induced states are genuinely
thermal and we trace their origin to the null space of the disorder term in the
Hamiltonian. Our results demonstrate that disorder can give rise to an
unexpected coexistence of thermal and non-thermal dynamics within the same
many-body spectrum.

### Axial Hall Effect in Altermagnetic Lieb Lattices

We predict a so-called axial Hall effect, a Berry-curvature-driven anomalous
Hall response, in Lieb-lattice altermagnets. By constructing a tight-binding
model, we identify the axial direction as a hidden topological degree of
freedom. Breaking the double degeneracy of axial symmetry generates substantial
Berry curvature and induces a pronounced anomalous Hall conductivity.
First-principles calculations further confirm the emergence of this effect in
strained altermagnets, particularly in ternary transition-metal
dichalcogenides. We take Mn2WS4 as an example to reveal that the axial Hall
effect originates from the interplay between Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling
and the intrinsic piezomagnetic response of Lieb-lattice altermagnets, leading
to highly localized and enhanced Berry curvature. Remarkably, the magnitude of
the axial Hall effect is significant and remains unchanged when varying the
strain, highlighting the topological nature of the axial degree of freedom.
Finally, in multilayer systems, the effect manifests as a distinctive
thickness-dependent modulation of both anomalous and spin Hall responses. These
findings emphasize the critical role of spin-orbit coupling and noncollinear
spin textures in altermagnets, an area that has received limited attention, and
open new pathways for exploring intrinsic Hall phenomena in topological
magnetic systems.

### Optimally Tensile Strained La3Ni2O7 Films as Candidate High-Temperature Superconductors on Designer Ba1-xSrxO (001) and SrO-SrTiO3 Substrates

Recent experiments have observed superconductivity up to 48 K in
La3Ni2O7-derived films under compressive strain imposed by the SrLaAlO4
substrate, while such films on the SrTiO3 substrate with tensile strain have
failed to reach the superconducting state. Here we propose to broadly expand
the choices of materials platforms to achieve high-Tc superconducting La3Ni2O7
films by proposing designer substrates of Ba1-xSrxO (x = 0 - 1) that allow to
continuously tune the strain in the films from being tensile to compressive.
Our systematic study of the structural and electronic reconstructions of the
strained La3Ni2O7 bilayer film leads to the central finding that at the optimal
tensile strain of ~2% (x ~0.25), the spectral weight of the Ni dz2 orbital is
peaked right at the Fermi level, and its hybridization with the Ni dx2-y2
orbital is substantially enhanced. Consequently, the expected Tc should be
unprecedentedly high, at least substantially higher than those achieved in the
compressive regime. Furthermore, our detailed thickness-dependent energetic
analyses show that such films can be stably grown for thicknesses equal to or
beyond the bilayer regime, and predict that the SrO-terminated SrTiO3 should
also be able to stabilize the films with optimal tensile strain and higher
Tc's.

### Bilayer graphene quantum dots as a quantum simulator of Haldane topological quantum matter

- **TL;DR**: 双层石墨烯量子点链可模拟自旋1链并实现Haldane拓扑相，通过精确对角化方法研究多电子关联态，证明其作为量子模拟器的潜力

We demonstrate here that a chain of Bilayer Graphene Quantum Dots (BLGQD) can
realize topological quantum matter by effectively simulating a spin-1 chain
that hosts the Haldane phase within a specific range of parameters. We describe
a chain of BLGQD with two electrons each using an atomistic tight-binding model
combined with the exact diagonalization technique to solve the interacting
few-electron problem. Coulomb interactions and valley mixing effects are
treated within the same microscopic framework, allowing us to systematically
investigate spin and valley polarization transitions as functions of
interaction strength and external tuning parameters. We calculate the low
energy states for single and double QDs as a function of the number of
electrons, identifying regimes of highly correlated multi-electron states. We
confirm the presence of a spin-one ground state for two electrons. Then, we
explore two coupled QDs with 4 electrons and extend the analysis to QD arrays.
Using a mapping of the BLGQD chain to an effective bilinear-biquadratic (BLBQ)
spin model, we demonstrate that BLGQD arrays can work as a quantum simulator
for one-dimensional spin chains with emergent many-body topological phases.

The electric double layer (EDL) governs electrocatalysis, energy conversion,
and storage, yet its atomic structure, capacitance, and reactivity remain
elusive. Here we introduce a machine learning interatomic potential framework
that incorporates long-range electrostatics, enabling nanosecond simulations of
metal-electrolyte interfaces under applied electric bias with
near-quantum-mechanical accuracy. At the benchmark Pt(111)/water and
Pt(111)/aqueous KF electrolyte interfaces, we resolve the molecular structure
of the EDL, reveal proton-transfer mechanisms underlying anodic water
dissociation and the diffusion of ionic water species, and compute differential
capacitance. We find that the nominally inert K+ and F- ions, while leaving
interfacial water structure largely unchanged, screen bulk fields, slow proton
transfer, and generate a prominent capacitance peak near the potential of zero
charge. These results show that ion-specific interactions, which are ignored in
mean-field models, are central to capacitance and reactivity, providing a
molecular basis for interpreting experiments and designing electrolytes.

- **TL;DR**: 量子力学在低温热输运中的作用：经典模型显示负微分热阻现象，而量子模型则无此现象，热流随温度偏压单调增加

This work aims to understand how quantum mechanics affects heat transport at
low temperatures. In the classical setting, by considering a simple
paradigmatic model, our simulations reveal the emergence of Negative
Differential Thermal Resistance (NDTR): paradoxically, increasing the
temperature bias by lowering the cold bath temperature reduces the steady-state
heat current. In sharp contrast, the quantum version of the model, treated via
a Lindblad master equation, exhibits no NDTR: the heat current increases
monotonically with thermal bias. This marked divergence highlights the
fundamental role of quantum effects in low-temperature thermal transport and
underscores the need to reconsider classical predictions when designing and
optimizing nanoscale thermal devices.

The mechanism behind thermal Hall effects by phonons, which are observed in
various materials, is not clarified despite the dominant contribution as heat
carriers. Theoretically, mechanisms based on the intrinsic Berry phase and
those on extrinsic impurity-induced scatterings have been proposed, which can
be distinguished by comparing the field-angle dependence of the thermal Hall
effect and that of the magnetic anisotropy. Here, we investigate the
field-angle dependence of the thermal Hall effects in the antiferromagnet
Na2Co2TeO6 and its non-magnetic isostructural analogue Na2Zn2TeO6 in the ac
plane. We find that the field-angle dependence of the thermal Hall conductivity
in both materials well follows that of the out-of-plane magnetization, showing
a common mechanism by extrinsic impurity-induced scatterings in both the phonon
thermal Hall effect and that enhanced by a coupling with the magnetism.

### A model for intertwined orders in cuprates

We model the intertwined orders in the cuprate pseudogap as a textured
antiferromagnet (AFM), where the texture arises from confining competing phases
on topological defects, i.e., arrays of AFM domain walls. Three branches of
texture are found, which can be interpreted as a strongly frustrated remnant of
an underlying eutectoid phase diagram. This model can describe many key
features of intertwined orders in cuprates, including the trisected
superconducting dome, and provides clear evidence for a
doping/hopping-parameter-dependent Mott-Slater transition in cuprates.

### Spin-Polarized Josephson Supercurrent in Nodeless Altermagnets

- **TL;DR**: 本文提出在零净磁化系统中实现纯自旋三重态约瑟夫森超电流的新机制，通过无节点交变磁体实现完全自旋极化的超导电流

Long-range propagation of equal-spin triplet Cooper pairs typically occurs in
ferromagnet/$s$-wave superconductor junctions, where net magnetization plays a
crucial role. Here, we propose a fundamentally different scenario in which
Josephson supercurrents mediated exclusively by spin-triplet pairings emerge in
systems with \textit{zero} net magnetization. We identify collinear
altermagnets, particularly a subclass termed nodeless altermagnets, as ideal
platforms to realize this phenomenon. These materials host spin-split Fermi
surfaces that do not intersect altermagnetic nodal lines and support maximal
spin-valley polarization, yielding fully spin-polarized electronic states at
each valley. Consequently, Josephson junctions based on nodeless altermagnets
sustain supercurrents solely through spin-polarized triplet pairing
correlations, simultaneously contributed by spin-up Cooper pairs from one
valley and spin-down Cooper pairs from the other. Furthermore, controlling the
relative local inversion-symmetry breaking at the two interfaces enables a
robust 0--$\pi$ transition without fine tuning, while adjusting the junction
orientation allows a crossover between pure triplet and mixed singlet-triplet
states. Our work thus establishes nodeless altermagnets as a unique platform
for altermagnetic superconductors with magnetization-free spin-polarized
supercurrents.

extensive benchmarks for self-consistent field calculations, orbital
localization, as well as orbital symmetrization tasks, featuring challenging
and pathological systems.

We employ deep learning techniques to investigate the critical properties of
the continuous phase transition in the majority vote model. In addition to deep
learning, principal component analysis is utilized to analyze the transition.
For supervised learning, dense neural networks are trained on spin
configuration data generated via the kinetic Monte Carlo method. Using
independently simulated configuration data, the neural network accurately
identifies the critical point on both square and triangular lattices. Classical
unsupervised learning with principal component analysis reproduces the
magnetization and enables estimation of critical exponents, typically obtained
via Monte Carlo importance sampling. Furthermore, deep unsupervised learning is
performed using variational autoencoders, which reconstruct input spin
configurations and generate artificial outputs. The autoencoders detect the
phase transition through the loss function, quantifying the preservation of
essential data features. We define a correlation function between the real and
reconstructed data, and find that this correlation function is universal at the
critical point. Variational autoencoders also serve as generative models,
producing artificial spin configurations.

### Li+/H+ exchange in solid-state oxide Li-ion conductors

Understanding the moisture stability of oxide Li-ion conductors is important
for their practical applications in solid-state batteries. Unlike sulfide or
halide conductors, oxide conductors generally better resist degradation when in
contact with water, but can still undergo topotactic ion exchange between Li
ions within the structure and protons in the environment. In this work, we
combine density functional theory (DFT) calculations with a machine-learning
interatomic potential model to investigate the thermodynamic driving force of
the Li+/H+ exchange reaction for two representative oxide Li-ion conductor
families: garnets and NASICONs. Our results indicate that the high Li chemical
potential in Li-stuffed garnets is responsible for the stronger driving force
for exchanging Li with protons as compared to the Li-unstuffed structures. In
contrast, NASICONs demonstrate a higher resistance against proton exchange,
which is attributed to the lower Li chemical potential and the lower O-H bond
covalency for polyanion-bonded oxygens. Our findings highlight the trade-off
when using Li stuffing as a mechanism to enhance Li-ion conductivity, as it
also promotes degradation by moisture. This study underscores the importance of
designing Li-ion conductors that not only possess high conductivity, but also
exhibit high stability in practical environments.

We explore how the quantum geometric properties of the Bloch wave function,
characterized by the Hilbert-Schmidt quantum distance, impact magnetic phases
in solid-state systems. To this end, we investigate the spin susceptibility
within the random phase approximation, considering the onsite Coulomb
interaction. We demonstrate that spin susceptibility can be decomposed into a
trivial part, dependent solely on the band dispersion, and a geometric part,
where the quantum distance plays a crucial role. Focusing on a model of a
quadratic band-touching semimetal, we show that a magnetic phase transition
between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic order can be induced solely by
tuning the wavefunction geometry, even while the energy spectrum is held
constant. This highlights the versatility of quantum geometry as a mechanism
for tuning magnetic properties independent of the energy spectrum. Applying our
framework to the Fe-pnictide and kagome lattice models, we further show that
the geometric contribution is decisive in stabilizing their known
antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic states, respectively. Our work sheds light
on the hidden quantum geometric aspects necessary for understanding and
engineering magnetic order in quantum materials.

Group-VI transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), MoS$_2$ and MoSe$_2$, have
emerged as prototypical low-dimensional systems with distinctive phononic and
electronic properties, making them attractive for applications in
nanoelectronics, optoelectronics, and thermoelectrics. Yet, their reported
lattice thermal conductivities ($\kappa$) remain highly inconsistent, with
experimental values and theoretical predictions differing by more than an order
of magnitude. These discrepancies stem from uncertainties in measurement
techniques, variations in computational protocols, and ambiguities in the
treatment of higher-order anharmonic processes. In this study, we critically
review these inconsistencies, first by mapping the spread of experimental and
modeling results, and then by identifying the methodological origins of
divergence. To this end, we bridge first-principles calculations, molecular
dynamics simulations, and state-of-the-art machine learning force fields
(MLFFs) including recently developed foundation models. %MACE-OMAT-0, UMA, and
NEP89. We train and benchmark GAP, MACE, NEP, and \textsc{HIPHIVE} against
density functional theory (DFT) and rigorously evaluate the impact of third-
and fourth-order phonon scattering processes on $\kappa$. The computational
efficiency of MLFFs enables us to extend convergence tests beyond conventional
limits and to validate predictions through homogeneous nonequilibrium molecular
dynamics as well. Our analysis demonstrates that, contrary to some recent
claims, fully converged four-phonon processes contribute negligibly to the
intrinsic thermal conductivity of both MoS$_2$ and MoSe$_2$. These findings not
only refine the intrinsic transport limits of 2D TMDs but also establish
MLFF-based approaches as a robust and scalable framework for predictive
modeling of phonon-mediated thermal transport in low-dimensional materials.

Increasingly intricate phase diagrams in new classes of superconductors host
fascinating interactions between superconductivity, diverse quantum phases, and
quantum critical dynamics. The native superfluids, however, often exhibit much
lower density and much greater inhomogeneity than conventional superfluids.
This may render the superconductivity susceptible to fluctuations that are
ordinarily assumed to be frozen out far below the superconducting transition
temperature $T_c$, calling into question the degree to which the
superconducting state is fully coherent. In this work, we leverage terahertz
spectroscopy to demonstrate strongly fluctuating superconductivity in
topological compositions of the multiband iron-based superconductor Fe(Te,Se).
These fluctuations are found to persist undiminished far below $T_c$ and
converge upon the limit of Planckian dissipation above $T_c$. These results
indicate that extended quantum fluctuations dominate the electrodynamics of
both the superconducting and Planckian-dissipative precursor states of
Fe(Te,Se), and demonstrate that the assumption of phase coherence must be
rigorously validated in emerging classes of unconventional superconductors.

### Crystal Orientation Dependence of Extreme Near-Field Heat Transfer between Polar Materials Governed by Surface Phonon Modes

Due to the rapid development of micro- and nano-manufacturing and electronic
devices, heat transfer at the transition regime between radiation and
conduction becomes increasingly important. Recent work has demonstrated the
importance of nonlocal optical response and phonon tunneling. However, it
remains unclear how the crystal orientation impacts them. In this work, we
study this effect on heat transport across vacuum gaps between magnesium oxide
(MgO) by nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulation. At 5~\AA~gaps,
the overall thermal conductance exhibits 30\% enhancement for [100] orientation
versus [110] and [210], while becoming orientation-insensitive beyond 6~\AA.
When the gap size is extremely small, the crystal orientation significantly
impacts the resonance frequencies of spectral thermal conductance which are
quite close to those of unique surface phonon modes distinct from bulk
counterparts. As the gap size gradually increases, the spectral thermal
conductance gradually converges to the predicted results of
fluctuation-electrodynamics (FE) theory in the long-wavelength approximation.
Our findings reveal how surface phonon modes govern extreme near-field heat
transfer across nanogap, providing insights for thermal management in
electronic devices.

Silicon is a promising anode material for next-generation lithium-ion

graphite-coated silicon core-shell structure has been proposed to mitigate
these issues by combining silicon's capacity with graphite's structural
stability. Despite this, experimental studies have shown that the usable
capacity of such composite electrodes can remain low, often below 40% at 1C,
especially under high-rate cycling. In this work, we develop a physics-based
electrochemical model to investigate the charge-discharge behaviour, rate
limitations, and degradation mechanisms of silicon-graphite core-shell anodes.
The model incorporates lithium transport, interfacial kinetics, evolving
contact area due to silicon expansion, and a simplified cracking framework to
capture loss of active material. Results are validated against key experimental
trends and used to explore the effects of particle size, shell thickness, and
charge protocol, offering insights into the design of more durable and
efficient Si-based composite anodes.

The spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the pyrochlore
lattice(PAFH) is arguably the most well known strongly frustrated quantum
magnet in three spatial dimension. As a close analogy of its two dimensional
cousin, namely the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the
kagome lattice(KAFH), it has long been anticipated that the ground state of the
spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ PAFH may host a novel quantum spin liquid. However, due to
the rapid scaling of Hilbert space with the linear size of such a three
dimensional system, study of the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ PAFH is limited to rather
small clusters and the nature of the ground state in the thermodynamic limit
remains elusive. Here we apply a recently developed powerful algorithm to
perform large scale unrestricted variational optimization of the ground state
of the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ PAFH. We find that the ground state of the
spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ PAFH features a maximally resonating valence bond
crystal(VBC) pattern with $2\times2\times2$ periodicity. There are at least
four levels of hierarchical structure in such a VBC state, with the first and
the second level of hierarchy related to the breaking of the inversion and the
translational symmetry. We also find that an nearest-neighboring(NN)-RVB ansatz
with $2\times 2\times 2$ periodicity can capture very well the qualitative
feature of the maximally resonating VBC state. The ground state energy obtained
from the NN-RVB ansatz and the generalized RVB ansatz extrapolate to
$-0.4827J/site$ and $-0.4835J/site$ respectively in the thermodynamic limit.
These results, which are obtained on clusters containing as many as
$N=8^{3}\times4=2048$ sites and wave function containing as many as
$N_{v}=16777216$ variational parameters, constitute new benchmarks for the
spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ PAFH.

In this work, we present frozen natural orbital (FNO) based implementations
of equation-of-motion (EOM) coupled-cluster (CC) with singles, doubles, and
triples (SDT) for ionization potential (IP), double ionization potential (DIP),

by Krylov and co-workers for IP variant and for spin-flipping and
spin-conserving excited states (respectively, the SF and EE variants) for both
total energies and energy-gaps. Recently, we presented FNO-CCSDT performance
for ground state energies of molecules, triplet-singlet gaps and for numerical
estimation force constants of some diatomic molecules. Now we present our study
on performance of IP, DIP, EA and DEA variants of FNO-EOM-CCSDT in computing
total-energies, and for target-reference and target-target energy-gaps.
Following earlier studies by us and by Krylov and co-workers, we also present

### Room temperature reactive sputtering deposition of titanium nitride with high sheet kinetic inductance

Superconducting thin films with high intrinsic kinetic inductance $L_{k}$ are
important for high-sensitivity detectors, enabling strong coupling in hybrid
quantum systems, and enhancing nonlinearities in quantum devices. We report the
room-temperature reactive sputtering of titanium nitride thin films with a
critical temperature $T_{c}$ of \SI{3.8}{K} and a thickness of \SI{27}{nm}.
Fabricated into resonators, these films exhibit a sheet kinetic inductance
$L_{k, \square}$ of 394~$\textrm{pH}/\square$, as inferred from resonant
frequency measurements. %from this film and measure quality factors of $4\times
10^{4}$; these quality factors are likely limited by the low resistivity wafer.
X-ray diffraction analysis confirms the formation of stoichiometric TiN, with
no residual unreacted titanium. The films also demonstrate a characteristic
sheet resistivity of 475~$\Omega/\square$, yielding an impedance an order of
magnitude higher than conventional 50~$\Omega$ resonators. This property could
enhance microwave single\textendash photon coupling strength by an order of
magnitude, offering transformative potential for hybrid quantum systems and
quantum sensing. Furthermore, the high $L_{k}$ enables Kerr nonlinearities
comparable to state\textendash of\textendash the\textendash art quantum
devices. Combined with its relatively high $T_{c}$, this thin film presents a
promising platform for superconducting devices, including amplifiers and qubits
operating at higher temperatures.

Thanks to the recent progress in bulk full three-dimensional nanoscale
magnetization distribution imaging, there is a growing interest to
three-dimensional (3D) magnetization textures, promising new high information
density spintronic applications. Compared to 1D domain walls or 2D magnetic
vortices/skyrmions, they are a much harder challenge to represent, analyze and
reason about. In this Letter we build analytical representation for such a
textures (with arbitrary number of singularity-free hopfions and singular Bloch
point pairs) as products of simple quaternionic functions. It can be useful as
a language for expressing theoretical models of 3D magnetization textures and
specifying a variety of topologically non-trivial initial conditions for
micromagnetic simulations.

### Using molecular dynamics to investigate the driving force for graphene auto-kirigami

- **TL;DR**: 通过分子动力学模拟研究石墨烯自折叠动力学，发现折叠结构形成速率受粘附能和初始几何形状共同影响，需要比能量平衡模型更复杂的描述。

Experiments [1] have shown that auto-kirigami structures can grow on the
surface of graphene because the graphene-graphene adhesion energy is greater
than the graphene-substrate interaction. In this work molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations of folded graphene both in vacuum and on a substrate have been
performed for a range of different initial geometries and at various
temperatures. The final equilibrated configuration for many of these
simulations resembles a book with a fold that is at the midpoint of the
graphene sheet. We investigate the amount of time it takes to move from an
initial folded configuration that does not have the fold at the midpoint of the
graphene to this final, book-like configuration. We show that graphene-graphene
and graphene substrate-adhesion energies can be extracted from such simulations
and that the values obtained are almost always higher than the values of these
quantities that are obtained from static calculations. We also show that the
rate at which these folded structures grow is affected by differences in these
adhesion energies. However, this rate is also affected by factors such as the
initial geometry of the graphene that do not change the adhesion energies.
Understanding the kinetics of auto-kirigami formation thus requires a
description of the system that is more sophisticated than an energy-balance
model.

### Tuning Coupled Toroidic and Polar Orders in a Bilayer Antiferromagnet

- **TL;DR**: 该研究利用双层CrSBr作为平台，通过磁场依赖的二次谐波产生技术，首次实现了对二维磁性环形序及其诱导电极性的调控和检测，展示了巨大的线性磁电效应。

Magnetic toroidal order features a loop-like arrangement of magnetic dipole
moments, thus breaking both spatial inversion (P) and time-reversal (T)
symmetries while preserving their combined PT sym-metry. This PT symmetry
enables a linear magnetoelectric effect, allowing the coupling between magnetic
toroidicity and electric polarity. However, the detection and control of
two-dimensional (2D) magnetic toroidal order and the investigation of its
linear magnetoelectric response remain largely unexplored. Here, using bilayer
CrSBr as a platform, which hosts an in-plane layer-antiferromagnetic (AFM)
order and simultaneously exhibits a magnetic toroidal order, we show compelling
evidence for tuning this 2D magnetic toroidicity and its induced electric
polarity through magnetic-field-depend-ent second harmonic generation (SHG).
Under an out-of-plane magnetic field, we decompose the SHG signal into a
time-reversal-odd component that scales with the magnetic toroidal moment and a
time-reversal-even component that is proportional to the electric polarization.
When sweeping the magnetic field from positive to negative values, we observe
that the magnetic toroidicity retains its sign but diminishes in magnitude at
higher fields while the electric polarity flips its sign and increases in
strength at increasing fields below a critical threshold. When applying an
in-plane electric field along the N\'eel vector direction, together with an
out-of-plane field, we find that the magnetic toroidal and electric polar
domains are moved in a locked fashion. These findings underscore the promise of
2D magnetic toroidal order in realizing giant linear magnetoelectric effects,
opening exciting possi-bilities for next-generation electronic, magnetic,
optical, and photonic devices enabled by 2D mag-netoelectrics.

We present a novel method for the modeling of fermionic reservoirs using a
new class of ancillary damped fermions, dubbed purified pseudofermions, which
exhibit unusual free correlations. We show that this key feature, when combined
with existing efficient decomposition algorithms for the reservoir correlation
functions, enables the development of an easily implementable and accurate
scheme for constructing effective models of fermionic reservoirs. We
numerically demonstrate the validity, accuracy, efficiency and potential use of
our method by studying the particle transport of spinless fermions in a
one-dimensional chain. Beyond its utility as a quantum impurity solver, our
method holds promise for addressing a wide range of problems involving extended
systems in fields like quantum transport, quantum thermodynamics, thermal
engines and nonequilibrium phase transitions.

Facilitated by recent advances in strained Ge/SiGe quantum well (QW) growth
technology, superconductor-semiconductor hybrid devices based on group IV
materials have been developed, potentially augmenting the functionality of
quantum circuits. The formation of highly transparent superconducting platinum
germanosilicide (PtSiGe) contacts to Ge/SiGe heterostructures by solid-phase
epitaxy between Pt and SiGe has recently been reported, although with a
relatively low critical temperature $&lt;1\,\mathrm{K}$. Here, we present a
comparative study of the superconducting properties of Pt, Pd, Rh, and Ir
germanides, along with an in-depth characterization of Ir(Si)Ge films formed by
solid-phase epitaxy. For films fabricated under optimal epitaxy conditions, we
report $T_\mathrm{c}=3.4\,\mathrm{K}$ ($2.6\,\mathrm{K}$ for IrGe (IrSiGe).
High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HRSTEM) and
energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) reveal that Ir reacts with Ge
substrates to form a polycrystalline IrGe layer with a sharp IrGe/Ge interface.

### Non-universal Thermal Hall Responses in Fractional Quantum Hall Droplets

We analytically compute the thermal Hall conductance (THC) of fractional
quantum Hall droplets under realistic conditions that go beyond the idealized
linear edge theory with conformal symmetry. Specifically, we consider
finite-size effects at low temperature, nonzero self-energies of quasiholes,
and general edge dispersions. We derive measurable corrections in THC that
align well with the experimental observables. Although the quantized THC is
commonly regarded as a topological invariant that is independent of edge
confinement, our results show that this quantization remains robust only for
arbitrary edge dispersion in the thermodynamic limit. Furthermore, the THC
contributed by Abelian modes can become extremely sensitive to finite-size
effects and irregular confining potentials in any realistic experimental
system. In contrast, non-Abelian modes show robust THC signatures under
perturbations, indicating an intrinsic stability of non-Abelian anyons.

We study the ring-opening decomposition of ethylene carbonate in the presence
of a single lithium atom and on the surface of lithium metal. Combining
accurate electronic structure theory, enhanced sampling, and machine learning,
we fine-tune the MACE-MP0 foundation model and apply the resulting machine
learning potentials to obtain statistically converged free energy profiles and
reaction rates. We confirm that the level of electronic structure theory is
important, and inaccurate density functionals can overestimate the reaction
rate by up to nine orders of magnitude. We also find that harmonic transition
state theory underestimates reaction rates by about one order of magnitude. For
the surface reaction, we find and characterize a new, ultrafast decomposition
pathway wherein the carbonyl is deeply inserted into the lithium surface and
bent by about 70$^\circ$. This reaction, which occurs in a few tens of
picoseconds, generates a ring-opened intermediate that is a precursor for CO or
CO$_2$ formation; by contrast, an alternative pathway that yields CO$_3^{2-}$
and ethylene is found to be non-competitive, occurring on a timescale of tens
of nanoseconds.

### Fate of Topological Dirac Magnons in van der Waals Ferromagnets at Finite Temperature

Dirac magnons, the bosonic counterparts of Dirac fermions in graphene,
provide a unique platform to explore symmetry-protected band crossings and
quantum geometry in magnetic insulators, while promising high-velocity,
low-dissipation spin transport for next-generation magnonic technologies.
However, their stability under realistic, finite-temperature conditions remains
an open question. Here, we develop a comprehensive microscopic theory of
thermal magnon-magnon interactions in van der Waals honeycomb ferromagnets,
focusing on both gapless and gapped Dirac magnons. Using nonlinear spin-wave
theory with magnon self-energy corrections and a T-matrix resummation that
captures two-magnon bound states, we quantitatively reproduce temperature- and
momentum-dependent energy shifts and linewidths observed experimentally in the
gapless Dirac magnon material CrBr$_3$, even near the Curie temperature. Our
approach resolves discrepancies between prior theoretical predictions and
experiment and highlight the significant role of bound states in enhancing
magnon damping at low temperatures. For gapped Dirac magnon materials such as
CrI$_3$, CrSiTe$_3$, and CrGeTe$_3$, we find a thermally induced reduction of
the topological magnon gap but no evidence of thermally driven topological
transitions. Classical atomistic spin dynamics simulations corroborate the gap'
s robustness up to the Curie temperature. Furthermore, we establish a practical
criterion for observing topological gaps by determining the minimum ratio of
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction to Heisenberg exchange required to overcome
thermal broadening throughout the ordered phase, typically around 5%. Our
results clarify the interplay of thermal many-body effects and topology in
low-dimensional magnets and provide a reliable framework for interpreting
spectroscopic experiments.

### Spin-dependent signatures of Majorana modes in thermoelectric transport through double quantum dots

We present a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the spin-dependent
thermoelectric properties of a double quantum dot system coupled to a
topological superconducting nanowire and ferromagnetic leads. The study focuses
on the behavior of the Seebeck coefficient and its spin-resolved counterparts,
with calculations performed by means of the numerical renormalization group
method. We investigate the low-temperature transport regime, where a complex
interplay between the two-stage Kondo effect, the ferromagnet-induced exchange
field, and the Majorana coupling occurs. We demonstrate that thermoelectric
measurements can reveal unique signatures of the Majorana interaction that are
challenging to isolate in conductance measurements alone. It is shown that the
exchange field fundamentally alters the thermoelectric response, leading to a
rich, non-monotonic temperature evolution of the thermopower, which is driven
by a temperature-dependent competition between the spin channels. Furthermore,
we have identified qualitatively different regimes of spin thermopower
generation, controlled by the interplay between the Majorana-induced asymmetry
and the spin polarization of the leads. Finally, by connecting the system's
thermoelectric response to the underlying transport asymmetries quantified by
the conductance spin polarization, we provide a consistent and unified physical
picture, proposing thermoelectric transport as a sensitive probe for Majorana
signatures.

In many cases, the predictions of machine learning interatomic potentials
(MLIPs) can be interpreted as a sum of body-ordered contributions, which is
explicit when the model is directly built on neighbor density correlation
descriptors, and implicit when the model captures the correlations through
non-linear functions of low body-order terms. In both cases, the "effective
body-orderedness" of MLIPs remains largely unexplained: how do the models
decompose the total energy into body-ordered contributions, and how does their
body-orderedness affect the accuracy and learning behavior? In answering these
questions, we first discuss the complexities in imposing the many-body
expansion on ab initio calculations at the atomic limit. Next, we train a
curated set of MLIPs on datasets of hydrogen clusters and reveal the inherent
tendency of the ML models to deduce their own, effective body-order trends,
which are dependent on the model type and dataset makeup. Finally, we present
different trends in the convergence of the body-orders and generalizability of
the models, providing useful insights for the development of future MLIPs.

Electric field control of electron charge and spin degrees of freedom is
fundamental to modern semiconductor and spintronic devices. Yet controlling
electromagnetic waves with an electric field, particularly in the terahertz
(THz) band, remains a challenge. Here, we propose a spin-corner-layer coupling
(SCLC) mechanism in second-order topological altermagnetic bilayers. By using
an electric field to influence electrons between different layers, the SCLC
mechanism enables simultaneous control over corner and spin degrees of freedom,
thereby allowing electric-field tuning of the absorption, emission intensity,
and even polarization of THz waves. Taking bilayer NiZrI$_6$ nanodisks as a
prototype, we demonstrate that an ultralow electrostatic field can switch both
the spin and the layer polarizations of corner states. This dual switching
modulates transition dipole moments and oscillator strengths between different
corner states, thereby enabling the manipulation of THz waves. This study
establishes a mechanism for the electric-field control of spin and THz waves
through SCLC, yielding important implications for the advancement of THz
spintronics.

Magnetic excitations of the exchange-dipole quasi 1D XXZ antiferromagnet are
studied in the ordered phase. We observe a transformation of the electron spin
resonance (ESR) spectrum when crossing the N\'{e}el temperature near 0.2 K. The
single-mode ESR of a correlated XXZ chain transforms in the multi-mode spectrum
in the ordered phase. The multi-mode spectrum consists mainly of the intensive
mode of a single correlated chain, which is surrounded and/or indented by
numerous weak satellites. The number of securely fixed modes is eight at
magnetic field parallel b-axis and twelve at magnetic field parallel a-axis.
Besides of the multi-mode resonance observed at the transverse polarization of
the microwave and static magnetic fields, we reveal a wide band of absorption
by (k,-k)- pairs of quasiparticles at the longitudinal polarization. This kind
of absorption of microwaves occurs both in the ordered and specific spin-liquid
phases, revealing the presence of quasiparticles in the specific spin-liquid
phase.

Recently, Jiayi Hu and co-workers reported that they did not resolve any
thermal Hall signal in La$_2$CuO$_4$ by `high resolution' measurements, setting
an upper bound of $|\kappa_{xy}| &lt;2\times 10^{-3}~$Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ at 20 K.
Two points have apparently escaped their attention. First, thermal Hall signals
with an amplitude well below this resolution bound have been detected in
disordered perovskites. Second, the longitudinal thermal conductivity of their
sample is significantly lower than the La$_2$CuO$_4$ sample displaying a
thermal Hall signal. We find that a moderate reduction of $\kappa_{xx}$ in
SrTiO$_3$ is concomitant with a drastic attenuation of $\kappa_{xy}$. A trend
emerges across several families of insulators: the amplitude of $\kappa_{xy}$
anti-correlates with disorder.

We show that altermagnets (AMs) with Rashba spin--orbit coupling can host a
transverse Josephson diode effect (TJDE) without any external magnetic field.
AMs combine zero net magnetization with spin-polarized Fermi surfaces, enabling
the simultaneous breaking of inversion and time-reversal symmetries. We propose
a four-terminal Josephson junction where a longitudinal phase bias between
opposite superconducting terminals generates transverse supercurrents in the
unbiased terminals. These transverse currents exhibit both a diode-like
nonreciprocity and a finite anomalous phase offset, revealing a transverse
anomalous Josephson effect (AJE). For certain parameter regimes, the transverse
current becomes unidirectional, and the TJDE efficiency can exceed 1000\%,
demonstrating exceptionally strong diode behavior. Remarkably, the magnitude
and direction of the TJDE and transverse AJE are tunable by rotating the N\'eel
vector. Our results establish altermagnets as a versatile platform for
engineering field-free nonreciprocal superconducting transport in multiterminal
devices.

- **TL;DR**: 钾钨青铜(KxWO3)纳米带通过固-液-固生长法制备，具有优异的电学特性，包括双极电阻开关、短期和长期可塑性，适用于离子电子存储应用

Potassium tungsten bronzes (K$_x$WO$_3$) are nonstoichiometric oxides in
which alkali ions, i.e., K+, occupy one-dimensional tunnels of the hexagonal
WO6 framework, enabling coupled ionic-lectronic transport. While their bulk and
nanostructured forms have been studied extensively, controlled synthesis of
single-crystalline mesoscale samples suitable for device fabrication has
remained limited. Here, we report a solid-liquid-solid (SLS) growth strategy
that yields high-quality K$_x$WO$_3$ nanobelts with thicknesses down to ~36 nm
and lateral sizes exceeding 100 um. The crystals display sharp optical domains
arising from local variations in potassium occupancy, as confirmed by spatially
resolved Raman spectroscopy and electron diffraction. Under applied bias, these
domains vanish irreversibly, consistent with lateral redistribution of K+ ions
along the tunnels. Two-terminal devices fabricated from individual nanobelts
exhibit reproducible bipolar switching with resistance ratios of 10-30,
characteristic short-term and long-term plasticity under pulsed excitation, and
switching energies of ~25 nJ. These results establish K$_x$WO$_3$ as a model
tunnel-structured oxide for studying electric-field-driven alkali-ion
migration, while also highlighting its potential for stable, analog resistive
switching and iontronic memory applications.

- **TL;DR**: 使用黎曼zeta函数正则化方法研究一维和二维海森堡铁磁体与反铁磁体的有效磁矩温度修正，发现不同维度与磁有序类型的温度依赖关系存在显著差异

The Riemann zeta function regularization is employed to extract finite
temperature corrections to effective magnetic moment $S^*$ of one- and
two-dimensional Heisenberg ferro- and antiferromagnets. Whereas for the
one-dimensional ferromagnet we obtain the usual $T^{1/2}$ spin-wave dependence,
for the antiferromagnetic chain the dependence is described by a generalized
incomplete Riemann function. The quantity $S^*$ determines strong short-range
magnetic order in the absence of long-range order, in particular the
correlation length. For the one-dimensional ferromagnet, the results are
confirmed by the self-consistent spin-wave theory and Monte Carlo simulations
by Takahashi et al.

### Twist-modulated magnetic interactions in bilayer van der Waals materials

The ability to control magnetic interactions at the nanoscale is crucial for
the development of next-generation spintronic devices and functional magnetic
materials. In this work, we investigate theoretically, by means of many-body
perturbation theory, how interlayer twisting modulates magnetic interactions in
bilayer van der Waals systems composed of two ferromagnetic layers. We
demonstrate that the relative strengths of the interlayer Heisenberg exchange
interaction, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, and the anisotropic
exchange interaction can be significantly altered by varying the twist angle
between the layers, thus leading to tunable magnetic textures. We further show
that these interactions are strongly dependent on the chemical potential,
enabling additional control via electrostatic gating or doping. Importantly,
our approach is applicable to arbitrary twist angles and does not rely on the
construction of a Moir\'e supercell, making it particularly efficient even at
small twist angles.

### Teachers that teach the irrelevant: Pre-training machine learned interaction potentials with classical force fields for robust molecular dynamics simulations

- **TL;DR**: 提出一种预训练学习方案，使用低质量单分子力场数据进行预训练，然后通过少量昂贵ab initio数据进行微调，实现稳定准确的分子动力学模拟

Machine learned interaction potentials (MLIPs) have become a critical
component of large-scale, high-quality simulations for a range of chemical and
biochemical systems. Yet, despite their in-distribution accuracy, molecular
dynamics simulations using MLIPs exhibit numerical instabilities due to
underlying data insufficiencies when encountering new regions of the potential
energy surface. Here we propose a pre-training learning scheme that uses
low-quality, practically free, single-molecule non-reactive force field data
while all intermolecular interactions and reactive properties are learned at a
fine-tuning stage with a small amount of computationally more expensive labels.
We show that the force field pre-training approach followed by data efficient
ab initio fine tuning allows for stable and accurate molecular dynamics and
metadynamics simulations of gas phase molecules, liquid water, and hydrogen
combustion reactions compared to models trained from scratch.

### Thermal Degradation Mechanisms and Stability Enhancement Strategies in Perovskite Solar Cells: A Review

- **TL;DR**: 钙钛矿太阳能电池(PSCs)具有高效率但热稳定性差，本文研究温度对空穴传输层和钙钛矿层降解的影响，探讨提高热稳定性的解决方案。

Perovskite Solar Cells (PSCs) have garnered global research interest owing to
their superior photovoltaic (PV) performance. The future of photovoltaic
technology lies in PSCs since they can produce power with performance on par
with the best silicon solar cells while being less expensive. PSCs have
enormous potential; in just ten years, their efficiency increased from 3.8% to
25.2%, and research into new developments is still ongoing. Thermal instability
is PSCs' main disadvantage, despite their high efficiency, flexibility, and
lightweight nature. This paper looks at how temperature affects the ways that
hole transport layers (HTLs) like spiro-OMeTAD and perovskite layers,
especially MAPbI3, degrade. Elevated temperatures cause MAPbI3 to degrade into
PbI2, CH3I, and NH3, with decomposition rates affected by moisture, oxygen, and
environmental factors. Mixed cation compositions, such as Cs-MA-FA, have higher
thermal stability, whereas MA+ cations break-down faster under heat stress.
HTLs deteriorate due to morphological changes and the hydrophilicity of dopant
additions like Li-TFSI and t-BP. Alternative dopant-free HTMs, such as P3HT and
inorganic materials including CuSCN, NiOx, and Cu2O, have shown improved
thermal stability and efficiency. Hybrid HTLs, dopant-free designs, and
interface tweaks are all viable solutions for increasing the stability of PSC.
Addressing thermal stability issues remains crucial for the development of more
reliable and efficient PSC technology.

We study the structural properties and phase stability of the
K$_{x}$Ca$_{1-x}$N alloy using the regular-solution model based on the total
energy of the mixing. The pseudopotential approach was used along with PBE
functional of Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE). We investigated the
bond-lengths distribution as a function of composition $x$. We also predicted
the phase separation of the two partially miscible components and calculated
the enthalpy $\Delta H$ using the interaction parameter $\Omega$. We observe an
asymmetry about $x=0.46$ in the phase diagram due to the $x$-dependant
interaction parameter $\Omega=12.69-1.32x$ kcal/mole. The equilibrium
solubility limit, known as the miscibility gap is found to be around 3033 K.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究通过在原子探针层析成像模拟中加入随机横向速度扰动和roll-up机制，显著提高了模拟精度，能够准确重现实验观测到的探测器模式。

Field evaporation in atom probe tomography (APT) includes known processes
related to surface migration of atoms, such as the so-called roll-up mechanism.
They lead to trajectory aberrations and artefacts on the detector. These
processes are usually neglected in simulations. The inclusion of such processes
is crucial for providing reliable models for the development and verification
of APT reconstruction algorithms, a key part of the whole methodology. Here we
include stochastic lateral velocity perturbations and a roll-up mechanism to
simulations performed using the Robin--Rolland model. By comparing with
experimental data from Al and Ni systems, we find the stochastic perturbation
energy distributions that allow us to very accurately reproduce the detector
patterns seen experimentally and thus greatly improve the accuracy of the
simulations. We also explore the possible causes of remaining discrepancies
between the experimental and simulated detector patterns.

### Contrasting magnetic anisotropy in CrCl3 and CrBr3: A first-principles study

- **TL;DR**: 本文通过第一性原理研究揭示了CrCl3和CrBr3中相反易磁化轴方向的物理机制，发现卤素p轨道的空间分布、自旋轨道耦合强度和杂化差异是关键因素

We present a first-principles study of the contrasting easy magnetization
axes(EMAs) in the layered chromium trihalides CrCl3 and CrBr3, which exhibit
in-plane and out-of-plane EMAs, respectively. Using density-functional theory
calculations, we show that the EMA is determined by the interplay between
spin-orbit coupling-induced magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (SOC-MAE) and
shape magnetic anisotropy energy(shape-MAE) arising from dipole-dipole
interactions. While the Cr d orbitals contribute similarly to the SOC-MAE in
both compounds, the key difference stems from the halogen p orbitals. In CrCl3,
the localized Cl 3p orbitals favor spin-flip SOC interactions, particularly
between the (px, py) and (py, pz) channels. These channels contribute with
opposite signs-negative and positive, respectively-leading to partial
cancellation and a small net SOC-MAE. As a result, the shape-MAE exceeds the
SOC-MAE in magnitude, favoring an in-plane EMA. In contrast, CrBr3 features
more delocalized Br 4p orbitals, enhanced p-d hybridization, and stronger SOC.
This leads to stronger spin-conserving SOC interactions, with dominant
contributions from both the (px, py) and (py, pz) channels. In this case, the
positive contribution from the (px, py) channel outweighs the smaller negative
contribution from the (py, pz) channel, resulting in a sizable net SOC-MAE. The
SOC-MAE thus surpasses the shape-MAE and stabilizes an out-of-plane EMA. These
findings demonstrate that the contrasting magnetic anisotropies in CrCl3 and
CrBr3 originate from differences in the spatial distribution, SOC strength, and
hybridization of the halogen p orbitals, highlighting the critical role of
orbital anisotropy and spin selection rules in governing magnetic behavior in
layered semiconductors.

Accurate prediction of excited states in battery electrolytes is central to
understanding photostability, oxidative stability, and degradation. We employ
hybrid quantum-classical algorithms -- the Variational Quantum Eigensolver
(VQE) for ground states combined with the quantum equation of motion (qEOM) for
vertical singlet excitations -- to study LiPF$_6$, NaPF$_6$, LiFSI, and NaFSI.
Compact active spaces were constructed from frontier orbitals, mapped to
qubits, and reduced via symmetry tapering and commuting-group measurements to
lower sampling cost. Within $\sim$10-qubit models, VQE-qEOM agrees closely with
exact diagonalization of the same Hamiltonians, while sample-based quantum
diagonalization (SQD) in larger active spaces recovers near-exact
(subspace-FCI) energies. The spectra display clear anion and cation trends:
PF$_6$ salts exhibit higher first-excitation energies (e.g., LiPF$_6$
$\approx$13.2 eV) and a compact three-state cluster at 12-13 eV, whereas FSI
salts show substantially lower onsets ($\approx$8-9 eV) with a near-degenerate
(S$_1$,S$_2$) followed by S$_3$ $\sim$1.3 eV higher. Substituting Li$^+$ with
Na$^+$ narrows the gap by $\sim$0.4-0.8 eV within each anion family. Converting
S$_1$ to wavelengths places the onsets in the deep-UV (LiPF$_6$ $\sim$94 nm;
NaPF$_6$ $\sim$100 nm; LiFSI $\sim$141 nm; NaFSI $\sim$148 nm). All results
pertain to isolated species or embedded clusters appropriate to the NISQ
regime; solvent shifts can be incorporated a posteriori via classical
$\Delta$-solvation or static embedding. These results demonstrate that current
quantum algorithms can deliver chemically meaningful excitation and binding
trends for realistic electrolyte motifs and provide quantitative baselines to
guide electrolyte screening and design.

Permanent magnets containing rare earth elements are essential components for
the electrification of society. Ce(Co1-xCux)5 permanent magnets are a model
system known for their substantial coercivity, yet the underlying mechanism
remains unclear. Here, we investigate Ce(Co0.8Cu0.2)5.4 magnets with a
coercivity of ~1 T. Using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atom probe
tomography (APT), we identify a nanoscale cellular structure formed by spinodal
decomposition. Cu-poor cylindrical cells (~5-10 nm in diameter, ~20 nm long)
have a disordered CeCo5-type structure and a composition Ce(Co0.9Cu0.1)5.3.
Cu-rich cell boundaries are ~ 5 nm thick and exhibit a modified CeCo5
structure, with Cu ordered on the Co sites and a composition Ce(Co0.7Cu0.3)5.0.
Micromagnetic simulations demonstrate that the intrinsic Cu concentration
gradients up to 12 at.% Cu/nm lead to a spatial variation in magnetocrystalline
anisotropy and domain wall energy, resulting in effective pinning and high
coercivity. Compared to Sm2Co17-type magnets, Ce(Co0.8Cu0.2)5.4 displays a
finer-scale variation of conventional pinning with lower structural and
chemical contrast in its underlying nanostructure. The identification of
nanoscale chemical segregation in nearly single-phase Ce(Co0.8Cu0.2)5.4 magnets
provides a microstructural basis for the long-standing phenomenon of "giant
intrinsic magnetic hardness" in systems such as SmCo5-xMx, highlighting avenues
for designing rare-earth-lean permanent magnets via controlled nanoscale
segregation.

### Tuning and Suppression of YIG Magnetisation Dynamics via Antiferromagnetic Interface Coupling

The magnetisation dynamics of yttrium iron garnet (Y3Fe5O12, YIG) are key to
the operation of spintronic and microwave devices. Here, we report a pathway to
manipulate the frequency, damping and absorption of YIG thin films via
interface coupling. The growth on YIG of PtMn, a metallic antiferromagnet,
leads to a power dependence of the oscillation frequency and an increased
linewidth at low fields. In gadolinium iron garnet/YIG film bilayers, the two
films couple antiferromagnetically at low temperatures and there is a strong
damping of the magnetisation dynamics that is further enhanced at the spin-flop
field, suppressing the FMR signal. When combining both GdIG and PtMn
interfaces, we can tune the exponent of the power dependence of frequency with
field and achieve an almost complete quenching of the magnetisation dynamics
over a range of fields/frequencies due to non-collinear magnetic order. These
effects offer a means to tune and suppress magnetisation dynamics for frequency
filters, magnonics, spin pumping and other applications.

### Inverse Design of Amorphous Materials with Targeted Properties

Disordered (amorphous) materials, such as glasses, are emerging as promising
candidates for applications within energy storage, nonlinear optics, and
catalysis. Their lack of long-range order and complex short- and medium-range
orderings, which depend on composition as well as thermal and pressure history,
offer a vast materials design space. To this end, relying on machine learning
methods instead of trial and error is promising, and among these, inverse
design has emerged as a tool for discovering novel materials with desired
properties. Although inverse design methods based on diffusion models have
shown success for crystalline materials and molecules, similar methods
targeting amorphous materials remain less developed, mainly because of the
limited availability of large-scale datasets and the requirement for larger
simulation cells. In this work, we propose and validate an inverse design
method for amorphous materials, introducing AMDEN (Amorphous Material DEnoising
Network), a diffusion model-based framework that generates structures of
amorphous materials. These low-energy configurations are typically obtained
through a thermal motion-driven random search-like process that cannot be
replicated by standard denoising procedures. We therefore introduce an
energy-based AMDEN variant that implements Hamiltonian Monte Carlo refinement
for generating these relaxed structures. We further introduce several amorphous
material datasets with diverse properties and compositions to evaluate our
framework and support future development.

Hybrid two-dimensional (2D) materials have attracted increasing interest as
platforms for tailoring electronic properties through interfacial design. Very
recently, a novel hybrid 2D material termed glaphene, which combines monolayers
of 2D silica glass and graphene, was experimentally realized. Inspired by
glaphenes, we proposed a new class of similar structures named glaphynes, which
are formed by stacking SiO$_2$ monolayers onto $\alpha$-, $\beta$-, and
$\gamma$-graphynes. Graphynes are 2D carbon allotropes with the presence of
acetylenic groups (triple bonds). The glaphynes' structural and electronic
properties were investigated using the density functional tight-binding (DFTB)
method, as implemented in the DFTB+ package. Our analysis confirms their
energetic and structural stability. We have observed that in the case of
glaphynes, the electronic proximity effect can indeed open the electronic band
gap, but not for all cases, even with the formation of Si-O-C bonds between
silica and graphynes.

In indirect band gap materials, phonon-assisted processes are key mechanisms
for photoluminescence (PL). Using a first-principles many-body approach, we
systematically investigate the phonon-assisted PL in bilayer MoS$_2$ and its
dependence on temperature and external tensile strain. The effects of phonons
are accounted for using a supercell approach: we identify the phonon momenta
that are important to PL, construct supercells that are commensurate with these
phonons, and examine the changes in the optical absorption after explicit
displacements of atoms along each phonon mode. The PL intensity is then
obtained via the van Roosbroeck-Shockley relationship from the optical
absorption spectra. This approach enables us to investigate phonon-absorption
and phonon-emission processes separately and how each process depends on
temperature. Our results reveal that optical phonons associated with
out-of-plane vibrations of S atoms and in-plane vibrations of Mo atoms
contribute most to the indirect PL for unstrained bilayer MoS$_2$.
Additionally, we also discuss how the PL spectra and the phonon contributions
evolve with strain. In particular, we show that at high strain, additional
phonon channels become available due to the modulation of the electronic band
structure.

We report the discovery of a thermodynamically stable skyrmion-antiskyrmion
lattice in two-dimensional heterostructures, a novel state exhibiting a
net-zero global topological charge owing to an equal population of skyrmions
and antiskyrmions. This surprising coexistence of oppositely charged solitons
remarkably circumvents their anticipated annihilation. We demonstrate the
formation and evolution of this phase in Fe films on C1v -symmetric (110)
surfaces of GaAs and CdTe semiconductors. Specifically, we reveal a series of
magnetic field-induced phase transitions: cycloidal spin-spiral to
skyrmion-antiskyrmion lattice to conical spin-spiral to ferromagnet. The
remarkable stability of the net-zero lattice is attributed to symmetry-enforced
anisotropic magnetic interactions. Lowering interfacial symmetry to C1v thus
enables frustrated chiral magnets, uniquely manifesting in thermodynamically
stable net-zero topological soliton lattices, as revealed by our findings.
