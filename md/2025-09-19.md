- **TL;DR**: 开发了新型7-叔丁基芘-2-醇衍生物，通过在1,3位引入臂状取代基来抑制激基缔合物形成和氧猝灭，实现了中等至高荧光量子产率和较短荧光寿命。

Pyrene-functionalized materials are extensively employed in photoluminescent
applications, owing to their extended pi-conjugation and favorable
photophysical properties. However, their luminescent performance is often
attenuated by pi-pi stacking-driven excimer formation and molecular oxygen
quenching. To mitigate these undesirable effects, a novel class of
7-tert-butylpyren-2-ol derivatives with extended 'arm-like' substituents at the
1,3-positions have been synthesized and their luminescent properties in
solution have been thoroughly investigated. While the 2- and 7-positions of the
pyrene core are frequently modified with hydroxyl and tert-butyl groups, this
work presents the first introduction of 'arm-like' substituents at the
1,3-positions. The stretched-out 'arm-like' substituents not only introduce
steric bulk to suppress excimer formation but also change the symmetry class of
pyrene and modulate electron density at its 1,2,3,7-positions. These effects
tune pyrene's energy levels, demonstrating moderate (0.4) to high (0.7)
fluorescence quantum yields and shorter-lived fluorescence lifetimes ranging
from ca. 20 to 40 ns. These shorter lifetimes lead to a reduction of the pyrene
derivatives' susceptibility to energy scavenging by molecular oxygen. In
addition, the specific form of the 'arms' are important. Alkyl-containing arms
and alkenyl-containing arms exhibit different decay pathways, which is
reflected by their disparate nonradiative rates. Thus, the introduction of
'arm-like' modifications represents a promising approach to modulate the
photophysical behaviours of annulenes, highlighting their applicability in
next-generation electronic and optoelectronic systems.

### Tuning Molecular Motors with Tert-Butyl and Fluorinated Tert-Butyl Groups

- **TL;DR**: 通过理论计算研究分子马达转子基团取代基修饰对旋转速度的影响，发现叔丁基和氟化叔丁基取代能显著提高旋转速率并改变吸收光谱

The effect of modifying substituents in the rotor group of five second
generation molecular motors is estimated by theoretical calculations. The
rotational speed is estimated by calculating the rate limiting step, the
thermal helix inversion, as well as the competing backward transition using
harmonic transition state theory with energy and atomic forces obtained from
density functional theory. First, a methyl group at the stereogenic center is
replaced with a tert-butyl (tBu) group and the rotational speed is found to
increase due to reduced lifetime of the metastable state. For two of the
rotors, comparison can be made with experimental measurements and the
calculated half-life is in close agreement. Secondly, the effect of
substituting the nine hydrogen atoms in the tBu group with fluorine atoms is
studied and this is found to increase the rotational rate further without
significantly altering the molecular structure. The excitation wavelength of
both the stable and metastable states is calculated and the separation of the
absorption peaks is found to increase by the tBu substitution and even more so
by the fluorinated tBu substitution, up to 40 nm. These findings can help
develop a strategy for designing molecular motors with a rotational speed that
best fits a given application.

### Reduced-Cost Four-Component Relativistic Double Ionization Potential Equation-of-Motion Coupled-Cluster Approaches with 4-Hole--2-Particle Excitations and Three-Body Clusters

- **TL;DR**: 本文扩展了双电离势(DIP)EOM-CC方法到相对论四分量框架，并提出了新的计算效率更高的DIP-EOMCCSD(T)(ã)(4h-2p)方法，将计算复杂度从N⁸降低到N⁷。

The double ionization potential (DIP) equation-of-motion (EOM)
coupled-cluster (CC) method with 4-hole--2-particle (4$h$-2$p$) excitations on
top of the CC with singles, doubles, and triples calculation, abbreviated as
DIP-EOMCCSDT(4$h$-2$p$), along with its perturbative
DIP-EOMCCSD(T)(a)(4$h$-2$p$) approximation, are extended to a relativistic
four-component (4c) framework. In addition, we introduce and test a new
computationally practical DIP-EOMCC approach, which we call
DIP-EOMCCSD(T)($\tilde{a}$)(4$h$-2$p$), that approximates the treatment of
4$h$-2$p$ correlations within the DIP-EOMCCSD(T)(a) (4$h$-2$p$) method and
reduces the $\mathscr{N}^8$ scaling characterizing DIP-EOMCCSDT(4$h$-2$p$) and
DIP-EOMCCSD(T)(a)(4$h$-2$p$) to $\mathscr{N}^7$ with the system size
$\mathscr{N}$. Further improvements in computational efficiency are obtained
using the frozen natural spinor (FNS) approximation to reduce the numbers of
unoccupied spinors entering the correlated steps of the DIP-EOMCC calculations
according to a well-defined occupation-number-based threshold. The resulting
4c-FNS-DIP-EOMCC approaches are used to compute DIPs for the series of inert
gas atoms from argon to radon as well as the vertical DIPs in \Cltwo{},
\Brtwo{}, HBr, and HI, which have been experimentally examined in the past. We
demonstrate that, when using complete basis set extrapolations and FNS
truncation thresholds of $10^{-4.5}$, the
4c-FNS-DIP-EOMCCSD(T)($\tilde{a}$)(4$h$-2$p$) calculations are capable of
predicting DIPs in agreement with experimental data, improving upon their
nonrelativistic and spin-free scalar-relativistic counterparts, particularly
when examining DIPs characterized by stronger spin-orbit coupling effects.

### Fluorescence-detected Wavepacket Interferometry reveals time-varying Exciton Relaxation Pathways in single Light-Harvesting Complexes

- **TL;DR**: 通过双脉冲干涉技术研究光合细菌单色素蛋白复合物中的激发态能量弛豫过程，发现低频振动模式驱动能量弛豫的波动特性

Photosynthesis relies on efficient energy relaxation within the excited-state
manifold of pigment-protein complexes. Since the protein scaffold is rather
flexible, the resulting energetic and structural disorder gives rise to a
complex excited-state energy level structure that fluctuates on all time
scales. Although the impact of such fluctuations on relaxation processes is
known, the precise exciton states involved in relaxation as well as the nature
of the vibrational modes driving relaxation are under debate. Here single
pigment-protein complexes from a photosynthetic purple bacterium are excited
with two identical ultrashort phase-locked pulses producing two exciton wave
packets that can interfere. This leads to a modulation of the emission
intensity as a function of the delay time between the pulses that fades out
within about 100 fs due to fluctuating environments on those time scales. For
several single complexes we find variations of the interference patterns on
time scale of several 10 s that reveal fluctuations in the energy relaxation
pathways towards the lowest-energy exciton states. This relaxation is driven by
temporal variations in the coupling between electronic excitations and
low-frequency vibrational modes.

### Defects in Wigner crystals: fracton-elasticity duality and vacancy proliferation

- **TL;DR**: 本文开发了带电晶体的低能场理论，通过分形-弹性二元性和电磁1形式对称性，研究了晶体缺陷与电磁场的耦合，计算了空位相互作用能，发现空位存在时纵向模式会变得无间隙。

We develop a low-energy field theory for electrically charged crystals. Using
the tools of fracton-elasticity duality, generalized to accommodate the
magnetic 1-form symmetry of electromagnetism, we show how the elastic and
electromagnetic degrees of freedom couple to the different crystal defects and
to one another. The resulting field theory is then used to calculate
vacancy-vacancy interaction energy, and to study the consequences of vacancy
proliferation. We find that the longitudinal mode, which in a perfect crystal
has a finite gap due to plasma oscillations, becomes gapless in the presence of
vacancies. Our framework lays a foundation for a study of defect interactions,
their collective dynamics, and consequences of defect-mediated melting in
charged crystals.

### The Varieties of Schelling Model Experience

- **TL;DR**: 对54个谢林模型规则变体进行系统分类，发现只有3种相图类别，揭示了高阈值下原始步进函数的病理特性及协调失败机制

The Schelling model is a prototype for agent-based modeling in social
systems. A comprehensive analysis of Schelling model rule variants is achieved
by classification of the space of macroscopic outcomes via phase diagrams.
Among 54 rule variants, only 3 phase diagram classes are found, characterized
by the number of phase transitions. This classification scheme is found to be
robust to the use of sociological and percolation-inspired measures of
segregation. The statistical and dynamic drivers of these transitions are
elucidated by analyzing the roles of vision, movement criteria, vacancies, the
initial state, and rivalry. Schelling's original step function dictating
satisfaction is found to be pathological at high thresholds, producing
coordination failures as satisfactory sites become increasingly rare. This
comprehensive classification gives new insight into the drivers of transitions
in the Schelling model and creates a basis for studying more complex
Schelling-like models.

### Violation of Spin Paramagnetic limit in Bi/Ni Bilayer

- **TL;DR**: 在Bi/Ni双层膜中发现NiBi3界面超导层在面内磁场下违反自旋顺磁极限，表现出异常增强的上临界场，可能涉及非常规配对机制

We report a violation of the spin-paramagnetic limit in the in-plane upper
critical field ($B_{C2}^{\parallel}$) in Bi(10 nm)/Ni(1 nm) bilayers grown by
molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). Superconductivity emerges at the interface
through the formation of an ultrathin NiBi$_3$ layer, which hosts a remarkably
robust superconducting state under in-plane magnetic fields. To account for the
$B_{C2}^{\parallel}$ enhancement, we evaluate two-dimensional (2D)
superconductivity models incorporating spin-orbit scattering and Rashba-type
spin-orbit coupling. However, none of these mechanisms fully capture the
observed behavior. We discuss the potential role of unconventional pairing,
possibly linked to spin fluctuations. Our findings suggest that, in the 2D
limit, NiBi$_3$ may support a superconducting state beyond the standard
spin-singlet framework.

### Thermodynamic constraints and pseudotransition behavior in a one-dimensional water-like system

- **TL;DR**: 一维水样晶格模型研究，包含范德华力和氢键相互作用，通过化学势允许粒子数涨落。模型在化学势-温度相图中呈现气态、键合液态和稠密液态三个基态相，具有清晰的赝相变特征。

We investigate a one-dimensional water-like lattice model with Van der Waals
and hydrogen-bond interactions, allowing for particle number fluctuations
through a chemical potential. The model, defined on a chain with periodic
boundary conditions, exhibits three ground-state phases: gas, bonded liquid,
and dense liquid, separated by sharp phase boundaries in the chemical potential
and temperature plane. Using the transfer matrix method, we derive exact
analytical results within the grand-canonical ensemble and examine the
finite-temperature behavior. The system exhibits clear pseudotransition
features, including sharp but analytic changes in entropy, density, and
internal energy, along with finite peaks in specific heat and correlation
length. To assess the role of thermodynamic constraints, we consider the
behavior under fixed density through a Legendre transformation. This
constrained analysis reveals smoother anomalies, such as entropy kinks and
finite jumps in specific heat, contrasting with the sharper grand-canonical
signatures. These results underscore the ensemble dependence of
pseudotransitions and show how statistical constraints modulate critical-like
behavior. We also verify that the residual entropy continuity criterion holds
in the grand-canonical ensemble but is violated when the system is constrained.
Our findings illustrate how even a simple one-dimensional model can mimic
water-like thermodynamic anomalies.

### Mixed Quantum-Classical Approaches to Spin Current and Polarization Dynamics in Chiral Molecular Junctions

- **TL;DR**: 该研究结合量子主方程、表面跳跃和Ehrenfest平均场方法，分析了手性分子结中的自旋输运，发现瞬态自旋极化会随时间衰减为零，偏压、分子长度和自旋轨道耦合对自旋电流动力学有重要影响，电子-声子耦合会改变电流-电压特性但基本不影响极化动力学。

Chiral molecular junctions offer a promising platform for realizing
chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS), where spin filtering occurs without
external magnetic fields. Here, we investigate spin transport in such junctions
by combining quantum master equation (QME) methods for purely electronic
dynamics with surface hopping (SH) and mean-field Ehrenfest (MF) approaches to
incorporate electron-phonon coupling. Our results show that transient spin
polarization arises but ultimately decays to zero at long times. We find that
bias voltage, molecular length, and spin-orbit coupling (SOC) strongly
influence the spin current dynamics: higher bias enhances spin current but
reduces polarization, while longer molecules and stronger SOC amplify transient
polarization. Including electron-phonon coupling modifies current-voltage
characteristics, enhancing spin currents at intermediate bias but suppressing
them at high bias, while leaving the polarization dynamics largely unchanged.
These findings highlight the interplay between electronic and vibrational
effects in CISS and provide guidance for designing molecular spintronic
devices.

### Deep Gaussian Process-based Cost-Aware Batch Bayesian Optimization for Complex Materials Design Campaigns

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种基于深度高斯过程(DGP)替代模型和异位查询策略的成本感知批量贝叶斯优化框架，用于高效探索材料设计空间并优化资源分配

The accelerating pace and expanding scope of materials discovery demand
optimization frameworks that efficiently navigate vast, nonlinear design spaces
while judiciously allocating limited evaluation resources. We present a
cost-aware, batch Bayesian optimization scheme powered by deep Gaussian process
(DGP) surrogates and a heterotopic querying strategy. Our DGP surrogate, formed
by stacking GP layers, models complex hierarchical relationships among
high-dimensional compositional features and captures correlations across
multiple target properties, propagating uncertainty through successive layers.
We integrate evaluation cost into an upper-confidence-bound acquisition
extension, which, together with heterotopic querying, proposes small batches of
candidates in parallel, balancing exploration of under-characterized regions
with exploitation of high-mean, low-variance predictions across correlated
properties. Applied to refractory high-entropy alloys for high-temperature
applications, our framework converges to optimal formulations in fewer
iterations with cost-aware queries than conventional GP-based BO, highlighting
the value of deep, uncertainty-aware, cost-sensitive strategies in materials
campaigns.

### Exploring new construction schemes for extended-hierarchy CI (ehCI) wavefunctions

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种新的层次CI方法，通过结合激发和seniority扇区来更一般地划分希尔伯特空间，使用两个权重参数来衡量激发和seniority对波函数的贡献

Following the work of Loos et al. on hierarchy CI (hCI) we propose an
extended way of partitioning the Hilbert space by combining the excitation and
the seniority sectors in a more general way. We define the hierarchy parameter,
h, involving two "weights" (alphas), measuring the importance of excitation (e)
and seniority (s) contributions to the wavefunction according to: h =
{\alpha}1.e + {\alpha}2.s. We test these new CI methods on the dissociation of
chemical systems and analyze them based on the importance of these
contributions.

### Detection of ferroic octupole ordering in $d$-wave altermagnetic rutile-type compounds

We propose that X-ray absorption and emission magnetic circular dichroism
(XAS-MCD and XES-MCD) are promising measurements to directly detect ferroic
higher-rank multipoles as candidate order parameters in altermagnets. Using the
sum rules for XES-MCD and connecting them to multipole language, we demonstrate
that the expectation value of the magnetic octupole moment is finite in the
$d$-wave altermagnetic candidate rutile-type compounds TF$_2$ (T=transition
metal). We also perform spectral calculations of XAS-MCD and XES-MCD based on
an effective model with a full multiplet approach. While the intensity of the
XAS-MCD spectra vanishes, the XES-MCD spectra exhibit finite intensity, whose
spectrum becomes opposite by inverting the N\`eel vector. These results clearly
indicate ferroic magnetic octupole order in these compounds.

### Computational uncertainties in lattice thermal conductivity prediction of crystalline solids

We report computational uncertainties in Boltzmann Transport Equation
(BTE)-based lattice thermal conductivity prediction of 50 diverse
semiconductors from the use of different BTE solvers (ShengBTE, Phono3Py, and
in-house code) and interatomic forces. The interatomic forces are obtained
either using the density functional theory (DFT) as implemented in packages
Quantum Espresso and VASP employing commonly used exchange correlation
functionals (PBE, LDA, PBEsol, and rSCAN) or using the pre-trained foundational
machine learning forcefields trained on two different material datasets.
  We find that the considered BTE solvers introduce minimal uncertainties and,
using the same interatomic force constants, all solvers result in an excellent
agreement with each other, with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of only
1%. While this error increases to around 10% with the use of different DFT
packages, the error is still small and can be reduced further with the use of
stringent planewave energy cutoffs. On the other hand, the differences in
thermal conductivity due to the use of different exchange correlation
functionals are large, with a MAPE of more than 20%. The currently available
pre-trained foundational ML models predict the right trend for thermal
conductivity, but the associated errors are high, limiting their applications
for coarse screening of materials.

### Thermal rectification in jointless Pb solid wire

- **TL;DR**: 在Pb超导材料中实现了无结热二极管，通过磁场方向控制热导率差异，在5.11K低温下获得热整流比1.5-2

Thermal rectification is observed in jointless Pb wires at temperatures near
the superconducting transition of Pb under magnetic fields. Using different
magnetic-field (H) response of temperature dependence of thermal conductivity
(\k{appa}-T) under H parallel to J and H perpendicular to J where J is heat
flow, we fabricated a jointless thermal diode. Thermal rectification is
observed with the thermal rectification ratio (TRR) of 1.5 and the difference
in \k{appa} of 330 W m-1 K-1 at T = 5.11 K under H = 400 Oe for a Pb wire with
a 50%-bent (H perpendicular to J) and 50%-straight (H parallel to J) structure.
The peak temperature of TRR can be tuned by the strength of applied magnetic
field. By changing bent ratio to 40%-bent, a higher TRR exceeding 2 was
observed. The Pb-jointless thermal diode will be a useful material for thermal
management at cryogenic temperatures.

### Quenched properties of the Spectral Form Factor

The Spectral Form Factor (SFF) is defined as the modulus squared of the
partition function in complex temperature for hermitian matrices and a suitable
generalisation has been given in the non hermitian case. In this work we
compute the properties of the quenched SFF for hermitian and non hermitian
random matrices. Despite the fact that the (annealed) SFF is not self-averaging
the quenched SFF is self-averaging but these two averages coincide up to
subleading constants (at least for high enough temperatures). The fluctuations
of $\log \mathrm{SFF}$ are deep and one encounters thin spikes when moving
close to a zero of the partition function. We study the partition function at
late times by considering a suitable change of variable which turns out to be
compatible with a Gumbel distribution. We note that the exponential tails of
this distribution can be obtained by the deep spikes in the $\log
\mathrm{SFF}$, namely the zeros of the partition function. We compare with the
results obtained in isolated many-body systems and we show that same results
hold at late times also for non-hermitian Hamiltonains and non-hermitian random
matrices.

### Theory of Sondheimer magneto-oscillations beyond semiclassical limit

- **TL;DR**: 本文开发了金属薄膜中量子磁导振荡的全面理论，揭示了Sondheimer振荡和Shubnikov-de Haas效应在量子区域的复杂相互作用

In conducting films subjected to an out-of-plane magnetic field, electron
motion along the field direction gives rise to conductance oscillations
periodic in field intensity - a phenomenon known as Sondheimer oscillations.
Traditionally, these oscillations were understood within the semiclassical
framework of kinetic theory. However, their behavior in the quantum regime
(i.e. at strong fields and weak disorder) remains unclear, particularly due to
potential interference with quantum Shubnikov-de Haas magneto-oscillations. In
this work, we develop a comprehensive theory of quantum magnetoconductivity
oscillations in metallic films of finite thickness, fully capturing the
interplay between the Sondheimer and Shubnikov-de Haas effects beyond the
semiclassical limit. By treating surface scattering, in-plane Landau
quantization, and dimensional confinement along the magnetic field direction on
equal footing, we reveal an intricate hierarchy of oscillation patterns and
characterize how their amplitudes and frequencies depend on various physical
parameters. Our results pave the way for systematic characterization of thin
metallic films with boundary-dominated transport properties.

### S1-MatAgent: A planner driven multi-agent system for material discovery

- **TL;DR**: 开发了基于规划器-执行器架构的S1-MatAgent多智能体系统，用于高性能材料发现，在碱性条件下高熵合金催化剂设计中实现了从文献分析到实验验证的全周期闭环设计，性能提升27.7%，从2000万候选材料中筛选出13种高性能催化剂。

The discovery of high-performance materials is crucial for technological
advancement. Inverse design using multi-agent systems (MAS) shows great
potential for new material discovery. However, current MAS for materials
research rely on predefined configurations and tools, limiting their
adaptability and scalability. To address these limitations, we developed a
planner driven multi-agent system (S1-MatAgent) which adopts a Planner-Executor
architecture. Planner automatically decomposes complex materials design tasks,
dynamically configures various tools to generate dedicated Executor agents for
each subtask, significantly reducing reliance on manual workflow construction
and specialized configuration. Applied to high-entropy alloy catalysts for
hydrogen evolution reactions in alkaline conditions, S1-MatAgent completed
full-cycle closed-loop design from literature analysis and composition
recommendation to performance optimization and experimental validation. To
tackle the deviations between designed materials and target, as well as high
experimental verification costs, S1-MatAgent employs a novel composition
optimization algorithm based on gradients of machine learning interatomic
potential, achieving 27.7 % improvement in material performance. S1-MatAgent

We propose a causality-based divide-and-conquer algorithm for nonequilibrium
Green's function calculations with quantics tensor trains. This algorithm
enables stable and efficient extensions of the simulated time domain by
exploiting the causality of Green's functions. We apply this approach within
the framework of nonequilibrium dynamical mean-field theory to the simulation
of quench dynamics in symmetry-broken phases, where long-time simulations are
often required to capture slow relaxation dynamics. We demonstrate that our
algorithm allows to extend the simulated time domain without a significant
increase in the cost of storing the Green's function.

Transition-metal nitrides (TMNs) are currently being studied for potential
applications in energy conversion. In this work, we used the Landauer approach
to relate the various effects contributing to the thermoelectric efficiency of
scandium nitride (ScN) to their microscopic origins. We model the impact of
electronic and structural modifications induced by oxygen impurities and
spatial vacancies on electronic transport in ScN nanostructures. Taking
advantage of the results of our calculations, we propose a theoretical
interpretation of recent experimental results revealing a strong dependence of
the thermoelectric properties of ScN thin films on procedural variations during
fabrication. The thermoelectric properties of ScN are decisively influenced by
structural and electronic factors arising from defects or impurities. Our
findings highlight the potential of this theoretical approach in studying
thermoelectricity and uncovering future strategies to improve thermoelectric
efficiency.

In this paper, we investigate flux-flow instability (FFI) in a
superconducting single-crystal titanium nitride (TiN) film with negligible
volume pinning. By studying the critical current density in 12-nm thick TiN
strips of varying widths, we accurately identify the experimental parameters at
which the FFI regime occurs. A comprehensive analysis of critical velocity
measurements allows us to determine the quasiparticle energy relaxation time,
$\tau_E$. By comparing our results with the $\tau_E$ values obtained from other
experimental methods, we gain insight into the dominant microscopic process
that governs quasiparticle relaxation within the vortex core in TiN. This
mechanism is driven by an increase in quasiparticle temperature relative to
phonons, rather than by quasiparticles leaving the core. Our findings indicate
that $\tau_E$ can be accurately determined through FFI measurements.

We endow the elements of a random matrix drawn from the Gaussian Unitary
Ensemble with a Dyson Brownian motion dynamics. We initialize the dynamics of
the eigenvalues with all of them lumped at the origin, but one outlier. We
solve the dynamics exactly which gives us a window on the dynamical scaling
behavior at and around the Baik-Ben Arous-P\'ech\'e transition. Amusingly,
while the statics is well-known and accessible via the Hikami-Br\'ezin
integrals, our approach for the dynamics is explicitly based on the use of
orthogonal polynomials.

### Density Dependence of the Phases of the $ν= 1$ Integer Quantum Hall Plateau in Low Disorder Electron Gases

Recent magnetotransport measurements in low-disorder electron systems
confined to GaAs/AlGaAs samples revealed that the $\nu = 1$ integer quantum
Hall plateau is broken into three distinct regions. These three regions were
associated with two phases with different types of bulk localization: the
Anderson insulator is due to random quasiparticle localization, and the integer
quantum Hall Wigner solid is due to pinning of a stiff quasiparticle lattice.
We highlight universal properties of the $\nu = 1$ plateau: the structure of
the stability diagram, the non-monotonic dependence of the activation energy on
the filling factor, and the alignment of features of the activation energy with
features of the stability regions of the different phases are found to be
similar in three samples spanning a wide range of electron densities. We also
discuss quantitative differences between the samples, such as the dependence of
the onset temperature and the activation energy of the integer quantum Hall
Wigner solid on the electron density. Our findings provide insights into the
localization behavior along the $\nu = 1$ integer quantum Hall plateau in the
low disorder regime.

This study mainly emphasis the fascinating features of inverse perovskites
Na3AgO using density functional theory (DFT). Inverse perovskite (IP) Na3AgO
structural features have been examined, and the space group and cubic structure
of Pm-3m (221) have been confirmed. The experimental formulation and thermal
stability of IP have been confirmed by the formation energy. Phonon dispersion
curves were used to assess dynamic stability. The dynamic stability of the
examined IP and the bonding strength against cubic structure deformation are
confirmed by the lack of negative frequencies. The energy gap or the
characteristics of semiconducting behaviour have been predicted by the
electronic properties of Na3AgO with a band gap of 1.273 eV. In order to
confirmthe viability of solar cells, the light-dependent properties have also
been identified. Born stability criteria are also used to verify the mechanical
stability, and additional elastic characteristics are identified in order to
forecast the anisotropy, ductility, strength, and hardness. These
anti-perovskites, which possess intriguing characteristics, have the potential
to be effective materials for photovoltaic applications, as indicated by the
analysed findings.

### Diagrammatic bosonisation, aspects of criticality, and the Hohenberg-Mermin-Wagner Theorem in parquet approaches

The parquet equations present a cornerstone of some of the most important
diagrammatic many-body approximations and methods currently on the market for
strongly correlated materials: from non-local extensions of the dynamical
mean-field theory to the functional renormalization group. The recently
introduced single-boson exchange decomposition of the vertex presents an
alternative set of equivalent equations in terms of screened interactions,
Hedin vertices, and rest functions. This formulation has garnered much
attention for several reasons: opening the door to new approximations, for
avoiding vertex divergences associated with local moment formation plaguing the
traditional parquet decomposition, and for its interpretative advantage in its
built-in diagrammatic identification of bosons without resorting to
Hubbard-Stratonovich transformations. In this work, we show how the fermionic
diagrams of the particle-particle and particle-hole polarizations can be mapped
to diagrammatics of a bosonic self-energy of two respective bosonic theories
with pure bosonic constituents, solidifying the identification of the screened
interaction with a bosonic propagator. Resorting to a spin-diagonalized basis
for the bosonic fields and neglecting the coupling between singlet and triplet
components is shown to recover the trace log theory known from
Hubbard-Stratonovich transformations. Armed with this concrete mapping, we
revisit a conjecture claiming that universal aspects of the parquet
approximation coincide with those of the self-consistent screening
approximation for a bosonic $O(N)$ model. We comment on the role of the
self-energy and crossing symmetry in enforcing the Hohenberg-Mermin-Wagner
theorem in parquet-related approaches.

### Ultrafast controlling net magnetization in g-wave altermagnets via laser fields

- **TL;DR**: 激光入射方向对g波反铁磁体CrSb的超快退磁动力学有显著影响，正常入射时保持净零磁化，离轴入射时产生净磁化

The diverse nodal spin structures in d/g/i-wave altermagnets (AM) may cause
distinct light-induced spin responses yet remain poorly understood. Using
time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT), we reveal that laser induced
ultrafast demagnetization dynamics in the g-wave AM CrSb are strongly governed
by the laser incidence direction. Under normal incidence along the [0001] axis,
two Cr sublattices exhibit symmetric temporal demagnetization but with
different amplitudes, preserving the net-zero magnetization, unlike the
behavior in d-wave AM. Off-normal incidence, however, induces pronounced
asymmetric demagnetization between sublattices, transiently driving the system
into a ferrimagnetic-like state with a sizable net magnetization. This
direction-dependent response arises from the characteristic nodal structures in
bulk g-wave AM electronic structure, which enable anisotropic optical intersite
spin transfer (OISTR). By comparing g-wave and d-wave AMs, we propose that
light-induced magnetization arises when laser polarization aligns with
spin-uncompensated regions in electronic structures. This can be readily
determined from the local spin density of states along specific band paths. Our
results provide a fundamental understanding for laser-induced ultrafast
dynamics in AM.

We discover superconductivity in cubic W3Re2C with chiral structure and the
superconducting transition temperature Tc is about 6.2 K. Detailed
characterizations and analysis indicate that W3Re2C is a bulk type-II BCS
superconductor with full isotropic gap. Moreover, first-principles calculations
indicate that the electron-phonon coupling primarily arises from interactions
between W/Re 5d electronic states and their low-frequency phonons. Furthermore,
the breaking of inversion symmetry in W3Re2C facilitates the emergence of Weyl
points in the electronic structure. Therefore, W3Re2C can serve as a promising
platform for investigating the influences of chiral structure on both
superconductivity and band topology.

In this paper we introduce, inspired by Clausius and developing the ideas of
\cite{pre}, the concept of equivalence of transformations in non equilibrium
theory of diffusive systems within the framework of macroscopic fluctuation
theory. Besides providing a new proof of a formula derived in \cite{mft,qc},
which is the basis of the equivalence, we show that equivalent quasistatic
transformations can be distinguished in finite terms, by the renormalized work
introduced in \cite{45,46,mft,qc}. This allows us to tackle the problem of
determining the optimal quasistatic transformation among the equivalent ones.

### Laughlin charge pumping from interplay of chiral Dirac and chiral Majorana modes

Laughlin charge pumping has provided critical insights into the topological
classification of individual materials, but remains largely unexplored in
topological junctions. We explore Laughlin charge pumping in junctions composed
of a chiral topological superconductor sandwiched between two quantum anomalous
Hall insulators, driven by an adiabatically varying magnetic flux. Here, charge
pumping can be mediated merely by chiral Dirac modes or by the interplay of
chiral Dirac and chiral Majorana modes (CMMs). In the former case, a variation
of one magnetic flux quantum induces the pumping of a unit charge, as the
chiral Dirac mode accumulates the full flux-induced phase. In contrast, in the
latter case, pumping a unit charge requires a variation of fractional magnetic
flux quanta, determined by the device geometry and the parity of the number of
enclosed superconducting vortices. This unique feature results from the
charge-neutral and zero-momentum nature of zero-energy CMMs. Our work offers an
experimentally viable pathway toward detecting CMMs and could also inspire
further research into Laughlin charge or spin pumping in diverse topological
junctions, which are now within experimental reach.

### Intrinsic characteristic radius drives phonon anomalies in Janus transition metal dichalcogenide nanotubes

Transition metal dichalcogenides and their derivatives offer a versatile
platform for exploring novel structural and functional properties in
low-dimensional materials. In particular, Janus monolayers possess an intrinsic
out-of-plane asymmetry that induces a built-in bending radius, which can
strongly influence their physical behavior. In this work, we investigate the
tubular structures formed by rolling Janus monolayers into the Janus nanotube
with an extrinsic radius. Using a combination of atomistic simulations and
continuum mechanics, we identify that the total energy of the Janus nanotube is
minimized when the tube radius equals to the intrinsic bending radius of the
Janus monolayer. An analytical expression for this characteristic radius is
derived, providing a theoretical basis for understanding the stability of Janus
nanotubes. Furthermore, we find that the optical phonon modes in these Janus
nanotubes exhibit an anomalous dependence on the tube radius; i.e., their
frequencies reach a maximum value near the characteristic radius, in contrast
to the monotonic increase of optical phonon frequencies with radius in
conventional nanotubes. The phonon anomaly is due to the soft phonon mode
effect induced by the deviation from the most stable tubular configuration with
the characteristic radius. These results uncover a unique coupling between
intrinsic and extrinsic curvature in Janus systems and open new pathways for
tuning vibrational and other properties in curved low-dimensional materials.

The interpretation of experiments on reactive semiconductor surfaces requires
statistically significant sampling of molecular dynamics, but conventional ab
initio methods are limited due to prohibitive computational costs.
Machine-learning interatomic potentials provide a promising solution, bridging
the gap between the chemical accuracy of short ab initio molecular dynamics
(AIMD) and the extensive sampling required to simulate experiment. Using
ethinyl-functionalized cyclooctyne adsorption on Si(001) as a model system, we
demonstrate that conventional AIMD undersamples the configurational space,
resulting in discrepancies with scanning tunnelling microscopy and X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy data. To resolve these inconsistencies, we employ
pre-trained equivariant message-passing neural networks, fine-tuned on only a
few thousand AIMD snapshots, and integrate them into a "molecular-gun"
workflow. This approach generates 10,000 independent trajectories more than
1,000 times faster than AIMD. These simulations recover rare intermediates,
clarify the competition between adsorption motifs, and reproduce the
experimentally dominant on-top [2+2] cycloaddition geometry. Our results show
that fine-tuning of pre-trained foundational models enables statistically
converged, chemically accurate simulations of bond-forming and bond-breaking
events on complex surfaces, providing a scalable route to reconcile atomistic
theory with experimental ensemble measurements in semiconductor
functionalization.

### Competing and Intertwined Orders in Boson-Doped Mott Antiferromagnets

Inspired by the recent experimental advances in cold atom quantum simulators,
we explore the experimentally implemented bosonic $t$-$t'$-$J$ model on the
square lattice using large-scale density matrix renormalization group
simulations. By tuning the doping level $\delta$ and hopping ratio $t'/t$, we
uncover six distinct quantum phases, several of which go far beyond the
conventional paradigm of phase-coherent superfluidity (SF) expected for bosonic
systems. In particular, in the presence of antiferromagnetic (AFM) order, doped
holes are tightly bound into pairs, giving rise to a pair density wave (PDW)
phase at low doping and small $|t'/t|$, which is suppressed on the $t'&lt;0$ side,
resulting in a disordered PDW state that lacks coherence of either individual
bosons or pairs. Upon further doping, bosons can regain phase coherence and
form a SF* state, characterized by condensation at emergent incommensurate
momenta concurrent with an incommensurate magnetic order. On the $t'&gt;0$ side,
the sign-induced kinetic frustration inherently disfavors local AFM
correlations, leading to a phase separation in which doped holes cluster into
ferromagnetic (FM) domains spatially separated by undoped AFM regions. Upon
further doping, this inhomogeneous state evolves into a uniform SF + $xy$-FM
phase. Finally, we propose a concrete experimental scheme to realize both signs
of $t'/t$ in Rydberg tweezer arrays, with an explicit mapping between model
parameters and experimentally accessible regimes. Our results reveal competing
and intertwined orders in doped antiferromagnets, which are relevant to central
issues in high-$T_c$ superconductivity, reflecting the frustrated interplay
between doped holes and spin background.

Accelerating materials development requires quantitative linkages between
processing, microstructure, and properties. In this work, we introduce a
framework for mapping microstructure onto a low-dimensional material manifold
that is parametrized by processing conditions. A key innovation is treating
microstructure as a stochastic process, defined as a distribution of
microstructural instances rather than a single image, enabling the extraction
of material state descriptors that capture the essential process-dependent
features. We leverage the manifold hypothesis to assert that microstructural
outcomes lie on a low-dimensional latent space controlled by only a few
parameters. Using phase-field simulations of spinodal decomposition as a model
material system, we compare multiple microstructure descriptors (two-point
statistics, chord-length distributions, and persistent homology) in terms of
two criteria: (1) intrinsic dimensionality of the latent space, and (2)
invertibility of the processing-to-structure mapping. The results demonstrate
that distribution-based descriptors can recover a two-dimensional latent
structure aligned with the true processing parameters, yielding an invertible
and physically interpretable mapping between processing and microstructure. In
contrast, descriptors that do not account for microstructure variability either
overestimate dimensionality or lose predictive fidelity. The constructed
material manifold is shown to be locally continuous, wherein small changes in
process variables correspond to smooth changes in microstructure descriptors.
This data-driven manifold mapping approach provides a quantitative foundation
for microstructure-informed process design and paves the way toward closed-loop
optimization of processing--structure--property relationships in an integrated
materials engineering context.

The interaction between a particle's spin and momentum -- known as spin-orbit
(SO) coupling -- is the cornerstone of modern spintronics. In Bose-Einsten
condensates of ultracold atoms, SO coupling can be implemented and precisely
controlled experimentally; photonic systems, on the other hand, possess an
intrinsic SO interaction due to the longitudinal-transverse splitting of the
photon modes. In this work, we focus on such spinor, SO-coupled
exciton-polariton condensates on a ring, where the strength of the synthetic
magnetic field is controlled by the geometrical dimensions of the structure.
Inspired by recent experiments, we investigate the dynamics of a
weakly-nonlinear four-mode bosonic Josephson junction within this geometry. We
discover a narrow parameter range in which the interplay of the tunneling
dynamics with polariton-specific SO coupling leads to a new regime, with
dynamical switching of the fluid's circular polarization degree to the
opposite, along the entire ring or on just one of its halves. Our results
demonstrate polariton condensates in ring configurations as excellent
candidates for all-optical controllable spin-switch applications, with
prospects for scalability and observing non-trivial polarization patterns.

We extend the stochastic GW (sGW) formalism to fully spin-polarized systems,
encompassing both collinear and non-collinear spin configurations. For
non-collinear systems-where Kohn-Sham states are complex two-component
spinors-we develop a complex-valued stochastic basis that preserves the
real-valued external stochastic charge applied at time zero. This basis enables
an unbiased evaluation of the random-phase approximation (RPA) screened
interaction for spinors. Through error analysis and tests on real materials, we
show that the performance of collinear sGW retains the same time complexity as
the spin-unpolarized sGW . The non-collinear sGW incurs a computational cost
two to three times higher than the spin-unpolarized version, while preserving
linear scaling with low multiplicity. By unifying collinear and non-collinear
treatments within a single scalable framework, our work paves the way for
routine many-body predictions in large scale magnetic and spin-orbit-coupled
material systems.

The technology of silicon anodes appears to be reaching maturity, with
high-energy Si cells already in pilot-scale production. However, the
performance of these systems can be difficult to replicate in academic
settings, making it challenging to translate research findings into solutions
that can be implemented by the battery industry. Part of this difficulty arises
from the lack of access to engineered Si particles and anodes, as electrode
formulations and the materials themselves have become valuable intellectual
property for emerging companies. Here, we summarize the efforts by Argonne's
Cell Analysis, Modeling, and Prototyping (CAMP) Facility in developing Si-based
prototypes made entirely from commercially available materials. We describe the
many challenges we encountered when testing high-loading electrodes (&gt; 5
mAh/cm2) and discuss strategies to mitigate them. With the right electrode and
electrolyte design, we show that our pouch cells containing &gt; 70 wt% SiOx can
achieve 600-1,000 cycles at C/3 and meet projected energy targets of 700 Wh/L
and 350 Wh/kg. These results provide a practical reference for research teams
seeking to advance silicon-anode development using accessible materials.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种结合图卷积网络(GCN)和长短期记忆(LSTM)的物理信息框架，用于在2D和3D中进行长时间尺度的微观结构演化预测，具有优异的计算效率和跨组成泛化能力。

This paper presents a physics-informed framework that integrates graph
convolutional networks (GCN) with long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture to
forecast microstructure evolution over long time horizons in both 2D and 3D
with remarkable performance across varied metrics. The proposed framework is
composition-aware, trained jointly on datasets with different compositions, and
operates in latent graph space, which enables the model to capture compositions
and morphological dynamics while remaining computationally efficient.
Compressing and encoding phase-field simulation data with convolutional
autoencoders and operating in Latent graph space facilitates efficient modeling
of microstructural evolution across composition, dimensions, and long-term
horizons. The framework captures the spatial and temporal patterns of evolving
microstructures while enabling long-range forecasting at reduced computational
cost after training.

### Mixed order phase transition in a locally constrained exclusion process

We investigate a novel variant of the exclusion process in which particles
perform asymmetric nearest-neighbor jumps across a bond \((k, k+1)\) only if
the preceding site \((k-1)\) is unoccupied. This next-nearest-neighbor
constraint significantly enriches the system's dynamics, giving rise to
long-range correlations and a mixed-order transition controlled by the
asymmetry parameter. We focus on the critical case of half filling, where the
system splits into two ergodic components, each associated with an invariant
reversible measure. The combinatorial structure of this equilibrium
distribution is intimately connected to the \(q\)-Catalan numbers, enabling us
to derive rigorously the asymptotic behavior of key thermodynamic quantities in
the strongly asymmetric regime and to conjecture their behavior in the weakly
asymmetric limit. Even though the system is one-dimensional and has short-range
interactions, an equilibrium phase transition occurs between a clustered phase
-- characterized by slow dynamics, long-range correlations with thermodynamic
additivity, and spontaneous breaking of translational symmetry -- and a fluid
phase where the correlations are short-range and which is thermodynamically
additive. This equilibrium phase transition features characteristics of a
first-order transition, such as a discontinuous order parameter as well as
characteristics of a second-order transition, namely a divergent susceptibility
at the transition point. We also briefly discuss density higher than one half
where ergodicity is broken.

Topological defects are central to modern physics, from spintronics to
photonics, due to their robustness and potential application in information
processing. In this work, we discuss topological point defects that
spontaneously emerge at the imaginary Fermi arcs (degeneracy lines) in momentum
space of two-dimensional systems described by non-Hermitian effective
Hamiltonians. In particular, we consider a generic non-Hermitian Dirac model
and a phenomenological model describing hybrid light-matter quasiparticles -
exciton polaritons hosted in an optical microcavity. In both cases, the
eigenenergies of the system have both real and imaginary parts and form two
distinct bands corresponding to two (pseudo-)spin states. We describe the
trajectories of the point defects characterized by integer-valued topological
winding (vorticity) analytically and show that the defects with opposite
vorticity annihilate with each other in the fully gapped phases, but are
protected from annihilation by the non-Hermitian spectral degeneracies
(exceptional and hybrid points) in the gapless phases. We also suggest that the
signatures of these defects can be experimentally measured in an
exciton-polariton system.

### Data coarse graining can improve model performance

Lossy data transformations by definition lose information. Yet, in modern
machine learning, methods like data pruning and lossy data augmentation can
help improve generalization performance. We study this paradox using a solvable
model of high-dimensional, ridge-regularized linear regression under 'data
coarse graining.' Inspired by the renormalization group in statistical physics,
we analyze coarse-graining schemes that systematically discard features based
on their relevance to the learning task. Our results reveal a nonmonotonic
dependence of the prediction risk on the degree of coarse graining. A
'high-pass' scheme--which filters out less relevant, lower-signal features--can
help models generalize better. By contrast, a 'low-pass' scheme that integrates
out more relevant, higher-signal features is purely detrimental. Crucially,
using optimal regularization, we demonstrate that this nonmonotonicity is a
distinct effect of data coarse graining and not an artifact of double descent.
Our framework offers a clear, analytical explanation for why careful data
augmentation works: it strips away less relevant degrees of freedom and
isolates more predictive signals. Our results highlight a complex, nonmonotonic
risk landscape shaped by the structure of the data, and illustrate how ideas
from statistical physics provide a principled lens for understanding modern
machine learning phenomena.

### Three-Dimensional Domain-Wall Membranes

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一个三维磁性纹理的几何理论，将其表示为嵌入的二维畴壁膜，通过积分畴壁内部轮廓获得简化的二维能量泛函，揭示了曲率、拓扑和微磁能量之间的耦合关系。

Three-dimensional magnetic textures, such as Hopfions, torons, and skyrmion
tubes, possess rich geometric and topological structure, but their detailed
energetics, deformation modes, and collective behavior are yet to be fully
understood. In this work, we develop an effective geometric theory for general
three-dimensional textures by representing them as embedded two-dimensional
orientable domain-wall membranes. Using a local ansatz for the magnetization in
terms of membrane coordinates, we integrate out the internal domain-wall
profile to obtain a reduced two-dimensional energy functional. This functional
captures the coupling between curvature, topology, and the interplay of
micromagnetic energies, and is expressed in terms of a small set of soft-mode
fields: the local wall thickness and in-plane magnetization angle.
Additionally, we construct a local formula for the Hopf index which sheds light
on the coupling between geometry and topology for nontrivial textures. We
analyze the general properties of the theory and demonstrate its utility
through the example of a flat membrane hosting a vortex as well as a toroidal
Hopfion, obtaining analytic solutions for the wall thickness profile,
associated energetics, and a confirmation of the Hopf index formula. The
framework naturally extends to more complex geometries and can accommodate
additional interactions such as Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya, Zeeman, and other
anisotropies, making it a versatile tool for exploring the interplay between
geometry, topology, and micromagnetics in three-dimensional spin systems.

The dispersion of topological surface bands in MnBi$_2$Te$_4$-based magnetic
topological insulator heterostructures is strongly affected by band
hybridization and is spatially inhomogeneous due to varying surface layer
terminations on microscopic length scales. Here, we apply micro-focused
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with tunable photon energy from 18 to
30 eV to distinguish bulk valence and conduction bands from surface bands on
the three surface terminations of MnBi$_6$Te$_10$. We observe a strong
enhancement of photoemission intensity from the topological surface bands at
the Bi O4 absorption edge, which is exploited to visualize a gapless Dirac cone
on the MnBi$_2$Te$_4$-terminated surface and varying degrees of hybridization
effects in the surface bands on the two distinct Bi$_2$Te$_3$-terminated
surfaces.

We investigate the system of two coupled one-dimensional
Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piskunov (FKPP) equations which possess the global
conservation law. Such system of equations has been recently derived for the
quasiparticle densities in the two-band fermionic model with the
particle-number conserving dissipative protocol. As standard FKPP equation the
studied system of equations has one unstable and one stable homogeneous
solution with travelling wave switching between them. We demonstrate that the
conservation law enforces the synchronization of travelling waves for both
densities and determine their minimal possible velocity. Surprisingly, we find
the existence of jumps of the minimal velocity as function of control
parameters. We obtain that the minimal velocity of the coupled FKPP equations
may significantly exceed the minimal velocity for a single FKPP equation in a
wide range of control parameters.

### Spin-photon coupling using circular double quantum dots

We propose and analyze a microwave spin-photon interface based on a circular
double quantum dot, inspired by recent experimental observations of anisotropic
g-factors and ring states in InAs nanowires. We develop an effective
theoretical model capturing the interplay of spin-orbit coupling and the
magnetic flux through the ring and show how ring states form at crossings of
odd and even geometrical parity orbital states. Similar to bonding and
antibonding states of conventional double quantum dots, the ring eigenstates
can be changed into single dot states by detuning the dots, which enables a
high degree of control over the system's properties. Applying a tilted magnetic
field induces spin-charge hybridization which enables spin-photon coupling. For
low disorder, the photons couple states of simultaneously (almost) opposite
spin and angular momentum. With increasing disorder, the spin-photon coupling
becomes analogous to the flopping mode mechanism of conventional double quantum
dots where the spin is hybridized with the bonding and antibonding orbital
states without angular momentum. We show that the system exhibits a
second-order charge-noise sweet spot at a specific magnetic field angle, which
lowers the system's sensitivity to dephasing while retaining a substantial
spin-photon coupling strength. Moreover, the photon coupling mechanism can be
switched off either electrically, by detuning to the single-dot regime, or
magnetically, by rotating the field to disable the spin-charge hybridization.

### High-Throughput Quantification of Altermagnetic Band Splitting

Altermagnetism represents a recently established class of collinear magnetism
that combines zero net magnetization with momentum-dependent spin polarization,
enabled by symmetry constraints rather than spin-orbit coupling. This
distinctive behavior gives rise to sizable spin splitting even in materials
composed of light, earth-abundant elements, offering promising prospects for
next-generation spintronics applications. Despite growing theoretical and
experimental interest, the discovery of altermagnetic materials remains limited
due to the complexity of magnetic symmetry and the inefficiency of conventional
approaches. Here, we present a comprehensive high-throughput screening of the
entire MAGNDATA database, integrating symmetry analysis with spin-polarized
density functional theory (DFT) calculations to identify and characterize
altermagnetic candidates. Our workflow uncovers 173 materials exhibiting
significant spin splitting ($\geq 50$ meV within $\pm 3$ eV of the Fermi
level), spanning both metallic and semiconducting systems. Crucially, our
momentum-resolved analysis reveals that the spin splitting varies strongly
across the Brillouin zone, and that the maximal splitting tends to occur away
from the high-symmetry paths, a result that directly informs and guides future
photoemission experiments. By expanding the catalog of known altermagnets and
elucidating the symmetry-protected origins of spin splitting, this work lays a
robust foundation for future experimental and theoretical advances in
spintronics and quantum materials discovery.

Magnetically controlled states in quantum materials are central to their
unique electronic and magnetic properties. However, direct momentum-resolved
visualization of these states via angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
(ARPES) has been hindered by the disruptive effect of magnetic fields on
photoelectron trajectories. Here, we introduce an \textit{in-situ} method that
is, in principle, capable of applying magnetic fields up to 1 T. This method
uses substrates composed of nanomagnetic metamaterial arrays with alternating
polarity. Such substrates can generate strong, homogeneous, and spatially
confined fields applicable to samples with thicknesses up to the micron scale,
enabling ARPES measurements under magnetic fields with minimal photoelectron
trajectory distortion. We demonstrate this minimal distortion with ARPES data
taken on monolayer graphene. Our method paves the way for probing magnetic
field-dependent electronic structures and studying field-tunable quantum phases
with state-of-the-art energy-momentum resolutions.

Dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) are a class of
  non-equilibrium phase transitions that occur in many-body quantum
  systems during real-time evolution, rather than through parameter
  tuning as in conventional phase transitions. This paper
  presents an exact analytical approach to studying DQPTs by combining
  complex dynamics with the real-space renormalization group (RG).
  RG transformations are interpreted as iterated maps on the complex
  plane, establishing a connection between DQPTs and the Julia set,
  the fractal boundary separating the basins of attraction of the
  stable fixed points. This framework is applied to a quantum quench in
  the one-dimensional transverse field Ising model, and the
  sensitivity of DQPTs to changes in boundary conditions is examined. In
  particular, it is demonstrated how the topology of the spin chain influences
  the occurrence of DQPTs. Additionally, aqualitative argument based on quantum
  speed limits is provided to explain the suppression of DQPTs under certain
  boundary modifications.

### Layer-Dependent Spin Properties of Charge Carriers in Vertically Coupled Telecom Quantum Dots

We investigate the spin properties of charge carriers in vertically coupled
InAs/InAlGaAs quantum dots grown by molecular beam epitaxy, emitting at telecom
C-band wavelengths, with a silicon $\delta$-doped layer. Using time-resolved
pump-probe Faraday ellipticity measurements, we systematically study single-,
two-, and four-layer quantum dot (QD) configurations to quantify how vertical
coupling affects key spin-coherence parameters. Our measurements reveal
distinct layer-dependent effects: (1) Adding a second QD layer flips the
resident charge from electrons to holes, consistent with optically induced
electron tunneling into lower-energy dots and resultant hole charging. (2)
Starting from the four-layer sample, the pump-probe signal develops an
additional non-oscillating, decaying component absent in single- and two-layer
samples, attributed to multiple layer growth changing the strain environment,
which reduces heavy-hole and light-hole mixing. (3) With four-layers or more,
hole spin mode locking (SML) can be observed, enabling quantitative extraction
of the hole coherence time $T_2 \approx 13$\,ns from SML amplitude saturation.
We also extract longitudinal spin relaxation ($T_1$) and transverse ($T_2^*$)
spin dephasing times, g-factors, and inhomogeneous dephasing parameters for
both electrons and holes across all layer configurations. The hole spin
dephasing times $T_2^*$ remain relatively constant (2.26-2.73\,ns) across layer
counts, while longitudinal relaxation times $T_1$ decrease with increasing
layers (from 1.03\,$\mu$s for single-layer to 0.31\,$\mu$s for four-layer
samples). These findings provide potential design guidelines for engineering
spin coherence in telecom-band QDs for quantum information applications.

Moir\'{e} superlattices in transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructures
provide a platform to engineer many-body interactions. Here, we realize a
bichromatic moir\'{e} superlattice in an asymmetric WSe$_2$/WS$_2$/WSe$_2$
heterotrilayer by combining R- and H-stacked bilayers with mismatched moir\'{e}
wavelengths. This structure hosts fermionic quadrupolar moir\'{e} trions --
interlayer excitons bound to an opposite-layer hole -- with vanishing dipole
moments. These trions arise from hybridized moir\'{e} potentials enabling
multiple excitonic orbitals with tunable interlayer coupling, allowing control
of excitonic and electronic ground states. We show that an out-of-plane
electric field could effectively reshape moir\'{e} excitons and
interlayer-intralayer electron correlations, driving a transition from
interlayer to intralayer Mott states with enhanced Coulomb repulsion. The
asymmetric stacking further enriches excitonic selection rules, broadening
opportunities for spin-photon engineering. Our results demonstrate bichromatic
moir\'{e} superlattices as a reconfigurable platform for emergent quantum
states, where quadrupolar moir\'{e} trion emission may enable coherent and
entangled quantum light manipulation.

### A pedestrian's approach to large deviations in semi-Markov processes with an application to entropy production

Semi-Markov processes play an important role in the effective description of
partially accessible systems in stochastic thermodynamics. They occur, for
instance, in coarse-graining procedures such as state lumping and when
analyzing waiting times between few visible Markovian events. The finite-time
measurement of any coarse-grained observable in a stochastic system depends on
the specific realization of the underlying trajectory. Moreover, the
fluctuations of such observables are encoded in their rate function that
follows from the rate function of the empirical measure and the empirical flow
in the respective process. Derivations of the rate function of empirical
measure and empirical flow in semi-Markov processes with direction-time
independence (DTI) exist in the mathematical literature, but have not received
much attention in the stochastic thermodynamics community. We present an
accessible derivation of the rate function of the tuple frequency in
discrete-time Markov chains and extend this to the rate function of the
empirical semi-Markov kernel in semi-Markov processes without DTI. From this,
we derive an upper bound on the rate function of the empirical entropy
production rate, which leads to a lower bound on the variance of the mean
entropy production rate measured along a finite-time trajectory. We illustrate
these analytical bounds with simulated data.

Bottom-up fabrication of inorganic nanostructures is emerging as an
alternative to classical top-down approaches, offering precise nanometer-scale
control at relatively low cost and effort. In particular, DNA nanostructures
provide versatile scaffolds for directly templating the growth of metal
structures. Previously, a DNA mold-based method for metal nanostructure
synthesis has been established that supports a modular structure design and a
high control over the structure formation. So far, this method was limited to
the growth of gold and palladium nanostructures. Here, we report the successful
adaptation of the DNA mold-based fabrication method to produce continuous
silver nanowires. By optimizing reagent concentrations and applying gentle
thermal annealing, we obtain continuous wire structures of several hundred
nanometer length, overcoming limitations in anisotropic growth. Despite the
strong interaction of silver ions with DNA, we can control the growth without
increasing the complexity of our approach. Our structures are not oxidized yet
they did not exhibit conductivity. This work demonstrates the versatility of
DNA-templated metallization and opens new opportunities for constructing
self-assembled hybrid nanostructures with controlled shape and composition.

- **TL;DR**: 非厄米系统中零间接带隙的稳定性及其对非厄米趋肤效应的抑制作用

Zero indirect gaps in band models are typically viewed as unstable and
achievable only through fine-tuning. Recent works, however, have revealed
robust semimetallic phases in Hermitian systems where the indirect gap remains
pinned at zero over a finite parameter range. Here, we extend this paradigm to
non-Hermitian lattice models by studying a one-dimensional diamond-like system
with gain and loss. We show that a zero indirect band gap can remain stable
against non-Hermitian perturbations and identify the regimes where this
robustness persists. Remarkably, we find that the zero indirect gap induces a
suppression of the non-Hermitian skin effect distinct from other physical
mechanics already discussed in the literature. Our results reveal new
connections between indirect gaps, exceptional points and non-Hermitian skin
effect, opening avenues for experimental realizations.

In recent years, sliding ferroelectricity has emerged as a topic of
significant interest due to its possible application in non-volatile random
access memory. This phenomenon is unique to two-dimensional van der Waals
materials, where vertical ferroelectric polarization switching is induced by
relative in-plane sliding of the constituent layers. The intrinsic stacking
order influences the resulting polarization, creating distinct polarization
regions separated by domain walls. These regions and the domain walls can be
manipulated using an applied vertical electric field, enabling a switchable
system that retains the environmental robustness of van der Waals materials
under ambient conditions. This study investigates 3R-MoS$_2$ using various
optical measurement techniques at room temperature. The spatially resolved
optical measurements reveal apparent signal changes corresponding to different
ferroelectric stacking orders and variations in layer count. Our findings
demonstrate that fast optical mapping at room temperature is a reliable method
for probing ferroelectric potential steps in 3R-stacked MoS$_2$ samples,
thereby facilitating the identification of the ferroelectric configuration.
This approach does not require a conductive substrate or an electrical contact
to the sample, making it more versatile than traditional atomic force probe
techniques.

- **TL;DR**: 开发了一个高效计算框架来量化拓扑半金属纳米线的表面态传输，通过大规模模拟发现TiS、ZrB2和氮化物等材料在超小尺寸下的电导性能优于铜，为克服铜互连的尺寸限制提供了数据驱动的解决方案。

The sharp increase in resistivity of copper interconnects at ultra-scaled
dimensions threatens the continued miniaturization of integrated circuits.
Topological semimetals (TSMs) with gapless surface states (Fermi arcs) provide
conduction channels resistant to localization. Here we develop an efficient
computational framework to quantify 0K surface-state transmission in nanowires
derived from Wannier tight-binding models of topological conductors that
faithfully reproduce relativistic density functional theory results. Sparse
matrix techniques enable scalable simulations incorporating disorder and
surface roughness, allowing systematic materials screening across sizes,
chemical potentials, and transport directions. A dataset of 3000 surface
transmission values reveals TiS, ZrB$_{2}$, and nitrides AN where A=(Mo, Ta, W)
as candidates with conductance matching or exceeding copper and benchmark TSMs
NbAs and NbP. This dataset further supports machine learning models for rapid
interconnect compound identification. Our results highlight the promise of
topological conductors in overcoming copper's scaling limits and provide a
roadmap for data-driven discovery of next-generation interconnects.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究展示了如何通过将单层WSe₂与金属性2H-NbSe₂界面结合，使WSe₂的自旋轨道分裂K点能谷产生约800meV的能带偏移，从而形成仅由自旋极化载流子占据的表面局域费米面，为自旋电子器件开发提供了潜在材料平台。

Discovering and engineering spin-polarised surface states in the electronic
structures of condensed matter systems is a crucial first step in development
of spintronic devices, wherein spin-polarised bands crossing the Fermi level
can facilitate information transfer. Here, we show how the spin-orbit split
K-point valleys of monolayer WSe$_2$ can be made potentially suitable for this
purpose, despite the semiconducting ground state. By interfacing with metallic
2H-NbSe$_2$, these valence band extrema are shifted by $\sim$800~meV to produce
a surface-localised Fermi surface populated only by spin-polarised carriers. By
increasing the WSe$_2$ thickness, the Fermi pockets can be moved from K to
$\Gamma$, demonstrating tunability of novel semi-metallic phases that exist
atop a substrate additionally possessing charge density wave and
superconducting transitions. Together, this study provides spectroscopic
understanding into $p$-type, Schottky barrier-free interfaces, which are of
urgent interest for bypassing the limitations of current-generation vertical
field effect transistors, in addition to longer-term spintronics development.

### Towards a deeper fundamental understanding of (Al,Sc)N ferroelectric nitrides

- **TL;DR**: 本文通过第一性原理计算和Landau模型研究Al1-xScxN氮化物的铁电性质，发现在Sc含量0-40%范围内存在两种能量极小结构：极性wurtzite结构和准电六方H5相。随着Sc浓度增加，H5相逐渐成为最低能量态。研究揭示了极化-应变耦合的关键作用以及Sc浓度对相变的影响机制。

Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, within the virtual crystal
alloy approximation, are performed, along with the development of a Landau-type
model employing a symmetry-allowed analytical expression of the internal energy
and having parameters being determined from first principles, to investigate
properties and energetics of Al1-xScxN ferroelectric nitrides in their
hexagonal forms. These DFT computations and this model predict the existence of
two different types of minima, namely the 4-fold-coordinated wurtzite (WZ)
polar structure and a 5-times paraelectric hexagonal phase (to be denoted as
H5), for any Sc composition up to 40%. The H5 minimum progressively becomes the
lowest energy state within hexagonal symmetry as the Sc concentration increases
from 0 to 40%. Furthermore, the model points out to several key findings.
Examples include the crucial role of the coupling between polarization and
strains to create the WZ minimum, in addition to polar and elastic energies,
and that the origin of the H5 state overcoming the WZ phase as the global
minimum within hexagonal symmetry when increasing the Sc composition mostly
lies in the compositional dependency of only two parameters, one linked to the
polarization and another one being purely elastic in nature. Other examples are
that forcing Al1-xScxN systems to have no or a weak change in lattice
parameters when heating them allows to reproduce well their finite-temperature
polar properties, and that a value of the axial ratio close to that of the
ideal WZ structure does imply a large polarization at low temperatures but not
necessarily at high temperatures because of the ordered-disordered character of
the temperature-induced formation of the WZ state. Such findings should allow
for a better fundamental understanding of (Al,Sc)N ferroelectric nitrides,
which may be used to design efficient devices operating at low voltages.
