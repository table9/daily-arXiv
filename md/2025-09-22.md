- **TL;DR**: 本文提出了一个具有可调贝里曲率分布的简单连续模型，用于系统研究几何非平凡能带中的结晶现象。在非相互作用极限下，通过添加C6对称周期势得到了丰富的相图，并在弱势区域推导了陈数的通用公式。考虑库仑相互作用后，相图中出现了多种晶态，包括反常霍尔晶体、光环维格纳晶体等新相。

Recent experiments on multilayer graphene systems have rekindled interest in
electronic crystal phases in two dimensions -- but now for phases enriched by
non-trivial quantum geometry. In this work, we introduce a simple continuum
model with tunable Berry curvature distribution and total flux, enabling
systematic study of crystallization in geometrically nontrivial bands. In the
noninteracting limit, the addition of a C6-symmetric periodic potential yields
a rich phase diagram, for which we provide several analytical insights.
Notably, we derive a general formula for the Chern number in the weak-potential
regime that is broadly applicable to single-band projected models. Removing the
periodic potential and treating Coulomb interactions self-consistently at the
Hartree-Fock level, the resulting phase diagrams host a variety of crystalline
states, including anomalous Hall crystals, halo Wigner crystals in which
localized electrons spontaneously acquire orbital angular momentum leading to
depleted electron occupation at the zone center, and a novel halo anomalous
Hall crystal that combines these properties with a finite Chern number. We
identify why these phases are energetically favorable through analytical and
energetic considerations. Our results provide insight into the interplay
between crystallization and band geometry, while also offering a simple toy
model amenable to numerical methods beyond mean-field.

- **TL;DR**: 提出一种基于线性自回归机器学习的计算框架，用于扩展强关联系统的短时短距离数值模拟结果，显著提高谱函数的分辨率。

The quality of numerically simulated spectra using real-time evolution
methods for strongly correlated systems is affected by both the length of
simulation time and the system size, limiting resolution in both frequency and
momentum. In this work, we propose a computationally cheap, linear
autoregressive machine learning-based framework to extend short-time and
distance results over a wider range. We demonstrate the proposed method to
extend the lesser Green's function for both the Hubbard model and the much more
computationally challenging Hubbard-extended Holstein model. This technique
significantly improves both the frequency and momentum resolution of the
single-particle removal spectrum $\mathcal{A}(k,\omega)$, allowing observation
of otherwise obscured spectral features due to electron-phonon coupling.

Altermagnet is a newly discovered magnetic phase, characterized by
non-relativistic spin-splitting that has been experimentally observed. Here, we
introduce a framework dubbed {\it spin-orbital altermagnetism} to achieve
spin-orbital textures in altermagnetic materials. We identify two distinct
classes of spin-orbital altermagnetism: intrinsic and extrinsic. The intrinsic
type emerges from symmetry-compensated magnetic orders with spontaneously
broken parity-time symmetry, while the extrinsic type stems from
translational-symmetry breaking between sublattices, as exemplified by the
Jahn-Teller-driven structural phase transition. In addition to directly
measuring the spin-orbital texture, we propose spin conductivity and
spin-resolved orbital polarization as effective methods for detecting these
altermagnets. Additionally, a symmetry-breaking mechanism induces weak spin
magnetization, further revealing the peculiar feature of spin-orbital
altermagnetism. We also utilize the staggered susceptibility to illustrate a
potential realization of this phase in a two-orbital interacting system. Our
work provides a new platform to explore spin-orbital locked physics, extending
the materials classes that may display complex spin textures from the standard
$4d-5d$ compounds to $3d$ compounds.

### Correlation Effects on Magnetic Structure and Lattice Dynamics of LaMn$_7$O$_{12}$: A First-Principles Study

- **TL;DR**: 本文通过两种DFT+U方法系统研究了LaMn₇O₁₂的磁相图和晶格动力学，确定了与实验观测一致的AFM构型的最佳U和J参数，验证了AFM相的动力学稳定性。

LaMn$_7$O$_{12}$, a quadruple perovskite oxide (AA'$_3$B$_4$O$_{12}$-type),
has attracted attention for its notable bifunctional activity in oxygen
evolution and reduction reactions. Here, we systematically investigate the
magnetic phase diagram and lattice dynamics of LaMn$_7$O$_{12}$ using two
density functional theory plus Hubbard U (DFT + U) approaches: the spin-density
and the charge-only-density formalism. Phase diagram analysis as a function of
U and J shows that both methods stabilize the experimentally observed
antiferromagnetic (AFM) configuration (C-type AFM at the B-site and
ferrimagnetic structure at the A'-site Mn ions) at U = 3.5 eV and J = 0.8 eV.
These U and J values are consistent with those obtained from the constrained
random phase approximation. Furthermore, we observe the dynamical stability of
the AFM phase through phonon dispersion curves and analyze the Raman-active
phonon modes. These results highlight the critical role of appropriate U and J
parameters in accurately describing the properties of LaMn$_7$O$_{12}$.

### Long-lived dynamics of the charge density wave in TiSe$_2$ observed by neutron scattering

- **TL;DR**: 通过时间分辨弹性中子散射结合快速激光加热研究1T-TiSe$_2$中电荷密度波（CDW）的熔化和重整过程，揭示了CDW熔化通过非热途径进行，与超晶格声子（如软模）的损失相关。

Time-resolved elastic neutron scattering combined with rapid laser heating
was used to probe the charge density wave (CDW) state in 1T-TiSe$_2$, capturing
both the melting and reformation of the CDW on long timescales and providing
clues on the roles of phonons and excitons. With the laser source on,
superlattice Bragg peaks such as (-1.5, -1.5, 1.5) observed below the CDW
transition due to the new lattice periodicity, dissipate within 5 seconds, at a
rate that is much slower than the sample's thermal response to the heat wave
propagation. Whereas the electronic ordering associated with the CDW phase is
disrupted rapidly by the laser-induced heating, the periodic lattice distortion
(PLD) exhibits a markedly slower evolution during the melting process. This
delayed suppression of the PLD relative to the thermal response indicates that
CDW melting proceeds through a nonthermal pathway, likely linked to the loss of
superlattice phonons such as the soft mode at q = (0.5 ,0, 0.5 ).

### What does it mean for a system to compute?

- **TL;DR**: 本文提出了一个广泛适用的框架，用于识别动态系统执行的计算，通过将动态系统的演化映射到抽象计算机的演化来定义计算。

Many real-world dynamic systems, both natural and artificial, are understood
to be performing computations. For artificial dynamic systems, explicitly
designed to perform computation - such as digital computers - by construction,
we can identify which aspects of the dynamic system match the input and output
of the computation that it performs, as well as the aspects of the dynamic
system that match the intermediate logical variables of that computation. In
contrast, in many naturally occurring dynamical systems that we understand to
be computers, even though we neither designed nor constructed them - such as
the human brain - it is not a priori clear how to identify the computation we
presume to be encoded in the dynamic system. Regardless of their origin,
dynamical systems capable of computation can, in principle, be mapped onto
corresponding abstract computational machines that perform the same operations.
In this paper, we begin by surveying a wide range of dynamic systems whose
computational properties have been studied. We then introduce a very broadly
applicable framework for identifying what computations(s) are emulated by a
given dynamic system. After an introduction, we summarize key examples of
dynamical systems whose computational properties have been studied. We then
introduce a very broadly applicable framework that defines the computation
performed by a given dynamical system in terms of maps between that system's
evolution and the evolution of an abstract computational machine. We illustrate
this framework with several examples from the literature, in particular
discussing why some of those examples do not fully fall within the remit of our
framework. We also briefly discuss several related issues, such as
uncomputability in dynamical systems, and how to quantify the value of
computation in naturally occurring computers.

### A new family of seniority-restricted coupled cluster methods

- **Categories**: physics.chem-ph
- **TL;DR**: 本文提出了一种新的耦合簇方法——seniority-restricted coupled cluster (sr-CC)，利用seniority概念来提高电子结构计算的效率和精度。

We introduce a novel class of coupled cluster (CC) methods that leverage the
seniority concept to enhance efficiency and accuracy in electronic structure
calculations. While existing approaches, such as the pair coupled cluster
doubles (pCCD) method, are limited to seniority-zero ({\Omega} = 0)
wavefunctions,1 we propose a more flexible framework: seniority-restricted
coupled cluster (sr-CC). This new methodology selectively constrains the
seniority sectors accessible through excitation operators in the cluster
expansion, enabling a more systematic exploration of electron correlation
effects. By balancing computational cost and accuracy, sr-CC provides a
promising pathway for advancing electronic structure theory, particularly in
strongly correlated systems.

### Quantum oscillations in two-dimensional hole gases with competing cyclotron and Zeeman energy

Evaluation of critical bandstructure and quantum transport parameters in
two-dimensional systems is challenging when competition emerges among different
energy scales shaping quantum oscillations in a magnetic field. Here we
overcome this challenge in low-disorder strained germanium quantum wells by
evaluating self-consistently effective mass, g-factor, and quantum lifetime. As
a result, we estimate a quantum mobility of 133(3)$\times$10$^3$ cm$^2$/Vs,
setting a benchmark for 2D holes in group IV semiconductors. The high quality
of the hole gas if further highlighted by observing clean fractional quantum
Hall states at low magnetic field and low density.

### Surface diffusion: The intermediate scattering function seen as a characteristic function of probability theory

- **TL;DR**: 该论文将表面扩散中的中间散射函数视为概率论中的特征函数，从而解析地获得吸附物位置概率分布函数的矩和累积量，特别是与扩散系数相关的二阶矩。

In surface diffusion, one of the key observables is the so-called
intermediate scattering function which is measured directly from the surface
technique called Helium spin echo. In this work, we show that this function can
be seen as a characteristic function of probability theory. From the
characteristic function, the moments and cumulants of the probability
distribution function of the position of the adsorbate are straightforward
obtained in an analytical way; in particular, the second order which is related
to the diffusion coefficient. In order to illustrate this simple theory, we
have focused on the incoherent tunneling of H and D on a Pt(111) surface where
only jumps between nearest neighbor sites have been reported experimentally.
Finally, an extension to jumps to more than nearest neighbors has also been
considered.

- **TL;DR**: 本文研究了非中心对称超导体PbTaSe$_2$在静水压力下的超导性质，发现临界压力下表面超导与体超导分离，表面超导为s波配对，但未观测到零偏压电导峰，这对实现马约拉纳束缚态的理论方案提出了限制。

Noncentrosymmetric superconductor PbTaSe$_2$, hosting bulk nodal-line
fermions (Phys. Rev. B. 89, 020505) and spin-helical surface states (Nature
Communication 7, 10556), represents a prime candidate for realizing topological
superconductivity and Majorana bound states (MBS). However, the definitive
experimental signature of MBS in this system has thus far remained elusive.
Here we provide a comprehensive investigation of its superconducting properties
under hydrostatic pressure. Combining Andreev reflection spectroscopy and
temperature-dependent resistance measurements, we identify a separated
surface-like superconductivity from the bulk one at a critical pressure $P_c$.
The superconducting surface state demonstrate an $s$-wave pairing state with a
strong coupling strength. Under magnetic fields, the absence of zero-bias
conductance peak in the pressurized point-contact Andreev reflection spectrum.
Our findings imposes a constraint on the theoretical proposals for realizing
Majorana bound states in noncentrosymmetric superconductors.

### Novel Quantum Spin Liquid states in the $S = {\frac{1}{2}}$ three-dimensional compound Y$_{3}$Cu$_{2}$Sb$_{3}$O$_{14}$

The three-dimensional $S = 1/2$ system Y$_{3}$Cu$_{2}$Sb$_{3}$O$_{14}$
consists of two inequivalent Cu$^{2+}$ ions, each forming edge shared
triangular lattices. Our magnetic susceptibility $\chi(T)=M/H$, specific heat
$C_p(T)$, $^{89}$Y nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), muon spin relaxation
($\mu$SR), and electron spin resonance (ESR) measurements on this system
confirm the absence of any long-range magnetic ordering and the persistence of
spin dynamics down to 0.077 K. From $^{89}$Y NMR we find evidence of a
transition at about 120 K which we suggest to arise from a fraction of the
spins condensing into a singlet (a valence bond solid VBS or a quantum spin
liquid QSL) state. A plateau in the muon relaxation rate is observed between 60
K and 10 K (signifying the VBS/QSL state from a fraction of the spins) followed
by an increase and another plateau below about 1 K (presumably signifying the
VBS/QSL state from all the spins). Our density functional theory calculations
find a dominant antiferromagnetic interaction along the body diagonal with
inequivalent Cu(1) and Cu(2) ions alternately occupying the corners of the
cube. All other near neighbour interactions between the Cu ions are also found
to be antiferromagnetic and are thought to drive the frustration.

### First-principles calculation of higher-order elastic constants from divided differences

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种基于第一性原理计算固体材料高阶弹性常数的方法，该方法结合有限应变变形、密度泛函理论和递归数值微分技术，适用于任意对称性的材料。

A method is presented to calculate from first principles the higher-order
elastic constants of a solid material. The method relies on finite strain
deformations, a density functional theory approach to calculate the Cauchy
stress tensor, and a recursive numerical differentiation technique homologous
to the divided differences polynomial interpolation algorithm. The method is
applicable as is to any material, regardless its symmetry, to calculate elastic
constants of, in principle, any order. Here, we introduce conceptual framework
and technical details of our method, we discuss sources of errors, we assess
convergence trends, and we present selected applications. In particular, our
method is used to calculate elastic constants up to the 6$^{th}$ order of two
crystalline materials with the cubic symmetry, silicon and gold. To demonstrate
general applicability, our method is also used to calculate the elastic
constants up to the 5$^{th}$ order of $\alpha$-quartz, a crystalline material
belonging to the trigonal crystal system, and the second- and third-order
elastic constants of kevlar, a material with an anisotropic bonding network.
Higher order elastic constants computed with our method are validated against
density functional theory calculations by comparing stress responses to large
deformations derived within the continuum approximation.

- **TL;DR**: DeepMech是一个基于图的深度学习框架，用于预测完整的化学反应机制，通过原子和键级注意力机制以及广义模板实现高精度预测。

Prediction of complete step-by-step chemical reaction mechanisms (CRMs)
remains a major challenge. Whereas the traditional approaches in CRM tasks rely
on expert-driven experiments or costly quantum chemical computations,
contemporary deep learning (DL) alternatives ignore key intermediates and
mechanistic steps and often suffer from hallucinations. We present DeepMech, an
interpretable graph-based DL framework employing atom- and bond-level
attention, guided by generalized templates of mechanistic operations (TMOps),
to generate CRMs. Trained on our curated ReactMech dataset (~30K CRMs with 100K
atom-mapped and mass-balanced elementary steps), DeepMech achieves
98.98+/-0.12% accuracy in predicting elementary steps and 95.94+/-0.21% in
complete CRM tasks, besides maintaining high fidelity even in
out-of-distribution scenarios as well as in predicting side and/or byproducts.
Extension to multistep CRMs relevant to prebiotic chemistry, demonstrates the
ability of DeepMech in effectively reconstructing pathways from simple
primordial substrates to complex biomolecules such as serine and aldopentose.
Attention analysis identifies reactive atoms/bonds in line with chemical
intuition, rendering our model interpretable and suitable for reaction design.

### Electrodynamics of carbon nanotubes with non-local surface conductivity

- **TL;DR**: 本文提出了一个用于处理具有非局域表面电导率的碳纳米管（CNT）电动力学的新框架，通过Kubo技术和Dirac方程建立了非局域电导率模型，并分析了CNT表面电磁场的有效边界条件和本征模式。

A new framework that can be utilized for the electrodynamics of carbon
nanotubes (CNTs) with non-local surface conductivity (spatial dispersion) is
presented. The model of non-local conductivity is developed on the basis of the
Kubo technique applied to the Dirac equation for pseudospins. As a result, the
effective boundary conditions for the electromagnetic (EM) field on a CNT
surface are formulated. The dispersion relation for the eigenmodes of an
infinitely long CNT is obtained and analyzed. It is shown that due to
nonlocality, a new type of eigenmodes are created that disappear in the local
conductivity limit. These eigenmodes should be properly accounted for in the
correct formulation of the CNT end conditions for the surface current, which
are manifested in the EM-field scattering problem. Additional boundary
conditions that consider nonlocality effects are also formulated based on the
exact solution obtained for the surface current by means of using the
Wiener-Hopf (WH) technique for a semi-infinite CNT. The scattering pattern of
the EM-field is simulated by a finite-length model of a CNT, using a
numerically solved integral equation for the surface current density and its
approximate analytical solution. Thus, the scattering field of a CNT prevailing
in the wide frequency range from THz to infrared light is analytically solved
and analyzed. The newly obtained results are then utilized for determining the
optical forces exerted on a CNT of finite length. Potential applications for
the design of nanoantennas and other electronic devices, including pointing out
some future directions, are also discussed.

### Entropic balance with feedback control: information equalities and tight inequalities

- **TL;DR**: 本文研究了在反馈控制波动势下过阻尼物理系统的热力学行为，提出了基于马尔可夫描述的熵平衡分析框架，获得了新的第二类等式和可提取功的界限。

We consider overdamped physical systems evolving under a feedback-controlled
fluctuating potential and in contact with a thermal bath at temperature $T$. A
Markovian description of the dynamics, which keeps only the last value of the
control action, is advantageous -- both from the theoretical and the practical
side -- for the entropy balance. Novel second-law equalities and bounds for the
extractable work are obtained, the latter being both tighter and easier to
evaluate than those in the literature based on the whole chain of controller
actions. The Markovian framework also allows us to prove that the bound for the
extractable work that incorporates the unavailable information is saturated in
a wide class of physical systems, for error-free measurements. These results
are illustrated in a model system. For imperfect measurements, there appears an
interval of measurement uncertainty, including the point at which work ceases
to be extracted, where the new Markovian bound is tighter than the unavailable
information bound.

We report observations of Higgs modes in superconducting Titanium
nanostructures at very low temperature. They appear as anomalies in the
microwave complex impedance of the samples revealed by the presence of a dc
supercurrent. By varying the sample geometry and contact material, we probe how
the Higgs modes are sensitive to the dimensionality of superconductivity, the
penetration of the dc and ac current densities in the sample and the
dissipation in the contacts.

### Non-Fermi liquid behaviour of CDW instabilities in fractionally-filled moiré flatbands

- **TL;DR**: 该论文研究了自旋和谷极化的分数填充莫尔平带中的非费米液体行为，重点关注四分之一填充时由费米面嵌套引起的电荷密度波（CDW）序及其相变。

Spin- and valley-polarized fractionally-filled moir\'e flatbands are known to
host emergent Fermi-liquid phases, when analyzed with the help of a dual
description in terms of holes. The dominant Coulomb interactions in an almost
flatband endow the fermions with a nontrivial dispersion, when the system is
described in terms of the hole operators (rather than the particle operators).
In particular, for one-fourth filling, the Fermi surface takes a
quasi-triangular shape, which brings about the possibility of
charge-density-wave (CDW) ordering in the ground state, characterized by the
nesting vectors ($ \mathbf{Q}_n $). The $\mathbf{Q}_n$'s connect antipodal
points of the Fermi surface (designated as hot-spots) and are found to belong
to the space of reciprocal vectors of the underlying honeycomb structure. The
resulting CDW order can be described in terms of instabilities caused by
bosonic fields with momenta centred at $\lbrace \mathbf{Q}_n \rbrace $,
coupling with the fermions residing in the vicinity of a pair of antipodal
hot-spots. When there is a transition from a Fermi liquid to a CDW state, the
bosons become massless (or critical), effectuating a non-Fermi liquid
behaviour. We set out to identify such non-Fermi liquid phases after
constructing a minimal effective action.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文研究了铁磁性Co₂MnSn中的异常霍尔和能斯特效应，发现其拓扑Weyl点产生显著的Berry曲率，驱动了主要的本征异常输运效应，并通过化学替代方法增强了这些效应。

Magnetic topological semimetals often exhibit unusual electronic and thermal
transport due to nontrivial bulk band crossings, enabling simultaneous
realization of large anomalous Hall and Nernst conductivities ($\sigma_{xy}$
and $\alpha_{xy}$). Here, a comprehensive experimental and theoretical study of
the anomalous transport properties of ferromagnetic Co$_2$MnSn is reported.
First-principles calculations reveal topological Weyl points producing
significant Berry curvature, driving dominant intrinsic anomalous Hall/Nernst
effects. Electronic and thermal transport measurements demonstrate robust
anomalous transport with substantial conductivity values that persist at room
temperature ($\sigma_{xy}\sim$ 500 S/cm, $\alpha_{xy}\sim$ 1.3 A/m/K). We also
show how the chemical substitution (via tuning Fermi level) can boost these
effects (up to $\sigma_{xy}\sim$ 1376 S/cm, $\alpha_{xy}\sim$ 1.49 A/m/K at 150
K). These findings position Co$_2$MnSn as a compelling platform for exploring
topological transport phenomena and advancing next-generation thermoelectric
and spintronic technologies.

In this work, we incorporate long-range electrostatic interactions in the
form of the Coulomb model with fixed charges into the functional form of
short-range machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs), particularly in
the Moment Tensor Potential and Equivariant Tensor Network potential. We show
that explicit incorporation of the Coulomb interactions with fixed charges
leads to a significant reduction of energy fitting errors, namely, more than
four times, of short-range MLIPs trained on organic dimers of charged
molecules. Furthermore, with our long-range models we demonstrate a significant
improvement in the prediction of the binding curves of the organic dimers of
charged molecules. Finally, we show that the results calculated with MLIPs are
in good correspondence with those obtained with density functional theory for
organic dimers of charged molecules.

### Absence of skewness in the voltage fluctuations of a tunnel junction in the quantum regime

- **Authors**: Clovis Farley, Bertrand Reulet
- **Categories**: cond-mat.mes-hall
- **TL;DR**: Error

Current fluctuations in a tunnel junction have a remarkable property: On the
one hand, their variance corresponds to vacuum fluctuations at low voltage bias
$V$, when the electron energy $eV$ is smaller than the photon detection energy
$hf$ . On the other hand, their skewness, i.e. their third moment, is frequency
independent, equal to $e^2I$ as if electron transport were simply Poissonian.
We address the following question: Could it be that at low voltage, the vacuum
fluctuations generated by the junction have a finite skewness, i.e. that the
junction generates skewed vacuum ? To answer this question we calculate the
effect of an arbitrary electromagnetic environment at zero temperature and show
that the bispectrum of third moment of voltage fluctuations of any quantum
conductor is always zero at frequencies larger than the voltage. We also show
experimental data on tunnel junctions in the quantum regime that agree with our
calculation.

- **TL;DR**: 本文提出了一种通过梯度下降调整热力学计算机参数的方法，使其能在指定观测时间执行所需计算。该方法在数字模拟中训练热力学计算机，使其动力学能够模拟神经网络的计算过程。

We show how to adjust the parameters of a thermodynamic computer by gradient
descent in order to perform a desired computation at a specified observation
time. Within a digital simulation of a thermodynamic computer, training
proceeds by maximizing the probability with which the computer would generate
an idealized dynamical trajectory. The idealized trajectory is designed to
reproduce the activations of a neural network trained to perform the desired
computation. This teacher-student scheme results in a thermodynamic computer
whose finite-time dynamics enacts a computation analogous to that of the neural
network. The parameters identified in this way can be implemented in the
hardware realization of the thermodynamic computer, which will perform the
desired computation automatically, driven by thermal noise. We demonstrate the
method on a standard image-classification task, and estimate the thermodynamic
advantage -- the ratio of energy costs of the digital and thermodynamic
implementations -- to exceed seven orders of magnitude. Our results establish
gradient descent as a viable training method for thermodynamic computing,
enabling application of the core methodology of machine learning to this
emerging field.

By measuring the shot noise, a consequence of charge quantization, in
superconductor/insulator/ferromagnet (V/MgO/Fe) junctions, we discover a giant
increase, orders of magnitude larger than expected. The origin of this giant
noise is a peculiar realization of a superconducting proximity effect, where a
simple superconductor influences its neighbors. Our measurements reveal largely
unexplored implications of orbital-symmetry-controlled proximity effects. The
importance of orbital symmetries and the accompanying spin-orbit coupling is
manifested by an unexpected emergence of another superconducting region
strikingly different from the parent superconductor. Unlike vanadium's common
spin-singlet superconductivity, the broken inversion symmetry in V/MgO/Fe
junctions and the resulting interfacial spin-orbit coupling leads to the
formation of spin-triplet superconductivity across the ferromagnetic iron. Here
we show that the enhanced shot noise, known from Josephson junctions with two
superconductors, is measured even in a single superconductor, this discovery
motivates revisiting how the spin-orbit coupling and superconducting proximity
effects can transform many materials.

We study two-particle coherent states and their dynamics in the lowest Landau
level (LLL) under the influence of quadratic potentials. We focus on
generalized coherent states that describe Abelian anyons in the LLL and are
associated with the $\mathfrak{su}(1,1)$ Lie algebra. We draw on parallels with
quantum optics and symmetry properties of the coherent states considered here
to analytically calculate quantities such as a bunching parameter, which
depends on quantum statistics, as well as coherent state trajectories under the
influence of generic quadratic potentials. Our results show that in unbounded
saddle potentials, the bunching parameter governs the trajectories which show
exponentially diverging behavior in a manner that depends on quantum
statistics. In bounded elliptical potentials, the bunching parameter is
oscillatory and its maximum magnitude depends on the eccentricity of the
applied potential. We draw connections between our analyses and the key
concepts that underlie anyon detection in recent experiments.

Ruthenates comprise an interesting class of materials with a wide range of
extremely exciting properties, and thus the discovery of new stable ruthenates
remains an active area of investigation. We report the crystal growth and
comprehensive studies including crystal and electronic structure, magnetic and
electrochemical properties of a hexavalent ruthenium oxyhydroxide Sr3Ru2O9H2
prepared through a low-temperature hydrothermal method. Single crystals and
powder samples of this phase are isolated by optimising the Sr(OH)2 to KRuO4
ratio while maintaining a high base concentration. The new structure consists
of a rare five-coordinated RuVI featuring isolated trigonal prisms and
crystallising in a non-centrosymmetric tetragonal system. Isolated Ru polyhedra
leading to a large spatial distance ~ 50 pm between the Ru metal centres render
the compound paramagnetic despite strong antiferromagnetic correlation. Band
structure calculation suggests a metal-like electronic ground state with mostly
Ru d and O p orbitals contributing to the Fermi surface. The electrochemical
performance of Sr3Ru2O9H2, though not as impressive as RuO2, remains relevant
and is on par with other reported OER catalysts.

Experiments have shown that strong coupling between molecular excitations and
a mode of a Fabry--P\'erot cavity can significantly alter molecular properties,
such as reaction rates and equilibrium constants. However, in spite of the
large body of theoretical work, the mechanism behind this change is still not
well understood. In order to make progress, we first take a step back and
question the appropriateness of the Hamiltonian that most recent studies are
based on. In particular, we investigate the dipole self-energy cross terms,
which have received attention as they seem to mediate distance-independent
interactions between all molecules in the cavity. However, it is often
overlooked that these terms are known to cancel exactly with the intermolecular
Coulombic interactions -- which on the other hand are usually neglected. In
this work, we revisit how this cancellation comes about in free space and in a
perfect cavity, and we discuss how the situation changes for a more realistic
cavity in the framework of macroscopic QED. Finally, we discuss the
implications of this cancellation for the single-mode Hamiltonian.

### Förster transfer between quantum dots in a shared phonon environment: An exact approach, revealing the role of pure dephasing

F\"orster resonance energy transfer has an important role in nature and
technology, rendering its exact theoretical understanding significant. To this
end, a system of two electronically decoupled quantum dots (QDs) is considered,
interacting via dipole-dipole interaction and a common phonon bath. While the
former leads to an oscillatory excitation transfer between the dots, the latter
provide the dissipation resulting in directional F\"orster transfer. We present
an exact microscopic treatment of the phonon-assisted transitions between
hybridized exciton levels of the coupled QD system, going beyond the simple
perturbative approaches commonly used in the literature. From our
asymptotically exact results we extract population decay times $T_1$, dephasing
times $T_2$, and resulting pure dephasing times $T_2^*$ of the states. We
compare this treatment with an analytical model based on Fermi's golden rule,
combining the most accurate elements of existing analytical treatments. The
exact results show a significant deviation from this model in some parameter
regimes, mainly due to the role of multi-phonon processes, which become
important for comparable electron-phonon and dipolar coupling, realised at
short distances between the QDs and at elevated temperatures.

We present a method based on acoustic wavenumber imaging algorithms to
quantify the spectral content of strongly nonlinear energy scattering of a
propagating wavefront across the discrete-continuum interface of a 2D hybrid
system composed of an ordered granular layer in contact with a thin elastic
plate. We consider snapshots of the transmitted wavefront at given time
instants, which are filtered across the wavenumber domain by applying the
spatial Fourier Transform (FT), and then the filtered wavefields are
transformed back to the spatial domain by inverse spatial FT. This yields a
spectral decomposition of the given snapshots at varying center wavenumbers.
Based on this postprocessing method, the scattering of the kinetic energy in
the receiving medium (plate) can be studied in the wavenumber-time domain,
proving a quantitative measure of the nonlinear scattering of the transmitted
wavefront by the strongly nonlinear 2D granular layer. This postprocessing
method enables the detailed quantitative study of the scattering and spectral
energy redistribution of propagating wavepackets in elastic media with embedded
linear or nonlinear layers or inclusions. In addition, we show that the
spectral evolution of receiving plate with a granular interface exhibits
diffusion-like behavior in the wavenumber domain, drawing an analogy between
parabolic heat diffusion and classical hyperbolic elsatodynamic energy
transport.

Fluorite ferroelectrics are exciting candidates for next-generation
non-volatile memory devices because their unique ferroelectric mechanism, which
arises from unconventional oxygen displacements, permits ferroelectricity with
minimal thickness constraints. However, the polarisation switching mechanism
remains the subject of intense debate due to a limited understanding of the
atomic-scale dynamics which are extremely challenging to detect and measure.
Here, we observe directly the polarisation switching pathways by visualising
oxygen site dynamics in ZrO2 and Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 freestanding membranes using an
advanced atomic-column imaging technique-optimum bright-field scanning
transmission electron microscopy. We observe that the 180- and 90-degree
polarisation pathways involve different nonpolar intermediate states with
distinct spatial scales. Coupled with density functional theory, we also reveal
how different cation species in fluorite oxides impact the accessible
polarisation switching pathways. Our atomic-level insights into the
polarisation switching dynamics open new avenues for the advanced engineering
of fluorite ferroelectric materials and resulting memory devices.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种选择性可扩展的多步微扰方法，用于高效计算分子系统的低能谱，结合了Rayleigh-Schrodinger和Brillouin-Wigner微扰理论的优点

In this work, we introduce a selective and scalable extension of the
multi-step Rayleigh-Schrodinger and Brillouin-Wigner perturbative scheme (see
arXiv:2408.16505), designed to efficiently access the low-energy spectrum of
molecular systems. The method proceeds by combining successive effective
Hamiltonian diagonalizations inspired by second-order Rayleigh-Schrodinger
perturbation theory, with a Brillouin-Wigner correction applied to individually
optimized states using an updated partitioning of the Hamiltonian. At each
step, a zeroth-order state is identified and progressively decoupled from the
remaining higher-lying states, thereby enabling a well-conditioned
Brillouin-Wigner expansion for the energy correction. In contrast to previous
approaches, the method selectively targets a small number of low-lying states,
significantly reducing the numerical overhead while maintaining spectroscopic
accuracy. The robustness of the method is demonstrated on the LiH and H4
molecules, where accurate excitation energies are obtained for the lowest
singlet states using compact model spaces, confirming its potential for
realistic applications.

A colloidal particle confined in a time-dependent optical trap can function
as a microscopic heat engine, with optimization strategies playing a crucial
role in enhancing its performance. In this study, we numerically investigate a
Stirling heat engine operating in both passive and active environments using a
protocol inspired by the Engineered Swift Equilibration (ESE) method. This
approach differs from the standard process and focuses on enhancing engine
efficiency, particularly at short time scales. We analyze various fluctuating
parameters throughout the cycle to validate the robustness of the engine, and
demonstrate a significant enhancement in performance compared to conventional
Stirling engines. Most crucially, we observe that the nonlinear protocol can
even transform a heat-pump-like operation into a genuine heat engine under
strong activity, thereby surpassing bounds imposed on efficiency by
high-temperature and quasi-static conditions. Finally, the proposed protocol is
designed with experimental feasibility in mind, making it a promising framework
for the practical realization of efficient microscopic heat engines.

The high-temperature phase of Ta$_\mathrm{2}$NiSe$_\mathrm{5}$, a
near-zero-gap semiconductor ($E_G$ = 0), is a promising candidate for an
excitonic insulator. Given the dome-like evolution expected for an excitonic
insulator around $E_G$, we investigated Ta$_\mathrm{2}$NiSe$_\mathrm{5}$, the
more semi-metallic Ta$_\mathrm{2}$(Ni,Co)Se$_\mathrm{5}$, and semiconducting
Ta$_\mathrm{2}$NiS$_\mathrm{5}$ using high-resolution single-crystal x-ray
diffraction and near-edge x-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS). Our
findings reveal a second-order structural phase transition from orthorhombic
(space group: $Cmcm$) to monoclinic (space group: $C2/c$) in
Ta$_\mathrm{2}$NiSe$_\mathrm{5}$ and Ta$_\mathrm{2}$(Ni,Co)Se$_\mathrm{5}$, but
no transition in Ta$_\mathrm{2}$NiS$_\mathrm{5}$ down to 2 K. This transition
breaks two mirror symmetries, enabling and enhancing the hybridization of Ta,
Ni, and Se atoms, shortening bond lengths, and strengthening orbital
interactions. NEXAFS data confirm stronger hybridization, significant changes
in excitonic binding energies, and a key alteration in orbital character,
suggesting an excitonic insulating state in Ta$_\mathrm{2}$NiSe$_\mathrm{5}$
and emphasizing the crucial electronic role of orbitals in the formation of the
excitonic insulator state.

resistance. This design enables a state-of-the-art combination of maximum drain
current (487 mA/mm) and breakdown field, along with a high cutoff frequency of

Complete catalytic oxidation of methane is an effective strategy for
greenhouse gas mitigation and clean energy conversion; yet, ensuring both high
catalytic activity and stability with palladium-based catalysts remains a
challenge. In the present work, we employed a theoretical investigation of
methane oxidation over single-atom Pd supported on SSZ-13 zeolite using density
functional theory calculations, combined with climbing-image nudged elastic
band calculations to determine activation barriers. A systematic assessment of
various Al distributions and Pd placements was carried out to identify the most
stable configurations for Pd incorporation within the zeolite
framework.Further, two mechanistic routes for methane activation were
evaluated: (i) direct dehydrogenation under dry conditions, and (ii)
O$_2$-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation. Our results demonstrate that the
direct (dry) pathway is energetically demanding and overall endothermic,
whereas the O$_2$ assisted route facilitates the exothermic energy profile,
particularly in the C-H bond cleavage. The formation of stable hydroxyl and
CO/CO$_2$ intermediates were also studied. The results emphasize the role of
oxygen-rich environments in enabling the complete methane oxidation with
improved thermodynamic feasibility. Moreover, we propose an alternate
low-energy pathway based on O-assisted and multi-site mechanisms that reduce
the overall reaction enthalpy. These insights provide the design principles for
highly active and moisture-resistant Pd-zeolite catalysts for sustainable
methane utilization.

We theoretically demonstrate that sufficiently strong magnetoelastic coupling
can change the ground state of otherwise uniform spin systems to chiral spin
configurations. More specifically, we show that, a periodic array of chiral
spin textures can spontaneously emerge in a two-dimensional ferromagnetic
system on a substrate-even in the absence of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction.
The resulting spin texture resembles a skyrmion-antiskyrmion lattice,
characterized by alternating scalar spin chirality and a nonuniform but
sign-preserving out-of-plane spin profile. Our analysis reveals that such
patterns form naturally when the magnetoelastic interaction is sufficiently
strong, while the coupling between flexural phonons and the substrate is
sufficiently weak. These findings uncover a previously unexplored mechanism for
chiral spin texture formation driven purely by magnetoelastic coupling,
signaling at potential utilities of materials with strong magnetoelastic
responses.

phase behavior and properties of $\mathrm{Li_3Nb_xTa_{1-x}O_4}$ remain largely
unexplored. In this work, we employ a multiscale approach that encompasses
first-principles phonon calculations, cluster expansion, and Monte Carlo
simulations to derive the temperature-composition phase diagram for
$\mathrm{Li_3Nb_xTa_{1-x}O_4}$. Our findings reveal the critical role of
vibrational entropy in accurately predicting phase stability, which promotes
the solubility of Nb in $\mathrm{Li_3TaO_4}$ while suppressing the miscibility
of Ta in $\mathrm{Li_3NbO_4}$. Additionally, we demonstrate that Nb/Ta mixing
offers a promising avenue for tailoring the Li-ion conductivities of
$\mathrm{Li_3Nb_xTa_{1-x}O_4}$. On the technical side, we demonstrated the
importance of including vibrational entropy effects explicitly in Monte Carlo
simulations dealing with multicomponent systems, beyond simple binary mixtures.
On the application side, this study provides fundamental insights into the
phase behavior and Li-ion transport properties of
$\mathrm{Li_3Nb_xTa_{1-x}O_4}$, paving the way for its potential applications
in energy storage and other fields.

A single massive Dirac surface band is predicted to exhibit a half-quantized
Hall conductance, a hallmark of the C = 1/2 parity anomaly state in quantum
field theory. Experimental signatures of the C = 1/2 parity anomaly state have
been observed in semi-magnetic topological insulator (TI) bilayers, yet whether
it supports a half-quantized chiral edge current remains elusive. Here, we
observe a robust half-quantized Hall conductance plateau in a molecular beam
epitaxy (MBE)-grown asymmetric magnetic TI trilayer under specific in-plane
magnetic field regimes, corresponding to the C = 1/2 parity anomaly state.
Within this state, both nonlocal and nonreciprocal transport signals are
greatly enhanced, which we identify as direct evidence for a half-quantized
chiral edge current localized at the boundary of the top gapped surface. Our
numerical simulations demonstrate that this half-quantized chiral edge channel
is the essential carrier of the observed half-quantized Hall conductance
plateau, analogous to the quantized chiral edge channel in the C = 1 quantum
anomalous Hall state. Our results provide experimental evidence for the
half-quantized chiral edge transport in a C = 1/2 parity anomaly state. This
work establishes asymmetric magnetic TI trilayers as a platform for probing
single Dirac fermion physics and paves the way to explore a series of exciting
phenomena in the C = 1/2 parity anomaly state, including the topological
magnetoelectric effect and quantized magneto-optical response.

A theory of dynamic polarization of the nuclear spin system via
optically-oriented charge carriers in lead halide perovskites is developed and
compared with the experiments performed on a
FA$_{0.9}$Cs$_{0.1}$PbI$_{2.8}$Br$_{0.2}$ crystal. The spin Hamiltonians of the
electron and hole hyperfine interaction with the nuclear spins of lead and
halogen are derived. The hyperfine interaction of the halogen spins with charge
carriers is shown to be anisotropic and depending on the position of the
halogen nucleus in the cubic elementary cell. The quadrupole splitting is
absent for the lead spins, but plays an important role for the halogen spins
and affects their dynamic polarization by charge carriers. The Overhauser
fields of the dynamically polarized nuclei are calculated as functions of the
tilting angle of an external magnetic field and compared with the
experimentally measured angular dependence of the Hanle effect. The comparison
of the theoretical model with the experimental data reveals an enhanced spin
polarization of the lead nuclei, whose mean spin exceeds several times the mean
spins of localized electrons and holes. This unexpectedly strong spin
polarization is explained by the interaction of the lead nuclei with excitons
having a high degree of spin orientation due to their short lifetime after
excitation by circularly-polarized light. The dynamic polarization of the
quadrupole-split halogen spins manifests itself via the magnetic field they
produce at the lead nuclei. This field maintains the magnetization of the lead
nuclei at zero external magnetic field. The dynamics of the nuclear spin
polarization is measured under optical pumping and in the dark, yielding a
nuclear spin-lattice relaxation time on the order of 10 seconds.

Nanoporous materials hold promise for diverse sustainable applications, yet
their vast chemical space poses challenges for efficient design. Machine
learning offers a compelling pathway to accelerate the exploration, but
existing models lack either interpretability or fidelity for elucidating the
correlation between crystal geometry and property. Here, we report a
three-dimensional periodic space sampling method that decomposes large
nanoporous structures into local geometrical sites for combined property
prediction and site-wise contribution quantification. Trained with a
constructed database and retrieved datasets, our model achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy and data efficiency for property prediction on gas
storage, separation, and electrical conduction. Meanwhile, this approach
enables the interpretation of the prediction and allows for accurate
identification of significant local sites for targeted properties. Through
identifying transferable high-performance sites across diverse nanoporous
frameworks, our model paves the way for interpretable, symmetry-aware
nanoporous materials design, which is extensible to other materials, like
molecular crystals and beyond.

We present a theoretical study of terahertz radiation-induced transitions
between attractive and repulsive Fermi polaron states in monolayers of
transition metal dichalcogenides. Going beyond the simple few-particle trion
picture, we develop a many-body description that explicitly accounts for
correlations with the Fermi sea of resident charge carriers. We calculate the
rate of the direct optical conversion process, showing that it features a
characteristic frequency dependence near the threshold due to final-state
electron-exciton scattering related to the trion correlation with the Fermi sea
hole. Furthermore, we demonstrate that intense terahertz pulses can
significantly heat the electron gas via Drude absorption enabling an
additional, indirect conversion mechanism through collisions between hot
electrons and polarons, which exhibits a strong exponential dependence on
temperature. Our results reveal the important role of many-body correlations
and thermal effects in the terahertz-driven dynamics of excitonic complexes in
two-dimensional semiconductors.

Recent advances in scaling up spin-based quantum processors have revealed
unanticipated issues related to thermal effects. Microwave pulses required to
manipulate and read the qubits are found to overheat the spins environment,
which unexpectedly induces Larmor frequency shifts, reducing thereby gate
fidelities. In this study, we shine light on these elusive thermal effects, by
experimentally characterizing the temperature dependence of the Larmor
frequency for a single hole spin in silicon. Our results unambiguously reveal
an electrical origin underlying the thermal susceptibility, stemming from the
spin-orbit-induced electric susceptibility. We perform an accurate modeling of
the spin electrostatic environment and gyromagnetic properties, allowing us to
pinpoint electric dipoles as responsible for these frequency shifts, that
unfreeze as the temperature increases. Surprisingly, we find that the thermal
susceptibility can be tuned with the magnetic field angle and can even cancel
out, unveiling a sweet spot where the hole spin is rendered immune to thermal
effects. These findings bear important implications for optimizing spin-based
quantum processors fidelity.

### Phonon polariton Hall effect

The phonon Hall effect conventionally describes the generation of a
transverse heat current in an applied magnetic field. In this work, we extend
the effect to hybrid light-matter excitations and demonstrate theoretically
that phonon polaritons, formed by coupling optical phonons with terahertz
radiation, support transverse energy flow when coherently driven in an applied
magnetic field. Using the example of PbTe, which exhibits strongly coupled
phonon polaritons, we show that the magnetic field splits the phonon-polariton
branches into left and right-handed circular polarization, obtaining unequal
group velocities. We derive the energy current operators for propagating phonon
polaritons and show how their mixed phononic-photonic nature enables
controllable transverse phonon-polariton transport in the terahertz regime. Our
results demonstrate bending of light through a phonon polariton Hall effect,
which provides a route towards terahertz polaritonic devices.

### Nonreciprocal plasmons in one-dimensional carbon nanostructures

The directional control of light in miniaturized plasmonic waveguides holds
appealing possibilities for emerging nanophotonic technologies, but is hindered
by the intrinsic reciprocal optical response of conventional plasmonic
materials. While the ability of graphene to sustain large electrical currents
shows promise for nonreciprocal plasmonics, studies have been limited to
extended samples characterized by linear electrical dispersion. Here, we
theoretically explore quantum finite-size and nonlocal effects in the
nonreciprocal response of mesoscale plasmonic waveguides comprised of
drift-biased graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Using
atomistic simulation methods based on tight-binding electronic states and
self-consistent mean-field optical response, we reveal that a moderate
electrical bias can significantly break reciprocity for propagation of guided
plasmon modes in GNRs and CNTs exhibiting electronic band gaps. The excitation
by a nearby point dipole emitter and subsequent propagation of guided plasmon
modes can thus be actively controlled by the applied current, which can further
be leveraged to mediate nonlocal interactions of multiple emitters. Our results
establish graphene nanostructures as a promising atomically thin platform for
nonreciprocal nanophotonics.

We present a systematic study of bound relations between different electronic
properties of magnetic crystals: electron density, effective mass, orbital
magnetization, localization length, Chern invariant, and electric
susceptibility. All relations are satisfied for a group of low-lying bands,
while some remain valid for upper bands. New results include a lower bound on
the electric susceptibility of Chern insulators, and an upper bound on the
sum-rule part of the orbital magnetization. In addition, bounds involving the
Chern invariant are generalized from two dimensions (Chern number) to three
(Chern vector). Bound relations are established for metals as well as
insulators, and are illustrated for model systems. The manner in which they
approach saturation in a model Chern insulator with tunable flat bands is
analyzed in terms of the optical absorption spectrum.

We provide a theory of spin and acoustic wave coupled nonlinear dynamics in
continuum systems. Combining the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equations with the
magnetoelastic Hamiltonian, we derive classical equations of motion for the
magnetization and acoustic wave amplitudes, that include magnonic nonlinearity
-- both three- and four-magnon processes -- as well as linear and nonlinear
magnetoelastic interactions. We focus on two-dimensional magnetic films
sustaining surface acoustic waves, a geometry where our model successfully
reproduces our recent experimental observation of phonon-to-magnon
down-conversion under acoustic drive. We provide analytical expressions for all
the rates in our equations, which make them particularly suitable for
quantization. We then quantize our model, deriving Heisenberg-Langevin
equations of motion for magnon and phonon operators, and show how to compute
quantum expectation values in the mean field approximation. Our work paves the
way toward acoustic control of magnons in the quantum regime.
