- **TL;DR**: 本文在双层石墨烯中首次实验证明了可压缩电子流，通过电子de Laval喷嘴使载流子加速超过电子声速并产生激波，突破了传统不可压缩电子流体研究的局限。

In very clean solid-state systems, where carrier-carrier interactions
dominate over any other scattering mechanisms, the flow of electrons can be
described within a hydrodynamic framework. In these cases, analogues of viscous
fluid phenomena have been experimentally observed. However, experimental
studies of electron hydrodynamics have so far been limited to the low velocity,
linear response regime. At velocities approaching the speed of sound, the
electronic fluid is expected to exhibit compressible behaviour where nonlinear
effects and discontinuities such as shocks and choked flow have long been
predicted. This compressible regime remains unexplored in electronic systems,
despite its promise of strongly nonlinear flow phenomena. Here, we demonstrate
compressible electron flow in bilayer graphene through an electronic de Laval
nozzle, a structure that accelerates charge carriers past the electronic speed
of sound, until they slow down suddenly in a shock. Discontinuities in
transport measurements and local flattening of potential in Kelvin probe
measurements are consistent with a viscous electron shock front and the
presence of supersonic electron flow, and are not consistent with Ohmic or
ballistic flow. Breaking the sound barrier in electron liquids opens the door
for novel, intrinsically nonlinear electronic devices beyond the paradigm of
incompressible flow.

- **TL;DR**: 本研究通过第一性原理模拟量化PtSe2/MoSe2/LiNbO3界面处的Rashba效应，扩展了传统自旋输运理论，并分析了LiNbO3极化方向对太赫兹发射的控制程度。

Recent studies using Terahertz Time-Domain Spectroscopy (THz-TDS) with
spintronic emitters as a source have revealed distinct signatures of the Rashba
effect. This effect, which arises from the breaking of inversion symmetry in
low-dimensional materials, has been recently investigated in
CoFeB/PtSe$_2$/MoSe$_2$/LiNbO$_3$-based heterostructures [S. Massabeau et al.,
APL Mater. 13, 041102, 2025 ]. The observed phenomena are at the source of the
generated THz far-field emission, typically through mechanisms such as
spin-to-charge conversion triggered by the absorption of ultrafast optical
pulses. In this work, we employ first-principles simulations to quantify the
Rashba effect at PtSe$_2$/MoSe$_2$/LiNbO$_3$ interfaces, expanding the
traditional understanding of spin transport by incorporating the orbital degree
of freedom. Moreover, we quantify the degree of control on the THz emission
depending on the polarization direction of LiNbO$_3$. In order to achieve this,
we analyze the accumulation of both spin and orbital components using linear
response theory, revealing distinct behaviors. These findings are crucial for a
deeper understanding of the physical processes governing angular
momentum-to-charge conversion and THz emission. Moreover, they may provide
broader insights into various experimental outcomes, including those related to
spin-orbit torque.

### Gate-tunable chiral spin mode in WSe2/WS2 moiré superlattices

- **TL;DR**: 本文报道了在近零度扭曲WSe2/WS2双层中发现的栅极可调手性自旋模式，该模式通过拉曼光谱中的伪矢量对称通道表现为尖锐共振，并随填充变化从手性自旋激子转变为激子极化子。

The interplay between many-body and spin-orbit effects (SOC) can lead to
novel phenomena in solids. Chiral spin modes (CSM) are collective spin
excitations that arise from such interplay and connect states with opposite
chirality, which, however, have been rarely observed. Here, we report a
gate-tunable CSM that occurs between conduction SOC-split minibands in
near-0{\deg}-twisted WSe2/WS2 bilayers. This mode manifests as a sharp
resonance with giant Raman efficiency in the pseudovector-symmetry channel of
the Raman spectra. By varying fillings, the CSM transitions from chiral spin
exciton to excitonic polaron. The spin-flip nature is directly confirmed by the
Zeeman effect. Moreover, the filling dependence compellingly evidences a
charge-transfer insulator at filling of one. Our results demonstrate
transition-metal-dichalcogenides moir\'e superlattices as a fertile platform
for exploring exotic low-lying collective excitations.

### Bulk-edge coulping induced by a moving impurity

More physics at the boundaries of a topological lattice remains to be
explored for future applications of topological edge states. This work
investigates the stability of topological edge states in the presence of a
moving impurity. By modeling the impurity as a moving Gaussian on-site
potential at the boundary of a two-dimensional (2D) lattice, we show that a
moving impurity may cause significant modifications to edge transport, a
feature markedly different from the expected robustness of edge transport
against a static impurity. We further identify an interesting mechanism to
explain the bulk-edge coupling using a co-moving frame, where the density of
the bulk states and the degeneracy between the edge states and the bulk become
key elements. The physical insights developed in this work are validated across
multiple systems, including Chern insulators, quantum spin Hall insulators, and
Floquet Chern insulators. Results presented in this work are complementary to
our current understanding of the robustness of topological edge transport.

### Estimating Energy Release in Metallized Composite Explosives Using the Taylor Model

- **TL;DR**: 本文开发了一个改进的泰勒管状炸弹模型，用于研究金属燃料（特别是铝）在复合炸药中的后燃烧效应，通过微分方程形式添加能量源项，模拟金属燃料在微秒时间尺度上的快速反应。

The potential for reactive metal fuels to enhance the energetic output of
high explosives has generated an enduring interest in the study of composite
explosives. It has typically been demonstrated that added metal fuels can have
little or even deleterious impact on the accelerating ability of composite
military explosives relative to baseline performance. Often this has led to the
assumption of limited reaction of the metal fuel over microsecond timescales.
The widespread availability of Photonic Doppler Velocimetry has enabled time
resolved measurement of accelerated confinement, ultimately demonstrating
prompt reaction of metal fuels. Motivated by this observation, hydrocode
modelling studies, and prior author's modifications of Taylor's tubular bomb
model, we developed a differential equation form of Taylor's model in a manner
where it is straightforward to add sources or phases. An afterburning version
of the JWL equation of state was used to add energy to the gaseous products at
a linear, time-dependent rate. The metal particles are assumed to remain in
velocity equilibrium with the gaseous products and do not transfer heat or
influence chemical composition. We focus exclusively on added aluminum as it
remains the most ubiquitous choice of metal fuel. The model is initialized with
a CJ state calculated from Cheetah 2.0 assuming the Al particles are inert in
the detonation. JWL coefficients for the baseline explosive are also used.
Qualitative agreement is observed between the model and previously published
experiments.

### The exact relation between the entanglement entropies of the $XY$ and quantum Ising chains with free and fixed boundary conditions

- **TL;DR**: 本文研究了XY链和量子伊辛链在固定边界条件下的纠缠熵，发现XY链的纠缠熵可以分解为量子伊辛链不同边界条件下纠缠熵的组合。

The entanglement entropies of $XY$ chains and quantum Ising chains (QICs)
with fixed boundary conditions are studied here. Three kinds of boundary
conditions (BCs) are considered: fixed up--up or down--down (the spins at both
ends are aligned in the same direction), fixed up--down or down--up (the spins
at the two ends are aligned in opposite directions), and fixed--free (the spin
at one end is aligned, and the other end is free). It is shown that i) the
entanglement entropy of an $XY$ chain with a fixed--free BC is the sum of those
of QICs with a fixed--free BC and with a free--free BC; ii) the entanglement
entropy of an $XY$ chain with a fixed up--up boundary condition is the sum of
those of QICs with a fixed up--up BC and with a free--free BC; and iii) the
entanglement entropy of an $XY$ chain with a fixed up--down BC is the sum of
that of a QIC with a fixed up--up BC and that of the first excited state of a
QIC with a free--free BC.

### Asymptotically exact solution of the non-Hermitian disordered interacting Hatano-Nelson chain

- **TL;DR**: 本文提出了无序相互作用费米子Hatano-Nelson模型（或非厄米自旋-1/2 XXZ模型）的渐近精确解，展示了非厄米耦合对量子-经典交叉的影响，以及基态性质和纠缠熵的新特征。

We present an asymptotically exact solution of a paradigmatic non-Hermitian
model: the disordered interacting fermionic Hatano-Nelson model, or
equivalently, the non-Hermitian spin-1/2 XXZ model. We use a renormalization
group method suited for disordered systems and show that non-Hermitian
couplings are relevant perturbations to the Hermitian model, which ultimately
leads to a quantum-to-classical crossover. The ground state of the model
consists of a collection of strongly coupled pairs of spins of arbitrary size
at random positions which, unlike the Hermitian case, do not form singlets, but
a mixture of the singlet and the $M=0$ triplet state. As a result, the magnetic
susceptibility in the $x,y$-directions becomes negative and diverges at a
finite small temperature. Additionally, in sharp contrast to the $\ln(L)$
increase observed in disordered Hermitian chains, the entanglement entropy of a
partition of size $L$ saturates for large $L$, as the strongly coupled pairs
become classical and stop contributing at large length scales.

### Facile Synthesis and On-Chip Color Tuning of CsPbBr$_{3}$@CsPbBr$_{3-x}$TFA$_{x}$ Nanoplatelets via Ion Engineering

Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have emerged as attractive optoelectronic
materials because of high fluorescence quantum yield, broad color tunability,
and excellent color purity. However, the ionic nature of MHPs makes them
susceptible to polar solvents, leading to defect-induced nonradiative
recombination and photoluminescence (PL) quenching. Here, we present a combined
in-synthesis ($\textit{in situ}$) and post-synthesis ion engineering to
suppress nonradiative recombination and integrate multicolor MHP arrays on-chip
through a perovskite-compatible photolithography process and $\textit{in situ}$
vapor-phase anion exchange. CsPbBr$_{3}$@CsPbBr$_{3-x}$TFA$_{x}$ nanoplatelets
were grown on-chip via a single-step solution process incorporating
trifluoroacetate (TFA$^{-}$) pseudohalides. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
revealed that TFA$^{-}$ passivate uncoordinated Pb$^{2+}$ ions on nanoplatelet
surface and suppresses the formation of metallic lead (Pb$^{0}$). This
decreases the non-radiative recombination centers and yields a PL peak at 520
nm with a linewidth of 14.56$\% \pm$ 0.5 nm. The nanoplatelets were patterned
via a top-down photolithography process and selectively masked with a
PMMA/Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$ stack to enable vapor-phase anion exchange. The PL peak
shifted in the unmasked regions from 520 nm to 413 nm, resulting in distinct
green and blue emission arrays. Our method enables the scalable fabrication of
highly luminescent, two-color MHP arrays with tailored optical properties,
advancing their integration into next-generation optoelectronic devices.

### Topology optimization of cathode gas channel layout in advanced proton exchange membrane fuel cells

- **Title (EN)**: Topology optimization of cathode gas channel layout in advanced proton exchange membrane fuel cells
- **Authors**: Zahra Kazemi, Kamran Behdinan
- **Categories**: physics.comp-ph
- **TL;DR**: 本研究提出使用拓扑优化方法重新设计PEMFC阴极气体通道布局，无需先验假设，旨在最大化反应物浓度并最小化流动路径上的功率耗散。优化后的拓扑结构相比传统蛇形布局在0.15 m/s入口速度下压降降低46.7%，平均电流密度提高20.9%。

The proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) output relies on the transport
behavior within the cathode gas channels. Current designs remain inadequate as
they often rely on heuristic modifications of existing layouts or designer
intuition with suboptimal performance. In this study, topology optimization is
proposed to redesign the PEMFC cathode gas channel layout without a priori
assumptions. The optimization aims to maximize the reactant concentration and
minimize power dissipation along the flow path. The problem is solved within a
three-dimensional half-cell model. For computational tractability, a
reduced-order, depth-averaged two-dimensional model is also implemented. The
optimized topology yields an enhanced current density with lower energy
dissipation over the conventional benchmarks. At an inlet velocity of 0.15 m/s,
the pressure drop is reduced by 46.7% compared to the serpentine layout, though
is 28.2% higher than that of the parallel case. Within the optimized channels,
oxygen flows at higher local velocities, which allows a more homogeneous
reactant delivery across the domain. Relative to the serpentine layout, the
improvement in mean current density reaches 20.9% with 4.9% lower standard
deviation. Placing more emphasis on dissipation minimization during
optimization produces more intricate, tortuous channel topologies. Such design
flexibility enables the discovery of unconventional yet efficient layouts.

### Berry Trashcan With Short Range Attraction:Exact $p_x+i p_y$ Superconductivity in Rhombohedral Graphene

- **TL;DR**: 本文展示了在Berry Trashcan模型中存在解析的$p_x + i p_y$超导基态，该模型是研究无莫尔极限下超导性的构建模块。研究发现基态手性与模型的均匀Berry曲率存在铁磁耦合，并通过解析和数值方法验证了结合能、激发谱和ODLRO。模型具有受限谱生成代数结构，是GMP类代数中最优且唯一现实的手性超导体宿主。

We show the presence of analytic $p_x + i p_y$ superconducting ground states
in the Berry Trashcan -- a minimal model of rhombohedral graphene valid for $n
\ge 4$ layers -- under short-range attractive interactions. We demonstrate that
the model, whose dispersion consists of a flat bottom surrounded by steep walls
of prohibitive kinetic energy, serves as a building block to understand
superconductivity in the moir\'e-free limit. We find that the ground-state
chirality has a ``ferromagnetic'' coupling to that of the uniform Berry
curvature of the model, and compare the analytically obtained binding energies,
excitation spectra and off-diagonal long-range order (ODLRO) with numerical
exact diagonalization results. We show that the analytic structure of this
model is that of a restricted spectrum generating algebra (RSGA), initially
developed for quantum scars, and build a variety of other exact (but contrived)
models with exact chiral superconductivity based on a method developed in
Ref.[1]. However, under short range attraction, we show that the Berry Trashcan
is the optimal and only realistic point in the class of GMP-like algebras to
host a chiral superconductor state. A toy model in 1D and its related physics
is also investigated. Our results reveal that chiral superconductivity is
natural under attractive interactions in the Berry trashcan model of
rhombohedral graphene in displacement field, although we make no claim about
the origin of the attraction.

### The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model on a one-dimensional lattice: Analytical wave functions of topological edge states

The one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model is a prototype model in
the field of topological condensed matter physics, and the existence and
characteristics of its topological edge states are crucial for revealing the
topological essence of low-dimensional systems. This paper focuses on the
analytical wave functions of topological edge states in the SSH model,
systematically sorting out the fundamentals of model construction. Based on the
tight-binding approximation, it derives the matrix form of the SSH model
Hamiltonian and the band structureand clarifies the role of chiral symmetry in
the classification of topological phases. By solving the Schrodinger equation
of the finite-length lattice, the mathematical expression of the analytical
wave function of topological edge states is fully derived, verifying its
localized feature of exponential decay. Moreover, it quantitatively analyzes
the influence laws of lattice parameters (hopping integrals, lattice
constants), electron-electron interactions, and external field perturbations on
the wave function amplitude, decay coefficient, and energy. Furthermore, it
establishes the quantitative correlation between the analytical wave function
and electronic transport (conductivity) as well as optical properties (light
absorption coefficient), and discusses its application prospects in the design
of topological qubits and the development of new topological materials. The
research results provide theoretical support for an in-depth understanding of
the physical essence of low-dimensional topological states and lay a foundation
for the performance optimization of topology-related devices.

### Motional representation; the ability to predict odor characters using molecular vibrations

- **TL;DR**: 基于分子振动参数和振动光谱的CNN与逻辑回归方法可以预测气味特征，其预测能力与基于分子指纹的逻辑回归方法相当，表明气味不仅可由分子形状预测，也可由分子振动预测。

The prediction of odor characters is still impossible based on the odorant
molecular structure. We designed a CNN-based regressor for computed parameters
in molecular vibrations (CNN\_vib), in order to investigate the ability to
predict odor characters of molecular vibrations. In this study, we explored
following three approaches for the predictability; (i) CNN with molecular
vibrational parameters, (ii) logistic regression based on vibrational spectra,
and (iii) logistic regression with molecular fingerprint(FP). Our investigation
demonstrates that both (i) and (ii) provide predictablity, and also that the
vibrations as an explanatory variable (i and ii) and logistic regression with
fingerprints (iii) show nearly identical tendencies. The predictabilities of
(i) and (ii), depending on odor descriptors, are comparable to those of (iii).
Our research shows that odor is predictable by odorant molecular vibration as
well as their shapes alone. Our findings provide insight into the
representation of molecular motional features beyond molecular structures.

### Emergent Ising symmetry and supercritical fluids

- **TL;DR**: 本文通过分析范德瓦尔斯类流体的热力学交叉行为，揭示了在标度区中除了普遍标度律外还涌现出Z_2对称性，并证明在适当条件下伊辛对称性普遍存在于标度区，这解决了伊辛模型提出的对称性难题。

The symmetry of Ising model questions any single crossover scenario for
supercritical fluids. In this work, we firstly study a pair of thermodynamic
crossovers $L^\pm$ analytically for the Van der Waals class fluids. We uncover
an emergent $Z_2$ symmetry in addition to the universal scalings in the scaling
regime for this class fluids. By using the self-reciprocal property between
coexistenct phases, we further establish that under suitable conditions, the
Ising symmetry generally emerges in the scaling regime for a general
universality class. As a consequence, the thermodynamic crossovers $L^\pm$
generally exhibit an emergent $Z_2$ symmetry in the scaling regime. This partly
resolves the symmetry puzzle raised by the Ising model. The results also imply
that the physical importance of the Ising model in critical phenomenon is far
beyond the scope of magentic transitions.

### Fractional topological insulators at odd-integer filling: Phase diagram of two-valley quantum Hall model

- **TL;DR**: 该论文研究了在无外加磁场条件下，MoTe2扭曲双层结构中出现的分数陈绝缘体，重点关注了自旋未极化或部分极化情况下可能实现的时间反演对称拓扑序。

The fractional quantum Hall effect has recently been shown to exist in
heterostructures of van der Waals materials without an externally applied
magnetic field, e.g. in twisted bilayers of MoTe$_2$. These fractional Chern
insulators break time-reversal symmetry spontaneously through polarization of
the electron spins in a quantum spin Hall insulator band structure with flat
bands. This prompts the question, which states could be realized if the spins
remain unpolarized or polarize partially. Specifically, the possibility of
time-reversal symmetric topological order arises. Here, we study this problem
for odd integer filling of the bands, specifically focusing on vanishing and
half valley polarization. Short of reliable microscopic models for small twist
angles around $2.1^\circ$, we study the idealized situation of two Landau
levels with opposite chirality, the two-valley quantum Hall model. Using exact
diagonalization, we identify different phases arising in this model by tuning
the interaction. In the physically relevant regime, the system initially
exhibits phase-separated or valley-polarized states, which eventually
transition into paired states by reducing onsite Coulomb repulsion.

- **TL;DR**: 研究发现超薄RuO₂异质结构中存在非常规自旋结构，由镜像偶和镜像奇动量依赖分量共存组成，这表明在超薄极限下通过外延应变产生了新兴的非相对论性自旋结构。

Recently, rutile RuO$_2$ has attracted renewed interest due to expectations
of prominent altermagnetic spin-splitting. However, accumulating experimental
evidence suggests that in its bulk and thick-film forms, RuO$_2$ does not
display any form of magnetic ordering. Despite this, the spin structure of
RuO$_2$ remains largely unexplored in the ultra-thin limit, where
substrate-imposed epitaxial strain can be substantial. Here, we employ
spin-resolved angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, supported by ab-initio
calculations, to reveal the electronic structure of 2.7~nm-thick epitaxial
RuO$_2$ heterostructures. We observe an unconventional spin texture
characterized by the coexistence of mirror-even and mirror-odd
momentum-dependent components. A comprehensive symmetry analysis rules out
nonmagnetic origins of this spin texture. These findings suggest an emergent
non-relativistic spin structure enabled by epitaxial strain in the ultra-thin
limit, marking a distinct departure from the behavior of relaxed or bulk
RuO$_2$. Our work opens new perspectives for exploring symmetry-breaking
mechanisms and spin textures in oxide heterostructures.

a black box. Such solutions can be used for verification tests of hydrodynamics
codes. We present the underlying theory, the method for finding solutions, and
several examples of derived semi-analytic solutions. We end by performing a
classic convergence test using a non-trivial semi-analytic solution.

In this review, we summarize the theoretical foundations underlying a variety
of phenomena in superconductor-ferromagnet (SF) hybrid structures, with a focus
on recent advances in several key areas. These include: (i) the fundamental
understanding of proximity effects in SF-based systems; (ii) spin-valve effects
in SF and SFS Josephson junctions; and (iii) the design and realization of
superconducting memory elements, particularly in SIsF-type Josephson junctions.
We also discuss the experimental progress in fabricating and characterizing
spin-valve structures. Our discussion is restricted to junctions incorporating
weak, homogeneous metallic ferromagnets with collinear magnetization
directions, where the essential physical mechanisms can be analyzed within a
relatively tractable theoretical framework.

- **TL;DR**: ΔT噪声可作为区分手性边缘模式与拓扑螺旋/平凡螺旋边缘输运的灵敏探针，无需外部偏压即可提供比传统电导测量更精确的拓扑信息。

In this article we demonstrate that $\Delta_T$ noise provides a sensitive,
practical probe for distinguishing chiral edge modes from topological helical
and trivial (non-topological) helical edge transport. Measured under
zero-current conditions, $\Delta_T$ noise reveals contrasts that conventional
conductance measurements typically miss. Crucially, $\Delta_T$ requires no
external energy input in the form of an applied voltage bias, yet encodes the
same intrinsic information that shot noise yields in the zero-temperature,
finite-bias limit, without the distorting effects of Joule heating. This
absence of bias-induced heating makes $\Delta_T$ noise both more precise and
more reliable than conventional shot-noise approaches. Moreover, the diagnostic
power of $\Delta_T$ noise persists at finite frequencies $\omega$ too. The
frequency-dependent signal $\Delta_{T}(\omega)$ exhibits distinctive spectral
signatures (including sign changes) that further enhance its utility as an
experimentally accessible fingerprint of edge-mode topology.

The dynamics of low-energy proton collisions with hydrocarbon with
hydrocarbon molecules are investigated using real-time time-dependent density
functional theory. Through systematic variation of proton kinetic energy and
impact site on the molecular surface, the resulting scattering, proton capture,
and bond dissociation pathways are analyzed. The simulations reveal a strong
dependence of reaction outcomes on both incident energy and collision geometry,
with the interplay between electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom
highlighted as governing molecular fragmentation and reaction mechanisms.

### Efficient simulation of a pair of dissipative qubits antiferromagnetically coupled

We investigate the efficiency of different quantum Monte Carlo simulations of
a pair of antiferromagnetically coupled qubits in an Ohmic dissipative
environment. Using a Trotter-Suzuky decomposition and integrating out the
degrees of freedom of the thermal bath, the model maps onto a frustrated
long-range double-chain Ising lattice. We prove that: i) due to frustration,
the conventional Swendsen-Wang approach to cluster dynamics turns out to suffer
from a severe inefficiency, stemming from the mismatch between spin
correlations and cluster connectivity; ii) the Kandel-Domany approach is
extremely effective in the study of dissipative quantum qubits. We partition
the double-chain into different types of plaquettes and minimize the weight of
graphs containing antiferromagnetic bonds by using both analytic and numerical
approaches. Monte Carlo simulation results show that ``long range'' plaquette
decompositions are more efficient than the ``local'' ones, especially for high
levels of dissipation.

### Joint commensuration in moiré charge-order superlattices drives shear topological defects

- **TL;DR**: 该论文研究了EuTe$_4$中联合共格电荷密度波（JC-CDW）在光激发下的动力学行为，发现其波矢和相干长度在CDW方向上保持锁定，同时形成了剪切型拓扑缺陷，为光学莫尔工程和量子材料操控提供了新平台。

The advent of two-dimensional moir\'e systems has revolutionized the
exploration of phenomena arising from strong correlations and nontrivial band
topology. Recently, a moir\'e superstructure formed by two coexisting charge
density wave (CDW) orders with slightly mismatched wavevectors has been
realized. These incommensurate CDWs can collectively exhibit commensurability,
resulting in the jointly commensurate CDW (JC-CDW). This JC-CDW hosts phenomena
including electronic anisotropy and phase-modulated hysteresis, and holds
promise for non-volatile optoelectronic memory devices. Realizing such
functionality requires understanding how the spatial periodicity, coherence,
and amplitude of this order evolve under perturbations. Here, we address these
questions using time- and momentum-resolved techniques to probe light-induced
dynamics in EuTe$_4$. Our time-resolved diffraction results show that under
intense photoexcitation, the JC-CDW wavevector and coherence length remain
locked along the CDW direction, indicating preserved moir\'e periodicity while
the moir\'e potential depth is suppressed. This robustness governs the
configuration of the photoexcited JC-CDW and leads to the formation of
previously underexplored shear-type topological defects. Furthermore, we
developed an approach to simultaneously track the temporal evolution of the
amplitude and phase of a CDW by following two diffraction peaks corresponding
to one order, with findings verified by time-resolved photoemission and
electron diffraction. This methodology enables reconstruction of the momentum-
and time-resolved evolution of the JC-CDW and direct visualization of
shear-type topological defect formation. These findings not only highlight the
unique robustness of JC-CDWs out of equilibrium, but also establish a platform
for optical moir\'e engineering and manipulation of quantum materials through
topological defect control.

### From Coated to Uncoated: Scanning Electron Microscopy Corrections to Estimate True Surface Pore Size in Nanoporous Membranes

- **TL;DR**: 本研究通过分析SEM成像参数对膜表面孔隙测量的影响，发现传统高加速电压和金属涂层会显著低估膜孔隙率和孔径，提出低电压、薄涂层和数字校正方法来准确表征纳米多孔膜结构。

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is the premier method for characterizing
the nanoscale surface pores in ultrafiltration (UF) membranes and the support
layers of reverse osmosis (RO) membranes. Based on SEM, the conventional
understanding is that membranes typically have low surface porosities of &lt;10%.
We hypothesized that high acceleration voltage during SEM imaging and sputter
metal coatings required for SEM have led to systematic underestimations of
porosity and pore size. We showed that imaging a commercial UF membrane at 1,
5, and 10 kV reduced measured porosity from 10.3% (1 kV) to 6.3% (10 kV), while
increasing Pt coating thickness from 1.5 to 5 nm lowered porosity by 54% for
the UF membrane (12.9% to 5.8%) and 46% for an RO support (13.1% to 7.0%). To
account for coating thickness, we developed a digital correction method that
simulates pore dilation, enabling the pore structure to be estimated for
uncoated membranes. Dilation yielded uncoated porosity values of 23% for the UF
membrane and 20% for the RO support, about 3-fold greater than values observed
with a 4 nm coating. Mean pore diameters were 2-fold greater for the UF
membrane and 1.5-fold greater for the RO support. Critically, dilation-derived
pore-size distributions agreed with low-flux dextran-retention data fitted with
the Bungay-Brenner model. Our results suggest that surface porosities and pore
sizes of nanoporous membranes are much larger than previously understood, with
major implications for structure/transport relationships. For future nanoscale
pore analysis of membranes (and other nanoporous materials), we recommend low
acceleration voltage (1 kV), minimal coatings (1-2 nm), and digital dilation to
account for coating artifacts

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种优化缩减晶格量子多体哈密顿量局部希尔伯特基的方法，利用单点约化密度矩阵的特征值进行基截断，适用于多种模型和相变区域，显著降低了经典和量子模拟的计算资源需求。

We show how to optimally reduce the local Hilbert basis of lattice quantum
many-body (QMB) Hamiltonians. The basis truncation exploits the most relevant
eigenvalues of the estimated single-site reduced density matrix (RDM). It is
accurate and numerically stable across different model phases, even close to
quantum phase transitions. We apply this procedure to different models, such as
the Sine-Gordon model, the $\varphi^{4}$ theory, and lattice gauge theories,
namely Abelian $\mathrm{U}(1)$ and non-Abelian $\mathrm{SU}(2)$, in one and two
spatial dimensions. Our results reduce state-of-the-art estimates of
computational resources for classical and quantum simulations.

In this work, we patterned a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) on the
surface of a SrTiO$_3$ thin film grown homoepitaxially on SrTiO$_3$ by hybrid
molecular beam epitaxy (hMBE). We explored the superconducting dome in this
material system by tuning electron density with ionic liquid gating. We found
superconducting transitions up to 503 mK near an optimal electron density of
approximately 3 $\times$ 10$^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$. This is a meaningful increase
from the typical optimal transition near 350 mK in similar 2DEGs on SrTiO$_3$
single crystal substrate surfaces. Systematic tuning of 2DEG electron density
revealed a consistent BCS scaling between superconducting critical temperature,
coherence length, and electron mean free path. Substantial variation of
transition width across the dome was described by a paraconductivity model
combining Aslamazov-Larkin and Maki-Thompson contributions.

### Low-Noise Nanoscale Vortex Sensor for Out-of-Plane Magnetic Field Detection

- **TL;DR**: 该研究开发了一种基于纳米尺度磁隧道结的涡旋传感器，专门用于检测垂直磁场分量，相比传统平面涡旋传感器具有更宽的动态范围和更低的噪声。

This study investigates a vortex sensor based on a nanoscale (sub-100 nm)
magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) with a strong shape anisotropy, designed for
sensitivity to the out-of-plane magnetic field component ($H_z$). The sensor
comprises a free layer with a vortex configuration and a perpendicularly
magnetized reference layer, which provides a reproducible and linear response
when excited by a perpendicular magnetic field. Experimental measurements and
micromagnetic simulations were combined to systematically assess the influence
of structural parameters, specifically aspect ratio and defect landscape, on
key sensor performance metrics, including dynamic range, sensitivity, and
detectivity. The out-of-plane vortex sensor demonstrates a significantly
improved dynamic range exceeding 200 mT, compared to the 40-80 mT typical of
conventional in-plane vortex sensors. Frequency-dependent noise measurements
reveal that the sensor exhibits low intrinsic noise, along with improved
detectivity and resolution. This performance is ascribed to the field-dependent
expansion and contraction of the vortex core, which reduces Barkhausen-type
noise caused by defect-induced pinning potentials. Moreover, the sub-100\,nm
lateral dimensions of the sensor enable scalable array integration, providing
further enhancements in noise and detectivity through collective averaging.
These results underscore the potential of this sensor architecture for advanced
magnetic field sensing applications requiring a wide dynamic range and high
measurement accuracy at the same time.

### The Quantum Method of Planes - Local Pressure Definitions for Machine Learning Potentials

- **TL;DR**: 本文扩展了平面法应力到MACE机器学习势中，解决了传统维里应力在非平衡态下的失效问题，证明了平面法应力在非平衡分子动力学中的有效性。

Stress or Pressure is a central quantity in engineering, and remains vital in
molecular modelling. However, the commonly used virial stress tensor is not
valid away from thermodynamic equilibrium, a common state required in fluid
dynamics and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulation. This is
solved by using the method of planes (MoP), a mechanical form of pressure,
simply interpreted as the force divided by area but derived from the firm
foundations of statistical mechanics. We present an extension of MoP stress to
the MACE potential, a particular form of machine learning (ML) potentials
allowing quantum mechanical (QM) physics in classical simulation. We present
the derivation of the MoP stress for the MACE potential using the theoretical
framework set out by Irving & Kirkwood (1950). For the testcase of an interface
between water and Zirconium Oxide, we show the MoP measures the correct force
balance while the virial form fails. Further, we demonstrate the MoP is valid
arbitrarily far from equilibrium, showing exact conservation every timestep in
a control volume bounded by MoP planes. This links the stress directly to the
conservation equations and demonstrates the validity in non equilibrium
molecular dynamics systems. All code to reproduce these validations for any
MACE system, together with ASE accelerated code to calculate the MoP are
provided as open source. This work helps build the foundation to extend the ML
revolution in materials to NEMD and molecular fluid dynamics modelling.

In this work I revisit the notion of gauge invariance in thermal transport
and show, in the simplest and most general possibile terms, why heat
conductivity is unaffected by the specific choice of energy density. I provide
the minimal and general conditions under which any two energy densities, though

framework. The relevance of gauge invariance in heat-transport simulations
performed with machine-trained neural-network potentials is also briefly
highlighted.

### Positive magnetoconductance in SrVO3 double quantum wells with a magnetic EuTiO3 barrier

- **TL;DR**: 该论文研究了在SrVO3双量子阱结构中，通过EuTiO3磁性势垒调控波函数杂化，发现薄势垒（&lt;2nm）在磁场下出现显著正磁导现象，归因于V 3d轨道杂化增强和Ti 3d能带的Zeeman分裂。

Controlling Mott insulator states has been a long-standing topic in condensed
matter physics. Among various controlling parameters, two-dimensional (2D)
confinement in epitaxial heterostructures has been demonstrated to convert the
correlated metallic nature of SrVO3 into a Mott insulator by reducing the
quantum well thickness. Here, we fabricate double quantum well (DQW) structures
of SrVO3 with a magnetic barrier of EuTiO3 to tune the hybridization of wave
functions by a magnetic field. A significant positive magnetoconductance is
observed for DQWs with barriers thinner than 2 nm, while DQWs with thicker
barriers do not show such large positive magnetoconductance, instead behaving
as a parallel circuit of two single QWs. The observed positive
magnetoconductance is accounted in terms of enhanced hybridization of V 3d
orbitals across the EuTiO3 barrier under a magnetic field, where the barrier
height is reduced by the Zeeman splitting of Ti 3d bands in forced
ferromagnetic ordering of localized 4f electrons on Eu2+sites.

Using a computational crystal structure search in the Li-Fe-B ternary system,
we predict a stable phase of Li3Fe8B8, featuring 1D channels that enable rapid
Li-ion transport. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations show that the Li-ion
diffusion coefficient in Li3Fe8B8 surpasses that of common electrode and
conductive additive materials by several orders of magnitude. The high
diffusion in Li3Fe8B8 can be explained by the Frenkel-Kontorova model, which
describes an incommensurate state between the Li diffusion chain and the
periodic potential field caused by the FeB backbone structure. The favorable
lithium-ion diffusivity and mechanical properties of Li3Fe8B8 make it a
promising conductive additive for battery materials. Its itinerant
ferromagnetism also offers a platform for exploring correlated-electron
magnetism and spin-dependent phenomena.

### THz electrodynamics and superconducting energy scales of ZrN thin films

The terahertz (THz) properties of ZrN thin films grown with CMOS-techniques
on industry-standard 300 mm silicon wafers are investigated in order to explore
their superconducting behavior. The films have thicknesses ranging from 18 to
48 nm, and their critical temperatures Tc are between 5 and 7.3 K. We probe the
real and imaginary parts of the complex dynamical conductivity sigma in the
frequency range from 100 - 540 GHz (0.4 - 2.2 meV) and as a function of
temperature. The experiments provide direct access to the low-energy
electrodynamics and key materials parameters such as superconducting energy gap
and superfluid density. Our findings indicate that ZrN is a weakly coupled
BCS-type superconductor with a gap-to-Tc ratio of approximately 3.4 in the
thick film limit. For thinner films, this coupling ratio increases up to 4.0,
departing from the BCS prediction. The results establish large-scale ZrN thin
films as promising material for high-frequency superconducting applications.

We investigate the tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) of a bilayer system made
of $X$-wave magnets with $X=p,d,f,g,i$, where $X=d,g,i$ corresponds to
altermagnets. A universal analytic formula is derived for the TMR ratio. It is
proportional to $\left\vert J\right\vert /\left( N_{X}\Gamma \right) $ for
small $\Gamma $, where $N_{X}$ is the number of the nodes of the $X$% -wave
magnet, $J$ is the strength of the $X$-wave magnet, and $\Gamma $ is the
self-energy. It is contrasted with the TMR ratio made of ferromagnets, where it
is proportional to $J^{2}/\Gamma ^{2}$ for small $\Gamma $. Therefore, the TMR
ratio is larger in ferromagnets for $\left\vert J\right\vert &gt;\Gamma $.
However, the $X$-wave magnets are expected to achieve high-speed and
ultra-dense memory owing to the zero net magnetization.

The vibrational response of polymer networks under load provides a sensitive
probe of molecular deformation and a route to non-destructive diagnostics. Here
we show that machine-learned force fields reproduce these spectroscopic
fingerprints with quantum-level fidelity in realistic epoxy thermosets. Using
MACE-OFF23 molecular dynamics, we capture the experimentally observed redshifts
of para-phenylene stretching modes under tensile load, in contrast to the
harmonic OPLS-AA model. These shifts correlate with molecular elongation and
alignment, consistent with Badger's rule, directly linking vibrational features
to local stress. To capture IR intensities, we trained a symmetry-adapted
dipole moment model on representative epoxy fragments, enabling validation of
strain responses. Together, these approaches provide chemically accurate and
computationally accessible predictions of strain-dependent vibrational spectra.
Our results establish vibrational fingerprints as predictive markers of
mechanical state in polymer networks, pointing to new strategies for stress
mapping and structural-health diagnostics in advanced materials.

### Coarsening dynamics for spiral and nonspiral waves in active Potts models

- **TL;DR**: 该研究通过蒙特卡洛模拟分析了q态活性Potts模型在循环对称条件下的域增长动力学，发现螺旋波和非螺旋波在饱和前表现出不同的生长速率特征。

This study examines the domain-growth dynamics of $q$-state active Potts
models ($q = 3$--$8$) under the cyclically symmetric conditions using Monte
Carlo simulations on square and hexagonal lattices. By imposing active cyclic
flipping of states, finite-length waves emerge in the long-term limit. This
study focuses on coarsening dynamics from an initially random mixture of states
to these moving-domain states. When spiral waves appear in the final state, the
correlation length follows the Lifshitz--Allen--Cahn (LAC) law ($\propto
t^{1/2}$) until saturation is observed at the characteristic wavelength. By
contrast, in the case of nonspiral waves, the growth rate is raised prior to
the saturation, leading to a transient increase in the coarsening exponent.
Moreover, the mean cluster size exhibits a similar form of transient increase
under most of the conditions. In factorized symmetry modes at $q=6$, domains
composed of two or three states similarly follow the LAC law. Finally, this
study confirmed that the choice of lattice type (square or hexagonal) and
update scheme (Metropolis or Glauber) does not alter the dynamic behavior.

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a highly tunable class of crystalline
materials where metal atoms or clusters are connected by organic linkers. They
offer a versatile platform for exploring quantum phenomena such as entangled
magnetism, superconductivity, and topology. Particularly for magnetism, their
modular chemistry enables extensive control over magnetic interactions, spin
magnitudes, lattice geometries, and even light-responsiveness, making them a
uniquely adaptable platform. However, despite their promise, their
low-temperature behavior and magnetic properties remain largely unexplored and
represent an underappreciated opportunity in quantum materials research. With
potential applications ranging from quantum computation to energy transfer, we
believe that MOFs and particularly {\it magnetic} MOFs offer a vast and largely
untapped frontier for transformative discoveries and high-impact quantum
materials research.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究通过低温电子显微镜观察1T-TiSe$_2$纳米薄片中电荷密度波(CDW)的尺寸依赖性成核和熔化现象，发现当薄片横向尺寸小于100纳米时CDW熔点下降，验证了电子相变遵循经典成核理论。

Classical nucleation theory predicts size-dependent nucleation and melting
due to surface and confinement effects at the nanoscale. In correlated
electronic states, observation of size-dependent nucleation and melting is
rarely reported, likely due to the extremely small length scales necessary to
observe such effects for electronic states. Here, using 1T-TiSe$_2$ nanoflakes
as a prototypical two-dimensional (2D) charge density wave (CDW) system, we
perform in-situ cryogenic electron microscopy with temperature down to 20 K and
observe size-dependent nucleation and melting of CDWs. Specifically, we observe
a melting point depression of CDW for 1T-TiSe$_2$ flakes with lateral sizes
less than 100 nm. By fitting experimental data to a Ginzburg-Landau model, we
estimate a zero-temperature correlation length of 10--50 nm, which matches the
reported CDW domain size for 1T-TiSe$_2$. As the flake size approaches the
correlation length, the divergence of the CDW correlation length near the
transition is cut off by the finite flake size, limiting long-range order and
thereby lowering the transition temperature. For very small flakes whose size
is close to the correlation length, we also observe absence of CDWs, as
predicted by the model. We thus show that an electronic phase transition
follows classical nucleation theory.

### Electronic-correlation-assisted charge stripe order in a Kagome superconductor

- **TL;DR**: 本文通过多种实验和理论方法，在Sn掺杂的CsV3Sb5 Kagome超导体中发现了一种新的短程电荷条纹序，这种序与长程2×2电荷密度波序共存，揭示了晶格和电子自由度之间协同相互作用导致新电子序出现的新途径。

A central mystery in high-temperature cuprate superconductors is the
coexistence of multiple exotic orders, which is presumably associated with
strong electronic correlation. The ongoing interest in this enigmatic
phenomenon is further energized when similar electronic orders and states
emerge and coexist in less correlated Kagome superconductors. Here, by
utilizing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and
first-principles calculations, we reveal the sudden emergence of a distinct
short-range charge stripe order in Sn-doped CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ Kagome
superconductors when the long-range $2 \times 2$ charge density wave order in
pristine CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ is suppressed. This short-range stripe order features a
modulation vector of approximately 1/3 along one of the three lattice
directions, induces remarkable quasiparticle scattering between the original
quasi-1D Kagome-d-bands and their replica of folding, and clearly suppresses
the electron density of states at the Fermi level. Our first-principles
calculations reveal that $3 \times 1$ supermodulation represents a hidden
secondary instability in pristine CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. This instability is further
enhanced by in-plane chemical pressure induced by Sn substitution, and coupled
to the electronic correlation, leading to a unique charge stripe order in the
system. As such, our results reveal a new route toward emergent electronic
orders via cooperative interactions between the lattice and electronic degrees
of freedom.

Spin Seebeck effect refers to the magnonic thermal spin injection from a
magnet into the adjacent heavy metal. A ferrimagnetic insulator yttrium iron
garnet (YIG) is the material most studied for the spin Seebeck effect. Here, to
account for a convex downward temperature dependence of the spin Seebeck effect
observed in YIG/Pt system near the Curie temperature $T_{\rm C}$, we develop
Ginzburg-Landau theory of the spin Seebeck effect in two-sublattice
ferrimagnets. We find that only when we take into account the ``N\'{e}el
coupling'', i.e., interfacial exchange coupling between the N\'{e}el order
parameter of YIG and spin accumulation of Pt, the convex downward temperature
dependence is explained. The present result sheds light on the importance of
the N\'{e}el coupling in ferrimagnetic spintronics.

### Efficient All-Electron Periodic Fourier-Transformed Coulomb Method

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种基于Ewald求和与傅里叶变换库仑方法的全电子周期性库仑矩阵高效算法，实现了比现有方法数量级的加速

We present an efficient algorithm for the all-electron periodic Coulomb
matrix based on the Ewald summation combined with the Fourier-transformed
Coulomb method. The short-range contributions involving compact densities are
evaluated in real space using the standard Gaussian density fitting method. For
the long-range contributions, we introduce an integral-direct planewave density
fitting, applicable to both compact and diffuse densities. The resulting method
achieves orders-of-magnitude speedups for prototypical solid-state systems
compared to a closely related approach, the range-separated density fitting
method. Using dispersion-corrected PBE functional and all-electron Dunning and
Karlsruhe basis sets, we apply our method to compute the cohesive energy of the
benzene crystal and the adsorption energy of CO on the MgO(001) surface. These
results are in good agreement with existing literature. Our approach enables
efficient Gaussian-based semi-local density functional calculations using dense
$\mathbf {k}$-point meshes and traditional molecular Gaussian basis sets.

### Arbitrary number of thermally induced phase transitions in different universality classes in $XY$ models with higher-order terms

- **Categories**: cond-mat.stat-mech
- **TL;DR**: 提出了广义XY模型的变体，通过添加指数增长的向列项，仅通过改变温度就能展现任意数量的相变。对于q=2,3,4，系统经历从顺磁相到铁磁相的级联相变；对于q=5，相变数量增加到2n_t-1个，且不遵循普适性规律。

We propose generalized variants of the $XY$ model capable of exhibiting an
arbitrary number of phase transitions only by varying temperature. They are
constructed by supplementing the magnetic coupling with $n_t-1$ nematic terms
of exponentially increasing order with the base $q=2,3,4$ and $5$, and
increasing interaction strength. It is found that for $q=2,3$ and $4$ with
sufficiently large coupling strength of the final term, the models exhibit a
number of phase transitions equal to the number of the terms in the generalized
Hamiltonian. Starting from the paramagnetic phase, the system transitions
through the cascade of $n_t-1$ nematic phases of the orders $q^{k}$,
$k=n_t-1,n_t-2,\hdots,1$, that are characterized by $q^{k}$ preferential spin
directions symmetrically disposed around the circle, to the ferromagnetic (FM)
phase at the lowest temperatures. Besides the BKT transition from the
paramagnetic phase, all the remaining transitions have a non-BKT nature:
depending on the value of $q$ they belong to either the Ising ($q=2$ and $4$)
or the three-states Potts ($q=3$) universality class. For $q=5$, due to the
interplay between different terms, the phase transitions between the ordered
phases observed for $q&lt;5$ split into two and the number of the ordered phases
increases to $2n_t-1$. These phases are characterized by a domain structure
with the gradually increasing short-range FM ordering within domains that
extends to different kinds of FM ordering in the last two low-temperature
phases. The respective transitions do not seem to obey any universality.

### Magnetic Frustration in CuYbSe$_2$: an Yb-Based Triangular Lattice Selenide

The Yb based triangular lattice delafossites $A$Yb$X_2$ ($A$ = alkali metal,
$X$ = O, S, Se) have recently been studied as quantum spin liquid candidates.
We report the synthesis of powders and single crystals of CuYbSe$_2$ with a
perfect triangular lattice of Yb$^{3+}$ moments. Magnetic susceptibility and
heat capacity measurements reveal no evidence of long-range magnetic ordering
down to $1.8$~K in spite of a significant antiferromagnetic exchange between
Yb$^{3+}$ moments, suggesting a frustrated magnetic system. Electrical
resistivity measurements indicate insulating behavior, consistent with the
localized nature of magnetic moments. Heat capacity reveals that CuYbSe$_2$ can
be treated as an effective spin $S = 1/2$ triangular lattice antiferromagnet
below $\sim 50$~K. Magnetic susceptibility measurements on single crystals
reveals weak magnetic anisotropy. These properties position CuYbSe$_2$ as a
promising candidate for a quantum spin liquid state and as a new platform for
exploring exotic magnetic ground states in triangular lattice systems.

### Ductile fracture of HDPE thin films: failure mechanisms and tuning of fracture properties by bonding a rubber layer

- **TL;DR**: 本研究揭示了高密度聚乙烯（HDPE）薄膜的反直觉失效机制，发现失效不是发生在最大拉伸处，而是在颈缩区或缺口尖端塑性区边界。通过添加SEPS弹性体夹层可以抑制韧性损伤，将失效机制从损伤驱动转变为拉伸驱动，从而提高韧性和缺陷容限。

High-density polyethylene (HDPE) thin films, while inherently ductile,
exhibit poor flaw tolerance. Our experiments show that they fail prematurely
not at the point of maximum stretch, but at the boundary of a necked region or
notch-tip plastic zone. This study investigates this counter-intuitive failure
mechanism and demonstrates how an elastomeric interlayer can mitigate it to
enhance toughness. Through a combined experimental (uniaxial, center-notched,
pure shear tests) and computational approach, we analyze freestanding HDPE and
HDPE-SEPS-HDPE trilayer laminates. Finite element simulations reveal that
failure in free-standing HDPE is not governed by a maximum stretch criterion.
Instead, it is driven by ductile damage, modeled using a damage parameter that
depends on stress-triaxiality and plastic strain. This damage localizes
initially at the notch or neck center, but migrates into a "hotspot" at the
neck/plastic zone boundary, matching the observed crack initiation site. The
addition of a soft SEPS interlayer fundamentally alters this behavior by
suppressing the ductile damage, causing the failure mechanism to switch from
being damage-driven at the neck/plastic zone boundary to being stretch-driven
at the notch tip. This switch enhances flaw tolerance and stretchability by
relocating and delaying fracture initiation in both defect-free and notched
geometries. This work exposes the failure mechanism in HDPE thin films and
provides a mechanistically-grounded framework for toughening ductile polymers
by manipulating the competition between damage and stretch localization.

### Same-group element replacement enhances superconductivity in clathrate-like YH4

- **TL;DR**: 本研究通过在YH4中部分替换Yttrium为Scandium、Lanthanum和Zirconium，探索提高氢化物超导材料临界温度的策略。发现(Y,Sc)H4在100 GPa下Tc可达124.43 K，而其他替换会降低Tc。

H3S, LaH10, and hydrogen-based compounds have garnered significant interest
due to their high-temperature superconducting properties. However, the
requirement for extremely high pressures limits their practical applications.
In this study, YH4 is adopted as a base material, with partial substitution of
Yttrium (Y) by Scandium (Sc), Lanthanum (La), and Zirconium (Zr). Pure YH4,
stable at 120 GPa, exhibits a critical temperature (Tc) of 84-95 K.
Substituting half of the Y atoms increases Tc to 124.43 K for (Y,Sc)H4 at 100
GPa but reduces it to 101.24 K for (Y,La)H4 at 120 GPa. In contrast, (Y,Zr)H4
at 200 GPa shows a further suppressed Tc of 69.55 K. The remarkable
superconductivity in (Y,Sc)H4 might be related to its unique phonon dispersion
without optical-acoustic gap, compressed Y-H bonds, and significant electron
delocalization under pressure, collectively boosting electron-phonon
interactions. Furthermore, the lowest optical phonons play a crucial role in
the superconductivity of these materials. This work suggests that substituting
Y with same-group metal elements is an effective strategy to enhance Tc in
hydride superconductors.

We demonstrate phase-coherent transport in suspended long-channel Cd3As2
nanowire devices using both direct current (DC) transport and radio-frequency
(RF) reflectometry measurements. By integrating Cd3As2 nanowires with on-chip
superconducting LC resonators, we achieve sensitive detection of both
resistance and quantum capacitance variations. In a long-channel device (L ~
1.8 {\mu}m), clear Fabry-P\'erot (FP) interference patterns are observed in
both DC and RF measurements, provide strong evidence for ballistic electron
transport. RF reflectometry reveals gate-dependent modulations of the resonance
frequency, arising from quantum capacitance oscillations induced by changes in
the density of states and FP interference. These oscillations exhibit a
quasi-periodic structure that closely correlates with the FP patterns in DC
transport measurements. In another device of a Cd3As2 nanowire Josephson
junction (L ~ 730 nm, superconducting Al contacts), FP interference patterns
are too weak to be resolved in DC conductance but are detectable using RF
reflectometry. These results demonstrate the high quality of our Cd3As2
nanowires and the versatility of RF reflectometry, establishing their potential
for applications in topological quantum devices, such as Andreev qubits or
gatemon architectures.

### The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly of Atomistic Learning for "Clusters-to-Bulk" Generalization

Training machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) on total energies of
molecular clusters using differential or transfer learning is becoming a
popular route to extend the accuracy of correlated wave-function theory to
condensed phases. A key challenge, however, lies in validation, as reference
observables in finite-temperature ensembles are not available at the reference
level. Here, we construct synthetic reference data from pretrained MLIPs and
evaluate the generalizability of cluster-trained models on ice-Ih, considering
scenarios where both energies and forces and where only energies are available
for training. We study the accuracy and data-efficiency of differential,
single-fidelity transfer, and multi-fidelity transfer learning against
ground-truth thermodynamic observables. We find that transferring accuracy from
clusters to bulk requires regularization, which is best achieved through
multi-fidelity transfer learning when training on both energies and forces. By
contrast, training only on energies introduces artefacts: stable trajectories
and low energy errors conceal large force errors, leading to inaccurate
microscopic observables. More broadly, we show that accurate reproduction of
microscopic structure correlates strongly with low force errors but only weakly
with energy errors, whereas global properties such as energies and densities
correlate with low energy errors. This highlights the need to incorporate
forces during training or to apply careful validation before production. Our
results highlight the promise and pitfalls of cluster-trained MLIPs for
condensed phases and provide guidelines for developing - and critically,
validating - robust and data-efficient MLIPs.

### Reduced fluctuations: Surprising effects of noise cross correlations in a coupled, driven model

- **TL;DR**: 本文研究了耦合驱动模型中强耦合相如何受到噪声交叉相关的影响，发现第二个场的粗糙指数随噪声交叉相关振幅连续变化，表明噪声交叉相关可以抑制强耦合相中的涨落。

We elucidate how the strong coupling phases of a coupled driven model,
originally proposed in S. Mukherjee, Phys. Rev. E 108, 024219 (2023), are
affected by noise cross correlations in general dimensions $d$. This model has
two dynamical variables, where one of the variables is autonomous being
independent of the other, whereas the second one depends explicitly on the
former. By employing model coupling theories, we study the strong coupling
phase of model. We show that the scaling laws in the strong coupling phase of
the second field depend strongly on the strength of the noise cross
correlations: the roughness exponent of the second field varies continuously
with the noise cross correlation amplitude. As the latter amplitude rises, the
roughness exponent gradually decreases, suggestion a novel suppression of the
fluctuations of the second field in the strong coupling phase by noise cross
correlations. We discuss the phenomenological implications of our results.

We study phase transitions in bilayer and trilayer bosonic quantum Hall
systems. In the absence of interlayer tunneling and interaction, each layer is
chosen to have filling factor $\nu=1/2$ or $1$ to realize the Laughlin state or
the Moore-Read state. By tuning interlayer tunneling and/or interaction,
multiple phases can be generated. In the absence of interlayer interaction,
three phase transitions appear when interlayer tunneling becomes sufficiently
strong: (1) from two decoupled $\nu=1/2$ Laughlin states to the Moore-Read
state in bilayer systems; (2) from one $\nu=1/2$ Laughlin state plus one
$\nu=1$ Moore-Read state to the Read-Rezayi $\mathbb{Z}_{3}$ state in bilayer
systems; (3) from three decoupled $\nu=1/2$ Laughlin states to the Read-Rezayi
$\mathbb{Z}_{3}$ state in trilayer systems. Numerical calculations suggest that
these transitions are third-order ones. We propose non-Abelian
Chern-Simons-Higgs theory to describe them. If both interlayer tunneling and
interaction are present, one-component or multi-component composite fermion
liquids and Jain states can be realized. This leads to intricate phase diagrams
that host multiple phase transitions and possibly exotic critical points.

Computational materials science has evolved toward materials informatics,
where large datasets of complex, multispecies compounds are generated and
evaluated using density functional theory (DFT). Materials genome projects mine
these datasets for candidates with breakthrough properties, but existing
databases remain limited to compounds with relatively small unit cells due to
computational cost. Exascale computers now provide the power to simulate larger
and more chemically realistic systems, but fully realizing this potential
requires DFT codes that can efficiently scale to thousands of processors. Our
real-space multigrid (RMG) DFT code's grid-decomposition approach scales nearly
linearly with the number of GPUs, even for simulations exceeding thousands of
atoms. This scalability makes RMG a compelling tool for high-throughput DFT
studies of materials that would otherwise be bottlenecked in other codes (for
example, by global Fast Fourier Transforms in plane-wave DFT). In this work, we
present pyRMG, a Python package designed to streamline the setup and execution
of RMG DFT calculations. Built on the pymatgen and ASE Python packages, pyRMG
automates input generation and convergence checking, and integrates with modern
job schedulers (e.g., Flux) on leadership-class platforms such as Frontier and
Perlmutter. We demonstrate pyRMG for a high-throughput study of interfacial
strain and twist-angle effects in lattice-matched, 2D Bi$_2$Se$_3$/NbSe$_2$
heterostructures, which form large, anisotropic supercells. Our results link
strain and twist angle to material informatics properties, including stability
and band gap, and show that pyRMG can initialize and converge challenging
RMG-based workflows with limited user intervention.

### Magnetic flux controlled current phase relationship in double Quantum Dot Josephson junction

In this work, we study a Josephson junction with parallel-connected quantum
dots (QDs) threaded by a magnetic flux in the central region. We discretize the
superconducting (SC) electrode into three discrete energy levels and modify the
tunneling coefficients to construct a finite-dimensional surrogate Hamiltonian.
By directly diagonalizing this Hamiltonian, we compute the physical quantities
of the system. Additionally, we employ a low-energy effective model to gain
deeper physical insight. Our findings reveal that when only one QD exhibits
Coulomb interaction, the system undergoes a phase transition between singlet
and doublet states. The magnetic flux has a minor influence on the singlet
state but significantly affects the doublet state. When both QDs have
interactions, the system undergoes two phase transitions as the SC phase
difference increases: the ground state evolves from a doublet to a singlet and
finally into a triplet state at $\phi = \pi$. Increasing the magnetic flux
suppresses the doublet and triplet phases, eventually stabilizing the singlet
state. In this regime, enhancing the interaction strength does not induce a
singlet-doublet transition but instead drives a transition between upper and
lower singlet states, leading to a critical current peak as $U$ increases.
Finally, we examine the case where the tunneling coefficient $\Gamma$ exceeds
the SC pairing potential $\Delta$. Here, doublet states dominate, and the
system only exhibits a phase transition between doublet and triplet states when
$\phi_B = 0$. In the presence of a magnetic flux, the three states converge,
resulting in a triple point in the ($\phi$, $\phi_B$) parameter space.

The surface states of 3D topological insulators possess geometric structures
that imprint distinctive signatures on electronic transport. A prime example is
the Berry curvature, which controls electric frequency doubling via a higher
order moment, called Berry curvature triple. In addition to the Berry
curvature, topological surface states are expected to exhibit a nontrivial
quantum metric, which plays a key role in governing nonlinear magnetotransport.
However, its manifestation has yet to be experimentally observed in 3D
topological insulators. Here, we provide evidence for a nonlinear response
activated by the quantum metric of the topological surface states of
Sb$_2$Te$_3$. We measure a time-reversal odd, nonlinear magnetoresistance that
is independent of temperature and disorder below 30 K and is thus of intrinsic
geometrical origin. Our measurements demonstrate the existence of quantum
geometry-induced transport in topological phases of matter and provide

- **TL;DR**: 提出DeepEOSNet架构，通过分离分子结构和状态依赖性的处理来改进热力学性质预测，在状态域数据稀疏时表现优异

We propose a machine learning (ML) architecture to better capture the
dependency of thermodynamic properties on the independent states. When
predicting state-dependent thermodynamic properties, ML models need to account
for both molecular structure and the thermodynamic state, described by
independent variables, typically temperature, pressure, and composition. Modern
molecular ML models typically include state information by adding it to
molecular fingerprint vectors or by embedding explicit (semi-empirical)
thermodynamic relations. Here, we propose to rather split the information
processing on the molecular structure and the dependency on states into two
separate network channels: a graph neural network and a multilayer perceptron,
whose output is combined by a dot product. We refer to our approach as
DeepEOSNet, as this idea is based on the DeepONet architecture [Lu et al.
(2021), Nat. Mach. Intell.]: instead of operators, we learn state dependencies,
with the possibility to predict equation of states (EOS). We investigate the
predictive performance of DeepEOSNet by means of three case studies, which
include the prediction of vapor pressure as a function of temperature, and
mixture molar volume as a function of composition, temperature, and pressure.
Our results show superior performance of DeepEOSNet for predicting vapor
pressure and comparable performance for predicting mixture molar volume
compared to state-of-research graph-based thermodynamic prediction models from
our earlier works. In fact, we see large potential of DeepEOSNet in cases where
data is sparse in the state domain and the output function is structurally
similar across different molecules. The concept of DeepEOSNet can easily be
transferred to other ML architectures in molecular context, and thus provides a
viable option for property prediction.

Nonreciprocal interactions are widely observed in nonequilibrium systems,
from biological or sociological dynamics to open quantum systems. Despite the
ubiquity of nonreciprocity, its impact on phase transitions is not fully
understood. In this work, we derive criteria to perturbatively assess whether
nonreciprocity changes the universality class of pairs of asymmetrically
coupled systems undergoing a phase transition. These simple criteria are stated
in terms of the unperturbed critical exponents, in the spirit of the Harris
criterion for disordered systems, and agree with numerical simulations. Beyond
nonreciprocity, our approach provides guidelines for assessing how dynamical
phase transitions are affected by perturbations.

- **TL;DR**: 本研究系统研究了Grüneisen比在量子临界点附近的普适标度函数，通过热张量网络方法和量子蒙特卡洛模拟，在一维和二维量子自旋系统中建立了定量框架。

The Gr\"uneisen ratio, defined as $\Gamma_g \equiv (1/T) (\partial T/\partial
g)_S$, serves as a highly sensitive probe for detecting quantum critical points
(QCPs) driven by an external feild $g$ and for characterizing the
magnetocaloric effect (MCE). Near a QCP, the Gr\"uneisen ratio displays a
universal divergence which is governed by a universality-class-dependent
scaling function stemming from the scale invariance. In this work, we
systematically investigate the universal scaling functions of Gr\"uneisen ratio
in both one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) quantum spin systems,
including the transverse-field Ising model, the spin-1/2 Heisenberg model, the
quantum $q$-state Potts model ($q=3,4$) and the $J_1$-$J_2$ columnar dimer
model. Our approach employs the thermal tensor-network method for infinite-size
1D systems and the stochastic series expansion quantum Monte Carlo (SSE QMC)
simulations for 2D systems, enabling precise calculations of the Gr\"uneisen
ratio near QCPs. Through data collapse analysis, we extract the corresponding
scaling functions, which establish quantitative frameworks to interpret
magnetocaloric experiments and guide the development of ultralow-temperature
refrigeration.

### Selective photocatalyitic CO2 reduction to acetic acid on chiral mesostructured ZnIn2S4

- **TL;DR**: 开发了一种手性介孔ZnIn2S4光催化剂，实现了962 μmol g⁻¹ h⁻¹的乙酸产率和97.3%的选择性，比现有最高值提高10倍

Acetic acid, an important industrial chemical, is a key target for CO2
reduction due to its dual role in carbon utilization and chemical feedstock
supply.Although acetic acid can be produced by prhotocatalytic CO2 redcution.
Among other multicarbon products, it is typically a low-yieleded product due to
competing reaction pathways and inefficient C-C coupling. Herein, we report a
chiral mesostructured ZnIn2S4 photocatalyst that achieves a remarkable acetic
acid yield of 962 umolg-1h-1 with a high selectivity of 97.3%. The yield is ten
times higher than the current highest reported value, while attaining
state-of-the-art selectivity. The remarkable The remarkable productivity arises
from synergistic cooperation between chiral structure and sulfur (S) sites of
CMZI. Chirality-induced spin polarization in CMZI stabilizes the key triplet
OCCO intermediate, significantly promoting C-C coupling efficiency. Theoretical
calculations reveal that the S sites on (102) crystal facets of ZnIn2S4 exhibit
thermodynamic and kinetic preferences for acetic acid formation. This work
offers critical insights into catalytic strategies for CO2 reduction that could
enable the synthesis and scalable production of various multicarbon products.

### Quantum sensing of arbitrary magnetic signals with molecular spins

- **TL;DR**: 开发了两种基于Hahn回波序列的量子传感协议，能够在不同步的情况下区分时间相关的磁场信号，并在分子自旋系统中实现了高达10^{-7} T/√Hz的磁场灵敏度

Molecular spins offer a promising platform for quantum sensing, particularly
in organic, supramolecular or biological environments. Detection of periodic
magnetic fields has been demonstrated with molecular spins ($S$ = 1/2) using
manipulation protocols synchronized with the probed field. In this work, we
develop two quantum sensing protocols that enable discrimination between
different time-dependent magnetic field signals, without synchronization. These
are based on the Hahn echo sequence and have been tested on VO(TPP) and
$\text{VOPt(SCOPh)}_4$ molecular spins embedded in a superconducting YBCO
microwave resonator. We report a magnetic field sensitivity up to a few
$10^{-7} T \text{Hz}^{-\frac{1}{2}}$ (with lower bounds approaching $10^{-8} T
\text{Hz}^{-\frac{1}{2}}$) for signals with duration of a few microseconds.
Under the given conditions, the minimum signal area that can be measured is in
the $10^{-10}$ T s range, suggesting a potential trade-off between minimum
measurable field and the required signal duration and memory time.

### First principles simulation of the collective rovibronic ground state in a cavity

- **TL;DR**: 本文通过精确量子模拟研究了Fabry-Perot腔中光-物质强耦合对分子系综的影响，发现腔耦合会局部修改单个分子的旋转、核和电子可观测性质，但这些局部效应在热力学极限下会消失，而全局基态可观测性质则依赖于分子间和光-物质关联的正确处理。

Strong light-matter coupling in Fabry-Perot cavities can modify ground-state
molecular reactivity, charge and energy transport, while modifications to
single-molecule properties have not been observed experimentally. The
mechanisms and reproducibility of such effects remain contested, with
conflicting theoretical predictions driven by differences in Hamiltonian choice
and quantum state representation. Here, we resolve these ambiguities with
numerically exact quantum simulations of cavity-coupled molecular ensembles
based on the ab initio light-matter Hamiltonian, treating electrons, nuclei,
and cavity photons on equal footing. We investigate ensembles of the
rotational-vibrational-electronic Shin-Metiu model using variational
tree-tensor-network quantum dynamics, capturing rovibronic couplings and
anharmonicity. Embedding ensembles in a cavity induces local modifications of
rotational, nuclear, and --more weakly-- electronic observables in individual
molecules. The extent of these modifications depends only on the per-molecule
coupling strength up until each molecule reaches the ultrastrong coupling
regime, which remains unattainable in practical Fabry-Perot setups. Increasing
ensemble size toward the thermodynamic limit causes these local modifications
to vanish regardless of dipole self-energy inclusion. Nonetheless, global
ground-state observables, such as light-matter coupling energy contributions
(affecting overall polarizability) and cavity field displacement fluctuations,
depend crucially on proper treatment of intermolecular and light-matter
correlations, whereas intramolecular observables remain largely insensitive.
These insights are crucial for guiding future investigations using approximate
quantum treatments, and for the interpretation of experimental results in
polaritonic chemistry.

We perform large-scale simulations of the two-dimensional long-range bond
percolation model with algebraically decaying percolation probabilities $\sim
1/r^{2+\sigma}$, using both conventional ensemble and event-based ensemble
methods for system sizes up to $L=16384$. We accurately determine the critical
points, the universal values of several dimensionless quantities, and the
corresponding critical exponents. Our results provide compelling evidence that
the system undergoes a crossover from short-range to long-range universality at
$\sigma = 2$, in contradiction to Sak's criterion. Notably, we observe a
pronounced jump in the universal values and critical exponents at $\sigma = 2$,
a feature absent from previous studies.

### Dynamics of $\mathrm{CP}^{N-1}$ skyrmions

We derive several exact results for the dynamics of CP$^{N-1}$ skyrmions with
arbitrary $N$. Fractonic continuity equation is shown to hold for arbitrary
CP$^{N-1}$ fluid implying the conservation of the topological charge and the
dipole moment. Inclusion of the Gilbert damping modifies the continuity
equation, resulting in the violation of the dipole moment conservation but not
of the topological charge. Thiele's equation for the CP$^{N-1}$ skyrmion
follows from the modified continuity equation. The Girvin-MacDonald-Platzman
(GMP) algebra in the long-wavelength limit is derived for arbitrary CP$^{N-1}$
fluid. In the case of CP$^2$ skyrmions, we identify two kinds of energetically
stable skyrmions in which the quadrupolar moments or the ferromagnetic moments
are dominant. In the latter case, one can associate a nonzero CP$^1$ charge
equal to half the CP$^2$ skyrmion charge and argue that the topological Hall
effect of electrons should exist due to their coupling to the ferromagnetic
part of the CP$^2$ texture.

We demonstrate that spin PN junctions-magnetic semiconductor homojunctions
with spin splitting-induced band offsets-fundamentally redefine carrier
transport via spin-dependent recom bination probabilities. By integrating this
mechanism into the Shockley model, we predict
  a near 100 enhancement in magnetoresistance sensitivity under small forward
bias, where exponen tial modulation of recombination lifetimes by magnetic
fields amplifies resistance changes.
  Angular momentum conservation enables magnetically tunable circularly
polarized luminescence:
  exclusive conduction-band or valence-band splitting in both neutral regions
achieves near-half po larization, while global splitting degrades emission
coherence. Furthermore, we propose
  a "spin Zener filter" exploiting 1eV valence band splitting in (Ga, Mn)As,
where spin-dependent
  barrier heights generate near 100% spin-polarized tunneling currents within a
voltage-selective win dow. These results establish spin PN junctions as a
universal design paradigm for magnetically
  amplified electronics, polarization-programmable optoelectronics, and
voltage-gated spin injection
  without ferromagnetic contacts.

Encapsulation protects functional layers, ensuring structural stability and
improving the quality of assembled van der Waals heterostructures. Here, we
develop a model that describes lattice relaxation in twisted bilayers
accounting for encapsulation effects, incorporated via a single parameter
characterizing rigidity of encapsulation material interfaces. By analysing the
twist-angle dependence of weak-to-strong lattice relaxation transition in
twisted transition metal dichalcogenide bilayers, we show that increasing
interface rigidity raises the crossover twist angle between the two relaxation
regimes. Furthermore, tuning this rigidity parameter allows to achieve a good
agreement with existing experimental results.

In this work, a theoretical scheme on quantum molecular dynamics in curved
Schwarzschild spacetime is developed. To this end, the gravitational field is
introduced by revising the kinetics energy operator (KEO) rather than by adding
Newtonian gravitational interaction in the potential energy surface (PES) due
to the important role of the metric tensor in deriving the KEO. To test the
present Schr{\"o}dinger-type framework, spherically symmetric Schwarzschild
spacetime is chosen to explore (1) the H + H$_2$ reaction dynamics, (2) the
H$_2$ + H$_2$ scattering dynamics, (3) dynamics of dissociative chemsorption of
H$_2$O on Cu(111), and (4) the spectrum band of anthracene cation. Extensive
numerical calculations in curved space predict that reaction or scattering
probability and spectrum band decrease abruptly to zero as the gravitational
strength increases, indicating the remarkable role of gravitational field in
chemical dynamics and naturally leading to effects of gravitational time
dilation of the molecular systems. However, it is noteworthy that moderate
gravitational field can significantly enhance dynamical resonance in the
low-energy region, if such resonance exists in flat space. Finally, based on
the present numerical results discussions on the quantum molecular dynamics in
curved space are given.

The compounds 1T-TaX2 (X = S, Se) and 1T-NbSe2 have been considered as
potential hosts of a quantum spin liquid phase. This is based on the widely
held view that the Mott-Hubbard mechanism drives the insulating behaviour of
its charge density wave ground state, resulting in localized spins, interacting
antiferromagnetically, on a geometrically frustrated lattice. However this
assumes layer-wise independent behaviour. A growing body of evidence shows not
only that inter-layer interactions are very significant in 1T-TaS2, but also
that they mediate some of its most interesting functional properties. Here we
offer a perspective from the point of view of scanning tunnelling microscopy
that helps to visualize the microscopic degrees of freedom of inter-layer
interactions in bulk 1T-TaS2, and the associated impact on the local
density-of-states, including the occurrence of multiple distinct insulating
phases. We consider to what extent the bulk of 1T-TaS2, and its surface
terminations can be considered as Mott insulating and whether, or where,
quantum spin liquid behaviour might persist. To better understand the bulk
behaviour we also draw insights from measurements on isolated monolayers of
1T-TaX2 and 1T-NbSe2, where the confounding complications of inter-layer
interactions are absent. We highlight some outstanding questions raised by a
comprehensive evaluation of the experimental results, and finally suggest
future experiments that could address them.

Atomic and molecular scattering at semiconductor interfaces plays a central
role in surface chemistry and catalysis, yet predictive simulations remain
challenging due to strong nonadiabatic effects causing the breakdown of the
Born-Oppenheimer approximation. Here, we present fully quantum simulations of
H-atom scattering from the Ge(111)c(2x8) rest site using the hierarchical
equations of motion (HEOM) with matrix product states (MPS). The system is
modeled by mapping a density functional theory (DFT) potential energy surface
onto a Newns-Anderson Hamiltonian. Our simulations reproduce the experimentally
observed bimodal kinetic energy distributions, capturing both elastic and
energy-loss channels. By systematically examining atom-surface coupling,
incident energy, and isotope substitution, we identify the strong-coupling
regime required to recover the experimental energy-loss profile. This regime
suppresses the elastic peak, implying additional site-specific scattering
channels in the observed elastic peak. Deuterium substitution further produces
a subtle shift in the energy-loss peak, consistent with experiment. These
results establish HEOM as a rigorous framework for quantum surface scattering,
capable of capturing nonadiabatic dynamics beyond electronic friction and
perturbative approaches.

Outer sphere electron transfer rates can be calculated from simulation data
by sampling the equilibrium statistics of the canonical reaction coordinate --
the vertical energy gap. For these calculations, electron transfer is typically
represented by an instantaneous change in the atomic partial charges. In this
manuscript, we present an implementation of this procedure that utilizes an
explicit path-integral representation of the transferring electron. We
demonstrate our methodology by combining path integral molecular dynamics and
Marcus-Hush-Chidsey theory to calculate the rate of electron transfer from a
Ferrocyanide complex to a gold electrode. We consider the dependence of this
rate on electron transfer distance and applied potential. We find that when the
electron is represented explicitly via path integral molecular dynamics, as
opposed to implicitly via fixed atomic partial charges, the rates and
thermodynamics are more consistent with experimental findings. We then apply
our methodology to explore the role of bridging spectator cations in modifying
electron transfer rates. We find, once again, that the path integral approach
produces specific cation effects that are more consistent with experiment than
those in which the transferring electron is represented implicitly.

Vanadium dioxide (VO$_2$) is central in the study of ultrafast photoinduced
insulator-to-metal phase transitions in strongly correlated materials, and a
primary candidate for next-generation light-driven devices. However, the
physical mechanism underlying its phase transition remains unresolved. Here, we
use single-cycle light transients to perform phase-resolved ultrafast
spectroscopy on VO$_2$ crystals. Our experiments reveal two processes: a
structural transformation from the insulating monoclinic M1-VO$_2$ phase to the
excited metallic rutile R*-VO$_2$ phase, followed by electron thermalization
and relaxation dynamics intrinsic to the newly formed excited metallic phase.

Thermoelectric materials offer a promising route for efficient heat-to-power
conversion. In search of materials functional at high and low operating
temperatures, we investigate the thermoelectric properties of two-dimensional
lead halide Janus layers (JLs) using density functional theory. The
electronegativity difference between halides in JLs significantly modulates the
electronic structure, particularly the strong Pb-F bonding in PbIF JLs leads to
pronounced band curvature and a unique direct bandgap. Estimated through
three-phonon interactions, the lattice thermal conductivity is intrinsically
low, primarily due to acoustic phonon contributions and suppressed optical
phonon transport. The thermoelectric coefficients are enhanced with carrier
doping, resulting in figures of merit as high as 8.94 at room temperature and
upto 36.31 at elevated temperatures. These findings establish two-dimensional
lead halide Janus layers as exceptional candidates for thermoelectric
conversion, and the insights into their elemental and electronic
characteristics offer a valuable basis for the future design of
high-performance lead-based thermoelectric materials.

### The van der Waals Gap: a Hidden Showstopper in Semiconductor Device Scaling

Continued miniaturization of transistors is critical for sustaining advances
in computing performance, energy efficiency, and integration density. A central
nanoscale challenge is controlling gate leakage through ultrathin dielectrics.
In evaluating candidate insulators, permittivity and bandgap are often
emphasized; however, interfaces between two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors and
gate dielectrics typically form a van der Waals (vdW) gap whose electronic
properties are underappreciated. Using first-principles calculations and
analytical modeling supported by experiment, we find typical vdW gaps of about
1.4 \AA{} with an effective dielectric constant near 2, which adds roughly 2.7
\AA{} to the equivalent oxide thickness (EOT). The vdW gap serves as an
additional tunneling barrier that can reduce gate leakage by one to two orders
of magnitude, but it also introduces parasitic capacitance that can offset the
benefits of high-k dielectrics. We introduce a dimensionless figure of merit
that combines dielectric screening, tunneling suppression, and
thickness-dependent permittivity of ultrathin oxides to predict the minimum
achievable EOT for a target gate-leakage current in the presence of a vdW gap.
Although some materials may benefit from vdW gaps, our results indicate they
often impose severe constraints on further scaling. In particular, due to the
vdW gap, most currently considered insulators are unlikely to scale to an EOT
of 5 \AA{} as targeted by the IRDS roadmap for future nodes. As a potential
alternative, we examine ``zippered'' structures in which quasi-covalent bonding

- **TL;DR**: 使用快速流动液体平流射流和红外光谱成像技术，在D2O和H2O液-液界面直接测量了反应前100微秒内HDO的形成过程，发现HDO形成速率受氢氧根和氢离子可用性限制而非简单扩散限制。

The exchange of protons and deuterons is a very fast process, even on
macroscopic length scales. Here we directly measure quantitatively the
formation of HDO within the first 100 microseconds of the reaction at the
liquid-liquid interface between D$_2$O and H$_2$O using a fast-flowing liquid
flat jet and infrared spectroscopic imaging. During early stages of the
reaction, the rate of HDO formation is limited by the availability of hydroxide
and hydronium ions mediating the reaction, rather than simply by diffusion.
This reveals a non-equilibrium state of the interface, being fully mixed
diffusely yet with HDO concentrations well below equilibrium. We extract the
reaction rate constant for the HDO formation in good agreement with picosecond
timescales of the elementary proton-deuteron exchange reaction. Quantitative
analysis of educt and product concentrations by infrared imaging at
well-defined liquid-liquid interfaces as introduced here will enable studying
fast kinetics for a wide range of chemical reactions.

A fundamental challenge in quantum many-body physics is to understand the
universal properties of strongly correlated systems. In this work, we establish
a universal and exact identity from the Dyson-Schwinger equations within the
Keldysh-Schwinger field theory for systems with generic bilinear interactions.
Our derivation demonstrates the emergence of composite particles as "elementary
excitations", whose Green's functions definitively determine the original
single-particle Green's function. This universal relation uniquely identifies
the composite particles governing correlations and rigorously connects their
spectra to the observable single-particle spectrum. Thus, our exact identity
reveals a new pathway toward a paradigm for understanding many-body correlated
systems.

- **TL;DR**: 本文研究了非中心对称四方反铁磁体CuB2O4中光致发光（PL）的非互易性现象，该效应在尼尔相变温度以下达到80%，并通过量子力学分析证实了磁偶极子和电偶极子跃迁的干涉机制。

Nonreciprocity of light emission, when the radiation intensity differs for
two opposite propagation directions, is a rare phenomenon in solids because it
requires a violation of the crystal symmetry with respect to time-reversal.
Such violation via time-reversal symmetry breaking can occur either due to an
applied magnetic field or due to a magnetic ordering. We perform a detailed
theoretical and experimental study of the photoluminescence (PL) nonreciprocity
in the noncentrosymmetric tetragonal antiferromagnet CuB$_2$O$_4$, where this
effect reaches 80\% below the N\'eel phase transition temperature of $T_N =
20$~K. The effect is observed for three sets of extremely narrow exciton and
exciton-magnon PL lines, associated with Frenkel excitons on the Cu$^{2+}$ ions
in the magnetic $4b$ subsystem. A strong manifestation of the nonreciprocity of
emission is found in certain geometries for the commensurate antiferromagnetic
phase, as well as in other phases with incommensurate spin ordering. In
accordance with the magnetic symmetry of CuB$_2$O$_4$, the nonreciprocity of
emission is observed for light propagation along certain directions within the
easy (001) plane. A rigorous quantum-mechanical analysis of the wave functions
of the initial and final states of the Cu$^{2+}$ ions responsible for the PL is
performed for various experimental geometries of the crystallographic axes and
the applied magnetic field. The analysis confirms that the nonreciprocity of
emission from Frenkel excitons in CuB$_2$O$_4$ is due to the interference of
magnetic-dipole and electric-dipole transitions of antiferromagnetically
ordered $4b$ spins of the Cu$^{2+}$ ions, in good agreement with the
experimental data.

### Breaking of Time-Reversal Symmetry and Onsager Reciprocity in Chiral Molecule Interfacd with an Environment

- **TL;DR**: 该论文展示了手性分子与电子库耦合时，其自旋构型会被对映选择性地锁定，这为手性诱导自旋选择性效应提供了理论基础。

Molecular closed shell structures are known to form spin-singlet
configurations, resulting from the spin-exchange associated with
electron-electron interactions. While the vanishing total spin-moment is an
immanent property of the spin-singlet, the vanishing local moments is a result
of fluctuations between degenerate spin-configurations. Here, it is
demonstrated that the spin-configuration of a chiral molecule is
enantiospecifically locked when coupled to an electron reservoir. The coupling
opens up the molecular closed shell structure, which broadens the energy
levels. Together with the molecular spin-orbit coupling, this dissipative
coupling generates an effective spin-splitting of the molecular energy levels
and facilitates stabilization of a chirality determined spin-configuration.
Simultaneously, the charge molecular charge distribution is shown to depend
linearly on the magnetization of the reservoir such that no linear response
regime is established with respect to the external magnetization. Accordingly,
the Onsager reciprocity theorem does not apply to a chiral molecule attached to
a reservoir, hence, providing a theoretical foundation for the chirality
induced spin selectivity effect.

### MesoNet: A Fundamental Principle for Multi-Representation Learning in Complex Chemical Systems

- **TL;DR**: MesoNet是一个基于多表示学习的新型框架，专门用于多分子建模，通过神经电路策略构建上下文感知表示，在复杂化学系统中实现分子属性的准确预测。

Accurate prediction of molecular properties in complex chemical systems is
crucial for accelerating material discovery and chemical
innovation.However,current computational methods often struggle to capture the
intricate compositional interplay across complex chemical systems,from
intramolecular bonds to intermolecular forces.In this work,we introduce
MesoNet,a novel framework founded on the principle of multi-representation
learning and specifically designed for multi-molecule modeling.The core
innovation of MesoNet lies in the construction of context-aware
representation-dynamically enriched atomic descriptors generated via Neural
Circuit Policies. These parameters efficiently capture both intrinsic atomic
properties and their dynamic compositional context through a cross-attention
mechanism spanning both intramolecular and intermolecular message passing.
Driven by this mechanism,the influence of the mixed system is progressively
applied to each molecule and atom, making message passing both efficient and
meaningful.Comprehensive evaluations across diverse public datasets, spanning
both pure components and mixtures,demonstrate that MesoNet achieves superior
accuracy and enhanced chemical interpretability for molecular properties.This
work establishes a powerful,interpretable approach for modeling compositional
complexity,aiming to advance chemical simulation and design.

- **TL;DR**: 本文开发了高分辨率价带共振非弹性X射线散射（VB-RIXS）技术，用于研究铀氧化物UO₂的5f电子结构，实现了50-90meV的能量分辨率，能够解析多重激发、晶体场效应和电荷转移特征。

Understanding the electronic structure of actinide materials is crucial for
both fundamental research and nuclear applications. The partially filled 5f
shells exhibit complex behavior due to strong correlations and ligand
hybridization, requiring advanced spectroscopic techniques. Here, we report on
the development and application of high-resolution valence-band resonant
inelastic x-ray spectroscopy (VB-RIXS) experiments at the uranium M$_{4,5}$
edges (3551 and 3725\,eV). We present data of UO$_2$, a well-established model
actinide compound. VB-RIXS is particularly well suited for probing the 5f-shell
electronic structure, as it probes, in contrast to core-to-core RIXS,
excitations without leaving a high-energy core hole in the final state. In
VB-RIXS, we achieve energy resolutions of 50\,meV (M$_5$) and 90\,meV (M$_4$),
enabling the resolution of multiplet excitations and crystal-field effects, as
well as charge-transfer and fluorescence-like features with unprecedented
clarity. As such, high resolution VB-RIXS offers direct insights into both
low-energy, near ground-state properties and high-energy hybridization and
covalency effects. Our results demonstrate the power of VB-RIXS as a versatile
and powerful tool for probing the strongly correlated electronic structure of
actinide materials, providing essential input for quantitative modeling and the
validation of theoretical concepts.

- **TL;DR**: 通过铁助熔剂法在大气压下成功生长出高质量菱方氮化硼晶体，该晶体具有三角块状结构，主要为菱方相，质量优异。

We report the growth of high quality rhombohedral boron nitride (rBN)
crystals by the iron flux method at atmospheric pressure. In contrast to the
lamellar structure of standard hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) covering the metal
ingot, the current synthetized BN shell is composed of many triangular bulk
crystallites, of submillimeter size, predominantly in the rhombohedral phase,
with only weak traces of hBN detected by high resolution X-ray diffraction. The
low-temperature photoluminescence emission confirms the excellent quality of
the rhombohedral stacking with unprecedented width for all phonon replicas at
the band edge. The Raman spectra are characterized by the absence of any
low-energy modes at $\sim50$ cm$^{-1}$, the presence of an extended band around
$800$ cm$^{-1}$ and an asymmetric high energy mode at $1366$ cm$^{-1}$. These
observations are in very good agreement with the phonon dispersion calculated
for the rhombohedral primitive cell with $C_{3v}$ symmetry.

### Electronic structure and optical signatures of highly-doped graphene

- **TL;DR**: 该论文研究了通过插层重掺杂石墨烯的电子结构变化，包括费米能级提升、范霍夫奇点形成、能带折叠等效应，并建立了有效的紧束缚模型来预测光学电导率的特征信号。

Heavily doping graphene by intercalation can raise its Fermi level near an
extended van Hove singularity, potentially inducing correlated electronic
phases. Intercalation also modifies the band structure: dopants may hybridize
with carbon orbitals and order into $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ or $2\times2$
superstructures, introducing periodic potentials that fold the graphene $\pi$
bands. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy further shows a pronounced
flattening of the conduction band near the M points, producing higher-order van
Hove singularities. These effects depend strongly on the dopant species and
substrate, with implications for both many-body physics and transport. We
construct effective tight-binding models that incorporate dopant ordering,
carbon-dopant hybridization, and $\pi$-band renormalization. Model parameters
are obtained from density functional theory and reproduce dispersions observed
in photoemission experiments. Using these models, we compute the optical
conductivity and identify characteristic signatures associated with dopant
ordering and hybridization. Our results provide a framework to interpret
experimental spectra and to probe the superlattice symmetry of highly doped
monolayer graphene.

### Nuclear-electronic orbital second-order coupled cluster for excited states

- **TL;DR**: 本文介绍了核-电子轨道框架下的激发态方法NEO-CC2及其变体NEO-SOS'-CC2，这些方法能够以接近计算密集型方法的精度描述单激发和混合质子-电子激发。

Excited-state methods within the nuclear--electronic orbital (NEO) framework
have the potential to capture vibrational, electronic, and vibronic transitions
in a single calculation. In the NEO approach, specified nuclei, typically
protons, are treated quantum mechanically at the same level of theory as the
electrons. Affordable excited-state NEO methods such as time-dependent density
functional theory are limited to capturing the subset of excitations with
single-excitation character, whereas existing methods that capture the full
spectrum are limited in applicability due to their high computational cost.
Herein, we introduce the excited-state variant of NEO coupled cluster with
approximate second-order doubles (NEO-CC2) and its scaled-opposite-spin variant
with electron-proton correlation scaling (NEO-SOS'-CC2). We benchmark this
method for positronium hydride, where the electrons and positron are treated
quantum mechanically, and find that NEO-CC2 deviates from exact results, but
NEO-SOS'-CC2 can achieve near-quantitative accuracy by increasing the
electron-positron correlation. Benchmarking NEO-CC2 and NEO-SOS'-CC2 on four
different triatomic molecules with a quantum proton, we find that NEO-CC2
captures the correct vibrational features such as overtones and combination
bands, as well as mixed electron-proton double excitations. Electron-proton
correlation scaling that increases the excited-state correlation relative to
the ground-state correlation improves the accuracy across all the molecular
systems tested. NEO-SOS'-CC2 can describe single and mixed protonic and
electronic excitations with accuracy approaching that of much more
computationally intensive methods.

Terbium and thulium thin films were produced by Molecular Plating under
controlled conditions to elucidate a possible influence of water and carbon
dioxide present in the plating solution. Platings were made in a glovebox with
variable concentration of residual water and \ce{CO2} in a controlled inert
atmosphere to study the impact on the quality of the produced thin films and on
deposition yields. The morphology of the thin films was analyzed by scanning
electron microscopy. The deposition yield was determined by neutron activation
analysis at the research reactor TRIGA Mainz. Chemical analysis of the
deposited layers was conducted using a combination of infrared, Raman and X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy. The Raman and IR spectra reveal the formation of
hydroxides, oxides and carbonates. Water in the plating solution affects the
quality of the thin films when its concentration exceeds 1 vol.-\%. The
presence of \ce{CO2} leads to an increased carbonate content, which negatively
influences the film quality

- **TL;DR**: 本文提出了DiffSyn，一种基于扩散模型的生成方法，用于为特定沸石结构生成可能的合成路线，解决了晶体材料合成中的高维空间和复杂结构-合成关系问题。

The synthesis of crystalline materials, such as zeolites, remains a
significant challenge due to a high-dimensional synthesis space, intricate
structure-synthesis relationships and time-consuming experiments. Considering
the one-to-many relationship between structure and synthesis, we propose
$\texttt{DiffSyn}$, a generative diffusion model trained on over 23,000
synthesis recipes spanning 50 years of literature. $\texttt{DiffSyn}$ generates
probable synthesis routes conditioned on a desired zeolite structure and an
organic template. $\texttt{DiffSyn}$ achieves state-of-the-art performance by
capturing the multi-modal nature of structure-synthesis relationships. We apply
$\texttt{DiffSyn}$ to differentiate among competing phases and generate optimal
synthesis routes. As a proof of concept, we synthesize a UFI material using
$\texttt{DiffSyn}$-generated synthesis routes. These routes, rationalized by
density functional theory binding energies, resulted in the successful
synthesis of a UFI material with a high Si/Al$_{\text{ICP}}$ of 19.0, which is
expected to improve thermal stability and is higher than that of any previously
recorded.

Electric and magnetic multipole densities in crystalline solids, including
the familiar electric dipole density in ferroelectrics and the magnetic dipole
density in ferromagnets, are of central importance for our understanding of
ordered phases in matter. However, determining the magnitude of these
quantities has proven to be conceptually and technically difficult. Here we
present a universally applicable approach, based on projection operators, that
yields gauge-invariant absolute measures for all types of electric and magnetic
order in crystals. We demonstrate the utility of the general theory using
concrete examples of electric and magnetic multipole order in variants of
lonsdaleite and diamond structures. Besides the magnetic dipole density in
ferromagnets, we also consider, e.g., the magnetic octupole density in
altermagnets. The robust method developed in this work lends itself to be
incorporated into the suite of computational materials-science tools. The
multipole densities can be used as thermodynamic state variables including
Landau order parameters.

- **TL;DR**: 通过掺杂硼和碳等间隙溶质来保护晶界等关键晶体缺陷，防止氢脆，从而提高马氏体钢的抗氢脆性能。

Enabling a hydrogen economy requires the development of materials resistant
to hydrogen embrittlement (HE). More than 100 years of research have led to
several mechanisms and models describing how hydrogen interacts with lattice
defects and leads to mechanical property degradation. However, solutions to
protect materials from hydrogen are still scarce. Here, we investigate the role
of interstitial solutes in protecting critical crystalline defects sensitive to
hydrogen. Ab initio calculations show that boron and carbon in solid solutions
at grain boundaries can efficiently prevent hydrogen segregation. We then
realized this interface protection concept on martensitic steel, a material
strongly prone to HE, by doping the most sensitive interfaces with different
concentrations of boron and carbon. This segregation, in addition to stress
relaxations, critically reduced the hydrogen ingress by half, leading to an
unprecedented resistance against HE. This tailored interstitial segregation
strategy can be extended to other metallic materials susceptible to
hydrogen-induced interfacial failure

We introduce a nanocalorimetric technique based on microsecond-pulsed heating
(\mu s-PHnC) that enables high-sensitivity, quasi-isothermal heat capacity
measurements on nanoscale samples. Such resolution is critical for exploring
thermodynamic signatures in low-dimensional materials, where conventional
techniques fall short. By confining thermal excitation to microsecond
timescales, this approach minimizes lateral heat diffusion, reduces heat
capacity addenda to below 10^{-9} J K^{-1}, and achieves noise densities as low
as 75 pJ K^{-1} Hz^{-1/2} mm^{-2}, unlocking precise thermodynamic
characterization of subnanogram samples in areas as small as 30 x 30 \mu m^{2}.
The method delivers exceptional temperature homogeneity, as demonstrated by
resolving sharp phase transitions, such as the antiferromagnetic transition in
ultrathin CoO films, with unprecedented clarity. Its quasi-static operation is
inherently compatible with external stimuli, including magnetic and electric
fields, thereby expanding its utility for in-operando thermodynamic studies.
This advancement establishes a robust and scalable platform for probing thermal
phenomena in nanostructured and low-dimensional materials, significantly
broadening the scope of nanocalorimetry.

Catalysis at solid-liquid interfaces plays a central role in the advancement
of energy storage and sustainable chemical production technologies. By enabling
accurate, long-time scale simulations, machine learning (ML) models have the
potential to accelerate the discovery of (electro)catalysts. While prior Open
Catalyst datasets (OC20 and OC22) have advanced the field by providing
large-scale density functional theory (DFT) data of adsorbates on surfaces at
solid-gas interfaces, they do not capture the critical role of solvent and
electrolyte effects at solid-liquid interfaces. To bridge this gap, we
introduce the Open Catalyst 2025 (OC25) dataset, consisting of 7,801,261
calculations across 1,511,270 unique explicit solvent environments. OC25
constitutes the largest and most diverse solid-liquid interface dataset that is
currently available and provides configurational and elemental diversity:
spanning 88 elements, commonly used solvents/ions, varying solvent layers, and
off-equilibrium sampling. State-of-the-art models trained on the OC25 dataset
exhibit energy, force, and solvation energy errors as low as 0.1 eV, 0.015
eV/\r{A}, and 0.04 eV, respectively; significantly lower than than the recently
released Universal Models for Atoms (UMA-OC20). Additionally, we discuss the
impact of the quality of DFT-calculated forces on model training and
performance. The dataset and accompanying baseline models are made openly
available for the community. We anticipate the dataset to facilitate large
length-scale and long-timescale simulations of catalytic transformations at
solid-liquid interfaces, advancing molecular-level insights into functional
interfaces and enabling the discovery of next-generation energy storage and
conversion technologies.

The rational combination of existing magnetic topological compounds presents
a promising route for designing new topological materials. We report the
synthesis and comprehensive characterization of the layered quaternary
intergrowth compound Eu$_2$CuZn$_2$As$_3$, which combines structural units of
two known magnetic topological materials, EuCuAs and EuZn$_2$As$_2$.
Eu$_2$CuZn$_2$As$_3$ exhibits an antiferromagnetic ground state with successive
magnetic transitions: quasi-two-dimensional ordering at $T_\mathrm{M} =
29.3$\,K, long-range antiferromagnetic ordering at $T_\mathrm{N} = 19$\,K, and
spin-reorientation at $T_\mathrm{SR} = 16.3$\,K. The stepwise magnetic
transitions manifest as plateau-like anomalies in the heat capacity. These
transitions originate from multiple superexchange pathways and periodic
variation of interplane Eu-Eu distances in the intergrowth structure. Charge
transport shows a pronounced resistivity increase above $T_\mathrm{N}$ followed
by minimal change below the ordering temperature. Magnetic fields rapidly
suppress this resistivity rise, yielding significant negative
magnetoresistance. Remarkably, Eu$_2$CuZn$_2$As$_3$ inherits the nonlinear
anomalous Hall effect characteristic of its parent compounds. Energy
evaluations of collinear spin configurations reveal a lowest-energy state with
ferromagnetic coupling between Eu planes in EuCuAs units while maintaining
antiferromagnetic coupling within EuZn$_2$As$_2$ units. The corresponding
electronic structure displays potentially topologically nontrivial features.
Our work demonstrates the efficacy of structural hybridization for discovering
novel magnetic topological materials and establishes a general strategy for

- **TL;DR**: 研究了Co2NbSn全赫斯勒合金的马氏体相变对磁性和热电性能的影响，发现在马氏体相中尽管磁矩较小，但磁子拖曳效应显著增强。

We investigated the magnetic and thermoelectric properties of the full
Heusler alloy Co$_2$NbSn, which exhibits a martensitic transformation at 240 K.
Magnetization measurements reveal weak itinerant ferromagnetism in the
martensitic phase, which is well described by Takahashi's spin fluctuation
theory. The characteristic spin fluctuation parameters were estimated to be T_0
= 1.0$\times$10^3 K and T_A = 7.2$\times$10^3 K. Seebeck coefficient
measurements under magnetic fields up to 9 T show complex temperature and field
dependence, which we decomposed into electron diffusion, spin fluctuation drag,
and magnon drag components. A significant magnon-drag contribution was
identified in both austenite and martensitic phases. Remarkably, this
contribution is strongly enhanced in the martensitic phase compared to the
austenite phase, despite a smaller magnetic moment. These findings provide
evidence for robust low-energy spin excitations and highlight the potential of
martensitic transformation in enhancing the thermoelectric performance of
itinerant ferromagnetic alloys.

Structural changes induced by chemical reactions critically determine the
catalytic performance and mechanism. However, precise tracking of the
three-dimensional (3D) atomic structural evolution of individual bimetallic
nanocatalysts remains challenging. Here we develop four-dimensional
electrocatalytic atomic-resolution electron tomography, a method for directly
tracking 3D atomic rearrangements in identical nanoparticles by
electrocatalytic reactions. Using Pd-Pt bimetallic nanoparticles as a model
system, we capture the atomic evolution of single nanocatalysts throughout
electrocatalytic cycles. We observe two stages of evolutions: surface
reconstruction and atom leaching, which are corroborated with the
voltage-dependent behaviors probed by in situ electrochemical transmission
electron microscopy. We identify chemical short-range order at atomic level and
further reveal anisotropic chemical redistributions across different
crystallographic orientations. These findings highlight the necessity of
incorporating 3D spatiotemporal and chemical evolutions into the rational
design of functional nanocatalysts in the future.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究通过Ti掺杂在La2CoIr1-xTixO6双钙钛矿中引入化学压力，系统研究了磁性和电子性质随掺杂浓度的演化。结果表明，随着Ti含量增加，体系从铁磁态逐渐转变为反铁磁态，同时绝缘带隙增大，磁性相互作用被抑制。

The La$_2$CoIr$_{1-x}$Ti$_x$O$_6$ double perovskite series serves as an
effective platform for investigating the evolution of magnetic and electronic
properties as a function of chemical pressure (doping) or hydrostatic pressure
due to the interplay between the electrons correlation and spin-orbit coupling.
In this study, the substitution of nonmagnetic Ti$^{4+}$ at the magnetic
Ir$^{4+}$-site leads to a systematic decrease in unit cell volume keeping the
monoclinic symmetry throughout, reflecting the effect of chemical pressure
along with a gradual suppression of magnetic interactions. The parent compound
($x =$ 0) exhibits a ferromagnetic-like state with a Curie temperature of 92 K,
which continuously evolves into an antiferromagnetic ground state upon full Ti
substitution ($x =$ 1) with a Neel temperature of 14.6 K. Isothermal
magnetization measurements reveal a hysteresis behavior with step-like feature
at zero field, indicative of a noncollinear magnetic ordering. Additionally,
the enhancement of magnetization under hydrostatic pressure on La$_2$CoIrO$_6$
suggests the presence of piezomagnetic behavior. Thermal expansion measurements
on La$_2$CoIrO$_6$ highlight a coupling between spin and lattice degrees of
freedom. The pressure dependence of the transition temperature in the
zero-pressure limit, calculated using Ehrenfest's relation, shows good
agreement with magnetization data under applied pressure.First-principles
density functional theory (DFT) calculations preformed for $x =$ 0, 0.5 and 1,
further reveal that strong SOC associated with Ir plays a decisive role in
shaping the electronic band structure, with the insulating gap progressively
widening as Ti content increases from 0.28 eV ($x =$ 0), 0.44 eV ($x =$ 0.5),
and 1.01 eV ($x =$ 1). The magnetic moment decreased more than 50\% for $x =$
0.5, showing the decrease in magnetic exchange pathways.

### Predicting the Curie Temperature of Magnetic Materials with Machine Learning: Descriptor Engineering, Graph Neural Networks, and the Role of Curated Data

Predicting the Curie temperature ($T_\mathrm{C}$) of magnetic materials is
crucial for advancing applications in data storage, spintronics, and sensors.
We present a machine learning (ML) framework to predict $T_{\mathrm{C}}$ using
a curated dataset of 2,500 ferromagnetic compounds, employing two types of
elemental descriptor-based features: one based on stoichiometry-weighted
descriptors, and the other leveraging Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). CatBoost
trained on the stoichiometry-weighted descriptors achieved an $R^2$ score of
0.87, while the use of GNN-based representations led to a further improvement,
with CatBoost reaching an $R^2$ of 0.91, highlighting the effectiveness of
graph-based feature learning. We also demonstrated that using an uncurated
dataset available online leads to poor predictions, resulting in a low $R^2$
score of 0.66 for the CatBoost model. We analyzed feature importance using
tools such as Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), which revealed that
ionization energies are a key physicochemical factor influencing
$T_\mathrm{C}$. Notably, the use of only the first 10 ionization energies as
input features resulted in high predictive accuracy, with $R^2$ scores of up to
0.85 for statistical models and 0.89 for the GNN-based approach. These results
highlight that combining robust ML models with thoughtful feature engineering
and high-quality data, can accelerate the discovery of magnetic materials. Our
curated dataset is publicly available on GitHub.

### Delta-Doped Diamond via in-situ Plasma-Distance Control

- **TL;DR**: 本文提出了一种CVD生长金刚石的新方法，通过控制样品与等离子体的距离发现了两种新的生长机制，可用于制造不同氮掺杂浓度的薄膜，适用于量子传感和量子计算应用。

We present an approach for the CVD growth of diamond, where the sample is
placed in a defined distance from the reactor baseplate, to which the plasma
couples. We observe two previously unknown growth regimes. In the first case,
the sample is positioned within three to five millimeters of the plasma,
leading to a decreased growth rate, compared to a position inside the plasma
and, additionally, to an increased nitrogen incorporation, allowing the
fabrication of delta-doped layers with a thickness below 30 nm. In another
regime, where the sample is more than 10 mm away from the plasma, no growth is
observed. Instead, we assume a deposition of nitrogen-rich species on the
diamond surface, which is incorporated during the growth of the following
layer. All fabricated layers show NV emission, where the intensity correlates
with the nitrogen incorporation. The growth techniques could allow the
fabrication of highly doped thin films for quantum sensing applications, as
well as layers with low NV concentration, for quantum computing. The new
approaches are applicable not only for nitrogen incorporation but also for
other defects, for example, phosphorus, which could open up new avenues for
diamond-based electronics.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种用于获取单晶X射线总散射数据集的方法，该数据集能够捕获布拉格峰和漫散射强度，并在绝对尺度上进行测量。

We present a measurement protocol and a data reduction workflow for obtaining
single-crystal X-ray total-scattering datasets that capture both Bragg-peak and
diffuse scattering intensities on an absolute (electrons2/atom) scale. We
further demonstrate that the intensity scale factor derived from
crystallographic refinements using Bragg peaks is in close agreement with that
obtained by matching the scattering function, computed via spherical
integration of the 3D total scattering signal, to the theoretical coherent
baseline, calculated as the spherical average of the Debye-Waller factor. The
latter approach can be applied to diffuse scattering without including Bragg
peaks. Our results set the ground for structural refinements using large atomic
configurations while simultaneously fitting Bragg intensities and diffuse
scattering from a single crystal. Moreover, with the convergence between the
two scaling methods, the Bragg and diffuse components can be obtained from the
same total-scattering dataset, as achieved in this work, or measured
independently.

Nitroaromatic compounds (NACs) are used in various industrial applications
including dyes, inks, herbicides, pharmaceuticals, and explosives. Due to their
toxicity and environmental persistence, reliable detection and monitoring
methods are required. Hybrid organic--inorganic structures have shown potential
for NAC sensing; however, their complex synthesis, high processing costs, and
limited reproducibility hinder practical implementation, highlighting the need
for simpler and more accessible materials. In this study, we employed density
functional theory (DFT)-based calculations to evaluate the electronic, optical,
and reactive properties of two melanin-based oligomeric systems, aiming to
assess their potential use as NAC detectors. Our results indicate the potential
of these materials to detect a series of nitroaromatic compounds such as
2,4-DNP, 2,4-DNT, 2,6-DNT, TNP, and TNT by electrical and infrared optical
measurements. Born--Oppenheimer molecular dynamics (BOMD) simulations reveal
the thermal stability of the adsorption process, confirming effective
substrate--analyte interaction under different temperature conditions. To the
best of our knowledge, this compound has not been proposed for sensing
applications. Its low cost and facile synthesis make it a promising candidate
for the development of environmentally friendly organic NAC sensors.

### Spin-Seebeck Signatures of Spin Chirality in Kagome Antiferromagnets

- **TL;DR**: 本文通过自旋塞贝克效应探测kagome非共线反铁磁体的基态矢量自旋手性，发现负手性态会产生显著的面内自旋电流，为手性开关检测提供直接信号。

Non-collinear antiferromagnets (NCAFMs) are appealing for antiferromagnetic
spintronics, as they combine the advantages of collinear antiferromagnets with
novel emergent phenomena stemming from their complex spin structures. These
phenomena are often associated with the intrinsic spin chirality, which
characterizes the handedness of the ground-state spin configuration. Here, we
investigate a kagome NCAFM interfaced with a normal metal and demonstrate that
the ground-state vector spin chirality can be probed through measurements of
the spin Seebeck effect (SSE). Starting from a microscopic spin Hamiltonian, we
derive the corresponding bosonic Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonians for the two
chiral configurations. Using linear response theory, we obtain a general
expression for the spin current thermally pumped into the normal metal by the
SSE. We show that a sizable in-plane spin current emerges exclusively in the
negative-chiral state, providing a direct signature for real-time detection of
chirality switching in kagome NCAFMs. In addition, we find a field-dependent
out-of-plane spin current whose magnitude differs between the two chiralities
by about 4%, reflecting their distinct magnon band structures.

### Characterizing the Structure of 3D DNA Origami in a Transmission Electron Microscope

DNA origami nanostructures provide programmable control over nanoscale
geometry but remain challenging to image due to their low atomic number. Here,
we systematically evaluate imaging strategies for both stained and unstained
DNA origami deposited on carbon-coated TEM grids. Using Weber contrast as a
quantitative metric, we compared different operating modes of (scanning)
transmission electron microscopy, (S)TEM, in order to find optimum imaging
conditions. STEM was consistently found to deliver the highest contrast, with
optimal performance at a camera length of 600 mm towards the high angle annular
dark field (HAADF) detector. As expected, the contrast was higher for the
thicker three-dimensional nanotubes as compared to DNA 6-helix bundles (6HBs)
due to the larger projected thickness of the former. The contrast was
effectively enhanced by heavy metal staining with uranyl formate. Notably, 3D
molds preserved their designated dimensions upon staining and also largely
retained their structural integrity upon complexation with palladium, which
also improved the visibility of the structures. These results establish STEM as
the optimal approach for high-contrast imaging of DNA origami even of unstained
samples and provide practical guidelines for sample preparation and imaging
conditions that promote reliable structural visualization.

### Role of Oxygen during Methane Oxidation on Pd$_1$/PdO$_1$@CeO$_2$ Surface: A Combined Density Functional Theory, Microkinetic, and Machine Learning Approach

- **TL;DR**: 本研究探讨了氧在工业甲烷氧化中的作用，通过DFT计算和微动力学模拟揭示了Pd/CeO₂催化剂中氧对甲烷氧化反应机制的影响。

This work explores the role of oxygen in industrial methane oxidation.
Oxygen, a well-known oxidizing agent, drives CH$_4$ conversion to CO$_2$ and
H$_2$O. We report how oxygen influences oxidation on single Pd and PdO clusters
supported on CeO$_2$(111). Oxygen is introduced by (1) lattice O in PdO and (2)
O$_2$ adsorption on an isolated Pd atom, forming PdO$_x$ clusters.
Density-functional theory (DFT) mapped multiple reaction pathways on the
Pd$_1$/PdO$_1$@CeO$_2$(111) surface; both Pd and PdO clusters were found to
thermodynamically favour methane activation. The computed barrier for CH$_4$
activation is 0.63 eV on PdO$_1$@CeO$_2$(111). A single Pd atom markedly
accelerates O$_2$ dissociation to PdO$_2$, and the presence of lattice oxygen
lowers this barrier by 0.36 eV relative to an oxygen-deficient surface,
enhancing catalytic efficiency. Reaction selectivity, coverage-dependent
production rates, degree of rate control (DRC), and intrinsic turnover
frequency (TOF) were quantified through steady-state microkinetic modelling.
The simulations predict full conversion of CH$_4$ to CO$_2$ and H$_2$O above
600 K, whereas partial-oxidation intermediates dominate at lower temperature
and high O coverage. Rate constants for all elementary steps were derived via
the Sure Independence Screening and Sparsifying Operator (SISSO)
symbolic-regression method, yielding a concise predictive expression based on
charge, coordination number, and key Pd-O/C-H distances. These combined
DFT-microkinetic-SISSO results clarify oxygen's mechanistic participation and
provide practical guidelines for designing Pd/CeO$_2$ catalysts with improved
activity toward methane oxidation, a reaction of pressing environmental and
industrial importance.

Copper is a highly promising catalyst for the electrochemical CO$_2$
reduction reaction (CO2RR) since it is the only pure metal that can form highly
added-value products such as ethylene and ethanol. Since the CO2RR takes place
in aqueous solution, the detailed atomic structure of the water-copper
interface is essential for unraveling the key reaction mechanisms. In this
study, we investigate copper-water interfaces exhibiting nanometer-scale
roughnesses. We introduce two molecular dynamics protocols to create rough
copper surfaces, which are subsequently brought into contact with water. From
these interfaces, we sample additional training configurations from
machine-learning-interatomic-potential-driven molecular dynamics simulations
containing hundreds of thousands of atoms. An active learning workflow is
developed to identify regions with high spatially resolved uncertainty and
convert them into DFT-feasible cells through a modified amorphous matrix
embedding approach. Finally, we analyze the local environments at the interface
using unsupervised machine-learning techniques. Unique environments emerge on
the rough copper surfaces absent from model systems, including
stacking-fault-induced configurations and undercoordinated corner atoms.
Notably, corner atoms consistently feature chemisorbed water molecules in our
simulations, indicating their potential importance in catalytic processes.

This study presents a machine learning approach to predict the Curie
temperature in binary alloys, specifically focusing on the Fe-Pt, Fe-Ni, Fe-Pd,
and Co-Pt compounds within a concentration range of 10 to 90 atomic percent.
The optimal mathematical algorithm for this task is the Voting Ensemble
algorithm, which combines the predictions from multiple individual models to
produce a final prediction. The results are validated against classical methods
for calculating Curie temperatures. The experimental findings indicate that
factors such as external pressure, atomic ordering, and alloy composition have
a significant influence on the Curie temperatures in all examined binary
systems. These factors can be leveraged to design alloys with specific Curie
temperatures. Moreover, the proposed features, feature analysis algorithms, and
computational methods pave the way for advancements across various materials,
including ternary alloys, bulk materials, and nanomaterials, inspiring
innovation in the field.

We demonstrate atomic-scale mapping of local magnetic moments and doping
effects in Ti-doped barium hexaferrite (BaFe11TiO19) using atom-sized electron
vortex beams (EVBs) with controlled orbital angular momentum (OAM) in a
scanning transmission electron microscope. By measuring electron energy loss
magnetic circular dichroism (EMCD) at the Fe-L2,3 edges, we directly resolve
the spatial distribution of antiparallel-aligned magnetic sublattices and
quantify the impact of non-magnetic Ti4+ substitution. The EMCD signal,
detected from single atomic Fe columns, reveals a marked reduction and sign
reversal in the magnetic moment at Ti-rich 4f2 sites, corroborated by inelastic
scattering simulations and density functional theory calculations that indicate
induced Fe2+ formation and modified exchange interactions. Our results show
that EVBs enable direct, element-specific, and atomically resolved magnetic
characterization, opening new avenues for investigating local magnetic
phenomena and dopant effects in nano-structured magnetic materials, such as
those used in spintronic devices. This method paves the way for detailed
studies of complex spin textures, magnetic interfaces, and dynamic processes at
the atomic scale.

### MIM-Diode-Like Rectification in Lateral 1T/1H/1T-MoS$_2$ Homojunctions via Interfacial Dipole Engineering

- **TL;DR**: 该论文提出了一种基于MoS2单层材料的横向隧道二极管，通过相工程在单一材料中实现金属-绝缘体-金属（MIM）二极管整流效应，无需使用异质接触。

Lateral two-dimensional (2D) tunnel diodes that reproduce
metal-insulator-metal (MIM)-diode-like rectification without using dissimilar
contacts are attractive for scalable nanoelectronics. MoS$_2$ can exist in both
the semiconducting 1H phase and the metallic 1T phase, enabling
phase-engineered homojunctions within a single material. First-principles
electronic structure and quantum transport calculations show that
phase-engineered 1T/1H/1T--MoS$_2$ homojunctions exhibit pronounced
MIM-diode-like rectification originating from interfacial charge transfer at
asymmetric 1T/1H interfaces. The charge transfer establishes interface dipole
steps that impose a built-in potential drop across the 1H barrier, thereby
generating a trapezoidal tunnel barrier at zero bias. In contrast, symmetric
1T/1H interfaces do not form interface dipoles and show no rectification. To
clarify the microscopic origin, a lateral
graphene/hexagonal-boron-nitride/graphene junction is analyzed as a minimal MIM
diode analogue with a simple interface and well-defined barrier, confirming
that interface-induced dipoles, rather than work-function difference, enable
the effect. The mechanism operates entirely within a single monolayer material
system and does not rely on out-of-plane stacking, highlighting compatibility
with phase patterning in 2D semiconductors. These results establish lateral
1T/1H/1T--MoS$_2$ as a fully 2D, single-material platform for MIM-diode-like
rectification and position interface-dipole engineering as a general strategy
for ultrathin in-plane diodes, high-frequency detectors, and energy-harvesting
tunnel devices.
