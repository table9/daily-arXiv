- **TL;DR**: 本研究探讨了UTe₂超导体中电子轨道自由度和Majorana表面态对磁穿透深度的影响，发现不同配对态下磁穿透深度的温度依赖关系异常，揭示了Majorana表面态在低κ值下的重要作用。

In this study, we examine how the orbital degrees of freedom of electrons and
Majorana surface states influence the magnetic penetration depth in the
superconductor UTe$_2$. We use a model involving two orbital electrons and
consider superconducting states classified into irreducible representations of
the $D_{2h}$ crystal symmetry: $A_{u}$, $B_{1u}$, $B_{2u}$, and $B_{3u}$. We
first show that in bulk nodal superconductors, such as the $B_{2u}$ state, the
magnetic penetration depth for the screening current along the antinodal
direction exhibits a $T^2$ dependence, which significantly deviates from $T^4$
expected from conventional theory. This anomalous exponent is attributed to
quasiparticle contributions around the point nodes to the inter-orbital
paramagnetic current. We then explore the roles of surface states. The fully
gapped $A_{u}$ state hosts Majorana surface states with cone-shaped
dispersions, while Majorana Fermi arcs appear in the other pairing states. We
demonstrate that when the ratio of magnetic penetration depth to coherence
length ($\kappa$) is small, the Majorana cone in the $A_u$ state significantly
contributes to the paramagnetic current, leading to the $T^3$ dependence of the
penetration depth. In the other states hosting Majorana arcs, the penetration
depth exhibits anisotropic power-law behavior, such as $T^2$ ($T^3$) for the
screening current flowing along the dispersive (dispersionless) direction of
Majorana arcs. Therefore, in low-$\kappa$ type-II superconductors, the signals
of Majorana surface states may be detectable through penetration depth
measurements. As $\kappa$ increases and approaches the type-II limit, however,
the impact of Majorana surface states diminishes, and the temperature
dependence is determined by bulk quasiparticle excitations instead of surface
states.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究使用多维相干光谱技术发现，在Bi-2212超导材料中，节点区域的拉曼激发与高能电子激发之间存在反相关性且相干时间超过44飞秒，而反节点区域激发相干时间短且无相关性，这表明节点波动在维持高温超导的量子相干行为中起关键作用。

The physics of strongly correlated materials is deeply rooted in electron
interactions and their coupling to low-energy excitations. Unraveling the
competing and cooperative nature of these interactions is crucial for
connecting microscopic mechanisms to the emergence of exotic macroscopic
behavior, such as high-temperature superconductivity. Here we show that
polarization-resolved multidimensional coherent spectroscopy (MDCS) is able to
selectively drive and measure coherent Raman excitations in different parts of
the Fermi surface, where the superconducting gap vanishes or is the largest
(respectively called Nodal and Antinodal region) in underdoped Bi-2212. Our
evidence reveal that in the superconducting phase, the energy of Raman
excitations in the nodal region is anti-correlated with the energy of
electronic excitations at $\sim$1.6~eV, and both maintain coherence for over
44~fs. In contrast, excitations in the antinodal region show significantly
faster decoherence ($&lt;$18~fs) and no measurable correlations. Importantly, this
long-lived coherence is specific to the superconducting phase and vanishes in
the pseudogap and normal phases. This anti-correlation reveals a coherent link
between the transition energy associated with the many body Cu-O bands and the
energy of electronic Raman modes that map to the near-nodal superconducting
gap. The different coherent dynamics of the nodal and antinodal excitations in
the superconducting phase suggest that nodal fluctuations are protected from
dissipation associated with scattering from antiferromagnetic fluctuations and
may be relevant to sustaining the quantum coherent behaviour associated with
high temperature superconductivity.

- **TL;DR**: 本文提出了一种通过介观超导环中的Little-Parks效应检测手性超导性的新实验方法，利用β-Bi₂Pd材料展示了临界温度随磁场的线性调制特征。

Chiral superconductivity is a novel superconducting phase characterized by
order parameters that break the time-reversal symmetry, endowing the state with
a definite handedness. Unlike conventional superconductors, the Cooper pairs in
a chiral superconductor carry nonzero orbital angular momentum. Through
coupling with an external magnetic field, the finite angular momentum of the
Cooper pair modulates the temperature-magnetic field phase boundary in a
distinctive way, which could serve as an experimental signature of the chiral
superconducting state. Here we demonstrate that the chiral signature can be
detected in mesoscopic superconducting rings of $\beta$-Bi$_2$Pd, manifesting
as a linear-in-field modulation of the critical temperature in the Little-Parks
effect. Our findings establish a new experimental method for detecting the
chiral superconductivity.

Ultrasound attenuation is a powerful probe of symmetry-breaking phenomena in
superconductors. In this work, we develop a framework to model the ultrasound
response of multi-component superconductors undergoing a time-reversal symmetry
breaking transition below the superconducting phase transition. By coupling the
elastic strain of the crystal lattice to the superconducting order parameters
through group-theoretical analysis of tetragonal crystals, we classify how
different symmetry channels contribute to the ultrasound signal. Using a
two-component Ginzburg--Landau theory, we analyze the temperature dependence of
sound velocity across both superconducting and time-reversal symmetry breaking
transitions for several cases, including $(A_{1g}, A_{1g})$, $(A_{2g},
B_{1g})$, and $E_g$ representations. Our results demonstrate that ultrasound
measurements are highly sensitive to the presence of bilinear Josephson
couplings and can distinguish between different realizations of the
superconducting state. We further show how external strain can significantly
alter the ultrasound response in systems breaking time reversal symmetry.

### "Gold-Standard" $Δ$-Machine Learned and Transferable Potential for Linear Alkanes

- **TL;DR**: 本文提出了一种Δ-ML方法来提升线性烷烃的MB-PIP势能面精度，使用PNO-LCCSD(T)-F12能量校正B3LYP和PBE0+MBD势能，获得了目前最准确的线性烷烃势能面。

The conformational properties of linear alkanes, C$_n$H$_{2n+2}$, have been
of intense interest for many years. Experiments and corresponding electronic
structure calculations were first reported in the mid-2000s and continue to the
present time. These focus on the minimum chain length where the transition from
the linear minimum to the hairpin minimum occurs. We recently reported a
transferable many-body permutationally invariant polynomial (MB-PIP) for linear
alkanes using B3LYP electronic energies, which do not account for dispersion.
Here we report a $\Delta$-ML approach to elevate this B3LYP-based and new
PBE0+MBD MB-PIP potentials using PNO-LCCSD(T)-F12 energies. The new
$\Delta$-corrected potentials predict the difference in these minima
accurately, compared to benchmark CCSD(T) results, over the range
C$_{12}$H$_{28}$ to C$_{28}$H$_{58}$. Vibrational power spectra are also
reported for C$_{14}$H$_{30}$ and C$_{30}$H$_{62}$ using the uncorrected and
$\Delta$-ML B3LYP. These new PIP-MB potentials for linear alkanes are the most
accurate ones currently available and can be used in studies of properties of
linear alkanes.

### Origin of pressure-induced anomalies in the nodal-line ferrimagnet Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$

- **TL;DR**: 本文研究了Mn₃Si₂Te₆在压力诱导下的绝缘体-金属转变（IMT）及其对磁性和反常霍尔电导的影响。通过DFT计算和蒙特卡洛模拟，揭示了压力对磁性的演化规律，但发现反常霍尔电导不能仅由内在贡献解释。

A pressure-induced insulator-to-metal transition (IMT) has recently been
discovered in the nodal-line ferrimagnet Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$. The electronic
phase transition is accompanied by anomalies in the magnetic ordering
temperature and the anomalous Hall conductivity, which peak at or near the
critical pressure of the IMT. We perform density functional theory (DFT)
calculations as a function of pressure to reveal the driving factors behind the
IMT and the magnetic anomalies in Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$. We extract Heisenberg
Hamiltonians as a function of pressure based on our DFT calculations. Our
classical Monte Carlo simulations for these Hamiltonians yield ordering
temperatures and magnetic ordering patterns, in agreement with the experimental
data. Although we can accurately explain the evolution of magnetism with
pressure, it seems that the anomalous Hall conductivity in Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$
cannot be accounted for by intrinsic contributions alone.

### Cyclo-Graphyne: A Highly Porous and Semimetallic 2D Carbon Allotrope with Dirac Cones

We present a comprehensive characterization of Cyclo-graphyne (CGY), an
emerging 2D carbon allotrope with a porous structure of sp/sp$^2$-hybridized
carbon atoms. Using density functional theory, we systematically investigate
its structural, energetic, dynamical, thermal, electronic, mechanical, optical,
and vibrational properties. The calculated cohesive and formation energies are
both comparable to those of other synthesized graphynes, confirming its
energetic viability. Phonon dispersion calculations confirm its dynamical
stability, while ab initio molecular dynamics simulations indicate thermal
stability up to at least 1000 K. Electronic results reveal that CGY is a
semimetal with an ultranarrow band gap and features two Dirac cones in its
electronic structure. Mechanically, CGY is highly compliant and isotropic,
exhibiting a Young's modulus an order of magnitude lower than that of graphene.
The optical spectrum reveals strong ultraviolet absorption and infrared
reflectivity with an isotropic response, while the vibrational spectra show
distinct Raman peaks and rich infrared activity. These properties position CGY
as a promising candidate for future applications in areas such as gas capture
and separation, flexible nanoelectronics, and optoelectronics.

In this article, a failure mode dependent and thermodynamically consistent
continuum damage model with polynomial-based damage hardening functions is
proposed for continuum damage modeling of laminated composite panels. The
damage model parameters are characterized based on all uniaxial/shear
experimental stress-strain curves. Steepest descent optimization algorithm is
used to minimize the difference between model predicted and experimental
stress-strain curves to get the optimzed model parameters. The fully
characterized damage evolution equations are used for damage prediction of a
moderately thick laminated composite curved beam modeled using first-order
shear deformation theory. Finite element method with load control is used to
get the non-linear algebraic equations which are solved using Newton Raphson
method. The developed model is compared with the existing failure mode
dependent and failure mode independent damage models. The results depict the
efficacy of the proposed model to capture non-linearity in the load vs
deflection curve due to stiffness degradation and different damage in tension
andcompression consistent with uniaxial/shear stress-strain response and
strength properties of the material, respectively.

### BatchTNMC: Efficient sampling of two-dimensional spin glasses using tensor network Monte Carlo

Efficient sampling of two-dimensional statistical physics systems remains a
central challenge in computational statistical physics. Traditional Markov
chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, including cluster algorithms, provide only
partial solutions, as their efficiency collapses for large systems in the
presence of frustration and quenched disorder. The recently proposed Tensor
Network Monte Carlo (TNMC) method offers a promising alternative, yet its
original implementation suffers from inefficiencies due to the lack of scalable
parallel sampling. In this work, we introduce BatchTNMC, a GPU-optimized and
parallelized implementation of TNMC tailored for large-scale simulations of
two-dimensional spin glasses. By leveraging batch processing and parallel
sampling across multiple disorder realizations, our implementation achieves
speedups of up to five orders of magnitude compared with the original serial
scheme. Benchmarking on two-dimensional spin glasses demonstrates dramatic
gains in efficiency: for instance, on a single GPU, BatchTNMC concurrently
produces 1000 uncorrelated and unbiased samples across 1000 disorder
realizations on $1024\times 1024$ lattices in just 3.3 hours, with an
acceptance probability of 37%. These results establish BatchTNMC as a scalable
and powerful computational framework for the study of two-dimensional
disordered spin glass systems.

### Interplay of Rashba and valley-Zeeman splittings in weak localization of spin-orbit coupled graphene

- **TL;DR**: 本文发展了石墨烯异质结构中弱局域化理论，研究了Rashba和valley-Zeeman自旋分裂对磁阻的影响，发现在Rashba耦合存在时valley-Zeeman分裂会导致磁导率符号改变。

Weak localization theory is developed for graphene heterostructures with
transition metal dichalcogenides and topological insulators where the Rashba
and valey-Zeeman spin-splittings of the energy spectrum are large enough. The
anomalous magnetoresistance in low fields caused by weak localization is
calculated. It is shown that the valley-Zeeman splitting has no effect on weak
localization in the absence of Rashba splitting but it results in the change of
the magnetoconductivity sign in the Rashba-coupled graphene. Inter-valley
scattering also affects the quantum correction to the conductivity resulting in
its sign reversal. Analytical expressions are obtained for the anomalous
magnetoconductivity at arbitrary relations between the Rashba and valley-Zeeman
splittings as well as the inter-valley scattering rates.

### Angular momentum of vortex-core Majorana zero modes

- **Title (EN)**: Angular momentum of vortex-core Majorana zero modes
- **Authors**: Giulia Venditti, Christophe Berthod, Louk Rademaker
- **Categories**: cond-mat.supr-con
- **TL;DR**: Error

Majorana zero modes (MZMs) are highly sought-after states with a possible
application in quantum computation. Here, we show that vortex-core MZMs can
carry a nontrivial angular momentum. This establishes new `flavors' of Majorana
modes, independent of the Chern classification of topological superconductors.
The MZM angular momentum is explicitly calculated for a microscopic model of a
$d+id$ superconductor placed on a three-dimensional topological insulator
($d+id+\phantom{}$Dirac model) using both exact diagonalization and the
Chebyshev expansion. We classify all possible quantum numbers of MZMs depending
on the windings of the order parameter and underlying normal state. The
topological protection of the MZM is set by the bulk gap, quasiparticle
poisoning by trivial in-gap states, and its localization length. All these
severely limit the stability of MZMs in the $d+id+\phantom{}$Dirac model, in
contrast to earlier claims. Nevertheless, the possibility of having different
flavors of MZM - in the form of angular momentum or something else - can
provide a unique path forward for the study of MZMs.

### A scalable route to first-order response properties with correlated sampling phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo

To make useful connections with experimental measurements, correlated
electronic structure theories must accurately predict chemical properties in
addition to energies. We present a finite-difference based algorithm to compute
first-order response properties with phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte
Carlo (ph-AFQMC) that relies on a branching correlated sampling approach.
Focusing on electric dipole moments, we show that mean-field trial wave
functions are sufficient to obtain high accuracy relative to CCSD(T) and
experimental measurements for a set of 21 molecules, ranging in size from 2 to
18 atoms in their equilibrium geometries. As with energies, the quality of
predicted dipole moments can be systematically improved with the use of
correlated trial wave functions, even (or especially) in strongly correlated
regimes. We show that the challenges faced by low-order perturbation theories
in predicting the dipole moment of hydrogen fluoride across its dissociation
coordinate are overcome with ph-AFQMC when using relatively simple trials. The
key advantage of our approach over those previously reported for ph-AFQMC is
its scalability to large system sizes with a phaseless bias no worse than that
of a typical ground-state energy calculation; we routinely converge dipole
moments for systems with more than one thousand basis functions.

### SU(4) Kondo Lattice in Semiconductor Moiré Materials

Motivated by recent advances in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) moir\'e
materials, we propose TMD moir\'e multilayers as a platform for realizing an
approximately SU(4)-symmetric triangular Kondo lattice, generalizing the
concept of the double quantum dot model. Our model extends the conventional
Kondo lattice by incorporating a three-site exchange of SU(4) local moments,
which drives spontaneous time-reversal and lattice symmetry breaking. Using a
parton mean-field approach, we map out the phase diagram as a function of
three-site exchange and hole doping. In the Kondo-unscreened regime, we
identify Mott insulating phases, including bond-ordered states and a chiral
spin liquid. With increasing doping, Kondo hybridization gives rise to a heavy
Fermi liquid that exhibits distinct patterns of lattice symmetry breaking, with
or without topological responses. We conclude with directions for future study.

Analog neuromorphic hardware is gaining traction as conventional digital
systems struggle to keep pace with the growing energy and scalability demands
of modern neural networks. Here, we present analog, fully magnonic, artificial
neurons, which exploit a nonlinear magnon excitation mechanism based on the
nonlinear magnonic frequency shift. This yields a sharp trigger response and
tunable fading memory, as well as synaptic connections to other neurons via
propagating magnons. Using micro-focused Brillouin light scattering
spectroscopy on a Gallium-substituted yttrium iron garnet thin film, we show
multi-neuron triggering, cascadability, and multi-input integration across
interconnected neurons. Finally, we implement the experimentally verified
neuron activation function in a neural network simulation, yielding high
classification accuracy on standard benchmarks. The results establish
all-magnonic neurons as promising devices for scalable, low-power, wave-based
neuromorphic computing, highlighting their potential as building blocks for
future physical neural networks.

We present the design, implementation, and evaluation of optimized
matrix-free stencil kernels for multigrid smoothing in the incompressible
Stokes equations with variable viscosity, motivated by geophysical flow
problems. We investigate five smoother variants derived from different
optimisation strategies: Red-Black Gauss-Seidel, Jacobi, fused Jacobi, blocked
fused Jacobi, and a novel Jacobi smoother with RAS-type temporal blocking, a
strategy that applies local iterations on overlapping tiles to improve cache
reuse. To ensure correctness, we introduce an energy-based residual norm that
balances velocity and pressure contributions, and validate all implementations
using a high-contrast sinker benchmark representative of realistic geodynamic
numerical models. Our performance study on NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper nodes of
the ALPS supercomputer demonstrates that all smoothers scale well within a
single NUMA domain, but the RAS-Jacobi smoother consistently achieves the best
performance at higher core counts. It sustains over 90% weak-scaling efficiency
up to 64 cores and delivers up to a threefold speedup compared to the C++
Jacobi baseline, owing to improved cache reuse and reduced memory traffic.
These results show that temporal blocking, already employed in
distributed-memory solvers to reduce communication, can also provide
substantial benefits at the socket and NUMA level. This work highlights the
importance of cache-aware stencil design for harnessing modern heterogeneous
architectures and lays the groundwork for extending RAS-type temporal blocking
strategies to three-dimensional problems and GPU accelerators.

### Contraction waves in pulsating active liquids: From pacemaker to aster dynamics

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一个流体动力学理论来研究由脉动可变形粒子组成的致密活性液体中收缩波的出现，揭示了脉动液体中自组织波的关键机制。

We propose a hydrodynamic theory to examine the emergence of contraction
waves in dense active liquids composed of pulsating deformable particles. Our
theory couples the liquid density with a chemical phase that determines the
periodic deformation of the particles. This mechanochemical coupling regulates
the interplay between the flow induced by local deformation, and the resistance
to pulsation stemming from steric interaction. We show that this interplay
leads the emergent contraction waves to spontaneously organize into a packing
of pacemakers. We reveal that the dynamics of these pacemakers is governed by a
complex feedback between slow and fast topological defects that form asters in
velocity flows. In fact, our defect analysis is a versatile platform for
investigating the self-organization of waves in a wide range of contractile
systems. Our results shed light on the key mechanisms that control the rich
phenomenology of pulsating liquids, with relevance for biological systems such
as tissues made of confluent pulsating cells.

- **TL;DR**: 本文分析了在有效材料描述中忽略远程能带贡献会导致定性错误结果，特别研究了带间混合效应对自旋电流的影响，发现标准自旋电流算符定义存在问题，提出了包含额外项的修正表达式。

When focusing on a few essential bands in an effective description of a
material to calculate observable quantities, the respective operators have to
be adjusted accordingly. Ignoring contributions arising from integrating out
remote bands can lead to qualitatively wrong results. We present a detailed
analysis of the interband mixing effects on spin currents. Specifically, we
calculate the intrinsic spin current in a time-reversal invariant
noncentrosymmetric crystal in the presence of electron-lattice spin-orbit
coupling. Starting from formally exact microscopic expressions, we derive the
spin current operator restricted to one or more essential bands by iterative
elimination of the contributions from distant bands. We show that the standard
definition of the spin current operator in terms of the group velocity obtained
from an effective band Hamiltonian cannot be justified using a microscopic
theory. The modified expression for the spin current operator contains
additional terms, which dominate the equilibrium spin current in a uniform
crystal. We show that the magnitude of these additional terms can considerably
exceed the spin current obtained using the standard definition.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文研究了在方形晶格上，随着施加应力变化，U(1)×Z₂超导态（自发破坏时间反演对称性）的出现条件，重点关注自旋单重态s+id态。研究发现微观计算显示复杂的相图，包括非单调的BTRS转变行为。有限样品中存在BTRS边界态，边界的存在有助于稳定BTRS相。

We study conditions of the appearance of \$U(1) \times \mathbb{Z}_2\$
superconducting states that spontaneously break time-reversal symmetry (BTRS)
on a square lattice as a function of applied stress. We focus on the
spin-singlet s+id state. Calculations show that if critical temperatures
coincide at zero stress they exhibit linear kink and no kink otherwise. We find
that in general, the microscopic calculations show a complex phase diagram, for
example, non-monotonic behavior of BTRS transition. Another
beyond-Ginzburg-Landau theory result is that \$U(1)\$ critical temperature can
decrease under compressional strain for small Poisson ratio materials. In the
second part of the paper we consider effects of boundaries and finiteness of
the sample on the strain-induced splitting of \$T_c^{U(1)}\$ and
\$T_c^{\mathbb{Z}_2}\$ transitions. A finite sample has BTRS boundary states
with persistent superconducting currents over a wide range of band filling.
Overall, the BTRS dome occupies a larger band filling--temperature phase space
region for a mesoscopic sample with [110] surface compared to an infinite
system. Hence, the presence of boundaries helps to stabilize the BTRS phase.

- **TL;DR**: 通过太赫兹z扫描测量发现，稀释的溶菌酶溶液具有巨大的非线性吸收系数，比之前研究高十倍，而浓缩溶液无此响应，表明蛋白质拥挤环境会消除热透镜效应。

Hydration water is vital for the stabilization of protein structure and
function. The strong interaction of hydration water with the protein surface
brings into question how dynamics and asymmetry of hydrogen bonds are perturbed
for hydration water compared to bulk water. Here, z-scan transmission
measurements at 0.5 Terahertz (THz) were performed for dilute and concentrated
lysozyme solutions. A giant nonlinear absorption coefficient was found for
dilute lysozyme solutions that is ten times greater than previous studies. This
giant nonlinear response stems from the high average THz power generated by the
TELBE free electron laser source, which drives the formation of a persistent
thermal lens. In contrast, concentrated lysozyme solutions did not demonstrate
a nonlinear response, revealing that crowding annihilates the thermal lensing
effect. These results indicates that the THz nonlinear transmission of aqueous
proteins solutions depends on the amount of hydration water present, and opens
to the door to understanding the nonlinear optical properties of biologically
relevant systems.

### Obtaining the Spectral Function of Moiré Graphene Heavy-Fermions Using Iterative Perturbation Theory

The spectral functions of twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) in the absence of
strain have recently been investigated in both the symmetric and
symmetry-broken phases using dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). The
theoretically predicted Mott-Hubbard bands and gapless semimetallic state at
half-filling have since been confirmed experimentally. Here, we develop several
second-order perturbation theory approaches to the topological heavy-fermion
(THF) model of TBG and twisted symmetric trilayer graphene (TSTG). In the
symmetric phase, we adapt, implement, and benchmark an iterative perturbation
theory (IPT) impurity solver within DMFT, enabling computationally efficient
yet accurate spectral function calculations. We present momentum- and
energy-resolved spectra over a broad range of temperatures and fillings for
both symmetric and symmetry-broken states. In addition, we derive analytic
expressions for the spectral function within the ``Hubbard-I'' approximation of
the THF model and, as expected, find that while it provides a tractable
description of Mott physics, it does not capture the low-energy Kondo peak or
the finite lifetime broadening of the bands. Our methodology can be extended to
include strain, lattice relaxation, and parameter variations, thereby allowing
systematic predictions of TBG and TSTG spectral properties across a wide range
of physical regimes. Because our perturbative approaches are far less
computationally intensive than DMFT with numerically exact impurity solvers,
they can be used to efficiently benchmark and scan extensive phase diagrams of
the THF parameters, paving the way for full DMFT analyses of the TBG spectral
function in the presence of strain and relaxation.

The stabilization of long-range magnetic order in nominally non-magnetic
semi- conductors using femtosecond light pulses is an exciting yet
experimentally challenging goal. Theoretical studies indicate that certain
non-magnetic semi- conductors can exhibit transient magnetic instabilities
following above-gap laser excitation, but the dynamical pathways leading to
these states remain largely unexplored. In this work, I introduce a minimal
real-time spin-orbital model and identify the fundamental microscopic
mechanisms that enable the emergence of a transient magnetic order. I then
discuss the relevance of these findings for real materials employing a
phenomenological time-dependent Ginzburg- Landau model. Finally, I analyze the
strengths and limitations of current first-principles methodologies for
investigating dynamically induced broken- symmetry states in the light of the
present results.

### Physics-Informed Field Inversion for Sparse Data Assimilation

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种物理信息场反演方法，通过在FIML技术的场反演阶段添加物理损失项，将复杂物理嵌入低保真模型，提高稀疏数据情况下的重建性能。

Data-driven methods keep increasing their popularity in engineering
applications, given the developments in data analysis techniques. Some of these
approaches, such as Field Inversion Machine Learning (FIML), suggest correcting
low-fidelity models by leveraging available observations of the problem.
However, the solely data-driven field inversion stage of the method generally
requires dense observations that limit the usage of sparse data. In this study,
we propose a physical loss term addition to the field inversion stage of the
FIML technique similar to the physics-informed machine learning applications.
This addition embeds the complex physics of the problem into the low-fidelity
model, which allows for obtaining dense gradient information for every
correction parameter and acts as an adaptive regularization term improving
inversion accuracy. The proposed Physics-Informed Field Inversion approach is
tested using three different examples and highlights that incorporating
physical loss can enhance the reconstruction performance for limited data
cases, such as sparse, truncated, and noisy observations. Additionally, this
modification enables us to obtain accurate posterior correction parameter
distribution with limited realizations, making it data-efficient. The increase
in the computational cost caused by the physical loss calculation is at an
acceptable level given the relaxed grid and numerical scheme requirements.

### Extending Sample Persistence Variable Reduction for Constrained Combinatorial Optimization Problems

Constrained combinatorial optimization problems (CCOPs) are challenging to
solve due to the exponential growth of the solution space. When tackled with
Ising machines, constraints are typically enforced by the penalty function
method, whose coefficients must be carefully tuned to balance feasibility and
objective quality. Variable-reduction techniques such as sample persistence
variable reduction (SPVAR) can mitigate hardware limitations of Ising machines,
yet their behavior on CCOPs remains insufficiently understood. Building on our
prior proposal, we extend and comprehensively evaluate multi-penalty SPVAR
(MP-SPVAR), which fixes variables using solution persistence aggregated across
multiple penalty coefficients. Experiments on benchmark problems, including the
quadratic assignment problem and the quadratic knapsack problem, demonstrate
that MP-SPVAR attains higher feasible-solution ratios while matching or
improving approximation ratios relative to the conventional SPVAR algorithm. An
examination of low-energy states under small penalties clarifies when
feasibility degrades and how encoding choices affect the trade-off between
solution quality and feasibility. These results position MP-SPVAR as a
practical variable-reduction strategy for CCOPs and lay a foundation for
systematic penalty tuning, broader problem classes, and integration with
quantum-inspired optimization hardware as well as quantum algorithms.

### Generation of pure, spin polarized, and unpolarized charge currents at the few cycle limit of circularly polarized light

- **TL;DR**: 本文展示了在过渡金属二硫化物（TMDC）中，通过超快激光脉冲可以在几飞秒时间尺度上产生和控制纯自旋电流、100%自旋极化电流和电荷电流。

In certain members of the transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) family,
laser pulses of oppositely circularly polarized light excite electrons of
opposite spin. Here we show that in the few cycle limit such pulses generate
not only a spin density excitation, but also a spin current excitation.
Employing the example of the TMDC WSe$_2$ we show that pure spin currents, the
flow of spin in the absence of net charge flow, 100% spin polarized currents,
and charge currents are all accessible and controllable by tuning the amplitude
of ~ 5 femtosecond gap tuned light pulses. Underpinning this physics is a
symmetry lowering of the valley charge excitation from C3 at long duration to
C2 in the few cycle limit, imbuing the excitation with net current. Our results
both highlight the emergence of a rich light-spin current coupling at ultrafast
times in the TMDC family, as well presenting a route to the all-optical
generation of pure spin currents.

We present a systematic study of the evolution of the band structure in the
Fe-based superconductor family BaFe$_{2-x}$M$_x$As$_2$ (M = Cr, Co, Cu, Ru and
Mn) using polarization-dependent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
(ARPES). Low-substituted samples, with comparable spin-density wave transition
temperatures ($T_\text{SDW}$), were chosen to facilitate controlled
comparisons. The sizes of the central hole pockets ($\alpha$, $\beta$, and
$\gamma$) remain largely unchanged across different substitutions, showing no
clear correlation with either $T_\text{SDW}$ or the As height relative to the
Fe planes. However, subtle trends are observed: a modest increase in the size
of the $\eta_\text{X}$ electron pocket correlates with the suppression of
$T_\text{SDW}$. Furthermore, the contraction of the $\eta_\text{X}$ pocket
appears to be linked to an increase in the As height relative to the Fe planes.
Our results suggest that the suppression of $T_\text{SDW}$ is primarily driven
by changes in the Fe-As bond length, with the effect being more pronounced in
electronic states with planar character. These findings provide insight into
the electronic structure of BaFe$_{2-x}$M$_x$As$_2$.

We investigated the molecular dynamics of the prototypical deep eutectic
solvent (DES) ethaline. We disentangled the different motions of its two
constituents, namely choline chloride and ethylene glycol on a spatio-temporal
range that extends from sub-nanometer to micrometer distances and from
picosecond to millisecond times. This was achieved by a combination of
pulsed-field-gradient NMR, time-of-flight, and backscattering quasielastic
neutron scattering experiments with isotopically labelled samples. On the
micrometer scale, we observe that the translational motions of the two DES
constituents obey classical hydrodynamics, with distinct diffusivities that
reflect their different hydrodynamic radii. This is no longer valid at the
nanometer-scale, where the two DES components present similar short-ranged
diffusivities, which indicates a significant effect of their supramolecular
association. The sub-nanometer scale motions include jumps that precede Fickian
diffusion, and localized dynamics that precede the breaking of the transient
cage formed by neighboring molecules. Therein, the spatial amplitude of the
localized motions mirrors their different molecular sizes, while their
respective correlation times contrast with observations made for other
choline-based DES such as glyceline. This result underlines the importance of
more subtle effects, such as the different H-bond propensities of the polyol
donor, and demonstrate the difficulty to anticipate the nanoscale dynamic
behavior of DES from the knowledge of their macroscopic properties.

### Instability of Laughlin FQH liquids into gapless power-law correlated states with continuous exponents in ideal Chern bands: rigorous results from plasma mapping

We investigate the fate of Laughlin's wave-function in ideal Chern bands
which can be mapped to generalized zero Landau levels in spatially dependent
magnetic fields. By exploiting its exact mapping onto a classical Coulomb gas
and leveraging previous results of one-component plasmas in nonuniform
neutralizing backgrounds, we demonstrate that the ideal Laughlin wave-function
undergoes a phase transition from its well-known fully gapped topologically
ordered plasma state into a power-law correlated dielectric state even for the
fixed filling of $1/3$, as the magnetic field becomes increasingly more
inhomogeneous. This dielectric state is gapless even though it does not
spontaneously break translational symmetry. Remarkably, for a fixed filling
$\nu=1/m$, the exponent governing density correlations in this state changes
continuously as a function of the degree of spatial inhomogeneity of the
magnetic field, and can range from $4$ near a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless
transition to the plasma state, up to $2 m$ in the limit of fields generated by
point solenoids.

The use of Si anodes can greatly improve the energy density of Li-ion
batteries. However, understanding and mitigation of calendar aging remains a
barrier to commercialization. In this short report, we utilize operando Nuclear
Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to detect and quantify lithium silicides
(LixSi) as they form and react within Si anodes in pouch cells during calendar
aging. We provide direct experimental evidence of complex aging phenomena in
the Si anodes, including both SEI growth and dissolution during storage.
Formation of electrochemically isolated LixSi is also observed, as indicated by
the partial persistence of highly lithiated phases after the cell is
discharged. Remarkably, we show that these isolated domains can themselves
self-discharge over time, suggesting that their detection can be challenging in
post-mortem studies. Finally, we show that aging outcomes depend heavily on the
type of silicon particles contained within the electrode, and that certain
surface coatings can help decrease the reactivity between lithium silicides and
the electrolyte.

### Strain-Tuned Optical Properties of a Two-Dimensional Hexagonal Lattice: Exploiting Saddle Degrees of Freedom and Saddle Filtering Effects

The deformation of hexagonal lattices has attracted considerable attention
due to its promising applications in straintronics. This study employs the
tight-binding model to investigate the anisotropic spectrum, where electronic
transport can be manipulated by the degree of deformation. The longitudinal
conductivities, light transmittance, and absorbance are analyzed, revealing
enhancement along one direction and suppression along the other. The findings
indicate that the direction and magnitude of strain can be determined by
measuring transmittance and absorbance, showing significant deviations from the
unstrained condition. Furthermore, a strong absorbance is observed due to the
interband transition of electrons near the M-point saddles, linked to van Hove
singularities for specific values of nearest and next-nearest hoping energy.
The unexpected characteristics of saddle polarization-analogous to valley
polarization at K- and K'-become particularly prominent when strain affects the
selection of M-point saddle. Notably, the demonstration indicates that a highly
efficient M-point saddle filtering effect takes place, induced by linearly
polarized light. This model paves the way for exploring the optical properties
of anisotropic hexagonal lattices, such as black phosphorus and borophene
oxide. These results also open a pathway to strain-programmable optoelectronic
devices, such as polarization-selective photodetectors, tunable absorbers, and
ultrathin optical filters.

We have fabricated three-dimensional (3D) networks of ultrathin carbon
nanotubes (CNTs) within the ~5-Angstrom diameter pores of zeolite ZSM-5
crystals using the chemical vapour deposition (CVD) process. The 1D electronic
characteristics of ultrathin CNTs are characterized by van Hove singularities
in the density of states. Boron doping was strategically employed to tune the
Fermi energy near a van Hove singularity, which is supported by extensive
ab-initio calculations, while the 3D network structure ensures the formation of
a phase-coherent bulk superconducting state under a 1D to 3D crossover. We
report characteristic signatures of superconductivity using four complementary
experimental methods: magnetization, specific heat, resistivity, and
point-contact spectroscopy, all consistently support a critical temperature Tc
at ambient conditions ranging from 220 to 250 K. In particular, point-contact
spectroscopy revealed a multigap nature of superconductivity with a large ~30
meV leading gap, in rough agreement with the prediction of the
Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory of superconductivity. The differential
conductance response displays a particle-hole symmetry and is tuneable between
the tunnelling and Andreev limits via the transparency of the contact, as
uniquely expected for a superconductor. Preliminary experiments also reveal a
giant pressure effect which increases the Tc above the ambient temperature.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种描述pnicogen元素固体晶体结构的有效模型，基于简单立方晶格上的三价网络模型，将化学键合问题映射为边界伊辛自旋模型。

We present an effective description for the crystal structures of pnictogen
elemental solids. In these materials, each atom contains three valence
electrons in $p$ orbitals. They are shared between neighbouring atoms to form
valence bonds. We propose a trivalent network model on the simple cubic
lattice. As a generalization of a dimer model, we impose a constraint that
three dimers must touch every site. We argue that intra-orbital Coulomb
repulsion prohibits the formation of two adjacent, parallel dimers. This leads
to a tripod-like local configuration at every site. More importantly, it forces
every line of the cubic lattice to have alternating dimers and blanks. There is
no dynamics as dimers cannot be locally rearranged. A bulk-boundary mapping
emerges whereby bonds in the interior are fully described by Ising variables on
three bounding planes -- a simple example of holography that may be realized in
real materials. To describe the energetics of bonding, we formulate a minimal
model in terms of boundary Ising spins. Symmetries reduce the problem to that
of three identical, independent, two-dimensional Ising models. An
antiferromagnetic Ising-ground-state corresponds to the A7 structure seen in
antimony and grey arsenic. An antiferromagnetic phase within a bilayer
describes the structure of phosphorene. By stacking such bilayers, we obtain
the A17 structure of black phosphorus. The stripe phase of the Ising models
describes the cubic gauche structure of nitrogen. As a testable signature, we
demonstrate that single impurities will induce long-ranged domain walls.

Er-doped Al$_2$O$_3$ is a promising host for telecom-band integrated
photonics. Here we combine ab initio calculations with a symmetry-resolved
analysis to elucidate substitutional Er on the Al site (Er$_\mathrm{Al}$) in
$\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$. First-principles relaxations confirm the structural
stability of Er$_\mathrm{Al}$. We then use the local trigonal crystal-field
symmetry to classify the Er-derived impurity levels by irreducible
representations and to derive polarization-resolved electric-dipole selection
rules, explicitly identifying the symmetry-allowed $f$\textendash$d$
hybridization channels. Kubo--Greenwood absorption spectra computed from
Kohn--Sham states quantitatively corroborate these symmetry predictions.
Furthermore, we connect the calculated intra-$4f$ line strengths to Judd--Ofelt
theory, clarifying the role of $4f$\textendash$5d$ admixture in enabling
optical activity. Notably, we predict a characteristic absorption near
$1.47~\mu\mathrm{m}$ (telecom band), relevant for on-chip amplification and
emission. To our knowledge, a symmetry-resolved first-principles treatment of
Er:Al$_2$O$_3$ with an explicit Judd--Ofelt interpretation has not been
reported, providing a transferable framework for tailoring rare-earth dopants
in wide-band-gap oxides for integrated photonics. Our results for the optical
spectra are in good agreement with experimental data.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文提出了复杂频率指纹框架，通过分析响应哈密顿量的特征值和特征态，证明了相互作用可以单独导致点隙拓扑和非厄米趋肤效应，并引入了复杂频率态密度框架来区分这两种模式。

The excitation properties of quantum many-body systems are encoded in their
response functions. These functions define an associated response Hamiltonian,
which is intrinsically non-Hermitian due to the dissipative nature of retarded
responses, even in closed systems. By analyzing its eigenvalues and
eigenstates, one obtains a unique characterization of the system, referred to
as the complex frequency fingerprint. Using this framework, we demonstrate that
interactions alone can give rise to both point-gap topology and the
non-Hermitian skin effect. Unlike the dissipation-induced skin effect, this
interaction-driven phenomenon exhibits pronounced frequency dependence. We
further introduce a complex-frequency density of states framework that
distinctly separates non-Hermitian skin modes from topological edge modes.

- **TL;DR**: 提出一种通过酉变换将哈密顿量映射到seniority-zero空间的方法，用于求解强关联系统的电子薛定谔方程，该方法计算成本低且精度高

We propose a method to solve the electronic Schr\"odinger equation for
strongly correlated systems by applying a unitary transformation to reduce the
complexity of the physical Hamiltonian. In particular, we seek a transformation
that maps the Hamiltonian into the seniority-zero space, since such
Hamiltonians are computationally more tractable while still capturing strong
correlation within electron pairs. The unitary rotation is evaluated using the
Baker--Campbell--Hausdorff (BCH) expansion, truncated to two-body operators via
the operator-decomposition strategy of canonical transformation (CT) theory,
which rewrites higher-rank terms approximately in terms of one- and two-body
operators. The method was tested on three molecular systems: H$_6$ in the
STO-6G basis, BeH$_2$ along the standard C$_{2v}$ insertion pathway, and BH in
the 6-31G basis. In all cases, the Seniority-zero Linear Canonical
Transformation (SZ-LCT) method delivers highly accurate results, with most
errors on the order of $10^{-4}$ Hartree. Additionally, SZ-LCT has a cost of
$O(N^7/n_c)$, where $n_c$ is the number of CPU cores, making it comparable to
single-reference methods when the number of available cores is at least equal
to the number of orbitals.

Asymptotically close to critical end-points of first-order transitions,
maxima in thermodynamic quantities occur along a line called the Widom line, a
concept first introduced in classical fluids. This concept has been extended to
strongly correlated electronic fluids in the context of the Mott transition.
Namely, upon increasing interaction strength in the Hubbard model at
half-filling, one finds a first-order Mott metal-insulator transition with a
critical end-point at high temperature above which a number of crossover lines
are observable. Using the dynamical cluster approximation for the
triangular-lattice Hubbard model, we compute the Frenkel line, another concept
borrowed from classical fluids, useful to define a sharp crossover between the
pseudogap and the correlated Fermi liquid. The Frenkel line in the electron
fluid is defined by the appearance of back-scattering when entering the
pseudogap. The signature of back-scattering is the existence of a negative
value in the time-domain optical conductivity.

### Zero-field Anomalous Hall Effect in Bulk Single Crystal Mn3Ir

- **TL;DR**: 该论文报道了通过高通量助熔剂方法成功生长出化学计量比的Mn_3Ir块体单晶，并对其磁化和反常霍尔效应进行了表征，揭示了其内在磁性和AHE特性。

The L1_2-phase non-collinear antiferromagnet (AFM) Mn_3Ir has emerged as a
pioneering platform for realizing the zero-field anomalous Hall effect (AHE),
thereby catalyzing rapid advances in antiferromagnetic spintronics. Despite its
significant potential, experimental investigations of the intrinsic magnetic
and electronic properties of Mn_3Ir have been greatly hindered by the
formidable challenges in growing bulk single crystals. Here, we report the
growth of stoichiometric Mn_3Ir bulk single crystals and their characterization
in terms of magnetization and the AHE. Using a high-throughput flux method, we
obtained (111)-oriented hexagonal Mn_3Ir single crystals. A small AHE signal
was detected, which we attribute to the coexistence of A- and B-type
antiferromagnetic domains that mutually cancel the net AHE response. Our
results reveal key aspects of the intrinsic magnetic properties and AHE in bulk
Mn_3Ir, providing a critical material platform for the development of advanced
spintronic devices.

### Intrinsic-perturbation induced anomalous higher-order boundary states in non-Hermitian systems

The behavior of higher-order boundary states in non-Hermitian systems is
elusive and thereby finding the mechanism behind these states is both essential
and significant. Here, we uncover a novel mechanism that induces anomalous
higher-order boundary states. The mechanism originates from the sensitivity of
the non-normal boundary Hamiltonian to intrinsic perturbations, where intrinsic
perturbations here refer to the influence of the bulk on the topological
boundaries. Based on the mechanism, we reveal a new kind of phase transition,
i.e., the transition between hybrid skin-topological states and scale-free
topological boundary states. We also find that scale-free topological boundary
states exhibit size-dependent spectra, influencing the existence of
higher-order topological boundary states. Unlike conventional hybrid
skin-topological states or higher-order non-Hermitian skin effect, the above
two kinds of anomalous higher-order boundary states exhibit size-dependent
characteristics. Our work opens a new horizon for the control of higher-order
boundary states and topological properties of non-Hermitian systems.

### Bayesian Neural Networks versus deep ensembles for uncertainty quantification in machine learning interatomic potentials

Neural-network-based machine learning interatomic potentials have emerged as
powerful tools for predicting atomic energies and forces, enabling accurate and
efficient simulations in atomistic modeling. A key limitation of traditional
deep learning approaches, however, is their inability to provide reliable
estimates of predictive uncertainty. Such uncertainty quantification is
critical for assessing model reliability, especially in materials science,
where often the model is applied on out-of-distribution data. Different
strategies have been proposed to address this challenge, with deep ensembles
and Bayesian neural networks being among the most widely used. In this work, we
introduce an implementation of Bayesian neural networks with variational
inference in the aenet-PyTorch framework. To evaluate their applicability to
machine learning interatomic potentials, we systematically compare the
performance of variational BNNs and deep ensembles on a dataset of 7,815
TiO$_{2}$ structures. The models are trained on both the full dataset and a
subset to assess how variations in data representation influence predictive
accuracy and uncertainty estimation. This analysis provides insights into the
strengths and limitations of each approach, offering practical guidance for the
development of uncertainty-aware machine learning interatomic potentials.

### Incommensurate magnetic order drives singular angular magnetoresistance in a Weyl semimetal

- **TL;DR**: 该论文发现Weyl半金属CeAlGe中的多k非共线磁态会产生奇异角磁阻(SAMR)，这是一种能够以极高精度检测磁场方向的电输运特征。相比之下，其姐妹化合物CeAlSi既没有多k磁序也没有SAMR。通过57%的Ge替代，这些现象在CeAlSi1-xGex中出现，并与电子结构变化相关，这些变化软化了单离子面内各向异性并增强了Weyl介导的磁相互作用。

We demonstrate that a multi-$\mathbf{k}$ incommensurate magnetic state in the
Weyl semimetal CeAlGe gives rise to singular angular magnetoresistance (SAMR),
an electrical-transport signature that detects the magnetic-field direction
with exceptional precision. In contrast, the sister compound CeAlSi shows
neither multi-$\mathbf{k}$ order nor SAMR. Both phenomena emerge upon
$\sim57\%$ Ge substitution in CeAlSi$_{1-x}$Ge$_x$ and coincide with
electronic-structure changes that soften the single-ion in-plane anisotropy and
enhance Weyl-mediated magnetic interactions. These results reveal a direct
connection between band topology, electronic transport, and collective
magnetism in Weyl semimetals.

We examined the electronic structures and optical properties of single
crystals of RCd3P3 (R = Ce or La). Our first-principles analysis indicates that
CeCd3P3 and LaCd3P3 exhibit semiconductor characteristics with narrow energy
gaps of approximately 0.51 and 0.70 eV, respectively. Notably, a slight
displacement of the Cd and P atoms within the unit cell significantly
transforms the electronic structure from insulating to metallic state. Optical
spectroscopy of both compounds reveals a metallic state with a low charge
carrier density, suggesting a finite density of states at the Fermi level. A
comparison between the theoretical electronic structures and experimental
optical properties elucidates the observed metallic behavior. Additionally, the
notable modification of the infrared-active phonons strongly indicates a
structural phase transition in these compounds. Our findings also suggest that
CeCd3P3 serves as a suitable platform for investigating the photoinduced Kondo
effect due to its metallic ground state with limited charge carriers.

### Quantum oscillations between excitonic and quantum spin Hall insulators in moiré WSe2

- **TL;DR**: 该论文实现了在扭曲双层WSe2中通过磁场调控的量子自旋霍尔绝缘体与激子绝缘体之间的拓扑相变，揭示了周期性振荡现象和高达四对螺旋边缘态的QSHI。

Quantum spin Hall insulators (QSHIs) and excitonic insulators (EIs) are
prototypical topological and correlated states of matter, respectively. The
topological phase transition between the two has attracted much theoretical
interest but experimental studies have been hindered by the availability of
tunable materials that can access such a transition. Here, by utilizing the
interaction-enhanced g-factor and the flat moir\'e bands in twisted bilayer
WSe2 (tWSe2), we realize tunable electron-like and hole-like Landau levels
(LLs) in the opposite valleys of tWSe2 under a perpendicular magnetic field. At
half-band-filling, which corresponds to electron-hole charge neutrality,
periodic oscillations between QSHIs (for fully filled LLs) and EIs (for
half-filled LLs) are observed due to the interplay between the cyclotron energy
and the intervalley correlation; QSHIs with up to four pairs of helical edge
states can be resolved. We further analyze the effect of Fermi surface nesting
on the stability of EIs via electric field-tuning of the moir\'e band
structure. Our results demonstrate a novel QSHI-to-EI topological phase
transition and provide a comprehensive understanding of the fermiology of
tWSe2.

### Short-Range Solvent-Solvent and Ion-Solvent Correlations at Metal-Electrolyte Interfaces: Parameterization and Benchmarking

Short-range correlations in electrolyte solutions lead to oscillatory
profiles of water polarization and ionic concentration at electrode-electrolyte
interfaces. The recently developed density-potential-polarization functional
theory (DPPFT) provides a comprehensive framework to incorporate these
short-range correlation effects. In the present work, the parameters describing
short-range solvent-solvent and ion-solvent correlations in DPPFT are
determined from the wavenumber-dependent dielectric susceptibility spectrum of
pure water and from ion solvation energies derived within nonlocal
electrostatics, respectively. The experimental ionic-radius-dependent hydration
energies of alkali metal cations and halide anions are well reproduced by the
solvation model. The charge hydration asymmetry is explained as the stronger
short-range repulsion between cations and water molecules compared to that
between anions and water molecules. Using these parameters, DPPFT is then
applied to investigate short-range correlation effects at the Ag(111)-NaF
aqueous electrolyte interface. The water polarization profiles obtained from
DPPFT calculations show good agreement with AIMD simulations. Furthermore, as
the strength of short-range ion-solvent repulsion increases, the peaks of
anionic/layers shift from regions near centers of positive/negative
polarization charges toward those of opposite sign, thereby preserving
solvation configurations similar to those in bulk solution. This work
establishes a consistent procedure for parameterizing short-range correlation
effects within the DPPFT framework, thereby enabling a more quantitative and
computationally efficient description of atomic-scale phenomena at
electrochemical interfaces.

Magnetic monopoles, elusive in high-energy physics, have been realised as
emergent quasiparticles in solid-state systems, where their unique properties
hold promise for novel spintronic applications. Magnetic monopoles have been
invoked in diverse platforms, including skyrmion lattices, chiral magnets, soft
ferromagnets, aritifical nanomagnets. Yet, a demonstration of their role in
magnetic transport has remained elusive. Here, we report such an observation
via the spin Seebeck effect in the bulk insulating pyrochlore oxide, spin ice
$\mathrm{Dy_2Ti_2O_7}$. By applying a thermal gradient perpendicular to a
$[111]$-oriented magnetic field, we detect a transverse spin Seebeck voltage
marked by a dominant peak at the onset of monopole proliferation, accompanied
by a secondary feature and frequency-dependent behavior. Our findings establish
a direct link between monopole dynamics and magnetic transport in an insulating
medium, establishing a new pathway for probing fractionalized excitations and
advancing towards novel spintronic applications.

We investigated the optical properties of 13 different dielectric materials
(slide glass, quartz, Al2O3 (c-cut), DyScO3 (110), KTaO3 (001), LaAlO3 (001),
(LaAlO3)0.3-(Sr2AlTaO6)0.7 (001) (LSAT), MgF2 (100), MgO (100), SiC, SrTiO3
(001), TbScO3 (110), and TiO2). The single-bounce reflectance spectra of the
bulk samples were measured using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and
monochromatic spectrometers across a wide spectral range, from far infrared to
ultraviolet (80-50,000 cm-1). Using the Kramers-Kronig analysis, we obtained
the optical conductivity and dielectric function of the dielectric materials
from their measured reflectance spectra. Moreover, we measured the
transmittance spectra of the materials to obtain their bandgaps. We fitted the
measured reflectance spectra using the Lorentz model to obtain phononic
structures. Each dielectric material exhibits unique phononic structures and
optical bandgaps, associated with the composition and crystal structure of the
material. The observed optical properties of these dielectric materials provide
valuable information for the optical analysis of thin films grown on them.

### Localized Excitons and Landau-Level Mixing in Time-Reversal Symmetric Pairs of Chern Bands

We study Landau-level mixing in a time-reversal-symmetric Hamiltonian
composed of two sets of Landau levels with opposite magnetic field, relevant to
moir\'e minibands in twisted homobilayer transition-metal dichalcogenides in
the adiabatic limit, where electrons in opposite valleys have flat Chern bands
with opposite Chern numbers. Strong spin-orbit coupling polarizes spins in
opposite directions in opposite valleys, separating Coulomb interactions into
like-spin ($V^{\uparrow\uparrow}$) and opposite-spin
($V^{\uparrow\downarrow}$). Using degenerate perturbation theory, we compute
Landau-level mixing corrections to $V^{\uparrow\uparrow}$ and
$V^{\uparrow\downarrow}$ for different filling fractions. In the lowest Landau
level, screening exhibits an even-odd effect: $V^{\uparrow\uparrow}$ is reduced
more strongly than $V^{\uparrow\downarrow}$ in even-$m$ angular momentum
Haldane pseudopotential and less strongly in odd-$m$ angular momentum ones. In
the first Landau level, the short-range part ($m=0,1$) of
$V^{\uparrow\downarrow}$ is reduced comparably to $V^{\uparrow\uparrow}$, while
the strongest spin anisotropy appears in the $m=2$ pseudopotential. These novel
short-range spin correlations have important implications for candidate
correlated phases of fractional quantum spin Hall insulators. A distinctive
feature of this time-reversal-symmetric Hamiltonian, absent in conventional
quantum Hall systems, is that spin-flip excitations form localized
quasiparticles. We compute their excitation spectrum and predict a
non-monotonic dependence of the ordering temperature of Chern ferromagnetism in
MoTe$_2$ on the Landau-level mixing parameter.

The search for kagome magnets with unconventional magnetic and electronic
properties has gained significant attention in recent years. We report the
magnetic, electronic, and thermoelectric properties of Fe3Ge single crystals,
where the Fe atoms form a slightly distorted kagome lattice. Fe3Ge exhibits a
large anomalous Hall effect and anomalous Nernst effect. The anomalous
transverse thermoelectric conductivity reaches about 4.6 A m^-1 K^-1, exceeding
values reported for conventional ferromagnets and most topological
ferromagnets. First-principles calculations indicate that these transport
responses are primarily governed by intrinsic mechanisms, highlighting the
dominant role of Berry curvature arising from massive Dirac gaps in momentum
space. In addition, we observe a topological Hall resistivity of about 0.9
microOhm cm and a topological Nernst coefficient of 1.2 microvolt K^-1, which
are attributed to the Berry phase associated with field-induced scalar spin
chirality. These findings demonstrate the combined influence of Berry phases in
both momentum and real space, establishing Fe3Ge as a promising candidate for
room-temperature transverse thermoelectric applications.

Aliovalent doping of the two-dimensional dimer antiferromagnet
SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$ has long been proposed as a potential route toward
realizing resonating valence bond (RVB) superconductivity in this system;
however, experimental progress has remained limited. This study explores the
effects of La doping on the ground state of SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$ and reports
the first flux growth of Sr$_{1-x}$La$_x$Cu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$ single crystals
with nominal doping levels up to $x$ = 0.15. Powder X-ray diffraction and
energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy confirm the successful incorporation of La
on the Sr sites within the tetragonal $I\bar{4}2m$ structure, although the
effective doping was limited to approximately 50% of the nominal concentration.
La doping induces systematic changes in the magnetic properties, with a
reduction of the effective spin gap $\Delta$ from ~28.2K to ~20.3 K at $x$ =
0.15, as determined from low-temperature magnetic susceptibility. X-band
electron spin resonance measurements reveal the emergence of unpaired Cu$^{2+}$
spins in La-doped SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$ single crystals, which develop
antiferromagnetic correlations below ~5.5 K. These findings corroborate the
breaking of the local spin dimers induced by La doping. Despite this, no
superconductivity is observed across the entire doping range studied. The
present study demonstrates that at low doping levels, electron doping locally
destabilizes the spin-singlet ground state in SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$, while the
intrinsic spin dynamics of the dimer lattice remain largely preserved.

Scientific hypothesis generation is central to materials discovery, yet
current approaches often emphasize either conceptual (idea-to-data) reasoning
or data-driven (data-to-idea) analysis, rarely achieving an effective
integration of both. Here, we present a generalizable active learning workflow
that integrates top-down, theory-driven hypothesis generation, guided by a
large language model. This is complemented by bottom-up, data-driven hypothesis
testing through a root-cause association study. We demonstrate this approach
through the design of equimolar quinary-cation two-dimensional perovskite, a
chemically complex system with over 850,000 possible cation combinations. In
the top-down component, the large language model drives closed-loop
optimization by proposing candidates that are likely to achieve phase purity,
leveraging domain knowledge and chain-of-thought reasoning. With each
iteration, the model identifies an increasing number of near phase-pure
compositions, sampling less than 0.004% of the design space. In parallel, the
bottom-up association study identifies molecular features with statistically
significant influences on phase purity. The integration of these approaches
enables the convergence of conceptual and statistical hypotheses, leading to
generalizable and rational design rules for phase-pure quinary-cation
two-dimensional perovskites. As a proof of concept, we applied the optimized

As an exclusive feature of a non-Hermitian system, the existence of
exceptional points (EPs) depends not only on the details of the Hamiltonian but
also on the particle-number filling and the particle statistics. In this paper,
we study many-particle EPs in a Bose Hubbard chain with two end-site resonant
imaginary potentials. Starting from a single-particle coalescing eigenstate, we
construct $n$-particle condensate eigenstates for the cases with zero and
infinite $U$. Compared with the free bosonic case, where the $ n $-particle
condensate eigenstate is an $(n+1)$-th-order coalescing state, the
hardcore-boson counterpart is a second-order coalescing state for odd $n$ ,
while it is not for even $n$. The difference in particle-number parity results
in distinct quenching dynamics of the condensate states, highlighting the role
of parity in system behavior. Our finding may stimulate research on the dynamic
sensitivity to particle-number parity.

Density Functional Theory (DFT) and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD)
simulations have been employed to investigate the evolution of local motifs
within the tetragonal phase of FAPbI3 under thermal excitation. Our results
reveal a distinct broadening in the distribution of PbI6 octahedral volumes
with increasing temperature, indicating a gradual breakdown of symmetry and
emergence of diverse local environments. These octahedral volume distortions
are primarily driven by the dynamic behaviour of the FA cation leading to
softening of PbI6 octahedra, evident from calculated mean octahedral volume and
Pb-I-Pb bond angles. The examination of electronic structure confirmed that
this dynamic structural phenomenon is directly responsible for the change in
fundamental band gap value, highlighting the role of PbI6 octahedra in
modifying and modulating the electronic properties in FAPbI3. The results
demonstrate the microscopic origin of thermally induced dynamical behaviour to
the macroscopic electronic properties and underscore the pivotal role of local
motifs in hybrid perovskites.

### Interacting-cluster spin liquids with robust flat bands evolving into higher-rank half-moon phases and topological Lifshitz transitions

- **TL;DR**: 该论文提出了一个关于相互作用簇哈密顿量的通用理论，研究了自旋液体中零散度场与簇间相互作用竞争时的相变行为，揭示了平带向螺旋自旋液体的转变机制。

Classical spin liquids are disordered magnetic phases, governed by local
constraints that often give rise to flat-band ground states. When constraints
take the form of a zero-divergence field within a cluster of spins, the spin
liquid is often described by an emergent Coulomb gauge theory. Here we
introduce an interaction $\eta$ between these clusters of spins which compete
with the zero-divergence field. Using a framework embracing both the
connectivity matrices of graph theory and the topology of band structures, we
develop a generic theory of interacting-cluster Hamiltonians. We show how flat
bands remain at zero energy up to finite interaction $\eta$, until a dispersive
band becomes negative, stabilizing a spiral spin liquid with a hypersurface of
ground-state manifold in reciprocal space. This hypersurface serves as a mold
for the apparition of the half-moon patterns in the equal-time structure
factor. Our generic approach enables to extend the notion of half moons to the
perturbation of higher-rank Coulomb fields and pinch-line spin liquids. In
particular, multi-fold half moons appear when unconventional gauge charges,
such as potential fractons, are stabilized in the ground state. Finally,
half-moon phases can be tuned across the equivalent of a Lifshitz transition,
when the hypersurface manifold changes topology.

Indium-doped semiconductor crystals CdZnTeSe with several different

- **TL;DR**: 通过高分辨率角分辨光电子能谱研究CrO2半金属铁磁体的电子结构，发现68meV处的扭折结构，揭示了电子-声子和电子-磁振子相互作用对重正化准粒子动力学的影响

We report the electronic structure of the half-metal ferromagnet CrO2 by
means of high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). The
observed clear Fermi surface (FS) and band dispersion are in good agreement
with the previous reports. Moreover, the ARPES band dispersion reveals a
distinct kink structure around 68 meV, providing the first evidence from the
electronic structure for the elementary excitations in CrO2. The energy scale
of this feature is comparable to the Debye temperature and the A1g phonon mode,
suggesting the electron-phonon interaction. From the detailed analysis, we have
extracted the self-energy and found two characteristic structures in the real
part of the self-energy. Assuming the existence of the electron-magnon
interaction as well as the electron-phonon interaction, we have simulated the
line shape for the real and imaginary parts of the self-energy and reproduced
the ARPES intensity. Our spectral findings demonstrate the renormalized
quasiparticle (QP) dynamics in CrO2 and provide valuable insights into the
fundamental many-body interactions governing half-metallic ferromagnets.

### Beyond Bloch: A Theoretical Blueprint for Conjugated Polymer Optoelectronics

- **TL;DR**: 本文提出了一种新的理论框架来解释共轭聚合物中的电荷传输机制，通过考虑电子-电子相互作用，预测了新型的平带激发键合态，并成功拟合了实验光谱数据。

Conjugated polymers are experiencing a surge of renewed interest due to their
promising applications in various organic electronic devices. These include
organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), field-effect transistors (FETs), and
organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices, among many others. Their appeal stems from
distinct advantages they hold over traditional inorganic semiconductors. Unlike
inorganic semiconductors, where electrons are often considered to be in
delocalized, free, or quasi-free states (as described by Bloch's theory),
electrons in conjugated polymers behave differently. They are strongly coupled
within highly localized $\sigma$ or $\pi$-orbitals and interact significantly
with the ionic cores. This means they are far from the idealized delocalized
states presumed by Bloch's theory approaches. Consequently, after nearly a
century of applying Bloch's theory to the electronic transport properties of
inorganic materials, there is a clear need for a new theoretical framework to
explain efficient charge transport in these organic solids. Our presented model
addresses this need by incorporating crucial electron-electron interactions.
Specifically, it accounts for both intra-site interactions and interactions
between the $\pi$-states located at alternating sites along the polymer chain.
This framework provides a many-body charge conduction mechanism and explains
the semiconducting properties of the undoped material. A significant outcome of
our model is the prediction of two novel flat bands of excited bonding states.
Intriguingly, these states obey Bose--Einstein statistics and facilitate charge
transport. Furthermore, our model accurately reproduces experimental data,
providing an excellent fit for measured UV-Vis absorption and
electroluminescent spectra.

Disorder in frustrated quantum systems can critically influence their
magnetic ground states and drive exotic correlated behavior. In the $S =
\frac{1}{2}$ system ktenasite,
Cu$_\text{2.7}$Zn$_\text{2.3}$(SO$_\text{4}$)$_\text{2}$(OH)$_\text{6}\cdot$6H$_\text{2}$O,
we show that structural disorder drives an unexpected dimensional crossover and
stabilizes a rare coexistence of distinct magnetic states. Neutron diffraction
reveals significant Cu/Zn mixing at the Cu2 site, which tunes the Cu$^{2+}$
sublattice from a two-dimensional scalene-distorted triangular lattice into a
one-dimensional spin-chain network. Magnetic susceptibility, neutron
diffraction, ac susceptibility, and specific heat measurements collectively
indicate magnetic duality: a coexistence of incommensurate long-range magnetic
order below $T_\text{N} = 4\,$K and a cluster spin-glass state with $T_\text{f}
= 3.28\,$K at $\nu = 10\,$Hz. Our findings highlight ktenasite as a rare
platform where structural disorder tunes the effective dimensionality and
stabilizes coexisting ordered and glassy magnetic phases, offering a unique
opportunity to explore the interplay of frustration, disorder, and dimensional
crossover in quantum magnets.

### A basis-free, octonionic criterion for Weyl points in solids

- **TL;DR**: 本文提出了一种基于八元数结构的局部、无基准则来诊断外尔点，消除了传统方法中的算法任意性，为高通量搜索提供了更简化的手性分配方法。

Conventional diagnostics of Weyl points -- Berry flux on small spheres and $k
\cdot p$ linearization -- are topologically sound but depend on user choices
(sphere center and radius, gauge smoothing, charting, and local frame
transport) that introduce algorithmic arbitrariness in first-principles
workflows. We propose a \emph{local, basis-free} criterion built from the
octonionic structure on $\mathbb{R}^7$. From a smooth two-band projector we
construct a unit octonion field and its octonionic connection; contracting
three directional derivatives with the $\mathrm{G}_2$--invariant three-form
yields a pseudoscalar density whose sign equals the Weyl chirality. A vanishing
octonionic associator at leading order certifies that the local problem closes
inside an associative (quaternionic) three-plane, while a nonzero density
identifies a Weyl point. The construction is invariant under $\mathrm{SU}(2)$
gauge changes of the two-band subspace and under $\mathrm{G}_2$ rotations of
its completion, and it eliminates enclosing surfaces and gauge-seam choices. In
the linear regime we prove equivalence with the conventional diagnostics (Chern
charge on a small sphere and $\mathrm{sgn}\det v$). We outline a practical
algorithm compatible with Wannier tight-binding Hamiltonians and provide
self-consistency checks based on stencil refinement and the associator norm.
The \emph{octonionic Weyl point criterion} streamlines chirality assignment in
high-throughput searches and offers an intrinsic warning signal in the presence
of band entanglement or proximity to multi-fold touchings.

### First principles band structure of interacting phosphorus and boron/aluminum $δ$-doped layers in silicon

Silicon can be heavily doped with phosphorus in a single atomic layer (a
$\delta$ layer), significantly altering the electronic structure of the
conduction bands within the material. Recent progress has also made it possible
to further dope silicon with acceptor-based $\delta$ layers using either boron
or aluminum, making it feasible to create devices with interacting $\delta$
layers with opposite polarity. It is not known, however, how these $\delta$
layers will interact, particularly at small separation distances. Using Density
Functional Theory, we calculate the electronic structure of a phosphorus-based
$\delta$ layer interacting with a boron or aluminum $\delta$ layer, varying the
distances between the $\delta$ layers. At separations 10 \AA\ and smaller, the
dopant potentials overlap and largely cancel each other out, leading to an
electronic structure closely mimicking bulk silicon. At separations greater
than 10 \AA, the two layers behave independently of one another, forming a p-n
diode with an intrinsic layer taking the place of the depletion region. One
mechanism for charge transfer between $\delta$ layers at larger distances could
be tunneling, where we see a greater than 3\% probability for tunneling between
a phosphorus and boron layer at 20 \AA\ separation. This tunneling rate exceeds
what would be seen for a standard silicon 1.1 eV triangular barrier, indicating
that the interaction between delta layers creates enhanced tunneling at larger
separation distances compared to a traditional junction. These calculations
provide a foundation for the design of silicon-based electronics based on
interacting $\delta$ layers.

Dimensionality and electronic correlations are crucial elements of many
quantum material properties. An example is the change of the electronic
structure accompanied by the loss of quasiparticles when a metal is reduced
from three dimensions to a lower dimension, where the Coulomb interaction
between carriers becomes poorly screened. Here, using angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we report an orbital-selective decoherence
of spectral density in the perovskite nickelate LaNiO3 towards the monolayer
limit. The spectral weight of the dz2 band vanishes much faster than that of
the dx2-y2 band as the thickness of the LaNiO3 layer is decreased to a single
unit cell, indicating a stronger correlation effect for the former upon
dimensional confinement. Dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) calculations show
an orbital-selective Mott transition largely due to the localization of dz2
electrons along the c axis in the monolayer limit. This orbital-selective
correlation effect underpins many macroscopic properties of nickelates, such as
metal-to-insulator transition and superconductivity, where most theories are
built upon a dx2-y2-dz2 two-band model.

Lattice deformation is a powerful way to engineer the properties of
two-dimensional (2D) materials, making their precise measurement an important
challenge for both fundamental science and technological applications. Here, we
demonstrate that boron-vacancy (V$_\text{B}^-$) color centers in hexagonal
boron nitride (hBN) enable quantitative strain sensing with sub-micrometer
spatial resolution. Using this approach, we precisely quantify the
strain-induced shift of the E$_{\rm 2g}$ Raman mode in a hBN flake under
uniaxial stress, establishing V$_\text{B}^-$ centers as a new tool for strain
metrology in van der Waals heterostructures. Beyond strain sensing, our work
also highlights the unique multimodal sensing functionalities offered by
V$_\text{B}^-$ centers, which will be valuable for future studies of
strain-engineered 2D materials.

Three-dimensional topological semimetals hosting Dirac or Weyl fermions are a
new kind of materials class in which conduction and valence bands cross each
other. Such materials harbor a nontrivial Berry phase, which is an additional
geometrical phase factor arising along the path of an adiabatic surface and can
give rise to experimentally measurable quantities such as an anomalous Hall
component. Here we report a systematic study of quantum oscillations of
thermoelectric power in single crystals of the topological Dirac nodal-line
semimetal BaAl$_{4}$. We show that the thermoelectric power (TEP) is a
sensitive probe of the multiple oscillation frequencies in this material, with
two of these frequencies shown to originate from the three-dimensional Dirac
band. The detected Berry phase provides evidence of the angular dependence and
non-trivial state under high magnetic fields. We also have probed the
signatures of Zeeman splitting, from which we have extracted the Land\'e
$g$-factor for this system, providing further insight into the non-trivial
topology of this family of materials.

Radiation induced helium bubble formation poses a major challenge to the
structural integrity of materials in nuclear energy systems. In this study, we
investigate defect evolution and He behavior in ZrNb nanoscale metallic
multilayers with immiscible BCC and HCP interfaces, irradiated with 80 keV He
ions. For comparison, single crystal Nb and polycrystalline Zr were also
irradiated under identical conditions to serve as reference materials. Using
cross sectional TEM, SIMS, STEM EELS, nanoindentation, Doppler Broadening
Positron Annihilation Spectroscopy, Positron Annihilation Lifetime
Spectroscopy, and atomistic simulations, we reveal a highly asymmetric damage
response across the multilayer interfaces. Zr layers exhibit larger He bubbles,
higher swelling, and greater helium retention while Nb layers develop
bubble-denuded zones exclusively around the interfaces, where bubble nucleation
is strongly suppressed and swelling is limited. This asymmetry arises from
differences in atomic transport properties DFT calculations show lower
migration barriers for vacancies and He atoms in Nb, enabling efficient defect
migration and recombination at interfaces, whereas Zr retains defects due to
higher migration barriers. EELS and DBS PALS measurements confirm bubble
densities and the presence of sub-nanometer open volumes. Compared to
monolithic samples, the ZrNb multilayers exhibit lower irradiation induced
hardening and reduced He retention. These findings highlight the role of
interfaces in driving asymmetric radiation damage and demonstrate the
effectiveness of BCC Nb layers in mitigating defect growth. Overall, ZrNb
multilayers are established as a superior alternative to conventional single
and polycrystalline materials for extreme irradiation environments.

Ultrafast optical excitation is known to destabilize long-range order in
correlated systems, yet experiments have also reported the emergence of
metastable phases, in some cases with enhanced critical temperatures. The
microscopic origin of such light-induced stabilization remains unresolved. Here
we investigate this problem within a minimal spin-fermion framework: a
double-exchange model at half filling, augmented by ferromagnetic superexchange
on a square lattice. In equilibrium, at half-filling the ordering temperature
is set by the competition between kinetic-energy-driven antiferromagnetism and
superexchange-induced ferromagnetism. Using quantum
Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Brown dynamics for localized spins combined with
mean-field evolution of itinerant electrons, we demonstrate a nonthermal
mechanism for stabilizing ordered phases. Photoexcitation creates a long-lived
nonequilibrium carrier population that resists thermalization and reshapes the
low-energy landscape, converting kinetic-energy-driven antiferromagnetism into
ferromagnetism and enhancing the critical temperature. While model-specific,
our results reveal a general microscopic pathway by which light can tip the
balance between competing orders, suggesting routes toward optically engineered
magnetism, charge-density-wave order, and superconductivity.

### Quantum-to-classical transition and H-theorem in surface diffusion

In this work, surface diffusion is studied with a different perspective by
showing how the corresponding open dynamics is transformed when passing, in a
continuous and smooth way, from a pure quantum regime to a full classical
regime; the so-called quantum-to-classical transition. This continuous process
is carried out from the Liouville-von Neumann equation by scaling Planck's
constant. For this goal, the Brownian motion of an adsorbate on a flat surface
is analyzed in order to show how this transition takes place. In particular,
this open dynamics is studied from the master equation for the reduced density
matrix within the Caldeira-Leggett formalism; in particular, the two extreme
time behaviors, the ballistic and diffusive motions. It is also shown that the
origin of the ballistic motion is different for the quantum and classical
regimes. In this scenario, the corresponding Gaussian function for the
intermediate scattering function is governed by the thermal velocity in the
classical regime versus the initial spreading velocity of the wave packet for
the quantum regime, leading to speak of classical and quantum ideal gas,
respectively. Finally, in the diffusive regime, and starting from the
Chudley-Elliott model, the quantum-to-classical transition is also discussed in
terms of the well-known H-function for three surface temperatures in the
diffusion of H and D on a Pt(111) surface. The main goal in this analysis is if
one can discriminate the irreversibility coming from tunneling and thermal
activation diffusion.

ambient temperature. When a threshold temperature in the heat-based short-term
memory of the device is exceeded, the output of the in-memory logic operations
is transferred within the same device to a long-term memory, where it can be
retrieved at macroscopic times. The long-term memory is based on
magnetoresistive switching from a reference low-resistive uniform magnetic
state to high-resistive metastable nanofragmented magnetic states. The
in-memory heat-based logic operations and the conversion of the outputs into
the electrically-readable long-term magnetoresistive memory were performed at
sub-nanosecond time scales, making them compatible with the GHz frequencies of
standard electronics. Finally, we demonstrate the possibility of rapidly
resetting the long-term memory to the reference low-resistive state by heat
pulses.

The interplay between dimensionality and electronic correlations in van der
Waals (vdW) materials offers a powerful toolkit for engineering light-matter
interactions at the nanoscale. Excitons, bound electron-hole pairs, are central
to this endeavor, yet maximizing their oscillator strength, which dictates the
interaction cross-section, remains a challenge. Conventional wisdom suggests a
trade-off, where the observable oscillator strength often decreases in strongly
bound systems due to population dynamics. Here, we unveil a colossal oscillator
strength associated with the quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) excitons in the
layered magnetic semiconductor CrSBr, which fundamentally defies this
established scaling law. Through comprehensive optical characterization and ab
initio calculations, we establish that this anomalous enhancement originates
directly from the reduced dimensionality, which enforces an increased
electron-hole wavefunction overlap. Moreover, we find a close connection
between fundamental exciton and local spin fluctuations that contribute to the
opening of the gap in the electronic spectrum. The resulting optical anisotropy
shows a giant in-plane birefringence (Delta_n = 1.45) and profoundly
anisotropic waveguiding, which we directly visualize using nano-optical
imaging. Leveraging this extreme response, we realize a true zero-order
quarter-wave plate with an unprecedented wavelength-to-thickness ratio
(lambda/t) exceeding 3.4, surpassing the limits of current miniaturization
technologies, including state-of-the-art metasurfaces. Our findings underscore
the profound impact of dimensionality engineering in magnetic vdW materials for
realizing novel regimes of light-matter coupling and developing next-generation
ultracompact photonic architectures.

- **TL;DR**: 这篇综述文章系统回顾了含有[M2O]反铜酸盐层状结构的固态材料，重点关注其结构、物理性质以及通过软化学修饰调控性能的方法。

There has been significant recent interest in layered solid-state materials
containing an [M2O] square lattice layer (M = transition metal), particularly
because [M2O] is the anti-type of the [CuO2] planes in the layered cuprate
superconductors. In addition to the superconducting titanium oxypnictides, the
[M2O] anti-cuprate layer also occurs in a wide range of layered oxychalcogenide
compounds with M spanning early (Ti, V) to later transition metals (Mn, Co,
Fe). The chalcogenide in question - which sandwiches the anti-cuprate layer -
may be S, Se or Te, and in combination with a wide range of intervening
"spacer" layers, many different structural families have been investigated.
This review surveys the structures and physical properties of all these
oxychalcogenide materials and relates these properties to their common
anti-cuprate square lattice [M2O] layer. It is organised around the different
oxidation states of the metal ion M, in order to explore the effects of the
electronic configuration of M on the physical properties of each compound as a
whole. A key part of the review highlights the use of soft-chemical
modifications to alter physical properties of these materials, in the synthesis
of novel van der Waals materials and other metastable compounds. Future avenues
for these materials in the bulk, few- and single-layer limits are discussed.

### Nanoscale Strain Evolution and Grain Boundary-Mediated Defect Sink Behavior in Irradiated SiC: Insights from N-PED and DFT

Understanding irradiation-induced strain in silicon carbide (SiC) is
essential for designing radiation-tolerant ceramic materials. However,
conventional methods often fail to resolve nanoscale strain gradients,
especially in polycrystalline forms. In this study, we employ nano-beam
precession electron diffraction (N-PED) to perform high-resolution,
multi-directional strain mapping in both single-crystal 4H-SiC and
polycrystalline {\alpha}-SiC subjected to helium and hydrogen ion irradiation.
The high-resolution X-ray diffraction (HR-XRD) simulations of He + H irradiated
single-crystal 4H-SiC closely match the strain profiles obtained from N-PED,
demonstrating the reliability and accuracy of the N-PED method. In
He-irradiated polycrystalline {\alpha}-SiC at high temperatures, a
bubble-depleted zone (BDZ) near the grain boundary (GB) reveals that GBs act as
active sinks for irradiation-induced defects. N-PED further shows strain
amplification localized at the GBs, reaching up to 2.5%, along with strain
relief within the BDZ. To explain this behavior, density functional theory
(DFT) calculations of binding and migration energies indicate a strong tendency
for Si, C, and He atoms to segregate toward the GB core. This segregation
reduces the availability of vacancies to accommodate He atoms and leads to
local strain relaxation near the GB. Furthermore, first-principles tensile
simulations reveal that Si and C interstitials mitigate He-induced GB
embrittlement. Charge density and DOS analyses link this effect to the bonding
characteristics between point defects and neighboring atoms at GB. These
insights underscore the importance of grain boundary engineering in enhancing
radiation tolerance of SiC for nuclear and space applications.

### Magnetic Ordering in Moiré Graphene Multilayers from a Continuum Hartree+U Approach

Recently, symmetry-broken ground states, such as correlated insulating
states, magnetic order and superconductivity, have been discovered in twisted
bilayer graphene (tBLG) and twisted trilayer graphene (tTLG) near the so-called
magic-angle. Understanding the magnetic order in these systems is challenging,
as atomistic methods become extremely expensive near the magic angle and
continuum approaches fail to capture important atomistic details. In this work,
we develop a self-consistent approach based on a continuum model that
incorporates both short-ranged Hubbard interactions and long-ranged Coulomb
interactions, therefore allowing efficient exploration of magnetic order in
moir\'e graphene multilayers. With this approach, we perform a systematic
analysis of the magnetic phase diagram of tBLG as a function of doping level
and twist angle, near the magic angle. We find that the results are consistent
with previous perturbative atomistic Hartree+U calculations. Furthermore, we
predict stable magnetic orders for the tTLG. We found that the magnetic orders
are similar to those in tBLG for small values of on-site repulsion. In the
future, the developed method can be utilized to investigate magnetic ordering
tendencies from short-range exchange interactions in other moir\'e graphene
multilayers as a function of doping, twist angle, screening environment, among
other variables.

- **TL;DR**: 本研究比较了基于手工描述符的随机森林和高斯过程模型与基于图神经网络的CGCNN模型在热障涂层材料QSAR建模中的性能，发现CGCNN模型显著优于传统方法。

Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modelling is widely
employed in materials sci- ence to predict properties of interest and extract
useful descriptors for measured properties. In thermal barrier coatings (TBC),
QSAR can significantly shorten the experimental discovery cycle, which can take
years. Although machine learning methods are commonly employed for QSAR, their
performance depends on the data quality and how instances are represented.
Traditional, hand-crafted descriptors based on known material properties are
limited to represent materials that share the same basic crystal structure,
limited the size of the dataset. By contrast, graph neural networks offer a
more expressive representation, encoding atomic positions and bonds in the
crystal lattice. In this study, we compare Random Forest (RF) and Gaussian
Process (GP) models trained on hand-crafted descriptors from the literature
with graph-based representations for high-entropy, rare-earth pyrochlore oxides
using the Crystal Graph Convolutional Neural Network (CGCNN). Two different
types of augmentation methods are also explored to account for the limited data
size, one of which is only applicable to graph-based representations. Our
findings show that the CGCNN model substantially outperforms the RF and GP
models, underscoring the potential of graph-based representations for enhanced
QSAR modelling in TBC research.

### Anharmonicity-driven phonon avoided crossing and anomalous thermal transport in nodal-line semimetal ZrSiS

- **TL;DR**: 本研究通过第一性原理计算系统研究了拓扑节点线半金属ZrSiS中的声子和电荷输运，发现非简谐声子重整化导致热载声子显著软化并抑制晶格热导率，同时发现ZrSiS具有异常的晶格热导率主导行为和偏离Wiedemann-Franz定律的现象。

Understanding thermal and electrical transport in topological materials is
essential for advancing their applications in quantum technologies and energy
conversion. Herein, we employ first-principles calculations to systematically
investigate phonon and charge transport in the prototypical nodal-line
semimetal ZrSiS. The results unveil that anharmonic phonon renormalization
results in the pronounced softening of heat-carrying phonons and suppressed
lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_{\rm L}$). Crucially, anharmonic effects
are found to noticeably weaken Zr-S interactions, triggering avoided-crossing
behavior of low-frequency optical phonons. The combination of phonon softening
and avoided crossing synergistically reduces phonon group velocities, yielding
a 16\% suppression in $\kappa_{\rm L}$ along the $c$-axis at room temperature.
Contrary to conventional metals, we discover that the lattice contribution to
thermal conductivity in ZrSiS is abnormally large, even dominating heat
conduction along the $c$-axis. This unusual behavior results in a substantial
deviation of the Lorenz number from the Sommerfeld value -- exceeding it by up
to threefold -- thereby challenging the validation of standard Wiedemann-Franz
law for thermal conductivity estimation. Moreover, our calculations demonstrate
that ZrSiS exhibits exceptional electrical conductivity, attributed to its
topological electronic Dirac states that accounts for both high Fermi
velocities and weak electron-phonon coupling. This study provides critical
insights into the electrical and thermal transport mechanisms in ZrSiS and
highlights the importance of anharmonic effects in the lattice dynamics and
thermal transport of metallic materials.

### Trends in the electronic structure of borophene polymorphs

Borophene is a two-dimensional material made out of boron atoms only. It
exhibits polymorphism and different allotropes can be studied in terms of a
rigid electronic structure, where only the occupation of the states change with
the respect to the number of electrons available in the system (self-doping).
In this work we selected a set of representative borophene polymorphs
($\delta_3$, $\delta_5$, $\delta_6$, $\beta_{12}$ $\alpha_1$, $\alpha'$,
$\alpha'$-Bilayer) and studied the shared features of their electronic
structures and the limitations of this model. Our work revealed the appearance
of defect-like states in some polymorphs when related to a parent rigid
electronic structure, and bonding/antibonding monolayer-like states in the
$\alpha'$-Bilayer. Moreover, we show how the buckling of $\delta_6$ and
$\alpha'$ can act as a tuning parameter, enabling semimetallicity, Dirac cones,
and nesting of the Fermi surface. In light of their promises for exotic but
also useful behavior, we expect our work to foster the interest in larger and
more complex borophene structures.

Chalcogen vacancies in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs),
such as WS$_{2}$, play a crucial role in various applications ranging from
optoelectronics and catalysis to quantum information science (QIS), making
their identification and control essential. This study focuses on WS$_{2}$
single vacancy and vacancy pairs. Using first principles computations, we
investigate their thermodynamic stabilities and electronic structures. We
identify an "on-top" divacancy configuration where two vacancies sit on top of
each other to be the only energetically stable complex with a binding energy of
160 meV. We compute a small difference in electronic structure with a shift of
the unoccupied state by 140 meV for the divacancy complex and observe
electronic state shift during Scanning Tunneling Spectroscopy of a series of
vacancy in WS$_2$ providing spectroscopical evidence for the presence of this
defect.

### Exploring Cation Selection and Disorder within Entropy-Driven $A_{6}B_{2}$O$_{17}$ ($A$=Zr/Hf, $B$=Nb/Ta) Oxides

We investigate the local atomic and electronic structure, thermodynamic
stability, and defect chemistry of $A_{6}B_{2}$O$_{17}$ ($A$ = Zr/Hf, $B$ =
Nb/Ta) oxides using first-principles density functional theory (DFT)
calculations. We examine both ordered unit cells as well as fully disordered
special quasirandom structures to clearly discern the effects of cation
disorder. Structural predictions align closely with previous experimental
results and follow established ionic radii trends. The electronic structure is
strongly dependent on $B$-cation species: $A_{6}$Ta$_{2}$O$_{17}$ compositions
have ~30% larger band gaps than their $A_{6}$Nb$_{2}$O$_{17}$ counterparts.
Defect chemistry is similar for all compositions, with anion vacancies being
more energetically favorable than corresponding cation defects. All explored
$A_{6}B_{2}$O$_{17}$ compositions are enthalpically unstable with respect to
their $A$O$_{2}$ and $B_{2}$O$_{5}$ competing oxides and are therefore
classified as entropy-stabilized materials, supporting prior experimental
results. The pronounced agreement between our disordered supercell predictions
with experimental measurements indicates all explored $A_{6}B_{2}$O$_{17}$
compositions contain substantial cation disorder across all 6-, 7-, and
8-coordinated sites. Our findings collectively provide a fundamental
understanding of the $A_{6}B_{2}$O$_{17}$ material family through DFT
calculations, establishing a framework for future compositional tuning to
engineer targeted material properties.

We report spatially resolved optical probing of charge traps in organic
field-effect transistors using focussed laser illumination. By scanning a 635
nm laser across the transistor channel and simultaneously acquiring transfer
characteristics, we observe persistent, localised shifts in transistor turn-on
voltage correlated with illumination dose and position, with negligible impact
on field-effect mobility. The effect is strongest 5-10 um from the source
electrode and requires a drain-to-source scan direction with sub-10 um step
size. Kelvin probe force microscopy confirms trapped negative charges along the
scan path, consistent with exciton dissociation and electron trapping near the
semiconductor-dielectric interface. The phenomenon is reproducible across
multiple device geometries and organic semiconductors, including
TMTES-pentacene, TIPS-pentacene, and diF-TES-ADT. These findings enable direct
mapping of trap distributions and suggest new strategies for trap engineering,
threshold voltage tuning, and development of organic optoelectronic memories.

### Detachment limited interlayer transport processes during SrTiO3 pulsed laser epitaxy

Pulsed laser epitaxial growth is characterized by high instantaneous
deposition rates that leads to the nucleation of transient islands, both on
surface terraces, and on top of stable islands formed during previous
deposition pulses. We report results from combined in-situ X-ray reflectivity
and kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations. Specular reflectivity monitors
interlayer transport, while diffuse scattering reveals the evolution of
in-plane length scales, both during the recovery time between individual laser
pulses and over multiple deposited layers. The initial stage after each laser
pulse is faster than the temporal resolution of the experiment, while
subsequent recovery occurs over seconds. The results suggest that transient
islands on top of stable two-dimensional islands form immediately after the
deposition pulse, and then ripen via detachment and diffusion, leading to the
slower component. kMC simulations show that the detachment energy barrier plays
a dominant role in determining the recovery time constant.

### Atomistic mechanisms of oxidation and chlorine corrosion in Ni-based superalloys: The role of boron and light interstitial segregation

Hybrid Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations were used to
investigate the interaction of light interstitials in multi-element Ni-based
alloys. We show that light interstitials such as boron and oxygen fundamentally
alter interfacial chemistry by reshaping alloy-element distribution and
segregation. Oxygen adsorption drove boron migration from the grain boundary to
the free surface, where it co-enriched with Cr, Fe, and Mo and formed BO3
trigonal motifs embedded within mixed-metal oxide networks. Oxygen also
promoted M-O-M chain formation, including Nb2O5 clusters at the free surface.
In the absence of oxygen, boron segregated to the grain boundary, altering
local metal chemistry and underscoring a dynamic, environment-sensitive
behavior. Following chlorine exposure, the oxidized surfaces retained strong
O-mediated connectivity while forming new Cl-M associations, particularly with
Nb and Cr, and exhibited further surface enrichment in Cr, Fe, and Mo.
High-temperature MD simulations revealed a dynamic tug-of-war: chlorine exerted
upward pull and disrupted weakly anchored sites, while Nb- and BO3-rich oxide
motifs resisted deformation. A new stabilization mechanism was identified in
which subsurface boron atoms anchored overlying Cr centers, suppressing their
mobility and mitigating chlorine-driven displacement. These results demonstrate
boron's dual role as a modifier of alloy-element segregation and a stabilizer
of oxide networks, and identify Nb as a key element in reinforcing cohesion
under halogen attack. More broadly, this study highlights the need to track
light interstitial cross-talk and solute migration under reactive conditions,
offering atomistic criteria for designing corrosion-resistant surface
chemistries in Ni-based superalloys exposed to halogenated or oxidative
environments.

### Molecular Insights into Caprock Integrity of Subsurface Hydrogen Storage: Perspective on Hydrogen-induced Swelling and Mechanical Response

The geological storage of hydrogen (H_2) requires reliable long-term caprock
sealing, yet the nanoscale interactions between H_2 and clay minerals remain
critically underexplored despite their importance for storage security. This
lack of understanding has limited the ability to predict mechanical stability
and leakage risks in H_2 storage formations. Using molecular simulations, this
study investigates the swelling behavior and mechanical properties of sodium
montmorillonite (Mt), a common smectite clay, under varying hydration states
and interlayer H_2 contents. Results show that H_2 accelerates hydration-state
transitions, narrows the stability window of crystalline swelling, and promotes
asymmetric plume formation in confined interlayers. H_2 alters cation and water
coordination, thereby weakening Na^+--Mt electrostatic interactions and
modulating H-bond networks at the interface and in the bulk. Mechanical
analysis reveals pronounced anisotropy in Mt. In-plane stiffness is mainly
governed by basal spacing expansion, whereas out-of-plane stiffness is highly
sensitive to the initial presence of water or H_2, which weaken interlayer
cohesion. Tensile and compressive strengths in the in-plane directions follow
in-plane stiffness trends, while the out-of-plane tensile strength is governed
by Mt--water H-bonds. The presence of H_2 further promotes Mt sheets separation
by disrupting nanoscale liquid bridges. Collectively, these results provide the
first atomistic-scale evidence that intercalated H_2 reshapes swelling
energetics, elastic anisotropy, and failure pathways in Mt, highlighting
critical nanoscale mechanisms that may compromise caprock integrity during
underground H_2 storage.
