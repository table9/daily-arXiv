These lecture notes explain the classification of some simple fermionic
topological phases of matter in a pedestrian manner, with an aim to be
maximally pedagogical = doing things in excruciating detail. We focus on a
many-body perspective, even if many of the models we work with are
non-interacting. We start out with symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases
of free fermions that are protected by U(1) symmetry = topological insulators.
We then look at fermion topological phases that don't even need a symmetry =
topological superconductors, and explain how their classification changes in
presence of spinless time-reversal symmetry. We close by perturbatively
checking which of the 1D topological phases we had found are stable to
interactions.

- **TL;DR**: 本文提出了一个现象学模型来解释反铁电材料中观察到的类似铁电的滞后回线现象，并通过实验在PbZrO3和PbHfO3薄膜中验证了这种人工铁电行为。

Antiferroelectrics exhibit unique double-hysteresis polarization loops, which
have garnered significant attention due to their potential applications such as
energy storage, electromechanical transduction, as well as synapse devices.
However, numerous antiferroelectric materials have been reported to display
signs of hysteresis loops resembling those of ferroelectric materials, and a
comprehensive understanding remains elusive. In this work, we provide a
phenomenological model that reproduces such widely observed artificial
ferroelectric hysteresis with a superposition of numerous disordered
antiferroelectric loops that have varying antiferroelectric-to-ferroelectric
transition fields, particularly when these field ranges intersect.
Experimentally, we realized such artificial ferroelectric-like hysteresis loops
in the prototypical antiferroelectric PbZrO$_3$ and PbHfO$_3$ thin films, by
introducing non-uniform local disorder (e.g., defects) via fine-tuning of the
film growth conditions. These ferroelectric-like states are capable of
persisting for several hours prior to transitioning back into the
thermodynamically stable antiferroelectric ground state. Those results provide
insights into the fundamental impact of disorder on the AFE properties and new
possibilities of disorder-tailored functions.

### Unifying framework for non-Hermitian and Hermitian topology in driven-dissipative systems

- **TL;DR**: 该论文将非厄米拓扑与定向放大的对应关系从单复能带扩展到多能带和高维情况，引入了广义奇异谱(GSS)来定义物理上有意义的能带和拓扑不变量，证明了体边对应关系，并展示了两种拓扑边缘模式。

Recently, a one-to-one correspondence between non-trivial non-Hermitian
topology and directional amplification has been demonstrated, theoretically and
experimentally, for the case of one complex band. Here, we extend our framework
to multiple bands and higher spatial dimension. This proves to be far from
trivial. Building on the singular value decomposition, we introduce a new
quantity that we dub generalised singular spectrum (GSS). The GSS allows us to
define physically meaningful bands related to the system's scattering behaviour
and to define invariants for novel notions of point gaps (non-Hermitian
topology) and line gaps (Hermitian-like topology), respectively. For both
invariants, we prove a bulk-boundary correspondence and show that they give
rise to two different kinds of topological edge modes. We illustrate our
results with a 1D non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model and a 2D
non-Hermitian model that features corner-to-corner amplification. Our work is
relevant for many state-of-the-art experimental platforms and it sets the stage
for applications such as novel directional amplifiers and non-reciprocal
sensors.

### Ramp Josephson junctions of Al/Ti/Sr2RuO4: Observation of single-domain quantum oscillations and the detection of chiral edge current

- **TL;DR**: 该论文报道了在Sr2RuO4超导体中通过制备高质量Josephson结来检测手性边缘电流的研究，解决了时间反演对称性破缺与手性边缘电流实验验证之间的矛盾。

The spontaneous breaking of time-reversal symmetry (TRS), one of the
hallmarks of unconventional superconductivity, has been observed in the
superconducting state of Sr2RuO4 by muon spin rotation in several independent
studies. However, the chiral edge current expected in such a superconductor has
not yet been established experimentally. In addition, the angle dependence of
the phase of the superconducting order parameter (OP) in Sr2RuO4, which would
enable determination of the full symmetry properties of the OP, has been
determined only for a couple of angles. Both issues can be addressed by
preparing high-quality Josephson junctions between Sr2RuO4 and a conventional
s-wave superconductor with varying orientations relative to the crystal axes.
Here we report the successful fabrication of ramp Josephson junctions of Al/Ti/
Sr2RuO4 on thin single crystals of Sr2RuO4 obtained by mechanical exfoliation.
These junctions exhibit high-quality quantum oscillations as a function of
magnetic field. Moreover, the junction resistance was found to be extremely
sensitive to the current flowing in the Sr2RuO4 crystal, a feature that was
used in this work to show that the chiral edge current. The approach to the
chiral edge current detection, which was not used previously, was verified by a
control experiment.

### Dynamical correlation effects in twisted bilayer graphene under strain and lattice relaxation

- **TL;DR**: 本文研究了异质应变和弛豫对魔角双层石墨烯中关联电子物理的影响，通过应用动力学平均场理论到拓扑重费米子模型，成功解释了实验观测到的多种特征。

We study the impact of lattice effects due to heterostrain and relaxation on
the correlated electron physics of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene, by
applying dynamical mean-field theory to the topological heavy fermion model.
Heterostrain is responsible for splitting the 8-fold degenerate flat bands into
two 4-fold degenerate subsets, while relaxation breaks the particle-hole
symmetry of the unperturbed THF model. The interplay of dynamical correlation
effects and lattice symmetry breaking enables us to satisfactorily reproduce a
wide set of experimentally observed features: splitting the flat band
degeneracy has observable consequences in the form of a filling-independent
maximum in the spectral density away from zero bias, which faithfully
reproduces scanning tunneling microscopy and quantum twisting microscopy
results alike. We also observe an overall reduction in the size and degeneracy
of local moments upon lowering the temperature, in agreement with entropy
measurements. The absence of particle-hole symmetry has as a consequence the
stronger suppression of local moments on the hole-doped side relatively to the
electron-doped side, and ultimately causes the differences in existence and
stability of the correlated phases for negative and positive doping. Our
results show that even fine-level structures in the experimental data can now
be faithfully reproduced and understood.

### Quantum criticality in cuprate superconductors revealed by optical conductivity measurement

- **TL;DR**: 该研究通过分析过掺杂Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+δ的输运性质，发现临界掺杂处存在ω/T标度行为，表明奇异金属行为由量子临界涨落引起。

The ubiquitous temperature ($T$)-linear behaviour of the transport scattering
rate in the normal state of strongly correlated electron systems is called
strange metallicity
\cite{zaanen:2004,phillips:2022,hartnoll:2022,chowdhury:2022,yuan:2022}.
Although strange metallicity is crucial to understanding superconductivity in
correlated electron systems, its origin remains elusive to date
\cite{hussey:2023}. Here, we present the doping-, temperature-, and frequency
($\omega$)-dependent transport properties of overdoped
Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ in a wide doping range of 0.183 to 0.231. We
observe that the optical scattering rate and effective mass exhibit an
$\omega/T$ scaling behaviour at a critical doping of $p_{c} \simeq$ 0.231. Away
from the critical doping, the $\omega/T$ scaling behaviour is destroyed below a
doping-dependent crossover temperature $T_\Delta(p) \sim |p-p_{c}|^{0.24}$.
Furthermore, the optical coherence mode (OCM) observed within the
superconducting dome rapidly broadens and eventually disappears as the critical
doping is approached. The emergence of the $\omega/T$ scaling behaviour of the
transport scattering rate and broadening of the OCM near the critical doping
strongly suggests that strange metallic behaviour is caused by quantum critical
fluctuations. Our results provide compelling spectroscopic evidence for quantum
criticality in cuprate superconductors.

### Nonlinear Response Relations and Fluctuation-Response Inequalities for Nonequilibrium Stochastic Systems

Predicting how systems respond to external perturbations far from equilibrium
remains a fundamental challenge across physics, chemistry, and biology. We
present a unified response framework for stochastic Markov dynamics that
integrates linear and nonlinear perturbations. Our formalism expresses
nonlinear responses of observables in terms of the covariance between the
observable and a nonlinear conjugate variable. The nonlinear conjugate variable
is subject to the complete Bell polynomial form and is determined by the
stochastic entropy production. In addition, the Fluctuation-Response
Inequalities (FRIs) are also derived for nonlinear responses, unraveling the
general trade-off relations between nonlinear response and systems'
fluctuations far from equilibrium. The validity of our theory is verified by
the numerical results from a symmetric exclusion process (SEP). By unifying and
extending nonequilibrium linear response theories, our approach can provide
principled design rules for sensitive, adaptive synthetic and biological
networks.

### Examining the robustness of Physics-Informed Neural Networks to noise for Inverse Problems

- **TL;DR**: 该论文比较了物理信息神经网络(PINNs)与传统有限元方法在求解偏微分方程逆问题上的性能表现，发现虽然PINNs需要较少的人工努力和专业知识，但在计算时间和精度上仍逊于传统方法。

Approximating solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs) is
fundamental for the modeling of dynamical systems in science and engineering.
Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are a recent machine learning-based
approach, for which many properties and limitations remain unknown. PINNs are
widely accepted as inferior to traditional methods for solving PDEs, such as
the finite element method, both with regard to computation time and accuracy.
However, PINNs are commonly claimed to show promise in solving inverse problems
and handling noisy or incomplete data. We compare the performance of PINNs in
solving inverse problems with that of a traditional approach using the finite
element method combined with a numerical optimizer. The models are tested on a
series of increasingly difficult fluid mechanics problems, with and without
noise. We find that while PINNs may require less human effort and specialized
knowledge, they are outperformed by the traditional approach. However, the
difference appears to decrease with higher dimensions and more data. We
identify common failures during training to be addressed if the performance of
PINNs on noisy inverse problems is to become more competitive.

### Discovery of Sustainable Refrigerants through Physics-Informed RL Fine-Tuning of Sequence Models

- **TL;DR**: Refgen是一个结合机器学习与物理基础偏见的生成管道，用于发现新型环保制冷剂，通过强化学习在热力学约束下优化分子设计。

Most refrigerants currently used in air-conditioning systems, such as
hydrofluorocarbons, are potent greenhouse gases and are being phased down.
Large-scale molecular screening has been applied to the search for
alternatives, but in practice only about 300 refrigerants are known, and only a
few additional candidates have been suggested without experimental validation.
This scarcity of reliable data limits the effectiveness of purely data-driven
methods. We present Refgen, a generative pipeline that integrates machine
learning with physics-grounded inductive biases. Alongside fine-tuning for
valid molecular generation, Refgen incorporates predictive models for critical
properties, equations of state, thermochemical polynomials, and full vapor
compression cycle simulations. These models enable reinforcement learning
fine-tuning under thermodynamic constraints, enforcing consistency and guiding
discovery toward molecules that balance efficiency, safety, and environmental
impact. By embedding physics into the learning process, Refgen leverages scarce
data effectively and enables de novo refrigerant discovery beyond the known set
of compounds.

### Quantum Dynamics of Electron Scattering from Skyrmions

- **TL;DR**: 研究电子在手性自旋结构（如斯格明子）中的散射过程，揭示拓扑量子输运的丰富物理现象及其在自旋电子器件中的应用潜力。

Scattering of electrons from chiral spin textures such as the skyrmions is an
emerging research area due to its richness in topological quantum transport,
which is significant for spintronic devices. We study the dynamical process of
scattering of the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particles in the form of Gaussian
wavepackets from skyrmions with the aid of the non-relativistic time-dependent
Schr\"odinger equation. The scattering cross section shows a rich angular
dependence and is deterministically influenced by the iterative flipping of the
spin state inside the skyrmion. The latter leads to a set of non-trivial
outcomes which include finite transmission and reflection probabilities
irrespective of interaction strength, formation of secondary wavefronts
associated with back-converted spin components, and a long-lived quasi-bound
state at the scattering center. In addition to the rich and intriguing physics,
the numerical recipe developed here can be easily adopted for any arbitrary
spin texture, which will prepare a playground to explore tunable spin
transport.

### Roles of Fe-ion irradiation on MgB$_2$ thin films: Structural, superconducting, and optical properties

- **TL;DR**: 研究Fe离子辐照对MgB2薄膜晶体结构和超导性能的影响，发现辐照剂量增加会显著降低超导临界温度Tc，破坏晶体结构并减小电子-声子耦合常数。

The effects of Fe-ion irradiation on the crystal structure and
superconducting properties of MgB$_2$ thin films were investigated. Pristine
samples were prepared using hybrid physical-chemical vapor deposition (HPCVD),
and ion irradiation was performed at three different doses of 5 x 10$^{13}$, 1
x 10$^{14}$, and 2 x 10$^{14}$ ions/cm$^2$. The measured temperature-dependent
resistivity showed that as the irradiation dose increased from pristine to most
irradiated, the superconducting critical temperature, $T_c$, significantly
decreased from 38.33 to 3.02 K. The crystal structures of the films were
investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS)
measurements. The results showed that the higher the dose, the greater the
change in crystal structure, such as the lattice constant and bond length. This
suggests that the destruction of the crystal structure at higher doses leads to
the degradation of superconductivity in the irradiated MgB$_2$ thin films.
Raman spectroscopy showed that the electron-phonon coupling constant decreased
with increasing irradiation dose, which was directly related to the reduction
of $T_c$ in the samples. The optical conductivity indicates that the
charge-carrier density of the $\sigma$-band plays an important role in the
superconductivity of ion-irradiated MgB$_2$.

### Gauge invariance and hyperforce correlation theory for equilibrium fluid mixtures

We formulate gauge invariance for the equilibrium statistical mechanics of
classical multi-component systems. Species-resolved phase space shifting
constitutes a gauge transformation which we analyze using Noether's theorem and
shifting differential operators that encapsulate the gauge invariance. The
approach yields exact equilibrium sum rules for general mixtures.
Species-resolved gauge correlation functions for the force-force and
force-gradient pair correlation structure emerge on the two-body level. Exact
3g-sum rules relate these correlation functions to the spatial Hessian of the
partial pair distribution functions. General observables are associated with
hyperforce densities that measure the covariance of the given observable with
the interparticle, external, and diffusive partial force density observables.
Exact hyperforce and Lie algebra sum rules interrelate these correlation
functions with each other. The practical accessibility of the framework is
demonstrated for binary Lennard-Jones mixtures using both adaptive Brownian
dynamics and grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations. Specifically, we
investigate the force-force pair correlation structure of the Kob-Andersen bulk
liquid and we show results for representative hyperforce correlation functions
in Wilding et al.'s symmetrical mixture confined between two asymmetric planar
parallel walls.

Low-dimensional materials have attractive properties that drive intense
efforts for novel materials discovery. However, experiments are tedious for
systematic discovery, and present computational methods are often tuned to
two-dimensional (2D) materials, overlooking other low-dimensional materials.
Here, we combined universal machine-learning interatomic potentials (UMLIPs)
and an advanced, interatomic force constant (FC) -based dimensionality
classification method to make a massive discovery of novel low-dimensional
materials. We first benchmarked UMLIPs' first-principles-level accuracy in
quantifying FCs and calculated phonons for 35,689 materials from the Materials
Project database. We then used the FC-based method for dimensionality
classification to discover 9139 low-dimensional materials, including 1838 0D
clusters, 1760 1D chains, 3057 2D sheets/layers, and 2484 mixed-dimensionality
materials, all of which conventional geometric descriptors have not recognized.
By calculating the binding energies for the discovered 2D materials, we also
identified 960 sheets that could be easily or potentially exfoliated from their
parent bulk structures.

Quantum computing offers the promise of revolutionizing quantum chemistry by
enabling the solution of chemical problems for substantially less computational
cost. While most demonstrations of quantum computation to date have focused on
resolving the energies of the electronic ground states of small molecules, the
field of quantum chemistry is far broader than ground state chemistry; equally
important to practicing chemists are chemical reaction dynamics and reaction
mechanism prediction. Here, we review progress toward and the potential of
quantum computation for understanding quantum chemistry beyond the ground
state, including for reaction mechanisms, reaction dynamics, and finite
temperature quantum chemistry. We discuss algorithmic and other considerations
these applications share, as well as differences that make them unique. We also
highlight the potential speedups these applications may realize and challenges
they may face. We hope that this discussion stimulates further research into
how quantum computation may better inform experimental chemistry in the future.

### Tunable Electronic Interactions and Weak Antilocalization in Bulk Ge$_2$Sb$_2$Te$_{5-5x}$Se$_{5x}$ Phase Change Materials

Phase change materials (PCMs) are well-known for their reversible and rapid
switching between crystalline and amorphous phases through thermal excitations
mediated by strong electrical or laser pulses. This crystal-to-amorphous
transition is accompanied by a remarkable contrast in optical and electronic
properties, making PCMs useful in nonvolatile data storage applications. Here,
we combine electrical transport and angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy
(ARPES) measurements to study the electronic structure of bulk
Ge$_2$Sb$_2$Te$_{5-5x}$Se$_{5x}$ (GSST) for $0\le x \le 0.8$, where $x$
represents the amount of Se substituting Te in Ge$_2$Sb$_2$Te$_5$ (GST)-- a
prototypical PCM. The single-particle density of states (SDOS) derived from the
integrated ARPES data displays metallic behavior for all $x$, as evidenced by
the presence of a finite density of states in the vicinity of the chemical
potential. Transport measurements also display clear signatures of metallic
transport, consistent with the SDOS data. The temperature dependence of the
resistance indicates the onset of moderate electron-electron Coulomb
interaction effects at low temperatures for $x\geq 0.6$. At the same time, the
magnetoresistance data shows signatures of weak antilocalization for $x\geq
0.6$. An analysis on the temperature dependence of the phase coherence length
suggests that electron dephasing is primarily due to inelastic
electron-electron scattering. We find that these effects are enhanced with
increasing $x$, portraying GSST as a novel PCM where electronic interactions
can be tuned via chemical doping.

Coupled layer constructions are a valuable tool for capturing the universal
properties of certain interacting quantum phases of matter in terms of the
simpler data that characterizes the underlying layers. In the study of fracton
phases, the X-Cube model in 3+1D can be realized via such a construction by
starting with a stack of 2+1D Toric Codes and turning on a coupling which
condenses a composite "particle-string" object. In a recent work
[arXiv:2505.13604], we have demonstrated that in fact, the particle-string can
be viewed as a symmetry defect of a topological 1-form symmetry. In this paper,
we study the result of gauging this symmetry in depth. We unveil a rich gauging
web relating the X-Cube model to symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases
protected by a mix of subsystem and higher-form symmetries, subsystem symmetry
fractionalization in the 3+1D Toric Code, and non-trivial extensions of
topological symmetries by subsystem symmetries. Our work emphasizes the
importance of topological symmetries in non-topological, geometric phases of
matter.

In a two-band system, both conventional sign-preserving $s_{++}$ and
unconventional sign-changing $s_{\pm}$ superconducting state may appear at low
temperatures. Moreover, they may transform from one to another due to the
impurity scattering. To study the details of such a transition here we derive
the expression for the Grand thermodynamic potential $\Omega$ for a two-band
model with nonmagnetic impurities considered in a $\mathcal{T}$-matrix
approximation. For the iron-based materials within the multiband Eliashberg
theory, we show that the $s_{\pm} \to s_{++}$ transition in the vicinity of the
Born limit is a first order phase transition.

Present information and communication technologies are largely based on
electronic devices, which suffer from heat generation and high power
consumption. Alternatives like spintronics and magnonics, which harness the
spin degree of freedom, offer compelling pathways to overcome these fundamental
limitations of charge-based electronics. Magnonics relies on spin waves, the
collective excitations of magnetic moments in magnetically ordered materials,
to achieve processing and transport of information at microwave frequencies
without relying on charge currents. However, efficient means for
all-electrical, high-resolution, semiconductor-compatible readout of
information encoded in spin waves are still missing. Here, we demonstrate the
electrical detection of spin waves using a nanoscale magnetic tunnel junction
(MTJ) cell fabricated in a state-of-the-art complementary
metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) production line. By engineering the dynamic
coupling between spin waves and the magnetization state of the MTJ, we
demonstrate transduction of spin-wave excitations into measurable electrical
signals with high fidelity. Moreover, through these measurements, we find
spectral line widths, associated with nonlinear processes, down to a few
hundreds of kHz, which opens up new perspectives for spin waves as quantum
transducers.

- **TL;DR**: 本文研究了无序自旋1/2 XX梯子模型中弛豫时间尺度与输运性质的关系，发现RMT时间随系统尺寸二次增长，且上界Thouless时间，同时自旋扩散比能量扩散更快。

Understanding the timescales associated with relaxation to equilibrium in
closed quantum many-body systems is one of the central focuses in the study of
their non-equilibrium dynamics. At late times, these relaxation processes
exhibit universal behavior, emerging from the inherent randomness of chaotic
Hamiltonians. In this work, we investigate a disordered spin-$1/2$ XX ladder -
an experimentally realizable model known for its diffusive dynamics - to
explore the connection between transport properties and spectral measures
derived solely from the system's energy levels via these relaxation timescales.
We begin by analyzing the spectral form factor, which yields the time when the
system begins to follow the random matrix theory (RMT) statistics, known as the
RMT time. We then determine the Thouless times - the average times for a local
excitation to diffuse across the entire finite system - through the
linear-response theory for both spin and energy transport. Our numerical
results confirm that the RMT time scales quadratically with system size and
upper bounds the Thouless times. Interestingly, we also find that, unlike other
non-integrable models, spin diffusion proceeds faster than energy diffusion.

The mechanism of resistive switching in two-dimensional (2D)
semiconductor-based memristors is intriguing, and our conventional knowledge of
bulk-oxide based memristors does not apply to these devices. Experimental data
indicate that the genesis of resistive switching may be intrinsic to the 2D
semiconducting active layer, as well as resulting from the movement of
electrode atoms. Employing reactive-force field (ReaxFF) molecular dynamics
simulations, we introduced the "sulphur atom popping model" [npj 2D Mater.
Appl. 5, 33 (2021)] to elucidate the intrinsic nature of non-volatile resistive
switching in 2D molybdenum disulfide-based memristors. In this paper we provide
additional perspective to this model using density functional theory. We also
discuss the limitations of universal machine learning interatomic potentials in
reproducing ReaxFF simulation results.

### SMILES-Inspired Transfer Learning for Quantum Operators in Generative Quantum Eigensolver

Given the inherent limitations of traditional Variational Quantum
Eigensolver(VQE) algorithms, the integration of deep generative models into
hybrid quantum-classical frameworks, specifically the Generative Quantum
Eigensolver(GQE), represents a promising innovative approach. However, taking
the Unitary Coupled Cluster with Singles and Doubles(UCCSD) ansatz which is
widely used in quantum chemistry as an example, different molecular systems
require constructions of distinct quantum operators. Considering the similarity
of different molecules, the construction of quantum operators utilizing the
similarity can reduce the computational cost significantly. Inspired by the
SMILES representation method in computational chemistry, we developed a
text-based representation approach for UCCSD quantum operators by leveraging
the inherent representational similarities between different molecular systems.
This framework explores text pattern similarities in quantum operators and
employs text similarity metrics to establish a transfer learning framework. Our
approach with a naive baseline setting demonstrates knowledge transfer between
different molecular systems for ground-state energy calculations within the GQE
paradigm. This discovery offers significant benefits for hybrid
quantum-classical computation of molecular ground-state energies, substantially
reducing computational resource requirements.

proportional to the scalar product of spins. Dispersion dependence for the spin
waves propagating as the perturbation of the equilibrium state described by
spin cycloid is found. The dielectric permeability as the response on the
electromagnetic perturbations associated with the magneto-electric coupling for
the same equilibrium state is calculated.

### Ab initio investigation on structural stability and phonon-mediated superconductivity in 2D-hydrogenated M2X (M= Mo, V, Zr; X=C, N) MXene monolayer

- **TL;DR**: 本研究对氢化M2X MXene单层材料进行了第一性原理研究，重点关注结构稳定性、电子性质和超导行为。发现部分氢化结构具有动态稳定性，Mo基MXenes表现出强电子-声子耦合和15-22K的超导转变温度，而Zr2CH4则展现出狄拉克物理特性。

We present a comprehensive first-principles study of hydrogenated M2X (M =
Mo, V, Zr; X = C, N) MXene monolayers, focusing on their structural stability,
electronic properties, and superconducting behavior. Structural optimizations
combined with phonon spectra reveal that partial hydrogenation (1H and 2H) is
dynamically stable across most compositions, while full hydrogenation (4H)
generally induces lattice instabilities. A notable exception is Zr2CH4, which
retains dynamical stability even under maximum hydrogen coverage. Electronic
structure analysis shows that all hydrogenated MXenes remain metallic, with the
Fermi level dominated by transition-metal d orbitals. In Zr2CH4, a Dirac-like
band crossing at the Fermi level is observed, which is gapped by spin-orbit
coupling (SOC), yielding a finite gap of 0.095 eV. Electron-phonon coupling
(EPC) calculations demonstrate that Mo-based MXenes exhibit strong EPC, with
coupling constants lambda = 0.95 (Mo2CH), 1.23 (Mo2NH), and 1.55 (Mo2NH2),
corresponding to superconducting critical temperatures Tc about 15 to 22 K
within the Allen-Dynes framework (mu* = 0.10). By contrast, V- and Zr-based
MXenes display weak EPC and negligible Tc, with Zr2CH4 being a special case
hosting Dirac-like states rather than superconductivity. Our findings highlight
hydrogen functionalization as an effective strategy to stabilize MXene
monolayers and to tune their low-energy physics, revealing Mo-based nitride
MXenes as promising phonon-mediated superconductors, while Zr2CH4 emerges as a
candidate for Dirac physics.

### Rapid Autotuning of a SiGe Quantum Dot into the Single-Electron Regime with Machine Learning and RF-Reflectometry FPGA-Based Measurements

- **TL;DR**: 本文提出了一种结合神经网络自动调谐算法和FPGA加速测量的方法，将稳定性图的测量时间减少了9.8倍，使SiGe量子点单电子态初始化总时间加速了2.2倍。

Spin qubits need to operate within a very precise voltage space around charge
state transitions to achieve high-fidelity gates. However, the stability
diagrams that allow the identification of the desired charge states are long to
acquire. Moreover, the voltage space to search for the desired charge state
increases quickly with the number of qubits. Therefore, faster stability
diagram acquisitions are needed to scale up a spin qubit quantum processor.
Currently, most methods focus on more efficient data sampling. Our approach
shows a significant speedup by combining measurement speedup and a reduction in
the number of measurements needed to tune a quantum dot device. Using an
autotuning algorithm based on a neural network and faster measurements by
harnessing the FPGA embedded in Keysight's Quantum Engineering Toolkit (QET),
the measurement time of stability diagrams has been reduced by a factor of 9.8.
This led to an acceleration factor of 2.2 for the total initialization time of
a SiGe quantum dot into the single-electron regime, which is limited by the
Python code execution.

### Computation of the heat capacity of water from first principles

Water is a unique solvent with many remarkable properties. An example is its
exceptionally high heat capacity, which plays an important role in storing and
transporting thermal energy, with implications for many processes from
regulating the body temperature of living organisms to moderating our climate
at the global scale. To elucidate the microscopic origin of the heat capacity
of water from first principles, highly accurate computer simulations are
required. Apart from a reliable description of the atomic interactions, the
presence of light hydrogen atoms necessitates the explicit consideration of
nuclear quantum effects through path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD)
simulations. The high computational costs of PIMD simulations, which are even
further increased by the need for an extensive statistical sampling of energy
fluctuations to determine the heat capacity, can be strongly reduced by
replacing first principles calculations with machine learning potentials to
represent the atomic interactions. In this study, we use high-dimensional
neural network potentials (HDNNPs) constructed from density functional theory
calculations employing the RPBE-D3 and revPBE0-D3 functionals. To further
enhance the computational performance, we introduce a highly efficient PIMD
algorithm computing in parallel not only the energies and forces but also the
coordinate and thermostat time evolutions. Using this approach, we are able to
determine converged data for the heat capacity from a 4 ns simulation employing
128 beads. In particular, for the revPBE0-D3 functional we find excellent
agreement with experiment, providing evidence that our approach represents a
promising framework for the quantitative understanding of the thermodynamic
properties of water and aqueous solutions.

### Intrinsic defect intolerance in the ultra-pure metal PtSn$_4$

- **TL;DR**: PtSn₄是一种天然具有极低缺陷浓度的材料，研究发现其具有内在的缺陷不容忍特性，即使在极端生长条件下也无法显著降低其纯度。

Ultra-pure materials are highly valued as model systems for the study of
intrinsic physics. Frequently, however, the crystal growth of such pristine
samples requires significant optimization. PtSn$_4$ is a rare example of a
material that naturally forms with a very low concentration of crystalline
defects. Here, we investigate the origin of its low defect levels using a
combination of electrical resistivity measurements, computational modeling, and
scanning tunneling microscopy imaging. While typical flux-grown crystals of
PtSn$_4$ can have residual resistivity ratios (RRRs) that can exceed 1000, we
show that even at the most extreme formation speeds, the RRR cannot be
suppressed below 100. This aversion to defect formation extends to both the Pt
and Sn sublattices, which contribute with equal weight to the conduction
properties. Direct local imaging with scanning tunneling microscopy further
substantiates the rarity of point defects, while the prohibitive energetic cost
of forming a defect is demonstrated through density functional theory
calculations. Taken together, our results establish PtSn$_4$ as an
intrinsically defect-intolerant material, making it an ideal platform to study
other properties of interest, including extreme magnetoresistance and topology.

### Strain-tunable anomalous Hall effect in hexagonal MnTe

- **TL;DR**: 本文研究了六方反铁磁锰碲化物(α-MnTe)在单轴应变下的磁畴调控和反常霍尔效应变化，揭示了应变对电子能带结构的调控作用。

The ability to control and manipulate time-reversal ($T$) symmetry-breaking
phases with near-zero net magnetization is a sought-after goal in spintronic
devices. The recently discovered hexagonal altermagnet manganese telluride
($\alpha$-MnTe) is a prime example. It has a compensated $A$-type
antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground state where the in-plane ferromagnetic (FM)
moments in each layer are stacked antiferromagnetically along the $c$ axis, yet
exhibits a spontaneous anomalous Hall effect (AHE) that breaks the $T$-symmetry
with a vanishingly small $c$-axis FM moment. However, the presence of three
120$^\circ$ separated in-plane magnetic domains presents a challenge in
understanding the origin of AHE and the effective control of the altermagnetic
state. Here we use neutron scattering to show that a compressive uniaxial
strain along the next-nearest-neighbor Mn-Mn bond direction detwins
$\alpha$-MnTe into a single in-plane magnetic domain, aligning the in-plane
moments along the same direction. Furthermore, we find that uniaxial strain
(-0.2% to 0.1%) significantly sharpens the magnetic hysteresis loop and
switches the sign of the AHE near room temperature. Remarkably, this is
achieved without altering the AFM phase-transition temperature, which can only
be explained by a strain-induced modification of the electronic band structure.
Our work not only unambiguously establishes the relationship between the
in-plane moment direction and the AHE in $\alpha$-MnTe but also paves the way
for future applications in highly scalable, strain-tunable magnetic sensors and
spintronic devices.

We present a comprehensive first-principles investigation of the structural
stability, vibrational characteristics, and superconducting properties of the
Janus Ti2CSH monolayer. Janus MXene (JMXene) materials, such as Ti2CSH, have
attracted significant attention due to their intrinsic two-dimensional
structure and the absence of out-of-plane symmetry, which give rise to novel
physical phenomena. Phonon calculations confirm the dynamical stability of the
monolayer, while electronic structure and electron-phonon coupling analyses
reveal a strong phonon-mediated pairing mechanism. Anisotropic
Migdal-Eliashberg theory predicts a single-gap superconducting state, with gap
values between 4.29 and 4.71 meV at 10 K and a critical temperature Tc of 22.6
K. These findings establish Ti2CSH as a promising two-dimensional
superconductor with potential applications in quantum and nanoscale
technologies.

We experimentally observe the generation of magnon harmonics and subharmonics
in an on-chip surface acoustic wave resonator incorporating a thin
Co$_{20}$Fe$_{60}$B$_{20}$ film, using micro-focused Brillouin light
scattering. In our devices, rotating the in-plane magnetic field allows
continuous tuning of the magnon-phonon coupling from weak to strong within the
same resonator. In the weak coupling regime, we only observe fundamental
magnetoelastic wave signal at $f_{1}$. Conversely, in the strong coupling
regime, in addition to the fundamental magnetoelastic wave, we observe
subharmonic and harmonic signals at $3/2f_{1}$, $2f_{1}$, and $3f_{1}$, which
are well reproduced by our analytical model. Our results establish phonons as a
means to generate and control nonlinear magnons in the strong coupling regime,
providing a new route for magnonic signal processing.

Topological phenomena in quantum critical systems have recently attracted
growing attention, as they go beyond the traditional paradigms of condensed
matter and statistical physics. However, a general framework for identifying
such nontrivial phenomena, particularly in higher-dimensional systems, remains
insufficiently explored. In this Letter, we propose a universal fingerprint for
detecting nontrivial topology in critical free-fermion systems protected by
global on-site symmetries. Specifically, we analytically establish an exact
relation between the bulk entanglement spectrum and the boundary energy
spectrum at topological criticality in arbitrary dimensions, demonstrating that
the degeneracy of edge modes can be extracted from the bulk entanglement
spectrum. These findings, further supported by numerical simulations of lattice
models, provide a universal fingerprint for identifying nontrivial topology in
critical free-fermion systems.

### Colossal Effect of Nanopore Surface Ionic Charge on the Dynamics of Confined Water

Interfacial interactions significantly alter the fundamental properties of
water confined in mesoporous structures, with crucial implications for
geological, physicochemical, and biological processes. Herein, we focused on
the effect of changing the surface ionic charge of nanopores with comparable
pore size (3.5-3.8 nm) on the dynamics of confined liquid water. The control of
the pore surface ionicity was achieved by using two periodic mesoporous
organosilicas (PMOs) containing either neutral or charged forms of a chemically
similar bridging unit. The effect on the dynamics of water at the nanoscale was
investigated in the temperature range of 245 -300 K, encompassing the glass
transition by incoherent quasielastic neutron scattering (QENS), For both types
of PMOs, the water dynamics revealed two distinct types of molecular motions:
rapid local movements and translational jump diffusion. While the neutral PMO
induces a moderate confinement effect, we show that the charged PMO drastically
slows down water dynamics, reducing translational diffusion by a factor of four
and increasing residence time by an order of magnitude. Notably, by changing
the pore filling values, we demonstrate that for charged pore this effect
extends beyond the interfacial layer of surface-bound water molecules to
encompass the entire pore volume. Thus, our observation indicates a dramatic
change in the long-range character of the interaction of water confined in
nanopores with surface ionic charge compared to a simple change in
hydrophilicity. This is relevant for the understanding of a broad variety of
applications in (nano)technological phenomena and processes, such as
nanofiltration and membrane design.

### The orbital-driven topological phase transition and planar Hall responses in ternary tellurides Weyl semi-metals

Here we study electronic properties of the ternary tellurides TaXTe$_4$
(X=Rh, Ir) using density functional theory and investigate chiral anomaly
mediated planar Hall response from ab initio calculations. We show that
TaRhTe$_4$ is a hybrid Weyl semimetal (WSM), hosting Weyl points (WPs) of both
type-I, type-II, while TaIrTe$_4$ is a type-II WSM as it hosts only type-II WPs
with spin-orbit couplings (SOC). All WPs lie in the $k_z=0$ plane, and remain
well-separated in both momentum and energy landscape. We observe long Fermi
arcs connecting Weyl nodes of opposite chirality. We report both SOC and
orbital driven topological phase transition in ternary tellurides. TaIrTe$_4$
undergoes topological phase transition under SOC. Whereas orbital driven
topological phase transition due to d$_{xz}$ orbital has been observed in
TaRhTe$_4$ even without SOC. Furthermore, the evolution of the band structures
and the annihilation of WPs due to d$_{xz}$-Ir/Rh orbitals associated with the
phase transitions in TaXTe$_4$ are also discussed. This systematic study opens
new routes for engineering topological materials relying beyond strong SOC and
sheds light on the possible role of correlation effects originating from
orbital orbital degree of freedoms in tellurides. We further report an
enhancement of planar Hall effects due to orbital driven topological phase
transition in TaXTe$_4$ and we make resort to a tight-binding model to
correlate the above findings with the effective mass anisotropy in different
types of WSMs.

We report nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) Knight shift measurements of the
In(1) and In(2) sites in CeRhIn$_5$ as a function of pressure. In contrast to
the $c$ axis, the in-plane components of the In(1) Knight shift tensor exhibit
little to no pressure dependence. These results indicate that the dipolar
component of the tensor is strongly suppressed at the In(1) site, while it
remains constant with pressure at the In(2) site. We analyze the hyperfine
coupling in terms of a tight binding model for the electronic structure, and
determine that the pressure dependence of the In(1) shift cannot be explained
in terms of changes to the crystal field parameters, but rather can be
understood in terms of an increase in the 4f electron content at the Fermi
surface. Our results indicate that the hyperfine coupling reflects changes in
the electronic structure near a Kondo breakdown quantum critical point.

Reaching a consensus on the superconducting order parameter of unconventional
superconductors remains a central challenge in the field of
magnetically-mediated superconductivity. Though UTe$_{2}$ is largely accepted
as a rare example of an odd-parity superconductor, its precise order parameter
remains highly debated, even at ambient conditions. A key underlying issue is
the large sample-to-sample variation in superconducting properties at zero
applied pressure and magnetic field. Here, we investigate the origin of the
observed variation by means of single crystal x-ray diffraction (SC-XRD) and
scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) measurements. Our results
reveal highly ordered crystalline lattices, in agreement with the expected
$Immm$ structure, and no signs of uranium vacancies. Tiny amounts of
interstitial defects, however, are observed on the Te2 layers that host Te
chains along the b axis. We argue that these defects give rise to slightly
enhanced atomic displacement parameters observed in SC-XRD data and are enough
to disrupt the unconventional superconducting state in UTe$_{2}$. Our findings
highlight the need to focus future order parameter determination efforts on
single crystals of UTe$_{2}$ with minimal amounts of structural disorder.

Quantum states naturally represent symmetry groups, though often in a
projective sense. Intriguingly, the projective nature of crystalline symmetries
has remained underexplored until very recently. A series of groundbreaking
theoretical and experimental studies have now brought this to light,
demonstrating that projective representations of crystal symmetries lead to
remarkable consequences in condensed matter physics and various artificial
crystals, particularly in their connection to topological phenomena. In this
article, we explain the basic ideas and notions underpinning these recent
developments and share our perspective on this emerging research area. We
specifically highlight that the appearance of momentum-space nonsymmorphic
symmetry is a unique feature of projective crystal symmetry representations.
This, in turn, has the profound consequence of reducing the fundamental domain
of momentum space to all possible flat compact manifolds, which include torus
and Klein bottle in 2D and the ten platycosms in 3D, presenting a significantly
richer landscape for topological structures than conventional settings.
Finally, the ongoing efforts and promising future research directions are
discussed.

Energy decomposition analysis (EDA) based on absolutely localized molecular
orbitals provides detailed insights into intermolecular bonding by decomposing
the total molecular binding energy into physically meaningful components. Here,
we develop a neural network EDA model capable of predicting the electron
delocalization energy component of water molecules, which captures the
stabilization arising from charge transfer between occupied absolutely
localized molecular orbitals of one molecule and the virtual orbitals of
another. Exploiting the locality assumption of the electronic structure, our
model enables accurate prediction of electron delocalization energies for
molecular systems far beyond the size accessible to conventional density
functional theory calculations, while maintaining its accuracy. We demonstrate
the applicability of our approach by modeling hydration effects in large
molecular complexes, specifically in metal-organic frameworks.

### Phase Stability and Superconductivity in Hydrogenated and Lithiated Janus GaXS2 (X = Ga, In) Monolayers

Hydrogen and lithium functionalization of two-dimensional (2D) materials
offers a promising route to enhance electronic properties and induce
superconductivity. Here, we employ first-principles calculations to explore the
phase stability and superconducting behavior of hydrogenated and lithiated
Janus GaXS2 (X = Ga, In) monolayers. Among Ga2SH, Ga2SLi, GaInSH, and GaInSLi,
only the 2H-GaInSLi structure is dynamically, thermally, and mechanically
stable, as confirmed by phonon dispersion, ab initio molecular dynamics, and
elastic constants. This monolayer adopts a hexagonal lattice, exhibits metallic
behavior, and has a negative formation energy, suggesting experimental
feasibility. Anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg analysis reveals phonon-mediated
superconductivity with a critical temperature Tc of 4.8 K. Notably, three
distinct superconducting gaps emerge, linked to specific atomic orbitals and
phonon modes. Electron doping of 0.2 e per cell increases Tc to nearly 6.2 K
while maintaining the three-gap character. These results highlight the
effectiveness of selective functionalization in engineering superconductivity
and identify GaInSLi as a promising platform for next-generation multi-gap 2D
superconducting devices.

### Hybridization gap and $f$-electron effect evolutions with Cd- and Sn-doping in CeCoIn$_5$ via infrared spectroscopy

We investigated hole (Cd)- and electron (Sn)-doped CeCoIn$_5$
(CeCo(In$_{1-x}T_x$)$_5$ ($T$ = Cd or Sn)) using infrared spectroscopy.
Doping-dependent hybridization gap distribution functions were obtained from
the optical conductivity spectra based on the periodic Anderson model
formalism. The hybridization gap distribution exhibits two components: in-plane
and out-of-plane hybridization gaps. The doping-dependent evolution of the two
gaps indicated that the out-of-plane gap was more sensitive to doping.
Furthermore, the magnetic optical resistivity exhibited a doping-dependent
evolution of the $f$-electron amplitude. The two dopant types exhibited
different physical properties depending on the level of doping. The Sn dopant
increases the $f$-electron amplitude, whereas the Cd dopant does not affect the
$f$-electron amplitude. Doping-dependent effective mass is peaked at pure (or
undoped) CeCoIn$_5$. Our spectroscopic results may help understand the
doping-dependent electronic evolution of one of the canonical heavy fermion
systems, CeCoIn$_5$.

### Solution of the Anderson chain with two-particle hybridization of localized and itinerant electrons

- **TL;DR**: 本文提出了一种改进的安德森晶格模型，用双粒子杂化替代了原始安德森模型中的单粒子杂化。该模型可通过Bethe ansatz求解，研究发现局域电子与巡游电子的双粒子杂化会产生巡游电子之间的有效在位相互作用，其强度和符号取决于局域电子双粒子态能级相对于费米能级的位置。当该能级高于费米能级时产生吸引相互作用，低于时产生排斥相互作用，这种机制可能为高温超导提供理论基础。

A modified Anderson lattice is proposed, whose the Hamiltonian accounts for
the two-particle hybridization of localized and itinerant electrons instead of
one-particle hybridization which takes into account in the original Anderson
model. The 1D version of this model can be solved using the Bethe ansazt. It
has been shown that hybridization between itinerant and frozen localized
electrons results in an effective on-site interaction between itinerant
electrons. The magnitude and sign of this interaction depend on the position of
the level relative to the Fermi energy (the energy of this level corresponds to
the two-particle state of localized electrons at a site). It is shown that when
the energy of an localized electron in the two-particle state lies above the
Fermi energy, the effective on-site interaction between itinerant electrons is
attractive. A repulsive interaction between itinerant electrons occurs when
this energy lies below the Fermi energy. Thus, two-part hybridization between
localized and itinerant electrons can lead to effective attraction between
itinerant electrons, which is unique in itself and may underlie the nature of
high-temperature superconductivity.

Magnonic waveguide based on domain wall (DW) is considered as a crucial
breakthrough toward the realization of magnonic nanocircuits. However, the
effective control of spin waves propagating in DWs remains to be explored.
Here, we construct a magnonic crystal (MC) by using a chain of the domain wall
skyrmions (DWSKs) to manipulate the spin-wave propagation in DWs. We show that
the DWSK chain can be created by leveraging voltage-controlled
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. The DWSK-based MC opens magnonic bandgaps,
which can be dynamically adjusted through magnetic fields modulating the DWSK
size. Furthermore, the manipulation of spin waves by the DWSK-based MC
maintains robust in curved DW, demonstrating its adaptability to complex device
architectures. Our work provides an effective method to control the spin-wave
propagation in DWs and paves the way for designing energy-efficient magnonic
nanocircuits.

The characterization of nanostructued materials under reactive environments
is challenging due to the complexity of the structural motifs involved and
their chemical transformations. Global optimization approaches allow predicting
stable structures for targeted materials but addressing the configurational and
compositional search spaces is both computationally demanding and inefficient,
especially when first principles calculations are required. In this work, we
implement and evaluate a computationally efficient grand canonical global
optimization algorithm able to identify stable structures and chemical states
of targeted systems under given reaction conditions (e.g. reactant pressure and
temperature). The algorithm leverages an on-the-fly trained machine-learning
interatomic potential based on sparse Gaussian Process Regression and the
smooth overlap of atomic positions descriptor to reduce the number of first
principles energy evaluations carried out during global optimization searches.
The \textit{ab initio} thermodynamics framework is incorporated to approximate
the Gibbs energy of evaluated candidates, performing environment-aware
optimizations over multiple stoichiometries. We demonstrate the computational
performance of this approach and its ability to reproduce some literature
examples.

Semiconductor heterostructures capable of separating photogenerated electrons
and holes have a wide range of optoelectronic applications, including
photodetectors, solar cells, and photocatalysts. ${\beta}$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ and
rutile GeO$_2$ are both ultrawide-bandgap semiconductors, with bandgaps of 4.85
eV and 4.68 eV, respectively. In this work, we employ first-principles
calculations based on density functional theory to investigate the band
alignment of the ${\beta}$-Ga$_2$O$_3$/rutile GeO$_2$ heterojunction and
explore the effect of interfacial oxygen vacancy. Calculations using the PBE0
hybrid functional based on an interface model show that a type-II band
alignment emerges at the ${\beta}$-Ga$_2$O$_3$/rutile GeO$_2$ interface, which
facilitates the separation of photogenerated carriers. The valence band maximum
of ${\beta}$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ lies 0.38 eV below that of rutile GeO$_2$, and its
conduction band minimum lies 0.36 eV below. The presence of interfacial oxygen
vacancy in the stable configuration leads to a reduction in the band offset.
Our results suggest that the ${\beta}$-Ga$_2$O$_3$/rutile GeO$_2$
heterojunction holds significant promise for application in strictly
solar-blind photodetectors.

### Holographic Aspects of Dynamical Mean-Field Theory

Dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) is one of the most standard theoretical
frameworks for addressing strongly correlated electron systems. Meanwhile, the
concept of holography, developed in the field of quantum gravity, provides an
intrinsic relationship between quantum many-body systems and space-time
geometry. In this study, we demonstrate that these two theories are closely
related to each other by shedding light on holographic aspects of DMFT,
particularly for electrons with a semicircle density of states. We formulate a
holographic renormalization group for the branch Green's function from the
outer edge to the interior of the Bethe lattice network, and then find that its
fixed point can be interpreted as a self-consistent solution of Green's
function in DMFT. By introducing an effective two-dimensional anti-de Sitter
space, moreover, we clarify that the scaling dimensions for the branch Green's
function and the boundary correlation functions of electrons at the outer edge
of the Bethe lattice network are characterized by the fixed-point Green's
function. We also perform DMFT computations for the Bethe-lattice Hubbard
model, which illustrate that the scaling dimensions capture the Mott transition
in the deep interior.

### $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant in three-dimensional PT- and PC-symmetric class CI band structures

We construct a previously missing $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant for
three-dimensional band structures in symmetry class CI defined by parity-time
(PT) and parity-particle-hole (PC) symmetries. PT symmetry allows one to define
a real Berry connection and, based on the $\eta$-invariant, a
spin-Chern--Simons (spin-CS) action. We show that PC symmetry quantizes the
spin-CS action to $\{0,2\pi\}$ with $4\pi$ periodicity, thereby yielding a
well-defined $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant. This invariant is additive under direct
sums of isolated band structures, reduces to a known $\mathbb{Z}_2$ index when
a global Takagi factorization exists, and in general depends on the choice of
spin structure. Finally, we demonstrate lattice models in which this newly
introduced $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant distinguishes topological phases that
cannot be detected by the previously known topological indices.

### Enhanced White-Light Emission from Self-Trapped Excitons in Antimony and Bismuth Halides through Structural Design

Lead halide perovskites have catalyzed the rise of main-group metal halide
materials as promising candidates for next-generation optoelectronics,
including solar cells, light-emitting diodes, lasers, sensors, and
photocatalysts. Among these, effi-cient light-emission arises from self-trapped
excitons, wherein excited states induce transient lattice distortions that
localize excitons. However, the complex interplay of factors, such as lattice
distortions, lattice softness, and electron-phonon cou-pling dynamics, obscures
the direct structure-property relationships complicating the targeted material
design. In this study, we advance the understanding of self-trapped exciton
(STE)-based emission in hybrid antimony and bismuth halides, em-phasizing the
interplay of structural and electronic factors that enhance white-light
emission. We systematically vary com-position, anion dimensionality,
connectivity, and the organic cation and find that the presence of Bi/Sb and Cl
in edge-sharing anion motifs promotes white-light emission and optimal
electron-phonon coupling. Chlorides outperform bromides, and organic cations,
such as CMA and BZA, only subtly influence optical behavior by altering lattice
dynamics and rigidity, resulting in tunable emission characteristics without
compromising STEs. This work deepens the understanding of the emis-sion
mechanisms in hybrid halide perovskites and establishes guiding principles for
tailoring optoelectronic properties, paving the way for advanced materials with
enhanced white-light emission for next-generation optoelectronic applications.

Atomically-resolved Z-contrast and strain mappings are used to extract a

Moir\'e superlattices host a rich variety of correlated topological states,
including interaction-driven integer and fractional Chern insulators. A common
approach to study interacting ground states at integer fillings is the
Hartree-Fock mean-field method. However, this method neglects dynamical
correlations, which often leads to an overestimation of spontaneous symmetry
breaking and fails to provide quantitative descriptions of single-particle
excitations. This work introduces a general many-body perturbation framework
for moir\'e systems, combining all-band Hartree-Fock calculations with random
phase approximation (RPA) correlation energies and $GW$ quasiparticle
corrections. We apply this framework to moir\'e superlattice consisted of
rhombohedral pentalayer graphene aligned with hexagonal boron nitride. Our
all-band Hartree-Fock calculations, which include all plane-wave components up
to the high-energy cutoff of the continuum model, reveal a phase diagram at
moir\'e filling $\nu=1$ that qualitatively aligns with experimental
measurements. Incorporating RPA correlation energy further yields quantitative
agreement with the evolution of transport properties across electric fields.
The $GW$ quasiparticle bands exhibit significantly reduced gaps and bandwidths
compared to Hartree-Fock results, while quasiparticle weights close to unity
indicate that the ground state is well-described by a Slater determinant,
justifying the qualitative effectiveness of mean-field approaches for integer
fillings in this system. Our versatile framework provides a systematic
beyond-mean-field approach applicable to generic moir\'e systems.

The fundamental role of magnetic materials in modern science and technology
has driven a rapid surge in research on unconventional magnetism in recent
years. In particular, altermagnets, which simultaneously exhibit zero net
magnetization in real space and anisotropic spin splitting in momentum space,
have garnered significant interest for both fundamental physics and
technological applications. Among these, $\mathrm{RuO_{2}}$ stands as the
pioneering and most extensively studied altermagnet. While the intrinsic
magnetic order of $\mathrm{RuO_{2}}$ is still a subject of active debate,
numerous exotic phenomena characteristic of altermagnetism have been observed
in $\mathrm{RuO_{2}}$ samples. In this review, we explore each facet of the
altermagnetism through specific case studies in $\mathrm{RuO_{2}}$,
systematically surveying its crystal and magnetic structures, electronic band
properties, and transport phenomena. We critically assess the debate
surrounding the intrinsic magnetism in $\mathrm{RuO_{2}}$, incorporating
evidence from altermagnetic signatures in transport, as well as contrasting
results from magnetic and spectroscopic measurements. Finally, possible future
research directions in this field are discussed.

Classical spin liquids are frustrated magnetic phases characterized by local
constraints, flat bands in reciprocal space, and emergent gauge structures with
distinctive signatures such as pinch points. These arise generally in
\emph{cluster systems}, where spin interactions can be expressed as constraints
on clusters of spins. In this work we present the different generic rules
allowing to build such cluster systems together with a few tools allowing to
quickly characterize it. We show that based on these rules, it is possible to
conceive a tunable recipe for generating such models by decorating a parent
lattice on its bonds and/or vertices with symmetry-compatible clusters. This
approach highlights a key design trade-off: using fewer cluster types increases
the number of flat bands and enhances spin-liquid behavior, but produces denser
connectivity that is harder to realize experimentally. The framework is highly
tunable, extends naturally to two and three dimensions, and provides a
versatile toolbox for engineering new classical spin-liquid candidates with
targeted features such as higher-rank pinch points or pinch lines.

Graphene, through the coexistence of large cyclotron gaps and small spin and
valley gaps, offers the possibility to study the breakdown of the quantum Hall
effect across a wide range of energy scales. In this work, we investigate the
breakdown of the QHE in high-mobility graphene Corbino devices under broadband
excitation ranging from DC up to 10 GHz. We find that the conductance is
consistently described by variable range hopping (VRH) and extract the hopping
energies from both temperature and field-driven measurements. Using VRH
thermometry, we are able to distinguish between a cold and hot electron regime,
which are dominated by non-ohmic VRH and Joule heating, respectively. Our
results demonstrate that breakdown in the quantum Hall regime of graphene is
governed by a crossover from non-ohmic, field-driven VRH to ohmic,
Joule-heating-dominated transport.

Few-layer $\alpha$-In$_2$Se$_3$ has been studied under pressure using Raman
spectroscopy in a diamond anvil cell up to 60 GPa (at room temperature). A
combination of AFM and Raman was used to estimate the thickness of the
specimens. While few-layer $\alpha$-In$_2$Se$_3$ shows identical structural
evolution with the one of the bulk powder-like form of $\alpha$-In$_2$Se$_3$ (
$\alpha$ $\rightarrow$ $\beta^{'}$ $\rightarrow$ IV ), an abrupt $\beta^{'}$
$\rightarrow$ IV phase transition (at 45 GPa) was observed, in contrast with
the case of the bulk specimen where the two phases coexist over a wide pressure
range. This is attributed to the difference in specimens morphology, $i.e.$
single crystal and powder in the case of few-layer and bulk
$\alpha$-In$_2$Se$_3$, respectively. This study documents the significance of
specimens morphology on the observed pressure-induced phase transitions. The
methodology developed in this study for performing high-pressure Raman
measurements can be applied to other nanodimensional layered materials.

Topological superconductor is regarded as an ideal candidate for topological
quantum computing due to its ability to simulate the enigmatic Majorana
fermions that satisfy non-Abelian statistics. Previous studies revealed that
symmetry exerts an unbreakable constraint on the existence, classes, and orders
of Majorana modes. It severely limits the controllability and application of
Majorana modes. Here, we propose a Floquet-engineering method to break this
symmetry-imposed constraint on topological phases. By applying periodic driving
on a system belonging to a symmetry class that prohibits the existence of
first-order topological phases, we find that rich first-order Majorana modes
are created. Interestingly, exotic hybrid-order topological superconductors
with coexisting first-order Majorana boundary modes and second-order Majorana
corner modes not only in two different quasienergy gaps but also in one single
gap are generated at ease by the periodic driving. Refreshing the prevailing
understanding of symmetry constraint on topological phases, our result opens an
avenue for the creation of exotic topological superconductors without altering
symmetries. It greatly expands the scope of the fabricated materials that host
topological superconductor.

Non-relativistic spin splitting in antiferromagnets has recently attracted
considerable attention. Here we present a universal framework for controlling
such spin splitting by identifying and manipulating the key atomic distortions
that govern it through external perturbations. We demonstrate this concept by
tuning the spin-splitting energy in three representative materials with diverse
symmetries, inversion-symmetric MnF$_2$, ferroelectric BaCuF$_4$, and
LaMnO$_3$/RMnO$_3$ superlattices. Our results emphasize the essential role of
higher-order magnetic multipoles and the intrinsic structure-spin correlations
in these systems, thereby advancing current efforts to control spin splitting
in real materials and motivating future experimental studies.

### Resistive switching behaviors in vertically aligned MoS$_2$ films with Cu, Ag, and Au electrodes

- **TL;DR**: 该研究探讨了垂直排列MoS2薄膜与不同金属电极（Ag、Cu、Au）的忆阻特性，发现不同金属电极表现出截然不同的开关行为，为神经形态计算应用提供了重要见解。

Neuromorphic computing circuits can be realized using memristors based on
low-dimensional materials enabling enhanced metal diffusion for resistive
switching. Here, we investigate memristive properties of vertically aligned
MoS$_2$ (VA-MoS$_2$) films with three different metal electrodes: Ag, Cu, and
Au. Despite having the same active material, all three metals show distinct
switching behavior, which are crucial for neuromorphic computing applications:
Ag enables volatile switching, Cu demonstrates stable non-volatile switching
with retention over 2500 s, and Au shows no memristive response. Cu devices
show abrupt resistance changes, and significant increase of copper content upon
biasing, indicative of stable non-volatile switching based on filament
formation and rupture. About 85% of Ag and Cu devices exhibit reliable
memristor behavior. Our findings provide valuable insights into the memristive
switching mechanism in VA-MoS$_2$ and present a promising avenue for facile
fabrication of neuromorphic circuits by employing a set of different metals on
a single active material.

We report a random singlet ground state in the $S = \frac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg
pyrochlore antiferromagnet NaCdCu$_2$F$_7$. Cationic Na$^+$/Cd$^{2+}$ disorder
generates a broad distribution of Cu$^{2+}$-F$^{-}$-Cu$^{2+}$ exchange
couplings. Despite strong antiferromagnetic interactions, no magnetic order or
freezing occurs, with $\mu$SR measurements confirming dynamics down to 58 mK.
$T$-linear specific heat, a Curie-like susceptibility tail, and universal
power-law scaling with data collapse in $\chi(T)$, $M(H)$, $C_{\rm mag}/T$,
$^{23}$Na $(1/T_1T)$ and $\lambda_{\rm LF}$ demonstrate a disorder-driven
network of singlets and orphan spins, distinct from a clean quantum spin
liquid.

The quantum Hall effect hosts quantum phase transitions in which the
localization length, that is the size of disorder-induced bulk localized
states, is governed by universal scaling from percolation theory. However, this
universal character is not systematically observed in experiments, including
very recent ones in extremely clean devices. Here we explore this
non-universality by systematically measuring the localization length in
broken-symmetry quantum Hall states of graphene. Depending on the nature and
gap size of these states, we observe differences of up to a tenfold in the
minimum localization length, accompanied by clear deviations from universal
scaling. Our results, as well as the previously observed non-universality, are
fully captured by a simple picture based on the co-existence of localized
states from two successive sub-Landau levels.

### Multipole analysis of spin currents in altermagnetic MnTe

Altermagnets, a class of unconventional antiferromagnets where antiparallel
spins are connected by combined rotational and translational symmetries, have
recently emerged as promising candidates for spintronic applications, as they
can efficiently generate spin currents while maintaining vanishing net
magnetization. Here, we investigate charge transport and spin currents in
$\alpha$-MnTe, a prototypical altermagnet, using symmetry analysis within the
multipole framework and fully relativistic first-principles calculations using
the Kubo formalism. Our results show that different magnetic configurations
with N\'eel vectors $\hat{N}\parallel y$ and $\hat{N}\parallel x$ in MnTe
induce distinct order parameters. This distinction gives rise to spin-momentum
locking with different parities and magnetic spin Hall effects (magnetic SHEs)
with different anisotropies. Strikingly, our calculations show that the
combination of intrinsic spin-orbit coupling and altermagnetic spin splitting
yields a large magnetic spin Hall angle of up to 16 \% rivaling or exceeding
that of heavy metals such as Pt. On the other hand, the anisotropy of the
magnetic SHE provides a practical means to identify the type of order
parameter. This establishes, through the powerful framework of multipoles, a
general approach for studying transport phenomena that extends to a broader
class of altermagnets beyond MnTe.

### Inelastic scattering and transient localization from coupling to two-level systems

We consider an electron interacting locally with two-level systems (TLSs) as
an archetypal model for charge transport in the presence of inelastic
scatterers. To assess the importance of quantum effects in the optical and d.c.
conductivity we solve the model numerically without approximations using the
finite temperature Lanczos method (FTLM), and compare the results with
Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT). In the slow fluctuation limit, the coupling
to the TLSs causes transient localization of the carriers analogous to the one
recently found in the electron-boson scattering problem, featuring enhanced
resistivities and displaced Drude peaks. Fast inelastic scatterers suppress
localization, restoring a more conventional regime where transport and optical
properties are governed by independent scattering events.

### Effects of correlated hopping on thermoelectric response of a quantum dot strongly coupled to ferromagnetic leads

We theoretically investigate the impact of correlated hopping on
thermoelectric transport through a quantum dot coupled to ferromagnetic leads.
Using the accurate numerical renormalization group method, we analyze the
transport characteristics, focusing on the interplay between electronic
correlations, spin-dependent transport processes, and thermoelectric response.
We calculate the electrical conductance and thermopower as functions of the dot
energy level, lead polarization, and the amplitude of correlated hopping.
Moreover, we analyze the effect of competing correlations on the Kondo
resonance and discuss the asymmetry of conductance peaks under the influence of
the exchange field. We demonstrate that the presence of correlated hopping is
responsible for asymmetric spin-dependent transport characteristics. Our
results provide valuable insight into how correlated hopping affects
spin-dependent transport and thermoelectric efficiency in quantum dot systems
with ferromagnetic contacts.

We uncover a previously overlooked contribution to the electro-optic Kerr
rotation of reflected light, arising from the interplay of matter, the static
electric field, and the magnetic component of light. Remarkably, this mechanism
dominates in isotropic nonmagnetic homogeneous metals. We derive analytical
expressions for the Kerr rotation in both two-dimensional layers and
semi-infinite systems. Within the relaxation-time approximation, we predict
experimentally accessible signal magnitudes. This intrinsic mechanism thereby
opens new opportunities for probing electronic properties in materials through
Kerr spectroscopy.

### Climbing the ladder: a method for identifying promising copper-lead apatites

We develop a DFT screening procedure for copper-substituted lead apatites of
the composition Pb$_9$Cu(XO$_4$)$_6$Y that enforces three design rules:
thermodynamic stability, Cu site preference, and symmetry robustness of the
near-Fermi electronic structure. A convex-hull analysis over P/V/As as X,
O/F/Cl/Br as Y, identifies vanadates as the only members on or beneath the
hull. Across the family, Cu substitution at Pb$^{\text{I}}$ ($4f$) preserves
flat bands at E$_F$, whereas Pb$^{\text{I}}$ ($6h$) either gaps or severely
distorts them. Small symmetry-lowering relaxations ($P3 \rightarrow P1$) are
also capable of opening the band gap, motivating symmetry robustness as a
filter. Applying these criteria singles out Pb$_9$Cu(VO$_4$)$_6$Br$_2$ (and,
possibly, Cl$_2$) as leading candidates. This work motivates experimental study
of the selected compounds, as well as a dedicated study of strong correlations.

- **TL;DR**: 本研究合成了Ti_{0.85}Fe6Ge6单晶，预期会表现出kagome电荷密度波行为，但实验未观察到CDW特征。理论计算显示其电子结构与相关化合物显著不同，Ti-Ge1b强共价键和Fe-Fe反键态抑制了CDW形成。

Kagome materials with charge density waves (CDWs) are fascinating quantum
systems, offering an ideal platform to explore intertwined orders and to
uncover novel mechanisms behind CDW formation. Chemical models have been
developed and applied to predict CDW in $AM_6X_6$-type kagome materials, such
as the rattling chain model based on ScV6Sn6 and the magnetic energy-saving
model based on FeGe. In this study, we successfully synthesized Ti_{0.85}Fe6Ge6
single crystals using the vapor transport method. As predicted by the rattling
chain model, these crystals are expected to exhibit kagome CDW behavior.
Magnetization measurements indicate that Ti_{0.85}Fe6Ge6 is an easy-axis
antiferromagnet with T_N = 488 K and transport measurements reveal metallic
behavior primarily driven by electron-type carriers. However, no clear
signatures of a CDW were observed in Ti_{0.85}Fe6Ge6. Density functional theory
calculations demonstrate a markedly distinct electronic structure compared to
related compounds: instead of a carrier-doping-induced rigid shift, the density
of states shifted away from the Fermi level. Consistent with our structural
investigations, the absence of a CDW and the unusual band structure can be
attributed to the bonding characteristic within Ti_{0.85}Fe6Ge6. The strong
covalent bonds of Ti-Ge1b, along with the solid Ge1b-Ge1b dimers, prevent the
Ti-Ge1b-Ge1b-Ti chain from rattling. The presence of Fe-Fe antibonding state at
the Fermi level enhances the spin polarization and depletes the electronic
density around the Fermi level. Our results suggest that both the ionic radius
and the bonding characteristics of the filler atom are crucial for the
formation of CDWs in kagome materials. These factors can serve as supplementary
terms to the rattling chain model, providing new insights for the discovery of
novel kagome CDW materials.

### Spin-polaron fingerprints in the optical conductivity of iridates

As a consequence of their spin-orbit entangled ground state, many $5d^{5}$
iridate materials display a peculiar double peak structure in optical transport
quantities, such as absorption and conductivity. Their common interpretation is
based on the presence of Hubbard subbands in the half-filled
$j_{\mathrm{eff}}=1/2$ manifold. Herein, we challenge this picture, proposing a
scenario based on the presence of spin-polaron (SP) quasiparticles, and
assigning a dominant SP character to the first peak. We illustrate it by taking
the materials Ba$_2$IrO$_4$ and Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ as paradigmatic examples, which
we investigate within the dynamical mean-field theory and the self-consistent
Born approximation. Both theories reproduce nontrivial features revealed by
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and optical transport measurements,
supporting our interpretation. In the case of Sr$_2$IrO$_4$, we show how the SP
scenario survives in the low-doped regime. Similar optical transport
fingerprints are expected to be found in the wider class of $5d^5$ iridates and
more generally in strongly correlated antiferromagnetic regimes, such as those
found in cuprates.

Using the density functional tight binding method (DFTB) and the GFN1-xTB
(Geometries, Frequencies, and Noncovalent interactions Tight Binding)
Hamiltonian, we have investigated the structural, electronic and magnetic
properties of vacancy defects, hydrogen and oxygen passivated defects, and Fe
adsorption in two-dimensional (2D) graphitic carbon nitride (gt-C$_3$N$_4$) 2D
material. The ring shape is the most preferred vacancy evolution path, with
significant stability of the semicircle fourfold C-N-C-N vacancy. We found that
bare gt-C$_3$N$_4$ which is non-magnetic becomes magnetic by 2-, and 5-defects
creation, hydrogen/oxygen passivation of the defects, and upon Fe adsorption.
Interestingly, Fe atoms interact with the gt-C$_3$N$_4$ sheet and result in a
ground ferromagnetic (FM) state. In addition, we investigate the effects of
passivating the vacancies by hydrogen in gt-C$_3$N$_4$ on its structural,
electrical, and magnetic properties. We found that substituting the 1, 2, and 3
vacancies with hydrogen and passivating the 6-defect with oxygen turns on
magnetism in the system. Due to structural distortion, the passivated defects
do not have a well-ordered magnetic orientation. However, passivating the
remaining defected structures maintains the nonmagnetic state. It is also shown
that passivation leads to a semiconductor with a band gap value higher than
that of the bare material. We also calculate the electronic and magnetic
properties of transition metal (TM) atoms, including V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co,
Ni-adsorbed gt-C$_3$N$_4$ monolayer. All TM atoms show slight lattice
distortion, and the adsorbed system almost maintains the original structure
type. Moreover, a FM alignment was observed with a total magnetic moments of
2.89 $\mu_B$, 2 $\mu_B$, and 1 $\mu_B$ for V, Fe, and Co atoms, respectively.
The Cr, Mn, and Ni atoms induce no magnetism to the non magnetic gt-C$_3$N$_4$
system.

- **TL;DR**: AMaRaNTA是一个自动化计算软件包，用于从第一性原理计算中提取二维磁体的交换参数和各向异性参数，解决了传统能量映射方法需要繁琐多步骤操作的问题。

Two-dimensional (2D) magnets host a wide range of exotic magnetic textures,
whose low-energy excitations and finite-temperature properties are typically
described by effective spin models based on Heisenberg-like Hamiltonians. A key
challenge in this framework is the reliable determination, from ab initio
calculations, of exchange parameters and their anisotropic components, crucial
for stabilising long-range order. Among the different strategies proposed for
this task, the energy-mapping method -- based on total-energy calculations
within Density Functional Theory (DFT) -- is the most widely adopted, but it
typically requires laborious, multi-step procedures. To overcome this
limitation, we introduce AMaRaNTA (Automating Magnetic paRAmeters iN a
Tensorial Approach), a computational package that systematically automates the
energy-mapping method, specifically through its ``four-state'' formulation, to
extract exchange and anisotropy parameters in 2D magnets. In its current
implementation, AMaRaNTA returns the nearest-neighbour exchange tensor,
complemented by scalar parameters for second- and third-nearest-neighbour
exchange interactions as well as single-ion anisotropy. Together, these provide
a minimal yet sufficient set of parameters to capture magnetic frustration and
anisotropies, essential for stabilising several observed magnetic states in 2D
materials. Applied to a representative subset of the Materials Cloud 2D
Structure database, AMaRaNTA demonstrates robust, automated and reproducible
screening of magnetic interactions, with clear potential for high-throughput
simulations.

Methods of elucidating the mechanisms of fast-ion conduction in solid-state
materials are pivotal for advancements in energy technologies such as
batteries, fuel cells, sensors, and supercapacitors. In this study, we examine
the ionic conduction pathways in single crystal SrCl$_2$, which is a fast-ion
conductor above 900~K, using four-dimensional Quasi-Elastic Neutron Scattering
(4D-QENS). We explore both coherent and incoherent neutron scattering at
temperatures above the transition temperature into the superionic phase to
explore the correlated motion of hopping anions. Refinements of the incoherent
QENS yield residence times and jump probabilities between lattice sites in good
agreement with previous studies, confirming that ionic hopping along
nearest-neighbor directions is the most probable conduction pathway. However,
the coherent QENS reveals evidence of de Gennes narrowing, indicating the
importance of ionic correlations in the conduction mechanism. This highlights
the need for improvements both in the theory of ionic transport in fluorite
compounds and the modeling of coherent 4D-QENS in single crystals.
