- **Title (EN)**: MolCluster: Integrating Graph Neural Network with Community Detection for Coarse-Grained Mapping
- **Authors**: Zhixuan Zhong, Linbo Ma, Jian Jiang

- **TL;DR**: MolCluster是一种无监督的粗粒度建模方法，通过图神经网络和社区检测算法自动提取分子系统的粗粒度表示，无需标记数据即可实现可定制的分辨率控制。

Coarse-grained (CG) modeling simplifies molecular systems by mapping groups
of atoms into representative units. However, traditional CG approaches rely on
fixed mapping rules, which limit their ability to handle diverse chemical
systems and require extensive manual intervention. Thus, supervised
learning-based CG methods have been proposed, enabling more automated and
adaptable mapping. Nevertheless, these methods suffer from limited labeled
datasets and the inability to control mapping resolution, which is essential
for multiscale modeling. To overcome these limitations, we propose MolCluster,
an unsupervised model that integrates a graph neural network and a community
detection algorithm to extract CG representations. Additionally, a predefined
group pair loss ensures the preservation of target groups, and a bisection
strategy enables precise, customizable resolution across different molecular
systems. In the case of the downstream task, evaluations on the MARTINI2
dataset demonstrate that MolCluster, benefiting from its label-free pretraining
strategy, outperforms both traditional clustering and supervised models.
Overall, these results highlight the potential of MolCluster as a core model
for customizable and chemically consistent CG mapping.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一个用于管道中两相多组分传输的统一框架，结合流体动力学和热力学，特别针对CCS应用中CO2富集混合物的降压过程。

Pipeline transport of dense-phase CO2-rich mixtures is a crucial component in
carbon capture and storage (CCS). Accurate modeling requires coupling of fluid
dynamics and thermodynamics, especially during transient events such as
depressurization. In this work, we present a unified framework for two-phase
multicomponent transport in pipelines that integrates both aspects.
Specifically, we employ the homogeneous equilibrium model (HEM) for modeling
the transport of two-phase CO2-rich mixture, with thermodynamic closure
provided by a Helmholtz energy-based equation of state. Phase equilibrium
calculations are performed using UVN-flash, supplemented with a stability
analysis procedure to detect phase separation and generate initial guesses for
the phase-equilibrium calculations. Specifically, we introduce a novel tailored
UVN-flash routine that aligns with the fluid dynamics formulation. This is
achieved by introducing an alternative and better-scaled set of variables for
the phase-equilibrium calculations. The proposed framework is applied to the
depressurization of tanks and pipelines containing CO2-rich mixtures,
demonstrating its effectiveness for CCS-relevant applications.

### A relativistic coupled-cluster treatment of magnetic hyperfine structure of the $X^2Π$ and $A^2Σ^+$ states of OH isotopologues

- **TL;DR**: 本文采用四分量相对论耦合簇方法计算了羟基自由基同位素分子（^{16,17}OH(D)）的磁偶极超精细结构常数，在核间距范围R∈[0.6,1.8]Å内获得了最准确的理论预测，与实验值在1%内一致。

$\textit{Ab initio}$ calculations of the parallel component of the magnetic
dipole hyperfine structure (HFS) constant have been carried out for hydroxyl
radical isotopologues ($^{16,17}$OH(D)) over the internuclear distance range $R
\in [0.6, 1.8]$ \r{A}. For the ground electronic state $X^2\Pi$, the HFS
functions were evaluated for contributions induced by both oxygen and hydrogen
nuclei. In addition, the hydrogen-induced HFS curve was calculated for the
excited $A^2\Sigma^+$ state. The quantum-chemistry study employs a
four-component relativistic coupled-cluster (CC) method, including excitations
up to the triple level, namely: the contribution of triple-cluster amplitudes
was studied both perturbatively (CCSD(T)) and through fully iterative
calculations (CCSDT). The resulting oxygen- and hydrogen-induced HFS functions
represent the most accurate and reliable theoretical predictions to date
exhibiting excellent agreement with semiempirical curve for hydrogen-induced
HFS derived from high-resolution spectroscopic data for the lowest vibrational
levels ($v\in [0,2]$) of the electronic $X^2\Pi$ state. Vibrationally averaged
$\textit{ab initio}$ values are consistent with experimental values within
$1\%$ for all states considered. Furthermore, the internuclear distance range
over which the HFS curves are defined has been extended beyond that of previous
studies, thereby providing a robust foundation for accurate HFS treatments of
higher-lying rovibrational levels of OH isotopologues within both adiabatic and
non-adiabatic frameworks.

### Tailoring properties of Heusler alloys by elemental substitution and electron counting: (Co$_{2-α}$Mn$_α$)FeGe, Co$_2$(Fe$_{1-β}$Mn$_β$)Ge, and (Co$_{2-α}$Fe$_α$)MnGe

- **TL;DR**: 该论文通过元素替代方法研究了基于Co₂FeGe的三种非等效替代系列，探索了Mn、Fe、Co元素互换对材料性能的影响。研究发现单相化合物在特定价电子数范围内形成，所有单相化合物均为软铁磁体，具有高居里温度，部分化合物表现出半金属特性。

Rational material design by elemental substitution is useful in tailoring
materials to have desirable properties. Here we consider three non-equivalent
substitutional series based on Co$_2$FeGe, viz;
(Co$_{2-\alpha}$Mn$_\alpha$)FeGe, Co$_2$(Fe$_{1-\beta}$Mn$_{\beta}$)Ge,
(Co$_{2-\alpha}$Fe$_\alpha$)MnGe ($0\!\le\!\alpha\!\le\!2,
0\!\le\!\beta\!\le\!1$), and study how material properties evolve with the
interchange of Mn, Fe, and Co in Co$_2$FeGe. In all three schemes, single-phase
compounds can be obtained over a wide range of compositions: $0.125 &lt; \alpha &lt;
1.375 $ for (Co$_{2-\alpha}$Mn$_{\alpha}$)FeGe, $0 \!\le\! \beta \!\le\! 1$ for
Co$_2$(Fe$_{1-\beta}$Mn$_{\beta}$)Ge, and $0 \!&lt;\! \alpha \!&lt;\! 1.50$ for
(Co$_{2-\alpha}$Fe$_\alpha$)MnGe. All the single-phase compounds crystallise in
fcc structure with chemical ordering consistent with the ``4-2'' rule of Butler
et al. The compounds are soft ferromagnets with low temperature saturation
magnetisation agreeing with the Slater-Pauling rule. Very high Curie
temperatures are measured, with values up to 1000 K for lower Mn
concentrations. First principle calculations indicate, in the most stable
atomic configuration, Mn prefers sharing sublattice with Ge, also consistent
with the 4-2 rule. The calculations further predict half-metallic behaviour for
(Co$_{1.625}$Mn$_{0.375}$)FeGe, while finding other compositions to be nearly
half-metallic. Upon comparing the results of the three series, it is found that
single-phase alloys occur for a specific range of valence electrons per unit
cell ($\sim\!28.5\!-\!29.75$), and that even for multi-phase samples the
structural, magnetic, and electronic properties depend primarily on the number
of valence electrons and not on the specific substitution scheme employed.

### Revisiting dissipation-driven phase transition in a Josephson junction

- **TL;DR**: 本文通过实验研究了约瑟夫森结在真实电阻环境下的低频电流-电压特性，发现施密特-布尔加达耶夫量子相变发生在电阻超过量子值h/(4e²)≈6.5 kΩ时，与原始预测一致。

Despite extensive experimental and theoretical work over several decades,
Schmid-Bulgadaev quantum phase transition remains a subject of debate. Here we
revisit this problem by performing systematic experiments on low-frequency
current-voltage characteristics of Josephson junctions over a wide range of
parameters. The experiments are conducted in a true resistive environment
formed by a metallic on-chip resistor located near the junction. Over the
parameter range of the experiment, we find that the transition occurs when the
resistance crosses the quantum value $h/(4e^2)\simeq 6.5$ k$\Omega$ for Cooper
pairs, as originally predicted. The temperature $T$ of the experiment is
naturally non-zero, but our basic theoretical modeling corroborates that the
observations under these conditions can serve as the basis for the conclusions
made, in particular, the crossover resistance from superconducting to
insulating regime is the same as that at $T=0$.

### Ge as an ideal orbitronic platform: giant orbital Hall effect

- **TL;DR**: 本文提出锗（Ge）作为理想的轨道电子学平台，展示了锗中空穴具有巨大的轨道霍尔效应，比拓扑绝缘体的体态效应更强，且比自旋霍尔效应大四个数量级。

State-of-the-art developments in magnetic devices rely on manufacturing
faster, more efficient memory elements. A significant development in this
direction has been the discovery of orbital torques, which employ the orbital
angular momentum of Bloch electrons to switch the magnetisation of an adjacent
ferromagnet, and has motivated the search for \textit{orbitronic} materials
displaying strong orbital dynamics exemplified, by the orbital Hall effect
(OHE). In this work we propose Ge, as an optimal orbitronic platform. We
demonstrate that holes in bulk Ge exhibit a giant OHE, exceeding that of the
bulk states of topological insulators, and exceeding the spin-Hall effect by
four orders of magnitude. The calculation is performed within the framework of
the Luttinger model and the modern theory of orbital magnetisation, while
incorporating recently-discovered quantum corrections to the OHE. Our study
constitutes a fundamental milestone in applying the modern theory to a system
with \textit{inversion symmetry}. Moreover, we argue that bulk Ge serves as an
ideal testbed for the orbital torque resulting from a charge current, since the
spin- and orbital-Edelstein effects in Ge are forbidden by symmetry. Our
results provide a blueprint for producing strong orbital torques in magnetic
devices with Ge, guiding future experimental work in this direction.

### Multicriticality between Purely Gapless SPT Phases with Unitary Symmetry

- **Title (EN)**: Multicriticality between Purely Gapless SPT Phases with Unitary Symmetry
- **Authors**: Saranesh Prembabu, Ruben Verresen
- **Categories**: cond-mat.str-el, cond-mat.stat-mech
- **TL;DR**: 该论文研究了无间隙对称保护拓扑相（gapless SPTs）之间的相变，通过三能级量子比特（qutrit）版本的最近邻XX链模型，发现了三个不同的无间隙SPT相在c=2的多临界点相遇的丰富相图结构。

Symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases are commonly required to have an
energy gap, but recent work has extended the concept to gapless settings. This
raises a natural question: what happens at transitions between inequivalent
gapless SPTs? We address this for the simplest known case among gapless SPTs
protected by a unitary symmetry group acting faithfully on the low-energy
theory. To this end, we consider a qutrit version of the nearest-neighbor XX
chain. Trimerizing the chain explicitly breaks an anomalous symmetry and
produces three distinct gapped SPT phases protected by a unitary $\mathbb{Z}_3
\times \mathbb{Z}_3$ symmetry. Their phase boundaries are given by three
inequivalent gapless SPTs without any gapped symmetry sectors, each described
by a symmetry-enriched version of an orbifolded Potts$^2$ conformal field
theory with central charge $c=\frac{8}{5}$. We provide an analytic derivation
of this critical theory in a particular regime and confirm its stability using
tensor network simulations. Remarkably, the three gapless SPTs meet at a $c =
2$ multicritical point, where the protecting $\mathbb{Z}_3 \times \mathbb{Z}_3$
symmetry exhibits a mixed anomaly with the $\mathbb Z_3$ entangler symmetry
that permutes the SPT classes. We further explore how discrete gauging gives
dipole-symmetric models, offering insights into dipole symmetry-breaking and
SPTs, as well as symmetry-enriched multiversality. Altogether, this work
uncovers a rich phase diagram of a minimal qutrit chain, whose purely
nearest-neighbor interactions make it a promising candidate for experimental
realization, including the prospect of critical phases with stable edge modes.

### On the Hydrodynamic Approximation of Quantum Integrable Models -- An Illustration via the repulsive Lieb-Liniger Model

- **Categories**: cond-mat.stat-mech
- **TL;DR**: 该论文提出了一种新的半经典Bethe模型作为量子可积模型与宏观广义流体动力学之间的中间描述，证明了Lieb-Liniger模型的欧拉广义流体动力学方程解的存在性、唯一性和无梯度灾难性，并揭示了扩散修正的物理机制不同于Navier-Stokes型方程。

Generalized hydrodynamics is a framework to study the large scale dynamics of
integrable models, special fine-tuned one-dimensional many-body systems that
possess an infinite number of local conserved quantities. Unlike classical
models, where the microscopic origins of generalized hydrodynamics are better
understood, in quantum models it can only be derived using the hydrodynamic
formalism. Using the paradigmatic and experimentally relevant repulsive
Lieb-Liniger model as an example, this thesis introduces a new viewpoint on the
dynamics of quantum integrable models by introducing so-called semi-classical
Bethe models. These classical integrable models act as an intermediate
description between the microscopic quantum realm and the macroscopic
generalized hydrodynamics. After introducing these models and discussing their
properties, we study the generalized hydrodynamics equation using new tools and
show that solutions to the Euler generalized hydrodynamics equation of the
Lieb-Liniger model exist, are unique and do not develop gradient catastrophes.
Finally, we discuss new insights into the physics governing the diffusive
correction, which, contrary to prior belief, is not described by a
Navier-Stokes-like equation. Focusing on the main intuitive ideas, the thesis
aims to provide a self-contained overview over these exciting new developments
on generalized hydrodynamics.

### Numerically exact quantum dynamics with tensor networks: Predicting the decoherence of interacting spin systems

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种基于矩阵乘积态表示的数值精确且可扩展的方法，用于预测固态和分子量子技术候选体系的量子动力学，包括自旋网络的相干性和布居动力学。

Predicting the quantum dynamics of promising solid-state and molecular
quantum technology candidates remains a formidable challenge. Yet, accessing
these dynamics is key to understanding and controlling decoherence mechanisms
-- a prerequisite for designing better qubits, sensors, and memories. We
leverage a matrix product state representation to introduce a numerically exact
and scalable method to achieve this goal. We demonstrate that our method
accurately predicts coherence and population dynamics of spin networks across a
wide range of parameter regimes, encompassing nuclear spin sensors and qubits
in solid-state semiconductors and molecular magnets. Our method further
predicts spin dynamics under the influence of repeated light pulses, which are
commonly used to mitigate decoherence and perform quantum sensing experiments.
Our method thus provides reliable results for moderately-sized spin platforms
spanning molecular magnets and solid-state spins that can guide the development
of approximate but efficient quantum dynamics methods and enable principled
inquiry into decoherence mechanisms.

### Negative Charge Transfer: Ground State Precursor towards High Energy Batteries

- **TL;DR**: 本文重新定义了LiCoO2等高能层状阴极材料的氧化还原机制，提出负电荷转移（NCT）演化是内在的氧化还原机制，而非传统的阳离子或阴离子氧化还原。

Modern energy applications, especially electric vehicles, demand high energy
batteries. However, despite decades of intensive efforts, the highest energy
density and commercially viable batteries are still based on LiCoO2, the very
first generation of cathode materials. The technical bottleneck is the
stability of oxide-based cathodes at high operating voltages. The fundamental
puzzle is that we actually never understood the redox mechanism of LiCoO2.
Conventional wisdom generally defines redox to be centered on cations at low
voltages, and on anions, i.e. oxygen, at high voltages by forming oxidized
chemical states like O2 or peroxo-species. Here, through in-situ and ex-situ
spectroscopy coupled with theoretical calculations, we show that high-energy
layered cathodes, represented by LiCoO2 and LiNiO2, operate through enhancement
of negative charge transfer (NCT) ground states upon charging throughout the
whole voltage range - i.e., NCT evolution itself is the intrinsic redox
mechanism regardless of voltage ranges. NCT inherently engages high covalency
and oxygen holes, leading to optimized performance without conventional redox
centers in LiCoO2. The level of NCT, i.e., number of ligand holes, naturally
explains many seemingly controversial results. The redefinition of redox
mechanism reveals the pathway toward viable high energy battery electrodes.

### Effect of C additives with 0.5% in weight on structural, optical and superconducting properties of Ta-Nb-Hf-Zr-Ti high entropy alloy films

- **TL;DR**: 研究了含0.5%重量碳添加剂的Ta-Nb-Hf-Zr-Ti高熵合金薄膜的超导性能，碳添加剂增强了超导临界性能和光学性能

We investigated the superconducting (SC) properties of Ta-Nb-Hf-Zr-Ti
high-entropy alloy (HEA) thin films with 0.5% weight C additives. The C
additives stabilize the structural properties and enhance the SC critical
properties, including $\mu_0$Hc$_2$ (13.45 T) and Tc (7.5 K). The reflectance
of the C-added HEA film is enhanced in the low-energy region, resulting in a
higher optical conductivity, which is consistent with the lower electrical
resistivity. In addition, we observed SC vortices in the C-added HEA film using
magnetic force microscopy. The magnetic penetration depths ($\lambda$) of the
pure HEA and C-added HEA films were estimated from their Meissner force curves
by comparing them with those of a reference Nb film. At 4.2 K, the {\lambda} of
the C-added film is 360 nm, shorter than that of the pure HEA film (560 nm),
indicating stronger superconductivity against an applied magnetic field.

### Anomalous Landau Levels in Inhomogeneous Fluxes and Emergent Supersymmetry

- **TL;DR**: 该论文研究了二维系统中奇异平带在非均匀磁场下的响应，揭示了通过磁通不均匀性可控操纵反常朗道能级的机制，并发现了参数空间中出现的超对称性。

Two-dimensional systems in magnetic fields host rich physics, most notably
the quantum Hall effect arising from Landau level quantization. In a broad
class of two-dimensional models, flat bands with topologically nontrivial band
degeneracies give rise to anomalous Landau level quantization under homogeneous
fields. Ascribed to the underlying quantum geometry, these are classified as
singular flat bands, exhibiting unusual wavefunction localization, and
anomalous quantization of Landau levels. We investigate the response of gapless
singular flat bands to inhomogeneous fluxes, bridging continuum and lattice
descriptions. Our analysis reveals a mechanism to controllably manipulate the
anomalous Landau levels via flux inhomogeneity. We further uncover an emergent
supersymmetry in the parameter space where the tower of anomalous Landau levels
collapses to zero energy, rendering a lattice analog of the Aharonov-Casher
theorem on degenerate zero modes in perpendicular fluxes, with wavefunction
localization partly similar to Aharonov-Bohm caging. With the addition of
strong correlations, these findings will have implications for realizing exotic
topological and charge-ordered phases.

### Disorder-induced fractionalization of pair density waves

- **TL;DR**: 本文研究了无序性对配对密度波超导体的影响，发现在强无序极限下，系统会形成PDW团簇相干的s波超导体状态，而不是之前提出的电荷4e超导性。

We investigate the effects of disorder on a system that in the clean limit is
a pair density wave (PDW) superconductor. The charge order of the clean PDW is
inevitably lost (via Imry-Ma), but the fate of the superconducting order is
less clear. Here, we consider a strongly inhomogeneous limit in which the
system consists of a random collection of PDW puddles embedded in a metallic
background. When the puddles are dilute, they become phase coherent at low
temperatures, resulting in a state that is macroscopically equivalent to a
charge-$2e$ $s$-wave superconductor. This can be viewed as an example of
``order parameter fractionalization'' -- the PDW order splits into a charge-2e
s-wave superconductor and a charge density wave, the latter of which is
destroyed by disorder -- and stands in contrast to the ``vestigial'' charge-4e
superconductivity which has been proposed to arise in weakly disordered PDWs.

### Curzon Ahlborn Type Efficiency in a Brownian Heat Engine with Exponential Temperature Profile

We investigate a Brownian heat engine wherein a particle moves through a
periodic ratchet potential under an exponentially decreasing temperature
profile, a spatial configuration that closely resembles experimentally
realizable conditions such as laser-induced thermal gradients and
thermoplasmonic heating. This model yields exact analytical expressions for the
particle current, thermodynamic efficiency, entropy production, and coefficient
of performance (COP), and uniquely recovers the Curzon Ahlborn efficiency and
the corresponding endoreversible COP exactly in the quasistatic limit. These
findings provide a rare and rigorous realization of endoreversible
thermodynamics at the mesoscopic scale because they are derived directly from
microscopic stochastic dynamics without recourse to phenomenological
assumptions, asymptotic approximations or coarse-graining techniques. Although
the derived efficiency and COP are exact, they remain strictly below the Carnot
limit, reflecting the inherent irreversibility embedded within the
endoreversible framework. Furthermore, we show that in comparison to linear and
piecewise-constant temperature profile cases, the exponential temperature
profile leads to significantly higher particle velocities, higher entropy
production, but lower thermodynamic efficiency, which underscores the
fundamental trade-off between transport speed and energy cost.

Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have revolutionized molecular

limited transferability, and an over-reliance on error-based metrics tied to
specific density functional theory (DFT) references. We introduce MLIP Arena, a
benchmark platform that evaluates force field performance based on physics
awareness, chemical reactivity, stability under extreme conditions, and
predictive capabilities for thermodynamic properties and physical phenomena. By
moving beyond static DFT references and revealing the important failure modes
of current foundation MLIPs in real-world settings, MLIP Arena provides a
reproducible framework to guide the next-generation MLIP development toward
improved predictive accuracy and runtime efficiency while maintaining physical
consistency. The Python package and online leaderboard are available at

Amorphous tantalum nitride (a-Ta$_x$N) barriers are particularly attractive due
to their superior barrier performance, attributed to the absence of grain
boundaries. However, a systematic atomistic investigation of how varying Ta
stoichiometries influences adhesion strength at Cu/a-Ta$_x$N interfaces remains
lacking, hindering a comprehensive understanding of interface optimization
strategies. In this study, we employ machine learning interatomic potentials
(MLIPs) to perform steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations of Cu/a-Ta$_x$N
interfaces. We simultaneously evaluate three distinct interface construction
approaches--static relaxation, high-temperature annealing, and simulated Cu
deposition--to comprehensively investigate their influence on adhesion strength
across varying Ta compositions ($x=1, 2, 4$). Peak force and work of adhesion
values from SMD simulations quantitatively characterize interface strength,
while atomic stress and strain analyses elucidate detailed deformation
behavior, highlighting the critical role of interfacial morphologies.
Additionally, we explore the atomistic mechanisms underlying cohesive failure,
revealing how targeted incorporation of Ta atoms into Cu layers enhances the
cohesive strength of the interface. This study demonstrates how MLIP-driven
simulations can elucidate atomic-scale relationships between interface
morphology and adhesion behavior, providing insights that can guide future
atomistic engineering strategies toward enhancing intrinsic barrier adhesion,
potentially enabling liner-free interconnect technologies.

- **TL;DR**: 本文通过X射线吸收、电子能量损失谱和密度泛函理论计算，研究了La4Ni3O10单晶中Ni的dx²-y²和dz²轨道在超导性中的作用，发现配体空穴与这些轨道杂化，dx²-y²态主导低能电荷激发且更具巡游性，同时观测到约0.1 eV的双磁子激发和层间超交换相互作用。

High-T$_c$ superconductivity has recently been discovered in
Ruddlesden-Popper phase nickelates under pressure, where the low-energy
electronic structure is dominated by Ni $d_{x^2 - y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals.
However, the respective roles of these orbitals in superconductivity remain
unclear. Here, by combining X-ray absorption, electron energy loss
spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations on
La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10}$ single crystals, we identify ligand holes in the
$p_{x,y}$ orbitals of planar oxygen and the $p_z$ orbitals of apical oxygen,
which hybridize with the Ni $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals, respectively.
These ligand holes enable orbital-selective O K-edge resonant inelastic X-ray
scattering (RIXS) study, which reveals that $d_{x^2-y^2}$ states dominate the
low-energy charge excitations and are more itinerant. We also observe a
$\sim$0.1 eV bimagnon through RIXS and Raman spectroscopy, which leads to an
interlayer superexchange interaction J$_z$ of $\sim$50 meV. Our results reveal
distinct contributions of Ni $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals to the
electronic and magnetic structure and provide direct experimental insights to
understand the RP-phase nickelate superconductors.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文提出了一种使用钉扎合成反铁磁体(pSAF)的方法，无需实验错位或改变材料固有属性即可高效激发声学和光学磁振子模式，实现了强磁振子耦合和可观的磁振子带隙，在室温下具有量子磁振子应用的潜力。

Synthetic antiferromagnets (SAFs) consist of two ferromagnetic layers that
are antiferromagnetically coupled. These systems support complex dynamical
magnetic excitations, where interlayer coupling gives rise to both in-phase
(acoustic) and anti-phase (optical) magnonic modes. Typically, simultaneous
excitation of both modes requires breaking the symmetry between the
ferromagnetic layers -- commonly achieved through slight misalignment of the
experimental setup or by modifying the intrinsic magnetic properties. In our
approach, we utilize a pinned synthetic antiferromagnet (pSAF), where one of
the ferromagnetic layers is exchange-coupled to an antiferromagnet. We
demonstrate that by tuning the thickness of the antiferromagnet and slightly
enhancing the magnetic anisotropy of the pinned layer, both acoustic and
optical modes can be efficiently excited -- without the need for experimental
misalignment or changes to the intrinsic material properties. Under specific
conditions, the magnon dispersion relations exhibit anti-crossing behavior,
resulting in the emergence of a magnonic bandgap -- a clear signature of strong
magnon-magnon coupling. The coupling efficiency $\eta$, defined as the ratio
between the bandgap and the characteristic frequency, reaches $\eta = 0.5$,
approaching the ultra-strong coupling regime ($\eta = 1$). The combination of
strong mode hybridization, a sizable magnonic bandgap, and high ferromagnetic
resonance (FMR) coherence over large areas -- all achieved at room temperature
without cryogenic cooling -- underscores the potential of these systems for
quantum magnonic applications, including quantum computing.

### Quantum Coherence in a Maximally Hot Hubbard Chain

We present a detailed study of the real-time dynamics and spectral properties
of the one-dimensional fermionic Hubbard model at infinite temperature. Using
tensor network simulations in Liouville space, we compute the single-particle
Green's function and analyze its dynamics across a broad range of interaction
strengths. To complement the time-domain approach, we develop a high-resolution
Chebyshev expansion method within the density matrix formalism, enabling direct
access to spectral functions in the frequency domain. In the non-interacting
limit, we derive exact analytical expressions for the Green's function,
providing a benchmark for our numerical methods. As interactions are
introduced, we observe a transition in the spectral function from a sharp peak
at the free dispersion to a broadened two-band structure associated with hole
and doublon excitations. These features are well captured by a Hubbard-I
mean-field approximation, even at intermediate coupling. At infinite
interaction strength ($U = \infty$), we exploit a determinant representation of
the Green's function to access both real-time and spectral properties. In this
regime, the system retains a sharp, cosine-like momentum dispersion in
frequency space, while the dynamics display nontrivial light-cone spreading
with sub-ballistic scaling. Our results demonstrate that strong correlations
and nontrivial quantum coherence can persist even at infinite temperature.

We introduce families of classical stochastic dynamics in two and higher
dimensions which stabilize order in the absence of any symmetry. Our dynamics
are qualitatively distinct from Toom's rule, and have the unusual feature of
being fluctuation-stabilized: their order becomes increasingly fragile in
larger dimensions. One of our models maintains an ordered phase only in two
dimensions. The phase transitions that occur as the order is lost realize new
dynamical universality classes which are fundamentally non-equilibrium in
character.

### Robust Ferrimagnetic Ground State and Suppressed Superconductivity in Two-Dimensional HC6

Two-dimensional hydrogenated graphene (HC6) represents a promising platform
for exploring emergent electronic phases. Owing to its high electronic density
of states at the Fermi level, HC6 is expected to support phonon-mediated
superconductivity, with a calculated critical temperature Tc of 37.4 K in the
paramagnetic metallic phase. However, spin-polarized first-principles
calculations reveal that HC6 stabilizes in a ferrimagnetic ground state, which
is energetically favored by 0.175 eV per unit cell over the paramagnetic
metallic phase. This large energy difference significantly exceeds kB T at room
temperature, indicating robust magnetic order. Although the superconducting
condensation energy lowers the total energy by about 7 meV, the superconducting
phase remains metastable. These results highlight the dominant role of
magnetism in HC6 and illustrate how a high electronic density of states can
drive competing instabilities in hydrogenated two-dimensional materials,
offering design principles for carbon-based magnetic systems.

### Ambient-pressure superconductivity above 22 K in hole-doped YB2

Recent studies of hydrogen-dominant (superhydride) materials, such as LaH10
have led to putative discoveries of near-room temperature superconductivity at
high pressures, with a superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of 250 K
observed at 170 GPa. While these findings are promising, achieving such high
superconductivity requires challenging experimental conditions typically
exceeding 100 GPa. In this study, we utilize first-principles calculations and
Migdal-Eliashberg theory to examine the superconducting properties of the
stable boron-based compound YB2 at atmospheric pressure, where yttrium and
boron atoms form a layered structure. Our results indicate that YB2 exhibits a
Tc of 2.14 K at 0 GPa. We find that doping with additional electrons (0 to 0.3)
leads to a monotonic decrease in Tc as the electron concentration increases.
Conversely, introducing holes significantly enhances Tc, raising it to 22.83 K.
Although our findings do not surpass the superconducting temperature of the
well-known MgB2, our doping strategy highlights a method for tuning
electron-phonon coupling strength in metal borides. This insight could be
valuable for future experi-mental applications. Overall, this study not only
deepens our understanding of YB2 superconducting properties but also
contributes to the ongoing search for high-temperature superconductors.

### Classical and single photon memory devices based on polariton lasers

Stimulated scattering of incoherent excitons into an exciton-polariton mode
leads to the build-up of a polariton condensate whose polarization is sensitive
to a small seeded population that triggers the stimulated process. We show,
within a semiclassical stochastic Gross-Pitaevskii model, that this mechanism
enables a robust polarization memory operation: the condensate tends to align
its Stokes vector with that of the seed and to maintain it for times far
exceeding an individual polariton lifetime. Importantly, this
single-photon-seeded regime is modeled as an initial weak excitation of the
condensate mode. We quantify the memory performance by a classical
polarization-alignment metric and find that the seed polarization can remain
well preserved on a nanosecond timescale under realistic parameters.

### Hot but Coherent: Doublons at Infinite Temperature in the Hubbard chain

We investigate the spectral properties and the dynamics of doublons in the
one-dimensional Hubbard model at infinite temperature. Using a Chebyshev
expansion approach formulated in the superfermionic representation, we compute
the momentum- and frequency-resolved doublon spectral function across a wide
range of interaction strengths $U$ and in the presence of an external electric
field. Increasing the interaction, the spectrum gradually splits into separate
bands associated with two-hole and two-particle excitations. Despite the
presence of strong correlations, we find that doublons retain their coherence
and undergo long-lived Bloch oscillations, as well as rich quantum walk
dynamics characterized by light-cone spreadings at strong coupling, which we
analyze through the time-and space-resolved Green's function.

### Intrinsic antiferromagnetic half-metal and topological phases in the ferrovalley states of the sliding bilayer altermagnets

Altermagnetism is characterized by non-relativistic spin splitting and zero
total magnetic moments. In this work, intrinsic antiferromagnetic half-metallic
and topological phases were discovered within the ferrovalley states of sliding
bilayer altermagnets. We construct the bilayer system by utilizing altermagnet
monolayers with a small bandgap. The inter-layer hopping phenomenon leads to a
reduction in bandgaps, and sliding engineering induces ferrovalley states.
Taking the V$_2$OSSe system for example, first-principles calculations indicate
that the spin-dependent inter-layer hopping in the ferrovalley state ensures a
direct gap in one valley (one spin channel) and band inversion in the other
valley (opposite spin channel), which is manifested as an intrinsic
antiferromagnetic half-metal. The microscopic model and effective Hamiltonian
employed in this research confirm the universal spin-dependent inter-layer
hopping in the sliding altermagnet bilayer. Further calculations imply the
existence of Chern insulator and gapless surface states in the sliding
altermagnet bilayer. Adjusting the sliding direction can achieve the transition
between different half-metals with conducting electrons of different spins,
accompanied by the switching of gapless surface states of opposite spins. This
research lays a foundation for the potential applications of intrinsic
antiferromagnetic half-metals and topological phases in spintronics.

### Field-resilient superconducting coplanar waveguide resonators made of Nb, NbTi, and NbTiN

Superconducting coplanar waveguide (SCPW) resonators with high internal
quality factors (\Q_i) are essential for quantum information applications, but
suffer severe Qi degradation under magnetic fields due to quasiparticle
generation and vortex-induced losses. We fabricated and characterized Nb, NbTi,
and NbTiN SCPW resonators with varying film thicknesses under different
temperatures and in-plane magnetic fields (\(B_{\parallel}\)).
Temperature-dependent transmission measurements agree well with Mattis-Bardeen
theory, revealing kinetic inductance parameters. Comparative analysis shows
that 45-nm-thick NbTi resonators maintain \(Q_i = 1.01 \times 10^{4}\) at
(\(B_{\parallel}\)) = 0.4 T, satisfying the dual requirements of high Qi and
strong field resilience. Owing to its moderate kinetic inductance and
compatibility with conventional photolithography, NbTi emerges as a practical
material platform for field-resilient SCPW resonators and hybrid quantum
circuits operating in magnetic environments.

Electrical current fluctuations provide a powerful and unconventional probe
of band geometry in quantum materials. In particular, intrinsic noise
components that are independent of the relaxation time reveal universal
band-geometric properties of Bloch electrons. Here, we identify a distinct
intrinsic contribution to current noise at second order in the electric field,
which is governed by the quantum metric. This effect arises from field-induced
modifications to Bloch wavefunctions and band energies, and it dominates in
PT-symmetric antiferromagnets where Berry curvature based contributions are
forbidden by symmetry. Applying our theory to CuMnAs, we demonstrate that
thermal noise provides a direct signature of quantum metric in PT-symmetric
antiferromagnets.

We present a rigorous derivation of the orbital magnetization formula for
interacting electrons within the self-consistent Hartree-Fock approximation.
Our results are expressed entirely in terms of the self-consistent
wavefunctions and the Hartree-Fock energy spectrum at zero magnetic field. We

calculations performed at small but non-zero external magnetic field. Our
method allows us to also derive formulas for the orbital magnetic
susceptibility.

Magnon-exciton coupling provides an unprecedented opportunity for the optical
tunability of spin information and, viceversa, for the magnetic control of the
optical response. Few-layered magnets are an ideal platform for the
experimental study of this coupling, in part due to the strong excitonic
character of the optical response in (quasi-)two dimensions. Here, we
demonstrate a strong dependence of the excitonic oscillator strength on the
magnetic order in a monolayer of chromium trichloride CrCl$_3$. Solving an
effective Bethe-Salpeter equation, we evaluate the changes in the excitonic
response as the magnetic order switches from the ferromagnetic state to the
antiferromagnetic state when strain is applied. Our results reveal an abrupt
change in the spatial localization of the excitons across the transition, which
translates into a strong shift and a change of the oscillator strength of the
excitonic peaks. This suggests the possibility of using strain as a binary
switch of the optical response in this material.

### Room-temperature superconductivity in ultra-thin carbon nanotube zeolite composites: a conventional or unconventional superconductor?

The recent report of signs of room-temperature superconductivity in ultrathin
single-walled carbon nanotubes (CNT) of types (2,1) and (3,0) holds significant
promise for energy applications due to their ability to conduct current without
dissipation. However, the McMillan Tc formula fails to calculate their
superconducting transition temperatures (Tc) accurately, which raises an
important question: what is the pairing mechanism driving their
room-temperature superconductivity? To explore this further, we first
investigate whether the strong curvature of ultrathin CNT leads to exotic
phenomena in unconventional superconductors. If no evidence of these exotic
characteristics is found and the McMillan formalism indicates that it is not a
BCS-type superconductor, could we be observing a new class of unconventional
superconductivity that functions independently of phonons and typical exotic
features? In this paper, we demonstrate that factors such as the chiral angle
of CNT, boron dopants and lattice regularity can be used to tune the
theoretical Tc to experimental values. Our finding suggests that combining CNT
with a harder substrate could be vital for further enhancing Tc while
minimizing lattice distortion under doping. We propose a reconsideration of the
common belief regarding whether the McMillan and BCS Tc formulas are adequate
for classifying materials as BCS or non-BCS superconductors.

### Nontrivial topology in one- and two-dimensional asymmetric systems with chiral boundary states

Symmetry plays an important role in the topological band theory. In contrary,
study on the topological properties of the asymmetric systems is rather
limited, especially in higher-dimensional systems. In this work, we explore a
new theory to study the topology in various one-dimensional (1D) and
two-dimensional (2D) asymmetric systems with chiral boundary states. Starting
from the simple SSHm model, we show the chiral topology of its edge states by
redefining sublattices. Meanwhile, based on its Rice-Mele-like effective
Hamiltonian, a new topological invariant $\bar{Z}$ can be defined and the
bulk-edge correspondence is established. With this clear physical picture, our
theory can be extended to the more complex asymmetric ladder models, or even
the 2D asymmetric systems. In the 2D BBH3 model, new chiral corner states with
redefined lattices are found based on our method. These corner states are
independent of any spatial symmetry and exhibit the characteristics of
topological bound states in the continuum (TBICs). Moreover, the topological
invariant can be calculated by introducing $\bar{Z}$ into 2D. At last, we
propose an acoustic experiment of the BBH3 model where chiral corner states are
numerically observed. Our work exhibits a new approach to study the topological
properties of asymmetric systems. By redefining sublattices, we find that the
models with entirely different structures might share the same topological
origins.

The self-energy encodes the fundamental lifetime of quasiparticle
excitations. In one dimension, it is known to display anomalous behavior at
zero temperature for interacting fermions, reflecting the breakdown of
Fermi-liquid theory. Here we show that the self-energy is also anomalous in the
infinite temperature Hubbard chain, where thermal fluctuations are maximal.
Focusing on the second order ring diagram, we find that the imaginary part of
the self-energy diverges non-perturbatively: as a power law with exponent
$-1/3$ near half filling, and logarithmically away from it. These divergences
imply anomalous temporal relaxation of Green's functions, confirmed by infinite
temperature tensor-network simulations. Our results demonstrate that anomalous
relaxation and the breakdown of perturbation theory survive even at maximal
entropy, which can be observed in cold-atom experiments probing the Hubbard
chain at high temperatures.

We discovered unique uniaxial negative thermal expansion (NTE) behavior for a
weak-itinerant-ferromagnetic phase of CoZr$_{2}$H$_{3.49}$. CoZr$_{2}$ is known
as a superconductor exhibiting uniaxial NTE along the $c$-axis, which is called
anomalous thermal expansion (ATE). Additionally, CoZr$_{2}$ is also known as a
well-absorbent of hydrogen, and hydrogen insertion raises weak-itinerant
ferromagnetism instead of superconductivity. However, the influence of hydrogen
insertion on ATE behavior in this system is still unclear. To investigate it,
we performed powder synchrotron X-ray diffraction (SXRD) for
CoZr$_{2}$H$_{3.49}$. Through Arrott plots analysis, we determined the Curie
temperature ($T_{\mathrm{C}}$) to be 139 K, and the Rhodes-Wohlfarth ratio was
estimated to be 3.49, which clearly exceeds 1, suggesting the itinerancy of
emerging ferromagnetism. Temperature dependencies of lattice constants $a$ and
$c$ were extracted from powder SXRD analyses, and we revealed that lattice
constant $c$ exhibited NTE behavior below $T_{\mathrm{C}}$. The uniaxial NTE
behavior along the $c$-axis can be understood by sharpening an antibonding
Co3$dz^{2}$ partial density of states near the Fermi level, linked to the
expansion of a one-dimensional Co-Co chain running parallel to the $c$-axis.

Solid-state qubits are sensitive to their microscopic environment, causing
the qubit properties to fluctuate on a wide range of timescales. The sub-Hz end
of the spectrum is usually dealt with by repeated background calibrations,
which bring considerable overhead. It is thus important to characterize and
understand the low-frequency variations of the relevant qubit characteristics.
In this study, we investigate the stability of spin qubit frequencies in the
Si/SiGe quantum dot platform. We find that the calibrated qubit frequencies of
a six-qubit device vary by up to $\pm 100$ MHz while performing a variety of
experiments over a span of 912 days. These variations are sensitive to the
precise voltage settings of the gate electrodes, however when these are kept
constant to within 15 $\mathrm{\mu}$V, the qubit frequencies vary by less than
$\pm 7$ MHz over periods up to 36 days. During overnight scans, the qubit
frequencies of ten qubits across two different devices show a standard
deviation below 200 kHz within a 1-hour time window. The qubit frequency noise
spectral density shows roughly a $1/f$ trend above $10^{-4}$ Hz and,
strikingly, a steeper trend at even lower frequencies.

A spin supersolid is characterized by the simultaneous breaking of lattice
translation and continuous spin rotation symmetries. In this work, we study a
spin-1 model with $U(2)\cong SU(2)\times U(1)/Z_2$ symmetry on the triangular
lattice, and the phase diagram is figured out using a variational $\mathbb
CP^2$ approach. We identify a novel $SU(2)$-supersolid phase which contains a
3-sublattice solid order and a spin-superfluid order. Unlike usual supersolid
phases having noncollinear magnetic order and only one Goldstone mode, the
$SU(2)$-supersolid phase has collinear Neel order and two Goldstone modes.
Another important feature of this supersolid is that the magnon excitation
spectrum has symmetry protected double degeneracy in the whole Brillouin zone.
As by-products, several other ordered phases are obtained, including the
ferromagnetic and the antiferromagnetic states breaking the $SU(2)$ symmetry,
as well as genuine phases that completely breaks the $U(2)$ symmetry.
Furthermore, the instabilities of $SU(3)$-flavor linear spin-wave theory are
consistent with the phase boundaries between different ordered phases.
%dispersions confirm the stability of the classically ordered phases and
provides insights into their excitation spectra.

### Defect-Charge-Driven 90° Switching in HfO2

Hafnium dioxide (HfO2) is a CMOS-compatible ferroelectric showing both
180{\deg} and 90{\deg} switching, yet the microscopic nature of the 90{\deg}
pathway remains unresolved. We show that the 90{\deg} rotation pathway,
negligible in pristine HfO2, becomes dominant under E// [111] when induced by
charged oxygen vacancies. This pathway is more fatigue-resistant than the
180{\deg} reversal pathway, while delivering the same polarization change along
[111] (2Pr=60 {\mu}C/cm^2 ). This charge-driven switching arises from two
factors: the crystal geometry of HfO2 and the intrinsic nature of rotational
pathways, the latter suggesting a possible general tendency for defect charge
to bias rotation over reversal in ferroelectrics. Together these findings
reveal a pathway-level origin of fatigue resistance and establish defect charge
as a general control parameter for polarization dynamics.

### Spin band geometry drives intrinsic thermal spin magnetization and current

Generating spin magnetization and spin currents without magnetic or electric
fields is a key frontier in spin caloritronics. Spin responses driven by
thermal gradients offer a promising route, though the band geometric origin of
intrinsic mechanisms, especially in non-magnetic materials, remains poorly
understood. Here we develop a unified quantum theory of thermal spin
magnetization and spin currents in itinerant electrons, rooted in spin band
geometry with both Fermi-surface and Fermi-sea contributions. We identify two
key geometric quantities: the spin-velocity metric tensor, which governs
thermal spin magnetization, and the spin geometric tensor, combining spin Berry
curvature and spin quantum metric, which generates thermal spin currents. These
intrinsic contributions persist and can even dominate in non-magnetic
insulators. Numerical calculations for chiral metal RhGe and antiferromagnet
CuMnAs demonstrate sizable thermal spin responses near band crossings. Our
results establish the band geometric origin of thermal spin transport and
provide guiding principles for discovering and engineering next-generation spin
caloritronic materials.

### Luttinger surface and exchange splitting induced by ferromagnetic fluctuations

Ferromagnetism in the single-orbital Hubbard model, which contains only local
Coulomb repulsion and no explicit ferromagnetic exchange interactions, has been
extensively studied. However, how the associated fluctuations influence the
electronic properties near the transition remains a fundamental issue. Here, by
applying the dynamical vertex approximation (D$\Gamma$A) to single-orbital
systems with a partially flat band dispersion, we demonstrate that
finite-correlation-length ferromagnetic fluctuations generate an emergent
Luttinger surface and drive a Fermi surface expansion reminiscent of exchange
splitting, even without magnetic order. We further derive an analytical
expression that reproduces these effects, clarifying the microscopic origin for
fluctuation-driven exchange splitting in correlated electron systems.

By means of the first-principles density functional theory (DFT),
I2-II-IV-VI4 type Cu-based quaternary chalcogenides Cu 2 XSiS 4 (X = Ge, Sn,
and Pb) have been thoroughly investigated. We report the study of Ge and Sn
substitution in the divalent cation site for their potential applications in
photovoltaics for the first time. The structural, electronic, optical, and
mechanical properties have been calculated. The structural and thermal
stability is verified by calculating the elastic constants, formation energy
and total potential energy at 300 K from the ab-initio molecular dynamics (MD)
simulation. The compounds under our investigation exhibited an indirect band
gap in the range of 1.0--1.56 eV, suitable for energy harvesting by trapping
the sunlight. The presence of absorption peaks within the visible region
complements their potential in photovoltaic applications. For further
validation, we have designed a model of a heterostructure
(FTO/TiO2/Cu2XSiS4/CuO/Au) solar cell, and a numerical simulation has been
performed by solving the Poisson equation and continuity equations to obtain
the I-V characteristic by using SCAPS-1D. All the inputs needed for solar- cell
simulation in SCAPS-1D have been taken from the DFT results. The corresponding
Power Conversion Efficiency (PCE) is denoted by {\eta}% and their respective
values for X=Ge, Sn and Pb are 23.46%, 23.29% and 22.60%, at room temperature.
The Ge-based system exhibits the highest {\eta}%, owing to its band gap value
in the visible range of the solar spectrum. Thus, we report that Ge-based
compounds may act as a promising absorber layer in heterostructure solar-cell
applications.

### Preformed Cooper Pairing and the Uncondensed Normal-State Component in Phase-Fluctuating Cuprate Superconductivity

We develop a self-consistent microscopic framework beyond mean-field theory
for superconductivity in cuprates. It couples fermionic quasiparticles with
collective phase dynamics to treat the superconducting gap and superfluid
stiffness. The phase sector explicitly incorporates both smooth bosonic
Nambu-Goldstone phase fluctuations, renormalized by long-range Coulomb
interactions, and topological Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless-type
vortex-antivortex fluctuations. The required input is the correlated
single-particle spectral function, enabling direct interfacing with
Hubbard-type models. The framework provides quantitative access to key
superconducting observables, including $T$-dependent gap and phase stiffness,
gap-closing temperature $T_{\rm os}$, and transition temperature $T_c$, across
wide ranges of doping. Using a recently proposed solvable interaction model as
input, our simulations reveal several important features consistent with
experimental observations in the cuprates: a $d$-wave superconducting dome in
the $T$-$p$ phase diagram with a shoulder-like anomaly in the underdoped
regime, a pronounced separation between $T_c$ and $T_{\rm os}$ signaling
preformed Cooper pairing, a finite uncondensed normal component persisting even
at $T=0$, and the onset temperature $T_{\rm on,vortex}$ of vortex signals,
offering a consistent understanding of how strong correlations and phase
fluctuations cooperate to shape high-$T_c$ superconductivity.

To predict the complex chemical evolution in multicomponent alloys, it is
highly desirable to have accurate atomistic simulation methods capable of
reaching sufficiently large spatial and temporal scales. In this work, we
advance the recently proposed SMC-X method through distributed computation on
either GPUs or CPUs, pushing both spatial and temporal scales of atomistic
simulation of chemically complex alloys to previously inaccessible scales. This
includes a 16-billion-atom HEA system extending to the micrometer regime in
space, and a 1-billion-atom HEA evolved over more than three million Monte
Carlo swap steps, approaching the minute regime in time. We show that such
large-scale simulations are essential for bridging the gap between experimental
observations and theoretical predictions of the nanoprecipitate sizes in HEAs,
based on analysis using the Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner (LSW) theory for
diffusion-controlled coarsening. This work demonstrates the great potential of
SMC-X for simulation-driven exploration of the chemical complexity in
high-entropy materials at large spatial and temporal scales.

In modern two-dimensional (2D) materials, such as graphene-based systems and
atomically-thin transition-metal dichalcogenides, the interplay of strong
electronic correlations, tunable moir\'e superlattices, and nontrivial band
topology has given rise to rich phase diagrams and collective phenomena. Among
the novel phases that have been realized, electronic crystals -- states of
matter in which itinerant electrons spontaneously crystallize -- play a
particularly prominent role. In this Review, we summarize the current status of
electron crystallization in van der Waals heterostructures, with emphasis on
the experimental platforms and measurement techniques that enable their study.
We also highlight open questions and outline future directions that may
elucidate more of the fascinating properties of electronic crystals.

### Computing finite--temperature elastic constants with noise cancellation

Elastic constants are central material properties, frequently reported in
experimental and theoretical studies. While their computation is
straightforward in the absence of thermal fluctuations, finite--temperature
methods often suffer from poor signal--to--noise ratios or the presence of
strong anharmonic effects. Here, we show how to compute elastic constants in
thermal ordered and disordered systems by generalizing a noise--cancellation
method originally developed for piezoelectric coupling coefficients. A slight
strain is applied to an equilibrated solid. Simulations of both the strained
and unstrained (or oppositely strained) reference systems are performed using
identical thermostatting schemes. As demonstrated theoretically and with
generic one--dimensional models, this allows stress differences to be evaluated
and elastic constants to be determined with much reduced thermal noise. We then
apply this approach across a diverse set of systems, spanning crystalline
argon, ordered silicon as well as amorphous silicon, poly(methyl methacrylate),
and cellulose derivatives.

### A GND-based back stress model for reverse loading in metal sheets with consideration of GNB

- **TL;DR**: 本研究提出了一种基于晶体塑性有限元方法（CPFEM）的物理驱动背应力模型，用于预测薄金属板材在复杂加载路径下的反向加载行为，解决了超薄板材压缩实验困难的问题。

Accurate prediction of springback and formability in sheet metal forming
requires understanding reverse loading behavior under complex loading path
changes, such as tension followed by compression. However, for ultra-thin
sheets experimental characterization of such behavior is difficult due to
compressive instability like plastic buckling. This study presents a crystal
plasticity finite element method (CPFEM) incorporating a physically motivated
back stress model based on geometrically necessary dislocations (GNDs) and
boundaries (GNBs). The model captures grain size effects, including the
Hall-Petch and Bauschinger effects, through a single grain size-dependent back
stress parameter, enabling reverse loading prediction using only tensile data
from specimens with different grain sizes. The back stress parameter was
calibrated by fitting tensile stress-strain curves from two microstructures -
one as-received and one annealed. Without using Tension-Compression (T-C) data
for calibration, the model accurately predicted reverse loading behavior in
low-carbon steel (0.64 mm thick) and Tension-Bending (T-B) responses in
ultra-thin SUS316 (0.083 mm thick) when the developed theory was incorporated
to an upscaled anisotropic hardening model. Identifiability analysis confirmed
that the model parameters are uniquely determined by the available data. This
physically interpretable framework provides an efficient and robust means to
predict reverse loading in thin metal sheets, overcoming experimental
limitations.

### Avalanche-like lithium intercalation and intraparticle correlations in graphite

Graphite is the most widely used anode material in lithium-ion batteries with
over 98% market share. However, despite its first application over 30 years
ago, the lithium insertion processes and associated dynamics in graphite remain
poorly understood, especially for the dilute stages. A fundamental
understanding of how the symmetry-breaking phase transitions occur
pseudo-continuously under operating conditions is still lacking. Here, we
provide a unified picture of ion intercalation dynamics during the dilute
stages of graphite intercalation, using operando optical microscopy combined
with random field Ising modelling. We show that during the dilute stages,
single graphite particle undergoes rapid, localised avalanche-like
(de)intercalation, leading to micron-sized regions (de)intercalating within
seconds. These avalanches are reminiscent of phase transition behaviour seen in
disordered materials such as martensitic transformations, Barkhausen noise and
ferroelectric/elastic materials - associated with step changes in the order
parameter, where the system changes from one phase to another under an applied
driving force by jumping from one metastable state to another. Here, using a
modified random field Ising model, we relate these avalanches to static
disorder in graphite, which disrupts ion filling dynamics, leading to
pseudo-continuous transitions between stages, accounting for the experimental
electrochemistry profile as well as the temperature dependent avalanche
dynamics. Finally, we develop a methodology to spatio-temporally analyse
avalanches between intraparticle regions, revealing spatially heterogeneous
connectivity and temporal patterns between regions during the dilute stages.
Our work highlights the role of local and static disorder in eliciting
unexpected phase transition behaviour, and provides new tools and concepts for
studying layered battery materials.

### Low Temperature MOCVD Synthesis of high-mobility 2D InSe

Two-dimensional (2D) indium selenide (InSe) is a layered semiconductor with
high electron mobility and a tunable band gap ranging from 1.25 eV in the bulk
to 2.8 eV in the monolayer limit. These properties make these materials strong
candidates for future logic and optoelectronic devices. However, growing
phase-pure InSe remains challenging due to the complex indium-selenium (In-Se)
phase diagram. This complexity and the sensitivity of chemical precursors to
growth conditions make it difficult to control which In-Se phase forms during
synthesis during, e.g., metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD).
Despite the challenges, MOCVD is considered the most promising approach for
growing InSe, as it enables wafer-scale, uniform, and controllable
deposition-key requirements for device integration. In this study, we present a
systematic investigation of InSe synthesis via MOCVD on c-plane sapphire
substrates at low temperatures, which are highly relevant for various
integration schemes. By varying the Se/In precursor ratio and the growth
temperature, we create a phase diagram that covers the In-rich, equal
stoichiometric, and Se-rich InxSey phases. Raman spectroscopy and atomic force
microscopy, supported by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and scanning
transmission electron microscopy, confirm conditions, under which the formation
of 2D InSe is observed. Atomically-resolved cross-sectional scanning
transmission electron microscopy also reveals an epitaxial alignment of the
InSe with the sapphire substrate mediated by a specific interface
reconstruction. The epitaxial alignment is verified by in-plane X-ray
diffraction across large length scales. Samples grown under optimized
conditions exhibit a strong optical absorption in the visible range and
especially a comparably high electron mobility underlining the potential of the
MOCVD-grown material for future applications.

The study of topological properties in magnetic materials has long been one
of the forefront research areas in condensed matter physics. CrSb, as a
prototypical candidate material for altermagnetism, has attracted significant
attention due to its unique magnetic properties. This system provides a novel
platform for exploring the intrinsic relationship between altermagnetic order
and exotic topological states. In this study, we combine systematic electrical
transport experiments with first-principles calculations to investigate the
possible realization mechanisms of topological semimetal states in CrSb and
their manifestations in quantum transport phenomena. Our high field
magneto-transport measurements reveal that the magnetoresistance of CrSb
exhibits no sign of saturation up to 35 T, following a distinct power-law
dependence with an exponent of 1.48. The nonlinear Hall resistivity further
indicates a multiband charge transport mechanism. Under high magnetic fields,
we observe pronounced Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) quantum oscillations and
discernible Zeeman-effect-induced band splitting at 1.6 K. Systematic Fermi
surface and band calculations combined with Berry phase analysis confirm the
nontrivial topological character of this material (with a Berry phase
approaching {\pi}). These findings not only provide crucial experimental
evidence for understanding the electronic structure of CrSb, but also establish
an important foundation for investigating topological quantum states in
altermagnets.
