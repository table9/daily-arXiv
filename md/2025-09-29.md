The dynamical balance of the pairing term plays a crucial role in the
emergence of topological superconductivity in the p-wave spinless Kitaev chain,
particularly in the non-Hermitian regime. In this work, we systematically
investigate the effects of non-Hermitian pairing terms on both equilibrium and
nonequilibrium phenomena in the Kitaev chain. Our analysis focuses on two
representative forms of pairing imbalance: uniform and staggered. We
demonstrate that a uniform imbalance induces only minor perturbations to the
spectrum and dynamical properties, without significantly affecting its
equilibrium phase or nonequilibrium steady behavior. In contrast, even a slight
staggered imbalance leads to drastic changes. At the symmetry point, it enables
the resonant generation of two distinct superconducting states through critical
dynamics, with the realized state determined by the direction of the bias. Both
states exhibit exact off-diagonal long-range order (ODLRO) in the thermodynamic
limit. Our results emphasize the fragility of coherent dynamics in
non-Hermitian topological systems and elucidate the interplay among
non-Hermiticity, topology, and dynamical criticality in quench processes.

### Extending the optical absorption in a lumped element meander structure to far-infrared wavelengths

- **TL;DR**: 该研究通过电磁仿真和实验验证，开发了适用于远红外波长（&gt;10μm）的集总元件动力学电感探测器（LEKID），在12-50μm波长范围内实现了高达95%的吸收效率。

Superconducting radiation detectors typically exhibit detection and single
photon sensitivity limited to the mid infrared wavelength range. Extending
their detection capabilities into the far infrared range (&gt;10 um) requires
careful selection of substrate materials and detector geometries. The overall
detection efficiency is linked to absorption and coupling efficiencies. In this
study, the resonator geometry and absorption efficiency were estimated using
electromagnetic simulations in CST Microwave Studio for a lumped-element
meander structure. Simulations were performed for the 12 to 50 um wavelength
range, corresponding to the Infrared Free Electron Laser (IR FEL) at RRCAT,
Indore. Absorption in the meander inductor was influenced by the substrate
material, thickness, and impedance matching between the detector and incident
photon medium. The results indicate that SiO2 and diamond substrates are
suitable for developing lumped-element kinetic inductance detectors (LEKID) in
this range. Optimized meander geometries on diamond substrates demonstrated
absorption efficiencies of up to 95% for narrow bandwidths and over 50% for
wide bandwidths. A 30-pixel LEKID structure was fabricated using electron beam
lithography on a 500 um SiO2 coated Si substrate, with a 20 nm thick Ti40V60
alloy resonator. Experimental absorption efficiency was determined through
transmission and reflection measurements. Results show that in the 14 to 26 um
IR-FEL range, the LEKID achieved up to 75% absorption efficiency. These studies
demonstrate that the LEKID structure is ideal for detecting far infrared
wavelengths above 10 um, with high absorption efficiency.

We studied the superconductivity of high-entropy Hf-Nb-Ta-Ti-Zr alloy films
affected by structural order. While films deposited from the same target on a
substrate with a room temperature are amorphous, and if superconducting, only
at temperatures below 1.9 K, films deposited on a substrate with a temperature
of 740 $^o$C and 630 $^o$C are superconducting with a critical temperature of
6.61 K and 6.63 K, respectively. The observed effect of structural order on
superconductivity can be explained by the theory of superconductivity in
strongly bound amorphous materials recently published by Baggioli et al.

We report the observation of superconductivity in cubic La3Al single crystal.
It shows a metallic behavior at a normal state without observable structural
transition and enters the superconducting state below Tc ~ 6.32 K. Detailed
characterizations and analysis indicate that cubic La3Al is a bulk type-II BCS
superconductor. Moreover, theoretical calculations show that it can host
interstitial anionic electrons, which are located at the body center of cubic
unit cell, and confirm the electron-phonon coupling as the superconducting
mechamism. Thus, cubic La3Al can be regarded as an novel electride
superconductor.

### Interpretable Spectral Features Predict Conductivity in Self-Driving Doped Conjugated Polymer Labs

- **TL;DR**: 该论文提出了一种结合遗传算法和SHAP分析的方法，从光学光谱中学习可解释的特征指纹，用于预测掺杂共轭聚合物的电导率，从而减少直接测量的实验成本。

Self-driving labs (SDLs) promise faster materials discovery by coupling
automation with machine learning, but a central challenge is predicting costly,
slow-to-measure properties from inexpensive, automatable readouts. We address
this for doped conjugated polymers by learning interpretable spectral
fingerprints from optical spectroscopy to predict electrical conductivity.
Optical spectra are fast, non-destructive, and sensitive to aggregation and
charge generation; we automate their featurization by combining a genetic
algorithm (GA) with area-under-the-curve (AUC) computations over adaptively
selected spectral windows. These data-driven spectral features, together with
processing parameters, are used to train a quantitative structure-property
relationship (QSPR) linking optical response and processing to conductivity. To
improve accuracy and interpretability in the small-data regime, we add
domain-knowledge-based feature expansions and apply SHAP-guided selection to
retain a compact, physically meaningful feature set. The pipeline is evaluated
under a leak-free train/test protocol, and GA is repeated to assess feature
stability. The data-driven model matches the performance of a baseline built
from expert-curated descriptors while reducing experimental effort (about 33%)
by limiting direct conductivity measurements. Combining data-driven and expert
features yields a hybrid QSPR with superior predictive performance,
highlighting productive human-ML collaboration. The learned features recover
known descriptors in pBTTT (0-0/0-1 vibronic intensity ratio) and reveal a
tail-state region correlated with polymer bleaching during successful doping.
This approach delivers interpretable, noise-robust, small-data-friendly
features that convert rapid measurements into reliable predictions of costly
properties and readily extends to other spectral modalities (e.g., XANES,
Raman, FTIR).

### Real Space Imaging of Spin Scattering in Chirality-Induced Spin Selectivity

The interaction between electron spin and molecular chirality plays a
fundamental role in quantum phenomena, with significant implications for
spintronics and quantum computing. The chirality-induced spin selectivity
(CISS) effect, where chiral materials preferentially transmit electrons of a
particular spin, has sparked intense interest and debate regarding its
underlying mechanism. Despite extensive research, the spatial distribution of
spin polarization in chiral systems, the key evidence to reveal the spin
scattering mechanism in CISS, has remained experimentally elusive particularly
due to complications arising from spin-orbit coupling in metal electrodes
typically used in such studies. Here we show, through reflective magnetic
circular dichroism measurements on chiral tellurium nanowires with graphene
electrodes, that current-induced spin polarization exhibits identical signs in
both the nanowire and electrodes, distinct from the presumed spin filter
scenario. The observed spin polarization scales linearly with current
amplitude, aligns parallel to the current direction, reverses with chirality or
current flow, and demonstrates spin relaxation lengths of several micrometers
into graphene. Our findings provide the first direct visualization of spatial
spin distribution in chiral devices. This work establishes a new paradigm for
investigating spin-dependent phenomena in chiral materials and opens avenues
for developing chirality-based spintronic and quantum devices.

### Data-driven approach to the design of complexing agents for trivalent transuranium elements

- **TL;DR**: 使用机器学习方法创建新的神经网络架构，利用现有实验数据改进模型质量，用于研究超铀元素配合物的性质。

The properties of complexes with transuranium elements have long been the
object of research in various fields of chemistry. However, their experimental
study is complicated by their rarity, high cost and special conditions
necessary for working with such elements, and the complexity of quantum
chemical calculations does not allow their use for large systems. To overcome
these problems, we used modern machine learning methods to create a novel
neural network architecture that allows to use available experimental data on a
number of elements and thus significantly improve the quality of the resulting
models. We also described the applicability domain of the presented model and
identified the molecular fragments that most influence the stability of the
complexes.

### The correlated cluster mean-field approach to the frustrated Ising model on the honeycomb lattice

- **TL;DR**: 该研究分析了蜂窝晶格上的J1-J2伊辛模型，发现随着系统接近最大阻挫点(J2/J1=-1/4)，铁磁-顺磁相变温度趋近于零，且热力学量表明在-1/4&lt;J2/J1≤0范围内仅存在连续相变。

We study the $J_1$-$J_2$ Ising model on the honeycomb lattice, considering
ferromagnetic interactions between first neighbors ($J_1$) and
antiferromagnetic interactions between second neighbors ($J_2$). Our analysis
is based on the correlated cluster mean field theory, which is adapted to
incorporate competing interactions, providing estimates for the behavior of
magnetization, internal energy, entropy, specific heat, and short-range
correlations of the model. Our results indicate that the transition temperature
of the ferromagnetic-paramagnetic phase transition decreases toward zero as the
frustration maximum ($J_2/J_1 = -1/4$) is approached, and the thermodynamic
quantities indicate only continuous phase transitions for $-1/4&lt;J_2/J_1 \leq
0$. The critical temperature and the nature of phase transitions provided by
the correlated cluster mean-field method are in excellent agreement with very
recent Monte Carlo simulations for the model. Furthermore, the specific heat
exhibits a broad maximum within the PM phase under strong frustration,
suggesting the onset of a correlated paramagnetic state with high entropy
content at low temperatures. Therefore, our findings support that frustration
not only suppresses the ferromagnetic long-range order, but also drives
significant changes in the thermodynamics and short-range correlations of the
model.

### Pathways from a chiral superconductor to a composite Fermi liquid

- **TL;DR**: 该论文研究了手性超导体与复合费米液体(CFL)之间的相变行为，发现在弱吸引相互作用下，两者之间通常存在稳定的朗道费米液体(LFL)中间相，而非直接连续相变。

Recent experiments have reported chiral time-reversal broken
superconductivity in $n$-layer rhombohedral graphene for $n = 4,5, 6$.
Introducing a moir\'e potential by alignement with a hexagonal boron nitride
substrate suppresses the superconductivity but leads instead to various
fractional quantum anomalous Hall phenomena. Motivated by these observations,
we consider the fate of the phase transition between (a chiral) Landau Fermi
liquid (LFL) metal and a Composite Fermi Liquid (CFL) metal in the presence of
attractive interactions. These are parent states, respectively, for the
superconductor and the fractional quantum Hall states. For weak attractive
interactions, the LFL is usually unstable to superconductivity while the CFL is
stable. This raises the possibility of a direct continuous phase transition
between the chiral superconductor and the CFL. However, we show that
generically the LFL close to the transition to the CFL is stable against
superconductivity. Thus the evolution between the CFL and chiral superconductor
goes through an intermediate stable LFL phase for weak attractive interactions.
With stronger interactions, the evolution can instead go through a non-Abelian
paired quantum Hall state.

### Fracture-Driven Single Bubble Grows and Migration Model in Aquatic Muds

- **TL;DR**: 该论文提出了一个甲烷单气泡在泥质水生沉积物中浮力驱动增长的模型，结合了线性弹性断裂力学和溶质交换动力学，通过先进的网格策略优化计算效率。

Methane (CH$_4$) is the most prevalent hydrocarbon and a significant
greenhouse gas found in the atmosphere. Buoyancy-driven CH$_4$ bubble growth
and migration within muddy aquatic sediments are closely associated with
sediment fracturing. This paper presents a model of buoyancy-driven CH$_4$
single bubble growth in fine-grained cohesive (muddy) aquatic sediment. * Solid
mechanics model component simulates bubble elastic expansion caused by solute
supply from the surrounding mud, followed by differential fracturing of the mud
by the evolving bubble front, a process governed by the principles of Linear
Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM). This differential fracturing controls the
evolving shape and size of the bubble. * The model integrates the LEFM with the
dynamics of solute exchange between the bubble and the surrounding mud,
alongside the conservation of CH$_4$ gas within the bubble. * An advanced
meshing strategy allows balancing between the geometry resolution and the
amount of mesh elements, thereby optimizing for both solution accuracy and
computational efficiency. This model is intended to be a foundational tool for
proper upscaling of single bubble characteristics to effective gassy medium
theories. This will enhance the accuracy of the acoustic applications and could
contribute to evaluation of overall CH$_4$ emission from the aquatic muds.

### Investigation of Parasitic Two-Level Systems in Merged-Element Transmon Qubits

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种新型的合并元件transmon量子比特（mergemon），通过将约瑟夫森结设计成自身的并联电容器，显著减小了量子比特的物理尺寸，将能量主要限制在结区内，从而减少了表面缺陷对相干性的影响。

In conventional transmon qubits, decoherence is dominated by a large number
of parasitic two-level systems (TLS) residing at the edges of its large area
coplanar shunt capacitor and junction leads. Avoiding these defects by
improvements in design, fabrication and materials proved to be a significant
challenge that so far led to limited progress. The merged-element transmon
qubit (''mergemon''), a recently proposed paradigm shift in transmon design,
attempts to address these issues by engineering the Josephson junction to act
as its own shunt capacitor. With its energy mostly confined within the
junctions, efforts required to improve qubit coherence can be concentrated on
the junction barrier, a potentially easier to control interface compared to
exposed circuit areas. Incorporating an additional aluminium deposition and
oxidation into the in-situ bandaged Niemeyer-Dolan technique, we were able to
fabricate flux-tunable mergemon qubits achieving mean $T_{1}$ relaxation times
of up to $130\mu s$ ($Q \approx 3.3 \times 10^{6}$). TLS spectroscopy under
applied strain and electric fields, together with systematic design variations,
revealed that even for mergemon qubits - despite their significantly reduced
footprint and increased junction barrier volume - careful design considerations
are still essential to avoid coherence limitations due to surface loss.

### Strain-tunability of the multipolar Berry curvature in altermagnet MnTe

- **TL;DR**: 本文通过单轴应力调控MnTe中的反常霍尔效应，证明了交变磁体具有多极贝里曲率特性，并在临界应变0.14%时观测到反常霍尔电导率符号反转。

The anomalous Hall effect describes the generation of a transverse voltage by
a longitudinal current even in the absence of an external magnetic field. While
typically observed in ferromagnets, it has also been predicted to arise in
altermagnets, materials characterized by rotational symmetries that enable
broken time reversal symmetry despite compensated collinear magnetic ordering.
These symmetries enforce band (anti)crossings that can generate significant
contributions to the Berry curvature that drives the anomalous Hall effect.
This Berry curvature is predicted to exhibit a characteristic multipolar order,
resulting in a symmetry-enforced distribution at or near net compensation which
is highly sensitive to perturbations that distort this balance. However,
exploring the predicted multipolar Berry curvature of altermagnets and its
reversible manipulation remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate evidence for
the multipolar nature of the altermagnetic Berry curvature in MnTe by tuning
the anomalous Hall effect via uniaxial stress. Upon straining, the magnitude of
the anomalous Hall conductivity changes and, at a critical strain of 0.14%, the
sign is reversed. Symmetry analysis and density functional theory calculations
reveal that this tunability is a direct consequence of the altermagnetic
multipolar Berry curvature. Our results provide insight into the role of
crystal and magnetic symmetries in the realization of higher-order Berry
curvature distributions and their unique tunability.

### A comprehensive equivalent circuit model for high overtone bulk acoustic resonators (HBARs)

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种新的高次谐波体声波谐振器(HBAR)等效电路模型，能够准确建模HBAR的复杂频谱特性，并通过61个模式的同时拟合验证了模型的有效性。

This paper presents a new and comprehensive equivalent circuit model for high
overtone bulk acoustic resonators (HBARs). HBARs demonstrate several very sharp
resonance modes distributed nearly periodically over a very wide frequency
range. This spectrum response of HBARs offers unique advantages but poses
significant modeling challenges. The proposed circuit incorporates and models
the unique physical components of the HBAR: piezoelectric transducer, substrate
(a perfectly periodic multimode cavity), piezoelectric coupling, and
critically, the imperfectly matched transducer-substrate interface which
imparts characteristic aperiodicity to the HBAR mode spectrum. By judicious use
of fixed, periodic, or tightly constrained virtual lumped-element branches, and
sets of branches, the model retains clear and intuitive links to the physical
device, while reducing the complexity needed for fitting dense, broadband
datasets. We demonstrate the validity and power of this model by simultaneously
fitting measured data for 61 modes of a GaN/NbN/sapphire HBAR over a span of 1
GHz, and extracting modal parameters such as quality factors and coupling
coefficients. We show that this new model is compact and yet scalable: by
leveraging the inherent internal relationships in an HBAR, the model can be
easily expanded to include multiple transducer overtones and envelopes,
multiple distinct transducers, and spurious modes. In addition to fitting
measured datasets, the new model can also be used to easily analyze various
perturbations to the nominal state of the HBAR. We expect the new model to be
useful for the design of classical HBAR-based oscillators, filters, and
sensors, and for the integration of HBARs into quantum circuits.

### Smearing of dynamical quantum phase transitions in dissipative free-fermion systems

- **TL;DR**: 研究耗散二次费米子系统中的约化Loschmidt回声动力学，发现在纯增益或纯损耗过程中可以保持非解析性，但当增益和损耗通道同时存在时非解析性会完全消失。

We investigate the Lindblad dynamics of the reduced Loschmidt echo (RLE) in
dissipative quadratic fermion systems. Focusing on the case of gain and loss
dissipation, we derive general conditions for the persistence of
nonanalyticities (so-called dynamical quantum phase transitions) in the time
evolution of the RLE. We show that nonanalyticities that are present in the
corresponding unitary dynamics can survive under purely gain or purely loss
processes, but are completely smeared out as soon as both channels are active,
even if one is infinitesimally small. These results hold for generic
dissipative Gaussian evolutions, and are illustrated explicitly for the quench
from the N\'eel state in the tight-binding chain, as well as for the quantum
Ising chain. We also show that the subtle interplay between dissipative and
unitary dynamics gives rise to a nested lightcone structure in the dynamics of
the RLE, even in cases where this structure is not present in the corresponding
unitary evolution, due to coherent cancellations in the phase structure of the
wavefunction.

### Spin-basis wavefunctions for the one-dimensional Kitaev model

- **TL;DR**: 提出了自旋基下的基态波函数，用于一维自旋-S Kitaev模型，通过价键排列描述基态，其中键具有单重态或三重态特征。

Magnetic phases with quantum entanglement are often expressed in terms of
parton wavefunctions. Relatively few examples are known where wavefunctions can
be directly written down in the spin basis. In this article, we consider the
spin-$S$ Kitaev model in one dimension. For $S=1/2$, its eigenstates can be
written using a Jordan-Wigner fermionic representation. Here, we present ground
state wavefunctions for any $S$ directly in the spin basis. The states we
propose are valence bond arrangements, with bonds having singlet or triplet
character for $S=1/2$. For $S&gt;1/2$, we use bond-states that serve as analogues
of singlets and triplets. We establish the validity of our wavefunctions using
a perturbative approach starting from an anisotropic limit, with key features
surviving to all orders in perturbation theory. For half-integer $S$ and
periodic boundaries, we have exponential ground state degeneracy. The ground
states have topological character, with an even number of `triplets' superposed
on a background of `singlets'. For integer $S$, a unique ground state emerges,
composed purely of `triplets'. Our spin-basis wavefunctions, while not exact,
capture the dominant weight of the ground state(s). We obtain good agreement
against exact diagonalization wavefunctions and Jordan-Wigner spectra.

### Enhancing Molecular Dipole Moment Prediction with Multitask Machine Learning

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种多任务机器学习策略，通过同时训练量子偶极矩和廉价的Mulliken原子电荷来改进分子偶极矩预测。即使辅助数据定量可靠性有限，也能提供有价值的物理洞察。

We present a multitask machine learning strategy for improving the prediction
of molecular dipole moments by simultaneously training on quantum dipole
magnitudes and inexpensive Mulliken atomic charges. With dipole magnitudes as
the primary target and assuming only scalar dipole values are available without
vector components we examine whether incorporating lower quality labels that do
not quantitatively reproduce the target property can still enhance model
accuracy. Mulliken charges were chosen intentionally as an auxiliary task,
since they lack quantitative accuracy yet encode qualitative physical
information about charge distribution. Our results show that including Mulliken
charges with a small weight in the loss function yields up to a 30% improvement
in dipole prediction accuracy. This multitask approach enables the model to
learn a more physically grounded representation of charge distributions,
thereby improving both the accuracy and consistency of dipole magnitude
predictions. These findings highlight that even auxiliary data of limited
quantitative reliability can provide valuable qualitative physical insights,
ultimately strengthening the predictive power of machine learning models for
molecular properties.

### Limitations of detecting structural changes and time-reversal symmetry breaking in scanning tunneling microscopy experiments

- **TL;DR**: 本文质疑了kagome超导体RbV3Sb5中磁场诱导晶格和电荷密度波变化的实验发现，指出这些现象实际上是扫描隧道显微镜实验中的伪影，而非本征的压磁效应。

The family of kagome superconductors $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A$=K, Cs, Rb) is an
exciting playground for investigating various density waves, unusual
superconductivity and a surprising time-reversal symmetry breaking despite the
absence of spin magnetism. The origin of time-reversal symmetry breaking has
been of particular interest, and conflicting results have been intensely
debated. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) provided crucial evidence by the
observation that apparent chirality associated with the 2 $\times$ 2 charge
density wave (CDW) may be modified by the direction of magnetic field, a
phenomenon observed in select sample areas in some experiments, but not others.
Related to this, Xing et al. investigated the effects of magnetic and electric
fields on the 2 $\times$ 2 CDW state and the lattice structure of kagome
superconductor RbV$_3$Sb$_5$. They report a $\sim$ 1% change in the in-plane
lattice constants, concomitant with the CDW intensities modification,
controlled by the field direction. This was interpreted as a rare case of
piezomagnetism. Here we show how the apparent magnetic field induced lattice
and CDW intensity change is a consequence of two independent experimental
artifacts: reconfiguration of atoms at the STM tip apex that alter the
amplitudes of CDW modulations, and piezo creep, hysteresis, and thermal drift
that artificially distort STM topographs. We find no evidence supporting that
magnetic field leads to intrinsic changes in the sample, which challenges
reported piezomagnetism.

Chirality in quantum materials is a topic of significant importance due to
its profound effects on the electronic, magnetic, and optical properties of
these systems. However, it is non-trivial to decouple the behavior of two
enantiomorphs within the same material -- perhaps explaining why the influence
of chirality on electrical properties has remained largely unexplored. In this
work, we examine the electrical conductivity, magnetoresistance, and thermal
expansion coefficient of LaRhC$_{2}$ -- a compound with a chiral crystal
structure (tetragonal symmetry, space groups $\textit{P}$4$_{1}$ or
$\textit{P}$4$_{3}$). The identification of a suitable monochiral domain was
achieved via electron backscatter diffraction, which simultaneously determines
crystallographic orientation and handedness. Both enantiomorphs are confirmed
by single-crystal X-ray diffraction on monochiral specimens. The analysis of
electrical resistivity was made possible through the single-domain extraction
of enantiopure specimens from a polycrystalline sample using focused ion beam
techniques. We establish that LaRhC$_{2}$ is a semiconductor with band gaps of
approximately 20 meV and 33 meV parallel and perpendicular to the fourfold
screw axis of the crystal structure, respectively -- consistent with band
structure calculations. A significant anisotropy is also observed in the
thermal expansion, electrical resistivity as well as angular-dependent
magnetoresistance parallel and perpendicular o [001] crystallographic
directions.

We review the fabrication and transport characterization of hexagonal boron
nitride (hBN)/Bernal bilayer graphene (BLG) moir\'e superlattices. Due to the
moir\'e effect, the hBN/BLG moir\'e superlattices exhibit an energy gap at the
charge neutrality point (CNP) even in the absence of a perpendicular electric
field. In BLG, the application of a perpendicular electric field tunes the
energy gap at the CNP, which contrasts with single-layer graphene and is
similar to the family of rhombohedral multilayer graphene. The hBN/BLG moir\'e
superlattice is associated with non-trivial energy-band topology and a narrow
energy band featuring a van Hove singularity. By employing a dual-gated device
structure where both the perpendicular displacement field and the carrier
density are individually controllable, systematic engineering of the
energy-band structure can be achieved. The data presented here demonstrate the
universality and diversity in the physics of hBN/BLG moir\'e superlattices.

### PhenoMoler: Phenotype-Guided Molecular Optimization via Chemistry Large Language Model

- **TL;DR**: PhenoMoler是一个表型引导的分子生成框架，通过整合化学大语言模型和表达谱，实现生物学信息指导的药物设计。

Current molecular generative models primarily focus on improving drug-target
binding affinity and specificity, often neglecting the system-level phenotypic
effects elicited by compounds. Transcriptional profiles, as molecule-level
readouts of drug-induced phenotypic shifts, offer a powerful opportunity to
guide molecular design in a phenotype-aware manner. We present PhenoMoler, a
phenotype-guided molecular generation framework that integrates a chemistry
large language model with expression profiles to enable biologically informed
drug design. By conditioning the generation on drug-induced differential
expression signatures, PhenoMoler explicitly links transcriptional responses to
chemical structure. By selectively masking and reconstructing specific
substructures-scaffolds, side chains, or linkers-PhenoMoler supports
fine-grained, controllable molecular optimization. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PhenoMoler generates chemically valid, novel, and diverse
molecules aligned with desired phenotypic profiles. Compared to FDA-approved
drugs, the generated compounds exhibit comparable or enhanced drug-likeness
(QED), optimized physicochemical properties, and superior binding affinity to
key cancer targets. These findings highlight PhenoMoler's potential for
phenotype-guided and structure-controllable molecular optimization.

### Mean-field theory of the general-spin Ising model

Motivated by modelling in physics and other disciplines, such as sociology
and psychology, we derive the mean field of the general-spin Ising model from
the variational principle of the Gibbs free energy. The general-spin Ising
model has $2k+1$ spin values, generated by $-(k-j)/k$, with $j=0,1,2\ldots,2k$,
such that for $k=1$ we obtain $-1,0,1$, for example; the Hamiltonian is
identical to that of the standard Ising model. The general-spin Ising model
exhibits spontaneous magnetisation, similar to the standard Ising model, but
with the location translated by a factor depending on the number of categories
$2k+1$. We also show how the accuracy of the mean field depends on both the
number of nodes and node degree, and that the hysteresis effect decreases and
saturates with the number of categories $2k+1$. Monte Carlo simulations confirm
the theoretical results.

### Low-energy photoexcitation inside the Mott gap in doped Hubbard and t-J ladders

We investigate changes in the optical conductivity of doped Mott insulators
by tuning ultrashort pump pulses to target either the Drude or low-energy
absorption regions. Using a hole-doped two-leg Hubbard ladder and a four-leg
t-J ladders, we calculate the optical conductivity after pump by employing the
time-dependent density matrix renormalization group. We find that a monocycle
electric field pulse tuned to the Drude absorption reduces the Drude weight,
accompanied by a slight enhancement in the mid-infrared (mid-IR) spectral
weight. However, this enhancement diminishes as the pulse intensity increases.
In contrast, a pump pulse tuned to the mid-IR absorption only affects the Drude
weight. This behavior arises because the mid-IR absorption originates from
magnetic excitations that do not couple directly to photons. These predictions
can be tested experimentally by applying ultrashort low-energy pump pulses to
cuprate materials.

- **TL;DR**: 研究发现超小型Hf$_x$Zr$_{1-x}$O$_{2-y}$纳米颗粒具有超顺磁响应和巨介电常数，归因于表面氧空位引起的磁性状态和超顺电状态，为开发硅兼容多铁性材料提供了新途径。

We observed a superparamagnetic-type response of ultra-small (5 - 10 nm in
size) Hf$_x$Zr$_{1-x}$O$_{2-y}$ nanoparticles prepared by the solid-state
organonitrate synthesis. The Raman spectra indicate the decisive role of
surface defects, presumably oxygen vacancies, for all studied x = 1, 0.6, 0.5,
0.4 and significant degree "y" of oxygen deficiency. At the same time elemental
analysis did not reveal any noticeable concentration of magnetic impurities in
theHf$_x$Zr$_{1-x}$O$_{2-y}$ nanopowders, and the X-ray diffraction analysis
reveals the dominant presence (from 87 to 96 wt. %) of the orthorhombic phase.
Therefore, the superparamagnetic response of the nanoparticles is explained by
the appearance of magnetic state of oxygen vacancies accumulated near their
surface. The Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire approach, density functional theory
calculations and dielectric measurements reveal that the studied ultra-small
Hf$_x$Zr$_{1-x}$O$_{2-y}$ nanoparticles may have ferroelectric-like properties
and giant dielectric permittivity (&gt; 10^3 - 10^5) in the frequency range 4 Hz -
10 kHz. In this work we observed that the static relative dielectric
permittivity of the Hf$_x$Zr$_{1-x}$O$_{2-y}$ nanopowders overcomes 10^6 and
related the colossal values with the superparaelectric states of the
ultra-small cores of the nanoparticles.Thus, obtained results open the way for
the creation of silicon-compatible multiferroics - oxygen-deficient
Hf$_x$Zr$_{1-x}$O$_{2-y}$ nanoparticles with the superparamagnetic and
superparaelectric properties, indispensable ultra-high k nanomaterials for
advanced FETs and electronic logic elements.

The antiferromagnets with the time-reversal symmetry broken magnetic
structures possess a finite spin splitting in the momentum space, and may
contribute to a realization of a finite tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) effect
even with magnets with zero net spin polarization. In this paper, we study the
TMR effect with the noncollinear antiferromagnet $\mathrm{Mn_{3}Sn}$ whose
inverse $120^{\circ}$ antiferromagnetic order breaks the time-reversal
symmetry. In particular, we employ the representative barrier material
$\mathrm{MgO}$ as the tunnel insulator, and calculate the TMR effect in the
$\mathrm{Mn_{3}Sn}(01\bar{1}0)/\mathrm{MgO}(110)/\mathrm{Mn_{3}Sn}$ magnetic
tunnel junctions (MTJs), which has an optimal geometry for the spin-orbit
torque switching of the magnetic configurations. We show that a finite TMR
ratio reaching $\gtrsim 1000\%$ appears in the
$\mathrm{Mn_{3}Sn}/\mathrm{MgO}/\mathrm{Mn_{3}Sn}$ MTJs, which is due to the
spin splitting properties of $\mathrm{Mn_{3}Sn}$ in the momentum space combined
with the screening effect of $\mathrm{MgO}$.

We formulate and implement the core-valence separated multireference
equation-of-motion driven similarity renormalization group method
(CVS-IP-EOM-DSRG) for simulating X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) of strongly
correlated molecular systems. This method is numerically robust and
computationally efficient, delivering accurate core-ionization energies with
O(N^4) scaling relative to basis set size N in the EOM step. To ensure rigorous
core intensivity, we propose a simple modification of the ground-state MR-DSRG
formalism. We develop and compare three variants of the theory based on
different approximations of the effective Hamiltonian: two derived from
low-order perturbative methods (DSRG-MRPT2 and DSRG-MRPT3), and one from a
non-perturbative scheme truncated to 1- and 2-body operators [MR-LDSRG(2)]. We
benchmark the CVS-IP-EOM-DSRG methods by computing vertical core-ionization
energies for a representative molecular test set and comparing results against
established single-reference and multireference methods. To demonstrate the
applicability of CVS-IP-EOM-DSRG to strongly correlated systems, we compute the
potential energy curves and vibrationally resolved XPS of N2 and CO and the XPS
of ozone. Comparison with experimental data and other high-level theoretical
results shows that all three CVS-IP-EOM-DSRG variants accurately predict
vertical ionization energies, but only DSRG-MRPT3 and MR-LDSRG(2) levels of
theory reliably capture the full dissociation behavior and reproduce the
experimental vibrational structure.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了马尔可夫跳跃过程中自主二分系统的信息流分解方法，将其分为维持性和超额两个分量。

We propose a decomposition of information flow into housekeeping and excess
components for autonomous bipartite systems subject to Markov jump processes.
We introduce this decomposition by using the geometric structure of probability
currents and the conjugate thermodynamic forces. The housekeeping component
arises from the cyclic modes caused by the detailed balance violations and
maintains the correlations between the two subsystems. In contrast, the excess
component, is a contribution of conservative forces that alters the mutual
information between the two subsystems. With this decomposition, we generalize
previous results, such as the second law of information thermodynamics, the
cyclic decomposition, and the information-thermodynamic extensions of
thermodynamic trade-off relations.

In this work, we study the spin-1/2 Kitaev chain with additional XX and
symmetric off-diagonal Gamma interactions. By a combination of Jordan-Wigner
transformation and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) numerical
simulations, we obtain the exact solution of the model and map out the phase
diagram containing six distinct phases. The four gapped phases display
ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic magnetic orders along the (1, 1, 0)- and
(1, -1, 0)-spin directions, whereas in the gapless phases, the low energy
spectrum consists of two branches of helical Majorana fermions with unequal
velocities. Transition lines separating different phases include deconfined
quantum critical lines with dynamical critical exponent z = 1 and quadratic
critical lines with z = 2. Our work reveals the rich interplay among symmetry,
magnetic order, and quantum criticality in the Kitaev-XX-Gamma chain

- **TL;DR**: 研究发现，在方形t-J模型中，s波配对态在高掺杂水平下具有与d波态相当的变分能量，挑战了d波配对是铜氧化物高温超导唯一特征的传统观点。

The $d$-wave pairing symmetry has long been considered a defining feature of
high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates. In this work, we reveal that
$s$-wave pairing states exhibit variational energies comparable to the $d$-wave
state in a square $t$-$J$ model, particularly at high doping levels
($\delta\gtrsim 15\%$) by using the state-of-the-art tensor network simulation.
This surprising result suggests that $s$-wave pairing may play an important
role in the cuprate phase diagram, especially for the overdoped region. Our
findings provide a potential resolution to discrepancies in recent Josephson
tunneling experiments on twisted bilayer cuprates and offer new insights into
the evolution of pairing symmetry with doping.

In solid state materials, gradients of the electro-chemical potential, the
temperature, or the spin-chemical potential drive the flow of charge, heat, and
spin angular momentum, resulting in a net transport of energy. Beyond the
primary transport processes - such as the flow of charge, heat, and spin
angular momentum driven by gradients in their respective potentials - a wide
range of coupled or cross-linked transport responses can occur, giving rise to
a rich variety of transport phenomena. These transport phenomena are commonly
categorized under (anomalous) thermoelectric, thermomagnetic, and
galvanomagnetic effects, along with their spin-dependent counterparts. However,
establishing a systematic classification and comparison among them remains a
complex and nontrivial task. This paper attempts a didactic overview of the
different transport phenomena, by categorizing and briefly discussing each of
them based on charge, heat, and spin transport in conducting solids. The
phenomena are structured in three categories: collinear, transverse, and
so-called `planar' transport effects. The resulting overview attempts to
categorize all effects in a consistent manner.

The quantum spin Hall effect (QSHE), a hallmark of topological insulators,
enables dissipationless, spin-polarized edge transport and has been predicted
in various two-dimensional materials. However, challenges such as limited
scalability, low-temperature operation, and the lack of robust electronic
transport have hindered practical implementations. Here, we demonstrate the
QSHE in an InAs/GaInSb/InAs trilayer quantum well structure operating at
elevated temperatures. This platform meets key criteria for device integration,
including scalability, reproducibility, and tunability via electric field. When
the Fermi level is positioned within the energy gap, we observe quantized
resistance values independent of device length and in both local and nonlocal
measurement configurations, confirming the QSHE. Helical edge transport remains
stable up to T = 60 K, with further potential for higher-temperature operation.
Our findings establish the InAs/GaInSb system as a promising candidate for
integration into next-generation devices harnessing topological
functionalities, advancing the development of topological electronics.

Accurate absolute binding free energy (ABFE) calculations can reduce the time
and cost of identifying drug candidates from a diverse pool of molecules that
may have been overlooked experimentally. These calculations typically employ
explicit solvents; however these models can be computationally demanding and
challenging to implement due to the difficulties in sampling waters and
managing changes in net charge. To address these challenges, we introduce an
automated parallel Python workflow that adopts the double decoupling method,
incorporating conformational restraints and pairing it with the implicit
generalized Born (GB) solvation model. This approach enhances convergence,
reduces computational costs and avoids the technical issues associated with
explicit solvents. We applied this workflow to a series of 93 host-guest
complexes from the TapRoom database. When pooling all systems, the GB(OBC)
model correlated well with experiment ($R^2 = 0.86$); however, this global
metric obscured much weaker correlations observed within individual hosts ($R^2
= 0.3-0.8$). Systematic errors associated with charged functional groups
(notably ammonium and carboxylates) were also evident, resulting in
root-mean-squared errors (RMSEs) greater than 6.12 kcal/mol across all models.
Although the GB models did not achieve reliable accuracy across all systems,
they may be practical when all ligands contain the same functional groups.
Furthermore, a linear correction based on these functional groups reduced RMSE
values to within 1 kcal/mol of experiment, and our error analysis suggests
specific changes for future GB models to improve accuracy. Overall, the Python
workflow demonstrates promise for fast, reliable absolute binding free energy
calculations by leveraging the sampling efficiency of GB in a fully automated
application.

We use stellar dynamics as a testbed for statistical closure theory. We focus
on the process of "Vector Resonant Relaxation," a long-range, non-linear, and
correlated relaxation mechanism that drives the reorientation of stellar
orbital planes around a supermassive black hole. This process provides a
natural setting to evaluate the predictive power of generic statistical closure
schemes for dynamical correlation functions, in the fully non-linear and
non-perturbative regime. We develop a numerical scheme that explicitly
implements the seminal "Martin-Siggia-Rose" formalism at one-loop order via an
iterative fixed-point approach, thereby improving upon the bare order from the
"Direct Interaction Approximation." Using this framework, we quantitatively
validate the ability of the formalism to predict (i) the two-point two-time
correlation function; (ii) the renormalised three-point interaction vertex;
(iii) the three-point three-time correlation function. These predictions are
compared to direct measurements from numerical simulations. We conclude by
discussing the limitations of this approach and presenting possible future
venues.

- **TL;DR**: 本文证明在一维量子晶格模型中，规范化和对偶变换在常数深度量子电路下是等价的，通过矩阵乘积算子揭示了全局对称性的晶格表示理论和对偶变换的分类。

Gauging and duality transformations, two of the most useful tools in
many-body physics, are shown to be equivalent up to constant depth quantum
circuits in the case of one-dimensional quantum lattice models. This is
demonstrated by making use of matrix product operators, which provide the
lattice representation theory for global (categorical) symmetries as well as a
classification of duality transformations. Our construction makes the
symmetries of the gauged theory manifest and clarifies how to deal with static
background fields when gauging generalised symmetries.

- **TL;DR**: 开发了一个自动化机器学习管道(AMLP)，用于简化机器学习原子间势(MLIPs)的开发流程，从数据集创建到模型验证，使用大语言模型代理辅助电子结构代码选择和输入准备。

Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have become powerful tools to
extend molecular simulations beyond the limits of quantum methods, offering
near-quantum accuracy at much lower computational cost. Yet, developing
reliable MLIPs remains difficult because it requires generating high-quality
datasets, preprocessing atomic structures, and carefully training and
validating models. In this work, we introduce an Automated Machine Learning
Pipeline (AMLP) that unifies the entire workflow from dataset creation to model
validation. AMLP employs large-language-model agents to assist with
electronic-structure code selection, input preparation, and output conversion,
while its analysis suite (AMLP-Analysis), based on ASE supports a range of
molecular simulations. The pipeline is built on the MACE architecture and
validated on acridine polymorphs, where, with a straightforward fine-tuning of
a foundation model, mean absolute errors of ~1.7 meV/atom in energies and ~7.0
meV/{\AA} in forces are achieved. The fitted MLIP reproduces DFT geometries
with sub-{\AA} accuracy and demonstrates stability during molecular dynamics
simulations in the microcanonical and canonical ensembles.

### Antitoroidal magnets and anomalous Hall effect

In this paper we introduce a theoretical model of a metallic magnetic system
with an antitoroidal order. We introduce a mechanism of indirect interaction of
conducting fermions with localized spins based on the tunneling processes of
conducting fermions through the localized spins. We demonstrate that
interaction of conducting fermions with an antitoroidal order results in odd in
momentum spin-momentum locking. The interaction resembles Rashba spin-orbit
coupling but breaks the time-reversal symmetry. As a result, we show that a
ferromagnet with the antitoroidal order is an insulator with anomalous Hall
effect occurring without any spin-orbit coupling.

### Noise-reduced stochastic resolution of identity to CC2 for large-scale calculations via tensor hypercontraction

- **Categories**: physics.chem-ph
- **TL;DR**: 提出THC-sRI-CC2方法，将张量超压缩与随机分辨率近似结合，将CC2计算复杂度从O(N^5)降至O(N^3)，显著降低随机噪声，提高激发态能量计算和分子动力学模拟的精度。

The stochastic resolution of identity (sRI) approximation significantly
reduces the computational scaling of CC2 from O(N^5) to O(N^3), where N is a
measure of system size. However, the inherent stochastic noise, while
controllable, can introduce substantial errors in energy derivatives, limiting
its reliability for molecular dynamics simulations. To mitigate this
limitation, we introduce a noise-reduced approach, termed THC-sRI-CC2, which
synergistically combines the sRI framework with tensor hypercontraction (THC).
In this formulation, the expensive Coulomb term, which scales as O(N^4), is
decoupled via THC, while the time-determining exchange term with an O(N^5) cost
is addressed through the sRI scheme, collectively yielding an overall O(N^3)
scaling. Benchmarks demonstrate that our THC-sRI-CC2 implementation achieves
greater accuracy and markedly reduced stochastic noise compared to conventional
sRI-CC2 with identical computational samplings. The resulting O(N^3) scaling
substantially extends the applicability of CC2 for excited-state energy
calculations and nonadiabatic dynamics simulations of large molecular systems.
Furthermore, this work establishes a general THC-sRI hybrid strategy for the
development of reduced-scaling electronic structure methods.

### The quantum XY chain with boundary fields: finite-size gap and phase behavior

- **TL;DR**: 研究一维量子XY链在边界磁场作用下的有限尺寸效应，分析了能隙与链长的关系，识别了四种有序相及其边界行为。

We present a detailed study of the finite-size one-dimensional quantum XY
chain in a transverse field in the presence of boundary fields coupled with the
order-parameter spin operator. We consider fields located at the chain
boundaries that have the same strength and that are oppositely aligned. We
derive exact expressions for the gap $\Delta$ as a function of the model
parameters for large values of the chain length $L$. These results allow us to
characterize the nature of the ordered phases of the model. We find a magnetic
(M) phase ($\Delta \sim e^{-aL}$), a magnetic-incommensurate (MI) phase
($\Delta \sim e^{-aL} f_{MI}(L)$), a kink (K) phase ($\Delta \sim L^{-2}$), and
a kink-incommensurate (KI) phase ($\Delta \sim L^{-2} f_{KI}(L)$); $f_{MI}(L)$
and $f_{KI}(L)$ are bounded oscillating functions of $L$. We also analyze the
behavior along the phase boundaries. In particular, we characterize the
universal crossover behavior across the K-KI phase boundary. On this boundary,
the dynamic critical exponent is $z=4$, i.e., $\Delta \sim L^{-4}$ for large
values of $L$.

### Predictor-corrector method based on dynamic mode decomposition for tensor-train nonequilibrium Green's function calculations

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种结合动态模式分解预测器和块时间步进校正的QTT-NEGF求解器，解决了传统方法内存扩展性差和收敛不稳定的问题，在32×32 Hubbard模型上实现了前所未有的长时间尺度模拟。

The nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism is a powerful tool to
study the nonequilibrium dynamics of correlated lattice systems, but its
applicability to realistic system sizes and long timescales is limited by
unfavorable memory scaling. While compressed representations, such as the
recently introduced quantics tensor train (QTT) format, alleviate the memory
bottleneck, the efficiency of QTT-NEGF calculations is hindered by poor
initializations and slow or unstable convergence of globally updated
self-consistent iterations. Here, we introduce a predictor-corrector solver for
QTT-NEGF simulations that combines dynamic mode decomposition (DMD)
extrapolation with the recently proposed causality-preserving
block-time-stepping updates. The DMD predictor supplies accurate initial
guesses that reduce the iteration count of the calculation, while the
block-time-stepping correction ensures stable convergence even for long
propagation intervals. Applying this method to the Hubbard model on a $32\times
32$ lattice within the nonequilibrium $GW$ approximation, we demonstrate stable
propagation up to times of $t_\mathrm{max}=512$ inverse hoppings, surpassing
the capabilities of both matrix-based implementations and previous QTT solvers.
Our contribution is twofold. (i) We integrate tensor dynamic mode decomposition
with the QTT representation, which establishes a general framework that is not
limited to NEGFs. (ii) We demonstrate its practical benefits in NEGF
simulations, where it enables stable and efficient access to unprecedented
timescales at high momentum resolution, thereby advancing controlled studies of
long-time dynamics and nonequilibrium steady states in correlated lattice
systems.

- **TL;DR**: 使用高斯过程回归加速的弹性带方法研究苯酚直接脱氧在铁基双金属表面的反应机理，发现亚表层Co/Ni取代保持良好热力学和动力学性能，而表层取代则使反应不利。

We present an accelerated nudged elastic band (NEB) study of phenol direct
deoxygenation (DDO) on Fe-based bimetallic surfaces using a recently developed
Gaussian process regression (GPR) calculator. Our test calculations demonstrate
that the GPR calculator achieves up to 3x speedup compared to conventional
density functional theory (DFT) calculations while maintaining high accuracy,
with energy barrier errors below 0.015 eV. Using GPR-NEB, we systematically
examine the DDO mechanism on pristine Fe(110) and surfaces modified with Co and
Ni in both top and subsurface layers. Our results show that subsurface Co and
Ni substitutions preserve favorable thermodynamics and kinetics for both C-O
bond cleavage and C-H bond formation, comparable to those on the pristine
Fe(110) surface. In contrast, top-layer substitutions generally increase the
C-O bond cleavage barrier, render the step endothermic, and result in
significantly higher reverse reaction rates, making DDO unfavorable on these
surfaces. This work demonstrates both the effectiveness of GRR-accelerated
transition state searches for complex surface reactions and provides insights
into rational design of bimetallic catalysts for selective deoxygenation.

### Selective bulk-boundary correspondence in higher-order topological insulators with anticommuting mirror and chiral symmetries

We investigate higher-order topological insulators protected by chiral and
mirror symmetries. Using models in the BDI class, which include the
prototypical topological quadrupole insulator, we show that breaking mirror
symmetries that anticommute with the chiral operator leads to edge-selective
bulk-boundary correspondence, with gap closings and bound states appearing only
along a subset of boundaries of the same orientation. We define a new
edge-sensitive topological invariant, distinguishing this mechanism from
previous reports of non-topological edge-selection effects.

Magnetic molecules are a class of compounds that is also investigated in view
of their magnetocaloric properties. The isothermal entropy change and the
adiabatic temperature change are key figures of merit for magnetocaloric
performance. Here, we investigate spin systems of realistic molecular
structures comprising four spins. In view of possible large spin quantum
numbers as for gadolinium we model these spin systems by a combination of
Heisenberg and dipolar spin-spin interactions. It turns out that a tetrahedral
structure with ferromagnetic exchange interactions yields the best figures of
merit.

We report a dynamical phase transition in the information spreading within a
classical 2D deterministic interacting many-body system. Specifically, the
transition is observed in a recently introduced momentum-conserving parity
check cellular automaton (MCPCA) on the square lattice. We characterize the
transition using information-theoretic quantities such as the Hamming distance
and the classical decorrelator. By introducing conserved local charges of the
MCPCA, we show that selecting initial ensembles with specific charge values
allows the system to transition from a localized information phase to a chaotic
regime with ballistic information spreading. Importantly, our findings indicate
that this transition is of second order, highlighting a sharp change in
information spreading behavior. Furthermore, we revisit the multifractal
behavior of the dynamical structure factor and show that, although present
across both phases, it originates from effective local periodicities enforced
by symmetry constraints.

Magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectroscopy in the range of 1.2 - 3.7 eV
was studied for La1-xKxMnO3 (x = 0.05 - 0.18) epitaxial films over a wide
temperature range. The thin films were grown using a two-step procedure:
deposition of LaxMnO3-{\delta} and potassium K+ incorporation into the films
via isopiestic annealing. The temperature behavior of the MCD effect in
different spectral regions was analyzed alongside the temperature dependences
of magnetization, resistivity, and magnetoresistance of the films. It was found
that the MCD signal is sensitive not only to the magnetic but also to the
charge sublattice of the material. Accordingly, a correlation between the
magneto-optical and magnetoresistive responses of the system was identified.
These findings underscore the high information content of MCD spectroscopy for
investigating the magnetic and magnetotransport properties of strongly
correlated magnetic oxides. The ground and excited electronic states in the
La1-xKxMnO3 films were identified, and the obtained data were compared with
magneto-optical data for divalent - doped and lanthanum-deficient manganite
films. Good agreement was observed, indicating the universality of the
electronic structure and the shared mechanisms underlying the observed effects
in such materials. These results broaden the understanding of the band
structure in manganites and provide a solid foundation for its theoretical
description.

### Scalable Foundation Interatomic Potentials via Message-Passing Pruning and Graph Partitioning

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种加速和扩展原子基础模型（AFMs）的通用工作流程，通过剪枝低贡献的消息传递层来减少参数数量，同时保持AFMs的准确性和数据效率，从而实现大规模分子动力学模拟。

Atomistic foundation models (AFMs) have great promise as accurate interatomic
potentials, and have enabled data-efficient molecular dynamics simulations with
near quantum mechanical accuracy. However, AFMs remain markedly slower at
inference and are far more memory-intensive than conventional interatomic
potentials, due to the need to capture a wide range of chemical and structural
motifs in pre-training datasets requiring deep, parameter-rich model
architectures. These deficiencies currently limit the practical use of AFMs in
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations at extended temporal and spatial scales. To
address this problem, we propose a general workflow for accelerating and
scaling AFMs containing message-passing architectures. We find that removing
low-contribution message-passing layers from AFM backbones serves as an
effective pruning method, significantly reducing the parameter count while
preserving the accuracy and data-efficiency of AFMs. Once pruned, these models
become more accessible for large scale simulations via a graph-partitioned,
GPU-distributed strategy, which we implement and demonstrate within the AFM
fine-tuning platform MatterTune. We show that this approach supports
million-atom simulations on both single and multiple GPUs, and enables
task-specific large-scale simulations at nanosecond timescales with AFM-level
accuracy.

In-memory computing (IMC) is an emerging non-von Neumann paradigm that
leverages the intrinsic physics of memory devices to perform computations
directly within the memory array. Among the various candidates, phase-change
memory (PCM) has emerged as a leading non-volatile technology, showing
significant promise for IMC, particularly in deep learning acceleration.
PCM-based IMC is also poised to play a pivotal role in cryogenic applications,
including quantum computing and deep space electronics. In this work, we
present a comprehensive characterization of PCM devices across temperatures
down to 5 K, covering the range most relevant to these domains. We
systematically investigate key physical mechanisms such as phase transitions
and threshold switching that govern device programming at low temperatures. In
addition, we study attributes including electrical transport, structural
relaxation, and read noise, which critically affect readout behavior and, in
turn, the precision achievable in computational tasks.

### Development of an Optimized Parameter Set for Monovalent Ions in the Reference Interaction Site Model of Solvation

Accurate modeling of aqueous monovalent ions is essential for understanding
the function of biomolecules, such as nucleic acid stability and binding of
charged drugs to protein targets. The 1D and 3D reference interaction site
models (1D- and 3D-RISM) of molecular solvation, as implemented in the
AmberTools molecular modeling suite, are well suited for modeling mixtures of
ionic species around biomolecules across a wide range of concentrations.
However, the available ion model parameters were optimized for molecular
dynamics simulations, not for the RISM framework, which includes a closure
approximation. To address this, we optimized the Lennard-Jones 12-6 model for
monovalent ions for 1D-RISM with the partial series expansion of order 3
closure by fitting to experimental values of ion-oxygen distance (IOD),
hydration free energy (HFE), partial molar volume (PMV) and mean activity
coefficient. The new parameter set demonstrated significant improvement in HFE,
IOD, and mean activity coefficients, whereas no overall change was observed for
the PMV. A second optimization step was necessary to account for the
cation-anion interactions that affect the mean activity coefficients. The new
parameters were validated at finite salt concentrations against experimental
data for 16 ion pairs and showed improved accuracy for 14 of them, while the
results for CsI and CsF were the second best. 1D-RISM results obtained with the
new NaCl parameters were used to calculate the preferential interaction
parameter of the ions around the 24L B-DNA using 3D-RISM. The new parameters
demonstrated better agreement with experiment at physiological and higher
concentrations. At lower concentrations, the results primarily depended on the
closure with little effect from the ion parameters. Overall, the ion parameters
specifically developed for RISM show improved accuracy at infinite dilution and
finite concentrations.

### Metric response of relative entropy: a universal indicator of quantum criticality

The information-geometric origin of fidelity susceptibility and its utility
as a universal probe of quantum criticality in many-body settings have been
widely discussed. Here we explore the metric response of quantum relative
entropy (QRE), by tracing out all but $n$ adjacent sites from the ground state
of spin chains of finite length $N$, as a parameter of the corresponding
Hamiltonian is varied. The diagonal component of this metric defines a
susceptibility of the QRE that diverges at quantum critical points (QCPs) in
the thermodynamic limit. We study two spin-$1/2$ models as examples, namely the
integrable transverse field Ising model (TFIM) and a non-integrable Ising chain
with three-spin interactions. We demonstrate distinct scaling behaviors for the
peak of the QRE susceptibility as a function of $N$: namely a square
logarithmic divergence in TFIM and a power-law divergence in the non-integrable
chain. This susceptibility encodes uncertainty of entanglement Hamiltonian
gradients and is also directly connected to other information measures such as
Petz-R\'enyi entropies. We further show that this susceptibility diverges even
at finite $N$ if the subsystem size, $n$, exceeds a certain value when the
Hamiltonian is tuned to its classical limits due to the rank of the RDMs being
finite; unlike the divergence associated with the QCPs which require $N
\rightarrow \infty$.

### Continuum theory for topological phase transitions in exciton systems

An effective continuum theory is constructed for the topological phase
transition of excitons in quasi-two-dimensional systems. These topological
excitons crucially determine the optoelectronic properties, because of their
larger binding energies in 2D as well as their topologically enhanced exciton
transport. The core idea of this letter is, that the essential physics
determining the topological invariants across the phase transition is localized
near $N$-fold band-crossing points (BCPs) in the interaction-induced exciton
band structure. The construction of the continuum theory around these BCPs
needs only the information of exciton states that build up these BCPs at both
$\mathbf{Q}=0$ and finite $\mathbf{Q}$ points, and not the numerically
challenging solution of the Bethe-Salpeter equation over the full exciton
Brillouin zone. This theory applies to systems with and without spin
conservation. Our theory is illustrated in two specific examples: the
transition metal dichalcogenide twisted bilayer systems and the
Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang (BHZ) model. These results offer a promising route toward
studying complex systems, such as the room-temperature quantum spin Hall system
Bismuthene (Bi/SiC) and other twisted bilayer systems.

Topological aspects in altermagnets have come into focus recently, and tuning
the antiferromagnetic (AFM) state into an altermagnetic phase remains an active
frontier. We realize both within a rutile superlattice here in this paper. With
first principles calculation, we show that a uniaxial strain of only 0.5$\%$
along the c axis converts the $(\mathrm{CrO}_2)_1/(\mathrm{TaO}_2)_2$ rutile
superlattice from a trivial antiferromagnet into an altermagnet with topology
accompanied by a weak SOC. The strain opens a spin-dependent band splitting of
$\sim 1.1 eV$ and, despite the weak SOC together with in-plane magnetic moment
orientation, generates an intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity of order $10^3
S/cm$, comparable magnitude to that in ferromagnetic Weyl semimetals. Tiny SOC
here with in-plane \(\text{N\'eel}\) orientation gaps out the Weyl nodal rings,
giving rise to 16 Weyl points in the superlattice. Thus, we point out a simple
route toward strain and field tunable, low-dissipation altermagnetic
electronics.

- **TL;DR**: 提出PRDNet模型，结合倒易空间衍射和图形表示来解决晶体属性预测中长程相互作用捕获不足的问题，在多个数据集上达到最先进性能。

Crystal property prediction, governed by quantum mechanical principles, is
computationally prohibitive to solve exactly for large many-body systems using
traditional density functional theory. While machine learning models have
emerged as efficient approximations for large-scale applications, their
performance is strongly influenced by the choice of atomic representation.
Although modern graph-based approaches have progressively incorporated more
structural information, they often fail to capture long-term atomic
interactions due to finite receptive fields and local encoding schemes. This
limitation leads to distinct crystals being mapped to identical
representations, hindering accurate property prediction. To address this, we
introduce PRDNet that leverages unique reciprocal-space diffraction besides
graph representations. To enhance sensitivity to elemental and environmental
variations, we employ a data-driven pseudo-particle to generate a synthetic
diffraction pattern. PRDNet ensures full invariance to crystallographic
symmetries. Extensive experiments are conducted on Materials Project,
JARVIS-DFT, and MatBench, demonstrating that the proposed model achieves
state-of-the-art performance.

Single-orientation stitching of graphene has emerged as the predominant
method for growth of large-area, high-quality graphene films. Particularly
noteworthy is graphene grown on single-crystalline Cu(111)/sapphire substrates,
which exhibits exceptionally planar oriented stitching due to the atomically
smooth substrate, facilitating the formation of continuous, high-quality
graphene monolayer. These single-orientation stitches have conventionally been
regarded as seamless with negligible defect concentrations. In this report, we
present experimental observations regarding graphene grown on
single-crystalline Cu(111)/sapphire substrates. Among the graphene flakes with
single-orientation, our findings reveal two major merging behaviors: one
producing the expected seamless stitching, and another unexpectedly generating
structural defects that create nanoscale pathways permitting water permeation.
Notably, we identify a unique merging structure--overlapped junction, in which
the edge of one graphene flake overlaps and lies atop the edge of another
flake, rather than forming a continuous atomic stitch. This discovery
challenges the conventional anticipation of single-orientation stitched
graphene films as seamless single crystalline film, while offers unique
perspective for graphene applications in molecular sieving, selective
filtration membranes, and protective coatings.

Multi-principal element alloys (MPEAs), also known as high-entropy alloys,
have garnered significant interest across many applications due to their
exceptional properties. Equilibrium vacancy concentrations in MPEAs influence
diffusion and microstructural stability in these alloys. However, computing
vacancy concentrations from ab-initio methods is computationally challenging
due to the vast compositional space of MPEAs and the complexity of the local
environment around each vacancy. In this work, we present an efficient approach
to connect electronic structure calculations to equilibrium vacancy
concentrations in MPEAs through embedded cluster expansions (eCE) and rigorous
statistical mechanics methods. Using first-principles calculations and Monte
Carlo simulations informed by eCE, we assess the variation in vacancy formation
with alloy composition and temperature. Our method is demonstrated on a
nine-component MPEA comprised of elements in groups 4, 5, and 6 of the periodic
table. Correlations between alloy chemistry, short-range order, and equilibrium
vacancy concentrations in alloys containing up to 9 different elements are
analyzed. The vacancy concentration of refractory alloys increases with the
addition of group 4 elements or elements whose mixing is energetically
unfavorable. The insights into vacancy behavior and the efficient computational
framework presented in this study serve as a guide for the design of complex
concentrated alloys with controlled vacancy concentrations.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文研究了WSe2/CrI3范德华异质结构中的激子行为，揭示了磁性Frenkel激子、受邻近效应影响的Wannier-Mott激子以及新型层间激子的存在。

van der Waals heterostructures consisting of transition metal dichalcogenides
(TMDs) and two-dimensional (2D) magnets offer a versatile platform to study the
coexistence and transformation of different excitons. By focusing on TMD
WSe$_2$ and 2D magnetic CrI$_3$, as a bilayer WSe$_2$/CrI$_3$ and a trilayer
CrI$_3$/WSe$_2$/CrI$_3$, we provide their description using a parameter-free,
high-fidelity many-body perturbation theory. This ab initio approach allows us
to elucidate the character of magnetic Frenkel excitons in CrI3 and how the
nonmagnetic Wannier-Mott excitons in WSe2 are modified by the proximity of
CrI3. We reveal novel proximity-induced interlayer excitons in these
heterostructures. In contrast to the sensitivity of proximity-induced
modifications of excitons in WSe$_2$, which depend on the interfacial details,
the interlayer magnetic excitons are remarkably robust and are present across
the different stacking configurations between WSe$_2$ and CrI$_3$, simplifying
their experimental demonstration. These findings suggest unexplored
opportunities for information transduction using magnetic excitons and
integrating photonics, electronics, and spintronics in proximitized materials.

### Electric-field effect on spin diffusion length in solids: An \textit{ab initio} study beyond the drift-diffusion model

- **TL;DR**: 本文扩展了自旋扩散长度的第一性原理计算方法，加入电场漂移项，研究了电场对多种材料自旋扩散长度的影响，发现漂移-扩散模型在某些材料中存在较大误差。

Recently, we developed an \textit{ab initio} approach of spin diffusion
length (l_{s}) in solids [Phys. Rev. Lett. 135, 046705 (2025)], based on a
linearized density-matrix master equation with quantum treatment of electron
scattering processes. In this work, we extend the method to include the drift
term due to an electric field along a periodic direction, implemented
efficiently using a Wannier-representation-based covariant derivative. We
employ this approach to investigate the electric-field effect on l_{s} of
monolayer WSe_{2}, bulk GaAs, bulk GaN, and graphene-h-BN heterostructure. Our
results show that l_{s} can be significantly enhanced or suppressed by a
moderate downstream or upstream field respectively. Although the widely-used
drift-diffusion model performs well for WSe_{2} and GaAs, it can introduce
large errors of the electric-field-induced changes of l_{s} in both GaN and
graphene-h-BN. Thus, to accurately capture the influence of electric fields on
l_{s} in realistic materials, it is necessary to go beyond the drift-diffusion
model and adopt a microscopic \textit{ab initio} methodology. Moreover, in
graphene-h-BN, we find that the field-induced change of l_{s} is not only
governed by the drift term in the master equation, but is also significantly
affected by the electric-field modification of the equilibrium density matrix
away from Fermi-Dirac distribution function.

Thermoelectric cooling based on the Peltier effect requires high-performance
materials near room temperature. In this work, Bi2Te2.6Se0.4 synthesized by
melting-hot pressing followed by 100 h annealing (MT-HP-AN) at 723 K exhibits
markedly improved performance. Annealing introduces cation vacancies via Te(Se)
volatilization, lowering carrier density and enhancing mobility, while
simultaneously increasing phonon scattering. A peak ZT of 1.06 at 373 K and an
average ZT of 0.99 at 300-423 K are achieved. This MT-HP-AN approach offers a
simple yet effective strategy to decouple carrier and phonon transport,
advancing the potential of n-type BTS for thermo-electric cooling applications.

Materials used in commercial D-T fusion reactors will be exposed to
irradiation and a mixture of helium and hydrogen plasma. Modeling the
microstructural evolution of such materials requires the use of large-scale
molecular dynamics simulations. The focus of this study is to develop a fast
EAM potential for the interactions among the three elements (W, H, and He),
fitted to accurately reproduce both the ab initio formation energies and
relaxation volumes of small defect clusters containing light gases within
tungsten. The potential enables the study of tungsten under irradiation and in
the presence of light gases. To demonstrate the utility of the potential, we
construct a thermodynamically motivated model for predicting the energetics of
light-gas-filled voids. The model is then validated through molecular dynamics
simulations with our new potential.

### Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Collision Cascades in Niobium: Comparing Interatomic Potentials

Radiation damage in structural materials is a major challenge for advanced
nuclear energy systems, and niobium is of particular interest due to its high
melting point, mechanical strength, and corrosion resistance. To better
understand its radiation response, we carried out large-scale molecular
dynamics simulations of collision cascades in pure niobium at 300 K over a
primary knock-on atom (PKA) energy range of 1-75 keV, employing four
interatomic potentials: an embedded atom method (EAM), two Finnis-Sinclair
models (FS-1 and FS-2), and a machine learning-based spectral neighbor analysis
potential (SNAP) we developed. All reproduce the general features of cascade
formation but differ significantly in defect production, clustering, and
morphology. At low energies, defect generation follows trends governed by
threshold displacement energy (TDE) and the stiffness-to-range ratio (|S/R|).
At higher energies, subcascade formation makes defect evolution dependent on
the combined effects of |S/R|, average TDE, and other material-specific
factors. Vacancy clustering dominates over interstitial clustering across all
cases: EAM produces the largest vacancy clusters and the highest clustering
fraction, while SNAP shows the strongest interstitial clustering. Morphological
analysis indicates that EAM forms a balanced mix of 1/2&lt;111&gt;, 1/2&lt;110&gt; loops,
C15 rings, and hybrid structures; FS-2 favors extended 1/2&lt;111&gt; dumbbells,
crowdions, and dislocation loops; whereas FS-1 and SNAP generate more compact
or disordered clusters, with SNAP produces a high fraction of C15-like rings
(maximum size up to nine atoms) that may evolve into dislocation loops of
1/2&lt;111&gt; and &lt;100&gt;. These findings give clear insights into how niobium reacts
when exposed to irradiation, especially at high energies.

### Antiferromagnetic domain walls under spin-orbit torque

Domain walls in antiferromagnets under a spin-polarized current present rich
dynamics that is not observed in ferromagnets, and it is tunable by the current
polarization. Precessional dynamics is obtained for perpendicular spin
polarization, in agreement with expectations in older works. Propagating walls
are obtained for an in-plane polarization. We obtain the velocity as a function
of current by a perturbation method for low velocities, and the wall profile is
found to lack a definite parity. For high velocities, the main features of the
wall profile are obtained by a direct solution of an equation that is valid in
a limiting case. We discuss the magnetization of the dynamical walls and find
that this can become large, providing a potential method for observations.
Oscillatory motion of domain walls is obtained for spin polarization that has
both perpendicular and in-plane components, and an analytical description is
given.

Charged boron vacancies (V$_\text{B}^-$) in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN)
have emerged as a promising platform for quantum nanoscale sensing and imaging.
While these primarily involve electron spins, nuclear spins provide an
additional resource for quantum operations. This work presents a comprehensive
experimental and theoretical study of the properties and coherent control of
the nearest-neighbor $^{15}$N nuclear spins of V$_\text{B}^-$-ensembles in
isotope-enriched h$^{10}$B$^{15}$N. Multi-nuclear spin states are selectively
addressed, enabled by state-specific nuclear spin transitions arising from
spin-state mixing. We perform Rabi driving between selected state pairs, define
elementary quantum gates, and measure longer than 10~$\mu$s nuclear Rabi
coherence times. We observe a two orders of magnitude nuclear g-factor
enhancement that underpins fast nuclear spin gates. Accompanying numerical
simulations provide a deep insight into the underlying mechanisms. These
results establish the foundations for leveraging nuclear spins in
V$_\text{B}^-$ center-based quantum applications, particularly for extending
coherence times and enhancing the sensitivity of 2D quantum sensing foils.

The growth of high-quality magnetic topological insulator crystals by the
Bridgman method remains challenging due to thermodynamic limitations inherent
to this technique. Nevertheless, this approach continues to provide bulk
materials with significantly reduced free carrier concentrations compared to
epitaxial methods. Here, we investigate the Inverted Vertical Bridgman growth
of MnBi2Te4/(Bi2Te3)n crystals, with particular emphasis on the structural
ordering of MnBi2Te4 septuple layers within the Bi2Te3 quintuple-layer matrix
and its influence on magnetic properties. Through a detailed analysis of growth
dynamics, we identify four distinct stages, including a turbulent flow regime
promoting pure MnBi2Te4 phase, rapid MnTe precipitation reducing Mn content in
the melt, a stationary growth phase supporting ordered stacking of septuple and
quintuple layers, and a final stage marked by flow cessation and defect
formation. We demonstrate that septuple layer spacing is inversely correlated
with MnTe supersaturation due to the diffusion-limited incorporation in
stationary growth phase. Magnetic characterization reveals antiferromagnetic
ordering in pure MnBi2Te4 phase and in MnBi2Te4/(Bi2Te3)n heterostructure, with
ferromagnetism emerging for wider septuple layer spacing. We determine critical
temperatures for observed antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic phase transitions
and magnetic anisotropy constants for ferromagnetic samples. Our findings
highlight key growth parameters governing magnetic and structural quality,
offering a pathway to scalable synthesis of layered topological insulators with
tunable magnetic properties.

Aligning theoretical atomistic structural models of materials with available
experimental data presents a significant challenge for disordered systems. The
configurational space to navigate is vast, and faithful realizations require
large system sizes with quantum-mechanical accuracy in order to capture the
distribution of structural motifs present in experiment. Traditional
equilibrium sampling approaches offer no guarantee of generating structures
that coincide with experimental data for such systems. An efficient means to
search for such structures is molecular augmented dynamics (MAD)
[arXiv:2508.17132], a modified molecular dynamics method that can generate
ab-initio accurate, low-energy structures through a multi-objective
optimization of the interatomic potential energy and the experimental
potential. The computational scaling of this method depends on both the scaling
of the interatomic potential and that of the experimental potential. We present
the general equations for MAD with linear-scaling formulations for calculating
and matching X-ray/neutron diffraction and local observables, e.g., the
core-electron binding energies used in X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. MAD
simulations can both find metastable structures compatible with non-equilibrium
experimental synthesis and lower energy structures than alternative
computational sampling protocols, like the melt-quench approach. In addition,
generalizing the virial tensor with the experimental forces enables generalized
barostatting, allowing one to find structures whose density matches that
compatible with the experimental observables. Scaling tests with the TurboGAP
code demonstrate their linear-scaling nature for both CPU and GPU
implementations, the latter of which has a 100$\times$ speedup compared to the
CPU.

Strong coupling (SC) is a fundamental concept in physics that describes
extreme interactions between light and matter. Recent experiments have
demonstrated SC at the nanometer scale, where strongly confined polaritons,
rather than photons, couple to quantum emitters or molecular vibrations.
Coupling with the latter is generally referred to as vibrational SC (VSC) and
is of significant fundamental and technological interest, as it can be an
effective tool for modifying molecular properties. However, the implementation
of VSC, especially at the nanoscale, depends on the development of tuning
mechanisms that allow control over the coupling strength and, eventually, its
directionality, opening the door for the selective coupling of specific
molecular vibrations. Here we report the observation of directional VSC.
Specifically, we show nanoscale images of propagating hyperbolic phonon
polaritons (PhPs) coupled to pentacene molecules revealing that the fingerprint
of VSC for propagating polaritons -- a marked anti-crossing in their dispersion
at the vibrational resonance -- can be modulated as a function of the direction
of propagation. In addition, we show that VSC can exhibit an optimal condition
for thin molecular layers, characterized by a maximum coupling strength along
one single direction. This phenomenon is understood by analysing the overlap of
the polariton field with molecular layers of varying thicknesses. Apart from
their fundamental importance, our findings promise novel applications for
directional sensing or local directional control of chemical properties at the
nanoscale.
