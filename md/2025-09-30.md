- **TL;DR**: 研究了钕铁硼酸盐在6-32K温度范围内的光学吸收光谱，发现σ-和π-偏振光的吸收线积分强度随温度变化呈现不同行为，可能与螺旋磁结构的形成有关。

We study experimentally and theoretically optical absorption spectra of
neodymium ferroborate in the temperature range $6-32$ K. We show that the
temperature dependences of integral intensities of absorption lines demonstrate
qualitatively different behavior for $\sigma$- and $\pi$-polarizations of the
light. We suggest that this behavior may be caused by the appearance of a
spiral magnetic structure in the compound under study. To describe the
temperature dependences of lines intensities we propose a theoretical model
which takes into account the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction between
Nd$^{3+}$ and Fe$^{3+}$ ions.

- **TL;DR**: 本文报道了一种用于JEOL（扫描）透射电子显微镜的新型侧入式cryoZero低温冷却系统，该系统使用压缩液氦，可在超低温下进行成像和光谱分析，性能稳定，基温达6.58K。

Advances in cryogenic electron microscopy have opened new avenues for probing
quantum phenomena in correlated materials. This study reports the installation
and performance of a new side-entry condenZero cryogenic cooling system for
JEOL (Scanning) Transmission Electron Microscopes (S/TEM), utilizing compressed
liquid helium (LHe) and designed for imaging and spectroscopy at ultra-low
temperatures. The system includes an external dewar mounted on a
vibration-damping stage and a pressurized, low-noise helium transfer line with
a remotely controllable needle valve, ensuring stable and efficient LHe flow
with minimal thermal and mechanical noise. Performance evaluation demonstrates
a stable base temperature of 6.58 K measured using a Cernox bare chip sensor on
the holder with temperature fluctuations within 0.04 K. Complementary in-situ
electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) via aluminum bulk plasmon analysis was
used to measure the local specimen temperature and validate cryogenic operation
during experiments. The integration of cryogenic cooling with other microscopy
techniques, including electron diffraction and Lorentz TEM, was demonstrated by
resolving charge density wave (CDW) transitions in NbSe2 using electron
diffraction, and imaging nanometric magnetic skyrmions in MnSi via Lorentz TEM.
This platform provides reliable cryogenic operation below 7 K, establishing a
low-drift route for direct visualization of electronic and magnetic phase
transformations in quantum materials.

### Monte Carlo Diagonalization for Hubbard Model

- **TL;DR**: 提出蒙特卡洛对角化方法，通过蒙特卡罗方法构造截断的Fock空间来减少哈密顿量表示所需的基矢数量，从而突破传统精确对角化约20个位点的限制，可处理多达32个位点的团簇。

The Hubbard model has often been studied with exact diagonalization (ED).
This impurity solver is fundamentally limited by the exponential scaling of the
Fock space. To address this problem, we introduce Monte Carlo diagonalization.
Using a truncated Fock space constructed with a Monte Carlo approach, we reduce
the size of the basis required to represent the Hamiltonian. We can then apply
the Lanczos and band Lanczos algorithms in this truncated basis to find the
ground state and the Green function. This results in a significant economy of
resources and the capacity to break the $\sim$20-site limit of ED. Our results
suggest that there is a threshold on the number of states needed to capture the
physics. This allows us to reach clusters of size up to 32 sites and reproduce
the expected physics.

### Hund's physics extends to actinide f electron systems

- **TL;DR**: 铀氮化物(UN)是强关联的坏金属，其主要关联源于5f电子间的Hund交换相互作用，而非传统的Kondo机制。

Uranium 5f electrons often yield heavy-fermion behavior via Kondo screening.
However, the pronounced bad-metallic transport of uranium mononitride (UN)
defies an incoherent Kondo explanation. Using density-functional theory
combined with dynamical mean-field theory, we show that UN is a strongly
correlated bad metal. The dominant correlations arise from intra-atomic Hund's
exchange interaction between two 5f electrons, which aligns local magnetic
moments and produces large quasiparticle mass renormalization. This identifies
UN as a 5f-electron analogue of a Hund's metal-a paradigm chiefly associated
with transition-metal d systems. Our results motivate a re-examination of the
interplay between Mott, Kondo, and Hund-driven correlations across actinide
correlated materials.

### Stability and Superconductivity of Ternary Polyhydrides

- **TL;DR**: 对2020-2025年氢富化合物超导临界温度增强实验的回顾表明，三元合金化未能提高Tc，但能降低稳定高压相所需压力。

We review five years of experimental and theoretical attempts (2020-2025) to
enhance the superconducting critical temperature ($\textit{T$_c$}$) of
hydrogen-rich compounds by alloying binary superhydrides with additional
elements. Despite predictions of higher $\textit{T$_c$}$ in ternary systems
such as La-Y-H, La-Ce-H, and Ca-Mg-H, experiments consistently show that the
maximum $\textit{T$_c$}$ in disordered ternary superhydrides does not exceed
that of the best binary parent hydrides within experimental uncertainty.
Instead, alloying primarily stabilizes high-symmetry polyhydride phases at
lower pressures, enabling $\textit{T$_c$}$ = 200 K near 110-120 GPa, while also
improving vortex pinning and upper critical fields. Magnetic dopants suppress
$\textit{T$_c$}$, whereas nonmagnetic additives leave it nearly unchanged,
reminiscent of Anderson's theorem. These findings indicate that alloying is
unlikely to raise $\textit{T$_c$}$, but can reduce the pressures required to
stabilize high-$\textit{T$_c$}$ phases. We propose that fully ordered ternary
hydrides, synthesized via controlled hydrogenation of intermetallic precursors,
offer a promising route toward this goal.

### Robust quantum Hall resistance standard from uniform wafer-scale epitaxial graphene on SiC

We report high-precision resistance measurements on quantum Hall resistance
devices fabricated from uniform epitaxial graphene grown by propane-hydrogen
chemical vapor deposition on a two-inch silicon carbide substrate. Through
molecular doping, we achieve a low carrier density regime ($n_\mathrm s &lt; $ 1.5
\textperiodcentered 10$^{11}$ cm$^{-2}$) combined with high mobility ($\upmu
\geq$ 6000 cm$^2$ V$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$) at low temperature. Accurate quantization
of the Hall resistance is demonstrated at magnetic flux densities as low as 3.5
T, temperatures up to 8 K, and measurement currents up to 325 $\upmu$A, with
relative measurement uncertainties of a few parts per billion. A stability
diagram mapping dissipation as a function of temperature and current provides
insight into optimal doping conditions that maximize the breakdown current. All
measurements were carried out in a pulse-tube-based cryomagnetic system,
enabling simplified and continuous operation of the quantum Hall resistance
standard without liquid helium consumption.

### A Comparison of Surrogate Constitutive Models for Viscoplastic Creep Simulation of HT-9 Steel

- **TL;DR**: 开发了两种局部代理模型（分段响应面法和专家混合模型）来替代复杂的多晶体力学本构模型，用于预测HT-9钢的粘塑性响应，以平衡计算精度和效率。

Mechanistic microstructure-informed constitutive models for the mechanical
response of polycrystals are a cornerstone of computational materials science.
However, as these models become increasingly more complex - often involving
coupled differential equations describing the effect of specific deformation
modes - their associated computational costs can become prohibitive,
particularly in optimization or uncertainty quantification tasks that require
numerous model evaluations. To address this challenge, surrogate constitutive
models that balance accuracy and computational efficiency are highly desirable.
Data-driven surrogate models, that learn the constitutive relation directly
from data, have emerged as a promising solution. In this work, we develop two
local surrogate models for the viscoplastic response of a steel: a piecewise
response surface method and a mixture of experts model. These surrogates are
designed to adapt to complex material behavior, which may vary with material
parameters or operating conditions. The surrogate constitutive models are
applied to creep simulations of HT-9 steel, an alloy of considerable interest
to the nuclear energy sector due to its high tolerance to radiation damage,
using training data generated from viscoplastic self-consistent (VPSC)
simulations. We define a set of test metrics to numerically assess the accuracy
of our surrogate models for predicting viscoplastic material behavior, and show
that the mixture of experts model outperforms the piecewise response surface
method in terms of accuracy.

### Transporting Baguettes With Minimal Action: The Geometry of Optimal Nonequilibrium Processes in Stochastic Thermodynamics

- **TL;DR**: 该论文研究热力学系统在非平衡环境中执行状态变化的最优过程，发现优化问题中存在与最优输运理论相关的几何结构，并提出三种方法来计算和解释最优协议。

What are the fundamental limitations placed by the laws of thermodynamics on
the energy expenditure needed to carry out a given task in a nonequilibrium
environment in finite time? In this thesis, we investigate "optimal
nonequilibrium processes": how nonequilibrium state changes in a thermodynamic
system may be performed most efficiently, in the sense of requiring the least
amount of thermodynamic work. Surprisingly, there is a hidden, fundamental
geometric structure in this optimization problem that is related to the
mathematics of optimal transport theory: how to optimally send, e.g., baguettes
from bakeries to caf\'es, given supply and demand constraints, that requires
the least amount of total distance traveled by the baguettes. After giving a
brief overview on the mathematical framework of stochastic thermodynamics for
the overdamped Langevin equation, we present a trio of works: (1) applying
optimal control theory to the Fokker-Planck equation to calculate exact optimal
protocols for low-dimensional systems, which reproduces the intriguing
previously-discovered discontinuities in globally optimal protocols and reveals
new non-monotonic optimal protocols for a certain system; (2) exploiting the
importance sampling of Langevin trajectories under different protocols, to
adaptively optimize protocols by controlling the thermodynamic state
trajectory, which is useful for efficiently calculating free energy differences
between different Hamiltonians; and finally, (3) deriving an exact geometric
description of optimal nonequilibrium processes and a geodesic-counterdiabatic
decomposition for the optimal protocols that enact them, which satisfyingly
explains the highly non-intuitive properties of discontinuities and possible
non-monotonicity in globally optimal protocols.

### Enduring mechanical memory from the constitutive response of elastically recoverable nanostructured materials

- **TL;DR**: 本文报道了在弹性可恢复的垂直排列碳纳米管泡沫中发现的构成性回点记忆效应，类似于硬盘中基于磁滞的回点记忆。这种非易失性记忆源于速率无关的纳米尺度摩擦，可实现动态模量的独立可调性。

Mechanical memory and computing are gaining significant traction as means to
augment traditional electronics for robust and energy efficient performance in
extreme environments. However, progress has largely focused on bistable
metamaterials, while traditional constitutive memory effects have been largely
overlooked, primarily due to the absence of compelling experimental
demonstrations in elastically recoverable materials. Here, we report
constitutive return point memory (RPM) in elastically recoverable, vertically
aligned carbon nanotube (VACNT) foams, analogous to magnetic hysteresis-based
RPM utilized in hard drives. Unlike viscoelastic fading memory, VACNTs exhibit
non-volatile memory arising from rate-independent nanoscale friction. We find
that the interplay between RPM and frictional dissipation enables independent
tunability of the VACNT dynamic modulus, allowing for both on-demand softening
and stiffening. We leverage this property to experimentally demonstrate tunable
wave speed in a VACNT array with rigid interlayers, paving the way for novel
shock limiters, elastodynamic lensing, and wave-based analog mechanical
computing.

### WTMAD-4: A Fair Weighting Scheme for GMTKN55

- **TL;DR**: 本文发现GMTKN55数据集常用的WTMAD指标存在缺陷，提出了新的WTMAD-4指标来公平评估密度泛函方法性能，并评估了135种色散校正DFA方法。

The GMTKN55 data set is a collection of standard benchmarks used in molecular
quantum chemistry that spans small- and large-molecule thermochemistry,
reaction barriers, and non-covalent interactions. Herein, we identify a flaw in
the weighted mean absolute deviation (WTMAD) definitions commonly used to
quantify performance of various electronic-structure methods for the GMTKN55
set, which under-weight some of its component benchmarks by orders of
magnitude. A new WTMAD-4 metric is proposed, based on typical errors observed
for well-behaved density-functional approximations (DFAs), ensuring fair
treatment across all benchmarks. The performance of 135 dispersion-corrected
DFAs is assessed by combining literature data with new results for 20 minimally
empirical methods, primarily involving the exchange-hole dipole moment and
many-body dispersion corrections, available in the FHI-aims code. Lastly, we
highlight a literature example where a DFA parametrised by minimising WTMAD-2
underperforms for benchmarks marginalised by that metric.

### Splitting of electronic spectrum in paramagnetic phase of itinerant ferromagnets and altermagnets

We study self-energy effects, induced by strong magnetic fluctuations in
paramagnetic phase of strongly-correlated itinerant magnets within the density
functional theory combined with the dynamical mean field theory (DFT+DMFT
approach) and its non-local extension. As concrete examples, we consider
$\alpha$-iron, half metal CrO$_2$, van der Waals material CrTe$_2$, and
altermagnet CrSb. We show that both local and non-local magnetic correlations
yield splitting of the electronic spectrum in the paramagnetic phase, such that
it closely resembles the DFT band structure in the ordered phase and suppresses
spectral weight at the Fermi level. The relative importance of non-local vs.
local correlations depends on the proximity to half filling of $d$ states:
closer to half filling, the role of local correlations increases. Although the
obtained split bands do not possess a certain spin projection, their splitting
suppresses spectral weight at the Fermi level. The obtained electronic states
are also expected to be easily spin polarized by a weak external magnetic
field.

### Superconductivity at 22.3 K in Compressed Sodium-intercalated Graphite

- **TL;DR**: 该论文报道了在钠插层石墨中实现了22.3K的超导转变温度，这是石墨插层化合物中目前最高的Tc值，通过简单的室温研磨和压缩方法制备。

Graphite intercalation compounds (GICs) have long been recognized as
promising candidates for high-temperature superconductivity by intercalation or
charge doping, yet experimental progress has stalled with transition
temperatures (Tc) limited to 11.5 K at ambient pressure and 15.1 K at 7.5 GPa
in calcium-intercalated graphite over decades. Here, we report robust
superconductivity in sodium-intercalated graphite with Tc of 22.3 K, as
demonstrated by clear zero-resistance behavior. Our approach involves simply
room-temperature grinding of graphite with sodium, followed by slight
compression up to 7.1 GPa, circumventing complex synthesis procedures. Through
synchrotron X-ray diffraction combined with first-principles calculations, we
identify the major superconducting phase as an orthorhombic stage-2 GIC
structure with slightly over-stoichiometric composition (Na1+xC8).
Electron-phonon coupling calculations reveal that superconductivity primarily
emerges from the interactions between out-of-plane carbon electrons and
low-frequency Na/C vibrations.The enhancement in Tc establishes sodium as
superior for achieving higher-Tc in GICs and illustrates promising pathway for
further optimization through compositional and structural tuning.

### Tunneling spectroscopy of two-dimensional superconductors with the quantum twisting microscope

- **TL;DR**: 开发了一种理论方法，利用量子扭转显微镜（QTM）通过动量守恒隧穿测量石墨烯基超导体的超导能隙和Bogoliubov准粒子谱。

The ongoing discoveries of graphene-based superconductors underscore the
quest to understand the structure of new superconducting orders. We develop a
theory that facilitates the use of the quantum twisting microscope (QTM) for
that purpose. This work investigates momentum-conserving tunneling across a
planar junction formed by a normal monolayer graphene tip and a superconducting
graphene sample within the QTM setting. We show that the bias dependence of the
zero-temperature tunneling conductance exhibits singularities that provide
momentum-resolved information about the Bogoliubov quasiparticle spectra,
including the superconducting gap. Using a model of superconducting twisted
bilayer graphene (TBG), we illustrate that simultaneously tuning the tip doping
level and the tip-sample twist angle allows for measuring the momentum-resolved
superconducting gap in TBG. Our results indicate that momentum-conserving
tunneling spectroscopy with the QTM is a promising method for exploring
superconductivity in two-dimensional van der Waals materials.

### Interplay of Variance Reduction and Population Control in Monte Carlo Neutron Transport

Monte Carlo methods are widely used for neutron transport simulations at
least partly because of the accuracy they bring to the modeling of these
problems. However, the computational burden associated with the slow
convergence rate of Monte Carlo poses a significant challenge to running
large-scale simulations. The continued improvement in high-performance
computing capabilities has put exascale time-dependent Monte Carlo neutron
transport simulations within reach. Variance reduction techniques have become
an essential component to the efficiency of steady-state simulations, and
population control techniques are an integral part of time-dependent
simulations, but combining them can create algorithmic conflicts. This study
investigates the performance of steady-state variance reduction techniques when
extended to time-dependent problems and examines how variance reduction and
population control techniques combine to impact the effectiveness of
time-dependent simulations. Simulations were conducted using various
combinations of these techniques across multiple test problems to assess their
performance. While this study does not examine all possible variance reduction
and population control combinations, the findings emphasize the importance of
carefully selecting algorithms to simulate large-scale time-dependent problems
effectively. Notably, using weight windows with weight-based combing for
population control can significantly hinder simulation performance, whereas
pairing weight windows with uniform combing can provide the efficiencies
necessary for successfully computing the results of massive problems. Further
performance gains were observed when steady-state weight windows were replaced
with time-dependent versions.

### Symmetric Lévy flights in semi-infinite domain

We study symmetric L\'evy flights in a semi-infinite domain $[0,\infty)$ with
a reflecting and absorbing boundary at 0. To this end, we use the fractional
differential equation that governs the L\'evy process. Incorporating the
boundary conditions in L\'evy flights has been an open and tricky question, as
the long jumps can lead to the L\'evy flights leaping over the boundary. We,
for the first time, incorporate reflecting and absorbing boundary conditions
for L\'evy flights and solve the fractional differential equation analytically
to find the probability densities. Monte Carlo simulations are also performed
for both boundary conditions to verify the results. Analytical and simulation
results perfectly coincide for the reflecting boundary condition and, for the
absorbing boundary condition, they coincide for the large abscissa values.

The competition between intrinsic spin-orbit physics, magnetic phenomena, and
the quality of materials and interfaces governs the charge-to-spin conversion
processes that are essential to the implementation of spintronic devices.
Direct comparisons of spin parameters, which serve as metrics of device
quality, obtained by different measurement techniques are scarce, leading to
uncertainty regarding discrepancies and the reliability of the methods. Here,
we directly compare the spin Hall coefficient (${\theta}_{SH}$) in molecular
beam epitaxy grown films of $(Bi_{1-x}Sb_{x})_{2}Te_{3-y}Se_{y}$ (BSTS, x =
0.58, y = 1) at room temperature using two complementary techniques: a static
method using non-local voltage (NLV) measurements in BSTS Hall bars with DC
charge current, and a dynamic method using spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance
(ST-FMR) measurement in $BSTS/Ni_{80}Fe_{20}$ heterostructures at GHz
frequencies. We obtain comparable spin Hall coefficients in angular-dependent
ST-FMR (${\theta}_{SH}$=$4.7\pm1.1$) and in NLV (${\theta}_{SH}$=$2.8\pm0.6$).
The complex effects of ferromagnetic interfaces while determining spin Hall
coefficients using static or dynamic techniques becomes evident by contrasting
our results to literature.

### Neural Canonical Transformation for the Spectra of Fluxional Molecule CH5+

- **TL;DR**: 使用神经正则变换(NCT)方法计算了质子化甲烷CH5+的振动激发态，发现其波函数偏好势能面上的三个驻点，所有态都表现出连续的氢原子交换动力学特征

Protonated methane, CH5+, is a highly fluxional molecule with large spatial
motions of the hydrogen atoms. The molecule's anharmonic effects and the
scrambling of the hydrogen atoms significantly affect the excitation spectrum
of the molecule. The neural canonical transformation (NCT) approach, which we
previously developed to solve the vibrational spectra of molecules and solids,
is a powerful method that effectively treats nuclear quantum effects and
anharmonicities. Using NCT with wavefunctions in atomic coordinates rather than
normal coordinates, we successfully calculate the ground and excited states of
CH5+. We found that the wavefunctions for the ground state, as well as for low-
and high-energy excited states, show preferences for the three stationary
points on the potential energy surface. Furthermore, the dynamics of all these
states are characterized by continuous hydrogen swapping. This work extends the
applicability of the NCT approach for calculating excited states to fluxional
molecules without fixed geometry.

- **TL;DR**: CuNdO₂是一种三角晶格磁体，Nd³⁺离子具有强伊辛特性。在0.78K发生反铁磁有序，但由于三角晶格的极端阻挫，仅观察到微弱的120°结构有序，几乎检测不到偶极有序矩。

We investigate the magnetic ground state of CuNdO$_2$, which is a delafossite
with a triangular lattice of magnetic Nd$^{3+}$ ions that are well separated by
non-magnetic Cu spacer layers. From inelastic neutron scattering measurements
of the crystal electric field, we determine the strong Ising character of the
pseudo-spin $\frac{1}{2}$ Nd$^{3+}$ moments. Magnetic susceptibility and heat
capacity measurements reveal the onset of long-range antiferromagnetic order at
$T_N=0.78$ K. While the magnetic transition is definitively observed with muon
spin relaxation, accompanied by the formation of a weakly dispersing spin wave
excitation, no dipole-ordered moment is detected with neutron diffraction. We
show that the apparent absence of a dipolar ordered moment is a consequence of
the dominant Ising character of the Nd$^{3+}$ moments, which experience extreme
frustration on the triangular lattice. Consequently, the frustration in
CuNdO$_2$ is relieved through in-plane ordering of the substantially smaller
perpendicular component of the Nd$^{3+}$ moments into a 120\textdegree\
structure, with a nearly vanishing ordered moment.

We report on results of simulations and experiments of vortex states in
superconducting micro-wires with periodic rectangular pinhole structures. The
simulations have been performed by means of numerically solving the
time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) equations. With increasing bias current
and for different values of the external magnetic field applied normal to the
structure plane, we observe at first a vortex free Meissner state, followed by
a resistive vortex-flow mixed state and a state with a more complex vortex
pattern. The resulting dependence of the critical current Ic on magnetic field
exhibits two plateaus with distinctly different vortex dynamics. Corresponding
experimentally measured magnetic-field dependences of Ic of WSi microwires with
periodic pinhole structures and varying hole spacing confirmed the predictions
of these simulations, showing two ranges of magnetic field with almost
field-independent critical currents. The experimentally determined critical
currents are larger for a smaller pinhole spacing, in agreement with the
results of the TDGL simulations. The good agreement of the simulations with the
experimental results provides a convenient strategy for the optimization of
single-photon detectors with or without artificial and natural defects.

We investigate magnetoresistivity and the Hall effect in a 6.3 nm gapless
HgTe quantum well - a two-dimensional hybrid band system featuring coexisting
linear (Dirac-like) and parabolic hole energy bands at low energies. Using a
classical two-subband model that incorporates intervalley scattering, we reveal
a striking tenfold enhancement of the Hall resistance, primarily driven by the
dominant transport contribution of Dirac holes. A comprehensive
magnetotransport analysis enables us to extract key parameters, such as the
mobilities of both carrier types, thereby providing insight into their complex
interplay. These results establish the HgTe quantum well as a distinctive
platform for exploring novel transport phenomena in hybrid band systems and
deepen our understanding of mixed-carrier magnetotransport.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种高度可扩展的对称保持随机批量Ewald（SRBE）算法，用于解决电化学系统中电极电荷波动的计算瓶颈问题。

Constant potential molecular dynamics simulation plays important role for
applications of electrochemical systems, yet the calculation of charge
fluctuation on electrodes remains a computational bottleneck. We propose a
highly scalable, symmetry-preserving random batch Ewald (SRBE) algorithm to
address this challenge. The SRBE algorithm deterministically computes the
low-frequency components along the direction perpendicular to electrodes, while
efficiently approximating the remaining components using random batch sampling.
This approach simultaneously reduces charge and force fluctuations while
satisfying the symmetry-preserving mean field condition in anisotropic systems
with large aspect ratios. Numerical experiments on electrode/ionic liquid
systems validate the high accuracy of the SRBE method in capturing dynamic
charging processes and equilibrium electric double layer structures. The SRBE
method achieves parallel efficiency improvements of up to two orders of
magnitude compared with conventional FFT-based algorithms. These findings
highlight its strong potential for enabling large-scale electrochemical
simulations and its broad applicability to practical problems in the field.

- **TL;DR**: 本文提出了一种基于统计物理涨落定理的热力学框架来预测金融危机，通过定义市场温度（正负收益率概率比）来识别市场状态和预测危机。

This paper introduces a novel approach to financial crisis prediction by
establishing a thermodynamic-like framework derived from the fluctuation
theorem of statistical physics. We define market temperature through the
probability ratio of positive to negative returns and demonstrate its
effectiveness in identifying market states and predicting potential crises. Our
empirical analysis spans nine major global indices from 2005 to 2025, revealing
statistically significant differences in temperature dynamics between crisis
and non-crisis periods. Most notably, we discover a counterintuitive
relationship between market temperature stability and crisis occurrence: crises
tend to emerge more frequently during periods of apparent temperature stability
rather than instability. This finding suggests that unusually stable periods in
market temperature might signal the accumulation of systemic risks, similar to
the calm before a storm in physical systems.

Metal hydrides can be tuned to have a diverse range of properties and find
applications in hydrogen storage and superconductivity. Finding methods to
control the synthesis of hydrides can open up new pathways to unlock novel
hydride compounds with desired properties. We introduced the idea of utilizing
electrochemistry as an additional tuning knob and in this work, we study the
synthesis of binary metal hydrides using high pressure, electrochemistry and
combined pressure-electrochemistry. Using density functional theory
calculations, we predict the phase diagrams of selected transition metal
hydrides under combined pressure and electrochemical conditions and demonstrate
that the approach agrees well with experimental observations for most phases.
We use the phase diagrams to determine trends in the stability of binary metal
hydrides of scandium, yttrium and lanthanum as well as discuss the
hydrogen-metal charge transfer at different pressures. Furthermore, we predict
a diverse range of vanadium and chromium hydrides that could potentially be
synthesized using pressure electrochemistry. These predictions highlight the
value of exploring pressure-electrochemistry as a pathway to novel hydride
synthesis.

### Excitonic Energy Transfer in Red Algal Photosystem I Reveals an Evolutionary Bridge between Cyanobacteria and Plants

- **TL;DR**: 通过超低温二维电子光谱研究红藻Cyanidioschyzon merolae的光系统I，揭示了其能量转移机制：在核心和天线间分布多个能量汇，扩展了光谱覆盖范围并确保高效捕获。

Photosystem I converts light into chemical energy with near-unity quantum
efficiency,yet its energy-transfer and charge-separation mechanisms remain
debated. Evolution has diversified PSI architectures. The unicellular red algae
Cyanidioschyzon merolae represents a key evolutionary intermediate,featuring a
cyanobacterial-like monomeric core surrounded by three to five LHCR subunits.
This hybrid organization provides a unique system to bridge mechanistic models
across lineages. We applied two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy at ultralow
temperatures to disentangle overlapping excitation pathways in C. merolae PSI.
Cryogenic measurements suppressed thermal broadening, resolving five dynamical
components: sub-picosecond equilibration acrossthe core-LHCR interface,
subsequent population transfer into progressively lowerenergy manifolds, and
slower feeding into red pools distributed across both core and antenna. On the
longest timescales, a persistent ground-state bleach signifies excitons
stabilised in terminal sinks. Notably, comparison of 8 K and 80 K spectra
reveals that excitations are heterogeneously partitioned among multiple sinks
at low disorder, whereas modest thermal activation promotes selective
convergence into core-associated red chlorophylls. To interpret these dynamics,
we employed atomistic excitonic Hamiltonians with time-nonlocal master
equations, providing a quantitative framework for exciton migration and thermal
redistribution. Together, these results demonstrate that C. merolae PSI
broadens the kinetic funnel by distributing sinks across core and antenna, an
evolutionary adaptation that extends spectral coverage whilst ensuring
efficient trapping. These insights reconcile cyanobacterial and plant paradigms
and illuminate how antenna expansion reshaped PSI function during the course of
photosynthetic evolution.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文研究了一个三轨道Hubbard模型，发现在轨道选择性Mott相中出现了渐近尺度不变的单粒子谱和ω/T标度行为。

Quantum materials whose properties lie beyond the celebrated Landau
Fermi-liquid paradigm have been observed for decades across diverse material
platforms. Finding microscopic lattice models for metallic states that exhibit
such peculiar behavior remains a major theoretical challenge, as these features
often originate from strong quantum fluctuations in strongly interacting
electron systems. Here we investigate a three-orbital Hubbard model at a
high-symmetry point that hosts a transition from a metallic to an
orbital-selective Mott (OSM) phase. Employing single-site dynamical mean-field
theory combined with full-density-matrix numerical renormalization group, we
chart the $T-U$ phase diagram and obtain high-resolution real-frequency
dynamics. In the OSM regime we find asymptotically scale-invariant (power-law)
single-particle spectra and asymptotic $\omega/T$ scaling in both charge and
spin channels, spanning several decades in frequency and temperature.

In this study, we demonstrate the successful fabrication of TiO2/FeSe/STO and
TiO2/FeSe/LaAlO3 heterostructures using PLD. When the growth rates were
sufficiently low, anatase TiO2, which has been reported to induce
superconductivity in FeSe, could be grown epitaxially on FeSe. For
TiO2/FeSe/STO, the FeSe/TiO2 interface was relatively clean, as confirmed by
the observation of Laue fringes in FeSe(001) reflection. Although a thinner
FeSe layer is expected to enhance Tc, our results instead suggest that
deposition of TiO2 introduces additional disorder in FeSe. Most strikingly,
superconductivity appeared when TiO2 was deposited on FeSe/LaAlO3, clearly
demonstrating that the interaction between the top oxide layer and underlying
FeSe can induce superconductivity. This work demonstrates the feasibility of
fabricating FeSe/oxide superlattices by PLD, establishing a novel platform for
the exploration of interfacial superconductivity in iron-based superconductors.

We theoretically investigate the electron tunneling in dual-gated bilayer
graphene-based $n/p$ junctions. It is shown that a band gap is introduced by
tuning the gate voltage, which modifies the pseudospin polarization and breaks
anti-Klein tunneling at normal incidence. Specifically, when the pseudospin
polarization vectors for the propagating and evanescent wave modes on the left
and right regions of the junction are orthogonal, a revival of Klein tunneling
is achieved. The Berry phase associated with Klein tunneling in dual-gated
bilayer graphene is not limited to $\pi$ but varies with the junction
parameters. Furthermore, the Klein tunneling is accompanied by a $\pi$ jump in
the reflection phase around the normal incidence.

release that broadens both the physical scope and the software infrastructure

structure that supports multi-species transport, advanced trapping and reaction
schemes, isotope exchange, decay, and advection. Interface and boundary
conditions have been generalised, and interoperability with external solvers
enables multiphysics workflows, including coupling with fluid dynamics and
neutron transport codes. On the software side, FESTIM v2.0 has been migrated to

interoperability, and long-term sustainability. Taken together, these advances
position FESTIM v2.0 as a versatile platform for investigating hydrogen
transport in materials across scientific and engineering applications.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了张量网络马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛方法，用于高效采样三维自旋玻璃系统，显著改善了自相关时间，在单个CPU上实现了传统方法需要超级计算机才能完成的模拟。

Sampling the three-dimensional (3D) spin glass -- i.e., generating
equilibrium configurations of a 3D lattice with quenched random couplings -- is
widely regarded as one of the central and long-standing open problems in
statistical physics. The rugged energy landscape, pronounced critical slowing
down, and intrinsic ergodicity breaking render standard Monte Carlo methods
severely inefficient, particularly for large systems at low temperatures. In
this work, we introduce the Tensor Network Markov Chain Monte Carlo (TNMCMC)
approach to address the issue. It generates large-scale collective updates in
MCMC using tensor networks on the 2D slices of the 3D lattice, greatly
improving the autocorrelation time and offering orders-of-magnitude speed-ups
over conventional MCMC in generating unbiased samples of the Boltzmann
distribution. We conduct numerical experiments on 3D spin glasses up to system
size $64\times 64\times 64$ using a single CPU, and show that TNMCMC
dramatically suppresses critical slowing down in large disordered systems,
which usually require a supercomputer to perform MCMC simulations. Furthermore,
we apply our approach to the 3-state Potts model up to system size $64\times
64\times 64$ using a single CPU, and show that the TNMCMC approach efficiently
traverses the exponential barriers of the strong first-order transition,
whereas conventional MCMC fails. Our results reveal that TNMCMC opens a
promising path toward tackling long-standing, formidable three-dimensional
problems in statistical physics.

Disorder in high entropy alloys, arising from the random distribution of
multiple elements, plays a crucial role in their novel properties desirable for
various advanced engineering applications. We investigate the role of
compositional and structural disorder on the electronic structure of
osmium-based superconducting high entropy alloys,
(Ru/Re)$_{0.35}$Os$_{0.35}$Mo$_{0.10}$W$_{0.10}$Zr$_{0.10}$, using
photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT). Elemental and
cumulative core level shifts are found to be commensurate with elemental
electronegativities and valence electron counts (VEC), respectively. Valence
band spectra together with DFT results indicate that the crystal structure
plays an important role in deciding the electronic structure of these high
entropy alloys. Through temperature dependent high-resolution spectra, we
unveil strongly suppressed spectral density of states (SDOS) in the close
vicinity of Fermi level. Energy and temperature dependence of the SDOS in
accordance with Altshuler-Aronov theory confirms localization of charge
carriers in the presence of strong intrinsic disorder. Computed electron-phonon
coupling strength and superconducting transition temperature aligning
reasonably well with experiments further shed light on phonon-mediated pairing
mechanism and role of disorder in these systems. Our results provide a way
forward to the understanding of superconducting high entropy alloys through
strategic control of disorder, VEC and crystal structure.

The investigation of high-pressure chemical reaction dynamics has long been
constrained by the absence of effective in-situ characterization methods. Here
we performed the state-of-the-art synchrotron radiation in-situ X-ray imaging
based on large-volume press (LVP) technology to uncover the crucial information
on the dynamics of the underlying phenomena of the formation of iron-based
spherical product in the high-pressure solid-state metathesis reaction (HSM).
We successfully give access to the entire reduction-nitridation process of
ferric oxide under the reaction conditions. By analyzing the variation of image
intensity (Im) with temperature, two critical stages have been revealed, the
formation of nitrogen-containing molten borate Fe[BO]+N[BO] melt and the phase
separation of iron nitrides from molten borate. The experimental observation
provides direct evidence for the existence of nitrogen-containing molten borate
under high pressure, and the formation of molten borate plays a crucial role as
a transport medium for nonmetallic ion exchange with metal elements. The
M[BO]+N[BO] melt (M=other metals) represents a general pathway for the
synthesis of metal nitrides under high pressure. The combination of LVP
high-pressure experimental technology with X-ray radioscopy has resulted in a
leap in the understanding of reaction dynamics and has opened new paths in the
fields of high-pressure chemistry.

Twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ near two-degree twists has emerged as a platform for
exotic correlated topological phases, including ferromagnetism and a
non-Abelian fractional spin Hall insulator. Here we reveal the unexpected
emergence of an intervalley superconducting phase that intervenes between these
two states in the half-filled second moir\'{e} bands. Using a continuum model
and exact diagonalization, we identify superconductivity through multiple
signatures: negative binding energy, a dominant pair-density eigenvalue, finite
superfluid stiffness, and pairing symmetry consistent with a
time-reversal-symmetric nodal extended $s$-wave state. Remarkably, our
numerical calculation suggests a continuous transition between
superconductivity and the non-Abelian fractional spin Hall insulator, in which
topology and symmetry evolve simultaneously, supported by an effective
field-theory description. Our results establish higher moir\'{e} bands as
fertile ground for intertwined superconductivity and topological order, and
point to experimentally accessible routes for realizing superconductivity in
twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$.

Novel theoretical developments have allowed to connect microscopic disorder
in bosonic collective excitations to the signatures in two-dimensional
terahertz spectroscopy (G\'{o}mez Salvador et al. 2025). Here, we employ this
framework to analyze the recently measured Josepshon echoes in optimally doped
La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ (Liu et al. 2024). We consider the spatial gap
inhomogeneities -- observed in scanning tunneling microscopy -- as input for
the disorder in the superfluid density, and compute the resulting echo peaks.
The excellent agreement supports the interpretation that the gap inhomogeneity
arises solely from pairing gap fluctuations, with no evidence for
non-superconducting competing local orders. Finally, we study the microscopic
origin of the inelastic processes, contributing to the damping of the Josephson
plasmon at low temperatures, and conclude that it can be attributed to nodal
quasiparticles.

### Non-Hermitian topological superconductivity with symmetry-enriched spectral and eigenstate features

We investigate a one-dimensional superconducting lattice that realizes all
internal symmetries permitted in non-Hermitian systems, characterized by
nonreciprocal hopping, onsite dissipation, and $s$-wave singlet pairing in a
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-type structure. The combined presence of
pseudo-Hermiticity and sublattice symmetry imposes constraints on the energy
spectra. We identify parameter regimes featuring real spectra, purely imaginary
spectra, complex flat bands, and Majorana zero modes, the latter emerging when
a uniform transverse magnetic field suppresses the non-Hermitian skin effect.
We show that a uniform onsite dissipation is essential for stabilizing the zero
modes, whereas a purely staggered dissipation destroys the topological
superconductivity. Through Hermitianization, we construct a spectral winding
number as a topological invariant and demonstrate its correspondence with the
gap closing conditions and appearance of the Majorana zero modes, allowing us
to establish topological phase diagrams. Moreover, we reveal nontrivial
correlations between the particle-hole and spin components of left and right
eigenstates, enforced by chiral symmetry, pseudo-Hermiticity, and their
combination. Our results highlight how non-Hermiticity, sublattice structure,
and superconductivity together enrich symmetry properties and give rise to
novel topological phenomena.

a pair of asymmetric exclusion processes (TASEPs) antiparallelly coupled to two
particle reservoirs without any spatial extent by using the model in Haldar et
al, Phys. Rev. E {\bf 111}, 014154 (2025). We show that the model admits {\em
delocalized} domain walls which exist for some choices of the model parameters
that define the effective entry and exit rates into the TASEP lanes.
Surprisingly, in the parameter space spanned by these model parameters, the
delocalized domain walls covers an {\em extended} region. The corresponding
phase diagrams in the plane of the control parameters have different topology
from those for an open TASEP or other models with multiple TASEPs connected to
two reservoirs.

- **TL;DR**: 通过第一性原理计算研究CrI₂双层结构的电子和磁性质，发现堆叠方式可调控磁各向异性和磁电耦合，为自旋电子器件提供新机遇。

We use a first-principles calculations approach to reveal the electronic and
magnetic properties of chromium diiodide (CrI$_2$) bilayers and establish a
hierarchy of magnetic interactions across stable registries. The monolayer
presents a x-stripe antiferromagnetic ground state, while in bilayers the
BA$^\prime$ stacking is the global minimum with antiparallel interlayer
magnetic alignment. Bilayer configurations strengthen the exchange in the plane
by 6 % to 10 %, while the exchange between layers is registry-dependent. The
symmetry of each stacking configuration allows for anisotropic interactions.
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya terms appear in structures without inversion symmetry,
which in this case also generates in-plane polarizations of up to $\sim$ 10
$\mu$C/cm$^2$, resulting in direct magnetoelectric coupling that is absent in
centrosymmetric monolayers. Thus, stacking acts both as a selector of exchange
anisotropy and as a driver of magnetoelectricity. Our results show that bilayer
CrI$_2$ can be mechanically reconfigured through interlayer sliding, with
energy differences between stacking orders (25-50 meV/f.u.) that are compatible
with experimental actuation. Tunable magnetism and register-dependent
polarization offer promising opportunities for novel spintronic devices, where
structural transitions can affect both magnetic states and electric dipoles.

We develop a numerical approach based on the sinc basis set for
first-principles electronic structure calculations in one-dimensional systems.
The method exploits the inherent accuracy and non-local character of the sinc
functions to handle long-range couplings effectively. As a proof of principle,
we provide a computational study of a molecule in an optical cavity, with our
code directly calculating the emergence of the energy level splitting in the
spectrum.

### Bose glass in Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ nanofilms

Weak localization of bosons can give rise to an exotic quantum phase known as
a Bose glass, characterized by the absence of global phase coherence yet finite
conductivity. This phase is crucial in understanding the interplay between
disorder, interactions, and superconductivity, especially in two-dimensional
and strongly correlated systems. Here we report the presence of the Bose glass
phase in the weak localization region of ruthenium oxide Ca$_2$RuO$_4$. The
electrical resistance exhibits a characteristic logarithmic temperature
dependence in this phase, $\rho \sim \ln(1/T)$. Through $\beta$-function
scaling analysis, we observed "vertical flow" indicating unconventional scaling
behavior associated with localized bosonic states. Our results suggest the
existence of bosons-Cooper pairs-persisting up to high temperatures around 220
K and that these bosons undergo weak localization. In the Bose glass phase,
vortices are found to have a dual relationship with the localized Cooper pairs,
enabling their motion and resulting in finite resistance despite the presence
of bosonic order. We identified two quantum critical points: one between the
Bose glass and superconducting phases and another between the Bose glass and
Mott insulating phases, allowing us to extract the corresponding quantum sheet
resistances. We revealed that the ground state of the Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ changes
depending on the localization strength. Thinning the Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ corresponds
to controlling the electronic correlation by relieving the distortion in
RuO$_6$ octahedra. These findings offer significant insights into the interplay
between electronic correlations and bosonic transport, with important
implications for studying high-temperature superconductors based on perovskite
structures.

### Strong enhancement of d-wave superconductivity in an extended checkerboard Hubbard ladder

By employing the density-matrix renormalization group method, we study an
extended checkerboard Hubbard model on the two-leg ladder, which includes an
intraplaquette nearest-neighbour attraction V. The simulated results show that
V plays a significant role in enhancing the d-wave superconductivity when the
electron density is close to half-filling. In the homogeneous case t'=t (t and
t' are the intraplaquette and interplaquette hopping integrals), large critical
|Vc| is required to induce the superconducting ground state. With decreasing
t', |Vc| is substantially diminished and the pair state has a nearly C4
symmetry. In the extremely inhomogeneous case t'&lt;0.2t, the system transits to
the d-wave superconducting phase at V\sim-0.3t and V\sim-0.4t for U=8t and
U=12t, respectively, accompanying with a shift of spin and single-particle
excitations from gapless to gapped type.

### Tunable quantum metric and band topology in bilayer Dirac model

Quantum metric, a fundamental component of quantum geometry, has attracted
broad interest in recent years due to its critical role in various quantum
phenomena. Meanwhile, band topology, which serves as an important framework in
condensed matter physics, has led to the discovery of various topological
phases. In this work, we introduce a bilayer Dirac model that allows precise
tuning of both properties. Our approach combines two Dirac Hamiltonians with
distinct energy scales; one producing relatively dispersive bands and the other
yielding relatively flat bands. The dispersive and flat bands are weakly
coupled via hybridization $\lambda$. By inducing a band inversion in the layer
subspace, we achieve flexible tuning of band topology across all
Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classes and quantum metric scaling as $g \propto
1/\lambda^2$ near band inversion point. Using the bilayer Su-Schrieffer-Heeger
model, we investigate the localization properties of gapless boundary states,
which are affected by quantum metric. Our work lays a foundation for exploring
the interplay between band topology and quantum metric.

### One-dimensional lattice random walks in a Gaussian random potential

We study random walks evolving in continuous time on a one-dimensional
lattice where each site $x$ hosts a quenched random potential $U_x$. The
potentials on different sites are independent, identically distributed Gaussian
random variables. We analyze three distinct models that specify how the
transition rates depend on $U_x$: the random-force-like model, random walks
with randomized stepping times, and the Gaussian trap model. Our analysis
focuses on five key disorder-dependent quantities defined for a finite chain
with $N$ sites: the probability current, its reciprocal (the resistance), the
splitting probability, the mean first-passage time $T_N$, and the diffusion
coefficient $D_N$ in a periodic chain. By determining the moments of these
random variables, we demonstrate that the probability current, resistance, and
splitting probability are not self-averaging, which leads to pronounced
differences between their average and typical behaviors. In contrast, $T_N$ and
$D_N$ become self-averaging when $N \to \infty$, though they exhibit strong
sample-to-sample fluctuations for finite $N$.

The targeted and efficient CO2 reduction remains an appealing option to
capture CO2 from the atmosphere and transform it into value-added chemicals.
The formation of methylene and subsequent dimerization to ethylene is one
possible step in the rather complex pathway. These reactions typically occur on
(catalytic) surfaces. It is therefore critical to gain a deeper understanding
of the role of the surface. We study the reaction pathway of the dimerization
on gold surfaces with varying layer thickness. The presence of support layers
has a significant influence on the reaction coordinate, the energetic profile
and finally on the adsorption energy of the product on the surface with
interesting consequences for the role of nanostructured gold surfaces for CO2
upconversion.

### n-alkanoate + n-alkane mixtures: folding of hydrocarbon chains of n-alkanoates

- **TL;DR**: 该研究通过实验数据和模型分析酯类与正烷烃混合物的热力学性质，发现某些酯类在烷烃介质中可能形成准环状结构，这通过内能和粘度变化得到证实。

The mixtures CH$_3$(CH$_2$)$_{u-1}$COO(CH$_2$)$_{v-1}$CH$_3$ ($u=5-13$,
$v=1,2$; $u=1,2,3$, $v=3,4$; $u=1,2,4$, $v=5$) + n-alkane have been
investigated using experimental data (viscosity and excess molar functions:
enthalpy, $H_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$, volume, $V_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$,
isobaric heat capacity, and isochoric internal energy,
$U_{V\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$) and models (Flory, Grunberg-Nissan,
Bloomfield-Dewan). They are characterized by weak orientational effects. Large
structural effects are found in some systems, like those containing pentane.
Some considerations from standard enthalpies of vaporization, cohesive energy
densities and $V_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$ of heptane mixtures reveal the
existence of structural changes in longer n-alkanoates, which lead to stronger
interactions between them. The observed decrease of $H_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$
for systems with a given n-alkane seems to be more related to the steric
hindrance of the COO group than to interactional effects. The
$U_{V\text{m}}^{\text{E}}(n)$ function ($n=$ number of C atoms in the n-alkane)
shows a minimum for systems with esters with ($u\geq4$, $v=1$); ($u\geq7$,
$v=2$), or ($u\geq 1$, $v=4,5$). A similar dependence was found for n-alkane
mixtures involving cyclic molecules (cyclohexane, benzene). This result
suggests that certain n-alkanoates, in an alkane medium, can form quasi-cyclic
structures. Viscosities are well described by means of free volume effects
only. For systems with butyl ethanoate or methyl decanoate, the variation of
$\Delta \eta (n)$ (deviation of dynamic viscosity) is consistent with that of
$U_{V\text{m}}^{\text{E}}(n)$, which supports the existence of cyclic
structures in these esters. The Flory model provides poor results on
$H_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$ for systems with large structural effects. Results
improve when the model is applied to $U_{V\text{m}}^{\text{E}}(n)$ data.

The Hubbard model is known to accommodate various electronic orders,
including stripes, which are important for understanding the physics of
cuprates. We study spin-stripe order in the square lattice Hubbard model as a
function of doping and temperature, by solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation with
the local vertex from dynamical mean field theory (DMFT), both inside and
outside the antiferromagnetic phase. We find broad regions of
horizontal/vertical spin stripes at low temperatures for the model with and
without next-nearest neighbor hopping. Their wavelength depends on hole doping
in a nonlinear fashion, and is highly sensitive to the ratio of nearest and
next-nearest neighbor hoppings.

### Spontaneous $π$ flux trapping in granular rings of unconventional superconductors

We study Josephson couplings in unconventional superconductors from a
symmetry-based perspective, extending the Sigrist-Rice formula to broader
classes of pairing symmetries and in the presence of junction interface
disorder effects. Applying this formalism to granular superconducting rings, we
show that single-band chiral superconductors cannot spontaneously trap magnetic
flux, which rules out chiral $p$-wave pairing as a candidate for
$\beta$-Bi$_2$Pd superconductor, given the observation of half quantum flux in
recent Little-Parks experiments. Taking into account the full crystalline
symmetry and time-reversal symmetry of the superconducting state of
$\beta$-Bi$_2$Pd, we propose that the effective pairing is a triplet helical
equal-spin state, enforced by spin-orbit couplings arising from local inversion
symmetry breaking. We further demonstrate that granular rings of such helical
superconductors can support spontaneous flux trapping, even in the presence of
strong junction interface orientation disorder. Our proposal reconciles
apparent inconsistencies among different experimental observations and
highlights the crucial role of local inversion symmetry breaking in
understanding the pairing symmetry in $\beta$-Bi$_2$Pd.

The spin of the electron has been a key enabler to realize spintronics
devices that harness the spin degree of freedom beyond conventional
charge-based electronics. In addition to spin, electrons have another degree of
freedom associated with the angular momentum: orbital angular momentum. While
spintronics has evolved fast and spintronics concepts are now used in magnetic
sensors and nonvolatile memories, exploiting orbital angular momentum has just
started to be studied. Phenomena mediated by orbital angular momentum have led
to a new branch of spintronics called orbitronics. This Perspective discusses
how orbitronics can constitute the next step in the evolution of spintronics by
reviewing the current understandings and experimental results of orbital
effects and summarizing the open questions. Prospects and challenges for
devices in particular in non-volatile memory are discussed as an applications
perspective.

- **TL;DR**: 研究发现RuO₂/Fe双层结构中的交换偏置效应并非源于RuO₂的交替磁性，而是由界面形成的Fe₃O₄氧化层驱动，这对将交换偏置作为交替磁性的证据提出了质疑。

Initially identified as a promising altermagnetic (AM) candidate, rutile
RuO$_2$ has since become embroiled in controversy due to contradictory findings
of modeling and measurements of the magnetic properties of bulk crystals and
thin films. For example, despite observations of a bulk non-magnetic state
using density functional theory, neutron scattering, and muon spin resonance
measurements, patterned RuO$_2$ Hall bars and film heterostructures display
magnetotransport signatures of magnetic ordering. Among the characteristics
routinely cited as evidence for AM is the observation of exchange bias (EB) in
an intimately contacted Fe-based ferromagnetic (FM) layer, which can arise due
to interfacial coupling with a compensated antiferromagnet. Within this work,
the origins of this EB coupling in Ru-capped RuO$_2$/Fe bilayers are
investigated using polarized neutron diffraction, polarized neutron
reflectometry, cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy, and super
conducting quantum interference device measurements. These experiments reveal
that the EB behavior is driven by the formation of an iron oxide interlayer
containing Fe$_3$O$_4$ that undergoes a magnetic transition and pins
interfacial moments within Fe at low temperature. These findings are confirmed
by comparable measurements of Ni-based heterostructures, which do not display
EB coupling, as well as magnetometry of additional Fe/Ru bilayers that display
oxide-driven EB coupling despite the absence of the epitaxial RuO$_2$ layer.
While these results do not directly refute the possibility of AM ordering in
RuO$_2$ thin films, they reveal that EB, and related magnetotransport
phenomena, cannot alone be considered evidence of this characteristic in the
rutile structure due to interfacial chemical disorder.

The organic conductor $\alpha$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$I$_3$ provides the prime example
of a charge-order-driven metal-insulator transition. Restricted chemical
substitution of S atoms by Se in the constituent molecules allows us to modify
the electronic properties. This not only decreases the transition temperature
but, in addition, alters the phase transition mechanism, resulting in the
ground state deviating from the charge-ordered insulator state of the parent
compound. Employing infrared optical spectroscopy, we investigate changes in
the charge dynamics. Furthermore, we demonstrate the absence of charge ordering
in the Se-substituted materials and suggest that the phase transition is
instead driven by the localization of the itinerant charge carriers due to
strong electron-phonon interactions.

The superconducting diode is an emergent device that juggles between the
Cooper-paired state and the resistive state with unpaired quasiparticles. Here,
we report a quantum version of the superconducting diode, which operates solely
between Cooper-paired states. This type of quantum superconducting diode takes
advantage of quantized Shapiro steps for digitized outputs. The devices consist
of twisted high-temperature cuprate superconductors, and exhibit the following
distinguished characteristics: (1) a non-reciprocal diode behavior can be
simply initiated by current training without applying an external magnetic
field; (2) perfect diode efficiency is achieved under microwave irradiations at
a record-high working temperature; (3) the quantized nature of the output
offers high resilience against input noises. These features open up
unprecedented opportunities toward developing practical dissipationless quantum
circuits.

We report magnetoelectric coupling in nanoparticle assemblies that persists
to temperatures over 300 times lower than in previous studies. The ME response
saturates at low temperature, revealing a quantum plateau of the coupling. A
field dependence analysis shows a crossover from quadratic to linear behavior,
captured by a phenomenological expansion $C(B,T) \simeq C_0(T) + a_1(T) B +
a_2(T) B^2$. The magnitude of the extracted quadratic coefficient, $|a_2(T)|$,
follows a power law $|a_2(T)| \sim T^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha \approx 1.15$,
indicating proximity to a quantum critical regime. The observed saturation
reflects a new intrinsic energy scale, distinct from finite-size or extrinsic
effects. These results establish nanoparticle assemblies as a new platform for
studying quantum magnetoelectric phenomena.

### Nonequilibrium statistics of barrier crossings with competing pathways

- **TL;DR**: 该论文研究双势阱系统中两条竞争路径的随机跃迁行为，发现最可能路径取决于可用时间：短时间时选择高势垒短距离路径，长时间时选择低势垒长距离路径，且温度变化会导致路径切换。

Many biological, chemical, and physical systems are underpinned by stochastic
transitions between equilibrium states in a potential energy. Here, we consider
such transitions in a minimal model with two possible competing pathways, both
starting from a local potential energy minimum and eventually finding the
global minimum. There is competition between the distance to travel in state
space and the height of the potential energy barriers to be surmounted, for the
transition to occur. One pathway has a higher energy barrier to go over, but
requires traversing a shorter distance, whereas the other pathway has a lower
potential barrier but it is substantially further away in configuration space.
The most likely pathway taken depends on the available time for the transition
process; when only a relatively short time is available, the most likely path
is the one over the higher barrier. We find that upon varying temperature the
overall most likely pathway can switch from one to the other. We calculate the
statistics of where the barrier crossing occurs and the distribution of times
taken to reach the potential minimum. Interestingly, while the configuration
space statistics is complex, the time of arrival statistics is rather simple,
having an exponential probability density over most of the time range. Taken
together, our results show that empirically observed rates in nonequilibrium
systems should not be used to infer barrier heights.

Micro- and nanothermometry enable precise temperature monitoring and control
at the micro- and nanoscale, and have become essential diagnostic tools in
applications ranging from high-power microelectronics to biosensing and
nanomedicine. Most existing techniques rely on secondary micro- and
nanothermometers that require individual calibration of each sensor, ideally
both off- and in-situ, before use. We present an alternative approach that
overcomes this limitation by employing fluorescent diamonds containing
silicon-vacancy centers, where the thermo-sensitive physical quantities are the
centers' photoluminescence and the diamond host's Raman signals. The
photoluminescence and Raman data are analyzed using two multi-feature
regression algorithms that leverage a minimal number of calibration diamonds
and temperature set points to predict the temperature of previously unseen
diamonds. Using this approach, the models achieve accuracies as low as 0.7 K,
resolutions down to 0.6 K Hz$^{-1/2}$, and sensitivity as high as 0.04
K$^{-1}$. These correspond to improvements of roughly 70 percent (over
threefold) in accuracy, 50 percent (twofold) in resolution, and 567 percent
(sevenfold) in sensitivity compared with traditional single-feature models. Our
approach is particularly suited to applications where pre-deployment
calibration of every thermosensor is impractical, and it is generalizable to
any thermometry platform with two or more simultaneously measurable
temperature-dependent observables.

Understanding degradation in battery cathodes and other functional materials
requires simultaneous knowledge of structural, chemical, and electronic changes
in three dimensions (3D). Here, we present a simultaneous ADF-EDS-EELS
tomography method that enables 3D mapping of atomic structure, composition,
valence states, and transition metal inhomogeneity within a single, low-dose
STEM tilt series acquisition. Applied to LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 (NCM111) particles
at different electrochemical cycling stages, this method reveals nanoscale
degradation processes with full spatial correlation. We observe that while
chemical composition evolves uniformly throughout the entire primary particle,
valence state changes and transition metal segregation are strongly
depth-dependent and concentrated near the surface. This coexistence of bulk and
surface-driven degradation dynamics reveals distinct mechanisms acting at
different spatial scales. The evolution of inhomogeneity and valence states
deviates from simple phase transition models, highlighting the roles of ion
migration and dissolution-driven segregation. Our findings establish valence
state gradients and nanoscale inhomogeneity as active contributors to cathode
failure. More broadly, this correlative 3D platform opens new opportunities for
studying redox-driven transformations in fields such as neuromorphic computing
and heterogeneous catalysis, where composition-structure-function coupling is
inherently three-dimensional.

The supermoir\'e lattice, arising from the interference of multiple moir\'e
patterns, dramatically reshapes the electronic band structure by introducing
new minibands and modifying band dispersion. Concurrently, strong electronic
interactions within moir\'e flat bands lead to the emergence of various
correlated states. However, the impact of the supermoir\'e lattice on the flat
band systems with strong interactions remains largely unexplored. Here, we
report the existence of the supermoir\'e lattice in the mirror-symmetry-broken
twisted trilayer graphene, elucidating its role in generating mini-flat bands
and mini-Dirac bands. Furthermore, we demonstrate interaction-induced
symmetry-broken phases in the supermoir\'e mini-flat bands alongside the
cascade of superconductor-insulator transitions enabled by the supermoir\'e
lattice. Our work shows that robust superconductivity can exist in the
mirror-symmetry-broken TTG and underscores the significance of the supermoir\'e
lattice as an additional degree of freedom for tuning the electronic properties
in twisted multilayer systems, sheds light on the correlated quantum phases
such as superconductivity in the original moir\'e flat bands, and highlights
the potential of using the supermoir\'e lattice to design and simulate novel
quantum phases.

### Anisotropy by design in superconducting Nb thin films via ultrashort pulse laser irradiation

The ability to fabricate anisotropic superconducting layers a la carte is
desired in technologies such as fluxon screening or removal in field-resilient
devices, flux lensing in ultra-sensitive sensors, or in templates for
imprinting magnetic structures in hybrid magnetic/superconducting multilayers.
In this work, we demonstrate tailored superconductivity in polycrystalline
niobium thin films exposed to femtosecond ultraviolet laser pulses. The samples
exhibit significant changes in their superconducting properties, directly
connected with the observed topography, crystallite geometry, and lattice
parameter modifications. On the mesoscopic scale, quasi-parallel periodic
ripple structures (about 260 nm of spatial period) gradually form on the film
surface by progressively increasing the laser energy per pulse, Ep. This gives
way to a stepwise increase of the critical current anisotropy and magnetic flux
channeling effects along the ripples. As demonstrated in our resistive and
inductive measurements, these superstructures determine the electromagnetic
response of the sample within the regime dominated by flux-pinning.
Time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau simulations corroborate the topographical origin
of the customized anisotropy. Concurrently, intrinsic superconducting
parameters (critical field and temperature) are moderately and isotropically
depressed upon increasing Ep, as is the lattice parameter of Nb. These findings
promote pulsed laser processing as a flexible, one-step, and scalable
lithography-free technique for versatile surface functionalization in
microelectronic superconducting technology.

- **TL;DR**: 本文通过微扰法从Fokker-Planck方程推导出磁纳米粒子在交变和直流磁场中磁化行为的解析表达式，建立了基于磁化谐波的温度分析模型，实现了高精度温度估计。

Brownian relaxation is one of the primary mechanisms that allows magnetic
nanoparticles (MNPs) to convert magnetic energy into thermal energy under an
excitation magnetic field. Accurately characterizing the MNPs' magnetization
dynamics dominated by Brownian relaxation is crucial for achieving
high-precision temperature estimation. However, the lack of a readily
applicable analytical expression remains a major obstacle to the advancement of
magnetic nanoparticle hyperthermia (MNPH). In this paper, the perturbation
method was applied to derive analytical expressions from the Fokker-Planck
equation, which characterized MNPs' magnetization behaviors under the AC and DC
magnetic fields. Numerical simulations were conducted to validate the accuracy
of the analytical expressions and to explore the correlation between
temperature and the magnetization response. Then, a temperature analysis model
based on magnetization harmonics was constructed. The first and second harmonic
ratios and first harmonic phase were used to calculate MNPs' temperature,
respectively. The experimental results demonstrate that within 310 K to 320 K,
the estimation error of the temperature using the amplitude ratio of the first
to second harmonics is below 0.0151 K, while the error using the first harmonic
phase is below 0.0218 K. The derived analytical expressions are expected to
enhance the accuracy of MNP-based temperature measurements and facilitate their
broader applications in MNPH and MNP imaging.

### Synchronization transitions and spike dynamics in a higher-order Kuramoto model with Lévy noise

- **TL;DR**: 研究了高阶Kuramoto模型在非高斯Lévy噪声下的同步和尖峰动力学，揭示了噪声参数对同步边界的影响以及尖峰事件的统计特性。

Synchronization in various complex networks is significantly influenced by
higher-order interactions combined with non-Gaussian stochastic perturbations,
yet their mechanisms remain mainly unclear. In this paper, we systematically
investigate the synchronization and spike dynamics in a higher-order Kuramoto
model subjected to non-Gaussian L\'{e}vy noise. Using the mean order parameter,
mean first-passage time, and basin stability, we identify clear boundaries
distingusihing synchronization and incoherent states under different stability
indexes and scale parameters of L\'{e}vy noise. For fixed coupling parameters,
synchronization weakens as the stability index decreases, and even completely
disappears when the scale parameter exceeds a critical threshold. By varying
coupling parameters, we find significant dynamical phenomena including
bifurcations and hysteresis. L\'{e}vy noise smooths the synchronization
transitions and requires stronger coupling compared to Gaussian white noise.
Furthermore, we define spikes and systematically investigate their statistical
and spectral characteristics. The maximum number of spikes is observed at small
scale parameter. A generalized spectral analysis further reveals burst-like
structure via an edit distance algorithm. Moreover, a power-law distribution is
observed in the large inter-window intervals of spikes, showing great memory
effects. These findings deepen the understanding of synchronization and extreme
events in complex networks driven by non-Gaussian L\'{e}vy noise.

Advanced ab initio materials simulations face growing challenges as
increasing systems and phenomena complexity requires higher accuracy, driving
up computational demands. Quantum many-body GW methods are state-of-the-art for
treating electronic excited states and couplings but often hindered due to the
costly numerical complexity. Here, we present innovative implementations of
advanced GW methods within the BerkeleyGW package, enabling large-scale
simulations on Frontier and Aurora exascale platforms. Our approach
demonstrates exceptional versatility for complex heterogeneous systems with up
to 17,574 atoms, along with achieving true performance portability across GPU
architectures. We demonstrate excellent strong and weak scaling to thousands of
nodes, reaching double-precision core-kernel performance of 1.069 ExaFLOP/s on
Frontier (9,408 nodes) and 707.52 PetaFLOP/s on Aurora (9,600 nodes),
corresponding to 59.45% and 48.79% of peak, respectively. Our work demonstrates
a breakthrough in utilizing exascale computing for quantum materials
simulations, delivering unprecedented predictive capabilities for rational
designs of future quantum technologies.

### Two-dimensional THz spectroscopy in electronic systems: a many-body diagrammatic approach

- **TL;DR**: 本文为二维相干光谱（2DCS）提供了一个基于多体微扰图展开的理论框架，重点研究中心对称系统，将2D谱图解释转化为两个互补问题：规范场三阶响应函数的计算和多波传播效应的处理。

The term two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS) usually refers to
experimental setups where a coherently generated electric field in a sample is
recorded over many runs as a function of two time variables: the delay $\tau$
between two consequent excitation pulses and the time $t$ over which the signal
is emitted. While its implementation in the femtosecond time domain for
studying vibrational molecular states has been developed for over two decades,
its experimental application in the THz domain to interacting electronic
systems remains in its infancy. This work provides a general theoretical
framework for describing and interpreting 2DCS using a many-body language based
on a perturbative diagrammatic expansion, as widely applied in linear
spectroscopy. Focusing on centrosymmetric systems, we show that interpreting
the 2D maps can be recast into two complementary problems. The first is the
evaluation of a third-order response function to the gauge field. In the
velocity gauge, this leads to semi-analytical expressions that both reduce
computational complexity and assist in assigning spectral features to
microscopic processes, as shown using a toy model of electrons undergoing a
charge-density wave transition. The second is a careful treatment of multi-wave
propagation effects, which, in bulk systems, can obscure the intrinsic
nonlinear response, demonstrated here for soft superconducting Josephson
plasmons. Our results provide a solid foundation for extending 2DCS to complex
interacting systems and offer a flexible method to realistically model
nonlinear responses across arbitrary spectral widths.

### High-energy electron-beam induced defect engineering of monolayer MoS2 for tunable optical properties

- **TL;DR**: 该论文提出了一种利用高能电子束辐照在单层MoS2中可控引入缺陷的方法，通过调节辐照时间可以精确调控缺陷密度，从而改变材料的光学和电学性质。

Structural defects in 2D-transition metal dichalcogenides are critical in
modulating their optical and electrical behavior. Nevertheless, precise defect
control within the monolayer regime poses a significant challenge. Herein, a
high-energy (1MeV) electron beam irradiation strategy is harnessed to induce
defects in monolayer MoS2. Controlled variation of electron-beam irradiation
time tunes the defect density, as reflected by the evolution of defect-mediated
photoluminescence characteristics. The optically active defect emission
appearing at approx. 200-300meV below the A exciton at 85K exhibits a
systematic increase in intensity with prolonged exposure and saturates at
higher laser excitation power. Circular polarization-resolved photoluminescence
spectroscopy reveals strong suppression of valley polarization of the A exciton
after irradiation. Complementary x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy identifies
enhanced Mo-O bonding signatures in MoS2 following irradiation. Kelvin probe
force microscopy indicates the transition to p-type doping behaviour. A
detailed temperature and power-dependent photoluminescence measurements further
elucidate the optical behaviour of these defect states. Density functional
theory calculations using these configurations establish that the transition
between the conduction band and acceptor states within the bandgap accounts for
the defect emission. This work presents a tunable route for defect engineering
in monolayer TMDs, enabling controlled tailoring of their structural and
optical properties for optoelectronic, electronic and valleytronic
applications.

### The Limits of Inference in Complex Systems: When Stochastic Models Become Indistinguishable

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种基于全路径统计和桥过程的新型蒙特卡洛方法，用于解决随机建模中参数估计和模型选择的鲁棒推断问题，特别是在粗采样条件下的优化采样和性能表现。

Robust inference methods are essential for parameter estimation and model
selection in stochastic modeling approaches, which provide interpretable
frameworks for describing time series of complex phenomena. However, applying
such methods is often challenging, as they typically demand either
high-frequency observations or access to the model's analytical solution,
resources that are rarely available in practice. Here, we address these
limitations by designing a novel Monte Carlo method based on full-path
statistics and bridge processes, which optimize sampling efforts and
performance even under coarse sampling. We systematically investigate how
experimental design -- particularly sampling frequency and dataset size --
shapes inference accuracy, revealing optimal sampling regimes and the
fundamental limits of model distinguishability. We validate our approach on
four datasets -- optical tweezers, human microbiome, topic mentions in social
media, and forest population dynamics -- where resolution-dependent limits to
inference emerge, offering fresh insight into ongoing debates about the
dominant sources of noise in these systems. Overall, this work shows how
combining minimal stochastic models with path-inference tools and model
selection can guide the experimental design of optimized strategies in data
collection and clarify the boundaries of model-based understanding in complex
systems.

The inverse design of materials with specific desired properties, such as
high-temperature superconductivity, represents a formidable challenge in
materials science due to the vastness of chemical and structural space. We
present a guided diffusion framework to accelerate the discovery of novel
superconductors. A DiffCSP foundation model is pretrained on the Alexandria
Database and fine-tuned on 7,183 superconductors with first principles derived
labels. Employing classifier-free guidance, we sample 200,000 structures, which
lead to 34,027 unique candidates. A multistage screening process that combines
machine learning and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to assess
stability and electronic properties, identifies 773 candidates with
DFT-calculated $T_\mathrm{c}&gt;5$ K. Notably, our generative model demonstrates
effective property-driven design. Our computational findings were validated
against experimental synthesis and characterization performed as part of this
work, which highlighted challenges in sparsely charted chemistries. This
end-to-end workflow accelerates superconductor discovery while underscoring the
challenge of predicting and synthesizing experimentally realizable materials.

Interfaces between materials or phases -- whether in condensed matter
systems, biological membranes, or catalytic surfaces -- are rich with phenomena
that are fundamentally distinct from those present in the bulk. In some cases,
interfaces host quasiparticles, such as surface plasmons or Majorana fermions,
which can significantly influence the material properties. Here, we investigate
a unique 1D interface formed between two monolayer 2D semiconductors, MoSe2,
and WSe2, and unambiguously observe a new type of excitonic quasiparticle that
resides exclusively at the boundary. Our optical measurements reveal several
remarkable properties of this interfacial exciton. First, it possesses an
in-plane dipole moment with exceptionally large dipole lengths of 2nm. The
emission spectrum reveals narrow discrete states, indicating strong quantum
confinement of the center-of-mass motion across the interface. Power-dependent
measurements show a sublinear saturation behavior, reflecting interactions
between dipolar excitons in this low-dimensional system. Moreover, the exciton
displays striking sensitivity to charge carriers due to its dipolar character.
Our results introduce a new platform for exploring interacting 1D dipolar
bosonic systems with unique quantum properties and open pathways for novel
optoelectronic devices, including applications in nonlinear quantum photonics.

### A minimal model of self-organized clusters with phase transitions in ecological communities

- **TL;DR**: 基于广义Lotka-Volterra竞争模型，提出了一个生态群落最小模型，其中稳态包含自组织物种集群。该模型仅通过共同相互作用强度让物种在生态位空间中与邻居竞争，不依赖随机异质性。

In complex ecological communities, species may self-organize into clusters or
clumps where highly similar species can coexist. The emergence of such species
clusters can be captured by the interplay between neutral and niche theories.
Based on the generalized Lotka-Volterra model of competition, we propose a
minimal model for ecological communities in which the steady states contain
self-organized clusters. In this model, species compete only with their
neighbors in niche space through a common interaction strength. Unlike many
previous theories, this model does not rely on random heterogeneity in
interactions. By varying only the interaction strength, we find an
exponentially large set of cluster patterns with different sizes and
combinations. There are sharp phase transitions into the formation of clusters.
There are also multiple phase transitions between different sets of possible
cluster patterns, many of which accumulate near a small number of critical
points. We analyze such a phase structure using both numerical and analytical
methods. In addition, the special case with only nearest neighbor interactions
is exactly solvable using the method of transfer matrices from statistical
mechanics. We analyze the critical behavior of these systems and make
comparisons with existing lattice models.

### Noncollinear Magnetic Multipoles in Collinear Altermagnets

Altermagnets host an array of magnetic multipoles, which are often visualized
and studied in the reciprocal space. In the real space, the relative phase of
the multipoles of the spin-density around atoms determines whether a system is
an altermagnet or a conventional antiferromagnet. In this study, we approach
these real space multipoles in altermagnets using a combination of first
principles calculations and group theory. We show that even in collinear
magnets, the local spin density is necessarily noncollinear due to spin-orbit
coupling. Moreover, the noncollinear contributions often provide a more direct
illustration of the magnetic multipolar character of altermagnetism than the
collinear contribution, which is dominated by the dipolar term. Our first
principles calculations also show that 32-poles, in addition to the octupoles,
can be visible in spin-density of d-wave altermagnets, and they must be taken
into account in discussions of the macroscopic response. Finally, we elucidate
the interplay between magnetism and subtle crystal structural distortions in
perovskite altermagnets, which provide a fertile playground for studying phase
transitions between antiferromagnetic and altermagnetic phases.

### Intrinsic spin accumulation in magnetic spin Hall effect

The magnetic spin Hall effect is a time-reversal-odd phenomenon in which spin
current is induced by the charge current. In the presence of a spin-orbit
coupling and/or noncolinear magnetism, however, spin current is not uniquely
defined. Instead, we study an intrinsic response of spin to an electric field
gradient that describes the spin accumulation at the boundaries of magnetic
systems. We derive a generic formula expressed by Bloch wave functions and
apply it to a minimal model for representative altermagnets, RuO$_{2}$ and
MnF$_{2}$. Our results show that the intrinsic spin accumulation can be nonzero
in magnetic insulators in sharp contrast to the magnetic spin Hall
conductivity.

### Magnetoelectric Switching of Competing Magnetic Orders in Rhombohedral Graphene

A finite Hall conductance under zero magnetic field implies time reversal
symmetry (TRS) breaking due to magnetic ordering. In rhombohedral (RH) stacked
graphene, the angular momentum breaking TRS can result from the orbital degree
of freedom at the $K$ and $K'$ valleys. This leads to valley polarization and
occupation-dependent anomalous Hall resistance (AHR) due to the chirality in
Berry curvature between the valleys. We report magnetoelectric control of
orbital magnetic order in crystalline rhombohedral hexalayer graphene (RHG),
achieved without the introduction of a moir\'e superlattice. At moderate
displacement fields and low carrier densities, we observe a non-volatile and
hysteretic AHR that can be electrically toggled by sweeping either the carrier
density or the displacement field. Upon the application of small perpendicular
magnetic fields, the system reveals a characteristic double sign reversal of
the AHR, indicating a competition between distinct magnetic ground states. This
interplay between valley polarization, orbital magnetism, and electric and
magnetic field tuning demonstrates the rich multiferroic behavior of RHG. Our
findings present crystalline RHG as a minimal, tunable platform for studying
symmetry-breaking phases and magnetic order in flat-band systems, offering
insight into the coupling between electronic structure and magnetoelectric
response.

We compute exactly the overlap between the eigenvectors of two large

generalizing the results obtained previously for non-intersecting intervals.
Our method relies on a particular form of Girko linearisation and extended
local laws. We check our results numerically and apply them to financial data.

Hexagonal close-packed (hcp) titanium exhibits a complex
temperature-dependent mechanical response that is central to its use in
structural applications. We employ large-scale molecular dynamics simulations
to investigate the nanoindentation behavior of single-crystalline a-Ti along
the [0001], [10-10], and [2-110] orientations at 10, 300, and 600 K. The
simulations reveal how temperature modifies the onset of plasticity and the
subsequent evolution of dislocation activity, including nucleation, glide, and
the competition between basal and pyramidal &lt;c+a&gt; slip. Schmid factor mapping
establishes a direct correlation between the orientation-dependent activation
of slip systems and the resolved shear stress fields beneath the indenter. The
results demonstrate a pronounced increase in thermally assisted dislocation
motion with temperature, which manifests as diffuse slip traces and less
localized pile-up patterns. Surface morphologies obtained at 300 K are
consistent with atomic force microscopy observations, validating the atomistic
modeling approach. At elevated temperatures, enhanced dislocation recovery and
redistribution of slip pathways dominate the indentation response, highlighting
the role of thermal activation in controlling plasticity in hcp titanium.

We study a one-dimensional topological model featuring a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger
type pattern of nearest-neighbor couplings in combination with the longer-range
interactions exponentially decaying with the distance. We demonstrate that even
relatively weak long-range couplings can trigger the topological transition if
their range is large enough. This provides an additional facet in the control
of topological phases.

### Selective nonthermal melting in phlogopite under ultrafast energy deposition

- **TL;DR**: 该论文研究了金云母在超快电子激发下的响应，揭示了不同能量沉积剂量下材料的相变过程：从氢迁移到超离子态，再到镁原子扩散，最终晶格失稳和金属化转变。

Phlogopite is a complex magnesium-rich mineral from the dark mica group,
KMg$_3$(AlSi$_3$O$_{10}$)(OH)$_2$. Its response to ultrafast excitation of its
electronic system is studied using a hybrid model that combines tight-binding
molecular dynamics with transport Monte Carlo and the Boltzmann equation.
Simulations predict that at the deposited dose of ~0.17 eV/atom (electronic
temperature $T_e$~11,000 K), the first hydrogens start to migrate in the
otherwise preserved lattice, transiently turning mica into a superionic state.
At the dose of ~0.4 eV/atom ($T_e$~13,000 K), Mg atoms start to diffuse like a
liquid within stable sublattices of other elements, suggesting a
superionic-superionic phase transition. At a dose of approximately 0.5 eV/atom
($T_e$~14,000 K), the entire atomic lattice destabilizes, disordering on
picosecond timescale. It is accompanied by the formation of defect energy
levels inside the bandgap. At the doses ~0.9 eV/atom ($T_e$~16,000 K), the
bandgap completely collapses, turning the material metallic (electronically
conducting). At even higher doses, nonthermal acceleration of atoms heats the
atomic system at ultrafast timescales; K and O elements are most affected,
accelerating within a few tens of femtoseconds.

### Robust Majorana Platform Driven by a Meissner-Induced Anisotropic Doppler Shift

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种利用拓扑绝缘体纳米线和超导层部分覆盖的新平台，通过Meissner效应产生空间变化的Doppler位移，实现局部拓扑相变，从而创造鲁棒的Majorana零模式。

The realization of robust Majorana zero modes (MZMs), a cornerstone for
fault-tolerant quantum computing, is hindered by the challenge of creating a
platform that simultaneously offers a large topological gap, high tunability,
and resilience to disorder. A system unifying these properties has remained
elusive. Here, we propose and validate a novel platform that harnesses the
Meissner effect in a topological insulator (TI) nanowire partially covered by a
superconducting (SC) layer. Under an external magnetic field, Meissner
screening currents in the SC induce a spatially varying Doppler shift on the TI
surface. This effect generates a highly anisotropic effective g-factor, which
selectively drives a topological phase transition localized on the nanowire's
bottom surface. This mechanism is crucial as it spatially separates the
topological phase from the SC/TI interface, permitting strong proximity-induced
superconductivity while preventing detrimental band renormalization at the
interface from closing the topological gap. Furthermore, by confining the
topological superconducting phase to the gate-tunable bottom surface, our
platform fully leverages the intrinsic disorder resilience of the TI's
topologically protected surface states. Through a combination of supercurrent
simulations, self-consistent Schr\"odinger-Poisson calculations, and
large-scale tight-binding computations, we validate the platform's robustness.
Our work establishes a practical pathway toward Meissner-mediated topological
superconductivity for realizing robust MZMs in SC/TI hybrid systems.

### Evidence of electronic instability driven structural distortion in the nodal line semimetal CoSn$_2$

Understanding the mechanisms that drive spontaneous rotational symmetry
breaking in correlated electron systems is a central challenge in condensed
matter physics. Although such symmetry breaking phases have been studied in
low-dimensional and strongly correlated materials, its emergence in
structurally simpler compounds remains less explored. Here, we investigate
non-magnetic CoSn$_2$ that is a centrosymmetric intermetallic compound
crystallizing in a tetragonal structure at ambient conditions, and discover an
electronically driven symmetry breaking instability. Electrical resistivity
reveals a distinct change in the slope below 25 K, deviating from the expected
Bloch-Gr\"uneisen behavior. This anomaly is attributed towards a structural
change as at 22 K single crystal X-ray diffraction using synchrotron radiation
uncovers weak superlattice reflections that leads to a doubling of $\textbf{a}$
and $\textbf{c}$, resulting in a 4-fold superstructure. The symmetry of the
lattice reduces from tetragonal to acentric monoclinic but without any
discernible monoclinic distortion down to 10 K. This structural transition is
accompanied by a twofold symmetry in angular magnetoresistance, contrasting the
fourfold symmetry observed at higher temperatures. First-principles
calculations show no phonon softening but reveal enhanced electronic
susceptibility, suggesting an electronic instability. Polarization-dependent
ARPES measurements further identify a strong orbital anisotropy dominated by
the in-plane Co-$d_{xy}$ states. Collectively, our results point to an
electronic instability driven structural distortion in CoSn$_2$, offering a
rare platform to study symmetry breaking in a non-magnetic metallic system.

### Trace Element Behavior during Shock Transformation of Zircon to Reidite

Large single crystals of natural zircon were shock-loaded at 13.6 and 51.3
GPa in planar geometry. No structural changes were observed after loading at
13.6 GPa. Loading to 51.3 GPa resulted in zircon transformation to a denser
scheelite-structured phase, reidite. The investigation of reidite samples by
X-ray diffraction, Raman, photo- and cathodoluminescence spectroscopies
revealed segregation of some trace cations (such as REE) on planar defects
during the transformation. The segregation has occurred in a laboratory
experiment without long-term annealing after the shock loading. A possible
mechanism of the segregation of trivalent trace cations assumes local violation
of charge balance during the zircon-reidite reconstructive transformation,
which is accompanied by changes in the topology of polyhedra and second
coordination spheres (Si-Zr). This results in expulsion of a fraction of the
trace elements into energetically expensive interstitial positions with high
diffusivity even at relatively low temperatures.

### Snakelike trajectories of electrons released from quantum dots driven by the spin Hall effect

Using time dependent simulations, we analyze the trajectories of electrons
released from a quantum dot in a waveguide made of a spin-orbit-coupled
material (InSb). An electron released from the quantum dot, when driven by an
electric field follows a trajectory that is deflected by spin-orbit interaction
and undergoes spin precession that results in a spin-dependent, snake-like
trajectory. The trajectory strongly depends on the initial state of the
electron, enabling detection of the electron quantum state in the dot when
connected to the T-junction. Notably, we show that the snake-like trajectory
persists even under a small external magnetic field with low, incomplete
initial electron spin polarization. Our findings are supported by semiclassical
calculations of the electron trajectory, which show good agreement with full
quantum mechanical simulations

### Accelerating Crystal Structure Prediction Using Data-Derived Potentials: High-Pressure Binary Hydrides

- **TL;DR**: 使用Ephemeral Data-Derived Potentials (EDDPs)结合AIRSS方法，在100 GPa压力下对二元氢化物进行加速结构搜索，发现了多种新型富氢相和亚化学计量变体。

Crystal structures can be predicted from first-principles using ab initio
random structure searching AIRSS and density functional theory (DFT). AIRSS
provides a method to sample the potential energy landscape and DFT provides a
robust and accurate description of that landscape. Classical interatomic
potentials can describe energy landscapes at a significantly lower
computational cost, typically at the expense of robustness and accuracy. Modern
machine-learning interatomic potentials offer a compromise, with greater
robustness and accuracy than classical potentials at a fraction of the
computational cost of DFT. In this work, we use Ephemeral Data-Derived
Potentials EDDPs to perform accelerated AIRSS calculations for the binary
hydrides at 100 GPa. Since the training data is generated iteratively using
AIRSS, the searches can be performed with no prior knowledge of hydrides. These
potentials allow for more diverse searches, sampling a wider range of
compositions, larger unit cells, and orders-of-magnitude more structures. In
addition to recovering many of the known structures, the searches reveal
structures such as the hydrogen-rich phases of H$_{22}$(BrH), H$_{23}$Pb, and
H$_{32}$Mg, supermolecular phases of H$_{25}$Cs and H$_{26}$Rn, and many
substoichiometric variants of known hydrides. Our results indicate that using
the current generation of pretrained universal MLIPs to search for novel
high-pressure hydrides is less effective due to model instabilities or markedly
slower inference speeds and highlight the necessity of generating new, targeted
data to drive further discoveries.

Recent advances in nanotechnology have created the need to manufacture
three-dimensional nanostructures with controlled material composition. Focused
Electron Beam Induced Deposition (FEBID) is a nanoprinting technique offering
highest spatial resolution combined with the ability to directly 3D-print
almost any shape. It relies on local electron-induced dissociation of
metal-ligand organometallic molecules adsorbed onto a substrate. So far FEBID
continuum modelling involved the surface kinetics of precursor molecules during
electron irradiation and succeeded in the prediction of nanoprint shape and
growth rate and forms nowadays the basis of software for 3D nano-printing of
nanostructures. Here, we expand the model to the surface kinetics of detached
ligands. Involving their dissociation and desorption behavior allows to predict
trends in the metallic composition of the nanoprinted material and to define
desirable nanoprint process windows as function of electron exposure time and
flux. We present the theoretical foundations of the model, validate it
experimentally for chromium and silver precursors, compare calculated values
with literature data for various precursors, and discuss its potential to
design new experiments. This contribution enhances our understanding of FEBID
dynamics and provides a versatile framework for predictive FEBID material
nano-printing.

Pseudospin models are proposed for description of the phase transitions,
dielectric characteristics, and polarization switching in two crystals of the
phenyltetrazole family. One of them, APHTZ, is a canted ferroelectric, whereas
the other, MPHTZ is a simple antiferroelectric. In APHTZ the electric field,
applied perpendicularly to the axis of spontaneous polarization, flips the
polarization in one of the two sublattices, effectively rotating the non-zero
net polarization by 90$^\circ$ and switching the system between two different
ferroelectric configurations. The temperature-electric field phase diagrams are
constructed. The diagram topology appears to be typical for the Ising-like
antiferroelectric systems.

Superconducting diodes, similar to semiconductor diodes, possess
unidirectional superconducting properties and are the fundamental units for
constructing superconducting quantum computing, thus attracting widespread
attention. At present, most of superconducting diodes require an external
magnetic field or proximity effect to break time reversal symmetry (TRS). The
cases of intrinsic superconducting diode effect (SDE) under zero magnetic field
are relatively scarce, and there are still some puzzles especially regarding
the reasons for the TRS breaking. Here, we not only report field free SDE in
NbSe2 induced by strain, but also large values of the difference of Ic+ and
|Ic-| ({\Delta}Ic) of 286 {\mu}A and the superconducting diode efficiency
({\eta}) of 6.76 % are achieved. Interestingly, {\Delta}Ic varies with the
magnetic field and exhibits two distinct evolutionary behaviors with B-odd or
B-even symmetry in various devices. We attribute this to the selective
activation of two independent, spatially-orthogonal mechanisms: a
stress-induced real-space polarity and a field-induced reciprocal-space
asymmetric energy bands. In general, we propose an extremely effectively method
to produce field free SDE, even when the material itself does not possess field
free SDE, and provide new perspectives to understand the SDE which build new
avenues for superconducting quantum devices.

### Domain Boundaries in a Metallic Distortive Polar Metal

Polar metals are an underexplored material class combining two properties
that are typically incompatible, namely a polar crystal structure and
reasonable electrical conductivity. While intriguing given that metals favor
centrosymmetry, these materials also exhibit potential functional properties
relevant to memory, optoelectronic, catalytic, and other applications. The
distortive polar metal (DPM) subclass forms through a centrosymmetry-lifting
phase transformation into a polar crystal structure. In the process, domains
with uniform geometric polar directions form, oftentimes separated by domain
boundaries with polarity discontinuities arranged in "charged" head-to-head
(H-H) or tail-to-tail (T-T) morphologies. To date, only metallic oxide DPM
microstructures have been studied. Here we reveal in the intermetallic DPM
Mn5Al8 different chemical reactivity and surface interactions at domain
boundaries depending on their H-H or T-T character. Variable surface
electron-transfer reactivity suggests localized changes in electronic work
functions due to an increase (H-H) or depletion (T-T) in the electronic density
of states. This behavior is unintuitive in a metal where electrostatic
de-polarizing fields should not account for fluctuations in carrier densities.
These findings suggest that metallic DPMs may offer functionalizable domain
boundary behavior and deserve increased attention. Metallic DPMs allow highly
tunable chemistries that can undergo various thermomechanical processing and
transformation protocols. Ultimately, this study marks a milestone in metal
physics and uncovers novel intermetallic properties, propelling the discovery
and design of advanced electronic materials and devices.

Many ferroelectric materials undergo thermally driven transitions between
cubic and tetragonal phases. Despite being well-known for decades, such
transitions still pose unresolved questions, particularly about the role of
domains in shaping the transition pathway. It is understood that tetragonal
domain assemblages are crucial for mismatch-free coexistence of both tetragonal
and cubic phases, as described by the Weschler-Lieberman-Read (WLR)
crystallographic theory. However, direct experimental characterization of
domain patterns during the phase transition remains challenging. Here, we
enhance the single-crystal X-ray diffraction to investigate domain
microstructures during cubic-tetragonal phase transition, leveraging the
bulk-penetrating and non-destructive character of this method. We extend the
WLR model by the analytical expressions for the orientation relationships
between the real and reciprocal bases of the cubic phase and tetragonal
domains. We systematically catalogue the Bragg peak separations for 24 possible
coexistence variants and validate these predictions using 3D reciprocal space
maps from a piezo-/ferroelectric PMN-35PT crystal at phase coexistence
temperatures. Our results provide a framework for interpreting domain
configurations during the phase transition and offer insights applicable to
other systems involving orientation relationships in coexisting phases.

Magnetic order parameters in altermagnets can couple to quantized lattice
vibration via both piezomagnetic and magnetoelastic effects, leading to the
renormalization of phonon dispersion. Here, we demonstrate photo-induced
dynamic frequency modulation of THz phonons excited in anisotropically-strained
epitaxial RuO2 thin films using ultrafast coherent phonon spectroscopy and
time-resolved magneto-optic Kerr effect measurement. A coherent oscillation of
a transverse acoustic phonon appears in the sub-THz range with increasing film
thickness above 4 nm due to local dislocation arising from the anisotropic
strain relaxation, which hosts large non-zero shear strain. Interestingly, this
phonon mode exhibits a time-varying mode hardening below ~ 500 K. Furthermore,
an optical phonon oscillation emerges in magnetization dynamics of the
photo-induced non-equilibrium state, and it becomes significantly softened near
the critical temperature, while there is no observable magneto-optic signal in
fully-strain-relaxed films. Such notable dynamic frequency modulations in
acoustic and optical phonons offer an opportunity to manipulate phonons in the
THz range through the spin-phonon coupling controlled by epitaxial design,
which can inspire the new class of altermagnetic applications in the ultrafast
quantum opto-spintronics.

We present C-BerryTrans, a C++ code designed for first-principles
calculations of Berry-curvature-driven transverse transport properties, namely
the anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) i.e., $\sigma_{\mu \nu}^{AHC}$ and
anomalous Nernst conductivity (ANC) i.e., $\alpha_{\mu \nu}^{ANC}$. The code
directly extracts eigenvalues and momentum-matrix elements from WIEN2k
calculations and evaluates the Berry curvature ($\boldsymbol\Omega$) using a
Kubo-like formalism. For computational efficiency, C-BerryTrans parallelizes
$\boldsymbol\Omega$ evaluation over k-points using OpenMP and stores
band-resolved curvature in binary format. This design enables rapid
post-processing of AHC and ANC over a wide range of temperatures and chemical
potentials ($\mu$) in a single run. The code has been benchmarked on
well-studied ferromagnetic materials (Fe, Fe$_3$Ge, Pd, Fe$_3$Al, and
Co$_2$FeAl). For Fe, the $\sigma_{xy}^{AHC}$ is obtained to be $\sim$775
($\sim$744) $S/cm$ at 0 (300) K. In case of Fe$_3$Ge, the calculated value of
$\sigma_{xy}^{AHC}$ is found to be 311 $S/cm$ at the room temperature. Nextly,
for Co$_2$FeAl, the magnitude of computed value of $\sigma_{xy}^{AHC}$ at 2 K
is found to be $\sim$56 $S/cm$. Next, magnitude of $\alpha_{xy}^{ANC}$ for Pd
is obtained to be $\sim$0.97 $AK^{-1}m^{-1}$ at 300 K. For Fe$_3$Al, the
maximum magnitude of $\alpha_{xy}^{ANC}$ for $T\leq$500 K is computed as
$\sim$2.83 $AK^{-1}m^{-1}$. Lastly, for Co$_2$FeAl, the value of
$\alpha_{xy}^{ANC}$ is obtained to be $\sim$0.10 $AK^{-1}m^{-1}$ at 300 K.
These results show good agreement with previously reported data. With its
accuracy, scalability, and user-friendly workflow, C-BerryTrans provides a
powerful tool for exploring $\boldsymbol\Omega$-driven transport phenomena and
is well suited for high-throughput materials discovery.

We investigated the interaction of the pesticide chlorothalonil (CLT) with
single-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) using
density functional theory (DFT) with the SIESTA code. Structural, energetic,
and electronic analyses were used to characterize adsorption on nanotube
surfaces. The adsorption energy becomes more favorable as the tube radius
increases, consistent with enhanced pi-pi stacking on less curved surfaces.
Both CNTs and BNNTs physisorb CLT; however, BNNTs appear more promising for CLT
detection and removal in contaminated environments. The tube radius strongly
affects the computed electronic and energetic descriptors. Complementary
molecular dynamics simulations in GROMACS confirm the stability of CLT adsorbed
on CNT and BNNT surfaces in aqueous solution.

Cu-doped NiO thin films were deposited on ITO substrates via spray pyrolysis
at 450 {\deg}C for 1.5 minutes. XRD confirmed a cubic NiO structure, with Cu
incorporation reducing crystallite size, increasing interplanar spacing, and
expanding the lattice parameter, indicating successful substitution of Cu ions.
Optical analysis showed a slight bandgap reduction from 3.70 to 3.65 eV, while
PL revealed lower emission intensity, suggesting enhanced defect states and
suppressed carrier recombination. Raman spectroscopy exhibited redshifts in LO,
2TO, and 2LO modes and the disappearance of the TO mode, confirming lattice
distortion from Cu doping. Gas sensing tests under ambient and LPG conditions
demonstrated significantly improved sensitivity and voltage-dependent response
for doped films. These results establish that Cu incorporation enhances charge
transport and gas interaction mechanisms, making Cu-doped NiO films highly
promising for efficient and reliable gas sensors.

- **TL;DR**: 本文展示了基于铁磁/手性材料异质结构的纳米级手性选择性热开关，通过外部磁场控制热传输特性，在室温下热开关比达到1.07，50K时增至1.2。

Chiral-lattice degrees of freedom can offer novel chirality-selective
functionalities for thermotronic applications. Chiral phonons, carrying both
heat and angular momentum, can emerge through a breaking of chiral degeneracy
in the phonon bands, either via an intrinsic chiral crystal structure or by
angular momentum transfer from photons or spins. This chiral controllability of
the lattice dynamics enables a design of chiral thermo-devices by integrating
ferromagnets with chiral materials. Here, we present a nanoscale
chirality-selective thermal switch realized using a simple heterostructure
composed of ferromagnetic [Co/Pt] multilayers and insulating chiral
$\alpha$-SiO2, where an external magnetic field can control thermal transport
properties. Our experimental results based on the magneto-optic thermometry
reveal that the thermal conductivity of $\alpha$-SiO2 exhibits a clear
dependence on both the magnetization direction of [Co/Pt] multilayers and the
structural chirality of $\alpha$-SiO2, which is supported well by the
first-principles-based molecular dynamic simulations. The
magnetization-dependent thermal on/off ratio amounts to 1.07 at room
temperature and increases to about 1.2 as temperature decreases to 50 K, due to
a reduction of Umklapp phonon-phonon scattering rate in $\alpha$-SiO2. These
findings provide the first experimental demonstration of the nanoscale
chirality-selective thermal switch based on the ferromagnetic/chiral material
heterostructure, highlighting its potential as a key technology for addressing
heat dissipation challenges in nanoscale electronic devices.

### The role of the solid-melt interface in accelerating the self-catalyzed growth kinetics of III-V semiconductors

- **TL;DR**: 通过机器学习原子间势能模拟，发现GaN-Ga熔体界面处多层Ga原子形成有序带电结构，显著降低N吸附迁移能垒，实现扩散控制的逐层生长机制。

Solid-melt interfaces play a pivotal role in governing crystal growth and
metal-mediated epitaxy of gallium nitride (GaN) and other semiconductor
materials. Using atomistic simulations based on machine-learning interatomic
potentials (MLIPs), we uncover that multiple layers of Ga atoms at the GaN-Ga
melt interface form structurally ordered and electronically charged
configurations that are critical for the growth kinetics of GaN. These ordered
layers modulate the free energy landscape (FEL) for N adsorption and
substantially reduce the migration barriers for N at the interface compared to
a clean GaN surface. Leveraging these interfacial energetics, kinetic Monte
Carlo (KMC) simulations reveal that GaN growth follows a diffusion-controlled,
layer-by-layer mechanism, with the FEL for N adsorption emerging as the
rate-limiting factor. By incorporating facet-specific FELs and the
diffusivity/solubility of N in Ga melt, we develop a predictive, fitting-free
transport model that estimates facet-dependent growth rates in the range of
~0.01 to 0.04 nm/s, in agreement with experimental growth rates observed in GaN
nanoparticles synthesized by Ga-mediated molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). This
multiscale framework offers a generalizable and quantitative approach to link
atomic-scale ordering and interfacial energetics to macroscopic phenomena,
providing actionable insights for the rational design of metal-mediated
epitaxial processes.

The effect of the selenium concentration in the composition of the
$Cd_{1-x}Zn_{x}Te_{1-y}Se_{y}$ semiconductor crystals on their etching with a
bromine-methanol solution was studied. A thermodynamic model is proposed to
describe the degree of etching of $Cd_{1-x}Zn_{x}Te$ and
$Cd_{1-x}Zn_{x}Te_{1-y}Se_{y}$ crystals. A thermodynamic law is obtained for
the first time to describe the change in the etching rate of
$Cd_{1-x}Zn_{x}Te_{1-y}Se_{y}$ crystals with different selenium concentrations.
Experimental dependencies are constructed for etching trajectories and etching
rates with 5% bromine-methanol solutions of $Cd_{1-x}Zn_{x}Te_{1-y}Se_{y}$
crystal samples with nominal $x\sim 0.1$ and selenium concentrations of $y=0$,
$y=0.02$, $y=0.06$, and $y=0.1$. The average etching rates were 24${\mu
}$m/min, 18${\mu }$m/min, 15${\mu }$m/min, and 13${\mu }$m/min. The threshold
effect of a strong decrease in the etching rate upon transition from ternary
$Cd_{1-x}Zn_{x}Te$ to quaternary $Cd_{1-x}Zn_{x}Te_{1-y}Se_{y}$ crystals,
associated with hardening of the crystal structure, is identify and
theoretically explained. The obtained experimental data are in good agreement
with the theoretical estimates and will be useful for choosing the optimal
regimes of crystal treatment.

### Detection of magnetic monopole in image potential states of topological insulators

Magnetic monopoles, hypothetical particles behaving as isolated magnetic
charges, have long been predicted by theories beyond the standard model but
remain elusive in experimental detection. In this study, we demonstrate a novel
method to induce and detect magnetic monopoles on the surface of
three-dimensional (3D) topological insulators (TIs) using scanning tunneling
microscopy (STM). By applying a radially distributed electric field via the STM
tip to induce an image magnetic monopole using the topological magnetoelectric
(TME) effect, we observe electric field-dependent intrinsic splitting peaks of
image potential states (IPS) on the surface of a 3D high-order TI Bi(111).
These IPS splitting phenomena originate from the Zeeman effect of the orbital
magnetic moments interacting with the magnetic field generated by the magnetic
monopoles. Our experimental results, supported by theoretical modeling,
successfully demonstrate the detection of magnetic monopole. This work not only
deepens our understanding of topological field theory and axion insulators but
also opens new avenues for detecting and manipulating magnetic monopoles. The
findings suggest that similar studies can be extended to other topological
insulator systems, offering potential applications in quantum computing and
novel electronic devices.

### The influence of solute induced memory on interface migration

- **TL;DR**: 本文提出了一种时间局部传播子方法来处理界面迁移中的非马尔可夫效应，特别是在低同源温度和小驱动力条件下，溶质引起的记忆效应会显著影响界面动力学分析。

Interface migration governs microstructural evolution during phase
transformations and grain growth thereby dictating those material properties
that depend on microstructure. Recent work continues to highlight the rich
range of behaviors exhibited by migrating interfaces and the complex connection
between these behaviors and the underlying atomistic processes that determine
coarse-grained interfacial mobility. For interfaces moving at low homologous
temperatures and small driving forces, we show that significant non-Markovian
effects can arise that invalidate commonly used analysis methods. Specifically,
we demonstrate that solute can act as a source of such non-Markovian motion. In
turn, we introduce a time-local (TCL) propagator approach to account for
memory-dominated short and intermediate time interface dynamics. This approach
extrapolates to the long time diffusive limit, enabling robust mobility
estimates from simulation windows far shorter than those required to observe
linear scaling directly. Comparison with solute-free boundaries validates the
method and quantifies solute drag in the Cahn-Hillert sense, providing a route
to extract drag coefficients and effective mobilities across a range of solute
concentrations. Our results demonstrate that analysis including memory is
essential for connecting atomistic simulations to continuum models and offer a
practical framework for studying interface kinetics in systems with slow
internal processes.

Metal inorganic-organic complex (MIOC) crystals are a new category of hybrid
glass formers. However, the glass-forming compositions of MIOC crystals are
limited due to lack of both a general design principle for such compositions
and a deep understanding of the structure and formation mechanism for MIOC
glasses. This work reports a general approach for synthesizing glass-forming
MIOC crystals. In detail, the principle of this approach is based on the
creation of hydrogen-bonded structural network by substituting acid anions for
imidazole or benzimidazole ligands in the tetrahedral units of zeolitic
imidazolate framework crystals. By tuning the metal centers, anions, and
organic ligands of MIOCs, supramolecular unit structures can be designed to
construct supramolecular networks and thereby enable property modulation.
Furthermore, mixed-ligand synthesis yielded a mixed-crystal system in which the
glass-transition temperature (Tg) can be linearly tuned from 282 K to 360 K
through gradual substitution of benzimidazole for imidazole. Interestingly,
upon vitrification, MIOCs were observed to undergo reorganization of
hydrogen-bonded networks, with retention of tetrahedral units, short-range
disorder, and the freezing of multiple conformations. This work offers a new
strategy to systematically expand the glass-forming compositional range of
MIOCs and to develop functional MIOC glasses.

SrTiO3 is a textbook quantum paraelectric, with ferroelectricity purportedly
suppressed by quantum fluctuations of ionic positions down to the lowest
temperatures. The precise real space structure of SrTiO3 at low temperature,
however, has remained undefined despite decades of study. Here we directly
image the low-temperature polar structure of quantum parelectric SrTiO3, using
cryogenic scanning transmission electron microscopy down to 20 K. High
resolution imaging reveals a spatially fluctuating landscape of nanoscale
domains of finite polarization. The short-range polar domains first grow and
self-organize into a periodic structure over tens of nanometers. However, the
process reverses when entering the quantum paraelectric regime below 40 K and
the periodically ordered polar nanodomains fragment into small clusters.

Al-Mg-Si alloys are utilized in large scale electrical conduction
applications thanks to their low density, high strength, and low electrical
resistivity. The alloying elements, Mg and Si, are introduced to improve the
mechanical strength; however, the formed defects also suppress electrical
conductivity, adversely affecting the material performance. Here, we
investigate the impact of alloying, heat treatment, and the corresponding
microstructure, on the electrical resistivity of overaged alloys having 0.5-9.5
at. % solute. The crystal structure, composition, and microstructure are
characterized by X-ray diffraction, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy,
electron backscatter diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy. The
electrical resistivity of the microstructural components, i.e., the Al solid
solution matrix and the Si and Mg2Si precipitates, are directly measured using
a microscale four-point probe setup inside a scanning electron microscope. We
find that the Al solid solution matrix is up to 15 % more resistive than pure
Al, depending on the heat treatment rather than the composition, and that
regions including Si or Mg2Si precipitates are equally resistive. Additionally,
the bulk alloy resistivity, measured conventionally on a macroscopic length
scale, increases linearly up to 60 % with increasing total solute concentration
up to ~ 10 at. %. This study relates the electrical resistivity of Al-Mg-Si
alloys, measured at microscopic and macroscopic length scales, with their
microstructure and composition.
