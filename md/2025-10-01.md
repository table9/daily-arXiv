### Diffusion with doubly stochastic resetting

- **TL;DR**: 本文扩展了带随机重置的扩散模型，引入重置率自身随时间波动的新协议，揭示了稳态分布的三个空间区域特征。

Diffusion with stochastic resetting, instantaneous returns of a diffusing
particle to a reference point, creates a stationary probability distribution.
The paradigm is extended here to a doubly stochastic protocol in which the
resetting rate itself fluctuates in time and relaxes on its own timescale. An
exact steady-state solution reveals three spatial regimes: a
fluctuation-dominated core near the origin, a power-law regime at intermediate
distances, and a far-field exponential decay fixed by the rate-relaxation time.
These results expose how the instantaneous rate, mean rate, and relaxation time
come together to determine the non-equilibrium steady state.

### A general optimization framework for mapping local transition-state networks
- **arXiv**: [2509.26269](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26269)  ·  [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.26269.pdf)
- **Title (EN)**: A general optimization framework for mapping local transition-state networks
- **Authors**: Qichen Xu, Anna Delin
- **Categories**: physics.comp-ph, cond-mat.mtrl-sci, cs.NE
- **TL;DR**: 提出了一个通用的优化框架，通过多目标探索器和双层最小模式内核系统性地扩展局部覆盖，用于映射复杂系统的能量景观和过渡态网络。

Understanding how complex systems transition between states requires mapping
the energy landscape that governs these changes. Local transition-state
networks reveal the barrier architecture that explains observed behaviour and
enables mechanism-based prediction across computational chemistry, biology, and
physics, yet current practice either prescribes endpoints or randomly samples
only a few saddles around an initial guess. We present a general optimization
framework that systematically expands local coverage by coupling a
multi-objective explorer with a bilayer minimum-mode kernel. The inner layer
uses Hessian-vector products to recover the lowest-curvature subspace (smallest
k eigenpairs), the outer layer optimizes on a reflected force to reach index-1
saddles, then a two-sided descent certifies connectivity. The GPU-based
pipeline is portable across autodiff backends and eigensolvers and, on large
atomistic-spin tests, matches explicit-Hessian accuracy while cutting peak
memory and wall time by orders of magnitude. Applied to a DFT-parameterized
N\'eel-type skyrmionic model, it recovers known routes and reveals previously
unreported mechanisms, including meron-antimeron-mediated N\'eel-type
skyrmionic duplication, annihilation, and chiral-droplet formation, enabling up
to 32 pathways between biskyrmion (Q=2) and biantiskyrmion (Q=-2). The same
core transfers to Cartesian atoms, automatically mapping canonical
rearrangements of a Ni(111) heptamer, underscoring the framework's generality.

### Spatial correlations in SIS processes on regular random graphs

- **Authors**: Alexander Leibenzon, Samuel W. S. Johnson, Ruth E. Baker, Michael Assaf
- **Categories**: cond-mat.stat-mech, physics.comp-ph, q-bio.PE
- **TL;DR**: 该论文针对网络SIS传染病模型，开发了一个考虑空间相关性的数学框架，改进了传统平均场理论在预测感染人数方面的不足。

In network-based SIS models of infectious disease transmission, infection can
only occur between directly connected individuals. This constraint naturally
gives rise to spatial correlations between the states of neighboring nodes, as
the infection status of connected individuals becomes interdependent. Although
mean-field approximations are commonly invoked to simplify disease forecasting
on networks, they fail to account for these correlations by assuming that
infectious individuals are well-mixed within a population, leading to
inaccurate predictions of infection numbers over time. As such, the development
of mathematical frameworks that account for spatially correlated infections is
of great interest, as they offer a compromise between accurate disease
forecasting and analytic tractability. Here, we use existing corrections to
mean-field theory on the regular lattice to construct a more general framework
for equivalent corrections on regular random graph topologies. We derive and
simulate a system of ordinary differential equations for the time evolution of
the spatial correlation function at various geodesic distances on random
networks, and use solutions to this hierarchy of ordinary differential
equations to predict the global infection density as a function of time,
finding good agreement with corresponding numerical simulations. Our results
constitute a substantial development on existing corrections to mean-field
theory for infectious individuals in SIS processes and provide an in-depth
characterization of how structural randomness in networks affects the dynamical
trajectories of infectious diseases on networks.

### The uniqueness of inverse scattering problems, reciprocity principles, and nonradiating sources related to low-signature structures

- **TL;DR**: 研究完美导电结构在电磁波照射下产生可忽略散射功率的特性，该结构具有可隐藏物体的空腔，在低可观测技术中有应用价值

This paper is about perfectly electrically conducting structures designed to
produce negligible scattered power when exposed to a time-harmonic plane
electromagnetic wave. The structures feature cavities capable of concealing
objects. Theoretical investigations of the properties of the structures
combined with accurate numerical computations lead to three key findings: the
first concerns the uniqueness of the solution to an inverse scattering problem,
the second establishes a reciprocity relation for the far-field scattering
amplitude, and the third reveals the existence of non-radiating sources that
generate substantial electromagnetic fields near the source region. The results
have applications in low-observable technology.

### Scalable Boltzmann Generators for equilibrium sampling of large-scale materials

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种可扩展的玻尔兹曼生成器架构，通过增强耦合流和图神经网络解决大系统采样问题，在材料科学中实现了前所未有的系统规模采样。

The use of generative models to sample equilibrium distributions of many-body
systems, as first demonstrated by Boltzmann Generators, has attracted
substantial interest due to their ability to produce unbiased and uncorrelated
samples in `one shot'. Despite their promise and impressive results across the
natural sciences, scaling these models to large systems remains a major
challenge. In this work, we introduce a Boltzmann Generator architecture that
addresses this scalability bottleneck with a focus on applications in materials
science. We leverage augmented coupling flows in combination with graph neural
networks to base the generation process on local environmental information,
while allowing for energy-based training and fast inference. Compared to
previous architectures, our model trains significantly faster, requires far
less computational resources, and achieves superior sampling efficiencies.
Crucially, the architecture is transferable to larger system sizes, which
allows for the efficient sampling of materials with simulation cells of
unprecedented size. We demonstrate the potential of our approach by applying it
to several materials systems, including Lennard-Jones crystals, ice phases of
mW water, and the phase diagram of silicon, for system sizes well above one
thousand atoms. The trained Boltzmann Generators produce highly accurate
equilibrium ensembles for various crystal structures, as well as Helmholtz and
Gibbs free energies across a range of system sizes, able to reach scales where
finite-size effects become negligible.

- **TL;DR**: TBPLaS 2.0是一个基于紧束缚传播方法的大规模模拟软件包，相比1.3版本在效率、功能和兼容性方面有显著提升，包括C++重写、GPU支持、新物理量计算等特性。

We introduce version 2.0 of TBPLaS, a package for large-scale simulation
based on the tight-binding propagation method (TBPM). This new version brings
significant improvements with many new features. Existing Python/Cython
modeling tools have been thoroughly optimized, and a compatible C++
implementation of the modeling tools is now available, offering efficiency
enhancement of several orders. The solvers have been rewritten in C++ from
scratch, with the efficiency enhanced by several times or even by an order. The
workflow of utilizing solvers has also been unified into a more comprehensive
and consistent manner. New features include spin texture, Berry curvature and
Chern number calculation, search of eigenvalues within a specific energy range,
analytical Hamiltonian, and GPU computing support. The documentation and
tutorials have also been updated to the new version. In this paper, we discuss
the revisions with respect to version 1.3 and demonstrate the new features.
Benchmarks on modeling tools and solvers are also provided.

### Non-Gaussian statistics of concentration fluctuations in free liquid diffusion

- **Authors**: Marco Bussoletti, Mirko Gallo, Amir Jafari, Gregory L. Eyink
- **Categories**: cond-mat.stat-mech, physics.flu-dyn
- **TL;DR**: 本文证明自由液体扩散中浓度波动的三点偏度非零，即使平均浓度梯度趋近于零。通过高施密特数简化的非线性Landau-Lifshitz流体动力学分析和大规模并行拉格朗日蒙特卡洛模拟，发现非高斯统计源于浓度波动与热速度波动的非线性耦合，类似于被动标量的湍流平流。浓度波动不服从中心极限定理，与宏观波动理论对一般扩散系统的预测相矛盾。

We show that the three-point skewness of concentration fluctuations is
non-vanishing in free liquid diffusion, even in the limit of vanishingly small
mean concentration gradients. We exploit a high-Schmidt reduction of nonlinear
Landau-Lifshitz hydrodynamics for a binary fluid, both analytically and by a
massively parallel Lagrangian Monte Carlo simulation. Non-Gaussian statistics
result from nonlinear coupling of concentration fluctuations to thermal
velocity fluctuations, analogous to the turbulent advection of a passive
scalar. Concentration fluctuations obey no central limit theorem, counter to
the predictions of macroscopic fluctuation theory for generic diffusive
systems.

### Method for backtracking the layer thermal conductivities of multilayer thin film structure using coupled Newton Raphson approach and 3-omega approach

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种结合3-omega实验和牛顿-拉弗森数值方法的新方法，用于反推多层薄膜结构中各层的导热系数。

The thermal conductivity of thin films is commonly estimated using the
3-omega experimental method. When calibrating the test setup, it is customary
to use a specimen with a known thermal conductivity for validation. However,
when determining the thermal conductivity of samples with unknown values,
numerical approximations can provide a means to validate experimental results
and ensure the integrity of the setup. A simple analytical or finite element
analysis (FEA) method can be used to achieve this. For multilayer systems of
unknown layer thermal conductivities, the 3-omega experimental setup only
provides information about the overall bulk thermal conductivity of the system.
To obtain the individual layer thermal conductivities, a combined experimental
and numerical approach can be used. This article presents a novel method for
backtracking the layer thermal conductivities of a multilayer thin film
structure using a coupled 3-omega experimental and Newton-Raphson numerical
approach. The method is validated using high-fidelity data obtained from
literature.

### Strong-coupling superconductivity near Gross-Neveu quantum criticality in Dirac systems

- **TL;DR**: 二维无质量狄拉克费米子在格罗斯-诺伊费临界点附近出现超导性，前提是费米子不再是明确定义的准粒子，即其正常态反常维度足够大。

We study two-dimensional massless Dirac fermions at neutrality, coupled to
bosonic modes through a Yukawa interaction. We then examine the intriguing
possibility that such a system, devoid of carriers at zero temperature, might
nevertheless exhibit superconductivity. Remarkably, we find that
superconductivity emerges in the vicinity of Gross-Neveu quantum criticality,
provided the fermions cease to behave as well-defined quasiparticles, that is,
once their anomalous dimension in the normal state becomes sufficiently large.
In other words, well-defined fermions do not superconduct, whereas ill-defined
ones do. We analyze four symmetry-distinct bosonic modes, each capable of
driving normal-state criticality and, in three of the four cases, giving rise
to a distinct superconducting phase. While phase fluctuations are strong in
this regime, we argue that they do not destroy the superconducting state. We
further characterize the resulting pairing states for a concrete Dirac model of
spin-orbit coupled systems with orbitals of different parity. Our results are
obtained using the SYK-inspired framework for Dirac systems introduced by Kim
et al.[1], which provides a controlled approach to the strongly coupled regime
of Dirac fluids near Gross-Neveu criticality.

- **TL;DR**: 本文研究了在1D CuO链中，使用Kondo-Zener双电子交换作用作为交换相互作用，描述金属-绝缘体转变。

Over twenty years ago Alexei Abrikosov [A.A. Abrikosov, Metal-insulator
transition in layered cuprates (SDW model), Physica C: Supercond. Vol. 391, 2,
147-159 (2003)] considered the Spin-Density-Waves (SDW) model for the
metal-insulator transition in layered cuprates. In one of those cuprates,
YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$, there are one-dimensional (1D) CuO chains of
copper and oxygen ions. In the present work we consider the metal-insulator
transition in the model case of a 1D CuO chain in the regime of half-filling of
the band. Our model is essentially the same, but as an exchange interaction
causing the metal-insulator transition, we consider Kondo-Zener two-electron
exchange, which successfully describes many of the electronic properties of the
layered cuprates.

### Mechanisms of Matter: Language Inferential Benchmark on Physicochemical Hypothesis in Materials Synthesis

- **TL;DR**: 提出了MatterMech基准测试，评估LLM在纳米材料合成领域的假设生成能力，发现LLM擅长抽象逻辑但缺乏物理化学原理基础，并提出原理感知提示方法显著提升性能。

The capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate valid scientific
hypotheses for materials synthesis remains largely unquantified, hindered by
the absence of benchmarks probing physicochemical logics reasoning. To address
this, we introduce MatterMech, a benchmark for evaluating LLM-generated
hypotheses across eight nanomaterial synthesis domains. Our analysis reveals a
critical disconnect: LLMs are proficient in abstract logic yet fail to ground
their reasoning in fundamental physicochemical principles. We demonstrate that
our proposed principle-aware prompting methodology substantially outperforms
standard Chain-of-Thought, enhancing both hypothesis accuracy and computational
efficiency. This work provides a methodological framework to advance LLMs
toward reliable scientific hypothesis generation in materials science. The
MatterMech benchmark and associated code is publicly available at

### Natural Excitation Framework for Defining the External Space: Uncontracted and Internally Contracted Multireference Nonorthogonal Wavefunction Theories

- **Categories**: physics.chem-ph
- **TL;DR**: 本文提出了基于自然激发框架的非正交方法，解决了非正交参考波函数构建外部空间时的内部污染和线性依赖问题。

In this communication, we examine new formalisms for the construction of the
external space when correlating reference wavefunctions built from
nonorthogonal determinant expansions. Defining the external space in
nonorthogonal approaches is challenging, as every substitution from the
reference wavefunction can potentially mix both internal and external
configurations. As a result, post-nonorthogonal methods are plagued by internal
contamination and linear dependencies in the external space, which may lead to
correlation double counting that results from overlap of the external and
reference spaces. Removal of these internal configurations and
orthonormalization of the excited space basis can be computationally expensive.
In particular, as the excitation operators cannot be subdivided by their action
on orbital subspaces, the external space cannot be partitioned into
non-overlapping subsets as is possible in orthogonal methods. To resolve these
issues, we propose both uncontracted and internally-contracted approaches based
on a natural excitation framework that allows for reduced scaling, more
straightforward separation of excitation types that lead to external and
internal spaces, and allows for a facile translation of orthogonal methods to a
nonorthogonal framework. Several proofs are provided to illustrate the
viability of the proposed approach, using a method-agnostic presentation to
highlight the generality of the approach.

### Topological non-Abelian Gauge Structures in Cayley-Schreier Lattices

- **TL;DR**: Cayley-Schreier晶格可实现非阿贝尔规范结构，将拓扑不变量与空间群对称性结合，为实验平台提供可实现的拓扑绝缘体和金属模型。

Recently, novel crystalline constructions known as Cayley-Schreier lattices
have been suggested as a platform for realizing arbitrary gauge fields in
synthetic crystals with real hopping amplitudes. We show that Cayley-Schreier
lattices can naturally give rise to implementable lattice systems that
incorporate non-Abelian gauge structures transforming into a space-group
symmetry. We show that the symmetry sectors can, moreover, be interpreted as
blocks of spin models that can effectively realize a wealth of different
topological invariants in a single setup. We underpin these general results
with concrete models and show how they can be implemented in current
experimental platforms. Our work sets the stage for a systematic investigation
of topological insulators and metals with non-Abelian gauge structures.

### Finite-Time Thermodynamics Perspective into Nuclear Power Plant Heat Cycle

- **TL;DR**: 本文从有限时间热力学角度重新审视核电站热力循环，发现在追求最大输出功率而非效率时，经典热力学方法存在不足。通过分析布雷顿循环和朗肯循环，揭示了输出功率与效率之间的权衡关系，并发现随着潜热增加，最大可达到的功率和效率都会提高。

Nuclear power plants are prominent examples of heat-to-work conversion
systems, and optimizing their thermodynamic performance offers significant
potential for enhancing energy efficiency. With a development history of less
than a century, optimization trends in nuclear power plants indicate that
classical thermodynamics alone may be insufficient, particularly when
maximizing output power rather than efficiency becomes the primary focus. This
paper re-examines nuclear power plant thermodynamic cycles through the lens of
finite-time thermodynamics, an approach specifically developed to address the
practical requirement of enhancing power output. Beginning with the simpler
Brayton cycle without phase transitions, we obtain the famous Curzon-Ahlborn
formula for efficiency at maximum power. Subsequently we analyze the more
complex Rankine cycle, which incorporates phase transitions. By explicitly
considering the working fluid undergoing phase transitions within the cycle, we
uncover the inherent trade-off between output power and efficiency.
Additionally, we demonstrate that both the maximum attainable power and
efficiency increase as latent heat rises. These findings shall provide insights
and methodologies for future thermodynamic optimization of nuclear power plants
and other Rankine-type cycle systems.

### The Sound of Electrons Shattering: Current Noise Composition Laws for Electron Fractionalization

- **TL;DR**: 该论文发展了金属系统在量子临界点附近非平衡电流响应的理论，特别是在电子准粒子发生分数化的系统中。通过Keldysh路径积分框架，推导了非微扰电流噪声组成定律，并证明总噪声是各分数化成分噪声的加权和。

We develop a theory of the non-equilibrium current response for metallic
systems near quantum critical points where electronic quasiparticles
fractionalize, such as systems near continuous metal-insulator transitions or
composite Fermi liquid to Fermi liquid transitions. Applying a generalized
response theory within a Keldysh path integral framework, we derive a
non-perturbative current noise composition law, wherein the total noise is the
sum of the noise of each fractionalized constituent (bosonic holons and
fermionic spinons), weighted by their respective resistivities. We demonstrate
that the formally derived composition relations can be interpreted in terms of
a simple analogy with resistors in series. We leverage this composition rule
near certain quantum critical points to show that the shot noise can be
suppressed in long nanowires as compared to Fermi liquid expectations due to
the collusion of quantum criticality with fractionalization.

- **TL;DR**: 双层镍酸盐La3Ni2O7是一种新型高温超导体，研究提出了微观哈密顿量模型，揭示了自旋条纹序和超导性的微观起源，强调了Hund耦合的关键作用。

The bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has emerged as a new high temperature
superconductor. We propose and study a microscopic Hamiltonian that addresses
the interplay of lattice structure and magnetism in this system. Using
state-of-the-art density matrix renormalization group calculations, we show
that $(\pi/2,\pi/2)$ spin stripe order emerges in our model and exhibits a
hidden quasi-one dimensionality. The spin stripe order occurs over a range of
electron concentrations, but requires a sizable Hund's coupling $J_H$. Our
model exhibits superconducting tendency only when the interlayer
antiferromagnetic coupling $J_\bot$ becomes sufficiently large, which naturally
occurs under pressure. Our study unveils the microscopic origin of both the
unusual spin stripes and superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, and highlights
the indispensable role of Hund's coupling $J_H$ in this system.

### High-efficiency Pt$_{75}$Au$_{25}$-based spintronic terahertz emitters

Spintronic terahertz emitters (STEs) generate broadband THz radiation via
ultrafast spin-charge conversion in magnetic multilayers, offering spectral
coverage beyond that of photoconductive antennas and nonlinear optical
crystals. Here, we demonstrate a new type of STE based on PtxAu100-x alloy that
achieves significantly higher THz output power than widely used Pt-based
devices. Alloy composition and layer thickness tuning yield Pt75Au25 as the
optimal alloy providing a 30 % increase in THz power in CoFeB/Pt75Au25 bilayer
STEs compared to the optimized CoFeB/Pt reference STE. In
W/CoFeB/Pt$_{75}$Au$_{25}$ trilayer STEs, we observe a 10 % higher THz power
than in the optimized W/CoFeB/Pt trilayer. The STE efficiency is reduced upon
annealing for both Pt$_{75}$Au$_{25}$- and Pt-based STEs due to formation of
interfacial alloys. Our results establish Pt$_{75}$Au$_{25}$ as a promising
platform for high-performance STEs, where its giant spin Hall effect
significantly enhances efficiency over conventional Pt-based devices.

### Towards A Universally Transferable Acceleration Method for Density Functional Theory

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种通过预测电子密度来构建DFT初始猜测的方法，使用E(3)-等变神经网络在紧凑辅助基表示中预测电子密度，显著减少SCF迭代步骤。

Recently, sophisticated deep learning-based approaches have been developed
for generating efficient initial guesses to accelerate the convergence of
density functional theory (DFT) calculations. While the actual initial guesses
are often density matrices (DM), quantities that can convert into density
matrices also qualify as alternative forms of initial guesses. Hence, existing
works mostly rely on the prediction of the Hamiltonian matrix for obtaining
high-quality initial guesses. However, the Hamiltonian matrix is both
numerically difficult to predict and intrinsically non-transferable, hindering
the application of such models in real scenarios. In light of this, we propose
a method that constructs DFT initial guesses by predicting the electron density
in a compact auxiliary basis representation using E(3)-equivariant neural
networks. Trained on small molecules with up to 20 atoms, our model is able to
achieve an average 33.3% self-consistent field (SCF) step reduction on systems
up to 60 atoms, substantially outperforming Hamiltonian-centric and DM-centric
models. Critically, this acceleration remains nearly constant with increasing
system sizes and exhibits strong transferring behaviors across orbital basis
sets and exchange-correlation (XC) functionals. To the best of our knowledge,
this work represents the first and robust candidate for a universally
transferable DFT acceleration method. We are also releasing the SCFbench
dataset and its accompanying code to facilitate future research in this
promising direction.

We demonstrate that in an ideal Weyl semimetal, in which the Fermi energy
coincides with the band-touching nodes, weak direct inter-nodal scattering is
irrelevant and, as a result, the chiral charge is (almost) exactly conserved.
This leads to an experimentally-observable effect: in an applied magnetic
field, the charge transport along the field becomes purely ballistic, with the
conductance given by $e^2/h$ per magnetic flux quantum through the sample
cross-section. This is the strongest experimental manifestation of nontrivial
topology in Weyl and Dirac semimetals.

- **Categories**: cond-mat.stat-mech
- **TL;DR**: 提出了两种计算开放量子系统中首次通过时间统计大偏差的方法：第一种基于极点方程分析，第二种基于波函数克隆算法的模拟方法。

We propose two methods for computing the large deviations of the
first-passage-time statistics in general open quantum systems. The first method
determines the region of convergence of the joint Laplace transform and the
$z$-transform of the first-passage time distribution by solving an equation of
poles with respect to the $z$-transform parameter. The scaled cumulant
generating function is then obtained as the logarithm of the boundary values
within this region. The theoretical basis lies in the facts that the dynamics
of the open quantum systems can be unraveled into a piecewise deterministic
process and there exists a tilted Liouville master equation in Hilbert space.
The second method uses a simulation-based approach built on the wave function
cloning algorithm. To validate both methods, we derive analytical expressions
for the scaled cumulant generating functions in field-driven two-level and
three-level systems. In addition, we present numerical results alongside
cloning simulations for a field-driven system comprising two interacting
two-level atoms.

- **TL;DR**: 研究发现，在量子化学领域，仅通过扩大模型容量和训练数据无法可靠预测H₂分子的键解离能，即使最大的基础模型也无法重现基本库仑定律。

Neural scaling laws are driving the machine learning community toward
training ever-larger foundation models across domains, assuring high accuracy
and transferable representations for extrapolative tasks. We test this promise
in quantum chemistry by scaling model capacity and training data from quantum
chemical calculations. As a generalization task, we evaluate the resulting
models' predictions of the bond dissociation energy of neutral H$_2$, the
simplest possible molecule. We find that, regardless of dataset size or model
capacity, models trained only on stable structures fail dramatically to even
qualitatively reproduce the H$_2$ energy curve. Only when compressed and
stretched geometries are explicitly included in training do the predictions
roughly resemble the correct shape. Nonetheless, the largest foundation models
trained on the largest and most diverse datasets containing dissociating
diatomics exhibit serious failures on simple diatomic molecules. Most
strikingly, they cannot reproduce the trivial repulsive energy curve of two
bare protons, revealing their failure to learn the basic Coulomb's law involved
in electronic structure theory. These results suggest that scaling alone is
insufficient for building reliable quantum chemical models.

### Probing phase transitions in non-Hermitian systems with quantum entanglement

We study the quantum entanglement and quantum phase transition of the
non-Hermitian anisotropic spin-1/2 XY model and XXZ model with the staggered
imaginary field by analytical methods and numerical exact diagonalization,
respectively. Various entanglement measures, including concurrence, negativity,
mutual information, and quantum coherence, and both biorthogonal and
self-normal quantities are investigated. Both the biorthogonal and self-normal
entanglement quantities, except the biorthogonal concurrence, are found to be
capable of detecting the first-order and $\mathcal{PT}$ transitions in the XXZ
model, as well as the Ising and $\mathcal{RT}$ transitions in the XY model. In
addition, we introduce the unconstrained concurrence and demonstrate its
effectiveness in detecting these transitions. On the other hand, the
Beresinskii-Kosterlitz-Thoules (BKT) transition in the XXZ model is revealed
through concurrence and negativity at small non-Hermiticity strengths. Notably,
the critical points observed in the Hermitian limit evolve into exceptional
points as the strength of the non-Hermiticity increases. Furthermore, we find
that the first-order transition survives up to a higher non-Hermiticity
strength compared to the BKT transition within the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric
regime of the XXZ model.

Electropolishing is the premier surface preparation method for high-Q,
high-gradient superconducting RF cavities made of Nb. This leaves behind an
apparently smooth surface, yet the achievable peak magnetic fields fall well
below the superheating field of Nb, in most cases. In this work, the ultimate
surface finish of electropolishing was investigated by studying its effect on
highly polished Nb samples. Electropolishing introduces high slope angle
sloped-steps at grain boundaries. The magnetic field enhancement and
superheating field suppression factors associated with such a geometry are
calculated in the London theory. Despite the by-eye smoothness of
electropolished Nb, such defects compromise the stability of the low-loss
Meissner state, likely limiting the achievable peak accelerating fields in
superconducting RF cavities. Finally, the impact of surface roughness on
impurity diffusion is investigated which can link surface roughness to the
effectiveness of heat treatments like low-temperature baking or nitrogen
infusion in the vortex nucleation or hydride hypotheses. Surface roughness
tends to decrease the effective dose of impurities as a result of the expansion
of impurities into regions with greater internal angle. The effective dose of
impurities can be protected by minimizing slope angles and step heights,
ensuring uniformity.

Conventional metals, insulators, and semimetals are constrained by
fundamental limitations in terms of their thermoelectric performance.
Topological materials offer certain features that allow them to circumvent
these constraints, and potentially to form the basis for thermoelectric devices
with unprecedented efficiency. In this article we review the thermoelectric
performance of topological materials, focusing specifically on nodal
semimetals, such as Weyl and nodal-line semimetals. We discuss how certain
unique ``topological'' features of these materials -- namely their
topologically protected band touching points, electron-hole degenerate lowest
Landau level, and Berry curvature -- allow them to exhibit thermoelectric
properties that go beyond what is possible in conventional materials,
particularly in the presence of an applied magnetic field. We focus our
discussion on the goal of achieving large figure of merit $zT$, and for each
material class we summarize optimal \emph{design principles} for selecting
materials that maximize thermoelectric efficiency.
  We then use these optimal design principles to design and implement a
high-throughput database search for topological semimetals that are promising
as thermoelectrics. In addition to highlighting a number of materials that are
already known to have large magnetothermoelectric effects, our search uncovers
twelve additional materials that are especially promising for near-future
experiments.

### Scalable Reactive Atomistic Dynamics with GAIA

- **TL;DR**: GAIA是一个端到端框架，用于自动构建机器学习原子间势能(MLIPs)的训练数据集，通过元动力学进行有效结构探索，克服传统数据集生成的启发式限制。

The groundbreaking advance in materials and chemical research has been driven
by the development of atomistic simulations. However, the broader applicability
of the atomistic simulations remains restricted, as they inherently depend on
energy models that are either inaccurate or computationally prohibitive.
Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have recently emerged as a
promising class of energy models, but their deployment remains challenging due
to the lack of systematic protocols for generating diverse training data. Here
we automate the construction of training datasets to enable the development of
general-purpose MLIPs, by introducing GAIA, an end-to-end framework to build a
wide range of atomic arrangements. By employing systematic evaluation of
metadynamics for effective structural exploration, GAIA overcomes the heuristic
nature of conventional dataset generation. Using GAIA, we constructed Titan25,
a benchmark-scale dataset, and trained MLIPs that closely match both static and
dynamic density functional theory results. The models further reproduce
experimental observations across reactive regimes, including detonation,
coalescence, and catalytic activity. GAIA narrows the gap between experiment
and simulation, and paves the way for the development of universal MLIPs that
can reliably describe a wide spectrum of materials and chemical processes.

### Quantum geometric origins of the orbital degrees of freedom of hybrid bosonic quasiparticles in magnetic systems

The orbital degree of freedom has recently attracted significant attention
due to the novel phenomena it enables in condensed matter systems. However, the
interpretation of the orbital degree of freedom in bosonic quasiparticles
remains conceptually ambiguous and the mechanisms governing the transfer of
orbital angular moment (OAM) between distinct quasiparticles, such as magnons
and phonons, are not yet fully understood. We investigate orbital dynamics in
bosonic systems and identify two origins of OAM: (i) global rotational motion
of the system, and (ii) the quantum geometry of wavefunctions. Focusing on the
latter, we study strongly coupled magnon-phonon systems in two-dimensional
antiferromagnets as a test case. We uncover finite OAM arising from quantum
geometric effects via two mechanisms: (a) time-parity symmetry breaking,
yielding intra band OAM, and (b) interband coupling, generating interband OAM.
We propose that an electrical detection scheme based on the transverse voltage
generated by hybrid magnon phonon modes can be used to experimentally probe the
bosonic orbital degree of freedom. Our results establish a foundation for the
emerging field of phonon orbitronics, providing both a conceptual bridge
between phonon and magnon orbitronics and a tool for better understanding
magnon-polarons. They also advance a unified framework for harnessing orbital
degrees of freedom in bosonic systems and pave the way toward electrical
control of magnetization and phononic transport.

An exact and complete solution of the ground-state problem for the classical
Heisenberg and XY models with nearest-neighbor bilinear-biquadratic exchange on
two- and three-dimensional lattices composed of isosceles triangles is
determined with the use of a cluster method. It is shown how the geometric
frustration due to the presence of triangles as structural units leads to the
emergence of a rich phase diagram with incommensurate spiral orderings and
their collinear limits, as well as canted and noncoplanar (conical) structures.
Surprisingly, there are two different spiral phases with both continuous and
discontinuous phase transitions between them. One of these phases is degenerate
on two-dimensional partially anisotropic triangular lattice. This degeneracy is
lifted on three-dimensional lattices. Canted phase is highly degenerate and
this degeneracy persists on three-dimensional lattices.

### Schwinger boson theory for $S=1$ Kitaev quantum spin liquids

The Kitaev model is an exactly solvable model with a quantum spin liquid
ground state. While this model was originally proposed as an $S=1/2$ spin model
on a honeycomb lattice, extensions to higher-spin systems have recently
attracted attention. In contrast to the $S=1/2$ case, such higher-$S$ models
are not exactly solvable and remain poorly understood, particularly for spin
excitations at finite temperatures. Here, we focus on the $S=1$ Kitaev model,
which is proposed to host bosonic quasiparticles. We investigate this model
using Schwinger boson mean-field theory, introducing bosonic spinons as
fractional quasiparticles by extending bond operators to address anisotropic
spin interactions. We determine the mean-field parameters that realize a
quantum spin liquid in both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic Kitaev models.
Based on this ansatz, we calculate dynamical and equal-time spin structure
factors. We find that the conventional scheme based on Wick decoupling with
respect to spinons yields unphysical momentum dependence: it produces strong
spectral weight indicating ferromagnetic (antiferromagnetic) correlations in
the antiferromagnetic (ferromagnetic) Kitaev model. To resolve this issue, we
propose an alternative evaluation based on decoupling with respect to bond
operators. We demonstrate that, in our scheme, such unphysical behavior
disappears and the momentum dependence of the spin structure factors is
consistent with the sign of the exchange constant. We also compute the
temperature evolution of the dynamical spin structure factor and find that the
zero-temperature continuum splits into two distinct structures as temperature
increases, which can be understood in terms of the bandwidth narrowing of
spinons. Finally, we clarify why the two decoupling schemes result in different
momentum dependences and discuss their relationship to previous studies.

### Effect of Deposition Pressure on the Superconductivity of Ti40V60 Alloy Thin Films

The growth and characterization of high quality superconducting thin films is
essential for fundamental understanding and also for the use of these films in
technological applications. In the present study, Ti40V60 alloy thin films have
been deposited using DC magnetron co sputtering of Ti and V at ambient
temperatures. The effect of deposition pressure on the film morphology,
superconducting and normal state properties has been studied. Measurement of
electrical resistance as a function of temperature indicates that up to a
certain deposition pressure, the 20 nm thick Ti40V60 films exhibit metallic
behavior in the normal state and superconductivity at low temperatures. Beyond
a threshold pressure, the films show a negative temperature coefficient of
resistance with a residual resistance ratio less than one. Electrical transport
measurements in the presence of magnetic field were performed to find the
current voltage characteristics of the thin films. Analysis of the I V curves
indicates that the Ti40V60 alloy thin films have a large transport critical
current density (JC) e.g. 1.475E10 A per m2 in zero magnetic field and 2.657E09
A per m2 in 4 T (both at 4 K). Analysis of the field dependence of flux line
pinning force density indicates a combined effect of core delta k surface and
core delta k point pinning mechanisms (where k is the Ginzburg Landau
parameter). Additionally, spatial variations in the superconducting critical
temperature (TC ) across the sample contribute to delta TC pinning. In higher
magnetic fields, a contribution from delta l pinning (where l is the electron
mean free path) also becomes significant. The findings indicate the potential
of Ti40V60 alloy thin film for superconducting device applications like
cryogenic radiation detectors.

In this work, we develop an atomistic, graph-based kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC)
simulation routine to predict crystal morphology. Within this routine, we
encode the state of the supercell in a binary occupation vector and the
topology of the supercell in a simple nearest-neighbor graph. From this
encoding, we efficiently compute the interaction energy of the system as a
quadratic form of the binary occupation vector, representing pairwise
interactions. This encoding, coupled with a simple diffusion model for
adsorption, is then used to model evaporation and adsorption dynamics at
solid-liquid interfaces. The resulting intermolecular interaction-breaking
energies are incorporated into a kinetic model to predict crystal morphology,
which is implemented in the open-source Python package Crystal Growth Kinetic
Monte Carlo (cgkmc). We then apply this routine to pentaerythritol tetranitrate
(PETN), an important energetic material, showing excellent agreement with the
attachment energy model.

The multimode Brownian model with nonlinear system-bath coupling offers a
flexible framework for studying both intra- and intermolecular vibrational
modes in condensed-phase molecular systems. This approach allows us to
calculate linear and nonlinear spectra of molecular vibrations and to examine
thermal effects-such as anharmonicity, energy relaxation, and dephasing-as
reflected in the spectral peak profiles. In this study, we present a computer
program based on classical hierarchical Fokker-Planck equations applied to
three vibrational modes of a molecular liquid. The primary objective of
developing this code was to simulate the two-dimensional correlation spectrum
of the intramolecular modes of liquid water. [R. Hoshino and Y. Tanimura, J.
Chem. Phys. 162, 044105 (2025)]. The code has been further refined to optimize
grid selection and numerical integration routines for graphics processing units
(GPUs). As a demonstration, we apply this setup to simulate three interacting
modes representing intermolecular vibrations in water, and calculate the
resulting two-dimensional terahertz-Raman signals. The code and example
routines are available in the supplementary material.

### Electric-field control of pure spin photocurrent in germanene

The electrical control of pure spin current remains a central challenge in
spintronics, particularly in time-reversal symmetric systems composed of
nonmagnetic elements, where spin and electric fields interact only indirectly.
In this work, we develop a theoretical framework for electrically tuning pure
spin photocurrent in two-dimensional materials with time-reversal symmetry via
a gate electric field. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that in
systems with spin-orbit coupling and in-plane mirror symmetry, an out-of-plane
electric field induces spin splitting and reversal in the band structure near
the Fermi energy, enabling magnitude control and direction reversal of the pure
spin photocurrent. To validate this mechanism, we perform first-principles
calculations on germanene, an experimentally realized two-dimensional material.
Beyond amplitude modulation, we reveal that reversing the direction of the
applied electric field leads to a corresponding reversal of the pure spin
photocurrent. Furthermore, we show that the pure spin photocurrent can be tuned
by varying the photon energy and the incident angle of light, providing
additional degrees of control over spin transport. These findings establish a
robust strategy for electric-field-controlled pure spin transport in
two-dimensional materials, offering new possibilities for the development of
optospintronic devices.

### Comparative study of Wavelet transform and Fourier domain filtering for medical image denoising

Denoising of images is a crucial preprocessing step in medical imaging,
essential for improving diagnostic clarity. While deep learning methods offer
state-of-the-art performance, their computational complexity and data
requirements can be prohibitive. In this study we present a comprehensive
comparative analysis of two classical, computationally efficient
transform-domain techniques: Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and Discrete
Fourier Cosine Transform (DFCT) filtering. We evaluated their efficacy in
denoising medical images which corrupted by Gaussian, Uniform, Poisson, and
Salt-and-Pepper noise. Contrary to the common hypothesis favoring wavelets for
their multi-resolution capabilities, our results demonstrate that a block-based
DFCT approach consistently and significantly outperforms a global DWT approach
across all noise types and performance metrics (SNR, PSNR, IM). We attribute
DFCT's superior performance to its localized processing strategy, which better
preserves fine details by operating on small image blocks, effectively adapting
to local statistics without introducing global artifacts. This finding
underscores the importance of algorithmic selection based on processing
methodology, not just transform properties, and positions DFCT as a highly
effective and efficient denoising tool for practical medical imaging
applications.

### Anisotropic antiferromagnetic order in EuPd$_3$Si$_2$

Single crystals of EuPd$_3$Si$_2$ were grown using a high-temperature
EuPd-flux method. The material was structurally and chemically characterized by
single-crystal x-ray diffraction, powder x-ray diffraction, Laue method and
energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy. The structural analysis confirmed the
orthorhombic crystal structure (space group $Imma$) but revealed differences in
the lattice parameters and bond distances in comparison to previous work by
Sharma et al.. The composition is close to the ideal 1:3:2 stoichiometry with
an occupation of 7 % of the Si sites by Pd. The heat capacity, electrical
resistivity, and magnetic susceptibility show two magnetic transitions
indicating antiferromagnetic ordering below $T_{\rm N1}= 61\,\rm K$ and a spin
reorientation at $T_{\rm N2}= 40\,\rm K$. The orthorhombic material shows
magnetic anisotropy with field applied along the three main symmetry axes,
which is summarized in the temperature-field phase diagrams. The susceptibility
data hint to an alignment of the magnetic moments along $[100]$ between $T_{\rm
N1}$ and $T_{\rm N2}$. Below $T_{\rm N2}$ the magnetic structure changes to an
arrangement with moments canted away from $[100]$. In contrast to published
work by Sharma et al., the single crystals investigated in this study show AFM
order below $T_{\rm N1}$ instead of ferromagnetism that sets in at higher
$T_{\rm C1}=78\,\rm K$ which might originate from certain differences in the
structure, composition or defects that have an impact on the dominant coupling
constants of the RKKY interaction.

Amorphous thin film superconductors are promising alternatives for the
development of superconducting radiation detectors, especially superconducting
nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPDs) and superconducting microwire single
photon detectors (SWSPDs), due to their homogeneous nature, ease of deposition,
and superconducting parameters comparable to the materials currently being
used. A study on the optimization of the growth technology and superconducting
transition temperature (TC) of MoSi thin films grown on SiO2 coated Si
substrate is reported here. These films have been synthesized by co sputtering
of Mo and Si targets with varying compositions and thicknesses to achieve
optimized TC values close to that of the bulk. Mo80Si20 and Mo83Si17
compositions of the film, each with a thickness of 17 nm, exhibited the highest
TC of 6.4 K and 5.9 K, respectively. Additionally, a meander structure with a
17 um wire width was patterned to estimate the transport critical current

TC with film thickness and deposition pressure has been studied. Electrical
resistance as a function of temperature of the film before and after meandering

The Edelstein effect consists of the non-equilibrium accumulation of
magnetization in response to an applied electric field in systems with broken
inversion symmetry. While the spin Edelstein effect (SEE), originating from
spin moments, is well established, its orbital counterpart, where magnetization
arises from orbital moment, has only recently begun to attract attention. In
this work, we investigate the orbital Edelstein effect (OEE) in gated monolayer
transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), such as MoS2, by using
first-principles density-functional calculations with both electron and hole
doping. The gate-induced broken mirror symmetry produces a Rashba-type chiral
spin/orbital angular momentum texture, which in turn leads to the Edelstein
effect in response to an applied in-plane electric field. We find that for
electron doping the Edelstein response is dominated by the orbital channel,
whereas for hole doping the orbital and spin contributions are comparable. For
the case of hole doping, both OEE and SEE are strongly enhanced by a small
amount of strain, due to strain-driven shifts between the Gamma and K/K' valley
energies. We derive analytical expressions for the spin and orbital Edelstein
susceptibilities and evaluate their magnitudes from first-principles.
Remarkably, the predicted OEE in gated monolayer TMDs is an order of magnitude
larger than values reported in previously studied systems. Our results identify
TMDs as promising platforms for studying the orbital Edelstein effect and
highlight their potential applications in spintronics devices.

- **TL;DR**: 开发了GW+C多体微扰理论框架，用于准确预测大分子系统中的shake-up卫星峰，在170原子以下的卟啉衍生物中与实验吻合良好。

In X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), shake-up satellites arise when
core ionization is accompanied by simultaneous charge-neutral valence
excitations. Although these satellites can contain detailed structural
information, they are rarely interpreted due to the lack of accurate and
scalable theoretical methods. Here, we develop and apply a many-body
perturbation theory framework within the $GW$ plus cumulant ($GW+C$) approach
that enables accurate predictions of shake-up satellites in large molecular
systems. For unfused, mono-fused, and doubly fused porphyrin derivatives with
up to 170 atoms, we achieve excellent agreement with experiment, reproducing
both main photoionization signals and satellite features within $0.2-0.3$ eV.
We show that ring fusion strongly affects satellite features, whereas the N 1s
photoionization signals remain unchanged. Our calculations reveal the mechanism
behind these changes, identifying the spatial localization of valence
excitations as the driving force. This work not only deepens understanding of
the shake-up mechanism in porphyrins but also shows how predictive computations
can unlock the chemical information encoded in satellites.

Ultra-small Josephson junctions are strongly influenced by noise and damping
due to energy dissipation into the environment, which are expected to suppress
phase coherence. Here, we investigate the coherence properties of atomic-scale
Josephson junctions in a scanning tunneling microscope under microwave
excitation. Plain Pb-Pb junctions exhibit hysteretic Shapiro steps as signature
of a coherent resonant state. With increasing AC amplitude, phase coherence is
reduced due to an increase of thermal fluctuations. In the presence of magnetic
adatoms the Josephson coupling energy is reduced and quasi-particle tunneling
is enhanced. With AC driving we observe a rapid suppression of coherence that
we ascribe to photon-assisted quasi-particle tunneling through Yu-Shiba-Rusinov
states. Our results highlight the presence of phase coherence and shed light on
the origin of the transition to incoherent transport, thereby revealing the
importance of controlling dissipation in nanoscale superconducting devices.

### Symmetry restoration in a fast scrambling system

- **TL;DR**: 本文通过纠缠不对称性研究cSYK模型中的对称性恢复和热化过程，发现了量子Mpemba效应和有限尺寸效应的影响。

Entanglement asymmetry -- used here as a direct probe of symmetry restoration
-- provides a sharp diagnostic of post-quench dynamics. We test this idea in
the complex Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev (cSYK) model with a conserved U(1) charge.
Using exact diagonalization, we track the joint evolution of entanglement
entropy and entanglement asymmetry after quenches from charge-asymmetric
product states. We find rapid volume-law entanglement growth consistent with
the subsystem eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, accompanied by a concurrent
decay of entanglement asymmetry to a late-time plateau set by finite-size
effects: small subsystems display near-complete restoration, while residual
cross-sector weight yields a finite plateau. Notably, we uncover a quantum
Mpemba effect: states prepared further from symmetry relax faster and approach
lower residual asymmetry; disorder in the couplings renders this behavior more
robust and monotonic across parameters. We further derive a Pinsker-type lower
bound that ties the decay of asymmetry to differences in subsystem purity,
identifying dephasing between U(1) charge sectors as the operative mechanism.
These results establish entanglement asymmetry as a sensitive probe of symmetry
restoration and thermalization, clarifying finite-size limits in
fast-scrambling, closed quantum systems.

### Spin-supersolidity induced quantum criticality and magnetocaloric effect in the triangular-lattice antiferromagnet Rb$_2$Co(SeO$_3$)$_2$

We performed high-field magnetization, magnetocaloric effect (MCE), and NMR
measurements on the Ising triangular-lattice antiferromagnet
Rb$_2$Co(SeO$_3$)$_2$. The observations of the 1/3-magnetization plateau, the
split NMR lines, and the thermal activation behaviors of the spin-lattice
relaxation rate $1/T_1$ between 2 T and 15.8 T provide unambiguous evidence of
a gapped up-up-down (UUD) magnetic ordered phase. For fields between 15.8 T and
18.5 T, the anomaly in the magnetic susceptibility, the slow saturation of the
NMR line spectral ratio with temperature, and the power-law temperature
dependence of $1/T_1$ suggest the ground state to be a spin supersolid with
gapless spin excitations. With further increasing the field, the Gr\"{u}neisen
ratio, extracted from the MCE data, reveals a continuous quantum phase
transition at $H_{\rm C}\approx$ 19.5 T and a universal quantum critical
scaling with the exponents ${\nu}z~\approx~$1. Near $H_{\rm C}$, the large
high-temperature MCE signal and the broad peaks in the NMR Knight shift and
$1/T_1$, manifest the strong spin fluctuations driven by both magnetic
frustration and quantum criticality. These results establish
Rb$_2$Co(SeO$_3$)$_2$ as a candidate platform for cryogenic magnetocaloric
cooling.

We theoretically investigate the superconducting gap structures in wallpaper
fermions, which are surface states of topological nonsymmorphic crystalline
insulators, based on a two-dimensional effective model. A symmetry analysis
identifies six types of momentum-independent pair potentials. One hosts a point
node, two host line nodes, and the remaining three are fully gapped. By
classifying the Bogoliubov--de Gennes Hamiltonian in the zero-dimensional
symmetry class, we show that the point and line nodes are protected by
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariants. In addition, for the
twofold-rotation-odd pair potential, nodes appear on the glide-invariant line
and are protected by crystalline symmetries, as clarified by the
Mackey--Bradley theorem.

This study examines lithium distribution and its evolution in both anode and
cathode materials of commercial lithium-ion coin cells subjected to high C-rate
cycling, providing insights into lithium loss, trapping, and plating
mechanisms. Cells were cycled at 1C to 3C rates, and post-mortem analysis were
performed using Li nuclear reaction Analysis (Li-NRA), x-ray diffraction (XRD),
and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) equipped with energy-dispersive x-ray
spectroscopy (EDS). Li-NRA using the resonant nuclear reaction between an
incident high-energy proton and lithium was used to measure the depth
distribution of Li in the cathode and anode layers. The Li-NRA analysis
revealed a surface lithium peak on the anode, likely associated with SEI
formation and lithium plating, while the cathode exhibited a decrease in
lithium content by ~19.7%. XRD analysis of the cathode showed a contraction of
the c-lattice parameter and peak shifts consistent with lithium depletion and
structural deformation, supported by SEM imaging. In contrast, the dead
graphite anode shows an enhanced peak at 43.3{\deg}, which corresponds to the
presence of metallic lithium or possibly Cu. 3-C rate cycling also led to
capacity fade and an increase in internal resistance, highlighting the impact
of lithium plating on cell performance.

Much attention has been devoted to the use of machine learning to approximate
physical concepts. Yet, due to challenges in interpretability of machine
learning techniques, the question of what physics machine learning models are
able to learn remains open. Here we bridge the concept a physical quantity and
its machine learning approximation in the context of the original application
of neural networks in physics: topological phase classification. We construct a
hybrid tensor-neural network object that exactly expresses real space
topological invariant and rigorously assess its trainability and
generalization. Specifically, we benchmark the accuracy and trainability of a
tensor-neural network to multiple types of neural networks, thus exemplifying
the differences in trainability and representational power. Our work highlights
the challenges in learning topological invariants and constitutes a stepping
stone towards more accurate and better generalizable machine learning
representations in condensed matter physics.

### Half-filled metal and molecular-orbital-mediated pairing in cuprate

- **TL;DR**: 该论文提出铜酸盐中掺杂空穴形成局域电子分子（4a0格子），每个格子包含约两个空穴，恢复半填充金属态，解释了费米面结构和超导机制。

The cuprates exhibit anomalous momentum-space structure with antinodal gap
and nodal arc in the underdoped regime, which evolves into a complete hole-type
Fermi surface with a large Luttinger volume in the overdoped regime. The
real-space electronic structure is also quite complex, as characterized by
microscopic inhomogeneities and intertwined density wave orders. Here we show
that doped holes in cuprate form localized electronic molecules consisting of
4a0 plaquettes, and each plaquette contains approximately two holes. The
effective local doping level is thus around 1/8, which is sufficient to destroy
the underlying AF order and more importantly, recovers the half-filled metallic
state of the original CuO2 plane. The restored Fermi surface, hosting one hole
per unit cell, is consistent with experimental results and satisfies the
Luttinger theorem. We then construct the momentum-space structure of the
half-filled metal by considering the real-space configuration of electronic
molecules. We show that the electronic potential with 4a0 periodicity imposed
by the plaquettes and the quantum size effect of electronic molecules
obliterate the nested antinodal Fermi surface sheets, leaving behind short arcs
with coherent quasiparticles around the node. We propose that two doped holes
in each plaquette occupy the shared molecular orbital and form a spin singlet,
which can mediate the pairing of itinerant holes on the remnant Fermi surface
of the half-filled metal. The electric dipole moment between the molecular
orbitals and the dopant ions may also provide a novel attractive interaction
between itinerant holes. This phenomenological model for pair formation between
itinerant holes on the half-filled Fermi surface mediated by localized
molecular orbitals resolves several core issues concerning the mechanism of
superconductivity in cuprates.

Artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted workflows have transformed materials
discovery, enabling rapid exploration of chemical spaces of functional
materials. Endowed with extraordinary optoelectronic properties,
two-dimensional (2D) hybrid perovskites represent an exciting frontier, but
current efforts to design 2D perovskites rely heavily on trial-and-error and
expert intuition approaches, leaving most of the chemical space unexplored and
compromising the design of hybrid materials with desired properties. Here, we
introduce an inverse design workflow for Dion-Jacobson perovskites that is
built on an invertible fingerprint representation for millions of conjugated
diammonium organic spacers. By incorporating high-throughput density functional
theory (DFT) calculations, interpretable machine learning, and synthesis
feasibility screening, we identified new organic spacer candidates with
deterministic energy level alignment between the organic and the inorganic
motifs in the 2D hybrid perovskites. These results highlight the power of
integrating invertible, physically meaningful molecular representations into
AI-assisted design, streamlining the property-targeted design of hybrid
materials.

computational investigation of PV sensitivity in its vibrational spectrum.
Pt(Me-BPCH) is compared to other two derivatives of this complex, Au(Me-BPCH)
and Pt(CF$_3$-BPCH) in terms of their PV response and suitability for
measurement. We identify the most promising vibrational transitions based on
their enhanced PV effects and practical experimental considerations and analyze
the relationship between the vibrational structure and the corresponding PV
sensitivity for all three molecules.

### Néel vector and Rashba SOC effects on RKKY interaction in 2D $d$-wave altermagnets

Altermagnets possess two key features: non-relativistic alternating spin
splitting (i.e., altermagnetism) and a material-dependent N\'{e}el vector. The
former naturally coexists with Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in real
materials on substrates, prompting the question of how SOC affects the magnetic
properties of altermagnets. The latter is crucial for information storage,
making it essential to determine its orientation. To address these issues, we
study the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction in two-dimensional
(2D) $d$-wave altermagnets by independently varying the N\'{e}el vector
orientation and the SOC strength. Our results demonstrate that the N\'{e}el
vector orientation can be accurately determined via the Ising term without SOC,
or qualitatively inferred via the DM terms with SOC. Moreover, we observe a
novel Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) component distinct from previous reports,
whose emergence is attributed to the synergy between altermagnetism and SOC.
Additionally, through tuning SOC strength, we reveal the evolution of the RKKY
spin models governed by five distinct mechanisms: the spin model may be
determined solely by altermagnetism, solely by SOC, or solely by the kinetic
term; alternatively, altermagnetism may coincidentally yield the same
moderately anisotropic spin model as SOC, or compete with SOC to produce a spin
model with maximal anisotropy. Beyond SOC strength, which mechanism operates
also relies on the N\'{e}el vector orientation and impurity configurations. All
results are numerically verified. These findings -- which were inaccessible in
prior studies due to the limitations of first-order SOC expansion and fixed
N\'{e}el vector orientation -- provide important new insights into the magnetic
properties of altermagnets.

### Magnetic phase transitions protected by topological quantum geometry transitions: effects of electron-electron interactions in the Creutz ladder system

The interplay between electronic correlations and band topology is a central
theme in modern condensed matter physics. In this work, we investigate the
effects of on-site Hubbard interactions on the topological, magnetic, and
quantum geometric properties of the Creutz ladder, a paradigmatic model of a
one-dimensional topological insulator. Using a self-consistent mean-field
approach, we uncover a first-order, interaction-driven phase transition that is
simultaneously magnetic and topological. We demonstrate that as the Hubbard
interaction $U$ is increased, the system's ground state abruptly switches from
an anti-ferromagnetic (AF) configuration to a ferromagnetic (F) one. This
magnetic transition coincides with a topological transition, marked by a
quantized jump in the Zak phase from $\pm\pi$ to $0$. We systematically compute
the phase diagrams in the parameter space of on-site energy staggering
($\epsilon$) and inter-chain hopping asymmetry ($\lambda$), revealing the
critical interaction strength $U_c$. Furthermore, we analyze the quantum
geometry of the Bloch states by calculating the Fubini-Study metric,
demonstrating that its components exhibit divergences that precisely signal the
topological phase transition. By analyzing the full energy spectrum, we
distinguish the true ground state from metastable excited states that emerge
past the critical point. Our results establish the Creutz-Hubbard ladder as a
minimal model for studying interaction-induced topological phenomena and
suggest a potential route for controlling magnetic, topological, and geometric
properties via electronic correlations.

### Intrinsic Nernst Effect from Berry Curvature in Superconductors

The Nernst effect in superconductors is typically linked to fluctuating
Cooper pairs above $T_c$ or vortex motion below $T_c$. We show instead that
Berry curvature of Bogoliubov quasiparticles can generate an intrinsic Nernst
response in a clean, vortex-free superconducting state. Focusing on
two-dimensional (2D) systems with Ising spin-orbit coupling, relevant to
transition-metal dichalcogenides, we identify two regimes: an intervalley
$s$-wave paired state where a weak magnetic field activates the effect, and an
intravalley chiral $p$-wave paired state that exhibits a spontaneous charge or
spin Nernst response without a field. We propose an experimental setup that
circumvents screening and provide estimates of the signal magnitude. Our
results establish the Nernst effect as a direct probe of Berry curvature and
pairing symmetry in 2D spin-orbit-coupled superconductors.

Oxide Li-conducting solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) offer excellent chemical
and thermal stability but typically exhibit lower ionic conductivity than
sulfides and chlorides. This motivates the search for new oxide materials with
enhanced conductivity. Crystal structure prediction is a powerful approach for
identifying such candidates. However, the structural complexity of oxide SSEs,
often involving unit cells with more than 100 atoms, presents significant
challenges for conventional methods. In this study, we introduce TOPIC, a
structure prediction algorithm that reduces configurational complexity by
enforcing corner-sharing (CS) bond topology constraints. We demonstrate that
TOPIC successfully reproduces the ground-state and metastable structures of
known oxide SSEs, including LiTa$_2$PO$_8$ and Li$_7$La$_3$Zr$_2$O$_{12}$,
which contain up to about 200 atoms per unit cell. By combining this approach
with a pretrained machine-learning interatomic potential, we systematically
screen quaternary oxide compositions and identify 92 promising candidates with
CS frameworks. In particular, Li$_4$Hf$_2$Si$_3$O$_{12}$, which corresponds to
the ground state at its composition, exhibits an ionic conductivity of 14 mS
cm$^{-1}$, a hull energy of 21 meV atom$^{-1}$, and a band gap of 6.5 eV.
Through our investigation, we identify the Li ratio as one of the key factors
determining the stability of CS structures. Overall, our approach provides a
practical and scalable pathway for discovering high-performance oxide solid
electrolytes in previously unexplored chemical spaces.

Energy harvesting is a technique that generates useful work from waste heat.
Conventional energy harvesters acting on local thermal equilibrium states are
constrained by thermodynamic limits, such as the Carnot efficiency. Quantum
heat engines with non-thermal reservoirs are expected to exceed such limits.
Here, we demonstrate energy harvesting from a nonthermal Tomonaga-Luttinger
(TL) liquid in quantum Hall edge channels, where the non-thermal state is
naturally formed due to the absence of thermalization. The scheme is tested
with a quantum-dot energy harvester working on a non-thermal TL liquid supplied
with waste heat from a quantum-point-contact transistor. Compared to the
quasi-thermalized TL liquid, the non-thermal state prepared under the same heat
is capable of a larger electromotive force and higher conversion efficiency.
These characteristics can be understood by considering a binary Fermi
distribution function of the non-thermal state induced by entropy-conserving
equilibration. TL liquids are attractive non-thermal carriers for excellent
energy harvesting.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文研究了具有幂律长程相互作用的自洽长程Kitaev链模型，发现拓扑边缘模式的质量继承了相互作用的渐近标度，即使波函数重叠为零也会发生混合，且在热力学极限下边缘模式保持无质量。

In one-dimensional p-wave superconductors with short-range interactions,
topologically protected Majorana modes emerge, whose mass decays exponentially
with system size, as first shown by Kitaev. In this work, we extend this
prototypical model by including power law long-range interactions within a
self-consistent framework, leading to the self-consistent long-range Kitaev
chain (seco-LRKC). In this model, the gap matrix acquires a rich structure
where short-range superconducting correlations coexist with long-range
correlations that are exponentially localized at both chain edges
simultaneously. As a direct consequence, the topological edge modes hybridize
even if their wavefunction overlap vanishes, and the edge mode mass inherits
the asymptotic scaling of the interaction. In contrast to models with imposed
power law pairing, where massive Dirac modes emerge for exponents $\nu &lt; d$, we
analytically motivate and numerically demonstrate that, in the fully
self-consistent model, algebraic edge mode decay with system size persists for
all interaction exponents $\nu &gt; 0$, despite exponential wave function
localization. While the edge mode remains massless in the thermodynamic limit,
finite-size corrections can be experimentally relevant in mesoscopic systems
with effective long-range interactions that decay sufficiently slowly.

- **TL;DR**: 通过微调基础机器学习势能，显著提高了表面建模的计算效率和预测精度，相比从头训练方法，使用少得多的训练数据就能大幅降低预测误差。

Accurate prediction of surface energies and stabilities is essential for
materials design, yet first-principles calculations remain computationally
expensive and most existing interatomic potentials are trained only on bulk
systems. Here, we demonstrate that fine-tuning foundation machine learning
potentials (MLPs) significantly improves both computational efficiency and
predictive accuracy for surface modeling. While existing universal interatomic
potentials (UIPs) have been solely trained and validated on bulk datasets, we
extend their applicability to complex and scientifically significant unary,
binary, and ternary surface systems. We systematically compare models trained
from scratch, zero-shot inference, conventional fine-tuning, and multi-head
fine-tuning approach that enhances transferability and mitigates catastrophic
forgetting. Fine-tuning consistently reduces prediction errors with
orders-of-magnitude fewer training configurations, and multi-head fine-tuning
delivers robust and generalizable predictions even for materials beyond the
initial training domain. These findings offer practical guidance for leveraging
pre-trained MLPs to accelerate surface modeling and highlight a scalable path
toward data-efficient, next-generation atomic-scale simulations in
computational materials science.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种基于VO2纳米间隙Mott忆阻器振荡器电路的听觉传感单元，能够选择性检测振动并发射神经脉冲波形，适用于完全植入式人工耳蜗。

Neurodynamic behavior of artificial neuron circuits made of Mott memristors
provides versatile opportunities to utilize them for artificial sensing. Their
small size and energy efficiency of generating spiking electrical signals
enable usage in fully implantable cochlear implants. Here, we propose an
auditory sensing unit realized by a piezo-MEMS (micro-electromechanical
systems) cantilever connected to a VO$_2$ nanogap Mott memristor-based
oscillator circuit. This auditory sensing unit is capable of
frequency-selective detection of vibrations and subsequent emission of a neural
spiking waveform. The auditory sensing unit is tested under biologically
realistic vibration amplitudes, and spike rate-encoding of the incoming
stimulus is demonstrated, similarly to natural hearing processes. The
tunability of the output spiking frequency and the shape of the spiking
waveform are also demonstrated to provide suitable voltage spikes for the
nervous system.

Quantum spin liquid (QSL) phases exist in theory, but real candidate QSL
materials are often extraordinarily sensitive to structural defects which
disrupt the ground state. Here, we investigate candidate triangular QSL
material YbCu$_{1.14}$Se$_2$ and discover the absence of magnetic order, but
also no compelling evidence of a QSL ground state due to significant structural
disorder. We instead look at the results through a lens of a 2-dimensional (2D)
random singlet phase. YbCu$_{1.14}$Se$_2$ behaves strikingly similar to other
disordered triangular lattice materials, suggesting universal behavior of
random singlet formation in 2D frustrated systems.

- **TL;DR**: 开发了基于原子簇展开(ACE)方法的机器学习原子间势能，用于YBa2Cu3O7(YBCO)高温超导体的缺陷动力学研究，特别关注氧弗伦克尔对缺陷及其扩散机制。

Defects in high temperature superconductors such as YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ (YBCO)
critically influence their superconducting behavior, as they substantially
degrade or even suppress superconductivity. With the renewed interest in
cuprates for next-generation superconducting magnets operating in
radiation-harsh environments such as fusion reactors and particle accelerators,
accurate atomistic modeling of defects and their dynamics has become essential.
Here, we present a general-purpose machine-learning interatomic potential for
YBCO, based on the Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE) method and trained on Density
Functional Theory (DFT) data, with particular emphasis on defects and their
diffusion mechanisms. The potential is validated against DFT calculations of
ground-state properties, defect formation energies of oxygen Frenkel pairs and
diffusion barriers for their formation. Remarkably, the potential captures the
diffusion-driven orthorhombic to tetragonal transition at elevated
temperatures, a transformation that is difficult to describe with empirical
potentials, elucidating how the formation of oxygen Frenkel pairs in the basal
plane governs this order-disorder transition. The ACE potential introduced here
enables large-scale, predictive atomistic simulations of defect dynamics and
transport processes in YBCO, providing a powerful tool to explore its
stability, performance, and functionality under realistic operating conditions.
Moreover, this work proves that machine learning interatomic potentials are
suitable for studies of quaternary oxides with complex chemistry.

- **TL;DR**: 本文提出氧含量稀土氢化物的光致变色反应动力学应视为两步过程而非单步过程，包含快速反应速率限制过程和慢速扩散限制过程。

The kinetics of the photochromic reaction of oxygen-containing rare-earth
hydrides is commonly described by an exponential function assuming a
single-step process. In this paper, we elaborate on the origin of the
photochromic effect in oxygen-containing rare-earth metal hydrides, considering
the kinetics of the reaction as a two-step process. We show that the fit to the
experimental data is improved drastically when two processes that cause the
photodarkening are assumed: a fast reaction rate-limited - for example,
electronic or local - process and a slow, e.g. diffusion-limited process.

### Orbital altermagnetism on the kagome lattice and possible application to $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$

- **TL;DR**: 该论文提出在具有奇数子晶格的晶格中可以实现类交替磁态，特别是在费米能级接近范霍夫奇点的kagome金属中，通过电荷密度波和环流不稳定性产生轨道铁磁、反铁磁和交替磁相。

Altermagnets, which encompass a broad landscape of materials, are compensated
collinear magnetic phases in which the antiparallel magnetic moments are
related by a crystalline rotation. Here, we argue that collinear
altermagnetic-like states can also be realized in lattices with an odd number
of sublattices, provided that the electronic interactions promote non-uniform
magnetic moments. We demonstrate this idea for a kagome metal whose band
filling places the Fermi level close to the van Hove singularity. Combining
phenomenological and microscopic modeling, we show that the intertwined charge
density-wave and loop-current instabilities of this model lead to a wide
parameter range in which orbital ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and
altermagnetic phases emerge inside the charge-ordered state. In the presence of
spin-orbit coupling, their electronic structures display the usual spin-split
fingerprints associated with the three types of collinear magnetic order. We
discuss the possible realization of orbital altermagnetic phases in the
$A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ family of kagome metals.

- **TL;DR**: 利用干涉二次谐波产生偏振测量法，实现了对六方氮化硼晶格取向和结构完整性的无损检测，揭示了反平行畴的普遍形成及其对晶体有序度的影响。

Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) supports a wide range of two-dimensional (2D)
technologies, yet assessing its crystalline quality over large areas remains a
fundamental challenge. Both antiparallel domains, an intrinsic outcome of
epitaxy on high-symmetry substrates, and orientational domains have long evaded
optical detection. Here, we show that interferometric second-harmonic
generation (SHG) polarimetry provides a powerful, non-destructive probe of
lattice orientation and structural integrity in chemical vapor deposition-grown
hBN. This approach reveals the ubiquitous formation of antiparallel domains and
quantifies their impact on crystalline order. SHG intensity also emerges as a
direct optical metric of domain disorder, spanning three orders of magnitude
across films produced by ten different growth routes. Correlation with Raman
spectroscopy establishes a unified framework for evaluating crystalline
quality. Beyond hBN, this method offers a high-throughput route to wide-area
structural imaging in other non-centrosymmetric 2D materials, advancing their
deployment in electronics, photonics, and quantum technologies.

The Holstein-Primakoff boson representation of quantum spins and associated
large-$S$ expansion have been the standard framework for describing the spin
wave excitations in magnetically order phases of quantum spin systems. However,
we will show that the omission of projection operators and normal-ordering in
this representation can produce incorrect magnon hamiltonians for finite $S$.
We will present the exact normal-ordered forms of the finite-$S$ projection
operators and projected Holstein-Primakoff boson representations of spin and
quadrupole operators, which can produce exact two-magnon interaction terms
under ferromagnetic or fully polarized states. We will also discuss the
difficulties of applying this projected representation to antiferromagnetic
spin wave theory.

Considerable effort continues to be devoted to the exploration of
next-generation high-\k{appa} materials that combine a high dielectric constant
with a wide band gap. However, machine learning (ML)-based virtual screening
has remained challenging, primarily due to the low accuracy in predicting the
ionic contribution to the dielectric tensor, which dominates the dielectric
performance of high-\k{appa} materials. We here propose a joint ML model that
predicts Born effective charges using an equivariant graph neural network, and
phonon properties using a highly accurate pretrained ML potential. The ionic
dielectric tensor is then computed analytically from these quantities. This
approach significantly improves the accuracy of ionic contribution. Using the
proposed model, we successfully identified 38 novel high-\k{appa} oxides from a
screening pool of over 8,000 candidates.

### Amplified response of cavity-coupled quantum-critical systems

- **TL;DR**: 量子临界点与量子化腔场耦合可显著促进超辐射相变，在极小光-物质耦合下即可实现，并伴随强内禀压缩效应。

A quantum critical point develops when matter undergoes a continuous
transformation between distinct ground states at absolute zero. It hosts
pronounced quantum fluctuations, which render the system highly susceptible to
external perturbations. While light-matter coupling has rapidly moved forward
as a means to probe and control quantum materials, the capacity of quantum
critical fluctuations in the photon-mediated responses has been largely
unexplored. Here we advance the notion that directly coupling a quantum
critical mode to a quantized cavity field dramatically facilitates the onset of
superradiance. When the coupling between the two fields is bilinear, the
transition is found to occur at vanishingly small light-matter coupling and is
accompanied by strongly enhanced intrinsic squeezing. Our results identify a
particularly favorable setting for realizing the elusive superradiant state,
and point to a general principle by which quantum criticality amplifies
photon-matter entanglement and enhances the associated metrological
performance.

### Topological Textures in Zr-Substituted Barium Titanate

Topological polarization textures in ferroelectrics offer pathways to dense
memory, neuromorphic computing, and controlled probes of topology in solids. In
rhombohedral barium titanate, theory has identified stable antiskyrmions of
topological charge -2 that fractionalize into six -1/3 fractional hotspots,
termed topological quarks. Here we extend this landscape to Zr-substituted
barium titanate (BZT) using a first-principles parameterized
effective-Hamiltonian framework. In an ordered 12.5% composition, the
chemically doubled periodicity enforces an alternation along [111]: one half
hosts the -2 antiskyrmion (six -1/3 quarks), the other a +4 skyrmion (six +2/3
quarks). The two share the same six-vortex skeleton but differ by an integer +1
per vortex in the plane-integrated slice charge. In random BZT, nanodomains
remain inducible and cryogenically stable, yet quenched disorder pins and
distorts the vortices, producing a heterogeneous, skyrmion-glass like state
with fluctuations of the topological charge along the axis. Thermal stability
maps show that pure BT retains -2 textures up to ~100 K, whereas in BZT the
critical temperature is nonmonotonic, with a minimum near 6-8% Zr, reflecting
competition between ferroelectric softening and disorder pinning. Importantly,
the 12.5% ordered arrangement remains rhombohedral above 300 K, enabling
field-stabilized nanodomains at 293 K. Under a local [111] bias, the ordered
system carries +4 slice charge, while the random composition fragments under
the same conditions. These results establish BZT as a platform for chemically
programmed, fractionalized ferroelectric topology from cryogenic to room
temperature and suggest routes to multistate, reconfigurable devices.

### Exact heat flux formula and its spectral decomposition in molecular dynamics for arbitrary many-body potentials

In this study we have derived an exact framework for the calculation of the
heat flux and its spectral decomposition in Molecular Dynamics (MD) for
arbitrary many-body potentials. This work addresses several lacks and
limitations of previous approaches and allows for the accurate computational
study of thermal properties in a wide variety of many-body systems with MD. We
have tested our modifications with Green-Kubo (GK) and Non-Equilibrium MD
(NEMD) simulations for various 2D and 3D material systems using the Tersoff and
Stillinger-Weber potentials as examples. The spectral decomposition of the heat
current was also calculated for monolayer graphene (1LG) and MoS2 , for
different system lengths. Our results show that the heat current calculated by
our method is consistently in agreement with the thermostat current in NEMD,
while previous implementations can estimate quite poorly the thermal
conductivity both under GK and NEMD simulations, and both for 2D and 3D
materials. The decomposition of the heat current also sheds light on the
contribution of different phonon modes to thermal conductivity and its
dependence on length. Our methodology is implemented in the widely used LAMMPS
code specifically for the Tersoff and SW potentials, and it is readily
applicable to the vast majority of many-body MD potentials.

The properties of spin fluctuations in antiferromagnets are largely
unexplored, in particular at ultrafast timescales. Here, we employ femtosecond
noise correlation spectroscopy (FemNoC) to experimentally study magnetization
fluctuations in the canted antiferromagnet Sm$_{0.7}$Er$_{0.3}$FeO$_{3}$ across
its spin reorientation transition and under external magnetic fields. By
comparing our measurements to atomistic spin noise and Monte Carlo simulations,
we find that the amplitude of the spin noise is governed by the free energy,
with stronger fluctuations in regions where the potential landscape softens. We
furthermore demonstrate that external magnetic fields suppress spin
fluctuations and enhance the quasi-ferromagnetic magnon frequency by
effectively stiffening the potential. These results highlight an effective
route for tuning ultrafast magnetization fluctuations via external parameters.

### Towards stable metal inorganic-organic complex glasses

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种通过缓慢溶剂去除和淬火相结合的新方法制备金属无机-有机复合玻璃，避免了凝胶热分解和结晶问题，成功制备了大尺寸、稳定的功能性MIOC玻璃。

Metal inorganic-organic complex (MIOC) glasses have emerged as a new family
of melt-quenched glasses. However, the vitrification of MIOC is challenging
since most of the crystalline MIOC precursors decompose before melting. The
decomposition problem severely narrows the compositional range of MIOC glass
formation. Here, we report a novel approach for preparing the MIOC glasses that
combines slow-solvent-removal with subsequent quenching to avoid gel thermal
decomposition and crystallization. Specifically, the new approach utilizes an
aprotic solvent (acetone) to kinetically prevent the ordering of the
metal-ligand complex molecules in solution, thereby suppressing crystallization
and forming a gel. The subsequent gradual drying process leads to the removal
of the solvent to enhance the connections between molecules through hydrogen
bonds, thus causing the formation of a hydrogen-bonded network. The increased
network connectivity lowers the mobility of the molecules, thereby avoiding gel
crystallization. Consequently, a disordered network is frozen-in during
quenching of the dried gel from 130 {\deg}C to room temperature, and finally
MIOC glass forms. Structural analyses reveal that hydrogen bonds are
responsible for connecting the tetrahedral units. The as-prepared MIOC glass
exhibits some fascinating behaviors, e.g., Tg increasing with rapid
room-temperature relaxation, CO2 uptake, and red-shift of photoluminescence.
This work not only presents a novel strategy for fabricating large-sized,
stable, functional MIOC glasses, but also uncovers the critical role of
hydrogen bonds in MIOC glass formation.

Achieving uniform and controlled transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) shell
growth on nanowires (NWs) remains a key challenge, limiting the development of
high-quality core-shell heterostructures for optoelectronic and photocatalytic
applications. In this work, the fabrication of ZnSe-MoSe2 and ZnSe-WSe2
core-shell NWs was successfully demonstrated. ZnSe NWs were grown via the
vapor-liquid-solid growth mechanism, while TMD (MoSe2 or WSe2) shells were
formed through a two-step process of sacrificial oxide layer deposition via
magnetron sputtering followed by selenization process in a chemical vapor
transport reactor. As-grown nanostructures were characterized using X-ray
diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and photoluminescence spectroscopy. It was
observed that the TMD shell morphology can be controlled through the
selenization process temperature optimization, which arises due to different
growth mechanisms discussed here. The studied trends could be further extended
to other semiconductor NW and TMD core-shell heterostructure growth, offering
promising avenues for advanced nanoscale applications.

### Strain-Gradient-Driven Decoupling of Thermal Suppression from Anisotropy in \b{eta}-Ga2O3

Strain gradients, ubiquitous in flexible devices and epitaxial
nanostructures, are a major blind spot for thermal transport in \b{eta}-Ga2O3.
We establish that strain gradient unlocks a thermal conductivity (k)
suppression mechanism fundamentally more potent than uniform strain: moderate
uniaxial gradients (0.6%/nm) suppress k by 32-37% (27-30%) in thin films
(nanowires), intensifying to 43.3% with biaxial gradients. This reduction far
exceeds that from equivalent uniform strain and surpasses benchmark materials
like silicon and BAs. Critically, a surprising decoupling emerges: while 3%
uniform strain alters thermal anisotropy by ~25%, strain gradient strongly
suppresses k with preserving this ratio. Mechanistically, strain
gradients-induced symmetry breaking and enhanced mode coupling anisotropically
activate forbidden scattering channels, making gradient-driven scattering
dominant over intrinsic phonon scattering below 6.25 THz. These findings
redefine non-uniform strain from a parasitic flaw into a powerful design tool
for engineering thermal isolation and heat flux in next-generation flexible and
high-power \b{eta}-Ga2O3 electronics.

Terahertz (THz) electromagnetic pulses offer a promising route for the
ultrafast manipulation of magnetization in ferromagnetic materials. While
previous studies have demonstrated the excitation of spin dynamics using
linearly polarized THz fields, the role of circular polarization and the
effects of rapidly oscillating, time-dependent field profiles remained
insufficiently understood. We have developed a unified theoretical framework
for describing the excitation of spin precession via Zeeman interaction in
magnetic materials by high frequency pulses of arbitrary polarization with
temporal Gaussian profile. In the regime of long pulses (at least several
oscillations are within the pulse duration), a circularly polarized magnetic
field acts as an effective rectified magnetic field along the pulse
propagation, while linear polarized pulses excite no free precession. In the
regime of short pulses (less than one oscillation is within the pulse
duration), pulses of any polarization, including linear one can excite free
spin precession. There is an optimal pulse duration which maximizes amplitude
of the spin precession. It depends on magnetic parameters of the sample and the
external magnetic field, as well as on the carrier frequency of the pulse and
its amplitude. These findings bridge key gaps in the understanding of
THz-induced spin dynamics and provide insights into the design of
light-controlled magnetization schemes using tailored electromagnetic pulses.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了基于深度学习的自动化SEM图像分割框架PerovSegNet，用于精确识别钙钛矿太阳能电池薄膜中的碘化铅、钙钛矿相和缺陷区域，显著提升分析效率和准确性。

Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) is indispensable for characterizing the
microstructure of thin films during perovskite solar cell fabrication. Accurate
identification and quantification of lead iodide and perovskite phases are
critical because residual lead iodide strongly influences crystallization
pathways and defect formation, while the morphology of perovskite grains
governs carrier transport and device stability. Yet current SEM image analysis
is still largely manual, limiting throughput and consistency. Here, we present
an automated deep learning-based framework for SEM image segmentation that
enables precise and efficient identification of lead iodide, perovskite and
defect domains across diverse morphologies. Built upon an improved YOLOv8x
architecture, our model named PerovSegNet incorporates two novel modules: (i)
Adaptive Shuffle Dilated Convolution Block, which enhances multi-scale and
fine-grained feature extraction through group convolutions and channel mixing;
and (ii) Separable Adaptive Downsampling module, which jointly preserves
fine-scale textures and large-scale structures for more robust boundary
recognition. Trained on an augmented dataset of 10,994 SEM images, PerovSegNet
achieves a mean Average Precision of 87.25% with 265.4 Giga Floating Point
Operations, outperforming the baseline YOLOv8x-seg by 4.08%, while reducing
model size and computational load by 24.43% and 25.22%, respectively. Beyond
segmentation, the framework provides quantitative grain-level metrics, such as
lead iodide/perovskite area and count, which can serve as reliable indicators
of crystallization efficiency and microstructural quality. These capabilities
establish PerovSegNet as a scalable tool for real-time process monitoring and
data-driven optimization of perovskite thin-film fabrication.The source code is

- **TL;DR**: 研究了山竹果皮和仙草叶天然染料浓度比对染料敏化太阳能电池性能的影响，发现1:3比例组合可获得最高3.50%的光电转换效率。

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are promising low-cost and environmentally
friendly photovoltaic devices, especially when utilizing natural sensitizers.
This study explores the effect of concentration ratios of natural dyes
extracted from mangosteen peel (MP) and grass jelly leaves (GJL) on the
optical, morphological, and photovoltaic properties of DSSCs. Dye solutions
were prepared at a fixed concentration of 0.6 g/mL, with the MP:GJL volume
ratio varied at 3:1, 2:1, 1:1, 1:2, and 1:3. As a result, UV-Vis absorption
spectra showed that the MP contributes to the UV-blue region (350-450), while
the GJL contributes to the red region (650-700 nm). The current-voltage (J-V)
analysis showed that the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of MP and GJL dyes
is 2.75% and 2.12%. The composite dye with a 1:3 (MP:GJL) ratio yielded the
highest PCE of 3.50%, demonstrating the synergistic effect of combining these
natural sensitizers to broaden the light absorption spectrum.
