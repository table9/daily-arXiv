- **TL;DR**: 该研究构建了AV3Sb5 kagome金属的8带最小模型，通过考虑V-V和V-平面Sb的最近邻库仑相互作用，分析了键序和环流涨落对超导配对对称性的影响。研究发现时间反演奇的电荷环流涨落有利于非常规配对对称性，而时间反演偶的电荷键序涨落有利于常规配对对称性。

The pairing symmetry and underlying mechanism for superconducting state of
AV${}_3$Sb${}_5$ (A=K, Rb, Cs) kagome metal has been a topic of intense
investigation. In this work, we consider an 8-band minimal model, which
includes V, and the two types of Sb, both within and above/below the kagome
plane. This model captures the Fermi surface pocket with significant in-plane
Sb contribution near the zone center, and also has the two types of van Hove
singularities (VHS), one of which has a strong out of plane Sb weight. By
including V-V and V-planar Sb nearest-neighbor Coulomb interactions, we obtain
the susceptibilities for fluctuating bond-order and loop-current in both charge
and spin channels, and examine the resulting superconducting instabilities. In
particular, we find that the time-reversal odd (even) charge-loop-current
(charge bond-order) fluctuations favor unconventional (conventional) pairing
symmetry such as $s_{+-}$ and $d+id$ ($s_{++}$). Recent experimental works have
highlighted the presence of $s$-wave pairing with two distinct gaps, one
isotropic and one anisotropic. We discuss how this scenario may be compatible
with either $s_{++}$ or $s_{+-}$ pairing, with an isotropic gap on the pocket
dominated by in-plane Sb, but a highly anisotropic gap on V-dominated bands.

- **TL;DR**: 在块状超导体-正常金属结中观察到热整流现象，Pb-Al结在5.2K温度下获得1.75的热整流比，具有大热导率差异和磁可调工作温度的优势。

Thermal diode is a growing technology and important for active thermal flow
control. Since the theoretical designing of thermal diode in 2004, various
kinds of solid-state thermal diodes have been theoretically and experimentally
investigated. Here, we report on the observation of thermal rectification in
bulk-size superconductor-normal metal junctions. High-purity (5N) wires of Pb
and Al are soldered, and thermal conductivity (\k{appa}) of the junctions is
measured in two different directions of the heat flow, forward (\k{appa}F) and
reverse (\k{appa}R) directions. Thermal rectification ratio (\k{appa}F /
\k{appa}R) of 1.75 is obtained at T ~ 5.2 K with H = 400 Oe. The merit of the
Pb-Al junction is a large difference of \k{appa} in an order of several hundred
W m-1 K-1 and magneto-tunability of the working temperature.

- **TL;DR**: 在FeTe0.55Se0.45薄膜中实现了无磁场、非易失性的超导二极管效应，具有1.9%的整流系数和高达9K的工作温度。

The superconducting diode effect (SDE) - the asymmetry of critical currents
with respect to current direction - is a pivotal advancement in non-reciprocal
superconductivity. While SDE has been realized in diverse systems, a
fundamental challenge remains achieving field-free operation in iron-based
superconductors with simple device geometries. Here, we report a non-volatile,
field-free SDE in thin crystalline FeTe$_{0.55}$Se$_{0.45}$(FTS), showing
asymmetric critical currents with a rectification coefficient of 1.9% and
operating temperatures up to 9 K. Intriguingly, a pronounced non-zero second
harmonic resistance emerges at the superconducting transition, exhibiting a
sign reversal under varying current and temperature. The SDE persists at zero
magnetic field and the rectification coefficient($\eta$) exhibits an even
symmetric dependence on the magnetic field, distinguishing it from magnetic
chirality anisotropy mechanisms. In addition to this, we systematically ruled
out influences from dynamic superconducting domains, thermal gradients, and
sample geometry, while establishing that localized stress amplifies the
rectification coefficient, likely constituting one of the principal
contributing factors. These results establish FTS as a robust platform for
realizing field-free superconducting diodes in a structurally simple platform.

### Hybrid Delta Tracking Schemes Using a Track-Length Estimator

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种使用径迹长度估计器的delta跟踪算法，用于在结构化直角网格上计算通量，并开发了混合表面-delta跟踪方法和混合能量方法，在具有显著空隙区域的问题中性能提升1.5-2.5倍。

In Monte Carlo radiation transport calculations, Woodcock-delta tracking is a
common alternative to the more popular surface tracking technique. In this work
we introduce a delta-tracking algorithm that tallies fluxes to a structured
rectilinear mesh using the track-length estimator. This development also
enables hybrid surface-delta tracking algorithms, because the track-length
tally can be used everywhere for scalar flux estimation regardless of which
tracking algorithm is employed. We use this tallying technique to develop a
novel hybrid-in-energy method. We also implement a hybrid-in-material method,
like what is implemented in Serpent2. We demonstrate that these delta tracking
algorithms can be used in conjunction with continuously moving surfaces. We
compare these methods showing figures of merit on four time-dependent problems
(multi-group and continuous energy) solved with CPU- and GPU-based computers.
Our implementation of delta tracking with a track length tally modestly
improves figures of merit compared to standard delta tracking with a collision
estimator and surface tracking with a track length estimator (1.5X 2.5X) for a
problem with significant void regions. For both multi-group and continuous
energy pressurized water reactor benchmarks, standard delta tracking with a
collision estimator performs best. Hybrid-in-energy methods show significant
improvements (7X-11X) for a continuous energy reactor benchmark problem.

Classical and multiscale non-equilibrium thermodynamics have different
histories and different objectives. In this Note we explain the differences and
review some topics in which the multiscale viewpoint of mesoscopic time
evolution of macroscopic systems helped to advance the classical
non-equilibrium thermodynamics. Eventually, we illustrate the Braun-Le
Chatelier principle in dissipative thermodynamics.

### Large superconducting diode effect driven by edge states in twisted iron-chalcogenide Josephson junctions

- **TL;DR**: 本文报道了在扭曲范德华约瑟夫森异质结构中实现了约30%的无磁场二极管效率，这是目前记录最高的效率。该效应具有显著的扭曲角依赖性，在晶体学对齐时达到峰值，而在约7度的小偏差时消失。

The superconducting diode effect (SDE)-the unidirectional, dissipationless
flow of supercurrent-is a critical element for future superconducting
electronics. Achieving high efficiency under zero magnetic field is a key
requirement. The Josephson junction constitutes a versatile SDE platform for
exploiting quantum materials that exhibit ferromagnetism, topology, or
unconventional superconductivity. However, a single two-dimensional material
system that inherently offers these properties and allows for precise interface
engineering, such as twisting, remains elusive. Here we report a record-high,
field-free diode efficiency of ~30% in twist van der Waals Josephson
heterostructures of the sign-change iron-chalcogenide superconductor
FeTe0.55Se0.45 and the conventional transition-metal dichalcogenide
superconductor 2H-NbSe2. The diode response shows a striking twist-angle
dependence: the efficiency peaks at crystallographic alignment and collapses
with a small misorientation of ~7 deg. Importantly, the twist-angle evolution
of superconducting interference measurements reveals that efficient
nonreciprocity arises from asymmetric edge supercurrents, whereas bulk
transport suppresses the effect. These findings establish edge states as the
driving mechanism of the unconventional SDE, linking it to exotic pairing and
topology in multiband iron-based superconductors. Our findings reveal intricate
physics involving novel pairing symmetry, magnetism, and topology in the
multiband iron-based superconductor, and offer a new route to high-performance
superconducting diodes.

### Instabilities and Phase Transformations in Architected Metamaterials: a Gradient-Enhanced Continuum Approach

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种非局部连续介质模型，用于捕捉弹性结构超材料的稳定和不稳定响应，通过引入非局部变量和内部长度尺度来模拟微观结构特征。

Architected metamaterials such as foams and lattices exhibit a wide range of
properties governed by microstructural instabilities and emerging phase
transformations. Their macroscopic response--including energy dissipation
during impact, large recoverable deformations, morphing between configurations,
and auxetic behavior--remains difficult to capture with conventional continuum
models, which often rely on discrete approaches that limit scalability. We
propose a nonlocal continuum formulation that captures both stable and unstable
responses of elastic architected metamaterials. The framework extends
anisotropic hyperelasticity by introducing nonlocal variables and internal
length scales reflective of microstructural features. Local polyconvex
free-energy models are systematically augmented with two families of
non-(poly)convex energies, enabling both metastable and bistable responses.
Implementation in a finite element framework enables solution using a hybrid
monolithic--staggered strategy. Simulations capture densification fronts,
forward and reverse transformations, hysteresis loops, imperfection
sensitivity, and globally coordinated auxetic modes. Overall, this framework
provides a robust foundation for accelerated modeling of instability-driven
phenomena in architected materials, while enabling extensions to anisotropic,
dissipative, and active systems as well as integration with data-driven and
machine learning approaches.

### Melting of colloidal crystal in a two-dimensional periodic substrate: Switch from a single crossover to two-stage melting

- **TL;DR**: 研究二维胶体晶格在方形对称周期性基底上的熔化转变。当粒子间和粒子-基底相互作用强度相当时，会形成部分钉扎固体，其熔化过程可以是单次交叉转变或两阶段熔化。

The melting transitions of a colloidal lattice confined to a two-dimensional
($2D$) periodic substrate of square symmetry are studied using Monte Carlo
simulations. When the strengths of interparticle and particle-substrate
interactions are comparable, the incommensurate nature of square and triangular
ordering leads to the formation of a partially pinned solid with only one of
the smallest {\bf G} vectors of the substrate present. This low-temperature
phase has true long-range order. By varying the lattice parameter of the
substrate while keeping the filling fraction constant, it is seen that the
transition from this low-temperature solid to a high-temperature modulated
liquid phase can happen via either a single crossover transition or by a
two-stage melting process. The transitions are found to be second-order in
nature when the lattice parameter is $d \lesssim 9 \lambda$, as confirmed by
the finite-size scaling behavior of the specific heat. For the two-stage
melting scenario, the intermediate phase is found to be hexatic. The
transitions observed in this work are different from the predictions of the
KTHNY theory. The study reveals how constraints from substrate periodicity can
fundamentally alter melting dynamics, offering insights into the design of
tunable colloidal systems and advancing the understanding of phase transitions
in two-dimensional particle systems.

### Defect mediated quantum melting of charge ordered insulators

- **TL;DR**: 该论文研究了二维晶格上分数填充ν=p/q的电子系统中Wigner-Mott绝缘体与拓扑有序量子电荷液体之间的相变关系，发现当q为偶数时，最小WMI与最小TO之间不存在直接相变，并揭示了拓扑缺陷在相变中的关键作用。

Two-dimensional (2d) electronic systems on a lattice at fractional filling
$\nu = p/q$ exhibit a competition between charge ordered insulators, called
Wigner-Mott insulators (WMIs), at large Coulomb repulsion and Fermi-liquid
metals at large electronic kinetic energy. When those two energy scales are
roughly equal, insulating states that restore the lattice translation symmetry,
which we call quantum charge liquids (QCLs), may emerge. When gapped, these
QCLs must exhibit topological order. In this work, we show that the allowed
topological ordered phases that are proximate to the WMI strongly depend on the
charge ordering in the WMI. In particular, we show that when $q$ is even, no
direct transition exists between a WMI with the smallest allowed unit cell size
from filling constraints, i.e., the "minimal" WMI, and the topological order
with the smallest ground state degeneracy on a torus allowed by filling
constraints, i.e., the "minimal" TO. Furthermore, we describe the quantum
melting transition of the WMIs to the proximate QCLs in terms of the
proliferation of the topological defects of the WMIs. The field theory of this
transition in terms of the topological defects reveals their role as precursors
to the anyon excitations in the QCLs.

The AM2Pn2 Zintl compounds are a large class of semiconductor materials that
have a wide range of bandgaps and are mostly stable in the same crystal
structure. Representative compounds BaCd2P2 and CaZn2P2 have recently been
found to exhibit high visible light absorption and long carrier lifetime. Here
we use high throughput first-principles calculations to study AM2Pn2 alloys for
applications as tandem top cell absorbers (i.e., bandgaps around 1.8 eV) and
far infrared detector materials (i.e., bandgaps lower than 0.5 eV). Using a
first-principles computational screening workflow for assessing stability and
electronic structure of alloys, we identify several promising candidates. These
include Ca(Cd0.8Mg0.2)2P2 with a suitable direct bandgap for use in tandem top
cells on silicon bottom cells and SrCd2(Sb1-xBix)2 for far infrared detectors.
We demonstrate that alloys of AM2Pn2 materials can be realized by
experimentally synthesizing Ca(Zn0.8Mg0.2)2P2.

### Learning from the electronic structure of molecules across the periodic table

- **TL;DR**: 该论文提出了HELM模型，利用哈密顿矩阵数据训练机器学习势能，通过哈密顿预训练在低数据情况下提升能量预测性能。

Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) require vast amounts of atomic
structure data to learn forces and energies, and their performance continues to
improve with training set size. Meanwhile, the even greater quantities of
accompanying data in the Hamiltonian matrix H behind these datasets has so far
gone unused for this purpose. Here, we provide a recipe for integrating the
orbital interaction data within H towards training pipelines for atomic-level
properties. We first introduce HELM ("Hamiltonian-trained Electronic-structure
Learning for Molecules"), a state-of-the-art Hamiltonian prediction model which
bridges the gap between Hamiltonian prediction and universal MLIPs by scaling
to H of structures with 100+ atoms, high elemental diversity, and large basis
sets including diffuse functions. To accompany HELM, we release a curated
Hamiltonian matrix dataset, 'OMol_CSH_58k', with unprecedented elemental
diversity (58 elements), molecular size (up to 150 atoms), and basis set
(def2-TZVPD). Finally, we introduce 'Hamiltonian pretraining' as a method to
extract meaningful descriptors of atomic environments even from a limited
number atomic structures, and repurpose this shared embedding space to improve
performance on energy-prediction in low-data regimes. Our results highlight the
use of electronic interactions as a rich and transferable data source for
representing chemical space.

### Energy-density-driven ultrafast electronic excitations in a cuprate superconductor

- **TL;DR**: 使用自由电子激光的极紫外和近红外泵浦脉冲研究铜酸盐超导体的飞秒动力学，发现尽管激发通道不同，但产生的超快响应主要由吸收能量而非微观激发性质决定。

Controlling nonequilibrium dynamics in quantum materials requires ultrafast
probes with spectral selectivity. We report femtosecond reflectivity
measurements on the cuprate superconductor Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$
using free-electron laser extreme-ultraviolet (23.5--177~eV) and near-infrared
(1.5~eV) pump pulses. EUV pulses access deep electronic states, while NIR light
excites valence-band transitions. Despite these distinct channels, both schemes
produce nearly identical dynamics: above $T_c$, excitations relax through fast
(100--300~fs) and slower (1--5~ps) channels; below $T_c$, a delayed component
signals quasiparticle recombination and condensate recovery. We find that when
electronic excitations are involved, the ultrafast response is governed mainly
by absorbed energy rather than by the microscopic nature of the excitation. In
contrast, bosonic driving in the THz or mid-infrared produces qualitatively
different dynamics. By demonstrating that EUV excitation of a correlated
superconductor yields macroscopic dynamics converging with those from optical
pumping, this work defines a new experimental paradigm: FEL pulses at
core-level energies provide a powerful means to probe and control
nonequilibrium electronic states in quantum materials on their intrinsic
femtosecond timescales. This establishes FEL-based EUV pumping as a new
capability for ultrafast materials science, opening routes toward soft X-ray
and attosecond studies of correlated dynamics.

- **TL;DR**: FourPhonon_GPU是一个基于GPU加速的三声子和四声子散射率计算框架，通过OpenACC和异构CPU-GPU计算策略，实现了超过25倍的计算加速和10倍的总运行时间加速。

Accurately predicting phonon scattering is crucial for understanding thermal
transport properties. However, the computational cost of such calculations,
especially for four-phonon scattering, can often be more prohibitive when large
number of phonon branches and scattering processes are involved. In this work,
we present FourPhonon_GPU, a GPU-accelerated framework for three-phonon and
four-phonon scattering rate calculations based on the FourPhonon package. By
leveraging OpenACC and adopting a heterogeneous CPU-GPU computing strategy, we
efficiently offload massive, parallelizable tasks to the GPU while using the
CPU for process enumeration and control-heavy operations. Our approach achieves
over 25x acceleration for the scattering rate computation step and over 10x
total runtime speedup without sacrificing accuracy. Benchmarking on various GPU
architectures confirms the method's scalability and highlights the importance
of aligning parallelization strategies with hardware capabilities. This work
provides an efficient and accurate computational tool for phonon transport
modeling and opens pathways for accelerated materials discovery.

We consider a multi-walker generalization of the true self-avoiding walk, the
bricklayer model. We perform stochastic simulations and solve the continuum
partial differential equations that describe the collective evolution of $N$
bricklayers/walkers. These equations were previously derived from hydrodynamic
considerations. In the large-$N$ limit, the results from simulation agree with
  the solutions of the partial differential equations.

### Continuum Fractons: Quantization and the Many Body Problem

We formulate a continuum quantum mechanics for non-relativistic,
dipole-conserving fractons. Imposing symmetries and locality results in novel
phenomena absent in ordinary quantum mechanical systems. A single fracton has a
vanishing Hamiltonian, and thus its spectrum is entirely composed of zero
modes. For the two-body problem, the Hamiltonian is perfectly described by
Sturm--Liouville (SL) theory. The effective two-body Hamiltonian is an SL
operator on $(-1,1)$ whose spectral type is set by the edge behavior of the
pair inertia function $K(x)\sim \lvert x -x_\mathrm{edge} \rvert^{\theta}$. We
identify a sharp transition at $\theta=2$: for $\theta&lt;2$ the spectrum is
discrete and wavepackets reflect from the edges, whereas for $\theta&gt;2$ the
spectrum is continuous and wavepackets slow down and, dominantly, squeeze into
asymptotically narrow regions at the edges. For three particles, the
differential operator corresponding to the Hamiltonian is piecewise defined,
requiring several "matching conditions" which cannot be analyzed as easily. We
proceed with a lattice regularization that preserves dipole conservation, and
implicitly selects a particular continuum Hamiltonian that we analyze
numerically. We find a spectral transition in the three-body spectrum, and find
evidence for quantum analogs of fracton attractors in both eigenstates and in
the time evolution of wavepackets. We provide intuition for these results which
suggests that the lack of ergodicity of classical continuum fractons will
survive their quantization for large systems.

We present a Kokkos-accelerated implementation of the Moment Tensor Potential
(MTP) for LAMMPS, designed to improve both computational performance and
portability across CPUs and GPUs. This package introduces an optimized CPU
variant--achieving up to 2x speedups over existing implementations--and two new
GPU variants: a thread-parallel version for large-scale simulations and a
block-parallel version optimized for smaller systems. It supports three core
functionalities: standard inference, configuration-mode active learning, and
neighborhood-mode active learning. Benchmarks and case studies demonstrate
efficient scaling to million-atom systems, substantially extending accessible
length and time scales while preserving the MTP's near-quantum accuracy and
native support for uncertainty quantification.

### Stochastic Representation of Time-Evolving Neural Network-based Wavefunctions

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种结合随机表示框架和神经网络波函数拟设的方法，用于求解含时薛定谔方程，准确模拟了强激光场下单电子系统的电离动力学。

Solving the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation (TDSE) is pivotal for
modeling non-adiabatic electron dynamics, a key process in ultrafast
spectroscopy and laser-matter interactions. However, exact solutions to the
TDSE remain computationally prohibitive for most realistic systems, as the
Hilbert space expands exponentially with dimensionality. In this work, we
propose an approach integrating the stochastic representation framework with a
neural network wavefunction ansatz, a flexible model capable of approximating
time-evolving quantum wavefunctions. We first validate the method on
one-dimensional single-electron systems, focusing on ionization dynamics under
intense laser fields, a critical process in attosecond physics. Our results
demonstrate that the approach accurately reproduces key features of quantum
evolution, including the energy and dipole evolution during ionization. We
further show the feasibility of extending this approach to three-dimensional
systems. Due to the increased complexity of real-time simulations in higher

- **TL;DR**: 开发了一种基于InAsSb表面量子阱和Nb超导层的混合材料，具有高临界温度和强自旋轨道相互作用，可用于门控超导和拓扑超导器件研究。

We present a novel semiconductor-superconductor hybrid material based on a
molecular beam epitaxially grown InAsSb surface quantum well with an in-situ
deposited Nb top layer. Relative to conventional Al-InAs based systems, the
InAsSb surface quantum well offers a lower effective mass and stronger
spin-orbit interaction, while the Nb layer has a higher critical temperature
and a larger critical magnetic field. The in-situ deposition of the Nb results
in a high-quality interface that enables strong coupling to the InAsSb quantum
well. Transport measurements on Josephson junctions reveal an induced
superconducting gap of 1.3 meV. Furthermore, a planar asymmetric SQUID is
realized, exhibiting gate-tunable superimposed oscillations originating from
both the individual Josephson junction and the full SQUID loop. The large
induced superconducting gap combined with strong spin-orbit interaction
position this material as an attractive platform for experiments exploring
gate-tunable superconductivity and topological superconducting devices.

Rare-earth-doped nitride phosphors are promising materials for solid-state
lighting and photonic applications due to their thermal stability, sharp
emission lines, and strong UV-blue absorption. In this work, we present a
first-principles density functional theory (DFT) study, using the GGA+U
approach, of pristine and Eu3+-doped CaAlSiN3 at doping levels of 8.5% and 17%.
Electronic structure calculations show that Eu incorporation introduces
localized 4f states within the band gap, leading to band-gap narrowing and
enabling red photoluminescence through the 5D0 -&gt; 7F2 transition.
Spin-polarized density of states and spin density mapping confirm the magnetic
nature of Eu3+, while charge density, Bader analysis, and electron localization
function (ELF) indicate mixed ionic-covalent bonding and charge transfer from
Eu to neighboring N and Al atoms, stabilizing the doped lattice. Optical
spectra, including dielectric function, absorption, refractive index, and
reflectivity, reveal red-shifted absorption edges and enhanced visible-range
light-matter interactions, consistent with experimental red to near-infrared
emission. Formation energy analysis confirms the thermodynamic feasibility of
Eu substitution, while elastic constants and Pugh's ratio indicate mechanical
robustness and ductility. Thermoelectric transport properties, obtained using
WIEN2k and BoltzTraP, suggest that moderate Eu3+ doping improves the power
factor and reduces lattice thermal conductivity through disorder scattering.
These results establish Eu-doped CaAlSiN3 as a stable and efficient
red-emitting phosphor for white light-emitting diodes (WLEDs) and provide
theoretical insights for crystal site engineering in advanced optoelectronic
materials.

- **TL;DR**: 研究长程空间相关无序介质中驱动界面的临界动力学，发现相关无序会重塑钉扎转变并产生依赖于Hurst指数H的临界指数族。

We explore the critical dynamics of driven interfaces propagating through a
two dimensional disordered medium with long range spatial correlations, modeled
using fractional Brownian motion. Departing from conventional models with
uncorrelated disorder, we introduce quenched noise fields characterized by a
tunable Hurst exponent H, allowing systematic control over the spatial
structure of the background medium. The interface evolution is governed by a
quenched Kardar Parisi Zhang equation modified to account for correlated
disorder, namely QKPZ. Through analytical scaling analysis, we uncover how the
presence of long-range correlations reshapes the depinning transition, alters
the critical force Fc, and gives rise to a family of critical exponents that
depend continuously on H. Our findings reveal a rich interplay between disorder
correlations and the non-linearity term in QKPZ, leading to a breakdown of
conventional universality and the emergence of nontrivial scaling behaviors.
The exponents are found to change by H in the anticorrelation regime, while
they are nearly constant in the correlation regime, suggesting a
super-universal behavior for the latter. By a comparison with the quenched
Edwards Wilkinson model, we study the effect of the non linearity term in the
QKPZ model. This work provides new insights into the physics of driven systems
in complex environments and paves the way for understanding transport in
correlated disordered media.

### Bidirectional ultrafast control of charge density waves via phase competition

- **TL;DR**: 通过时间分辨X射线衍射，在EuTe$_4$中实现了对电荷密度波(CDW)的超快光学控制。低激发强度下，一个CDW的振幅增加而竞争CDW减弱；高强度下则呈现非单调演化。这种双向可控性源于光学淬灭和相位竞争诱导增强的相互作用。

The intricate competition between coexisting charge density waves (CDWs) can
lead to rich phenomena, offering unique opportunities for phase manipulation
through electromagnetic stimuli. Leveraging time-resolved X-ray diffraction, we
demonstrate ultrafast control of a CDW in EuTe$_4$ upon optical excitation. At
low excitation intensities, the amplitude of one of the coexisting CDW orders
increases at the expense of the competing CDW, whereas at high intensities, it
exhibits a nonmonotonic temporal evolution characterized by both enhancement
and reduction. This transient bidirectional controllability, tunable by
adjusting photo-excitation intensity, arises from the interplay between optical
quenching and phase-competition-induced enhancement. Our findings, supported by
phenomenological time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau theory simulations, not only
clarify the relationship between the two CDWs in EuTe$_4$, but also highlight
the versatility of optical control over order parameters enabled by phase
competition.

### Influence of edge Laser-Induced Periodic Surface Structures (LIPSS) on the electrical properties of fs laser-machined ITO microcircuits

- **TL;DR**: 该论文研究了使用超短脉冲激光系统在ITO薄膜上微加工透明导电氧化物时，激光诱导周期性表面结构（LIPSS）的形成及其对电路电性能的影响。

Scalable and cost-effective methods for processing transparent electrodes at
the microscale are transversal for advancing in electrochemistry,
optoelectronics, microfluidics, and energy harvesting. In these fields, the
precise fabrication of micrometric circuits plays a critical role in
determining device performance and integration with added-value substrates. In
this context, Laser Subtractive Manufacturing stands out among microfabrication
techniques for its adaptability to diverse materials and complex
configurations, as well as its straightforward scalability and affordability
nature. However, a challenge in micromachining metals and metal oxides is the
inherent formation of LIPSS, which can significantly impair electrical
conductivity, particularly when circuit dimensions fall within the micrometer
range. Herein, we investigate the micromachining of TCOs using ultrashort pulse
laser systems applied to ITO thin films. We analyze the formation of LIPSS at
the edges of the micromachined regions associated with the Gaussian
distribution of the energy within the laser spot and their impact on the
electrical properties depending on the circuit characteristics. Thus, we
evaluate the influence of LIPSS orientation and periodicity by fabricating
various circuit patterns using femtosecond lasers at green (515 nm) and
ultraviolet (343 nm) wavelengths. A correlation between electrical resistivity
measurements and structural analysis reveals distinct effects of nanostructure
formation depending on the laser source. For green wavelength, the regions
where LIPSS are oriented perpendicular to the ITO track exhibit higher
resistance, by a factor just above two, compared to those where LIPSS are
parallel. Additionally, UV laser processing results in a pronounced reduction
of ITO thickness at the boundary between the LIPSS region and the substrate.

Diazirines and diazo compounds are widely employed as photoreactive
precursors for generating carbenes, key intermediates in chemical biology and
materials science. However, computationally modeling their reaction pathways
remains challenging due to a need for large active spaces and the requirement
to accurately capture excited-state surfaces along with transition states and
conical intersections. In this work, we utilize a hybrid quantum-classical
workflow for investigating carbene formation in representative
diazirine-diazomethane systems. Our approach leverages Sample-based Quantum
Diagonalization (SQD) and its extended variant (Ext-SQD) for ground and
excited-state analysis, combined with classical tools for geometry
optimization, active-space selection, and diagnostic evaluation. Quantum
computations were carried out on superconducting quantum processors, and
results for both aliphatic and aryl-substituted diazirine-diazomethane pairs
were benchmarked against established classical methods, including DFT, CCSD,
CASCI, and SCI. SQD achieves accuracy surpassing the chemical accuracy
threshold for nearly all stationary points on the potential energy surface of
parent diazirine relative to the CASCI(12,10) reference, and remains close to
chemical accuracy for phenyl-substituted diazirine in a (30,30) active space,
with an average deviation of 1.1 kcal/mol relative to the SCI benchmark. SQD
closely follows CASCI and SCI trends, showing consistent agreement. The
findings demonstrate the promise of quantum computing frameworks in modeling
photochemical transformations of electronically complex and pharmacologically
relevant molecules.

### Anomalous diffusion in multichannel systems without a Lévy distribution of disorder

- **TL;DR**: 多通道量子系统中，即使无序分布不是重尾的，只要通道间存在不对称性，也能出现反常扩散现象。通过最小二通道模型，展示了从正常输运到反常输运的交叉行为。

We show that multichannel quantum systems with uncorrelated but asymmetric
Anderson-type disorder can exhibit anomalous diffusion, even in the absence of
heavy-tailed disorder. Using a minimal two-channel model with channel
asymmetry, we demonstrate a crossover from normal to anomalous transport tuned
by interchannel coupling. Applied to quasi-one-dimensional lattices with edge
disorder, this leads to long-tailed transmission statistics characterized by
ballistic segments interspersed with localized ones, reminiscent of L\'evy
flights. This channel-asymmetric anomalous diffusion (CAAD) emerges from
quantum interference between channels with differing disorder strengths. While
CAAD governs transport at intermediate lengths, conventional localization
prevails asymptotically, violating the Thouless relation. These results
highlight a distinct quantum mechanism for anomalous diffusion beyond classical
paradigms.

Superconductor-semiconductor hybrid materials have been extensively used for
experiments on electrically tunable quantum devices. Notably, Josephson
junctions utilizing nanowire weak links have enabled a number of new
gate-tunable qubits, including gatemons, Andreev level qubits and spin qubits.
Conversely, superconducting parametric amplifiers based on Josephson junctions
have not yet been implemented using nanowires, even though such nearly quantum
limited amplifiers are key elements in experiments on quantum circuits. Here we
present Josephson parametric amplifiers based on arrays of parallel InAs
nanowires that feature a large critical current as required for linear
amplification. The resonance frequency of the devices is gate-tunable by almost
1 GHz, with a gain exceeding 20 dB in multiple frequencies and noise
approaching the quantum-limit. This new platform enables on-chip integration of
gate-tunable qubits with quantum limited amplifiers using the same hybrid
materials and on any substrate.

We present a first-principles density functional theory study of the
structural, electronic, optical, and thermoelectric properties of Sc2BeX4 (X =
S, Se) chalcogenides for energy applications. Both compounds are dynamically
and thermodynamically stable, exhibiting negative formation energies of -2.6 eV
(Sc2BeS4) and -2.2 eV (Sc2BeSe4). They feature direct band gaps of 1.8 eV and
1.2 eV, respectively, within the TB-mBJ approximation, indicating strong
visible-light absorption. Optical analysis reveals high static dielectric
constants (9.0 for S and 16.5 for Se), absorption peaks near 13.5 eV, and
reflectivity below 30 percent. Thermoelectric calculations predict p-type
conduction with Seebeck coefficients reaching 2.5e-4 V/K and electrical
conductivities of 2.45e18 and 1.91e18 (Ohm m s)^-1 at 300 K. Power factors
approach 1.25e11 W/K^2 m s, with a maximum dimensionless figure of merit (ZT)
of 0.80 at 800 K. Calculated Debye temperatures (420 K for Sc2BeS4 and 360 K
for Sc2BeSe4) imply low lattice thermal conductivity. These findings establish
Sc2BeX4 chalcogenides as promising materials for photovoltaic and
thermoelectric applications.

We study SU(4)-symmetric Heisenberg model on the cubic lattice with spatially
anisotropic magnetic couplings. We utilize several approaches based on the
tensor-network representation of the many-body wave functions, which enable
accurate analysis of ground-state properties of the model in different regimes
of spatial anisotropy including fully isotropic three-dimensional case. Our
results point to the persistence of the dimerized color-ordered phase
throughout whole range of magnetic couplings excluding only the limit of
completely decoupled one-dimensional chains.

The position of mobile active and inactive ions, specifically ion insertion
sites, within organic crystals, significantly affects the properties of organic
materials used for energy storage and ionic transport. Identifying the
positions of these atom (and ion) sites in an organic crystal is difficult,
especially when the element has a low X-ray scattering power, such as lithium
(Li) and hydrogen, which are difficult to detect with powder X-ray diffraction
(XRD) methods. First-principles calculations, exemplified by density functional
theory (DFT), are very effective for confirming the relative stability of ion
positions in materials. However, the lack of effective strategies to identify
ion sites in these organic crystalline frameworks renders this task extremely
challenging. This work presents two algorithms: (i) Efficient Location of Ion
Insertion Sites from Extrema in electrostatic local potential and charge
density (ELIISE), and (ii) ElectRostatic InsertioN (ERIN), which leverage
charge density and electrostatic potential fields accessed from
first-principles calculations, combined with the Simultaneous Ion Insertion and
Evaluation (SIIE) workflow -- that inserts all ions simultaneously -- to
determine ion positions in organic crystals. We demonstrate that these methods
accurately reproduce known ion positions in 16 organic materials and also
identify previously overlooked low-energy sites in tetralithium
2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylate (Li$_4$NDC), an organic electrode material,
highlighting the importance of inserting all ions simultaneously as done in the
SIIE workflow.

### Flexible Uncertainty Calibration for Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种灵活的机器学习原子间势能不确定性校准框架，通过参数化优化问题学习环境依赖的分位数函数，显著提升预测区间的准确性和适应性。

Reliable uncertainty quantification (UQ) is essential for developing
machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) in predictive atomistic
simulations. Conformal prediction (CP) is a statistical framework that
constructs prediction intervals with guaranteed coverage under minimal
assumptions, making it an attractive tool for UQ. However, existing CP
techniques, while offering formal coverage guarantees, often lack accuracy,
scalability, and adaptability to the complexity of atomic environments. In this
work, we present a flexible uncertainty calibration framework for MLIPs,
inspired by CP but reformulated as a parameterized optimization problem. This
formulation enables the direct learning of environment-dependent quantile
functions, producing sharper and more adaptive predictive intervals at
negligible computational cost. Using the foundation model MACE-MP-0 as a
representative case, we demonstrate the framework across diverse benchmarks,
including ionic crystals, catalytic surfaces, and molecular systems. Our
results show order-of-magnitude improvements in uncertainty-error correlation,
enhanced data efficiency in active learning, and strong generalization
performance, together with reliable transfer of calibrated uncertainties across
distinct exchange-correlation functionals. This work establishes a principled
and data-efficient approach to uncertainty calibration in MLIPs, providing a
practical route toward more trustworthy and transferable atomistic simulations.

Interlayer sliding degrees of freedom often determine the physical properties
of two-dimensional (2D) materials. In graphene, for instance, the metastable
rhombohedral stacking arrangement hosts correlated and topological electronic
phases, which are absent in conventional Bernal stacking. Here, we demonstrate
a sliding-induced first-order structural phase transition between Bernal and
rhombohedral tetralayer graphene driven by gate voltages. Through transport
measurement, we observe bistable switching between a Bernal-dominant state and
a rhombohedral-Bernal mixed state across a wide space of the gate-voltage phase
diagram. The structural phase transition results in nonvolatile switching
between a paramagnet and a ferromagnet accompanied by the anomalous Hall
effect. The sign reversal of the anomalous Hall effect under opposite
displacement fields suggests that it may originate from domain boundaries
between the Bernal and rhombohedral regions. Our discovery paves the way for
on-demand toggling of quantum phases based on the sliding phase transition of
2D materials and offers a playground to explore unconventional physics at the
stacking domain boundaries.

We present a comprehensive first-principles investigation of the structural,
electronic, optical, and thermodynamic properties of BeX compounds (X = S, Se,
Te) under hydrostatic pressures ranging from 0 to 10 GPa. Calculations were
performed using density functional theory (DFT) within the Generalized Gradient
Approximation (GGA) using the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional, as
implemented in the CASTEP code. Phonon dispersion analyses confirm the
dynamical stability of all compounds across the studied pressure range, as
indicated by the absence of imaginary frequencies throughout the Brillouin
zone. The electronic band structure reveals pressure-induced band
modifications, with BeS retaining the widest bandgap. Optical properties,
including the dielectric function, absorption coefficient, reflectivity, and
energy loss spectra, were computed for photon energies up to 30 eV. The
materials exhibit strong optical absorption in the ultraviolet region,
suggesting potential for UV optoelectronic applications. Thermodynamic
parameters such as Debye temperature, heat capacity, and entropy were
evaluated, showing pressure-dependent trends. Notably, increasing pressure
leads to reduced atomic vibrations and heat capacity, while the Gibbs free
energy exhibits a consistent slope with temperature, reflecting entropy
variation. These results highlight the suitability of BeX compounds for
pressure-sensitive optoelectronic and thermoelectric devices, as well as
thermal barrier applications.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种基于广义主方程的数据驱动方法，通过构建最小投影算子来预测振动和频生成光谱，应用于空气-水界面的从头算分子动力学模拟，实现了约50%的成本降低。

Computing condensed phase spectra from atomistic simulations requires
calculating correlation functions from molecular dynamics and can be very
expensive. A totally general, data-driven method to reduce cost is to employ an
exact rewriting to a generalized master equation characterized by a memory
kernel. The decay time of the kernel can be less than the original function,
reducing the amount of data required. In this paper we construct the minimal
projection operator to predict vibrational sum-frequency generation spectra and
apply it to the air-water interface simulated using ab initio molecular
dynamics. We are able to obtain a modest reduction in cost of just under 50\%.
We explore various avenues to use more of the available data to expand the
projector in an attempt to reduce the cost further. Interestingly, we are not
able to effect any change by including quadrupoles, inter-molecular couplings,
or a depth-dependence. How to strategically go about maximally reducing cost
using projection operators remains an open question.

Localized $5d^2$ electrons in a cubic crystal field possess multipoles such
as electric quadrupoles and magnetic octupoles. We studied the cubic double
perovskite Ba$_2$CaOsO$_6$ containing the Os$^{6+}$ ($5d^2$) ions, which
exhibits a phase transition to a `hidden order' below $T^* \sim$ 50 K, by X-ray
absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) at
the Os $L_{2,3}$ edge. The cubic ligand-field splitting between the $t_{2g}$
and $e_g$ levels of Os $5d$ was deduced by XAS to be $\sim$4 eV. The
temperature dependence of the XMCD spectra was consistent with a $\sim$18 meV
residual cubic splitting of the lowest $J_{\rm eff} =$ 2 multiplet state into
the non-Kramers $E_g$ doublet ground state and the $T_{2g}$ triplet excited
state. Ligand-field (LF) multiplet calculation under fictitious strong magnetic
fields indicated that the exchange interaction between nearest-neighbor
octupoles should be as strong as $\sim$1.5 meV if a ferro-octupole order is
stabilized in the `hidden-ordered' state, consistent with the exchange
interaction of $\sim$1 meV previously predicted theoretically using model and
density functional theory calculations.

Fe$_3$Ga$_4$ possesses a helical spin spiral with a complex competition
between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic ground states. This competition
generates multiple metamagnetic transitions that are governed by both applied
magnetic field and temperature. At intermediate temperatures between T$_1$ (68
K) and T$_2$ (360 K), the ferromagnetically aligned spins transition to an
antiferromagnetic spin spiral. In this study, magnetoresistance (MR)
measurements are performed on an aligned single crystal and compared to
magnetization properties in order to gain insight on the unique alignment of
the spins. The high-field MR is positive at low temperatures indicating
cyclotronic behavior and negative at high temperature from electron-magnon
scattering. Of particular significance is a large anomalous positive MR at low
fields, possibly due to emergent spin fluctuations thus prompting further
exploration of this multifaceted material.

### Excitons and Optical Response in Excitonic Insulator Candidate TiSe$_2$

The origin of the charge density wave (CDW) phase in TiSe$_2$ is a highly
debated topic, with lattice and excitonic correlations proposed as the main
driving mechanisms. One of the proposed scenarios is the excitonic insulator
(EI) mechanism, where soft electronic mode drives the phase transition.
However, the existence of this purely electronic mode is controversial. Here,
we perform fully ab-initio calculations of the electron excitation spectra in
TiSe$_2$ with electron-hole excitonic effects included via Bethe-Salpeter
equations. In the normal high-temperature phase the excitation spectra is
dominated by the exciton mode at 1.6 eV, while no well-defined soft electronic
modes that could support the EI phase are present. In the CDW phase, the
structural distortions induce a CDW band-gap opening between Ti-$d$ and Se-$p$
states, which supports the formation of the two low-energy excitonic modes in
the optical spectrum at 0.4 eV and 80 meV. Close to the transition temperature
$T_{\rm CDW}$, these two excitonic modes are softened and approach zero energy.
These results suggest that the EI mechanism is not a main driving force in the
formation of the CDW phase in TiSe$_2$, but there is a region in the phase
diagram near $T_{\rm CDW}$ where EI fluctuations could be relevant.

### Metallic Oxides and the Overlooked Role of Bandwidth

- **TL;DR**: 本文通过电子结构计算分析金属氧化物，发现带宽是决定金属性的关键因素，指出带宽小于1eV的化合物几乎不可能具有金属导电性，特别强调含氧阴离子化合物在常压下不太可能表现出金属导电性。

Oxides exhibiting metallic conduction are crucial for various applications,
including fuel cells, battery electrodes, resistive and magnetoresistive
materials, electrocatalysts, transparent conductors, and high-temperature
superconductors. Oxides that approach metallicity also play significant roles
in switching applications, where the metal-insulator transition phenomenon is
utilized across a range of technologies. This perspective, motivated by the
question of when oxides are metallic, employs electronic structure calculations
on metallic oxides to identify the typical feature in the electronic structures
that promote metallic behavior. The critical factor of the bandwidth of the
electronic energy bands near the Fermi energy is emphasized since it has been
somewhat overlooked in the literature. For example, bandwidth considerations
would suggest that the recently proposed phosphate "LK-99" would never be a
suitable target for superconductivity. From the analysis performed here, we
learn that if the width of the conduction band as obtained from density
functional theory-based electronic structure calculations is less than 1 eV,
then the likelihood of obtaining a metallic compound is vanishingly small. This
survey of representative oxide metals highlights the essential elements of
extended covalency that lead to wide bands. A key takeaway is that oxyanion
compounds such as borates, carbonates, silicates, sulfates, nitrates, and
phosphates are unlikely to exhibit metallic conduction at ambient pressure.
While the focus here is on oxides, the general findings should apply across
various material families, extending to organic crystals, polymers, and
framework materials.

- **TL;DR**: SMILE-CP是一种基于宏观偶极约束的电荷分配方法，仅使用原子坐标和总偶极矩来推断原子电荷，解决了电化学界面中热涨落干扰电场的问题。

Large thermal fluctuations of the liquid phase obscure the weak macroscopic
electric field that drives electrochemical reactions, rendering the extraction
of reliable interfacial charge distributions from ab initio molecular dynamics
extremely challenging. We introduce SMILE-CP (Scalar Macro-dipole Integrated
LEarning - Charge Partitioning), a macro-dipole-constrained scheme that infers
atomic charges using only the instantaneous atomic coordinates and the total
dipole moment of the simulation cell - quantities routinely available from
standard density-functional theory calculations. SMILE-CP preserves both the
global electrostatic field and the local potential without invoking any
explicit charge-partitioning scheme. Benchmarks on three representative
electrochemical interfaces - nanoconfined water, Mg2+ dissolution in water, and
a kinked Mg vicinal surface under anodic bias - show that SMILE-CP eliminates
the qualitative errors observed for unconstrained charge decompositions. The
method is computationally inexpensive and data-efficient, opening the door to
charge-aware machine-learning potentials capable of bias-controlled,
nanosecond-scale simulations of realistic electrochemical systems.

- **TL;DR**: 研究2+1维Z2对称保护拓扑相在非可定向克莱因瓶上的对称响应，发现沿保向循环插入对称缺陷时基态获得额外电荷，且在相变点保持精确二重简并度。

Manifolds with nontrivial topology play an essential role in the study of
topological phases of matter. In this paper, we study the nontrivial symmetry
response of the $2+1$D $Z_2$ symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase when
the system is put on a non-orientable manifold -- the Klein bottle. In
particular, we find that when a symmetry defect is inserted along the
orientation-reserving cycle of the Klein bottle, the ground state of the system
gets an extra charge. This response remains well defined at transition points
into the trivial SPT phase, resulting in an exact two-fold degeneracy in the
ground state independent of the system size. We demonstrate the symmetry
response using exactly solvable lattice models of the SPT phase, as well as
numerical work across the transition. We explore the connection of this result
to the modular transformation of the $3+1$D $Z_2$ gauge theory and the emergent
nature of the parity symmetry in the $Z_2$ SPT phase.

### Microscopic origin of the magnetic easy-axis switching in Fe3GaTe2 under pressure

- **TL;DR**: 通过第一性原理计算揭示了Fe3GaTe2在约10 GPa压力下磁易轴从面外转向面内的微观机制，主要源于FeI原子的自旋轨道耦合贡献减小并改变符号，以及Te原子贡献的持续减弱。

The two-dimensional layered ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2, composed of a
Te-FeI-FeII/Ga-FeI-Te stacking sequence, hosts two inequivalent Fe sites and
exhibits a high Curie temperature and strong out-of-plane magneticanisotropy,
making it a promising platform for spintronic applications. Recent experiments
have observed a pressure-induced switching of the magnetic easy axis from
out-of-plane to in-plane near 10 GPa, though its microscopic origin remains
unclear. Here, we employ first-principles calculations to investigate the
pressure dependence of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy in Fe3GaTe2.
Our results reveal a clear easy-axis switching at a critical pressure of
approximately 10 GPa, accompanied by a sharp decrease in the magnetic moments
arising from FeI and FeII atoms. As pressure increases, spin-up and spin-down
bands broaden and shift oppositely due to band dispersion effects, leading to a
reduction in net magnetization. Simultaneously, the SOC contribution from FeI,
which initially favors an out-of-plane easy axis, diminishes and ultimately
changes sign, thereby promoting in-plane anisotropy. The SOC contribution from
the outer-layer Te atoms also decreases steadily with pressure, although it
retains its original sign; this additional reduction further reinforces the
in-plane magnetic easy axis. In contrast, FeII atoms continue to favor an
out-of-plane orientation, but their contribution is insufficient to
counterbalance the dominant in-plane preference at high pressure. These
findings elucidate the origin of magnetic easy-axis switching in Fe3GaTe2 and
provide insights for tuning magnetic anisotropy in layered materials for
spintronic applications.

We review and obtain some new results on the temperature dependence of
spatially nonlocal response functions of graphene and their applications to
calculation of both the equilibrium and nonequilibrium Casimir and
Casimir-Polder forces. After a brief summary of the properties of the
polarization tensor of graphene obtained within Dirac model in the framework of
quantum field theory, we derive the expressions for the longitudinal and
transverse dielectric functions. The behavior of these functions at different
temperatures is investigated in the regions below and above the threshold.
Special attention is paid to the double pole at zero frequency which is present
in the transverse response function of graphene. An application of the response
functions of graphene to calculation of the equilibrium Casimir force between
two graphene sheets and Casimir-Polder forces between an atom (nanoparticle)
and a graphene sheet is considered with due attention to the role of a nonzero
energy gap, chemical potential and a material substrate underlying the graphene
sheet. The same subject is discussed for out-of-thermal-equilibrium Casimir and
Casimir-Polder forces. The role of the obtained and presented results for
fundamental science and nanotechnology is outlined.

Strong-field terahertz (THz) excitations enable dynamic control over
electronic, lattice and symmetry degrees of freedom in quantum materials. Here,
we uncover pronounced terahertz-induced symmetry modulations and coherent
phonon dynamics in the van der Waals antiferromagnet MnPS3, in which inversion
symmetry is broken by its antiferromagnetic spin configuration. Time-resolved
second harmonic generation measurements reveal long-lived giant oscillations in
the antiferromagnetic phase, with amplitudes comparable to the equilibrium
signal, driven by phonons involving percent-level atomic displacements relative
to the equilibrium bond lengths. The temporal evolution of the rotational
anisotropy patterns indicate a dynamic breaking of mirror symmetry, modulated
by two vibrational modes at 1.7 THz and 4.5 THz, with the former corresponding
to a hidden mode not observed in equilibrium spectroscopy. We show that these
effects arise in part from a field-induced charge rearrangement mechanism that
lowers the local crystal symmetry, and couples to the phonon modes. A
long-lived field-driven response was uncovered with a complex THz polarization
dependence which, in comparison to theory, indicates evidence for an
antiferromagnetic-to-ferrimagnetic transition. Our results establish an
effective field-tunable pathway for driving excitations otherwise weak in
equilibrium, and for manipulating magnetism in low-dimensional materials via
dynamical modulation of symmetry.

The exploration of transverse electromagnetic responses in solids with broken
spatial-inversion (I) and/or time-reversal (T) symmetries has unveiled numerous
captivating phenomena, including the (anomalous) Hall effect, Faraday
rotations, non-reciprocal directional dichroism, and off-diagonal linear
magnetoelectricity, all within the framework of magnetotoroidicity. Here, we
introduce a novel class of transverse electromagnetic responses originating
from electrotoroidicity in ferro-rotational (FR) systems with preserved I and T
symmetries, distinct from magnetotoroidicity. We discover a high-order
off-diagonal magnetic susceptibility of FR domains and a reduced linear
diagonal magnetic susceptibility at FR domain walls in doped ilmenite FeTiO3.
The non-trivial "Hall-like" effect of the former corresponds to an anomalous
transverse susceptibility in the presence of spontaneous electrotoroidal
moments in FR materials. Our findings unveil an emergent type of transverse
electromagnetic responses even in I and T symmetry-conserved conditions and
illustrate new functionalities of abundant FR materials.

We develop a unified viscous hydrodynamics for charge and valley transport in
gapped graphene in the quantum Hall regime. We redefine Hall viscosity as a
response to static electric-field gradients instead of strain, establishing a
derivative hierarchy that fundamentally links it to nonlocal Hall conductivity.
The theory predicts quantized Hall viscosity for charge and valley, including a
ground-state contribution. Crucially, the valley current is unaffected by the
Lorentz force and is directly accessible via the local pressure, namely the
electrostatic potential that tracks fluid vorticity.

### Breakdown of Stoner Ferromagnetism by Intrinsic Altermagnetism

The Stoner criterion for ferromagnetism arises from interaction-driven
asymmetric filling of spin bands, requiring that the spin susceptibility: (i)
peaks dominantly at $\mathbf{Q}=\bm{0}$; and (ii) diverges at a critical
interaction strength. Here, we demonstrate that this Stoner mechanism breaks
down due to competition with altermagnetic orders, even when both conditions
are met. Altermagnetism in solids is characterized by collinear antiparallel
spin alignment that preserves translational symmetry, and inherently fulfills
these requirements. As a proof of concept, we study a two-orbital Hubbard model
with electron filling near Van Hove singularities at high-symmetry momenta. Our
results reveal that orbital-resolved spin fluctuations, amplified by strong
inter-orbital hopping, stabilize intrinsic altermagnetic order. A quantum phase
transition from altermagnetism to ferromagnetism occurs at critical Hund's
coupling $J_H$. We further propose directional spin conductivity anisotropy as
a detectable signature of this transition via non-local spin transport. This
work establishes the pivotal role of altermagnetism in correlated systems.

### Atomic networks as highways for holes in oxygen-deficient amorphous oxides

- **TL;DR**: 氧缺陷非晶碲氧化物(a-TeO_x)通过自发分离形成相互渗透的a-Te和a-TeO_2区域，而非分散氧空位，从而提供空穴传导路径，实现高迁移率。

Oxygen-deficient amorphous tellurium oxides ($a$-TeO$_x$) have recently
challenged the intrinsic hole mobility limits of amorphous oxides, with
thin-film transistors reaching mobilities up to 15 cm$^{2}$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$
upon Se doping. However, the atomistic origins of this behavior, and its
seeming contradiction with established semiconductor physics, have remained
unresolved. Here, we combine machine-learning-accelerated ab initio molecular
dynamics with hybrid-functional defect calculations to establish a new
microscopic picture. We show that substantial oxygen loss drives spontaneous
segregation into interpenetrating $a$-Te and $a$-TeO$_2$ domains, rather than
forming dispersed oxygen vacancies. The diffuse Te-$5p$ states from the $a$-Te
network supply percolative pathways for holes, so mobility rises monotonically
with oxygen deficiency, enabling mobilities that exceed current records. Doped
Se incorporates into the $a$-Te domain, enhancing the connectivity of
conductive pathways, thereby increasing hole mobility. Similar behavior in
amorphous SeO$_x$ suggests domain percolation as a general route to
high-mobility p-type transport in amorphous oxides.

We report an experimental study of a Si/SiGe double quantum dot (DQD)
directly coupled to a niobium superconducting coplanar stripline (CPS)
microwave resonator. This hybrid architecture enables high-bandwidth dispersive
readout suitable for real-time feedback and error-correction protocols. Fast
and sensitive readout is achieved primarily by optimizing the DQD gate lever
arm, guided by MaSQE quantum dot simulations, which enhances the dispersive
signal without requiring high-impedance resonators. We demonstrate a
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of unity with an integration time of 34.54
nanoseconds, corresponding to a system bandwidth of 14.48 MHz and a charge
sensitivity of 0.000186 e per square root hertz. Analysis of the voltage power
spectral density (PSD) of the in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) baseband signals
characterizes the system's readout noise, with the PSD's dependence on
integration time providing insight into distinct physical regimes.

Rhombohedral or ABC stacked multilayer graphene hosts a correlated magnetic
ground state at charge neutrality, making it one of the simplest systems to
investigate strong electronic correlations. We investigate this ground state in
multilayer graphene structures using the Hubbard model in a distance dependent
Slater-Koster tight binding framework. We show that by using a universal
Hubbard-$U$ term, we can accurately capture the spin polarization predicted by
hybrid density functional theory calculations for both hexagonal (ABA) and
rhombohedral (ABC) stackings. Using this $U$ value, we calculate the magnetic
moments of 3-8 layers of ABC and ABA graphene multilayers. We demonstrate that
the structure and magnitude of these magnetic moments are robust when
heterostructures are built from varying numbers of ABC and ABA multilayers. By
applying different types of mechanical distortions, we study the behaviour of
the magnetism in graphene systems under uniaxial strain and pressure. Our
results establish a computationally efficient framework to investigate
correlation-driven magnetism across arbitrary stacking configurations of
graphite polytypes.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文提出了轨道交替磁性的概念，这是一种由对称性保护的纯轨道自由度磁序，具有实空间反平行轨道磁矩和动量依赖的轨道能带劈裂特征。

We introduce the concept of \emph{orbital altermagnetism}, a
symmetry-protected magnetic order of pure orbital degrees of freedom. It is
characterized with ordered anti-parallel orbital magnetic moments in real space
but momentum-dependent orbital band splittings, analogous to spin
altermagnetism. Using a minimal tight-binding model with complex hoppings in a
square-kagome lattice, we show that such order inherently arises from staggered
loop currents, producing a $d$-wave-like orbital-momentum locking.
First-principles calculations show that orbital altermagnetism emerges
independent of spin ordering in in-plane ferromagnets of CuBr$_2$ and VS$_2$,
so that it can be unambiguously identified experimentally. On the other hand,
it may also coexist with spin altermagnetism, such as in monolayer MoO and CrO.
The orbital altermagnetism offers an alternative platform for symmetry-driven
magnetotransport and orbital-based spintronics, as exemplified by large
nonlinear current-induced orbital magnetization.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究发现在MoS2/WS2范德华异质结中，WS2的A1g拉曼模式表现出对扭转角的依赖性增强，而其他模式没有明显增强。这种选择性增强与层间距离密切相关，源于异质层中A1g本征矢量的特殊分布特性。

When combined into van der Waals heterostructures, transition metal
dichalcogenide monolayers enable the exploration of novel physics beyond their
unique individual properties. However, for interesting phenomena such as
interlayer charge transfer and interlayer excitons to occur, precise control of
the interface and ensuring high-quality interlayer contact is crucial. Here, we
investigate bilayer heterostructures fabricated by combining
chemical-vapor-deposition-grown MoS$_2$ and exfoliated WS$_2$ monolayers,
allowing us to form several heterostructures with various twist angles within
one preparation step. In case of sufficiently good interfacial contact,
evaluated by photoluminescence quenching, we observe a twist-angle-dependent
enhancement of the WS$_2$ A$_{1g}$ Raman mode. In contrast, other WS$_2$ and
MoS$_2$ Raman modes (in particular, the MoS$_2$ A$_{1g}$ mode) do not show a
clear enhancement under the same experimental conditions. We present a
systematic study of this mode-selective effect using nonresonant Raman
measurements that are complemented with ab-initio calculations of Raman
spectra. We find that the selective enhancement of the WS$_2$ A$_{1g}$ mode
exhibits a strong dependence on interlayer distance. We show that this
selectivity is related to the A$_{1g}$ eigenvectors in the heterolayer: the
eigenvectors are predominantly localized on one of the two layers; yet, the
intensity of the MoS$_2$ mode is attenuated because the WS$_2$ layer is
vibrating (albeit with much lower amplitude) out of phase, while the WS$_2$
mode is amplified because the atoms on the MoS$_2$ layer are vibrating in
phase. To separate this eigenmode effect from resonant Raman enhancement, our
study is extended with near-resonant Raman measurements.

- **TL;DR**: CrSb作为反铁磁材料，在不同晶向的超薄薄膜中表现出不同的自旋分裂特性：(100)取向为自旋简并，(0001)取向需自旋轨道耦合才能产生70meV分裂，而(110)取向具有400meV的强交换驱动自旋分裂。

Altermagnets exhibit momentum-dependent spin splitting without net
magnetization, combining characteristics of both ferromagnets and
antiferromagnets, making them highly interesting for spintronics applications.
CrSb is a prime candidate with a high N\'eel temperature ($\sim700$~K) and a
large exchange-driven splitting of $\sim0.6$--1~eV. Using ab-initio
calculations, we consider slabs of various orientations in the ultrathin limit.
We find that (100) oriented slabs have spin-degenerate bands. In (0001)
oriented slabs, the exchange-driven altermagnetic spin splitting collapses, but
including spin-orbit coupling restores a residual anisotropic splitting of
$\sim70$~meV. In contrast, the (110) oriented slabs show an altermagnetic spin
splitting of $\sim400$~meV, and emerges as a robust candidate for realizing
large, exchange-driven altermagnetism

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一个用于从结构数据预测多电荷态缺陷形成能的通用机器学习框架，包括数据归一化、费米能级对齐和扰动宿主态处理，并成功应用于氧空位形成能预测和虚拟筛选。

Recent advances in materials informatics have expanded the number of
synthesizable materials. However, screening promising candidates, such as
semiconductors, based on defect properties remains challenging. This is
primarily due to the lack of a general framework for predicting defect
formation energies in multiple charge states from structural data. In this
Letter, we present a protocol, namely data normalization, Fermi level
alignment, and treatment of perturbed host states, and validate it by
accurately predicting oxygen vacancy formation energies in three charge states
using a single model. We also introduce a joint machine-learning model that
integrates defect formation energies and band-edge predictions for virtual
screening. Using this framework, we identify 89 hole-dopable oxides, including
BaGaSbO, a potential ambipolar photovoltaic material. Our protocol is expected
to become a standard approach for machine-learning studies on point defect
formation energies.

### On the mechanism of ferromagnetic resonance in ferromagnet-superconductor trilayers

Temperature dependent magnetic properties of
superconductor-ferromagnet-superconductor (SC/FM/SC) trilayers are studied both
experimentally and theoretically, with a focus on ferromagnetic resonance
(FMR). The influence of the SC and FM layer thicknesses on the FMR field is
examined. To differentiate the mechanisms involved, we additionally investigate
structures containing nonmagnetic metallic (M) or insulating (I) spacers
(SC/FM/M/SC or SC/FM/I/SC). All the studied multilayers show large reductions
in the FMR field below the critical temperature of the SC, except the system
containing an insulating spacer (SC/FM/I/SC). This SC-induced FMR-shift
(resonance field/frequency) is larger for thicker SC as well as FM layers,
reaching a saturation value for very large thicknesses. To explain the measured
results, an analytical model is developed, in which the FM-magnetization
precession modulates the magnetic flux in the system, thereby inducing an
alternating supercurrent in the SC, which in turn produces a dynamic
back-action magnetic field on the FM that shifts its resonance frequency. The
model considers closed current loops, where the FM layer conductively links the
supercurrents flowing in the opposite directions in the two outer SC layers.
Our results provide a practical route for increasing the operating frequency of
magnonic devices.

### Interacting spin and charge density waves in kagome metal FeGe

- **TL;DR**: 该研究揭示了FeGe材料中自旋密度波(SDW)和电荷密度波(CDW)之间的相互作用，发现即使在没有静态CDW有序的样品中，低能自旋激发仍与晶格存在动态耦合。

Unveiling the interplay between spin density wave (SDW) and charge density
wave (CDW) orders in correlated electron materials is important to obtain a
comprehensive understanding of their electronic, structural, and magnetic
properties. Kagome lattice materials are interesting because their flat
electronic bands, Dirac points, and van Hove singularities can enable a variety
of exotic electronic and magnetic phenomena. The kagome metal FeGe, which
exhibits a CDW order deep within an A-type antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase, was
found to respond dramatically to post-growth annealing - with the ability to
tune the CDW repeatedly from long-range order to no (or extremely weak) order.
Additionally, neutron scattering studies suggest that incommensurate magnetic
peaks that onsets at $T_{Canting}$ = $T_{SDW} \approx$ 60 K in the system arise
from a SDW order instead of the AFM double cone structure. Here we use
inelastic neutron scattering to show two distinct spin excitations exist below
$T_{Canting}$ corresponding to two coexisting magnetic orders in the system in
both sets of annealed samples with and without CDW. While CDW order or no order
can dramatically affect the onset temperature of $T_{Canting}$ and elastic
incommensurate magnetic scattering, its impact on low-energy spin fluctuations
is more limited. In both samples, a pair of gapless incommensurate spin
excitations arising from the SDW order wavevector coexist with gapped
commensurate spin waves from the A-type AFM order across $T_{Canting}$.
Low-energy spin excitations for both samples couple dynamically to the lattice
through enhanced magnetic scattering intensity on cooling below $T_{CDW}$,
regardless the status of the static long-range CDW order. The incommensurate
SDW order in the long-range CDW ordered sample also induces a tiny in-plane
lattice distortion of the kagome lattice that is absent in the no CDW ordered
sample.

### Non-Hermitian Skin Effect and Electronic Nonlocal Transport

Open quantum systems governed by non-Hermitian effective Hamiltonians exhibit
unique phenomena, such as the non-Hermitian skin effect, where eigenstates
localize at system boundaries. We investigate this effect in a Rashba nanowire
coupled to a ferromagnetic lead and demonstrate that it can be detected via
non-local transport spectroscopy: while local conductance remains symmetric,
the non-local conductance becomes non-reciprocal. We account for this behavior
using both conventional transport arguments and the framework of non-Hermitian
physics. Furthermore, we explain that exceptional points shift in parameter
space when transitioning from periodic to open boundary conditions, a
phenomenon observed in other non-Hermitian systems but so far not explained.
Our results establish transport spectroscopy as a tool to probe non-Hermitian
effects in open electronic systems.

### Spontaneous lattice distortion and crystal field effects in HoB4

- **TL;DR**: HoB4在7.1K和5.7K发生反铁磁相变，并在TN2以下从四方晶系转变为单斜晶系，这是四极有序的宏观表现。

The tetraboride HoB4 crystallizes in a tetragonal structure (space group
P4/mbm), with the Ho atoms realizing a Shastry-Sutherland lattice. It orders
antiferromagnetically at TN1 = 7.1 K and undergoes further magnetic transition
at TN2 = 5.7 K. The complex magnetic structures are attributed to competing
order parameters of magnetic and quadrupolar origin with significant
magnetoelastic coupling. Here, we investigate the response of the lattice of
HoB4 across the antiferromagnetic phase transitions by using low-temperature
powder x-ray diffraction and ultrasound-velocity measurements, supported by
crystal electric field (CEF) calculations. Below TN2, the crystal structure of
HoB4 changes to monoclinic (space group P21/b) as a macroscopic manifestation
of the quadrupolar ordering. Between 300 and 3.5 K, the total distortion
amplitude is 0.46~\AA\ and the relative volume change is $3.5 \times 10^{-3}$.
This structural phase transition is compatible with the huge softening of the
modulus $C_{44}$ observed around TN2 due to ferroquadrupolar order. A lattice
instability developing immediately below TN1 is seen consistently in x-ray and
ultrasound data. CEF analysis suggests a quasi-degenerated ground state for the
Ho$^{3+}$ ions in this system.

### Possible evidence for Harper broadening in the yellow exciton series of Cu2O at ultrahigh magnetic fields

- **TL;DR**: 在高达500T的超强磁场下研究Cu2O中黄色激子系列的磁吸收特性，发现激子有效质量减小，并在300T以上观察到可能的Harper展宽现象，表明有效质量近似失效。

Hydrogen-like systems in ultra-high magnetic fields are of significant
interest in interdisciplinary research. Previous studies have focused on the
exciton wavefunction shrinkage under magnetic fields down to artificial crystal
lattices (e.g., quantum wells, superlattices), where the effective mass
approximation remains valid. However, further compression toward the natural
crystal lattice scale remains experimentally challenging. In this study, we
report magneto-absorption measurements on the yellow-exciton series in Cu2O
using pulsed magnetic fields of up to 500 T. The strong low energy absorption
features are assigned to the spin Zeeman split 2p0 and 3p0 exciton states. The
high field data provides a value for the reduced effective mass of the exciton
u* = 0.415 \pm 0.01me. Intriguingly, the broadening of the 2p0 ground state
transition exhibits a sudden increase for ultrahigh magnetic fields above 300
T, providing possible evidence for Harper broadening - an indication of the
breakdown of the effective mass approximation when the magnetic length becomes
comparable to the lattice constant of the crystal.

### Anisotropic linear magnetoresistance in Dirac semimetal NiTe2 nanoflakes

- **TL;DR**: 该研究揭示了NiTe2纳米片中存在两种不同的线性磁阻机制：垂直磁场下的经典起源和水平磁场下的非经典起源，后者与狄拉克点附近的非线性能带效应相关。

This work investigates the magneto-transport properties of exfoliated NiTe2
nano-flakes with varying thicknesses and disorder levels, unveiling two
distinct physical mechanisms governing the observed anisotropic linear
magnetoresistance (MR). For the perpendicular magnetic field configuration, the
well-defined linear MR in high fields is unambiguously attributed to a
classical origin. This conclusion is supported by the proportionality between
the MR slope and the carrier mobility, and between the crossover field and the
inverse of mobility. In stark contrast, the linear MR under parallel magnetic
fields exhibits a non-classical character. It shows a pronounced enhancement
with decreasing flake thickness, which correlates with an increasing
hole-to-electron concentration ratio. This distinctive thickness dependence
suggests an origin in the nonlinear band effects near the Dirac point, likely
driven by the shift of the Fermi level. Furthermore, the strengthening of MR
anisotropic with enhanced inter-layer transport contradicts the prediction of
the guiding-center diffusion model for three-dimensional systems. Our findings
highlight the critical roles of band topology and structural dimensional in the
anomalous magneto-transport of Dirac semi-metals.

- **TL;DR**: 开发了一种卷积神经网络，通过少量训练即可从衍射数据中分类极化方向并在实空间分割铁电畴，同时引入自适应采样策略提高训练效率和准确性。

Polarization in ferroelectric domains arises from atomic-scale structural
variations that govern macroscopic functionalities. The interfaces between
these domains known as domain walls host distinct physical responses, making
their identification and control critical. Four dimensional scanning
transmission electron microscopy (4DSTEM) enables simultaneous acquisition of
real and reciprocal-space information at the atomic scale, offering a powerful
platform for domain mapping. However, conventional analyses rely on
computationally intensive processing and manual interpretation, which are time
consuming and prone to misalignment and diffraction artefacts. Here, we present
a convolutional neural network that, with minimal training, classifies
polarization directions from diffraction data and segments domains in real
space. We further introduce an adaptive sampling strategy that prioritizes
images from domain wall regions, reducing the number of training images
required while improving accuracy and interpretability. We demonstrate this
approach for domain mapping in ferroelectric boracite, Cu3B7O13Cl.

### Temperature anomaly of the V$_Si$ and V$_C$ vacancy spin coherence time in 4H-SiC

Increasing the spin coherence time (T2) is a major area of interest for spin
defect systems such as the silicon (V$_Si$) and carbon (V$^\pm _C$) vacancies
in 4H-SiC. Usually as temperature increases, T2 decreases due to the thermal
bath. Observations of electron-paramagnetic resonance and direct systematic
measurements of T2 has seen an anomaly where T2 increases with increasing
temperature. In this work, we investigate the mechanisms that cause the T2
temperature anomaly. We find that due to a spontaneous symmetry lowering from a
motional Jahn-Teller distortion, a polaron quasi-particle is generated from the
vibronic coupling. Initially, for temperatures from 8 to 20 - 40K, the
coherence temperature dependence is dominated by phonon-assisted spin
relaxation. At temperatures around 20 - 40K, depending on the vacancy, a
thermally activated polaron hopping turns on and motional narrowing dominates
and increases T2 with increasing temperature. As temperatures reach 120 - 160K,
the energy barrier gets high enough to slow the polaron hopping. At this point
the Larmor precession dominates, leading to decoherence. Our calculated
temperature-dependent coherence agrees with what has been seen experimentally,
giving a full theoretical framework for the mechanisms that cause the T2
temperature anomaly of increasing T2 with increasing temperature. The
theoretical framework presented here also gives insight into these mechanisms
being a probable universal phenomenon that could occur in many other defect
center spin systems.

### Three-fold Superstructured Superlattice HfN/HfAlN Thin Films for Enhanced Toughness

To simultaneously achieve high hardness and high toughness in protective
coatings remains a fundamental challenge. Here, we harness the superlattice
architecture to combine Koehler hardening while the coherent interfaces reduce
the crack driving force and improve toughness, enabling coatings that are both
hard and damage tolerant. We design and fabricate epitaxial
HfN$_{1.33}$/Hf$_{0.76}$Al$_{0.24}$N$_{1.15}$ superlattices, deposited on
MgO(001) substrates using low-energy, high-flux ion-assisted reactive magnetron
sputtering. These superlattices with bilayer periods ranging from 6 to 20 nm,
exhibit a unique three-fold superstructure, confirmed by X-ray diffraction and
reciprocal space mapping (RSM). Each constituent forms distinct 3D checkerboard
superstructures, with a period of 7.5 {\AA} for HfN and 12.5 A for HfAlN. RSMs
further reveal low mosaicity, high crystalline quality, and in-plane
compressive strains, indicating well preserved coherence across interfaces.
Mechanical testing shows that the superlattices maintain the high hardness of
HfAlN (\~36 GPa) independent of bilayer period, while surpassing the softer HfN
(~27 GPa), consistent with interface-driven Koehler strengthening. Micropillar
compression shows brittle fracture on the {110}&lt;110&gt; system, yet with
distributed cracking and faster mechanical recovery compared to monolithic
films, suggesting improved toughness. Cube-corner indentation further
corroborate this behavior, with pile-up and suppressed fracture events. These
results demonstrate that epitaxial HfN/HfAlN superlattices uniquely combine
high hardness with improved toughness, enabled by their three-fold
superstructured architecture. Leveraging the intrinsic high-temperature
stability of HfN-based materials, this design offers a robust pathway toward
next-generation protective coatings capable of maintaining performance under
extreme conditions.

In this study, using the Dirac continuum model combined with the
split-operator technique, we investigate the propagation dynamics of wave
packets in graphene in the presence of circular potential barriers arranged in
square and triangular geometries. Our results reveal a non-monotonic dependence
of the wave packet transmission on the number of barrier rows along the
propagation direction: the transmission initially decreases as rows of barriers
are removed, but then increases again when additional rows are eliminated. To
explain the observed nonlinear behavior, the time evolution of the transmission
probability is analyzed, providing insight into the interplay between wave
packet dynamics and the spatial arrangement of potential barriers. These
findings offer a pathway for designing graphene-based devices with tunable
transport properties through engineered potential landscapes.

Two-dimensional (2D) materials have shown broad application prospects in
fields such as energy, environment, and aerospace owing to their unique
electrical, mechanical, thermal and other properties. With the development of
artificial intelligence (AI), the discovery and design of novel 2D materials
have been significantly accelerated. However, due to the lack of basic theories
of material synthesis, identifying reliable synthesis processes for
theoretically designed materials is a challenge. The emergence of large
language model offers new approaches for the reliability prediction of material
synthesis processes. However, its development is limited by the lack of
publicly available datasets of material synthesis processes. To address this,
we present the Material Synthesis 2025 (MatSyn25), a large-scale open dataset
of 2D material synthesis processes. MatSyn25 contains 163,240 pieces of
synthesis process information extracted from 85,160 high-quality research
articles, each including basic material information and detailed synthesis
process steps. Based on MatSyn25, we developed MatSyn AI which specializes in
material synthesis, and provided an interactive web platform that enables
multifaceted exploration of the dataset (https://matsynai.stpaper.cn/).
MatSyn25 is publicly available, allowing the research community to build upon
our work and further advance AI-assisted materials science.

Magnetically doped topological insulators (TIs) exhibit two distinct phases:
the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) phase when the Fermi level resides within the
surface gap, and a metallic phase outside the gap. The QAH phase hosts
unidirectional transport channels known as chiral edge states, while the
metallic phase exhibits non-reciprocal transport due to unbalanced
bidirectional edge states. Utilizing the chiral edge states in Cr-doped (Bi,
Sb)2Te3 sandwich structures, we realize non-Hermitian conductance matrices in a
one-dimensional Corbino chain with well-defined chirality. By tuning the
boundary conditions from open to periodic, we reveal the non-Hermitian skin
effect, where eigenstates localize exponentially at one end of the chain. In
the metallic phase, we further observe asymmetric, bidirectional coupling
between the neighboring sites in the conductance matrix, a direct consequence
of the system's intrinsic non-reciprocity. These results establish magnetic TIs
as a powerful platform for investigating emergent non-Hermitian phenomena in
topological systems.

In density functional theory (DFT), the ground state charge density is the
fundamental variable which determines all other ground state properties. Many
machine learning charge density models are developed by prior efforts, which
have been proven useful to accelerate DFT calculations. Yet they all use the
total charge density (TCD) as the training target. In this work, we advocate
predicting difference charge density (DCD) instead. We term this simple
technique by $\Delta$-SAED, which leverages the prior physical information of
superposition of atomic electron densities (SAED). The robustness of
$\Delta$-SAED is demonstrated through evaluations over diverse benchmark
datasets, showing an extra accuracy gain for more than 90% structures in the
test sets. Using a Si allotropy dataset, $\Delta$-SAED is demonstrated to
advance model's transferability to chemical accuracy for non-self-consistent
calculations. By incorporating physical priors to compensate for the limited
expressive power of machine learning models, $\Delta$-SAED offers a cost-free
yet robust approach to improving charge density prediction and enhancing

Colloidal nanocrystal quantum dots (QD) enable the bottom-up assembly of
designer solids. Among the multitudinous applications of QD solids, there has
been great success in exploiting the tunable optical properties for LED
displays, lighting, bioimaging and diagnostics. Applications dependent on
electrical properties such as solar cells, photodetectors, and transistors have
fallen short of their full potential because of poor control over electrical
properties, and some of applications with the most promise for novelty, such as
a solid-state quantum simulator for quantum computation and spintronics, are
stagnant. Lack of clarity on the charge transport mechanism has been a
significant barrier to progress, particularly as numerous sources of disorder
are present. In this work, we make advancements in a nano-patterning technique
to fabricate a 70-nm wide QD solid that is also free of several sources of
structural defects. Owing to the small size and structural integrity, we
isolate the charge dynamics of a single conductance channel within a
percolation network. We tune parameters to measure ~10 channels, and with a
time-resolved measurement, we find conductance noise that exceeds 100% of the
average current. From observation of the long-time dynamics of the charge
transport, including random telegraph noise, colored noise and attractor
states, we model the transport with stochastic quasi-one-dimensional
percolation paths. With this insight into the charge transport of QD solids
unimpeded by structural defects, we provide a path for the rational design of a
QD solid with electrical properties that reflect the underlying tunable,
periodic potential.

- **TL;DR**: 本文揭示了传统光电子产额光谱(PYS)在评估有机半导体带隙态密度时的局限性，提出了恒定终态产额光谱(CFS-YS)作为更可靠的方法来准确测定带隙态密度。

Accurate determination of electronic states with low density in the bandgap
(in-gap states) is crucial for understanding and optimizing the performance of
organic optoelectronic devices. In the device research field, photoelectron
yield spectroscopy (PYS) has been widely used to evaluate such states, and its
derivative is commonly employed to estimate the density of states (DOS).
However, low-energy photons in PYS can generate excitons and anions in organic
semiconductors, raising questions about whether derivative PYS spectra truly
represent the DOS. Here, we applied hv-dependent high-sensitivity ultraviolet
photoelectron spectroscopy with low-energy photons to probe the origin of
photoelectrons in organic semiconductors. We show that PYS signals arise from
the single-quantum external photoelectron effect (SQEPE) of in-gap states, from
SQEPE of the singly occupied molecular orbital (SOMO) in anions, and biphotonic
electron emission (BEE) effect via exciton fusions. Because the BEE signal
masks the DOS, derivative PYS can misestimate the DOS of in-gap states. In
contrast, constant final state yield spectroscopy (CFS-YS) can reliably
determine the DOS. For example, in Tris(8-hydroxyquinoline) aluminum (Alq3), we
observed BEE, and CFS-YS revealed the DOS of in-gap states and SOMO over six
orders of magnitude. The direct determination of the SOMO DOS allowed us to
clarify the role of Alq3 in the electron injection layer in organic
light-emitting diodes. Moreover, the BEE process can act as both a
carrier-generation and degradation pathway in organic optoelectronic devices.
These findings demonstrate that CFS-YS provides a reliable method to determine
the DOS of in-gap states and to probe exciton and/or anion interactions. We
establish practical guidelines for determining the DOS of in-gap states for
low-energy photon measurements, such as examining photon-flux dependence.

- **TL;DR**: 研究聚焦离子束系统中单离子注入的检测效率，通过多种离子种类和基底的组合实验，展示了如何通过参数选择实现&gt;90%的检测效率，特别是Sb团簇注入可达100%检测效率。

Single ion implantation using focused ion beam systems enables high spatial
resolution and maskless doping for rapid and scalable engineering of materials
for quantum technologies, particularly qubits and colour centres in solid-state
hosts. In such applications, the confidence with which a single ion can be
deterministically implanted is crucial, and so the efficiency of the detection
mechanism is a vital parameter. Here, we present a study of the single-ion
detection efficiency for a variety of ion species (Si, P, Mn, Co, Ge, Sb, Au
and Bi) into various hosts (Si, SiO2, Al2O3, GaAs, diamond and SiC). The effect
of varying ion mass, charge and kinetic energy are studied, in addition to the
cluster implantation of Sb, Au and Bi. We demonstrate that it is possible to
achieve detection efficiencies &gt;90% for a wide range of ion species and
substrate combination through selection of the implantation parameters.
Furthermore, detection efficiencies of 100% are found for the doping of Sb
clusters which is of direct relevance for the future fabrication of quantum
devices.
