The effective deployment and application of advanced methodologies for
quantum chemistry is inherently linked to the optimal usage of emerging and
highly diversified computational resources. This paper examines the synergistic
utilization of Micron memory technologies and Azure Quantum Element cloud
computing in Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) simulations leveraging
coupled-cluster (CC) downfolded/effective Hamiltonians based on the double
unitary coupled cluster (DUCC) Ansatz. We analyze the performance of the
DMRG-DUCC workflow, emphasizing the proper choice of hardware that reflects the
numerical overheads associated with specific components of the workflow. We
report a hybrid approach that takes advantage of Micron CXL hardware for the
memory capacity intensive CC downfolding phase while employing AQE cloud
computing for the less resource-intensive DMRG simulations. Furthermore, we
analyze the performance of the scalable ExaChem suite of electronic simulations
conducted on Micron prototype systems.

### Multiscale analysis of large twist ferroelectricity and swirling dislocations in bilayer hexagonal boron nitride

- **TL;DR**: 该论文研究了异质变形双层六方氮化硼在大异质变形下的铁电性，发现AA堆叠和Σ7堆叠附近的构型都存在面外铁电性，并开发了双晶学信息框架不变多尺度模型来预测大单元胞异质结构中的铁电性。

With its atomically thin structure and intrinsic ferroelectric properties,
heterodeformed bilayer hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has gained prominence in
next-generation non-volatile memory applications. However, studies to date have
focused almost exclusively on small heterodeformations, leaving the question of
whether ferroelectricity can persist under large heterodeformation entirely
unexplored. In this work, we establish the crystallographic origin of
ferroelectricity in bilayer hBN configurations heterodeformed relative to
high-symmetry configurations such as the AA-stacking and the 21.786789 $\circ$
twisted configuration, using Smith normal form bicrystallography. We then
demonstrate out-of-plane ferroelectricity in bilayer hBN across configurations
vicinal to both the AA and $\Sigma 7$ stacking. Atomistic simulations reveal
that AA-vicinal systems support ferroelectricity under both small twist and
small strain, with polarization switching in the latter governed by the
deformation of swirling dislocations rather than the straight interface
dislocations seen in the former. For $\Sigma 7$-vicinal systems, where reliable
interatomic potentials are lacking, we develop a
density-functional-theory-informed continuum framework--the
bicrystallography-informed frame-invariant multiscale (BFIM) model, which
captures out-of-plane ferroelectricity in heterodeformed configurations vicinal
to the $\Sigma 7$ stacking. Interface dislocations in these large
heterodeformed bilayer configurations exhibit markedly smaller Burgers vectors
compared to the interface dislocations in small-twist and small-strain bilayer
hBN. The BFIM model reproduces atomistic simulation results and provides a
powerful, computationally efficient framework for predicting ferroelectricity
in large-unit-cell heterostructures where atomistic simulations are
prohibitively expensive.

### Enhancing the Efficiency of Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory Calculations of Dynamic Response Properties

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种基于虚时密度-密度关联函数映射的方法，显著提高极端条件下X射线汤姆逊散射TDDFT模拟的计算效率，速度提升可达一个数量级。

X-ray Thomson scattering (XRTS) constitutes an essential technique for
diagnosing material properties under extreme conditions, such as high pressures
and intense laser heating. Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) is
one of the most accurate available ab initio methods for modeling XRTS spectra,
as well as a host of other dynamic material properties. However, strong thermal
excitations, along with the need to account for variations in temperature and
density as well as the finite size of the detector significantly increase the
computational cost of TDDFT simulations compared to ambient conditions. In this
work, we present a broadly applicable method for optimizing and enhancing the
efficiency of TDDFT calculations. Our approach is based on a one-to-one mapping
between the dynamic structure factor and the imaginary time density--density
correlation function, which naturally emerges in Feynman's path integral
formulation of quantum many-body theory. Specifically, we combine rigorous
convergence tests in the imaginary time domain with a constraints-based noise
attenuation technique to improve the efficiency of TDDFT modeling without the
introduction of any significant bias. As a result, we can report a speed-up by
up to an order of magnitude, thus potentially saving millions of CPU hours for
modeling a single XRTS measurement of matter under extreme conditions.

### Room-Temperature Superconductivity at 298 K in Ternary La-Sc-H System at High-pressure Conditions

- **TL;DR**: 首次在250-260 GPa高压下通过激光加热技术合成了室温超导体LaSc2H24，超导起始温度为271-298K，通过零电阻和磁场抑制Tc测量确认了超导性。

Room-temperature superconductor has been a century-long dream of humankind.
Recent research on hydrogen-based superconductors (e.g., CaH6, LaH10, etc.) at
high-pressure conditions lifts the record of superconducting critical
temperature (Tc) up to ~250 kelvin. We here report the experimental synthesis
of the first-ever room-temperature superconductor by compression on a mixture
of La-Sc alloy and ammonia borane at pressures of 250-260 gigapascals (GPa) via
a diamond anvil cell by a laser-heating technique. Superconductivity with an
onset temperature of 271-298 kelvin at 195-266 GPa is observed by the
measurement of zero electrical resistance and the suppression of Tc under
applied magnetic fields. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction data unambiguously
reveal that this superconductor crystallizes in a hexagonal structure with a
stoichiometry LaSc2H24, in excellent agreement with our previous prediction1.
Through thirteen reproducible experimental runs, we provide solid evidence of
the realization of a room-temperature superconductor for the first time,
marking a milestone in the field of superconductivity.

### Classification of Thouless pumps with non-invertible symmetries and implications for Floquet phases

- **TL;DR**: 本文研究了对称性保持的绝热和Floquet动力学，建立了绝热循环与可逆缺陷之间的对应关系，并利用模块范畴分类方法对Thouless泵浦进行了分类。

We study symmetry preserving adiabatic and Floquet dynamics of
one-dimensional systems. Using quasiadiabatic evolution, we establish a
correspondence between adiabatic cycles and invertible defects generated by
spatially truncated Thouless pump operators. Employing the classification of
gapped phases by module categories, we show that the Thouless pumps are
classified by the group of autoequivalences of the module category. We then
explicitly construct Thouless pump operators for minimal lattice models with
$\text{Vec}_G$, Rep($G$), and Rep($H$) symmetries, and show how the Thouless
pump operators have the group structure of autoequivalences. The Thouless pump
operators, together with Hamiltonians with gapped ground states, are then used
to construct Floquet drives. An analytic solution for the Floquet phase diagram
characterized by winding numbers is constructed when the Floquet drives obey an
Onsager algebra. Our approach points the way to a general connection between
distinct Thouless pumps and distinct families of Floquet phases.

### Coupling Magnons to an Opto-Electronic Parametric Oscillator

- **TL;DR**: 该论文提出了一种将光电子振荡器与磁振子振荡器集成的新混合平台，实现了磁振子模式与光电子振荡器光子模式之间的强相干耦合，为构建分布式混合磁振子系统提供了新途径。

Hybrid magnonic systems have emerged as versatile modular components for
quantum signal transduction and sensing applications owing to their capability
of connecting distinct quantum platforms. To date, the majority of the magnonic
systems have been explored in a local, near-field scheme, due to the close
proximity required for realizing a strong coupling between magnons and other
excitations. This constraint greatly limits the applicability of magnons in
developing remotely-coupled, distributed quantum network systems. On the
contrary, opto-electronic architectures hosting self-sustained oscillations has
been a unique platform for longhaul signal transmission and processing. Here,
we integrated an opto-electronic oscillator with a magnonic oscillator
consisting of a microwave waveguide and a Y3Fe5O12(YIG) sphere, and
demonstrated strong and coherent coupling between YIG's magnon modes and the
opto-electronic oscillator's characteristic photon modes - revealing the
hallmark anti-crossing gap in the measured spectrum. In particular, the photon
mode is produced on-demand via a nonlinear, parametric process as stipulated by
an external seed pump. Both the internal cavity phase and the external pump
phase can be precisely tuned to stabilize either degenerate or nondegenerate
auto-oscillations. Our result lays out a new, hybrid platform for investigating
long-distance coupling and nonlinearity in coherent magnonic phenomena, which
may be find useful in constructing future distributed hybrid magnonic systems.

### exaPD: A highly parallelizable workflow for multi-element phase diagram (PD) construction

Phase diagrams (PDs) illustrate the relative stability of competing phases
under varying conditions, serving as critical tools for synthesizing complex
materials. Reliable phase diagrams rely on precise free energy calculations,
which are computationally intensive. We introduce exaPD, a user-friendly
workflow that enables simultaneous sampling of multiple phases across a fine
mesh of temperature and composition for free energy calculations. The package
employs standard molecular dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC) sampling
techniques, as implemented in the LAMMPS package. Various interatomic
potentials are supported, including the neural network potentials with near
{\it ab initio} accuracy. A global controller, built with Parsl, manages the
MD/MC jobs to achieve massive parallelization with near ideal scalability. The
resulting free energies of both liquid and solid phases, including solid
solutions, are integrated into CALPHAD modeling using the PYCALPHAD package for
constructing the phase diagram.

### A variational formulation of stochastic thermodynamics. Part I: Finite-dimensional systems

- **TL;DR**: 本文为有限维连续时间系统建立了随机热力学的变分基础，通过第二定律要求推导出一致的热力学结构，包括广义涨落-耗散关系和涨落定理。

In this paper, we develop a variational foundation for stochastic
thermodynamics of finite-dimensional, continuous-time systems. Requiring the
second law (non-negative average total entropy production) systematically
yields a consistent thermodynamic structure, from which novel generalized
fluctuation-dissipation relations emerge naturally, ensuring local detailed
balance. This principle extends key results of stochastic thermodynamics
including an individual trajectory level description of both configurational
and thermal variables and fluctuation theorems in an extended thermodynamic
phase space. It applies to both closed and open systems, while accommodating
state-dependent parameters, nonlinear couplings between configurational and
thermal degrees of freedom, and cross-correlated noise consistent with Onsager
symmetry. This is achieved by establishing a unified geometric framework in
which stochastic thermodynamics emerges from a generalized Lagrange-d'Alembert
principle, building on the variational structure introduced by Gay-Balmaz and
Yoshimura [Phil. Trans. R. Soc. A 381, 2256 (2023)]. Irreversible and
stochastic forces are incorporated through nonlinear nonholonomic constraints,
with entropy treated as an independent dynamical variable. This work provides a
novel approach for thermodynamically consistent modeling of stochastic systems,
and paves the way to applications in continuum systems such as active and
complex fluids.

- **TL;DR**: 作者反驳评论中的质疑，通过三点澄清证明RbV3Sb5中光和磁场诱导的CDW操纵是内在效应而非实验伪影

In their comment, the authors attribute our observations of light- and
magnetic-field-induced manipulation of the CDW state in RbV3Sb5 to random
experimental artifacts such as tip changes, drift, and scan conditions,
concluding that no intrinsic effect exists. In this reply, we clarify three
points. First, our reported magnetic-field-induced CDW switching has been
independently replicated in multiple STM studies and corroborated by transport
measurements. Second, in our data, the switching of CDW intensities and Bragg
vector ratios exhibit high fidelity (nearly 100 $\%$), and this cannot be
explained by random artifacts. Lastly, we disprove the comment's
unsubstantiated claim about magnetic field values by showing a system-dependent
correlation between z-piezo shift and magnetic field. Taken together, our Reply
reaffirms the reproducibility and intrinsic nature of light and magnetic field
induced CDW manipulation in RbV3Sb5.

### Hopf symmetry-protected topological phase at the intersection of magnetic and spin loop-current order

Hopf terms are topological theta terms that are associated with a host of
interesting physics, including anyons, statistical transmutation, chiral edge
states, and the quantum spin-Hall effect. Here, we show that Hopf terms
generically appear in two-dimensional metals without spin-orbit coupling at the
intersection of magnetic and spin loop-current order. In the locally ordered,
but globally disordered, phase the system is governed by the Hopf term and
realizes a Hopf symmetry-protected topological phase. This phase is protected
by the $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ spin rotation symmetry, is gapped in the bulk, has
chiral gapless edge states, and its spin-Hall conductance is quantized. Lattice
models that realize this phase are introduced. In addition, we provide an
elementary proof that the $\theta$ angle of the Hopf term must be quantized to
multiples of $\pi$ in non-relativistic systems, thereby precluding anyonic
skyrmions in condensed matter systems.

### Even-denominator fractional quantum Hall states with spontaneously broken rotational symmetry

- **TL;DR**: 在高质量GaAs二维空穴系统中，首次在纯垂直磁场下观测到高度各向异性的分数量子霍尔态，表明拓扑序与向列相自发对称破缺的共存。

The interplay between the fractional quantum Hall effect and nematicity is
intriguing as it links emerging topological order and spontaneous symmetry
breaking. Anisotropic fractional quantum Hall states (FQHSs) have indeed been
reported in GaAs quantum wells but only in tilted magnetic fields, where the
in-plane field explicitly breaks the rotational symmetry. Here we report the
observation of FQHSs with highly anisotropic longitudinal resistances in purely
perpendicular magnetic fields at even-denominator Landau level (LL) fillings
{\nu} = 5/2 and 7/2 in ultrahigh-quality GaAs two-dimensional hole systems. The
coexistence of FQHSs and spontaneous symmetry breaking at half fillings signals
the emergence of nematic FQHSs which also likely harbor non-Abelian
quasiparticle excitations. By gate tuning the hole density, we observe a phase
transition from an anisotropic, developing FQHS to an isotropic composite
fermion Fermi sea at {\nu} = 7/2. Our calculations suggest that the mixed
orbital components in the partially occupied LL play a key role in the
competition and interplay between topological and nematic orders.

### Optimal Control of Engineered Swift Equilibration of Nanomechanical Oscillators

- **TL;DR**: 重新表述随机热力学中的最优控制过渡问题，区分最小耗散和最小功过渡，消除终端跳跃需求，揭示最优控制趋向于中心流形的turnpike性质

We propose a reformulation of the problem of optimally controlled transitions
in stochastic thermodynamics. We impose that any terminal cost specified by a
thermodynamic functional should depend only on state variables and not on
control protocols, according to the canonical Bolza form. In this way, we can
unambiguously discriminate between transitions at minimum dissipation between
genuine equilibrium states, and transitions at minimum work driving a system
from a genuine equilibrium to a non-equilibrium state. For underdamped dynamics
subject to a mechanical force, genuine equilibrium means a Maxwell-Boltzmann
probability distribution defining a vanishing current velocity. Transitions at
minimum dissipation between equilibria are a model of optimal swift engineered
equilibration. Remarkably, we show that transitions at minimum work do not
directly imply explicit boundary conditions on terminal values of parameters of
the mechanical force and on control protocols. Thus, the problem often
discussed in the literature, that optimal protocols need terminal jumps to
satisfy boundary conditions, completely disappears. The quantitative properties
of optimal controls are entirely determined by the form of the penalty
modelling an experimental setup. More generally, we use centre manifold theory
to analytically account for the tendency of optimal controls to exhibit a
turnpike property: optimal protocols in the bulk of the control horizon tend to
converge to a universal centre manifold determined only by the running cost.
Exponential deviations from the centre manifold occur at the ends of the
control horizon in order to satisfy the boundary conditions. Our findings are
supported numerically.

### Theoretical investigation of real-fluid effects on the oxidation of hydrogen and syngas in high-pressure flow reactors

- **TL;DR**: 该研究建立了首个高压流动反应器的真实流体建模框架，量化了氢气和合成气氧化过程中的真实流体效应，发现在高压条件下忽略这些效应会导致显著的模拟误差。

Investigating the high-pressure pyrolysis and oxidation of hydrogen and
syngas is essential for developing accurate combustion models under real engine
conditions. Accordingly, flow reactors have been increasingly used in these
fundamental combustion research at high-pressure conditions to achieve chemical
kinetic modeling. However, these previous chemical kinetic modeling for
pyrolysis and oxidation has almost been completely conducted based on ideal gas
assumption, which might fail at high-pressure conditions when real-fluid
behaviors become pronounced. Elucidating whether this is the case is urgent
given the high demand for high-pressure combustion and propulsion technologies.
Toward this, this study establishes a first-of-its-kind real-fluid modelling
framework for high-pressure flow reactors, where the physical molecular
interactions in real fluids are represented via coupling ab initio
intermolecular potentials with high-order Virial equation of state and further
with real-fluid thermochemistry, real-fluid chemical equilibrium, and
real-fluid conservation laws of species, mass, and momentum. Using the
developed framework, real-fluid effects in high-pressure flow reactors are
quantified through case studies of hydrogen and syngas oxidation, covering
pressure of 10-500 bar, temperature of 601-946 K, equivalence ratio of
0.0009-12.07, and dilution ratio of 5.9%-99.5%. The results reveal the strong
real-fluid effects in high-pressure flow reactors, where ignoring them can lead
to considerable errors in the simulated mole fractions, which are higher than
typical levels of measurements uncertainty in flow reactors. These errors can
lead to misinterpretation of the fundamental oxidation chemistry in
high-pressure flow reactors and pose significant errors in the developed
chemistry models, which should be adequately accounted for in future
high-pressure flow reactor studies.

### Ultrafast giant enhancement of second harmonic generation in a strongly correlated cobaltite YbBaCo4O7

- **TL;DR**: 在钴酸盐YbBaCo4O7中观察到飞秒光激发导致的光学二次谐波产生效率的巨增强，增强幅度达60%，随后衰减到保持增强的亚稳态状态。

We report the observation of ultrafast photoinduced giant enhancement of
optical second harmonic generation (SHG) efficiency in cobaltite YbBaCo4O7.
Upon femtosecond pumping at energies above the band gap, the system exhibits an
ultrafast enhancement in SHG intensity, reaching up to 60% higher than the
initial value, then decays into a metastable state maintaining the enhancement.
The enhancement scales linearly with pump fluence but shows no dependence on
pump polarization. A pure electronic process sets in within the first ~200 fs
and is accompanied by a pronounced anisotropic amplification of nonlinear
susceptibility. We propose this anomalous SHG enhancement originates from
ultrafast electronic band renormalization arising from dynamical modification
of multi-electron correlations. In stark contrast to conventional asymmetric
systems where SHG is typically suppressed upon photoexcitation, our
experimental findings shed a new light on ultrafast optical control nonlinear
properties in quantum materials.

### Second ac screening step as a probe for the first-order melting transition in layered vortex matter at intermediate temperatures

We present a new probe for the first-order transition for layered vortex
matter: A second step in the screening of an ac field that is independent of
the frequency and amplitude of the excitation. This second step is observed in
the intermediate temperature and field ranges where detecting the jump in
induction associated with the transition is rather elusive with standard
magnetometry techniques. We observe this second step following a novel
experimental protocol where the screening of a locally-generated ac field is
remotely detected in another region of the sample. The coincidence of the
typical temperature of the second step in direct and remote measurements
strongly supports this feature is a probe of the first-order transition. This
nonlocal effect detected at distances of thousands of vortex lattice spacings
away indicates that a very efficient mechanism propagates the change in
rigidity of the structure from the more (liquid) to the less (solid) symmetric
vortex phases.

### Coupling free-surface geometry and localized ion dose for continuum models of radiation-induced nanopatterning

- **TL;DR**: 该论文开发了渐近近似方法来耦合局部离子剂量与演化自由界面，揭示了理论预测对耦合细节的惊人敏感性。

A first-principles understanding of the self-organization of highly regular,
nanometer-scale structures atop irradiated semiconductor surfaces has been
sought for decades. While numerous models exist which explain certain aspects
of this phenomenon, a unified, physical model capable of explaining all details
of pattern formation has remained elusive. However, it is increasingly apparent
that such a model will require understanding the dual influence of the
collision cascade initiated by ion implantation: first, as a source of material
transport by sputtering and atomic displacements occurring over short time
scales, and, second, as a source of defects permitting viscous flow within the
thin, amorphous layer that results from sustained irradiation over longer time
scales. To better understand the latter, we develop several asymptotic
approximations for coupling the localized ion dose with an evolving free
interface. We then show how theoretical predictions of quantities commonly used
for comparison with experimental observations -- such as ripple wavelengths,
critical irradiation angle for patterning onset, and surface roughening --
exhibit surprising sensitivity to the details of this coupling.

### Stabilization of sliding ferroelectricity through exciton condensation

- **TL;DR**: 该论文研究了二维材料中的滑动铁电性现象，重点分析了WTe2双层结构中的激子效应对铁电稳定性的重要贡献。

Sliding ferroelectricity is a phenomenon that arises from the insurgence of
spontaneous electronic polarization perpendicular to the layers of
two-dimensional (2D) systems upon the relative sliding of the atomic layer
constituents. Because of the weak van der Waals (vdW) interactions between
layers, sliding and the associated symmetry breaking can occur at low energy
cost in materials such as transition-metal dichalcogenides. Here we discuss
theoretically the origin and quantitative understanding of the phenomenon by
focusing on a prototype structure, the WTe2 bilayer, where sliding
ferroelectricity was first experimentally observed. We show that excitonic
effects induce relevant energy band renormalizations in the ground state, and
exciton condensation contributes significantly to stabilizing ferroelectricity
upon sliding beyond previous predictions. Enhanced excitonic effects in 2D and
vdW sliding are general phenomena that point to sliding ferroelectricity as
relevant for a broad class of important materials, where the intrinsic electric
dipole can couple with other quantum phenomena and, in turn, an external
electric field can control the quantum phases through ferroelectricity in
unexplored ways.

Correlated structures are intimately connected to intriguing phenomena
exhibited by a variety of disordered systems such as soft colloidal gels,
bio-polymer networks and colloidal suspensions near a shear jamming transition.
The universal critical behavior of these systems near the onset of rigidity is
often described by traditional approaches as the coherent potential
approximation - a versatile version of effective-medium theory that
nevertheless have hitherto lacked key ingredients to describe disorder spatial
correlations. Here we propose a multi-purpose generalization of the coherent
potential approximation to describe the mechanical behavior of elastic networks
with spatially-correlated disorder. We apply our theory to a simple
rigidity-percolation model for colloidal gels and study the effects of
correlations in both the critical point and the overall scaling behavior. We
find that although the presence of spatial correlations (mimicking attractive
interactions of gels) shifts the critical packing fraction to lower values,
suggesting sub-isostatic behavior, the critical coordination number of the
associated network remains isostatic. More importantly, we discuss how our
theory can be employed to describe a large variety of systems with
spatially-correlated disorder.

Ultrafast electron microscopy (UEM) has found widespread applications in
physics, chemistry, and materials science, enabling real-space imaging of
dynamics on ultrafast timescales. Recent advances have pushed the temporal
resolution of UEM into the attosecond regime, enabling the attomicroscopy
technique to directly visualize electron motion. In this work, we extend the
capabilities of this powerful imaging tool to investigate ultrafast electron
dynamics in a biological system by imaging and controlling light induced
electronic and chemical changes in the conductive network of multicellular
cable bacteria. Using electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), we first
observed a laser induced increase in {\pi}-electron density, accompanied by
spectral peak broadening and a blueshift features indicative of enhanced
conductivity and structural modification. We also traced the effect of
ultrafast laser pumping on bulk plasmon electron oscillations by monitoring
changes in the plasmon like resonance peak. Additionally, we visualized laser
induced chemical structural changes in cable bacteria in real space. The
imaging results revealed carbon enrichment alongside a depletion of nitrogen
and oxygen, highlighting the controllability of chemical dynamics. Moreover,
time resolved EELS measurements further revealed a picosecond scale decay and
recovery of both {\pi}-electron and plasmonic features, attributed to electron
phonon coupling. In addition to shedding light on the mechanism of electron
motion in cable bacteria, these findings demonstrate ultrafast modulation and
switching of conductivity, underscoring their potential as bio-optoelectronic
components operating on ultrafast timescales.

We develop an extension of the fermionic functional renormalization group for
systems where strong correlations give rise to projected Hilbert spaces. We use
our method to calculate the phase diagram and the electronic spectral function
of the Hubbard model at infinite on-site repulsion where many-body states
involving doubly occupied lattice sites are eliminated from the physical
Hilbert space. For a square lattice with nearest-neighbor hopping we find that
the ground state evolves from a paramagnetic Fermi liquid at low densities via
a state with antiferromagnetic stripe order at intermediate densities to an
extended Nagaoka ferromagnet at high densities. In the strongly correlated
magnetic phases, the electrons form an incoherent non-Fermi liquid. Both at
high and low densities, the volume of the Fermi surface is not constrained by
Luttinger's theorem.

### Re-entrant superconductivity at an oxide heterointerface

- **TL;DR**: 在LaTiO3-KTaO3界面观察到磁场诱导的重入超导现象，这是二维系统中罕见的反直觉现象，通常磁场会抑制超导性。

A magnetic field typically suppresses superconductivity by either breaking
Cooper pairs via the Zeeman effect or inducing vortex formation. However, under
certain circumstances, a magnetic field can stabilize superconductivity
instead. This seemingly counterintuitive phenomenon is associated with magnetic
interactions and has been extensively studied in three-dimensional materials.
By contrast, this phenomenon, hinting at unconventional superconductivity,
remains largely unexplored in two-dimensional systems, with moir\'e-patterned
graphene being the only known example. Here, we report the observation of
re-entrant superconductivity (RSC) at the epitaxial (110)-oriented LaTiO3-KTaO3
interface. This phenomenon occurs across a wide range of charge carrier
densities, which, unlike in three-dimensional materials, can be tuned in-situ
via electrostatic gating. We attribute the re-entrant superconductivity to the
interplay between a strong spin-orbit coupling and a magnetic-field driven
modification of the Fermi surface. Our findings offer new insights into
re-entrant superconductivity and establish a robust platform for exploring
novel effects in two-dimensional superconductors.

### Electric spin and valley Hall effects

The electric Hall effect (EHE) is a newly identified Hall effect
characterized by a perpendicular electric field inducing a transverse charge
current in two-dimensional (2D) systems. Here, we propose a spin and valley
version of EHE. We demonstrate that the transverse spin and valley currents can
be generated in an all-in-one tunnel junction based on a buckled 2D hexagonal
material in response to a perpendicular electric field, referred to as the
electric spin Hall effect and electric valley Hall effect, respectively. These
effects arise from the perpendicular-electric-field-induced backreflection
phase of electrons in the junction spacer, independent of Berry curvature. The
valley Hall conductance exhibits an odd response to the perpendicular electric
field, whereas the spin Hall conductance shows an even one. The predicted
effects can further enable the transverse separation of a pair of pure
spin-valley-locked states with full spin-valley polarization while preserving
time-reversal symmetry, as manifested by equal spin and valley Hall angles. Our
findings present a new mechanism for realizing the spin and valley Hall effects
and provide a novel route to the full electric-field manipulation of spin and
valley degrees of freedom, with significant potential for future applications
in spintronics and valleytronics.

### Obstruction-Driven Parity Inversion for Enhanced Optical Absorption in Hexagonal Transition Metal Dichalcogenides

The optical selection rule states that opposite parity between the valence
and conduction bands is required for optical absorption to occur. However,
monolayer hexagonal transition metal dichalcogenides (h-TMDs) such as $
\mathrm{MoS}_{2} $ exhibit pronounced optical absorption despite their
nominally dipole-forbidden d-d transitions. In this Letter, we elucidate a
parity inversion mechanism through which obstruction-driven band inversion
promotes dipole-allowed optical transitions near the band edge in monolayer
h-TMDs. By comparing trivial and obstructed atomic limit phases, we show that
intersite interactions between hybridized d orbitals induce parity inversion.
Our results provide a novel approach to tuning optical properties through
parity control, bridging the gap between topology and light-matter interaction.

### Microscopic Structure of Aqueous Alkylamine mixtures: a Computer Simulation Study

Aqueous alkylamine mixtures are studied by computer simulations in order to
understand the microscopic origin of the water rich side prominent x-ray
scattering pre-peaks reported in a recent study. These pre-peaks are puzzling
in view of the apparently contradicting facts that neat amines show pre-peaks
much weaker than neat alkanols, while water-rich aqueous alcohols do not. These
observations can be intuitively rationalized by noting that the amine head
group have two hydrogen atoms when the hydroxyl group have only one, but they
oppose the following two facts: i) computer simulations show
micro-heterogeneity for both systems; ii) amines mix with water better than
alcohols, both over larger concentrations and alkyl tails lengths.
  The study of the atom-atom pair correlation functions and related structure
factors allows to understand the microscopic molecular details. The most
interesting observation is that the amine head groups accumulate preferentially
at the surface of the water domains, and increasingly better with longer alkyl
tail, thus allowing to stabilize both the water and alkylamine domains, hence
avoiding macroscopic demixing, except at high water concentrations when amines
are scarce to achieve efficient surface saturation. The amine domains appear as
disordered bilayers. Hence, aqueous amines are analogous to an inverse micelle
melt and as precursor micro-emulsion.
  This stable micro-segregation produces large domain oscillations in the long
range part of the correlation functions, translating into positive pre-peaks
and negative anti-peaks in the related structure factors, the latter which
contribute destructively to produce the prominent scattering pre-peak observed
in the x-ray experiments.
  The model dependence is shown to be quite important, both for water and
solute models. The CHARMM-AA model associated with the SPC/E model seems to be
a good compromise.

### The Finite-Temperature Behavior of a Triangular Heisenberg Antiferromagnet

We investigate the classical antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the

break lattice rotational symmetries, spiral spin liquids and the broad specific
heat hump that is ubiquitous in the antiferromagnetic 120 degree phase.

Recent observations of quantum anomalous Hall effects in moir\'e systems have
revealed the emergence of interaction-driven ferromagnetism with significant
orbital contributions. To capture this physics, we extend the modern theory of
orbital magnetization to Hartree-Fock states and show that the standard
expression remains valid with Hartree-Fock orbitals and Hamiltonians. We then
benchmark our theory against the Kane-Mele-Hubbard model in a weak field, which
yields excellent agreement with direct numerical calculations. Applying our
theory to twisted MoTe$_2$ bilayers, we find orbital magnetization of order one
Bohr magneton per moir\'e cell with a non-monotonic twist-angle dependence. Our
work establishes a general theory of orbital magnetization in interacting
moir\'e systems and provides quantitative guidance for interpreting recent
experiments.

### Electride behavior at high pressure in silicon and other elements in solid and liquid phases

- **TL;DR**: 该论文发现硅在超过400 GPa的高压下会变成电子化物，并提出了基于电子局域函数和电荷密度的定量标准来识别高压电子化物。

Electrides are materials in which some of the electrons are localized at the
interstitial sites rather than around the atoms or along atomic bonds. Most
elemental electrides are either alkali metals or alkaline-earth metals because
of their low ionization potential. In this work, we report that elemental
silicon becomes an electride at pressures exceeding 400 GPa. With {\it ab
initio} molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we study this behavior for
silicon, sodium, potassium, and magnesium at high pressure and temperature. We
performed simulations for liquids and ten crystal structures. Charge density
and electron localization functions (ELF) are analyzed for representative
configurations extracted from the MD trajectories. By analyzing a variety of
electride structures, we suggest the following quantitative thresholds for the
ELF and charge density in each interstitial site to classify high-pressure
electrides: (1) the maximum ELF value should be greater than 0.7, (2) there
should be at least 0.9 electrons near the ELF basin, and (3) the Laplacian
charge density, $\nabla^2 \rho(\mathbf{r}_0)$, should be negative with
magnitude greater than $10^{-3}\ e/\mathrm{bohr}^5$. Finally, we compute X-ray
diffraction patterns to determine the degree to which they are affected by the
electride formation. Overall, this framework could become a benchmark for
future theoretical and experimental studies on electrides.

A diene-transmissive hetero-Diels-Alder strategy, grounded in previous
experimental works and employing boronated dienophiles, is proposed for the
synthesis of boron-bearing octahydroquinolines. To assess its feasibility,
three representative reactions were investigated, and their thermodynamics were
evaluated in toluene and acetonitrile at various temperatures using the WB97X-D
level of theory. The peri-, regio-, stereo-, and $\pi$-facial selectivities
were predicted. The reactions mechanisms were elucidated through exploration of
the reaction pathways. The predictions are consistent with available
experimental work, and show the reactions are feasible with low to moderate
polarity. The results also demonstrate that the reactions selectivity can in
some cases be tuned by judicious choice of reaction conditions to deliver
specific products with high selectivity.

We apply two ab initio many-body methods based on Gutzwiller wave functions,
i.e., correlation matrix renormalization theory (CMRT) and Gutzwiller conjugate
gradient minimization (GCGM), to the study of crystalline phases of atomic
hydrogen. Both methods avoid empirical Hubbard U parameters and are free from
double-counting issues. CMRT employs a Gutzwiller-type approximation that
enables efficient calculations, while GCGM goes beyond this approximation to
achieve higher accuracy at higher computational cost. By benchmarking against
available quantum Monte Carlo results, we demonstrate that while both methods
are more accurate than the widely used density-functional theory (DFT), GCGM
systematically captures additional correlation energy missing in CMRT, leading
to significantly improved total energy predictions. We also show that by
including the correlation energy from LDA in the CMRT calculation, CMRT+
produces energy in better agreement with the QMC results in these hydrogen
lattice systems.

The interplay between Coulomb interactions and kinetic energy underlies many
exotic phases in condensed matter physics. In a two-dimensional electronic
system, If Coulomb interaction dominates over kinetic energy, electrons
condense into a crystalline phase which is referred as Wigner crystal. This
ordered state manifests as Wigner molecule for few electrons at the microscopic
scale. Observation of Wigner molecules has been reported in quantum dot and
moire superlattice systems. Here we demonstrate hole Wigner molecules can be
formed in a gate-defined germanium quantum dot with high tunability. By varying
voltages applied to the quantum dot device, we can precisely tune the hole
density by either changing the hole occupancy or the quantum dot size. For
densities smaller than a certain critical value, Coulomb interaction localizes
individual holes into ordered lattice sites, forming a Wigner molecule. By
increasing the densities, melting process from a Wigner molecule to Fermi
liquid-like particles is observed. An intermediate configuration which
indicates the coexistence of ordered structure and disordered structure can be
formed within a narrow effective density range. Our results provide a new
platform for further exploration of the microscopic feature of strong
correlated physics and open an avenue to exploit the application of Wigner
molecules for quantum information in a very promising spin qubit platform.

Atomically thin oxides are increasingly recognized as an emerging class of 2D
materials, yet their multifunctional properties have been far less investigated
compared to other layered materials. Among these, gallium oxide is
distinguished by its ultrawide bandgap, thermal stability, and mechanical
rigidity, positioning it as a candidate material for nanoelectromechanical
systems. In this study, the tribological, transport, and electromechanical
properties of beta-Ga2O3 nanosheets were probed using atomic force microscopy
(AFM)--based techniques. Friction force microscopy (FFM) was used to
investigate interfacial sliding, and a dependence of friction on external bias
was observed, which was attributed to defect-mediated charge trapping. Van der
Pauw Hall measurements were conducted up to 400 $^{\circ}$C, through which the
ultrawide bandgap nature of beta-Ga2O3 was confirmed, as electronic transport
remained suppressed despite high thermal activation. Piezoresponse force
microscopy (PFM) was further applied, and a measurable converse
electromechanical response on the order of a few pm/V was revealed, consistent
with oxygen-vacancy--induced symmetry breaking. By integrating tribological,
electrical, and electromechanical measurements, it was demonstrated that
beta-Ga2O3 nanosheets present a unique platform in which insulating stability,
bias-tunable interfacial mechanics, and defect-enabled electromechanical
activity coexist, offering new opportunities for multifunctional oxide
nanodevices.

Topological properties of many-body entanglement in quantum spin liquids
(QSLs), persisting at arbitrarily long distances, have been intensely explored
over the past two decades, but mostly for QSLs viewed as {\em closed} quantum
systems. However, in experiments and potential quantum computing applications,
candidate materials for this exotic phase of quantum matter will always
interact with a dissipative environment, such as the one generated by bosonic
quasiparticles in solids at finite temperature. Here we investigate the spatial
structure and stability of entanglement in the Kitaev model of QSL made {\em
open} by sudden coupling to an infinite bosonic bath of Caldeira-Leggett type
and time-evolved using the Lindblad quantum master equation in the Markovian
regime (i.e., for weak coupling) or tensor network methods for open quantum
systems in the non-Markovian regime (i.e., for strong coupling). From the
time-evolved density matrix of QSL and its subregions, we extract genuine
multipartite negativity (GMN), quantum Fisher information, spin-spin
correlators, and expectation value (EV) of the Wilson loop operator. In
particular, time-dependence of GMN offers the most penetrating insights: (i) in
the Markovian regime, it remains non-zero in larger loopy subregions of QSL (as
also discovered very recently for closed QSLs) up to temperatures comparable to
Kitaev exchange interaction at which other quantities, such as EV of the Wilson
loop operator, vanish; (ii) in the non-Markovian regime with pronounced memory
effects, GMN remains non-zero up to even higher temperatures, while also
acquiring non-zero value in smaller non-loopy subregions. The non-Markovian
dynamics can also generate emergent interactions between spins, thereby opening
avenues for tailoring properties of QSL via environmental engineering.

Non-diffusive effects in charge transport become relevant as device sizes and
features become comparable to the electronic mean free path. As a model system,
we investigate the electric transport around mesoscopic defects in graphene
with scanning tunneling potentiometry. Diffusive and ballistic contributions to
the scattering dipole are probed by simultaneously resolving the nanoscale
topography of pits in the graphene layer and measuring the local
electrochemical potential in the surrounding area. We find evidence of
transport in the intermediate regime between the diffusive and ballistic
limits, such that the magnitude of the electrochemical potential around the
defects is substantially underestimated by diffusive models. Our experiments
and modeling are supported by lattice Boltzmann simulations, which highlight
the importance of the ratio between defect size and mean free path in the
intermediate transport regime. The magnitude of the scattering dipole depends
on the shape of the pits in both the ballistic and diffusive transport modes.
Remarkably, ballistic contributions to the electron transport are found at
feature sizes larger than the mean free path and rapidly increase at lower
sizes, having a noticeable impact already at mesoscopic length scales.

Engineered micro- or nano-structures based on nonlinear optical materials
offer versatile opportunities for optoelectronic applications. While extensive
efforts have been devoted to design tailored microcavities to promote and
increase the optical nonlinearities of graphene, the potential of engineering
its three-dimensional counterparts -- three-dimensional Dirac semimetals --
remains largely unexplored. Here we report on exceptionally strong terahertz
nonlinearities in a cavity-engineered Dirac semimetal microstructure, and
demonstrate a giant enhancement of terahertz third- and fifth-order harmonic
yields by more than three orders of magnitude. By fabricating a designed
structure of metallic metasurface microcavities on a nanometer thin film of the
threedimensional Dirac semimetal Cd3As2, we significantly enhance the
near-field intensity of a picosecond terahertz excitation pulse in resonance
with the microcavity eigenmode. This transiently modifies the nonlinearities of
the thin film and drives the nonlinear responses of the Dirac fermions from a
weakly to a deeply nonperturbative regime where the observed high-harmonic
generation essentially saturates.

Charge order is a widely observed and representative example of spontaneous
broken symmetries in quantum states of matter. Owing to the large intra-atomic
Coulomb energy, the charge redistribution in such an order typically implies
significant alteration of the electronic and lattice properties of materials.
While the standard description of charge order, namely a "charge density wave"
instability of the Fermi surface, has been broadly and successfully applied to
good metals, its applicability to correlated ionic materials has been rather
limited. Here, we propose an alternative general scenario of charge order -
crystallization of long-lived Frenkel excitons - suitable for these ionic
materials. We demonstrate this scenario on the recently discovered kagome
superconductors and successfully reproduce all the characteristics of
experimental observations on both local charge correlations and long-range
ordering. The proposed generic scenario offers a long-sought understanding of
charge order applicable to modern correlated functional materials.

### Band Gap Engineering of Nitrogen-Doped Monolayer WSe$_2$ Superlattice and its application to Field Effect Transistor

We systematically investigate the electronic structures of pristine monolayer
WSe$_2$ and WSe$_2$ superlattices with periodic nitrogen substitution. Unlike
random doping, which often introduces in-gap impurity states, periodic nitrogen
doping primarily modulates the band gap, thereby facilitating effective band
gap engineering for electronic and optoelectronic applications. The gap narrows
monotonically with increasing dopant density (pristine $&gt;$ 8-row $&gt;$ 6-row $&gt;$
4-row), directly influencing device switching. We also evaluate the FET
performance of nanojunctions created by these configurations by examining the
contour plot of current density as a function of temperature and gate voltage,
which quantifies how bandgap engineering affects switching characteristics. Our
calculations clarify the classical-quantum crossover in sub-10 nm 2D FETs: as
$T$ rises, $J$ approaches the thermionic current; as $T$ falls, quantum
tunneling dominates, and the steep energy dependence of $\tau(E)$ may break the
classical limit of subthreshold swing imposed by the Boltzmann tyranny. The
optimal gating range ($V_g^\mathrm{ON}$, $V_g^\mathrm{OFF}$) is investigated
for each temperature, insensitive to temperature in the high-temperature
regime, confirming the good thermal stability of the FET devices. A comparison
study demonstrates that the 4-row structure, with large $J_\mathrm{OFF}$ and
restricted operation range, is inappropriate for realistic FET applications.
The pristine structure has a high $V_g^\mathrm{OFF}$ ($\sim$1.1 V) makes it
less practical, since such a large threshold voltage may promote time-dependent
dielectric breakdown (TDDB) of the oxide layer, reducing device dependability.
The 6-row and 8-row structures exhibit more favorable $V_g^\mathrm{OFF}$ values
($\sim$0.75 V), achieving compromise, making them more promising candidates for
future FET integration.

### Metallurgy at the nanoscale: domain walls in nanoalloys

- **TL;DR**: 在CuAu纳米颗粒二元合金系统中，研究发现取向畴壁可以在纳米尺度形成，这与传统物理预测相悖。较大纳米颗粒中畴形成由弹性应变弛豫驱动，而较小颗粒中表面效应占主导。多变量纳米颗粒通过连续弹性模型形成各向同性材料。

In binary alloys, domain walls play a central role not only on the phase
transitions but also on their physical properties and were at the heart of the
70's metallurgy research. Whereas it can be predicted, with simple physics
arguments, that such domain walls cannot exist at the nanometer scale due to
the typical lengths of the statistical fluctuations of the order parameter,
here we show, with both experimental and numerical approaches how orientational
domain walls are formed in CuAu nanoparticles binary model systems. We
demonstrate that the formation of domains in larger NPs is driven by elastic
strain relaxation which is not needed in smaller NPs where surface effects
dominate. Finally, we show how the multivariants NPs tend to form an isotropic
material through a continuous model of elasticity.

### Amplified magnetic catalysis in non-Hermitian Euclidean and hyperbolic Dirac liquids

- **TL;DR**: 本文预测在狄拉克系统中，外部磁场与特定非厄米性结合可以放大亚临界相互作用下的对易类质量，这一现象被称为非厄米磁催化放大。

Due to their iconic linearly vanishing density of states near the
zero-energy, half-filled two-dimensional Dirac materials in flat Euclidean and
negatively-curved hyperbolic spaces exhibit dynamic mass generation only once a
critical interaction strength is surpassed. Application of external magnetic
fields onto these systems can, however, trigger the formation of such ordered
phases yielding isotropic insulation near the band-center at arbitrarily weak
coupling, a phenomenon known as magnetic catalysis. Recently, it has been
proposed that a specific type of non-Hermiticity, allowing the system to
feature an all-real eigenvalue spectrum otherwise squeezed toward the
zero-energy, can bring down the requisite critical coupling of a specific
family of ordered phases, commuting class masses, to a desired lower finite
value in Dirac systems, a phenomenon known as non-Hermitian catalysis
(arXiv:2501.18591). Here, we predict that a confluence of external magnetic
fields and such a non-Hermiticity can amplify the magnitude of commuting class
masses for subcritical strengths of interactions in Dirac liquids, an emergent
phenomenon named non-Hermitian amplification of magnetic catalysis. We anchor
this prediction from numerical self-consistent mean-field solutions of the
commuting class mass charge-density-wave (antiferromagnetic) order displaying a
staggered pattern of average electronic density (magnetization) between the
nearest neighboring sites of the half-filled Euclidean honeycomb and hyperbolic
{10, 3} and {14, 3} lattices, all featuring emergent non-Hermitian Dirac
quasiparticles, after decomposing the nearest-neighbor Coulomb (on-site
Hubbard) repulsion in the Hartree channel. We discuss the scaling behavior of
these two orders with magnetic field and non-Hermiticity over a wide range of
subcritical interactions.. Possible experimental setups to test our predictions
are discussed.

Extended efforts have been devoted to the study of strongly-interacting
excitons and their dynamics, towards macroscopic quantum states of matter such
as Bose-Einstein condensates of excitons and polaritons. Momentum-direct
layer-hybridized excitons in transition metal dichalcogenides have attracted
considerable attention due to their high oscillator strength and dipolar
nature. However, the tunability of their interactions and dynamics remains
unexplored. Here, we achieve an unprecedented control over the nonlinear
properties of dipolar layer-hybridized excitons in an electrically gated van
der Waals homobilayer monitored by transient optical spectroscopy. By applying
a vertical electric field, we reveal strong Coulomb interactions of dipolar
hybrid excitons, leading to opposite density-dependent energy shifts of the two
main hybrid species based on their dipolar orientation, together with a
strongly enhanced optical saturation of their absorption. Furthermore, by
electrically tuning the interlayer tunneling between the hybridized carriers,
we significantly extend the formation time of hybrid excitons, while
simultaneously increasing their decay times. Our findings have implications for
the search on quantum blockade and condensation of excitons and dipolaritons in
two-dimensional materials.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种结合第一性原理可靠性和计算效率的机器学习紧束缚框架，通过构建规范无关基函数实现参数预测，可模拟传统第一性原理方法无法处理的大尺寸纳米结构。

Simulation of mesoscopic nanostructures is a central challenge in condensed
matter physics and device applications. First-principles methods provide
accurate electronic structures but are computationally prohibitive for large
systems, while empirical band theories are efficient yet limited by parameter
fitting that neglects wavefunction information and often yields
non-transferable parameters. We propose a methodology that bridges these
approaches, achieving first-principles-level reliability with computational
efficiency through a machine-learning-enabled tight-binding framework. Our
approach starts with Wannier tight-binding (WTB) parameters from small
nanostructures, which serve as training data for machine learning (ML). To
remove the gauge freedom of Wannier functions that obscures size- and
geometry-dependent parameter trends, we construct gauge-independent (GI) bases
and transform the WTB model into a gauge-independent WTB (GI-WTB) model. This
enables robust parameter fitting and ML prediction of parameter variations,
yielding the machine-learning GI-WTB (ML-GI-WTB) model. Applied to MoS2
armchair-edge nanoribbons, the ML-GI-WTB model shows excellent agreement with
first-principles results and enables reliable simulations of sub-$\mu$m-wide
nanoribbons. This framework provides a scalable tool for predicting electronic
properties of realistic nanostructures beyond the reach of conventional
first-principles methods.

We investigate the influence of the measurement duration on quantum coherence
in molecular mechanically controlled break junctions operating in a
tetrahydrofuran (THF) partially wet phase. These systems represent a distinct
class of enclosed open quantum systems with unusually long decoherence times at
ambient conditions, on the order of 1-20 ms. By tuning the integration time of
the current measurement in current-voltage (IV) characteristics, relative to
the decoherence time, we observe a transition from quantum interference
patterns, manifested as structured bands of data points, to classical behavior
characterized by a single averaged response. This demonstrates that the
duration of a measurement acts as a controllable parameter for probing quantum
behavior in molecular junctions, offering new insights into decoherence
dynamics in quantum mechanics.

Silicon carbide (SiC) polymorphs are widely employed as nuclear materials,
mechanical components, and wide-bandgap semiconductors. The rapid advancement
of SiC-based applications has been complemented by computational modeling
studies, including both ab initio and classical atomistic approaches. In this
work, we develop a computationally efficient and general-purpose
machine-learned interatomic potential (ML-IAP) capable of multimillion-atom
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations over microsecond timescales. Using ML-IAP,
we systematically map the comprehensive pressure-temperature phase diagram (P-T
phase diagram) and the threshold displacement energy (TDE) distributions for
the 2H and 3C polymorphs. Furthermore, collision cascade simulations provide
in-depth insights into polymorph-dependent primary radiation damage clustering,
a phenomenon that conventional empirical potentials fail to accurately capture.

### Pulsed-laser induced gold microparticle fragmentation by thermal strain

Laser fragmentation of suspended microparticles is an upcoming alternative to
laser ablation in liquid (LAL) that allows to streamline the the delivery
process and optimize the irradiation conditions for best efficiency. Yet, the
structural basis of this process is not well understood to date. Herein we
employed ultrafast x-ray scattering upon picosecond laser excitation of a gold
microparticle suspension in order to understand the thermal kinetics as well as
structure evolution after fragmentation. The experiments are complemented by
simulations according to the two-temperature model to verify the spatiotemporal
temperature distribution. It is found that above a fluence threshold of 750
J/m$^2$ the microparticles are fragmented within a nanosecond into several
large pieces where the driving force is the strain due to a strongly
inhomogenous heat distribution on the one hand and stress confinement due to
the ultrafast heating compared to stress propagation on the other hand. The
additional limited formation of small clusters is attributed to photothermal
decomposition on the front side of the microparticles at the fluence of 2700
J/m$^2$.

Selectively exciting and manipulating phonons at nanoscale becomes more and
more important but still remains challenging in modern nano-energy control and
information sensing. Here, we show that the phonon spin angular momentum
provides an extra degree of freedom to achieve versatile manipulation of axial
phonons in nanomaterials via coupling to spinful multi-physical fields, such as
circularly polarized infrared absorption. In particular, we demonstrate the
nanoscale one-way axial phonon excitation and routing in chiral nanomaterials,
by converting the photon spin in circularly polarized optical fields into the
collective interference phonon spin. As exemplified in the smallest chiral
carbon nanotube, we show that the rectification rate can reach nearly 100\%,
achieving an ideal one-way phonon router, which is verified by molecular
dynamics simulations. Our results shed new light on the flexible phonon
manipulation via phonon spin degree of freedom, paving the way for future spin
phononics.

The vibrational structure of chromium germanium telluride
(Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$, CGT) is investigated and a strong spin-phonon coupling is
revealed. The measured high-resolution Raman scattering (RS) spectra are
composed of the 10 Raman-active modes: 5A$_\textrm{g}$ and 5E$_\textrm{g}$,
predicted by calculation using the density functional theory and identified
using polarization-resolved RS measurements. We also studied the effect of
temperature on the RS spectra of CGT from 5~K to 300~K. A strong magneto-phonon
coupling in CGT is revealed at temperatures of about 150~K and 60~K, which are
associated with the appearance of the local magnetic order in the material and
the transition to the complete ferromagnetic phase, respectively. Moreover, a
unique shape of the A$_g^5$ mode composed of a set of very narrow Raman peaks
is simulated using a model that takes into account vibrations of Ge-Ge
pseudo-molecules for various Ge isotopes.

Organic Quantum Chains (OQCs) represent a newly synthesized class of
carbon-based nanostructures whose quasi-one-dimensional nature gives rise to
unconventional electronic and transport phenomena. Here we investigate the
electronic and transport properties of recently synthesized OQCs [Nature
Communications, 12, 5895 (2021)]. Structural stability was first assessed
through molecular dynamics relaxation combined with density functional theory
(DFT). The optimized coordinates are then used in a tight-binding model with
exponentially decaying hopping parameterization, which reproduces the DFT
results with high accuracy. Our calculations reveal a robust and nearly
constant energy gap across several OQC configurations, in agreement with
experimental data. We also identify emergent hierarchical states, characterized
by distinct localization behaviors within sets of localized bands. Finally, we
analyze different transport responses in scenarios involving the
one-dimensional OQC coupled to carbon corrals, as observed in the experimental
data, highlighting their potential as promising systems for application in
carbon nanodevices.

### Quantum Effects or Theoretical Artifacts? A Computational Reanalysis of Hydrogen at High-Pressure

The stability of high-pressure phases of hydrogen remains a central question
in condensed matter physics, where both experimental observations and
theoretical predictions are highly sensitive to methodological choices. Here,
we revisit the cold phase diagram of hydrogen between 400 and 700 GPa using the
meta-GGA functionals (R2SCAN and SCAN0) and compare the results with the more
common PBE. At the meta-GGA level, molecular phases (Cmca-4, Cmca-12, and C2/c)
are stabilized over the atomic I41/amd phase up to significantly higher
pressures than predicted by GGA, in closer agreement with diffusion Monte Carlo
calculations and experimental observations of band-gap closure near 425 GPa.
Furthermore, phonon spectra calculated with R2SCAN show that the dynamical
instabilities and anharmonic signatures previously predicted at the GGA level
vanish, indicating that such effects may partly arise from functional
deficiencies rather than genuine nuclear quantum effects. Bonding analysis
reveals that PBE artificially weakens intramolecular H-H bonds and enhances
intermolecular interactions through charge delocalization, whereas meta-GGA
preserves a more localized molecular character. Anharmonic motion remains
relevant for finite-temperature dynamics; however, we demonstrate that the
accurate description of the potential energy surface - particularly its
curvature near equilibrium - is pivotal for assessing both phase stability and
bonding of hydrogen at high-pressure.

We studied the dynamics of a pair of single-electron double quantum dots
(DQD) under longitudinal and transverse static magnetic fields and
time-dependent harmonic modulation of their interaction couplings. We propose
to modulate the tunnel coupling between the QDs to produce one-qubit gates and
the exchange coupling between DQDs to generate entangling gates, the set of
operations required for quantum computing. We developed analytical
approximations to set the conditions to control the qubits and applied them to
numerical calculations to test the accuracy and robustness of the analytical
model. The results shows that the unitary evolution of the two-electron state
performs the designed operations even under conditions shifted from the ideal
ones.

### Reversal of strain state in a Mott insulator thin film by controlling substrate morphology

- **TL;DR**: 通过调控基板形态，利用热膨胀失配主导应变，实现V2O3薄膜中金属-绝缘体相变的调控。

The V2O3 phase diagram contains two insulating phases and one metallic phase
with different lattice structures. The stability of these phases is very
sensitive to pressure, offering a mechanism to tune phase transitions by
inducing strain in thin films. The most studied source of strain is lattice
mismatch between the film and the substrate. In this work, however, we find
that the film/substrate thermal expansion mismatch can be made to play a
dominant role by modifying the substrate morphology. When grown on sapphire,
the lattice mismatch induces compressive strain in the V2O3 films, whereas
thermal expansion mismatch induces tensile strain. We find that minute changes
in substrate morphology may relax the compressive strain component, allowing
the thermally-induced tensile component to overcome it. Thus, by simple
annealing of the substrates to create either a flat or stepped morphology,
strongly compressive or tensile strains may be induced in the films. This
results in either full suppression of the metal-insulator transition or
stabilization of insulating phases at all temperatures, exhibiting many orders
of magnitude differences in film resistivity. To elucidate the strain
relaxation mechanism, we use high-resolution scanning transmission electron
microscopy (HRSTEM) to image the atomic steps in the substrate and the adjacent
crystallographic defects in the V2O3. These findings offer a hitherto
underexplored mechanism to tune strain in thin films, deepen our understanding
of the effects of structural degrees of freedom on phase stability of a
canonical Mott insulator and may allow for applications requiring
insulator-metal switching above room temperature.
