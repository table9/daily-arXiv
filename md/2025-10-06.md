- **TL;DR**: 该论文研究了磁电量子真空场在亚波长电磁辐射区域的观测，通过磁电超原子和虚拟光子实现电磁与磁电系统的相互作用。

While in electromagnetism we have space-time symmetry, magnetoelectric (ME)
processes are characterized by space-time symmetry breaking. Our goal is to
show that quantum vacuum fields with both time reversal and space inversion
symmetry breaking (so-called ME fields) can be observed in subwavelength
regions of electromagnetic (EM) radiation. The sources of ME fields are ME
meta-atoms, subwavelength elements made of magnetic insulators, where the
dynamical ME behavior is due to modulations and topological coupling of
magnetization and electric polarization. The interaction between EM and ME
systems occurs through virtual structures, ME virtual photons. Experimentally,
ME quantum vacuum states can be detected in a microwave cavity. The topic of
these studies concerns fundamental aspects of ME quantum electrodynamics
(MEQED).

- **TL;DR**: 该论文提出利用磁性隧道结的开关时间作为物理不可克隆函数(PUF)，通过模拟不同制造缺陷对开关时间的影响来验证可行性。

A physical unclonable function (PUF) utilizes the unclonable random
variations in a device's responses to a set of inputs to produce a unique
"biometric" that can be used for authentication. The variations are caused by
unpredictable, unclonable and random manufacturing defects. Here, we show that
the switching time of a magnetic tunnel junction injected with a spin-polarized
current generating spin transfer torque is sensitive to the nature of
structural defects introduced during manufacturing and hence can be the basis
of a PUF. We use micromagnetic simulations to study the switching times under a
constant current excitation for six different (commonly encountered) defect
morphologies in spin-transfer-torque magnetic random access memory (STT-MRAM)
to establish the viability of a PUF.

### Ginzburg-Landau theory of spin pumping through an antiferromagnetic layer near the Néel temperature

- **TL;DR**: 基于Ginzburg-Landau理论研究了铁磁体/反铁磁体/重金属三层结构中的自旋泵浦效应，发现在反铁磁奈尔温度附近存在频率依赖的自旋电流增强。

Spin pumping is a microwave-driven means for injecting spins from a
ferromagnet into the adjacent target material. The insertion of a thin
antiferromagnetic layer between the ferromagnet and the target material is
known to enhance the spin pumping signal. Here, in view of describing dynamic
fluctuations of the N\'{e}el order parameter, we develop Ginzburg-Landau theory
of the spin pumping in a ferromagnet/antiferromagnet/heavy metal trilayer in
the vicinity of the antiferromagnetic N\'{e}el temperature $T_{\rm N}$. When
there exists an interfacial exchange interaction between the ferromagnetic
spins and the antiferromagnetic N\'{e}el order parameter at the
ferromagnet/antiferromagnet interface, we find a strongly frequency-dependent
enhancement of the pumped spin current that is peaked at $T_{\rm N}$. The
present finding offers an explanation for the enhanced spin pumping with strong
frequency dependence observed in a Y$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$/CoO/Pt system.

### Classification of electromagnetic responses by quantum geometry

- **TL;DR**: 本文提出了一个统一的量子几何框架来描述布洛赫电子的双线性电荷电流，包括普通霍尔效应、磁非线性霍尔效应和平面霍尔效应，揭示了轨道和自旋双线性电流分别由传统量子几何和塞曼量子几何控制。

The nonlinear charge current $j_a=\sigma_{abc}E_bE_c$ of Bloch electrons in
quantum materials under an electric field can be well characterized by the
quantum geometry, as most exemplified by the extrinsic and intrinsic nonlinear
Hall effects induced by the Berry curvature dipole and the quantum metric
dipole, respectively. Nevertheless, a unified quantum geometric description for
the bilinear charge current $j_a=\sigma_{ab,c}E_bB_c$ of Bloch electrons driven
by the electromagnetic fields, including the ordinary Hall effect (OHE), the
magnetononlinear Hall effect (MNHE), and the planar Hall effect (PHE), remains
elusive. Herein, we show that this bilinear conductivity, as contributed by the
orbital minimal coupling and the spin Zeeman coupling of the applied magnetic
field, respectively, can be classified by the conventional quantum geometry and
the recently proposed Zeeman quantum geometry, where the symmetry constraint
from the fundamental response equation is encoded. Specifically, we uncover
that the intrinsic orbital and spin bilinear currents--responsible for the
orbital and spin MNHEs--are governed by the quantum metric quadrupole and the
Zeeman quantum metric dipole, respectively. In contrast, the extrinsic orbital
and spin bilinear currents, which are linear in the relaxation time $\tau$ and
lead to the orbital and spin PHEs, are governed by the Berry curvature
quadrupole and the Zeeman Berry curvature dipole, respectively.
Counterintuitively, we find that the OHE due to the Lorentz force can also
include an interband contribution from the quantum metric quadrupole. After
building the quantum geometric classification of this bilinear current, we
study the rarely known spin PHE with the surface Dirac cone of
three-dimensional topological insulators.

### Linear Response Selected Configuration Interaction

- **TL;DR**: 提出了基于线性响应理论的扩展构型相互作用方法(LR-SCI)，用于计算分子响应性质，能够系统收敛到全构型相互作用极限，在X射线吸收光谱和NMR耦合常数计算中表现出色。

In this work, we extend selected configuration interaction (SCI) methods
beyond energies and expectation values by introducing a linear response (LR)
framework for molecular response properties. Existing SCI approaches are
capable of approximating the energy of the full configuration interaction (FCI)
wave function with high accuracy but at a much lower cost. However,
conventional determinant selection will, by design, mainly select determinants
that are expected to improve energies, and this can lead to the omission of
many determinants that are important for wave function response. We address
this by introducing two new selection criteria motivated by linear response
theory. Using these extended determinant selection criteria, we demonstrate
that LR-SCI can systematically converge toward the FCI limit for static
polarizabilities. Using a damped LR formulation, we compute the water K-edge
X-ray absorption spectrum in active spaces up to (10e, 58o). Finally, we use
LR-SCI to compute NMR spin-spin coupling constants for water, where we find
that accuracy beyond that offered by CCSDT can be achieved. Overall, LR-SCI
offers a promising route to compute response properties with near-FCI accuracy
to systems beyond the reach of exact FCI.

### Statistical Signatures of Integrable and Non-Integrable Quantum Hamiltonians

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一个基于统计框架的两步协议来区分量子系统的可积性与不可积性，通过蒙特卡洛谱压缩和k步能隙分布分析来识别能级统计特征。

Integrability is a cornerstone of classical mechanics, where it has a precise
meaning. Extending this notion to quantum systems, however, remains subtle and
unresolved. In particular, deciding whether a quantum Hamiltonian - viewed
simply as a matrix - defines an integrable system is far from obvious, yet
crucial for understanding non-equilibrium dynamics, spectral correlations, and
correlation functions in many-body physics. We develop a statistical framework
that approaches quantum integrability from a probabilistic standpoint. A key
observation is that integrability requires a finite probability of vanishing
energy gaps. Building on this, we propose a two-step protocol to distinguish
integrable from non-integrable Hamiltonians. First, we apply a systematic Monte
Carlo decimation of the spectrum, which exponentially compresses the Hilbert
space and reveals whether level spacings approach Poisson statistics or remain
mixed. The termination point of this decimation indicates the statistical
character of the spectrum. Second, we analyze $k$-step gap distributions, which
sharpen the distinction between Poisson and mixed statistics. Our procedure
applies to Hamiltonians of any finite size, independent of whether their
structure involves a few blocks or an exponentially fragmented Hilbert space.
As a benchmark, we implement the protocol on quantum Hamiltonians built from
the permutation group $\mathcal{S}_N$, demonstrating both its effectiveness and
generality.

### Fully automated inverse co-optimization of templates and block copolymer blending recipes for DSA lithography

- **Categories**: physics.comp-ph, cs.AI, cs.CE
- **TL;DR**: 提出基于高斯描述符的模板形状参数化方法和AB/AB二元共混物策略，结合贝叶斯优化实现模板形状与共混物的协同优化，用于导向嵌段共聚物的自组装以制造亚7nm接触孔。

The directed self-assembly (DSA) of block copolymers (BCPs) offers a highly
promising approach for the fabrication of contact holes or vertical
interconnect access at sub-7nm technology nodes. To fabricate circular holes
with precisely controlled size and positions, the self-assembly of block
copolymers requires guidance from a properly designed template. Effectively
parameterizing the template shape to enable efficient optimization remains a
critical yet challenging problem. Moreover, the optimized template must possess
excellent manufacturability for practical applications. In this work, we
propose a Gaussian descriptor for characterizing the template shape with only
two parameters. We further propose to use AB/AB binary blends instead of pure
diblock copolymer to improve the adaptability of the block copolymer system to
the template shape. The Bayesian optimization (BO) is applied to co-optimize
the binary blend and the template shape. Our results demonstrate that BO based
on the Gaussian descriptor can efficiently yield the optimal templates for
diverse multi-hole patterns, all leading to highly matched self-assembled
morphologies. Moreover, by imposing constraints on the variation of curvature
of the template during optimization, superior manufacturability is ensured for
each optimized template. It is noteworthy that each key parameter of the blend
exhibits a relatively wide tunable window under the requirement of rather high
precision. Our work provides valuable insights for advancing DSA technology,
and thus potentially propels its practical applications forward.

### Slow-phonon control of spin Edelstein effect in Rashba $d$-wave altermagnets

- **TL;DR**: 研究慢晶格振动（声子）对二维d波反铁磁体中自旋极化的影响，发现中等至强电子-声子耦合会通过带内和带间通道抑制诱导极化，存在临界耦合导致完全自旋Edelstein去极化。

Altermagnets have zero net magnetization yet feature spin-split bands that
host spin-polarized states. Here, we investigate how slow lattice vibrations
(phonons) influence both the intrinsic and externally induced spin
polarizations in two-dimensional $d$-wave altermagnets. For the induced spin
polarizations, we employ a Rashba continuum model with electron-phonon coupling
(EPC) treated at the static-Holstein level and analyze the spin Edelstein
effect using the Kubo linear-response formalism. We find that
moderate-to-strong EPC progressively suppresses the induced polarization via
both intraband and interband channels, with a critical coupling marking the
onset of complete spin Edelstein depolarization. The depolarization transition
arises from a phonon-induced energy renormalization that pushes the spin-split
bands anisotropically above the chemical potential, leading to a complete
collapse of the Fermi surface. While (de)polarization can occur even in the
Rashba non-altermagnetic phase, it remains isotropic. The presence of
altermagnetism makes it anisotropic and breaks the conventional antisymmetry
between spin susceptibilities that occurs with pure spin-orbit coupling,
rendering the effect highly relevant for spintronic applications. We further
investigate how the phonon coupling to the altermagnetic order, Rashba
spin-orbit strength, and carrier doping collectively tune the depolarization
transition. Our findings demonstrate that phonon scattering (e.g., through
various substrates) offers a powerful means for on-demand control of spin
polarization, enabling reversible switching between spin-polarized and
depolarized states -- a key functionality for advancing spin logic
architectures and optimizing next-generation spintronic devices.

### Unusual spin-triplet superconductivity in monolayer graphene

In this paper we consider the phonons in monolayer graphene and we show the
possibility for the spin-triplet superconducting excitations states by
discretizing the single-particle excitations near Fermi wave vector. The
molonayer graphene was supposed to be exposed under the influence of the
external gate-potential and the local Coulomb interaction effects have been
taken into account at each lattice site position in the monolayer. A
sufficiently large temperature domain was found, where the superconducting
order parameter is not vanishing. Corresponding to this, at the surprisingly
high temperature limit, we obtain a narrow domain of the electron-phonon
coupling parameter $\lambda_{\rm eff}$, emphasizing the superconducting state.
We discuss the localizing role of Hubbard-$U$ interaction and the effects
external gate potential on the calculated physical parameters in the system. We
explain the importance of the chemical potential in the formation of the
superconducting state. We show the existence of a large superconducting
band-gap in the system even in the case of the absence of the applied electric
field potential.

### Uncovering origins of heterogeneous superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using quantum sensors

The family of nickelate superconductors have long been explored as analogs of
the high temperature cuprates. Nonetheless, the recent discovery that certain
stoichiometric nickelates superconduct up to high $T_c$ under pressure came as
a surprise. The mechanisms underlying the superconducting state remain
experimentally unclear. In addition to the practical challenges posed by
working in a high pressure environment, typical samples exhibit anomalously
weak diamagnetic responses, which have been conjectured to reflect
inhomogeneous `filamentary' superconducting states. We perform wide-field,
high-pressure, optically detected magnetic resonance spectroscopy to image the
local diamagnetic responses of as grown La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ samples \emph{in
situ}, using nitrogen vacancy quantum sensors embedded in the diamond anvil
cell. These maps confirm significant inhomogeneity of the functional
superconducting responses at the few micron scale. By spatially correlating the
diamagnetic Meissner response with both the local tensorial stress environment,
also imaged \emph{in situ}, and stoichiometric composition, we unravel the
dominant mechanisms suppressing and enhancing superconductivity. Our wide-field
technique simultaneously provides a broad view of sample behavior and excellent
local sensitivity, enabling the rapid construction of multi-parameter phase
diagrams from the local structure-function correlations observed at the
sub-micron pixel scale.

### Weak localization and antilocalization corrections to nonlinear transport: a semiclassical Boltzmann treatment

- **TL;DR**: 研究弱(反)局域化对二维系统中二阶非线性输运的影响，发现局域化效应可导致非线性电导率张量符号改变

The nonlinear transport regime is manifested in the nonlinear current-voltage
characteristic of the system. An example of such a nonlinear regime is a setup
in which current is injected into the sample and the measured voltage drop is
quadratic in the injected current. Such a quadratic nonlinear regime requires
inversion symmetry to be broken. This is the same symmetry condition as one
needs to observe weak antilocalization, which can be prominent in
two-dimensional systems. Here, we study the effects of weak (anti)localization
on second-order nonlinear transport in two-dimensional systems using the
semiclassical Boltzmann approach. We solve for quasiparticle distribution
function up to the second order in the applied external electric field and
calculate linear and nonlinear conductivity tensors for a toy model. We find
that localization effects could lead to a sign change of the nonlinear
conductivity tensor -- a phenomenon observed in single-layer graphene devices.

- **TL;DR**: 通过水热法合成自组装分级结构的赤铁矿，掺杂钴后获得Co0.05Fe0.95O3电极，在胆固醇检测中表现出高灵敏度、快速响应和优异稳定性。

Herein, a self-assembled hierarchical structure of hematite
($\alpha$-$Fe_2O_3$) was synthesized via a one-pot hydrothermal method.
Subsequently, the nanomaterial was doped to get $M_{x}Fe_{2-x}O_3$ (M = Mn-Co;
x = 0.01, 0.05, 0.1) at precise concentrations. The electrode was fabricated by
coating the resulting nanocomposite onto a Nickel Foam (NF) substrate. The
electrochemical characterization demonstrated the excellent performance of
cobalt-doped $\alpha$-$Fe_2O_3$, among which, $Co_0.05Fe_0.95O_3$ (CF5)
exhibited superior performance, showing a two-fold increase in sensitivity of
1364.2 $\mu$A.m$M^{-1}$.$cm^{-2}$ $(\pm 0.03, n = 3)$ in 0.5 M KOH, a Limit of
Detection (LOD) of $\sim 0.17 mM$, and a Limit of Quantification (LOQ) of
{\sim}0.58 mM. Density Functional Theory (DFT) was performed to understand the
doping prompting in the reduced bandgap. The fabricated electrode displayed a
rapid response time of 2 s and demonstrated 95% stability, excellent
reproducibility, and selectivity, as confirmed by tests with several
interfering species. A comprehensive evaluation of the electrode's performance
using human blood serum highlighted its robustness and reliability for
cholesterol detection in clinical settings, making it a promising tool for
clinical and pharmaceutical applications.

### Finite-size fluctuations for stochastic coupled oscillators: A general theory

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一个通用框架来量化全局耦合非线性振荡器同步转变中的有限尺寸效应，通过中心流形约简推导出序参量的Langevin方程，首次给出了包含完整有限尺寸效应的序参量稳态分布。

Phase transitions, sharp in the thermodynamic limit, get smeared in finite
systems where macroscopic order-parameter fluctuations dominate. Achieving a
coherent and complete theoretical description of these fluctuations is a
central challenge. We develop a general framework to quantify these finite-size
effects in synchronization transitions of generic stochastic, globally-coupled
nonlinear oscillators. By applying a center-manifold reduction to the nonlinear
stochastic PDE for the single-oscillator distribution in finite systems, we
derive a mesoscopic description that yields the complete time evolution of the
order parameter in the form of a Langevin equation. In particular, this
equation provides the first closed-form steady-state distribution of the order
parameter, fully capturing finite-size effects. Free from integrability
constraints and the celebrated Ott-Antonsen ansatz, our theory shows excellent
agreement with simulations across diverse coupling functions and frequency
distributions, demonstrating broad applicability. Strikingly, it surpasses
recent approaches near criticality and in the incoherent phase, where
finite-size fluctuations are most pronounced.

### A review on the Parameter Space Concept and its use for crystal structure determination

- **TL;DR**: 本文综述了参数空间概念(PSC)这一新兴晶体结构测定方法，该方法通过将实验或理论观测映射为几何解释来求解和精修晶体结构，绕过了传统的傅里叶反演。

We present a comprehensive review of the emerging crystal structure
determination method Parameter Space Concept (PSC), which solves and refines
either partial or complete crystal structures by mapping each experimental or
theoretical observation as a geometric interpretation, bypassing the
conventional Fourier inversion. The PSC utilizes only a few \xray (equivalently
neutron) diffraction amplitudes or intensities and turns them into piecewise
analytic hyper-surfaces, called isosurfaces, embedded in a higher-dimensional
orthonormal Cartesian space (Parameter Space (PS)). It reformulates the crystal
determination task into a geometric interpretation, searching for a common
intersection point of different isosurfaces. The art of defining various kinds
of isosurfaces, based on signs, amplitude or intensity values, normalized
ratios, and ranking of reflections, offers multiple choices of adapting methods
in PSC based on available experimental or theoretical observations. The
elegance of PSC stems from one-dimensional projections of atomic coordinates,
enabling the construction of full three-dimensional crystal structures by
combining multiple projections. By these means, the user may explore homometric
and non-homometric solutions within both centric and acentric structures with
spatial resolution remarkably down to pm, even with a limited number of
diffraction reflections. Having demonstrated the potential of PSC for various
synthetic structures and exemplarily verified direct application to realistic
crystals, the origin and development of PSC methods are coherently discussed in
this review. Notably, this review emphasizes the theoretical foundations,
computational strategies, and potential extensions of PSC, outlining the
roadmap for future applications of PSC in the broader context of structure
determination from experimental diffraction observations.

### Spin polarization engineering in $d$-wave altermagnets

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种多场调控方法来工程化d波交变磁体中的自旋极化，包括门控、光驱动和面内电场，实现了沿多个方向的可调谐和可切换极化。

Altermagnets host unconventional spin-polarized bands despite zero net
magnetization, but controlling their spin structure remains challenging. We
propose a multi-field approach to engineer spin polarization in $d$-wave
altermagnets using gating, optical driving, and in-plane electric fields, which
enable tunable and switchable polarizations along multiple directions. Optical
driving induces out-of-plane ($z$) polarization, while gating and in-plane
fields generate $x$- and $y$-polarizations via the Edelstein effect, all of
which are experimentally detectable. We further find that spin- and
band-selective doping induces chiral optical activity, a feature unique to
altermagnets. Our approach provides a versatile route for full control of spin
polarization in altermagnets.

### Four Moiré materials at One Magic Angle in Helical Quadrilayer Graphene

We introduce helical twisted quadrilayer graphene (HTQG), four graphene
sheets rotated by the same small angle, as a versatile and experimentally
accessible platform for correlated topological matter. HTQG consists of three
moir\'e lattices, formed by interference between adjacent graphene layers, that
are twisted relative to each other. Lattice relaxation produces four types of
large-scale commensurate domains. The domains are characterized by the stacking
of the three moir\'e lattices and come in two types: Type-I "Bernal" stacking
and Type-II "rhombohedral" stacking. Domain walls between adjacent stackings
often host topologically protected edge states, forming networks at the
supermoir\'e and super-supermoir\'e scales. Remarkably, all four moir\'e
substructures have narrow bands at the same magic angle $\theta \approx
2.3^\circ$, allowing their correlated phases to be simultaneously targeted in
device manufacturing. We argue that the Type-I domains are especially suitable
for realizing robust superconductivity which emerges from doping topological
insulators, and Chern insulators in $C = \pm 2$ bands.

\mathbf{d}\cdot\mathbf{N}$ are spin-rotation invariant and can condense at
finite temperature. Using a large-$N$ approach that respects the Mermin-Wagner
theorem, we here derive the phase diagram which features two vestigial
superconductors: $(A)$ a charge-$4e$ superconductor with $\phi_{dd}\neq 0$ and
$\phi_{dN} =0$ and $(B)$ a charge-$2e$ state with $\phi_{dN} ,\phi_{dd}\neq 0$.
We analyze the temperature and coupling-constant dependent properties of these
two superconductors using a perturbative approach and a variational
Hartree-Fock study. This reveals non-trivial spectra in the superconductors,
which result from the fundamental building blocks being distinct from the usual
Cooper pairs--in phase $(A)$, the elementary bosons are bound states of four
electrons and, in phase $(B)$, of three electrons and a hole. This work
complements the previous study [Nat. Commun. 15, 1713 (2024),
arXiv:2301.01344], which focused on the properties of phase $(B)$.

We experimentally investigate magnetocaloric effect for single crystals of
MnTe altermagnet at the transition to the state with spontaneous spin
polarization, i.e. well below the N\'eel temperature of MnTe. The isothermal
magnetic entropy change $\Delta S$ is calculated from the experimental
magnetization curves by using Maxwell relation. We observe well-defined
magnetocaloric effect as a narrow $\Delta S$ peak around the cricital
temperature $T_c\approx 81$~K, which is accompanied by sharp magnetization
jump. This behavior is unusual for standard ferromagnetic transitions, so it
confirms the predicted spin-orbit-induced spin polarization in the MnTe
altermagnetic state.

We investigate the critical behavior of the one-dimensional Ising model with
long-range interactions using the functional renormalization group in the local
potential approximation (LPA), and compare our findings with Dyson's
hierarchical model (DHM). While the DHM lacks translational invariance, it
admits a field-theoretical description closely resembling the LPA, up to minor
but nontrivial differences. After reviewing the real-space renormalization
group approach to the DHM, we demonstrate a remarkable agreement in the
critical exponent $\nu$ between the two methods across the entire range of
power-law decays $1/2 &lt; \sigma &lt; 1$. We further benchmark our results against
Monte Carlo simulations and analytical expansions near the upper boundary of
the nontrivial regime, $\sigma \lesssim 1$.

### Improper-proper ferroelectric competition as a mechanism for multistate polarisation and ferrielectric-like behaviour

- **TL;DR**: Error

In this paper, we re-explore a simple textbook Landau model describing
improper ferroelectricity and show that in the limit where both proper and
improper instabilities exist and compete, improper ferroelectrics can display
switching between multiple polarisation states. Using first principles
calculations we highlight how the hexagonal tungsten bronze materials may be an
archetypal case, with the possibility to switch between improper and proper
phases. The resulting functional characteristics are akin to "ferrielectrics",
with switching behaviour in the form of a triple hysteresis loop. Such
functionality could be ideal for creating non-volatile multistate systems for
use in memory devices or as a backbone for neuromorphic computing.

- **TL;DR**: 成功在4H-SiC(0001)衬底上生长了180纳米厚的FeO异质外延薄膜，克服了FeO在常温下热力学不稳定的问题

Iron(II) monoxide (FeO) is thermodynamically stable in the halite (w\"ustite)
structure only at elevated temperatures in a typically non-stoichiometric,
Fe-deficient, Fe$_{1-z}$O form that tends to phase separate and/or transform
into metallic $\alpha$-Fe and magnetite Fe$_3$O$_4$ at ambient conditions. Here
we report on the successful growth of up to 180 nm thick $(111)$-oriented FeO
heteroepitaxial films on slightly lattice-matched 4H-SiC$(0001)$ using
molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). The films have flat, terraced surfaces with tall
multi-layer steps. X-ray diffraction (XRD), high-resolution scanning
transmission electron microscopy (S/TEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(EDS), and core-level electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) collectively
confirm the epilayer as phase-pure w\"ustite FeO, with atomically sharp FeO/SiC
interfaces. The films are found to exhibit a slight misfit strain-induced
rhombohedral distortion that does not appear to vary over the range of
thicknesses examined. These results demonstrate the power of epitaxial
stabilization for integrating a thermodynamically unstable, yet functionally
interesting material with a commercially available and technologically
important semiconductor platform.

### Detecting quantum spin liquid on Kitaev model through a superconducting junction

- **TL;DR**: 该论文研究了从超导金属向Kitaev量子自旋液体注入自旋电流的理论机制，揭示了自旋电流特征与Majorana费米子激发之间的关联，为量子自旋液体的实验探测提供了新方法。

The Kitaev model belongs to an unconventional class of two-dimensional spin
systems characterized by anisotropic, bond-dependent interactions that give
rise to Quantum Spin Liquid (QSL) states. These exotic phases, marked by the
absence of magnetic ordering even at zero temperature, support fractionalized
excitations and emergent gauge fields. A particularly compelling feature of the
Kitaev model is its exact solvability, which reveals low-energy excitations in
the form of itinerant Majorana fermions-quasiparticles that obey non-Abelian
statistics and are of central interest in topological quantum computation due
to their inherent robustness against local perturbations and decoherence.
Despite extensive theoretical advancements, the experimental identification of
QSLs remains challenging, as conventional magnetic probes fail to detect their
defining properties. In this work, we present a theoretical investigation of
spin current injection from a superconducting metal into a Kitaev quantum spin
liquid. By employing a spintronic framework, we derive the dynamics of the
injected spin current and demonstrate how its signatures can be traced back to
the underlying Majorana excitations in the spin liquid phase. Superconductivity
plays a pivotal role in this context, not only as a source of coherent
quasiparticles but also as a platform with potential for interfacing with
topological quantum devices. Our analysis contrasts the Kitaev-superconductor
interface with conventional ferromagnetic junctions, where spin transport is
carried by magnons, and highlights distinctive features in the spin current
response. These findings open new directions for the detection of QSLs and
contribute to the broader effort of integrating topological quantum materials
into scalable quantum technologies.

### Finite-size and quenching effects on hyperuniform structures formed during cooling

The outstanding physical properties of hyperuniform condensed matter systems
holds significant promise for technological applications and studying effects
that may disrupt this hidden order is therefore very important. Vortex matter
in superconductors is a model system to study this problem since imaging
experiments have revealed that correlated disorder in the host media and finite
size effects disrupt the hyperuniformity of the in-plane arrangement of
vortices. Here we report simulations of layered interacting elastic lines as a
model for the vortex lattice in three-dimensional superconductors, following a
cooling protocol that closely mimics the experimental conditions. We show that
finite-thickness effects limiting the hyperuniformity range arise both in
equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium. Our results provide a theoretical framework
to draw a realistic road-map on synthesizing hyperuniform materials when
cooling structures on finite host media with disorder.

- **TL;DR**: 本文提出了一种通过量子霍尔平台宽度来表征半导体异质结构无序性的替代方法，克服了传统基于渗流临界密度测量的困难。

Understanding scattering mechanisms in semiconductor heterostructures is
crucial to reducing sources of disorder and ensuring high yield and uniformity
in large spin qubit arrays. Disorder of the parent two-dimensional electron or
hole gas is commonly estimated by the critical, percolation-driven density
associated with the metal-insulator transition. However, a reliable estimation
of the critical density within percolation theory is hindered by the need to
measure conductivity with high precision at low carrier densities, where
experiments are most difficult. Here, we connect experimentally percolation
density and quantum Hall plateau width, in line with an earlier heuristic
intuition, and offer an alternative method for characterizing semiconductor
heterostructure disorder.

### Numerical methods for quasi-stationary distributions

- **TL;DR**: 本文重新审视了计算准静态分布的两种数值方法：一种适用于一般马尔可夫随机过程的迭代算法，以及一种使用单轨迹历史进行重置的蒙特卡洛方法。

In stochastic processes with absorbing states, the quasi-stationary
distribution provides valuable insights into the long-term behaviour prior to
absorption. In this work, we revisit two well-established numerical methods for
its computation. The first is an iterative algorithm for solving the non-linear
equation that defines the quasi-stationary distribution. We generalise this
technique to accommodate general Markov stochastic processes, either with
discrete or continuous state space, and with multiple absorbing states. The
second is a Monte Carlo method with resetting, for which we propose a novel
single-trajectory approach that uses the trajectory's own history to perform
resets after absorption. In addition to these methodological contributions, we
provide a detailed analysis of implementation aspects for both methods. We also
compare their accuracy and efficiency across a range of examples. The results
indicate that the iterative algorithm is generally the preferred choice for
problems with simple boundaries, while the Monte Carlo approach is more
suitable for problems with complex boundaries, where the implementation of the
iterative algorithm is a challenging task.

- **TL;DR**: 开发了一个预测框架，通过DFT计算和机器学习选择能抑制铌氧化物形成的金属覆盖层，识别出Zr、Hf、Ta等有效扩散阻挡层材料。

Surface oxides are associated with two-level systems (TLSs) that degrade the
performance of niobium-based superconducting quantum computing devices. To
address this, we introduce a predictive framework for selecting metal capping
layers that inhibit niobium oxide formation. Using DFT-calculated oxygen
interstitial and vacancy energies as thermodynamic descriptors, we train a
logistic regression model on a limited set of experimental outcomes to
successfully predict the likelihood of oxide formation beneath different
capping materials. This approach identifies Zr, Hf, and Ta as effective
diffusion barriers. Our analysis further reveals that the oxide formation
energy per oxygen atom serves as an excellent standalone descriptor for
predicting barrier performance. By combining this new descriptor with lattice
mismatch as a secondary criterion to promote structurally coherent interfaces,
we identify Zr, Ta, and Sc as especially promising candidates. This closed-loop
strategy integrates first-principles theory, machine learning, and limited
experimental data to enable rational design of next-generation materials.

### Spin-dependent orbital selectivity and partial Kondo-screening in magnetically ordered Hund's metal

Hund's metallicity in 3$d$ transition metal oxides constitutes a rare class
of compounds, since they have been long understood considering the dominance of
Hubbard $U$. $\mathrm{LiV_2O_4}$\& $\mathrm{Sr_2CoO_4}$ belong to this rare
class of metals; among them, $\mathrm{LiV_2O_4}$ has been the subject of
extensive investigations for its unconventional heavy-fermion behavior, while
studies on $\mathrm{Sr_2CoO_4}$ remain limited despite its anomalous
ferromagnetic ground state. In this study, we report an unusual spin-orbital
selective localization in $\mathrm{Sr_2CoO_4}$ leading to a sharp Kondo
resonance at $\sim$70 K in the spin-$up$ channel of orbitals of $t_{2g}$
symmetry using a combination of Density functional theory and Dynamical mean
field theory (DFT+DMFT) calculations. Correspondingly, an appreciable reduction
in the magnetization below $T$=100 K further suggests partial Kondo screening
of local moments active at low temperatures, explaining its effective spin
magnetization state and upturn in its resistivity observed in experimental
reports. We note a significant effect of Hund's induced spin-orbital selective
incoherence in dictating the temperature evolution of its macroscopic
observables e.g. spin-spin correlation function and effective local moment. Our
results reveal a potentially distinct/new form of spin-dependent selectivity
induced via Hund's coupling in addition to the conventional orbital-selectivity
in the Hund's metals, as a plausible key mechanism in stabilizing their
long-range magnetic order.

We demonstrate a highly linear superconducting quantum interference device
(SQUID) amplifier based on a double-loop (Bi-SQUID) architecture incorporating
three superconductor-normal metal-superconductor (S-N-S) junctions. Fabricated
using niobium-gold technology, the device exhibits robust operation at liquid
helium temperatures, with a superconducting transition temperature of 8.5 K.
The flux-to-voltage transfer function demonstrates sharp, symmetric, and highly
linear behavior at temperatures up to 5 K. Bi-SQUIDs featuring our
single-element S-N-S design represent an interesting and original approach to
this field, as they demonstrate a numerically estimated spurious-free dynamic
range (SFDR) linearity exceeding 60 dB, achieved in a single element,
simplifying the requirements in terms of arrays containing hundreds of
junctions. These results highlight the potential of proximity-based Bi-SQUIDs
for compact, low-noise, and highly linear cryogenic amplifiers in quantum
sensing, magnetometry, and biomedical diagnostics.

A comparative study of anomalous-Hall current injection and anisotropic
current injection (through planar Hall effect) are studied in Hall devices
contacted to a lateral load circuit. Hall currents are injected into the load
circuit from three different kinds of magnetic Hall bars: Mn5Si3 altermagnet,
Co75Gd25 ferrimagnet, and Ni80Fe20 ferromagnet. The current, the voltage and
the power are measured as a function of the load resistance and the Hall angle.
It is observed that the power dissipated for the three kinds of materials
fellow the same law as a function of load resistance and Hall angle, at the
leading order in the Hall angle. Since the anomalous Hall effect in the
altermagnetic Hall-bar is due to the intrinsic topological structure (i.e. due
to the presence of a Berry phase in the reciprocal space), these observations
suggest that the dissipative properties of anomalous Hall effect are dominated
by the injection of electric charges accumulated at the edges (including
electric screening), instead of the very mechanism responsible for it.

The random clusters introduced by Fortuin and Kasteleyn (FK) and analyzed by
Coniglio and Klein (CK) for Ising and related models have led first Swendsen
and Wang and then Wolff to formulate remarkably efficient Markov chain Monte
Carlo sampling schemes that weaken the critical slowing down. In frustrated
models, however, no standard way to produce a comparable gain at small
frustration -- let alone efficiently sample the large frustration regime -- has
yet been identified. In order to understand why formulating appropriate cluster
criteria for frustrated models has thus far been elusive, we here study minimal
short-range attractive and long-range repulsive as well as spin-glass models on
Bethe lattices. Using a generalization of the CK approach and the cavity-field
method, the appropriateness and limitations of the FK--CK type clusters are
identified. We find that a standard, constructive cluster scheme is then
inoperable, and that the frustration range over which generalized FK--CK
clusters are even definable is finite. These results demonstrate the futility
of seeking constructive cluster schemes for frustrated systems but leaves open
the possibility that alternate approaches could be devised.

### The line bundle regime and the scale-dependence of continuum dislocation dynamics

Continuum dislocation dynamics (CDD) has become the state-of-the-art
theoretical approach for mesoscale dislocation plasticity of metals. Within
this approach, there are multiple CDD theories that can all be derived from the
principles of statistical mechanics. In these theories density-based measures
are used to represent dislocation lines. Establishing these density measures
requires some level of coarse graining with the result of losing track of some
parts of the dislocation population due to cancellation in the tangent vectors
of unaligned dislocations. The leading CDD theories either treat dislocations
as nearly parallel or distributed locally over orientation space. The
difference between these theories is a matter of the spatial resolution at
which the definition of the relevant dislocation density field holds: for fine
resolutions, single dislocations are resolved and there is no cancellation; for
coarse resolutions, whole dislocation loops could contribute at a single point
and there is complete cancellation. In the current work, a formulation of the
resolution-dependent transition between these limits is presented in terms of
the statistics of dislocation line orientation fluctuations about a local
average line direction. From this formulation, a study of the orientation
fluctuation behavior in intermediate resolution regimes is conducted. Two
possible closure equations for truncating the moment sequence of the
fluctuation distributions relating the two theories mentioned above are
evaluated from data, the newly introduced line bundle closure and the previous
standard maximum entropy closure relations. The line bundle closure relation is
shown to be accurate for coarse-graining lengths up to half the dislocation
spacing and the maximum entropy closure is found to poorly agree with the data
at all coarse-graining lengths.

Two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnets drive the advancement in
spintronic applications and enable the exploration of exotic magnetism in
low-dimensional systems. The entanglement of dual $-$ localized and itinerant
$-$ nature of electrons lies at the heart of the correlated electron systems
giving rise to exotic ground state properties such as complex magnetism, heavy
fermionic behavior, Kondo lattice formation, \textit{etc}. Through
temperature-dependent electronic structure of vdW ferromagnets,
(Co$_{x}$Fe$_{1-x}$)$_{3}$GeTe$_{2}$, probed using high-resolution
photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory combined with
dynamical mean field theory (DFT+DMFT), we provide direct evidence of the
emergence of Kondo resonance peak driven by complex interplay between localized
and itinerant electrons. In overall agreement with experimental electronic
structure and magnetic properties, DFT+DMFT also reveals finite spin band
splitting well beyond $T_{C}$. Core levels, valence band photoemission spectra
together with DFT+DMFT spectral functions reveal insignificant change across
$T_{C}$ indicating non-Stoner magnetism in
(Co$_{x}$Fe$_{1-x}$)$_{3}$GeTe$_{2}$. Our results provide a way forward to the
understanding of complex interplay between electronic structure, exotic
magnetism and heavy fermionic behavior leading to Kondo scenerio in 3$d$ vdW
ferromagnets.

Ternary transition-metal germanide superconductors with nonsymmorphic
symmetries offer promising platforms for symmetry-protected topological phases.
In this work, we investigate ZrIrGe, which crystallizes in the nonsymmorphic
TiNiSi-type structure. Electrical, magnetic, and specific heat measurements
confirm bulk type-II superconductivity with a full gap and a transition
temperature of 2.84(7) K, consistent with weak-coupling BCS behavior.
First-principles calculations reveal hourglass-shaped bulk band dispersions and
a Dirac chain composed of symmetry-protected fourfold-degenerate Dirac points,
leading to drumhead-like surface states near the Fermi level. Additionally,
ZrIrGe exhibits a nontrivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological character, resulting in
helical surface states that cross the Fermi level, making it a strong candidate
for proximity-induced topological superconductivity. The coexistence of
conventional superconductivity and topological band features establishes ZrIrGe
as a rare stoichiometric system for exploring intrinsic topological
superconductivity.

Magneto-optical excitations in antiferromagnetic d systems can originate from
a multiplicity of light-spin and spin-spin interactions, as the light and spin
degrees of freedom can be entangled. This is exemplified in van der Waals
systems with attendant strong anisotropy between in-plane and out-of-plane
directions, such as MnPS3 and NiPS3 films studied here. The rich interplay
between the magnetic ordering and sub-bandgap optical transitions poses a
challenge to resolve the mechanisms driving spin-entangled optical transitions,
as well as the single-particle bandgap itself. Here we employ a high-fidelity
ab initio theory to find a realistic estimation of the bandgap by elucidating
the atom- and orbital-resolved contributions to the fundamental sub-bands. We
further demonstrate that the spin-entangled excitations, observable as
photoluminescence and absorption resonances, originate from an on-site

In this paper, we assess how the stability of financial networks is affected
by interconnectedness considering its tiniest variation: the edge. We compute
the impact of edges as the percentage difference in the systemic risk (SR) of
the whole network caused by the inclusion of that edge. We apply this framework
to a thorough Brazilian dataset to compute the impact of bank-firm edges. After
observing that (i) edges are heterogeneous regarding their impact on the SR,
and (ii) the fraction of edges whose impact on the SR is non-positive increases
with the level of the initial shock, we use machine learning techniques to try
to predict two variables: the criticality of the edges (defining as critical an
edge whose impact on SR is significantly greater than that of the others) and
the sign of the edge impact. The level of accuracy obtained in these prediction
exercises was very high. These results have important implications for the
development macroprudential policies aimed at financial stability. Our
framework allows to identify, based on features related to the origin and
destination nodes of the edge (i.e., the lending bank and the borrowing firm),
whether an additional loan will have a significant and positive impact on the
SR.

- **TL;DR**: 通过RIXS和团簇计算研究La2CuO4的双磁子激发，发现双磁子在Cu L-edge RIXS中增强，其色散平坦且符合Hubbard模型而非仅最近邻交换的Heisenberg模型，表明高阶自旋耦合对理解铜氧化物双磁子动力学很重要。

We report on the study of the magnetic excitations of Mott insulator La2CuO4
by using resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) and cluster calculations
within the framework of exact diagonalization. Our results demonstrate
experimentally that the bimagnon excitation in Cu L-edge RIXS is enhanced if
the incident x-ray energy is slightly above the absorption edge. Through
incident-energy-dependent momentum-resolved RIXS, we investigated the
excitation of the bimagnon with predominantly A1 symmetry. The bimagnons of
La2CuO4 exhibit a nearly flat dispersion with momentum along the Cu-O bond
direction. This observation agrees with the bimagnon dispersion from the
calculations on a single-band Hubbard model rather than a Heisenberg model with
only the nearest neighbor exchange interaction. This means that the effect of
the higher-order spin couplings such as the cyclic or ring exchange
interactions caused by the coherent motion of electrons beyond nearest-neighbor
sites is important for understanding the bimagnon dynamics of cuprates.

### Polarization dependence of spin-electric transitions in molecular exchange qubits

Quasi-optical experiments are emerging as a powerful technique to probe
magnetic transitions in molecular spin systems. However, the simultaneous
presence of the electric- and magnetic-dipole induced transitions poses the
challenge of discriminating between these two contributions. Besides, the
identification of the spin-electric transitions can hardly rely on the peak
intensity, because of the current uncertainties on the value of the
spin-electric coupling in most molecular compounds. Here, we compute the
polarizations required for electric- and magnetic-dipole induced transitions
through spin-Hamiltonian models of molecular spin triangles. We show that the
polarization allows a clear discrimination between the two kinds of
transitions. In addition, it allows one to identify the physical origin of the
zero-field splitting in the ground multiplet, a debated issue with significant
implications on the coherence properties of the spin qubit implemented in
molecular spin triangles.

### Analytical solution of a free-fermion chain with time-dependent ramps

We provide an exact analytical solution of the single-particle Schr\"odinger
equation for a chain of non-interacting fermions subject to a time-dependent
linear potential, with its slope varied as an arbitrary function of time. The
resulting dynamics exhibit self-similar behavior, with a structure reminiscent
of the domain wall melting problem, albeit characterized by a nontrivial
time-dependent length scale and phase. Building on this solution, we derive
hydrodynamic predictions for the evolution of particle density, current, and
entanglement entropy along the chain. In the special case of a sudden quench,
the system develops a breathing interface region, which may be interpreted as a
realization of Wannier-Stark localization, as previously suggested on the basis
of hydrodynamic arguments.

The discovery of high-performance thermoelectric materials requires models
that are both accurate and interpretable. Traditional machine learning
approaches, while effective at property prediction, often act as black boxes
and provide limited physical insight. In this work, we introduce
Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks (KANs) for the prediction of thermoelectric
properties, focusing on the Seebeck coefficient and band gap. Compared to
multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), KANs achieve comparable predictive accuracy
while offering explicit symbolic representations of structure--property
relationships. This dual capability enables both reliable predictions and the
extraction of physically meaningful functional forms. Benchmarking against
literature models further highlights the robustness and generalisability of the
approach. Our findings demonstrate that KANs provide a powerful framework for
reverse engineering materials with targeted thermoelectric properties, bridging
the gap between predictive performance and scientific interpretability.

### Modeling Quantum Geometry for Fractional Chern Insulators with unsupervised learning

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种基于无监督机器学习的方法，通过变分自编码器建模分数陈绝缘体中的单粒子形状因子分布，能够区分拓扑态并生成新的拓扑特征，为拓扑量子系统的逆向设计提供新途径。

Fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) in moire materials present a unique
platform for exploring strongly correlated topological phases beyond the
paradigm of ideal quantum geometry. While analytical approaches to FCIs and
fractional quantum Hall states (FQHS) often rely on idealized Bloch
wavefunctions, realistic moire models lack direct tunability of quantum metric
and Berry curvature, limiting theoretical and numerical exploration. Here, we
introduce an unsupervised machine learning framework to model interacting
Hamiltonians directly through the distribution of single-particle form factors.
Using a variational autoencoder (VAE), we show that unsupervised learning can
not only distinguish FCI and non-FCI states, but also generate new form factors
with distinct topological character, not present in the training set. This
latent space enables the generation and interpolation of form factors for
topological flatbands with Chern number $|C|=1$, enabling the discovery of
unobserved many-body states such as charge density waves. Principal component
analysis (PCA) further reveals that the dominant patterns in the form
factors-reflecting correlations across the Brillouin zone-can be decomposed
into components with approximately quantized Chern numbers, providing new
insights into the global and topological structure of quantum geometry. Our
results highlight the ability of machine learning to generalize and model
topological quantum systems, paving the way for the inverse design of form
factors with tailored quantum geometry and many-body phases in flatband
materials.

### Spatial uniformity of g-tensor and spin-orbit interaction in germanium hole spin qubits

Holes in Ge/SiGe heterostructures are now a leading platform for
semiconductor spin qubits, thanks to the high confinement quality,
two-dimensional arrays, high tunability, and larger gate structure dimensions.
One limiting factor for the operation of large arrays of qubits is the
considerable variation in qubit frequencies or properties resulting from the
strongly anisotropic $g$-tensor. We study the $g$-tensors of six and seven
qubits in an array with a Y geometry across two devices. We report a mean
distribution of the tilts of the $g$-tensor's out-of-plane principal axis of
around $1.1 \deg$, where nearby quantum dots are more likely to have a similar
tilt. Independently of this tilt, and unlike simple theoretical predictions, we
find a strong in-plane $g$-tensor anisotropy with strong correlations between
neighboring quantum dots. Additionally, in one device where the principal axes
of all g-tensors are aligned along the [100] crystal direction, we extract the
spin-flip tunneling vector from adjacent dot pairs and find a pattern that is
consistent with a uniform Dresselhaus-like spin-orbit field. The Y arrangement
of the gate layout and quantum dots allows us to rule out local factors like
electrostatic confinement shape or local strain as the origin of the
preferential direction. Our results reveal long-range correlations in the
spin-orbit interaction and $g$-tensors that were not previously predicted or
observed, and could prove critical to reliably understand $g$-tensors in
germanium quantum dots.

### Minimal-Dissipation Learning for Energy-Based Models

- **TL;DR**: 该论文证明了持久链能量基模型的近似最大似然估计偏差等于过阻尼朗之万动力系统的热力学超额功，并提出了最小耗散学习方法，通过控制学习率在有限时间内以最小能量耗散训练模型。

We show that the bias of the approximate maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE)
objective of a persistent chain energy-based model (EBM) is precisely equal to
the thermodynamic excess work of an overdamped Langevin dynamical system. We
then answer the question of whether such a model can be trained with minimal
excess work, that is, energy dissipation, in a finite amount of time. We find
that a Gaussian energy function with constant variance can be trained with
minimal excess work by controlling only the learning rate. This proves that it
is possible to train a persistent chain EBM in a finite amount of time with
minimal dissipation and also provides a lower bound on the energy required for
the computation. We refer to such a learning process that minimizes the excess
work as minimal-dissipation learning. We then provide a generalization of the
optimal learning rate schedule to general potentials and find that it induces a
natural gradient flow on the MLE objective, a well-known second-order
optimization method.

We report the fabrication and photovoltaic performance of a rotationally
faulted multilayer graphene (rf-MLG)/n-Si Schottky junction device. A
thickness-controlled rf-MLG is synthesized using a 5 {\mu}m Ni foil catalyst
via the chemical vapor deposition method and transferred to the n-Si substrate
via a polymer-free process, enabling facile and cost-effective fabrication. The
device demonstrates an ideality factor of 1.67, a rectification factor of
approximately 4x10^5 at {\pm}1.0 V, and a Schottky barrier height of 0.83 eV. A
strong linear relationship between light intensity and photocurrent is also
observed. Furthermore, the device exhibits a peak external quantum efficiency
of ~26% at 540 nm and a peak internal quantum efficiency of ~97% at 410 nm.
Transient photocurrent and photovoltaic measurements show approximately
one-microsecond extraction and several-millisecond recombination times,
respectively, revealing effective charge collection for photovoltaic
applications. These results indicate that the rf-MLG/n-Si Schottky junction is
well-formed and achieves performance comparable to that of SLG devices,
demonstrating its potential for optoelectronic applications.

### Slow dynamics from a nested hierarchy of frozen states

We identify the mechanism of slow heterogeneous relaxation in quantum
kinetically constrained models (KCMs) in which the potential energy strength is
controlled by a coupling parameter. The regime of slow relaxation includes the
large-coupling limit. By expanding around that limit, we reveal a \emph{nested
hierarchy} of states that remain frozen on time scales determined by powers of
the coupling. The classification of such states, together with the evolution of
their Krylov complexity, reveal that these time scales are related to the
distance between the sites where facilitated dynamics is allowed by the kinetic
constraint. While correlations within frozen states relax slowly and exhibit
metastable plateaus that persist on time scales set by powers of the coupling
parameter, the correlations in the rest of the states decay rapidly. We compute
the plateau heights of correlations across all frozen states up to second-order
corrections in the inverse coupling. Our results explain slow relaxation in
quantum KCMs and elucidate dynamical heterogeneity by relating the relaxation
times to the spatial separations between the active regions.

Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) offer a novel AI-driven framework
for integrating physical laws directly into neural network models, facilitating
the solution of complex multiphysics problems in materials engineering. This
study systematically explores the application of PINNs to simulate oxide film
layer growth in halide-free solutions using the point defect model (PDM). We
identify and analyze four key failure modes in this context: imbalanced loss
components across different physical processes, numerical instabilities due to
variable scale disparities, challenges in enforcing boundary conditions within
multiphysics systems, and convergence to mathematically valid but physically
meaningless solutions. To overcome these challenges, we implement and validate
established techniques including nondimensionalization for training
stabilization, Neural Tangent Kernel-based adaptive loss balancing, and robust
enforcement of boundary conditions. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness
of these strategies in enhancing the reliability and physical fidelity of PINN
simulations in electrochemical physics, highlighting the novelty and practical
impact of our approach.

Understanding the evolution of the physicochemical bulk properties during the
Li deintercalation (charging) process is critical for optimizing battery
cathode materials. In this study, we combine X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS), density functional theory plus dynamical mean-field theory (DFT+DMFT)
calculations, and charge transfer multiplet (CTM) model simulations to
investigate how hybridization between transition metal (TM) 3d and oxygen 2p
orbitals evolves with Li deintercalation. Based on the presented approach
combining theoretical calculations and experimental studies of pristine and
deintercalated cathodes, two important problems of ion batteries can be
addressed: i) the detailed electronic structure and involved changes with
deintercalation providing information of the charge compensation mechanism, and
ii) the precise experimental analysis of XPS data which are dominated by charge
transfer coupled to final-state effects affecting the satellite structure. As
main result for the investigated Li TM oxides, it can be concluded that the
electron transfer coupled to the Li$^{+}$-ion migration does not follow a rigid
band model but is modified due to changes in TM 3d and O 2p states
hybridization. Furthermore, this integrated approach identifies the 2p XPS
satellite peak intensity of TM as an effective indicator of the redox
chemistry. With that the redox chemistry of cathodes can be deduced, thus
offering a foundation for designing more efficient battery materials.

The search for photocathode materials with low mean transverse energies
(MTEs) and, hence, low intrinsic emittance is of crucial importance for various
fields of particle and solid state physics. Here, we demonstrate that
polycrystalline multialkali Na$_{2}$KSb(Cs,Sb) photocathodes with negative
effective electron affinity (NEA) have MTE values at room temperature by a
factor of 2 lower than those of monocrystalline \textit{p}-GaAs(Cs,O)
photocathodes. These low MTE values are due to the electron refraction on the
jump in mass, between a small effective mass in Na$_{2}$KSb and free electron
mass in vacuum. It is proved that, at the NEA state, up to half of
photoelectrons are emitted in a narrow-angle cone with the fractional MTE of
9\,meV at room temperature. We also showed that the transition from NEA to
positive effective affinity results in the subthermal total MTE of the
Na$_{2}$KSb(Cs,Sb) photocathode, along with quantum efficiency of about
10$^{-2}$. The physical reasons for the manifestation of the refraction effect
in multialkali photocathodes are discussed, opening up opportunities for the
development of high-brightness and ultracold robust electron sources.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究通过第一性原理计算揭示了天然光学活性与结构手性之间的复杂关系，发现光学旋转方向由结构中极化性最强的原子的原子尺度螺旋性决定，而非空间群符号给出的名义螺旋轴手性。

Natural optical activity (NOA), the ability of a material to rotate the plane
of polarized light, has traditionally been associated with structural
chirality. However, this relationship has often been oversimplified, leading to
conceptual misunderstandings, particularly when attempts are made to directly
correlate structural handedness with optical rotatory power. In reality, the
relationship between chirality and NOA is more nuanced: optical activity can
arise in both chiral and achiral crystal structures, and the sign of the
rotation cannot necessarily be inferred from the handedness of the space group.
% In this work, we conduct a first-principles investigation of natural optical
activity in SiO$_2$ and AlPO$_4$ crystals, focusing on their enantiomorphic
structural phase transition from high-symmetry hexagonal ($P6_422$ or $P6_222$)
to low-symmetry trigonal ($P3_121$ or $P3_221$) space groups. This transition,
driven by the condensation of a zone-center $\Gamma_3$ phonon mode, reverses
the screw axis type given by the space group symbol while leaving the sign of
the optical activity unchanged. By following the evolution of the structure and
the optical response along the transition pathway, we clarify the microscopic
origin of this behavior. We demonstrate that the sense of optical rotation is
determined not by the nominal helicity of the screw axis given in the space
group symbol, but by the atomic-scale helicity of the most polarizable atoms of
the structure.

Exploring the electron tunneling mechanisms in diverse materials systems
constitutes a versatile strategy for tailoring the properties of optoelectronic
devices. In this domain, bipolar vertical tunneling junctions composed of van
der Waals materials with vastly different electronic band structures enable
simultaneous injection of electrons and holes into an optically active
material, providing a universal blueprint for light-emitting diodes (LEDs).
Efficient modulation of the injection efficiency has previously been
demonstrated by creating resonant states within the energy barrier formed by
the luminescent material. Here, we present an alternative approach towards
resonant tunneling conditions by fabricating tunneling junctions composed
entirely from gapped materials: Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ as electrodes, hBN as a
tunneling barrier, and monolayer WSe$_2$ as a luminescent medium. The
characterization of such LEDs revealed a nonmonotonous evolution of the
electroluminescence intensity with the tunneling bias. The dominant role
driving the characteristics of the electron tunneling was associated with the
relative alignment of the density of states in Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ electrodes.
The unique device architecture introduced here presents a universal pathway
towards LEDs operating at room temperature with electrically modulated emission
intensity.

- **TL;DR**: 通过堆叠顺序工程在极性六方堆叠CrI3中创建滑动多铁性材料，实现了室温滑动铁电性和界面铁磁性之间的强耦合，可用0.4V低电压进行非易失性磁开关。

Developing new multiferroics at the two-dimensional (2D) limit with
energy-efficient magnetoelectric coupling can inform the interplay physics of
novel orders and advance on-chip high-performance computing applications. Here
we apply stacking order engineering to create a new type of 2D multiferroics,
namely sliding multiferroics, based on polar hexagonal stacked (H-stacked)
CrI3. This new stacking order removes structural inversion symmetry and gives
rise to room temperature sliding ferroelectricity, as confirmed by Raman
spectroscopy, second harmonic generation spectroscopy and electrical transport
measurements. Building upon the gate-dependent reflective magnetic circular
dichroism, first-principles calculations, and modeling, sliding
ferroelectricity is shown to interplay with an emergent interfacial
ferromagnetism via interlayer spin-polarized charge transfer. This coupling
mechanism results in non-volatile magnetic switching by as low as 0.4V across
the H-stacked CrI3. Our demonstration introduces polar stacking order
engineering of 2D magnets as a general approach to create non-volatile 2D
multiferroics with efficient magnetoelectric coupling, paving the way for
low-power electronics and spintronics at the atomically thin limit.

Studies of excitonic transport in transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers
have attracted increasing interest in recent years in order to develop
nano-optoelectronic devices made with 2D materials. These studies began with
low to moderate optical excitation regimes, and more recently have focused on
high injection regimes where nonlinear effects appear. This article is focused
on the transport of biexcitons by spatially and temporally resolved
photoluminescence spectroscopy at high excitation flux. The study is carried
out on a high-quality WSe$_2$ monolayer encapsulated in hexagonal boron
nitride. The results show that a Seebeck current affects transport in
connection with the presence of hot biexcitons. In particular, we observe the
formation of spatial rings, also called halos, which have been observed in
other excitonic gases. These results tend to generalize the importance of
high-energy populations in excitonic transport in TMD, even for complex and
heavy excitonic particles.
