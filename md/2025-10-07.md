- **TL;DR**: 该研究通过分析Cd3As2狄拉克半金属纳米带约瑟夫森结的Fraunhofer图案，发现虽然观察到拓扑超流的预测特征，但理论分析表明非对称超流分布也能产生类似行为，因此仅凭异常Fraunhofer图案不能可靠确认拓扑超导性。

Majorana zero modes (MZMs) in topological superconductors are promising for
quantum computing, yet their unambiguous detection remains challenging. We
fabricated Josephson junctions (JJs) using Cd$_3$As$_2$ Dirac semimetal
nanoribbons with NbTi superconducting electrodes to investigate topological
supercurrents through Fraunhofer pattern analysis. The JJs exhibited excellent
quality with high transparency ($\tau$ = 0.77) and large induced
superconducting gap ($\Delta$ = 1.10 meV), confirmed by multiple Andreev
reflection features. While node lifting at the third minimum of the Fraunhofer
pattern was observed as a predicted signature of 4{$\pi$}-periodic topological
supercurrents, our theoretical analysis demonstrates that asymmetric
supercurrent distributions can reproduce this behavior without invoking MZMs.
These findings reveal that anomalous Fraunhofer patterns alone cannot reliably
confirm topological superconductivity, necessitating complementary experimental
approaches for conclusive Majorana detection

### Variation Monte Carlo Study on the bilayer $t-J_{\parallel}-J_{\perp}$ model for La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$

- **TL;DR**: 通过变分蒙特卡洛模拟研究La3Ni2O7双层镍酸盐的高温超导机制，发现主导的层间s波配对，并揭示Gutzwiller投影在提高Tc中的重要作用。

The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity (HTSC) in
La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has aroused significant interest in exploring the pairing
mechanism. Previous studies have proposed an effective d$_{x^2-y^2}$-orbital
bilayer $t-J_{\parallel}-J_{\perp}$ model, in which the electrons of the
d$_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital are charge carriers, which are subject to the intralayer
antiferromagnetic (AFM) superexchange $J_{\parallel}$ and the large interlayer
AFM superexchange $J_{\perp}\approx 2J_{\parallel}$, with the latter
transferred from the nearly half-filled and hence localized $d_{z^2}$ orbital
through the strong Hund's rule coupling. Here we study this model by the
variational Monte Carlo (VMC) simulation and find a dominant interlayer s-wave
pairing, in which the SC order parameters have a drastic improvement compared
with those of the mean field (MF) type of theories. In real materials, the
Hund's coupling is finite, leading to reduced $J_{\perp}$, dictating that the
MF-type theories have difficulty explaining the HTSC. However, our VMC
calculations find that even for effective $J_{\perp}$ as weak as
$J_{\perp}=J_{\parallel}$, the interlayer pairing is still considerably large
and can be compared with the $T_c$ observed in experiments, which is very weak
in MF-type theories. This result indicates the important role of the Gutzwiller
projection in improving the $T_c$, which is ignored in the MF-type theories. In
addition, our results show that suppressed interlayer hopping can promote
interlayer pairing, which is consistent with the fact that the interlayer
hopping of the d$_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is very weak. Our
research offers a new perspective for understanding the pairing mechanism of
bilayer nickelates and provides a reference for recent ultra-cold atom
experiments in mixed-dimensional systems.

### Systematic evolution of superconducting pairing strength and Seebeck coefficients in correlated infinite-layer La$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_2$

- **TL;DR**: 无限层镍酸盐(La,Sr)NiO₂表现出强耦合超导性，能抵抗超过47T的面内磁场，远超传统BCS超导体的泡利极限。该材料在欠掺杂区域显示出正塞贝克系数，表明存在非平凡的电子关联。

The recently discovered superconducting infinite-layer nickelates offer a
novel platform to explore an exotic pairing mechanism in multi-band systems
towards high-temperature superconductivity and associated rich quantum phases,
contrasting with cuprates. Here, we show that infinite-layer (La,Sr)NiO$_2$
exhibits strong-coupling superconductivity, resilient to in-plane magnetic
fields exceeding 47 T at optimal doping - more than twice the Pauli limit for
conventional BCS superconductors. This violation becomes pronounced towards the
underdoped regime, implying an intriguing evolution of pairing glue. The
unexpected observation of positive Seebeck coefficients in this regime
indicates the presence of nontrivial electron correlations. Furthermore, our
comprehensive investigation across the superconducting dome reveals that the
evolution of (thermo)electric normal-state properties - specifically, the sign
changes of the Hall and Seebeck coefficients - coincide with the evolution of
superconducting anisotropy and pairing strength. This demonstrates a definitive
link between electron correlations and strong-coupling superconductivity in
(La,Sr)NiO$_2$, contributing to a unified framework for understanding
unconventional superconductivity.

### Anyon interactions in the Chern--Simons--Landau--Ginzburg model of the fractional quantum Hall effect

- **TL;DR**: 该论文研究了Chern-Simons扩展的Ginzburg-Landau模型中任意子准粒子的相互作用，发现其实现了I/II型超导的混合特性，打破了传统的超导类型二分法。

The interactions of anyonic quasi-particles (vortices) in the Chern--Simons
extension of the Ginzburg--Landau model is investigated and we show that it
manifestly realizes a hybridization of type I/II superconductivity. Through
Gauss' law, each vortex simultaneously carries a flux quantum and a
proportional Noether charge, thereby realizing an anyonic excitation. The
Chern--Simons coupling also modifies the screening structure of the gauge
fields, producing complex-conjugate masses that yield a common penetration
depth with an oscillatory phase. This altered asymptotic behavior breaks the
conventional type-I/type-II dichotomy of the Ginzburg--Landau model. As a
result, vortex anyons experience short-range repulsion and long-range
attraction, enabling the formation of separated multi-vortex bound states with
non-monotonic interaction energy.

### Comprehensive \textsl{Ab Initio}~Calculations of \ce{CO2-H2} and \ce{CO2-He} Collisional Properties

We present comprehensive \textsl{ab initio} calculations of CO$_{\rm
2}$-H$_{\rm 2}$ and CO$_{\rm 2}$-He collisional properties from first
principles, employing CCSD(T), potential calculations together with
close-coupling dynamical scattering in the \YUMI~framework. We derive
(in)elastic cross sections, rate coefficients, and pressure-broadening
parameters -- incl., their rotational dependence up to $|m|=50$, and
temperature dependence over the range of 100-800 K. We provide Pad\'e fits for
the broadening coefficients as a function of rotational quantum number,
enabling extrapolation of the results and integration into spectroscopic
databases, including HITRAN and HITEMP. The computed potentials for both
CO$_{\rm 2}$-H$_{\rm 2}$ and CO$_{\rm 2}$-He have a sub-percent precision, and
the dynamics-solving code YUMI ultimately yields the collisional parameters.
Among these, the scaled pressure broadening experimental values meet the 10\%
precision requirement for exoplanetary sciences with \textit{JWST}. This
contrasts with the parameters available before the present calculations, which
at higher temperatures (T$&gt;$400 K) deviate as much as 5$\times$ from the
desired precision requirement. All derivations and collisional properties are
provided with this manuscript, establishing the first of such a comprehensive
ab initio foundation for collisional systems with a target molecule having more
than two atoms.

### Proper Theory of Magnon Orbital Angular Momentum

- **TL;DR**: 提出了中性玻色子（如磁振子）轨道角动量的正确理论，通过Aharonov-Casher效应和微扰理论识别自旋和拓扑贡献，在二维蜂窝晶格中展示了Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya相互作用诱导的大磁振子轨道角动量。

The orbital motion of chargeless bosons, unlike that of electrons, does not
generate a magnetic moment and thus cannot directly interact with magnetic
fields. Utilizing the Aharonov-Casher effect and perturbation theory, we
formulate a proper theory for the magnon orbital angular momentum (OAM) at
finite temperatures, explicitly identifying both self-rotation and topological
contributions, analogous to the electronic counterpart but with correct bosonic
statistics. Comparing with previous studies on magnon OAM, the magnon spin
Nernst effect can only be correctly reproduced using the proper theory for
magnon OAM. In a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice, we show that the
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction induces a large magnon OAM in both
ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic ground states. Our formulation provides a
foundation for studying orbital dynamics of chargeless bosons with intrinsic
spin.

### Uncertainty quantification of reacting fluids interacting with porous media using a hybrid physics-based and data-driven approach

- **TL;DR**: 结合物理建模和数据驱动降阶模型，通过算子推断方法量化烧蚀热防护系统中多物理场耦合过程的不确定性。

Accurately simulating coupled physical processes under uncertainty is
essential for reliable modeling and design in performance-critical applications
such as combustion systems. Ablative heat shield design, as a specific example
of this class, involves modeling multi-physics interactions between reacting
flows and a porous material. Repeatedly evaluating these models to quantify
parametric uncertainties would be prohibitively computationally expensive. In
this work, we combine physics-based modeling using a single-domain approach
with data-driven reduced-order modeling to quantify uncertainty via the
operator inference method. The detailed physics-based simulations reproduce the
measured surface temperature of an object exposed to high-enthalpy flow in a
plasma wind tunnel experiment within 5%. We further use the model to
demonstrate the effect of complex flow situations on the dynamic interactions
between the porous heat shield material and the surrounding gas. The parametric
reduced-order model, built on physics-based simulation data, successfully
captures variations in quantities of interest resulting from changes in the
permeability and heat transfer coefficient of the porous material in two
separate studies: solid fuel combustion and emission of buoyant reacting plumes
in quiescent air and ablation in a wind tunnel.

### Optimal Computation from Fluctuation Responses

- **TL;DR**: 开发了一个结合涨落响应关系和机器学习的统一框架，用于设计热力学最优的信息处理协议，在保证正确结果的同时最小化能量消耗。

The energy cost of computation has emerged as a central challenge at the
intersection of physics and computer science. Recent advances in statistical
physics -- particularly in stochastic thermodynamics -- enable precise
characterizations of work, heat, and entropy production in
information-processing systems driven far from equilibrium by time-dependent
control protocols. A key open question is then how to design protocols that
minimize thermodynamic cost while ensur- ing correct outcomes. To this end, we
develop a unified framework to identify optimal protocols using fluctuation
response relations (FRR) and machine learning. Unlike previous approaches that
optimize either distributions or protocols separately, our method unifies both
using FRR-derived gradients. Moreover, our method is based primarily on
iteratively learning from sampled noisy trajectories, which is generally much
easier than solving for the optimal protocol directly from a set of governing
equations. We apply the framework to canonical examples -- bit erasure in a
double-well potential and translating harmonic traps -- demonstrating how to
construct loss functions that trade-off energy cost against task error. The
framework extends trivially to underdamped systems, and we show this by
optimizing a bit-flip in an underdamped system. In all computations we test,
the framework achieves the theoretically optimal protocol or achieves work
costs comparable to relevant finite time bounds. In short, the results provide
principled strategies for designing thermodynamically efficient protocols in
physical information-processing systems. Applications range from quantum gates
robust under noise to energy-efficient control of chemical and synthetic
biological networks.

### Insulating transport in anisotropic metals: breakdown of Drude transport and the puzzling $c$-axis resistivity of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ and other layered oxides

- **TL;DR**: 本文揭示了一种解释层状金属中非金属性c轴电阻率的机制，发现了除标准金属项外的非德鲁德贡献项，并在Sr2RuO4中验证了该理论。

We reveal a mechanism that may explain the non-metallic out-of-plane
resistivity in layered metals. By carefully examining how the Drude-Boltzmann
expression for the $c$-axis conductivity emerges out of the Kubo formula, we
find, besides the standard metallic term proportional to the carrier lifetime
$\tau$, a non-Drude contribution proportional to $1/\tau$. The Drude behavior
breaks down when $1/\tau &gt; 2 \eta^*$, the crossover value $\eta^*$ being small
(and hence observable) when the $c$-axis velocities vary rapidly with the
distance from the Fermi surface. We consider the Hund metal Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ as a
test case, which we study within a realistic dynamical mean-field theory
approach. The non-Drude behavior observed experimentally in $c$-axis transport
is reproduced and explained by our considerations, showing that earlier invoked
extrinsic mechanisms that involve either impurities or phonons are unnecessary.
We point out that the small value of $\eta^*$ is due to a peculiar accidental
cancellation due to destructive interference characteristic of body-centered
tetragonal lattices.

### Bloch Oscillations and Landau-Zener Transitions in Flat-Band Lattices with Quadratic and Linear Band Touchings

- **TL;DR**: 本文研究了Lieb和Kagome晶格中由平带物理和带间耦合相互作用引起的非规则Bloch振荡，揭示了不同晶格结构对振荡频率和带间耦合的独特影响。

Bloch oscillations (BOs) describe the coherent oscillatory motion of
electrons in a periodic lattice under a constant external electric field.
Deviations from pure harmonic wave packet motion or irregular Bloch
oscillations can occur due to Zener tunneling (Landau-Zener Transitions or
LZTs), with oscillation frequencies closely tied to interband coupling
strengths. Motivated by the interplay between flat-band physics and interband
coupling in generating irregular BOs, here we investigate these oscillations in
Lieb and Kagome lattices using two complementary approaches: coherent transport
simulations and scattering matrix analysis. In the presence of unavoidable band
touchings, half-fundamental and fundamental BO frequencies are observed in Lieb
and Kagome lattices, respectively -- a behavior directly linked to their
distinct band structures. When avoided band touchings are introduced, distinct
BO frequency responses to coupling parameters in each lattice are observed.
Scattering matrix analysis reveals strong coupling and potential LZTs between
dispersive bands and the flat band in Kagome lattices, with the quadratic band
touching enhancing interband interactions and resulting in BO dynamics that is
distinct from systems with linear crossings. In contrast, the Lieb lattice -- a
three level system -- shows independent coupling between the flat band and two
dispersive bands, without direct LZTs occurring between the two dispersive
bands themselves. Finally, to obtain a unifying perspective on these results,
we examine BOs during a strain-induced transition from Kagome to Lieb lattices,
and link the evolution of irregular BO frequencies to changes in band
connectivity and interband coupling.

Topological protection is an attractive signature in both fundamental and
applied researches because it provides an exotic and robust state.
Multi-terminal Josephson junctions have recently been studied extensively owing
to the emergence of topologically protected Weyl points without the need for
topological materials. In this study, we examine the dynamic properties of Weyl
points in multi-terminal Josephson junctions. The junctions are modulated by
external parameters, such as electric gate voltage, magnetic flux, bias
voltage. The Weyl points are manipulated and draw trajectories accompanied by
pair creation and annihilation. The trajectories form both closed loops and
open lines. We classify these trajectories using the Chern number and the phase
diagram.

### Tritium Separation from Gaseous 1,2,3H Isotopologue Mixtures by Selective Adsorption on Ag-Exchanged Zeolite Type Y

- **TL;DR**: 使用Ag(I)交换的Y型沸石在液氮温度下实现了氢同位素的高效分离，首次报道了三元同位素混合物的分离实验，氚富集度达到70%。

Efficient separation of hydrogen isotopologues is crucial for applications
such as the recycling of exhaust streams in nuclear fusion reactors. Using
thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS), we report, for the first time, on
separation experiments of a ternary 1,2,3H isotope mixture, achieving tritium
enrichment of 70% from an initially equimolar (1:1:1) gas mixture, based on
selective adsorption using an Ag(I)-exchanged zeolite type Y. Further
experiments on binary hydrogen isotope mixtures validated numerical predictions
of the separation efficiency for T2. Specifically, the high selectivity for
tritium over protium of 38.2 makes the Ag(I)-exchanged zeolite an excellent
candidate for energy-efficient isotope separation at liquid-nitrogen
temperature.

### Electron-beam-induced Contactless Manipulation of Interlayer Twist in van der Waals Heterostructures

- **TL;DR**: 本文展示了一种基于电子束诱导电荷注入的非接触式静电驱动方法，用于控制二维范德华异质结构中层的相对取向。

The ability to dynamically control the relative orientation of layers in two
dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures represents a critical
step toward the realization of reconfigurable nanoscale devices. Existing
actuation methods often rely on mechanical contact, complex architectures, or
extreme operating conditions, which limit their applicability and scalability.
In this work, we present a proof-of-concept demonstration of contactless
electrostatic actuation based on electron-beam-induced charge injection. By
locally charging an insulating hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) flake on an
electrically grounded graphene layer, we create an interfacial electric field
that generates in-plane electrostatic torque and induces angular displacement.
We validate the induced rotation through in-situ scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) and twist-dependent Raman spectroscopy.

### Structure-Preserving MHD-Driftkinetic Discretization for Wave-Particle Interactions

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种混合磁流体动力学-漂移动理学系统的结构保持离散化方法，用于模拟低频波粒相互作用，通过变分原理保证能量一致性耦合。

We present a structure-preserving discretization of the hybrid
magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)-driftkinetic system for simulations of low-frequency
wave-particle interactions. The model equations are derived from a variational
principle, assuring energetically consistent couplings between MHD fluids and
driftkinetic particles. The spatial discretization is based on a
finite-element-exterior-calculus (FEEC) framework for the MHD and a
particle-in-cell (PIC) method for the driftkinetic. A key feature of the scheme
is the inclusion of the non-quadratic particle magnetic moment energy term in
the Hamiltonian, which is introduced by the guiding-center approximation. The
resulting discrete Hamiltonian structure naturally organizes the dynamics into
skew-symmetric subsystems, enabling balanced energy exchange. To handle the
non-quadratic energy term, we develop energy-preserving time integrators based
on discrete gradient methods. The algorithm is implemented in the open-source
Python package \texttt{STRUPHY}. Numerical experiments confirm the
energy-conserving property of the scheme and demonstrate the capability to
simulate energetic particles (EP) induced excitation of toroidal Alfv\'en
eigenmodes (TAE) without artificial dissipation or mode filtering. This
capability highlights the potential of structure-preserving schemes for
high-fidelity simulations of hybrid systems.

### Dynamics of the Kac Ring Model with switching scatterers

- **TL;DR**: 提出了Kac环模型的广义版本，包含黑白两种粒子，其中黑粒子通过改变环境来诱导粒子间的间接长程相互作用，系统会收敛到时间周期性状态。

We introduce a generalized version of the Kac ring model in which particles
are of two types, black and white. Black particles modify the environment
through which all particles move, thereby inducing indirect and potentially
long-range interactions among them. Unlike the inert scatterers of Kac's
original model, the scatterers in our setting possess internal states that
change upon interaction with black particles and can be interpreted as energy
levels of the environment. This makes the model self-consistent, as it
incorporates a form of particle interactions, mediated by the environment, that
drives the system toward some kind of stationary state. Although indirect and
long-range interactions do not necessarily promote thermodynamic states,
interactions are necessary for energy to be shared among the elementary
constituents of matter, enabling the establishment of equipartition, which is a
prerequisite for defining temperature. Therefore, our model is one step forward
in this direction, elucidating the role of interactions and energy exchange. We
prove that any initial state of the system converges to a time periodic state
(i.e. a phase space orbit) and describe basins of attraction for some of such
asymptotic periodic states.

### Lattice Translation Modulated Symmetries and TFTs

Modulated symmetries are internal symmetries that are not invariant under
spacetime symmetry actions. We propose a general way to describe the lattice
translation modulated symmetries in 1+1D, including the non-invertible ones,
via the tensor network language. We demonstrate that the modulations can be
described by some autoequivalences of the categories. Although the topological
behaviors are broken because of the presence of modulations, we can still
construct the modulated version of the symmetry TFT bulks by inserting a series
of domain walls described by invertible bimodule categories. This structure not
only recovers some known results on invertible modulated symmetries but also
provides a general framework to tackle modulated symmetries in a more general
setting.

### Strain Effects on Electronic Properties of Cobalt-Based Coordination Nanosheets

We theoretically study the strain effects on the electronic properties of
  cobalt-based benzenehexathiol (CoBHT) coordination nanosheets using
  first-principles calculations. Two distinct crystal structures,
  high-density structure (HDS) and low-density structure (LDS), are
  explored. Our results reveal that HDS behaves as a metal, while LDS
  exhibits semiconducting. Spin-polarized electronic band structures highlight
the presence of energy band structures of Kagome lattice, and
  the inclusion of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) results in band gap openings
  at high-symmetric K points. Furthermore, we construct the tight-binding
  model to investigate the topological properties of CoBHT,
  demonstrating anomalous Hall conductivity driven by the intrinsic
  Berry curvature. The impact of uniaxial
  strain on the electronic and magnetic properties of CoBHT is also studied.
Strain
  induces significant modifications in magnetic moments and density
  of states, particularly in the HDS. Anomalous Hall conductivity is
  enhanced under hole-doping conditions, suggesting that strain can be

- **TL;DR**: 在部分填充的朗道能级中，通过引入电子间的排斥相互作用，可以在一定参数范围内诱导出拓扑超导性，这为通过将复合费米液体与普通s波超导体邻近耦合来实现拓扑超导性提供了新思路。

A two-dimensional topologically nontrivial state of noninteracting electrons,
such as the surface state of a three-dimensional topological insulator, is
predicted to realize a topological superconductor when proximity-coupled to an
ordinary $s$-wave superconductor. In contrast, noninteracting electrons
partially occupying a Landau level, with Rashba spin-orbit coupling that lifts
the spin degeneracy, fail to develop topological superconductivity under
similar proximity coupling in the presence of the conventional Abrikosov vortex
lattice. We demonstrate through exact diagonalization that, at half-filled
Landau level, introducing a repulsive interaction between electrons induces
topological superconductivity for a range of parameters. This appears rather
surprising because a repulsive interaction is expected to inhibit, not promote,
pairing, but suggests an appealing principle for realizing topological
superconductivity: proximity-coupling a composite Fermi liquid to an ordinary
$s$-wave superconductor.

- **TL;DR**: 研究评估了再生混凝土骨料(RCA)浸出液的pH值、碱度和钙离子浓度随时间的变化，发现初始接触时pH值高(&gt;10)，随后因与二氧化碳反应而降低，钙离子浓度先快速增加后趋于饱和，碱度在初始剧增后稳定在50-65 mg CaCO3/L。

Recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) is recognized as a readily available,
mechanically sufficient construction and demolition waste product that is
suitable as a base course substitute for natural, virgin aggregate in pavement
construction. Environmentally responsible applications of RCA must consider the
high alkalinity, high pH leachate, and heavy metal leaching risks reported in
the literature. The existing body of literature does not address discrepancies
between field and laboratory measurements of RCA leachate pH, nor are there any
existing studies of aged RCA leachate composition as a function of time. To
consider the influence of contact time on RCA leachate, the present study
evaluates recovered RCA base course samples from the Minnesota Road Research
highway construction study site using modified batch test methodology. Leachate
pH, alkalinity, and calcium ion (Ca2+) concentration were monitored for 24
hours to understand RCA leachate chemistry during the initial contact period.
Leachate pH is high upon initial contact with water (pH &gt; 10) and decreases
over time as it reacts with atmospheric carbon dioxide. Calcium ion
concentration increases rapidly in the initial contact period, then more
gradually as calcium saturation is reached. Alkalinity stabilizes (50-65 mg
CaCO3/L) after a dramatic increase during the initial contact period.

### Spin-orbit coupling and the Edelstein effect at conducting ferroelectric domain walls

- **TL;DR**: 该论文研究了铁电材料中头对头畴壁的二维电子气特性，发现其具有伊辛自旋织构和可测量的Edelstein效应。

Head-to-head ferroelectric domain walls are intrinsically charged, and are
typically compensated by a mix of oppositely charged defects and free
electrons. The free electrons form a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) along
the domain wall. In many cases, inversion symmetry is broken at the wall, which
implies that the 2DEG is subject to nontrivial spin-orbit coupling. Here, we
use symmetry arguments to construct a generic six-band tight-binding electronic
Hamiltonian for a $90^\circ$ head-to-head ferroelectric domain wall. The model,
which includes spin-orbit physics and has a multi-orbital $t_{2g}$ band
structure that is common to transition-metal perovskites, is applied to
BaTiO$_3$. We find that the 2DEG develops an Ising spin texture, with spins
aligned perpendicular to the domain wall. We contrast this with the Rashba spin
texture that should emerge at weakly conducting $90^\circ$ head-to-tail domain
walls. We then show that the head-to-head domain walls should have a measurable
Edelstein effect (that is, a current-induced magnetization), even in the dilute
limit and at room temperature, and describe a simple experiment to measure it.

From the onset of fundamental statistical mechanical constructs formulated in
the late 19th century, alchemical free-energy methods slowly emerged and
transitioned to become operational tools of biomolecular simulation applicable
to a wide range of problems including protein-ligand binding for drug discovery
research. This article reconstructs how statistical mechanical approaches such
as thermodynamic integration and free-energy perturbation were reconfigured in
the early 1980's to address the complexities of increasingly heterogeneous
biomolecular systems. Drawing on oral history interviews and primary
literature, the study examines the technical, institutional, theoretical, and
infrastructural conditions under which these methods were implemented, and
became progressively operational. These conditions encompassed the
consolidation of lab-specific software infrastructures, the formulation of
practical simulation protocols, as well as essential statistical mechanical
clarifications. From this perspective, the progress of free-energy methods
proceeded less from a unified convergence than from an iterative
troubleshooting process of alignment involving practical and theoretical
considerations. The aim of the present article is to offer a historically
grounded account of how free-energy techniques acquired practical and
functional reliability.

### Strong coupling phases of conserved growth models are crumpled

- **TL;DR**: 随机驱动的非平衡守恒生长模型在强非局域化学势下存在强耦合相，表现出粗糙化相变，弱耦合相满足动态指数z和粗糙度指数χ的精确关系，强耦合相在临界维度以下是不稳定的皱褶相。

We show that stochastically driven nonequilibrium conserved growth models
admit strong coupling phases for sufficiently strong nonlocal chemical
potentials underlying the dynamics. The models exhibit generic roughening
transitions between perturbatively accessible weak coupling phases satisfying
an exact relation between the dynamic $z$ and roughness $\chi$ exponents in all
dimensions $d$ and strong coupling phases. In dimensions below the critical
dimension, the latter phases are unstable and argued to be crumpled, and thus
distinct from the well-known strong coupling rough phase of the
Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation in dimensions $d\geq 2$. At the critical
dimension, conventional spatio-temporal scaling in the weak coupling phase is
logarithmically modulated and are exactly obtained. These results obtained by
employing a combination of nonperturbative arguments and perturbative theories,
corroborated by numerical results.

### Higher-form entanglement asymmetry and topological order

We extend a recently defined measure of symmetry breaking, the entanglement
asymmetry, to higher-form symmetries. In particular, we focus on Abelian
topological order in two dimensions, which spontaneously breaks a 1-form
symmetry. Using the toric code as a primary example, we compute the
entanglement asymmetry and compare it to the topological entanglement entropy.
We find that while the two quantities are not strictly equivalent, both are
sub-leading corrections to the area law and can serve as order parameters for
the topological phase. We generalize our results to non-chiral Abelian
topological order and express the maximal entanglement asymmetry in terms of
the quantum dimension. Finally, we discuss how the scaling of entanglement
asymmetry correctly detects topological order in the deformed toric code, where
1-form symmetry breaking persists even in a trivial phase.

The focused ion beam (FIB) microscope is well established as a
high-resolution machining instrument capable of site-selectively removing
material down to the nanoscale. Beyond subtractive processing, however, the FIB
can also add material using a technique known as focused ion beam induced
deposition (FIBID), enabling the direct-write of complex nanostructures. This
work explores new directions in three-dimensional nanoprinting with FIBID,
harnessing unique features of helium and neon FIBs to fabricate nanoscale
heterostructures, including multimaterial architectures and deposits with
engineered internal voids. Detailed insight into the chemical and structural
composition of these nanostructures is obtained using advanced electron
microscopy, revealing buried interfaces and material transformations. Building
on these results, the evolution of FIBID into a versatile platform for
functional nanomaterials design is discussed, opening pathways toward
next-generation nanoscale devices and technologies.

The interplay of charge and spin orders lies at the heart of correlated
electron physics and plays a critical role in the emergence of unconventional
quantum phases. Kagome magnets provide a particularly promising platform to
investigate these phenomena, owing to their geometrically frustrated lattice
structure. However, resolving spin and charge orders microscopically and
establishing ways to control them remain fundamental challenges. Here, we
demonstrate magnetic field control of an altermagnetic spin density wave order
intertwined with charge density wave order in kagome magnet CsCr3Sb5. Scanning
tunneling microscopy down to deep cryogenic temperature of 50 mK reveals two
previously unreported charge density wave orders in the Sb surface. Density
functional theory confirms that one of them is coupled to a spin density wave
with an altermagnetic ground state. The charge density waves can be tuned in
both amplitude and phase by an external magnetic field, reflected in domain
switching and stripe sliding of the charge density wave. Our findings deepen
the understanding of symmetry-breaking in kagome systems, providing a tunable
platform to explore the interplay of electronic correlation with emergent
quantum magnetism.

Pairing the accuracy of Kohn-Sham density-functional framework with the
efficiency of a stochastic algorithmic approach, mixed stochastic-deterministic
Density Functional Theory (mDFT) achieves a favorable computational scaling
with system sizes and electronic temperatures. We employ the recently developed
mDFT formalism to investigate the dynamic charge-transport properties of
systems in the warm dense matter regime. The optical conductivity spectra are
computed for single- and multi- component mixtures of carbon, hydrogen, and
beryllium using two complementary approaches: Kubo-Greenwood in the mDFT
picture and real-time Time-Dependent mDFT. We further devise a decomposition of
the Onsager coefficients leading up to the Kubo-Greenwood spectra to exhibit
contributions from the deterministic, stochastic, and mixed electronic state
transitions at different incident photon energies.

### High-spin magnetic ground states of neutral dopant clusters in semiconductors

High-spin states hold significant promise for classical and quantum
information storage and emerging magnetic memory technologies. Here, we present
a systematic framework for engineering such high-spin magnetic states in dopant
clusters formed from substitutional impurities in semiconductors. In
single-valley materials such as gallium arsenide, impurity states are
hydrogenic and exchange interactions generally favor low-spin configurations,
except in special geometries. In contrast, multivalley semiconductors exhibit
oscillatory form factors in their exchange couplings, enabling the controlled
suppression of selected hopping processes and exchange couplings. Exploiting
this feature, we demonstrate how carefully arranged impurities in aluminum
arsenide, germanium, and silicon can stabilize ground states with a net spin
that scale extensively with system size. Within effective mass theory and the
tight-binding approximation for hopping, we construct explicit examples ranging
from finite clusters to extended lattices and fractal-like tilings. In two
dimensions, we identify several favorable dopant geometries supporting a net
spin equal to around half of the fully polarized value in the thermodynamic
limit, including one which achieves over $70\%$ polarization. Our results
provide a general design principle for harnessing valley degeneracy in
semiconductors to construct robust high-spin states and outline a pathway for
their experimental realization via precision implantation of dopants.

### Interplay of order and disorder in two-dimensional critical systems with mixed boundary conditions

In spin systems such as the Ising model, the local order and disorder can be
characterized by the order-parameter and energy density profiles $\langle
\sigma ({\bf r}_1) \rangle$ and $\langle \epsilon ({\bf r}_2) \rangle$,
respectively. Does increasing the order at ${\bf r}_1$ always decrease the
disorder at ${\bf r}_2$? Does increasing the disorder at ${\bf r}_2$ always
decrease the order at ${\bf r}_1$? The answer to these questions is contained
in the cumulant response function $\langle\sigma ({\bf r}_1) \, \epsilon ({\bf
r}_2) \rangle^{(\rm cum)}$. This correlation function vanishes in the unbounded
bulk but not in systems with fixed-spin boundary conditions. Using the
universal operator-product expansion of $\sigma ({\bf r}_1) \, \epsilon ({\bf
r}_2)$ and exact results for the Ising model, we analyze $\langle\sigma ({\bf
r}_1) \, \epsilon ({\bf r}_2) \rangle^{(\rm cum)}$ in two-dimensional critical
systems defined on the $x-y$ plane with mixed $+$ and $-$ boundary conditions.
Particularly interesting behavior is found when either of the operators
$\sigma$ or $\epsilon$ is located on a ``zero line" in the $x-y$ plane, along
which $\langle\sigma ({\bf r})\rangle$ vanishes. Results for half-plane,
triangular, and rectangular geometries are presented.

### Ground state and excitations of quasiperiodic 1D narrow-band moiré systems: a mean field approach

We demonstrate that a mean field approximation can be confidently employed in
quasiperiodic moir\'e systems to treat interactions and quasiperiodicity on
equal footing. We obtain the mean field phase diagram for an illustrative
one-dimensional moir\'e system that exhibits narrow bands and a regime with
non-interacting multifractal critical states. By systematically comparing our
findings with existing exact results, we identify the regimes where the mean
field approximation provides an accurate description. Interestingly, in the
critical regime, we obtain a quasifractal charge density wave, consistent with
the exact results. To complement this study, we employ a real-space
implementation of the time-dependent Hartree-Fock, enabling the computation of
the excitation spectrum and response functions at the RPA level. These findings
indicate that a mean field approximation to treat systems hosting multifractal
critical states, as found in two-dimensional quasiperiodic moir\'e systems, is
an appropriate methodology.

We report the development of broadband solar absorber coatings based on
titanium suboxide composite thin films on aluminium substrates. The films are
fabricated via scalable DC magnetron sputtering using a Ti target, followed by
post-annealing in a fixed $O_2$ partial pressure of 0.45 mbar. By tuning
deposition time and annealing temperature, a composite phase of $Ti_2O_3$ and
$TiO_2$ was achieved. The Raman mapping of the films substantiates the
distribution and coexistence of the two phases. The optimized sample, deposited
for 10 min and annealed at 500 $^oC$, exhibited a superior solar absorptance
(${\alpha}_s$ = 0.913) and optimally low thermal emittance (${\epsilon}_t$ =
0.11). Nevertheless, the 15- and 20-min deposited films also showed a promising
absorptance (&gt;0.85) and emittance values (&lt;0.13). Morphological studies
revealed island-type nanostructures, leading to enhanced photothermal
performance via electric field confinement, which is validated by optical
simulations. This work provides a promising route toward efficient, scalable,
and cost-effective spectrally selective solar absorbers for solar thermal
applications.

### Active learning and explicit electrostatics enable accurate modeling of electrolytes

Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) offer near-ab initio accuracy
with the efficiency of classical force fields, making them attractive for
modeling electrolytes. Collecting a diverse training set is essential for their
accuracy and reliability, and explicit treatment of strong electrostatic
interactions may be necessary. In this work, we demonstrated that active
learning can automatically generate diverse training sets for moment tensor
potentials (MTPs), enabling reliable molecular dynamics simulations of pure
ethylene carbonate (EC), ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC), their mixtures, and
LiPF6 solutions. The resulting MTPs exhibit excellent transferability across
various EC/EMC compositions, producing ionic conductivities within 11% mean
deviations from experiments. In addition, we assessed the impact of explicitly
incorporating electrostatics by extending MTP with a charge redistribution
scheme. Our results show that this extended MTP achieves accuracy comparable to
MTP for EC/EMC mixtures with fewer parameters and reproduces ionic conductivity
with only a 6% mean deviation from experiment.

This paper presents a novel approach for generating and controlling spin
currents in an antiferromagnetic twisted honeycomb bilayer in response to an
elastic deformation. Utilizing a continuum model, closely based upon the
seminal Bistritzer-MacDonald model, that captures the essential physics of
low-energy moir\'e bands, we calculate the spin current response to the
deformation in terms of the familiar Berry phase formalism. The resulting
moir\'e superlattice potential modulates the electronic band structure, leading
to emergent topological phases and novel transport properties such as quantized
piezo responses both for spin and charge transport. This approach allows us to
tune the system across different topological regimes and to explore the
piezo-spintronic responses as a function of the band topology. When inversion
symmetry is broken either by a sublattice potential $V$, alignment with an hBN
substrate, uniaxial strain, or structural asymmetry present in the moir\'e
superlattice, the system acquires a finite Berry curvature that is opposite in
the $K$ and $K'$ valleys (protected by valley time reversal symmetry). In
contrast, for strain, the valley-contrasting nature of the pseudo-gauge field
ensures that the quantized response is robust and proportional to the sum of
the valley Chern numbers. These notable physical properties make these systems
promising candidates for groundbreaking spintronic and valleytronic devices.

The atomistic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation is challenged when modeling
spintronic devices where Joule heating is significant, due to its core
assumption of a constant magnetization magnitude. Based on a statistical
framework that treats the magnetization magnitude as a dynamic variable coupled
to a thermal bath, we derive a dynamic Landau-Lifshitz-Bloch-Slonczewski set of
equations for torques, that captures the transient, heating-induced
demagnetization that occurs during high-current operation. Integrating these
dynamic equations and comparing them to their stochastic equivalents reveals
that both the energy landscape and switching dynamics in high-anisotropy
systems are similarly modified. This approach yields accurate and accelerated
predictions of critical currents and switching times.

Distinguishing active from passive dynamics is a fundamental challenge in
understanding the motion of living cells and other active matter systems. Here,
we introduce a framework that combines physical modeling, analytical theory,
and machine learning to identify and characterize active fluctuations from
trajectory data. We train a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network on
synthetic trajectories generated from well-defined stochastic models of active
particles, enabling it to classify motion as passive or active and to infer the
underlying active process. Applied to experimental trajectories of a tracer in
the cytoplasm of a living cell, the method robustly identifies actively driven
motion and selects an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck active noise model as the best
description. Crucially, the classifier's performance on simulated data
approaches the theoretical optimum that we derive, and it also yields accurate
estimates of the active diffusion coefficient. This integrated approach opens a
powerful route to quantify non-equilibrium fluctuations in complex biological
systems from limited data.

### More bridging ligands activate direct exchange: the case of anisotropic Kitaev effective magnetic interactions

A magnet is a collection of magnetic moments. How those interact is
determined by what lies in between. In transition-metal and rare-earth magnetic
compounds, the configuration of the ligands around each magnetic center and the
connectivity of the ligand cages are therefore pivotal -- for example, the
mutual interaction of magnetic species connected through one single ligand is
qualitatively different from the case of two bridging anions. Two bridging
ligands are encountered in Kitaev magnets. The latter represent one of the
revelations of the 21st century in magnetism research: they feature highly
anisotropic intersite couplings with seemingly counterintuitive directional
dependence for adjacent pairs of magnetic sites and unique quantum spin-liquid
ground states that can be described analytically. Current scenarios for the
occurrence of pair-dependent magnetic interactions as proposed by Kitaev rely
on $indirect$ exchange mechanisms based on intersite electron hopping.
Analyzing the wavefunctions of Kitaev magnetic bonds at both single- and
multi-configuration levels, we find however that $direct$, Coulomb exchange may
be at least as important, in 5$d$ and 4$d$ $t_{2g}^5$, 3$d$ $t_{2g}^5e_g^2$,
and even rare-earth 4$f^1$ Kitaev-Heisenberg magnets. Our study provides
concept clarification in Kitaev magnetism research and the essential reference
points for reliable computational investigation of how novel magnetic ground
states can be engineered in Kitaev, Kitaev-Heisenberg, and Heisenberg
edge-sharing systems.

Crack arrest in ductile alloys plays a critical role in damage-tolerant
design for aerospace and structural applications, yet the transition from
microstructure-sensitive short cracks to load-controlled long cracks remains
poorly understood. Here, we present an in-situ, high-resolution experimental
study of crack propagation in cold-worked 5052 aluminium alloy using scanning
electron microscopy digital image correlation (SEM-DIC), electron backscatter
diffraction (EBSD), and novel data-driven crystal plasticity modelling that
uses the SEM-DIC and EBSD directly to calculate the stress. The local (elastic)
mode I and II stress intensity factors (SIFs) and the (elastic and
elastoplastic) energy release rate were extracted from the DIC-measured
displacement field and correlated with the crack interaction with
microstructural features. We find that the microstructure-sensitive crack grows
in a quasi-brittle manner at low energy release rate until reaching a critical
energy release rate, where the crack's process zone becomes large enough to
invoke plastic deformation that blunts the crack, marking a transition from
elastically driven microstructure-sensitive crack propagation to
plasticity-dominated crack arrest. Our findings establish that the
short-to-long crack transition is process-zone governed, rather than being
length-scale governed.

Proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) is foundational to catalysis,
bioenergetics, and energy conversion, yet capturing and disentangling the
coupled motions of electrons, protons, and solvent has remained a major
experimental challenge. We combine femtosecond optical spectroscopy,
site-specific ultrafast soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and time-resolved
X-ray scattering with advanced calculations to disentangle the elementary steps
of PCET in solution. Using a ruthenium polypyridyl model complex, we directly
resolve photoinduced electron redistribution, ligand-site protonation within
100 ps, and the accompanying solvent reorganization. This unified multi-modal
approach provides an orbital-level, atomistic picture of PCET, showing how
electronic, nuclear, and solvation degrees of freedom can be separated
experimentally. Our results establish a general X-ray framework for
understanding and ultimately controlling PCET in catalysis, artificial
photosynthesis, and biological energy flow.

- **TL;DR**: 本文展示了在SiMOS中通过离子注入将自旋-9/2的73Ge核与门定义量子点耦合，并实现了180kHz到350kHz的超精细相互作用可调谐。

Single nuclear spins in silicon are a promising resource for quantum
technologies due to their long coherence times and excellent control
fidelities. Qubits and qudits have been encoded on donor nuclei, with
successful demonstrations of Bell states and quantum memories on the spin-1/2
$^{31}$P and cat-qubits on the spin-7/2 $^{123}$Sb nuclei. Isoelectronic
nuclear spins coupled to gate-defined quantum dots, such as the naturally
occurring $^{29}$Si isotope, possess no additional charge and allow for the
coupled electron to be shuttled without destroying the nuclear spin coherence.
Here, we demonstrate the coupling and readout of a spin-9/2 $^{73}$Ge nuclear
spin to a gate-defined quantum dot in SiMOS. The $^{73}$Ge nucleus was
implanted by isotope-selective ion-implantation. We observe the hyperfine
interaction (HFI) to the coupled quantum dot electron and are able to tune it
from 180 kHz to 350 kHz, through the voltages applied to the lateral gate
electrodes. This work lays the foundation for future spin control experiments
on the spin-9/2 qudit as well as more advanced experiments such as entanglement
distribution between distant nuclear spins or repeated weak measurements.

The yield strength plateau of two BCC refractory high entropy alloys (RHEAs)
- MoNbTaVW and MoNbTaW was examined through hybrid Monte Carlo and molecular
dynamics (MC/MD) simulations. By analyzing atomic diffusivities derived from
vacancy formation and migration energies around the edge dislocation cores, the
number of critical atomic swaps were calculated at different temperatures.
Using hybrid MC/MD simulations of these critical swaps, we demonstrate that
above 1400K, the stress required to move the dislocations gets saturated,
indicating the effect of Dynamic Strain Ageing (DSA) via cross core motion.
Further simulations on random solid solutions (0 MC swaps) revealed a similar
plateau effect at the intermediate temperatures. This was attributed to the
additional athermal stress arising from lattice distortions due to solid
solution strengthening. Our findings suggest that the yield strength plateau
results from an interplay between the DSA-driven diffusion process and athermal
stress. Specifically, the plateau emerges from DSA mechanisms in the presence
of atomic diffusion, whereas in the absence of diffusion, it is governed by
athermal statistical lattice distortions. This dual mechanism framework
provides a comprehensive explanation for the experimentally observed Yield
strength behavior in RHEAs at intermediate temperatures.

### Directed percolation transition to active turbulence driven by non-reciprocal forces

We numerically study the collective dynamics of dense particle assemblies
driven by non-reciprocal pairwise forces of amplitude $\kappa$. At a critical
value $\kappa_{\rm c}$, the system undergoes a dynamical phase transition from
an absorbing state ($\kappa &lt; \kappa_{\rm c}$) to a chaotic steady state
($\kappa &gt; \kappa_{\rm c}$). The chaotic phase is marked by nontrivial
spatiotemporal velocity correlations and mixing, reminiscent of active
turbulence in self-propelled systems. The sharp onset of chaos shows critical
scaling consistent with the universality class of directed percolation. We
argue that this transition is generic to a broad class of locally-driven, dense
disordered materials.

### Novel family of near-room-temperature compensated itinerant pyrochlore ferrimagnets, $R{\mathrm{In}}{\mathrm{Co}}_{4}$ ($R=$ Dy-Tm)

We successfully synthesized single crystals of a series of C15b Laves phase
compounds, $R{\mathrm{In}}{\mathrm{Co}}_{4}$ ($R=$ Dy-Tm), with Co-pyrochlore
and $R$-fcc sublattices, and systematically studied their magnetic properties
via magnetometry measurements. These itinerant cubic compounds, with Curie
temperatures above room temperature, show compensated ferrimagnetism featuring
an antiferromagnetic coupling between the two sublattices. From this series,
${\mathrm{DyInCo}}_{4}$ exhibits the highest $T_{\rm C}$ (= 368 K) and a
near-room-temperature compensation point $T_{\rm cp}$ (= 295 K). $T_{\rm C}$
does not change drastically with the $R$ atom, whereas $T_{\rm cp}$ depends on
the de Gennes factor of $R^{3+}$. Another magnetization anomaly is observed in
all the compounds at low temperatures, which may be indicative of changes in
the lattice or magnetic structure. The easy axis the ferrimagnetic moment of
${\mathrm{DyInCo}}_{4}$, ${\mathrm{ErInCo}}_{4}$, and ${\mathrm{TmInCo}}_{4}$
is found at $T =$ 5 K to be along the [001], [111] and [110] directions,
respectively. However, the simple easy-axis or easy-plane ferrimagnetic picture
cannot be applied to ${\mathrm{HoInCo}}_{4}$. These observations suggest that
the $R$ sublattice determines magnetic anisotropy and compensation, while the
Co sublattice plays a role in strong magnetic ordering. The high Curie
temperature, together with the magnetization compensation point near room
temperature, renders these itinerant pyrochlore magnets interesting for
spintronic applications.

### Electro-optic effects in some sliding ferroelectrics

Sliding ferroelectrics, which exhibit out-of-plane polarization arising from
specific stacking rather than conventional ionic displacements, are new types
of ferroelectrics whose underdeveloped physics needs to be explored. Here, we
investigate for the first time the electro-optic (EO) response of these
materials using first-principles calculations, focusing on ZrI$_{2}$ as a
prototype. We reveal that, contrary to conventional ferroelectrics, the EO
effect in ZrI$_{2}$ is dominated by its electronic contribution rather than the
ionic one, which promises faster EO responses. Furthermore, both biaxial and
uniaxial strains significantly enhance this response, and a novel,
universal-like linear relationship between the band gap and such response is
discovered. We also report a large elasto-optic coefficient that is independent
of biaxial strain. Similar large linear EO coefficients and properties are
found in other sliding ferroelectrics, including different zirconium dihalides,
as well as BN and BP bilayers. These findings highlight sliding ferroelectrics
as highly promising candidates for ultrafast nonlinear optical devices and
reveal novel EO mechanisms.

### A Universal Deep Learning Force Field for Molecular Dynamic Simulation and Vibrational Spectra Prediction

- **TL;DR**: 开发了一种基于深度等变张量注意力网络(DetaNet)的机器学习分子动力学框架，用于快速准确预测红外和拉曼光谱，相比传统方法计算速度提升三个数量级。

Accurate and efficient simulation of infrared (IR) and Raman spectra is
essential for molecular identification and structural analysis. Traditional
quantum chemistry methods based on the harmonic approximation neglect
anharmonicity and nuclear quantum effects, while ab initio molecular dynamics
(AIMD) remains computationally expensive. Here, we integrate our deep
equivariant tensor attention network (DetaNet) with a velocity-Verlet
integrator to enable fast and accurate machine learning molecular dynamics
(MLMD) simulations for spectral prediction. Trained on the QMe14S dataset
containing energies, forces, dipole moments, and polarizabilities for 186,102
small organic molecules, DetaNet yields a universal and transferable force
field with high-order tensor prediction capability. Using time-correlation
functions derived from MLMD and ring-polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD)
trajectories, we computed IR and Raman spectra that accurately reproduce
anharmonic and nuclear quantum effects. Benchmark tests on isolated molecules,
including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, demonstrate that the DetaNet-based
MD approach achieves near-experimental spectral accuracy with speedups up to
three orders of magnitude over AIMD. Furthermore, the framework extends
seamlessly to molecular and inorganic crystals, molecular aggregates, and
biological macromolecules such as polypeptides with minimal fine-tuning. In all
systems, DetaNet maintains high accuracy while significantly reducing
computational cost. Overall, this work establishes a universal machine learning
force field and tensor-aware MLMD framework that enable fast, accurate, and
broadly applicable dynamic simulations and IR/Raman spectral predictions across
diverse molecular and material systems.

### Fractional quantum Hall state at $ν= 1/2$ with energy gap up to 6 K, and possible transition from one- to two-component state

- **TL;DR**: 在72.5纳米宽GaAs量子阱中，随着电子密度增加，ν=1/2分数量子霍尔态从单组分非阿贝尔Pfaffian态转变为双组分阿贝尔Ψ331态，伴随出现子态ν=8/17和7/13，最大能隙达6K。

The fractional quantum Hall state (FQHS) observed in the lowest Landau level
at filling factor $\nu=1/2$ in wide quantum wells has been enigmatic for
decades because the two-dimensional electron system (2DES) has a bilayer charge
distribution but with significant interlayer tunneling. Of particular interest
is whether the 1/2 FQHS in this system has a one-component (1C) or
two-component (2C) origin; these are typically identified as the Pfaffian
(non-Abelian) or the $\Psi_{331}$ (Abelian) FQHSs, respectively. We report here
our experimental study of the evolution of the correlated states of an
ultrahigh-quality 2DES confined to a 72.5-nm-wide GaAs quantum well. At the
lowest densities, the 2DES displays only odd-denominator FQHSs, and the ground
state at $\nu = 1/2$ is a composite fermion Fermi sea. As the density is
increased, a FQHS emerges at $\nu = 1/2$, and becomes very strong. In a finite
density range where the 1/2 FQHS is strongest, we also observe its daughter
FQHSs at $\nu = 8/17$ and 7/13, consistent with the theoretically expected
daughter states of a Pfaffian 1/2 FQHS. At the highest densities, the 2DES
becomes 2C, signaled by the emergence of a bilayer Wigner crystal state and the
transitions of FQHSs flanking $\nu=1/2$. The 1/2 FQHS remains robust near this
transition and, notably, its charge transport energy gap exhibits an
\textit{upward} cusp with a maximum value of about 6 K on the 1C side of the
transition; this is the largest gap reported for any even-denominator FQHS. Our
observation of the transition of the 2DES ground states near $\nu=1/2$ to 2C
states at high densities, and our measurements of the robustness of the 1/2
FQHS against charge distribution asymmetry, suggest that the 1/2 FQHS also
makes a transition from 1C to 2C. Such a transition from a non-Abelian to
Abelian state can open avenues for topological quantum information and quantum
criticality.

We report cutting-edge performance results via mixed-precision spin adapted
ab initio Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) electronic structure
calculations utilizing the Ozaki scheme for emulating FP64 arithmetic through
the use of fixed-point compute resources. By approximating the underlying
matrix and tensor algebra with operations on a modest number of fixed-point
representatives (``slices''), we demonstrate on smaller benchmark systems and
for the active compounds of the FeMoco and cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes with
complete active space (CAS) sizes of up to 113 electrons in 76 orbitals
[CAS(113, 76)] and 63 electrons in 58 orbitals [CAS(63, 58)], respectively,
that the chemical accuracy can be reached with mixed-precision arithmetic. We
also show that, due to its variational nature, DMRG provides an ideal tool to
benchmark accuracy domains, as well as the performance of new hardware
developments and related numerical libraries. Detailed numerical error analysis
and performance assessment are also presented for subcomponents of the DMRG
algebra by systematically interpolating between double- and
pseudo-half-precision. Our analyis represents the first quantum chemistry
evaluation of FP64 emulation for correlated calculations capable of achieving
chemical accuracy and emulation based on fixed-point arithmetic, and it paves
the way for the utilization of state-of-the-art Blackwell technology in
tree-like tensor network state electronic structure calculations, opening new
research directions in materials sciences and beyond.

The formulation of a fluctuating hydrodynamic theory for interacting
particles is a crucial step in the theoretical description of liquids. The
microscopic mappings proposed decades ago by Dean and Kawasaki have played a
central role in the analytical treatment of such problems. However, the
singular mathematical nature of the density distributions used in these
derivations raises concerns about the validity and practical utility of the
resulting stochastic partial differential equations, particularly for direct
numerical simulations. Recent efforts have centered on establishing a rigorous
coarse-graining procedure to regularize the effective Dean-Kawasaki equation.
Building on this foundation, we numerically investigate weakly interacting
fluids within such a regularized framework for the first time. Our work
reveals, at the level of structural correlations, the effects of regularization
on the Dean-Kawasaki formalism and paves the way for improved numerical
approaches to simulate fluctuating hydrodynamics in liquids.

### Integrable Floquet Time Crystals in One Dimension

- **TL;DR**: 在可积的一维自旋链中实现离散时间晶体相，通过周期性驱动和次近邻耦合工程产生稳定的亚谐波响应，避免了无序系统中时间晶体的预热脆弱性。

We demonstrate the realization of a discrete-time crystal (DTC) phase in a
family of periodically driven, one-dimensional quadratic lattice Hamiltonians
that can be obtained using spin chains. These interactions preserve
integrability while opening controllable gaps at resonant quasienergies and
pinning the emergent quasienergy modes that are responsible for subharmonics.
We demonstrate that the DTC phase is rigid in the parameter space of transverse
field and an additional interaction like NNN coupling strength, with the drive
frequency optimized to produce the strongest subharmonic response. We also
provide a detailed phase portrait of the model, exhibiting a variety of new
dynamical phases, such as a fragile time crystal and both spin-liquid and
paramagnetic phases, as well as sharp quantum phase transitions between them.
Finite-size scaling of the Floquet quasienergy splitting between the emergent
subharmonic mode and its conjugate shows that the DTC lifetime diverges
exponentially with system size. Our work thus establishes a novel mechanism for
realizing robust, long-lived DTCs in one dimension, and paves the way for their
experimental realization in near-term quantum simulators. Motivation for this
work stems from the limitations of disorder-based stabilization schemes that
rely on many-body localization and exhibit only prethermal or finite-lived
plateaus, eventually restoring ergodicity. Disorder-free routes are therefore
highly desirable. Integrable (or Floquet-integrable) systems provide an
attractive alternative because their extensive set of conserved quantities and
constrained scattering strongly restrict thermalization channels. Our
construction exploits these integrable restrictions together with short-range
NNN engineering to produce a clean, robust DTC that avoids the prethermal
fragility of disordered realizations.

We present a calculation of the magnon spectra and chiral lifetimes of
altermagnons in bulk CrSb using the many-body perturbation theory. The
spin-split band structure is evident in the magnon spectra. Altermagnons attain
an energy of 275 meV at the K point of the Brillouin zone. Due to large spin
splitting at a specific ${\bf q}$ point along the A - M direction, lifetime
differences of chiral altermagnons reach approximately 20 fs.

### General framework for quantifying dissipation pathways in open quantum systems. III. Off-diagonal system-bath couplings

This paper extends the previously reported theory of dissipation pathways [J.
Chem. Phys. 160, 214111 (2024)] to incorporate off-diagonal subsystem-bath
coupling, which is often required to model molecular systems where the
environment directly influences transitions and couplings between subsystem
states. We systematically derive master equations for both population transfer
and dissipation into individual bath components, for which we also rigorously
prove energy conservation and detailed balance. The approach is based on
second-order perturbation theory with respect to the subsystem-bath couplings,
whose form is not limited to any specific model. The accuracy of the developed
method is tested by applying it to diverse model Hamiltonians involving
linearly coupled harmonic oscillator baths and comparing the outcomes against
the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) method. Overall, our method
accurately quantifies the contributions of specific bath components to the
overall dissipation while significantly reducing the computational cost
compared to numerically exact methods such as HEOM, thus offering a path to
examine how vibronic interactions steer non-adiabatic processes in realistic
chemical systems.

### Effective linear response in non-equilibrium anyonic systems

Linear response theory serves as a fundamental tool in the study of quantum
transport, extensively employed to elucidate fundamental mechanisms related to
the nature of the particles involved and the underlying symmetries. This
framework is, however, limited to equilibrium or near-equilibrium conditions.
Here, we develop an effective linear response theory designed to describe
charge and thermal quantum transport, where the reference far-from-equilibrium
stationary state comprises anyons forming a dilute beam. We apply our theory to
study tunnel-coupled anyonic beams in collider geometries, enabling braiding,
collisions, and tunneling of anyons at the central collider. Our
linear-response transport coefficients directly reflect the fractional charge
and statistics of the anyons involved, avoiding the need to measure
higher-order current correlations. Moreover, the emergence of finite
thermoelectric (Peltier and Seebeck) coefficients signifies the presence of
real anyon collisions (as opposed to virtual braiding in the time domain),
intimately associated with a broken particle-hole symmetry, specific to anyonic
gases.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究通过实验和理论计算揭示了V2Se2O材料中轨道选择性的电子-电子关联和电子-声子耦合效应，d_xy轨道带出现带宽重整化，而d_(xz/yz)轨道带显示声子耦合引起的kink异常。

Orbital-selective many-body effects, in which electrons occupying different
orbitals experience distinct interaction strengths, play a crucial role in
correlated multiorbital materials. However, these effects usually manifest in a
complex manner, obscuring their microscopic origins. Here, by combining
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements with theoretical
calculations, we reveal pronounced orbital selectivity in both
electron-electron correlation and electron-phonon coupling in the van der Waals
material V2Se2O. Electron correlation induces distinct bandwidth
renormalization exclusively in the V d_xy-derived band, while the bands mainly
composed of the other d orbitals remain essentially unrenormalized.
Orbital-resolved analyses identify that the filling number and the bandwidth
are decisive factors governing orbital-dependent correlation. Simultaneously,
the d_(xz/yz)-derived band exhibits a sharp kink anomaly, arising from enhanced
coupling to high-energy phonon modes dominated by oxygen vibrations. Such
pronounced orbital selectivity positions V2Se2O as a rare and prototypical
platform for unravelling the microscopic mechanisms of orbital-selective
electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions, and offers guiding
principles for the design of correlated multiorbital materials.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文报道了在单层VS₂中发现的新型非公度电荷密度波超结构，以及随着层数增加向公度超结构的演变，揭示了钒自插层在CDW结构演化中的关键作用。

Spontaneous formation of charge density wave (CDW) superstructures in
monolayers (MLs) of a two-dimensional (2D) crystal lattice is fundamental in
understanding its complex quantum states. We report a successful top-down
liquid phase exfoliation and stamp transfer process (LPESTP) to create ML
VS\textsubscript{2}, undergoing a CDW transition at room temperature. Using
high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and electron
diffraction (ED), we observed the coexistence of 1T and 2H polymorphic phases
in VS\textsubscript{2} at room temperature, and only the 1T phase undergoes CDW
transition. We discovered a novel incommensurate CDW superstructure ($\sqrt{7}
\times \sqrt{7}$) R19.1\textsuperscript{o} in ML 1T-VS\textsubscript{2}. With
an increase in the number of layers, the CDW order changes to a commensurate
($2 \times 2$) superstructure. Using angle-dependent photoelectron
spectroscopy, we have shown that vanadium atoms self-intercalate as
V\textsuperscript{3+} ions in multilayer VS\textsubscript{2} and are
responsible for the evolution of the CDW superstructure from the incommensurate
$\sqrt{7} \times \sqrt{7}$) R 19.1\textsuperscript{o} to the commensurate
($2\times2$) order. We also report the observation of novel Moir\'e
superlattices in twisted bilayer 1T-VS\textsubscript{2} flakes with trapped CDW
superstructure of the monolayer. Our findings provide an important platform for
understanding the evolution of CDW superstructures in 1T-VS\textsubscript{2}
with thickness and V self-intercalation.

The simplest, algebraic quantum-electrodynamical corrections, due to the
double-negative energy subspace and instantaneous interactions, are computed to
the no-pair Dirac-Coulomb(-Breit) energy of two-spin-1/2-fermion systems.
Numerical results are reported for two-electron atoms with a clamped nucleus
and positronium-like genuine two-particle systems. The Bethe-Salpeter equation
provides the theoretical framework, and numerical methods have been developed
for its equal-time time-slice. In practice, it requires solving a
sixteen-component eigenvalue equation with a two-particle Dirac Hamiltonian,
including the appropriate interaction. The double-pair corrections can either
be included in the interaction part of the eigenvalue equation or treated as a
perturbation to the no-pair Hamiltonian. The numerical results have an $\alpha$
fine-structure constant dependence that is in excellent agreement with the
known $\alpha^3E_\mathrm{h}\$-order double-pair correction of non-relativistic
quantum electrodynamics.

Magnetoresistance is a powerful probe for characterizing the intrinsic

magnetoresistance has a long history and continues attracting research
interest. In contemporary studies, a clear understanding of the
magnetoresistance character of quantum origin is more crucial than ever for the
study of emerging materials. In this perspective, we examine the linear
magnetoresistance of quantum mechanism, from its theoretical basis to
experimental studies, and discuss open questions and promising future research
directions in this field.

Freestanding ferroelectric membranes are promising for flexible electronics,
nonvolatile memory, photonics, and spintronics, but their synthesis is
challenged by the need for reproducibility with precise stoichiometric control.
Here, we demonstrate the adsorption-controlled growth of single-crystalline,
epitaxial BaTiO3 films by hybrid molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) on a binary oxide
sacrificial layer. Using a simple water-droplet lift-off method, we obtained
submillimeter- to millimeter-sized membranes that retained crystallinity, as
confirmed by high-resolution X-ray diffraction, and exhibited robust tetragonal
symmetry by Raman spectroscopy. Impedance spectroscopy confirmed a high
dielectric constant of 1340, reflecting the robust dielectric response of the
membranes. Ferroelectric functionality was revealed by piezoresponse force
microscopy (PFM) and further verified by polarization-electric field (P-E) loop
measurements with Positive-Up-Negative-Down (PUND). The P-E loops exhibited a
remnant polarization of 5 microC cm-2 and a coercive field of 63 kV cm-1. These
results were interpreted in relation to c- and a-domain configurations. These
results establish hybrid MBE as a generalizable route for producing
stoichiometry-controlled ferroelectric membranes, enabling their integration
into next-generation flexible and multifunctional quantum oxide devices.

The semi-empirical Pariser-Parr-Pople (PPP) Hamiltonian is reviewed for its
ability to provide a minimal model of the chemistry of conjugated
$\pi$-electron systems, and its current applications and limitations are
discussed. From its inception, the PPP Hamiltonian has helped in the
development of new computational approaches in instances where compute is
constrained due to its inherent approximations that allow for an efficient
representation and calculation of many systems of chemical and technological
interest. The crucial influence of electron correlation on the validity of
these approximations is discussed, and we review how PPP model exact
calculations have enabled a deeper understanding of conjugated polymer systems.
More recent usage of the PPP Hamiltonian includes its application in
high-throughput screening activities to the inverse design problem, which we
illustrate here for two specific fields of technological interest: singlet
fission and singlet-triplet inverted energy gap molecules. Finally, we
conjecture how utilizing the PPP model in quantum computing applications could
be mutually beneficial.

- **TL;DR**: 使用光学光谱研究立方SrSi2中的可能双外尔态，发现传统密度泛函理论无法准确描述费米能级附近的电子结构，而半局域交换关联势能更好地与实验吻合，表明SrSi2具有约40 meV的直接带隙的平凡（有隙）能带结构。

We probe the possible double-Weyl state in cubic SrSi2 using optical
spectroscopy. The complex optical conductivity was measured in a frequency
range from 70 to 22 000 cm-1 at temperatures down to 10 K at ambient pressure.
The optical response of SrSi2 can be well separated into the intraband (free
carriers) and interband contributions. Additionally, four infrared-active
phonons are detected. As follows from the optical spectra, the free-carrier
density decreases with decreasing temperature, consistent with an activation
behaviour. Experimental interband conductivity juxtaposed with ab initio
calculations shows that conventional density-functional theory fails to
describe the electronic structure of SrSi2 in the vicinity of the Fermi level.
A semi-local exchange-correlation potential allows a much better agreement with
the experiment, resulting in the trivial (gapped) band structure of SrSi2. The
direct gap estimated from the measurements is approximately 40 meV.

### Finite temperature dopant-induced spin reorganization explored via tensor networks in the two-dimensional $t$-$J$ model

- **TL;DR**: 使用张量网络方法在热力学极限下模拟二维t-J模型，研究掺杂莫特绝缘体中的自旋-电荷相互作用，发现空穴对和单空穴对反铁磁性的不同影响。

Doped Mott insulators host intertwined spin-charge phenomena that evolve with
temperature and can culminate in stripe order or superconductivity at low
temperatures. The two-dimensional $t$-$J$ model captures this interplay yet
finite-temperature, infinite-size calculations remain difficult. Using
purification represented by a tensor network - an infinite projected
entangled-pair state (iPEPS) ansatz - we simulate the $t$-$J$ model at finite
temperature directly in the thermodynamic limit, reaching temperatures down to
one tenth of the hopping rate and hole concentrations up to one quarter of the
lattice sites. Beyond specific heat, uniform susceptibility, and
compressibility, we introduce dopant-conditioned multi-point correlators that
map how holes reshape local exchange. Nearest-neighbor hole pairs produce a
strong cooperative response that reinforces antiferromagnetism on the adjacent
parallel bonds, and single holes weaken nearby antiferromagnetic bonds; d-wave
pairing correlations remain short-ranged over the same window. These results
provide experiment-compatible thermodynamic-limit benchmarks and establish
dopant-conditioned correlators as incisive probes of short-range spin-texture
reorganization at finite temperature.

- **TL;DR**: 异螺旋烯分子在非磁性Cu(100)表面诱导产生吸附磁性，通过强化学吸附和界面电荷重分布形成局域自旋极化态。

We report the emergence of adsorption-induced magnetism from heterohelicene
molecules on a non-magnetic Cu(100) surface. Spin-polarized low-energy electron
microscopy (SP-LEEM) measurements reveal spin-dependent electron reflectivity
for enantiopure 7,12,17-trioxa[11]helicene (TO[11]H) monolayers, indicating the
formation of a spin-polarized state localized in the topmost copper layer.
Control experiments on clean Cu(100) and TO[11]H on highly oriented pyrolytic
graphite show no such effect, excluding artifacts and chirality-induced spin
selectivity as origins. Spin-polarized density functional theory calculations
with hybrid functionals attribute the magnetism to strong chemisorption, which
induces hybridization between the molecular HOMO and copper s- and d-states,
driving asymmetric spin-polarized charge redistribution at the interface. An
extended Newns-Anderson-Grimley model incorporating on-site Coulomb repulsion
in Cu d-orbitals reproduces the emergence of interfacial spin polarization
above a threshold interaction strength, highlighting the key roles of
hybridization parameters and Coulomb correlation. These findings reveal a
mechanism for inducing magnetism at molecule-metal interfaces without
inherently magnetic components, offering new avenues for engineering
spin-polarized states in organic-inorganic hybrid systems.

The frustrated magnet Bi2Fe4O9 has been reported to exhibit complex spin
dynamics coexisting with conventional spin wave excitations. The magnetic Fe3+
(S = 5/2) ions are arranged into a distorted two-dimensional Cairo pentagonal
lattice with weak couplings between the layers, developing long-ranged
non-collinear antiferromagnetic order below 245 K. In order to enable studies
and modelling of the complex dynamics close to TN, we have reexamined the
magnetic excitations across the complete energy scale (0 &lt; E &lt; 90 meV) at 10 K.
We discover two distinct gaps, which can be explained by introducing,
respectively, easy axis and easy plane anisotropy on the two unequivalent
Fe-sites. We develop a refined spin Hamiltonian that accurately accounts for
the dispersion of essentially all spin-wave branches across the full spectral
range, except around 40 meV, where a splitting and dispersion are observed. We
propose that this mode is derived from phonon hybridization. Polarisation
analysis shows that the system has magnetic anisotropic fluctuations,
consistent with our model. A continuum of scattering is observed above the spin
wave branches and is found to principally be explained by an instrumental
resolution effect. The full experimental mapping of the excitation spectrum and
the refined spin Hamiltonian provides a foundation for future quantitative
studies of spin waves coexisting with unconventional magnetic fluctuations in
this frustrated magnet found at higher temperatures.

### Finding the temperature window for atomic layer deposition of ruthenium metal via efficient phonon calculations

- **TL;DR**: 使用第一性原理热力学研究氧化钌表面与氢气的反应，解释了Ru金属原子层沉积(ALD)仅在100℃以上窄温度窗口发生的原因，预测了生长速率和温度依赖性。

We investigate the use of first principles thermodynamics based on periodic
density functional theory (DFT) to examine the gas-surface chemistry of an
oxidized ruthenium surface reacting with hydrogen gas. This reaction system
features in the growth of ultrathin Ru films by atomic layer deposition (ALD).
We reproduce and rationalize the experimental observation that ALD of the metal
from RuO4 and H2 occurs only in a narrow temperature window above 100{\deg}C,
and this validates the approach. Specifically, the temperature-dependent
reaction free energies are computed for the competing potential reactions of
the H2 reagent, and show that surface oxide is reduced to water, which is
predicted to desorb thermally above 113{\deg}C, exposing bare Ru that can
further react to surface hydride, and hence deposit Ru metal. The saturating
coverages give a predicted growth rate of 0.7 \r{A}/cycle of Ru. At lower
temperatures, free energies indicate that water is retained at the surface and
reacts with the RuO4 precursor to form an oxide film, also in agreement with
experiment. The temperature dependence is obtained with the required accuracy
by computing Gibbs free energy corrections from phonon calculations within the
harmonic approximation. Surface phonons are computed rapidly and efficiently by
parallelization on a cloud architecture within the Schr\"odinger Materials
Science Suite. We also show that rotational and translational entropy of gases
dominate the free energies, permitting an alternative approach without phonon
calculations, which would be suitable for rapid pre-screening of gas-surface
chemistries.

Quantum optimal control is central to designing spin manipulation pulses.
While GRAPE efficiently computes gradients, realistic ensemble models make
optimization time-consuming. In this work, we accelerated single-spin optimal
control by combining the finite element method with the method of moving
asymptotes. By treating discretized time as spatial coordinates, the
Liouville-von Neumann equation was reformulated as a linear system, yielding
gradients solving over an order of magnitude faster than GRAPE with less than
one percent relative-accuracy loss. The moving asymptotes further improves
convergence, outperforming L-BFGS and approaching Newton-level efficiency.

Anyon colliders -- quantum Hall devices where dilute quasiparticle beams
collide at a quantum point contact -- provide an interferometer-free probe of
anyonic exchange phases through current cross correlations. Within a
non-equilibrium bosonization framework, the normalized cross-correlations take
a universal form depending only on the exchange phase and the dynamical
exponent, enabling experimental demonstration of anyonic statistics. This
result can be interpreted as time-domain interference -- braiding in time
rather than spatial exclusion or real-space interferometry. Extension to
hierarchical states shows that the semiclassical step-function description of
quasiparticles fails at large statistical angles. Introducing a finite soliton
width resolves this issue and enables quantitative modeling of charge-$e/5$
quasiparticle collisions.

Understanding the interplay between screening, electronic correlations, and
collective excitations is essential for the design of two-dimensional quantum
materials. Here, we present a comprehensive first-principles study of more than
60 MA$_2$Z$_4$ monolayers, encompassing semiconducting, metallic,
cold-metallic, magnetic, and topological phases. Using the constrained random
phase approximation (cRPA), we compute material-specific effective Coulomb
interaction parameters $U$, $U'$, and $J$, including their spatial dependence
across distinct correlated subspaces defined by local coordination and crystal
symmetry. In semiconducting compounds, long-range nonlocal interactions
persist, revealing unconventional screening and suggesting strong excitonic
effects beyond simple dielectric models. In cold-metallic systems, sizable
long-range Coulomb interactions remain despite the presence of free carriers,
highlighting their atypical metallic screening. Among 33-valence-electron
compounds, we find $U_{\mathrm{eff}} &gt; W$ in the $\beta_2$ phase, indicating
proximity to charge-density-wave or Mott instabilities. Several V- and Nb-based
systems exhibit intermediate-to-strong correlation strength, with $U/W &gt; 1 $ in
multiple cases. Using cRPA-derived Stoner parameters, we identify magnetic
instabilities in various V-, Nb-, Cr-, and Mn-based compounds. Finally,
selected cold-metallic systems display plasmon dispersions that deviate from
the conventional $\sqrt{q}$ behavior, revealing nearly non-dispersive
low-energy modes. These results position MA$_2$Z$_4$ monolayers as a versatile
platform for investigating correlation-driven instabilities and emergent
collective behavior in two dimensions.

Since the initial synthesis of van der Waals two-dimensional indium selenide
was first documented in 1957, five distinct polymorphs and their corresponding
polytypes have been identified. In this study, we report a unique phase of
indium selenide via Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) analysis
in the synthesized large-area films -- which we have named the $\beta^\text{p}$
phase. The quintuple layers of the $\beta^\text{p}$ phase, characterized by a
unique zigzag atomic configuration with unequal indium-selenium bond lengths
from the middle selenium atom, are distinct from any other previously reported
phase of indium selenide. Cross-sectional STEM analysis has revealed that the
$\beta^\text{p}$ layers exhibit intralayer shifting. We found that indium
selenide films with $\beta^\text{p}$ layers display electric-field-induced
switchable polarization characteristic of ferroelectric materials, suggesting
the breaking of the inversion symmetry. Experimental observations of nonlinear
optical phenomena -- Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) responses further support
this conclusion. This study reports a $\beta^\text{p}$ phase of indium selenide
showing ferroelectricity over large areas at room temperature in a
low-dimensional limit.

We present a first-principles machine-learning computational framework to
investigate anharmonic effects in polarization-orientation (PO) Raman spectra
of molecular crystals, focusing on anthracene and naphthalene. By combining
machine learning models for interatomic potentials and polarizability tensors,
we enable efficient, large-scale simulations that capture temperature-dependent
vibrational dynamics beyond the harmonic approximation. Our approach reproduces
key qualitative features observed experimentally. We show, systematically, what
are the fingerprints of anharmonic lattice dynamics, thermal expansion, and
Raman tensor symmetries on PO-Raman intensities. However, we find that the
simulated polarization dependence of Raman intensities shows only subtle
deviations from quasi-harmonic predictions, failing to capture the pronounced
temperature-dependent changes that have been reported experimentally in
anthracene. We propose that part of these inconsistencies stem from the
impossibility to deconvolute certain vibrational peaks when only experimental
data is available. This work therefore provides a foundation to improve the
interpretation of PO-Raman experiments in complex molecular crystals with the
aid of theoretical simulations.

garnet (YIG) is the leading candidate, yet it is typically grown on gadolinium
gallium garnet (GGG) substrates, which develop a large paramagnetic moment at
low temperatures. This substrate effect limits spin-wave propagation. In this
work, we demonstrate that thin YIG films grown on yttrium scandium gallium
garnet (YSGG) substrates support robust spin-wave propagation in the
Damon-Eshbach geometry, measurable down to 2 K under applied magnetic fields up
to 150 mT. Compared with YIG/GGG, YIG/YSGG films exhibit narrower ferromagnetic
resonance (FMR) linewidths at low temperatures and are free from the atomic
interdiffusion effects that degrade the performance of YIG/GGG systems. These
results establish YIG/YSGG thin films as a promising low-temperature platform,
overcoming the intrinsic limitations of YIG/GGG and opening new opportunities
for scalable magnonic and hybrid quantum devices operating under cryogenic
conditions.

Frustration in Kondo spin lattice systems has led to the emergence of both
spin liquids that could be chiral and strange metals that deviate from Fermi
liquid behaviour when not in their antiferromagnetic ground state. In two
dimensions (2D), where deviations from bulk systems are expected, Kondo spin
lattice emergence have recently been observed in van der Waals systems.
Metallo-molecular interfaces of supramolecular lattices have also been
suggested as an alternative 2D Kondo spin lattice system where a single-ion
Kondo effect as well as an inter spin-site Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY)
coupling has been demonstrated in scanning tunnelling spectroscopy (STS)
studies. Here, going beyond ultrahigh vacuum STS studies on metallo-molecular
interfaces, we report a metastable frustrated antiferromagnetic state, with
ultra-high spin freezing temperatures (T_f), ranging from 240 K to 300 K on the
interfaces of highly textured Pt(111) and Pt(111)/Co films with organic
molecules grown in ultra-high vacuum 10^(-10) mbar. In the vicinity of the
spin-freezing transition, we measure a large anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) in
the Pt/Co/molecular heterostructure, with a Nernst coefficient of at least 3
microV per K. Our results suggest a 2D metallo-molecular Kondo spin lattice
with high temperature quantum correlations where an ANE beyond magnetisation is
manifested around room temperature.

### Atomistic Machine Learning with Cartesian Natural Tensors

- **TL;DR**: 提出了Cartesian Natural Tensor Networks (CarNet)作为原子尺度机器学习的通用框架，解决了传统笛卡尔空间方法在表示任意物理张量时缺乏系统性对称性保持框架的问题。

Atomistic machine learning (ML) is a transformative tool for accurate and
efficient investigation of material behavior at the atomic scale. While such
models have been constructed within Cartesian space to harness geometric
information and preserve intuitive physical representations, they face inherent
challenges - primarily due to the lack of a systematic symmetry-preserving
framework for representing arbitrary physical tensors. We address these
challenges by proposing Cartesian Natural Tensor Networks (CarNet) as a general
framework for atomistic ML. We first develop the theory of irreducible
representations using Cartesian natural tensors (their creation, operation, as
well as the decomposition and reconstruction of physical tensors such as the
elastic constant tensor). Leveraging this machinery, we design an equivariant
Cartesian model and demonstrate its exceptional performance across diverse
atomistic ML tasks. CarNet enables the development of highly accurate and
reliable interatomic potentials for both materials and molecular systems.
Furthermore, structure-property relationships can be readily constructed for
tensorial quantities ranging from simple properties like the dipole moment to
arbitrary high-rank tensors with complex symmetries such as the elastic
constant tensor -- capabilities that were previously inaccessible. This work
removes theoretical barriers and unleashes the power of Cartesian approaches
for advanced atomistic ML in the understanding and design of new materials.

Atomic defects in solid-state materials are building blocks for future
quantum technologies, such as quantum communication networks, computers, and
sensors. Until recently, a handful of defects in a small selection of host
materials have been possible candidates. Recent developments have revealed that
hexagonal boron nitride, a wide-bandgap two-dimensional material, hosts
single-photon-emitting atomic defects with access to optically addressable
electronic and nuclear spins at room temperature. Now, atomically thin quantum
devices that operate at ambient conditions are a possibility. In this
perspective, we discuss the recent progress, and challenges, in understanding
the fundamental photophysics of defects in hBN, as well as specific
opportunities they present for the development of quantum technologies.

### Magnetic Moment Fragmentation in an All-in-All-out Pyrochlore $\mathrm{Nd_2Sn_2O_7}$

We report single crystal neutron spectroscopy and bulk characterization on
hydrothermally grown $\mathrm{Nd_2Sn_2O_7}$, revealing magnetic moment
fragmentation embedded within the all-in-all-out ordered state. The spectra
reveal a nearly flat band with pinch-point momentum dependence accompanied by
dispersive branches that produce half-moon features across multiple Brillouin
zones. These defining signatures are captured quantitatively by a minimal
dipolar-octupolar spin Hamiltonian, demonstrating excellent agreement between
experiment and theory. The higher flat-mode energy helps account for the
absence of dynamical interference in prior $\mathrm{\mu SR}$ studies, while the
lack of any photon-like excitation imposes strict constraints on the proposed
Coulombic antiferromagnet scenario. Our results extend moment fragmentation to
$\mathrm{Nd_2Sn_2O_7}$ and identify it as a clean, tractable platform for
quantitative exploration of emergent gauge field physics in frustrated magnets.

### Direct observation of band structure modifications from monolayer WSe2 to Janus WSSe

- **TL;DR**: 通过μ-ARPES研究从WSe2到Janus WSSe的电子结构演化，观察到Rashba型自旋分裂和Γ点价带顶160meV上移，揭示了Janus TMDs的关键电子特性。

Janus monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), created by
post-growth substitution of the top chalcogen layer, represent a new direction
for engineering 2D crystal properties. However, their rapid ambient degradation
and the difficulty of obtaining large-area monolayer samples have limited the
available experimental probes, leaving their detailed electronic structure near
the Fermi level largely unexplored. In this work, by performing micro-focused
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy ({\mu}-ARPES) on an identical sample
transformed from monolayer WSe2 to Janus WSSe via a H2 plasma-assisted
chalcogen-exchange method, we reveal the evolution of its electronic band
structure. We observe ARPES signature consistent with the Rashba-type spin
splitting due to broken horizontal mirror symmetry, and a significant upward
shift of the highest valence band at the {\Gamma}-point by approximately 160
meV. These direct observations clarify the key electronic modifications that
govern the material's properties and provide a pathway for band engineering in
Janus TMDs.

### Variational optimization of projected entangled-pair states on the triangular lattice

We introduce a general corner transfer matrix renormalization group algorithm
tailored to projected entangled-pair states on the triangular lattice. By
integrating automatic differentiation, our approach enables direct variational
energy minimization on this lattice geometry. In contrast to conventional
approaches that map the triangular lattice onto a square lattice with diagonal
next-nearest-neighbour interactions, our native formulation yields improved
variational results at the same bond dimension. This improvement stems from a
more faithful and physically informed representation of the entanglement
structure in the tensor network and an increased number of variational
parameters. We apply our method to the antiferromagnetic nearest-neighbour
Heisenberg model on the triangular and kagome lattice, and benchmark our
results against previous numerical studies.

A Chain of Springs and Masses (CSM) model is used in the interpretation of
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of movement of atoms in FCC crystals,
oriented like during typical simulations performed in studies of the dynamics
of line dislocations. The proposed description is inspired by and supported by
MD simulations. We find out that a force that is perpendicular to the direction
of the applied external shear pressure and in the direction of line
dislocations occurs within the bulk of crystal volume. The force is of a
dynamic origin, and it has not been analyzed so far. It is proportional to the
square of the applied pressure; It causes breaking of axial symmetry for
propagation of transverse acoustic waves. It leads to a non-linear and
non-elastic response of crystals and to chaotic patterns in motion of atoms. We
provide an analytical derivation of an effective atomistic potential for
interaction between atoms and propose an analytical model of their dynamics.
The model predicts some effects that may have been overlooked in experiments
and are inconsistent with the static theory of elasticity of crystals.

Exciton-polaritons, hybrid photon-exciton quasiparticles, constitute a useful
platform for the study of light-matter interaction and nonlinear photonic
applications. In this work, we realize a monolithic Tamm-plasmon microcavity
embedding a thin film of two-dimensional halide perovskites with a tunable
polymer spacer that controls the exciton-photon detuning. Angle-resolved
optical spectroscopy at room temperature reveals the lower polariton branch
dispersions in the linear regime for several detunings. Under circularly
polarized, non-resonant laser excitation, the spin injection of high-energy
excitons and their relaxation towards the lower polariton branch demonstrates
its preservation, in contrast to the bare exciton case. The spin-polarized
emission survives due to the fast decay of polaritons. Our results provide
promising insights into the non-resonant spin control of polaritonic devices,
including chiral lasers and switches.

We report the electronic structure of monolayer CrSBr exfoliated onto mica
template-stripped gold substrates. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
reveals charge transfer from the substrate, populating the conduction band of
monolayer CrSBr, accompanied by a pronounced reduction in the quasiparticle
band gap. Furthermore, we observe two separate conduction bands that exhibit a
splitting at the X point. This indicates a breaking of glide-mirror symmetry,
which in the bulk or in a free-standing monolayer protects the band
degeneracies at the Brillouin zone boundary. Our results demonstrate that
ultraflat gold substrates do more than modify carrier densities and screening:
they can lift symmetry-protected degeneracies and thus fundamentally reshape
the band topology of 2D materials.

### Longitudinal transport spin polarization of spin degenerate antiferromagnets

- **TL;DR**: 该论文挑战了传统认知，证明具有PT对称性的反铁磁体也能产生纵向自旋电流，其强度与PT对称性破缺的反铁磁体相当。

A vital goal in spintronics is the efficient electrical generation of spin
currents, a pursuit that has recently focused on using antiferromagnets (AFMs)
as spin current sources. It has been demonstrated that antiferromagnets with
broken PT symmetry (parity + time reversal) can efficiently generate
longitudinal and transverse spin currents. At the same time, it has been
generally thought that antiferromagnets with PT symmetry (PT-AFMs) forbid the
longitudinal spin polarization due to their spin-degenerate band structure.
Here, in contrast to this common expectation, we show, using theoretical
analysis based on magnetic point group symmetry, that most PT-AFMs can generate
longitudinal spin currents due to spin-orbit coupling. Using density-functional
theory, we calculate the longitudinal spin conductivity of representative
PT-AFMs, L10-MnPt and Mn2Au, and show that its magnitude is comparable to that
of their PT-broken counterparts. Our symmetry-enabled classification of
antiferromagnets and theoretical results for the longitudinal spin conductivity
in representative PT-AFMs expands our understanding of spin transport and shows
the possibility of robust spin-current generation in a broad range of
spin-degenerate antiferromagnets.

### Stability of graphene hyperbolic pseudospheres under harsh conditions

- **TL;DR**: 该论文提出了一种新的分子动力学模拟方法，用于创建稳定的石墨烯双曲伪球面结构，这些结构在大的外部变形和高温退火下表现出高稳定性。

We demonstrate the high stability of simulated graphene hyperbolic
pseudospheres under large externally imposed deformations and high temperature
annealing. Hyperbolic pseudospheres are produced in a two-step Molecular
Dynamics simulation process. First, carbon atoms are forced down a thin
three-dimensional volume of a chosen shape. During this extrusion process the
carbon atoms form a precursor to graphene that is unrealistically less stable
than graphite or diamond. Then the unstable carbon structure is annealed inside
the thin volume at high temperature, turning the carbon into realistic
polycrystalline, curved graphene. Point defects naturally appear in numbers and
places that stabilize the graphene in the desired shape, without high residual
stresses. We applied this new methodology to the creation of graphene
hyperbolic pseudosphere surfaces, which reproduce analogs to some aspects of
classical or quantum gravity. The free edges of the pseudosphere cause bending
of the graphene. When these free edges are removed from the simulations by
attaching periodic flat graphene sheets to the pseudosphere edges, the carbon
atoms assume positions just some tenths of \r{A} from the mathematical
hyperbolic pseudosphere surface. In demanding tests of their stability, the
hyperbolic pseudospheres proved stable against $20^\circ$ shearing or $20\%$
elongation and then being released, which eventually raised their temperatures
by $\sim 300 \ \text{K}$. Our methodology is relatively easy to use and offers
a practical way to create simulated curved graphene surfaces of almost any
shape. It allows for thorough testing in advance of the stability of graphene
shapes that are to be produced experimentally.

The neutral $(V_N-3Mg_{Ga})^0$ complex was found to be the primary
compensator in Mg-doped, N-polar GaN. The experimental data showed a sharp drop
in hole concentration once [Mg] exceeded ~$10^{19} cm^{-3}$.
Temperature-dependent Hall measurements, in conjunction with a charge balance
model, revealed that the carrier loss was due to a drastic reduction in
acceptor concentration ($N_A$), suggesting that a significant fraction of Mg
atoms incorporated in an electrically neutral configuration. A quantitative
semi-empirical model based on the grand canonical formalism pointed to the
formation of $(V_N-3Mg_{Ga})^0$ complexes as the primary cause for the observed
carrier loss.

In recent years, the study of Majorana signatures in quantum transport has
become a central focus in condensed matter physics. Here, we present a rigorous
and systematic derivation of the fermionic superoperator describing the open
quantum dynamics of electron transport through Majorana zero modes, building on
the techniques introduced in Phys. Rev. B 105, 035121 (2022). The numerical
implementation of this superoperator is to construct its differential
equivalence, the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM). The HEOM approach
describes the system-bath correlated dynamics. Furthermore, we also develop a
functional derivative scheme that provides exact expressions for the transport
observables in terms of the auxiliary density operators introduced in the HEOM
formulation. The superoperator formalism establishes a solid theoretical
foundation for analyzing key transport signatures that may uncover the unique
characteristics of Majorana physics in mesoscopic systems.

Recent theoretical work has predicted that dislocation patterning induces
anisotropic flat bands in the electronic band diagram, which can lead to
unusual effects such as unconventional superconductivity. This work develops a
reduced-dimensional framework to provide insights into their origin. An
effective one-dimensional dislocation potential is constructed by averaging
over the spatial distributions of dislocations along a singular direction. The
resulting model introduces a parameter that quantifies the strain modulation,
thereby providing a transparent approach to analyze the role of dislocation
strain in leading to flat band formation.

Vacuum cavity control of quantum materials is the engineering of quantum
materials systems through electromagnetic zero-point fluctuations. In this work
we articulate a generic mechanism for vacuum optical control of correlated
electronic order: Casimir control, where the zero-point energy of the
electromagnetic continuum, the Casimir energy, depends on the properties of the
material system. To assess the experimental viability of this mechanism we
focus on the Casimir stabilization of fluctuating nematic order. In nematic
Fermi liquids, different orientations of the electronic order are often
energetically degenerate. Thus, while local domains of fixed orientation may
form, thermal disordering inhibits long range order. By engineering the
electromagnetic environment of the electronic system, however, we show that the
Casimir energy can be used as a tool to preferentially stabilize particular
orientations of the nematic order. As a concrete example, we examine the
interplay between a birefringent crystal -- which sources an anisotropic
electromagnetic environment -- and a quantum Hall stripe system, an archetypal
nematic Fermi fluid. We show that for experimentally feasible setups, the
anisotropy induced by the orientation dependent Casimir energy can be $10^4$
times larger than other mechanisms known to stabilize quantum Hall stripes.
This finding convincingly implies that our setting may be realized with
currently available experimental technology. Having demonstrated that the
Casimir energy can be used to stabilize fluctuating nematic order, we close by
discussing the implications for recent terahertz cavity experiments on quantum
Hall stripes, as well as pave the road towards broader Casimir control of
competing correlated electronic phases.

Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at textual reasoning and are beginning to
develop spatial understanding, prompting the question of whether these
abilities can be combined for complex, domain-specific tasks. This question is
essential in fields like materials science, where deep understanding of 3D
atomic structures is fundamental. While initial studies have successfully
applied LLMs to tasks involving pure crystal generation or coordinate
understandings, a standardized benchmark to systematically evaluate their core
reasoning abilities across diverse atomic structures has been notably absent.
To address this gap, we introduce the AtomWorld benchmark to evaluate LLMs on
tasks based in Crystallographic Information Files (CIFs), a standard structure
representation format. These tasks, including structural editing, CIF
perception, and property-guided modeling, reveal a critical limitation: current
models, despite establishing promising baselines, consistently fail in
structural understanding and spatial reasoning. Our experiments show that these
models make frequent errors on structure modification tasks, and even in the
basic CIF format understandings, potentially leading to cumulative errors in
subsequent analysis and materials insights. By defining these standardized
tasks, AtomWorld lays the ground for advancing LLMs toward robust atomic-scale
modeling, crucial for accelerating materials research and automating scientific
workflows.

Biotite crystals are phyllosilicate trioctahedral micas with the general
chemical formula K(Mg,Fe)3AlSi3O10(OH)2 that form a solid-solution series with
iron-poor phlogopite and iron-rich annite endmembers. With a wide band gap
energy and a layered structure with free surface charges, biotite nanosheets
can be readily obtained by cleavage methods and used as dielectrics in
nanodevice fabrication for the next generation of electronics and energy
harvesting. Here, a comprehensive study of biotite samples with different iron
concentrations and oxidation states is presented. Structural, optical,
magneto-optical, and magnetic characterizations were performed using several
experimental techniques, including state-of-the-art synchrotron-based
techniques, to correlate the iron chemistry (content and oxidation state) with
the macroscopic properties of both minerals. The study reveals a
nanoscale-homogeneous Fe distribution via synchrotron X-ray fluorescence
mapping, defect-mediated optical transitions modulated by Fe3+/Fe2+ ratios, and
temperature-dependent magnetic transitions from paramagnetism to competing
ferro-/antiferromagnetic interactions. Furthermore, the use of these biotite
crystals as substrates for ultrathin heterostructures incorporating monolayer
(ML) MoSe2 is explored by magneto photoluminescence at cryogenic temperatures.
The results show that the presence of iron impurities in different oxidation
states significantly impacts the valley properties for ML-MoSe2. Overall, these
findings offer a comprehensive interpretation of the physical properties of

We report new insights into the electronic, structural, and transport (heat
and charge) properties of the phase-change memory material Ge2Sb2Te5. Using
realistic structural models of Konstantinou et. al. [Nat. Commun. 10, 3065
(2019)], we analyze the topology, electronic states, and lattice dynamics with
density functional methods, including hybrid-functional calculations and
machine-learned interatomic potentials. The Kohn-Sham orbitals near the Fermi
level display a strong electron-phonon coupling, and exhibit large energy
fluctuations at room temperature. The conduction tail states exhibit larger
phonon-induced fluctuations than the valence tail states. To resolve transport
at the atomic scale, we employ space-projected electronic conductivity and
site-projected thermal conductivity methods. Local analysis of heat transport
highlights the role of filamentary networks dominated by Te, with Sb and Ge
making progressively smaller contributions.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究通过第一性原理计算和时变微动力学模型，揭示了六种金属酞菁催化剂在氧还原反应中的降解机制，发现主要降解途径包括碳氧化、氮质子化和脱金属化，其中RhPc和IrPc表现出比FePc更高的活性和稳定性。

Oxygen reduction catalysts frequently suffer from degradation under harsh
operating conditions, and the limited understanding of the underlying
mechanisms hampers the development of effective mitigation strategies. In this
study, we integrate first-principles calculations with a time-dependent
microkinetic model to investigate the deactivation pathways of six highly
active metal phthalocyanines (MPc, M = Cr, Mn, Fe, Ru, Rh, and Ir) during the
oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). We quantitatively assess the ORR processes,
hydrogen peroxide generation, radical generation, and three primary degradation
mechanisms, namely carbon oxidation, nitrogen protonation, and demetallation,
through a reaction network involving 40 chemical species and 75 elementary
reactions. Our findings reveal that the dominant degradation mechanism varies
significantly across the MPcs. Under typical alkaline conditions, the primary
byproducts arise from carbon oxidation, driven by .OH radical attack and
structural reorganization of surface adsorbates, and from protonation at either
the metal center or nitrogen sites. In the kinetics-controlled region, the ORR
activity follows the order of RhPc &gt; IrPc &gt; FePc &gt; MnPc &gt; RuPc &gt; CrPc. Notably,
RhPc and IrPc demonstrate both higher ORR activity and greater stability than
the widely studied FePc under elevated potentials.

### Comparing fine-tuning strategies of MACE machine learning force field for modeling Li-ion diffusion in LiF for batteries

- **TL;DR**: 该研究比较了MACE机器学习模型与DeePMD势在预测LiF中锂扩散性能方面的表现，发现MACE基础模型仅需少量或无需训练数据即可达到与经过大量训练的DeePMD相当的精度。

Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are transforming materials
science and engineering by enabling the study of complex phenomena, such as
those critical to battery operation. In this work, we benchmark the MACE
machine learning model against a well-trained DeePMD potential for predicting
interstitial lithium diffusivity in LiF, a key component in the solid
electrolyte interphase in Li ion batteries. Our results demonstrate that the
MACE-MPA-0 foundational model achieves comparable accuracy to well-trained
DeePMD, in predicting key diffusion properties based on molecular dynamics
simulation, while requiring minimal or no training data. For instance, the
MACE-MPA-0 predicts an activation energy Ea of 0.22 eV, the fine-tuned model
with only 300 data points predicts Ea = 0.20 eV, both of which show good
agreement with the DeePMD model reference value of Ea = 0.24 eV. In this work,
we provide a solid test case where fine-tuning approaches - whether using data
generated for DeePMD or data produced by the foundational MACE model itself -
yield similar robust performance to the DeePMD potential trained with over
40,000 actively learned data, albeit requiring only a fraction of the training
data.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究通过在CoCrFeNi多主元合金中形成铬化合物分散体（氧化物和碳化物）来增强其微观结构和高温力学性能，揭示了不同制备方法下铬化合物的演化及其对力学性能的影响。

Multi-principal element alloys (MPEAs) can potentially offer exceptional
material properties, but their complex, costly manufacturing limits their
scalability. Chemical complexity and complex manufacturing processes lead to
the formation of some secondary phases, which have a significant impact on the
final properties. In this work, chromium compound dispersoid enhancements (Cr-
oxides and carbides) were formed in CoCrFeNi MPEAs to enhance their
microstructural and high-temperature mechanical properties. A single FCC phase
was observed in the arc melted (AM) samples, chromium oxides were detected in
the gas-atomized (GA) samples, and Cr2O3 with Cr23C6 or Cr7C3 was found in the
mechanically alloyed (MA)samples depending on the sintering temperature.
Mechanical tests at room temperature and 575{\deg}C, where no phase evolution
is expected, showed that the GA samples with oxides achieved enhanced
mechanical properties at 575{\deg}C. This was co-induced by precipitation
strengthening, recrystallization suppression, and twinning-induced plasticity.
The MA samples with carbides exhibited high strength but low ductility, with
Cr7C3 outperforming Cr23C6 because of its lower hardness and twinning effects.
This work links chromium compound evolution to mechanical performance of MPEAs,
offering insights to optimize HEA production for high-temperature applications
through controlled phase formation.
