### Enhancing NMR Shielding Predictions of Atoms-in-Molecules Machine Learning Models with Neighborhood-Informed Representations
- **arXiv**: [2510.05623](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05623)  ·  [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.05623.pdf)
- **Title (EN)**: Enhancing NMR Shielding Predictions of Atoms-in-Molecules Machine Learning Models with Neighborhood-Informed Representations
- **Authors**: Surajit Das, Raghunathan Ramakrishnan
- **Categories**: physics.chem-ph
- **TL;DR**: 提出了原子级别的Coulomb矩阵和bag-of-bonds描述符的变体，并使用径向基函数扩展，创建了平滑的原子级表示。通过加入最近邻结构信息，开发了aCM-RBF(n)和aBoB-RBF(n)描述符家族，在NMR屏蔽预测中表现出色。

Accurate prediction of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) shielding with
machine learning (ML) models remains a central challenge for data-driven
spectroscopy. We present atomic variants of the Coulomb matrix (aCM) and
bag-of-bonds (aBoB) descriptors, and extend them using radial basis functions
(RBFs) to yield smooth, per-atom representations (aCM-RBF, aBoB-RBF). Local
structural information is incorporated by augmenting each atomic descriptor
with contributions from the n nearest neighbors, resulting in the family of
descriptors, aCM-RBF(n) and aBoB-RBF(n). For 13C shielding prediction on the
QM9NMR dataset (831,925 shielding values across 130,831 molecules), aBoB-RBF(4)
achieves an out-of-sample mean error of 1.69 ppm, outperforming models reported
in previous studies. While explicit three-body descriptors further reduce
errors at a higher cost, aBoB-RBF(4) offers the best balance of accuracy and
efficiency. Benchmarking on external datasets comprising larger molecules
(GDBm, Drug12/Drug40, and pyrimidinone derivatives) confirms the robustness and
transferability of aBoB-RBF(4), establishing it as a practical tool for
ML-based NMR shielding prediction.

### Advanced Characterization Methods for Crystals of an Extraordinary Material

- **TL;DR**: 该论文开发了多种物理化学表征方法来分析腺相关病毒衣壳晶体，包括交叉偏振光、扫描电镜、能谱分析和透射电镜，揭示了衣壳晶体的生长机制和结构特性。

Physicochemical characterization of materials is central to the field of
science and engineering and is essential to design new/engineered materials
with specific properties. Assays available for small-molecules, e.g., XRD, NMR,
LC-MS, can't be applied to macromolecules easily. Thus, it is extremely
challenging to characterize complex materials such as adeno-associated virus
capsids (MW 5.8MDa). Capsid crystals produced in hanging-drop are characterized
in-situ using cross-polarized light and ex-situ using scanning electron
microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray, and transmission electron microscopy.
Cross-polarized light can be used to identify capsid crystals within a
heterogenous-system of kosmotropic/chaotropic-salt crystals, fibers, dense
solid-phase, opaques crystals. Despite highly-conserved structures, crystal
birefringence suggests that capsids possess serotype-specific structural
differences. SEM demonstrated that crystal-growth occurs by random
2D-nucleation followed by kink-site attachment and/or spread by more 2D-nuclei
and proteinaceous assemblies tend to form semi-crystalline solids appearing as
dense/opaque materials. EDX shows that C, O, and N are present in ratio of
2.33+-0.222:1:0.583+-0.019 for serotypes 5, 8, and 9 and can be an alternative
to protein sequencing-based virus identification. Biological macromolecular
assemblies are found to facilitate plural-scattering responsible for
Kikuchi-diffraction pattern even for thin-crystals (~300nm). For an optimal
spot-diffraction, crystals must possess at least one dimension consisting of at
most 8 layers of capsids.

### Large circular dichroism in the total photoemission yield of free chiral nanoparticles created by a pure electric dipole effect

- **TL;DR**: 本文提出了一种将光电子圆二色性(PECD)效应转化为总光电离产率的方法，通过亚微米凝聚样品中光的衰减实现手性不对称检测，无需高真空系统和电子谱仪。

Spectroscopic techniques that are sensitive to molecular chirality are
important analytical tools to quantitatively determine enantiomeric excess and
purity of chiral molecular samples. Many chiroptical processes however produce
weak enantio-specific asymmetries due to their origin relying on weak magnetic
dipole or electric quadrupole effects. Photoelectron circular dichroism (PECD)
in contrast, is an intense effect, that is fully contained in the electric
dipole description of light matter interaction and creates a chiral asymmetry
in the photoelectron angular distribution. Here, we demonstrate that this
chiral signature in the angular distribution of emitted electrons can be
translated into the total photoionization yield for submicron-sized condensed
samples. The resulting chiral asymmetry of the photoionization yield (CAPY),
mediated by the attenuation of light within the particles, can be detected
experimentally without requiring high vacuum systems and electron
spectrometers. This effect can be exploited as an analytical tool with high
sensitivity to chirality and enantiopurity for studies of chiral organic and
hybrid submicron particles in environmental, biomedical or catalytic
applications.

### SHarmonic: A fast and accurate implementation of spherical harmonics for electronic-structure calculations

- **Authors**: Xavier Andrade, Jacopo Simoni, Yuan Ping, Tadashi Ogitsu, Alfredo A. Correa
- **Categories**: physics.comp-ph, cond-mat.other, cs.MS, physics.chem-ph
- **TL;DR**: SHarmonic是一个针对电子结构计算优化的球谐函数新实现，使用归一化笛卡尔坐标的显式公式，计算效率比其他实现高至少一个数量级，支持GPU运行可再提升一个数量级速度。

The authors present SHarmonic, a new implementation of the spherical
harmonics targeted for electronic-structure calculations. Their approach is to
use explicit formulas for the harmonics written in terms of normalized
Cartesian coordinates. This approach results in a code that is as precise as
other implementations while being at least one order of magnitude more
computationally efficient. The library can run on graphics processing units
(GPUs) as well, achieving an additional order of magnitude in execution speed.
This new implementation is simple to use and is provided under an open source
license, it can be readily used by other codes to avoid the error-prone and
cumbersome implementation of the spherical harmonics.

### Superfluid weight in disordered flat-band superconductors as a competition between localization functionals

- **TL;DR**: 在平带超导体中，非磁性无序对超流体重量的影响与常规弱耦合超导体相反，其直接影响通常可忽略不计。

According to Anderson's theorem, the gap of a time-reversal symmetric
weak-coupling superconductor is unaffected by non-magnetic disorder. However,
the superfluid weight (stiffness) is reduced in the disordered limit by a
factor of $\Delta \tau$, a product of the scattering time $\tau$ and the
superconducting order parameter $\Delta$. Here we show that the opposite holds
true in flat-band superconductors. While non-magnetic disorder does reduce the
order parameter, we find that its direct effect on superfluid weight is mostly
negligible. We show analytically that the effect of disorder is to lowest order
given in terms of the difference between the intraband and interband parts of
the localization functional of impurity wavefunctions, finding it to be
typically vanishing.

### Variational and field-theoretical approach to exciton-exciton interactions and biexcitons in semiconductors

- **TL;DR**: 本文开发了一种研究激子-激子相互作用的变分方法，获得了基态激子间的有效相互作用势，并将其推广到任意质量体系。该结果可视为Heitler-London势的广义化，并包含了范德瓦尔斯修正。

Bound electron-hole pairs in semiconductors known as excitons are the subject
of intense research due to their potential for optoelectronic devices and
applications, especially in the realm of two-dimensional materials. While the
properties of free excitons in these systems are well understood, a general
description of their interactions is complicated due to their composite nature,
which leads to exchange between the identical fermions of different excitons.
In this work we employ a variational approach to study interactions between
Wannier excitons and obtain an effective interaction potential between two
ground-state excitons in a system of spin-degenerate electrons and holes. This
potential is in general nonlocal and depends on the coupled spins of the
particles. When particularized to hydrogen-like excitons with a heavy hole, it
becomes local and exactly reproduces the Heitler-London result for two
interacting hydrogen atoms. Thus, our result can be interpreted as a
generalization of the Heitler-London potential to arbitrary masses. Including
corrections due to excited states results in a van der Waals potential at large
distances, which is expected due to the induced dipole-dipole nature of the
interactions. Additionally, we use a path-integral formalism to develop a
many-body theory for a gas of excitons, resulting in an excitonic action that
formally includes many-body interactions between excitons. While in the field
representing the excitons is exactly bosonic, we clarify how the internal
exchange processes arise in the field-theoretical treatment, and show that the
diagrams corresponding to the interactions between excitons align with our
variational calculation when evaluated on shell. Our methods and results lay
the groundwork for a generalized theory of exciton-exciton interactions and
their application to the study of biexciton spectra and correlated excitonic
matter.

### Scalable accuracy gains from postselection in quantum error correcting codes

- **TL;DR**: 本文研究了环面码中逻辑失败率的统计分布，发现在编码相中，逻辑失败主要由指数级罕见综合征引起。通过后选择排除这些罕见综合征模式，可以实现可扩展的精度提升。

Decoding stabilizer codes such as the surface and toric codes involves
evaluating free-energy differences in a disordered statistical mechanics model,
in which the randomness comes from the observed pattern of error syndromes. We
study the statistical distribution of logical failure rates across observed
syndromes in the toric code, and show that, within the coding phase, logical
failures are predominantly caused by exponentially unlikely syndromes.
Therefore, postselecting on not seeing these exponentially unlikely syndrome
patterns offers a scalable accuracy gain. In general, the logical error rate
can be suppressed from $p_f$ to $p_f^b$, where $b \geq 2$ in general; in the
specific case of the toric code with perfect syndrome measurements, we find
numerically that $b = 3.1(1)$. Our arguments apply to general topological
stabilizer codes, and can be extended to more general settings as long as the
decoding failure probability obeys a large deviation principle.

### Vestigial $d$-wave charge-$4e$ Superconductivity from Bidirectional Pair Density Waves
- **arXiv**: [2510.05209](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05209)  ·  [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.05209.pdf)

- **Authors**: Ethan Huecker, Yuxuan Wang
- **Categories**: cond-mat.str-el, cond-mat.supr-con
- **TL;DR**: 该论文分析了二维双向对密度波态熔化导致的残留不稳定性，发现对密度波涨落相互作用在d波通道中有利于中间温度下形成残留电荷-4e超导序，而竞争的电荷密度波残留序由于刚度抑制不会形成。

We analyze the leading vestigial instability due to the melting of a
bidirectional pair-density-wave state in two dimensions. In a previous work by
one of the authors, it was found that the interplay between pair-density-wave
fluctuations with ordering momenta along the $x$ and $y$ directions can provide
a strong attractive interaction for charge-$4e$ superconductivity in the
$d$-wave channel. In this work, we go beyond the artificial large-$M$
mean-field theory previously adopted and compute the phase diagram by
incorporating phase fluctuations of the pair-density-wave order parameters. By
investigating the relevance of various topological defects, we show that the
interaction in the $d$-wave channel, together with the strong anisotropy of
phase fluctuations around the pair-density-wave ordering momenta, favors a
vestigial charge-$4e$ superconducting order at intermediate temperatures. By
contrast, a competing charge-density-wave vestigial order does not develop, due
to the suppression of its stiffness.

### Adaptive Pruning for Increased Robustness and Reduced Computational Overhead in Gaussian Process Accelerated Saddle Point Searches

- **TL;DR**: 该论文提出了一种改进的高斯过程回归方法，通过几何感知的最优传输度量和主动剪枝策略，显著加速高维能量面上的鞍点搜索计算。

Gaussian process (GP) regression provides a strategy for accelerating saddle
point searches on high-dimensional energy surfaces by reducing the number of
times the energy and its derivatives with respect to atomic coordinates need to
be evaluated. The computational overhead in the hyperparameter optimization
can, however, be large and make the approach inefficient. Failures can also
occur if the search ventures too far into regions that are not represented well
enough by the GP model. Here, these challenges are resolved by using
geometry-aware optimal transport measures and an active pruning strategy using
a summation over Wasserstein-1 distances for each atom-type in farthest-point
sampling, selecting a fixed-size subset of geometrically diverse configurations
to avoid rapidly increasing cost of GP updates as more observations are made.
Stability is enhanced by permutation-invariant metric that provides a reliable
trust radius for early-stopping and a logarithmic barrier penalty for the
growth of the signal variance. These physically motivated algorithmic changes
prove their efficacy by reducing to less than a half the mean computational
time on a set of 238 challenging configurations from a previously published
data set of chemical reactions. With these improvements, the GP approach is
established as, a robust and scalable algorithm for accelerating saddle point
searches when the evaluation of the energy and atomic forces requires
significant computational effort.

- **TL;DR**: 本文介绍了对Madgraph5_aMC@NLO生成器中CUDACPP插件的进一步优化，通过将单一大GPU内核拆分为多个小内核来加速矩阵元素计算。

The first production release of the CUDACPP plugin for the Madgraph5_aMC@NLO
generator, which speeds up matrix element (ME) calculations for leading-order
(LO) QCD processes using a data parallel approach on vector CPUs and GPUs, was
delivered in October 2024. This has been described in previous publications by
the team behind that effort. In this paper, I describe my work on some
additional developments providing further optimizations of CUDACPP for GPUs,
which I consider ready for inclusion in a new release of the software. The new
approach mainly consists in splitting the calculation of the ME, which has been
so far performed using a single large GPU kernel, into several smaller kernels.
I also take this opportunity to describe more in detail some features of the
CUDACPP software that are relevant to these new developments and that have not
yet been documented.

### Quantum oscillations and anisotropic magnetoresistance in the quasi-two-dimensional Dirac nodal line superconductor $\mathrm{YbSb_2}$

- **TL;DR**: YbSb2是一种准二维I型超导体，在正常状态下是狄拉克节线半金属，为探索能带拓扑与超导性相互作用提供了候选材料平台。

Recent interest in quantum materials has focused on systems exhibiting both
superconductivity and non-trivial band topology as material candidates to
realize topological or unconventional superconducting states. So far,
superconductivity in most topological materials has been identified as type II.
In this work, we present magnetotransport studies on the quasi-two-dimensional
type I superconductor $\mathrm{YbSb_2}$. Combined ab initio DFT calculations
and quantum oscillation measurements confirm that $\mathrm{YbSb_2}$ is a Dirac
nodal line semimetal in the normal state. The complex Fermi surface morphology
is evidenced by the non-monotonic angular dependence of both the quantum
oscillation amplitude and the magnetoresistance. Our results establish
$\mathrm{YbSb_2}$ as a candidate material platform for exploring the interplay
between band topology and superconductivity.

### Semiconductor Meta-Graphene and Valleytronics

- **TL;DR**: 该论文研究了人工六方氮化硼(AhBN)中的拓扑谷霍尔态，通过纳米图案化打开狄拉克带隙，并验证了域壁态在实验相关无序条件下的鲁棒性。

Nano-patterned semiconductor interfaces offer a versatile platform for
creating quantum metamaterials and exploring novel electronic phenomena. In
this study, we illustrate this concept using artificial graphene--a
metamaterial featuring distinctive properties including Dirac and saddle
points. We demonstrate that introducing additional nano-patterning can open a
Dirac band gap, giving rise to what we term artificial hexagonal boron nitride
(AhBN). The calculated valley Chern number of AhBN indicates the presence of
topological valley Hall states confined to Dirac-gap domain walls. A key
question is whether these one-dimensional edge states are topologically
protected against disorder, given their vulnerability to Anderson localization.
To this end, we perform band structure and electronic transport simulations
under experimentally relevant disorder, including charge puddles and geometric
imperfections. Our results reveal the resilience of the domain wall states
against typical experimental disorder, particularly while the AhBN band gap
remains open. The localization length along the domain wall can reach several
microns--several times longer than the bulk electron mean free path--even
though the number of bulk transport channels is greater. To enhance the
effectiveness of the low-dissipation domain wall channel, we propose ribbon
geometries with a large length-to-width ratio. These findings underscore both
the potential and challenges of AhBN for low-energy, power-efficient
microelectronic applications.

### Exact Quench Dynamics from Thermal Pure Quantum States

- **TL;DR**: 在可积的spin-1/2 XX链中，从热纯量子态出发的量子淬火展现出通向热化的新相干路径，系统热化到正则吉布斯系综，但纠缠动力学高度非平凡，呈现"双平台"结构。

We present an exact solution for a quantum quench in an integrable system
that reveals a new, coherent pathway to thermalization. In chaotic systems,
thermalization is understood via the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis
(ETH), which implies that a quench from a thermal pure quantum (TPQ) state
should exhibit trivial dynamics. In contrast, integrable systems are expected
to retain memory of their initial conditions in a non-thermal generalized Gibbs
ensemble (GGE). We show that a quench from a TPQ state in the integrable
spin-1/2 XX chain defies both expectations. The system thermalizes to a
canonical Gibbs ensemble, yet the entanglement dynamics are highly non-trivial,
exhibiting a "double plateau" structure. We solve this process exactly using
techniques in two-dimensional (2D) conformal field theories (CFT), an exact
numerical method based on the matrix Riccati equation, and an asymptotically
exact quasiparticle picture. We prove that the non-trivial dynamics are the
macroscopic signature of the coherent dephasing of the initial state's
anomalous pairing correlations.

### Spin-spiral instability of the Nagaoka ferromagnet in the crossover between square and triangular lattices

- **TL;DR**: 研究方晶格和三角晶格之间的费米-哈伯德模型，发现在单空穴情况下，方晶格产生铁磁序，三角晶格产生120度螺旋序，两者之间存在相变点。

We study the hard-core Fermi-Hubbard model in the crossover between square
and triangular lattices near half-filling. As was recognized by Nagaoka in the
1960s, on the square lattice the presence of a single hole leads to
ferromagnetic spin ordering. On the triangular lattice, geometric frustration
instead leads to a spin-singlet ground state, which can be associated with a
120-degree spiral order. On lattices which interpolate between square and
triangular, there is a phase transition at which the ferromagnetic order
becomes unstable to a spin spiral. We model this instability, finding the exact
critical point.

### Connections between Richardson-Gaudin States, Perfect-Pairing, and Pair Coupled-Cluster Theory

- **TL;DR**: 本文探讨了轨道和双电子对波函数框架之间的相互作用，展示了完美配对波函数作为简化BCS哈密顿量的特征向量，并开发了结合强相关和弱相关处理的混合方法。

Slater determinants underpin most electronic structure methods, but
orbital-based approaches often struggle to describe strong correlation
efficiently. Geminal-based theories, by contrast, naturally capture static
correlation in bond-breaking and multireference problems, though at the expense
of implementation complexity and limited treatment of dynamic effects. In this
work, we examine the interplay between orbital and geminal frameworks, focusing
on perfect-pairing (PP) wavefunctions and their relation to pair
coupled-cluster doubles (pCCD) and Richardson-Gaudin (RG) states. We show that
PP arises as an eigenvector of a simplified reduced Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer
(BCS) Hamiltonian expressed in bonding/antibonding orbital pairs, with the
complementary eigenvectors enabling a systematic treatment of weak correlation.
Second-order Epstein-Nesbet perturbation theory on top of PP is found to yield
energies nearly equivalent to pCCD. These results clarify the role of
pair-based ans\"atze and open avenues for hybrid approaches that combine the
strengths of orbital- and geminal-based methods.

machine-learning methods that are transforming chemistry and materials science,

performance with Python's accessibility, offers easy deployment on GPUs, and
supports automatic differentiation. We outline the modular design of msmJAX,
enabling users to adapt or extend the code, and present benchmarks and
examples, including a verification of linear scaling, and demonstrations of its
stability in molecular-dynamics simulations.

We explore the molecular beam epitaxy synthesis of superconducting aluminum
thin films grown on c-plane sapphire substrates at cryogenic temperatures of 6

demonstrate that cryogenic growth increases structural disorder, producing
crystalline grains that modify the optical, electrical, and superconducting
properties of aluminum. We observe that cryogenic deposition changes the color
of aluminum from fully reflective to yellow and correlate the pseudo-dielectric
function and reflectance with structural changes in the film. We find that
smaller grain sizes enhance the superconductivity of aluminum, increasing its
critical temperature and critical field. We then estimate the superconducting
gap and coherence length of Cooper pairs in aluminum in the presence of
disorder. Finally, we fabricate superconducting microwave resonators on these
films and find that, independently of the growth temperature, the system is
dominated by two-level system loss with similar quality factors in the high and
low power regimes. We further measure a higher kinetic inductance in the
cryogenically grown films.

Strong interactions in Landau flat bands are known to stabilize correlated
states that do not form in other types of flat bands. We report hallmarks of
topological protection at the Landau level filling factor v=7/11 in a
two-dimensional electron system. The $\nu=7/11$ filling factor is the
particle-hole conjugate of $\nu=4/11$, a filling factor intensely studied for
the possibility of realizing unconventional electronic correlations. Our data
establishes a new instance for an unusual fractional quantum Hall state and
opens up possibilities for the study of unconventional correlations in an
enlarged parameter space. We report and discuss transport signatures developing
at other filling factors of interest $\nu= 11/17$, $5/8$, and $8/13$, which
however in our sample do not exhibit topological protection.

Electron-photon hybrid systems serve as ideal light-matter interfaces with
broad applications in quantum technologies. These systems are typically
operated dynamically under nonequilibrium conditions, giving rise to coupled
electronic and photonic currents. Understanding the joint fluctuation behavior
of these currents is essential for assessing the performance of light-matter
interfaces that rely on electron-photon correlations. Here, we investigate the
full counting statistics of coupled electronic and photonic currents in an
experimentally feasible hybrid system composed of a double quantum dot coupled
to an optical cavity. We employ the framework of quantum Lindblad master
equation which is augmented with both electronic and photonic counting fields
to derive their joint cumulant generating function--a treatment that differs
significantly from existing studies, which typically focus on either electron
or photon statistics separately. We reveal that the ratio between photonic and
electronic currents, as well as their variances, can deviate from an expected
quadratic scaling law in the large electron-photon coupling regime.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that conventional modelings of photonic dissipation
channels in quantum master equations must be modified to ensure that the joint
cumulant generating function satisfies the fluctuation symmetry enforced by the
fluctuation theorem. Our results advance the understanding of joint fluctuation
behaviors in electron-photon hybrid systems and may inform the design of
efficient quantum light-matter interfaces.

We introduce TeMFpy, a Python library for converting fermionic mean-field
states to finite or infinite matrix product state (MPS) form. TeMFpy includes
new, efficient, and easy-to-understand algorithms for both Slater determinants
and Pfaffian states. Together with Gutzwiller projection, these also allow the
user to build variational wave functions for various strongly correlated
electron systems, such as quantum spin liquids. We present all implemented
algorithms in detail and describe how they can be accessed through TeMFpy,
including full example workflows. TeMFpy is built on top of TeNPy and,
therefore, integrates seamlessly with existing MPS-based algorithms.

### Tunable electronic energy level alignment and exciton diversity in organic-inorganic van der Waals heterostructures

van der Waals stacking of two-dimensional (2D) materials offers a powerful
platform for engineering material interfaces with tailored electronic and
optical properties. While most van der Waals multilayers have featured
inorganic monolayers, incorporating molecular monolayers introduces new degrees
of tunability and functionality. Here, we investigate hybrid bilayers composed
of atomically thin perylene-based molecular crystals interfaced with monolayer
transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), specifically MoS2 and WS2. Using ab
initio many-body perturbation theory within the GW approximation and the
Bethe-Salpeter equation approach, we predict emergent properties beyond those
of the isolated constituent systems. Notably, we find substantial
renormalization of monolayer molecular crystal band gap due to TMD-induced
polarization. Furthermore, by varying the TMD monolayer, we demonstrate tuning
of the energy level alignment of the bilayer and subsequent control over a
diversity of lowest-energy excitons, which include strongly bound hybrid
excitons and long-lived charge-transfer excitons. These findings establish
organic-inorganic van der Waals heterostructures as a promising class of
materials for tunable optoelectronic devices and quantum excitonic phenomena,
expanding the design space for low-dimensional systems.

### Signatures of superconducting Higgs mode in irradiated Josephson junctions

The Higgs mode, originally proposed in the context of superconductivity,
corresponds to oscillations of the amplitude of the superconducting order
parameter. Recent THz-domain optical studies have found signatures consistent
with the Higgs mode, but its unambiguous detection is still challenging. We
predict that the existence of the Higgs mode can be unambiguously revealed by
standard measurements of the transport characteristics in microwave-irradiated
asymmetric and transparent Josephson junctions. One signature of the Higgs mode
in a Josephson junction is the microwave-induced enhancement of the second
harmonic of the equilibrium current-phase relation (at zero DC bias voltage),
whose sign differs from its expected value in the absence of the Higgs mode. As
the radiation frequency is varied, this enhancement exhibits resonant behavior
when the microwave frequency is tuned across the Higgs mass. The second
signature that we propose is the enhancement of the second harmonic of the AC
Josephson current at finite DC voltage bias, which can be probed in a customary
analysis of the Shapiro steps in a microwave-irradiated junction.

### Switchable spin-photon coupling with hole spins in single-quantum dots

Spin qubits in semiconductor quantum dots offer a gate-tunable platform for
quantum information processing. While two-qubit interactions are typically
realized through exchange coupling between neighboring spins, coupling spin
qubits to photons via hybrid spin-cQED devices enables long-range interactions
and integration with other cQED platforms. Here, we investigate hole
spin-photon coupling in compact single quantum dot setups. By incorporating
ubiquitous strain inhomogeneities to our theory, we identify three main
spin-photon coupling channels: a vector-potential-spin-orbit geometric
mechanism--dominant for vertical magnetic fields--, an inhomogeneous Rashba
term generalizing previous spin-orbit field models, and strain-induced
$g$-tensor terms--most relevant for in-plane fields. Comparing Si, unstrained
(relaxed) Ge, and biaxially strained Ge wells, we find that Si and unstrained
Ge provide optimal coupling strengths (tens of MHz) thanks to their reduced
heavy-hole, light-hole splitting. We demonstrate efficient switching of the
spin-photon coupling while preserving sweet spot operation. Finally, we
evaluate quantum state transfer and two-qubit gate protocols, achieving $&gt;99\%$
fidelity for state transfer and $&gt;90\%$ for two-qubit gates with realistic
coherence times, establishing single-dot hole spins as a viable platform for
compact spin-cQED architectures and highlighting unstrained Ge as a promising
candidate for spin-photon interactions.

### Full Eigenstate Thermalization in Integrable Spin Systems

- **TL;DR**: 本文通过数值模拟测试了全ETH对高阶关联函数的预测，发现在可积自旋模型中，四阶自由累积量虽然编码了OTOC动力学，但表现出与非可积系统不同的晚期动力学行为。

The Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis(ETH) is a standard tool to
understand the thermalization properties of an isolated quantum system. Its
generalization to higher order correlations of matrix elements of local
operators, dubbed the full ETH, predicts the decomposition of higher-order
correlation function into thermal free cumulants. In this work, we numerically
test these predictions of full ETH using exact diagonalization of two spin
models: the Ising and the XXZ Heisenberg models. The differences from the
behavior of full ETH prediction in chaotic systems are highlighted and
contrasted along the way. We also show that although in these integrable spin
models the dynamics of the four-time correlators, specifically the
out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC), is encoded in the fourth order free
cumulant, it exhibits late-time dynamics that is different from nonintegrable
systems.

The presence of a boundary enriches the nature of quantum phase transitions.
However, the boundary critical phenomena in topological superconductors remain
underexplored so far. Here, we investigate the boundary criticality in a
two-dimensional correlated time-reversal-invariant topological superconductor
tuned through a quantum phase transition into a trivial time-reversal-breaking
superconductor. Using sign-problem-free determinant quantum Monte Carlo
simulations, we chart the quantum phase diagram and reveal the boundary
criticalities encompassing ordinary, special, and extraordinary transitions.
Additionally, using renormalization group analysis, we compute the boundary
critical exponent up to two loops. Remarkably, the simulations and two-loop
renormalization group calculations consistently demonstrate that the presence
of the boundary Majorana fermion at the special transition gives rise to a new
type of boundary Gross-Neveu-Yukawa fixed point. We conclude with a discussion
of possible experimental realizations in iron-based superconductors.

A Berry phase of odd multiples of $\pi$ inferred from quantum oscillations
(QOs) has often been treated as evidence for nontrivial reciprocal space
topology. However, disentangling the Berry phase values from the Zeeman effect
and the orbital magnetic moment is often challenging. In centrosymmetric
compounds, the case is simpler as the orbital magnetic moment contribution is
negligible. Although the Zeeman effect can be significant, it is usually
overlooked in most studies of QOs in centrosymmetric compounds. Here, we
present a detailed study on the non-magnetic centrosymmetric $\mathrm{SrGa_2}$
and $\mathrm{BaGa_2}$, which are predicted to be Dirac nodal line semimetals
(DNLSs) based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Evidence of the
nontrivial topology is found in magnetotransport measurements. The Fermi
surface topology and band structure are carefully studied through a combination
of angle-dependent QOs, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), and
DFT calculations, where the nodal line is observed in the vicinity of the Fermi
level. Strong de Haas-van Alphen fundamental oscillations associated with
higher harmonics are observed in both compounds, which are well-fitted by the
Lifshitz-Kosevich (LK) formula. However, even with the inclusion of higher
harmonics in the fitting, we found that the Berry phases cannot be
unambiguously determined when the Zeeman effect is included. We revisit the LK
formula and analyze the phenomena and outcomes that were associated with the
Zeeman effect in previous studies. Our experimental results confirm that
$\mathrm{SrGa_2}$ and $\mathrm{BaGa_2}$ are Dirac nodal line semimetals.
Additionally, we highlight the often overlooked role of spin-damping terms in
Berry phase analysis.

with recovery times and timing jitter of about 8 ns and 28 ps, respectively.

work, we present the analytical expressions estimating the critical properties

were obtained within the framework of the m-vicinity method. The accuracy of
the critical temperature estimations was evaluated through comparison with
Monte Carlo simulations. Special attention was given to the case when the model
consists of two interacting interpenetrating homogeneous sublattices, and
relationships for the compositional dependence of the critical temperature were
derived.

### Emergence of nematic loop-current bond order in vanadium Kagome metals

The family of layered Kagome metals $\mathrm{A}\mathrm{V}_3\mathrm{Sb}_5$
$(\mathrm{A}=\mathrm{K,Rb,Cs})$ has recently attracted significant interest due
to reports of charge-bond order, orbital magnetism, and superconductivity. Some
of these phases may exhibit time-reversal symmetry breaking, as suggested by
their response to magnetic fields. More recently, experiments have reported the
emergence of nematic order that lowers the rotational symmetry of the system
from sixfold to twofold. Here we investigate the mechanism behind a nematic
phase that breaks both rotational and time-reversal symmetries. Starting from a
nine-band tight-binding model and nearest-neighbour Coulomb interactions, we
find nematic order to emerge in a narrow region of phase space within
mean-field theory. The nematic state is a superposition of charge-bond order
along one Kagome bond and loop-current order on the other two, preserving one
of the three mirror planes. To understand this behaviour, we examine an
effective patch model that captures one $p$-type and one $m$-type van Hove
singularity at each $M$ point on the Brillouin zone boundary. Within the
effective model, nematic order is stabilized by the coupling between the
complex phases of the three bond order parameters. As a consequence, the
nematic phase develops an elongated Fermi surface distinct from those of
competing phases.

La$_{1-x}$Sr$_{x}$CoO3-$\delta$ is a promising off-stoichiometric metal oxide
that undergoes a topotactic perovskite ($\delta$ = 0) to brownmillerite
($\delta$ = 0.5) transition under electrochemical and thermochemical stimuli,
with concomitant variations in its electrical, magnetic, thermal, and optical
properties. Recent studies on thin-film cycling in electrochemical devices show
incomplete reversibility of this transition, with significant acid-etching
serving as a degradation mechanism. While earlier investigations examined the
protonation of brownmillerite SrCoO2.5, the thermodynamics of protonation
across the perovskite-to-brownmillerite transition remain poorly understood. In
this work, we combine density functional theory calculations with predictions
from universal machine-learning interatomic potentials to elucidate the
energetics and implications of protonation across the transition for
La0.5Sr0.5CoO3-$\delta$. These calculations reveal negative hydrogen insertion
energies and strong competition with oxygen vacancy formation across the
transition for a wide range of conditions. The extent of protonation is
primarily limited by the availability of Co 3d states to accommodate reduction
by inserted hydrogen. Although hydrogen insertion is often thermodynamically
favorable within a defect picture, a convex hull analysis of the resulting
HyLa0.5Sr0.5CoO3-$\delta$ phases reveals them to be unstable against
decomposition into hydroxides among other products. This instability increases
with hydrogen content and provides a thermodynamic basis for the acid-etching
observed during electrochemical cycling. This work advances the fundamental
understanding of protonation in La0.5Sr0.5CoO3-$\delta$ and contextualizes
experimental observations of related materials in the presence of moisture or
H2.

Time-resolved and ultrafast electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) is an
emerging technique for measuring photoexcited carriers, lattice dynamics, and
near-fields across femtosecond to microsecond timescales. When performed in
either a specialized scanning transmission electron microscope or ultrafast
electron microscope (UEM), time-resolved and ultrafast EELS can directly image
charge carriers, lattice vibrations, and heat dissipation following
photoexcitation or applied bias. Yet recent advances in theoretical
calculations and electron optics are often required to realize the full
potential of ultrafast EEL spectrum imaging. In this review, we present a
comprehensive overview of the recent progress in the theory and instrumentation
of time-resolved and ultrafast EELS. We begin with an introduction to the
technique, followed by a physical description of the loss function. We outline
approaches for calculating and interpreting ground-state and transient EEL
spectra spanning low-loss plasmons to core-level excitations analogous to X-ray
absorption. We then survey the current state of time-resolved and ultrafast
EELS techniques beyond photon-induced near-field electron microscopy,
highlighting abilities to image carrier and thermal dynamics. Finally, we
examine future directions enabled by emerging technologies, including electron
beam monochromation, in situ and operando cells, laser-free UEM, and high-speed
direct electron detectors. These advances position time-resolved and ultrafast
EELS as a critical tool for uncovering nanoscale dynamic processes in quantum
materials and solar energy conversion devices.

We present the first computational framework for molecular dynamics
simulation of MoS2 doped with 25 elements spanning metals, non-metals, and
transition metals using Meta's Universal Model for Atoms machine learning
interatomic potential (MLIP). Benchmarking against density functional theory
calculations demonstrates the accuracy of the MLIP for simulating doped-MoS2
systems and highlights opportunities for improvement. Using the MLIP, we
perform heating-cooling simulations of doped-MoS2 supercells. The simulations
capture complex phenomena including dopant clustering, MoS2 layer fracturing,
interlayer diffusion, and chemical compound formation at orders-of-magnitude
reduced computational cost compared to density functional theory. This work
provides an open-source computational workflow for application-oriented design
of doped-MoS2, enabling high-throughput screening of dopant candidates and
optimization of compositions for targeted tribological, electronic, and
optoelectronic performance. The MLIP bridges the accuracy-efficiency gap
between first-principles methods and empirical potentials, and the framework
offers unprecedented opportunities for large-scale materials discovery in
two-dimensional doped material systems.

We study the Josephson effect in junctions composed of two ferromagnetic
insulator/diffusive superconductor bilayers separated by an insulating barrier.
By computing the free energy of the system, we identify two distinct
contributions: (i) The work performed by a current source to create a
supercurrent through the junction, and (ii) an antiferromagnetic coupling
between ferromagnetic insulators, mediated by the superconducting condensate
across the insulating barrier. The competition between these contributions
allows for switching between parallel and antiparallel configurations of the
magnetizations of the ferromagnetic insulators. We explicitly show that the
switching occurs at finite temperatures and for superconducting phase
differences satisfying $\pi/2 &lt; \phi &lt; 3\pi/2$. Importantly, this effect can be
realized in ferromagnetic insulators with sufficiently large easy-plane
anisotropy energy. Using realistic junction parameters, we demonstrate that the
switching can be controlled by phase bias and triggered by half-flux-quantum
voltage pulses or external magnetic field pulses on the microsecond timescale.
These results provide a route towards controllable Josephson-based

- **TL;DR**: 研究热诱导原子运动对粗糙表面铜薄膜电子传输的影响，发现温度升高会增加原始薄膜的电阻，但对粗糙薄膜影响较小，因为表面粗糙度本身是主要电阻来源。

Decrease in the size of integrated circuits (IC) and metal interconnects
raise resistivity due the amplification of electron scattering effects, which
decreases the efficiency of chiplets. While previous studies have investigated
the electron scattering due to a roughened surface, the effect of thermal
induced atomic motion on the roughened surface remains unclear. To address this
gap, we investigated electron transport in pristine and roughened Cu thin films
by performing \textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics (AIMD) trajectories over
20~ps at temperatures of 218~K, 300~K, and 540~K on Cu thin film models, and
then calculating the electron transport properties of the resulting snapshots
at 100-fs intervals for the last 10~ps using the non-equilibrium Green's
function formalism in combination with density functional theory (NEGF-DFT). As
expected, higher temperatures induce larger atomic displacement from their
equilibrium positions and increase atomic layer separation. We also find that
increase in temperature results in increased resistance (lower conductance) for
the pristine film, but less so for the roughened thin film where the surface
roughness itself is the main source of resistance. This study provides insights
into how pristine and roughened Cu thin films behave under thermal conditions,
helping researchers design better treatments to mitigate thermal effects in ICs
and their metal interconnects.

- **TL;DR**: 本研究通过CVF水模型揭示水合环境对SOD1蛋白在生物分子凝聚体中的行为具有关键影响，修正了OPEP隐式溶剂模型的结论，发现BSA拥挤剂降低SOD1分配系数的主要驱动力是水合熵行为而非非特异性相互作用。

Biological processes like the sequestration of Superoxide Dismutase 1 (SOD1)
into biomolecular condensates such as FUS and stress granules are essential to
understanding disease mechanisms, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
(ALS). Our study demonstrates that the hydration environment is crucial in
these processes. Using the advanced CVF water model, which captures
hydrogen-bond networks at the molecular level, we show how water greatly
impacts SOD1's behavior, residency times, and transition rates between
different associative states. Importantly, when water is included to hydrate an
implicit solvent model (OPEP), we gain a new perspective on the free energy
landscape of the system, leading to a conclusion that clarifies that suggested
by OPEP alone. While the OPEP model indicated that Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA)
crowders reduce SOD1's partition coefficient (PC) mainly due to nonspecific
interactions with BSA, our enhanced explicit-water approach reveals that the
hydration entropy behavior in BSA drives the observed decrease in PC. This
highlights that explicitly modeling water is essential for accurately
understanding protein-crowder interactions and their biological relevance,
emphasizing water's role in cellular phase separation and disease-related
processes.

### Liquid-gas analog multicriticality in a frustrated Ising bilayer

- **TL;DR**: 发现了一个多临界点，将液-气范式扩展到具有竞争对称性破缺序的系统，展现了涌现对称性和多临界性的普遍机制。

We report the discovery of a multicritical point that extends the liquid-gas
paradigm to systems with competing symmetry-breaking orders. Using large-scale
Monte Carlo simulations of a frustrated bilayer Ising antiferromagnet with
tunable couplings, we map out a rich finite-temperature phase diagram hosting
three ordered phases separated by both continuous and first-order transitions.
By tuning the couplings, a tricritical line and a critical end-point line
converge into a single multicritical line. At all points along the
multicritical line, symmetry-distinct phases exhibit identical leading critical
behavior -- consistent with the tricritical Ising universality class -- while
the subleading exponent exhibits a sharp shift from $y_g = 0.8$ to $y_g = 1$.
This shift reflects an emergent $Z_2$ symmetry akin to that of the liquid-gas
critical point, but realized here at a genuine multicritical point involving
simultaneous microscopic symmetry breaking. Our results establish a
universality scenario in which emergent symmetry preserves the leading class
but reorganizes subleading scaling, providing a general mechanism for
symmetry-enforced multicriticality.

### Cation vacancies mediate thermochemical water splitting with iron aluminates

- **TL;DR**: 该研究发现铁铝尖晶石中的阳离子空位通过位点反转机制变得热力学可行，从而支持太阳能热化学水分解通过阳离子空位机制进行，解释了实验观察到的氢气高产率。

Solar thermochemical water splitting enables hydrogen production by cycling
metal oxides between reduced and oxidized states, typically through an oxygen
vacancy mechanism. However, recent experimental work suggests that cation
vacancies have a greater influence on the redox behavior of iron aluminate
spinels used in water splitting. This remains debated, as calculations predict
that such cation vacancies are thermodynamically unfavorable. In the current
work, we show that Fe vacancies in (Fe$\zeta$Al1-$\zeta$)3O4 become accessible
only when facilitated by inversion between Fe and Al. This antisite disorder
lowers the formation energy of octahedral Fe vacancies in Al-rich spinels
($\zeta$ = 1/3) from over 3 eV to just 0.62 eV when one third of the cation
sites are inverted, allowing high Fe vacancy concentrations under oxidizing
conditions. This mechanism supports high H2 yields up to 361 $\mu$mol/g,
consistent with experimental observations. Our findings support the notion that
solar thermochemical water splitting can occur through a cation vacancy
mechanism. They also clarify how site inversion, vacancy energetics, and defect
interactions each contribute to redox performance, offering general design
principles for identifying and optimizing materials that operate through cation
vacancy cycling.

- **TL;DR**: 通过无溶剂共蒸发法制备的FASnI3钙钛矿薄膜具有高结晶度、1.31eV带隙，且Sn2+氧化和自掺杂倾向显著降低，缺陷形成抗性提高。

Co-evaporation of formamidinium tin triiodide (FASnI3) precursors, without
any additives or reducing agents, leads to the growth of a highly crystalline
thin film which shows a bandgap around 1.31 eV, closely matching the
theoretical value predicted from the ideal single crystal structure of FASnI3.
The polycrystalline thin film presents a lower tendency of Sn2+ to Sn4+
oxidation and highly reduced tendency to self-doping, demonstrating, overall,
an improved resistance to defects formation. These findings suggest
solvent-free co-evaporation processes as a promising route for high quality
Sn-based perovskite polycrystalline thin films.

### Probing orbital currents through inverse orbital Hall and Rashba effects

We report a comprehensive experimental investigation of orbital-to-charge
conversion in metallic and semiconductor materials, emphasizing the fundamental
roles of the inverse orbital Hall effect (IOHE) and the inverse orbital Rashba
effect. Using spin pumping driven by ferromagnetic resonance (SP-FMR) and the
spin Seebeck effect (SSE), we demonstrate efficient orbital current generation
and detection in YIG/Pt/NM structures, where NM is either a metal or a
semiconductor. A central finding is the dominance of orbital contributions over
spin-related effects, even in systems with weak spin-orbit coupling. In
particular, a large enhancement of the SP-FMR and SSE signals is observed in
the presence of naturally oxidized Cu in different heterostructures.
Furthermore, we identify positive and negative IOHE signals in Ti and Ge,
respectively, and extract orbital diffusion lengths in both systems using a
diffusive model. Our results confirm the presence of orbital transport and
offer valuable insights that may guide the further development of orbitronics.

### Hidden phonon-assisted charge density wave transition in BaFe2Al9 revealed by ultrafast optical spectroscopy

- **TL;DR**: 通过超快光学光谱研究BaFe2Al9中的电荷密度波(CDW)转变，发现一阶相变证据和1.6 THz相干振荡模式，表明CDW由电子-晶格不稳定性共同驱动。

The interplay between electronic and lattice degrees of freedom is
fundamental to charge density wave (CDW) formation, yet the microscopic origin
often remains elusive. Here, we investigate the transient optical response of
the intermetallic compound BaFe2Al9 using polarization-resolved ultrafast
optical spectroscopy. We identify a discontinuous sign reversal in the
transient reflectivity at Tc ~ 110 K, providing unambiguous evidence for the
first-order transition. The anisotropic quasiparticle relaxation establishes
the three-dimensional nature of the ordered state. Below Tc, a single coherent
1.6 THz oscillation appears abruptly and remains confined to the CDW phase.
This mode exhibits weak temperature dependence with negligible softening and is
absent in Raman spectra. First-principles calculations imply that it is a
precursor phonon at the CDW wave vector with strong electron-phonon coupling.
Our results indicate that the CDW in BaFe2Al9 arises from intertwined
electronic and lattice instabilities, assisted by a displacive mechanism
mediated by a hidden strongly coupled phonon, distinct from conventional
amplitude-mode softening scenarios.

Expanding the spectrum of 3D magnetic nanostructures requires mastering the
interplay between different anisotropy contributions. Here, we fabricate
bisegmented jellyfish nanowires with tailored arrangements of Co (strong
magnetocrystalline anisotropy) and Ni (dominant shape anisotropy) segments. We
uncover a unique magnetic duality: Co segments can be tuned to exhibit either a
flux-closing multidomain state or a shape-anisotropy-dominated vortex
configuration, directly governed by their geometry. This local domain
structure, imaged by MFM and simulated micromagnetically, dictates the global
magnetic response-suppressing magnetostatic interactions in arrays and enabling
the programming of the anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) in single nanowires.
Our work provides a blueprint for designing functional magnetic nanomaterials
where magnetoresistive properties are engineered through strategic anisotropy
control.

### Metastability of the Topological Magnetic Orders in the Chiral Antiferromagnet EuPtSi

- **TL;DR**: EuPtSi中的斯格明子晶格态可以通过场冷却扩展到极低温度（低于0.1K），表现出拓扑稳定性和热扰动竞争导致的亚稳态量子斯格明子态。

We report resistivity and Hall effect measurements in the chiral
antiferromagnet EuPtSi. Depending on the magnetic field orientation with
respect to the crystallographic axes, EuPtSi presents different topological
magnetic phases below the N\'eel temperature $T_N=4.05$K. In particular, for a
field $H \parallel $ [111], it exhibits the well known skyrmion lattice A-phase
inside the conical phase between $T=0.45$K and $T_N$ in the field range from
0.8T to 1.4T. Remarkably, the skyrmion lattice state in EuPtSi, composed of
nanoscale skyrmions, can be extended down to very low temperature (lower than
0.1K) through field-cooling regardless of the cooling rate and of the magnetic
history. Similarly the metastability of the A'- and B-phases ($H \parallel $
[100]) at low temperature is evidenced by our measurements. These results
suggest that EuPtSi is a peculiar example where the competition between the
topological stability and the thermal agitation can lead to metastable quantum
skyrmion state.

### Photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy of quantum wire-like dislocation states in ZnS

- **TL;DR**: 该研究通过实验验证了ZnS半导体中位错核心存在一维电子能带的理论预测，发现这些位错能带会产生高效的带间辐射跃迁，与传统的非辐射深能级缺陷不同。

Recent \textit{ab initio} calculations predict 1D dispersive electronic bands
confined to the atomic scale cores of dislocations in the wide bandgap (3.84
eV) semiconductor ZnS. We test these predictions by correlating sub-bandgap
optical transitions with the density of dislocations formed during strain
relaxation in epitaxial ZnS grown on GaP. The densities for four predicted
partial dislocations are quantified using scanning electron microscopy-based
electron channeling contrast imaging. Room-temperature ellipsometry reveals
absorption peaks that scale with dislocation density and align with theoretical
predictions. Low-temperature photoluminescence spectra show deep emission peaks
matching dislocation 1D band-to-band transitions. Photoluminescence excitation
spectroscopy reveals six distinct emission lines with contrasting excitation
dependence. Four peaks (2.78, 2.41, 2.20, 1.88 eV), assigned to dislocations,
exhibit only modest suppression ($\leq$5$\times$) when excited below the ZnS
bandgap, while two other peaks (3.11, 1.53~eV) are strongly quenched
($&gt;$10$\times$). These findings support the existence of efficient, 1D
band-to-band radiative transitions within quantum wire-like dislocation core
states in ZnS, distinct from typical non-radiative deep-level defects in
wide-gap semiconductors.

### Giant and robust Josephson diode effect in multiband topological nanowires

- **TL;DR**: 在准一维拓扑Majorana纳米线的多子带体系中预测了巨大且鲁棒的约瑟夫森二极管效应，揭示了自旋宇称交换机制导致的高效平台效应。

We theoretically predict the giant and robust Josephson diode effect in
quasi-one-dimensional topological Majorana nanowires in the regime with
multiple subbands, which is expected to be relevant for the real experiment. In
the multiband regime, the Majorana bound states and conventional Andreev bound
states can naturally coexist, and respectively contribute to the fractional and
conventional parts in the Josephson effect, with the former/latter having
4$\pi$/2$\pi$-periodicity. We show that the interplay between the two types of
bound modes can produce a robust and giant diode effect in the deep topological
phase regime. Notably, we unveil a novel spin parity exchange mechanism,
occurring only in the multiband regime, which leads to a robust high efficiency
plateau of the giant diode effect. This effect is a nontrivial consequence of
the balanced Fermi moment shifts of the multiple subbands in tuning the
external magnetic field. Our finding highlights the subband engineering as a
powerful tool to optimize the Josephson diode effect realistically and provides
a new feasible signature to identify topological phase regime in
superconducting nanowires.

We investigate an electrical bias-controlled, topological kind discontinuity
in valley polarization, in a two-segment armchair nanoribbon of gapless
graphene, where the discontinuity is created at the interface by applying
opposite in-plane, transverse electrical biases to the two segments. In
particular, using an efficient tight-binding theoretical formulation, we
explicitly obtain energy eigenvalues and probability distributions of
discontinuity-induced, interface-confined electron eigenstates, in a reference
configuration. Moreover, implications of the confinement for electron transport
are explored. A configurational variation is introduced to transform the
eigenstates into transport-active, quasi-localized ones. Such states are shown
to result in Fano "anti-resonances" in transmission spectra. The resilience of
the quasi-localized states and their associated Fano fingerprints is also
illustrated with respect to configurational fluctuations, demonstrating their
potential detectability in realistic devices and suggesting transport
spectroscopy as a practical probe of valley-dependent topological interface
physics in graphene nanoribbons.

### Commensurate-incommensurate Mott transition without magnetic field: emergence of nematic Luttinger liquid in XXZ chain

We investigate the zero-magnetization phase diagram of a spin-1/2 chain with
competing ferromagnetic nearest-neighbor and antiferromagnetic
next-nearest-neighbor exchange couplings in the strongly interacting regime.
Using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we discover two
successive commensurate-incommensurate transitions of the non-conformal
Pokrovsky-Talapov universality class, occurring (even) at zero magnetic field.
The first transition marks the condensation of bound pairs of magnons into a
critical phase with central charge $c=2$, emerging from a gapped period-4
phase. At the second transition, an incommensurate quadrupolar (or nematic)
Luttinger liquid forms out of a gapped phase separation state, via the pairwise
condensation of domain walls. We argue that both transitions involve the same
underlying incommensurate nematic Luttinger liquid, and that the $c=2$ phase
can be understood as a coexistence of a conventional (single-magnon type) and
quadrupolar (two-magnon type) Luttinger liquids. Our results demonstrate that
frustration alone is sufficient to drive continuous commensurate-incommensurate
transitions of Mott type and stabilise incommensurate quasi-long-range order
without doping.

Kagome metals have developed into a vibrant playground for materials physics,
where geometric frustration, electronic correlations and band topology come
together to create a variety of exotic phenomena. Recently synthesized
CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$ has provided a rare opportunity to explore unconventional
superconductivity in a strongly correlated kagome system with hints of
frustrated magnetism and quantum criticality. Using spectroscopic imaging
scanning tunneling microscopy, we reveal a cascade of density wave transitions
with different symmetries in bulk single crystals of CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$. In
particular, we discover a new electronic state $-$ a unidirectional density
wave that breaks all mirror symmetries akin to a chiral density wave, but in
contrast retains a mirror-glide symmetry. We term this state a frieze
charge-stripe order phase, because its symmetry properties agree with one of
the fundamental frieze symmetry groups. A combination of high-resolution
imaging, Fourier analysis and theoretical simulations uncovers the crucial role
of sublattice degrees of freedom in forming this phase, with internal chiral
textures of opposite handedness. Our experiments reveal that superconductivity
in CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$ develops from a new type of a unidirectional density wave,
and set the foundation for exploring electronic states with frieze symmetry
groups in quantum materials.

The chiral central charge $c_-$ is a key topological invariant of the edge
characterizing the bulk two-dimensional chiral topological order, but its
direct evaluation in microscopic spin models has long been a challenge,
especially for non-abelian topological order. Building on the recently
developed modular commutator formalism, we numerically obtain $c_-$ directly
from single ground-state wave functions of two-dimensional interacting spin
models that have chiral topological order. This provides a geometry-independent
and bulk diagnostic of chirality. We study two nonintegrable systems -- the
Zeeman-Kitaev honeycomb model and the kagome antiferromagnet -- both subjected
to scalar spin chirality perturbations. We find that the modular commutator
yields results consistent with the expected topological quantum field theories.
We also compute the topological entanglement entropy which provides an
independent diagnostic of the topological orders. Our work establishes modular
commutators as a powerful numerical probe of chiral topological order in
strongly correlated quantum magnets.

The electronic and optical properties of CdGa2Te4 and ZnGa2Te4 were studied
using first-principles DFT calculations. Band gaps were calculated using the
GGA-PBESol functional. Both materials show promise for photovoltaic
applications because of their large, near-unity absorption efficiencies (10^4
cm^-1) in the visible region. They exhibit low exciton binding energies
(18.85-26.81 meV), large Bohr radii (23-34.3 Angstrom), and moderate exciton
temperatures (218-311 K), which are favorable for photovoltaic applications.
Their performance as solar cells was simulated using the SCAPS-1D tool for
thin-film devices with Pt/CdS/CdGa2Te4/Cu2O/Ti and Pt/CdS/ZnGa2Te4/Cu2O/Ti
structures. We investigated the effects of layer thickness, donor and acceptor
concentrations (shallow donors/acceptors), and defect density on device
performance. The ideal absorber thickness for XGa2Te4 (X = Cd, Zn) was found to
be 1000-1800 nm, and the CdS buffer layer around 150 nm. To obtain an
efficiency above 20%, the defect density in the CdGa2Te4 and ZnGa2Te4 absorber
layers should be kept below 1.772 x 10^13 cm^-3. The best simulations show
efficiencies of 18.46% and 17.35% for CdGa2Te4- and ZnGa2Te4-based solar cells,
respectively.

### Measurement of the Quantum Capacitance Between Two Metallic Electrodes

Two factors contribute to the electrical capacitance between two electrodes:
a classical contribution, stemming from the electric field, and a quantum
contribution, governed by the Pauli exclusion principle, which increases the
difficulty of adding charge to the electrodes. In metals, the high electronic
Density of States (DOS) at the Fermi energy allows the quantum contribution to
be neglected, and a classical description of the electrical capacitance between
two metallic electrodes is normally used. Here, we study the evolution of the
capacitance as two metallic electrodes (Pt or Au) are approached to the limit
when quantum corrections are needed, before contact formation. At small
distances, we observe that the classical increase in capacitance turns into
saturation as the electrodes are approached, reaching the quantum capacitance
limit. Finally, a capacitance leakage due to quantum tunneling is observed.
Since the quantum capacitance depends on the electronic DOS on the surface of

Over the past decade, the field of high-entropy ceramics (HECs) has rapidly
expanded to encompass a wide range of oxides, borides, silicides, and other
ceramic solid solutions. In 2020, we proposed extending the concept of HECs to
compositionally complex ceramics (CCCs), in which non-equimolar compositions
and the presence of long- or short-range order reduce entropy while offering
new opportunities to tailor and enhance properties, often beyond those of
higher-entropy counterparts. Here, fundamental questions arise: Is the entropy
in HECs truly high? Should maximizing entropy always be our goal? This
perspective article revisits key concepts and terminologies and highlights
emerging directions, including dual-phase CCCs, ultrahigh-entropy phases, and
novel processing routes such as ultrafast reactive sintering. We propose that
exploring compositional complexity across vast non-equimolar spaces, together
with correlated disorder (coupled short-range chemical and structural orders),
offers a more effective strategy for designing ceramics with superior
performance than simply maximizing entropy.

Integrating monolayers derived from 2D van der Waals (vdW) magnetic materials
into next-generation technological applications remains a significant challenge
due to their structural and magnetic instability issues. Template-assisted
encapsulation is a potential route for the growth of stable 2D monolayers aimed
at designing novel 1D heterostructures, opening new avenues for studying
low-dimensional quantum effects and spin-related phenomena. In this study, we
explored the diameter-dependent encapsulation of 2D CrI3 crystals using
multi-walled carbon nanotubes as nanoscale host templates. Advanced microscopic
analysis revealed distinct structural transitions, ranging from internal
nanorod encapsulation to external shell formation, directly influenced by the
host nanotube diameter. Furthermore, statistical analysis of structural
morphologies indicates that CrI3 nanorods preferentially form within MWCNTs
with inner diameters up to 5 nm, while single-walled CrI3 nanotubes are
stabilized in CNTs with diameters up to 8 nm. For host CNTs exceeding 10 nm in
diameter, CrI3 predominantly forms surface coatings rather than confined
one-dimensional structures. In situ electron beam irradiation demonstrates the
superior structural stability of single-walled CrI3 confined within MWCNTs,
while externally coated CrI3 undergoes decomposition into metallic Cr clusters.
Prolonged irradiation induces a morphological transformation of CrI3 nanotubes
into nanorods. These insights lay the groundwork for engineering robust,
tunable 1D magnetic heterostructures of CrI3 for spintronic and data storage
applications.

High- and medium-entropy nitride coatings from the Cr-Hf-Mo-Ta-W-N system
were studied using ab initio calculations and experiments to clarify the role
of entropy and individual elements in phase stability, microstructure, and
high-temperature behaviour. Formation energy calculations indicated that
nitrogen vacancies stabilise the cubic (fcc) phase, with hafnium and tantalum
acting as strong stabilisers, while tungsten destabilises the lattice. Coatings
were deposited by reactive magnetron sputtering at approx. 50C (AT) and approx.
580C (HT). All exhibited columnar fcc structures; high-temperature deposition
produced denser coatings, lower nitrogen content, and larger crystallites,
resulting in higher hardness and elastic modulus. Thermal stability was tested
up to 1200C on Si and oxidation at 1400C on sapphire. AT coatings failed early,
while most HT coatings endured. Nitrogen loss less than 10 at.% at 1000C was
critical for survival. TEM revealed tungsten segregation and HfO2 formation,
while fcc nitride remained dominant. Ta enrichment proved essential for
superior thermal and oxidation stability.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究分析了金刚石衬底中平均延迟与厚度的相关性，发现垂直于和平行于生长方向的测量结果存在各向异性，并提出了带动量漂移的二维随机游走模型来模拟这种相关性。

This work studies the correlation between mean retardance and thickness of
diamond substrates grown homoepitaxially via microwave plasma-enhanced chemical
vapor deposition (MPCVD). We measure the retardance of a diamond substrate in
two orientations: perpendicular and parallel to the growth direction. Our
experimental results demonstrate that the correlation between mean retardance
and thickness differs for these orientations. When measured perpendicular to
the growth direction, the mean retardance is approximately proportional to the
square root of the substrate thickness. In contrast, when measured parallel to
the growth direction, we observe a generally higher mean retardance and an
approximately linear correlation with thickness. This anisotropy arises not
from differences in stress magnitude but from differences in the interlayer
correlation of the principal stress axes, as evidenced by correlation
coefficients between the azimuth angles of consecutive layers in the diamond
crystal. To simulate the integrated retardance of diamond wafers, we propose a
two-dimensional random walk model with momentum drift, which captures the
diamond crystal tendency to preserve the azimuth angle across the samples. By
optimizing the momentum factor, we show that the model can closely match
experimental data. The momentum factor is found higher along the growth
direction, which is consistent with the calculated correlation coefficients.
Furthermore, both the model and experiments indicate that
retardance-to-thickness ratios of thin samples converge toward similar base
retardances in both orientations. These findings establish a quantitative
framework for interpreting birefringence in diamond substrates, with
implications for material selection and development in thermal management,
quantum sensing, high-power electronics, and optical applications.

We report a combined experimental and numerical investigation of spin-wave
dynamics in a hybrid magnonic crystal consisting of a CoFeB artificial spin ice
(ASI) of stadium-shaped nanoelements patterned atop a continuous NiFe film,
separated by a 5 nm Al2O3 spacer. Using Brillouin light scattering
spectroscopy, we probe the frequency dependence of thermal spin waves as
functions of applied magnetic field and wavevector, revealing the decisive role
of interlayer dipolar coupling in the magnetization dynamics. Micromagnetic
simulations complement the experiments, showing a strong interplay between ASI
edge modes and backward volume modes in the NiFe film. The contrast in
saturation magnetization between CoFeB and NiFe enhances this coupling, leading
to a pronounced hybridization manifested as a triplet of peaks in the spectra -
predicted by simulations and observed experimentally. This magnon-magnon
coupling persists over a wide magnetic field range, shaping both the spin-wave
dispersion and frequency-field response throughout the hysteresis loop. Our
findings establish how ASI geometry can selectively enhance specific spin-wave
wavelengths in the underlying film, identifying them as preferential channels
for magnonic signal transport and manipulation.

Materials with bespoke properties have long been identified by computational
searches, and their experimental realisation is now coming within reach through
autonomous laboratories. Scattering experiments are central to verifying the
atomic structures of autonomously synthesised materials. Yet, interpreting
these measurements typically requires user expertise and manual processing, or
machine learning (ML) models trained on predefined datasets, limiting fully
autonomous materials discovery. Here, we introduce a differentiable
optimisation framework that treats scattering calculations, energetics, and
chemical constraints as a unified refinement problem. Capability demonstrations
across molecules, crystal structures, nanoparticles, and amorphous matter show
that this data-driven approach resolves structural degeneracies with
multi-modal inputs - suggesting its usefulness for informing, and ultimately
guiding, the operation of autonomous laboratories.

Nanoporous metals allow for tailoring composition and surface-to-volume
ratio, both aspects critical for applications in catalysis. Here, Ag70Au30 (2
at. %) films with a face-centered cubic structure were deposited at 400{\deg}C,
either {111}-textured or randomly oriented. Upon chemical dealloying, atom
probe tomography of the nanoporous structure reveals that the textured film
retains a up to 2.7 times higher Ag concentration within the ligaments compared
to the randomly oriented film that exhibits ligament coarsening, indicating
faster dealloying kinetics. Our study highlights the potential of
microstructure engineering in tailoring the properties of nanoporous metals for
possible future catalytic and electrochemical applications.

The magnetic properties of two-dimensional (2D) materials have been
attracting increasing attention in recent years due to their unique behavior
and possible applications in new devices. One material of great interest is the
2D van der Waals (vdW) crystal CrSBr, that exhibits antiferromagnetic (AF)
order at low temperatures due to an interlayer AF exchange interaction. Here we
present a full quantum spin-wave theory for CrSBr considering three intralayer
and one interlayer exchange interactions, and triaxial magnetic anisotropy. The
fits of the theoretical results to antiferromagnetic resonance (AFMR)
measurements and inelastic neutron scattering data yield reliable values for
the seven interaction parameters that can be used to calculate other properties
of this interesting material.

Controlling optical and tribological properties of metal surfaces, like color
and wear rate, without altering their chemical composition is a highly
desirable process across numerous fields of science and industry. It represents
a cost-effective alternative to traditional chemical methods, particularly for
copper, one of the most important metals widely used where high electrical and
thermal conductivity, alongside resistance to corrosion, are required. We
investigated the control of copper surface texture through a controlled
micromodification process, utilizing constant force and velocity with abrasive
silicon carbide sandpaper on ultrapure copper pellets exhibiting elongated
crystallographic grains, and its impact on optical properties. Systematically
varying grit size and rubbing direction, both along and across the grains,
resulted in tunable microgroove morphology, demonstrating a marked difference
in wear rate between single-grain and multi-grain abrasion. Furthermore,
modification along copper grain boundaries yielded a change in the wear rate by
a factor of two, related to single-grain and multi-grain abrasion regime
changes, enabling precise control over material performance via tuned abrasion
conditions. Colorimetric analysis via C-Microscopy revealed a strong,
statistically significant relationship between abrasive parameters, microgroove
geometry (inclination angle, depth, and size), and optical spectral signatures,
which were then parametrized to achieve targeted control. This research
demonstrates a simple yet effective approach to color and reflectance
modification via microgroove engineering, offering a pathway to customized
material properties by uniquely coupling contact mechanics, surface morphology,
and colorimetry at the microscale level.

### Origin of trapped intralayer Wannier and charge-transfer excitons in moiré materials

Moir\'e materials offer a versatile platform for engineering excitons with
unprecedented control, promising next-generation optoelectronic applications.
While continuum models are widely used to study moir\'e excitons due to their
computational efficiency, they often disagree with ab initio many-body
approaches, as seen for intralayer excitons in WS$_2$/WSe$_2$ heterobilayers.
Here, we resolve these discrepancies using an atomistic, quantum-mechanical
framework based on the Bethe-Salpeter equation with localized Wannier functions
as the basis for the electronic structure. We show that inclusion of dielectric
screening due to hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) encapsulation is essential to
reproduce the full set of experimentally observed features of moir\'e
intralayer excitons. Our analysis reveals a competition between Wannier and
charge transfer characters, driven by variations between direct and indirect
band gaps at high symmetry stacking regions due to atomic relaxations and
environmentally tunable electron-hole interactions. Building on this insight,
we demonstrate that the lowest-energy bright excitons are Wannier-like in
WS2/WSe2 heterobilayers but charge-transfer-like in twisted WSe2 homobilayers,
despite having comparable moir\'e lengths when encapsulated in hBN. In the
absence of hBN encapsulation, the lowest-energy bright exciton in twisted
WSe$_2$ becomes Wannier-like. These results establish atomistic modeling as a
powerful and efficient approach for designing and controlling excitonic
phenomena in moir\'e materials.

Among emerging energy materials, halide and chalcogenide perovskites have
garnered significant attention over the last decade owing to the abundance of
their constituent species, low manufacturing costs, and their highly tunable
composition-structure-property space. Navigating the vast perovskite
compositional landscape is possible using density functional theory (DFT)
computations, but they are not easily extended to predictions of the
synthesizability of new materials and their properties. As a result, only a
limited number of compositions identified to have desirable optoelectronic
properties from these calculations have been realized experimentally. One way
to bridge this gap is by learning from the experimental literature about how
the perovskite composition-structure space relates to their likelihood of
laboratory synthesis. Here, we present our efforts in combining high-throughput
DFT data with experimental labels collected from the literature to train
classifier models employing various materials descriptors to forecast the
synthesizability of any given perovskite compound. Our framework utilizes the
positive and unlabeled (PU) learning strategy and makes probabilistic estimates
of the synthesis likelihood based on DFT- computed energies and the prior
existence of similar synthesized compounds. Our data and models can be readily
accessed via a Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reproducible (FAIR)
nanoHUB tool.
