- **TL;DR**: 该论文展示了利用磁子（磁性材料中的集体自旋激发）作为物理储层来预测复杂混沌信号，通过磁性微盘中的涡旋态实现高效的储层计算。

Forecasting complex, chaotic signals is a central challenge across science
and technology, with implications ranging from secure communications to climate
modeling. Here we demonstrate that magnons - the collective spin excitations in
magnetically ordered materials - can serve as an efficient physical reservoir
for predicting such dynamics. Using a magnetic microdisk in the vortex state as
a magnon-scattering reservoir, we show that intrinsic nonlinear interactions
transform a simple microwave input into a high-dimensional spectral output
suitable for reservoir computing, in particular, for time series predictions.
Trained on the Mackey-Glass benchmark, which generates a cyclic yet aperiodic
time series widely used to test machine-learning models, the system achieves
accurate and reliable predictions that rival state-of-the-art physical
reservoirs. We further identify key design principles: spectral resolution
governs the trade-off between dimensionality and accuracy, while combining
multiple device geometries systematically improves performance. These results
establish magnonics as a promising platform for unconventional computing,
offering a path toward scalable and CMOS-compatible hardware for real-time
prediction tasks.

### Many-Body Effects in a Molecular Quantum NAND Tree

- **TL;DR**: 该论文研究了基于炔基延伸异聚乙炔骨架的化学编码量子NAND树，通过端基取代设置输入，通过传输节点的存在与否读取输出。研究表明NAND行为在动态关联下持续存在，但节点位置和化学位移对电子-电子相互作用敏感。热电功率被确定为门逻辑的化学鲁棒读出方式。

Molecules provide the smallest possible circuits in which quantum
interference and electron correlation can be engineered to perform logical
operations, including the universal NAND gate. We investigate a chemically
encoded quantum NAND tree based on alkynyl-extended iso-polyacetylene
backbones, where inputs are set by end-group substitution and outputs are read
from the presence or absence of transmission nodes. Using quantum many-body
transport theory, we show that NAND behavior persists in the presence of
dynamic correlations, but that the nodal positions and their chemical shifts
depend sensitively on electron-electron interactions. This sensitivity
highlights the potential of these systems not only to probe the strength of
electronic correlations but also to harness them in shaping logical response.
The thermopower is identified as a chemically robust readout of gate logic,
providing discrimination margins that greatly exceed typical experimental
uncertainties, in an observable governed primarily by the variation of
transport rather than its absolute magnitude.

### Nonlinear Optical Response in Pseudo-Hermitian Systems at Steady State

- **TL;DR**: 建立了伪厄米系统中的非线性光学电导率稳态理论，推导了速度和长度规范下的一阶和二阶电导率张量紧凑公式，证明了它们的等价性，并在宇称-时间对称二能级系统中揭示了厄米系统不存在的非线性现象。

We establish a steady-state theory for nonlinear optical conductivity in
pseudo-Hermitian systems. We derive compact formulas for the first and second
order conductivity tensors in both the velocity and length gauges and prove
their exact equivalence through generalized sum rules and Berry connection
identities by formulating the nonlinear response in terms of a biorthogonal
density matrix. Utilizing the formalism on parity-time symmetric two-level
systems reveals nonlinear phenomena that are not present in Hermitian systems,
such as extra terms in the conductivity, corrections to the velocity operator,
photocurrent, and resonance structures with higher-order poles at one-photon
transitions. These features yield qualitatively distinct harmonic generation
responses like real second-order conductivities and nonzero DC limits. These
results provide new insights into nonlinear light-matter interactions in active
media characterized by balanced gain and loss, with implications for
non-Hermitian photonics, dissipative topological systems, and quantum devices
designed with engineered dissipation.

### Interband optical conductivity in two-dimensional semi-Dirac bands tilting along the quadratic dispersion

- **TL;DR**: 该论文研究了二维倾斜半狄拉克材料的独特光学特性，提出了新的倾斜参数定义，并发现光学电导率中存在光谱固定点现象。

Two-dimensional (2D) semi-Dirac materials feature a unique anisotropic band
structure characterized by quadratic dispersion along one spatial direction and
linear dispersion along the other, effectively hybridizing ordinary and Dirac
fermions. The anisotropy of energy dispersion can be further modulated through
band tilting along either spatial direction of the wave vector. We propose a
new definition of tilt parameter to characterize Lifshitz phases in 2D
semi-Dirac bands tilting along the quadratically dispersing direction. Using
linear response theory, we theoretically investigate the interband optical
conductivity of 2D tilted semi-Dirac bands. Our analytical zero-temperature
results reveal pronounced distinctions from Dirac and semi-Dirac systems
tilting along the linearly dispersing direction. Notably, we find that spectral
fixed point emerges in the optical conductivity over a specific range of the
tilt parameter, a phenomenon explained by the corresponding behavior of the
joint density of states. These findings provide a robust theoretical framework
for identifying and characterizing 2D tilted semi-Dirac materials and establish
clear spectral fingerprints that distinguish different kinds of 2D semi-Dirac
bands and Dirac bands. Our predictions can guide future experimental studies of
anisotropic band engineering and tilt-dependent phenomena.

### Integration of Silica in G4CMP for Phonon Simulations: Framework and Tools for Material Integration

- **TL;DR**: 本文介绍了G4CMP工具包的技术形式主义，支持超导量子比特和低阈值探测器社区在自定义材料中实现声子模拟，并以硅酸盐声子传输特性为例进行详细分析。

Superconducting detectors with sub-eV energy resolution have demonstrated
success setting limits on Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics due to their
unique sensitivity to low-energy events. G4CMP, a Geant4-based extension for
condensed matter physics, provides a comprehensive toolkit for modeling phonon
and charge dynamics in cryogenic materials. This paper introduces a technical
formalism to support the superconducting qubit and low-threshold detector
community in implementing phonon simulations in custom materials into the
G4CMP. As a case study, we present the results of a detailed analysis of silica
phonon transport properties relevant for simulating substrate backgrounds in
Beryllium Electron capture in Superconducting Tunnel junctions (BeEST)-style
experiments using G4CMP. Additionally, Python-based tools were developed to aid
users in implementing their own materials and are available on the G4CMP
repository.

### A Wigner Matrix Based Convolution Algorithm For Matrix Elements in the LCAO Method

- **Categories**: cond-mat.mtrl-sci
- **TL;DR**: 本文提出了一种基于Wigner矩阵的卷积算法（WMCA），用于高效计算任意角动量的双中心积分，旨在结合紧束缚方法的效率和从头计算方法的可转移性。

The linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) method uses a small basis
set in exchange for expensive matrix element calculations. The most efficient
approximation for the matrix element calculations is the two-center
approximation (2CA) in tight binding (TB). In the 2CA, a variety of matrix
elements are neglected with only "two-center integrals" (2CI) remaining. The
2CI are calculated efficiently by rotating to symmetrical coordinates where the
integral is parameterized. This makes TB fast in exchange for diminished
transferability. An ideal electronic structure method has both the efficiency
of TB and the transferability of ab-initio methods. In this work, I expand the
full crystal potential into multipoles where the resulting matrix elements are
transformed into the form of 2CI between high angular momentum functions. The
usual Slater-Koster formulae for TB are limited to $l\leq3$; to enable
efficient evaluation of the full crystal potential 2CI, I derive a Wigner
matrix based convolution algorithm (WMCA) that works for arbitrary angular
momentum. Given a suitable method for generating a local ab-initio Kohn-Sham
potential, the algorithm for calculating matrix elements is applicable to fully
ab-initio LCAO methods (this is the subject of forthcoming work). In this
paper, I apply the WMCA to silicon using a model crystal potential.

### Time-reversal positivity

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种称为时间反演正性的新分析工具，用于解释时间反演对称性与量子蒙特卡洛模拟中无符号性质之间的关系，并证明了时间反演对称非厄米哈伯德模型的基态唯一性。

We propose a new analytical tool called time-reversal positivity. It is an
analogue of the Majorana reflection positivity in time-reversal symmetric case.
This new time-reversal positivity can fully explain the relationship between
time-reversal symmetry and the sign-free property in quantum Monte Carlo
simulations. Using a cone-theoretical method, we show the ground state
uniqueness for the time-reversal symmetric non-hermitian Hubbard model.

### Hund's coupling assisted orbital-selective superconductivity in Ba1-xKxFe2As2
- **arXiv**: [2510.06435](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06435)  ·  [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.06435.pdf)

- **TL;DR**: 该研究通过高分辨率角分辨光电子能谱发现，在Ba_{1-x}K_{x}Fe_{2}As_{2}中，超导能隙具有显著的轨道依赖性，d_{xy}轨道在较高掺杂时超导能隙消失，这与正常态中观察到的Hund金属行为一致。

While the superconducting transition temperature of hole-doped
Ba_{1-x}K_{x}Fe_{2}As_{2} decreases past optimal doping, superconductivity does
not completely disappear even for the fully doped KFe_{2}As_{2} compound. In
fact, superconductivity is robust through a Lifshitz transition where electron
bands become hole-like around the zone corner at around x=0.7, thus challenging
the conventional understanding of superconductivity in iron-based systems.
High-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy is used to
investigate the superconducting gap structure, as well as the normal state
electronic structure, around optimal doping and across the Lifshitz transition.
Our findings reveal a largely orbital-dependent superconducting gap structure,
where the more strongly correlated d_{xy} band has a vanishing superconducting
gap at higher doping, aligning with the Hund's metal behavior observed in the
normal state. Notably, the superconducting gap on the d_{xy} band disappears
before the Lifshitz transition, suggesting that the Fermi surface topology may
play a secondary role. We discuss how these results point to orbital-selective
superconducting pairing and how strong correlations via Hund's coupling may
shape superconducting gap structures in iron-based and other multiorbital
superconductors.

### A unified framework for semiclassical reaction rate theory

- **TL;DR**: 开发了一种通用的半经典理论来计算反应速率常数，该理论为现有半经典方法（瞬子理论和半经典过渡态理论）提供了一个形式化框架，并推广了瞬子理论的虚自由能公式。

A general semiclassical theory for the calculation of reaction rate constants
is developed. The theory can be understood as a formal framework that
encompasses existing semiclassical methods: instanton theory and semiclassical
transition state theory (SCTST). Unlike SCTST, the present formalism does not
start from the concept of "good" action-angle variables. Instead, it is based
on a conjectured connection between the cumulative reaction probability and the
instanton contribution to the formally exact generalisation of Gutzwiller's
formula for the trace of the Green's function. The formalism effectively
generalises the "imaginary free-energy" formulation of instanton theory to
microcanonical scattering rates and all orders in $\hbar$. In one dimension,
explicit expressions are derived for the generalised reduced action up to
$O(\hbar^4)$ using exact WKB/quantum Hamilton-Jacobi theory. The connection
between the present formalism and the standard second order vibrational
perturbation theory (VPT2) version of SCTST is explored. It is also shown that
the standard thermal instanton rate theory, as well as higher order (dividing
surface independent) "perturbative" corrections can be straightforwardly
derived from the framework. Above the crossover temperature, first-order
corrections in $\hbar$ to the parabolic barrier ("sphaleron") rate are also
derived. A simple anharmonic transition state theory and anharmonic version of
the Wigner tunneling correction are presented. Finally, the potential for the
development of new and improved semiclassical methods for modelling reaction
kinetics is discussed.

### Recurrence in a periodically driven and weakly damped Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou chain

- **Categories**: cond-mat.stat-mech, nlin.PS
- **TL;DR**: 在弱阻尼周期性驱动的α-FPUT链中发现了类似FPUT的准周期性能量恢复现象，这种恢复周期不是驱动周期的整数倍，可能代表一种广义的时间晶体样有序状态。

We report numerical evidence of Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT)-like
recurrence in weakly damped, periodically driven alpha-FPUT chains. In narrow
regions of driving amplitude and damping, energy is quasi-periodically
exchanged among a few low-frequency modes over long timescales. Unlike discrete
time crystals, the recurrence period is not an integer multiple of the driving
period and does not correspond to spontaneous symmetry breaking, yet it may
suggests a generalized, relaxed form of time-crystalline-like order. The
maximum damping allowing recurrence decreases rapidly with chain length,
suggesting that in the thermodynamic limit such behavior is unlikely to
persist. These results reveal a new type of coherent nonlinear dynamics in
driven, open multimode systems and provide guidance for experimentally
realizing long-lived quasi-periodic states.

### Intrinsic ultrafast edge photocurrent dynamics in WTe$_2$ driven by broken crystal symmetry

- **TL;DR**: 该研究直接解析了WTe₂中皮秒级边缘光电流动力学，展示了超快光-电转换（~250 GHz带宽）和低于150K时皮秒级光电流方向切换，揭示了由非平衡塞贝克效应引起的瞬态双极响应。

Directional photocurrents in two-dimensional materials arise from broken
crystal symmetry, offering pathways to high-speed, bias-free photodetection
beyond conventional devices. Tungsten ditelluride (WTe$_2$), a type-II Weyl
semimetal, exhibits robust symmetry-breaking-induced edge photocurrents from
competing nonlinear optical and photothermoelectric (PTE) mechanisms, whose
intrinsic dynamics have remained experimentally inaccessible. Here, we directly
resolve sub-picosecond edge photocurrent dynamics in WTe$_2$ through ohmic
contacts over temperatures from 300 K to 4 K. We demonstrate ultrafast
optical-to-electrical conversion with a 3 dB bandwidth of $\sim$250 GHz and
reveal picosecond-timescale switching of the net photocurrent direction below
150 K, linked to a Lifshitz transition. This transient bipolar response arises
from non-equilibrium Seebeck effects due to asymmetric cooling of hot electrons
and holes. These findings reveal previously hidden ultrafast dynamics in
symmetry-engineered materials, offering new strategies to disentangle competing
photocurrent mechanisms and enabling the development of self-powered, ultrafast
optoelectronic devices.

### GSM: GPU Accelerated Rare Events Sampling with Machine Learning Potentials

- **Categories**: physics.comp-ph
- **TL;DR**: 提出了GSM包，实现全生命周期GPU元动力学模拟，利用机器学习势能对百万原子系统进行高精度稀有事件采样

Enhanced sampling has achieved considerable success in molecular dynamics
(MD) simulations of rare events. Metadynamics (MetaD), owing to its excellent
compatibility with MD engines, became one of the most popular enhanced sampling
methods. With the boom of GPU computing and the advent of machine learning
potentials (MLPs), high-accuracy, large-scale MD simulations have gradually
become feasible. However, the corresponding GPU-based enhanced sampling tools
have not yet been well adapted to this progress. To enable full-life-cycle GPU
MetaD simulations, we propose the GPU Sampling MetaD (GSM) package. By
leveraging MLPs, it is feasible to perform high-precision rare event sampling
for systems comprising millions of atoms on a typical single GPU, which offers
a potential solution to many size-dependent problems. By conducting sampling in
several classical systems, the results sufficiently demonstrate the capability
of this package to simulate diverse atomic systems, especially efficient in
large scale systems.

### Enhancing Direct Air Capture through Potassium Carbonate Doping of Activated Carbons

- **TL;DR**: 通过原子模拟研究功能基团和碳酸钾掺杂对活性炭中CO₂和水吸附性能的影响，发现两者都能增强吸附能力并降低吸附起始压力。

Direct air capture of carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) is one of the most promising
strategies to mitigate rising atmospheric CO$_2$ levels. Among various
techniques, adsorption using porous materials is a viable method for extracting
CO$_2$ from air, even under humid conditions. However, identifying optimal
adsorbent materials remains a significant challenge. Moreover, the performance
of existing materials can be improved by doping with active species that boost
gas capture, a relatively unexplored field. In this study, we perform atomistic
simulations to investigate the adsorption, structural, and energetic properties
of CO$_2$ and water in realistic models of activated carbons. We first analyze
the impact of explicitly considering surfaces containing functional groups,
which aims to imitate the chemical environment of experimental samples.
Additionally, we introduce potassium carbonate within the pores of the
adsorbent to evaluate its effect on CO$_2$ and water adsorption. Our results
demonstrate that both functional groups and potassium carbonate enhance
adsorption, primarily by shifting the adsorption onset pressures to lower
values. Specifically, potassium carbonate clusters act as extra adsorption
sites for CO$_2$ and water, facilitating the nucleation of water molecules and
promoting the formation of a hydrogen bond network within the activated carbon
pores.

### Superconductivity of Incoherent Electrons near the Relativistic Mott Transition in Twisted Dirac Materials

- **TL;DR**: 该论文展示了在扭曲二维材料中，由强量子临界涨落驱动的超导性可以在相对论性Mott转变附近出现，并呈现出丰富的特性。

We demonstrate that superconductivity driven by strong quantum-critical
fluctuations can emerge near relativistic Mott transitions in twisted
two-dimensional materials, taking on a remarkably rich character. In twisted
double-bilayer WSe$_2$, all time-reversal-even, gap-opening collective modes
promote pairing, whereas time-reversal-odd modes do not. In a Dirac model of
twisted bilayer graphene, the Gross-Neveu transition into inter-valley-coherent
insulators gives rise to a spectrum of degenerate and nearly degenerate
superconducting states. More generally, we show that the richer the Dirac
structure, the more readily pairs can form. A crucial ingredient of the theory
is that critical fluctuations render the electronic states strongly incoherent,
allowing attractive pairing channels to overcome the bare Dirac semi-metal
behavior. Finally, we demonstrate a direct relation between boson-mediated
pairing and the formation of charge-carrying skyrmionic excitations in the
proximate insulating state.

### Kekulé Superconductivity in Twisted Magic Angle Bilayer Graphene

- **TL;DR**: 该论文提出了一个微观理论来解释扭曲石墨烯中的超导性，涉及一种谷内有限动量对密度波(PDW)，该状态自然地结合了Kekulé畸变到超导相中。

Motivated by recent scanning tunneling microscopy experiments which report
Kekul\'e ordering in the twisted graphene family, we develop a microscopic
theory of superconductivity, specifically for the bi-layer case. This involves
an intra-valley, finite-momentum pair-density wave (PDW) which naturally
incorporates a Kekul\'e distortion into the superconducting phase. The PDW
state displays three central features: (i) it spontaneously breaks $C_3$
rotational symmetry, producing nematic order, and (ii) it possesses a large
gap-to-critical-temperature ratio. Moreover, (iii) it yields a quasi-particle
density of states having a V-like shape (with a finite value at zero energy)
which transitions to a fully gapped, U-shaped spectrum with increasing
attraction. These characteristics, including consistency with an allowed
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition, align with key experimental
signatures in the twisted graphene family where the U-V transition is observed
in the tri-layer case. We find the paired state with a modest interaction
strength is near to a BEC-like regime, as appears consistent with the observed
extremely short coherence lengths. Together, these results establish a
microscopic intra-valley Kekul\'e PDW state as an essential ingredient towards
understanding unconventional superconductivity in twisted graphene.

### Systematic improvement of trial states in phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo

- **TL;DR**: 将耦合簇(CC)试探态在无相辅助场量子蒙特卡洛(AFQMC)方法中的应用扩展到包含三重和四重激发，建立AFQMC/CC层次结构，系统评估方法性能。

We extend the use of coupled cluster (CC) trial states in the phaseless
auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) method beyond single and double
excitations to include both triple and quadruple excitations. With this
AFQMC/CC hierarchy, we are able to systematically benchmark the method's
performance on molecular systems as the quality of the trial is improved. Our
results show that the phaseless AFQMC energy improves systematically and is
typically significantly more accurate than the energy of the underlying trial
state. However, the relative improvement compared to the trial CC energy
decreases as we ascend the CC hierarchy. As the CC wavefunction is usually
further approximated when used as an AFQMC trial, we also explore the
relationship between the components of the CC wavefunction and the resulting
AFQMC/CC error. Our results suggest that improving the representation of the CC
wave function in the AFQMC trial does not always lower the bias even when it
increases the fidelity of the trial with the exact ground state.

### Anomalous Criticality of Absorbing State Transition toward Jamming

- **TL;DR**: 该论文重新审视了偏置随机组织模型，发现在高密度区域存在超出Manna普适类描述的临界性异常，揭示了从吸收态到活性玻璃态的转变，并提出了包含分数时间动力学的场论框架。

The jamming transition is traditionally regarded as a geometric transition
governed by static contact networks. Recently, dynamic phase transitions of
athermal particles under periodic shear provide a new lens on this problem,
leading to a conjecture that jamming transition corresponds to an
absorbing-state transition within the Manna (conserved directed percolation)
universality class. Here, by re-examing the biased random organization model, a
minimal model for particles under periodic shearing that the conjecture bases
on, we uncover several criticality anomalies at high density beyond the
description of Manna universality class. In three-dimensional monodisperse
systems, crystallization disrupts the absorbing transition, while in dense
binary mixtures, a distinct transition from absorbing to active-glass states
emerges, signifying a new universality class of dynamic phase transitions.
Closer to jamming point, the quenched heterogeneity in the contact network
smears the dynamic transition via Griffiths effects and drives the system
toward heterogeneous directed percolation. We further proposal a field theory
with fractional time dynamics that unifies these phenomena, establishing a
theoretical framework linking jamming, disorder, and dynamic criticality.

### Signatures of broken symmetries in the excitations of a periodic 2DEG coupled to a cylindrical photon cavity

- **TL;DR**: 该研究在二维电子气系统中探索了由周期性超晶格、外部磁场和光子腔引起的对称性破缺效应，重点关注手性效应和电子-光子相互作用。

In a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in a periodic lateral superlattice
subjected to an external homogeneous magnetic field and in a cylindrical
far-infrared photon cavity we search for effects of broken symmetries: Static
ones, stemming from the unit cell of the system, and the external magnetic
field together with the dynamic ones caused by the vector potential of the
cavity promoting magnetic types of transitions, and the chirality of the
excitation pulse. The Coulomb interaction of the electrons is described within
density functional theory, but the electron-photon interactions are handled by
a configuration interaction formalism within each step of the density
functional approach, both for the static and the dynamic system. In the
dynamical calculations we observe weak chiral effects that change character as
the strength of the electron-photon interaction and the external magnetic field
are increased. From the analysis of the chiral effects we identify an important

- **TL;DR**: 提出了局部有序平均原子势函数(LOAA)，通过考虑局部有序效应扩展了传统的平均原子势函数，能够以更小的系统规模获得统计收敛结果，显著降低计算成本。

An extension to the effective average-atom (AA) interatomic potential (IP)
that accounts for local ordering effects is derived. While the AA approach is
only valid for random alloys, the new local-order average-atom (LOAA) IP
accounts for short-range order within a material by utilizing information from
partial radial distribution functions. Simulations with a LOAA potential
require smaller system sizes to achieve statistically converged results and
therefore can be used to model complex materials where short-range order
effects are important, such as high-entropy alloys, at a fraction of the
computational cost of standard IPs. The method is validated for a
two-dimensional (2D) binary hexagonal crystal with Lennard-Jones (LJ)
interactions, and for three-dimensional (3D) Fe$_{(1-x)/2}$Ni$_{(1-x)/2}$Cr$_x$
and Ni$_{0.67}$Al$_{0.33}$ alloys modeled via embedded-atom method (EAM)
potentials. For the 2D crystal we obtain a local ordering phase diagram in
terms of the LJ parameters and demonstrate that in all cases the LOAA
formulation obtains elastic properties that match the true-species case using
standard IPs. The 3D alloy examples further demonstrate the ability of this
method to accurately capture other material properties and phase
transformations.

Hyperuniform materials, characterized by anomalously suppressed
long-wavelength density fluctuations, exhibit unique optical and photonic
properties distinct from both crystalline and random media. While most prior
studies have focused on single-species systems, we investigate the broader
class of \textit{multihyperuniform} systems inspired by biological
photoreceptor mosaics. Using particle-based models with varying species number,
size ratios, and interaction competition, we demonstrate that multispecies
mixtures can achieve robust and stealthy hyperuniform configurations, even in
highly disordered states. We further show how these configurations can be
mapped to multifunctional composites with tailored optical responses, including
isotropic structural coloration, enhanced absorption, and engineered dielectric
properties that facilitate transmission while suppressing scattering. Our
results highlight multihyperuniformity as a generalizable design principle for
multifunctional disordered photonic materials, opening avenues for robust,
tunable, and scalable optical applications.

### Phonon Hall Viscosity and the Intrinsic Thermal Hall Effect of $α$-RuCl$_3$

- **TL;DR**: 通过超声测量声法拉第效应，发现α-RuCl₃中的声子具有霍尔粘度，这种非耗散性粘度能旋转声子极化并偏转声子热流，从而产生内在的热霍尔效应。

The thermal Hall effect has been observed in a wide variety of magnetic
insulators, yet its origin remains controversial. While some studies attribute
it to intrinsic origins -- such as heat carriers with Berry curvature -- others
propose extrinsic origins -- such as heat carriers scattering off crystal
defects. Even the nature of the heat carriers is unknown: magnons, phonons, and
fractionalized spin excitations have all been proposed. These questions are
significant for the study of quantum spin liquids and are particularly relevant
for $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, where a quantized thermal Hall effect has been
attributed to Majorana edge modes. Here, we use ultrasonic measurements of the
acoustic Faraday effect to demonstrate that the phonons in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$
have Hall viscosity -- a non-dissipative viscosity that rotates phonon
polarizations and deflects phonon heat currents. We show that phonon Hall
viscosity produces an intrinsic thermal Hall effect that quantitatively
accounts for a significant fraction of the measured thermal Hall effect in
$\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. More broadly, we demonstrate that the acoustic Faraday
effect is a powerful tool for detecting phonon Hall viscosity and the
associated phonon Berry curvature, offering a new way to uncover and study
exotic states of matter that elude conventional experiments.

The Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition is the prototype of a
phase transition driven by the formation and interaction of topological defects
in two-dimensional (2D) systems. In typical models these are vortices: above a
transition temperature $T_{\rm BKT}$ vortices are free, below this transition
temperature they get confined. In this work we extend the concept of BKT
transition to quantum systems in two dimensions. In particular, we demonstrate
that a zero-temperature quantum BKT phase transition, driven by a coupling
constant can occur in 2D models governed by an effective gauge field theory
with a diverging dielectric constant. One particular example is that of a
compact U(1) gauge theory with a diverging dielectric constant, where the
quantum BKT transition is induced by non-relativistic, purely 2D magnetic
monopoles, which can be viewed also as electric vortices. These quantum BKT
transitions have the same diverging exponent $z$ as the quantum Griffiths
transition but have nothing to do with disorder.

### Accelerating Molecular Dynamics Simulations with Foundation Neural Network Models using Multiple Time-Step and Distillation

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种使用基础神经网络模型加速分子动力学模拟的双层神经网络多时间步策略，通过蒸馏过程获得更简单但更快的模型来捕获快速变化力，实现4倍和2.3倍的模拟加速。

We present a strategy to accelerate molecular dynamics simulations using
foundation neural network models. To do so, we apply a dual-level neural
network multi-time-step (MTS) strategy where the target accurate potential is
coupled to a simpler but faster model obtained via a distillation process.
Thus, the 3.5 \r{A}-cutoff distilled model is sufficient to capture the fast
varying forces, i.e. mainly bonded interactions, from the accurate potential
allowing its use in a reversible reference system propagator algorithms
(RESPA)-like formalism. The approach conserves accuracy, preserving both static
and dynamical properties, while enabling to evaluate the costly model only
every 3 to 6 fs depending on the system. Consequently, large simulation
speedups over standard 1 fs integration are observed: 4-fold in homogeneous
systems and 2.3-fold in large solvated proteins. Such a strategy is applicable
to any neural network potential and reduces their performance gap with
classical force fields.

### Comparison of typicality in quantum and classical many-body systems

Quantum typicality refers to the phenomenon that the expectation values of
any given observable are nearly identical for the overwhelming majority of all
normalized vectors in a sufficiently high-dimensional Hilbert (sub-)space. As a
consequence, we show that the thermal equilibrium fluctuations in many-body
quantum systems can be very closely imitated by the purely quantum mechanical
uncertainties (quantum fluctuations) of suitably chosen pure states. On the
other hand, we find that analogous typicality effects of similar generality are
not encountered in classical systems. The reason is that the basic mathematical
structure, in particular the description of pure states, is fundamentally
different in quantum and classical mechanics.

### Magnetic-Field-Induced Geometric Response of Mean-Field Projectors: Streda Formula and Orbital Magnetization

- **TL;DR**: 本文通过微扰理论研究相互作用电子系统在磁场中的响应，发现平均场密度矩阵的线性响应是纯几何的，仅依赖于波函数导数和贝里联络，与相互作用势和准粒子色散无关。

We study the magnetic-field response of interacting electron systems within
mean-field theory using perturbation theory. We show that the linear response
of the mean-field density-matrix to a weak magnetic field is purely geometric:
it depends only on wavefunction derivatives, the Berry connections linking the
occupied and unoccupied subspaces, and is independent of the interaction
potential and the quasiparticle dispersion. This leads to compact,
gauge-invariant projector expressions for both the St\v{r}eda formula and the
formula for orbital magnetization. Our calculation explicitly elucidates the
role of exchange and self-consistency in defining current vertices for orbital
magnetization calculations. Our work establishes a direct connection between
mean-field theory, quantum geometry and the non-interacting topological band
theory.

### Emergence of multiple relaxation processes during low to high density transition in Au49Cu26.9Si16.3Ag5.5Pd2.3 metallic glass

The existence of multiple amorphous states, or polyamorphism, remains one of
the most debated phenomena in disordered matter, particularly regarding its
microscopic origin and impact on glassy dynamics. Profiting of the enhanced
data quality provided by brilliant synchrotrons, we combined high pressure
X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction to investigate the
atomic dynamics-structure relationship in a Au49Cu26.9Si16.3Ag5.5Pd2.3 metallic
glass at room temperature. We identify a structural and dynamical crossover
near 3 GPa, marked by avalanches-like massive atomic rearrangements that
promote the system toward increasingly compact atomic cluster connections. This
crossover superimposes to a pressure-induced acceleration of the atomic motion
recently reported, and signals the onset of a transitional state, potentially
linked to the nucleation of a new phase within the glass, characterized by the
coexistence of two amorphous states with distinct relaxation processes. These
results provide evidence for a sluggish, continuous polyamorphic
transformation, even in absence of marked structural discontinuities.

### Twisted locality-preserving automorphisms, anomaly index, and generalized Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorems with anti-unitary symmetries

Symmetries and their anomalies are powerful tools to understand quantum
matter. In this work, for quantum spin chains, we define twisted
locality-preserving automorphisms and their Gross-Nesme-Vogts-Werner indices,
which provide a unified framework to describe both unitary and anti-unitary
symmetries, on-site and non-on-site symmetries, and internal and translation
symmetries. For a symmetry $G$ with actions given by twisted
locality-preserving automorphisms, we give a microscopic definition of its
anomaly index, which is an element in $H^3_\varphi(G; U(1))$, where the
subscript $\varphi$ means that anti-unitary elements of $G$ act on $U(1)$ by
complex conjugation. We show that an anomalous symmetry leads to multiple
Lieb-Schultz-Matttis-type theorems. In particular, any state with an anomalous
symmetry must either have long-range correlation or violate the entanglement
area law. Based on this theorem, we further deduce that any state with an
anomalous symmetry must have long-range entanglement, and any Hamiltonian that
has an anomalous symmetry cannot have a unique gapped symmetric ground state,
as long as the interactions in the Hamiltonian decay fast enough as the range
of the interaction increases. For Hamiltonians with only two-spin interactions,
the last theorem holds if the interactions decay faster than $1/r^2$, where $r$
is the distance between the two interacting spins. We demonstrate these general
theorems in various concrete examples.

### Quasiparticle Description of Angle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy for SrCuO2

- **TL;DR**: 本文通过第一性原理多体微扰理论重新解释SrCuO2的ARPES实验，提出其光谱特征源于长程反铁磁基态中的自旋无序，而非传统的自旋-电荷分离模型。

SrCuO2 has long been considered a near-archetypal realization of a quasi one
dimensional (1D) system of interacting electrons with short-range interactions.
Within this framework, experimental observations - interpreted through the lens
of the 1D Hubbard model-suggest that electron and hole excitations decay into
two types of (unphysical) collective bosonic modes: spinons, which carry the
spin degree of freedom, and holons, which carry the charge degree of freedom.
This model, known as spin-charge separation, is most directly evidenced by
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), where a photo-induced hole
decays into a continuum of these excitations. Here we present an alternative
perspective grounded in first-principles, self-consistent, and parameter-free
many-body perturbation theory. In this revised quasiparticle framework, ARPES
can be understood as a one-body effect arising from mild disorder in a
long-range antiferromagnetic ground state. the emergence of the so-called
spinon branch arises naturally from spin disorder, the anomalous line widths
are accurately captured, and we provide a compelling explanation for the
spectral weight observed at the non-magnetic zone boundary. This
reinterpretation provides a unified explanation for key experimental signatures
previously attributed to spin-charge separation, including features observed in
optical conductivity. Additionally, we show that SrCuO2 exhibits a nontrivial
interchain coupling that significantly influences both its one-particle and
two-particle spectral functions. By comparing the spectral features of SrCuO2
with those of La2CuO4, we argue that SrCuO2 shares notable similarities with
the two-dimensional cuprates - both being rooted in a common CuO4
plaquette-based molecular orbital framework.

Implementation of Effective Core Potentials (ECPs) into the molecular
scattering suite UKRmol+ is presented together with a set of calculations for a

associated molecular integrals. We derive expressions for ECP integrals over
B-spline type orbitals using their momentum-space representation and describe
their implementation. Sample calculations are presented for electron collision

hydride (WH) as well as photoionisation of methyl iodide (CH$_3$I).

The recently introduced concept of generalized thermodynamics is explored
here in the context of 1d, 2d and 3d data analysis, performed on samples drawn
from a 3d X-ray soil sample image. Different threshold levels are used to
binarize the 3d sample, wherefrom relative frequencies of binary patterns are
found and then used to address finite size scaling behavior of the response
functions as a function of the disorder parameter (equivalent of temperature in
thermodynamics). It is found that for different threshold levels response
functions for increasing sample sizes approach the thermodynamic limit from
different directions, with a crossover reminiscent of a transition from open to
periodic boundaries of the Ising model, implying existence of a characteristic
correlation scale. It is argued here that this characteristic scale corresponds
to the "natural" properties of the data, where correlations within finite size
samples are neither underestimated nor overestimated. In the current context of
soil this scale may be related to the so-called Representative elementary
volume (REV), while in other situations this characteristic scale should be
interpreted in the context of the phenomenon under study.

Thermal gradient driven skyrmion dynamics offers a promising route toward
green spintronics, enabling the utilization of waste heat for information
transport and processing. Using micromagnetic simulations, we investigate Neel
skyrmions in a Co-Pt bilayer nanoracetrack and demonstrate that stochastic
torques induced by a thermal gradient drive skyrmion motion toward the hotter
region with a nearly vanishing Hall angle. The dynamics depends sensitively on
intrinsic material parameters - the skyrmion velocity decreases with increasing
damping constant, increases with stronger thermal gradients, and varies
systematically with saturation magnetization, interfacial DMI strength, and
uniaxial out of plane anisotropy. Importantly, we identify a specific range of
material parameters within which the skyrmion velocity changes sharply while
the Hall angle remains strongly suppressed, saturating near zero. This
comprehensive parameter-dependent study establishes a universal design
framework for minimizing the Hall effect in thermal gradient driven spintronic
systems.

Reactive aluminum (Al) alloy powders are promising for advanced
manufacturing, joining, and energetic applications, yet scalable routes that
couple controlled reactivity with safe handling remain limited. While nanoscale
Al powders ignite readily, their agglomeration, handling, and safety limit
broad deployment. Here, we manufacture micron-sized Al-based powders produced
by ultrasonic atomization (UA), targeting a balance of enhanced reactivity and
process robustness. Binary systems (AlCu, AlSi, AlMg) and pure Al were
synthesized, and their morphology, phases present, thermal stability, and
oxidation behavior were characterized using XRD, SEM, and DTA/TGA in an Ar/O2
environment. We show that alloy selection and UA-controlled microstructure can
modify the native Al2O3 passivation, alter oxidation pathways, and shift
thermal onsets/exotherms. The results establish a manufacturing-forward
framework for designing micron-sized powders with tunable ignition/oxidation
behavior.

PrSb$_2$ exhibits a charge-density wave (CDW) transition at $T_\mathrm{CDW} =
100$ K and antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering at $T_\mathrm{N} = 5$ K at ambient
pressure. Hall resistivity measurements revealed an anomalous feature within
the AFM state, which was attributed to the topological Hall effect (THE),
ruling out contributions from the ordinary and anomalous Hall effects.
Significantly, the THE anomaly diminished with increasing pressure and almost
vanished as the CDW transition was suppressed near the critical pressure $P_c$
= 1.0 GPa. These findings suggest a relationship between the CDW order and the
appearance of the THE in PrSb$_2$.

The phenomenon of field-induced superconductor to insulator transition (SIT)
in disordered 2D electron systems has been a subject of controversy since its
discovery in the early 1990s. Here we present a phenomenological quantitative
theory of this phenomenon which is not based exclusively on the boson-vortex
duality used commonly in the field. Within a new low-temperature framework of
the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) functional approach to
superconducting fluctuations we propose and develop a scenario in which bosons
of Cooper-pair fluctuations (CPFs) condense and localize in real-space
mesoscopic puddles under increasing magnetic field due to diminishing stiffness
of the fluctuation modes at low temperatures in a broad range of momentum
space. Quantum tunneled CPFs relieving the condensed mesoscopic puddles, which
consequently pair break into fermionic quasi-particle excitations, dominate the
thermally activated inter-puddles transport. The spatially shrinking puddles of
CPFs, embedded in expanding normal-state regions, upon further increasing
field, suppress the quasi-particle excitation gap and so lead to high-field
negative magneto-resistance (MR). Application to amorphous Indium-Oxide thin
films shows good quantitative agreement with experimental sheet resistance
data. In particular, in agreement with the experiment at low temperatures (i.e.
well below the quantum tunneling pair breaking "temperature"), the sheet
resistance isotherms are predicted to show a single crossing point at a quantum
critical field not far below the MR peak.

Data is the central commodity of the digital economy. Unlike physical goods,
it is non-rival, replicable at near-zero cost, and traded under heterogeneous
licensing rules. These properties defy standard supply--demand theory and call
for new pricing principles. We propose a game-theoretic approach in which the
value of a data string emerges from strategic competition among N players
betting on an underlying stochastic process, each holding partial information
about past outcomes. A better-informed player faces a choice: exploit their
informational advantage, or sell part of their dataset to less-informed
competitors. By analytically computing the Nash equilibrium of the game, we
determine the price range where the trade is beneficial to both buyer and
seller. We uncover a rich landscape of market effects that diverge from
textbook economics: first, prospective sellers and buyers can compete or
jointly exploit the less informed competitors depending on the quality of data
they hold. In a symbiotic regime, the seller can even share data for free while
still improving her payoffs, showing that losing exclusivity does not
necessarily reduce profit. Moreover, rivalry between well-informed players can
paradoxically benefit uninformed ones, demonstrating that information abundance
does not always translate to higher payoffs. We also show that the number of
players influences the competition between informed parties: trades impossible
in small markets become feasible in larger ones. These findings establish a
theoretical foundation for the pricing of intangible goods in dynamically
interacting digital markets, which are in need of robust valuation principles.

By mapping itinerant spin-$1/2$ fermions to four-state Fock parafermions, we
construct noninteracting tight-binding models for Fock parafermions in one
dimension. They have single-particle real energy spectra consisting of a sum of
single-particle energy levels each multiplied by a parafermionic occupation
number. The single-particle levels may be determined by diagonalizing a square
matrix whose order scales linearly with system size. These levels are the same
as those of noninteracting fermionic models, as we show explicitly for the
Rice-Mele model and the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. We show that the
thermodynamic distribution function for the occupation numbers of
noninteracting four-state parafermions is consistent with the mapping to
spin-$1/2$ fermions. We apply the mapping to create a parafermionic counterpart
of the Kitaev superconducting chain and show that the ground state in the
topological phase is fourfold degenerate, with each ground state distinguished
by the fourfold parafermionic occupation numbers of Majorana edge modes.

Co-reduction of multicomponent oxides with hydrogen provides a carbon-neutral
approach toward sustainable alloy design. Herein, we investigate the
hydrogen-based direct reduction, using in-situ high-energy X-ray diffraction of
two precursor variants: mechanically mixed powders and pre-sintered oxide
mixtures, targeting an equiatomic CoFeMnNi alloy. We find distinct reduction
pathways and microstructure evolution depending on initial precursors. Mixed
powders at 700 {\deg}C are reduced to body-centered-cubic, face-centered-cubic,
and MnO phases via halite, spinel, and Mn3O4 intermediates, whereas the
pre-sintered material directly transforms into a mixture of metallic and oxide
phases. The post-reduction microstructures are also different: mixed oxides
show loosely packed morphology, whereas pre-sintered material reveals metallic
nanoparticles supported on nanoporous MnO. The formation of nanoporous metallic
networks is strongly governed by the precursor state, highlighting the role of
initial precursors on the final microstructure. This precursor design strategy
offers a single-step route to nanoporous alloys with potential applications in
catalysis and energy technologies.

It is an ongoing quest to realize topologically ordered quantum states on
different platforms including condensed matter systems, quantum simulators and
digital quantum processors. Unlike conventional states characterized by their
local order, these exotic states are characterized by their non-local
entanglement. The consequences of topological order can be as profound as they
are surprising, ranging from the emergence of fractionalized anyonic
excitations to potentially providing a scalable platform for quantum error
correction. This deep connection to quantum computing naturally motivates the
realization and study of topologically ordered quantum states on quantum
processors. However, due to the non-local nature of these states, their study
presents a challenge for near-term quantum devices. This Perspective aims to
review the recent progress towards the experimental realization of
topologically ordered quantum states, their potential applications, and
promising directions of future research.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了Wannier函数分解激子(WFDX)方法，用于在ab initio Bethe-Salpeter方程框架内量化固体中激子的局域化特性。

We introduce the Wannier function decomposition of excitons (WFDX) method to
quantify exciton localization in solids within the ab initio Bethe-Salpeter
equation framework. By decomposing each Bloch exciton wavefunction into
products of single-particle electron and hole maximally localized Wannier
functions, this real-space approach provides well-defined orbital- and spatial-
resolved measures of both Frenkel and charge-transfer excitons at low
computational cost. We apply WFDX to excitons in acene crystals, quantifying
how the number of rings, the exciton spin state, and the center-of-mass momntum
affect spatial localization. Additionally, we show how this real-space
representation reflects structural nonsymmorphic symmetries that are hidden in
standard reciprocal-space descriptions. We demonstrate how the WFDX framework
can be used to efficiently interpolate exciton expansion coefficients in
reciprocal-space and outline how it may facilitate evaluation of observables
involving position operators, highlighting its potential as a general tool for
both analyzing and computing excitonic properties in solids.

### Renormalization of Interacting Random Graph Models

Random graphs offer a useful mathematical representation of a variety of real
world complex networks. Exponential random graphs, for example, are
particularly suited towards generating random graphs constrained to have
specified statistical moments. In this investigation, we elaborate on a
generalization of the former where link probabilities are conditioned on the
appearance of other links, corresponding to the introduction of interactions in
an effective generalized statistical mechanical formalism. When restricted to
the simplest non-trivial case of pairwise interactions, one can derive a closed
form renormalization group transformation for maximum coordination number two
on the corresponding line graph. Higher coordination numbers do not admit exact
closed form renormalization group transformations, a feature that paraphrases
the usual absence of exact transformations in two or more dimensional lattice
systems. We introduce disorder and study the induced renormalization group flow
on its probability assignments, highlighting its formal equivalence to time
reversed anisotropic drift-diffusion on the statistical manifold associated
with the effective Hamiltonian. We discuss the implications of our findings,
stressing the long wavelength irrelevance of certain classes of pair-wise
conditioning on random graphs, and conclude with possible applications. These
include modeling the scaling behavior of preferential effects on social
networks, opinion dynamics, and reinforcement effects on neural networks, as
well as how our findings offer a systematic framework to deal with data
limitations in inference and reconstruction problems.

### Topology of the generalized Brillouin zone of one-dimensional models

The generalized Brillouin zones (GBZs) are integral in the analysis of
non-Hermitian band structures. Conventional wisdom suggests that the GBZ should
be connected, where each point can be indexed by the real part of the
wavevector, similar to the Brillouin zone. Here we demonstrate rich topological
features of the GBZs in generic non-Hermitian one-dimensional models. We prove
and discuss a set of sufficient conditions for the model to ensure the
connectivity of its GBZ. In addition, we show that the GBZ can become
disconnected and have more connected components than the number of bands, which
results from the point-gap features of the band structure. This novel GBZ
topology is applied to further demonstrate a counterintuitive effect, where the
line gap of an open-boundary spectrum with sublattice symmetry may be closed
without changing its point-gap topology. Our results challenge the current
understanding of bands and gaps in non-Hermitian systems and highlight the need
to further investigate the topological effects associated with the GBZ
including topological invariants and open-boundary braiding.

### Electrical and thermal magnetotransport and the Wiedemann-Franz law in semimetals with electron-electron scattering

- **TL;DR**: 研究双载流子半金属在磁场中的电热输运特性和维德曼-弗朗兹定律的违反情况，通过精确求解玻尔兹曼方程分析杂质散射和电子-电子散射的影响。

We study the electrical and thermal transport properties and the violation of
the Wiedemann-Franz (WF) law of two-carrier semimetals using exact treatments
of the Boltzmann equation with the impurity and electron-electron scatterings
in a magnetic field. For comparison, we also study those in the case of Baber
scattering: a single-carrier system with an impurity scattering and
phenomenological momentum-dissipative electron-electron scattering. In both
systems, the longitudinal and transverse WF laws, $L = L_{\text{H}} = L_{0}=
\pi^2k_B^2/3e^2$, hold at zero temperature, where the Lorenz ratio $L$ and the
Hall Lorenz ratio $L_{\text{H}}$ are ratios of thermal conductivity
$\kappa_{\mu\nu}$ to electrical conductivity $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ divided by
temperature. However, the electron-electron scattering makes Lorenz ratios
deviate from $L_{0}$ with increasing temperature. To describe the WF law in a
magnetic field, we introduce another set of Lorenz ratios, $\widetilde{L}$ and
$\widetilde{L}_{\text{H}}$, defined as the ratios of the resistivity and the
Hall coefficient to their thermal counterparts. The WF laws for them,
$\widetilde{L} = \widetilde{L}_{\text{H}} = L_{0}$, and their violation are
helpful for the discussion of $L$ and $L_{\text{H}}$. For Baber scattering, our
exact result shows $L_{\text{H}}/L_{0} \sim (L/L_{0})^2$ in a weak magnetic
field. In semimetals, the violations of the WF laws are significant, reflecting
the different temperature dependence between the electrical and thermal
resistivities in a magnetic field. This is because the momentum conservation of
the electron-electron scattering has a completely different effect on
electrical and thermal magnetotransport. We sort out these behaviors using
$\widetilde{L}$ and $\widetilde{L}_{\text{H}}$. We also provide a relaxation
time approximation, which is useful for comparing theory and experiment.

### Non-uniqueness of the steady state for run-and-tumble particles with a double-well interaction potential

- **TL;DR**: 研究一维N个跑动-翻滚粒子在双势阱作用下的稳态密度分布，发现活性噪声导致的多稳态现象，与布朗粒子系统形成鲜明对比。

We study $N$ run-and-tumble particles (RTPs) in one dimension interacting via
a double-well potential $W(r)=-k_0 \, r^2/2+g \, r^4/4$, which is repulsive at
short interparticle distance $r$ and attractive at large distance. At large
time, the system forms a bound state where the density of particles has a
finite support. We focus on the determination of the total density of particles
in the stationary state $\rho_s(x)$, in the limit $N\to+\infty$. We obtain an
explicit expression for $\rho_s(x)$ as a function of the ''renormalized"
interaction parameter $k=k_0-3m_2$ where $m_2$ is the second moment of
$\rho_s(x)$. Interestingly, this stationary solution exhibits a transition
between a connected and a disconnected support for a certain value of $k$,
which has no equivalent in the case of Brownian particles. Analyzing in detail
the expression of the stationary density in the two cases, we find a variety of
regimes characterized by different behaviors near the edges of the support and
around $x=0$. Furthermore, we find that the mapping $k_0\to k$ becomes
multi-valued below a certain value of the tumbling rate $\gamma$ of the RTPs
for some range of values of $k_0$ near the transition, implying the existence
of two stable solutions. Finally, we show that in the case of a disconnected
support, it is possible to observe steady states where the density $\rho_s(x)$
is not symmetric. All our analytical predictions are in good agreement with
numerical simulations already for systems of $N = 100$ particles. The
non-uniqueness of the stationary state is a particular feature of this model in
the presence of active (RTP) noise, which contrasts with the uniqueness of the
Gibbs equilibrium for Brownian particles. We argue that these results are also
relevant for a class of more realistic interactions with both an attractive and
a repulsive part, but which decay at infinity.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究展示了在LSMO/STO异质结构中通过结构相变实现可调谐的磁子-声子强耦合，开发了多态混合模式的新路径。

Strong coupling between two quantized excitations in a cavity has the
potential to lead to hybridized states that bestow novel quantum phenomena as
required for emerging applications. In particular, tunable hybrid magnon-phonon
cavities with precise control knobs are in pressing demand for developing
quantum functionalities in solid-state platforms. Here, using a combination of
synthesis and characterization tools, we present an epitaxial
La0.7Sr0.3MnO3/SrTiO3 (LSMO/STO) heterostructure that manifests strong
couplings between the Kittel magnon and the transverse acoustic phonon.
Remarkably, leveraging the magnetoelastic interaction at the epitaxial
interface, we demonstrate that when the STO substrate undergoes a
cubic-to-tetragonal phase transition at ~105 K, the Kittel magnon of the LSMO
thin film splits into three bands due to anisotropic structural strains along
the [100], [010], and [001] crystalline axes, hence, resulting in an array of
non-degenerate, hybridized magnon-phonon modes. Moreover, we develop an
analytical model that can reproduce the interfacial strain-induced magnon
splitting and the strength of magnon-phonon coupling. Our work highlights
structural phase transitions as a sensitive trigger for generating multistate
magnon-phonon hybridization in high-quality magnetoelastic oxide
heterostructures - a new route for implementing strain-mediated hybrid
magnonics in phononic systems with potential applications in coherent energy
and signal transduction.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种基于切空间的Krylov方法（TaSK），用于在矩阵乘积态基态上高效计算零温度实频谱函数，并通过多种模型验证了其准确性和效率。

We present a tangent-space Krylov (TaSK) method for efficient computation of
zero-temperature real-frequency spectral functions on top of ground state (GS)
matrix product states (MPS) obtained from the Density Matrix Renormalization
Group. It relies on projecting resolvents to the tangent space of the GS-MPS,
where they can be efficiently represented using Krylov space techniques. This
allows for a direct computation of spectral weights and their corresponding
positions on the real-frequency axis. We demonstrate the accuracy and
efficiency of the TaSK approach by showcasing spectral data for various models.
These include the 1D Haldane-Shastry and Heisenberg models as benchmarks. As an
interesting application, we study the Hubbard model on a cylinder at
half-filling, augmented by a density-assisted hopping (DAH) term. We find that
DAH leads to particle-hole asymmetric single-particle mobilities and lifetimes
in the resulting Mott insulator, and identify the responsible scattering
processes. Further, we find that DAH influences the dispersion of Green's
function zeros beyond its range, which has a frustrating effect on the Mott
insulator studied here.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文研究了具有线性反馈耦合的伊辛模型，发现温度变化可诱导双稳态现象，并揭示了临界温度、非高斯分布特性以及相变速率标度律。

We study the dynamics of a mean-field Ising model whose coupling depends on
the magnetization via a linear feedback function. A key feature of this linear
feedback Ising model (FIM) is the possibility of temperature-induced
bistability, where a temperature increase can favor bistability between two
phases. We show that the linear FIM provides a minimal model for a
transcritical bifurcation as the temperature varies. Moreover, there can be two
or three critical temperatures when the external magnetic field is
non-negative. In the bistable region, we identify a Maxwell temperature where
the two phases are equally probable, and we find that increasing the
temperature favors the lower phase. We show that the probability distribution
becomes non-Gaussian on certain time intervals when the magnetization converges
algebraically at either zero temperature or critical temperatures. Near
critical points in the parameter space, we derive a Fokker-Planck equation,
construct the families of equilibrium distributions, and formulate scaling laws
for transition rates between two stable equilibria. The linear FIM provides
considerable freedom to control steady-state bifurcations and their associated
equilibrium distributions, which can be desirable for modeling feedback systems
across disciplines.

A wide variety of chiral non-collinear spin textures have been discovered and
have unique properties that make them highly interesting for technological
applications. However, many of these are found in complex materials and only in
a narrow window of temperature. Here, we show the formation of Neel-type
skyrmions in thin layers of simple ferromagnetic alloys, namely Co-Al and
Co-Ni-Al, over a wide range of temperature up to 770 K, by imposing a vertical
strain gradient via epitaxy with an Ir-Al underlayer. The Neel skyrmions are
directly observed using Lorentz transmission electron microscopy in
freestanding membranes at high temperatures and the strain gradient is directly
measured from x-ray diffraction anomalous peak profiles. Our concept allows
simple centrosymmetric ferromagnets with high magnetic ordering temperatures to
exhibit hot skyrmions, thereby, bringing closer skyrmionic electronics.

Understanding the chemical processes that occur during the solvothermal
synthesis of functional nanomaterials is essential for their rational design
and optimization for specific applications. However, these processes remain
poorly understood, primarily due to the limitations of conventional ex situ
characterization techniques and the technical challenges associated with in
situ studies, particularly the design and implementation of suitable reactors.
Here, we present a versatile cell suitable for in situ X-ray scattering, X-ray
spectroscopy, and infrared spectroscopy studies performed during solvothermal
synthesis under autoclave-like, inert conditions. The reactor enables precise
control of the temperature between -20 C and 200 C, pressures up to 8 bar,
magnetic stirring, and injection of gas or liquids. The reactor's capabilities
are demonstrated by comprehensively studying the solvothermal synthesis of
magnetite nanoparticles from iron acetylacetonate in benzyl alcohol through in
situ X-ray scattering and spectroscopy, and ATR-IR spectroscopy.

We use spherical neutron polarimetry to determine the ground state magnetic
structure of Mn3Sn. We find that Mn3Sn adopts an inverse triangular structure
with spins parallel to &lt;100&gt; (Type III) rather than spins parallel to &lt;110&gt;
(Type IV). Density functional theory calculations reveal no energy difference
between these two structures, suggesting that the selection is caused by subtle
effects such as sixth-order anisotropy. Partial control of the magnetic domain
population through a moderate magnetic field is key to distinguish between the
two models. We find that three of the six domains are approximately equally
populated, while the others have negligible population. Upon entering the low
temperature incommensurate phase, the domain structure is lost. The domains
decouple from the magnetic field, and can therefore not be controlled by any
known method.

LaMg2H7 is a ternary wide band gap semiconductor that is a member of the
hydride family. The bulk physical characteristics of the LaMg2H7 compound,
including its structural, electronic band structure, elastic, thermal, and
optical characteristics, have been examined in this work utilizing density
functional theory (DFT). The elastic constants indicate that {\rm LaMg}_2H_7 is
mechanically stable, brittle in nature, and anisotropic. This studied compound
possesses a moderate level of hardness. The band structure and density of
states have been examined to have a better understanding of its electronic
behavior. The intrinsic carrier concentrations and effective masses have been
determined using the band structure. The gravimetric hydrogen storage capacity
(Cwt%) has been calculated, indicating that this compound is suitable for
hydrogen storage applications. This compound is dynamically stable, as
confirmed by its phonon dispersion. Here, the details of this wide-band-gap
semiconductor's reflectivity, absorption coefficient, refractive index,
dielectric function, optical conductivity, and loss function are investigated.
The substance is a moderate reflector of ultraviolet (UV) light. The absorption
and conductivity support the gap in the band structure. The thermodynamic
properties, such as bulk modulus, internal energy, specific heat capacity,
entropy, thermal expansion coefficient, and Debye temperature, have been
explored at varying temperatures and pressures. {\rm LaMg}_2H_7 has a moderate
level of melting temperature with higher lattice thermal conductivity. The
value of the thermal expansion coefficient and minimum thermal conductivity is
highly recommended for use as a thermal barrier coating (TBC).

Unconventional magnetic materials including non-collinear antiferromagnets,
p-wave magnets and altermagnets, are an emerging frontier for quantum
spintronics and hybrid quantum devices. Critical to the application of these
materials is control over the magnetic domain state, as their unique,
symmetry-driven properties vanish in a multi-domain limit. However, the
mechanisms governing domain formation in materials with compensated local
moments remain poorly understood. In this work, we examine the ferrimagnetic to
non-collinear antiferromagnetic phase transition of Mn3NiN using scanning
nitrogen-vacancy centre magnetometry. We provide nanoscale mapping of the
magnetic domain evolution on cooling and correlate the local stray fields with
global magnetometry and anomalous Hall effect measurements. We observe the
formation of a disordered, dendritic domain structure whose roughness is
quantified using its fractal dimension. The fractal dimension steadily
increases on cooling through the transition, saturating at a value of ~ 1.55 in
the non-collinear phase, but the domain area distribution does not show any
significant changes. We show this behaviour cannot be explained by the balance
of demagnetisation energy and domain wall energy, and conclude elastic
contributions and defects are a critical factor to explain the domain size.

The development of next-generation structural materials for harsh
environments requires rapid assessment of mechanical performance and its
dependence on microstructure. While full-field crystal plasticity (CP) models
provide detailed insights, the high computational cost limits their use with
uncertainty quantification workflows and in component-scale simulation.
Surrogate models based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have shown promise
in reproducing history-dependent mechanical behaviour but are applied to models
with either fixed microstructure or representative volume elements. Here, we
develop a microstructure sensitive RNN surrogate that predicts homogenised
stress responses directly from three-dimensional grain structures and arbitrary
deformation histories. The architecture employs a gated recurrent unit (GRU)
with mappings from microstructure to both the initial hidden state and sequence
inputs, allowing the model to capture path dependence and microstructure
variability. Training data comprised of over 300,000 CP simulations generated
using combinations of randomly generated microstructures and loading paths. The
model was found to reproduce CP predictions for both in-distribution validation
data and unseen deformation modes, with errors of 2 MPa to 3 MPa.
Out-of-distribution microstructures were more difficult to predict, emphasising
the need for representative training data with, for example, heavily textured
microstructures. Embedding the model into a multiscale framework demonstrates
its ability to replace conventional constitutive updates, reducing
computational cost while preserving key features of the stress distribution.
These results establish microstructure-informed RNN surrogates as a promising
alternative to direct CP simulations, offering a pathway toward rapid
multiscale modelling and uncertainty quantification.

- **TL;DR**: 开发了一个用于3C-SiC的高斯近似势能模型(TGAP)，该模型通过双体和多体描述符训练，能够准确预测缺陷动力学和辐射损伤。

Silicon carbide (SiC) has long been a subject of study for its application in
harsh environments. Existing empirical interatomic potentials for 3C-SiC show
significant discrepancies in predicting the properties that are crucial in
describing the evolution of defects generated in collision cascades. We present
a Gaussian approximation potential model for 3C-SiC (TGAP) trained by two-body
and the turboSOAP many-body descriptors. The dataset covers crystalline, liquid
and amorphous phases. To accurately capture defect dynamics, twenty-one defect
types have been included in the dataset. TGAP captures the experimentally
observed decomposition of carbon atoms in the liquid phase at atmospheric
pressure, while also accurately reproducing the radial distribution function of
the high-temperature homogeneous liquid phase across a range of densities.
Moreover, it predicts the melting point in very good agreement with density
functional theory and experiments. The potential is equipped with the
Nordlund-Lehtola-Hobler repulsive potential to capture the high repulsion of
recoils in the collision cascades. TGAP provides an accurate tool for atomistic
simulation of radiation damage in cubic SiC.

- **TL;DR**: 螺旋位错石墨在拉伸和压缩应变下表现出异常增加的跨平面热导率，拉伸应变80%时热导率提升超过100%，优于多层石墨烯一个数量级。

The design of strain-stable, or even strain-enhanced thermal transport
materials is critical for stable operation of high-performance electronic
devices. However, most nanomaterials suffer from strain-induced degradation,
with even minor tensile strains markedly reducing thermal conductivity. Here,
we demonstrate that screw-dislocated graphites (SDGs), recently identified as
topological semimetals, display an unusual increase in cross-plane thermal
conductivity under both tensile and compressive strains, revealed by
high-accuracy machine-learning-potential-driven non-equilibrium molecular
dynamics. Notably, SDGs exhibit over 100% enhancement under tensile strains up
to 80% along the dislocation axis, arising from strain-induced increase in
dislocation interface tilt angle that elongates the effective heat transfer
paths. Their thermal conductivity surpasses multilayer graphene by an order of
magnitude. An analytical model is further derived linking thermal conductivity
to dislocation number and strain, offering a predictive framework for designing
strain-tunable screwdislocated structures. These findings highlight SDGs as a
promising platform for high-performance electronic and wearable devices with
tunable thermal properties.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究结合高质量TiO2薄膜生长和第一性原理电子-声子图蒙特卡洛方法，成功预测并验证了锐钛矿TiO2中极化子的输运特性，建立了理论-实验协同研究极化子的工作流程。

In complex oxides, charge carriers often couple strongly with lattice
vibrations to form polarons-entangled electron-phonon quasiparticles whose
transport properties remain difficult to characterize. Experimental access to
intrinsic polaronic transport requires ultraclean samples, while theoretical
descriptions demand methods beyond low-order perturbation theory. Here, we
combine the growth of high-quality oxygen-vacancy-doped anatase TiO2 films by
hybrid molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) with a first-principles electron-phonon
diagrammatic Monte Carlo (FEP-DMC) framework recently developed for accurate
polaron predictions. Our films exhibit record-high electron mobility for
anatase TiO2, in excellent agreement with FEP-DMC calculations conducted prior
to experiment, which predict a room-temperature mobility of 45 +/- 15 cm2V-1s-1
and a mobility-temperature scaling of mobility proportional to T^(-1.9 +/-
0.077). Microscopic analysis using scanning transmission electron microscopy
and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveals the role of oxygen vacancies in
modulating transport at lower temperatures. FEP-DMC further provides
quantitative insight into polaron formation energy, phonon cloud distribution,
lattice distortion around the polaron, and the polaronic contribution to
mobility. Together, these results establish a predictive theory-experiment
workflow to characterize polarons and provide a microscopic understanding of
large-polaron transport in anatase TiO2, with broader implications for complex
oxides and other polaronic materials.
