- **TL;DR**: 基于扩展经典弹性理论，提出了多晶固体的能量和状态方程的通用半经验解析表达式，通过第一性原理DFT模拟验证了这些关系在-20到300 GPa压力范围内对各种无机晶体的适用性。

On the basis of the extended classical elasticity theory, we propose
universal semi-empirical analytical expressions for the energy and the equation
of state for poly-crystalline solids. The validation of the relations has been
made by means of first principle density functional theory simulations with the
use of pseudo-potential approach and generalized gradient approximation for the
exchange-correlation energy. The calculations performed for a large number of
inorganic crystalline compounds with metal, covalent and ionic bonding
(including diamond, Mg, sphalerite, B, magnesium carboboride, topaz, rocksalt,
etc.) within the pressure range from -20 GPa to 300 GPa demonstrated an
excellent agreement with the predictions of the analytical theory. The proposed
relations can be used to describe the behavior of poly-crystalline solids at
high pressure, in particular, to predict pressure-induced phase transitions.

- **TL;DR**: 论文提出使用可学习性作为相变的通用判据，通过transformer模型从微观状态中提取结构，在二维Ising模型中验证了有序相增强的可学习性，无序相则难以学习。

Phase transitions mark qualitative reorganizations of collective behavior,
yet identifying their boundaries remains challenging whenever analytic
solutions are absent and conventional simulations fail. Here we introduce
learnability as a universal criterion, defined as the ability of a transformer
model containing attention mechanism to extract structure from microscopic
states. Using self-supervised learning and Monte Carlo generated configurations
of the two-dimensional Ising model, we show that ordered phases correspond to
enhanced learnability, manifested in both reduced training loss and structured
attention patterns, while disordered phases remain resistant to learning. Two
unsupervised diagnostics, the sharp jump in training loss and the rise in
attention entropy, recover the critical temperature in excellent agreement with
the exact value. Our results establish learnability as a data-driven marker of
phase transitions and highlight deep parallels between long-range order in
condensed matter and the emergence of structure in modern language models.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文研究了磁电效应对Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert方程的贡献，特别关注了由相邻自旋平行分量引起的介质极化情况，并与垂直分量引起的极化进行了比较。

The contribution of magnetoelectric effect to Landau--Lifshitz-Gilbert
equation is considered in case when medium polarization is caused by parallel
component of neighboring spins. The result is presented for ferromagnetic and
antiferromagnetic materials. A comparison is given with the contribution of
magnetoelectric effect to Landau--Lifshitz-Gilbert equation when medium
polarization is caused by perpendicular component of spins. The dispersion
dependence of spin waves in antiferromagnets with cycloidal equilibrium spin
order is derived. The electric susceptibility and permittivity of
antiferromagnetic multiferroics in which magnetoelectric effect is caused by
collinear component of spins is obtained analytically.

### Ultrathin bismuth-yttrium iron garnet films with tunable and compensated magnetic anisotropy

- **TL;DR**: 通过高温离轴射频磁控溅射生长了铋取代钇铁石榴石（BiYIG）纳米薄膜，实现了通过溅射参数和外延应变精确调控磁性能，获得了低阻尼、应变工程的纳米厚度BiYIG薄膜。

We report on the epitaxial growth of nm-thick films of bismuth-substituted
yttrium iron garnet (BiYIG) by high-temperature off-axis radio-frequency
magnetron sputtering. We demonstrate accurate control of the magnetic
properties by tuning of the sputtering parameters and epitaxial strain on
various (111)-oriented garnet substrates. BiYIG films with up to -0.80\%
lattice mismatch with the substrate remain fully strained up to 60~nm-thick,
maintaining a high crystalline quality. Transmission electron microscopy and
energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy confirm coherent epitaxial growth, the
absence of defects, and limited interdiffusion at the BiYIG/substrate
interface. Varying the tensile or compressive strain between -0.80\% and
+0.56\% in BiYIG allows for accurate compensation of the total magnetic
anisotropy through magneto-elastic coupling. The effective magnetic anisotropy
of sputtered BiYIG films can be further tuned via the off-axis deposition angle
and the oxygen flow during growth, which determine the cation stoichiometry.
Under optimized growth conditions, a ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) linewidth of
1~mT at 10~GHz is reliably obtained even for thicknesses as low as 10~nm. We
also report small FMR linewidths in ultrathin (2-5~nm) BiYIG films grown on
diamagnetic substrate yttrium scandium gallium garnet. These findings highlight
the promise of low-damping, strain-engineered nm-thick BiYIG films for
implementing advanced functionalities in spin-orbitronic and magnonic devices.
Specifically, the magnetic-anisotropy compensation and low damping enable large
cone-angle magnetization dynamics immune to magnon-magnon nonlinear scattering.

### Learning to predict superconductivity

- **TL;DR**: 开发了一种结合化学信息特征提取和可解释机器学习的数据驱动方法，用于预测超导转变温度Tc和分类超导材料，实现了高精度的Tc预测和材料分类。

Predicting the superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) of materials
remains a major challenge in condensed matter physics due to the lack of a
comprehensive and quantitative theory. We present a data-driven approach that
combines chemistry-informed feature extraction with interpretable machine
learning to predict $T_c$ and classify superconducting materials. We develop a
systematic featurization scheme that integrates structural and elemental
information through graphlet histograms and symmetry vectors. Using
experimentally validated structural data from the 3DSC database, we construct a
curated, featurized dataset and design a new kernel to incorporate histogram
features into Gaussian-process (GP) regression and classification. This
framework yields an interpretable $T_c$ predictor with an $ R^2$ value of 0.93
and a superconductor classifier with quantified uncertainties.
Feature-significance analysis further reveals that GP $T_c$ predictor can
achieve near-optimal performance only using four second-order graphlet
features. In particular, we discovered a previously overlooked feature of
electron affinity difference between neighboring atoms as a universally
predictive descriptor. Our graphlet-histogram approach not only highlights
bonding-related elemental descriptors as unexpectedly powerful predictors of
superconductivity but also provides a broadly applicable framework for
predictive modeling of diverse material properties.

### Analysis of divergent dynamics of exactly factorized electron-nuclear wavefunctions

- **TL;DR**: 本文分析了精确因子化(XF)方法在量子动力学中的数值不稳定性问题，特别是由于核概率密度在低密度区域趋近于零导致的除零问题。

The Exact Factorization (XF) of molecular wavefunctions can be viewed as an
'electronic wavepacket' framework for quantum dynamics. It is an appealing
alternative to the conventional non-adiabatic dynamics, unfolding in the space
of coupled electronic eigenstates. However, implementation of the non-linear XF
equations for general systems presents a formidable challenge: the XF
counterparts to the non-adiabatic coupling involve division by the nuclear
probability density, which leads to severe numerical instabilities in the
low-density regions of space. In case of the non-adiabatic dynamics the effect
of coupling is relatively smooth, but this theoretical framework becomes
impractical when numerous electronic states are involved. In this paper the
origin of the XF-specific challenge is analyzed analytically. We demonstrate
that the problem arises when the factorized wavefunction diverges, even without
the explicit coupling of the Born-Huang electronic states used to describe the
molecular wavefunction. Using a 'minimal' model of the photodissociation, we
derive expressions for the XF dynamics and locate the source of the XF
instability. We analyze the dependence of this instability on the nuclear
wavefunction bifurcation in the stationary and moving frames of reference, the
latter associated with the quantum trajectory ensemble describing the nuclear
XF wavepacket in a compact form. We show that the near-singular behavior
persists in the moving frame and in the atomic basis representation of the
electronic wavefunction. This model and insight into the root of the XF
implementation challenge will help to address the issue, leading to further
development of the XF methods.

### A Virtual Fields Method-Genetic Algorithm (VFM-GA) calibration framework for isotropic hyperelastic constitutive models with application to an elastomeric foam material

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种结合虚拟场方法和遗传算法的校准框架，用于自动识别各向同性超弹性本构模型的材料参数，该框架能够处理均匀和非均匀变形场数据，并确保材料稳定性。

This work introduces a calibration framework for material parameter
identification in isotropic hyperelastic constitutive models. The framework
synergizes the Virtual Fields Method (VFM) to define an objective function with
a Genetic Algorithm (GA) as the optimization method to facilitate automated
calibration. The formulation of the objective function uses experimental
displacement fields measured from Digital Image Correlation (DIC) synchronized
with load cell data and can accommodate data from experiments involving
homogeneous or inhomogeneous deformation fields. The framework places no
restrictions on the target isotropic hyperelastic constitutive model,
accommodating models with coupled dependencies on deformation invariants and
specialized functional forms with a number of material parameters, and assesses
material stability, eliminating sets of material parameters that potentially
lead to non-physical behavior for the target hyperelastic constitutive model.
To minimize the objective function, a GA is deployed as the optimization tool
due to its ability to navigate the intricate landscape of material parameter
space. The VFM-GA framework is evaluated by applying it to a hyperelastic
constitutive model for compressible elastomeric foams. The evaluation process
entails a number of tests that employ both homogeneous and inhomogeneous
displacement fields collected from DIC experiments on open-cell foam specimens.
The results outperform manual fitting, demonstrating the framework's robust and
efficient capability to handle material parameter identification for complex
hyperelastic constitutive models.

### Pareto-optimality of Majoranas in hybrid platforms

- **TL;DR**: 该论文系统比较了邻近化半导体纳米线和量子点链中的Majorana束缚态质量，通过多目标优化分析拓扑间隙和局域化长度之间的权衡关系，发现量子点链在实现较短局域化长度方面具有优势。

To observe Majorana bound states, and especially to use them as a qubit,
requires careful optimization of competing quality metrics. We systematically
compare Majorana quality in proximitized semiconductor nanowires and quantum
dot chains. Using multi-objective optimization, we analyze the fundamental
trade-offs between topological gap and localization length, two key metrics
that determine MBS coherence and operational fidelity. We demonstrate that
these quantities cannot be simultaneously optimized in realistic models,
creating Pareto frontiers that define the achievable parameter space. Our
results show that QD chains achieve both comparable quality as nanowires and a
regime with a much shorter localization length, making them particularly
promising for near-term quantum computing applications where device length and
disorder are limiting factors.

### Emergent spacetime supersymmetry at 2D fractionalized quantum criticality

- **TL;DR**: 该论文证明了在具有SSH自旋-声子耦合的Kitaev蜂窝模型中，分数化量子临界点处出现了时空超对称性。

While experimental evidence for spacetime supersymmetry (SUSY) in particle
physics remains elusive, condensed matter systems offer a promising arena for
its emergence at quantum critical points (QCPs). Although there have been a
variety of proposals for emergent SUSY at symmetry-breaking QCPs, the emergence
of SUSY at fractionalized QCPs remains largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate
emergent space-time SUSY at a fractionalized QCP in the Kitaev honeycomb model
with Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) spin-phonon coupling. Specifically, through
numerical computations and analytical analysis, we show that the anisotropic
SSH-Kitaev model hosts a fractionalized QCP between a Dirac spin liquid and an
incommensurate/commensurate valence-bond-solid phase coexisting with
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order. A low-energy field theory incorporating
phonon quantum fluctuations reveals that this fractionalized QCP features an
emergent $\mathcal{N}=2$ spacetime SUSY. We further discuss their universal
experimental signatures in thermal transport and viscosity, highlighting the
concrete lattice realization of emergent SUSY at a fractionalized QCP in 2D.

### Localization of information driven by stochastic resetting

- **TL;DR**: 该论文研究了在混沌动力学中加入随机重置后引发的动力学相变，发现当重置速率超过临界值时，李雅普诺夫谱会突然坍缩为零，导致信息从弹道传播转变为指数局域化。

The dynamics of extended many-body systems are generically chaotic.
Classically, a hallmark of chaos is the exponential sensitivity to initial
conditions captured by positive Lyapunov exponents. Supplementing chaotic
dynamics with stochastic resetting drives a sharp dynamical phase transition:
we show that the Lyapunov spectrum, i.e., the complete set of Lyapunov
exponents, abruptly collapses to zero above a critical resetting rate. At
criticality, we find a sudden loss of analyticity of the velocity-dependent
Lyapunov exponent, which we relate to the transition from ballistic scrambling
of information to an arrested regime where information becomes exponentially
localized over a characteristic length diverging at criticality with an
exponent $\nu = 1/2$. We illustrate our analytical results on generic chaotic
dynamics by numerical simulations of coupled map lattices.

### Magnetotransport in Topological Materials and Nonlinear Hall Effect via First-Principles Electronic Interactions and Band Topology

Topological effects arising from the Berry curvature lead to intriguing
transport signatures in quantum materials. Two such phenomena are the chiral
anomaly and nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE). A unified description of these
transport regimes requires a quantitative treatment of both band topology and
electron scattering. Here, we show accurate predictions of the
magnetoresistance in topological semimetals and NLHE in noncentrosymmetric
materials by solving the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) with
electron-phonon ($e$-ph) scattering and Berry curvature computed from first
principles. We apply our method to study magnetotransport in a prototypical
Weyl semimetal, TaAs, and the NLHE in strained monolayer WSe$_2$, bilayer
WTe$_2$ and bulk BaMnSb$_2$. In TaAs, we find a chiral contribution to the
magnetoconductance which is positive and increases with magnetic field,
consistent with experiments. We show that $e$-ph interactions can significantly
modify the Berry curvature dipole and its dependence on temperature and Fermi
level, highlighting the interplay of band topology and electronic interactions
in nonlinear transport. The computed nonlinear Hall response in BaMnSb$_2$ is
in agreement with experiments. By adding the Berry curvature to
first-principles transport calculations, our work advances the quantitative
analysis of a wide range of linear and nonlinear transport phenomena in quantum
materials.

### Measuring intrinsic relaxation rates in superconductors using nonlinear response

- **TL;DR**: 该论文讨论了超导体中的本征弛豫率及其通过非线性光学（太赫兹）响应的测量方法，包括s波和d波超导体，以及不同阻尼条件下的弛豫率分析。

We discuss intrinsic relaxation rates in superconductors, and how they may be
measured using non-linear optical (terahertz) response. We consider both $s$
and $d$-wave superconductors, both with and without a phenomenological (energy
dependent) damping. Intrinsic relaxation rates of interest include the Higgs
mode decay rate, the quasiparticle redistribution rate ($1/T_1$) and the
quasiparticle dephasing rate ($1/T_2$), where the latter two rates are zero in
the pure BCS model, but non-zero in the presence of damping. Using the Anderson
pseudospin formalism, we illustrate how these intrinsic relaxation rates are
related to measurable quantities such as the time-dependent gap function and
the non-linear current (a.k.a. third harmonic generation). Hence, we show how
intrinsic relaxation rates may be experimentally extracted and discuss what one
may thereby learn about the underlying damping. We also discuss the effects of
polarization control (viz. non-linear response to light polarized in different
directions), which offers a useful experimental knob, especially for $d$-wave
superconductors, enabling selective excitation of modes in different
irreducible representations (and readout of their corresponding relaxation
rates).

- **TL;DR**: FENDy方法通过精确因子分解分子波函数，在复杂时变势场中演化核波函数，实现了超越Born-Oppenheimer近似的全耦合量子分子动力学模拟。

Conventional theoretical and computational approaches to fully coupled
quantum molecular dynamics, i.e. when both the electrons and nuclei are treated
as quantum-mechanical particles, are impractical for all but the smallest
chemical systems. In this paper we describe the formalism and implementation of
the Factorized Electron Nuclear Dynamics (FENDy) with effective complex
potential [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 19 (2023), pp 1393-1408], which goes beyond
the established framework of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation or Born-Huang
expansion of the molecular wavefunction. This method is based on the exact
factorization of the molecular wavefunction, with the nuclei evolving under a
complex time-dependent potential which captures the key features of dynamics in
the nuclear subspace. The complementary electronic component of the molecular
wavefunction is normalized to one for all nuclear configurations. We implement
and employ FENDy to model the dynamics of H$_2^+$ molecular ion under a
femtosecond laser pulse. The electronic wavefunction is represented within the
standard electronic structure bases without referencing the electronic
eigenstates. The nuclear wavefunction is represented as a quantum-trajectory
ensemble, which in principle circumvents the exponential scaling of the
numerical cost with the system size. The challenging evaluation of the
gradients on unstructured grids is performed by projection on auxiliary bases.

Symbolic regression (SR), the automated discovery of mathematical expressions
from data, is a cornerstone of scientific inquiry. However, it is often
hindered by the combinatorial explosion of the search space and a tendency to
overfit. Popular methods, rooted in genetic programming, explore this space
syntactically, often yielding overly complex, uninterpretable models. This
paper introduces IdeaSearchFitter, a framework that employs Large Language
Models (LLMs) as semantic operators within an evolutionary search. By
generating candidate expressions guided by natural-language rationales, our
method biases discovery towards models that are not only accurate but also
conceptually coherent and interpretable. We demonstrate IdeaSearchFitter's
efficacy across diverse challenges: it achieves competitive, noise-robust
performance on the Feynman Symbolic Regression Database (FSReD), outperforming
several strong baselines; discovers mechanistically aligned models with good
accuracy-complexity trade-offs on real-world data; and derives compact,
physically-motivated parametrizations for Parton Distribution Functions in a
frontier high-energy physics application. IdeaSearchFitter is a specialized
module within our broader iterated agent framework, IdeaSearch, which is

We investigate Josephson arrays consisting of a dice-lattice network of
superconducting weak links surrounding rhombic plaquettes of proximitized
semiconductor. Josephson coupling of the weak links and electron density in the
plaquettes are independently controlled by separate electrostatic gates.
Applied magnetic flux results in an intricate pattern of switching currents
associated with frustration, $f$. For depleted plaquettes, the switching
current is nearly periodic in $f$, expected for a phase-only description, while
occupied plaquettes yield a decreasing envelope of switching currents with
increasing $f$. A model of flux dependence based on ballistic small-area
junctions and diffusive large-area plaquettes yields excellent agreement with
experiment.

### Quantizing Bosonized Fermi Surfaces

- **TL;DR**: 本文通过将一般费米面描述为U(N)_1 WZW模型的N→∞极限，解决了高维玻色化中的量子力学挑战，提供了研究费米面动力学幂律修正的系统工具。

Bosonization describes Fermi surface dynamics in terms of a collective field
that lives on a part of phase space. While sensible semiclassically, the
challenge of treating such a field quantum mechanically has prevented
bosonization from providing as powerful a nonperturbative tool as in one
dimension. We show that general Fermi surfaces can be exactly described by a
particular $N\to \infty$ limit of a $U(N)_1$ WZW model, with a tower of
irrelevant corrections. This matrix-valued description encodes the
noncommutative nature of phase space, and its (solvable) strongly coupled
dynamics resolves the naive overcounting of degrees of freedom of the
collective field without the need to cut the Fermi surface into patches. This
approach furthermore provides a quantitative tool to systematically study
power-law corrections to Fermi surface dynamics.

### Thermodynamically Consistent Continuum Theory of Magnetic Particles in High-Gradient Fields

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一个热力学一致的连续介质理论，用于描述高梯度磁场中磁性颗粒的集体输运和捕获行为，统一了磁性、质量输运和动量平衡。

Magnetic particles underpin a broad range of technologies, from water
purification and mineral processing to bioseparations and targeted drug
delivery. The dynamics of magnetic particles in high-gradient magnetic
fields-encompassing both their transport and eventual capture-arise from the
coupled interplay of field-driven drift, fluid advection, and particle-field
feedback. These processes remain poorly captured by existing models relying on
empirical closures or discrete particle tracking. Here, we present a
thermodynamically consistent continuum theory for collective magnetic particle
transport and capture in high-gradient fields. The framework derives from a
free-energy functional that couples magnetic energy, entropic mixing, and
steric interactions, yielding a concentration-dependent susceptibility via
homogenization theory. The resulting equations unify magnetism, mass transport,
and momentum balances without ad hoc shut-off criteria, allowing field
shielding, anisotropic deposition, and boundary-layer confinement to emerge
naturally. Simulations predict canonical capture morphologies-axially aligned
plumes, crescent-shaped deposits, and nonlinear shielding-across field
strengths and flow regimes, consistent with trends reported in prior
experimental and modeling studies. By organizing captured particle mass data
into a dimensionless phase diagram based on the Mason number, we reveal three
distinct regimes-thermodynamically controlled, transitional, and dynamically
controlled. This perspective provides a predictive platform for in silico
optimization and extension to three-dimensional geometries, and informing
digital twin development for industrial-scale high-gradient magnetic separation
processes.

and academic research into Cr-doped UO2 are analyzed and their shortcomings are
critiqued. Focusing on the incorporation mechanisms of Cr into the fuel matrix,
we explore a mechanistic understanding of the characteristic properties of
Cr-doped UO2, notably, enhanced fission gas retention attributed to enlarged
grain sizes following sintering, along with marginal improvements in the
thermophysical properties. The findings of recent X-ray Adsorption Near Edge
Spectroscopy studies were compared and put into conversation with historic data
regarding the incorporation of Cr in UO2. On the basis of defect mechanisms,
the case is made for the substitutional incorporation of Cr governing the
lattice solubility but not the enhanced U diffusivity. Instead, Cr/Cr2O3 redox
chemistry in a well-defined oxygen potential explains the differences in the U
diffusivity and O/M ratio. The primary mechanism of doping-enhanced grain
growth is found to be liquid assisted sintering due to a CrO(l) eutectic phase
at the grain boundaries. The role of inhomogeneities in Cr concentration in UO2
at various length scales across the materials microstructure is highlighted and
connected to promising experimental and modeling work to fill in the gaps in
the current understanding of Cr-doped UO2. The review ends with an outline of
future works that combine meticulous irradiation studies and high resolution
experiments with next generation modeling and simulations techniques empowered
by machine learning advances to accelerate the fabrication and adoption of
Cr-doped UO2 light water reactors.

This review is based on lectures given by the author at the Enrico Fermi
Summer School in Varenna. It presents the basics of Density Functional Theory
(DFT) for Fermi superfluids, with particular emphasis on nuclear systems.
Special attention is given to the foundations of both DFT and time-dependent
DFT (TDDFT). The review explores the advantages and challenges involved in the
practical application of TDDFT to superfluid systems, as well as the typical
approximations employed. Various applications of the TDDFT framework to the
description of phenomena related to nonequilibrium superfluidity in atomic
nuclei, neutron stars, and ultracold atoms are discussed.

Understanding molecular structure, dynamics, and reactivity requires bridging
processes that occur across widely separated time scales. Conventional
molecular dynamics simulations provide atomistic resolution, but their
femtosecond time steps limit access to the slow conformational changes and
relaxation processes that govern chemical function. Here, we introduce a deep
generative modeling framework that accelerates sampling of molecular dynamics
by four orders of magnitude while retaining physical realism. Applied to small
organic molecules and peptides, the approach enables quantitative
characterization of equilibrium ensembles and dynamical relaxation processes
that were previously only accessible by costly brute-force simulation.
Importantly, the method generalizes across chemical composition and system
size, extrapolating to peptides larger than those used for training, and
captures chemically meaningful transitions on extended time scales. By
expanding the accessible range of molecular motions without sacrificing
atomistic detail, this approach opens new opportunities for probing
conformational landscapes, thermodynamics, and kinetics in systems central to
chemistry and biophysics.

Altermagnets have recently garnered significant interest due to their
vanishing net magnetic moment and non-relativistic momentum-dependent spin
splitting. However, altermagnetic (AM) multiferroics especially triferroics
remain scarce. We investigate the experimentally synthesized non-van der Waals
CrSb as a model system to explore the effects of dimensionality and facet
orientation on its ferroic properties. NiAs, MnP, wurtzite (WZ), zincblende
(ZB), and rocksalt (RS) phases are considered. Using first-principles
calculations, we predict the altermagnetism of CrSb in MnP phase which has
comparable stability with experimental NiAs phase. Both NiAs- and MnP-phase
(110) facets exhibit AM-ferroelastic (FC) biferroics, while the WZ-phase bulk
and (001) facets host ferromagnetic (FM) or AM-ferroelectric (FE) biferroics.
Notably, the WZ-phase (110) facets are identified as FM/AM-FE-FC triferroics,
with moderate energy barriers of 0.129 and 0.363 eV atom-1 for FE and FC
switching, respectively. Both FE and FC switching can reverse the AM spin
splitting in antiferromagnetic (AFM) configurations while preserving the high
spin polarization in FM states. The magnetic anisotropy is highly tunable,
exhibiting either uniaxial or in-plane behavior depending on the phase,
dimension, and facet. This work establishes a framework for designing AM
multiferroics through polymorphic, dimensional, and facet engineering, offering
promising avenues for multifunctional spintronic applications.

### Quantum Filtering of Hydrogen Isotopes through Graphene

Driven by the growing demand in the energy, medical, and industrial sectors,
we investigate a hydrogen isotope separation technique that offers both a high
separation factor and economic feasibility. Our findings reveal that filtering
isotopes through two-dimensional graphene layers provides an exceptionally
efficient quantum-mechanical method for isotope separation. Using a recently
developed analytical pairwise potential between hydrogen isotopes and carbon
atoms in graphene, we examine the classical trajectories of isotopes near the
graphene layer, as well as the quantum-mechanical tunneling properties of
isotopes through the graphene layer. Using various quantum-mechanical methods,
we calculate both the isotope tunneling probabilities and the
quantum-mechanical isotope sticking probabilities. Our study shows that quantum
filtering through graphene layers can be an effective technique for enriching
deuterium by separating it from protium.

### Surface band-selective moiré effect induces flat band in mixed-dimensional heterostructures

In this work, we reveal a curious type of moir\'e effect that selectively
modifies the surface states of bulk crystal. We synthesize mixed-dimensional
heterostructures consisting of a noble gas monolayer grow on the surface of
bulk Bi(111), and determine the electronic structure of the heterostructures
using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. We directly observe moir\'e
replicas of the Bi(111) surface states, while the bulk states remain barely
changed. Meanwhile, we achieve control over the moir\'e period in the range of
25 {\AA} to 80 {\AA} by selecting monolayers of different noble gases and
adjusting the annealing temperature. At large moir\'e periods, we observe
hybridization between the surface band replicas, which leads to the formation
of a correlated flat band. Our results serve as a bridge for understanding the
moir\'e modulation effect from 2D to 3D systems, and provide a feasible
approach for the realization of correlated phenomena through the engineering of
surface states via moir\'e effects.

### What is the most optimal diffusion?

- **TL;DR**: 该论文研究了在固定Kullback-Leibler散度变化率约束下的最快扩散过程，推导出一个最大化微分熵的非局部方程，并证明正态分布和指数分布是其解，扩散过程高度异常。

What is the fastest possible "diffusion"? A trivial answer would be "a
process that converts a Dirac delta-function into a uniform distribution
infinitely fast". Below, we consider a more reasonable formulation: a process
that maximizes differential entropy of a probability density function (pdf)
$f(\vec{x}, t)$ at every time $t$, under certain restrictions. Specifically, we
focus on a case when the rate of the Kullback-Leibler divergence
$D_{\text{KL}}$ is fixed. If $\Delta(\vec{x}, t, d{t}) = \frac{\partial f}{
\partial t} d{t}$ is the pdf change at a time step $d{t}$, we maximize the
differential entropy $H[f + \Delta]$ under the restriction $D_{\text{KL}}(f +
\Delta || f) = A^2 d{t}^2$, $A = \text{const} &gt; 0$. It leads to the following
equation: $\frac{\partial f}{ \partial t} = - \kappa f (\ln{f} - \int f \ln{f}
d{\vec{x}})$, with $\kappa = \frac{A}{\sqrt{ \int f \ln^2{f} d{\vec{x}} -
\left( \int f \ln{f} d{\vec{x}} \right)^2 } }$. Notably, this is a non-local
equation, so the process is different from the It\^{o} diffusion and a
corresponding Fokker-Planck equation. We show that the normal and exponential
distributions are solutions to this equation, on $(-\infty; \infty)$ and $[0;
\infty)$, respectively, both with $\text{variance} \sim e^{2 A t}$, i.e.
diffusion is highly anomalous. We numerically demonstrate for sigmoid-like
functions on a segment that the entropy change rate $\frac{d H}{d t}$ produced
by such an optimal "diffusion" is, as expected, higher than produced by the
"classical" diffusion.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种使用h-BN作为覆盖层和Cu(111)作为基底的纳米限制设置，通过STM技术解析二维冰的原子级结构，解决了传统技术的局限性。

Water, a ubiquitous and fundamental substance, plays a critical role across a
wide range of disciplines from physics and chemistry to biology and
engineering. Despite theoretical predictions of several phases of
two-dimensional (2D) ice confined between idealized hydrophobic walls,
experimental validation has been limited to the square phase, whose structural
origin remains controversial. Here, we propose a realistic nanoconfinement
setup using wide-bandgap hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) as the capping layer
and Cu(111) as the substrate. This protocol enables scanning tunneling
microscope (STM) to resolve the atomic-scale arrangement of water molecules
beneath the h-BN layer, overcoming the limitations of conventional techniques.
Simulated STM images unambiguously identify all ordered flat 2D ice phases, as
well as coexisting phases, and effectively distinguish them from potential
contaminants. These findings establish a robust framework for experiment to
systematically probe the phase structures of 2D ice, opening an avenue for
studying nanoconfined water under ambient conditions.

- **TL;DR**: 本文系统研究了二维d波金属交变磁体中几种对密度波态的本征超导二极管效应效率，发现交变磁材料为有限动量超导性提供了良好平台，可优化二极管效率。

We systematically study the efficiency of the intrinsic superconducting diode
effect of several pair-density-wave states that can emerge in two-dimensional
$d$-wave metallic altermagnets. To this end, we investigate several scenarios
using an effective minimal microscopic model and Ginzburg-Landau analysis in
order to derive the corresponding pairing phase diagrams. In addition, we
examine also whether the presence of a Rashba spin-orbit coupling and an
applied external magnetic field are beneficial to this effect in these systems.
As a consequence, our results add further support to the fact that
altermagnetic materials indeed provide a good platform for the pursuit of
finite-momentum superconductivity, which can lead to an optimization of the
diode efficiency in some physically interesting situations. The latter
phenomenon has been recently proposed to be key in improving the applicability
of new energy-efficient quantum electronic devices.

The role of graphene nanowindows in the nanohydroxyapatite bone scaffold
preparation is important for the preparation of mechanically robust scaffolds
and implementation in bone recovery. Here, we report a
graphene-nanohydroxyapatite (G-nHAP) scaffold synthesized by the hydrothermal
method, along with its formation mechanism and promising in vivo applications.
The G-nHAP scaffold exhibits excellent mechanical strength comparable to that
of cancellous bone. The nHAP was grown on 2D layers of graphene with
nanowindows. The role of nanowindows was to attract electrostatically Ca2+,
PO43+, and OH- precursors of nHAP, forming a layered structure of G-nHAP, in
which nHAP nanorods of 23.8 nm in diameter and 84.7 nm in length were placed
between graphene layers, as evidenced with molecular dynamic simulations. In
vivo study showed mature and mineralized bone and osteoid after six weeks. This
demonstrates the role of graphene nanowindows in the formation of nHAP
scaffolds that are promising for future implementation in bone tissue
regeneration.

### Modulating thermal conductivity of bulk BAs based on targeted phonon excitation

- **TL;DR**: 提出可逆声子激发策略动态调控砷化硼热导率，在电子学和热电学应用中实现热导率的主动控制

This study proposes a reversible phonon excitation strategy to dynamically
modulate the thermal conductivity of boron arsenide (BAs), addressing the
opposing thermal conductivity requirements in electronics and thermoelectrics.
Using first-principles calculations and Boltzmann transport equation, we
demonstrate that selective excitation of specific phonon modes enables active
control over thermal transport. At an excitation multiplier of 25, the thermal
conductivity of BAs can be enhanced by up to 2% or suppressed by up to 35%
relative to its intrinsic value of 2235 W m^-1 K^-1. At a lower multiplier of
5, thermal conductivity can be increased by 2% or decreased by 11%. The
modulation effect depends on excitation frequency, multiplier, and intrinsic
phonon properties, with certain frequencies exhibiting opposite trends under
different excitation intensities. Mechanistic analysis shows that at low
excitation levels, phonon splitting suppresses Umklapp scattering, reducing the
scattering rate, while at high levels, it enhances Normal scattering,
increasing the scattering rate. This approach offers a dynamic and reversible
route to tuning thermal conductivity, with applications in thermal management
and thermoelectric energy conversion.

Recent progress in the study of spin-wave propagation in ferromagnetic
waveguides has highlighted the role of nonreciprocity arising from both the
interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and the chiral nature of dipolar
interactions. In this paper, we examine how a nanowire with a crescent-shaped
cross-section affects spin-wave propagation along its long axis when a bias
magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the axis. Employing micromagnetic
simulations supported by analytical modeling, we systematically analyze the
effects of geometry and external magnetic field strength on the magnetization
dynamics and spin-wave amplitude distribution. The results demonstrate that
these factors modify the dispersion relation of spin waves and influence its
nonreciprocity, which can vary depending on the mode type. This work advances
the fundamental understanding of spin-wave dynamics in curved geometries and
offers new perspectives for designing magnonic waveguides with tailored
properties.

### Chiral Edge Excitations of Fractional Chern Insulators

- **TL;DR**: 本文通过数值模拟证明，在离散晶格上的ν=1/2分数陈绝缘体具有与手性Luttinger液体理论预测一致的边缘激发谱，建立了晶格系统与连续分数量子霍尔系统之间的对应关系。

Edge excitations are the defining signature of chiral topologically ordered
systems. In continuum fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states, these excitations
are described by the chiral Luttinger liquid ($\chi$LL) theory. Whether this
effective description remains valid for fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) on
discrete lattices has been a longstanding open question. Here we numerically
demonstrate that the charge-one edge spectral function of a $\nu=1/2$ FCI on an
infinitely long strip with width $L_y=10$ quantitatively follows the
predictions of $\chi$LL theory. The edge spectrum is gapless, chiral, and
linear, with spectral weight increasing linearly with both momentum and energy.
We further analyze the influence of lattice size, particle number, trapping
potential, and charge sector of excitations on the edge properties. Our results
establish a clear correspondence between lattice FCIs and continuum FQH systems
and provide guidance for future experimental detection of chiral edge modes.

State transitions are fundamental in biological systems but challenging to
observe directly. Here, we present the first single-cell observation of state
transitions in a synthetic bacterial genetic circuit. Using a mother machine,
we tracked over 1007 cells for 27 hours. First-passage analysis and dynamical
reconstruction reveal that transitions occur outside the small-noise regime,
challenging the applicability of classical Kramers' theory. The process lacks a
single characteristic rate, questioning the paradigm of transitions between
discrete cell states. We observe significant multiplicative noise that distorts
the effective potential landscape yet increases transition times. These
findings necessitate theoretical frameworks for biological state transitions
beyond the small-noise assumption.

NbRe is a non-centrosymmetric superconductor that has been proposed as a
candidate for intrinsic spin-triplet pairing. However, a conclusive
demonstration of triplet pairing in NbRe is yet to be found. To probe the
presence of equal-spin triplet Cooper pairs, we fabricated Py/NbRe/Py trilayers
capped with an antiferromagnetic layer. Magnetic and electrical measurements
reveal an inverse spin-valve effect, which could indicate equal-spin triplet
superconductivity. The minimal sample structure and the lack of ad hoc
engineered interfaces clearly associate our observation to intrinsic triplet
correlations of NbRe. The availability of NbRe in thin-film form and the
simplicity of the heterostructure highlight its potential as a scalable
platform for superconducting spintronics.

### The Effect of Chlorine Substitution on Rotational Speed and Light Absorption of Second Generation Molecular Motors

- **TL;DR**: 研究氯原子和三氯甲基取代对光驱动分子马达旋转速度和吸收峰分离的影响，发现三氯甲基取代比三氟甲基更能加速旋转，而氯原子取代会抑制旋转。

The effect of substituting a hydrogen atom by a chlorine atom or a methyl
group by a trichloromethyl (CCl3) group at the stereogenic center of
light-driven second generation molecular motors is calculated in order to
assess the effect on rotational speed and the separation of the absorption
peaks of the isomers. While experimental and theoretical studies have
previously been carried out for fluorine substitution, this is the first study
of chlorine substitution. Five well-characterized base molecules are studied
and the trends are compared with the effect of fluorine substitution. The
trichloromethyl substitution is found to accelerate the rotation more than a
trifluoromethyl (CF3) substitution by reducing the life-time of the metastable
state, due to larger steric hindrance in the metastable state than in the
transition state for the thermal helix inversion (THI). A larger increase in
the separation of the absorption peaks of the two isomers is also obtained. The
Cl atom substitution, however, changes the energy landscape significantly,
making the M isomer lower in energy than the P isomer, and raising the energy
barrier for THI beyond that of the back transition, thus quenching the
rotation.

Perovskite oxides are promising for energy and quantum technologies, but
wide-gap hosts such as NaAlO3 suffer from deep-UV absorption and limited
carrier transport. Using first-principles GGA+U+SOC calculations, we
investigate Eu3+-, Gd3+-, and Tb3+-doped NaAlO3 and evaluate their electronic,
optical, elastic, and thermoelectric properties. Rare-earth substitution is
thermodynamically favorable (formation energies 1.2-1.6 eV) and induces strong
f-p hybridization, reducing the pristine band gap (about 6.2 eV) to about 3.1
eV for Tb. Spin-resolved band structures reveal Gd-driven half-metallicity,
Eu-induced spin-selective metallicity, and Tb-stabilized p-type semiconducting
behavior. The optical spectra show a red-shifted absorption edge (about 2.0-2.2
eV), a large static dielectric response (epsilon1(0) about 95 for Eu), and
plasmonic resonances near 4 eV, enabling visible-light harvesting. Elastic
analysis indicates mild lattice softening with preserved ductility (Pugh ratio
B/G about 1.56-1.57). Thermoelectric performance is enhanced, with Seebeck
coefficients greater than 210 uV/K for Eu and Tb and ZT about 0.45 at 500 K.
These results identify rare-earth-doped NaAlO3 as a multifunctional perovskite
platform for photovoltaics, photocatalysis, thermoelectrics, and spintronics.

We revisit the phenomenological Dzyaloshinskii framework, a central
theoretical approach for describing magnetization processes in bulk chiral
magnets, and demonstrate how magnetocrystalline cubic anisotropy reshapes the
phase diagrams of states and provides the key mechanism stabilizing
low-temperature skyrmion phases. We show that, for magnetic field directions
along the easy anisotropy axes, the phase diagrams feature stable skyrmion
pockets for both signs of the anisotropy constant. We further analyze the
nature of the transitions at the critical field $H_{c1}$, associated with the
reorientation of stable and metastable spirals along the field. We also examine
the transition at $H_{c2}$, where the conical state closes into the homogeneous
state accompanied by a deviation of the wave vector from the field direction.
By mapping characteristic anisotropy-dependent parameters in the theoretical
phase diagrams, we provide guidelines for connecting theory with experiment and
for estimating the cubic anisotropy constant in Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$Si and MnSi.
Our results indicate that samples Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$Si with small $x \sim 0.1$
possess sufficiently strong cubic anisotropy to stabilize a low-temperature
skyrmion phase. Overall, these theoretical findings establish a quantitative
framework for predicting and interpreting skyrmion stability in other cubic
helimagnets as well.

Fractional quantum Hall states are promising platforms for topological
quantum computation due to their capacity to encode quantum information in
topologically degenerate ground states and in the fusion space of non-abelian
anyons. We investigate how the information encoded in two paradigmatic states,
the Laughlin and Moore-Read states, is affected by density decoherence --
coupling of local charge density to non-thermal noise. We identify a critical
filling factor $\nu_c$, above which the quantum information remains fully
recoverable for arbitrarily strong decoherence. The $\nu=1/3$ Laughlin state
and $\nu = 1/2$ Moore-Read state both lie within this range. Below $\nu_c$ both
classes of states undergo a decoherence induced
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thousless (BKT) transition into a critical decohered
phase. For Laughlin states, information encoded in the topological ground state
manifold degrades continuously with decoherence strength inside this critical
phase, vanishing only in the limit of infinite decoherence strength. On the
other hand, quantum information encoded in the fusion space of non-abelian
anyons of the Moore-Read states remains fully recoverable for arbitrary strong
decoherence even beyond the BKT transition. These results lend further support
to the promise of non-Abelian FQH states as platforms for topological quantum
computation and raises the question of how errors in such states can be
corrected.

### Phase Transitions Without Instability: A Universal Mechanism from Non-Normal Dynamics

- **TL;DR**: 该论文发现了一种新的相变普适性类别，源于非正规系统的瞬态放大效应，挑战了传统相变需要特征值不稳定性的经典观点。

We identify a new universality class of phase transitions that arises in
non-normal systems, challenging the classical view that transitions require
eigenvalue instabilities. In traditional bifurcation theory, critical phenomena
emerge when spectral stability is lost; here, we show that transitions can
occur even when all equilibria are spectrally stable. The key mechanism is the
transient amplification induced by non-orthogonal eigenvectors: noise-driven
dynamics are enhanced not by lowering energy barriers, but by increasing the
effective shear of the flow, which renormalizes fluctuations and acts as an
emergent temperature. Once the non-normality index $\kappa$ exceeds a critical
threshold $\kappa_c$, stable equilibria lose practical relevance, enabling
escapes and abrupt transitions despite preserved spectral stability. This
pseudo-criticality generalizes Kramers' escape beyond potential barriers,
providing a fundamentally new route to critical phenomena. Its implications are
broad: in biology, DNA methylation dynamics reconcile long-term epigenetic
memory with rapid stochastic switching; in climate, ecology, finance, and
engineered networks, abrupt tipping points can arise from the same mechanism.
By demonstrating that phase transitions can emerge from non-normal
amplification rather than eigenvalue instabilities, we introduce a predictive,
compact framework for sudden transitions in complex systems, establishing
non-normality as a defining principle of a new universality class of phase
transitions.

### Odd-frequency Pairing in Josephson Junctions Coupled by Magnetic Textures

Josephson junctions coupled through magnetic textures provide a controllable
platform for odd-frequency superconductivity and Majorana physics. Within a
tight-binding Green function framework, induced pair correlations and spectral
properties are analyzed under various magnetic and geometric conditions. When
the junction is in the topologically trivial regime, even-frequency singlet
pairing is dominant, whereas the topological phase is characterized by the
coexistence of Majorana bound states and robust odd-frequency equal-spin
triplet pairing at the interface edges. The odd-frequency polarized triplets
reveal a divergent $1/\omega$ behavior when the Majorana states are decoupled,
which is intrinsically connected to their self-conjugation property. The
zero-frequency divergence evolves into shifted resonances and linear
low-frequency behavior once hybridization occurs. A nonmagnetic interruption in
the texture separates the topological superconductor into two topological
segments and generates additional inner Majorana modes. When the nonmagnetic
barrier is comparable to the inner Majorana states localization length, they
hybridize and modify their associated odd-frequency triplet pairing, while the
outer edge modes preserve their self-conjugated nature. Tuning the
superconducting phase difference further controls the onset of the topological
regime and the stability of localized Majorana states. The results highlight
the central role of odd-frequency triplet correlations as a probe of
topological superconductivity in magnetically engineered Josephson junctions.

### Thermoelectric Enhancement of Series-Connected Cross-Conjugated Molecular Junctions

- **TL;DR**: 该论文研究了由无环交叉共轭分子组成的单分子结的热电响应，发现增加重复单元数量会导致分裂节点谱，从而显著增强热电功率，这种量子增强机制优于其他干涉机制。

We investigate the thermoelectric response of single-molecule junctions
composed of acyclic cross-conjugated molecules, including dendralene analogues
and related iso-poly(diacetylene) (iso-PDA) motifs, in which node-possessing
repeat units are connected in series. Using many-body quantum transport theory,
we show that increasing the number of repeat units leaves the fundamental gap
essentially unchanged while giving rise to a split-node spectrum whose
cumulative broadening dramatically enhances the thermopower. This form of
quantum enhancement can exceed other interference-based mechanisms, such as the
coalescence of nodes into a supernode, suggesting new opportunities for
scalable quantum-interference-based materials. Although illustrated here with
cross-conjugated systems, the underlying principles apply broadly to
series-connected architectures hosting multiple interference nodes. Finally, we
evaluate the scaling of the electronic figure of merit ZT and the maximum
thermodynamic efficiency. Together, these results highlight the potential for
split-node-based materials to realize quantum-enhanced thermoelectric response.

### Superconducting meander-line surface coil for NMR spectroscopy of nanoscale thin films

Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a powerful technique to
study local magnetism in a variety of materials. However, the inherently low
sensitivity of conventional inductively detected solid state NMR typically
requires a large number of spins, reducing its applicability to two-dimensional
(2D) materials and nanoscale thin films. To overcome this experimental
challenge, we introduce a novel probe based on a superconducting meander-line
surface coil that significantly enhances the NMR sensitivity for thin samples.
Using a NbN meander with an optimized geometry, we demonstrate the sensitivity
of this technique by detecting the NMR signal of a 150-nm-thick boron film
containing only $\sim 2\times10^{16}$ $^{11}$B nuclear spins. Spin-echo
measurements and theoretical modeling offer insight into the parameters
limiting the coil's performance. This work lays the foundation for developing
highly sensitive NMR probes, potentially unlocking new opportunities for
studying atomically thin materials.

- **TL;DR**: 本文获得了在弛豫时间近似下，受任意时间依赖均匀电场驱动的单带紧束缚系统的电流响应的解析解，并分析了耗散对高次谐波产生和Esaki-Tsu方程的影响。

The theory of open quantum systems is one of the most essential tools for the
development of quantum technologies. A particular area of interest is in the
optical response of solid state systems, where dissipation is introduced
phenomenologically through the relaxation time approximation and its effects
are usually gauged perturbatively. Analytical exact results for driven systems
under this approximation are scarce and tipically pertain only to the
stationary regime. Here, we obtain the analytical solution for the current
response of general single-band tight-binding system driven by a uniform
electric field with generic time-dependence under the relaxation time
approximation. We explore the effects of dissipation in two limiting cases: A
monochromatic field, where we analytically deduce the effect of dissipation on
High Harmonic Generation, and a constant electric field, where a generalization
for the Esaki-Tsu equation is presented for any single-band tight-binding
system. We specify the results for a simple 2D nearest neighbours tight-binding
lattice to emphasize the effect of the scale competition introduced by the two
different neighbours in both the monochromatic and constant field cases.
Finally, we compare our exact result for the constant field to the one obtained
from the usual perturbation theory calculation to probe the validity of the
latter.

### Higher-order epitaxy: A pathway to suppressing structural instability and emergent superconductivity

Molecular beam epitaxy enables the growth of thin film materials with novel
properties and functionalities. Typically, the lattice constants of films and
substrates are designed to match to minimise disorders and strains. However,
significant lattice mismatches can result in higher-order epitaxy, where
commensurate growth occurs with a period defined by integer multiples of the
lattice constants. Despite its potential, higher-order epitaxy is rarely used
to enhance material properties or induce emergent phenomena. Here, we report
single-crystalline FeTe films grown via 6:5 commensurate higher-order epitaxy
on CdTe(001) substrates. Scanning transmission electron microscopy reveals
self-organised periodic interstitials near the interface, arising from
higher-order lattice matching. Synchrotron x-ray diffraction shows that the
tetragonal-to-monoclinic structural transition in bulk FeTe is strongly
suppressed. Remarkably, these films exhibit substrate-selective two-dimensional
superconductivity, likely due to suppressed monoclinic distortion. These
findings demonstrate the potential of higher-order epitaxy as a tool to control
materials and inducing emergent phenomena.

### Electronic structures and superconductivity in Nd-doped La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$

- **TL;DR**: 通过DFT和RMFT研究Nd掺杂La3Ni2O7，发现70% Nd掺杂时Tc达到峰值，这源于层间超交换耦合增强与粒子密度减少之间的竞争。

The recent discovery of high-$T_c$ superconductivity in Ruddlesden-Popper
(RP) nickelates has motivated extensive efforts to explore higher $T_c$
superconductors. Here, we systematically investigate Nd-doped La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$
using density functional theory (DFT) and renormalized mean-field theory
(RMFT). DFT calculations reveal that both the lattice constants and interlayer
spacing decrease upon Nd substitution, similar to the effect of physical
pressure. However, the in-plane Ni-O-Ni bond angle evolves non-monotonically
with doping, increasing to a maximum at 70% (~2/3) Nd doping level and then
falling sharply at 80%, which leads to a reduction in orbital overlap.
Moreover, Nd doping has a more pronounced effect on the Ni-$d{_{z^2}}$ orbital,
demonstrating an orbital-dependent effect of rare-earth substitution. Through
the bilayer two-orbital t-J model, RMFT analysis further shows an $s\pm$-wave
pairing symmetry, with $T_c$ rising to a maximum at about 70% Nd substitution
before declining, in agreement with the transport measurements. The variation
in $T_c$ can be traced to the competition between continuously enhanced
interlayer superexchange coupling $J_\perp^z$ and a gradual decrease in
particle density. These results highlight the delicate interplay among
structural tuning, orbital hybridization, and superconductivity, providing
important clues to design higher-$T_c$ RP nickelate superconductors.

The canonical distribution of Gibbs is extended to the case of systems
outside equilibrium. The distribution of probabilities of a discrete energy
levels system is used to provide a microscopic definition of work, along with a
microscopic definition of the uncompensated heat of Clausius involved in
nonequilibrium processes. The later is related to the presence of
non-conservatives forces with regards to the variation of the external
parameters. This new framework is used to investigate the nonequilibrium
relations in stochastic thermodynamics. A new relation is derived for the
random quantity of heat associated to the nonequilibrium work protocol. We
finally show that the distributions of probabilities of work, heat and
uncompensated heat are non-independent each other during a nonequilibrium
process.

### Magnon-mediated Radiation and Phonon-driven Quenching of Excitons in a Layered Semiconductor

Layered van der Waals (vdW) magnetic semiconductors open a new avenue for
exploring intertwined excitonic and magnetic phenomena. Here, we investigate
this interplay in the vdW MnPS3 antiferromagnet, uncovering an exceptionally
long exciton lifetime (~100 {\mu}s) below the N\'eel temperature (T_N). We
demonstrate that the exciton lifetime is governed by phonon-mediated
nonradiative recombination and thus exhibits a strong temperature dependence.
On the contrary, the radiative recombination rate shows a distinct temperature
dependence, which is dominated by magnon-assisted emission mechanism below T_N
and by short-range spin correlations and phonons above T_N. These findings not
only establish MnPS3 as a compelling candidate for excitonic devices due to its
long-lifetime and correlation with magnetic orders but also provide crucial
insights into the interplay between excitons, spins, and lattice in vdW
magnetic semiconductors.

The results of numerical simulation using a modified Monte Carlo method with
a heat bath algorithm for the pseudospin model of cuprates are presented. The
temperature phase diagrams are constructed for various degrees of doping and
for various parameters of the model, and the effect of local correlations on
the critical temperatures of the model cuprate is investigated. It is shown
that, in qualitative agreement with the results of the mean field, the heat
bath algorithm leads to a significant decrease in the estimate of critical
temperatures due to more complete accounting of fluctuations, and also makes it
possible to detect phase inhomogeneous states. The possibility of using machine
learning to accelerate the heat bath algorithm is discussed.

### Phase-controlled quantum transport signatures in a quantum dot-Majorana hybrid ring system

We investigate the quantum transport in a hybrid ring system consisting of a
quantum dot (QD) coupled to two Majorana bound states (MBSs) hosted in a
topological superconducting nanowire, threaded by a magnetic flux. Utilizing
the dissipaton equation-of-motion approach, we demonstrate that the
differential conductance shows periodic behavior and its periodicity depends on
both the QD energy level and the MBS overlapping. A zero-bias peak (ZBP)
emerges as a result of the balance between normal and anomalous tunneling
processes, associated with the presence of a single MBS. Beyond the
phase-dependent periodic behavior, the shot noise exhibits voltage-dependent
transitions between sub-Poissonian ($F = 0.5$), Poissonian ($F = 1$), and
super-Poissonian ($F &gt; 1$) regimes. Strikingly, we find a giant Fano factor
($F\gg1$) emerging at the balance point, accompanied by a peak in the shot
noise. This distinctive feature may serve as a supplementary signature for MBS
detection. However, both ZBP in the differential conductance and shot noise
peak are degraded by thermal effects.

We study magnon-plasmon coupling in effectively two-dimensional stacks of van
der Waals layers in the context of the band structure topology. Invoking the
quasiparticle approximation, we show that the magnetic dipole coupling between
the plasmons in a metallic layer and the magnons in a neighboring magnetic
layer gives rise to a Berry curvature. As a result, the hybrid quasiparticles
acquire an anomalous velocity, leading to intrinsic anomalous thermal Hall and
spin-Nernst effects in ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. We propose magnetic
layers supporting skyrmion crystals as a platform to realize chiral
magnon-plasmon edge states, inviting the notion of topological
magnon-plasmonics.

We study single-variable approaches for describing stochastic dynamics with
small inertia. The basic models we deal with describe passive Brownian
particles and phase elements (phase oscillators, rotators, superconducting
Josephson junctions) with an effective inertia in the case of a linear
dissipation term and active Brownian particles in the case of a nonlinear
dissipation. Elimination of a fast variable (velocity) reduces the
characterization of the system state to a single variable and is formulated in
four representations: moments, cumulants, the basis of Hermite functions, and
the formal cumulant variant of the last. This elimination provides rigorous
mathematical description for the overdamped limit in the case of linear
dissipation and the overactive limit of active Brownian particles. For the
former, we derive a low-dimensional equation system which generalizes the
Ott-Antonsen Ansatz to systems with small effective inertia. In the latter
case, we derive a Fokker-Planck-type equation with a forced drift term and an
effective diffusion in one dimension, where the standard two-/three-dimensional
mechanism is impossible. In the four considered representations, truncated
equation chains are demonstrated to be utilitary for numerical simulation for a
small finite inertia.

Moir\'e superlattices in twisted bilayers enable profound reconstructions of
the electronic bandstructure, giving rise to correlated states with remarkable
tunability. Extending this paradigm to van der Waals magnets, twisting creates
spatially varying interlayer exchange interactions that stabilize emergent spin
textures and the coexistence of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic domains.
Here, we demonstrate the emergence of robust magnetic hysteresis in bilayer
CrSBr upon twisting by an angle of ~ 3{\deg}. This is observed as the
corresponding hysteretic evolution of the exciton energy, that directly
correlates with the bilayer magnetic state, in magnetic field dependent
photoluminescence measurements. A two-sublattice model captures this behavior,
attributing it to the twist-induced reduction of interlayer exchange that
stabilizes both parallel and antiparallel spin configurations across a broad
field range. Comparison with experiment enables quantitative extraction of the
effective exchange strength. Remarkably, the system exhibits coherent averaging
across the moir\'e supercell, yielding an effective monodomain response
characterized by switching into the antiferromagnetic state, rather than
forming spin textures or fragmented domains. Spatially resolved measurements
further uncover local variations in hysteresis loops, consistent with
position-dependent modulation of the average exchange interaction. Our results
establish twist engineering as a powerful route to programmable magnetic
memories in two-dimensional magnets, harnessing the robustness of
antiferromagnetic order.

We present a three-dimensional simulation study of silicon nanowire double
quantum dots with leads, which extends beyond traditional effective-mass or
quasi-1D and quasi-2D approaches typically applied to bulk or planar
geometries. Using the Sentaurus QTX, we self-consistently couple a 3-D Poisson
solver with two-dimensional Schr\"odinger solutions along the strongly confined
width * thickness cross-sections normal to the transport direction, yielding
bound-state energies and wavefunctions across the device cross-section. This
method captures wavefunction evolution, subband formation, and valley splitting
while retaining the full three-dimensional electrostatics of the device. Our
results show that narrow quantum dots (width = 5 nm) provide strong
confinement, enhanced valley splitting, and robust single-electron
localization, whereas wider quantum dots (width = 20 nm) allow single-electron
occupation at lower gate voltages but with shallower quantum wells and
additional higher-order modes in the wavefunction. Importantly, the quantum dot
width also plays a key role in tunnel coupling: smaller channel widths enhance
wavefunction overlap across the barrier, resulting in higher tunnel coupling,
whereas increasing the width reduces coupling, which eventually saturates once
the width is approximately twice the plunger-gate length. By systematically
varying the quantum dot width together with plunger- and barrier-gate lengths,
we investigate their combined influence on the conduction-band profile and
interdot coupling. Together, these simulations provide design guidelines for
geometry-driven control of confinement, valley splitting, and tunnel coupling
in silicon nanowire double quantum dots.

Single-photon detectors are an essential part of the toolbox of modern
quantum optics for implementing quantum technologies and enabling tests of
fundamental physics. The low energy of microwave photons, the natural signal
path for superconducting quantum devices, makes their detection much harder
than for visible light. Despite impressive progress in recent years and the
proposal and realization of a number of different detector architectures, the
reliable detection of a single itinerant microwave photon remains an open
topic.
  Here, we investigate and simulate a detailed protocol for single-photon
multiplication and subsequent amplification and detection. At its heart lies a
Josephson-photonics device which uses inelastic Cooper-pair tunneling driven by
a dc bias in combination with the energy of an incoming photon to create
multiple photons, thus compensating for the low-energy problem. Our analysis
provides clear design guidelines for utilizing such devices, which have
previously been operated in an amplifier mode with a continuous wave input, for
counting photons. Combining a formalism recently developed by M{\o}lmer to
describe the full quantum state of in- and outgoing photon pulses with
stochastic Schr\"odinger equations, we can describe the full multiplication and
detection protocol and calculate performance parameters, such as detection
probabilities and dark count rates. With optimized parameters, a high
population of a single output mode can be achieved that can then be easily
distinguished from vacuum noise in heterodyne measurements of quadratures with
a conventional linear amplifier. Realistic devices with two multiplication
stages with multiplication of $16$ reach for an impinging Gaussian pulse of
length $T$ a detection probability of $84.5\%$ with a dark count rate of
$10^{-3}/T$, and promise to outperform competing schemes.

We study the decoherence of a collection of Majorana zero modes weakly
coupled to a gapless reservoir of non-interacting fermions. Using the
Born-Markov approximation, we derive a Lindblad master equation for the
dissipative dynamics of the Majorana zero modes. Due to the long-range coupling
between Majorana zero modes mediated by the gapless reservoir, the Lindblad
jump operators are non-local linear combinations of the Majorana operators. We
show that, as a consequence, the dissipative dynamics can exhibit long
relaxation times, i.e. a slow decay of fermion parities. A spectral analysis of
the Liouvillian shows that the slow-down is suppressed as a power law of the
distance between Majorana zero modes. Finally, we validate the Lindblad
equation by comparison with unbiased numerical simulations of the time
evolution of the full density matrix. In particular, these illustrate that
non-Markovian dynamics establishes non-local correlations at small times.

Magnetic spin topological textures recently found their electrical
counterparts in polar topologies emerging from the condensation of
inhomogeneous polar atomic distortions. Here, we further extend the concept to
other non-polar atomic degrees of freedom. Taking SrTiO$_3$ as a prototypical
example, we investigate from second-principles atomistic simulations, the
equilibrium domain structures and topological textures associated with the
natural antiferrodistortive rotations of its oxygen octahedra. % Besides the
common 90$^\circ$ antiferrodistortive domain walls (twin boundaries), we
identify new metastable 180$^\circ$ domain walls oriented along the
$\lbrace100\rbrace_\mathrm{pc}$ direction, when compressive epitaxial strain is
applied. These domains exhibit complex antiferrodistortive Bloch- and
N\'eel-like configurations with the later being the most favorable. We also
stabilize antiferrodistortive vortex and antivortex structures which are
accompanied by co-localized polarization vortices and a complex pattern of the
local strain field, giving rise to a trimodal topological structures. Our
results extends the concept of topological ordering to non-polar structural
degrees of freedom and highlights the role of lattice-mediated couplings in
stabilizing complex textures in perovskite oxides.

The dielectric environment surrounding semiconductors plays a crucial role in
determining device performance, a role that becomes especially pronounced in
atomically thin semiconductors where charge carriers are confined within a few
atomic layers and strongly interact with their surroundings. High-k
dielectrics, such as hafnium oxide (HfO2), have been shown to enhance the
performance of two-dimensional (2D) materials by suppressing scattering from
charged impurities and phonons, but most studies to date have focused on
room-temperature transistor operation. Their influence on quantum transport
properties at low temperatures remains largely unexplored. In this work, we
investigate how capping monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) with HfO2
modifies its electronic behavior in the quantum regime. By comparing devices
with and without HfO2 capping, we find that uncapped devices exhibit transport
dominated by classical diffusive scattering, whereas capped devices show clear
Fabry-Perot interference patterns, providing direct evidence of phase-coherent
quantum transport enabled by dielectric screening. To gain further insight, we
develop a tight-binding interferometer model that captures the effect of
dielectric screening on conductive modes and reproduces the experimental
trends. Our findings demonstrate that dielectric engineering provides a
powerful route to control transport regimes in TMD devices.

### Mechanical coupling of polar topologies and oxygen octahedra rotations in PbTiO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ superlattices

PbTiO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ artificial superlattices recently emerged as a
prototypical platform for the emergence and study of polar topologies. While
previous studies mainly focused on the polar textures inherent to the
ferroelectric PbTiO$_3$ layers, the oxygen octahedra rotations inherent to the
paraelectric SrTiO$_3$ layers have attracted much little attention. Here, we
highlight a biunivocal relationship between distinct polar topologies --
including $a_1/a_2$ domains, polar vortices, and skyrmions -- within the
PbTiO$_3$ layers and specific patterns of oxygen octahedra rotations in the
SrTiO$_3$ layers. This relationship arises from a strain-mediated coupling
between the two materials and is shown to be reciprocal. Through
second-principles atomistic simulations, we demonstrate that each polar texture
imposes a corresponding rotation pattern, while conversely, a frozen oxygen
octahedra rotation dictates the emergence of the associated polar state. This
confirms the strong coupling between oxygen octahedra rotations in SrTiO$_3$
and polarization in PbTiO$_3$, highlighting their cooperative role in
stabilizing complex polar textures in related superlattices.

- **TL;DR**: 在Al/Ge异质结界面实现了原子级平整的界面，并通过STM观测到电子反射率在横向2nm范围内周期性变化达24%，这为探测异质结界面态提供了无损方法。

An atomically flat interface is achieved between face-centered cubic Al and
diamond lattice Ge via molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). Based on the measurements
of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), we demonstrate an atomically resolved
lateral periodic change of the electron reflectivity at the Al/Ge interface.
The variation of electron reflectivity is up to 24% in lateral 2 nm. We
speculate that the change of reflectivity results from the local electronic
states at the Al/Ge interface. This phenomenon provides an atomically
non-destructive method for detecting the buried interfacial states in
hetero-structures by STM.

- **TL;DR**: 通过低温扫描隧道显微镜在单层NiI₂中首次实现了电磁激子的原子尺度观测，揭示了其内部结构和空间调制特性。

Van der Waals multiferroics have emerged as a promising platform to explore
novel magnetoelectric phenomena. Recently, it has been shown that monolayer
NiI$_2$ hosts robust type-II multiferroicity down to the two-dimensional limit,
a giant dynamical magnetoelectric coupling at terahertz frequencies, and an
electrically switchable spin polarization. These developments present the
possibility of engineering ultrafast, low-energy-consumption, and
electrically-tunable spintronic devices based on the collective excitations of
the multiferroic order, electromagnons. However, the direct visualization of
these bosonic modes in real space and within the monolayer limit remains
elusive. Here, we report the atomic-scale observation of electromagnons in
monolayer NiI$_2$ using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy. By
tracking the thermal evolution of the multiferroic phase, we establish the
energy scale and resolve coherent in-gap excitations of the symmetry-broken
multiferroic state. Comparison with first-principles and spin-model
calculations reveals that the low-energy modes originate from electromagnon
excitations. Spatially resolved inelastic tunneling spectroscopy maps show a
stripe-like modulation of the local spectral function at electromagnon
energies, matching theoretical predictions. These results provide direct
evidence of the internal structure of electromagnons and establish a
methodology to probe these modes at the atomic scale, opening avenues for
electrically tunable spintronics.

### Magnetic-Field Control of Tomonaga-Luttinger Liquids in Ta2Pd3Te5 Edge States

- **TL;DR**: Ta2Pd3Te5是一种准一维过渡金属碲化物，通过静电门控和磁场调控，在其一维边缘通道中实现了可调的Tomonaga-Luttinger液体行为，为拓扑超导相和Majorana零模的实现提供了路径。

Ta2Pd3Te5 is a quasi-one-dimensional transition-metal telluride whose heavy
atoms endow the material with strong spin-orbit coupling, while the Fermi level
inside the bulk gap makes the low-energy electronic structure highly
tunable.Theory and early experiments have already identified a wealth of
emergent phases in this platform: an excitonic insulator driven by
electron-hole binding, a second-order topological insulator protected by
crystalline symmetry, a potential topological-protected quantum-spin-Hall edge,
and proximity-induced edge supercurrents when coupled to a conventional s-wave
superconductor. These properties make it a promising platform for hosting
Majorana zero modes and quantum computation, provided that time-reversal
symmetry can be broken by a Zeeman gap. In this work, we demonstrate that the
one-dimensional edge channels of exfoliated Ta2Pd3Te5 host a robust and tunable
Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid by electrostatic gating because it shifts the
chemical potential across the bulk gap without changing the gap size. More
importantly, the application of a magnetic field introduces a Zeeman gap that
systematically increases the TLL power-law exponent alpha. Furthermore,
rotating the field reveals a pronounced twofold anisotropy--alpha is maximal
for a field parallel to the edge and minimal for a perpendicular
orientation--originating from an orientation-dependent edge g-factor that is
likely amplified by quantum-confinement-induced orbital-angular-moment
quenching. The existence of gate-tunable edge supercurrents together with the
field-controlled Zeeman gap provides a direct route to break time-reversal
symmetry in a particle-hole-symmetric superconducting gap and thus to engineer
a topological superconducting phase, paving the way towards Majorana-based
quantum devices.

Excitons govern the light-matter interaction in 2D gapped materials with
intrinsically large binding energies. In spite of plentiful optical
measurements in the visible for semiconducting transition-metal
dichalcogenides, we still lack optical-absorption studies of the exciton
structure of insulating 2D materials that requires UV light. Moreover,
measurements of the momentum dispersion of excitons in the vicinity of optical
limit are rare owing to low resolutions but hold the key to reveal
quasiparticle interactions. To close this gap, we employ high momentum
resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy ($q$-EELS) to explore exciton
dispersions of mono- and few-layer hexagonal boron nitride. Surprisingly, we
reveal a fine structure of the first bright exciton dispersion band composed by
two features (A and A$'$), visible only at small momentum, not predicted by
Bethe-Salpeter calculations. Introducing an optical conductivity approximation
(OCA), we extract from the experimental $q$-EELS spectra the ultraviolet (UV)
optical conductivity at zero momentum, $\sigma(\omega)$, and discuss the
exciton fine structure in $\sigma(\omega)$, consistent with previous
photoluminescence observations. Our findings establish a general methodology to
probe the fine structure of exciton dispersions, providing new insights into
exciton-phonon sidebands and eventually polarons in low-dimensional materials.

### Gate Voltage Tunable Second Harmonic Generation in Mono- and Bi-layer Black Phosphene

Black phosphorene (BP) has emerged as a promising platform for tunable
nonlinear photonics due to its layer-dependent bandgap, high carrier mobility,
and remarkable in-plane anisotropy. This study investigates the second-harmonic
generation (SHG) of monolayer and bilayer BP under an external static electric
field, with describing the electronic states by a tight-binding model and the
dynamics by semiconductor Bloch equations. Our results reveal that BP exhibits
large second-order nonlinear optical response along the armchair direction,
with significant resonant enhancement when the incident photon energy
approaches half of its bandgap. Under an applied electric field of $10^7$ V/m,
the effective second-order nonlinear susceptibility of BP can be as large as
$10^3$ pm/V, surpassing that of the conventional nonlinear crystal AgGaSe$_2$
by more than an order of magnitude. With respect to the static electric field
induced by gate voltage, we discuss the relation between the
electric-field-induced second harmonic (EFISH) generation and conventional SHG
-- under lower gate voltage, the EFISH approach agrees well with the SHG
solutions, whereas the former is no longer applicable under higher gate
voltage. Specifically, as the increasing gate voltage, monolayer BP exhibits
the bandgap expansion and the corresponding blue-shift in the SHG resonant
peak. In contrast, bilayer BP undergoes a semiconductor-to-semimetal
transition, forming Dirac cone and generating divergent SHG spectra as photon
energy goes to zero. Additionally, the chemical potential allows for precise
control over interband and intraband nonlinear responses. This work provides
important theoretical foundations for the development of BP-based tunable
nonlinear photonic devices and expands the application potential of anisotropic
two-dimensional materials in nonlinear optics.

Despite competitive efficiency compared to Si solar cells and relevant
stability at near room temperatures the rapid degradation at elevated
temperatures remains the critical obstacle for exploitation of perovskite
photovoltaics. In this work, a 4-(pyridin-4-yl)triphenylamine (TPA-Py) with
pyridine anchor group was employed for inter-grain bulk modification of
double-cation CsCH(NH2)2PbI3 perovskite absorbers to enhance thermal stability.
Through coordination and dipole-dipole interactions, nitrogen-containing
fragments (diphenylamine and pyridine) of TPA-Py passivate uncoordinated
cations and improve the phase resilience of perovskite films against
segregation. This resulted in a power conversion efficiency of 21.3% with a
high open-circuit voltage of 1.14 V. Notable impact of self-assembled monolayer
incorporated into the bulk of perovskite film manifested in huge improvement of
thermal stability at 85{\deg}C (ISOS-D-2). TPA-Py modification improved
extended the T80 lifetime to ~600 h compared to only 200 h for the reference
under harsh heating stress in ambient conditions. In-depth analysis using
photoinduced voltage transients and admittance spectroscopy after different
stress periods revealed the screening of ion migration (0.45 eV) for devices
with TPA-Py. This work offers an important understanding of the bulk
modification of microcrystalline perovskite absorbers and guide for robust
design of bulk and buried interfaces in highly efficient perovskite solar
cells.

This study explores Ti-containing complex concentrated alloys (CCAs) within
the AlMoNbTiZr system, focusing on compositions located in regions of the Bo-Md
diagram characterized by low bond order (Bo) and d-orbital energy level (Md).
Four alloys were designed near the line predicting stress-induced martensite
formation in conventional Ti alloys, then cast, annealed at 1200{\deg}C, and
water quenched. Their microstructures and phases were analyzed and compared
against phase prediction tools commonly applied to high-entropy alloys (HEAs),
namely empirical parameters and CALPHAD simulations. Results highlight the
strong influence of chemical affinity, particularly the roles of Al, Mo, and Zr
concentrations, on solid-solution stability. A maximum Al content of 10 at% was
identified as the threshold for achieving a single-phase microstructure,
observed in the 10Al15Mo10Nb35Ti30Zr alloy. This alloy exhibited a bcc/b2
structure with high compressive strength (above 1300 MPa), low Young's modulus
(28 GPa), and limited strain (&lt;6%), but lacked the transformation-induced
strengthening mechanisms expected for Ti alloys with comparable Bo-Md values.

Subwavelength arrays of plasmonic nanoparticles allow us to control the
behaviour of light at the nanoscale. Here, we develop an eigenmode analysis,
employing a coupled electromagnetic dipole formalism, which permits us to
isolate the contribution to the far-field radiation of each array mode.
Specifically, we calculate the far-field radiation patterns by bulk, edge and
corner out-of-plane eigenmodes in a finite 2D Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) array
of plasmonic nanoparticles with out-of-plane dipolar resonances. The breaking
of symmetries in multipartite unit cells is exploited to tailor the optical
properties and far-field radiation of the resonant modes. We prove that the
antisymmetric modes are darker and have higher Q-factors than their symmetric
counterparts. Also, the out-of-plane nature of the dipolar resonances imposes
that all bulk $\Gamma$-modes are dark, while corner and edge states need extra
in-plane symmetries to cancel the far-field radiation; radiation patterns in
turn become more complex and concentrated along the array plane with increasing
array size.

- **TL;DR**: 在MDRANGE代码中实现了基于电子密度依赖的能量损失模型，用于准确模拟通道几何中轨迹依赖的离子射程分布

The energy losses of energetic ions in materials depend on both nuclear and
electronic interactions. In channeling geometries, the stopping effect of these
interactions can be highly reduced, resulting in deeper ion penetration.
Comprehensive, trajectory-dependent models for ion-material interactions are
therefore crucial for the accurate prediction of ion range profiles. We present
the implementation of a recent electron density-dependent energy-loss model in
the efficient molecular dynamics-based MDRANGE code. The model captures
\textit{ab initio} electron dynamics using a parametrized ion energy loss
function, based on calculations for explicit trajectories using real-time
time-dependent density functional theory. We demonstrate the efficient
simulation of trajectory-dependent ion range profiles with this comprehensive
model for electronic energy losses. Our results indicate that accurate
trajectory-dependent ion range profiles can be simulated using well-fitted
parametrizations of this model. This method offers a unique tool for validation
of the fitted energy-loss functions using energetic ion ranges, which can be
measured experimentally but are beyond the capability of full MD simulations
due to the computational expense.

Ruthenium dioxide (RuO2) has recently emerged as a candidate altermagnet, yet
its intrinsic magnetic ground state, particularly in thin films, remains
debated. This study aims to clarify the nature and spatial extent of the
magnetic order in RuO2 thin films grown under different conditions. Thin films
of RuO2 with thicknesses of 30 nm and 33 nm are fabricated by pulsed laser
deposition and sputtering onto TiO2(110) and Al2O3(1-102) substrates,
respectively. Low-energy muon spin rotation/relaxation (LE-muSR) with
depth-resolved sensitivity measurements is performed in transverse magnetic
fields (TF) from 4 K to 290 K. The muSR data collected with a muon implantation
energy of 1 keV reveal that magnetic signals originate from the near-surface
region of the film (&lt;10 nm), and the affected volume fraction is at most about
8.5%. The localized magnetic response is consistent across different
substrates, growth techniques, and parameter sets, suggesting a common origin
related to surface defects and dimensionality effects. The combined use of
TF-muSR and the study of depth-dependent implantation with low-energy muons
provides direct evidence for surface-confined, inhomogeneous static magnetic
order in RuO2 thin films, helping reconcile discrepancies. These findings
underscore the importance of considering reduced-dimensional contributions and
motivate further investigation into the role of defects, strain, and
stoichiometry on the magnetic properties of RuO2, especially at the surface.

The performance of silicon nano-devices at cryogenic temperatures is critical
for quantum computing technologies. Through multi-valley Monte Carlo
simulations of Si (110) systems, we reveal a fundamental shift in electron
transport physics at low temperatures. Phonon scattering becomes negligible,
and mobility is instead dictated by a competition between remote Coulomb
scattering (RCS) at low carrier densities and surface roughness scattering
(SRS) at high densities. This competition creates a distinct peak in electron
mobility. Furthermore, we demonstrate a critical design trade-off for
high-$\kappa$ dielectrics like $\mathrm{HfO_2}$: while enhancing gate control,
they introduce strong remote phonon scattering, which can suppress mobility.
These findings provide essential guidelines for the material selection and

Excitation and control of antiferromagnetic magnon modes lie at the heart of
coherent antiferromagnetic spintronics. Here, we propose a topological surface
magnon-polariton as the potential means to excite antiferromagnetic magnons in
the prototypical magnonic material hematite. We show that in an insulating
canted antiferromagnet, where the magnons can strongly couple to photons using
electrical on-chip layouts, a surface magnon-polariton mode exists in the gap
of the bulk magnon-photon bands. The emergence of surface magnon-polariton mode
is further attributed to the nontrivial topology of bulk magnon-photon bands.
Magnon-photon coupling enhances the Berry curvature near the anticrossing
points, leading to a topological bulk Chern band associated with the surface
magnon-polaritons. Our work provides a general principle for the utilisation of
optomagnetic properties in antiferromagnets, with an illustration of its
feasibility in the particular case of hematite.
