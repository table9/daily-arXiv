- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种通过控制电极平坦化石墨烯纳米带能带结构，并使用优化光脉冲实现电子相干控制的方法，包括π脉冲实现能带反转和π/2脉冲产生叠加态。

The field of coherent electronics aims to advance electronic functionalities
by utilizing quantum coherence. Here, we demonstrate a viable and versatile
methodology for controlling electron dynamics optically in graphene
nanoribbons. In particular, we propose to flatten the band structure of
armchair graphene nanoribbons via control electrodes, arranged periodically
along the extended direction of the nanoribbon. This addresses a key mechanism
for dephasing in solids, which derives from the momentum dependence of the
energy gap between the valence and the conduction band. We design an optimal
driving field pulse to produce collective Rabi oscillations between these
bands, in their flattened configuration. As an example for coherent control, we
show that these optimized pulses can be used to invert the entire electronic
band population by a $\pi$ pulse in a reversible fashion, and to create a
superposition state via a $\pi/2$ pulse, which generates an alternating
photocurrent. Our proposal consists of a platform and methodological approach
to optically control the electron dynamics of graphene nanoribbons, paving the
way toward novel coherent electronic and quantum information processing devices
in solid-state materials.

- **TL;DR**: 本文提出了Weyl电子和二次能带接触节点的拉曼散射理论，超越了标准有效质量近似，揭示了偏振依赖的普适性和对称性保护特征，并分析了能谱倾斜和狄拉克电子与平带共存对拉曼信号的影响。

Raman scattering is emerging as a surprising probe of electron topology in
quantum materials. It has been used recently to detect and characterize a
topological phase transition that accompanies the magnetic transition in
Nd$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$. Here we present a theory of Raman scattering from nodal
electrons with Weyl and quadratic band touching spectra, which has to reach
beyond the standard effective mass approximation. After reviewing and providing
the details of our previous theory development, we discuss several new results.
We show that the light-polarization dependence of Raman scattering is universal
in the case of Weyl electrons and given by an analytic expression, while it
contains symmetry-protected features in the case of quadratic band-touching
nodes. We also analyze modifications of the Raman signal due to the ubiquitous
tilting of the Weyl spectrum, and argue that universality is lost only in a
finite frequency range that springs out of the threshold frequency for untilted
nodes. Finally, we explore the frequency dependence of Raman scattering for the
case of Dirac electrons coexisting with a flat band in the same region of the
first Brillouin zone, which is inspired by the material V$_{1/3}$NbS$_2$.

### Extreme events scaling in self-organized critical models

- **TL;DR**: 研究二维自组织临界模型（SOC）中雪崩活动的极端事件，发现极端雪崩大小和面积遵循广义极值分布，并提出了连接不同尺度活动的标度函数。

We study extreme events of avalanche activities in finite-size
two-dimensional self-organized critical (SOC) models, specifically the
stochastic Manna model (SMM) and the Bak-Tang-Weisenfeld (BTW) sandpile model.
Employing the approach of block maxima, the study numerically reveals that the
distributions for extreme avalanche size and area follow the generalized
extreme value (GEV) distribution. The extreme avalanche size follows the Gumbel
distribution with shape parameter $\xi=0$ while in the case of the extreme
avalanche area, we report $\xi&gt;0$. We propose scaling functions for extreme
avalanche activities that connect the activities on different length scales.
With the help of data collapse, we estimate the precise values of these
critical exponents. The scaling functions provide an understanding of the
intricate dynamics for different variants of the sandpile model, shedding light
on the relationship between system size and extreme event characteristics. Our
findings give insight into the extreme behavior of SOC models and offer a
framework to understand the statistical properties of extreme events.

### Accelerated prediction of dielectric functions in solar cell materials with graph neural networks

- **TL;DR**: 提出了原子线图神经网络(ALIGNN)模型，直接从晶体结构预测介电函数，并在JARVIS-DFT数据库上训练，能够准确再现光谱特征，实现高效高通量筛选。

We present an atomistic line graph neural network (ALIGNN) model for
predicting dielectric functions directly from crystal structures. Trained on
$\sim$7000 dielectric functions from the JARVIS-DFT database computed with a
meta-GGA exchange-correlation functional, the model accurately reproduces
spectral features, including peak intensities and overall line shapes, while
enabling efficient high-throughput screening. Applied to the recently developed
Alexandria materials database, containing over four hundred thousand insulating
materials, we uncover a clear elemental trend, with vanadium emerging as a
strong indicator of materials with high-spectroscopic limited maximum
efficiency (SLME). In particular, vanadium-based perovskite materials show a
substantially higher fraction of high-SLME compounds compared to the database
average, underscoring their promise for optoelectronic applications.

### Altermagnetism and Superconductivity: A Short Historical Review

- **TL;DR**: 本文探讨了凝聚态物理中三个看似无关的概念——电子液晶相、多极展开和交变磁性之间的深层联系，它们都基于非相对论性自旋-动量锁定机制，并进一步研究了由此产生的非常规超导现象。

This article explores the deep interconnections among three seemingly
unrelated concepts in condensed matter physics: electronic liquid crystal
phases, multipole expansions, and altermagnetism. At the heart of these
phenomena lies a shared foundation: spin-momentum locking in the
nonrelativistic regime. Originally proposed in the context of electronic liquid
crystal phases, spin-momentum locking was later elegantly incorporated into the
formalism of multipole expansions. This framework can be further extended
across multiple atomic sites, making it particularly effective for describing
altermagnets, which feature localized magnetic moments distributed over at
least two sublattices. In the second part of the article, we examine
superconducting phenomena that stem from this shared mechanism, focusing on
superconductivity in systems with spin-momentum locked Fermi surfaces. We
highlight a rich variety of unconventional superconducting states, including
finite-momentum pairing, $d$-wave and spin-triplet superconductivity, and
topological Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces, among others. Additional related topics
are addressed in the concluding section. Overall, this work offers both an
accessible introduction to the newly identified magnetic order known as
altermagnetism and a conceptual guide for researchers aiming to harness the
ensuing unconventional superconductivity in the development of future quantum
technologies.

### Theoretical Analysis of Topotomography Using Small Intragranular Strain Approximations

- **TL;DR**: Topo-Tomography是一种同步辐射X射线衍射成像技术，用于表征多晶样品中的晶粒形状和晶体取向。本文推导了TT投影几何的数学表达式，分析了取向场重建的可行性，并提出了扩展数据覆盖的方法。

Topo-Tomography (TT) is a synchrotron-based X-ray diffraction imaging
technique used to characterize grain shape and crystal orientation in
polycrystalline samples. This work aims to provide a decisive and fundamental
understanding of 3D grain shape and orientation field reconstruction from TT
diffraction data. We derive mathematical expressions for the TT projection
geometry, considering grain shape, intragranular lattice rotations, and elastic
strains, under the assumption of kinematical diffraction. These expressions are
simplified using approximations for small strain variations and grain size. The
simplified expressions show that integrated TT projection images correspond to
projections of a "pseudo" distorted grain volume. Its Fourier analysis provides
insights into the feasibility of orientation field reconstruction from TT
scans. We propose methods to expand data coverage, including using opposite
scattering vectors and varying detector distance. A lower bound for orientation
sampling resolution is derived and validated through simulations.

### Revealing Light-Driven Dynamics at Nanostructured Solid-Liquid Interfaces with In-Situ SHG
- **arXiv**: [2510.08809](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08809)  ·  [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.08809.pdf)
- **Title (EN)**: Revealing Light-Driven Dynamics at Nanostructured Solid-Liquid Interfaces with In-Situ SHG
- **Authors**: Tarique Anwar, Diana DallAglio, Milad Sabzehparvar, Giulia Tagliabue
- **Categories**: physics.chem-ph
- **TL;DR**: 该论文开发了一种纳米光子方法，通过二阶谐波生成(SHG)增强两个数量级，实现了对固液界面光驱动现象的非侵入式实时探测，揭示了光诱导表面电位调制的两种机制和浓度依赖的非单调行为。

Light and heat are key drivers of interfacial chemistry at solid-liquid
boundaries, governing fundamental processes in sustainable energy conversion
systems such as photoelectrochemical and hydrovoltaic devices. However,
non-invasive probing of light-induced surface potential dynamics at these
interfaces remains challenging due to limited surface sensitivity. Here, we
introduce a nanophotonic approach that amplifies second harmonic generation
(SHG) from nanostructured solid-liquid interfaces by over two orders of
magnitude, providing real-time, all-optical access to light-driven interfacial
phenomena. Using in-situ SHG at silicon-oxide-electrolyte interfaces, we
uncover two concurrent pathways for light-mediated modulation: (i)
low-intensity illumination induces photocharging via carrier generation and
trapping, while (ii) high-intensity excitation leads to photothermal heating
that modifies surface group dissociation through temperature-dependent reaction
equilibria. We further show that nanostructured semiconductor interfaces
deviate markedly from the monotonic electrolyte-concentration dependence
predicted by Gouy-Chapman theory. Instead, the surface potential exhibits a
pronounced non-monotonic behavior governed by interfacial geometry, consistent
with prior device-level observations. Importantly, SHG measurements reveal that
this concentration-dependent modulation of surface potential directly alters
the electronic polarizability of silicon, exposing the underlying
ion-electronic coupling at the solid-liquid boundary. By combining nanophotonic
design, in-situ SHG probing, and quantitative modeling, this work establishes
an experimentally validated framework for actively manipulating interfacial
charge distributions to advance the performance of solid-liquid energy
conversion technologies.

### Crystal-Field--Driven Magnetoelectricity in the Triangular Quantum Magnet CeMgAl$_{11}$O$_{19}$

- **TL;DR**: 该论文研究了CeMgAl11O19单晶的介电和磁电特性，这是一种嵌入可极化六铝酸盐晶格中的Kramers三角磁体。在零磁场下，介电常数遵循量子顺电体的Barrett定律，在3K附近出现宽泛最小值。磁场可调节该最小值的位置和宽度，表现出可调谐的磁电响应。

We report dielectric and magnetoelectric studies of single-crystalline
\ce{CeMgAl11O19}, a Kramers triangular magnet embedded in a polarizable
hexaaluminate lattice. In zero magnetic field, the permittivity
$\varepsilon'(T)$ follows the Barrett law of a quantum paraelectric down to 25
K, below which a broad minimum develops near 3 K without evidence of static
ferroelectric or magnetic order. Application of magnetic fields up to
\SI{9}{\tesla} shifts this minimum to higher temperatures and broadens it,
evidencing a tunable magnetoelectric response.The magnetoelectric coupling was
characterized using results from magnetization measurements. The anomaly
temperature $T^*$, extracted from the local minimum of $\varepsilon'(T)$,
exhibits a linear dependence on the squared magnetization $M^2$, consistent
with the biquadratic magnetoelectric coupling allowed in centrosymmetric
systems. This magnetoelectric effect, mediated by spin-orbit-entangled Kramers
doublets interacting with a frustrated antipolar liquid, establishes
\ce{CeMgAl11O19} as a prototype for exploring quantum magnetoelectricity in
frustrated systems.

### Light-induced pseudo-magnetic fields in three-dimensional topological semimetals

- **TL;DR**: 本文提出通过空间变化的线偏振光在Weyl半金属中产生和控制赝磁场的方法，利用Floquet工程实现轴向规范势和赝磁场的动态调控。

In this work, we show that suitably designed spatially varying linearly
polarized light provides a versatile route to generate and control
pseudo-magnetic fields in Weyl semimetals through Floquet engineering. Within a
high-frequency expansion, we derive an effective axial gauge potential
$\mathbf{A}_5(\mathbf{r})$ whose curl gives the pseudo-magnetic field
$\mathbf{B}_5(\mathbf{r})$. By mapping the light profile to
$\mathbf{A}_5(\mathbf{r})$, we establish design principles for pseudo-magnetic
field textures that mimic strain-induced gauge fields while offering key
advantages like dynamic control, full reversibility, spatial selectivity, and
absence of material deformation. We compare the Landau-level spectra produced
by uniform real and pseudo-magnetic fields and also analyze both their linear
optical conductivity and the second-order dc responses. Our results enable
real-time manipulation of pseudo-magnetic fields and predict clear experimental
signatures for optically engineered gauge fields in topological semimetals.

### Quantum fluctuation-induced first-order breaking of time-reversal symmetry in unconventional superconductors

- **TL;DR**: 该论文研究了时间反演对称性自发破缺超导体中相位涨落对量子相变的影响，发现在相位涨落作用下，时间反演不对称的s+id相区域会分裂出与d相具有一阶边界的新区域，表明可能发生相分离。

Spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking in superconductors with competing
non-degenerate pairing channels is an exotic quantum phase transition that
could give rise to robust topological superconductivity and unusual magnetism.
It is proposed mostly in two-dimensional systems and is signaled by a nonzero
relative phase between the two superconducting order parameters, hence it
should particularly be prone to order-parameter phase fluctuations.
Nevertheless, the existing understanding of it is still at the mean-field
level. Here, we illustrate the non-negligible effects of the phase fluctuations
on such quantum phase transitions using the hole-doped square-lattice $t$-$J$
model as an example. We derive the phase fluctuation-corrected free energy and
show that under the quantum phase fluctuations, the time-reversal asymmetric
$s+id$ phase region splits off a dome featuring a first-order border with the
$d$ phase, indicating the possibility of a phase separation into the
time-reversal symmetric and asymmetric phases. The phase fluctuations also
narrow the range of the $s+id$ phase considerably. We further discuss the
implications of our findings for recent experiments on disorder-induced
first-order quantum breakdown of superconductivity and promising
high-temperature topological superconductivity in twisted cuprate Josephson
junctions.

### Atomistic origin of low thermal conductivity in quaternary chalcogenides Cu(Cd, Zn)$_2$InTe$_4$

Crystalline semiconductors with intrinsically low lattice thermal
conductivity ($\mathcal{K}$) are vital for device applications such as barrier
coatings and thermoelectrics. Quaternary chalcogenide semiconductors such as
CuCd$_2$InTe$_4$ and CuZn$_2$InTe$_4$ are experimentally shown to exhibit low
$\mathcal{K}$, yet its microscopic origin remains poorly understood. Here, we
analyse their thermal transport mechanisms using a unified first-principles
framework that captures both the Peierls (particle-like propagation,
$\mathcal{K}_P$) and coherence (wave-like tunneling, $\mathcal{K}_C$)
mechanisms of phonon transport. We show that extended antibonding states below
the Fermi level lead to enhanced phonon anharmonicity and strong scattering of
heat-carrying phonon modes, suppressing $\mathcal{K}$ in these chalcogenides.
We show that $\mathcal{K}_P$ dominates the total thermal conductivity, while
$\mathcal{K}_C$ remains negligible even under strong anharmonicity of the
phonon modes. The heavier Cd ions in CuCd$_2$InTe$_4$ induce greater
acoustic-optical phonon overlap and scattering compared to CuZn$_2$InTe$_4$,
further lowering thermal conductivity of the former. Additionally, grain
boundary scattering in realistic samples contributes to further suppression of
thermal transport. Our findings establish the atomistic origins of low
$\mathcal{K}$ in quaternary chalcogenides and offer guiding principles for
designing low-thermal-conductivity semiconductors.

### Gravity-Induced Modulation of Negative Differential Thermal Resistance in Fluids

- **TL;DR**: 研究重力如何影响多粒子碰撞动力学模型流体中的负微分热阻现象，发现重力可以显著降低NDTR发生所需的温度差，并使该机制在强相互作用系统中也能工作。

We investigate how gravity influences negative differential thermal
resistance (NDTR) in fluids modeled by multiparticle collision dynamics. In the
integrable case, we derive the heat flux formula for the system exhibiting the
NDTR effect, and show that by introducing a gravity along the direction of the
thermodynamic force, the temperature difference required for the occurrence of
NDTR can be greatly reduced. Meanwhile, we also demonstrate that the
heat-bath-induced NDTR mechanism -- originally found to be applicable only to
weakly interacting systems -- can now operate in systems with stronger
interactions due to the presence of gravity, and further remains robust even in
mixed fluids. These results provide new insights into heat transport and
establish a theoretical foundation for designing fluidic thermal devices that
harness the NDTR effect under gravity.

### Control of chemical reactions in radiofrequency ion traps

Over the past years, radiofrequency ion traps have become an attractive
platform for studying chemical reactions as they enable a high degree of
control over ion-molecule dynamics. In this review, we summarize techniques for
the trapping and cooling of atomic and molecular ions in radiofrequency traps
including Doppler and resolved-sideband laser cooling, sympathetic cooling, and
cryogenic buffer-gas methods. We discuss strategies for controlling key
reaction parameters: the preparation of specific internal quantum states by
internal cooling, optical pumping, state-selective photoionization and
quantum-logic spectroscopy; the manipulation of collision energies through
micromotion control, dynamic trapping and combination with molecular beams; and
the selection of molecular structure via isotopic substitution, conformational
separation and isomer-specific ion generation. We illustrate applications of
these approaches by discussing studies on quantum-state-dependent kinetics,
quantum-resonance effects and structure-sensitive reactivity in ion-neutral
collisions. We conclude by outlining future challenges, including full
state-to-state reaction mapping, reaching the ultracold quantum regime free of
micromotion, and the exploration of complex and chiral systems.

### Nematic Fluctuations and Electronic Correlations in Heavily Hole-Doped Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$ Probed by Elastoresistance

- **TL;DR**: 通过弹性电阻测量研究Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$中的向列涨落和电子关联，发现在高掺杂区域A$_{1g}$通道主导，表明强轨道选择性电子关联。

This work investigates nematic fluctuations and electronic correlations in
the hole-doped iron pnictide superconductor Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$ by
means of longitudinal and transverse elastoresistance measurements over a wide
doping range ($0.63 &lt; x &lt; 0.98$). For this purpose, the orbital character of
the electronic response was revealed by decomposition of the elastoresistance
into the $A_{1g}$ and $B_{2g}$ symmetry channels. It was shown that at lower
doping levels nematic fluctuations in the $B_{2g}$ channel dominate, while for
$x &gt; 0.68$ the $A_{1g}$ channel becomes dominant and reaches a pronounced
maximum at $x \approx 0.8$ which indicates strong orbital-selective electronic
correlations. Despite the dominance of the $A_{1g}$ signal at high doping, a
weak contribution in the $B_{2g}$ channel persists, which can be interpreted as
a remnant of nematic fluctuations. Model calculations based on a five-orbital
tight-binding Hamiltonian with interactions attribute the observed enhancement
in the $A_{1g}$ channel to an orbital-selective Kondo-like resonance,
predominantly involving the $d_{xy}$ orbital. We discuss our results in
relation to the evolution of the Sommerfeld coefficient reported in the
literature and a reported change of the superconducting order parameter. All
this indicates that for $x &gt; 0.68$ qualitatively new physics emerges. Our
findings suggest that electronic correlations in the strongly hole-doped regime
play an important role in superconductivity, while the detectable weak nematic
fluctuations may also be of relevance.

### Homogeneous and inhomogeneous phases in a numerical model of a time-reversal-breaking superconductor

In this manuscript, we find an inhomogeneous stripes phase in a numerical
model for an unconventional superconductor with time-reversal-breaking symmetry
and triplet odd pairing. We contrast a robust well known homogeneous phase with
dilute disorder characterized by a unitary resonance and a tiny gap that
resembles an s-wave superconductor, with a new inhomogeneous phase with
extremely dilute disorder and real frequency stripes. This phase has only two
ultra-small frequency collision values at the edges of the unitary resonance,
indicating the displacement of the s-wave tiny gap to the outer edges of the
resonance. We perform a statistical analysis of the real frequency density and
encounter a lack of spectral stability, characterized by a sequence of vertical
frequency stripes. Experimentalists can verify this finding by looking for an
unstable phase in extremely clean samples of candidates for triplet
superconductors.

### Imaging of Gate-Controlled Suppression of Superconductivity via the Meissner Effect

It was recently discovered that supercurrents flowing through thin
superconducting nanowires can be quenched by a gate voltage. This gate control
of supercurrents, known as the GCS effect, could enable superconducting
transistor logic. Here, we report that the GCS also manifests in a suppression
of Meissner screening, establishing the phenomenon as a genuine feature of
superconductivity that is not restricted to transport. Using a scanning
nitrogen-vacancy magnetometer at sub-Kelvin temperatures, we image the
nanoscale spatial region of GCS suppression in micron-size niobium islands. Our
observations are compatible with a microscopic hot-spot model of quasiparticle
generation and diffusion, and in conflict with other candidate mechanisms such
as Joule heating or an electric field effect. Our work introduces an
alternative means for studying quasiparticle dynamics in superconducting
nanostructures, and showcases the power of local imaging techniques for
understanding emergent condensed matter phenomena.

### Collective Variables Based on Multipole Expansion of Ewald Summation for Crystallization

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种基于多极展开的统一集体变量框架，用于分子动力学模拟中的结晶过程，能够同时编码平移和取向有序性。

Crystallization, a fundamental phase transition process governing material
formation in natural and industrial contexts, involves the spontaneous
emergence of long-range structural order from disordered phases. This
long-range periodicity involves spatial and molecular orientation order.
Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of crystallization require collective
variables (CVs) that accurately distinguish this long-\range periodicity.
Existing CVs based on local descriptors (e.g., bond-orientational order) often
lack transferability across crystal structures. To address this, we propose a
unified CV framework derived from the multipole expansion of Ewald summation: a
mathematical formalism bridging X-ray diffraction (XRD) principles and
electrostatic energy computation in MD. By projecting atomic configurations
onto a basis of spherical harmonics (complete for angular function
representation), our CV achieves high-fidelity encoding of both translational
and orientational order. Metadynamics simulations demonstrate that this CV
drives efficient sampling of polymorphic pathways for known crystals and
predicts stable phases even without crystal structures. This approach shows
potential as a transferable platform for ab initio crystal structure

- **TL;DR**: 通过调控沉积温度（100-500°C）和薄膜厚度，研究了In2Se3薄膜从非晶态到晶态相变过程中表面功函数的演化，发现不同相态具有不同的功函数范围（5.26-6.64 eV）和光学带隙（2.50-1.55 eV）。

Indium selenide is a phase-change chalcogenide whose polymorphism enables a
variety of physical properties to be tuned. Here we directly quantify the
evolution of the surface work function across the amorphous-to-crystalline
transition in RF-sputtered In2Se3 thin films grown on c-plane Al2O3 (001). By
varying deposition temperature (100-500 {\deg}C) and film thickness, we
establish processing windows for a- In2Se3, {\alpha}-In2Se3, and {\gamma}-InSe,
and correlate structure with electronic and morphological properties. X-ray
diffraction shows films deposited at 100 to 200 {\deg}C are amorphous, 300 to
400 {\deg}C yields {\alpha}-In2Se3, whereas 500 {\deg}C yields {\gamma}-InSe.
Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) maps the surface potential and yields
spatially averaged work functions spanning 5.26 to 6.64 eV across the
amorphous-crystalline transformation; pronounced intra-film heterogeneity is
observed, with select {\alpha}-phase and {\gamma}-InSe grains exhibiting work
functions exceeding the local mean. Topographical distinctions are found
between phases with hexagonally faceted grains in the crystalline state,
whereas homogeneous nano-mounds are found in amorphous films. Analysis of Tauc
plots revealed optical bandgaps in the range of 2.50 to 1.55 eV across the
observed phases. X-ray fluorescence (XRF) measurements further indicated that
the indium to selenium concentration ratio varied between 0.70 {\pm} 0.1 to
1.01 {\pm} 0.1 as the deposition temperature increased from 100 to 500 {\deg}C.
These measurements provide direct, spatially resolved quantification of
work-function evolution through the phase change, supplying parameters
essential for contact engineering and device integration of In2Se3 and InSe.

Glyphosate, the most widely used herbicide worldwide, crystallizes through
complex intermolecular interactions that are strongly influenced by
synthesis-derived impurities. Understanding this process at the molecular scale
is critical for optimizing production, ensuring product quality, and assessing
environmental impact. Here, we employ direct coexistence molecular dynamics
simulations and free energy calculations to elucidate how glycine-a prevalent
synthesis byproduct-modulates glyphosate solubility and crystal growth in
aqueous solutions. Our simulations identify two major mechanisms by which
glycine hinders crystallization. First, direct coexistence simulations show
that glycine preferentially adsorbs at crystal surfaces, hindering glyphosate
attachment and slowing growth. Second, free energy calculations demonstrate
that glycine enhances glyphosate solubility, reducing the supersaturation
driving force to incorporate into the crystal phase. Experimental measurements
corroborate our predictions, confirming both enhanced solubility and reduced
crystallization kinetics in glycine-bearing systems. These findings establish
that glycine-typically considered an inert impurity-actively disrupts
glyphosate crystallization by promoting its dissolution. More broadly, this
integrated computational-experimental approach highlights the power of
molecular simulations to disentangle impurity effects, interfacial phenomena,
and solution thermodynamics in crystallization, providing molecular-level
insights for optimizing industrial protocols and predicting agrochemical
behavior under relevant environmental conditions.

### Consistent gauge theories for the slave particle representation of the strongly correlated $t$-$J$ model

This note aims to clarify the confusion and inconsistency, and to address the
incompleteness in our recent work [1,2]. In order to avoid the ill-defined
nature of the free propagator of the gauge field in the ordered states of the
$t$-$J$ model, we adopted a gauge fixing that was not of the
Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) exact form in our previous work [2]. This led
to the situation where Dirac's second-class constraints, namely, the slave
particle number constraint and the Ioffe-Larkin current constraint, were not
rigorously obeyed. Here we show that a consistent gauge fixing condition that
enforces the exact constraints must be BRST-exact. An example is the Lorenz
gauge. On the other hand, we prove that although the free propagator of the
gauge field in the Lorenz gauge is ill-defined, the full propagator is still
well-defined. This implies that the strongly correlated $t$-$J$ model can be
exactly mapped to a perturbatively controllable theory within the slave
particle representation.

We demonstrate the parametric modulation of a double quantum dot charge
dipole coupled to a cavity, at the cavity frequency, achieving an amplified
readout signal compared to conventional dispersive protocols. Our findings show
that the observed cavity field displacement originates from dipole radiation
within the cavity, rather than from a longitudinal coupling mechanism, yet
exhibits the same signatures while relying on a transverse coupling. By
carefully tuning the phase and amplitude of the intra-cavity field, we achieve
a $\pi$-phase shift between two dipole states, resulting in a substantial
enhancement of the signal-to-noise ratio. In addition to its applications in
quantum dot based qubits in cQED architectures, this protocol could serve as a
new promising tool for probing exotic electronic states in mesoscopic circuits
embedded in cavities.

### An exactly solvable asymmetric simple inclusion process

We study a generalization of the asymmetric simple inclusion process (ASIP)
on a periodic one-dimensional lattice, where the integers in the particles
rates are deformed to their $t$-analogues. We call this the $(q, t,
\theta)$~ASIP, where $q$ is the asymmetric hopping parameter and $\theta$ is
the diffusion parameter. We show that this process is a misanthrope process,
and consequently the steady state is independent of $q$. We compute the steady
state, the one-point correlation and the current in the steady state. In
particular, we show that the single-site occupation probabilities follow a
\emph{beta-binomial} distribution at $t=1$. We compute the two-dimensional
phase diagram in various regimes of the parameters $(t, \theta)$ and perform
simulations to justify the results. We also show that a modified form of the
steady state weights at $t \neq 1$ satisfy curious palindromic and
antipalindromic symmetries. Lastly, we define an enriched process at $t=1$ and
$\theta$ an integer which projects onto the $(q, 1, \theta)$~ASIP and whose
steady state is uniform, which may be of independent interest.

We developed an original natural thermostat algorithm to simulate the direct
change in interatomic distances with temperature in both an ideal crystal and a
system with a vacancy. In contrast to previous work, the results indicate that
in a system with a defect, the radii of the first ten coordination spheres
change nearly linearly with increasing temperature. However, the coefficients
determining these dependencies, unlike the interatomic distances farther from
the vacancy, are not equal to the linear thermal expansion coefficient of the
ideal crystal. The implications of these results are discussed.

In this study, we evaluate multi-configurational trial wave function
protocols for phaseless auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo (ph-AFQMC) on
transition metal containing systems. First, we benchmark vertical ionization
potentials for 22 3d transition metal complexes against published high-accuracy
ph-AFQMC values in a double zeta basis set. We then compute the vertical
ionization potential for a set of six metallocenes using our best-performing
protocol, alongside ph-AFQMC using a configuration interaction singles and
doubles (CISD) trial state. We also analyze the performance of canonical
coupled-cluster theory with singles, doubles and perturbative triples
(CCSD(T)), as well as its local approximation using domain-based local pair
natural orbitals (DLPNO-CCSD(T1)) using different reference orbitals. To reach
the complete-basis-set (CBS) limit, we examine several extrapolation schemes
and report CBS-limit ph-AFQMC and CCSD(T) values alongside experimental
results. We find that ph-AFQMC with the best-performing trial in a triple zeta
basis, followed by CBS correction from DLPNO-CCSD(T1) with unrestricted B3LYP
reference orbitals, yields small deviations from experiment at modest cost.
Using a CISD trial state in ph-AFQMC gives the closest agreement with
experiment (errors &lt; 2 kcal/mol), albeit with lower scalability.

### Cubic magnetic anisotropy in $B$20 magnets: Interplay of anisotropy and magnetic order in Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_{x}$Si

The metallic systems MnSi and Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_{x}$Si are known to feature a
generic magnetic phase diagram primarily determined by the isotropic exchange
and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. However, additional weaker
anisotropies, lowest in the hierarchy of energy scales, play a crucial role:
they determine the relative order of phases in the phase diagram and may even
enable skyrmion stability far below the ordering temperature. Among cubic B20
helimagnets, the insulator Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$ is currently the only known example
exhibiting a low-temperature, anisotropy-induced skyrmion pocket. In this
manuscript, we present a systematic study of cubic magnetocrystalline
anisotropy by means of angle-resolved SQUID magnetization measurements in MnSi
and Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_{x}$Si ($0.08 \leq x \leq 0.70$) single crystals and provide
quantitative values of the anisotropy constants. For Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_{x}$Si, the
cubic anisotropy is found to be strongly dependent on the Co concentration $x$.
In particular, for low Co concentrations ($x \sim 0.10$), the anisotropy is
sufficiently strong to stabilize a low-temperature skyrmion lattice, in
agreement with theoretical predictions. This finding suggests that
Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_{x}$Si may represent the first chiral metallic system to exhibit
a low-temperature skyrmion phase controllably stabilized by cubic anisotropy
for specific directions of the magnetic field.

### Superconductivity in the repulsive Hubbard model on different geometries induced by density-assisted hopping

- **TL;DR**: 研究了密度辅助跳跃对不同二聚化晶格几何结构的影响，发现其在二聚结构的低能带中诱导吸引相互作用，在高能带中诱导排斥相互作用，可能导致超导性出现。

We study the effect of density-assisted hopping on different dimerized
lattice geometries, such as bilayers and ladder structures. We show
analytically that the density-assisted hopping induces an attractive
interaction in the lower (bonding) band of the dimer structure and a repulsion
in the upper (anti-bonding) band. Overcoming the onsite repulsion, this can
lead to the appearance of superconductivity. The superconductivity depends
strongly on the filling, and present a pairing structure more complex than
s-wave pairing. Combining numerical and analytical methods such as the matrix
product states ansatz, bosonization and perturbative calculations we map out
the phase diagram of the two-leg ladder system and identify its superconducting
phase. We characterize the transition from the non-density-assisted repulsive
regime to the spin-gapped superconducting regime as a
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition.

We investigate topological band structures of a kagome system coupled to a
circularly polarized cavity mode, using a model based on a muffin-tin potential
and quantum light-matter interaction. We show that Chern insulating phases
emerge in the cavity-embedded kagome system due to the light-matter interaction
that breaks time-reversal symmetry. We also find that a nearly flat band can be
topologically nontrivial with a nonzero Chern number. By varying the
light-matter interaction, we also reveal that topological phase transitions
occur between different Chern insulating phases in the ultrastrong coupling
regime. The phase transitions change the sign of the Chern number, switching
the direction of the edge current. We demonstrate the existence of topological
edge modes in the cavity-embedded kagome Chern insulators by constructing a
low-energy effective tight-binding model.

We investigate the critical properties of kinetic continuous opinion dynamics
using deep learning techniques. The system consists of $N$ continuous spin
variables in the interval $[-1,1]$. Dense neural networks are trained on spin
configuration data generated via kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, accurately
identifying the critical point on both square and triangular lattices.
Classical unsupervised learning with principal component analysis reproduces
the magnetization and allows estimation of critical exponents. Additionally,
variational autoencoders are implemented to study the phase transition through
the loss function, which behaves as an order parameter. A correlation function
between real and reconstructed data is defined and found to be universal at the
critical point.

### Hidden integer quantum ferroelectricity in chiral Tellurium

Ferroelectricity is a cornerstone of functional materials research, enabling
diverse technologies from non-volatile memory to optoelectronics. Recently,
type-I integer quantum ferroelectricity (IQFE), unconstrained by symmetry, has
been proposed and experimentally demonstrated; however, as it arises from ionic
displacements of an integer lattice vector, the initial and final states are
macroscopically indistinguishable, rendering the physical properties unchanged.
Here, we propose for the first time the nontrivial counterpart (i.e., type-II
IQFE) where the polarization difference between the initial and final states is
quantized but the macroscopical properties differ. We further demonstrate the
existence of type-II IQFE in bulk chiral tellurium. In few-layer tellurium, the
total polarization remains nearly quantized, composed of a bulk-inherited
quantum component and a small surface-induced contribution. Molecular dynamics
simulations reveal surface-initiated, layer-by-layer switching driven by
reduced energy barriers, explaining why ferroelectricity was observed
experimentally in few-layer tellurium, but not in bulk tellurium yet.
Interestingly, the chirality of the initial and final states in bulk tellurium
is opposite, suggesting a novel way to control structural chirality with
electric field in chiral photonics and nonvolatile ferroelectric memory
devices.

We report a rich anisotropic magnetic phase diagram of Na$_3$Co$_2$SbO$_6$, a
previously proposed cobaltate Kitaev candidate, based on field- and
temperature-dependent magnetization, specific heat, and magnetocaloric effect
studies. At low temperatures, our experiments uncover a low-lying
$j_{\textrm{eff}} = \frac{1}{2}$ state with an antiferromagnetic ground state
and pronounced in-plane versus out-of-plane anisotropy. The experimentally
identified magnetic phases are theoretically characterized through classical
Monte Carlo simulations within an extended Kitaev-Heisenberg model with
additional ring exchange interactions. The resulting phase diagram reveals a
variety of exotic field-induced magnetic phases, including double-$\textbf{q}$,
$\frac{1}{3}$-AFM, zigzag, and vortex phases.

The coexistence of topological magnons and electrons in magnetic materials
presents a compelling route toward developing low-dissipation, multifunctional
spintronic devices. However, material systems enabling their simultaneous
realization and control remain largely unexplored. Here, we propose the
coexistence and concurrent tunability of magnonic and electronic Chern
insulator phases in Kitaev magnets and use MnBr$_{3}$ monolayer as a prototype.
We find the significant Kitaev interaction in MnBr$_{3}$ induces the magnonic
Chern insulator phase, manifesting as the magnon thermal Hall effect.
Concurrently, MnBr$_{3}$ exhibits the quantum anomalous Hall effect driven by
its electronic Chern insulator phase. Crucially, we demonstrate that these dual
topological phases can be simultaneously controlled by reorienting the in-plane
spins with an external magnetic field. Our findings not only deepen the
fundamental understanding of spin excitations in Kitaev magnets but also
provide a promising platform for exploring the interplay between electronic and
magnonic topology.

Here we use Dyson maps to restore monotonic entropy growth in those processes,

general and computationally tractable method applicable to a broad class of
Markovian systems.

Two-dimensional (2D) kagome materials have drawn extensive research interest
due to their unique electronic properties, like flat bands, magnetic
frustration, and topological quantum states, which enable precise quantum state
control and novel device innovation. Yet, simultaneously achieving high
stability, tunability, and multifunctionality in 2D kagome systems remains a
key material design challenge. In this study, we innovatively propose a new
paradigm for constructing two-dimensional multi-kagome-layer materials based on
the "1+3" design concept. By seamlessly integrating high-throughput screening
techniques, we have successfully identified 6,379 novel 2D multilayer kagome
candidates from a vast pool of candidates. These materials exhibit a rich
diversity of types, encompassing 173 metals, 27 semimetals, 166 ferromagnetic
semiconductors, and as many as 6,013 semiconductors. Furthermore, based on the
2D flat-band scoring criteria, we conducted a detailed analysis of the
flat-band characteristics of the energy bands near the Fermi level in the
predicted systems. Our findings reveal that approximately two-thirds of the
systems meet the 2D flat-band scoring criteria, and notably, several systems
exhibit nearly perfect flat-band characteristics. Our work provides an
excellent paradigm for the design and research of 2D multilayer kagome
materials

- **TL;DR**: 该论文研究了二维电子气与压电材料异质结构中声子放大的量子力学机制，展示了通过电子漂移电压实现声子自发和受激发射，并推导了增益和最大可实现强度。

We provide a quantum mechanical description of phonon amplification in a
heterostructure consisting of a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) stacked on
top of a piezoelectric material. An applied drift voltage effectively creates a
population inversion in the momentum states of the 2DEG electrons, giving rise
to spontaneous emission of phonons. Once an acoustic wave is launched, the
pumped electrons release phonons via stimulated emission, returning to depleted
ground states before being pumped back to the excited states. We show that
whereas efficient amplification using a 1D electron gas requires the acoustic
wavelength to roughly equal the average electron-electron spacing, a 2DEG
enables efficient amplification for any wavelength greater than the average
electron-electron spacing. We derive the imaginary and real parts of the 2DEG
first-order acoustic susceptibility as functions of electronic drift velocity
in specific limits and derive the gain per unit length for the signal and the
quantum noise, with the gain matching the classical result in the
short-electronic-lifetime (low-mobility) regime. Moreover, we analyze the gain
clamping due to pump depletion and calculate the maximum achievable intensity.
Our results provide a framework for designing novel acoustic devices including
a quantum phononic laser and phase-insensitive quantum phononic amplifiers.

- **TL;DR**: 本文开发了一种基于X射线磁圆二色性(XMCD)的显微成像方法，成功实现了对时间反演对称性破缺反铁磁体Mn3Sn中八极子磁畴的实时空间成像。

Novel antiferromagnets with broken time reversal symmetry (TRS) have launched
a new direction in spintronics research, combining the advantageous dynamical
properties of conventional antiferromagnets with the controllability typically
associated with ferromagnets. However, antiferromagnetic domains are
notoriously challenging to image in real-space. X-ray magnetic circular
dichroism (XMCD) offers a route to overcome this difficulty: XMCD contrast may
be finite in TRS-breaking antiferromagnets with an appropriate magnetic space
group. Here, we exploit this to image the octupole domains in a focused ion
beam-fabricated device of the non-collinear antiferromagnet Mn$_3$Sn. Using
scanning transmission x-ray microscopy, we spatially resolve the weak pre-edge
XMCD contrast (of 0.2%) that is sensitive to $T_z$, achieving a contrast
resolution better than 0.02%. We observe hysteretic switching of the octupole
order through both the XMCD contrast and the corresponding anomalous Hall
effect within the same device. These results confirm the bulk nature of this
contrast, and establish XMCD-based microscopy as a powerful real space imaging
method for TRS-breaking antiferromagnets, including altermagnets, enabling
future studies of their dynamics, switching, and symmetry-tunable phenomena.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文研究了超越低能区的自旋-电荷分离现象，通过哈伯德模型的强耦合展开建立了微观理论，并在实验相关条件下验证了非线性自旋-电荷模式在整个能带中的稳定性。

The fate of spin-charge separation beyond the low energy remains elusive up
to now. Here we develop a microscopic theory of the correlation functions using
the strong coupling expansion of the Hubbard model and demonstrate its validity
down to the experimentally relevant $r_{\rm s}&gt;1$. Evaluating the spectral
function, we show the general stability of the nonlinear spin-charge modes in
whole energy band and investigate all the nonlinear features systematically. We
confirm the general prediction experimentally in semiconductor quantum wires.
Furthermore, we observe a signal consistent with a continuum of the nonlinear
excitations and with a final spectral density around the $3 k_{\rm F}$ point,
indicating the robustness of the Hubbard model predictions for a finite range
interaction.

Floquet engineering offers a powerful route to enhance emission in
time-modulated media. Here, we investigate the influence of time-modulated
permittivity in silicon carbide on its intensity spectrum. We consider both the
nonequilibrium Green's function approach and the macroscopic quantum
electrodynamics approach, and establish their formal compatibility by deriving
the Lippmann-Schwinger equation in both cases. To analyze spectral features, we
propose several methods for decomposing the electric field into positive- and
negative-frequency components, along with the criteria required for physical
consistency. Our analytical and numerical results show that, when defined
appropriately, the intensity spectrum avoids divergence, though the resulting
enhancement remains modest. These findings provide a unified theoretical
foundation for modeling time-dependent media, and reinforce the utility of
Floquet engineering as a versatile platform for tailoring emission dynamics.

### Non-Hermitian Bethe-Salpeter Equation for Open Systems: Emergence of Exceptional Points in Excitonic Spectra from First Principles

In open quantum systems hosting excitons, dissipation mechanisms critically
shape the excitonic dynamics, band-structure and topological properties. A
microscopic understanding of excitons in such non-Hermitian settings demands a
first-principles generalization of the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE). Building
on a recently introduced nonequilibrium Green's function formalism compatible
with Lindbladian dynamics, we derive a non-Hermitian BSE from diagrammatic
perturbation theory on the Keldysh contour, and obtain a microscopic excitonic
Hamiltonian that incorporates dissipation while preserving causality. We apply
the formalism to valley excitons in transition metal dichalcogenides coupled to
structured photon baths. We uncover a rich landscape of exceptional points in
momentum space, forming either discrete sets or continuous manifolds, depending
on bath structure. The exceptional points give rise to nonanalytic
valley-polarization, unusual polarization pattern in photoluminescence, and
nontrivial topological signatures. Our results establish a first-principles
framework for predicting and controlling excitonic behavior in open quantum
materials, showing how engineered environments can be leveraged to induce and
manipulate non-Hermitian and topological properties.

We report a comprehensive first-principles study of the electronic and
optical properties of recently identified exfoliable one-dimensional
semiconducting materials, focusing on chalcogenide-based atomic chains derived
from van der Waals-bonded bulk crystals. Specifically, we investigate
covalently bonded S3 and Te3 chains, and polar-bonded As2S3 and Bi2Te3 chains,
using a fully first-principles approach that combines density-functional theory
(DFT), density-functional perturbation theory (DFPT), and many-body
perturbation theory within the GW approximation and Bethe-Salpeter equation
(BSE). Our vibrational analysis shows that freestanding isolated wires remain
dynamically stable, with the zone-center optical phonon modes leading to
infrared activity. The main finding of this study is the presence of very
strong exciton binding energies (1-3 eV), which make these novel 1D materials
ideal platforms for room-temperature excitonic applications. Interestingly, the
exciton character remains Wannier-Mott-like, as indicated by average
electron-hole separations larger than the lattice constant. Notably, the
optical gaps of these materials span a wide range - from infrared (0.8 eV,
Bi2Te3), through visible spectrum (yellow: 2.17 eV, Te3; blue: 2.71 eV, As2S3),
up to ultraviolet (4.07 eV, S3) - highlighting their versatility for broadband
optoelectronic applications. Our results offer a detailed, many-body
perspective on the optoelectronic behavior of these low-dimensional materials
and underscore their potential for applications in next-generation nanoscale
optoelectronic devices.

Rhombohedral graphene (rG) aligned with hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has
been shown to host flat bands that stabilize various strongly correlated
quantum phases, including Mott insulators, integer, and fractional quantum
anomalous Hall phases. In this work, we use scanning tunneling
microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) to visualize the dispersion of flat bands
with doping and applied displacement fields in a hBN-aligned rhombohedral
trilayer graphene (rtG)/hBN moir\'e superlattice. In addition to the intrinsic
flat bands of rtG induced by the displacement field, we observe low-energy
features originating from moir\'e potential-induced band folding. Real-space
variations of the spectroscopic features allow us to quantify the spatial
structure of the moir\'e potential at the rtG/hBN interface. Importantly, we
find that accurately capturing the moir\'e site-dependent spectra requires
incorporating a moir\'e potential acting on the top graphene layer with a sign
opposite to that of the bottom layer into the continuum model. Our results thus
provide key experimental and theoretical insights into understanding the role
of the moire superlattice in rG/hBN heterostructures.

### $β$-Ga$_2$O$_3$(001) surface reconstructions from first principles and experiment

We present a comprehensive investigation of reconstructions on
$\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$(001) combining first-principles calculations with
experimental observations. Using {\it ab initio} atomistic thermodynamics and
replica-exchange grand-canonical molecular dynamics simulations, we explore the
configurational space of possible reconstructions under varying chemical
potentials of oxygen and gallium. Our calculations reveal several stable
surface reconstructions, most notably a previously unreported 1$\times$2
reconstruction consisting of paired GaO$_4$ tetrahedra that exhibits remarkable
stability across a wide range of experimental growth conditions. In this
reconstruction, two Ga atoms share one oxygen bond and are separated by a
distance of \SI{2.64}{\angstrom} along the [010] direction. High-angle annular
dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy imaging of homoepitaxially
grown (001) layers is consistent with the predicted structure. Additional
investigations of possible indium substitution at the surface sites, which can
occur during metal-exchange catalysis growth, reveal a cooperative effect in In
incorporation, with distinct stability regions for In-substituted structures
under O-rich conditions. Our findings provide an understanding for controlling
surface properties during epitaxial growth of $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$(001).

### Strained Donor-Bound Excitons in $^{28}$Si

We present a comprehensive experimental study of the neutral donor to
donor-bound exciton transition (D$^0$$\rightarrow\,$D$^0$X) in isotopically
enriched $^{28}$Si, focusing on the group-V donors P, As, and Sb under finely
tuned uniaxial stress along the [100] and [110] crystal axes and magnetic
fields from 3.5 mT to 1.7 T. From these measurements, donor-specific
deformation potentials are extracted. The uniaxial electron deformation
potential $\Xi_\mathrm{u}$ is found to be significantly larger than values
reported for other states or transitions in silicon and shows a clear
dependence on the donor species, indicating an increased sensitivity of the
D$^0$X state to strain and central-cell effects. We also observe a magnetic
field dependence of the hole shear deformation potential $d$, suggesting a more
complex strain coupling mechanism than captured by standard theory. Diamagnetic
shift parameters determined from Zeeman spectra show good agreement with
earlier measurements. Our results provide a refined parameter set critical for
the design of silicon quantum devices based on D$^0$X transitions.

The design and fabrication of room-temperature magnetic semiconductors are
recognized worldwide as a great challenge, and of both theoretical and
practical importance in the field of spintronics. Compared with diluted
magnetic semiconductors, intrinsic room-temperature magnetic semiconductors
have rarely been developed. Reported herein is a magnetic semiconductor film
formed by supramolecular self-assembly based on uranyl and cyclodextrin, with
the Curie temperature above room temperature. The electrical measurements show
that the film exhibits typical p-type semiconductor characteristics with a
superhigh carrier mobility of 3200 cm2V-1s-1, which can help achieve an
excellent match with the n-type semiconductor. The room-temperature magnetic
semiconductor with superhigh hole mobility can be attributed to the formation
of ferrotoroidicity and the highly ordered transport channel. This work paves
the way for the application of ferrotoroidic materials in sensing, information
storage as well as flexible electronics.

### Magnetic Materials for Quantum Magnonics

Quantum magnonics studies the quantum properties of magnons, the quanta of
spin waves, and their application in quantum information processing. Progress
in this field depends on identifying magnetic materials with characteristics
tailored to the diverse requirements of magnonics and quantum magnonics. For
single-magnon excitation, its control, hybrid coupling, and entanglement, the
most critical property is the ability to support long magnon lifetimes. This
perspective reviews established and emerging magnetic materials, including
ferromagnetic metals, Heusler compounds, antiferromagnets, altermagnets,
organic and 2D van der Waals magnets, hexaferrites, and in particular yttrium
iron garnet (YIG), highlighting their key characteristics. YIG remains the
benchmark, with bulk crystals supporting sub-microsecond Kittel-mode lifetimes
and ultra-pure spheres achieving $\sim18\,\mu$s for dipolar-exchange magnons at
millikelvin temperatures. However, thin YIG films on gadolinium gallium garnet
(GGG) substrates suffer from severe lifetime reduction due to substrate-induced
losses. In contrast, YIG films on a new lattice matched, diamagnetic
alternative, yttrium scandium gallium/aluminum garnet (YSGAG), overcomes these
limitations and preserves low magnetic damping down to millikelvin
temperatures. These advances provide a practical pathway toward
ultralong-living magnons in thin films, enabling scalable quantum magnonics
with coherent transport, strong magnon-photon, magnon-qubit coupling, and
integrated quantum networks.

### Configurational Entropy-Driven Phase Stability and Thermal Transport in Rock-Salt High-Entropy Oxides

High-entropy oxides (HEOs) offer a unique platform for exploring the
thermodynamic interaction between configurational entropy and enthalpy in
stabilizing complex solid solutions. In this study, a series of rock-salt
structured oxides with varying configurational entropy, ranging from binary to
multi-cation systems, to elucidate the competing roles of enthalpy and entropy
in phase stabilization is investigated. Compositions including
(Ni$_{0.8}$Cu$_{0.2}$)O to(NiCuZnCoMg)$_{0.9}$A$_{0.1}$O (A = Li, Na, K) were
synthesized and their stuctural, microstructural and thermal properties have
been discussed. X-ray diffraction combined with thermal cycling confirms that
even a medium configurational entropy ($\sim$ 0.95R) can induce single-phase
behavior stabilized by configurational entropy ($\Delta S_{conf}$), challenging
the traditional threshold of $1.5\,R$. High-resolution TEM and EDS mapping
reveal nanocrytalline features and homogeneous elemental distribution
respectively, while XPS analysis confirms divalent oxidation states. A strong
coupling between high configurational entropy with thermal conductivity
($\kappa$) has been observed. First, a sharp decrease in $\kappa$ with
increasing $\Delta S_{conf}$ is seen and then decomposed samples (while
cooling) show high $\kappa$, demonstrating the role of $\Delta S_{conf}$ on
$\kappa$. Furthermore, Li-doped compositions exhibit improved thermoelectric
performance, with a maximum figure of merit ($zT$) of $\sim$0.15 at 1173K\,
driven by low thermal conductivity and favorable carrier transport. The results
highlight that configurational entropy, even at intermediate values, plays a
significant role in stabilizing disordered single-phase oxides and tailoring
phonon transport.

### Orientational Order of Phenyl Rotors on Triangular Platforms on Ag and Au(111)

We investigated trioxatriangulenium functionalized with phenyl (phenyl-TOTA)
on the (111) surfaces of Ag and Au using low-temperature scanning tunneling
microscopy (STM) and density functional theory (DFT). On Ag(111), the molecules
form hexagonal arrays, and on Au(111), honeycomb patterns are also observed.
The orientations of the phenyl moieties are resolved on both substrates. On
Ag(111), the orientations are parallel within a row and they differ by
approximately $60^\circ$ between adjacent molecular rows, and STM images
suggest dimerization of the molecules. DFT calculations for Ag(111) reveal that
van der Waals interactions dominate this system. The optimized structure
matches the experimental pattern, and the simulated STM images exhibit apparent
dimerization. This dimerization results from an asymmetry of the phenyl
wavefunction, which reflects intramolecular hydrogen bonding between the ligand
and an oxygen atom within the triangulenium platform. The orientation of the
phenyl moieties is explained by the interaction of each phenyl moiety with its
triangulenium platform combined with the direct long-range interaction between
phenyl moieties across molecules.

We report experiments on the magnetophoresis of paramagnetic (MnCl2) and
diamagnetic (ZnCl2) metal ions in porous media under the influence of a
non-uniform magnetic field generated by a permanent magnet. Experiments were
carried out in a range of initial ion concentrations (1-100 mM), porous media
particle sizes (63 um and 500 um), and varying mixture ratios of metal ion
concentrations. For single-ion magnetophoresis, paramagnetic MnCl2 migrated
toward the magnet surface, with an enrichment of approximately 2-4 percent near
regions of high magnetic field. Conversely, diamagnetic ZnCl2 moved away from
regions of highest magnetic field gradients, with depletion levels of 0.5-1.8
percent relative to the initial concentration. Our results demonstrate that
magnetophoresis is directly proportional to porous media particle size,
increasing with larger particle sizes, a trend attributed to the reduced drag
forces experienced by the ions in media with larger particles. Interestingly,
in binary mixtures, both MnCl2 and ZnCl2 migrated toward regions of highest
magnetic field, contrary to their individual behaviors. The magnetophoretic
effect of MnCl2 was diminished with increasing concentrations of ZnCl2,
indicating interactions between the two ions. These findings suggest that both
metal ions undergo field-induced cluster formation, with cluster sizes in the
micrometer range, in both single and binary ion systems. In binary mixtures,
the two ions appear to interact, potentially forming mixed clusters containing
both MnCl2 and ZnCl2.

While diffusion models are attracting increasing attention for the design of
novel materials, their ability to generate low-energy structures in unexplored
chemical spaces has not been systematically assessed. Here, we evaluate the
performance of two diffusion models, MatterGen and DiffCSP, against three
databases: a ternary oxide set (constructed by a genetic algorithm), a ternary
nitride set (constructed by template informatics), and the GNoME database
(constructed by a combination of both). We find that diffusion models generally
perform stably in well-sampled chemical spaces (oxides and nitrides), but are
less effective in uncommon ones (GNoME), which contains many compositions
involving rare-earth elements and unconventional stoichiometry. Finally, we
assess their size-extrapolation capability and observe a significant drop in
performance when the number of atoms exceeds the trained range. This is
attributed to the limitations imposed by periodic boundary conditions, which we
refer to as the curse of periodicity. This study paves the way for future
developments in materials design by highlighting both the strength and the
limitations of diffusion models.

Deep learning has revolutionized computer vision, yet a major gap persists
between complex, data-hungry deep learning models and the practical demands of
state-of-the-art scientific measurements. To fundamentally bridge this gap, we
propose deep prior-based denoising, a robust deep learning model that requires
no training data. We demonstrate its effectiveness by removing grid artifacts
in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), a long-standing and
critical data analysis challenge in materials science. Our results demonstrate
that deep prior-based denoising yields clearer ARPES images in a fraction of
the time required by conventional, experiment-based denoising methods. This
ultra-efficient approach to ARPES will enable high-speed, high-resolution
three-dimensional band structure mapping in momentum space, thereby
dramatically accelerating our understanding of microscopic electronic
structures of materials. Beyond ARPES, deep prior-based denoising represents a
versatile tool that could become a new standard in any advanced scientific
measurement fields where data acquisition is limited.

We report a family of luminescent alternant diradicals which, at room
temperature, support a ground-state spin-triplet, near-unity photoluminescence
quantum yields, and optical spin addressability. These diradicals comprise
trityl groups meta-linked via pyridyl or phenyl groups, enabling optically
bright triplet-to-triplet and singlet-to-singlet transitions. At room
temperature, we observe optically detected magnetic resonance in these systems
at zero magnetic field and a strong magneto-photoluminescence (10% modulation
at 2 mT applied magnetic field). Distinct photoluminescence bands (at 630 nm
and 700 nm) show opposite-sign spin-optical responses, arising from
spin-selective intersystem crossing between triplet and singlet manifolds.
These bright, all-organic diradicals offer a new set of chemically tunable
materials for room temperature spin-optical interfaces, paving the way for
application as quantum sensors.

Functional nanomaterials, including 2D materials and their heterostructures
are expected to impact fields ranging from catalysis, optoelectronics to
nanophotonics. To realize their potential, novel experimental approaches need
to be developed to characterize the combined materials and their components.
Techniques using fast electrons, such as electron energy-loss spectroscopy
(EELS), probe phenomena over an unrivaled energy range with high resolution. In
addition, momentum-resolved EELS simultaneously records energy and momentum
transfer to the sample and thus generates two-dimensional data sets for each
beam position. This allows excitations that occur at large momentum transfer to
be resolved, including those outside of the light cone and beyond the first
Brillouin zone, all whilst retaining nanometer sized spatial selectivity. Such
capabilities are particularly important when probing phonons, plasmons,
excitons and their coupling in 2D materials and their heterostructures.

- **TL;DR**: 铂作为酸性介质中析氢反应的最常用电催化剂，被发现存在氢/氘向铂体相扩散的现象，这挑战了传统认为铂-质子相互作用仅限于表面的观点。

Platinum, to date, is the most widely applied electrocatalyst for hydrogen
evolution reaction (HER) in acidic media. It is assumed to be a proton-blocking
catalyst with only surface-limited adsorption of the reaction intermediates.
Here, we critically evaluate the bulk interaction of Pt with hydrogen (H), and
its heavier isotope deuterium (D), by monitoring operando mass change of the Pt
electrode during galvanostatic heavy/water splitting by employing an
electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance. Unexpectedly, we observe an
irreversible temporal mass gain and a change in the reaction's overpotential,
arising from diffusion of H/D into Pt, confirmed by atom probe tomography and
thermal desorption spectroscopy. Sub-surface concentration of at least ca. 15
at. % of D in Pt was observed, diffusing down to a depth of more than 10 nm.
Analytical description quantified the diffusion coefficient of D in Pt to be
3.2X10^-18 cm2Xs-1. These findings challenge the existing credence of Pt-proton
interaction being limited to the surface, prompting the expansion of the
catalyst design strategies to account for property-modifying bulk diffusion of
H/D in the Pt matrix

- **TL;DR**: 该论文研究了在块状锗中使用圆偏振光进行轨道极化的光学注入，发现空穴的轨道极化率可显著超过100%。

Optical orientation has been proven as a powerful tool to inject
spin-polarized electron and hole populations in III-V and group-IV
semiconductors. In particular, the absorption of circularly-polarized light in
bulk Ge generates a spin-oriented population of electrons in the conduction
band with a spin-polarization up to 50%, whereas the hole spin-polarization,
opposite to the electron one, can even reach values up to 83%. In this letter,
we theoretically investigate the optical injection of orbital polarization by
means of circularly-polarized light in bulk Ge and we show that the latter
considerably exceeds 100% for holes and photon energies close to the direct Ge
gap. These results suggest that Ge is a convenient platform for future
development of orbitronics and opto-orbitronic devices.

- **TL;DR**: 本研究预测了一种新型SnSiGeN4 MXene单层材料，作为OER、ORR和HER反应的高效催化剂，其性能可与铂基催化剂相媲美，且优于铱基系统。

The development of efficient and cost-effective catalysts for clean energy
conversion remains a central challenge in materials science. Although platinum
serves as the benchmark catalyst, its scarcity and high cost hinder large-scale
deployment. In this study, we propose a newly predicted SnSiGeN4 MXene-family
monolayer as a promising candidate for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER),
oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Using
first-principles calculations, we systematically investigated its electronic,
vibrational, and optical properties across multiple exchange-correlation
functionals, including hybrid approaches, revealing a wide and tunable band
gap. Simulated infrared and Raman spectra further confirm the dynamical
stability and the presence of catalytically active sites. Guided by these
findings, we studied photocatalytic reaction analyses that demonstrate that the
computed overpotentials for OER, ORR, and HER are comparable to those of
Pt-based catalysts and outperform Ir-based systems, positioning SnSiGeN4 as a
sustainable, high-performance platform for next-generation
UV-visible-light-driven photocatalysis.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究探索了由Janus PtSSe和WXY组成的范德华异质结构在光催化应用中的潜力，特别关注其在HER、OER和CO2还原反应中的性能。

Semiconductor photocatalysis offers a sustainable route for converting solar
energy into chemical energy, enabling the production of clean fuels and
valuable chemical products. To this aim, we explore van der Waals
heterostructures made up of Janus PtSSe and WXY (X, Y $=$ S, Se, Te and X
$\neq$Y), in the context of photocatalytic applications. The redox capabilities
of various heterostructure configurations (atom facing types and stacking
orders) are evaluated by aligning the absolute band edge positions with respect
to redox potentials of hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction (HER and OER) and
CO$_2$ reduction reactions. The stability of photocatalyst candidates are
checked by layer binding energy calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics
simulations. The optical absorption spectra suggest good light absorption in
the visible range. Further, strain engineering is applied as a way to tune band
edges and evaluate the possible use of the heterostructures as photocatalysts.
This study shows that van der Waals heterostructure bilayers composed of Janus
PtSSe and WSeTe in specific geometric configurations can be potential materials
as photocatalysts for HER, OER and CO$_2$ reduction reactions. Finally, we
suggest that, although systems made up of PtSSe and WSTe cannot be used for
photocatalytic applications, they can be explored for applications in
thermoelectric energy conversion or infrared photovoltaics.
