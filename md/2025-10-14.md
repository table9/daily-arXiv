### Scaling Properties of Avalanche Activity in the Two-Dimensional Abelian Sandpile Model

- **TL;DR**: 研究二维Abelian沙堆模型中雪崩活动的标度特性，通过分析站点活动分布而非传统的雪崩大小分布，发现该分布遵循有限尺寸标度形式，揭示了典型和高活跃站点之间的交叉行为。

We study the scaling properties of avalanche activity in the two-dimensional
Abelian sandpile model. Instead of the conventional avalanche size
distribution, we analyze the site activity distribution, which measures how
often a site participates in avalanches when grains are added across the
lattice. Using numerical simulations for system sizes up to \(L = 160\),
averaged over \(10^4\) configurations, we determine the probability
distribution \(P(A, L)\) of site activities. The results show that \(P(A, L)\)
follows a finite-size scaling form \[ P(A, L) \sim L^{-2}
F\Big(\frac{A}{L^2}\Big). \] For small values \(A \ll L^2\) the scaling
function behaves as \[ F(u) \sim u^{-1/2}, \quad \text{corresponding to} \quad
P(A) \sim \frac{1}{L}, \] while for large activities \(A \sim O(L^2)\) the
distribution decays as \[ F(u) \sim \exp\big(-c_3 u - c_4 u^2\big). \] The
crossover between these two regimes occurs at \[ A^* \sim 0.1 \, L^2, \]
marking the threshold between typical and highly excitable sites. This
characterization of local avalanche activity provides complementary information
to the usual avalanche size statistics, highlighting how local regions serve as
frequent conduits for critical dynamics. These results may help connect
sandpile models to real-world self-organized critical systems where only
partial local activity can be observed.

### Ensemble-Based Data Assimilation for Material Model Characterization in High-Velocity Impact

- **TL;DR**: 提出基于集成卡尔曼滤波的数据同化框架，可从单个高速冲击试验中自动校准材料模型的塑性、断裂和状态方程参数，提高材料模型表征的效率和准确性。

High-fidelity simulations are essential for understanding and predicting the
behavior of materials under high-velocity impact (HVI) in both fundamental
research and practical applications. However, their accuracy relies on material
models and parameters that are traditionally obtained through manual fitting to
multiple time- and labor-intensive experiments. This study presents an
ensemble-based data assimilation (DA) framework to automatically and
simultaneously calibrate plasticity, fracture, and equation of state (EOS)
parameters from a single HVI test. The framework integrates Smoothed Particle
Hydrodynamics for HVI simulations, the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) for
parameter refinement, and adaptive covariance inflation to mitigate uncertainty
underestimation. The approach is demonstrated using synthetic back-face
deflection data from an AZ31B magnesium plate to identify Johnson-Cook
plasticity/fracture and Mie-Gruneisen EOS parameters. Test cases with biased
initial guesses and limited data show the EnKF-based framework accurately
recovers sensitive parameters in few iterations, indicated by a convergent
ensemble standard deviation. Conversely, insensitive parameters converge to
incorrect values with persistently large standard deviations. Limited
observational data can still achieve convergence but requires more iterations.
Under extreme prior bias, sensitive parameters may exhibit a drift-then-stall
behavior with small residual biases. In practice, the ensemble standard
deviation thus provides a diagnostic tool to assess parameter sensitivity and
calibration accuracy. This study demonstrates the proposed DA framework is a
robust and efficient tool for HVI material model characterization.

### Conformal Data for the O(3) Wilson-Fisher CFT from Fuzzy Sphere Realization of Quantum Rotor Model

- **TL;DR**: 在模糊球上构建了具有O(3)对称性的强相互作用费米子模型，实现了(2+1)维O(3)Wilson-Fisher普适类的量子相变，并通过数值方法获得了共形场论数据。

We present a model for strongly interacting fermions with internal O(3)
symmetry on the fuzzy-sphere that (i) preserves the rotational symmetry of the
fuzzy sphere and (ii) undergoes a quantum phase transition in the
(2+1)-dimensional O(3) Wilson-Fisher universality class. Using exact
diagonalization (ED) and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), we locate
the quantum critical point via conformal perturbation theory and obtain scaling
dimensions from finite-size spectra. We identify 24 primary operators and
determine some of their operator product expansion coefficients through
first-order conformal perturbation theory. The results are benchmarked against
conformal bootstrap and large quantum-number expansions and reveal a weakly
irrelevant operator that plays a role in dimerized antiferromagnets. Our work
establishes the fuzzy sphere as a general framework for quantitatively
accessing conformal data in non-Abelian conformal field theories (CFTs).

- **TL;DR**: 该研究发现CsV3Sb5材料中的临界电流振荡源于其固有的约瑟夫森结网络，这些结在临界温度以下形成，表现出量子化的Shapiro台阶和复杂的超导干涉效应。

Materials with a Kagome lattice are intensely studied because they host
novel, exotic states that combine strong correlations and electronic topology.
The AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, Cs) group, in particular, is of major interest due to
its combination of charge density waves, unconventional superconductivity, and
indications of time-reversal symmetry breaking and electronic nematicity.
Recently, critical current oscillations in an external magnetic field were
observed in an unstructured flake of CsV3Sb5 at low current densities. In this
work, we unequivocally show that the origin of these oscillations is a network
of Josephson junctions intrinsic to the flake that emerges below its critical
temperature. Under radio-frequency radiation, we observe perfectly quantized,
integer Shapiro steps. The sensitivity of the step height to the contact
placement indicates a rich and complex network of junctions. By performing
interference studies along multiple field directions, we demonstrate that the
observed interference effects are a result of geometrically small junctions and
filamentary supercurrent flow. Upon microstructuring the flake, prominent
features of the interference pattern are fully preserved, illustrating the
localized nature of these flakes and their stability to thermal cycles. These
results pave the way for determining the exact nature of superconductivity in
the AV3Sb5 family.

- **TL;DR**: 开发了一个新的氨燃烧详细动力学机理，通过整合最新可靠的热化学和动力学参数，减少估算参数数量，提高了预测可靠性。

Ammonia is a promising zero-carbon fuel for industrial and transport
applications, but its combustion is hindered by flame instabilities, incomplete
oxidation, and the formation of nitrogen oxides. Accurate and detailed kinetic
models are critical for designing optimal burners and engines. Despite numerous
mechanisms published in recent years, large discrepancies remain between model
predictions and experimental data, particularly for NOx species. In this work,
we have reviewed the literature to obtain the most up-to-date and reliable
thermochemical and kinetic parameters for most reactions present in ammonia
combustion, and for reactions for which these parameters are not available, we
performed high-level calculations to determine them. The purpose of this was to
minimize the number of estimated parameters used in model development. A new,
detailed kinetic mechanism was then generated with the Reaction Mechanism
Generator (RMG). To ensure physical consistency, geometry optimizations were
carried out for all hypothesized 'edge' species, and any non-convergent or
non-physical structures were excluded. The resulting mechanism was tested
against experimental laminar burning velocities, ignition delay time, flow
reactor species profiles, and jet-stirred reactor data, and compared with five
recent representative mechanisms. Recently developed bath-gas-mixture rules
were applied to a number of key reactions in the mechanism, and we found this
to result in better agreement with experiment for a number of modeling targets.
While the mechanism does not reproduce all experimental results, it
demonstrates improved robustness without parameter tuning, thereby reducing the
risk of over-fitting and enhancing predictive reliability under conditions
relevant to practical applications.

### Enhancement of diffusivity and plastic deformation in ultrasound-assisted cold spray of tungsten: a molecular dynamics study

- **TL;DR**: 超声波辅助冷喷涂可显著增强钨的自扩散性和塑性变形，促进界面合金化，为高熔点金属的增材制造提供可行方案。

Tungsten ($W$) is widely valued for its exceptional thermal stability,
mechanical strength, and corrosion resistance, making it an ideal candidate for
high-performance military and aerospace applications. However, its high melting
point and inherent brittleness pose significant challenges for processing $W$
using additive manufacturing (AM). Cold spray (CS), a solid-state AM process
that relies on high-velocity particle impact and plastic deformation, offers a
promising alternative. In this study, we employ atomistic simulations to
investigate the feasibility of CS for tungsten. We show that ultrasound
perturbation can significantly enhance the self-diffusivity and plastic
deformation of $W$ compared to the negligible diffusion and plastic deformation
observed in non-ultrasound-assisted CS of $W$. For different impact velocities,
particle sizes, and ultrasound parameters, we demonstrate that
ultrasound-assisted viscoplasticity enhances self-diffusivity by inhibiting
grain boundaries and incorporating softening in $W$. Moreover, we found that
this enhanced diffusion in ultrasound-assisted $W$ can be exploited to promote
interdiffusion at the particle-substrate interface, enabling in situ alloy
formation. Through the formation of an equimolar $V$-$W$ alloy on a $W$
substrate using ultrasound-assisted CS simulations, we observed distinct
mechanical properties and a reduced dislocation density in the deposited
coating compared to a pure tungsten substrate. These results highlight the
potential of ultrasound-assisted CS as a viable approach for fabricating
uniform coatings and engineered alloys, addressing key limitations in the AM of
refractory metals.

Electron-electron scattering processes involving Landau levels of two subband
are considered. A matrix of electron-electron scattering rates containing all
tipes of transitions between Landau levels is calculated/ This matrix is
analized, and the relative rates of transitions of different types are

electron-electron scattering processes is ectablished.

### Manipulating the metal-insulator transitions in correlated vanadium dioxide through bandwidth and band-filling control

- **TL;DR**: 通过带宽和能带填充控制，在VO2薄膜中实现了金属-绝缘体转变(MIT)特性的有效调控，利用RuO2缓冲层厚度调节面内拉伸应变，使MIT转变温度在超过20K的宽范围内可调，并揭示了质子演化驱动的结构转变和氢化引发的载流子离域机制。

The metal-insulator transition (MIT) in correlated oxide systems opens up a
new paradigm to trigger the abruption in multiple physical functionalities,
enabling the possibility in unlocking exotic quantum states beyond conventional
phase diagram. Nevertheless, the critical challenge for practical device
implementation lies in achieving the precise control over the MIT behavior of
correlated system across a broad temperature range, ensuring the operational
adaptability in diverse environments. Herein, correlated vanadium dioxide (VO2)
serves as a model system to demonstrate effective modulations on the MIT
functionality through bandwidth and band-filling control. Leveraging the
lattice mismatching between RuO2 buffer layer and TiO2 substrate, the in-plane
tensile strain states in VO2 films can be continuously adjusted by simply
altering the thickness of buffer layer, leading to a tunable MIT property over
a wide range exceeding 20 K. Beyond that, proton evolution is unveiled to drive
the structural transformation of VO2, with a pronounced strain dependence,
which is accompanied by hydrogenation-triggered collective carrier
delocalization through hydrogen-related band filling in t2g band. The present
work establishes an enticing platform for tailoring the MIT properties in
correlated electron systems, paving the way for the rational design in exotic
electronic phases and physical phenomena.

### Interplay of choice and topology in percolation on mediation-driven attachment networks

- **TL;DR**: 研究了MDA网络上的键渗流，在广义Achlioptas过程中，通过best-of-M规则选择最小化簇大小的键。发现临界点和普适类对度指数ω依赖弱，但对选择参数M依赖强。M=2时连续变化，M=3和M=4显示爆炸性渗流但仍为连续相变，M=4产生更尖锐的序-无序转变。

We investigate bond percolation on mediation-driven attachment (MDA) networks
under the generalized Achlioptas process, where $M&gt;1$ candidate bonds are
sampled and the one that minimizes the resulting cluster size is selected the
best-of-$M$ rule. This framework offers a systematic approach to investigate
how network topology and choice mechanisms jointly shape percolation behavior.
We analyze the effects of the degree exponent $\omega$ and the choice parameter
$M$ on the critical point $t_c$ and the critical exponents
($\beta,\alpha,\gamma$), which define universality classes and obey the
Rushbrooke inequality $\alpha + 2\beta + \gamma \geq 2$. Using entropy, the
order parameter, and their derivatives (representing specific heat and
susceptibility respectively), we show that both $t_c$ and the universality
class depend only weakly on $\omega$ but strongly on $M$, while the Rushbrooke
inequality remains valid throughout. For $M=2$, the order parameter varies
continuously without a clear order-disorder transition. By contrast, $M=3$ and
$M=4$ display explosive percolation that still corresponds to a continuous
phase transition, with $M=4$ producing a significantly sharper and clearer
order-disorder transition. This sharpening is traced to an enhanced powder-keg
effect at larger $M$, underscoring the entropic origin of explosive
percolation.

### QCell: Comprehensive Quantum-Mechanical Dataset Spanning Diverse Biomolecular Fragments

- **TL;DR**: QCell数据集包含52.5万个新的量子力学计算，涵盖碳水化合物、核酸、脂质等生物分子片段，结合现有数据共4100万个分子系统，使用PBE0+MBD(-NL)方法计算，为训练下一代机器学习力场提供重要资源。

Recent advances in machine learning force fields (MLFFs) are revolutionizing
molecular simulations by bridging the gap between quantum-mechanical (QM)
accuracy and the computational efficiency of mechanistic potentials. However,
the development of reliable MLFFs for biomolecular systems remains constrained
by the scarcity of high-quality, chemically diverse QM datasets that span all
of the major classes of biomolecules expressed in living cells. Crucially, such
a comprehensive dataset must be computed using non-empirical or minimally
empirical approximations to solving the Schr\"odinger equation. To address
these limitations, we introduce the QCell dataset -- a curated collection of
525k new QM calculations for biomolecular fragments encompassing carbohydrates,
nucleic acids, lipids, dimers, and ion clusters. QCell complements existing
datasets, bringing the total number of available data points to 41 million
molecular systems, all calculated using hybrid density functional theory with
nonlocal many-body dispersion interactions, as captured by the PBE0+MBD(-NL)
level of quantum mechanics. The QCell dataset therefore provides a valuable
resource for training next-generation MLFFs capable of modeling the intricate
interactions that govern biomolecular dynamics beyond small molecules and
proteins.

### CuPyMag: GPU-Accelerated Finite-Element Micromagnetics with Magnetostriction

- **Categories**: physics.comp-ph
- **TL;DR**: CuPyMag是一个基于Python的开源微磁模拟框架，支持磁致伸缩效应，通过GPU加速实现大规模模拟，速度比CPU代码快两个数量级。

We introduce CuPyMag, an open-source, Python-based framework for large-scale
micromagnetic simulations with magnetostriction. CuPyMag solves micromagnetics
with finite elements in a GPU-resident workflow in which key operations, such
as right-hand-side assembly, spatial derivatives, and volume averages, are
tensorized using CuPy's BLAS-accelerated backend. Benchmark tests show that the
GPU solvers in CuPyMag achieve a speedup of up to two orders of magnitude
compared to the CPU codes. Its runtime grows linearly/sublinearly with problem
size, demonstrating high efficiency. Additionally, CuPyMag uses the
Gauss-Seidel projection method for time integration, which not only allows
stable time steps (up to 11 ps) but also solves each governing equation with
only 1-3 conjugate-gradient iterations without preconditioning. CuPyMag
accounts for magnetoelastic coupling and far-field effects arising from the
boundary of the magnetic body, both of which play an important role in
magnetization reversal in the presence of local defects. CuPyMag solves these
computationally intensive multiphysics simulations with a high-resolution mesh
(up to 3M nodes) in under three hours on an NVIDIA H200 GPU. This acceleration
enables micromagnetic simulations with non-trivial defect geometries and
resolves nanoscale magnetic structures. It expands the scope of micromagnetic
simulations towards realistic, large-scale problems that can guide experiments.
More broadly, CuPyMag is developed using widely adopted Python libraries, which
provide cross-platform compatibility, ease of installation, and accessibility
for adaptations to diverse applications.

### Two-dimensional superconducting diode effect in topological insulator/superconductor heterostructure

- **TL;DR**: 在二维拓扑绝缘体/超导体异质结构中首次观察到超导二极管效应，该效应在涡旋蠕变区域表现出非互易性，由涡旋流动不稳定性驱动。

The superconducting diode effect (SDE) is characterized by the nonreciprocity
of Cooper-pair motion with respect to current direction. In three-dimensional
(3D) materials, SDE results in a critical current that varies with direction,
making the effect distinctly observable: the material exhibits
superconductivity in one direction while behaving as a resistive metal in the
opposite direction. However, in genuinely two-dimensional (2D) materials, the
critical current density is theoretically zero, leaving the manifestation of
SDE in the 2D limit an intriguing challenge. Here, we present the observation
of SDE in a heterostructure composed of the topological insulator Bi$_2$Te$_3$
and the iron based superconductor Fe(Se,Te) $-$a candidate for topological
superconductor$-$ where superconductivity is confined to the 2D limit. The
observed I-V characteristics reveal nonreciprocity in the vortex-creep regime,
where finite voltages arise due to the two-dimensional nature of
superconductivity. Furthermore, our 2D film demonstrates abrupt voltage jumps,
influenced by both the current flow direction and the transverse magnetic field
direction. This behavior resembles that of 3D materials but, in this case, is
driven by the vortex-flow instability, as illustrated by voltage controlled
S-shaped I-V curves. These results underscore the pivotal role of vortex
dynamics in SDE and provide new insights into the interplay between symmetry
breaking and two-dimensionality in topological insulator/superconductor
systems.

- **TL;DR**: 在量子霍尔-超导体界面测量热电效应，发现热传输通过热点形成和非平衡电子分布实现，电压在量子霍尔平台改变符号，对涡旋重排有响应。

The interfaces of quantum Hall insulators with superconductors have emerged
as a promising platform to realise interesting physics that may be relevant for
topologically protected quantum computing. However, these interfaces can host
other effects which obscure the detection of the desired excitations. Here we
present measurements of the thermoelectric effect at the quantum
Hall-superconductor interface. We explain the heat transport by considering the
formation of a hotspot at the interface, which results in a non-equilibrium
distribution of electrons that can propagate across the superconductor through
vortex cores. The observed thermoelectric effect results in a voltage which
changes sign on quantum Hall plateaus and responds to the rearrangement of
vortices in the wire. These observations highlight the complex interplay of
thermal and charge phenomena at the quantum Hall -- superconductor interfaces
and should be considered when interpreting transport measurements in similar
systems.

### Dipole Alignment and Layered Flow Structure in Pressure-Driven Water Transport through MoS$_{2}$ Membranes

Efficient water transport through nanostructure membranes is essential for
advancing filtration and desalination technologies. In this study, we
investigate the flow of water through molybdenum disulfide (MoS$_{2}$)
nanopores of varying diameters using molecular dynamics simulations. The
results demonstrate that both pore size and atomic edge composition play
crucial roles in regulating water flux, molecular organization, and dipole
orientation. Larger pores facilitate the formation of layered water structures
and promote edge-accelerated flow, driven by strong electrostatic interactions
between water molecules and exposed molybdenum atoms. In narrower pores,
confinement and asymmetric edge chemistry induce the ordered alignment of
dipoles, thereby enhancing directional transport. Velocity and density maps
reveal that pore edges act as active zones, concentrating flow and reducing
resistance. These findings highlight the significance of pore geometry, surface
chemistry, and molecular dynamics in influencing water behavior within
MoS$_{2}$ membranes, providing valuable insights for the design of advanced
nanofluidic and water purification systems.

### Ferromagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy on the Kagome Magnet MgMn$_6$Sn$_6$

MgMn$_6$Sn$_6$ is the itinerant ferromagnet on the kagome lattice with high
ordering temperature featuring complex electronic properties due to the
nontrivial topological electronic band structure, where the spin-orbit coupling
(SOC) plays a crucial role. Here, we report a detailed ferromagnetic resonance
(FMR) spectroscopic study of MgMn$_6$Sn$_6$ aimed to elucidate and quantify the
intrinsic magnetocrystalline anisotropy that is responsible for the alignment
of the Mn magnetic moments in the kagome plane. By analyzing the frequency,
magnetic field, and temperature dependences of the FMR modes, we have
quantified the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy density that reaches the
value of approximately $ 3.5\cdot 10^6$ erg/cm$^3$ at $T = 3$ K and reduces to
about $1\cdot 10^6$ erg/cm$^3$ at $T = 300$ K. The revealed significantly
strong magnetic anisotropy suggests a sizable contribution of the orbital
magnetic moment to the spin magnetic moment of Mn, supporting the scenario of
the essential role of SOC for the nontrivial electronic properties of
MgMn$_6$Sn$_6$.

### Proof of the exact diffusion constant via first passage time in quasi-periodic potentials

- **TL;DR**: 该论文证明了Lifson-Jackson公式不仅适用于周期势场，也适用于准周期势场中的布朗运动，通过平均首次通过时间方法精确推导了有效扩散常数的表达式。

Brownian motion in terms of Lifson and Jackson (LJ) formula has been widely
explored in periodic systems and it has been believed for a long time that the
LJ formula only applies to periodic potentials. Recently we show that for the
following Brownian motion $\gamma \dot{x} = -U'(x) + \xi$, where $U(x)$ is the
quasi-periodic potential, the effective diffusion constant can still be
described by the LJ formula $D^* = D/(\langle \exp(\beta U)\rangle \langle
\exp(-\beta U)\rangle)$, where the average is redefined as $\langle \exp(\beta
U)\rangle = \lim_{L\rightarrow \infty} L^{-1} \int_0^L \exp(\beta U(x))dx$. In
this manuscript we prove this result exactly using the mean first passage time
$\tau(x)$, with boundary conditions $\tau(\pm L) = 0$, and show that the
effective diffusion constant can be determined using $D^* =\lim_{L \rightarrow
\infty} L^2/(2\tau(0))$, where $\pm L$ is the two positions of the absorbing
boundary. We exactly solve the equation of motion of $\tau(x)$ and obtain the
above result with the aid of Jacobi-Anger expansion method. Our result can be
generalized to the other potentials and even higher dimensions, which can
greatly broaden our understanding of Brownian motion in more general
circumstances. The requirement for a well-defined effective diffusion constant

Feynman path integrals (PIs) have found many uses in approximate quantum
dynamics methods that are able to efficiently calculate real-time quantum
correlation functions. The PIs typically take the form of discrete imaginary
time slices over a closed path, where the slices form the ``beads'' of a ring
polymer (RP) necklace. Some methods, such as centroid molecular dynamics (CMD),
use the RP to generate an effective potential for the dynamics, while others,
like RP molecular dynamics (RPMD), directly utilize the RP in real-time
dynamics in order to incorporate quantum effects. The standard, discretized
bead forms of CMD and RPMD can require a large number of RP beads to provide
accurate results for systems where quantum effects are strong, such as at low
temperatures. In Paper I, we introduced the bead-Fourier (BF) CMD method, where
we utilized the inclusion of a Fourier sine series to reduce the number of
beads needed to converge the CMD effective potential up to eightfold. In this
work, we extend RPMD to incorporate BF-PIs in the form of BF-RPMD. We study a
number of different implementations of the method through the calculation of
correlation functions for both linear and non-linear operators. The
effectiveness of the BF-RPMD method is sensitive to both the system and form of
the operators being studied, but we show that this method is able to produce
results on par with standard RPMD, with at worst twofold and up to eightfold
reduction in the number of beads by including two to three Fourier components.

Classical computation of electronic properties in large-scale materials
remains challenging. Quantum computation has the potential to offer advantages
in memory footprint and computational scaling. However, general and practical
quantum algorithms for simulating large-scale materials are still lacking. We
propose and implement random-state quantum algorithms to calculate
electronic-structure properties of real materials. Using a random state circuit
with only a few qubits, we employ real-time evolution with first-order Trotter
decomposition and Hadamard test to obtain electronic density of states, and we
develop a modified quantum phase estimation algorithm to calculate real-space
local density of states via direct quantum measurements. Furthermore, we
validate these algorithms by numerically computing the density of states and
spatial distributions of electronic states in graphene, twisted bilayer
graphene quasicrystals, and fractal lattices, covering system sizes from
hundreds to thousands of atoms. Our results manifest that the random-state
quantum algorithms provide a general and qubit-efficient route to simulating
electronic properties of large-scale periodic and aperiodic materials on
quantum computers.

We present a comprehensive investigation of the field-dependent critical
current density and pinning force, combined with a detailed analysis of the
nanostructural defect landscape in single crystal of underdoped PrFeAs(O,F)
superconductor. Our study demonstrates that for both in-plane and out-of-plane
magnetic field orientations critical current density exhibits a strong pinning
regime in intermediate fields across the entire temperature range. The dominant
contribution to pinning originates from oxygen-to-fluorine substitutional
defects, oxygen vacancies, which all act as point defects via a quasiparticle
mean free path fluctuation mechanism. Scanning transmission electron microscope
studies did not reveal any volume or surface defect types within the lattice.

- **TL;DR**: 使用工业制造的硅MOS自旋量子比特检测TbPc₂分子系综的电子自旋跃迁，为分子量子存储器与工业量子比特平台的集成奠定基础

Molecular spin qudits offer an attractive platform for quantum memory,
combining long coherence times with rich multi-level spin structures. Terbium
bis(phthalocyaninato) (TbPc$_2$) exemplifies such systems, with demonstrated
quantum control and chemical reproducibility. In hybrid quantum architectures,
TbPc$_2$ can act as the primary memory element, with semiconductor qubits
providing scalable readout and coupling. Here we present a step toward such a
hybrid system: using an industrially manufactured silicon
metal-oxide-semiconductor (SiMOS) spin qubit to detect electronic spin
transitions of an ensemble of TbPc$_2$ molecules. The readout is based on a
compact and robust protocol that applies a microwave pulse while all gate
voltages defining the qubit are held at a fixed operating point. This protocol,
which combines simultaneous Rapid adiabatic Passage and Spin- Selective
tunneling (RPSS), enables high-contrast resonance detection and avoids repeated
$\pi$-pulse recalibration common in decoupling schemes. By demonstrating
ensemble detection, we establish a foundation for integrating molecular quantum
memories with industrial qubit platforms and mark an important step toward
single-molecule hybrid quantum technologies.

### Rotation of crystal seed during early stages of growth reveals the anisotropy of glass matrix

- **TL;DR**: 晶体种子在玻璃基质中早期生长阶段会发生旋转，这与周围非晶基质各向同性的预期相矛盾。研究发现这种旋转源于玻璃-晶体界面的非均匀力场，高温下晶体生长会放大该效应。

Rotation of crystal seed during the early stages of growth in a glass matrix
has been observed due to some torque, contradicting the expectations from the
isotropic, uniform structure of the surrounding amorphous matrix. We establish
an atomistic origin of this new phenomenon from molecular dynamics simulations
using LiNbO3 and LiNbO3-SiO2 glasses as model systems. Effectively, it arises
due to non-uniform forces on the seed from the surrounding glass, which appears
inhomogeneous and anisotropic on the scale of glass-crystal interface. The
seeded crystal growth (SCG) at higher temperatures amplifies this effect due to
enhanced atomic dynamics. Silica, when added to LiNbO3 glass, reduces the
crystal growth rate due to increased viscosity and restricted atomic mobility
across the growth interface, but has minimal effect on the crystal rotation.
These findings challenge a general assumption that glass is an isotropic
material, especially during the early stage of its crystallization, and provide
insights for tailoring the microstructure of widely used glass-ceramics.

### Integrable Model of a Superconductor with non-Fermi liquid and Mott Phases

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一个精确可解的相互作用费米子配对模型，该模型具有在动量k和-k处纠缠态的相互作用，产生了丰富的相图，包括超导、多种金属和莫特绝缘相。

We present and analyze an exactly solvable interacting fermionic pairing
model, which features interactions that entangle states at momenta $\mathbf{k}$
and $-\mathbf{k}$. These interactions give rise to novel correlated ground
states, leading to a rich phase diagram that includes superconducting, multiple
metallic, and Mott-insulating phases. At finite interaction strengths, we
observe the emergence of multiple many-body Fermi surfaces, which violate
Luttinger's theorem and challenge the conventional Landau-Fermi liquid
paradigm. A distinguishing feature of our model is that it remains quantum
integrable, even with the addition of pairing interactions of various
symmetries, setting it apart from the Hatsugai-Kohmoto model. Our results
provide an analytically tractable framework for studying strong correlation
effects that give rise to fractionalized excitations and unconventional
superconductivity, offering valuable insights into a broad class of integrable
many-body systems.

### Approach to zigzag and checkerboard patterns in spatially extended systems

Zigzag patterns in one dimension or checkerboard patterns in two dimensions
occur in a variety of pattern-forming systems. We introduce an order parameter
`phase defect' to identify this transition and help to recognize the associated
universality class on a discrete lattice. In one dimension, if $x_{i}(t)$ is a
variable value at site $i$ at time $t$. We assign spin $s_i(t)=1$ for
$x_{i}(t)&gt;x_{i-1}(t)$, $s_i(t)=-1$ if $x_{i}(t)&lt;x_{i-1}(t)$, and $s_i(t)=0$ if
$x_{i}(t)=x_{i-1}(t)$. The phase defect $D(t)$ is defined as
$D(t)={\frac{\sum_{i=1}^N \vert s_i(t)+s_{i-1}(t)\vert} {2N}}$ for a lattice of
$N$ sites with periodic boundary conditions. It is zero for a zigzag pattern.
In two dimensions, $D(t)$ is the sum of row-wise as well as column-wise phase
defects and is zero for the checkerboard pattern. The persistence $P(t)$ is the
fraction of sites whose spin value did not change even once till time $t$. We
find that $D(t)\sim t^{-\delta}$ and $P(t)\sim t^{-\theta}$ for the parameter
range over which the zigzag or checkerboard pattern is realized. We observe
that $\delta=0.5$ and $\theta=3/8$ for 1-d coupled logistic maps or Gauss maps,
and $\theta=0.22$ and $\delta=0.45$ in 2-d logistic or Gauss maps. The exponent
$\theta$ matches with the persistence exponent at zero temperature for the
Ising model, and $\delta$ matches with the exponent for the Ising model at the
critical temperature. This power-law decay is observed over a range of
parameter values and not just critical point.

### Harvesting chemical power from cyclic environments

Life relies on a sophisticated metabolic molecular machinery that turns over
high-energy molecules to evolve complex macromolecules and assemblies. At the
molecular origin of life, such machinery was absent, implying the need for
simple yet robust physical mechanisms to harvest energy from the environment
and perform chemical work or produce chemical power. However, the mechanisms
involved in harvesting energy from a macroscopic cyclic environment to drive
chemical processes on the molecular scale remain elusive. In this work, we
propose a theory that describes the kinetics of chemical reactions in a system
subject to a cyclic reservoir with varying properties. We compare cycles of
solvent (wet-dry cycles), with cycles of a component participating in a
chemical reaction (reactant cycle). We find that for both wet-dry and reactant
cycles, resonance frequencies exist at which the chemical power is maximal. We
identify which cycle type is more beneficial in harvesting chemical power for
different molecular interactions. Our findings of harvest efficiencies around
ten percent suggest that the cyclic environment could have played a key role in
catalyzing the metabolic molecular machinery at the molecular origin of life.

This paper introduces ChemGen, a software package that uses code generation
to integrate multispecies thermodynamics and chemical kinetics into C+-based
computational physics codes. ChemGen aims to make chemical kinetics more
accessible in existing simulation frameworks and help bridge the gap between
combustion modeling and computational physics. The package employs the concept
of decorators which enable flexible C++ code generation to target established
software ecosystems. ChemGen generates code to evaluate thermodynamic
properties, chemical source terms, and their analytical derivatives for
Jacobian calculations. Also included are a variety of implicit time integration
schemes, linear solvers, and preconditioners. The various components of Chemgen
are verified by demonstrating agreement with Cantera and/or theoretical
convergence rates. Finally, we integrate ChemGen into OpenFOAM and achieve a
speedup over its native chemistry solver by approximately four times. ChemGen

Superconductivity represents a macroscopic quantum state notable for its rich
manifestations of electronic coherence and collective behavior. Kagome
materials AV3Sb5 (A= K, Cs, Rb) possess cascade intertwined quantum phases
including superconductivity, symmetry-breaking charge orders, nematic orders
and topological states, making them attractive materials for exploring exotic
superconducting states. However, the superconducting properties and the Cooper
pairing behaviors have not been fully explored and understood. In this work, by
studying both the magnetoresistance and critical current behaviors in KV3Sb5
ring and pristine flakes, we reveal the charge 2e paring in KV3Sb5 although
anomalous oscillations with smaller periodicity were observed, and report the
intrinsic superconducting phase coherence in KV3Sb5 flakes. The former is
demonstrated by the careful verification of the Little-Parks oscillations in
differential resistance colormaps, and the latter indicates the existence of
superconducting domains in KV3Sb5. Moreover, we observed a special phenomenon:
the transfer of supercurrent interference patterns between the superconducting
ring and the superconducting flake, which demonstrates the global critical
current effect of the superconducting phase coherence. These findings provide
new insights into the Cooper pairing behaviors in KV3Sb5 and highlight the
importance of global effect of superconducting phase coherence in the
understanding of the superconducting behaviors.

### Scaling of Magnetic Domain Walls in Perpendicular Magnetic Anisotropy Systems

Magnetic domain walls play a critical role in the nanoscale evolution of
magnetic devices. Despite the early efforts, a complete understanding of the
micromagnetic evolution of the width and the type of magnetic domain walls has
still remained missing. Here, we report a combined analytical and micromagnetic
simulation study and establish the scaling of the magnetic domains as a
function of the exchange stiffness (A), uniaxial perpendicular magnetic
anisotropy (Ku), saturation magnetization (Ms), and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
interaction (DMI), and shape anisotropy of the magnetic device. We find that
the width of both Bloch and Neel walls scales excellently with the analytical
prediction. The DMI is found to have little influence on the domain wall width
but strongly affect the type of the domain wall. The domain wall has a Bloch
configuration at zero DMI and gradually transitions to Neel configuration upon
increase of the DMI. The shape anisotropy of the magnetic domain wall also
affects the domain wall width. These results have established a comprehensive,
conclusive understanding of the magnetic domain walls within spintronics
devices.

We study thin films of the high-entropy alloy system Al$_{x}$(CrMoW)$_{1-x}$,
grown on Ta seed layers by magnetron co-sputtering. Between $x=0.2$ and
$x=0.6$, a resistivity larger than 100$\mu\Omega$cm is achieved, with a peak of
180$\mu\Omega$cm at $x=0.5$. Around the stoichiometric composition AlCrMoW, the
alloy forms a bcc solid solution. The harmonic Hall method was used to
characterize the spin Hall angle of the alloy series, where a maximum spin Hall
angle of $\theta = -0.12 \pm 0.01$ is observed for $x=0.25$. The implied spin
Hall conductivity is $\sigma_\mathrm{SH} \approx -72\,000 \, \hbar/(2e)$\,S/m.
The experimental results show excellent agreement with density functional
theory calculations, which show similar trends and values. The results
demonstrate that high-entropy alloys with a main-group element component can
form a simple crystal structure and show high resistivity. This suggests that a
whole new class of materials for spin Hall device engineering is available with
simple methods.

diffraction finds q approx. (0.17, 0.5, 0) and a longitudinal sinusoidal
modulation of a-axis moments (amplitude about 0.8 muB) with AFM stacking along
b. A CEF singlet-singlet induced-moment framework accounts for the easy-axis
anisotropy, the small heat-capacity anomaly at TN, the reduced ordered moment,
and the exchange-driven selection of q in this localized 5f vdW magnet,
establishing a constrained exchange geometry stabilizing this in-plane
incommensurate state.

Out-of-equilibrium systems, inherently complex and challenging to understand,
are prevalent across various disciplines, including physics where they arise in
contexts such as fluid dynamics. In particular, critical out-of-equilibrium
systems combine this complexity with the scaling laws and universality classes
observed in critical phenomena, with kinetic surface roughening, the study of
how a flat surface becomes progressively rougher over time, serving as a prime
example. This behavior manifests in a wide variety of contexts, including metal
corrosion, cell proliferation, and, notably, the growth of thin films, which
can emerge as a result of wetting processes. In this thesis, we conduct
extensive numerical simulations to study critical fluctuations and identify
universal features of several rough interfaces, generated by simulating
discrete models of thin film growth and by performing direct numerical
integration of continuum equations. To explore the universal behavior of these
interfaces, we identify the critical exponents that characterize the
spatio-temporal fluctuations of the front. Additionally, we analyze the
dynamics of thin films across different physical scenarios to deepen our
understanding of their behavior in out-of-equilibrium conditions, especially in
the case where these films are formed by the action of an external force such
as Surface Acoustic Waves.

We present an investigation of one-photon valence-shell photoelectron
spectroscopy and photoelectron circular dichroism (PECD) for the chiral
molecule (1R,4R)-3-(heptafluorobutyryl)-(+)-camphor (HFC) and its europium
complex Eu(III) tris[3-(heptafluorobutyryl)-(1R,4R)-camphorate] (Eu-HFC$_{3}$),
the latter of which constitutes the heaviest organometallic molecule for which
PECD has yet been measured. We discuss the role of keto-enol tautomerism in
HFC, both as a free molecule and complexed in Eu-HFC$_{3}$. PECD is a uniquely
sensitive probe of molecular chirality and structure such as absolute
configuration, conformation, isomerisation, and substitution, and as such is in
principle well suited to unambiguously resolving tautomers; however modeling
remains challenging. For small organic molecules, theory is generally capable
of accounting for experimentally measured PECD asymmetries, but significantly
poorer agreement is typically achieved for the case of large open-shell
systems. Here, we report PECD asymmetries ranging up to $\sim8\%$ for HFC and
$\sim7\%$ for Eu-HFC$_{3}$, of similar magnitude to those reported previously
for smaller isolated chiral molecules, indicating that PECD remains a practical
experimental technique for the study of large, complicated chiral systems.

Density functional theory (DFT) remains the most widely used electronic
structure method. Although exact in principle, in practice, it relies on
approximations to the exchange-correlation (XC) functional, which is known to
be a unique functional of the electron density. Despite 50 years of active
research, existing XC approximations remain far from general purpose chemical
accuracy of various thermochemical and materials properties. In that light, the
inverse DFT problem, of finding the exact XC potential corresponding to an
accurate groundstate density, offers an insightful tool to understand the
nature of the XC functional as well as aid in the development of more accurate
functionals. However, solving the inverse DFT problem is fraught with several
numerical challenges, such as non-uniqueness or spurious oscillations in the
solution and non-convergence. We present invDFT as an open-source framework to
address the outstanding challenges in inverse DFT and computed XC potentials
solely from a target density. We do so by use of a systematically convergent
finite-element basis and asymptotic corrections to the target density. We also
employ several numerical and high-performance computing (HPC) advances that
affords both efficiency and parallel scalability, on CPU-GPU hybrid
architectures. We demonstrate the accuracy and scalability of invDFT using
accurate full-configuration interaction (FCI) densities as well as model
densities, ranging up to 100 electrons and spanning both weakly and strongly
correlated molecules.

The discovery of superconductivity in $\mathrm{YH_{9}}$ with a critical
temperature of approximately $T_c\sim 243 \ K$ has opened a new window toward
room temperature superconductivity. In this work, we employ the lowest order
constrained variational method to investigate the thermodynamic and magnetic
properties of the $\mathrm{YH_{9}}$ structure, obtaining results in good
agreement with experimental data. % Based on the robustness of the LOCV
approach for describing high-$T_c$ superconductors, we further extend our

Unidirectional magnetoresistance (UMR) in metallic bilayers arises from
nonlinear spin-charge transport mediated by broken time-reversal and inversion
symmetries, yet the role of magnons remains unsettled. We develop a theoretical
framework that incorporates coupled electron-magnon dynamics, revealing cross
diffusion and spin-angular-momentum transfer between the two subsystems, which
renormalize the characteristic electron and magnon spin-diffusion lengths. We
show that nonequilibrium magnons, indirectly excited by the electric field, can
suppress UMR by absorbing spin angular momentum from conduction electrons. We
also analyze the magnetic-field, thickness, and temperature dependencies and
identify distinct features that constitute experimental fingerprints of
magnonic contributions to UMR in metallic bilayers, providing qualitative to
semiquantitative guidance for elucidating the underlying physical mechanisms.

- **TL;DR**: 本文构建了一个Janus过渡金属二硫化物（TMDs）的计算"拉曼数字孪生"库，通过第一性原理计算预测了多种Janus TMDs的拉曼指纹，为实验表征提供基准。

Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are a key class of
two-dimensional (2D) materials with broad technological potential. Their Janus
counterparts exhibit unique properties due to broken out-of-plane symmetry and
further enrich the functionalities of TMDs. However, experimental synthesis and
identification of Janus TMDs remain challenging. It is thus highly desirable to
have a rapid, simple, and in situ characterization technique to monitor, in
real time, the conversion process from the parent to Janus structure. Raman
spectroscopy stands out for such a task as it is a powerful, non-destructive,
and very commonly used tool to characterize 2D materials both in situ and ex
situ. To realize the full potential of Raman spectroscopy on rapid
characterization of Janus TMDs, we present a computational "Raman digital twin"
library for various monolayer Janus TMDs in both 2H and Td phases. We focus on
group-6 TMDs: MoS$_2$, WS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, WSe$_2$, MoTe$_2$, WTe$_2$ and their
Janus variants: MoSSe, MoSTe, MoSeTe, WSSe, WSTe, and WSeTe. Using
first-principles density functional theory (DFT), we calculate their
vibrational properties and predict distinct Raman fingerprints. These phonon
and Raman signatures reflect each material's structural symmetry and atomic
composition, enabling clear identification via Raman spectroscopy. Our
theoretical work supports experimental efforts by providing benchmarks for
material identification, structural analysis, and quality control. The
computational library expedites the discovery and development of Janus 2D
materials, facilitating tighter integration between theoretical predictions and
experimental validation.

### Spinon band flattening by its emergent gauge field in quantum kagome ice

Fractional excitations provide a key to identifying sought-after topological
quantum spin liquid states in realistic materials. Their single-particle
dynamics already presents a challenging many-body problem on account of the
coupling to their emergent gauge field. Here, we study the spinon excitations
of kagome ice, realized at the $2/3$ magnetization plateau of spin ice, by
combining up-to-$63$-site exact diagonalization with an analytical state graph
mapping. We find a macroscopically degenerate mode in the spinon spectrum. It
originates from the destructive interference due to the interaction with
surrounding gauge fields, a form of many-body caging. We explicitly construct,
and count, the concomitant many-body wave functions. Finally, we discuss the
possible role of these flat modes in the magnetization process of kagome
antiferromagnets, in particular with regard to the asymmetric termination of
the kagome ice magnetisation plateau.

### Nonanaliticities and ergodicity breaking in noninteracting many-body dynamics via stochastic resetting and global measurements

- **TL;DR**: 该论文研究了在非相互作用自旋系统中，通过基于磁化测量结果的条件重置协议，可以产生类似相变的集体行为。系统表现出多个非解析点，半整数自旋呈现一阶相变，整数自旋则显示多临界行为。这种非线性行为源于测量诱导的相关性而非相互作用。

Stochastic resetting generates nonequilibrium steady states by interspersing
unitary quantum dynamics with resets at random times. When the state to which
the system is reset is chosen conditionally on the outcome of a global and
spatially resolved measurement, the steady state can feature collective
behavior similar to what is typically observed at phase transitions. Here we
investigate such conditional reset protocol in a system of noninteracting
spins, where the reset state is chosen as a magnetization eigenstate, that is
selected (conditioned) on the outcome of a previous magnetization measurement.
The stationary states that emerge from this protocol are characterized by the
density of spins in a given magnetization eigenstate, which is the analogue of
the order parameter. The resulting stationary phase diagram features multiple
nonanalytic points. They are of first-order type for half-integer spin, while
multicritical behavior, signalled by both first and second-order
discontinuities, is found for integer spin. We also show that the associated
dynamics is nonergodic, i.e., which stationary state the system ultimately
assumes is determined be the initial state. Interestingly, the mechanism
underlying these phenomena does not rely on interactions, but the emergent
nonlinear behavior is solely a consequence of correlations induced by the
measurement.

### Enhanced Sampling for Efficient Learning of Coarse-Grained Machine Learning Potentials

- **TL;DR**: 本文提出使用增强采样方法改进粗粒化机器学习势函数的训练，通过沿粗粒化自由度进行偏置采样，然后重新计算无偏势的力，从而缩短平衡时间并丰富过渡区域采样。

Coarse-graining (CG) enables molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of larger
systems and longer timescales that are otherwise infeasible with atomistic
models. Machine learning potentials (MLPs), with their capacity to capture
many-body interactions, can provide accurate approximations of the potential of
mean force (PMF) in CG models. Current CG MLPs are typically trained in a
bottom-up manner via force matching, which in practice relies on configurations
sampled from the unbiased equilibrium Boltzmann distribution to ensure
thermodynamic consistency. This convention poses two key limitations: first,
sufficiently long atomistic trajectories are needed to reach convergence; and
second, even once equilibrated, transition regions remain poorly sampled. To
address these issues, we employ enhanced sampling to bias along CG degrees of
freedom for data generation, and then recompute the forces with respect to the
unbiased potential. This strategy simultaneously shortens the simulation time
required to produce equilibrated data and enriches sampling in transition
regions, while preserving the correct PMF. We demonstrate its effectiveness on
the M\"uller-Brown potential and capped alanine, achieving notable
improvements. Our findings support the use of enhanced sampling for force
matching as a promising direction to improve the accuracy and reliability of CG
MLPs.

Orbitronics, which leverages the angular momentum of atomic orbitals for
information transmission, provides a novel strategy to overcome the limitations
of electronic devices. Unlike electron spin, orbital angular momentum (OAM) is
strongly influenced by crystal field effects and band topology, making its
orientation difficult to manipulate with external fields. In this work, by
using first principle calculations, we investigate quantum anomalous Hall
insulators (QAHIs) as a model system to study the layer orbital Hall effect
(OHE). Due to band inversion, only one valley remains orbital polarization, and
thus the OHE originates from a single valley. Based on stacking symmetry
analysis, we investigated both AA and AB stacking configurations, which possess
mirror and inversion symmetries, respectively. The excitation of OAM exhibits
valley selectivity, determined jointly by valley polarization and orbital
polarization. In AA stacking, the absence of inversion center gives rise to
intrinsic orbital polarization, leading to OAM excitations from different
valleys in the two layers. In contrast, AB stacking is protected by inversion
symmetry, which enforces valley polarization and

Spin-polarized superconductors offer a rare platform for studying electronic
correlations, but few candidate systems have been experimentally confirmed to
date. Here, we report the observation of a spin-polarized superconducting
state, denoted SC5, in WSe2-proximitized rhombohedral trilayer graphene. At
in-plane magnetic field B|| = 0 T, SC5 has a critical temperature of 68 mK and
an out-of-plane critical magnetic field of only 12 mT. Surprisingly, these
values are significantly enhanced as B|| increases, and the superconductivity
persists to B|| = 8.8 T. This value corresponds to a record-high Pauli-limit
violation ratio of at least 80 among all superconductors, while the true
critical field is beyond the limit of our instrument. We conclude that SC5
experiences a canting crossover from Ising-type to spin-polarized
superconductor with increased B||.

Quantum heat transport by electrons in ballistic channels is usually
well-described in the Landauer-B\"uttiker framework, which fails when
introducing strong Coulomb interactions. We theoretically show that a chain of
small metallic dots where charge cannot accumulate, connected by chiral
ballistic channels, conducts heat better than charge. We relate this feature to
the competition between heat diffusion by neutral excitations and Coulomb
interactions in the chain, which defines a temperature gradient over a finite
characteristic length. We show that the Lorenz ratio can be arbitrarily large,
scaling as the square root of the chain's length, which suggests new approaches
for heat manipulation in mesoscopic systems.

This work demonstrates the effectiveness of fine-tuning the CHGNet universal
machine learning interatomic potential (uMLIP) to investigate ionic transport
mechanisms in ternary halide solid electrolytes of the
Li$_{3}$YCl$_{6-x}$Br$_{x}$ family (x = 0 to 6), which are promising candidates
for solid-state battery applications. We present a strategy for generating
ordered structural models from experimentally derived disordered
Li$_{3}$YCl$_{6}$ (LYC) and Li$_{3}$YBr$_{6}$ (LYB) structures. These serve as
initial configurations for an iterative fine-tuning workflow that couples
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with static density functional theory (DFT)
calculations. The fine-tuning process and the resulting improvements in
predictive accuracy are benchmarked across energy predictions, structure
optimizations, and diffusion coefficient calculations. Finally, we analyze the
influence of composition (varied x) on the predicted ionic conductivity in
Li$_{3}$YCl$_{6-x}$Br$_{x}$, demonstrating the robustness of our approach for
modeling transport properties in complex solid electrolytes.

### A minimal and universal representation of fermionic wavefunctions (fermions = bosons + one)

Representing fermionic wavefunctions efficiently is a central problem in
quantum physics, chemistry and materials science. In this work, we introduce a
universal and exact representation of continuous antisymmetric functions by
lifting them to continuous symmetric functions defined on an enlarged space.
Building on this lifting, we obtain a \emph{parity-graded representation} of
fermionic wavefunctions, expressed in terms of symmetric feature variables that
encode particle configuration and antisymmetric feature variables that encode
exchange statistics. This representation is both exact and minimal: the number
of required features scales as $D\sim N^d$ ($d$ is spatial dimension) or $D\sim
N$ depending on the symmetric feature maps employed. Our results provide a
rigorous mathematical foundation for efficient representations of fermionic
wavefunctions and enable scalable and systematically improvable neural network
solvers for many-electron systems.

### Flux confinement-deconfinement transition of dimer-loop models on three-dimensional bipartite lattices

Motivated by recent work that mapped the low-temperature properties of a
class of frustrated spin $S=1$ kagome antiferromagnets with competing exchange
and single-ion anisotropies to the fully-packed limit (with each vertex touched
by exactly one dimer or nontrivial loop) of a system of dimers and nontrivial
(length $s &gt; 2$) loops on the honeycomb lattice, we study this fully-packed
dimer-loop model on the three-dimensional bipartite cubic and diamond lattices
as a function of $w$, the relative fugacity of dimers. We find that the $w
\rightarrow 0$ O($1$) loop-model limit is separated from the $w \rightarrow
\infty$ dimer limit by a geometric phase transition at a nonzero finite
critical fugacity $w_c$: The $w&gt;w_c$ phase has short loops with an
exponentially decaying loop-size distribution, while the $w&lt;w_c$ phase is
dominated by large loops whose loop-size distribution is governed by universal
properties of the critical O($1$) loop soup. This transition separates two {\em
distinct} Coulomb liquid phases of the system: Both phases admit a description
in terms of a fluctuating divergence-free polarization field
$P_{\mu}(\mathbf{r})$ on links of the lattice and are characterized by dipolar
correlations at long distances. The transition at $w_c$ is a flux
confinement-deconfinement transition. Equivalently, and independent of boundary
conditions, half-integer test charges $q=\pm 1/2$ are confined for $w&gt;w_c$, but
become deconfined in the small-$w$ phase. Although both phases are unstable to
a nonzero fugacity for the charge $\pm 1/2$ excitations, the destruction of the
$w &gt;w_c$ Coulomb liquid is characterized by an interesting slow crossover,
since test charges with $q=\pm 1/2$ are confined in this phase.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一个缩减尺度的辅助场量子蒙特卡洛框架，用于处理大型分子系统和系综，通过混合块稀疏和THC压缩技术将交换能评估的计算复杂度从四次方降低到三次方。

We present a reduced-scaling auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC)
framework designed for large molecular systems and ensembles, with or without
coupling to optical cavities. Our approach leverages the natural block sparsity
of Cholesky decomposition (CD) of electron repulsion integrals in molecular
ensembles and employs tensor hypercontraction (THC) to efficiently compress
low-rank Cholesky blocks. By representing the Cholesky vectors in a mixed
format, keeping high-rank blocks in block-sparse form and compressing low-rank
blocks with THC, we reduce the scaling of exchange-energy evaluation from
quartic to robust cubic in the number of molecular orbitals, while lowering
memory from cubic toward quadratic. Benchmark analyses on one-, two-, and
three-dimensional molecular ensembles (up to ~1,200 orbitals) show that: a) the
number of nonzeros in Cholesky tensors grows linearly with system size across
dimensions; b) the average numerical rank increases sublinearly and does not
saturate at these sizes; and (c) rank heterogeneity-some blocks nearly full
rank and many low rank, naturally motivating the proposed mixed block sparsity
and THC scheme for efficient calculation of exchange energy. We demonstrate
that the mixed scheme yields cubic CPU-time scaling with favorable prefactors
and preserves AFQMC accuracy.

### Computational Crystal Plasticity Homogenization using Empirically Corrected Cluster Cubature (E3C) Hyper-Reduction

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种用于弹塑性多晶计算均匀化的超降阶方法(E3C)，通过识别替代应变模式的E3C模式，显著减少积分点数量，在标准笔记本电脑上实现大规模两尺度模拟。

The computational homogenization of elastoplastic polycrystals is a
challenging task due to the huge number of grains required, their complicated
interactions and due to the complexity of crystal plasticity models per se.
Despite a few successes of reduced order models, mean field and simplified
homogenization approaches often remain the preferred choice. In this work, a
recently proposed hyper-reduction method (called E3C) for projection-based
Reduced Order Models (pROMs) is applied to the problem of computational
homogenization of geometrically linearly deforming elastoplastic polycrystals.
The main novelty lies in the identification of reduced modes (the 'E3C-modes'),
which replace the strain modes of the reduced-order model, leading to a
significantly smaller number of integration points. The peculiarity, which
distinguishes the method from more conventional hyper-reduction techniques, is
that the E3C integration points are not taken from the set of FE integration
points. Instead, they can be interpreted as generalized integration points in
strain space which are trained such as to satisfy an orthogonality condition,
which ensures that the hyper-reduced model matches the equilibrium states and
macroscopic stresses of full-field model data as accurately as possible. In
addition, the number of grains is reduced, preserving the main features of the
original texture of the finite element model. Two macroscopic engineering parts
(untextured and textured) are simulated, illustrating the performance of the
method in three-dimensional two-scale applications involving hundreds of
thousands macroscopic degrees of freedom and millions of grains with computing
times in the order of hours (cumulated online and offline effort) on standard
laptop hardware.

Understanding the interplay between superconductivity and the pseudogap phase
is essential for elucidating the mechanism of high-temperature
superconductivity in cuprates. Here we provide direct spatial evidence that
these two states are locally and intrinsically correlated. Using spatially and
temporally resolved measurements of photoinduced quasiparticle dynamics in
optimally doped Bi$_2$Sr$_{1.7}$La$_{0.3}$CuO$_{6+\delta}$ (La-Bi2201), we
reveal micrometer-scale spatial contrasts in the transient reflectivity that
arise from local variations in the threshold fluence required to disrupt either
the superconducting or pseudogap state. The superconducting response remains
spatially uniform, whereas the pseudogap exhibits intrinsic inhomogeneity, yet
the spatial variations of their threshold fluences closely track each other,
establishing a robust local correlation between the two. These results
introduce a bulk-sensitive ultrafast optical methodology for visualizing hidden
spatial correlations in correlated materials and provide new benchmarks for
understanding the intertwined phases in cuprates.

Solid-state nanopore and nanopipette sensors are powerful devices for the
detection, quantification and structural analysis of biopolymers such as DNA
and proteins, especially in carrier-enhanced resistive-pulse sensing. However,
hundreds of different molecules typically need to be sampled from solution and
analysed to obtain statistically robust information. This limits the
applicability of such sensors and complicates associated workflows. Here, we
present a new strategy to trap DNA structures in the sensing region of a
nanopipette through end functionalisation and nanoparticle capping. We develop
a robust set of descriptors to characterise the insertion and presence of
nanoparticle-DNA constructs in the nanopipette tip and, furthermore, show that
they remain mobile and responsive to external electric fields over extended
periods of time. This allows for repeated readout of the same DNA structure and
could enable new applications for such sensors, for example in flow and in
confined environments.

Amorphous solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) hold great promise for advancing
the application of all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs), owing to their favorable
ionic conductivity, structural tunability, and promising electrochemical
performance. However, the absence of universal design principles for amorphous
SSEs limits their development. By fundamentally re-evaluating the
amorphization-forming ability of amorphous SSE systems, this study establishes
a nitrogen-driven universal strategy to convert diverse metal chlorides into
amorphous xLi3N-MCly (0.3 &lt; 3x &lt; 1.9; M denotes a metal element; 2 &lt; y &lt; 5)
SSE. Nitrogen synergistically disrupts crystalline order via distorted
coordination polyhedra and N-bridged networks, while dynamic bond
reorganization enables rapid Li+ migration, achieving ionic conductivity of
2.02 mS cm-1 for 0.533Li3N-HfCl4 at 25 {\deg}C. Structural-property
relationships reveal that high charge density and bridging capability of N3-
enhance network disorder, shorten metal coordinating atom distances, and
optimize Li+ diffusion pathway connectivity. ASSBs employing 0.533Li3N-HfCl4
retain 81.87% capacity after 2000 cycles at 1000 mA g-1 with high cathode
loading (6.24 mg cm-2), demonstrating engineering viability. This work provides
a paradigm for rational design of high-performance amorphous SSEs.

solving its long-time dynamics still remains a great numerical challenge. An
emergent and rapidly developing numerical strategy to solve the AIM is to
represent the Feynman-Vernon influence functional (IF), which encodes all the
bath effects on the impurity dynamics, as a matrix product state (MPS) in the
temporal domain. The computational cost of this strategy is basically
determined by the bond dimension $\chi$ of the temporal MPS. In this work, we
propose an efficient and accurate method which, when the hybridization function
in the IF can be approximated as the summation of $n$ exponential functions,
can systematically build the IF as a MPS by multiplying $O(n)$ small MPSs, each
with bond dimension $2$. Our method gives a worst case scaling of $\chi$ as
$2^{8n}$ and $2^{2n}$ for real- and imaginary-time evolution respectively. We
demonstrate the performance of our method for two commonly used bath spectral
functions, where we show that the actually required $\chi$s are much smaller
than the worst case.

Flat histogram methods, such as Wang-Landau sampling, provide a means for
high throughput calculation of phase diagrams of atomistic/lattice model
systems. Many parallelisation schemes with varying degrees of complexity have
been proposed to accelerate such sampling simulations. In this study, several
widely used schemes are benchmarked - both in isolation and in combination - to
establish best practice. The schemes studied include energy domain
decomposition with both static sizing of energy sub-domains, as well as a
dynamic sub-domain sizing scheme which we propose. We also assess the benefits
both of replica exchange and of including multiple random walkers per
sub-domain, to determine which factors have the largest impact on parallel
efficiency. Additionally, the influence of the choice of size of energy
sub-domain overlap regions is discussed. As an illustrative test case, we
implement and apply the aforementioned strategies to a lattice-based model
describing the internal energies of the AlTiCrMo refractory high-entropy
superalloy, which is understood to crystallographically order into a B2 (CsCl)
structure with decreasing temperature. We find that - while all of the proposed
strategies confer a non-negligible speedup - parallelisation across energy
domains which are non-uniform in size offers the most appreciable performance
improvements. This work offers concrete recommendations for which
parallelisation strategies should be prioritised to optimally accelerate
flat-histogram Monte Carlo simulations.

- **TL;DR**: 本文研究了Condon近似在电子转移和三重态能量转移中的适用性，发现三重态能量转移比电子转移对非Condon波动更敏感，Condon近似在三重态能量转移中适用性较差。

We investigate the applicability of the Condon approximation (i.e. the notion
that the diabatic coupling is invariant to geometry) in the context of both
electron transfer (ET) and triplet energy transfer (TET) and compare the two
cases. Although it is well appreciated that diabatic couplings usually arise
from the interactions of electronic wavefunction tails, we show that ET tails
are very different from TET tails. Using a simple model problem, our analysis
explains in detail why the rates of TET decays with twice the rate of ET, while
also leading to the hypothesis that the smaller diabatic couplings found for
TET (versus ET) should imply more sensitivity to non-Condon fluctuations. As an
example, for the classic sets of molecules investigated by Closs, we show that
the Condon approximation is indeed less applicable for TET than for ET.

The pair-density-wave (PDW) exhibits periodic amplitude and sign modulations
of the superconducting order parameter. Such a pairing state has been proposed
to be sensitive to nonmagnetic scattering. In this work, we observe the
nonmagnetic PDW-breaking effect in a kagome superconductor, using scanning
tunneling microscopy. We observe 2x2 PDW induced by the coupling between charge
order and superconductivity. The global PDW is substantially suppressed upon
doping the kagome lattice with dilute isovalent nonmagnetic impurities, whereas
the charge order and uniform superconductivity remain robust. Spatial
correlation analysis further confirms that PDW is distinctly suppressed near
dopants. We attribute the PDW suppression to a nonmagnetic PDW breaking effect,
arising from phase sign modulation of PDW in the kagome d-orbital hosting
Bogoliubov Fermi states.

### Time domain braiding of anyons revealed through a nonequilibrium fluctuation dissipation theorem

- **TL;DR**: 本文推导了适用于非平衡初始状态的涨落-耗散定理，提出了两种在时间域中确定任意子编织相的方法，为在单量子点接触装置中提取统计角θ或标度维度δ提供了实验可行的方案。

We derive a novel fluctuation--dissipation theorem (FDT) valid for
nonequilibrium initial states that imprint the braiding of anyons in the time
domain. The derivation is carried out within the Unifying Nonequilibrium
Perturbative Theory (UNEPT), which applies to both standard reservoir
geometries and configurations with one or two quantum point contacts (QPCs)
injecting dilute anyonic fluxes. Based on this FDT, we propose complementary
methods to determine the time-domain braiding phase. The first method relates
the DC backscattering noise to the integral of the current with respect to DC
drives, while the second connects the AC current phase shift to the DC noise.
The latter provides a particularly robust probe of the statistical angle
$\theta$, offering an intrinsic calibration and cancelling certain nonuniversal
renormalization effects. Specializing to a thermalized Tomonaga--Luttinger
liquid (TLL), we further show that in the quantum regime the phase shift
enables a direct determination of the scaling dimension $\delta$ when $\delta &gt;
1/2$. These results define experimentally accessible schemes to extract either
$\theta$ or $\delta$ in minimal single-QPC setups, without relying on
interferometry or cross-correlation measurements.

### Relationship among Structural, Disordered, Magnetism and Band Topology in MnSb2Te4(Sb2Te3)n Family

Interplay between topology and magnetism induces various exotic quantum
phenomena, with magnetic topological insulators (MTIs) serving as a prominent
example due to their ability to host the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE).
However, the realization of QAHE at higher temperature approaching
magnetic-transition-temperature remains a significant challenge, primarily due
to the scarcity of suitable material platforms and limited understanding of the
intricate relationships between band topology, magnetism, and defects. Here, we
report a comprehensive investigation of MnSb2Te4(Sb2Te3)n (n = 0 - 5) single
crystals, including the discovery of novel MnSb8Te13 pure phase. Experimental
measurements confirm that MnSb8Te13 exhibits ferromagnetism and features
topologically nontrivial electronic structures, characterized by a Dirac point
located further from the conduction band and a possible larger bulk gap
compared to MnBi2Te4(Bi2Te3)n (n = 0 - 3). Moreover, we systematically analyze
the relationship between structure, magnetism, topology, and disorder within
Mn(Sb, Bi)2Te4((Sb, Bi)2Te3)n family. Present work will shed light on the
exploration of potential platforms capable of achieving QAHE near magnetic
transition temperature, offering new directions for advancing topological
quantum materials.

- **TL;DR**: 通过NMR技术在铜苯甲酸盐单晶中识别了三种不同的量子激发：自旋子、随机单重态和孤子，展示了该材料作为研究一维量子可积性和无序-关联相互作用平台的独特性。

The $S=1/2$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain is a paradigmatic quantum
system hosting exotic excitations such as spinons and solitons, and forming
random singlet state in the presence of quenched disorder. Realizing and
distinguishing these excitations in a single material remains a significant
challenge. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) on a high-quality single
crystal of copper benzoate, we identify and characterize all three excitation
types by tuning the magnetic field at ultra-low temperatures. At a low field of
0.2 T, a temperature-independent spin-lattice relaxation rate ($1/T_1$) over
more than a decade confirms the presence of spinons. Below 0.4 K, an additional
relaxation channel emerges, characterized by $1/T_1 \propto T$ and a spectral
weight growing as $-\ln(T/T_0)$, signaling a random-singlet ground state
induced by weak quenched disorder. At fields above 0.5 T, a field-induced spin
gap $\Delta \propto H^{2/3}$ observed in both $1/T_1$ and the Knight shift
signifies soliton excitations. Our results establish copper benzoate as a
unique experimental platform for studying one-dimensional quantum integrability
and the interplay of disorder and correlations.

### Ambient-Stable Transfer-Free Graphdiyne Wafers with Superhigh Hole Mobility at Room Temperature

Graphdiyne (GDY) is recognized as a compelling candidate for the fabrication
of next-generation high-speed low-energy electronic devices due to its inherent
p-type semiconductor characteristics. However, the development of GDY for
applications in field-effect transistors (FETs), complementary
metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS), and logic devices remains constrained by the
relatively low carrier mobility reported in current experimental studies.
Herein, the synthesis of layer-controlled hydrogen-substituted graphdiyne
(HsGDY) films directly on silicon substrates under a supercritical CO2
atmosphere is reported, along with the fabrication of these films into
HsGDY-based FETs. The transfer-free growth strategy eliminates performance
degradation caused by post-synthesis transfer processes. The resulting HsGDY
FETs exhibit a remarkable hole mobility of up to 3800 cm2 V-1 s-1 at
room-temperature, which is an order of magnitude higher than that of most
p-type semiconductors. The synthesis of transfer-free HsGDY wafers provides a
new strategy for resolving the carrier mobility mismatch between p-channel and
n-channel two-dimensional metal-oxide-semiconductor devices.

The structures of the superconducting spin valve (SSV) Fe/\allowbreak
Si$_3$N$_4$/\allowbreak Pb/\allowbreak Si$_3$N$_4$/\allowbreak Fe (where
Si$_3$N$_4$ is a dielectric insulating layer of controlled thickness) were
investigated. The dependence of the magnitude of the SSV effect on the
thicknesses of the superconducting (S) and insulating (I) layers was studied.
Optimization of the S and I layer thicknesses enabled a complete switching
between the normal and superconducting states when the mutual orientation of
the magnetizations of the ferromagnetic (F) layers changed from antiparallel to
parallel. A maximal SSV effect value of 0.36\,K was achieved in an external
magnetic field of 1\,kOe. These results demonstrate that SSV structures with
tunable S/F interface transparency controlled by insulating interlayers are
promising for achieving a significant magnitude of the effect. This opens new
avenues for the development of such systems and their potential applications in
spintronic devices.

We investigate the effective couplings induced between localized impurities
on the surface of a Weyl semimetal (WSM) nanowire within the framework of
Ruderman--Kittel--Kasuya--Yosida (RKKY) theory. The itinerant electrons from
the chiral Fermi arc surface states mediate impurity-impurity interaction at
low energies. As a result, the spin-momentum locking naturally plays a central
role in shaping the spin-spin correlations. We show that the dominant
interaction channels have distinct origins: while the azimuthal coupling,
$J_{\phi\phi}$ term arises exclusively from Fermi arc states with identical
spin polarization, the couplings $J_{\mu\nu}$ ($\mu,\nu = z,r$) are governed by
Fermi arc states with opposite spin polarizations. Furthermore, we demonstrate
that purely surface-mediated contributions exhibit different scaling behavior
compared to those involving Fermi arcs and low-energy bulk states. We
systematically untangle the contributions from bulk and surface states to the
RKKY couplings, using analytical and numerical methods. Our results establish
WSM nanowires as a versatile platform for engineering and simulating a broad
class of spin models.

### Spinon Mediation of Witness-Spin Dynamics and Ground State in Herbertsmithite

- **TL;DR**: 该论文通过将herbertsmithite中的铜杂质原子重新概念化为量子'见证自旋'，利用自旋噪声光谱研究量子自旋液体状态，发现在T*≈260 mK处存在尖锐相变，支持Z2规范对称量子自旋液体理论。

The kagome lattice of spin-1/2 Cu atoms in herbertsmithite (ZnCu3(OH)6Cl2)
may sustain a quantum spin liquid (QSL) state with spinon quasiparticles. Each
kagome plane is separated from its homologues by a layer of spinless Zn atoms.
Providentially, however, some spin-1/2 Cu atoms substitute randomly onto these
inter-kagome Zn sites. We reconceptualize these 'impurity' atoms as quantum
'witness-spins', an exceptional new interrogative of the conjectured
Z2-gauge-symmetric QSL state. Thus we introduce spin-noise spectroscopy to
explore herbertsmithite witness-spin dynamics for QSL studies. It reveals the
existence, slowing and intensification of spin noise, prefatory to a sharp
transition at T* {\approx} 260 mK. Below T* the spin-noise power spectral
density S_M({\omega},T) {\propto} {\omega}^{-{\alpha}(T)} stabilizes at
{\alpha} {\approx} 1; the spin noise variance {\sigma}_M^2(T) diminishes
precipitously; the ultra-low-field magnetic susceptibility {\chi}(T) undergoes
a sharp transition into a phase exhibiting an Edwards-Anderson order-parameter
and ultra-slow spin-state relaxation. A Z2 QSL theory of spinon-mediated
witness-spin interactions corresponds best to all these experimental
observations, predicting slowing and intensification of witness-spin
fluctuations and noise spectrum S_M({\omega},T) with cooling, with a transition
into a unique spinon-mediated phase signified by rapidly diminishing spin
noise, with S_M({\omega},T) {\propto} {\omega}^{-1}, a sharp cusp in the DC
magnetic susceptibility {\chi}(T), and the appearance of an Edwards-Anderson
order-parameter. We rule out numerous other mechanisms for these effects, so
that only spinon-mediation by either a Z2 or U(1) QSL is consistent with all
present herbertsmithite empirics, with the former model providing a closer
match to data.

### Atomic-Scale Origins of Oxidation Resistance in Amorphous Boron Nitride

Amorphous boron nitride (\textrm{$\alpha$}-BN) is a promising ultrathin
barrier for nanoelectronics, yet the atomistic mechanisms governing its
chemical stability remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate the
structure-property relationship that dictates the oxidation of
\textrm{$\alpha$}-BN using a combination of machine-learning molecular dynamics
simulations and angle-resolved X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The
simulations reveal that the film structure, controlled by synthesis conditions,
is the critical factor determining oxidation resistance. Dense, chemically
ordered networks with a high fraction of B-N bonds effectively resist oxidation
by confining it to the surface, whereas porous, defect-rich structures with
abundant homonuclear B-B and N-N bonds permit oxygen penetration and undergo
extensive bulk degradation. These computational findings are consistent with
experimental trends observed in \textrm{$\alpha$}-BN films grown by chemical
vapour deposition. XPS analysis shows that a film grown at a higher temperature
develops a more ordered structure with a B/N ratio nearer to stoichiometric and
exhibits superior resistance to surface oxidation compared to its more
defective, lower-temperature counterpart. Together, these results demonstrate
that the oxidation resistance of \textrm{$\alpha$}-BN is a tunable property
directly linked to its atomic-scale morphology, providing a clear framework for
engineering chemically robust dielectric barriers for future nanoelectronic
applications.

### Nonequilibrium spin-splitter effect in altermagnet superconductor hybrids

We study the nonequilibrium spin-splitter effect in superconducting
altermagnets and superconductor altermagnet hybrids by computing the
alternating spin current and edge the spin density in the presence of an
alternating electric field. We show that while in the normal state the effect
is not sensitive to the field frequency, in the superconducting state, there is
a strong effect for frequencies on the scale of $\Delta_0$ or lower. We
contrast the effect to the spin accumulation induced by the spin-Hall effect,
by showing that for the altermagnet spin-splitter effect the out-of-phase spin
density does not diverge in the adiabatic limit. This difference is attributed
to the absence of any equilibrium spin-splitter effect in altermagnets. In
fact, the out-of-phase component vanishes below the gap excitation frequency
$2\Delta_0$, because below this frequency the absence of dissipation and the
behavior of the system under time-reversal directly determine the relative
phase between the charge current, spin current, and spin accumulation. The
nonequilibrium effect can be tuned by external parameters like temperature. In
fact, it has a nonmonotonic temperature dependence, taking its largest value
for temperatures around $0.8T_{c}$. The value at this temperature can be
significantly larger than the normal state spin density or the low temperature
spin density. Thus, besides using the nonequilibrium spin-splitter effect to
identify altermagnets, its tunability makes it also suitable for applications.

- **TL;DR**: Chebyshev展开方法可扩展到非厄米系统，通过控制谱半径和时间步长有效抑制数值舍入误差，实现精确的时间演化计算。

The Chebyshev expansion method is a well-established technique for computing
the time evolution of quantum states, particularly in Hermitian systems with a
bounded spectrum. Here, we show that the applicability of the Chebyshev
expansion method extends well beyond this constraint: It remains valid across
the entire complex plane and is thus suitable for arbitrary non-Hermitian
matrices. We identify that numerical rounding errors are the primary source of
errors encountered when applying the method outside the conventional spectral
bounds, and they are not caused by fundamental limitations. By carefully
selecting the spectral radius and the time step, we show how these errors can
be effectively suppressed, enabling accurate time evolution calculations in
non-Hermitian systems. We derive an analytic upper bound for the rounding
error, which serves as a practical guideline for selecting time steps in
numerical simulations. As an application, we illustrate the performance of the
method by computing the time evolution of wave packets in the Hatano-Nelson
model.

The magnetic correlations in double perovskites La2Mn2-xNixO6 (x = 0.5, 0.75,
1.0, 1.25 and 1.5) have been systematically investigated across macroscopic,
mesoscopic, and microscopic length scales using temperature-dependent bulk DC
magnetization, neutron depolarization, and neutron powder diffraction
measurements, respectivitly. The magnetic properties evolve from a long-range
ferromagnetic (FM) order to a cluster ferromagnetic or spin-glass (FM or SG)
behavior as the Ni concentration increases. This evolution is directly linked
to changes in the crystal structure, transitioning from pure orthorhombic
(x=0.5) to mixed orthorhombic and monoclinic (x=0.75-1.0), and eventually to
mixed trigonal and monoclinic symmetries (x=1.25-1.5). Ni substitution enhances
the magnetic ordering temperature from 170 K (x=0.5) to 280 K (x=1.0), but this
is accompanied by a reduction in both magnetization and ordered magnetic
moment. Beyond x=1.0, any long-range magnetic ordering is absent. Additionally,
all compositions exhibit a reentrant spin-glass-like phase at low temperatures
(below about 50 K). Neutron diffraction analysis confirms that long-range FM
order occurs only in the orthorhombic phase, while the monoclinic and trigonal
phases lack such magnetic ordering. The temperature-dependent magnetic
correlations are closely connected to variations in crystal structural
parameters, including lattice constants and unit cell volume. The electrical
conductivity behavior, following the variable range hopping (VRH) model,
highlights the role of multivalence Mn and Ni ions on the electrical
properties. This study elucidates the microscopic mechanisms behind the tunable
magnetic and electrical properties of La2Mn2-xNixO6, offering valuable insights
for the design of advanced materials for spintronic applications.

Accurate simulations of the Hubbard model are crucial to understanding
strongly correlated phenomena, where small energy differences between competing
orders demand high numerical precision. In this work, Neural Quantum States are
used to probe the strongly coupled and underdoped regime of the square-lattice
Hubbard model. We systematically compare the Hidden Fermion Determinant State
and the Jastrow-Backflow ansatz, parametrized by a Vision Transformer, finding
that in practice, their accuracy is similar. We also test different
symmetrization strategies, finding that output averaging yields the lowest
energies, though it becomes costly for larger system sizes. On cylindrical
systems, we consistently observe filled stripes. On the torus, our calculations
display features consistent with a doped Mott insulator, including
antiferromagnetic correlations and suppressed density fluctuations. Our results
demonstrate both the promise and current challenges of neural quantum states
for correlated fermions.

The coherence and fidelity of quantum dot (QD) spin qubits are fundamentally
limited by charge noise arising from electrically active trap states at oxide
interfaces, heterostructure boundaries, and within the bulk semiconductor.
These traps introduce electrostatic fluctuations that couple to the qubit via
spin-orbit interactions or charge-sensitive confinement potentials, leading to
dephasing and gate errors. In this work, we present a general trap
characterization framework for identifying and quantifying the spectral
signatures of these trap states using AC impedance spectroscopy, deep-level
transient spectroscopy (DLTS), and conventional capacitance-voltage (C-V)
analysis. While our case study focuses on strained Ge/SiGe quantum well
heterostructures, the approach is broadly applicable to other material systems
and qubit types. We demonstrate that each class of traps (oxide interface,
quantum well interface, and bulk) exhibits distinct fingerprints across
frequency- and time-domain measurements. Oxide traps dominate the low-frequency
conductance peaks and appear strongly in Nyquist and transient spectra. QW
interface traps, despite being nearly invisible at low densities in
conventional C-V and AC impedance analysis, are clearly resolved through
multi-exponential decay signatures in time-domain response. Bulk traps
contribute to high-frequency admittance and steady-state leakage currents. By
correlating each trap type to its characteristic time constant, spatial
location, and spectral impact, we provide a diagnostic toolset for
disentangling noise sources that degrade qubit performance. This unified
methodology bridges traditional defect metrology with emerging qubit noise
analysis and enables material- and process-level strategies for coherence
optimization in scalable quantum devices.

In liquid pnictogens, quasi-stable structures can be formed near melting
temperature. The nature of their stability does not have the unified point of
view. In the present work, the task of determining the degree of atomic bonding
in these structures is solved using the Crystal Orbital Hamilton Population
(COHP) method. The original results of ab-initio simulation of arsenic,
antimony and bismuth melts near their melting temperatures are used. It is
shown that the features of the electron interaction at the level of
$p$-orbitals determine the characteristic bond lengths and angles between
atoms. It has been established that the stability of structures decreases
according to a power law with an increase in the atomic mass of a chemical
element and the number of atoms in the structure. The obtained results clarify
the understanding the mechanisms of formation of quasi-stable structures in
pnictogen melts from first principles.

- **TL;DR**: 扩展EPW软件包以计算电子-声子耦合矩阵元素，应用于铁磁铁和镍，研究超导抑制机制和电阻特性差异

Magnetic materials are crucial for manipulating electron spin and magnetic
fields, enabling applications in data storage, spintronics, charge transport,
and energy conversion, while also providing insight into fundamental quantum
phenomena. In numerous applications, the interaction between electrons and
lattice vibrations, known as electron-phonon coupling, can be of significant
importance. In that regard, we extend the EPW package to be able to interpolate
the electron-phonon matrix elements combining perturbation theory and maximally
localized Wannier functions. This allows to use dense momentum grids at a
reasonable computational cost when computing electron-phonon-related quantities
and physical properties. We validate our implementation considering
ferromagnetic iron and nickel, where we explore the absence of phonon-driven
superconductivity, finding that superconductivity is intrinsically suppressed.
Furthermore, we evaluate the carrier resistivity at finite temperatures for
both systems, considering the role of the magnetic phase in carrier transport.
Our findings indicate that in the case of Fe, the primary contributor to
resistivity is electron-phonon scattering. In contrast, for Ni, electron-phonon
scattering constitutes less than one-third of the resistivity, underscoring a
fundamental difference in the transport properties of the two systems.

### Two-dimensional flat-bands in Moire-diamonds

- **TL;DR**: 提出通过引入sp3杂化在扭曲石墨中构建平带的新方法，替代传统魔角调控，在较大扭转角下实现稳定的二维平带态

The discovery of flat-bands in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene has
underscored the potential of moire engineering for correlated states, but such
phases are notoriously difficult to realize and highly fragile against
perturbations. Here, we propose an alternative route to flat-bands by
introducing sp3 hybridization in twisted graphite. Instead of relying on
fine-tuned magic angles, our approach identifies flat-band states at relatively
large twist angles with short moire periods. In this regime, sp3-induced
reconstructions generate electronic states that, once formed, are locked by
substantial energy barriers, rendering them robust against external
perturbations. Using twisted graphite as a prototype, we uncover a series
moire-diamond that host two-dimensional flat conduction of valence bands, where
carriers are localized within specific momentum planes but remain dispersive
along orthogonal directions. The emergence of dimensional flat-bands opens a
new platform for flat-band-driven correlated physics and suggests opportunities
for designing quantum materials with highly directional electronic
functionalities.

### A continued fraction approximation for the effective elasticity tensor of two-dimensional polycrystals as a function of the crystal elasticity tensor

- **TL;DR**: 该论文研究了二维多晶体的有效弹性张量，提出可以用类似于顺序层状微结构的分式展开来近似任意多晶体的弹性响应，并探讨了这种近似是否能精确匹配顺序层状结构。

For two-dimensional polycrystals the effective elasticity tensor $C_*$ as a
function $C_*(C_0)$ of the elasticity tensor $C_0$ of the constituent crystal
is considered. It is shown that this function can be approximated by one with a
continued fraction expansion resembling that associated with a class of
microstructure known as sequential laminates. These are hierarchical
microstructures defined inductively. Rank 0 sequential laminates are simply
rotations of the pure crystal. Rank $j$ sequential laminates are obtained by
laminating together, on a length scale much larger that the existing
microstructure and with interfaces perpendicular to some direction $n_j$, rank
$j-1$ sequential laminates with a rotation of the pure crystal. The continued
fraction approximation for arbitrary polycrystal microstructures typically
takes a more general form than that of sequential laminates, but has some free
parameters. It is an open question as to whether these free parameters can
always be adjusted so the continued fraction approximation matches exactly that
of a sequential laminate. If so, one would have established that the elastic
response of two-dimensional polycrystals can always be mimicked by that of
sequential laminates. Our analysis carries over to the more general case where
the strain is replaced by a field $E(x)$ that is the gradient of a vector
potential $u(x)$, i.e. $E=\nabla u$ and the stress is replaced by a matrix
valued field $J(x)$ that need not be symmetric but has zero divergence
$\nabla\cdot J=0$. The tensor $L(x)$ entering the constitutive relation $J=L E$
is locally a rotation of the tensor $L_0$ of the pure crystal that need not
have any special symmetries and has 16 independent tensor elements.

### Ab-initio calculation of magnetic exchange interactions using the spin-spiral method in VASP: Self-consistent versus magnetic force theorem approaches

- **TL;DR**: 本文比较了自洽(SC)和磁力定理(MFT)两种自旋螺旋方法在计算磁交换相互作用方面的表现，发现SC方法结果可靠，而MFT方法在高磁矩系统中会显著高估交换参数。

We present an ab initio investigation of magnetic exchange interactions using
the spin-spiral method implemented in the VASP code, with a comparative
analysis of the self-consistent (SC) and magnetic force theorem (MFT)
approaches. Using representative 3d ferromagnets (Fe, Co, Ni) and Mn-based full
Heusler compounds, we compute magnon dispersion relations directly from
spin-spiral total energies and extract real-space Heisenberg exchange
parameters via Fourier transformation. Curie temperatures are subsequently
estimated within both the mean-field and random-phase approximations. The SC
spin-spiral calculations yield exchange parameters and magnon spectra in
excellent agreement with previous theoretical data, confirming their
quantitative reliability across different classes of magnetic systems. In
contrast, the MFT approach exhibits systematic quantitative deviations: it
overestimates spin-spiral energies and exchange couplings in high-moment
systems such as bcc Fe and the Mn-based Heuslers, while underestimating them in
low-moment fcc Ni. The magnitude of these discrepancies increases strongly with
magnetic moment size, exceeding several hundred percent in the high-moment
compounds. These findings underscore the decisive role of self-consistency in
accurately determining magnetic exchange parameters and provide practical
guidance for future first-principles studies of spin interactions and
excitations using the spin-spiral technique.

A transfer-matrix-based theoretical framework is developed to study transport
in superconductor-quantum Hall-Superconductor (SQHS) Josephson junctions
modulated by local potential barriers in the quantum-Hall regime. The method
allows one to evaluate the change in the conductivity of such SQHS Josephson
junctions contributed by the intermediate chiral edge states (ICES) induced by
these local potential barriers at their electrostatic boundaries at specific
electron filling-fractions. It is particularly demonstrated how these ICES
created at different Landau levels (LL) overlap with each other through intra-
and inter-LL ICES mixing with the change in strength and width of the potential
barriers. This results in different mechanisms for forming Landau bands when an
array of such potential barriers are present. It is also demonstrated that our
theoretical framework can be extended to study the lattice effect in a bounded
domain in such SQHS Josephson junctions by simultaneously submitting the normal
region to a transverse magnetic field and periodic potential.

Insulating, atomically flat transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) like WSe2
are ideal substrates for probing intrinsic graphene properties. Conventionally,
their influence on graphene's band structure is assumed negligible,
particularly when small moire patterns form. Combining scanning tunneling
microscopy/spectroscopy and theoretical analysis, we reveal that the atomic
registry in graphene/WSe2 heterostructures profoundly modulates the electronic
structure of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG). At special
graphene/WSe2 twist angles, an incommensurate moire superlattice hosts three
distinct atomic stacking configurations (A, B, X types). These induce
position-dependent potentials that asymmetrically shift MATBG's flat bands,
transforming them from hole-side to electron-side asymmetric within a single
AA-stacked region. This symmetry breaking enables the unprecedented coexistence
of orthogonal stripe charge orders in the correlated regime-a phenomenon
previously considered mutually exclusive due to Coulomb repulsion. This band
modulation arises from the synergistic effects of the graphene/WSe2 interfacial
atomic registry and heterostrain within the MATBG, exhibiting multi-field
tunability. Our work establishes interfacial atomic registry as a critical,
previously overlooked tuning parameter for flat-band physics, opening avenues
to engineer correlated quantum states in van der Waals heterostructures.

### Should it really be that hard to model the chirality induced spin selectivity effect?

- **TL;DR**: 手性诱导自旋选择性效应的理论建模面临挑战，需要包含电子间相互作用，可能涉及时间反演对称性和昂萨格互易性的自发破缺。

The chirality induced spin selectivity effect remains a challenge to capture
with theoretical modeling. While at least a decade was spent on independent
electron models, which completely fail to reproduce the experimental results,
the lesson to be drawn out of these efforts is that a correct modeling of the
effect has to include interactions among the electrons. In the discussion of
the phenomenon ones inevitably encounters the Onsager reciprocity and
time-reversal symmetry, and questions whether the observations violate these
fundamental concepts, or whether we have not been able to identify what it is
that make those concepts redundant in this context. The experimental fact is
that electrons spin-polarize by one or another reason, when traversing chiral
molecules. The set-ups are simple enough to enable effective modeling, however,
overcoming the grand failures of the theoretical efforts, thus far, and
formulating a theory which is founded on microscopic modeling appears to be a
challenge. A discussion of the importance of electron correlations is outlined,
pointing to possible spontaneous breaking of time-reversal symmetry and Onsager
reciprocity.

### Electric Polarization-Driven Modulation of Fe Adatoms on Ferroelectric $α$-In$_2$Se$_3$

The interplay among structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of Fe
adatoms on the surface of two-dimensional ferroelectric {\alpha}-In$_2$Se$_3$
is investigated using first-principles electronic structure calculations, with
a focus on how these properties are modulated by the direction of the electric
polarization of the substrate. We identify two competing adsorption sites for
Fe adatoms, whose relative stability depends on the adatom concentration and
can be reversed by switching the electric polarization of
{\alpha}-In$_2$Se$_3$. The calculated energy barrier for thermally activated
hopping between these sites is approximately 0.4 eV, corresponding to a
blocking temperature of around 100 K. The hybridization between Fe and
In$_2$Se$_3$ orbitals strongly depends on the adsorption site and polarization
direction, driven by variations in the local adatom geometry. As a result, the
electronic configuration of adatom, magnetic moment, and magnetic anisotropy
exhibit a pronounced site dependence and can be effectively modulated by
switching the electric polarization of the In$_2$Se$_3$ layer. In particular,
at higher adatom concentrations, an exceptionally large perpendicular magnetic
anisotropy, exceeding 200 meV per Fe atom, emerges for one polarization
direction, but is largely diminished when the polarization is reversed. These
findings indicate that ferroelectric substrates offer a promising route for
voltage-controlled tuning of magnetic adatom properties via reversible
polarization switching.

We present example four-band Hermitian tight-binding Bogoliubov-de-Gennes
(BdG) Hamiltonians and Kramer's degenerate Hamiltonians in one dimension.
Starting from a generalized Rice-Mele model, we incorporate superconducting
terms to obtain a four-band BdG Hamiltonian with intrinsic charge-conjugation
symmetry, and constrain it using symmorphic or nonsymmorphic time-reversal
symmetries. In position space we find that each form of time-reversal symmetry,
when applied to random BdG matrices, results in a unique block diagonalization
of the Hamiltonian when translational symmetry is also enforced. We provide
representative models in all relevant symmorphic symmetry classes, including
the non-superconducting CII class. For nonsymmorphic time-reversal symmetry, we
identify a $\mathbb{Z}_4$ topological index with two phases supporting Majorana
zero modes and two without, and study disorder effects in the presence of
topological solitons. We further generalize a winding-number method, previously
applied only to $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariants without Kramer's degeneracy, to
compute indices for both the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ model and a non-superconducting AII
model with nonsymmorphic chiral symmetry and Kramer's degeneracy. We propose
topolectric circuit implementations of the charge-density-wave and
$\mathbb{Z}_4$ models which agree with the topological calculations. Finally,
we show that, in one dimension, nonsymmorphic unitary symmetries do not produce
new topological classifications beyond $\mathbb{Z}$ or $\mathbb{Z}_2$ indices.

Two-dimensional materials have attracted growing interest due to their unique
electronic properties and potential applications in spintronics. Interfacing
strongly spin-orbit-coupled chalcogenides with functional oxides such as
perovskites has a particularly high potential. In this work, highly textured
Bi2Te3 thin films were deposited on (111) oriented SrTiO3 by pulsed laser
deposition. We show that, by careful selection of the temperature and pressure
of growth, the film's stoichiometry can be manipulated between direct
stoichiometry transfer from the target and tellurium-deficient phases.
Optimized pulsed laser deposition enables the growth of films with coalesced,
faceted grains with grain sizes reaching up to 430 nm, while preserving
crystalline quality comparable to that of molecular-beam-epitaxy-grown films.
We show striking differences arising from tuning the laser's pulsing frequency
and fluence, which lead to changes in surface roughness, the film's porosity,
and grain boundaries, as well as grain shape. Analysis of cross-sectional
transmission electron microscopy images reveals a sharp substrate-film
interface without atomic intermixing and without the formation of amorphous
intermediate layers. The results demonstrate that pulsed laser deposition is a
viable method for producing high-quality Bi2Te3 thin films and opens the door
to the integration of chalcogenides with perovskites with this growth
technique.

We demonstrate a deterministic switching mechanism in collinear altermagnets
driven by asymmetric sublattice spin currents. Unlike conventional
antiferromagnets, where combined parity-time-reversal symmetry enforces purely
staggered sublattice spin torques, altermagnets host symmetry-protected
nonrelativistic spin splitting that produces unequal torques on the two
sublattices. Using doped FeSb$_2$ as a representative $d$-wave altermagnet, our
Landau--Lifshitz--Gilbert simulations show that these torques enable
magnetic-field-free and deterministic 180$^\circ$ N\'eel vector reversal over
picosecond timescale. The mechanism is generic to even-parity altermagnets and
remains effective even in centrosymmetric, weak spin-orbit coupled systems,
where the N\'eel spin-orbit torque mechanism fails. Our results establish an
experimentally accessible mechanism for switching of altermagnetic order,
opening pathways for realizing ultrafast, low-power altermagnet spintronic
devices.

Anisotropic strain engineering in epitaxial oxide films provides new
opportunities to control the antiferromagnetic and structural properties
crucial for advancements of antiferromagnetic spintronics. Here we report on a
(La0.7Sr0.3MnO3/LaFeO3)4 superlattice grown on (101)o DyScO3 substrate which
imposes significant anisotropic in-plane strain. Reciprocal space mapping
reveals selective strain relaxation along the tensile in-plane [010]o axis,
while compression along the perpendicular in-plane [-101]o axis remains
strained. Scanning precession electron diffraction and higher-order Laue zone
analysis show that the relaxation is accommodated by structural domain
formation in the LaFeO3 layers, initiating from the second bilayer and
propagating out-of-plane. These domains minimise structural defects and
correlate with the substrate step edges. X-ray magnetic dichroism measurements
reveal bulk-like in-plane antiferromagnetic order with polydomain signature as
previously reported. Our findings reveal the presence of structural domains
coexisting with antiferromagnetic polydomain states, showing a
strain-domain-magnetism relationship that provides insights for applications of
strain engineering in spintronics applications.

We present a systematic density-functional theory study of the effects of
strain on the structural and electronic properties in vanadium dioxide
(VO$_2$), with particular emphasis on its effect on the relative stability of
the metallic rutile and the insulating monoclinic M1 phases. We consider
various strain conditions that can be related to epitaxial strain present in
VO$_2$ films grown on different lattice planes. Our calculations confirm the
dominant role of $c$ axis strain, i.e., along the direction of the V-V
dimerization in the M1 phase. Our analysis suggests that this effect stems
primarily from the weakening of the lattice stiffness, with the hopping along
the $c$ axis playing a minor role. We also confirm that, in strain scenarios
that deform the basal plane, the $c$ axis strain still has a dominant effect on
the phase stability.

Grain boundaries (GBs) are ubiquitous in large-scale graphene samples,
playing a crucial role in their overall performance. Due to their complexity,
they are usually investigated as model structures, under the assumption of a
fully relaxed interface. Here, we present cantilever-based non-contact atomic
force microscopy (ncAFM) as a suitable technique to resolve, atom by atom, the
complete structure of these linear defects. Our experimental findings reveal a
richer scenario than expected, with the coexistence of energetically stable and
metastable graphene GBs. Although both GBs are structurally composed of
pentagonal and heptagonal like rings, they can be differentiated by the
irregular geometric shapes present in the metastable boundaries. Theoretical
modeling and simulated ncAFM images, accounting for the experimental data, show
that metastable GBs form under compressive uniaxial strain and exhibit vertical
corrugation, whereas stable GBs remain in a fully relaxed, flat configuration.
By locally introducing energy with the AFM tip, we show the possibility to
manipulate the metastable GBs, driving them toward their minimum energy
configuration. Notably, our high-resolution ncAFM images reveal a clear
dichotomy: while the structural distortions of metastable grain boundaries are
confined to just a few atoms, their impact on graphene's properties extends
over significantly larger length scales.

Multiferroic materials, in which electric polarization and magnetic order
coexist and couple, offer rich opportunities for both fundamental discovery and
technology. However, multiferroicity remains rare due to conflicting electronic
requirements for ferroelectricity and magnetism. One route to circumvent this
challenge is to exploit the noncollinear ordering of spin cycloids, whose
symmetry permits the emergence of polar order. In this work, we introduce
another pathway to multiferroic order in which strain generates polarization in
materials that host nonpolar spin spirals. To demonstrate this phenomenon, we
chose the spin spiral in the well-studied helimagnet Cr1/3NbS2. To detect the
induced polarization, we introduce the technique of magnetoelectric
birefringence (MEB), an optical probe that enables spatially-resolved and
unambiguous detection of polar order. By combining MEB imaging with strain
engineering, we confirm the onset of a polar vector at the magnetic transition,
establishing strained Cr1/3NbS2 as a type-II multiferroic.

We study the honeycomb lattice with a single magnetic impurity modeled by
adding imaginary next-nearest-neighbor hopping ih on a single hexagon. This
Haldane defect gives a topological mass term to the gapless Dirac cones and
generates chirality. For a small density of defects Neehus et al
[arXiv:2405.19289] found that the system's chirality reverses at a critical hc
~ 0.95 associated with an unexpected tri-critical point of Dirac fermions at
zero defect density. We investigate this zero-density limit by analyzing a
single defect and computing two experimentally relevant measures of chirality:
(1) orbital magnetization via local Chern marker, a bulk probe of all occupied
states; and (2) electronic currents of low-energy states. Both probes show a
chirality reversal at a critical hc ~ 0.9--1. Motivated by this consistency we
propose a defect-scale toy model whose low energy states reverse their
chirality at hc' ~ 0.87. Remarkably, the same pair of zero energy bound states
also generate the critical point hc in the full impurity projected T-matrix.
Our results show how the chirality reversal produced by an impurity can be
observed either in local probes or in the global topology and suggest a
possible role of the microscopic defect structure at the critical point.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文报道了一种基于范德华p-n异质结的多功能器件，通过使用p型SnSe和n型铁电α-In2Se3实现了近乎理想的二极管特性，并开发了铁电结场效应晶体管存储器，具有优异的存储性能和神经形态计算潜力。

Van der Waals (vdW) p-n heterojunctions are important building blocks for
advanced electronics and optoelectronics, in which high-quality heterojunctions
essentially determine device performances or functionalities. Creating tunable
depletion regions with substantially suppressed leakage currents presents huge
challenges, but is crucial for heterojunction applications. Here, by using
band-aligned p-type SnSe and n-type ferroelectric {\alpha}-In2Se3 as a model,
we report near-ideal multifunctional vdW p-n heterojunctions with small reverse
leakage currents (0.1 pA) and a desired diode ideality factor (1.95).
As-fabricated junction transistors exhibit superior performance, such as a high
on/off ratio of over 105. Importantly, we realize ferroelectric-tuned band
alignment with a giant barrier modulation of 900 meV. Based on such tunable
heterojunctions, we propose and demonstrate a fundamental different device
termed ferroelectric junction field-effect transistor memory, which shows large
memory windows (1.8 V), ultrafast speed (100 ns), high operation temperature
(393 K), and low cycle-to-cycle variation (2 %). Additionally, the reliable
synaptic characteristics of these memory devices promise low-power neuromorphic
computing. Our work provides a new device platform with switchable memory
heterojunctions, applicable to high performance brain-inspired electronics and
optoelectronics.

Magnets with controllable magnetization and high critical temperature are
essential for practical spintronics devices, among which the two-dimensional
1T-CrTe2 stands out because of its high experimental critical temperature up to
about 300K down to the single layer limit. By using ab initio density
functional theory, we investigate the magnetic properties of monolayer and
bilayer 1T-CrTe2 and demonstrate that the magnetic properties, such as the
magnetocrystalline anisotropy, critical Curie temperature and magnetizations,
can be influenced by strain or electric fields.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究通过铁电平台实现动态可调的氢吸附强度，打破了Sabatier原理的限制，在氢析出反应中实现了超越火山型关系的优异催化活性。

The Sabatier principle establishes a fundamental trade-off in heterogeneous
electrocatalysis.In the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), this trade-off is
manifested by the coupling of Volmer step, which requires strong hydrogen
adsorption, with the Heyrovsky/Tafel step, which favors facile desorption, thus
giving rise to the classical volcano relationship and limiting activity even at
$\Delta G=0$. Here, we demonstrate a ferroelectric platform with dynamic
tunability -- monolayer GeS$_2$ decorated with transition metal atoms as a
proof-of-concept -- where polarization-driven surface electronic reconstruction
enables real-time modulation of intermediate binding strength, thereby breaking
the Sabatier constraint. Reversible control of hydrogen adsorption allows
strong H binding to accelerate the Volmer step, followed by weakened adsorption
to promote the Heyrovsky/Tafel step.This dynamic adsorption-desorption
decoupling not only surpasses the volcano limit to achieve unprecedented HER
activity, but also establishes a general paradigm for designing adaptive
electrocatalysts capable of reconfiguring under operating conditions.

A change in a materials electrical resistance with magnetic field
(magnetoresistance) results from quantum interference effects and, or
spin-dependent transport, depending on materials properties and dimensionality.
In disordered conductors, electron interference leads to weak localization or
anti-localization; in contrast, ferromagnetic conductors support spin-dependent
scattering, leading to giant magnetoresistance (GMR). By varying the thickness
of Au between 4 and 28 nm in a EuS/Au/EuS spin-switches, we observe a crossover
from weak anti-localization to interfacial GMR. The crossover is related to a
magnetic proximity effect in Au due to electron scattering at the insulating
EuS interface. The proximity-induced exchange field in Au suppresses weak
anti-localization, consistent with Maekawa-Fukuyama theory. With increasing Au
thickness, GMR emerges along with spin Hall magnetoresistance. These findings
demonstrate spin transport governed by interfacial exchange fields, building a
framework for spintronic functionality without metallic magnetism.

Triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS) are discovered to conform to surfaces
of given charge density distributions embedded in crystals [Z. Kristallogr.
\textbf{170}, 138 (1985)]. Based on our previous work [Phys. Rev. Mater.
\textbf{9}, 073802 (2025)], we discovered that crystals can have surfaces of a
given charge density converging to TPMS. We also discovered that end states
connected by a martensitic phase transformation should have their corresponding
TPMS being topologically equivalent. In this work, we gave an explanation for
the topological continuity of a martensitic phase transformation and studied
how TPMS indicate whether a non-magnetic crystal can undergo a martensitic
phase transformation or not.

Inspired by the recently synthesized hexagonal layered phase of FeF$_2$, we
studied the magnetic properties of the 1T-FeF$_2$ monolayer and its Janus
Fe$X$F ($X$ = O, S) derivatives by first-principles calculations. Our results
confirm that these materials are antiferromagnetic semiconductors, and that
anion substitution effectively tunes their material properties: the band gap
shifts from 3.37 eV (direct, FeF$_2$) to 2.35 eV (direct, FeOF) and 1.13 eV
(indirect, FeSF); the magnetic moment of Fe ions increases; and the N\'{e}el
temperature ($T_N$) rises dramatically to 248 K (FeSF) and 207 K (FeOF). Janus
structures exhibit enhanced magnetic moment and direct AFM coupling. Under
compression, $T_N$ is further optimized to 274 K ($-2$\% strain, FeSF) and 244
K ($-5$\% strain, FeOF). Both Janus materials retain their semiconducting
nature and direction of easy magnetization axis under $\pm5$\% strain. This
study validates the Janus structure as a viable approach to enhance 2D
antiferromagnetism and highlights Fe-based oxyhalides as promising spintronic
materials.

- **TL;DR**: 本文提出了一种改进的瞬态光栅光谱技术（UTGS），首次直接实验可视化了材料表面的格林函数，揭示了弹性各向异性带来的复杂细节。

Ultrasonic wave propagation across material surfaces reveals essential
information about the materials' elastic behavior. The elastodynamic response
of the surface is characterized by the Green's function that fully captures all
its direction-dependent and frequency-dependent features. Here we present the
first direct experimental visualization of the Green's function, including all
its complex details resulting from elastic anisotropy. We achieve this
visualization using a dedicated modification of transient grating spectroscopy
(TGS), which is a method otherwise well established for measuring Rayleigh-type
surface acoustic waves. To overcome the limitations of conventional TGS, we
explore near-field thermoacoustic phenomena occurring within TGS experiments.
We reveal that, along with the transient standing-wave patterns that diminish
within hundreds of nanoseconds, there also emerge ultra-transient oscillations
with lifetimes at least an order of magnitude shorter. These ultra-transient
effects enable capturing the surface acoustic response with exceptional detail,
and the resulting experimental angular dispersion maps strikingly replicate the
theoretical Green's functions. By utilizing this feature, ultra-transient
grating spectroscopy (UTGS) becomes a powerful new tool for detailed
contactless characterization of anisotropic solids, opening new pathways for
studying single-crystalline materials utilized in diverse modern application
fields, including solid-state cooling via the elastocaloric effect,
magnetoelastic devices, or nanoscale electromechanical systems.

The growth of two-dimensional epitaxial materials on industrially relevant
substrates is critical for enabling their scalable synthesis and integration
into next-generation technologies. Here we present a comprehensive study of the
molecular beam epitaxial growth of gallium selenide on 2-inch c-plane sapphire
substrates. Using in-situ reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED),
in-situ Raman spectroscopy, optical and scanning electron microscopies, we
construct a diagram of the gallium selenide growth modes as a function of
substrate temperature (530-650 {\deg}C) and Se/Ga flux ratio (5-110). The
growth mode diagram reveals distinct regimes, including the growth of layered
post-transition metal monochalcogenide GaSe with an unstrained in-plane lattice
constant of 0.371$\pm$0.001 nm and a partial epitaxial alignment on sapphire.
This work demonstrates a RHEED-based pathway for synthesizing gallium selenide
of specific phase and morphology, and the construction of a phase diagram for
high vapor pressure III-VI compounds that can be applied to a wide range of
other metal chalcogenide materials.

We develop a quantitative model of ionization processes in biological tissues
under Ultra High Dose Rate (UHDR) radiation. The underlying conjecture is that
of electron-hole liquid (EHL) forming in water based substances of biological
tissues. Unlike the earlier known EHL in semiconductor crystals, the charge
carriers here are low mobile due to strong interactions with the background
(solvated electrons, etc.); hence, EHL resembling ionic melts. Similar to all
ionic systems, the Coulomb coupling makes that EHL energetically favorable that
leads to recombination barriers suppressing subsequent structural
transformations. In particular, generation of secondary reactive species in
such EHL becomes limited translating into reduction of biological damages and
tissue sparing effect. We show how these processes are sensitive to the tissue
quality and frequency dispersion of the dielectric permittivity. Equations for
dose and dose rate defining the sparing thresholds are derived.

The structures and properties of moire patterns in twisted bilayers of
two-dimensional (2D) materials are known to depend sensitively on twist angle,
yet their dependence on stacking order remains comparatively underexplored. In
this study, we use molecular dynamics simulations to systematically investigate
the combined effects of stacking order and rotation in MoS2 bilayers. Beginning
from five well-established high-symmetry bilayer stackings, we apply twist
angles between 1 and 120 to the top layer, revealing a variety of relaxed moire
structures. Our results show that the initial stacking significantly influences
the moire domain configurations that emerge at a given twist angle. While all
five stacking orders are metastable without twist, they form two
moire-equivalent classes- AA/AB and AA',A'B,AB', i.e., for a given twist angle,
structures within each class relax to the same moire configuration.
Specifically, initial AA and AB stackings give rise to triangular ferroelectric
domains near 0+/-3, while AA', A'B, and AB' stackings produce triangular
ferroelectric domains near 60+/-3. At precisely 60 and 120 twists, the bilayers
relax to into pure high-symmetry stackings, highlighting the rotational
relationships between these configurations and explaining the shift of 60 in
the ferroelectric rotational range. These findings demonstrate the critical
role of stacking order in governing the rich moire landscapes accessible in
twistronic systems.

Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is a widely studied layered material for
electronic, optical, and catalytic applications. It can host lithium ions
between the van der Waals layers, which triggers a phase transition between the
semiconducting 2H phase and metallic 1T phase. While lithium insertion triggers
a phase transition to the 1T phase, the phase behavior upon electrochemical
lithium removal is not resolved. In this work, we conduct single-flake
electrochemical (de)lithiation of MoS2 using microelectrode arrays. Through
both electrochemical voltage analysis and correlative Raman spectroscopy, we
show that an electrochemically cycled and delithiated MoS2 flake initially
remains in the 1T phase. However, over the course of several days, it
transitions back into the thermodynamically stable 2H phase. This result
resolves the phase transformation pathway upon delithiation and showcases the
ability to electrochemically synthesize the metastable 1T-MoS2 phase.

The importance of electrical contact resistance and thermal boundary

The use of a rich range of materials with various bandstructures (e.g.
parabolic, conical), and in geometries exploiting various dimensionalities
(e.g. 1D wires, 2D sheets, and 3D bulk) will increase in the future. Here we
derive a single general expression for the quantum limit of electrical contact
resistivity for various bandstructures and all dimensions. A corresponding
result for the quantum limit of thermal boundary resistance is also derived.
These results will be useful to quantitatively co-design, benchmark, and guide
the lowering of electrical and thermal boundary resistances for energy
efficient devices.

An issue concerning the Frenkel line of liquid CO2 is that its location has
not been unequivocally determined. So far, reliable Frenkel lines were
identified from velocity autocorrelation functions (VAFs) computed by Molecular
Dynamic simulations; however VAFs cannot be directly verified experimentally.
By contrast, the co-ordination numbers (CNs) can be measured experimentally by
X-ray and neutron scattering or computed by Monte Carlo (MC) simulation, and
thus provide an alternative means of determining the location of the Frenkel
line. In the present study, the CNs were computed by MC simulation using the
Kihara potential, and the Frenkel anomalies were identified at {P = 100 bar, T
= 260 K}, in good agreement with previous results based on VAFs, and at {P =
1000 bar, T = 370 K}, which deviates significantly from them.

The limited quantum yield of strained monolayer transition metal
dichalcogenides grown by vapor-phase methods and during transfer-based stacking
poses a fundamental challenge for their optoelectronic applications. Here, we
introduce the concept of "entropy engineering" as a transformative strategy to
selectively enhance light-matter interactions through controlled
electron-phonon coupling. We unveil how tailored entropy introduced via precise
selenium doping or interfacial van der Waals proximity can significantly
amplify radiative recombination from momentum-dark excitons in WS2 monolayers.
Notably, we discover that slight selenium doping drastically enhances the
photoluminescence (PL) of WS2 under strain. While both undoped and heavily
doped WS2 suffer from strong PL quenching owing to the direct-to-indirect
bandgap transition, lightly Se-doped samples exhibit an order-of-magnitude
increase in emission intensity. This counterintuitive boost is traced to
doping-induced structural disorder, which intensifies electron-phonon
interactions and unlocks efficient phonon-assisted emission from otherwise
non-radiative indirect excitons. Moreover, we demonstrate that van der Waals
coupling to adjacent Se-doped layers can impart interfacial entropy and further
augment PL via proximity effects. Our work highlights entropy engineering via
controlled doping as a powerful strategy for activating high-efficiency light
emission in atomically thin semiconductors.

Relaxor ferroelectric thin films are recognized for their ultrahigh power
density, rendering them highly promising for energy storage applications in
electrical and electronic systems. However, achieving high energy storage
performance with chemically homogeneous, environmentally friendly and
compositionally stable materials remains challenging. In this work, we present
a design of dielectrics with high energy storage performance via an in-plane
polar domains incorporating polar nanoregions mechanism. Guided by phase-field
simulations, we synthesized La/Si co-doping BaTiO3 solid-solution thin films
with high chemical homogeneity to realize high energy storage performance.
Given that, we achieve a high energy density of 203.7J/cm3 and an energy
efficiency of approximately 80% at an electric field of 6.15MV/cm. This
mechanism holds significant promise for the design of next-generation
high-performance dielectric materials for energy storage and other advanced

their reliability across chemical and functional domains. We introduce a
transferable multi-domain training strategy that jointly optimizes universal
and task-specific parameters through selective regularization, coupled with a
domain-bridging set (DBS) that aligns potential-energy surfaces across
datasets. Systematic ablation experiments show that small DBS fractions (0.1%)
and targeted regularization synergistically enhance out-of-distribution
generalization while preserving in-domain fidelity. Trained on fifteen open
databases spanning molecules, crystals, and surfaces, our model, SevenNet-Omni,
achieves state-of-the-art cross-domain accuracy, including adsorption-energy
errors below 0.06 eV on metallic surfaces and 0.1 eV on metal-organic
frameworks. Despite containing only 0.5% r$^2$SCAN data, SevenNet-Omni
reproduces high-fidelity r$^2$SCAN energetics, demonstrating effective
cross-functional transfer from large PBE datasets. This framework offers a
scalable route toward universal, transferable MLIPs that bridge
quantum-mechanical fidelities and chemical domains.

Dodecagonal oxide quasicrystals (OQCs) have so far been limited to a few
elemental systems, with no general formation mechanism established. Here, we
demonstrate a versatile approach to OQC formation via a host-atom-induced
transformation of a metal-oxide honeycomb (HC) network. Adsorption of Ba, Sr,
or Eu onto the HC layer triggers its reorganization into a dodecagonal tiling,
as revealed by low-energy electron diffraction and scanning tunneling
microscopy. Full conversion occurs when 73% of the honeycomb rings are
occupied. Kelvin probe and UV photoelectron spectroscopy show a linear decrease
in work function with increasing host coverage, followed by a sharp increase
upon quasicrystal formation due to reduced host dipoles. This transformation
mechanism enables the fabrication of structurally precise OQCs, including a new
Eu-Ti-O phase that extends the field to lanthanide quasicrystals, forming a 2D
grid of localized magnetic moments. The method offers a general route to
explore lattice-matched substrates for epitaxial growth and may be adapted to
other 2D honeycomb materials - such as graphene, hexagonal ice, and silica -
paving the way for engineered aperiodic systems beyond transition metal oxides.

We illustrate ion-beam engineering of MoO3 Ag Au multilayer plasmonic
substrates to improve SERS performance, We illustrate ion-beam engineering of
MoO3-Ag-Au multilayer plasmonic substrates to improve SERS performance.
Orthorhombic {\alpha}-MoO3 microflakes were produced via chemical vapour
deposition (CVD) on Si-SiO2 substrates. Thin films of Ag (5 nm) and Au (5 nm)
were thermally evaporated onto the MoO3 flakes, and the samples were subjected
to 100 MeV Ag8+ swift heavy ion irradiation at fluences of 3e11 and 3e12 ions
cm-2. Irradiation causes dewetting of metal films, prompting structural and
morphological changes that result in the formation of dispersed Ag-Au
nanoparticles, enhanced surface roughness, and defect generation within the
MoO3 lattice. X-ray diffraction (XRD) verifies the {\alpha}-MoO3 phase; field
emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) elucidates nanoparticle formation
and surface reorganisation; Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) disclose vibrational alterations and binding-energy shifts
in Mo 3d, indicative of oxygen vacancies (V_O) and partial reduction of Mo.
SERS measurements of molecular probes demonstrate significantly increased Raman
intensities following ion irradiation.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文提出了一种基于MOVPE生长的hBN平台，通过电子束辐照制造气泡，实现了无需激活的单光子发射器，并提供了增强发射、可重定位发射器和应变效应研究等功能。

Single-photon emitters (SPEs) in two-dimensional materials are highly
promising candidates for quantum technologies. SPEs in hexagonal boron nitride
(hBN) have been widely investigated, but mostly in exfoliated or powder samples
that require an activation process, making it difficult to compare studies and
reproduce results. Here, we address this problem and propose a platform based
on large-area metaloraganic vapour phase epitaxy (MOVPE)-grown hBN, which
combines reproducibility and scalability with the ability to readily host SPEs
without activation. Through the creation of bubbles via electron-beam
irradiation, we achieve additional functionalities, including an
interference-mediated enhancement of emission by approximately 100-200\%,
dedicated structures that allow the relocation of individual emitters across
different systems, and the opportunity to investigate strain-induced effects.
Moreover, in contrast to other gas-filled bubbles that deflate at low
temperatures, our bubbles remain stable under cryogenic conditions, allowing
studies as a function of temperature. To improve the control over the shape and
position of bubbles, we demonstrate a~mask-based method that enables
deterministic control over bubble formation. The presented hBN bubbles
constitute a versatile platform for reproducible studies of hBN-based emitters,
providing a reliable insight into their nature and properties.
