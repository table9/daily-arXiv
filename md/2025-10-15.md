- **TL;DR**: 通过73Ge核四极共振(NQR)和核磁共振(NMR)研究重费米子量子临界铁磁体CeRh6Ge4，揭示了其铁磁相变、自旋动力学和4f电子局域矩的各向异性特征。

We report $^{73}$Ge nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) and magnetic resonance
(NMR) spectroscopy in the heavy-fermion quantum-critical ferromagnet
CeRh$_6$Ge$_4$. NQR and NMR spectral measurements at the two non-equivalent Ge
sites reveal electric field gradient tensors and the directions of their
principal axes relative to the hexagonal basal plane. The spin-lattice
relaxation rate $1/T_1$ experiments reveal a clear critical slowing down
approaching the ferromagnetic transition. $1/T_1$ in the paramagnetic state is
found to be predominantly caused by fluctuating 4$f$-local moments. The Knight
shift shows Curie-Weiss behavior at high temperature and a deviation from this
below $T^\ast$ $\approx$ 25 K possibly due to a mixture of crystalline electric
field effects and Kondo screening. Order-parameter-like behavior of hyperfine
fields at the Ge sites and ferromagnetic signal enhancement are observed in
Zeeman-perturbed NQR, with uniform ferromagnetic order and a small ordered
moment of $\approx$ 0.26 $\mu_B$/Ce confined within the $ab$-plane. The ordered
moment shows a notable in-plane magnetic stiffness against out-of-plane
radiofrequency fields and has an (XY-type) in-plane isotropic nature. Our
results reveal a strong easy-plane anisotropy of 4$f$-electron moment and
suggest an involved interplay of hybridization and local moment physics in this
quantum critical heavy-fermion ferromagnet.

- **TL;DR**: 结合原子分辨扫描隧道显微镜和量子蒙特卡洛模拟，研究无序二维电子维格纳固体在不同类型无序作用下的相行为，发现两种不同的物理机制取决于短程无序密度与电子密度的相对大小。

Electron Wigner solids (WSs)1-12 provide an ideal system for understanding
the competing effects of electron-electron and electron-disorder interactions,
a central unsolved problem in condensed matter physics. Progress in this topic
has been limited by a lack of single-defect-resolved experimental measurements
as well as accurate theoretical tools to enable realistic experiment-theory
comparison. Here we overcome these limitations by combining atomically-resolved
scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) with quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulation
of disordered 2D electron WSs. STM was used to image the electron density
($n_e$) dependent evolution of electron WSs in gate-tunable bilayer MoSe$_2$
devices with varying long-range ($n_\mathrm{LR}$) and short-range
($n_\mathrm{SR}$) disorder densities. These images were compared to QMC
simulations using realistic disorder maps extracted from experiment, thus
allowing the roles of different disorder types to be disentangled. We identify
two distinct physical regimes for disordered electron WSs that depend on the
magnitude of $n_\mathrm{SR}$. For $n_\mathrm{SR} \lesssim n_e$ the WS behavior
is dominated by long-range disorder and features extensive mixed solid-liquid
phases, a new type of re-entrant melting-crystallization, and prominent Friedel
oscillations. In contrast, when $n_\mathrm{SR} \gg n_e$ these features are
suppressed and a more robust amorphous WS phase emerges that persists to higher
$n_e$, highlighting the importance of short-range disorder in this regime. Our
work establishes a new framework for studying disordered quantum solids via a
combined experimental-theoretical approach.

### $η$-pairing in the model with two-particle hybridization of conduction and localized electrons

- **TL;DR**: 该论文在考虑传导电子和局域电子双粒子杂化的模型框架下，计算了传导电子间的有效相互作用，发现当局域电子双粒子态能量位于费米能级以上的传导带时，这种相互作用是吸引性的。

Within the framework of a model, that takes into account two-particle
hybridization of conduction and localized electrons, the effective interaction
between conduction electrons is calculated. It is shown that this interaction
is attractive when the energy of the localized electron corresponding to the
two-particle state lies in the conduction band above the Fermi energy. The
magnitude of the attractive interaction is minimal for $\eta$-paired states of
conduction electrons. We generalize the original $\eta$-pairing construction
for the proposed model and show that the superconducting state can indeed be
realized.

### The spin Hall conductivity in the hole-doped bilayer Haldane-Hubbard model with odd-parity ALM

- **Categories**: cond-mat.str-el
- **TL;DR**: 提出双层Haldane-Hubbard模型，通过时间反演连接的两层实现补偿奇宇称自旋分裂和T-偶自旋霍尔电导率。

Spin current generated electrically is among the core phenomena of
spintronics for driving high-performance spin device applications. Here, on the
basis of systematic investigations for the hole doped single-layer
Haldane-Hubbard(HH) model, we propose a new bilayer HH model to realize the
compensated odd-parity spin splitting and the $T$-even spin Hall conductivity
where the two layers are connected by the time reversal transformation. Our
results show that the vanishing layer-dependent electric potential $V_{L}$
gives rise to odd-parity ALM protected by the combined symmetry $TM_{xy}$ with
$T$ and $M_{xy}$ being the time reversal and mirror reflection perpendicular to
$z$ axis, and the $T$-even spin Hall conductivity simultaneously. In addition,
though the staggered magnetization within each layer is substantially impacted
by the layer-dependent electric potential, small $V_{L}$'s only bring
negligible changes to the net magnetization and the spin Hall conductivity,
indicating that the alternating spin splitting in momentum space and the spin
Hall conductivity are insusceptible to external elements. Most importantly, our
work provides a general framework for the simultaneous realization of the
compensated odd-parity spin splitting in momentum space and the spin Hall
conductivity in collinear magnets, in terms of stacked multi-layer systems.

### Self-attention enabled quantum path analysis of high-harmonic generation in solids

- **TL;DR**: 提出基于Transformer编码器的机器学习方法，用于分析和重构固体高次谐波产生信号，通过自注意力机制揭示时间域偶极动力学与高频光谱分量之间的相关性。

High-harmonic generation (HHG) in solids provides a powerful platform to
probe ultrafast electron dynamics and interband--intraband coupling. However,
disentangling the complex many-body contributions in the HHG spectrum remains
challenging. Here we introduce a machine-learning approach based on a
Transformer encoder to analyze and reconstruct HHG signals computed from a
one-dimensional Kronig--Penney model. The self-attention mechanism inherently
highlights correlations between temporal dipole dynamics and high-frequency
spectral components, allowing us to identify signatures of nonadiabatic band
coupling that are otherwise obscured in standard Fourier analysis. By combining
attention maps with Gabor time--frequency analysis, we extract and amplify weak
coupling channels that contribute to even-order harmonics and anomalous
spectral features. Our results demonstrate that multi-head self-attention acts
as a selective filter for strong-coupling events in the time domain, enabling a
physics-informed interpretation of high-dimensional quantum dynamics. This work
establishes Transformer-based attention as a versatile tool for solid-state
strong-field physics, opening new possibilities for interpretable machine
learning in attosecond spectroscopy and nonlinear photonics.

### Marcus Theory and The Condon Approximation Revisited I: E-SHAKE and Seam Sampling

- **TL;DR**: 本文重新审视了Marcus理论与实验在C-13-ae分子上的不一致性，通过引入E-SHAKE方法揭示了Condon近似失效和锥形交叉的存在，并预测了同位素效应对三重态-三重态能量转移速率的影响。

Marcus theory is the workhorse of theoretical chemistry for predicting the
rates of charge and energy transfer. Marcus theory overwhelmingly agrees with
experiment -- both in terms of electron transfer and triplet energy transfer --
for the famous set of naphthalene-bridge-biphenyl and
naphthalene-bridge-benzophenone systems studied by Piotrowiak, Miller, and
Closs. That being said, the agreement is not perfect, and in this manuscript,
we revisit one key point of disagreement: the molecule C-13-ae
([3,equatorial]-naphthalene-cyclohexane-[1,axial]-benzophenone). To better
understand the theory-experiment disagreement, we introduce and employ a novel
scheme to sample the seam between two diabatic electronic states (E-SHAKE)
through which we reveal the breakdown of the Condon approximation and the
presence of a conical intersection for the C-13-ae molecule; we also predict an
isotopic effect on the rate of triplet-triplet energy transfer.

### Epitaxial Electrodeposition of Fe with Controlled In-Plane Variants for Reversible Metal Anode in Aqueous Electrolyte

- **TL;DR**: 本文展示了在水系电解质中实现铁在单晶铜基底上的外延电沉积策略，通过比较多晶和单晶铜基底上的电沉积行为，发现单晶铜能够实现高度均匀、致密且晶体学对齐的铁生长。

The development of reversible metal anodes is a key challenge for advancing
aqueous battery technologies, particularly for scalable and safe stationary
energy storage applications. Here we demonstrate a strategy to realize
epitaxial electrodeposition of iron (Fe) on single-crystal copper (Cu)
substrates in aqueous electrolytes. We compare the electrodeposition behavior
of Fe on polycrystalline and single-crystalline Cu substrates, revealing that
the latter enables highly uniform, dense, and crystallographically aligned Fe
growth. Comprehensive electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and X-ray
diffraction (XRD) analysis confirms the formation of Fe with specific
out-of-plane and in-plane orientations, including well-defined rotational
variants. Our findings highlight that epitaxial electrodeposition of Fe can
suppress dendritic growth and significantly enhance Coulombic efficiency during
plating/stripping cycles. This approach bridges fundamental crystallography
with practical electrochemical performance, providing a pathway toward
high-efficiency aqueous batteries utilizing Earth-abundant materials.

### Magnetometry with Broadband Microwave Fields in Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers in Diamond

- **TL;DR**: 提出一种使用宽带微波场同时探测金刚石中氮空位中心所有磁敏感状态的方法，实现了低于1 nT/√Hz的直流磁场测量灵敏度，并开发了基于最大似然估计和神经网络的分析工具。

Nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are optically addressable and
versatile light-matter interfaces with practical application in magnetic field
sensing, offering the ability to operate at room temperature and reach
sensitivities below pT/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}.$ We propose an approach to
simultaneously probe all of the magnetically sensitive states using a broadband
microwave field and demonstrate that it can be used to measure the external DC
magnetic field strength with sensitivities below 1~nT/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}.$ We
develop tools for analyzing the temporal signatures in the transmitted
broadband microwaves to estimate the magnetic field, comparing maximum
likelihood estimation based on minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence to
various neural network models, and both methods independently reach practical
sensitivities. These results are achieved without optimizing parameters such as
the bandwidth, power, and shape of the probing microwave field such that, with
further improvements, sensitivities down to $\mathrm{pT/\sqrt{Hz}}$ can be
envisioned. Our results motivate novel implementations of NV-based magnetic
sensors with the potential for vectorial magnetic field detection at 1-10 kHz
update rates and improved sensitivities without requiring a bias magnetic
field.

### Low-field all-optical detection of superconductivity using NV nanodiamonds

- **TL;DR**: 利用纳米金刚石中的氮空位中心通过近零场交叉弛豫磁力测量技术，提供了一种无需微波、非侵入性的超导体探测平台。该方法通过将纳米金刚石沉积在YBCO薄膜上测量临界参数：转变温度和穿透场。

Nitrogen-vacancy centers in nanodiamond offer a microwave-free, noninvasive
platform for probing superconductors via near zero-field cross-relaxation
magnetometry. We demonstrate this by depositing nanodiamonds on YBCO thin films
to measure critical parameters: transition temperature and penetration field.
This method leverages nanodiamond fluorescence modulation as a result of
magnetic field variation with 1mT amplitude to observe the Meissner effect and
field scans to measure the penetration field. The approach is minimally
invasive and can be applied to superconducting samples with rough surfaces,
facilitating the study of flux vortices and critical phenomena in complex
geometries.

### Quantum Spin Singlet and Classical Néel-Ordered Ground States in MoX3 (X = I, Br) Spin-3/2 Dimerized Antiferromagnetic Chain Crystals

- **TL;DR**: MoX3 (X=I, Br)是罕见的范德华材料，同时表现出量子自旋链和经典尼尔序的特征，在40K以下呈现经典反铁磁基态，40K以上显示量子自旋单重态行为。

We report that MoX3 (X = I, Br) are rare van der Waals materials that exhibit
signatures of both quantum spin chains with a spin singlet ground state and
classical Neel order. Bulk single crystals grown by chemical vapor transport
exhibit classical antiferromagnetic ground states with a transition temperature
of ~40 K as revealed by susceptibility and specific heat measurements. Above 40
K, the susceptibilities show the large, broad peaks associated with a quantum
spin-singlet ground state and large singlet-triplet gaps of 21 meV and 25 meV.
Monte Carlo simulations, density matrix renormalization-group calculations for
finite spin-3/2 chains, and density functional theory reproduce the
experimental behavior, confirming the interplay between strong one-dimensional
intrachain and weak three-dimensional interchain couplings. MoX3 offers a
unique platform for exploring quantum magnetism and magnetic excitations at the
atomic chain limit, as these materials combine a 1D van der Waals motif, spin
chain behavior, and classical interchain order.

### plasmonX: an Open-Source Code for Nanoplasmonics

- **TL;DR**: plasmonX是一个用于模拟复杂纳米结构等离子体响应的开源代码，支持原子级和隐式描述，包含多种计算模型和后处理模块。

We present the first public release of plasmonX, a novel open-source code for
simulating the plasmonic response of complex nanostructures. The code supports
both fully atomistic and implicit descriptions of nanomaterials. In particular,
it employs the frequency-dependent fluctuating charges ($\omega$FQ) and dipoles
($\omega$FQF$\mu$) models to describe the response properties of atomistic
structures, including simple and $d$-metals, graphene-based structures, and
multi-metal nanostructures. For implicit representations, the Boundary Element
Method is implemented in both the dielectric polarizable continuum model (DPCM)
and integral equation formalism (IEF-PCM) variants. The distribution also
includes a post-processing module that enables analysis of electric
field-induced properties such as charge density and electric field patterns.

### Enhancing Diffusion-Based Sampling with Molecular Collective Variables

- **TL;DR**: 本文提出了一种基于扩散的分子采样方法，通过引入集体变量和排斥势能来提高采样效率，能够发现更多热力学相关模式并估计自由能差异。

Diffusion-based samplers learn to sample complex, high-dimensional
distributions using energies or log densities alone, without training data.
Yet, they remain impractical for molecular sampling because they are often
slower than molecular dynamics and miss thermodynamically relevant modes.
Inspired by enhanced sampling, we encourage exploration by introducing a
sequential bias along bespoke, information-rich, low-dimensional projections of
atomic coordinates known as collective variables (CVs). We introduce a
repulsive potential centered on the CVs from recent samples, which pushes
future samples towards novel CV regions and effectively increases the
temperature in the projected space. Our resulting method improves efficiency,
mode discovery, enables the estimation of free energy differences, and retains
independent sampling from the approximate Boltzmann distribution via
reweighting by the bias. On standard peptide conformational sampling
benchmarks, the method recovers diverse conformational states and accurate free
energy profiles. We are the first to demonstrate reactive sampling using a
diffusion-based sampler, capturing bond breaking and formation with universal
interatomic potentials at near-first-principles accuracy. The approach resolves
reactive energy landscapes at a fraction of the wall-clock time of standard
sampling methods, advancing diffusion-based sampling towards practical use in
molecular sciences.

### Bond-resolved STM with density-based methods

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种模拟键分辨扫描隧道显微镜图像的新方法，结合全密度模型和陈氏导数近似，能够准确再现实验数据中的σ和π通道贡献及尖端-样品距离相关特征。

Bond-resolved STM (BRSTM) is a recent technique that combines the advantages
of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) with the outstanding intramolecular
resolution provided by non-contact atomic force microscopy (ncAFM) using a
CO-functionalized tips, offering unique insights into molecular interactions at
surfaces. In this work, we present a novel and easily implementable approach
for simulating BRSTM images, which we have applied to reproduce new
experimental BRSTM data of Perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic dianhydride
(PTCDA) on Ag(111), obtained with unprecedented control of tip-sample
separation ($\sim$10~pm). Our method integrates the Full-Density-Based Model
(FDBM) developed for High-Resolution Atomic Force Microscopy (HRAFM) with
Chen's derivative approximation for tunneling channels, effectively capturing
the contributions of both $\sigma$ and $\pi$ channels, while accounting for the
CO-tip deflection induced by probe-sample interactions. This approach
accurately reproduces the experimental results for both PTCDA/Ag(111) and
1,5,9-trioxo-13-azatriangulene (TOAT)/Cu(111) systems, including intricate
tip-sample distance-dependent features. Furthermore, we also demonstrate the
important role of substrate-induced effects, which can modify molecular orbital
occupation and the relaxation of the CO probe, resulting in distinct BRSTM
image characteristics.

Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are optically addressable spin
defects with great potential for nanoscale quantum sensing. A key application
of NV centers is the detection of external spins at the diamond surface. Among
metals, platinum thin films - widely used in spintronics, catalysis and
electrochemistry - provide a particularly interesting system for such studies.
However, the interaction between NV centers and metals is known to affect their
quantum sensing capabilities. In this work, we study five platinum-covered
diamond samples containing shallow NVs created via nitrogen implantation with
different energies (2.5-60 keV) and investigate the optical and quantum
properties of NV ensembles beneath the metal films. We find a substantial
reduction of the photoluminescence lifetime and a pronounced decrease of the
NV$^{-}$ population for NV ensembles located near the platinum layer. As a
result, optically detected magnetic resonance experiments could only be
efficiently performed on diamonds implanted with at least 20 keV, where we
observed a strong increase in the T$_{2}$ coherence time beneath the platinum
thin films. Our study describes the various processes affecting NV centers near
platinum films and provides guidance for the integration of thin metal films
with near-surface NV centers.

### Superconductivity in monolayer-trilayer phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressure

- **TL;DR**: 在高压下合成的La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$单层-三层混合相（1313相）表现出3.6K的超导转变，远低于双层相的80K超导转变温度，表明层间耦合性质和双层NiO$_6$结构单元是决定RP镍酸盐高温超导的关键因素。

The discovery of 80 K superconductivity in pressurized bilayer
Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has established a new
high-temperature superconductor family. The quest to understand the governing
principles of RP nickelate superconductivity has become a central focus in
condensed matter physics. Here, we report a critical advance by synthesizing
and investigating a distinct structural polymorph of the same compound: the
monolayer-trilayer (1313) hybrid phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Under high
pressure, synchrotron X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy reveal a
structural transition from the orthorhombic $Cmmm$ to the tetragonal $P4/mmm$
space group at 13~GPa. Above 19 GPa, the phase exhibits a clear superconducting
transition, confirmed by a zero-resistance state, albeit at a significantly
reduced temperature of 3.6 K. The stark contrast with the 80 K transition in
the bilayer phase provides a uniquely clean experimental comparison. Our
results demonstrate that the superconducting transition temperature is directly
governed by the nature of the interlayer coupling, and the bilayer NiO$_6$
block as the essential structural motif for achieving high-$T_\text{c}$
superconductivity in the RP nickelates.

### The anisotropic Heisenberg model close to the Ising limit: triangular lattice vs. effective models

Stimulated by recent experiments on materials representing the realization of
the anisotropic Heisenberg spin-$1/2$ model on the triangular lattice, we
explore further properties of such a model in the easy-axis regime $\alpha =
J_\perp/J_z &lt; 1$, as well as effective models that also capture such physics.
We show that anisotropic Heisenberg models on the honeycomb lattice and even on
the square lattice reveal similarities to the full triangular lattice in the
magnetization curve as well as in the transverse magnetization (superfluid)
order parameter $m_\perp$ at finite fields. Still, at $\alpha \ll 1$, results
reveal gapless excitations and small but finite $m_\perp &gt;0 $ at effective
fields corresponding to the triangular case without the field. In contrast,
several additional numerical studies of the full model on the triangular
lattice confirm the existence of the gap at $\alpha \ll 1$. In particular, the
magnetization curve $m(h)$ as well as the spin stiffness $\rho_s$ indicate (at
zero field) a transition/crossover from gapped to gapless regime at $\alpha
\sim \alpha^*$ with $\alpha^* \lesssim 0.5$. We also show that deviations from
the linear spin-wave theory and the emergence of the gap can be traced back to
the strong effective repulsion between magnon excitations, having similarity to
strongly correlated systems.

- **TL;DR**: 本文扩展了2023年Na⁺离子在液氦液滴中溶剂化动力学的研究，将实验扩展到Li⁺和K⁺离子，测量了它们的溶剂化速率和能量耗散特性。

In 2023, ultrafast pump-probe spectrocopy was used to record the solvation
dynamics of a single Na$^+$ ion in a liquid helium droplet, atom-by-atom and
with femtosecond time resolution [Albrechtsen \textit{et al., Nature}, 2023,
\textbf{623}, 319]. Subsequently, theoretical studies showed that other alkali
ions solvate in a similar manner but no experimental results were reported so
far. Here, we extend the previous measurement on Na$^+$ to Li$^+$ and K$^+$
ions. A pump pulse selectively ionizes an alkali atom, initially residing at
the droplet surface, and the ensuing solvation dynamics of the formed alkali
cation, Ak$^+$, is followed by ionizing a Xe atom, located in the droplet
interior, and recording the yields of Ak$^+$He$_n$ ions expelled from the
droplet as a function of the pump-probe pulse delay. We find that Li$^+$,
Na$^+$ and K$^+$ ions solvate with a binding rate of 1.8 $\pm$ 0.1, 1.8 $\pm$
0.1 and 1.7 $\pm$ 0.1 He per ps, respectively. Furthermore, by comparing the
number distribution of the Ak$^+$He$_n$ ion yields to the evaporation energies
of these ion--He complexes, obtained by Path Integral Monte Carlo calculations,
we identify signatures of the first solvation shells of Li$^+$, Na$^+$ and
K$^+$. Lastly, we determine the time-dependent dissipation of the solvation
energy from the vicinity of the three alkali ion species and find that the rate
is highest (lowest) for Li$^+$ (K$^+$)

We report on the synthesis and spectroscopic characterization of
Sm$^{3+}$-doped K$_2$YF$_5$ microparticles. The particles were synthesized via
the hydrothermal technique, yielding a particle size of approximately 20 $\mu$m
in length. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD)
analyses confirmed their orthorhombic crystal structure. A combination of
absorption and laser excited fluorescence performed on samples cooled to 10~K,
allow for the determination of {56} experimental crystal-field levels. A
parametrised crystal-field analysis for Sm$^{3+}$ in the C$_{\rm s}$ point
group symmetry centres of K$_2$YF$_5$ yields good approximation to the data.

We prove that an effective temperature naturally emerges from the algorithmic
structure of a regular universal Turing machine (UTM), without introducing any
external physical parameter. In particular, the redundancy growth of the
machine's wrapper language induces a Boltzmann--like exponential weighting over
program lengths, yielding a canonical ensemble interpretation of algorithmic
probability. This establishes a formal bridge between algorithmic information
theory and statistical mechanics, in which the adopted UTM determines the
intrinsic ``algorithmic temperature.'' We further show that this temperature
approaches its maximal limit under the universal mixture (Solomonoff
distribution), and discuss its epistemic meaning as the resolution level of an
observer.

### Topological Robustness of Anyon Tunneling at $ν= 1/3$

The scaling exponent $g$ of the quasiparticle propagator for incompressible
fractional quantum Hall states in the Laughlin sequence is expected to be
robust against perturbations that do not close the gap. Here we probe the
topological robustness of the chiral Luttinger liquid at the boundary of the
$\nu=1/3$ state by measuring the tunneling conductance between
counterpropagating edge modes as a function of quantum point contact
transmission. We demonstrate that for transmission $t\geq 0.7$ the tunneling
conductance is well-described by the first two terms of a perturbative series
expansion corresponding to $g=1/3$. We further demonstrate that the measured
scaling exponent is robustly pinned to $g=1/3$ across the plateau, only
deviating as the bulk state becomes compressible. Finally we examine the impact
of weak disorder on the scaling exponent, finding it insensitive. These
measurements firmly establish the topological robustness of anyon tunneling at
$\nu=1/3$ and substantiate the chiral Luttinger liquid description of the edge
mode.

Systematically controlling the superconducting transition temperature
($T_\text{c}$) in the bilayer Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$
remains a significant challenge. Here, we address this by synthesizing
high-quality polycrystalline La$_{3-x}$Nd$_x$Ni$_2$O$_7$ ($0 \leq x \leq 2.4$)
with record-level rare-earth substitution. Nd doping compresses the lattice,
particularly along the $c$ axis, enhances the spin density wave transition
temperature, and elevates the pressure required for the
orthorhombic-to-tetragonal structural transition. Superconductivity is observed
across all doping levels under high pressures, with the onset $T_\text{c}$
rising to $\sim$93~K for $x = 2.1$ and $2.4$ from the electronic transport
measurement. Using the radio-frequency transmission technique, newly applied to
nickelate superconductors, we detect signatures of superconductivity at $98 \pm
2$~K in the $x=2.4$ compound, pushing the $T_\text{c}$ frontier further. We
identify a universal linear relationship where $T_\text{c}$ decreases with the
$c$-axis lattice parameter at a rate of approximately $-28$~K/\AA,
demonstrating that enhanced interlayer magnetic exchange coupling is the
dominant mechanism for superconducting pairing. Our work establishes the
critical role of magnetism and provides a unified structural descriptor for
elevating $T_\text{c}$ in bilayer nickelates.

Quantum magnets offer a unique platform for exploring exotic quantum phases
and quantum phase transitions through external magnetic fields. A prominent
example is the field-induced Bose--Einstein condensation (BEC) of magnons near
the saturation field. While this behavior has been observed in low-spin
systems, its realization in high-spin, quasi-two-dimensional magnets -- where
multiple on-site excitations are possible -- remains exceptionally rare. Here,
we report thermodynamic and density functional theory results on single
crystals of the honeycomb-lattice antiferromagnet K$_{4}$MnMo$_{4}$O$_{15}$
with $S = 5/2$. The system undergoes a field-induced transition to a fully
polarized state at the critical field $\mu_{0}H_{\rm s} = 6.4$~T. Our results
reveal possible thermodynamic signatures of magnon BEC, $T_{\mathrm{N}} \sim
(H_{\rm s} - H)^{2/d}$ ($d = 3$), expanding the purview of BEC-driven quantum
criticality to a high-spin, quasi-two-dimensional antiferromagnets with
negligibly small anisotropy.

### Kinetic modelling of the CO2 capture and utilisation on NiRu-Ca/Al dual function material via parameter estimation

This study presents a detailed, open-source kinetic modelling computational
framework for CO2 capture and utilisation using a newly formulated
dual-function material (DFM) comprising 15 wt% Ni, 1 wt% Ru, and 10 wt% CaO
supported on spherical alumina. A finite difference reactor model was developed
to simulate the cyclic adsorption, purge, and hydrogenation stages. The model
incorporates experimentally-derived rate expressions, accounts for system delay
via a second-order response function, and was fitted to time-resolved
concentration laboratory data using Bayesian optimisation. A combined parameter
estimation strategy was employed to ensure mass continuity across stages and
improve the robustness of purge kinetics. The kinetic parameters extracted
reveal that carbonate decomposition, not methanation, is the rate-limiting step
during hydrogenation. Temperature-dependent simulations confirm a trade-off
between reaction kinetics and CO2 storage capacity, with methane yield
maximised at 300C when compared with the other temperature sets. By offering
transparent methodology and reproducible code, this work provides a robust
platform for researchers and practitioners to study, validate, and optimise DFM
systems.

Thermal transport in high-electron-mobility-transistor (HEMT) structures
grown on 4H-SiC substrates by metalorganic-vapour-phase epitaxy (MOCVD) is
systematically investigated. The thermal conductivity of the GaN channel and
AlN buffer layers is measured by thermoreflectance (TTR). A pronounced
thickness dependence of thermal conductivity as a result of phonon-boundary
scattering is observed at low temperatures, while this effect becomes
significantly weaker at elevated temperatures. The thermal boundary resistance
(TBR) at the AlN/4H-SiC and GaN/AlN interfaces is also examined, showing a
substantial reduction and eventual saturation with increasing temperature,
indicating elastic phonon transport as the dominant mechanism. Reliable
simulations of the temperature profile across the structures based on the
measured thermal metrics highlight the critical role of TBR in thin-channel
device and the advantage of thicker channel and buffer layers for efficient
heat dissipation in the HEMTs.

### Universal behaviors of the multi-time correlation functions of random processes with renewal: the step noise case (the random velocity of a Lévy walk)

- **TL;DR**: 该研究分析了更新过程的多时间相关函数，发现对于幂律等待时间分布，任何n时间相关函数在长时间下都简化为两时间相关函数，揭示了系统的统计结构具有两时间可约性。

Stochastic processes with renewal properties are powerful tools for modeling
systems where memory effects and long-time correlations play a significant
role. In this work, we study a broad class of renewal processes where a
variable's value changes according to a prescribed Probability Density Function
(PDF), $p(\xi)$, after random waiting times $\theta$. This model is relevant
across many fields, including classical chaos, nonlinear hydrodynamics, quantum
dots, cold atom dynamics, biological motion, foraging, and finance. We derive a
general analytical expression for the $n$-time correlation function by
averaging over process realizations. Our analysis identifies the conditions for
stationarity, aging, and long-range correlations based on the waiting time and
jump distributions. Among the many consequences of our analysis, two new key
results emerge. First, for Poissonian waiting times, the correlation function
quickly approaches that of telegraphic noise. Second, for power-law waiting
times with $\mu&gt;2$, , \emph{any $n$-time correlation function asymptotically
reduces to the two-time correlation evaluated at the earliest and latest time
points}. This second result reveals a universal long-time behavior where the
system's full statistical structure becomes effectively two-time reducible.
Furthermore, if the jump PDF $p(\xi)$ has fat tails, this convergence becomes
independent of the waiting time PDF and is significantly accelerated, requiring
only modest increases in either the number of realizations or the trajectory
lengths. Building upon earlier work that established the universality of the
two-point correlation function (i.e., a unique formal expression depending
solely on the variance of $\xi$ and on the waiting-time PDF), the present study
extends that universality to the full statistical description of a broad class
of renewal-type stochastic processes.

Understanding energy transport at the nanoscale is an open and fundamental
challenge in the molecular sciences with direct implications for the design of
new electronics, computing devices, and materials. While nanoscale energy
transport under steady-state conditions has been studied extensively, there is
much less known about energy transport under time-dependent driving forces,
particularly in the far-from-equilibrium regime. In this work, we use
nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations and stochastic thermodynamics to
investigate energy transport in a well-studied nanoscale system, a molecular
junction, subjected to a time-periodic temperature gradient. The primary
observation is that molecular junctions can exhibit heat transport hysteresis,
a phenomenon in which the heat flux through a system depends not only on the
instantaneous value of a time-dependent temperature bias but also on the
temporal history of that bias. The presented findings illustrate that molecular
junctions can exhibit the specific memory effect, heat transport hysteresis,
that is essential for the design of thermal neuromorphic computers. This work
elucidates a potential pathway toward the realization of such devices.

In many unconventional superconductors, the strange-metal regime is thought
to emerge from quantum criticality, yet in cuprates this link is obscured by
the enigmatic pseudogap. Superconducting infinite-layer nickelates provide a
new arena to test this paradigm but are constrained to thin films, precluding
calorimetry. We use the Seebeck coefficient as a low-temperature proxy for
entropy per carrier and uncover a clear quantum-critical thermodynamic
signature: in La$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_2$ at the onset of $T$-linear resistivity
($x=0.20$), $S/T$ diverges logarithmically upon cooling, $S/T \propto \log T$.
Boltzmann transport based on ARPES-derived band structure reproduces the
high-temperature magnitude and sign of $S/T$ and reveals a threefold mass
renormalization at the Fermi level. To identify the terminating phase, we
analyze Hall data across Nd$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_2$ and show that its temperature
evolution is quantitatively captured by a minimal two-band model in which a
strongly correlated Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ Fermi surface exhibits Planckian
$T$-linear scattering while the rare-earth Nd-$s$ pocket remains
Fermi-liquid-like. Inverting the zero-temperature Hall response reveals a
collapse of the Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ band carrier density from $1+p$ to $p$ holes
across the critical doping, without long-range magnetic order -- mirroring the
cuprate pseudogap transition in cuprates. These results establish a quantum
critical point at the end of a pseudogap-like phase in infinite-layer
nickelates and unify the broader paradigm among correlated superconductors that
strange metal behaviour is intimately linked to quantum criticality.

### Investigation of Cathode Electrolyte Interphase Formation via Coupling Liquid Electrochemical TEM and GC/MS

A deeper understanding of the cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) formation
mechanism is essential to elucidate battery degradation. Here, we combine
Liquid Electrochemical Transmission Electron Microscopy (ec-TEM) with Gas
Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) to monitor CEI evolution in a
realistic electrochemical environment, focusing on electrolyte behavior under
high voltages. The correlation between the electrochemical response, gas and
liquid analysis after cycling, and the observation of deposited species on the
working electrode (WE) reveals the processes governing CEI formation,
stability, and composition. Cycling between 4 and 6 V vs Li leads to dispersed
particles instead of a continuous film. These are partly composed of LiF and an
amorphous phase that prevents dissolution at high potential. When cycled
between 2.5 and 5.5 V, an anodic current peak indicates the formation of a 36
nm amorphous thin film without crystalline LiF, attributed to EC oxidation
producing HF and subsequent LiF at a higher potential. LiF dissolution appears
to follow a two-step pathway: electrolyte oxidation forms soluble
intermediates, which are later reduced at lower potential to yield species
capable of dissolving LiF. These results provide new insights into CEI
formation and dissolution mechanisms, underscoring the need for further studies
across different potential windows and with non carbonate electrolytes to
validate these findings.

We show that the initialization of an ensemble of electrons in the same spin
state in strained n-InGaAs subject to a perpendicular magnetic field triggers
an AC electric current at GHz frequencies. The AC current emerges in the
absence of any driving force and survives until the coherent precession of the
electron spins is lost. The current amplitude increases linearly with both the
spin-orbit coupling strength and the external magnetic field. The generation
mechanism of the observed oscillatory charge motion can be fruitfully described
in terms of the periodic trembling motion of spin-polarized electrons, which is
a solid-state analog to the Zitterbewegung of free Dirac electrons. Our results
demonstrate that the hidden consequence of relativistic quantum mechanics is
realized and can be studied in a rather simple solid-state system at moderate
temperatures. Furthermore, the large amplitude of the AC current at high
magnetic fields enables ultra-fast spin sensitive electric read-out in solids.

We investigate electron pairing in a super clean kagome superconductor
CsV3Sb5 with a residual resistivity ratio (RRR) of 290. By using the
dilution-refrigerator-based scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) at the
Synergetic Extreme Condition User Facility (SECUF), we find that the pairing
gap exhibits chiral 2x2 modulations, and their chirality can be controlled by
magnetic field training. We introduce nonmagnetic impurities to observe the
complete suppression of 2x2 pairing modulations in presence of persistent 2x2
charge order. This nonmagnetic pair-breaking effect provides phase-sensitive
evidence for pair-density-wave (PDW) induced pairing modulations. Our results
support switchable chiral 2x2 PDW in this super clean kagome superconductor.

The stability and performance of halide perovskite photovoltaic devices are
critically limited by progressive defect generation and associated local
non-radiative losses during operation. Self-healing of defects provides a
promising pathway to prolong device functionality, yet the underlying
microscopic mechanisms remain poorly understood, particularly the role of
interfacial chemistry on trap dynamics and healing kinetics. Here, we elucidate
self-healing and defect evolution in triple-cation mixed halide (TCMH)
perovskite films and their device-relevant charge transport layer
heterostructures subjected to photo-induced damage. Using correlation
clustering imaging (CLIM), our recently developed local functional imaging
tool, we map spatiotemporal photoluminescence heterogeneity to track defect
dynamics in pristine and heterostructure films. The defect healing follows
bi-phasic kinetics, with an initial electronic relaxation (tens of minutes) and
a subsequent slower phase (~ hours) associated to ionic and lattice
rearrangement. Most importantly, our results demonstrate that the chemical
nature of charge-transport layers modulates trap activity, healing kinetics,
and halide redistribution, with heterostructures exhibiting faster recovery
than pristine films, a boon for device resilience. These findings provide new
insights into the dynamic interaction between defects, interfaces, and ion
migration, and establish a framework for rational design of durable,
next-generation perovskite optoelectronic devices.

- **TL;DR**: 本文揭示了在远离临界点的稳定系统中，通过多维Kesten过程中非正规特征向量的放大机制，可以产生重尾波动和幂律统计行为，而无需系统达到谱临界状态。

Heavy-tailed fluctuations and power law statistics pervade physics, finance,
and economics, yet their origin is often ascribed to systems poised near
criticality. Here we show that such behavior can emerge far from instability
through a universal mechanism of non-normal eigenvector amplification in
multidimensional Kesten processes $x_{t+1}=A_t x_t+\eta_t$, where $A_t$ are
random interaction matrices and $\eta_t$ represents external inputs, capturing
the evolving interdependence among $N$ coupled components. Even when each
random multiplicative matrix is spectrally stable, non-orthogonal eigenvectors
generate transient growth that renormalizes the Lyapunov exponent and lowers
the tail exponent, producing stationary power laws without eigenvalues crossing
the stability boundary. We derive explicit relations linking the Lyapunov
exponent and the tail index to the statistics of the condition number,
$\gamma\!\sim\!\gamma_0+\ln\kappa$ and
$\alpha\!\sim\!-2\gamma/\sigma_\kappa^2$, confirmed by numerical simulations.
This framework offers a unifying geometric perspective that help interpret
diverse phenomena, including polymer stretching in turbulence, magnetic field
amplification in dynamos, volatility clustering and wealth inequality in
financial systems. Non-normal interactions provide a collective route to
scale-free behavior in globally stable systems, defining a new universality
class where multiplicative feedback and transient amplification generate
critical-like statistics without spectral criticality.

- **TL;DR**: 在压缩应变HgTe层的Weyl半金属中，通过全电子方法在液氦温度下进行热测量，观察到与引力异常相关的大正磁热导，且热导与电导完美符合Wiedemann-Franz定律。

Weyl semimetals, with their unique electronic band structure, have drawn
significant interest for their potential to explore quantum anomalies in
condensed matter systems. In this study, we investigate the large positive
magneto-thermal conductance associated with the gravitational anomaly -- one of
the predicted anomalies -- for a Weyl semimetal based on a compressively
strained HgTe layer. We clearly identify the Weyl regime in our device and
accurately extract the thermal conductance by performing thermometry
measurements at liquid helium temperatures using fully electronic methods. We
observe the anticipated increase in thermal conductance, and it perfectly
matches the electrical conductance according to the Wiedemann-Franz law. This
finding indicates that, despite the unique electronic spectrum of Weyl
semimetals, the mechanism governing heat transport in this system is the same
as that for electrical transport, with no additional violations of conservation
laws.

### Nanoscale surface morphology controls charge storage at stepped Pt-water interfaces

Platinum step edges dominate electrocatalytic activity in fuel cells and
electrolysers, yet their atomistic electrochemical behaviour remains poorly
understood. Here, we employ \textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics under
controlled electrode potentials to model a realistic stepped Pt--water
interface incorporating experimentally observed (111)$\times$(111) and
(111)$\times$(100) edge motifs. This allows us to resolve, for the first time,
the site-specific structure, charge distribution, and electrostatics of the
electric double layer at a nanostructured Pt surface. We find that differential
capacitance near the potential of zero charge (PZC) arises almost entirely from
potential-dependent chemisorption of water on flat (111) terraces. In contrast,
step edges are saturated with chemisorbed water even below the PZC and thus do
not contribute to the capacitance. Instead, edges accumulate excess positive
charge and exhibit a locally elevated electrostatic potential, as revealed by
spatially resolved macroscopic potential profiles. This electrostatic asymmetry
implies a greater barrier for electron accumulation at step sites compared to
terraces, consistent with enhanced charge localisation and reactivity. Finally,
the higher-in-energy d-band centre and sharper projected density of states at
edge atoms further support their role as active, positively charged centres.
Together, these results provide a mechanistic explanation for the observed
experimental shift of the PZC with step density and establish a predictive
framework for understanding and optimising interfacial charging in
nanostructured Pt electrocatalysts.

### The Comparison of Colloidal PbS QD Photoconductors and Hybrid Phototransistors

- **TL;DR**: 比较了相同PbS胶体量子点薄膜的光电导体和混合光电晶体管，发现高响应度对低光检测很重要，并展示了温度激活的负光电流效应可提高带宽和速度

The simplicity in the fabrication of photoconductors makes them a valuable
choice to investigate optoelectronic properties of colloidal quantum dot (cQD)
films. Lateral photoconductors generally require a large size, in the mm2, and
are limited in operation speed due to the presence of trapping sites. In
contrast, hybrid phototransistors are fabricated in the um2 scale and benefit
from such trapping sites, allowing the measurement of low light levels in the
nW/cm2. The question, however, arises whether high responsivity values are
required for the detection of low light levels or the compatible detectivity of
photoconductors is sufficient. Here, we directly compare photoconductors and
hybrid phototransistors with an identical EDT-treated PbS cQD film. We
highlight that a comparable D* is not enough for the purpose of measuring low
light levels, as the resulting photocurrents need to be readily accessible.
Furthermore, we also showcase temperature-activated photocurrent dynamics
resulting in a negative photocurrent (NPC) effect. This NPC simultaneously
improves the frequency bandwidth and photocurrent, enabling operation speeds up
to 100 kHz.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文研究了SU(N)群伴随表示下铁磁体的相结构和热力学，发现了丰富的相变现象，包括顺磁相和两种不同的铁磁相，以及离散共轭对称性的自发破缺。

We derive the phase structure and thermodynamics of ferromagnets consisting
of elementary magnets carrying the adjoint representation of $SU(N)$ and
coupled through two-body quadratic interactions. Such systems have a continuous
$SU(N)$ symmetry as well as a discrete conjugation symmetry. We uncover a rich
spectrum of phases and transitions, involving a paramagnetic and two distinct
ferromagnetic phases that can coexist as stable and metastable states in
different combinations over a range of temperatures. The ferromagnetic phases
break $SU(N)$ invariance in various channels, leading to spontaneous
magnetization. Interestingly, the conjugation symmetry also breaks over a range
of temperatures and group ranks $N$, providing a realization of a spontaneously
broken discrete symmetry.

The electromagnetic Green's function is a crucial ingredient for the
theoretical study of modern photonic quantum devices, but is often difficult or
even impossible to calculate directly. We present a numerically efficient
framework for calculating the scattered electromagnetic Green's function of a
multi-cavity system with spatially separated open cavities (with arbitrary
shape, dispersion and loss) and finite retardation times. The framework is
based on a Dyson scattering equation that enables the construction of the
Green's function from the quasinormal modes of the individual resonators within
a few-mode approximation and a finite number of iteration steps without
requiring nested integrals. The approach shows excellent agreement with the
full numerical Green's function for the example of two coupled dipoles located
in the gaps of two metal dimers serving as quasinormal mode cavities, and is
easily extended to arbitrarily large separations and multiple cavities.

### Metalorganic Chemical Vapor Deposition of AlScN Thin Films and AlScN/AlN/GaN Heterostructures

- **TL;DR**: 通过MOCVD方法生长AlScN薄膜，实现了可控的钪掺杂，并在AlScN/AlN/GaN异质结构中观察到2DEG形成，展示了其在HEMT器件中的应用潜力。

AlScN thin films were grown via metalorganic chemical vapor deposition
(MOCVD), showing controllable incorporation of scandium (Sc) into the AlN
lattices. Systematic variation of growth parameters demonstrated an obvious
influence on Sc incorporation, with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
analysis indicating Sc composition up to $\sim$13\% when (MCp)$_2$ScCl was used
as the precursor. AlScN/AlN/GaN heterostructures grown on GaN templates
exhibited the formation of a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) channel at the
AlScN/AlN--GaN interface, confirming their potential use in high electron
mobility transistor (HEMT) device technologies. Variation in AlScN/AlN barrier
thickness within the heterostructures showed that thicker barriers yield higher
sheet charge densities from both Hall and capacitance-voltage (C--V)
measurements. With an AlScN/AlN barrier thickness of $\sim$30~nm, a sheet
charge density of $5.22\times10^{12}$~cm$^{-2}$ was extracted from C--V.
High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (S/TEM) further
confirmed Sc incorporation and revealed the wurtzite crystalline structure of
the films and heterostructures. These results establish MOCVD growth of AlScN
as a promising and compatible material for advancing III-nitride
heterostructures in high-performance electronics and potentially
ferroelectrics.

### Origin of Enhanced Thermal Resistance Near Nanoscale Hotspots: Insights from Full-Dispersion-Resolved Phonon Transport in Silicon

- **TL;DR**: 研究发现纳米热点附近热阻增强的主要原因是长平均自由程声子的低比热容，而非其长平均自由程本身。这些声子容易被加热，在热点附近产生更陡的温度梯度，从而增加热阻。

Phonon transport near nanoscale hotspots (NHs) critically determines heat
dissipation in advanced electronic devices. The prevailing understanding is
that the enhanced thermal resistance (TR) observed in NHs originates from long
mean free path (MFP) phonons, whose MFPs are much larger than the hotspot size,
thereby limiting their ability to recognize hotspots and transport heat
effectively. In this study, we revisit this problem by employing the Boltzmann
transport equation (BTE) with a full phonon dispersion model (FPDM) to capture
mode-resolved velocities, scattering processes, and nonequilibrium phonon
populations in silicon. The analysis demonstrates that the increase in TR near
NHs is not caused by the long MFP itself but by the low specific heat of
long-MFP phonons that do not scatter directly with optical modes. These phonons
heat readily when energy is supplied, steepening the local temperature gradient
near the NH and thereby enhancing TR. By resolving the spectral contributions
to the phonon transport resistance and temperature gradients, we identify the
critical role of the modal specific heat in nonlocal phonon transport. These
results provide new physical insights into nanoscale thermal management and
highlight the importance of spectral mode resolution in modeling heat
dissipation in electronic devices.

What are the resources that can be leveraged for a thermodynamic device to
exhibit genuine quantum advantage? Typically, the answer to this question is
sought in quantum correlations. In the present work, we show that quantum Otto
engines that operate with nonlinear qubits significantly outperform linear
engines. To this end, we develop a comprehensive thermodynamic description of
nonlinear qubits starting with identifying the proper thermodynamic equilibrium
state. We then show that for ideal cycles as well as at maximum power the
efficiency of the nonlinear engine is significantly higher. Interestingly,
nonlinear dynamics can be thought of as an effective description of a
correlated, complex quantum many body system. Hence, our findings corroborate
common wisdom, while at the same time propose a new design of more efficient
quantum engines.

The interplay between moir\'e flat bands originating from different valleys
can give rise to a variety of exotic quantum phases. In this work, we
investigate the electronic properties of twisted mono-bilayer (A-AB) and
mono-trilayer (A-ABA) MoTe$_2$ using first-principles calculations and
continuum models. Unlike previous studies on twisted bilayer systems, in which
low-energy flat bands originate solely from the $K/K'$ valleys, in A-AB and
A-ABA twisted MoTe$_2$ (\tmt) the moir\'e bands at low energies arise from both
the $\Gamma$ and $K/K'$ valleys, with spin Chern numbers $C_s=0$ (for $\Gamma$)
and $C_{\uparrow/\downarrow}=\pm1$ (for $K/K'$), respectively. We show that the
multi-valley moir\'e flat bands are governed by interlayer-hybridization
effects, and that different stacking configurations and thicknesses tune the
relative energy alignment between the $\Gamma$ and $K$ valley moir\'e flat
bands. By constructing valley-resolved continuum models and performing
Wannierization for the low-energy moir\'e bands, we further uncover that the
Berry curvature and quantum metric distributions can be effectively tuned by
the layer number and stacking configuration. Unlike other moir\'e systems,
where only one kind of valley influenced the low energy physics, the
simultaneous appearance of two distinct types of valleys, with different
symmetries, establish A-AB and A-ABA \tmt\ as ideal platforms for studying
layer-controlled multi-valley physics.

Constricting transport through a one-dimensional quantum point contact in the
quantum Hall regime enables gate-tunable selection of the edge modes
propagating between voltage probe electrodes. Here we investigate the quantum
Hall effect in a quantum point contact fabricated on low disorder strained
germanium quantum wells. For increasing magnetic field, we observe Zeeman
spin-split 1D ballistic hole transport evolving to integer quantum Hall states,
with well-defined quantised conductance increasing in multiples of $e^2/h$ down
to the first integer filling factor $\nu=1$. These results establish strained
germanium as a viable platform for complex experiments probing many-body states
and quantum phase transitions.

We consider the asymmetric version of the Popkov-Sch\"{u}tz two-lane lattice
gas with general jump rates, subject to the stationary measure being of product

eigenvalues of the flux Jacobian are degenerate. We compute the second order

the universality classes.

Magnetic topological insulators (MTIs) are among the prominent platforms for
the next generation of high-speed and low-power spintronic devices. However,
unlike their non-magnetic counterparts, where the surface spin-momentum locking
prevents electrons from being scattered by non-magnetic impurities and results
in a dissipationless electronic flow, magnetic impurities in MTIs cause
dissipation by exerting magnetic torque on the electron spin. Decreasing this
resistance is desired to reduce energy consumption and optimize performance of
MTIs in envisaged applications. Here we reveal how electronic backscattering
can be suppressed in a MTI thin film by external magnetic and/or electronic
stimuli, to yield an entirely dissipationless spin-polarized charge transport.
Our findings thus present an effective route to preserve spin coherence and
enhance spin-current functionality in magnetic topological materials,
suggesting design strategies for magneto-electronic and spintronic devices with
strongly reduced energy consumption.

### Temperature and conditions for thermalization after canonical quenches

We consider quenches of a quantum system that is prepared in a canonical
equilibrium state of one Hamiltonian and then evolves unitarily in time under a
different Hamiltonian. Technically, our main result is a systematic expansion
of the pre- and post-quench canonical ensembles in the quench strength. We
first demonstrate how this can be used to predict the system's temperature
after the quench from equilibrium properties at the pre-quench temperature. For
a thermalizing post-quench system, it furthermore allows us to calculate
equilibrium observable expectation values. Finally, in the presence of
additional conserved quantities besides the Hamiltonian, we obtain a hierarchy
of necessary conditions for thermalization towards the (post-quench) canonical
ensemble. At first order, these thermalization conditions have a nice geometric
interpretation in operator space with the canonical covariance as a semi-inner
product: The quench operator (difference between post- and pre-quench
Hamiltonians) and the conserved quantity must be orthogonal in the orthogonal
complement of the post-quench Hamiltonian. We illustrate the results
numerically for a variety of setups involving integrable and nonintegrable
models.

Organic surface ligands are integral components of nanocrystals and
nanoparticles that have a strong influence on their physicochemical properties,
their interaction with the environment, and their ability to self-assemble and
order into higher-order structures. These hybrid nanomaterials are tunable with
applications in catalysis, directed self-assembly, next-generation
optoelectronics, and chemical and quantum sensing. Critically, future advances
depend on our ability to rationally engineer their surface chemistry. However,
fundamental knowledge of ligand-nanoparticle behavior is limited by uncertainty
in where and how these ligands bind to surfaces. For nanoparticles, in
particular, few characterization techniques offer both the high spatial
resolution and the precise chemical mapping needed to identify specific ligand
binding sites. In this study, we utilized synchrotron infrared nanospectroscopy
(SINS), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM)
together with first-principles computer simulations to validate the
site-selective adsorption of organic ligands on a shaped nanocrystal surface.
Specifically, we demonstrate that the sterically encumbered isocyanide ligands
(CNAr^{Mes2}) preferentially bind to the high curvature features of Ag
nanocubes (NCs), where low-coordinate Ag atoms are present. In contrast,
isocyanide ligands that do not exhibit these steric properties show no surface
selectivity. SINS serves as an effective tool to validate these surface binding
interactions at the near-single molecule level. These results indicate that
steric effects can be successfully harnessed to design bespoke organic ligands
for fine-tuning nanocrystal surface chemistry and the properties of the
nanocrystal ligand shell.

Antiferromagnetic materials are promising platforms for the development of
ultra-fast spintronics and magnonics due to their robust magnetism,
high-frequency relativistic dynamics, low-loss transport, and the ability to
support topological textures. However, achieving deterministic control over
antiferromagnetic order in thin films is a major challenge, due to the
formation of multi-domain states stabilised by competing magnetic and
destressing interactions. Thus, the successful implementation of
antiferromagnetic materials necessitates careful engineering of their
anisotropy. Here, we demonstrate strain-based robust control over multiple
antiferromagnetic anisotropies and nanoscale domains in the promising
spintronic candidate a-Fe2O3, at room temperature. By applying isotropic and
anisotropic in-plane strains across a broad temperature-strain phase space, we
systematically tune the interplay between magneto-crystalline and
magneto-elastic interactions. We discover that strain-driven control steers the
system towards an aligned antiferromagnetic state, whilst preserving
topological spin textures, such as merons, antimerons and bimerons. We directly
map the nanoscale antiferromagnetic order using linear dichroic scanning
transmission X-ray microscopy integrated with in situ strain and temperature
control. A Landau model and micromagnetic simulations reveal how strain
reshapes the magnetic energy landscape. These findings suggest that strain
could serve as a versatile control mechanism to reconfigure equilibrium or
dynamic antiferromagnetic states on demand in a-Fe2O3, paving the way for
next-generation spintronic and magnonic devices.

Efficient exploration of the vast chemical space is a fundamental challenge
in materials discovery, particularly for designing functional inorganic
crystalline materials with targeted properties. Diffusion-based generative
models have emerged as a powerful route, but most existing approaches require
domain-specific constraints and separate diffusion processes for atom types,
atomic positions, and lattice parameters, adding complexity and limiting
efficiency. Here, we present DiffCrysGen, a fully data-driven, score-based
diffusion model that generates complete crystal structures in a single,
end-to-end diffusion process. This unified framework simplifies the model
architecture and accelerates sampling by two to three orders of magnitude
compared to existing methods without compromising chemical and structural
diversity of the generated materials. In order to demonstrate the efficacy of
DiffCrysGen in generating valid and useful materials, using density functional
theory (DFT), we validate a number of newly generated rare earth-free magnetic

These results establish DiffCrysGen as a general platform for accelerated
functional materials discovery.

- **TL;DR**: 首次在二维极限下实验实现了反铁磁性，在CrSb/Bi2Te3异质结中观察到厚度驱动的从亚铁磁态到反铁磁态的转变。

Altermagnets constitute an emerging class of collinear magnets that exhibit
zero net magnetization yet host spin-split electronic bands arising from
non-relativistic spin-space-group symmetries. Realization of altermagnetism in
the two-dimensional (2D) limit remains an outstanding challenge because
dimensional reduction suppresses kZ dispersion and destabilizes the symmetry
operations essential for spin compensation. Here, we demonstrate genuine 2D
altermagnetism in epitaxial unit-cell-thin films of CrSb grown on Bi2Te3. It
reveals a thickness-driven transition from a ferrimagnetic state in 1-unit-cell
films to an altermagnetic state above a critical thickness of 7/4 unit cell.
The transition originates from interfacial symmetry breaking at the
Cr-terminated layer that induces local moment imbalance. With increasing
thickness the key spin-space-group symmetries [C2||C6Zt] and [C2||MZ] restores,
which leads to altermagnetism with zero net magnetization and
momentum-dependent spin splitting. Our results provide the first experimental
realization of altermagnetism in the 2D regime and establish a route for
integrating stray-field-free spin order into nanoscale spintronic
architectures.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究通过第一性原理计算，探索了在二维vdW磁性材料CrPS₄中插入锂离子和有机TBA⁺离子对其电子和磁性的调控作用。

Two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) magnetic materials are versatile
platforms for tailoring electronic and magnetic properties, in which the
insertion of chemical species into their interlayer gaps offers a powerful
route to engineer magnetism. Here, we focus on the A-type antiferromagnetic
semiconductor CrPS$_4$ (T$_N$ = 38 K) and investigate its electronic and
magnetic properties upon intercalation of lithium (Li$^+$) and organic
tetrabutylammonium (TBA$^+$) ions using first-principles calculations. Our
results show that Li$^+$ incorporation induces a semiconductor-to-metal
transition in CrPS$_4$ and selectively modifies its magnetic behaviour:
switching from out-of-plane to in-plane antiferromagnetism, followed by an
in-plane ferromagnetic ground state at higher intercalation levels. This is
accompanied by a continuous increase of the ordering temperature, reaching a
fivefold enhancement for Li$_{0.5}$CrPS$_4$. Similarly, TBA$^+$ intercalation
expands the vdW gap, decoupling CrPS$_4$ layers and stabilising in-plane
ferromagnetism with a T$_C$ above 100 K. Furthermore, it also modifies magnon
propagation, leading to enhanced group velocities and a more isotropic magnon
transport. This work highlights intercalation as a powerful and versatile
approach for controlling magnetic behaviour and spin dynamics, paving the way
for the design of tunable 2D layered magnetic materials for spintronic and
magnonic applications.

- **TL;DR**: 研究有机-无机异质结构中H2Pc分子对MoS2和WS2单层的影响，发现尽管能带排列相似，但两种异质结构表现出显著不同的光学特性。

Organic - inorganic heterostructures (HS) combine the strong light absorption
and exciton generation capabilities of organic molecules with the unique
excitonic properties of layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), where
the interfacial band alignment dictates the optical response. In this work, we
investigate the influence of H2Pc molecules on CVD-grown MoS2 and WS2
monolayers using correlative microscopy techniques - Kelvin probe force
microscopy (KPFM), photoluminescence (PL), and Raman spectroscopy.
Comprehensive analysis of both electronic and optical properties provides
detailed insights into the energy band alignment in these two HS. Despite their
similar band alignments, the heterostructures exhibit strikingly different
optical signatures. In the case of H2Pc/MoS2 HS, the effect of defect healing
is more pronounced, while for the H2Pc/WS2 HS, strong indications of F\"orster
energy transfer are observed. These findings highlight the critical role of
transition dipole moment in addition to spectral overlap between donor emission
and acceptor absorption in the design of optoelectronic devices.

High-performance, low-power transistors are core components of advanced
integrated circuits, and the ultimate limitation of Moore's law has made the
search for new alternative pathways an urgent priority. Two-dimensional (2D)
materials have become the most promising exploration target due to their
exceptional electronic properties and scalability. In this work, we conducted
device transport research on the previously proposed 2D quaternary
semiconductor Na2LiAlP2 using the non-equilibrium Green's function method. The
results demonstrate that even with a channel length of 5.7 nm, Na2LiAlP2 still
exhibits excellent n-type transistor characteristics, fully meeting and
surpassing the technical specifications outlined in the International Roadmap
for Devices and Systems (IRDS). Encouragingly, the device can easily achieve
the required on-state current of 900 {\mu}A/{\mu}m under low operating voltages
of 0.1 V and 0.2 V. Moreover, at 0.1 V operating voltage, the device's
subthreshold swing breaks through the theoretical limit of 60 mV/dec, reaching
an astonishing value 30.33 mV/dec. Additionally, its p-type transistor
performance also stands out with a subthreshold swing of ~50 mV/dec when the
channel length is 7.9 nm. Our research not only showcases the exceptional
transistor properties of Na2LiAlP2 but also further expands the research scope
of 2D high-performance transistors.

Altermagnets, a novel class of collinear magnetic materials, exhibit unique
spin-split band structures, yet topological insulating states in intrinsic
altermagnetic systems are rare. Here, we identify monolayer Fe$_2X_2$O ($X$ =
Cl, Br, I) as a new family of 2D altermagnetic real Chern insulators. These
materials display robust $d$-wave altermagnetic ordering, semiconducting band
gaps, and nontrivial real Chern numbers per spin channel, yielding
spin-polarized topological corner modes. They also feature spin-polarized
valleys with strong altermagnetism-valley-spin-lattice coupling, enabling
valley-selective excitation via linear dichroism and strain-induced valley
polarization. In multiferroic Fe$_2$Cl$_2$O, magnetism coexists with
ferroelasticity, and an applied strain can switche the N\'eel vector. These
findings position 2D iron oxyhalides as a promising platform for exploring
altermagnetism and magnetic topological states for spintronics and
valleytronics.

### Anharmonic Effects in Ge2Sb2Te5 and Consequences on Thermodynamic Stability

Chalcogenide materials are an important class of phase change material (PCMs)
owing to their employment in digital memory solutions. Chalgogenide materials
have applications in phase change random access memory (PCRAM) due to their
ability to reversibly cycle between crystalline and amorphous states, and of
these materials Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST) is of particular interest due to its speed,
stability and low crystallisation temperatures. GST possesses two stable
crystalline polymorphs, cubic and hexagonal (trigonal system). Studies show
that phenomena such as heat transport and thermal lattice expansion drive the
phase-change nature of these materials. These phenomena are not incorporated in
the harmonic approximation, which is a popular model for describing vibrations
in solids. Through ab initio density functional theory (DFT), we
computationally investigate the anharmonic behaviour of pristine GST, without
vacancies or defects, while considering the various stacking models that exist
and inclusion of van der Waals (vdW) interactions in our modelling. We present
the vibrational analysis of different stacking models in GST; Petrov and
Kooi-De Hosson (KDH) models and the quantification anharmonic behaviour. Our
results demonstrate the importance of incorporating anharmonic and dispersion
effects when modelling GST, especially in the choice of stacking models, along
with implications for phenomena relating to phase-change behaviour.

### Escape-Induced Temporally Correlated Noise Driven Universality Crossover

Universal behavior in far-from-equilibrium systems is driven by interactions
between transport processes and noise structure. The Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ)
framework predicts that extensions incorporating conserved currents or
temporally correlated noise give rise to distinct growth morphologies and
universality classes, yet direct experimental realization has remained elusive.
Here, we report atomically resolved Sn thin-film growth on Sb-doped
MnBi$_2$Te$_4$, revealing a sharp dynamical crossover between two fundamentally
different regimes. Early stage growth follows conserved KPZ scaling, forming
two-dimensional islands and stanene layers. Beyond a critical deposition time,
temporally correlated noise dominates, driving the nucleation of $\alpha$ -Sn
clusters, their evolution into faceted grains, and coexistence with faceted
$\beta$-Sn. Molecular dynamics simulation and Auger electron spectroscopy show
adatom escape as the microscopic origin of temporally correlated noise,
providing a microscopic mechanism for the universality crossover. These
findings establish, for the first time, that temporal noise correlations can
fundamentally alter the scaling class of a growing interface, linking atomistic
kinetics to emergent universal behavior.

Atomic-scale crystal defects in Si are quantum-light sources offering
tantalizing integration with existing photonic technologies. Yet, the
controlled creation of near-infrared color centers for long- haul quantum
communication and information still remains a challenge. In this work, we
utilize light ions, such as H+ and He+, to gently generate quantum emitters in
a crystalline Si matrix. Temperature-dependent photoluminescence measurements
demonstrate the presence of optically-active defects, whose fluorescence
matches the primary telecom window around 1550 nm. In addition, time-resolved
investigations unveil long-lived excitonic states in the {\mu}s regime, thus
confirming the formation of interstitial oxygen-carbon complexes, termed
C-centers. Finally, we explored controlled ion irradiation strategies to
seamlessly generate C-centers also in Ge-on-Si heterostructures, which offer an
advanced technological platform for the future realization of integrated
quantum photonics. This analysis, informed by practical color center synthesis
and proof-of-principle experiments in epitaxial architectures, indicates
intriguing prospects and profitable strategies to advance the burgeoning field
of light-based quantum technologies.

### Oxygen-vacancy-induced Raman softening in the catalyst Fe$_2$(MoO$_4$)$_3$

- **TL;DR**: 通过DFT计算揭示了Fe2(MoO4)3催化剂在甲醇氧化脱氢过程中拉曼强度降低的微观机制，发现氧空位导致的氧振动模式变化是主要原因。

Although iron molybdate (Fe$_2$(MoO$_4$)$_3$) has been commercially utilized
for the production of formaldehyde from methanol via oxidative dehydrogenation,
the detailed mechanism during the catalytic process remains unclear. Recent
operando Raman and impedance measurements of the reaction suggested that the
bulk region of Fe$_2$(MoO$_4$)$_3$ acts as a reservoir of oxygen atoms that can
migrate to the surface to participate in catalysis. This conclusion was drawn
from the observed significant reduction in Raman intensity during the catalytic
process which implies the formation of atomic defects. However, the microscopic
origin of this reduction remains to be clarified. In this work, we performed
density functional theory (DFT) calculations to elucidate the origin of the
experimentally observed Raman intensity variation. Our phonon analysis reveals
that oxygen-dominated vibrational modes, with a small Mo contribution, occur
near 782 cm$^{-1}$-the same frequency region where the Raman intensity
reduction was measured. Using an effective frozen-phonon approach, we further
demonstrate that oxygen vibrations are primarily responsible for the decrease
in calculated Raman intensity. Moreover, structural relaxation of
Fe$_2$(MoO$_4$)$_3$ including an oxygen vacancy suggests that oxygen diffusion
from the bulk to the surface should occur without significant alteration of the
local symmetry, consistent with the absence of measurable peak shifts or
broadening in the experimental Raman spectra.
