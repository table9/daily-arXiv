### Adiabatic Elimination in Relativistic Stochastic Mechanics
- **arXiv**: [2510.13053](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13053)  ·  [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13053.pdf)
- **Title (EN)**: Adiabatic Elimination in Relativistic Stochastic Mechanics
- **Authors**: Tao Wang, Yu Shi
- **Categories**: cond-mat.stat-mech, gr-qc
- **TL;DR**: 该论文研究了相对论随机力学中快变量的绝热消除，在运动方程和分布函数中进行分析，并明确推导了相对论修正。引入了一个新的无量纲参数来表征时间尺度，并将绝热消除与路径积分粗粒化方法进行了比较。

We investigate the adiabatic elimination of fast variables in relativistic
stochastic mechanics, which is analyzed in the equation of motion and in the
distribution function, with relativistic corrections explicitly derived. A new
dimensionless parameter is introduced to characterize the timescale. The
adiabatic elimination is also compared with the path integral coarse graining,
which is more general yet computationally demanding.

### Nonequilibrium steady states in bead-spring models: Entropy production and probability distributions

- **Title (EN)**: Nonequilibrium steady states in bead-spring models: Entropy production and probability distributions
- **Authors**: Jetin E Thomas, Ramandeep S. Johal
- **Categories**: cond-mat.stat-mech
- **TL;DR**: 研究非平衡态下由弹簧连接的珠子系统，系统耦合到两个不同温度的恒温浴。推导了单珠子系统在欠阻尼情况下的稳态位置概率分布，使用有效温度技术和数值模拟求解朗之万方程。发现位置边际概率分布与质量无关，还获得了熵产生率。对双珠子系统也进行了理论和数值分析。

We study non-equilibrium models comprising of beads connected by springs. The
system is coupled to two thermal baths kept at different temperatures. We
derive the steady state probability distributions of positions of the bead for
the one-bead system in the underdamped case. We employ the recently proposed
technique of an effective temperature, along with numerical simulations to
solve the Langevin equations and obtain their corresponding probability
distributions. It is observed that the marginal probability distributions in
the position are independent of mass. We also obtain theoretically and
numerically the rate of entropy production for the one-bead system. The
probability distribution of the positions in the two-beads system are obtained
theoretically and numerically, both in the underdamped and overdamped case.
Lastly, we discuss the notion of ergodicity and have tested the convergence of
the time-averaging and the ensemble-averaging protocols.

### Quasi-adiabatic thermal ensemble preparation in the thermodynamic limit

- **TL;DR**: 研究了一种准绝热热过程，用于在热力学极限下制备有限温度系综。该过程将非相互作用系统的热系综逐渐转化为目标相互作用系统，温度由初始态熵的参数控制。在非可积和可积自旋链中分析了该过程。

We investigate a quasi-adiabatic thermal process for preparing
finite-temperature ensembles in the thermodynamic limit. The process gradually
transforms a thermal ensemble of a noninteracting system into that of an
interacting system of interest over a finite operation time, with the
temperature controlled by parameters associated with the entropy of the initial
state. We analyze this process in both nonintegrable and integrable spin chains
with translational invariance. For the nonintegrable case, numerical
simulations show that the thermal properties of local observables are
accurately reproduced with a single parameter in the high temperature regime,
although the operation time increases exponentially with precision. In
contrast, for the integrable transverse-field Ising model, we analytically show
that an extensive number of parameters tied to local conserved quantities is
generally necessary, and that the operation time increases linearly with system
size, diverging in the thermodynamic limit. These results clarify the potential
and limitations of the quasi-adiabatic thermal process for an ensemble
preparation and highlight the role of integrability in determining its
efficiency.

### Stochastic gyration driven by dichotomous noises
- **arXiv**: [2510.13589](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13589)  ·  [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13589.pdf)
- **Title (EN)**: Stochastic gyration driven by dichotomous noises
- **Authors**: Timothée Herbeau, Leonid Pastur, Pascal Viot, Gleb Oshanin
- **Categories**: cond-mat.stat-mech
- **TL;DR**: 本文研究了在双噪声和抛物线势场作用下的粒子随机动力学，这是布朗回转器模型的变体，使用双值噪声替代高斯白噪声，分析了粒子的自发旋转运动和位置概率密度函数的丰富行为。

We consider stochastic dynamics of a particle on a plane in presence of two
noises and
  a confining parabolic potential - an analog of the experimentally-relevant
Brownian Gyrator (BG) model. In contrast to the standard BG model, we suppose
here that the time-evolution of the position components is driven not by
Gaussian white-noises, but by two statistically-independent dichotomous noises.
We calculate analytically the position variances and cross-correlations, as
well as the mean angular momentum, which permits us to establish the conditions
in which a spontaneous rotational motion of the particle around the origin
takes place. We also present a numerical analysis of the mean angular velocity.
  Lastly, we
  calculate analytically some marginal position probability density functions
revealing a remarkably rich behavior that emerges in such a system of two
coupled linear stochastic differential equations. We show that depending on the
values of parameters characterizing noises these distributions approach the
steady-state forms defined on a finite support, having very unusual shapes,
possessing multiple maxima and minima, plateaus and exhibiting a discontinuous
behavior.

### Flat bands in condensed-matter systems -- perspective for magnetism and superconductivity

- **TL;DR**: 本文综述了平带系统中的物理现象，特别是平带铁磁性和平带超导性，这些现象源于非正交Wannier态的特殊希尔伯特空间结构，超越了简单的态密度发散。

There is a recent upsurge of interests in flat bands in condensed-matter
systems and the consequences for magnetism and superconductivity. This article
highlights the physics, where peculiar quantum-mechanical mechanisms for the
physical properties such as flatband ferromagnetism and flatband
superconductivity that arise when the band is not trivially flat but has a
strange Hilbert space with non-orthogonalisable Wannier states, which goes far
beyond just the diverging density of states. Peculiar wavefunctions come from a
quantum-mechanical interference and entanglement. Interesting phenomena become
even remarkable when many-body interactions are introduced, culminating in
flatband superconductivity as well as flatband ferromagnetism. Flatband physics
harbours a very wide range physics indeed, extending to non-equilibrium physics
in laser illumination, where Floquet states for topologcial superconductivity
is promoted in flatbands. While these are theoretically curious, possible
candidates for the flatband materials are beginning to emerge, which is also
described. These provide a wide and promising outlook.

### The Kitaev-AKLT model
- **arXiv**: [2510.12880](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12880)  ·  [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12880.pdf)
- **Title (EN)**: The Kitaev-AKLT model
- **Authors**: Alwyn Jose Raja, R. Ganesh
- **Categories**: cond-mat.str-el
- **TL;DR**: 提出了一个受AKLT模型启发的自旋1链的精确可解模型，该模型具有Kitaev型耦合，包含双线性和双二次项。在精确可解点，哈密顿量可表示为投影算子的和，产生指数级简并的基态，可用矩阵乘积态表示。

Inspired by the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) model, we present exact
solutions for a spin-1 chain with Kitaev-like couplings. We consider an
expanded Kitaev model with bilinear and biquadratic terms. At an exactly
solvable point, the Hamiltonian can be reexpressed as a sum of projection
operators. Unlike the AKLT model where projectors act on total spin, we project
onto components of spin along the bond direction. This leads to exponential
ground state degeneracy, expressed in terms of fractionalized
spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ objects. Each ground state can be expressed concisely as a
matrix product state. We construct a phase diagram by varying the relative
strength of bilinear and biquadratic terms. The fractionalized states provide a
qualitative picture for the spin-1 Kitaev model, yielding approximate forms for
the ground state and low-lying excitations.

### Dynamical breaking of inversion symmetry and strong second harmonic generation with nonlinear phonons

- **TL;DR**: 本文展示了光学声子如何通过非线性效应动态破坏晶体反演对称性，产生二次谐波和信号整流效应。

We show how crystalline inversion symmetry can be dynamically broken by
optical phonons with generic, hardening Kerr-like non-linearities. The
symmetry-broken state is reached through a parametric instability that can be
accessed by driving close to half the phonon resonance. After the onset of the
instability, the system settles to a steady state with inversion-symmetry
breaking phonon trajectories and strong second harmonic generation. The time
averaged positions of the atoms are displaced relative to equilibrium in the
steady state, resulting in a rectification of the driving signal.

### Emergent spin Hall quantization and high-order van Hove singularities in square-octagonal MA$_2$Z$_4$
- **arXiv**: [2510.12935](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12935)  ·  [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12935.pdf)
- **Title (EN)**: Emergent spin Hall quantization and high-order van Hove singularities in square-octagonal MA$_2$Z$_4$
- **Authors**: Rahul Verma, Yash Vardhan, Hsin Lin, Bahadur Singh
- **Categories**: cond-mat.mtrl-sci
- **TL;DR**: 预测了一类七层方-八角MA2Z4异构体，具有鲁棒的大能隙量子自旋霍尔相和本征高阶范霍夫奇点，可实现量子化的自旋霍尔电导和相关拓扑相。

Quantum spin Hall (QSH) insulators are versatile platforms for exploring
exotic quantum phases, especially when combined with high-order van Hove
singularities (VHSs) that enhance electron correlations. However, perfect spin
Hall quantization is often hindered by spin mixing from strong spin-orbit
coupling, and the emergence of such VHSs is highly sensitive to
material-specific electronic structures. Here, we predict a class of
seven-layered square-octagonal MA$_2$Z$_4$ (M = Mo/W, A = Si/Ge, Z = Pnictogen)
isomers that host a robust, large-gap QSH phase with nearly quantized spin Hall
conductivity and intrinsic high-order VHSs. Topological and symmetry analyses
reveal that compounds with Z = P, As, and Sb are $\mathbb{Z}_2$ nontrivial with
spin Chern number $C_s = 1$ and support $S_z$-polarized edge states, while
those with Z = N are trivial insulators. The QSH phase features an
$S_z$-conserving spin Hamiltonian consistent with an emergent spin
$\mathrm{U}(1)$ quasi-symmetry, yielding spin Hall conductivity $\sim 2e^2/h$.
Notably, MA$_2$(As, Sb)$_4$ compounds exhibit quasi-flat bands near the Fermi
level in the inverted regime, with WSi$_2$Sb$_4$ additionally hosting four
high-order VHSs at generic momentum points. These results position
square-octagonal MA$_2$Z$_4$ materials as robust QSH insulators for realizing
quantized spin Hall conductivity and correlated topological phases, including
fractionalized states and possibly non-Abelian anyons.

### Dependence of Microstructure Classification Accuracy on Crystallographic Data Representation

- **TL;DR**: 该论文研究了在卷积神经网络中表示晶体学取向的最佳方法，比较了四种取向表示方式对材料微观结构分类准确性的影响。

Convolutional neural networks are increasingly being used to analyze and
classify material microstructures, motivated by the possibility that they will
be able to identify relevant microstructural features more efficiently and
impartially than human experts. While up to now convolutional neural networks
have mostly been applied to light optimal microscopy and scanning electron
microscope micrographs, application to EBSD micrographs will be increasingly
common as rational design generates materials with unknown textures and phase
compositions. This raises the question of how crystallographic orientation
should be represented in such a convolutional neural network, and whether this
choice has a significant effect on the network's analysis and classification
accuracy. Four representations of orientation information are examined and are
used with convolutional neural networks to classify five synthetic
microstructures with varying textures and grain geometries. Of these, a
spectral embedding of crystallographic orientations in a space that respects
the crystallographic symmetries performs by far the best, even when the network
is trained on small volumes of data such as could be accessible by practical
experiments.

### Data-Augmented Machine Learning for Predicting Biomass-Derived Hard Carbon Anode Performance in Sodium-Ion Batteries

- **TL;DR**: 本研究使用机器学习方法预测生物质硬碳的钠离子电池性能，通过数据增强技术提高模型在有限数据条件下的鲁棒性，并识别出碳化温度是最重要的影响因素。

Biomass-derived hard carbon has become the most promising anode material for
sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to its high capacity and excellent cycling
stability. However, the effects of synthesis parameters and structural features
on hard carbon's (HC) electrochemical performance are still unclear, requiring
time-consuming and resource-intensive experimental investigations. Machine
learning (ML) offers a promising solution by training on large datasets to
predict hard carbon performance more efficiently, saving time and resources. In
this study, four ML models were used to predict the capacity and initial
Coulombic efficiency (ICE) of HC. Data augmentation based on the TabPFN
technique was employed to improve model robustness under limited data
conditions, and the relationships between features and electrochemical
performance were examined. Notably, the XGBoost model achieved an R2 of 0.854
and an RMSE of 23.290 mAh g-1 for capacity prediction, and an R2 of 0.868 and
an RMSE of 3.813% for ICE prediction. Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) and
Partial Dependence Plot (PDP) analyses identified carbonization temperature
(Temperature_2) as the most important factor influencing both capacity and ICE.
Furthermore, we used bamboo as the precursor to synthesize four hard carbons
based on the predictive approach. The electrochemical performance of these
samples closely matched our predictions. By leveraging machine-learning
approach, this study provides an efficient framework for accelerating the
screening process of biomass-derived hard carbon candidates.

### Evolution of the superconductivity in pressurized La3-xSmxNi2O7

- **TL;DR**: 研究Sm掺杂对La3Ni2O7超导性能的影响，发现在高压下Sm掺杂能提高超导转变温度Tc至89K，主要通过压缩c轴晶格常数实现。

Motivated by the discovery of superconductivity in bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$
at 80 K and the increased superconducting transition temperature, $T_\text{c}$,
up to 92 K in single crystals of La$_2$SmNi$_2$O$_7$ under pressure, we
systematically study the effect of Sm doping on the superconductivity and
structure of La$_{3-x}$Sm$_x$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (0 $\leq$ x $\leq$ 1.5) under
pressure. Experimental investigations in polycrystalline samples reveal that Sm
doping monotonically decreases the lattice constants $c$ and $a$, thereby
enhancing crystal structure distortion and leading to an evolution of the
metallic ground state in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ to an insulating state in
La$_{1.5}$Sm$_{1.5}$Ni$_2$O$_7$. The maximum onset $T_\text{c}$ in compounds
$x=0.9$ and 1.5 is 89 K, while the pressure that drives the emergence of
superconductivity is higher for higher doping levels. The results suggest that
the enhancement of $T_\text{c}$ in La$_{3-x}$Sm$_x$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is mainly
affected by the compressed $c$ lattice before saturation, and the structure
transition is critical for the emergence of superconductivity. Our experimental
results provide insight into the influence of elemental substitution on
nickelate superconductors, offering a means to increase the transition
temperature further.

### Multi-Q spin-valley order in twisted WSe2

- **TL;DR**: 在3.65°扭曲WSe2中发现了新型多Q磁性态，这些态是120°自旋-谷反铁磁体的连续变形，晶胞扩大了四倍。

We report on a study of the interacting phase diagram of $3.65^\circ$-twisted
WSe$_2$ at moir\'e hole filling $\nu=1$, in which we find previously-overlooked
types of magnetism. Specifically, in part of the phase diagram we obtain a
magnetic order parameter which modulates in space with four different non-zero
wave vectors, corresponding to the three $M$-points and one $K$-point of the
moir\'e Brillouin zone. These multi-Q orders, which can be coplanar or
non-coplanar, are continuous deformations of the $120^\circ$ spin-valley
anti-ferromagnet (AFM), where the unit cell has expanded by a factor of four.
Interestingly, we find that the multi-Q states are stabilized for
experimentally relevant values of interaction strength and displacement field,
and are accompanied by a softening of the spin fluctuations near the $M$-points
of the moir\'e

### High Stability Mechanical Frequency Sensing beyond the Linear Regime

- **Categories**: cond-mat.mes-hall
- **TL;DR**: 提出一种通过双机械模式操作来规避微机械传感器中振幅-频率转换噪声的实验方法，可在非线性区域实现高稳定性操作

Sensing via a mechanical frequency shift is a powerful measurement tool, and,
therefore, understanding and mitigating frequency noise affecting mechanical
resonators is imperative. Thermomechanical noise fundamentally limits
mechanical frequency stability, and its impact can be reduced with increased
coherent amplitude of mechanical motion. However, large enough actuation places
the resonator in the nonlinear (Duffing) regime, where conversion of amplitude
noise (AM) into frequency noise (FM) can worsen sensor performance. Here, we
present an experimentally straightforward method to evade this amplitude
tradeoff in micromechanical sensors. Combining knowledge of the Duffing
coefficients with readily available amplitude measurements, we avoid AM-FM
conversion. Our approach uses dual-mechanical-mode operation on a tensioned
thin-film resonator to set a baseline thermomechanically-limited stability by
eliminating correlated single-mode frequency drifts. Thus, we cleanly observe
AM-FM conversion at high drive, and reduce it using our method. The resulting
high-stability operation beyond the linear regime contrasts long-standing
perspectives in the field.

### Photostriction-Driven Phase Transition in Layered Chiral NbOX$_2$ Crystals: Electrical-Field-Controlled Enantiomer Selectivity

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种基于光致伸缩驱动相变的两步法，用于在层状手性NbOX2晶体中选择性控制结构对映体，通过光激发诱导相变到高对称态，再用电场选择性稳定特定对映体构型。

Chiral crystals offer an unique platform for controlling structural
handedness through external stimuli. However, the ability to select between
structural enantiomers remains challenging, both theoretically and
experimentally. In this work, we demonstrate a two-step pathway for enantiomer
selectivity in layered chiral NbOX$_2$ (X = Cl, Br, I) crystals based on
photostriction-driven phase transitions. Ab-initio simulations reveal that
optical excitation is capable of inducing a structural phase transition in
NbOX$_2$ from the monoclinic ($C2$) ground state to the higher-symmetry
($C2/m$) structure. In the resulting transient high-symmetry state, an applied
electric field breaks the residual inversion-symmetry degeneracy, selectively
stabilizing one enantiomeric final state configuration over the other. Our
results establish a combined optical-electrical control scheme for chiral
materials, enabling reversible and non-contact enantiomer selection with
potential applications in ultrafast switching, optoelectronics, and chiral
information storage.

### Long-Range Chiral Pairing enables Topological Superconductivity in Triangular Lattices without Spin-Orbit Coupling and Magnetic Field

- **Categories**: physics.comp-ph
- **TL;DR**: 本文展示了在单层三角晶格中通过长程配对实现拓扑超导的途径，无需自旋轨道耦合和磁场，与传统框架形成对比。

This paper demonstrates a pathway to topological superconductivity in
monolayer triangular lattices through long-range pairing without requiring
spin-orbit coupling and magnetic field, contrasting conventional frameworks
reliant on superconductivity and spin-orbit coupling and time-reversal symmetry
(TRS) breaking. Berry curvature analysis reveals spontaneous
TRS-breaking-induced peaks or valleys under long-range pairing, signaling
nontrivial topology superconducting state. Notably, the increase in the
long-range pairing strength only changes the size of the energy band-gap,
without triggering a topological phase transition. This characteristic is
verified by calculating Berry curvature and topological edge states. In zigzag
and armchair-edge ribbons of finite width, the topological edge states are
regulated by the ribbon boundary symmetry and the interact range of long-range
pairing. Under nearest-neighbor pairing, the topological edge states maintain
particle-hole symmetry and matches the corresponding Chern number. However,
next-nearest-neighbor and third-nearest-neighbor pairings break the
particle-hole symmetry of the topological edge states in armchair-edge ribbon.
This work proposes a mechanism for realizing topological superconductivity
without relying on spin-orbit coupling and magnetic field, offering a
theoretical foundation for simplifying the design of topological quantum
devices.

### Quantum Mechanical Analysis of Neutron Wavefunction Overlap and Nuclear Interaction Probability with Carborane Cage ($^{10}$B10) in Boron Neutron Capture Therapy

- **TL;DR**: 该研究提出了一个量子力学框架来评估硼中子俘获治疗(BNCT)中中子与硼-10原子的相互作用概率，通过建模中子波函数和碳硼烷笼中硼原子的空间分布来优化治疗效果。

Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) leverages the nuclear reaction between
thermal neutrons and boron-10 (B-10) atoms to induce selective tumor cell
death. The spatial and quantum mechanical overlap between the neutron
wavefunction and B-10 nuclei encapsulated in carborane cages (C2B10H12) is
fundamental to optimizing therapeutic efficacy. This study presents a quantum
mechanical framework to evaluate the neutron-boron interaction probability by
modeling neutron wavefunctions and the spatial distribution of boron atoms
within the carborane cages. Using spherical harmonics and density functional
theory (DFT)-derived geometries of carborane, the neutron scattering amplitudes
and reaction cross sections are quantitatively analyzed. The implications of
neutron spin states, nuclear magnetic moments, and external perturbations on
the neutron capture probability are discussed. The computed neutron scattering
amplitudes and reaction cross sections provide a basis for evaluating
neutron-boron interaction probabilities under varied quantum conditions. The
proposed model offers theoretical insights into molecular-level design
considerations for enhancing the efficiency of BNCT.

### Exotic Surface Stripe Orders in Correlated Kagome Metal CsCr3Sb5

- **TL;DR**: 在kagome超导体CsCr3Sb5中发现了表面条纹序，与体相不同，通过STM、ARPES和DFT揭示了强关联电子特性和电子-玻色子耦合模式。

The newly discovered kagome superconductor CsCr3Sb5 exhibits distinct
features with flat bands and unique magnetism, providing a compelling platform
for exploring novel quantum states of correlated electron systems. Emergent
charge order in this material is a key for understanding unconventional
superconductivity, but it remains unexplored at the atomic scale and the
underlying physics is elusive. Here, we identify and unreported stripe orders
on the surface which are distinct from the bulk and investigate the underlying
bulk electronic properties using a combination of scanning tunneling microscopy
(STM), angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and density functional
theory (DFT) calculations. Specifically, a mixture of 2a0 * a0 and 3a0 * a0
stripe order is found on Cs-terminated surface while 4a0 * root3a0 stripe order
is found on the Sb-terminated surface. The electronic spectra exhibit strongly
correlated features resembling that of high temperature superconductors, with
kagome flat bands lying about 330 meV above EF, suggesting that the electron
correlations arise from Coulomb interactions and Hund's coupling. Moreover, a
distinct electron-boson coupling mode is observed at approximately 100 meV.
These findings provide new insights into the interplay between surface and bulk
charge orders in this strongly correlated kagome system.

### Spin-Selective Second-Order Topological Insulators Enabling Cornertronics in 2D Altermagnets

Recent progress in spintronics within the paradigm of altermagnets (AMs)
opens new avenues for next-generation electronic device design. Here, we
establish a spin-corner locking mechanism that generates second-order
topological states in two-dimensional (2D) altermagnetic systems, through
effective model analysis. Remarkably, the breaking of Mxy symmetry under
uniaxial strain creates spin-resolved corner modes, driving the system into a
corner-polarized second-order topological insulator (CPSOTI). Beyond critical
strain, a topological phase transition to quantum anomalous Hall insulator
occurs with quantized conductance. Through first-principles calculations, we
identify two experimentally viable candidates for 2D intrinsic AM CrO and
Cr$_2$Se$_2$O -- which host robust CPSOTI. Moreover, we construct the
topological phase diagram of CrO and predict the existence of an altermagnetic
Weyl semimetal phase. Our findings open technological avenues in altermagnetism
and higher-order topology, while providing opportunities for coupling
topological spintronics with cornertronics.

Emergent topological phenomena in multiferroic materials arise from the
intricate coupling between structural, electric, and magnetic order parameters.
Hexagonal manganites provide a paradigmatic platform for such studies. These
compounds exhibit a strongly coupled distortive-improper ferroelectric order,
arising from trimerizing lattice distortions, and a 120{\deg} noncollinear
antiferromagnetic spin structure. While their two-dimensional domain topology
has been extensively studied, the full three-dimensional multiferroic domain
architecture has remained largely unexplored, mainly due to the experimental
challenges of probing bulk structures beyond surfaces. Here, we employ a Landau
free-energy framework combined with large-scale phase-field simulations to
reveal the intricate three-dimensional multiferroic domain network of hexagonal
manganites. We demonstrate that the coupling between the structural and
antiferromagnetic order parameters gives rise to a rich variety of
three-dimensional topological features. In particular, these features give rise
to an attraction between different types of domain walls. Moreover, we identify
bifurcations of vortex-like lines at domain-wall intersections, a phenomenon
that can exist only in three dimensions and fundamentally alters the topology
of the domain network. Our results provide a comprehensive theoretical basis
for understanding three-dimensional domain interactions in multiferroics and
highlight the essential role of dimensionality in coupling improper
ferroelectricity, magnetism, and topology in hexagonal manganites.

- **TL;DR**: GO-Diff是一种基于扩散的全局结构优化方法，可直接采样低能量原子构型，无需先验数据或显式弛豫。

We introduce GO-Diff, a diffusion-based method for global structure
optimization that learns to directly sample low-energy atomic configurations
without requiring prior data or explicit relaxation. GO-Diff is trained from
scratch using a Boltzmann-weighted score-matching loss, leveraging only the
known energy function to guide generation toward thermodynamically favorable
regions. The method operates in a two-stage loop of self-sampling and model
refinement, progressively improving its ability to target low-energy
structures. Compared to traditional optimization pipelines, GO-Diff achieves
competitive results with significantly fewer energy evaluations. Moreover, by
reusing pretrained models across related systems, GO-Diff supports amortized
optimization - enabling faster convergence on new tasks without retraining from
scratch.

### Isomer effects on neutral-loss dissociation channels of nitrogen-substituted PAH dications

- **TL;DR**: 研究两种含氮多环芳烃异构体（喹啉和异喹啉）与氧离子碰撞的碎裂行为，发现HCN损失是主要衰变通道，且氮原子位置影响多体碎裂过程。

We investigate two nitrogen-containing isomers of polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons (PAHs), quinoline (Q) and isoquinoline (IQ), of composition
C$_9$H$_7$N in collisions with 7~keV O$^+$ and 48~keV O$^{6+}$ projectile ions.
Employing ion-ion coincidence mass spectrometry, we determine branching ratios
for H-loss, C$_2$H$_2$-loss, and HCN-loss dissociation channels of Q$^{2+}$ and
IQ$^{2+}$. The overall contribution of HCN-loss is found to be the dominant
decay channel. A comparison with the results of a parallel experiment on
naphthalene, the simplest PAH, reveals that HCN-loss in both isomers has a
higher propensity than the analogous C$_2$H$_2$-loss of naphthalene. The
positional identity of the nitrogen atom in the two isomers mainly manifests in
many-body fragmentation of their dications. Potential energy surfaces of
Q$^{2+}$ and IQ$^{2+}$ are further computed to explore complete fragmentation
mechanisms. Parent dications (Q$^{2+}$ and IQ$^{2+}$) are identified to
isomerize via seven-membered ring structures prior to elimination of C$_2$H$_2$
and HCN. While prompt dissociation is the primary pathway, the dominant channel
of each neutral-loss class also exhibits delayed fragmentation.

Using bulk gapless topological superconductors in both 1d and 2d as free
fermion model examples, we demonstrate the power of subsystem correlation
spectrum (the spectrum of correlation matrix), or equivalently the entanglement
spectrum for the case of free fermions, in characterizing the topology of the
non-trivial ground state. For the systems considered, we show that signatures
of the lowenergy spectrum, including both the edge modes and the bulk modes,
appear in the correlation spectrum, albeit with different behaviors. This work
generalizes the 2d Li-Haldane entanglement spectrum characterization of
topological edge states to 2d topological systems with gapless bulk.

### Polarization dependency in Resonant Inelastic X-Ray Scattering

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一个系统框架来分析RIXS光谱，通过张量表示法将实验几何与材料固有性质分离，显著减少了对称性材料中独立基本光谱的数量。

Resonant Inelastic X-Ray Scattering (RIXS) is a well-established tool for
probing excitations in a wide range of materials. The measured spectra strongly
depend on the scattering geometry, via its influence on the polarization of the
incoming and outgoing light. By employing a tensor representation of the
4-point response function that governs the RIXS intensity, we disentangle the
experimental geometry from the intrinsic material properties. In dipole-dipole
RIXS processes and low-symmetry crystals, up to 81 linearly independent
fundamental spectra can be measured as a function of light polarization.
However, for crystals or molecules with symmetry, the number of independent
fundamental spectra that define the RIXS tensor is significantly reduced.
  This work presents a systematic framework for determining the number of
fundamental spectra and expressing the RIXS tensor in terms of these
fundamental components. Given a specific experimental geometry, the measured
spectrum can be represented as a linear combination of these fundamental
spectra. To validate our approach, we performed calculations for different
point group symmetries, both with and without an applied magnetic field. Within
the same framework, we derived expressions for powder spectra in
momentum-independent processes and spectra obtained using Bragg spectrometers.
This formalism provides a valuable toolkit for optimizing experiment planning,
data interpretation, and RIXS simulation.

### Hybrid light-matter boundaries of graphene in a chiral cavity

Recent advances in chiral cavities that can couple coherently to
two-dimensional materials have opened a powerful route to reshape electronic
topology without an external drive. Here we establish the bulk-boundary
correspondence for graphene embedded in a circularly polarized cavity. By
combining exact diagonalization (ED) of zigzag ribbons, a semi-analytic
T-matrix for half-infinite lattices, and analytical insights from a
Dirac-Jaynes-Cummings model, we show that (i) every light-matter
interaction-induced gap hosts pairs of unidirectional light-matter edge
currents depending on the Chern number of the band while some of them are even
bright; (ii) these chiral states persist throughout the entire photon ladder;
and (iii) their dispersion, localization length and photon distribution exhibit
a universal scaling controlled by the light-matter interaction. Time-evolution
simulations further demonstrate that a dark electronic edge excitation can be
converted into a bright and unidirectionally propagating current, that remains
coherent over long time scales. Our results predict an experimental signature
of the hybrid band topology and a blueprint for reconfigurable chiral channels
in next-generation quantum-optical devices.

### Reciprocal Space Attention for Learning Long-Range Interactions

- **TL;DR**: 提出了Reciprocal-Space Attention (RSA)框架，通过在傅里叶空间中实现线性缩放注意力机制，有效捕获长程相互作用，可作为现有机器学习原子间势能的长程修正。

Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have revolutionized the
modeling of materials and molecules by directly fitting to ab initio data.
However, while these models excel at capturing local and semi-local
interactions, they often prove insufficient when an explicit and efficient
treatment of long-range interactions is required. To address this limitation,
we introduce Reciprocal-Space Attention (RSA), a framework designed to capture
long-range interactions in the Fourier domain. RSA can be integrated with any
existing local or semi-local MLIP framework. The central contribution of this
work is the mapping of a linear-scaling attention mechanism into Fourier space,
enabling the explicit modeling of long-range interactions such as
electrostatics and dispersion without relying on predefined charges or other
empirical assumptions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method as a
long-range correction to the MACE backbone across diverse benchmarks, including
dimer binding curves, dispersion-dominated layered phosphorene exfoliation, and
the molecular dipole density of bulk water. Our results show that RSA
consistently captures long-range physics across a broad range of chemical and
materials systems. The code and datasets for this work is available at

### Rippled Moire Superlattices for Decoupled Ferroelectric Bits

Symmetry considerations suggest that moire superlattices formed by twisted
two-dimensional materials should preserve overall inversion symmetry. However,
experiments consistently report robust ferroelectricity in systems such as
twisted bilayer h-BN, posing a fundamental discrepancy between theory and
experiment regarding its microscopic origin. Here, using large-scale
finite-field molecular dynamics simulations, we challenge the prevailing
defect-pinning hypothesis and instead identify an out-of-plane bending field,
induced by in-plane compressive strain, as the key symmetry-breaking mechanism.
This strain-induced rippling drives spatially heterogeneous interlayer sliding
and distorts the moire domain wall network, resulting in a four-state
ferroelectric system. Remarkably, we show this mechanism can be harnessed at
the nanoscale, where localized nanobubbles designate the moire lattice's
fundamental hexagonal domain clusters as the smallest individually addressable
ferroelectric bits, thereby imposing local control on an otherwise globally
defined structure. Our findings establish a geometry-driven framework for
understanding and engineering moire ferroelectrics, offering not only a route
toward ultra-high-density, rewritable memory, but also a strategy for locally
tuning the moire potential itself, a critical step for manipulating emergent
correlated and topological quantum phases.

Polymers are a versatile class of materials with widespread industrial
applications. Advanced computational tools could revolutionize their design,
but their complex, multi-scale nature poses significant modeling challenges.
Conventional force fields often lack the accuracy and transferability required
to capture the intricate interactions governing polymer behavior. Conversely,
quantum-chemical methods are computationally prohibitive for the large systems
and long timescales required to simulate relevant polymer phenomena. Here, we
overcome these limitations with a machine learning force field (MLFF) approach.
We demonstrate that macroscopic properties for a broad range of polymers can be
predicted ab initio, without fitting to experimental data. Specifically, we
develop a fast and scalable MLFF to accurately predict polymer densities,
outperforming established classical force fields. Our MLFF also captures
second-order phase transitions, enabling the prediction of glass transition
temperatures. To accelerate progress in this domain, we introduce a benchmark
of experimental bulk properties for 130 polymers and an accompanying
quantum-chemical dataset. This work lays the foundation for a fully in silico
design pipeline for next-generation polymeric materials.

### Momentum-Resolved Spectroscopy of Superconductivity with the Quantum Twisting Microscope

We develop a theoretical framework for probing superconductivity with
momentum resolution using the quantum twisting microscope (QTM), a planar
tunneling device where a graphene tip is rotated relative to a two-dimensional
sample. Due to in-plane momentum conservation, the QTM directly measures the
superconducting spectral function along well-defined trajectories in momentum
space. The relative intensities of electron and hole excitations encode the
Bogoliubov coherence factors, revealing the momentum dependence of the pairing
magnitude. Three $C_{3z}$-related tunneling channels enable direct detection of
rotational symmetry breaking, as well as nodal points in the superconducting
order parameter. We apply our framework to superconductivity within the
Bistritzer-MacDonald model of noninteracting electrons and the Topological
Heavy Fermion model, which accounts for electron-electron interactions.
Together, these capabilities establish the QTM as a direct probe of the pairing
symmetry and microscopic origin of superconductivity in two-dimensional
materials.

We consider a lattice model of Twisted Bilayer Graphene (TBG). The presence
of incommensurate angles produces an emerging quasi-periodicity manifesting
itself in large momenta Umklapp interactions that almost connect the Dirac
points. We rigorously establish the stability of the semimetallic phase via a
Renormalization Group analysis combined with number theoretical properties of
irrationals, similar to the ones used in Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) theory
for the stability of invariant tori. The interlayer hopping is weak and short
ranged and the angles are chosen in a large measure set. The result provides a
justification, in the above regime, to the effective continuum description of
TBG in which large momenta interlayer interactions are neglected.

### Magnetically controllable nonlinear valley Hall effect in centrosymmetric ferromagnets

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种在中心对称铁磁体中实现磁控非线性谷霍尔效应的新方法，无需外部应变即可产生自旋极化的谷霍尔电流。

Valley Hall effect is fundamental to valleytronics and provides a promising
avenue for advancing information technology. While conventional valley Hall
effect requires the inversion symmetry breaking, the recently proposed
nonlinear valley Hall (NVH) effect removes the symmetry constraint, and broaden
material choices. However, existing studies are limited to nonmagnetic
materials without spin involvement and rely on external strain to break
rotational symmetry. Here, to address these limitations, we design a
magnetically controllable NVH effect in centrosymmetric ferromagnets, by the
tight-binding model and first-principles calculations. The model calculations
demonstrate nonvanishing NVH conductivities can emerge in pristine hexagonal
lattice without external strain, with the magnitude, sign, and spin
polarization of the conductivities being all dependent on the magnetization
orientation. The effect thus generates various spin-polarized valley Hall
currents, characterized by distinct combinations of current direction and spin
polarization. First-principle results on a ferromagnetic VSi$_2$N$_4$ bilayer
confirm considerable NVH conductivities and their dependence on the
magnetization. The magnetically controllable NVH effect unlocks the potential
of centrosymmetric magnets for valleytronics, and offer opportunities for novel
spintronic and valleytronic devices.

The quest for robust, intrinsically magnetic topological materials exhibiting
the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect is a central challenge in condensed
matter physics and the application of revolutionary electronics. However,
progress has been hampered by the limited number of candidate materials, which
often suffer from poor stability and complex synthesis. Here, we introduce a
new paradigm by exploring the emergent magnetism and nontrivial band topology
in the largely overlooked family of two-dimensional (2D) pentagonal MN$_8$
monolayers. Employing first-principles calculations, we reveal that these
systems host out-of-plane ferromagnetic ground states, a key feature that
unlocks nontrivial topological properties driven by the localized $d$-orbitals
of the embedded transition metals. Remarkably, we identify TiN$_8$ as a QAH
insulator characterized by a Chern number of $C=-1$. Even more strikingly,
MoN$_8$ is predicted to be a rare high-Chern-number QAH insulator, boasting a
Chern number of $C=2$. Our findings establish the penta-MN$_8$ family as a
fertile and versatile platform for realizing exotic topological quantum states.
This work not only significantly expands the material landscape for magnetic
topological insulators but also provides a solid theoretical foundation for
designing next-generation spintronic and quantum computing devices.

This work presents a modeling framework to represent the thermomechanical
behavior of complex materials based on micromechanical dynamics. The framework
is applied to nuclear fuel rod elements composed of Zircaloy-2 cladding tubes
and spacer grids under typical Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) conditions.
Thermal expansion and thermal creep are incorporated through a VPSC-FEM
coupling with the finite element solver Code_Aster, enabling analysis of
in-reactor behavior under combined thermal, mechanical, and irradiation
loading. The model captures anisotropic deformation driven by crystallographic
texture and prismatic slip activity under radial loading. Thermal creep, being
stress-sensitive, contributes to early-stage stress relaxation and strain
accumulation, leading to higher strain compared to the irradiation-only case.
The interaction of thermal creep with irradiation mechanisms modifies the
stress distribution and clearance evolution, with relaxation governed by
prismatic slip. For fuel rod components, irradiation-induced mechanisms
dominate the long-term clearance behavior, whereas thermal effects remain
relevant in contact dynamics during thermal preloading. The stress-strain
response is found to be more sensitive to micromechanical processes than to
elastic constants. This high-resolution formulation enables predictive modeling
of spacer-cladding interaction and provides a foundation for developing
reduced-order models.

### Buckling and flat bands in twisted bilayer graphene

Magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) with its flat bands provides a
rich platform for exploring emergent electronic orders. Similarly, periodically
buckled monolayer graphene has been proposed as a tunable alternative for
realizing flat bands. Here, we investigate the combined effect of buckling and
twisting in bilayer graphene. We find that periodic buckling in large-angle TBG
initially enhances band flattening compared to monolayer graphene, but for
sufficiently strong buckling, it instead increases the band dispersion. This
occurs both because of the presence of interlayer coupling, which reduces the
in-plane kinetic energy, and due to the opening of a gap at the Dirac point
resulting from inversion-symmetry breaking. Additionally, we find that
buckling-induced band flattening competes with twist-induced band flattening.
While the former breaks sublattice symmetry, generating a sublattice
polarization, the latter prefers to preserve it. This prevents buckling from
generating even flatter bands at the magic angle. Nevertheless, we find that
buckled TBG can exhibit flatter bands than pristine TBG over a wide range of
twist angles, with a flatness similar to that of pristine magic-angle TBG.

### Energetic Origins of Competing Deformation Modes in Metastable Titanium Alloys

Metastable alloys, such as $\beta$-phase titanium (Ti) alloys with a
body-centered cubic (BCC) lattice, can exhibit exceptional mechanical
properties through the interplay of multiple deformation mechanisms --
diffusionless phase transformations, deformation twinning, and conventional
dislocation slip. However, understanding how these mechanisms compete or
cooperate across a wide range of metastable alloys and loading conditions
remains a fundamental challenge. Here, we employ molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations to investigate the nucleation behavior of competing deformation
modes in metastable $\beta$-Ti alloys as a function of temperature,
composition, and loading conditions. We reveal that twinning pathways emerge
through reversible transformations between the $\beta$ phase and the
orthorhombic $\alpha"$ phase, in agreement with crystallographic theories.
Quantitative analyses demonstrate that the dominant deformation mechanisms and
preferred twinning-plane orientations are governed by two key energetic
parameters: the free energy barrier for homogeneous $\beta \leftrightarrow
\alpha"$ transformations and the misfit strain energy along specific phase
boundaries. These energetic quantities vary systematically with thermodynamic
and mechanical conditions, thereby rationalizing the deformation mode
transitions observed in both simulations and experiments. These energetic
metrics offer a physically grounded and computationally tractable basis for
designing next-generation metastable alloys.

We studied the surface properties of Ga-Cu based liquid metal alloys, a
promising material system for supported catalytically active liquid metal
solutions (SCALMS). The impact of Cu dilution in the (liquid) Ga matrix is
in-detail investigated by X-ray and UV photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS/UPS) and
Machine-Learned-Force Field (ML-FF) calculations. With decreasing Cu content,
microscopic and macroscopic Ga-Cu model samples exhibit a shift of the Cu 2p
core level line to higher binding energies (Eb) as well as a correspondingly
shifted and narrowed d-band with respect to pure Cu, which we ascribe to site
isolation. To study the property evolution of Ga-Cu at SCALMS reaction
conditions, i.e., where Cu is present in liquid Ga, additional XPS measurements
were performed between 100 and 500 oC. The observed Cu 2p shift to lower Eb is
tentatively ascribed to changes in the local environment with increasing
temperature, i.e. bond elongation, which is corroborated by ML-FF simulations.
The increased Cu surface content at low temperatures is attributed to the
presence of crystallized Cu-rich intermetallic compounds, as evidenced by
transmission electron microscopy images. In an attempt to generalize the
findings for filled d-band transition metals (TMs) in liquid Ga also Ga-Ag and

Inspired by the recent experimental progress in pyrochlore derivative
\ce{RE3Sb3A2O14 (A=Mg, Zn)}, we investigate the Hubbard model on the kagome
lattice with an additional hopping $t'/t$, which enables continuous
interpolation between the kagome and triangular lattices by using determinant
quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We analyze the evolution of magnetic
correlations and thermodynamic responses across different values of $t'/t$ and
on-site interaction $U$. It is found that increasing $t'/t$ suppresses
short-range antiferromagnetic correlations, while the next-nearest-neighbor
correlations exhibit a sign change near $t'/t \approx 0.3 \text{--} 0.4$.
Within this regime, the specific heat shows a pronounced low-temperature peak,
indicating an emergent spin-related energy scale. Increasing $U$ enhances
magnetic correlations and shifts the associated $t'/t$ crossover points to
larger values. We also discuss the sign problem to clarify which parameter
region of our numerical simulations is accessible and reliable. Our results
uncover the competition between frustration and correlations and the interplay
of magnetic and thermodynamic responses in the kagome lattice, providing
insights into correlated states in frustrated materials.

Properties of quantum dot based spin qubits have significant inter-device
variability due to unavoidable presence of various types of disorder in
semiconductor nanostructures. A significant source of this variability is
charge disorder at the semiconductor-oxide interface, which causes
unpredictable, yet, as we show here, correlated fluctuations in such essential
properties of quantum dots like their mutual tunnel couplings, and electronic
confinement energies. This study presents a systematic approach to characterize
and mitigate the effects of such disorder. We utilize finite element modeling
of a Si/SiGe double quantum dot to generate a large statistical ensemble of
devices, simulating the impact of trapped interface charges. This work results
in a predictive statistical model capable of generating realistic artificial
data for training machine learning algorithms. By applying Principal Component
Analysis to this dataset, we identify the dominant modes through which disorder
affects the multi-dimensional parameter space of the device. Our findings show
that the parameter variations are not arbitrary, but are concentrated along a
few principal axes - i.e.there are significant correlations between many
properties of the devices.
  We finally compare that against control modes generated by sweeping the gate
voltages, revealing limitations of the plunger-only control. This work provides
a framework for enhancing the controllability and operational yield of spin
qubit devices, by systematically addressing the nature of electrostatic
disorder that leads to statistical correlations in properties of double quantum
dots.

- **TL;DR**: 开发了两种机器学习势函数来模拟SiO2在高温高压下的相变行为，确定了seifertite和pyrite型SiO2的熔化曲线及相边界，发现SCAN泛函比PBEsol预测更高的熔化温度和相变压力。

Silica (SiO2) is fundamental to both industrial technology and planetary
science, yet the phase relations of its high-pressure polymorphs remain poorly
constrained. Here, we develop two machine learning potentials (MLPs) for SiO2
that faithfully represent the SCAN and PBEsol exchange-correlation functionals
over a wide temperature (1000-10000 K) and pressure (100-400 GPa) range using
deep neural networks. With large-scale two-phase simulations powered by these
potentials, we determine the melting curves of seifertite and pyrite-type SiO2
and infer the solid-solid phase boundary between these two phases. The SCAN
functional, which captures intermediate-range van der Waals interactions,
reproduces structural and thermodynamic properties with high fidelity,
predicting melting temperatures 6-10 % higher and a seifertite to pyrite-type
transition pressure 22 % higher than the PBEsol. The strongly negative
Clapeyron slope (-6.1 MPa/K) of this transition suggests that mantle convection
could be highly layered in super-Earth exoplanets, potentially affecting their
long-term thermal evolution and habitability.

Corrosion mechanism of minerals and glass is a critical study domain in
geology and materials science, vital for comprehending material durability
under various environmental conditions. Despite decades of extensive study, a
core aspect of these mechanisms - specifically, the formation of amorphous
alteration layers upon exposure to aqueous environments - remains
controversial. In this study, the corrosion behavior of a
boro-alumino-phospho-silicate glass (BAPS) was investigated using advanced
solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (SSNMR) and SEM techniques. The results
reveal a uniform nanoscale phase separation into Al-P-rich and Al-Si-rich
domains. During corrosion, the Al-P-rich domain undergoes gelation, whereas the
Al-Si-rich domain remains vitreous, forming a gel layer comprised of both
phases. Although SEM images show a sharp gel/glass interface - suggestive of a
dissolution-precipitation mechanism - the phase coexistence within the gel
layer provides definitive evidence against such a mechanism. Instead, we
propose an in situ transformation mechanism governed by chemical reactions,
involving: (i) preferential hydrolysis of Al-P-rich domain leading to porous
gel regions; (ii) retention of Al-Si glass domains within the gel layer, with
water infiltrating inter-network spaces; and (iii) selective leaching of
phosphorus over aluminum, leading to reorganization of the gel network.

- **TL;DR**: 本文揭示了TaTe₂中一阶相变的微观机制，发现高温非公度电荷序前驱态与局域化学键合之间的竞争是导致相变的关键因素。

First-order phase transitions, characterized by a discontinuous change in the
order parameter, are intriguing phenomena in condensed matter physics. However,
the underlying, material-specific, microscopic mechanisms often remain unclear.
Here, we unveil a high-temperature incommensurate charge-order precursor with
the wave vector $\mathbf{q}^* = (0, \frac{1}{4}+\delta, \frac{1}{2})$ in the
1T' phase of TaTe$_2$, which competes with fluctuating high-temperature Ta
trimer bonding states at $\mathbf{q}_\mathrm{CO} =(0, \frac{1}{3}, 0)$. The
precursor state follows the temperature dependence of the hidden
incommensurability of the $\textit{quasi}$-1D nested Fermi surface. In
contrast, the low-temperature commensurate charge order at
$\mathbf{q}_\mathrm{CO}$, characterized by a charge disproportionation of the
inequivalent Ta sites, appears to be driven by local chemical bonding.
Dynamical lattice calculations identify an imaginary optical mode at
$\mathbf{q}^*$, involving an in-plane vibration of the Ta atoms forming a
chain-like structure that renormalizes below $T_\mathrm{CO}$. Our experimental
and theoretical observations suggest that the controversial first-order phase
transition, as captured by phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau theory, results
from the competition between two order parameters: one involving Fermi surface
nesting and the other involving local chemical bonding.

### Thermal and Electrical Properties of (Cr,Mo,Ta,V,W)C High-Entropy Carbide Ceramics

The synthesis and characterization, along with the resulting properties, of
fully dense \((\mathrm{Cr, Mo, Ta, V, W})\mathrm{C}\) high-entropy carbide
ceramics were studied. The ceramics were synthesized from metal oxide and
carbon powders by carbothermal reduction, followed by spark plasma sintering at
various temperatures for densification. Increasing the densification
temperature resulted in grain growth and an increase in the lattice parameter.
Thermal diffusivity increased linearly with testing temperature, resulting in
thermal conductivity values ranging from approximately
\(7~\mathrm{W\,m^{-1}\,K^{-1}}\) at room temperature to
\(12~\mathrm{W\,m^{-1}\,K^{-1}}\) at \(200~^\circ\mathrm{C}\). Measured heat
capacity values matched theoretical estimates made using the Neumann--Kopp
rule. Room-temperature electrical resistivity decreased from \(137\) to
\(120~\mu\Omega\cdot\mathrm{cm}\) as the excess carbon decreased from \(5.4\)
to \(0.1~\mathrm{vol\%}\), suggesting an enhanced electronic contribution to
thermal conductivity as excess carbon decreased. All specimens exhibited a
Vickers hardness of approximately \(29~\mathrm{GPa}\) under a
\(0.49~\mathrm{N}\) load. These results underscore the tunability of this
high-entropy carbide system.

### Towards Universal Material Property Prediction with Deep Learning and Single-Descriptor electronic Density

- **TL;DR**: 开发基于电子电荷密度的通用机器学习框架，可准确预测8种不同材料性质，并展示出色的多任务学习能力和可迁移性。

Owing to its high scalability and computational efficiency, machine learning
methods have been increasingly integrated into various scientific research
domains, including ab initio-based materials design. It has been demonstrated
that, by incorporating modern machine learning algorithms, one can predict
material properties with practically acceptable accuracy. However, one of the
most significant limitations that restrict the widespread application of
machine learning is its lack of transferability, as a given framework is
typically applicable only to a specific property. The origin of this limitation
is rooted in the fact that a material's properties are determined by multiple
degrees of freedom -- and their complex interplay -- associated with nuclei and
electrons, such as atomic type, structural symmetry, and the number and quantum
states of the valence electrons, among others. The inherent complexity rules
out the possibility of a single machine learning framework providing a full
description of these critical quantities. In this paper, we develop a universal
machine learning framework based solely on a physically grounded and
theoretically rigorous descriptor -- electronic charge density. Our framework
not only enables accurate prediction of eight different material properties
(with R$^2$ values up to 0.94), but also demonstrates outstanding multi-task
learning capability, as prediction accuracy improves when more target
properties are incorporated into a single training process, thereby indicating
excellent transferability. These results represent a significant step toward
realizing the long-standing goal of a universal machine learning framework for
the unified prediction of all material properties.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究系统分析了二维Ruddlesden-Popper钙钛矿中自由激子和激子极化子的动力学行为，发现制造工艺和有机间隔层选择显著影响激子极化子的稳定性和平衡。

Two dimensional Ruddlesden Popper (2D) RP hybrid perovskites exhibit
substantially higher chemical and structural stability than their three
dimensional (3D) counterparts, positioning them as promising candidates for
next generation optoelectronics. While quasiparticle dynamics in 3D perovskites
are well studied, their 2D analogues remain comparatively underexplored. Here
we systematically investigate the branching, dynamics, and interactions of free
excitons (FEs) and exciton polarons EPs in monolayer 2D RP perovskites using
visible range femtosecond transient absorption TA spectroscopy. We prepared
monolayer 2D RP perovskite thin films with varied organic spacers and distinct
fabrication routes for comparative analysis. We find that the EP binding energy
is 50 65 meV in (BA)2PbI4 and 37 39 meV in (PEA)2PbI4, consistent with spacer
layer dependent coupling as corroborated by FTIR. We reveal a dynamic
equilibrium between FEs and EPs that persists for tens of picoseconds. Notably,
the TA signatures differ by fabrication route films from the newly developed
process show weaker Auger annihilation and a reduced hot phonon bottleneck than
those from the conventional route trends consistent with fewer traps and
impurities in the former. Coupled rate equation modeling reproduces the
transients and quantifies the processes of hot carrier relaxation, exciton
exciton annihilation, exciton phonon coupling, and FE EP interconversion. These
results demonstrate that the chemical synthetic process (fabrication route) and
spacer choice significantly influence EP stability and population balance,
offering practical levers for engineering ultrafast photophysics in 2D
perovskites and guiding the design of advanced optoelectronic devices.

- **TL;DR**: 在CeAlSi外尔半金属中观察到磁场诱导的Lifshitz转变，表明铁磁序使外尔节点更接近费米能级，且RKKY相互作用发挥重要作用。

The Weyl semimetal CeAlSi crystallises in the noncentrosymmetric tetragonal
space group $I4_1md$ and exhibits ferromagnetic order below 8 K, thereby
breaking both spatial inversion and time-reversal symmetries. This unique
combination of properties establishes CeAlSi as a model system for studying the
interplay between non-trivial topological states and strong electron
correlations. In this work, we report observations of Shubnikov-de Haas
oscillations in the electrical resistivity under magnetic fields up to 68 T
applied parallel to the [001] crystallographic axis. Our measurements reveal an
abrupt change in the oscillation frequencies near 14 T, which is indicative of
a field-induced Lifshitz transition. Additionally, our results are consistent
with the ferromagnetic order bringing the Weyl nodes closer to the Fermi level
in CeAlSi. Furthermore, they suggest that the RKKY interaction plays an
important role.

Recently, the isolation of 2D magnetic materials has opened several avenues
for possible new ap- plications in spintronics. Among these materials, CrSBr
has sparked interest due to its relatively high Curie temperature, highly
anisotropic lattice structure, and high structural stability. These properties
ran along others shared by any atomically thin material such as its outstanding
defor- mation capacity and a strong optical response dominated by excitonic
effects. The combination of these properties provides a fairly uncharted
playground where to explore the interplay between magnetism and optical
excitations. Here, we focus our attention on the theoretical optical response
of CrSBr under several distinct strain configurations, analyzing the resulting
changes to both the excitonic peaks and overall shape of the diagonal
components of the linear conductivity tensor.

### The nature of polar distortions in ferroelectrics

Polar distortion, the collective off-center displacements of atoms, is a
fingerprint of a ferroelectric that governs its properties and functionalities.
Since the 1970s, the concepts of proper, improper and triggered ferroelectrics
have been established to shed light on a diversity of polar distortion
mechanisms. Such concepts assign a single nature to polar distortion and are
helpful to interpret how polar distortions occur in conventional ferroelectrics
such as barium titanate. However, applying these concepts to complex
ferroelectrics (e.g., polar orthorhombic hafnia) is notoriously challenging and
can yield highly controversial arguments. Here we resolve this issue by
developing a tailor-made graph theory for clarifying the nature of polar
distortions in complex ferroelectrics, which emphasizes that polar distortions
in such ferroelectrics usually exhibit multiple natures among proper, improper
and triggered characteristics. We demonstrate the robustness of our theory by
working with perovsktie superlattices and polar orthorhombic hafnia (i.e., two
representative cases). We successfully identify the mixed proper-improper
nature in perovsktite superlattices and reconcile the controversy on polar
orthorhombic hafnia by confirming its mixed trigger-improper nature. Our work
will definitely lead to a revisitation of concepts in ferroelectric physics and
provide opportunities for discovering novel ferroelectrics and related
phenomena.

We develop a nonequilibrium multi-orbital extension of the two-particle
self-consistent theory and apply it to the bilayer Hubbard model as a minimal
platform to investigate correlation effects in the presence of interlayer
interactions and tunneling. The method determines vertex corrections in the
spin and charge channels self-consistently at the two-particle level, thereby
avoiding the spurious finite-temperature phase transitions that limit dynamical
mean-field theory in two dimensions. We derive the spectral self-energy and
implement the framework directly on the real-frequency axis within the Keldysh
nonequilibrium Green's function formalism, enabling the treatment of both
equilibrium and non-equilibrium steady states without relying on numerical
analytic continuation. As an application, we demonstrate that a pseudogap can
emerge in the bilayer Hubbard model when spin, charge, or excitonic
fluctuations become sufficiently strong. Instabilities in different channels
are also evaluated in an unbiased manner across the parameter space.
Remarkably, we find that the excitonic susceptibility grows with increasing
interlayer bias, before it gets suppressed at large biases by the charge
imbalance between the layers. This work establishes a versatile and
computationally efficient framework for investigating correlated multi-orbital
systems under nonequilibrium conditions.

We propose a model based on density functional theory (DFT) and quantum
electrodynamics (QED) to study the dynamical characteristics of graphene
quantum dots (GQDs). We assume the GQD edges are saturated with hydrogen atoms,
effectively making it a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) such as coronene.
By combining the GQD spectrum calculated from a time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) with
the dynamical behavior of a QD model derived from QED, we calculate the main
optical characteristics of the GQD, such as its transition frequencies, the
dipole moment associated to each of those transitions, life-time and the
population dynamics of the molecular levels. Owing to the close match between
the calculated spectrum and experimental results, our results represent a
significant contribution to research on quantum treatments of light-matter
interactions in realistic 2D nanomaterials.

We report Ru L$_3$-edge resonant X-ray diffraction studies on single crystal
and (001) epitaxial films of RuO$_2$. We investigate the distinct $\mathbf{Q} =
(100)$ and $(001)$ reflections as a function of incident energy, azimuthal
angle, and temperature. The results show that the observed resonant diffraction
in RuO$_2$ is fully consistent with a resonant charge anisotropy signal of
structural origin permitted by the parent (non-magnetic) rutile $P4_2/mnm$
space group. These results significantly constrain the magnetic contribution to
the resonant diffraction signal and indicate the unlikely existence of
$\mathbf{k} = 0$ antiferromagnetic order in RuO$_2$.

- **TL;DR**: 研究发现过渡金属二硫化物单层的光致发光强度在低应变下呈现不规则变化，主要受基底曲率对光学偶极子发射的影响，而非高应变下的能带结构变化。

Monolayers of transition-metal dichalcogenides have shown that uniaxial
strain changes both the photoluminescence emission energy and intensity. The
changes are attributed to the band-structure evolution under tensile strain
where both the bandgap decreases and a direct-to-indirect transition occurs.
This was shown for relatively high strains, whereas this is not the case at low
strain values $&lt;1\%$ in which in this work, we observe the erratic dependency
of the photoluminescence intensity at low strain values as a function of
strain. We find that the dominant physical property is the dependence of the
optical-dipole emission on the curvature of the substrate. We validate the
behavior of the photoluminescence intensity with experimental angular emission
spectroscopy (k-space imaging). These findings are supported by
Finite-Difference Time-Domain simulations, in agreement with the experimental
data. Our findings present the importance of choosing the right substrate for
flexible devices based on transition-metal dichalcogenides.

The search for thin film electro-optic (EO) materials that can retain
superior performance under cryogenic conditions has become critical for quantum
computing. Barium titanate thin films show large linear EO coefficients in the
tetragonal phase at room temperature, which is severely degraded down to ~200
pm V$^{-1}$ in the rhombohedral phase at cryogenic temperatures. There is
immense interest in manipulating these phase transformations and retaining
superior EO properties down to liquid helium temperature. Utilizing the
thermodynamic theory of optical properties, a large low-temperature EO response
is designed by engineering the energetic competition between different
ferroelectric phases, leading to a low-symmetry monoclinic phase with a massive
EO response. The existence of this phase is demonstrated in a strain-tuned
BaTiO$_{3}$ thin film that exhibits a linear EO coefficient of 2516 +/- 100 pm
V$^{-1}$ at 5 K, which is an order of magnitude higher than the best reported
performance thus far. Importantly, the EO coefficient increases by 100x during
cooling, unlike the conventional films, where it degrades. Further, at the
lowest temperature, significant higher order EO responses also emerge. These

- **TL;DR**: 在GeTe非晶相变材料中，通过退火抑制β-弛豫过程可以有效减缓结晶动力学，降低结晶的随机性，并增强非晶结构中的Peierls-like畸变。

A secondary $\beta$-relaxation process is often the dominant source of atomic
dynamics below $T_\mathrm{g}$ in many glass forming systems. Recent studies
reported the presence of $\beta$-relaxations in amorphous phase-change
materials (PCMs) and showed that suppressing the $\beta$-relaxation via
annealing in Ge$_{15}$Sb$_{85}$ can effectively slow down its crystallization
kinetics. Yet, when Sb is replaced by Te, similar annealing protocol has little
effect on the Te-rich alloy Ge$_{15}$Te$_{85}$. Here, we investigate amorphous
GeTe that is a Sb-free PCM, but with faster crystallization kinetics than
Ge$_{15}$Te$_{85}$. Using powder mechanical dynamic spectroscopy, we observe a
clear reduction of the excess-wing in the loss modulus upon isothermal
annealing, indicating a suppression of its $\beta$-relaxation. Ultrafast
calorimetric analysis and time-resolved optical reflectivity measurements show
that, whereas as-deposited GeTe exhibit stochastic crystallization behaviors,
annealed samples crystallize more slowly with reduced stochasticity.
Synchrotron X-ray scattering experiments reveal reinforced Peierls-like
distortions in the amorphous structure after annealing, and demonstrate that,
even if annealing introduces nucleation sites, it nonetheless slows down
crystallization kinetics. These finding suggests that, in annealed GeTe,
crystallization is limited by crystal growth rate, which is retarded through
the suppression of $\beta$-relaxation.

- **TL;DR**: 通过外加电场调控双层MoS2中杂化层间激子的偶极相互作用，增强排斥性非线性相互作用，实现比零场情况更大的蓝移，为控制激子相互作用提供新方法。

Hybrid interlayer excitons in bilayer MoS2 are a promising platform for
nonlinear optics due to their intrinsic dipolar character, which combines
in-plane and out-ofplane dipole moments. In this work, we directly probe the
nonlinear exciton-exciton interactions of hybrid interlayer excitons. By
applying an external out-of-plane electric field, we polarize the excitons to
enhance their mutual dipolar interactions, thereby deliberately favoring these
repulsive contributions over competing attractive manybody corrections. We
furthermore establish a fully microscopic theoretical description of these
effects to explain the core experimental results. The tuning results in a
significantly larger blueshift compared to the zero-field case and
perspectively opens an avenue to even switch between repulsive and attractive
interaction potentials. Our findings establish that strong nonlinearities can
be tuned via an external electric field, providing a new degree of control over
exciton interactions beyond density tuning alone.

- **TL;DR**: 使用非磁性CrSi模板层在Si(111)上生长B20 MnGe薄膜，研究其本征磁性和输运性质，发现低温下出现反常剩余磁矩和输运特征。

We report on a novel method to grow B20 MnGe thin films which employs an
ultrathin CrSi template layer on Si(111). This layer is expected to be
non-magnetic, in contrast to MnSi and FeGe buffer layers that have been used
previously, allowing an investigation of the intrinsic properties the MnGe in
the ultrathin film limit without the influence of a neighboring magnetic layer.
Single-phase MnGe(111) films were grown with thicknesses between 2 and 40 nm,
which exhibited low interfacial roughnesses on the order of 0.6 nm. The films
crystallized in a B20 structure with a small rhombohedral distortion.
Magnetometry measurements in out-of-plane fields are consistent with a conical
state. However, an unexpected remanent moment develops below 35 K, concomitant
with features in the field dependence of the transport data. This provides
indirect evidence for the presence of a low-temperature phase which has been
identified by others as either a triple-Q topological spin-hedgehog lattice, or
a multi-domain single-Q conical state.

- **TL;DR**: 在硅衬底上生长高质量BaTiO3铁电薄膜，通过插入SrSn1-xTixO3缓冲层实现无印记开关、低矫顽场、高剩余极化和优异的抗疲劳特性

Highly-crystalline ferroelectric oxides integrated on Si hold great promise
for energy-efficient memory and logic technologies. Exploiting epitaxial strain
engineering in these materials is, however, severely hampered on Si, where the
large structural mismatch often results in an inferior interfacial quality and
causes a degradation of the ferroelectric switching characteristics. In this
work, we present the growth of single-crystalline BaTiO3 thin films on Si,
exhibiting imprint-free switching, low coercivity, high remanent polarization,
and no fatigue for over $10^{10}$ switching cycles. We accomplish this via the
insertion of a SrSn1-xTixO3 layer on SrTiO3-buffered Si. This layer serves as a
pseudo substrate that alleviates the thermal strain that the Si substrates
imposes on the BaTiO3 layer, while simultaneously providing moderate
compressive strain that stabilizes a pure out-of-plane polarization. Thus, our
work paves the way toward the fabrication of Si-compatible, low-power-consuming
ferroelectric devices for non-volatile memory applications.

Two-dimensional (2D) nitride materials such as hexagonal boron nitride
(h-BN), graphitic carbon nitride (g-C$_3$N$_4$), and beryllonitrene (BeN$_4$)
have emerged as promising candidates for next generation electronic,
optoelectronic, and energy applications due to their unique structural and
electronic properties. This study presents a systematic investigation of the
effects of vacancy defect, specifically the role of nitrogen and constituent
atom vacancies on the electronic properties of these materials. Our findings
reveal that the introduction of nitrogen vacancies significantly alters the
electronic characteristics of these materials. In h-BN, the presence of a
nitrogen monovacancy significantly lowers the work function from 5.97 eV to
3.45 eV, one of the lowest values reported for any 2D material. Additionally,
this defect reduces the band gap from 4.6 eV to 0.64 eV, driving the material
toward half-metallic behavior. This is accompanied by the emergence of flat
bands near the Fermi level, indicative of strong electron-electron
interactions. In g-C$_3$N$_4$, nitrogen vacancies lead to a decrease in work
function and band gap, with double nitrogen vacancies rendering the material
nearly metallic. In BeN$_4$, nitrogen vacancies result in minimal charge
redistribution and a slight increase in work function, highlighting the
material's unique electronic behavior. These results underscore the potential
of vacancy engineering in tuning the electronic properties of 2D nitride
materials, offering avenues for the design of materials with tailored work
functions and band gaps for applications in optoelectronics, spintronics, and
catalysis.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种通过层间应变控制而非传统扭曲方法在二维材料中产生莫尔干涉的新技术，实现了高产量、可重复的莫尔结构制造。

Two-dimensional (2D) materials with a twist between layers exhibit a moir\'e
interference pattern with larger periodicity than any of the constituent layer
unit cells. In these systems, a wealth of exotic phases appear that result from
moir\'e-dependent many-body electron correlation effects or non-trivial band
topology. One problem with using twist to generate moir\'e interference has
been the difficulty in creating high-quality, uniform, and repeatable samples
due to fabrication through mechanical stacking with viscoelastic stamps. Here
we show, a new method to generate moir\'e interference through the controlled
application of layer-by-layer strain (heterostrain) on non-twisted 2D
materials, where moir\'e interference results from strain-induced lattice
mismatch without twisting or stacking. Heterostrain generation is achieved by
depositing stressed thin films onto 2D materials to apply large strains to the
top layers while leaving layers further down less strained. We achieve
deterministic control of moir\'e periodicity and symmetry in non-twisted 2D
multilayers and bilayers, with 97% yield, through varying stressor film force
(film thickness X film stress) and geometry. Moir\'e reconstruction effects are
memorized after the removal of the stressor layers. Control over the strain
degree-of-freedom opens the door to a completely unexplored set of unrealized
tunable moir\'e geometric symmetries, which may now be achieved in a high-yield
and user-skill independent process taking only hours. This technique solves a
long-standing throughput bottleneck in new moir\'e quantum materials discovery
and opens the door to industrially-compatible manufacturing for 2D
moir\'e-based electronic or optical devices.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种可扩展的方法，通过图案化薄膜应力源在二维材料中确定性诱导应变，构建异质应变诱导的莫尔超晶格，并观察到不同的莫尔图案和面内极化效应。

Moir\'e superlattice in two-dimensional (2D) materials provides a powerful
platform to engineer emergent electronic states, yet the construction of
moir\'e superlattices remains lab-scale, involving much trial and error and
with little control. Here, we demonstrate the construction of a
heterostrain-induced moir\'e superlattice in transition metal dichalcogenides
using a scalable process that deterministically induces strain to 2D materials.
By applying patterned thin-film stressors and probing the resulting structures
with scanning transmission electron microscopy, we directly resolve the induced
heterostrain, lattice deformations, and stacking variations that produce the
moir\'e superlattice. We find that uniaxial and biaxial heterostrain give rise
to distinct moir\'e patterns, including stripes and distorted hexagonal
patterns. With this approach, we create in-plane polar distortions and thus
in-plane polarization at the domain boundaries of the moir\'e superlattice in
MoS$_2$. The deterministic and scalable construction of moir\'e patterns using
a well-established scalable process opens opportunities to design new moir\'e
geometries in 2D materials.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究通过三种独立实验方法证明RuO₂薄膜中不存在长程反铁磁序和交变磁性，挑战了RuO₂作为交变磁性范例的观点。

Excitement about the magnetic and electronic properties of RuO$_2$ is
growing, fueled by reports of antiferromagnetism, strain-induced
superconductivity, and its recent classification as a member of a newly
proposed magnetic class, altermagnets, with RuO$_2$ widely regarded as the
paradigmatic example. Nevertheless, the magnetic ground state of RuO$_2$
remains contentious, as several recent experiments report no evidence of
magnetic order. To address this discrepancy, we performed resonant elastic
scattering measurements on a series of epitaxial RuO$_2$ thin films grown on
the (100)-plane of TiO$_2$ substrates across a range of strain states.
Leveraging full polarization control and azimuthal scans of the structurally
forbidden 100 Bragg reflection, we systematically tested for signatures of
colinear antiferromagnetic order. We found that the resonant elastic scattering
signal in RuO$_2$ thin films likely originates from anisotropic charge
scattering, not long-range antiferromagnetic order. Using angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy we uncover a band structure without altermagnetic
band splitting that is consistent with a nonmagnetic phase. Similarly,
anisotropic magnetoresistance results show no evidence of magnetism. The
combination of three independent measurements suggests the absence of
altermagnetism in RuO$_2$.
