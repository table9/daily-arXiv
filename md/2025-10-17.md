- **TL;DR**: 该论文报道了在Pb1-xSnxSe量子阱中发现量子霍尔谷向列相，具有SU(3)序参量空间，通过自发极化实现三重简并谷赝自旋的对称性破缺。

Two-dimensional quantum materials can host original electronic phases that
arise from the interplay of electronic correlations, symmetry and topology. In
particular, the spontaneous breaking of internal symmetry that acts
simultaneously on the pseudospin and the spatial degree of freedom realizes a
nematic ordering. We report evidence of a quantum Hall valley nematic phase
with an underlying SU(3) order parameter space obtained by a spontaneous
polarization between the threefold degenerate valley pseudospins in Pb1-xSnxSe
quantum wells. In the presence of a Zeeman field, we demonstrate a further
control of the nematic ordering with an explicit symmetry breaking. Evidence of
both spontaneous and explicit SU(3) symmetry breaking, reminiscent of the quark
flavor paradigm, is of fundamental interest to shape the many body physics in a
SU(3) system.

### Unconventional criticality in $O(D)$-invariant loop-constrained Landau theory

- **TL;DR**: 研究铁电体中受无散约束的极化序参数临界行为，发现超出传统Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson范式的临界现象，序参数获得显著增大的反常维度。

We study the critical behavior of a Landau-type theory for ferroelectrics in
which the polarization order parameter $\vec{P}$ is subject to a
divergence-free constraint, such that only loop-like polarization
configurations contribute to the partition function. This constraint forces the
number of components of the field $\vec{P}$ to equal the spatial dimensionality
$D$, allowing a natural extension of the present theory to $O(N)$ models with
$N=D$. Renormalization group analysis reveals critical behavior beyond the
conventional Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm. In particular, the order
parameter acquires a remarkably large anomalous dimension, with $\eta\approx
0.239$ in three dimensions -- significantly exceeding the value $\eta\approx
0.034$ typical of the $O(3)$ universality class. This is due to an emergent
gauge symmetry originating with the local constraint.

### Comparative study of phonon-limited carrier transport in the Weyl semimetal TaAs family

- **TL;DR**: 通过第一性原理玻尔兹曼输运方程系统研究了TaAs族Weyl半金属的声子限制输运特性，发现NbP具有最高电导率，而TaAs电导率最低，这与费米速度和散射率有关。

We present a systematic first-principles study of phonon-limited transport in
the TaAs family of Weyl semimetals using the ab initio Boltzmann transport
equation. The calculated electrical conductivities show excellent agreement
with experimental data for high-quality samples, confirming that transport in
these systems is predominantly limited by phonon scattering. Among the four
compounds, NbP achieves the highest conductivity, governed primarily by its
large Fermi velocities that offset its stronger scattering rates. In contrast,
TaAs displays the lowest conductivity, linked to reduced carrier pockets and
limited carrier velocities. Additionally, NbP conductivity remains largely
unaffected by small hole or electron doping, whereas TaAs exhibits pronounced
electron-hole asymmetry. NbAs and TaP show intermediate behavior, reflecting
their Fermi surface topologies and scattering phase space. These findings
provide microscopic insight into the transport mechanisms of the TaAs family
and emphasize the critical role of phonons, doping, and carrier dynamics in
shaping their electronic response.

### Towards a unified mechanistic understanding of the electrical response of bipolar nanofluidic systems

- **TL;DR**: 开发了一个统一框架来改进纳米流体器件的设计，揭示了系统响应由外加电压和几何与表面电荷密度比参数η共同控制，并建立了简化的相空间表示。

Bipolar nanoporous membranes and bipolar nanochannels are used in water
desalination and energy-harvesting systems that provide clean water and green
energy, respectively. The growing need for both requires continuous improvement
of their performance. However, the underlying physics of these complex systems
is still not fully understood, making empirical optimization slow and
inefficient. In this work, we combine theoretical analysis and numerical
simulations to develop a unified framework for improving the design of
nanofluidic devices. We show that the system response is governed by the
interplay between the applied voltage and a parameter $\eta$, which depends on
the ratio of geometry and surface charge densities of both charged regions. At
low voltages, the response is mostly determined by $\eta$, allowing its
dependence to be represented by a simplified phase space. At high voltages,
this phase space becomes oversimplified. To demonstrate the framework's
robustness, we scan a range of configurations, from unipolar channels (single
charged region) to bipolar channels (positive and negative segments). We
compare the numerically simulated current-voltage responses with three
theoretical models, which are limiting scenarios within the phase space, and
explain the observed deviations. These findings can help reduce the time and
resources required to optimize nanofluidic devices and improve the
interpretation of experiments and simulations.

### Experimental Demonstration of a Superconductor SFQ-Based ADC for High-Frequency Signal Acquisition

- **TL;DR**: 开发了一种基于超导单磁通量子(SFQ)的模数转换器(ADC)，能够检测高频输入电流信号的小变化并将其转换为SFQ脉冲序列，集成了多数电路和两种计数器以提高鲁棒性。

Superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) are among the most
sensitive sensors, offering high precision through their well-defined
flux-voltage characteristics. Building on this sensitivity, we designed,
fabricated, and experimentally demonstrated a superconducting single flux
quantum (SFQ)-based analog-to-digital converter (ADC) capable of detecting
small variations in input current signals at high frequencies and converting
them into SFQ pulse trains. To improve robustness and reduce errors, the design
incorporates a majority circuit and two types of counters: asynchronous toggle
flip-flop-based and synchronous cumulative-based, at the cryogenic stage. The
counter collects the SFQ pulse train and converts it into a binary number,
simplifying downstream digital readout. The circuits were implemented using the
AIST CRAVITY (QuFab) HSTP process and successfully tested in our cryocooler
system, validating both the design methodology and operation. This approach
helps build a fully integrated system that combines digital SQUID functionality
with cryogenic readout circuits on a single chip.

### Quantized Skeletal Learning (QSL): A Differentiable Programming Approach for Skeletal Reduction of Chemical Mechanisms

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种称为量化骨架学习(QSL)的数据驱动方法，用于生成骨架机制。该方法通过权重向量和端到端可微分程序来消除不重要物种和反应，并使用L1正则化促进稀疏性。

This paper presents a data-driven approach, referred to as Quantized Skeletal
Learning (QSL), for generating skeletal mechanisms. The approach has two key
components: (1) a weight vector that can be used to eliminate relatively
unimportant species and reactions, and (2) an end-to-end differentiable program
whose loss-function gradients, with respect to the weight vector, can be used
to adjust those weights. To promote sparsity in the weight vector -- and to
reduce the influence of certain reactions or species to zero -- an
$l_1$-regularized objective is employed alongside the standard mean squared
error loss, thus removing the least important components. The proposed QSL
approach is validated by generating skeletal mechanisms for methane and
ethylene based on the GRI 3.0 and USC II mechanisms, respectively,
demonstrating effectiveness in deriving skeletal mechanisms with various levels
of fidelity. Two variants of QSL, designated as QSL-R and QSL-S, are tested;
these focus on eliminating reactions and species, respectively. Analysis of
ignition delay times and species mass fractions demonstrate QSL's capabilities
to reliably and efficiently extract data-driven skeletal mechanisms of varying
fidelities from detailed mechanisms.

### Surrogate Models for Linear Response

- **Categories**: physics.comp-ph, nucl-th
- **TL;DR**: 提出了两种QRPA替代模型来加速核物理中的线性响应计算，实现了6-7个数量级的加速和0.1%-1%的精度。

Linear response theory is a well-established method in physics and chemistry
for exploring excitations of many-body systems. In particular, the
quasiparticle random-phase approximation (QRPA) provides a powerful microscopic
framework by building excitations on top of the mean-field vacuum; however, its
high computational cost limits model calibration and uncertainty quantification
studies. Here, we present two complementary QRPA surrogate models and apply
them to study response functions of finite nuclei. One is a reduced-order model
that exploits the underlying QRPA structure, while the other utilizes the
recently developed parametric matrix model algorithm to construct a map between
the system's Hamiltonian and observables. Our benchmark applications, the
calculation of the electric dipole polarizability of ${}^{180}$Yb and the
$\beta$-decay half-life of ${}^{80}$Ni, show that both emulators can achieve
0.1\%--1\% accuracy while offering a six to seven orders of magnitude speedup
compared to state-of-the-art QRPA solvers. These results demonstrate that the
developed QRPA emulators are well-positioned to enable Bayesian calibration and
large-scale studies of computationally expensive physics models describing the
properties of many-body systems.

### FFT-Accelerated Auxiliary Variable MCMC for Fermionic Lattice Models: A Determinant-Free Approach with $O(N\log N)$ Complexity

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种基于MCMC的量子多体系统模拟算法，通过傅里叶域中的新型转移核和FFT加速，将计算复杂度从O(N^3)降低到近线性O(N log N)。

We introduce a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that dramatically
accelerates the simulation of quantum many-body systems, a grand challenge in
computational science. State-of-the-art methods for these problems are severely
limited by $O(N^3)$ computational complexity. Our method avoids this
bottleneck, achieving near-linear $O(N \log N)$ scaling per sweep.
  Our approach samples a joint probability measure over two coupled variable
sets: (1) particle trajectories of the fundamental fermions, and (2) auxiliary
variables that decouple fermion interactions. The key innovation is a novel
transition kernel for particle trajectories formulated in the Fourier domain,
revealing the transition probability as a convolution that enables massive
acceleration via the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The auxiliary variables
admit closed-form, factorized conditional distributions, enabling efficient
exact Gibbs sampling update.
  We validate our algorithm on benchmark quantum physics problems, accurately
reproducing known theoretical results and matching traditional $O(N^3)$
algorithms on $32\times 32$ lattice simulations at a fraction of the wall-clock
time, empirically demonstrating $N \log N$ scaling. By reformulating a
long-standing physics simulation problem in machine learning language, our work
provides a powerful tool for large-scale probabilistic inference and opens
avenues for physics-inspired generative models.

Recent work has identified a fundamental bound on the thermodynamic cost of
stochastic oscillators in the weak-noise regime (Santolin and Falasco, 2025;
Nagayama and Ito, 2025). In this brief note, we provide an alternative and
elementary derivation of this bound, based only on the assumption of Gaussian
phase fluctuations and the thermodynamic uncertainty relation. Our approach may
be useful for future generalizations of the bound.

### CBVB-nH complexes as prevalent defects in metal-organic vapor-phase epitaxy-grown hexagonal boron nitride

- **TL;DR**: 通过第一性原理计算研究了hBN中碳、硼空位和氢形成的缺陷复合物的热力学稳定性和光学性质，发现CBVB-nH复合物在富氮条件下易于形成，其光学特性与MOVPE生长的hBN样品中观测到的1.90 eV和2.24 eV发射峰一致。

Optically active defects in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are promising
candidates for active components in emerging quantum technologies, such as
single-photon emitters and spin centers. However, further progress in hBN-based
quantum technologies requires a deeper understanding of the physics and
chemistry of hBN defects. In this work, we employ ab initio calculations to
investigate the thermodynamic stability and optical properties of defect
complexes involving carbon, boron vacancies, and hydrogen. We demonstrate that
the formation of CBVB-nH complexes (n from 0 to 3) is energetically favorable
under nitrogen-rich conditions in the presence of carbon and hydrogen. The low
formation energies and high binding energies of these complexes arise from the
strong electrostatic attraction between the positively charged carbon
substitutional defect (CB) and the negatively charged hydrogen-passivated boron
vacancies (VB-nH). These complexes are particularly likely to form in
metal-organic vapor-phase epitaxy (MOVPE)-grown samples, where growth occurs in
the presence of carbon and hydrogen and is accompanied by a high density of
boron vacancies. The optical properties of CBVB-nH complexes are analyzed and
compared to recent photoluminescence measurements on MOVPE-grown hBN samples.
In particular, we investigate the origin of the emission peaks at 1.90 eV and
2.24 eV and demonstrate that both the energies and lineshapes are consistent
with hole capture by negatively charged CBVB and CBVB-H complexes.

### Mapping Temperature Using Transmission Kikuchi Diffraction

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种非接触式扫描电子显微镜技术——菊池衍射测温法(KDTh)，能够以纳米级分辨率映射晶体样品的温度和压力，通过分析菊池图案来检测局部晶格体积变化。

Electronic devices are engineered at increasingly smaller length scales; new
metrologies to understand nanoscale thermodynamics are needed. Temperature and
pressure are fundamental thermodynamic quantities whose nanoscale measurement
is challenging as physical contact inevitably perturbs the system. Here we
demonstrate Kikuchi diffraction thermometry (KDTh), a non-contact scanning
electron microscope (SEM) technique capable of mapping nanoscale temperatures
and pressures. KDTh detects local volumetric lattice changes in crystalline
samples by precisely fitting Kikuchi patterns. Temperature changes are deduced
using the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE). We map lattice parameters and
temperatures on Joule-heated graphite by rastering a 5.5-nm electron probe
across the sample. Our parameter precision is ~0.01% and our temperature
sensitivity is 2.2 K/$\sqrt{Hz}$. KDTh offers advanced sensitivity by fitting
the entire Kikuchi pattern, even beyond the precision measured in transmission
electron microscopy. KDTh can operate in both transmission (transmission
Kikuchi diffraction, TKD) and reflection (electron backscatter diffraction,
EBSD) modes.

### Superconductivity in UTe$_2$ from local noncentrosymmetricity

- **TL;DR**: 本文通过多子晶格周期安德森模型分析UTe₂中的磁涨落和超导性，揭示了各向异性磁涨落和自旋三重态超导的对称性特征。

Superconductivity in UTe$_{2}$ has garnered significant attention, as it is
widely recognized as a promising candidate for a spin-triplet superconductor.
However, the symmetry of superconductivity and the microscopic origin of
spin-triplet pairing remain subjects of debate. Nevertheless, various
experiments imply an intimate coupling between magnetism and superconductivity.
In this paper, we analyze a multi-sublattice periodic Anderson model that
incorporates a spin-orbit coupling allowed in locally noncentrosymmetric
crystals to discuss magnetic fluctuations and superconductivity in UTe$_2$. Due
to the sublattice-dependent spin-orbit coupling, magnetic fluctuations become
anisotropic, and the spin degeneracy of superconducting states is lifted. Our
calculations reveal anisotropic antiferromagnetic fluctuations along the $b$-
and $c$-axes, anisotropic ferromagnetic fluctuations along the $a$-axis, and
their coexistence. These can be tuned by the $f$-electron's level.
Superconductivity in the $A_u$ representation is predominant for a wide range
of parameters, whereas the $B_{2u}$ representation is almost degenerate and can
be stabilized. The direction of the $d$-vector changes as we increase the
spin-orbit coupling. We discuss the consistency between our results and several
experiments.

### Shadow Molecular Dynamics for Flexible Multipole Models

- **TL;DR**: 将阴影分子动力学从单极子模型扩展到柔性多极子模型，支持单极子-单极子、偶极子-单极子和偶极子-偶极子相互作用，保持了计算的稳定性和效率。

Shadow molecular dynamics provide an efficient and stable atomistic
simulation framework for flexible charge models with long-range electrostatic
interactions. While previous implementations have been limited to atomic
monopole charge distributions, we extend this approach to flexible multipole
models. We derive detailed expressions for the shadow energy functions,
potentials, and force terms, explicitly incorporating monopole-monopole,
dipole-monopole, and dipole-dipole interactions. In our formulation, both
atomic monopoles and atomic dipoles are treated as extended dynamical variables
alongside the propagation of the nuclear degrees of freedom. We demonstrate
that introducing the additional dipole degrees of freedom preserves the
stability and accuracy previously seen in monopole-only shadow molecular
dynamics simulations. Additionally, we present a shadow molecular dynamics
scheme where the monopole charges are held fixed while the dipoles remain
flexible. Our extended shadow dynamics provide a framework for stable,
computationally efficient, and versatile molecular dynamics simulations
involving long-range interactions between flexible multipoles. This is of
particular interest in combination with modern artificial intelligence and
machine learning techniques, which are increasingly used to develop
physics-informed and data-driven foundation models for atomistic simulations.
These models aim to provide transferable, high-accuracy representations of
atomic interactions that are applicable across diverse sets of molecular
systems, which requires accurate treatment of long-range charge interactions.

### Anti-Interference Communication Using Computational Antenna

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种基于计算天线的新型抗干扰通信方法，利用时间平均和1比特可重构智能表面实现鲁棒信号调制，硬件复杂度低。

This letter proposes a novel anti-interference communication method
leveraging computational antennas, utilizing time averaging and 1-bit
reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) to achieve robust signal modulation
with minimal hardware complexity. We develop a communication model for
computational antennas and propose an efficient signal processing algorithm
optimized for temporal modulation. A USRP-based experimental platform is
established to validate the approach under strong interference conditions
(e.g., 5 dB jamming-to-signal ratio). Experimental results reveal up to an
80.9\% reduction in bit error rate (BER) and effective restoration of distorted
images in transmission tests. Compared to conventional techniques like spread
spectrum or frequency hopping, which require significant spectral resources,
our method offers superior anti-interference performance without additional
spectral overhead. This research provides valuable insights for radar
detection, military communications, and next-generation wireless networks.

### Yamaji effect in models of underdoped cuprates

Recent angle-dependent magnetoresistance measurements in underdoped cuprates
have revealed compelling evidence for small hole pockets in the pseudogap
regime, including observation of the Yamaji effect in HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+\delta}$
(Chan et al., Nature Physics 10.1038/s41567-025-03032-2 (2025)). A key
distinction between theories is their predicted Fermi volumes, measured as
fractions of the square lattice Brillouin zone: $p/4$ per pocket for spin
density wave (SDW) versus $p/8$ for fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*), where
$p$ is the hole doping. We calculate the $c$-axis magnetoresistance
$\rho_{zz}(\theta, \phi)$ within the semiclassical Boltzmann formalism for both
states, and using the ancilla layer model (ALM) for FL* in a single-band
Hamiltonian. While the SDW Yamaji azimuthal angle $\theta$ is marginally
smaller than the FL* Yamaji $\theta$, the most significant difference is the
presence of a second Yamaji peak in the SDW theory near in-plane angle $\phi =
45^\circ$; there is no such second peak in the observations in
HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+\delta}$. Furthermore, we examine the role of anisotropic
interlayer hopping present in LSCO, and predict the potential emergence of the
Yamaji effect in LSCO at higher magnetic fields. Our results support the FL*
interpretation of Fermi arcs in the pseudogap phase, and establish Yamaji angle
measurements as a discriminatory tool between theoretical models.

### The Tracy-Widom distribution at large Dyson index

- **TL;DR**: 研究Tracy-Widom分布在Dyson指数β→∞极限下的大偏差行为，发现其概率密度函数呈指数形式f_β(a)~e^{-βΦ(a)}，其中Φ(a)满足Painlevé II方程。

We study the Tracy-Widom (TW) distribution $f_\beta(a)$ in the limit of large
Dyson index $\beta \to +\infty$. This distribution describes the fluctuations
of the rescaled largest eigenvalue $a_1$ of the Gaussian (alias Hermite)
ensemble (G$\beta$E) of (infinitely) large random matrices. We show that, at
large $\beta$, its probability density function takes the large deviation form
$f_\beta(a) \sim e^{-\beta \Phi(a)}$. While the typical deviation of $a_1$
around its mean is Gaussian of variance $O(1/\beta)$, this large deviation form
describes the probability of rare events with deviation $O(1)$, and governs the
behavior of the higher cumulants. We obtain the rate function $\Phi(a)$ as a
solution of a Painlev\'{e} II equation. We derive explicit formula for its
large argument behavior, and for the lowest cumulants, up to order 4. We
compute $\Phi(a)$ numerically for all $a$ and compare with exact numerical
computations of the TW distribution at finite $\beta$. These results are
obtained by applying saddle-point approximations to an associated problem of
energy levels $E=-a$, for a random quantum Hamiltonian defined by the
stochastic Airy operator (SAO). We employ two complementary approaches: (i) we
use the optimal fluctuation method to find the most likely realization of the
noise in the SAO, conditioned on its ground-state energy being $E$ (ii) we
apply the weak-noise theory to the representation of the TW distribution in
terms of a Ricatti diffusion process associated to the SAO. We extend our
results to the full Airy point process $a_1&gt;a_2&gt;\dots$ which describes all edge
eigenvalues of the G$\beta$E, and correspond to (minus) the higher energy
levels of the SAO, obtaining large deviation forms for the marginal
distribution of $a_i$, the joint distributions, and the gap distributions.

- **TL;DR**: 测量了反铁磁体PdCrO2对相邻铁磁层的自旋转矩，发现当温度通过奈尔温度时自旋转矩显著增强，与密度泛函理论计算结果一致。

We report measurements of the current-induced spin torque produced by the
delafossite antiferromagnet PdCrO2 and acting on an adjacent ferromagnetic
permalloy layer. The spin torque increases strongly as the temperature is
reduced through the Neel temperature, when the PdCrO2 transitions from a
paramagnetic phase to a noncollinear antiferromagnetic state. This result is
qualitatively consistent with density functional theory calculations regarding

We present a comprehensive computational framework for simulating
nonadiabatic molecular dynamics with explicit inclusion of geometric phase (GP)
effects. Our approach is based on a generalized two-level Hamiltonian model
that can represent various electronic state crossings - conical intersections,
avoided crossings, and elliptic intersections - through appropriate
parameterization. We introduce a novel prelooping trajectory initialization
scheme, allowing us to encode the memory as an initial phase accumulated due to
the adiabatic evolution over the potential energy surface. This is a unified
framework to handle different types of level crossings by incorporating Berry
curvature-based force corrections to Ehrenfest dynamics, ensuring accurate
representation of topological effects. For conical intersections, our method
incorporates the theoretically expected phase pi, while for elliptic
intersections, it yields a parametrically tunable but loop radius (energy)
independent phase different from pi. We also include an eccentricity parameter
(e) in the diabatic coupling to model more realistic molecular systems.
Numerical simulations demonstrate the consistency of our approach with
theoretical predictions for mixing of states and inhibition from mixing due to
geometric phase effects. This framework provides a valuable tool for studying
quantum-classical interactions in molecular systems where geometric phase
effects play a significant role. The elliptical intersection and geometric
phase effect opens avenue for the design and discovery of degenerate materials.
It produces a fresh look to help develop a new kind of spectroscopy and
potential qubit applications. This simple Hamiltonian reveals a pathological
phase protection effect E = kr, where k is real, that has great utility in a
new spectroscopy design.

Topological nodal superconductors (SCs) have attracted considerable interest
due to their gapless bulk excitations and exotic surface states. In this paper,
by establishing a general framework of the effective theory for multi-orbital
SCs, we realize a class of three-dimensional (3D) time-reversal (T )-invariant
Dirac SCs, with their topologically protected gapless Dirac nodes being located
at general positions in the Brillouin zone. By introducing T -breaking pairing
perturbations, we demonstrate the existence of Majorana hinge modes in these
Dirac SCs as evidence of their realization of higher-order topology. We also
propose a new kind of T -breaking Dirac SCs, whose Dirac nodes possess nonzero
even chiralities and so are characterized by surface Majorana arcs.

We investigate the Sn-substitution effect on the thermoelectric transport
properties of the layered cobaltite [Ca$_2$CoO$_3$]$_{0.62}$[CoO$_2$] single
crystals, which exhibit a non-monotonic temperature variation of the electrical
resistivity and the Seebeck coefficient owing to the complex electronic and
magnetic states. We find that the onset temperature of the short-range
spin-density-wave (SDW) formation increases with the substituted Sn content,
indicating the impurity-induced stabilization of the SDW order, reminiscent of
the disorder/impurity-induced spin order in the cuprate superconductors. The
Seebeck coefficient is well related to such impurity effects, as it is slightly
enhanced below the onset temperatures, implying a decrease in the carrier
concentration due to a pseudo-gap formation associated with the SDW ordering.
We discuss the site-dependent substitution effects including earlier studies,
and suggest that substitution to the conducting CoO$_2$ layers is essential to
increase the onset temperature, consistent with the impurity-induced SDW
picture realized in the conducting layers with the cylindrical Fermi surface.

### Transport with noise in dilute gases: Effect of Langevin thermostat on transport coefficients

In dilute gases, transport properties such as the thermal conductivity,
self-diffusion, and viscosity are significantly affected by interatomic
collisions, which are determined by the potential form. This study explores
these transport properties in the presence of a Langevin thermostat in systems
where particles interact through various potentials, including soft-core and
hard-core potentials, both with and without an attractive region. Using
molecular dynamics simulations and a theoretical approach based on an analogy
with an electric circuit (Ohm's law), we derived and compared the transport
coefficients across these interatomic potentials for different couplings with
the thermostat. The transport coefficients were obtained by considering the
thermostat as a resistance in a series circuit.

### A large spin-splitting altermagnet designed from the hydroxylated MBene monolayer

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种通过羟基旋转策略设计二维反铁磁体中的交替磁体，实现了超过1130 meV的大自旋分裂，并展示了节点线半金属特性和可调控的磁各向异性。

The development of altermagnets is fundamentally important for advancing
spintronic device technology, but remains unpractical for the weak spin
splitting in most cases, especially in two-dimensional materials. Based on spin
group symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations, a novel hydroxyl
rotation strategy in collinear antiferromagnets has been proposed to design
altermagnets. This approach achieves a large chirality-reversible spin
splitting exceeding $1130$ meV in $\alpha_{60}$-Mn$_2$B$_2$(OH)$_2$ monolayer.
The system also exhibits intrinsic features of a node-line semimetal in the
absence of spin-orbit coupling. Besides, the angles of hydroxyl groups serve as
the primary order parameter, which can switch on/off the altermagnetism coupled
with the ferroelastic mechanism. The corresponding magnetocrystalline
anisotropy have also been modulated. Moreover, an interesting spin-related
transport property with the spin-polarized conductivity of 10$^{19}$
$\Omega^{-1}m^{-1}s^{-1}$ also emerges. These findings uncover the hydroxyl
rotation strategy as a versatile tool for designing altermagnetic node-line
semimetals and opening new avenues for achieving exotic chemical and physical
characteristics associated with large spin splitting.

Higher-order topological superconductivity typically depends on spin-orbit
interaction, and often necessitates well designed sample structures, nodal
superconducting pairings or complex magnetic order. In this work, we propose a
model that incorporates a Zeeman field, antiferromagnetic order, and $s$-wave
superconducting pairing, all without the need for spin-orbit interaction. In a
two-dimensional system, we realize a second-order topological superconductor by
utilizing a staggered flux, provided that the Zeeman field is oriented
perpendicular to the magnetic order moments. In three-dimensional systems, we
achieve second- and third-order topological superconductors in theory, through
stacking the two-dimensional second-order topological superconductor.

The influence of adding 23 nm NiO nanoparticles on the magnetic hysteresis
loops and critical current density of the high-temperature superconductor
YBa2Cu3O7-d has been investigated. The samples were prepared using a fast
annealing method that prevents chemical interaction between the components and
does not reduce the critical temperature of the superconductor. Compared to the
undoped YBCO sample, the critical current density increases in the samples
doped with NiO nanoparticles in magnetic fields greater than 6 kOe. The sample
containing 0.5 weight percent of NiO nanoparticles exhibits the greatest
enhancement in critical current density at 10 kOe (1.36 times greater than the
undoped sample).

### Herman-Kluk-Like Semi-Classical Initial-Value Representation for Boltzmann Operator

- **TL;DR**: 开发了Herman-Kluk类型的半经典初始值表示，用于玻尔兹曼算符的坐标矩阵元，解决了从实时传播子到虚时传播子转换时的高温发散问题。

The coherent-state initial-value representation (IVR) for the semi-classical
real-time propagator of a quantum system, developed by Herman and Kluk (HK), is
widely used in computational studies of chemical dynamics. On the other hand,
the Boltzmann operator $e^{-\hat{H}/(k_B T)}$, with $\hat{H}$,$k_B$, and $T$
representing the Hamiltonian, Boltzmann constant, and temperature,
respectively, plays a crucial role in chemical physics and other branches of
quantum physics. One might naturally assume that a semi-classical IVR for the
matrix element of this operator in the coordinate representation (i.e., $
\langle \tilde{x} | e^{-\hat{H}/(k_B T)} | x \rangle$, or the imaginary-time
propagator) could be derived via a straightforward ``real-time $\rightarrow$
imaginary-time transformation'' from the HK IVR of the real-time propagator.
However, this is not the case, as such a transformation results in a divergence
in the high-temperature limit $(T \rightarrow \infty)$. In this work, we solve
this problem and develop a reasonable HK-like semi-classical IVR for $\langle
\tilde{x} | e^{-\hat{H}/(k_B T)} | x \rangle$, specifically for systems where
the gradient of the potential energy (i.e., the force intensity) has a finite
upper bound. The integrand in this IVR is a real Gaussian function of the
positions $x$ and $\tilde{x}$, which facilitates its application to realistic
problems. Our HK-like IVR is exact for free particles and harmonic oscillators,
and its effectiveness for other systems is demonstrated through numerical
examples.

A triple perovskite oxide Ba$_{3}$MnTa$_{2}$O$_{9}$ has been synthesized and
its magnetic properties have been investigated through dc and ac magnetization,
specific heat, electron spin resonance (ESR) measurements, and density
functional theory (DFT) calculations. Mn$^{2+}$ ($S$ = 5/2) ions are the only
magnetic species present in the material. These Mn$^{2+}$ ions constitute a
quasi-two-dimensional triangular network in the crystallographic $ab$-plane.
Magnetization and specific heat measurements reveal the absence of any
long-range magnetic order down to 0.5\,K despite the presence of
antiferromagnetic correlations between the magnetic ions, suggesting the
presence of geometric frustration in the material. The entropy release is lower
than the expected theoretical value of $Rln(6)$, further suggesting the
presence of frustration. First-principles calculations using density functional
theory (DFT) and atomistic spin dynamics (ASD) simulations further support this
lack of static magnetic order even at low temperatures and identify the
competing magnetic interactions along with the quasi-2D magnetic dimensionality
as the underlying origin of such an unconventional magnetic behavior.

We report $^{23}$Na-NMR study on a candidate one-dimensional quantum spin
system NaO$_2$. The Knight shift, linewidth, and spin-lattice relaxation rate
$1/T_1$ were investigated down to 0.3 K under fields up to 16 T. The results
reveal the opening of a spin gap of $\Delta(10.1 {\rm T}) \simeq$ 38 K below
$T_{\rm S3} =$ 40 K, consistent with a spin-Peierls-like instability. The
hyperfine coupling constant was found to drop sharply across the structural
phase transition at $T_{\rm S2} =$ 215 K, highlighting the pronounced
one-dimensional character of the system. These findings establish NaO$_2$ as a
rare example of a $\pi$-orbital-based one-dimensional spin chain that exhibits
a spin-gapped ground state.

Altermagnets have garnered great interest due to their non-relativistic spin
splitting and novel physical properties. However, the control of altermagnetic
states remains underexplored. Here, we propose a new multiferroic state, i.e.
ferroelastic altermagnetic state, in which ferroelastic strain couples directly
to the spin-splitting. Through symmetry analysis and first-principles
calculations, we identify the ferroelastic $d$-wave altermagnetism of puckered
pentagonal CoSe$_2$ monolayer. Interestingly, uniaxial stress can induce a
ferroelastic phase transition, accompanied by a $90^\circ$ rotation of the
spin-splitting bands. Cooperative rotation of the lattice and N\'eel vectors
preserves the sign of Kerr angle, whereas noncooperative rotation reverses it.
Our work provides a general strategy for manipulating altermagnetism in
multiferroic systems and opens new avenues for exploring emergent
magnetoelastic phenomena.

### Electric field-induced spin-valley locking in twisted bilayer buckled honeycomb materials

- **TL;DR**: 扭曲双层硅烯和锗烯在电场作用下展现出量子谷霍尔效应，其中存在一个电场范围可实现自旋-谷锁定，提供更强的拓扑保护。

A twisted honeycomb bilayer exhibits a moir\'e superstructure that is
composed of a hexagonal arrangement of AB and BA stacked domains separated by
domain boundaries. In the case of twisted bilayer graphene, the application of
an electric field normal to the bilayer leads to the opening of inverted band
gaps in the AB and BA stacked domains. The inverted band gaps result in the
formation of a two-dimensional triangular network of counterpropagating valley
protected helical domain boundary states, also referred to as the quantum
valley Hall effect. Owing to spin-orbit coupling and buckling, the quantum
valley Hall effect in twisted bilayer silicene and germanene is more complex
than in twisted bilayer graphene. We found that there is a range of electric
fields for which the spin degree of freedom is locked to the valley degree of
freedom of the electrons in the quantum valley Hall states, resulting in a
stronger topological protection. For electric fields smaller than the
aforementioned range the twisted bilayer does not exhibit the quantum valley
Hall effect, whereas for larger electric fields the spin-valley locking is
lifted and the emergent quantum valley Hall states are only valley-protected.

### Quasiclassical theory of vortex states in locally non-centrosymmetric superconductors: application to CeRh$_{2}$As$_{2}$

CeRh$_{2}$As$_{2}$, a heavy fermion superconductor discovered in 2021,
exhibits two distinct superconducting phases under a $c$-axis magnetic field.
This unconventional phase diagram has been attributed to the local inversion
symmetry breaking at the Ce sites. At low magnetic fields, a conventional
even-parity spin-singlet superconducting state is realized, whereas at higher
fields, an odd-parity spin-singlet superconducting state, in which the order
parameter alternates sign between neighboring Ce layers, becomes stabilized. In
this study, we employ a quasiclassical approach to investigate the vortex
states of bilayer superconductors with locally broken inversion symmetry. We
calculate the local density of states (LDOS) in the vortex lattice state and
find that the pairing symmetry of different superconducting states is clearly
manifested in the peak structure of LDOS at the vortex core. Since LDOS is
experimentally observable, our work provides a pathway for experimental
verification of the superconducting parity transition in CeRh$_{2}$As$_{2}$.

We study the $S=1/2$ square-kagome lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet with
the trimarized modulation. In the trimerized limit, each trimer hosts the
four-fold degenearte ground states characterized by the spin and chirality
degrees of freedom. We find that, within the first-order perturbation theory
with respect to the inter-trimer coupling, the effective Hamiltonian is the
Kugel-Khomskii-type model on a Shastry-Sutherland lattice. Based on a
mean-field decoupling, we propose a dimer-covering ansatz for the effective
Hamiltonian; however, the validity of these states in the low-energy sector
remains an open question.

Halide perovskites have emerged as promising candidates for high-performance
solar cells. This study investigates the temperature-dependent optoelectronic
properties of mixed-cation mixed-halide perovskite solar cells using
electroluminescence (EL) and photoluminescence (PL) hyperspectral imaging,
along with current-voltage analysis. Luminescence images, which were converted
to EL and PL external radiative efficiency (ERE) maps, revealed significant
changes in the optoelectronic behavior of these devices at low temperatures.
Specifically, we found that a significant source of heterogeneity in the
low-temperature EL ERE maps below 240 K is related to local charge injection
and extraction bottlenecks, whereas PL ERE maps show suppressed non-radiative
recombination and significant improvements in efficiency throughout the
investigated temperature range. The spatial distribution of ERE and its
variation with applied current were analyzed, offering insights into
charge-carrier dynamics and defect behavior. Our results reveal that while the
perovskite layer exhibits enhanced ERE at low temperatures, charge injection
barriers at the interfaces of the perovskite solar cells significantly suppress
EL and degrade the fill factor below 240 K. These findings reveal that a deeper
understanding of the performance of perovskite solar cells under
low-temperature conditions is an essential step toward their potential
application in space power systems and advanced semiconductor devices.

Floquet engineering with high-frequency light offers dynamic control over
topological phases in quantum materials. While in 3D Dirac systems circularly
polarized light is known to induce topological phase transitions via gap
opening, linearly polarized light (LPL) has generally been considered
ineffective. Here we show that in quasi-2D Dirac materials the second-order
momentum term arising from the intersurface coupling can induce a topological
phase transition under LPL, leading to chiral edge channels. Considering an
ultrathin Bi$_2$Se$_3$ film as a representative system, we show that this
transition occurs at experimentally accessible light intensities. Our results
thus promote quasi-2D materials as viable platforms for light-controlled
topological phases, expanding the potential of Floquet topological engineering.

Superconducting altermagnets have proven to be a promising ground for
emergent phenomena but their study has involved two dimensional systems. In
this work, we investigate three-dimensional $d$- and $g$-wave altermagnets with
chiral $d$-wave superconductivity and show the formation of crossed surface
flat bands due to the underlying symmetries. We find that these crossed flat
bands appear at zero energy in the surface along $z$ due to the superconducting
nodal lines in the $xy$-plane, while the number of corners is determined by the
crystal symmetry of altermagnets. We also show that the superconducting nodal
lines give rise to Bogoliubov-Fermi surfaces, which then affect the appearance
of zero-energy arcs in the surface along $x$. Moreover, we demonstrate that the
crossed surface flat bands, surface arcs, and Bogoliubov-Fermi surfaces give
rise to distinct signals in charge conductance, hence offering a solid way for
their detection and paving the way for realizing higher dimensional topological
phases using altermagnets.

Efficient numerical routines are developed for numerical studies of the
dependence of the equilibrium magnetic states, excitations, and microwave power
absorption on temperature and composition in transition-metal/rare-earth
ferrites, including the reversal of the N\'eel vector occurring on both
temperature and the concentration of the rare-earth atoms. It results in a
drastic change in the behavior at the magnetization and angular-momentum
compensation points. Dominant uniform oscillation modes are obtained by
computing the magnetization correlation function. They are compared with the
analytical solution, which is analyzed in detail. The fluctuation-dissipation
theorem is used to compute the frequency dependence of the absorbed microwave
power. A good agreement with analytical results is demonstrated. Disorder
caused by random positions of rare-earth atoms in a diluted RE system leads to
multiple localized modes that converge into broad absorption maxima as the size
of the system increases. The power absorption integrated over frequency
exhibits a minimum at the compensation point.

This work provides a detailed mapping of various mechanisms of
surface-trap-induced gate leakage in GaN HEMTs across a temperature range from
room to cryogenic levels. Two-dimensional variable-range hopping is observed at
small gate bias. Under higher reverse gate bias, the leakage is dominated by
the Poole--Frenkel emission above 220 K, but gradually transitions to the
trap-assisted tunneling below 220 K owing to the frozen-trap effect. The trap
barrier height extracted from the gate leakage current under the upward gate
sweep is 0.65 V, which is 12\% higher than that from the downward sweep. The
gate leakage current as a function of the gate bias exhibits clockwise
hysteresis loops above 220 K but counterclockwise ones below 220 K. This
remarkable opposite hysteresis phenomenon is thoroughly explained by the trap
mechanisms.

- **TL;DR**: Fe掺杂CoSn实验中在kagome平带空穴掺杂时发现了一系列关联相，其中六重到二重旋转对称性破缺的向列相在宽掺杂和温度范围内占主导。研究通过自洽Hartree-Fock计算发现铁磁相和向列相之间的激烈竞争：在位相互作用有利于铁磁性，而较大的子晶格间相互作用在宽掺杂窗口内稳定了向列性。

Recent experiment on Fe-doped CoSn has uncovered a series of correlated
phases upon hole doping of the kagome flat bands. Among the phases observed, a
nematic phase with a six- to two-fold rotation symmetry breaking is found to
prevail over a wide doping and temperature range. Motivated by these
observations, we investigate the interaction-driven phases realized in a kagome
model with partially filled, weakly dispersing flat bands. Density-density
interactions up to second-nearest neighbors are considered. We identify a close
competition between ferromagnetic and nematic phases in our self-consistent
Hartree-Fock calculations: while on-site interaction favors ferromagnetism, the
sizable inter-sublattice interactions stabilize nematicity over a wide doping
window. Competition from translational-symmetry-breaking phases is also
considered. Overall, our results show that nematicity is a generic outcome of
partially filled kagome flat bands and establish a minimal framework for
understanding correlated flat-band phases.

Diamonds hosting color centers possess intrinsically high thermal
conductivity; therefore, laser-induced heating has often received little
attention. However, when placed on substrates with low thermal conductivity,
localized heating of diamonds under laser excitation can become significant,
and the presence of an interfacial polymer layer between substrate and diamond
further amplifies this effect. Yet, the relationship between substrate thermal
conductivity, polymer thickness, and laser heating remains to be established.
Here, a systematic investigation is presented on laser-induced heating of
silicon-vacancy diamond on substrates with varying thermal conductivity and
interfacial polymer thickness. Results reveal that even at a low excitation
power of 737~$\mu$W/$\mu$m$^2$, thin amorphous holey carbon -- the
lowest-conductivity substrate ($\sim$0.2~W~m$^{-1}$~K$^{-1}$) studied --
exhibits substantial heating, while glass ($\sim$1.4~W~m$^{-1}$~K$^{-1}$) and
polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS, $\sim$0.35~W~m$^{-1}$~K$^{-1}$) show noticeable
heating only above 2.95~mW/$\mu$m$^2$. For polymer interlayers, a thickness of
just 2.2~$\mu$m induces significant heating at 2.95~mW/$\mu$m$^2$ and above,
highlighting strong influence of both substrate and polymer thickness on local
heating response. Experimental findings are further validated using COMSOL
Multiphysics simulations with a steady-state 3D heat transfer model. These
results provide practical guidance for substrate selection and sample
preparation, enabling optimization of conditions for optical thermometry and
quantum sensing applications.

### The fate of disorder in twisted bilayer graphene near the magic angle

- **TL;DR**: 在扭曲双层石墨烯中，适度无序能增强平带系统的电导，而强无序则恢复局域化，揭示了无序驱动的退局域化-局域化输运行为。

In disordered lattices, itinerant electrons typically undergo Anderson
localization due to random phase interference, which suppresses their motion.
By contrast, in flat-band systems where electrons are intrinsically localized
owing to their vanishing group velocity, the role of disorder remains elusive.
Twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) at the magic angle $\sim 1.1^\circ$ provides a
representative flat-band platform to investigate this problem. Here, we perform
an atomistic tight-binding quantum transport calculation on the interplay
between disorder and flat-bands in TBG devices. This non-phenomenological
approach provides direct evidence that moderate disorder enhances conductance,
whereas stronger disorder restores localization, revealing a disorder-driven
delocalization-to-localization transport behavior. The underlying physical
mechanism is understood by an effective inter-moir{\'e} tunneling strength via
spectral flow analysis of a disordered TBG cylinder. Moreover, by comparing
magic-angle and large-angle TBG, we demonstrate qualitatively distinct disorder
responses tied to the presence of flat-bands. Our quantitative results
highlight the unconventional role of disorder in flat-band moir{\'e} materials
and offer insights into the observation of the fractional quantum anomalous
Hall effect in disordered moir{\'e} systems.

### Bosonic Laughlin and Moore-Read states from non-Chern flat bands

The rapid advances in the study of fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) raise a
fundamental question: while initially discovered in flat Chern bands motivated
by their topological equivalence to Landau levels, is single- particle band
topology actually a prerequisite for these many-body topological orders
emergent at fractional fillings? Here, we numerically demonstrate bosonic FCIs
in two types of non-Chern flat bands in honeycomb lattices, using exact
diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group calculations. In a
gapless flat band with a singular band touching, we observe a Laughlin state at
half filling, stabilized by onsite interactions from the hard-core limit down
to arbitrarily small strength. Furthermore, we report the first example of a
non- Abelian FCI in a non-Chern band system: a Moore-Read state at $\nu$ = 1
filling of the same singular flat band with hard-core bosons. Under lattice
parameters that realize a gapped trivial band (C = 0) of exact flatness, we
also find the Laughlin FCI of soft-core bosons in the isolated band limit where
onsite interaction is much smaller than the band gap. In this case, the FCI
forms as interacting bosons spontaneously avoid the peaks in quantum metric and
Berry curvature, preferentially occupying Brillouin zone region with relatively
uniform quantum geometry. Our work significantly expands the landscape for
(non-)Abelian FCIs and broadens the understanding of their formation beyond the
Chern band paradigm.

This paper presents a multiscale approach to evaluate perovskite solar cell
performance which determines material properties at the atomistic scale with
first-principles calculations, and applies them in macro-scale device models.
This work focuses on the MAPbI3 (MA = CH3NH3) perovskite and how its phase
transitions impact on its optical, electronic, and structural properties which
are investigated at the first-principles level. The obtained data are coupled
to a numerical drift-diffusion device model enabling evaluation of the
performance of corresponding single junction devices. The first-principles
simulation applies a hybrid exchange-correlation functional adapted to the
studied family of compounds. Validation by available experimental data is
presented from materials properties to device performance, justifying the use
of the approach for predictive evaluation of existing and novel perovskites.
The coupling between atomistic and device models is described in terms of a
framework for exchange of optical, vibrational, and electronic parameters
between the two scales. The result of this theoretical investigation is a
methodology for designing and optimising perovskite materials for both cell
performance and stability, the key obstacle in the societal implementation of
these record-breaking new materials.

### Precision of an autonomous demon exploiting nonthermal resources and information

- **TL;DR**: Error

Quantum-dot systems serve as nanoscale heat engines exploiting thermal
fluctuations to perform a useful task. Here, we investigate a multi-terminal
triple-dot system, operating as a refrigerator that extracts heat from a cold
electronic contact. In contrast to standard heat engines, this system exploits
a nonthermal resource. This has the intriguing consequence that cooling can
occur without extracting energy from the resource on average -- a seemingly
demonic action -- while, however, requiring the resource to fluctuate. Using
full counting statistics and stochastic trajectories, we analyze the
performance of the device in terms of the cooling-power precision, employing
performance quantifiers motivated by the thermodynamic and kinetic uncertainty
relations. We focus on two regimes with large output power, which are based on
two operational principles: exploiting information on one hand and the
nonthermal properties of the resource on the other. We show that these regimes
significantly differ in precision. In particular, the regime exploiting the
nonthermal properties of the resource can have cooling-power fluctuations that
are suppressed with respect to the input fluctuations by an order of magnitude.
We also substantiate the interpretation of the two different working principles
by analyzing cross-correlations between input and output heat currents and
information flow.

We report a systematic investigation of the physical properties and
Fermi-surface topology of layered single-crystal \ce{SrCu4As2} using electrical
transport, magnetotransport, and quantum-oscillation experiments plus
band-structure calculations. The temperature-dependent electrical resistivity
reveals a hysteretic phase transition at $T_P$ = 59 K, most likely associated
with a structural change. Hall resistivity data suggest a marked change in the
average hole density resulting from the latter phase transition near $T_P$. A
large, linear, and nonsaturating magnetoresistance is observed at low
temperatures in \ce{SrCu4As2}, likely attributable to the multipocket Fermi
surface. Quantum-oscillation data measured in magnetic fields of up to 60 T
show several oscillation frequencies exhibiting low effective masses,
indicating the presence of Dirac-like band dispersion in \ce{SrCu4As2}, as
suggested by the band structure calculations.

### First-Principles Approach to Spin Excitations in Noncollinear Magnetic Systems

We present a first-principles method based on density functional theory and
many-body perturbation theory for computing spin excitations in magnetic
systems with noncollinear spin textures. Traditionally, the study of magnetic
excitations has relied on spin models that assume magnetic moments to be
localized. Beyond this restriction, recent $ab~initio$ methods based on Green's
functions within the local spin-density approximation have emerged as a general
framework for calculating magnetic susceptibilities. However, their application
has so far been largely limited to collinear ferromagnetic and
antiferromagnetic systems. In this work, we extend this framework and enable
the treatment of large-scale noncollinear magnetic systems by leveraging a
Wannier-basis representation and implementing an ansatz potential method to
reduce computational cost. We apply our method to the spin-spiral state of
LiCu$_2$O$_2$, successfully capturing its steady-state spin-rotation pitch in
agreement with the experimental measurement and resolving the characteristic
magnon dispersion. We further analyze the interplay between the spiral spin
structure and the on-site spin-exchange splitting, and elucidate the crucial
role of magnetic dipoles on ligand ions in mediating effective ferromagnetic
interaction among the primary spins on Cu$^{2+}$ ions. Finally, we provide a
theoretical prediction of the magnon dispersion on top of the helical spin
background in high agreement with the experimental measurement. Overall, this
work establishes a general and computationally efficient framework for
simulating collective spin dynamics in noncollinear magnetic systems from first
principles, exemplified by -- but not limited to -- spin-spiral states.

Magnetic skyrmions extended to three dimensions form string-like objects
whose fundamental role remains largely unexplored. We show that skyrmion
strings can terminate on a N\'eel-type domain wall (DW), realizing a magnetic
analogue of a Dirichlet(D)-brane soliton. While an isolated N\'eel DW tends to
rotate into a Bloch DW, the N\'eel DW is stabilized when a skyrmion string ends
on it. Unlike field-theory D-branes, the Bloch-type DMI produces linear rather
than logarithmic DW bending, and the strings retain finite width far from the
DW, circumventing singular behavior. Furthermore, the repulsive interaction
between strings allows periodic multi-junction solutions, yielding a square
lattice of alternating strings and local DW deformations. These results
establish magnetic skyrmion strings as fundamental strings that can end on a
D-brane.

Quantum Fisher information (QFI) is a novel measure of multipartite quantum
entanglement that can be measured in inelastic neutron scattering experiments
on quantum magnets. In this work, we demonstrate that the QFI can be used to
understand the thermal and dynamical properties of quantum magnets by focusing
on the pyrochlore lattice model of quantum spin ice (QSI), a three-dimensional
quantum spin liquid that hosts fractionalized quasiparticles and emergent
photons. We use the newly developed multi-directed loop update quantum Monte
Carlo (QMC) algorithm and exact diagonalization (ED) to compute the QFI, which
is further utilized to calibrate the gauge mean-field theory results. We show
that the temperature and momentum dependence of the QFI can reveal
characteristic energy scales of distinct phases and phase transitions in the
global phase diagram. In particular, the QFI can clearly distinguish the
ferromagnetic ordered phase, the thermal critical region above it, as well as
two distinct QSI phases, namely zero-flux and $\pi$-flux QSI. Moreover, the QFI
shows two crossover temperature scales, one from the trivial paramagnet to the
classical spin ice regime and a lower temperature crossover to QSI. We discuss
our results, especially for the $\pi$-flux QSI, in light of the ongoing
experimental efforts on Cerium-based pyrochlore systems. Our results
demonstrate that the QFI not only detects entanglement properties but can also
be viewed as a sensitive thermal and dynamical probe in the investigation of
quantum magnets.

Although ferroelectric systems inherently exhibit binary switching behavior,
recent advances in analog memory device have spurred growing interest in
achieving continuous memory states. In this work, we demonstrate ferroelectric
amplitude switching at the mesoscopic scale in compositionally graded
Ba1-xSrxTiO3 heterostructures, enabling continuous modulation of polarization
magnitude without altering its direction, which we defined as amplitude
switching. Using switching current measurement, piezoresponse force microscopy
and Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire simulations, we reveal that compositionally
graded ferroelectric heterostructure can possess amplitude switching behavior
through a double well potential with flattened minima. This behavior supports
stable, continuous polarization states and establishes a new platform for
analog memory applications. These findings introduce amplitude switching as a
new dynamic of the order parameter, paving the way for energy-efficient and
reliable analog memory systems.

Exciton-phonon interactions govern the energy level spectrum and thus the
optical response in semiconductors. In this respect, lead-halide perovskite
nanocrystals represent a unique system, for which the interaction with optical
phonons is particularly strong, giving rise to a ladder of multiple exciton
states which can be optically excited with femtosecond pulses. We establish a
new regime of coherent exciton-polaron dynamics with exceptionally long
coherence times (T2 ~300 ps) in an ensemble of CsPbI3 nanocrystals embedded in
a glass matrix. Using transient two-pulse photon echo at 2 K temperature, we
observe quantum beats between the exciton-polaron states. Within a four-level
model, we directly quantify the exciton-phonon coupling strength through the
Huang-Rhys factors of 0.05-0.1 and 0.02-0.04 for low-energy optical phonons
with energies of 3.2 and 5.1 meV, respectively. The pronounced size dependence
of both coupling strengths and phonon lifetimes offers a path to tune the
optical transitions between polaron states and to tailor the coherent optical
dynamics in perovskite semiconductors for solid-state quantum technologies.

Using Mott insulators as a prototypical example, we demonstrate a
dynamics-based characterization of quantum phases of matter through a general
N-body renormalization group framework. The essential "Mott-ness" turns out to
be characterized by a change of size-scaling of the effective intra- momentum
repulsions between long-lived emergent "eigen-particles" that encodes the
dynamics of two-body bound states in the high-energy sector. This directly
offers a universal characterization at long space-time scale for the
corresponding class of Mott insulators through a uniform single occupation of
all momenta, and otherwise Mott metals. This universal description naturally
paves the way to topological Mott insulators and is straightforward to extend
to bosonic Mott systems. More generally, this demonstration exemplifies a
generic paradigm of characterizing quantum phases of matter through their
distinct dynamics beyond broken symmetries.

Deterministic placement of single dopants is essential for scalable quantum
devices based on group-V donors in silicon. We demonstrate a non-destructive,
high-efficiency method for detecting individual ion implantation events using
secondary electrons (SEs) in a focused ion beam (FIB) system. Using low-energy
Sb ions implanted into undoped silicon, we achieve up to 98% single-ion
detection efficiency, verified by calibrated ion-current measurements before
and after implantation. The technique attains ~30 nm spatial resolution without
requiring electrical contacts or device fabrication, in contrast to
ion-beam-induced-current (IBIC) methods. We find that introducing a controlled
SiO2 capping layer significantly enhances SE yield, consistent with an
increased electron mean free path in the oxide, while maintaining high
probability of successful ion deposition in the underlying substrate. The yield
appears to scale with ion velocity, so higher projectile mass (e.g. Yb, Bi etc)
requires increased energy to maintain detection efficiency. Our approach
provides a robust and scalable route to precise donor placement and extends
deterministic implantation strategies to a broad range of material systems and
quantum device architectures.

We investigate quantum and quantum-relativistic effects associated with the
noise power spectrum and the fluctuation--dissipation relation between
current--noise spectra and linear--response conductance at low frequencies of
the electromagnetic field. At high frequencies, vacuum catastrophe is shown to
be avoided by the presence of Casimir force. At low frequencies, the quantum
effect associated with one--dimensional structures under the conditions of
ballistic transport typical at the nanometric scale length are briefly reviewed
in terms of a universal quasi-particle approach. The case of a photon gas
inside an appropriate black-body cavity is found to provide a physical
interpretation of the lines spectra of atomic elements within an exact
statistical approach based on a physical interpretation of the fine structure

- **TL;DR**: 该论文研究了基于自旋轨道力矩的平面电流诱导磁化开关，通过在(Ta或W)/CoFeB/Pt三层异质结构中诱导面内单轴磁各向异性，实现了亚微秒电流脉冲下的磁化反转，开关电流密度低至2×10¹¹ A/m²。

Planar current-induced magnetization switching (CIMS) driven by spin-orbit
torque (SOT) requires an in-plane uniaxial magnetic anisotropy (UMA), which can
be induced by oblique-angle sputter deposition of the heavy-metal underlayer.
To enhance the SOT efficiency, we employ trilayer heterostructures of (Ta or
W)/CoFeB/Pt, where the bottom layer exhibits a UMA of 50 mT at 2 nm thickness.
The magnetization reversal in Hall-bar devices is detected through
unidirectional spin Hall magnetoresistance (USMR) for the Type Y geometry (easy
axis transverse to current) and planar Hall measurements for the Type X
geometry (easy axis parallel to current). Both configurations exhibit CIMS with
sub-microsecond current pulses, reaching switching current densities as low as
$2 \times 10^{11}$ A/m$^2$ for a W (4 nm)/CoFeB (1.4 nm)/Pt (2 nm) stack with a
UMA of 146 mT. Macrospin simulations reproduce the Type Y switching as coherent
magnetization rotation, whereas the Type X devices switch at much lower
currents than predicted, indicating that nucleation and domain-wall propagation
dominate reversal in this geometry.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种新的界面散射机制来解释金属/铁磁体双层结构中的各向异性磁阻效应，无需依赖体自旋或轨道霍尔电流，与传统的自旋霍尔磁阻机制有本质区别。

We introduce a minimal interface-scattering mechanism that produces a sizable
anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) in metal/ferromagnet bilayers (e.g.,
Pt/YIG) without invoking bulk spin or orbital Hall currents. In a
$\delta$-layer model with interfacial exchange and Rashba spin-orbit coupling,
charge transfer at a high-quality interface creates a spin-selective phase
condition (interfacial spin filtering) that suppresses backscattering for one
spin projection while enhancing momentum relaxation for the other. The
resulting resistance anisotropy peaks at an optimal metal thickness of a few
nanometers, quantitatively reproducing the thickness and angular dependences
typically attributed to spin Hall magnetoresistance (SMR), as well as its
characteristic magnitude. Remarkably, the maximal AMR scales linearly with the
smaller of the two coupling strengths - exchange or spin-orbit, highlighting a
mechanism fundamentally distinct from SMR. Our scattering formulation maps onto
Boltzmann boundary conditions and predicts other clear discriminants from SMR,
including strong sensitivity to interfacial charge transfer and disorder.

We report persistent photoconductivity in $p$-type Sb$_2$Se$_3$ single
crystals doped with Cd or Zn, where enhanced conductivity remains for hours
after illumination ceases at temperatures below $\sim$25~K. Comparative
transport and infrared absorption measurements, including on $n$-type Cl-doped
counterparts, reveal strong indications that hole transport in Sb$_2$Se$_3$ is
more strongly affected by intrinsic carrier scattering than electron transport.
These results point to a fundamental asymmetry in charge carrier dynamics and
highlight the potential role of polaronic effects in limiting hole mobility in
this quasi-one-dimensional semiconductor.

### Electron transport in junctions between altermagnets

We theoretically investigate electron transport in junctions between the two
AMs in strong and weak altermagnetic phases. The charge and spin conductivities
are analyzed as functions of angle between the N\'eel vectors of the two AMs
$\theta$. In the strong AM regime, the charge conductivity vanishes as $\theta
\to \pi$, while in the weak AM phase it remains finite. Introducing a normal
metal between two AMs leads to Fabry-P\'erot-type oscillations in charge
conductivity. In the strong phase, transport is dominated by up-spin electrons,
whereas both spin channels contribute in the weak phase. These results
highlight the potential of AM-based heterostructures for spintronic
applications, such as spin filters, and quantum interference-based spintronic
devices, where tunable spin-dependent transport and interference effects can be
utilized in electronic devices.

Orbital magnetization (OM) in Sierpinski carpet (SC) and triangle (ST)
fractal is theoretically investigated by using Haldane model as a prototypical
example. The OM calculation is performed following two distinct approaches;
employing the definition and local markers formalism. Both methods coincides
for all systems analyzed. For the SC, higher fractal generations create a dense
set of edge states, resulting in a staircase profile, leading to oscillations
in the magnetization as a function of the chemical potential. In contrast, the
ST self-similarity produces distinct fractal-induced spectral gaps, which
manifest as constant plateaus in the magnetization. The STs exhibit a
pronounced sensitivity to edge terminations. Our results reveal how quantum
confinement in fractal structures affects the electronic orbital angular
momentum, pointing to possible pathways for exploring novel orbitronics in
systems with complex geometries.

### Electric field controlled second-order anomalous Hall effect in altermagnets

Altermagnets are a recently discovered class of compensated magnets with
momentum-dependent spin splittings and unusual transport properties, even
without a net magnetization. In the presence of combined four-fold rotation and
time-reversal ($C_4\mathcal{T}$) symmetry, linear and also second-order, driven
by a Berry curvature dipole, anomalous Hall responses are forbidden in any pure
$d$-wave altermagnet. Nevertheless, here we find that the nontrivial quantum
metric of the occupied Bloch states allows for an electric field induced Berry
curvature dipole, which generates a strong and tunable second-order Hall
current, enabling it to be switched on or off by simply adjusting the relative
orientation between the symmetry-reducing dc field and the ac probe field.
Specifically, we investigate the electric field induced second-order anomalous
Hall response in a two-dimensional Rashba-coupled hybrid altermagnet that
interpolates between $d_{x^2-y^2}$ ($B_{1g}$) and $d_{xy}$ ($B_{2g}$)
altermagnet symmetry, motivated by recent proposals for mixed-symmetry states.
Crucially, the nonlinear signal is highly sensitive to the underlying symmetry
of the altermagnetic order at specific doping levels, offering a purely
electrical method to distinguish distinct altermagnetic orders. Our results
position hybrid altermagnets as a promising platform for controllable nonlinear
transport and spintronic applications.

### Substitutional sulfur and its vibrational fingerprints in Sb$_2$Se$_3$

- **TL;DR**: 通过红外吸收光谱和密度泛函理论研究Sb2Se3中硫的构型行为，识别出四个硫相关局域振动模式，证实硫在三个不等价硒位点上的取代行为。

The configurational behavior of sulfur in antimony triselenide (Sb$_2$Se$_3$)
is investigated by combining infrared absorption spectroscopy with density
functional theory. Four sulfur-related local vibrational modes are identified
at 249, 273, 283, and 312~cm$^{-1}$ in melt-grown single crystals prepared from
Sb$_2$Se$_3$ granulate. Their assignment to sulfur is confirmed through
controlled indiffusion experiments using Sb$_2$S$_3$ and elemental sulfur, as
well as isotope-substitution studies with $^{34}$S, which produce the expected
frequency shifts. Polarization-resolved measurements, together with theoretical
calculations of local vibrational modes, demonstrate that the observed spectral
features are fully consistent with substitutional sulfur on the three
inequivalent selenium sites of Sb$_2$Se$_3$.

We investigate the driven dynamics of a single skyrmion in a square lattice
of mixed pinning sites, where attractive and repulsive defects coexist using a
particle-based model. The mixed landscape yields directional locking at
$\theta_{\rm sk}=-45^\circ$ and flow at locked angles near the intrinsic
skyrmion Hall angle. By mapping defect strengths, we show that weaker
attraction lowers the depinning threshold, whereas stronger repulsion
stabilizes and broadens the $-45^\circ$ locking plateau. Moreover, combinations
of attractive and repulsive defect strengths allows control of directional
lockings and their force ranges. Defect size further tunes the response,
selecting among $-45^\circ$, $-50^\circ$, $-55^\circ$, and $\approx-59^\circ$.
These results establish mixed pinning as a practical knob to steer skyrmion
trajectories and the effective Hall response, providing design guidelines for
skyrmion-based memory and logic devices.

### Unique Hierarchical Rotational Dynamics Induces Ultralow Lattice Thermal Conductivity in Cyanide-bridged Framework Materials

The pursuit of materials combining light constituent elements with ultralow
lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_{\mathrm{L}}$) is crucial to advancing
technologies like thermoelectrics and thermal barrier coatings, yet it remains
a formidable challenge to date. Herein, we achieve ultralow
$\kappa_{\mathrm{L}}$ in lightweight cyanide-bridged framework materials (CFMs)
through the rational integration of properties such as the hierarchical
vibrations exhibited in superatomic structures and rotational dynamics
exhibited in perovskites. Unique hierarchical rotation behavior leads to
multiple negative peaks in Gr\"uneisen parameters across a wide frequency
range, thereby inducing pronounced negative thermal expansion and strong cubic
anharmonicity in CFMs. Meanwhile, the synergistic effect between large
four-phonon scattering phase space (induced by phonon quasi-flat bands and wide
bandgaps) and strong quartic anharmonicity (associated with rotation modes)
leads to giant quartic anharmonic scattering rates in these materials.
Consequently, the $\kappa_{\mathrm{L}}$ of these CFMs decreases by one to two
orders of magnitude compared to the known perovskites or perovskite-like
materials with equivalent average atomic masses. For instance, the
Cd(CN)$_{2}$, NaB(CN)$_{4}$, LiIn(CN)$_{4}$, and AgX(CN)$_{4}$ (X = B, Al, Ga,
In) exhibit ultralow room-temperature $\kappa_{\mathrm{L}}$ values ranging from
0.35 to 0.81 W/mK. This work not only establishes CFMs as a novel and rich
platform for studying extreme phonon anharmonicity, but also provides a new
paradigm for achieving ultralow thermal conductivity in lightweight materials
via the conscious integration of hierarchical and rotational dynamics.

Peculiarities of formation of inclusions of amorphous Si (a-Si) phase in
Si-rich Si oxynitride films grown by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition
(PECVD) are studied by combined Raman scattering and infrared (IR) absorption
spectroscopy. The Raman scattering results identify presence of a-Si phase in
the studied films at the relative Si content exceeding a threshold value of
about 0.4. The a-Si amount correlates with the concentration of hydrogen in the
films, the presence of which is detected by characteristic IR absorption bands
corresponding to Si-H bending (about 660 cm-1) and stretching (a composite band
in the range of about 1900-2400 cm-1) vibrations. The method of deconvolution
of IR absorbance spectra in the range of about 600 to 1300 cm-1 developed
earlier is used to reliably separate the IR band at about 660 cm-1. This band
is identified to origin from the amorphous Si phase within the studied Si
oxynitride films. This makes it possible to propose IR spectroscopy with
analysis of the low-wavenumber part of the spectra as an efficient method of
identifying phase composition of Si-rich Si oxynitride films. The obtained
results contribute to understanding of the regularities of formation of phase
compositions of PECVD grown Si oxynitride films and are useful for controlling
the films properties for practical applications.
