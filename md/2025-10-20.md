- **TL;DR**: 在拓扑平庸的莫尔能带中，通过长程库仑相互作用和量子几何不均匀性，可以出现分数陈绝缘体，展现出分数霍尔电导和Laughlin-like行为，表明多体拓扑序可以独立于单粒子能带拓扑而出现。

The discovery of zero-field fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) in moir\'e
materials has attracted intense interest in the interplay between topology and
correlations. Here, we demonstrate that fractionalized topological order can
emerge under realistic conditions even within a topologically trivial moir\'e
band. By projecting long-range Coulomb interactions into a trivial band of
twisted multilayer graphene, we identify a set of incompressible FCI ground
states exhibiting fractional quantized Hall conductance. Their Laughlin-like
behavior is further confirmed through the particle-cut entanglement spectrum.
We trace the origin of this phase to the strongly inhomogeneous distribution of
quantum geometry within the moir\'e Brillouin zone, which reshapes interaction
effects independently of the band topology. Extending this heuristic quantum
geometric mechanism, we demonstrate that similarly unexpected Laughlin-like
FCIs can also be stabilized in higher-Chern-number moir\'e bands under
experimentally accessible conditions. Our results establish realistic scenarios
under which many-body topological order can emerge independently of
single-particle band topology.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文研究了菱面体六层石墨烯中莫尔转角对拓扑性质的影响，发现转角小于1.1度时在填充因子v=1处形成整数陈绝缘体，而v=2/3处的分数陈绝缘体需要更小的转角。研究推翻了现有的平均场理论范式。

Rhombohedral multilayer graphene has emerged as a powerful platform for
investigating flat-band-driven correlated phenomena, yet most aspects remain
not understood. In this work, we systematically study the moire-dependent band
topology in rhombohedral hexalayer graphene. For the first time we demonstrate
that the moire twist angle plays a crucial role in the formation of the moire
Chern insulators in rhombohedral hexalayer graphene/hexagonal boron nitride
(RHG/hBN) moire superlattices. In the moire-distant regime at filling factor v
= 1, only systems with a twist angle {\theta} &lt; 1.1{\deg} exhibit an integer
moire Chern insulator, while the fractional Chern insulator at v = 2/3 requires
smaller twist angle to be stabilized. Our theoretical modelling, which includes
quantum fluctuations and exact diagonalization results, suggests that
mean-field theory, which has been widely adopted, does not explain the
twist-angle dependence of the v = 1 phase diagram, and that correlation effects
are crucial. Moreover, we realize two distinct stacking configurations ( /Xi=0
and /Xi=1) between graphene and hBN, and find that both cases can yield a Chern
insulator at v = 1. Our experimental work upends the current mean-field
paradigm, illuminates how quantum fluctuations and moir\'e effects shape the
RHG/hBN phase diagram, and paves the way for future understanding and
engineering of topological correlated states in rhombohedral graphene moire
systems.

### Altermagnetism induced surface Chern insulator

- **TL;DR**: 提出通过耦合反铁磁体和拓扑晶体绝缘体实现量子反常霍尔效应的新途径，使用RuO2/SnTe异质结构作为示例，展示了7meV的狄拉克表面态能隙和有限反常霍尔效应。

We propose a new pathway to the quantized anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) by
coupling an altermagnet to a topological crystalline insulator (TCI). The
former gaps the topological surface states of the TCI, thereby realizing the
QAHE in a robust and switchable platform with near- vanishing magnetization. We
demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by studying a slab of the TCI SnTe
coupled to an altermagnetic RuO2 layer. Our first-principles calculations
reveal that the d-wave altermagnetism in RuO2 induces a 7 meV gap to the Dirac
surface states on the (110) surface of SnTe, producing a finite anomalous Hall
effect. Our approach generalizes to broader classes of altermagnetic materials
and TCIs, thereby providing a family of topological altermagnetic
heterostructures with small or vanishing magnetization that support nontrivial
Chern numbers. Our results highlight a promising new topological platform with
great tunability and applications to spintronics.

### Gate-tunable Josephson diodes in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene

- **TL;DR**: 在魔角扭曲双层石墨烯中测量了两个相邻的约瑟夫森结，发现它们都表现出显著的门电压可调谐约瑟夫森二极管效应，这种效应由大动态电感和非均匀超电流分布共同导致。

We report low-temperature measurements of two adjacent, gate-defined
Josephson junctions (JJs) in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) at a
moir\'e filling factor near $\nu = -2$. We show that both junctions exhibit a
prominent, gate-tunable Josephson diode effect, which we explain by a
combination of large kinetic inductance and non-uniform supercurrent
distribution. Despite their proximity, the JJs display differences in their
interference patterns and different diode behavior, underscoring that
microscopic inhomogeneities such as twist angle variations shape the
non-uniform supercurrent and drive the diode behavior. As a result, the
nonreciprocal supercurrent can be tuned by gate voltage, enabling tuning of the
diode efficiency and even reversing the polarity at fixed magnetic fields. Our
findings offer potential routes for tailoring Josephson diode performance in
superconducting quantum circuits.

### Superconductivity suppression and bilayer decoupling in Pr substituted YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-δ}$

- **TL;DR**: 通过ARPES和DFT+U计算，研究发现Pr替代YBCO中的Y不会形成f电子杂化或新态，而是通过间接电子释放途径导致CuO2双层解耦和增强CuO链跳跃，从而抑制超导性，挑战了传统的FR/LM机制。

The mechanism behind superconductivity suppression induced by Pr
substitutions in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ (YBCO) has been a mystery since
its discovery: in spite of being isovalent to Y$^{3+}$ with a small magnetic
moment, it is the only rare-earth element that has a dramatic impact on YBCO's
superconducting properties. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
(ARPES) and DFT+$U$ calculations, we uncover how Pr substitution modifies the
low-energy electronic structure of YBCO. Contrary to the prevailing
Fehrenbacher-Rice (FR) and Liechtenstein-Mazin (LM) models, the low energy
electronic structure contains no signature of any $f$-electron hybridization or
new states. Yet, strong electron doping is observed primarily on the
antibonding Fermi surface. Meanwhile, we reveal major electronic structure
modifications to Cu-derived states with increasing Pr substitution: a
pronounced CuO$_2$ bilayer decoupling and an enhanced CuO chain hopping,
implying indirect electron-release pathways beyond simple 4$f$ state
ionization. Our results challenge the long-standing FR/LM mechanism and
establish Pr substituted YBCO as a potential platform for exploring
correlation-driven phenomena in coupled 1D-2D systems.

### Nano-electronvolt Fourier-limited transition of a single surface-adsorbed molecule

High-resolution spectroscopy allows one to probe weak interactions and to
detect subtle phenomena. While such measurements are routinely performed on
atoms and molecules in the gas phase, spectroscopy of adsorbed species on
surfaces is faced with challenges. As a result, previous studies of
surface-adsorbed molecules have fallen short of the ultimate resolution, where
the transition linewidth is determined by the lifetime of the excited state. In
this work, we conceive a new approach to surface deposition and report on
Fourier-limited electronic transitions in single dibenzoterrylenes adsorbed
onto the surface of an anthracene crystal. By performing spectroscopy and
super-resolution microscopy at liquid helium temperature, we shed light on
various properties of the adsorbed molecules. Our experimental results pave the
way for a new class of experiments in surface science, where high spatial and
spectral resolution can be combined.

### Entanglement Entropy from Correlation Functions of Scalar Fields in and out of Equilibrium

- **TL;DR**: 本文提出了一种计算奇阶Rényi熵的新方法，通过引入复制系统间的二次耦合来替代边界场匹配条件，适用于平衡和非平衡态、封闭和开放量子系统。

We show that odd order R\'enyi entropies $S^{(2q+1)}$ of a system of
interacting scalar fields can be calculated as the free energy of $2q+1$
replicas of the system with additional quadratic inter-replica couplings in the
subsystem at the time of measurement of the entropy. These couplings replace
boundary field matching conditions. This formalism works both in and out of
thermal equilibrium, for closed as well as open quantum systems, and provides a
general dictionary between measurable correlation functions and entanglement
entropy. $S^{(2q+1)}$ can be analytically continued to calculate the von
Neumann entropy $S^{\mathrm{vN}}$. We provide an exact formula relating
$S^{(2q+1)}$ and $S^{\mathrm{vN}}$ with correlation functions in a
non-interacting theory. For interacting theories, we provide rules for
constructing all possible Feynman diagrams for $S^{(2q+1)}$. We show that the
boundary matching conditions cannot be completely eliminated while calculating
R\'enyi entropies of even order due to presence of zero modes in replica space.

### Incorporating Si into Sb2Se3: Tailoring Optical Phase Change Materials via Nanocomposites

- **TL;DR**: 通过磁控共溅射研究Si掺杂对Sb2Se3的影响，发现20% Si掺杂可提高材料在非晶态和晶态下的透明度窗口（至800nm），降低熔化温度从而减少功耗，但会降低相变折射率对比度和减慢相变动力学。

Chalcogenide-based optical phase change materials (OPCMs) exhibit a large
contrast in refractive index when reversibly switched between their stable
amorphous and crystalline states. OPCMs have rapidly gained attention due to
their versatility as nonvolatile amplitude or phase modulators in various
photonic devices. However, open challenges remain, such as achieving reliable
response and transparency spanning into the visible spectrum, a combination of
properties in which current broadband OPCMs (e.g., Ge2Sb2Se4Te1, Sb2Se3, or
Sb2S3) fall short. Discovering novel materials or engineering existing ones is,
therefore, crucial in extending the application scope of OPCMs. Here, we use
magnetron co-sputtering to study the effects of Si doping into Sb2Se3. We
employ ellipsometry, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and scanning and
transmission electron microscopy to investigate the effects of Si doping on the
optical properties and crystal structure and compare these results with those
from first principles calculations. Moreover, we study the crystallization and
melt-quenching of thin films via nano-differential scanning calorimetry
(NanoDSC). Our experiments demonstrate that 20% Si doping increases the
transparency window in both states, specifically to 800 nm (1.55 eV) in the
amorphous phase, while reducing power consumption by lowering the melting
temperature. However, this reduction comes at the cost of reducing the
refractive index contrast between states and slowing the kinetics of the phase
transition.

### Reconstructing Spin Hamiltonians of 2D Gutzwiller-Projected Wavefunctions

- **TL;DR**: 应用相关矩阵哈密顿量重构技术分析二维Gutzwiller投影费米海和π-通量态，发现有限尺寸系统中不存在简单局域相互作用的自旋哈密顿量能稳定这些态。

We apply the correlation matrix Hamiltonian reconstruction technique to the
two-dimensional Gutzwiller-projected Fermi sea and {\pi}-flux states on
finite-sized square and triangular lattices. Our results indicate no spin
Hamiltonian with simple local interaction terms stabilizes such states for
finite system sizes. We develop a quantitative assessment of the importance of
local interactions to the stabilization of these liquid states. Lastly, we
systematically assess arguments for the origin of local terms driving a
Gutzwiller-projected ground state.

### Random walk models of anisotropic diffusion on rectangular and hexagonal lattices

- **TL;DR**: 提出了几种等效的随机游走模型来模拟各向异性介质中的扩散过程，使用矩形和六边形网格，通过有限体积法和时间离散化得到转移概率的解析表达式。

The diffusive transport of particles in anisotropic media is a fundamental
phenomenon in computational, medical and biological disciplines. While
deterministic models (partial differential equations) of such processes are
well established, their inability to capture inherent randomness, and the
assumption of a large number of particles, hinders their applicability. To
address these issues, we present several equivalent (discrete-space
discrete-time) random walk models of diffusion described by a
spatially-invariant tensor on a two-dimensional domain with no-flux boundary
conditions. Our approach involves discretising the deterministic model in space
and time to give a homogeneous Markov chain governing particle movement between
(spatial) lattice sites over time. The spatial discretisation is carried out
using a vertex-centred element-based finite volume method on rectangular and
hexagonal lattices, and a forward Euler discretisation in time yields a
nearest-neighbour random walk model with simple analytical expressions for the
transition probabilities. For each lattice configuration, analysis of these
expressions yields constraints on the time step duration, spatial steps and
diffusion tensor to ensure the probabilities are between zero and one. We find
that model implementation on a rectangular lattice can be achieved with a
constraint on the diffusion tensor, whereas a hexagonal lattice overcomes this
limitation (no restrictions on the diffusion tensor). Overall, the results
demonstrate good visual and quantitative (mean-squared error) agreement between
the deterministic model and random walk simulations for several test cases. All
results are obtained using MATLAB code available on GitHub
(https://github.com/lukefilippini/Filippini2025).

### Topological Magnetic Phases and Magnon-Phonon Hybridization in the Presence of Strong Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction

- **TL;DR**: 该论文研究了强DMI（Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya相互作用）驱动下二维磁性系统中的拓扑磁相和磁子-声子杂化现象，揭示了从铁磁态到非共线/非共面自旋结构的相变，以及由此产生的多种拓扑相和杂化拓扑能带。

In recent years, the interplay between quantum magnetism and topology has
attracted growing interest, both for its fundamental importance and its
technological potential. Topological magnons, quantized spin excitations with
nontrivial band topology, hold particular promise for spintronics, offering
routes to robust, low-dissipation devices for next-generation information
processing and storage. While topological magnons in honeycomb ferromagnets
with weak next-nearest-neighbor Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions (DMI) have
been extensively investigated, the strong-DMI regime remains largely
unexplored. In this work, we examine topological magnetic phases and
magnon-phonon hybridization in a two-dimensional magnetic system with strong
DMI. We show that strong DMI drives a transition from a ferromagnetic ground
state to a 120$^\circ$ noncollinear order. An additional Zeeman field further
induces noncoplanar spin textures, giving rise to a diverse set of topological
phases. We demonstrate that these topological phases can be directly probed
through the anomalous thermal Hall effect. Finally, we find that the spin-spin
interactions in the strong-$D$ phase enable magnon-phonon coupling that yields
hybridized topological bands, whereas such coupling vanishes in the weak-$D$
phase.

### Diode effect in Shapiro steps in an asymmetric SQUID with a superconducting nanobridge

- **TL;DR**: 在非对称SQUID中观察到弱约瑟夫森二极管效应，但在交流微波辐照下出现强Shapiro台阶不对称性，这源于正弦和多值电流-相位关系的相互作用。

We investigate the Josephson diode effect in an asymmetric SQUID consisting
of a sinusoidal Josephson junction formed by a Bi$_2$Te$_2$Se flake and a
superconducting Nb nanobridge with a linear and multivalued current-phase
relation (CPR). Current-voltage characteristics were measured both in the
absence (dc regime) and presence (ac regime) of external microwave irradiation.
Our dc measurements reveal only weak critical current asymmetry (i.e. weak
Josephson diode effect), while confirming the multivalued behavior of the
SQUID. At the same time, the key finding of this work is the observation of
strong Shapiro step asymmetry (concerning the dc current direction) in the ac
regime at finite magnetic flux. This peculiarity oscillates as a function of
magnetic field with the SQUID's periodicity and varies non-monotonically with
the increase in microwave power. Our theoretical model shows that the
pronounced Shapiro step asymmetry, despite the small diode effect in critical
current, arises from the interplay between the sinusoidal and multivalued CPRs
of the junctions.

### Helical orbitals in electrical uni-directional molecular motors

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种基于电子通过螺旋轨道产生单向旋转的分子马达机制，建立了螺旋性与旋转方向的关系，并发现了亚晶格对称性导致旋转方向与电流方向无关的独特性质。

The generation of unidirectional motion has been a long-standing challenge in
engineering of molecular motors. Here, a mechanism driving the rotation is
presented based on electron current through helical orbitals on a $\pi$-bonded
carbon chain. Such electron current through helical orbitals has been shown to
be circulating around the carbon chain. It is natural to expect that the
associated electronic angular momentum drives a rotation when the current is
turned on. As intuitive as this relation might seem, it is also incomplete
because a formal definition of helicality in terms of a physical observable has
not yet been given. Such a definition is proposed here. Based on this
definition, we show how helicality determines the motor's sense of rotation. We
exemplify the relation between helicality and angular momentum in H\"uckel
models of linear carbon chains (cumulenes and oligoynes). We attribute the
previously reported opposite helicality sense of frontier orbitals (HOMO and
LUMO) to the approximate sub-lattice symmetry. For oligoynes, this symmetry is
hidden in the sense that it does not reduce to a mere labeling of atoms.
Sub-lattice symmetry, combined with time-reversal invariance, allows us to
derive Onsager-type reciprocal relations of various linear response
coefficients, dictating e.g. an odd energy dependence of angular momentum
response to voltage bias. We propose an observable consequence of the
approximate sub-lattice symmetry: If the carbon chain is employed as an axle of
a molecular rotor, the sense of rotation is independent on the direction of the
current.

### Cluster percolation and dynamical scaling in the Baxter--Wu model

We investigate the percolation behavior of Fortuin-Kasteleyn--type clusters
in the spin-$1/2$ Baxter--Wu model with three-spin interactions on a triangular
lattice. The considered clusters are constructed by randomly freezing one of
the three sublattices, resulting in effective pairwise interactions among the
remaining spins. Using Monte Carlo simulations combined with a finite-size
scaling analysis, we determine the percolation temperature of these stochastic
clusters and show that it coincides with the exact thermal critical point of
the model. The critical exponents derived from cluster observables are
consistent with those of the underlying thermal phase transition. Finally, we
analyze the dynamical scaling of the multi-cluster and single-cluster
algorithms resulting from the cluster construction, highlighting their
efficiency and scaling behavior with system size.

### Unusual dependence on the angle of magnetic field for the spin Hall magnetoresistance of monodomain epitaxial BiFeO3 thin films

Spin Hall magnetoresistance (SMR) measurements provide a way to probe the
surface spin structure of insulating magnetic materials. Such measurements
produce resistance signals of the form {$\Delta$}R {$\propto$}
cos[2($\alpha$-$\alpha$$_0$)], where $\alpha$ is the angle between the current
and the external in-plane magnetic field. Previous experiments on a wide range
of materials have found $\alpha$$_0$ = 0$\deg$ for ferromagnets and
$\alpha$$_0$ = 90$\deg$ for antiferromagnets. Here we investigate SMR in
bilayers of Pt with monodomain BiFeO$_3$ multiferroic epitaxial thin films. We
observe signals of the form {$\Delta$}R {$\propto$}
cos[2($\alpha$-$\alpha$$_0$)] but surprisingly the angle $\alpha$$_0$ can take
values very different from 90$\deg$ or 0$\deg$, with large variations from
sample to sample. The aim of the paper is to report this striking departure
from the expected magnetic field dependence of SMR and to encourage
consideration of possible microscopic mechanisms.

### Robust Orbital-Selective Flat Bands in Transition-Metal Oxychlorides

- **TL;DR**: 在NbOCl2和TaOCl2等范德华材料中发现了一种本征的轨道选择性平带机制，该平带在从体块到少层极限的室温条件下都表现出显著稳定性。

Flat electronic bands, which amplify electron correlations by quenching
kinetic energy, provide an ideal foundation for exotic quantum phases. However,
prevailing strategies -- including geometrically frustrated lattices, moire
superlattices and heavy-fermion physics -- suffer from inherent trade-offs
among robustness, tunability and orbital selectivity, limiting their broad
applicability. Here, we unveil an intrinsic orbital-selective flat-band
mechanism in the van der Waals materials NbOCl2 and TaOCl2, directly observed
by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and understood through
density functional theory (DFT) and Wannier analysis. Crucially, we
experimentally demonstrate that this momentum-independent flat band exhibits
remarkable robustness, surviving from the bulk crystal down to the few-layer
limit at room temperature. Our theoretical analysis traces its origin to the
hybridization between Nb-dz2 orbital chains and the Lieb-like dx2-y2
sublattice, which is further reinforced by Peierls dimerization. Our findings
not only establish transition-metal oxychlorides as a robust and tunable
platform for flat-band-driven correlated phases under ambient conditions, but
also uncover a new orbital-selective design principle for realizing flat bands
in quantum materials.

We consider constrained bilinear optimal control of second-order linear
evolution partial differential equations (PDEs) with a reaction term on the
half line, where control arises as a time-dependent reaction coefficient and
constraints are imposed on the state and control variables. These PDEs
represent a wide range of physical phenomena in fluid flow, heat, and mass
transfer. Existing computational methods for this type of control problems only
consider constraints on control variables. In this paper, we propose a novel
optimize-then-discretize framework for computing constrained bilinear optimal
control with both state and control constraints. Unlike existing methods that
derive optimality conditions directly from the PDE constraint, this framework
first replaces the PDE constraint with an equivalent integral representation of
the PDE solution. The integral representation, derived from the unified
transform method, does not involve differential operators, and thus explicit
expressions for necessary conditions of optimality can be derived using the
Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions for infinite-dimensional optimization.
Discretizing the optimality conditions results in a system of
finite-dimensional smooth nonlinear equations, which can be efficiently solved
using existing solvers without the need for specialized algorithms. This is in
contrast with discretize-then-optimize methods that discretize the PDE first
and then solve the optimality conditions of the approximated finite-dimensional
problem. Computational results for two applications, namely nuclear reactivity
control and water quality treatment in a reactor, are presented to illustrate
the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

We investigate the emergence of a topological magnon phase in a
two-dimensional kagome ferromagnet with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI)
and scalar spin chirality. By incorporating a chiral interaction term
proportional to the scalar triple product chi_ijk = S_i (S_j x S_k), we examine
how the interplay between DMI and the topological orbital coupling kappa_TO
gives rise to geometric phase, nontrivial Berry curvature, and quantized Chern
numbers in the magnon bands. Using a momentum-space representation and linear
spin-wave theory, we compute the orbital texture, its vorticity, and the Berry
curvature across the Brillouin zone. We show that noncoplanar spin textures,
driven by finite DMI, form momentum-space skyrmions that act as sources of
geometric curvature. Importantly, we demonstrate that DMI alone is insufficient
to break time-reversal symmetry; only the presence of finite scalar chirality
terms allows the system to develop a nonzero Berry phase and topological
transport signatures. We further explore the effect of a global plaquette
rotation, showing that while the band structure remains invariant under this
unitary transformation, the Berry curvature and Chern number are modulated,
highlighting the geometric sensitivity of the topological response. Our results
establish a direct correspondence between the lattice geometry, chirality, and
magnon topology, providing a route toward tunable topological phases in
frustrated magnetic systems.

- **TL;DR**: 研究了FeSe和Fe(Se,Te)薄膜的微波特性，比较了它们在4-20K温度范围和12T磁场下的性能差异，用于暗物质搜索微波探测器的应用

In this work, we have grown $\sim$100 nm thick pristine FeSe films by pulsed
laser deposition. The films were structurally characterized with X-ray
diffraction and their surface morphology checked through atomic force
microscopy. Microwave measurements, performed with a dielectric loaded
resonator tuned at the frequency of 8 GHz, allowed the characterization of the
samples surface resistance, in view of potential applications in microwave
haloscopes for dark matter search. Here, we report the comparison of the
microwave properties of FeSe with Fe(Se,Te) thin films, as the temperature is
swept from 4 K to 20 K. By applying a constant static magnetic field of 12 T,
it was also possible to discern the magnetic field resilience of the two
samples. FeSe showed a larger critical temperature drift as the field is
applied, while the Fe(Se,Te) response broadens remarkably less. A preliminary
analysis of vortex pinning shows margins for optimizing pinning in FeSe.

Slater basis functions have desirable properties that can improve electronic
structure simulations, but improved numerical integration methods are needed.
This work builds upon the SlaterGPU library for evaluation of Hamiltonian
matrix elements in the resolution-of-the-identity approximation. In particular,
a Prolate Spheroidal grid will provide sufficient integral accuracy to employ
larger basis sets (quadruple-zeta and greater) in practical computations
involving polyatomics. To integrate 3-center Coulomb and nuclear attraction
terms, an improved grid representation around the 3rd center is introduced. The
RMSEs of the integral quantities are evaluated and compared to the previous
numerical integration method used in SlaterGPU (Becke Partitioning), resulting
in a ~3 order of magnitude reduction in the error for 2-center integral
quantities. The procedure is generally applicable to polyatomic systems, GPU
accelerated for high performance computing, and tested on self-consistent field
and full configuration interaction wavefunctions. Results for a number of
3-atom models as well as propanediyl (C3H6) demonstrate the reliability of the
new integration scheme.

We derive an inequality relating the finite-frequency linear response and
fluctuations of an observable in a physical system. The relation holds for
arbitrary observables and perturbations in general Markovian dynamics,
including over- and underdamped Langevin systems and jump processes, both in
and out of equilibrium. As a consequence, we obtain a universal upper bound on
the broad-band signal-to-noise ratio of noisy dynamics, which only depends on
the damping constant and temperature. We further show that the inequality
reduces to an equality for appropriately chosen observables or perturbations in
linear systems, both overdamped and underdamped and both in and out of
equilibrium.

Lead-free (K0.48Na0.48Li0.04)(Nb1-xTax)O3 (KNLNT-x) ceramics were synthesized
to study the effects of Li and Ta substitution on phase transition behavior,
microstructure, and ferroelectric, dielectric, and piezoelectric properties.
X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy show that compositions with x &lt; 0.10
exhibit a single orthorhombic (Amm2) phase, while 0.10 &lt;= x &lt;= 0.20 show
coexistence of orthorhombic and tetragonal (Amm2 + P4mm) phases. For x &gt; 0.20,
a single tetragonal (P4mm) phase is obtained. Microstructural analysis shows a
dense ceramic with decreasing grain size as Ta concentration increases.
Temperature-dependent dielectric studies reveal two transitions:
orthorhombic-tetragonal (TO-T) and tetragonal-cubic (TC). Both transition
temperatures decrease systematically with increasing Ta, and TO-T shifts below
room temperature for x &gt; 0.15. The composition KNLNT-0.20 exhibits the highest
dielectric constant (Er = 556) and piezoelectric coefficient (d33 = 159 pC/N).
The enhanced piezoelectric response is attributed to a morphotropic phase
boundary rather than a shift of the polymorphic phase boundary temperature. A
composition-temperature phase diagram was constructed based on XRD, Raman, and
dielectric data.

### Unusual critical points between atomic insulating phases

- **Title (EN)**: Unusual critical points between atomic insulating phases
- **Authors**: Yunchao Zhang, T. Senthil
- **Categories**: cond-mat.str-el, hep-th
- **TL;DR**: Error

We study a class of quantum phase transitions between featureless bosonic
atomic insulators in $(2+1)$ dimensions, where each phase exhibits neither
topological order nor protected edge modes. Despite their lack of topology,
these insulators may be ``obstructed'' in the sense that their Wannier centers
are not pinned to the physical atomic sites. These insulators represent
distinct phases, as no symmetry-preserving adiabatic path connects them.
Surprisingly, we find that the critical point between these insulators can host
a conformally invariant state described by quantum electrodynamics in $(2+1)$
dimensions (QED$_3$). The emergent electrodynamics at the critical point can be
stabilized if the embedding of the microscopic lattice symmetries suppresses
the proliferation of monopoles, suggesting that even transitions between
trivial phases can harbor rich and unexpected physics. We analyze the mechanism
behind this phenomenon, discuss its stability against perturbations, and
explore the embedding of lattice symmetries into the continuum through anomaly
matching. In all the models we analyze, we confirm that the QED$_3$ is indeed
emergeable, in the sense that it is realizable from a local lattice
Hamiltonian.

### Towards In-Situ Failure Assessment: Deep Learning on DIC Results for Laminated Composites

- **TL;DR**: 开发了一个基于DIC应变场数据的深度学习框架，用于预测带应力集中器的层压复合材料断裂载荷，无需有限元模拟或经验校准。

Predicting fracture load in laminated composites with stress raisers is
challenging due to complex failure mechanisms such as delamination, fibre
breakage, and matrix cracking, which are heavily influenced by fibre
orientation, layup sequence, and notch geometry. This study aims to address
this by developing a novel deep learning framework that leverages solely
experimental strain field data from Digital Image Correlation (DIC) for
accurate, in-situ predictions--bypassing the need for finite element
simulations or empirical calibrations. Two complementary architectures are
explored: a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) that processes numerical values of
maximum principal strain from a targeted rectangular region ahead of the notch,
enhanced by advanced feature selection (mutual information, Lasso, and SHAP) to
focus on critical data points; and a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained
on full-field strain images, bolstered by data augmentation to handle
variability and prevent overfitting. Validated across 116 quasi-static tests
encompassing 31 distinct configurations--including six layups (quasi-isotropic
to highly anisotropic) with four off-axis angles for open-hole specimens, and
one cross-ply layup with four off-axis and four on-axis notch orientations for
U-notched specimens--the MLP and CNN achieve coefficients of determination
(R^2) of 0.86 and 0.82, respectively. This framework captures a broad spectrum
of damage modes and responses, from brittle fibre-dominated fracture to ductile
delamination-driven failure, and due to its computational efficiency and
reliance only on DIC measurements, the approach enables practical in-situ
fracture load estimation.

### The impact of dimensionality on universality of 2D quantum Hall transitions

Regardless of model and platform details, the critical phenomena exhibit
universal behaviors that are remarkably consistent across various experiments
and theories, resulting in a significant scientific success of condensed matter
physics. One widely known and commonly used example is the 2D quantum Hall
transition; yet, its universal exponents still somewhat conflict between
experiments, theoretical models, and numerical ansatzes. We study critical
behaviors of quasi-2D Weyl semimetal systems with a finite thickness $L_z&gt;1$,
disorder, and external magnetic field $B_z$. By analyzing the scaling behaviors
of the localization lengths and local density of states using recursive
methods, we find that the finite thickness yields a deviation from the 2D
quantum Hall universality ($L_z=1$ case) and a crossover toward the 3D Gaussian
Unitary Ensemble ($L_z\rightarrow \infty$ limit), potentially offering another
cause of the discrepancy. Our work demonstrates the often-overlooked importance
of auxiliary degrees of freedom, such as thickness, and that 3D quantum Hall
physics is not merely a trivial finite-thickness extension of its 2D
counterpart.

We present first preliminary surface impedance measurements on Tl-1223 films
in dc magnetic fields, in view of potential applications for the next
generation Future Circular Collider (FCC-hh) at CERN. The Tl-1223 samples were
produced through laser ablation, with nominal thickness of 1 {\mu}m and grown
on a thick LaAl2O3 substrate. The presence of Tl-1212 phase identified by XRD
and BSE microscopy, could be avoided by changing the oxygen partial pressure
during heat treatment. The high-frequency transport properties of the samples
were characterized using microwave resonant devices, at fixed frequencies of
14.9 GHz, 24.2 GHz and 26.7 GHz, in the temperature range 40 K to 140 K. An
external applied static magnetic field up to 12 T was applied. Samples from
subsequent batches exhibited huge improvements in the microwave properties,
confirming the progress in the deposition technique.

### High-entropy perovskites as new photocatalysts for cocatalyst-free water splitting

- **TL;DR**: 本研究开发了三种新型ABO3型高熵钙钛矿光催化剂，可在无需助催化剂条件下实现高效光催化水分解产氢。

The photocatalytic water-splitting process is thermodynamically challenging
and requires catalysts with suitable band structures, as well as the presence
of supporting cocatalysts. By considering the unique charge carrier mobility in
perovskites, this study introduces three new ABO3-type high-entropy perovskites
(Ba1/2Sr1/2)(Ti1/3Zr1/3Hf1/3)O3, (Ba1/2Sr1/2)(Ga1/3In1/3Sn1/3)O3 and
(Ba1/2Sr1/2)(Ti1/3Zr1/3Sn1/3)O3 for cocatalyst-free photocatalysis. The three
catalysts, having a single-phase cubic structure, are designed by considering
configurational entropy, tolerance factor, octahedral factor, ionic radius
deviation and valence deviation of &gt;1.5R (R: gas constant), 0.9-1.0, 0.4-0.8,
&gt;0.3 and &gt;0.3, respectively. The perovskites exhibit similar valence band tops,
while their bandgaps vary slightly depending on the composition at the B-site
(slightly lower bandgap by including d10 cations). Additionally, all three
materials demonstrate effective hydrogen generation without the need for added
cocatalysts. This investigation confirms that high-entropy oxide perovskites
can offer significant potential for cocatalyst-free photocatalytic reactions.

In this paper, we start reviewing the main features of the one-dimensional
Ising model with long-range interactions, where the spin-spin coupling decays
as a power law, $J(r) \propto r^{-\alpha}$. We then discuss the key properties
of the one-dimensional voter model, in which two agents (spins) at distance $r$
interact with a power-law probability with the same form of $J(r)$. The two
models are compared, and the so-called $p$-voter model is presented, which
provides a framework to interpolate between them. Specifically, the $p$-voter
model reduces to the voter model for $p = 1$ and $p = 2$, while for $p \ge 3$
it falls into the universality class of the Ising model.

In recent years, rapid progress has been made in developing artificial
intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) methods for x-ray absorption
spectroscopy (XAS) analysis. Compared to traditional XAS analysis methods,
AI/ML approaches offer dramatic improvements in efficiency and help eliminate
human bias. To advance this field, we advocate an AI-driven XAS analysis
pipeline that features several inter-connected key building blocks: benchmarks,
workflows, databases, and AI/ML models. Specifically, we present two case
studies for XAS ML. In the first study, we demonstrate the importance of
reconciling the discrepancies between simulation and experiment using spectral
domain mapping (SDM). Our ML model, which is trained solely on simulated
spectra, predicts an incorrect oxidation state trend for Ti atoms in a
combinatorial zinc titanate film. After transforming the experimental spectra
into a simulation-like representation using SDM, the same model successfully
recovers the correct oxidation state trend. In the second study, we explore the
development of universal XAS ML models that are trained on the entire periodic
table, which enables them to leverage common trends across elements. Looking
ahead, we envision that an AI-driven pipeline can unlock the potential of
real-time XAS analysis to accelerate scientific discovery.

### Four-Spin Interactions as a Route to Multiple-Q Topological Magnetic Order

We investigate the role of four-spin interactions in stabilizing exotic
multiple-$Q$ topological spin textures and demonstrate their ability to realize
a skyrmion crystal. While such higher-order interactions are known to be
important, their intricate nature makes systematic model construction
significantly challenging. To address this issue, we develop a theoretical
framework that connects microscopic real-space four-spin couplings to their
effective interactions in momentum space, providing a clear route to engineer
target magnetic phases. Applying this framework to a frustrated Heisenberg
model with designed four-spin interactions, we identify the stabilization of
the zero-field skyrmion crystal with a topological number of two via simulated
annealing. Furthermore, our momentum-space analysis reveals the intrinsic
mechanism by which the well-known ring-exchange interaction also favors the
skyrmion crystal. Our findings not only present a concrete model for a
higher-order skyrmion crystal but also offer a general methodology for
understanding and designing a wide range of complex multiple-$Q$ magnetic
orders driven by multi-spin interactions.

We propose a hybrid solver that fuses the dimensionality-reduction strengths
of the Method of Lines (MOL) with the flexibility of Physics-Informed Neural
Networks (PINNs). Instead of approximating spatial derivatives with fixed
finite-difference stencils - whose truncation errors force extremely fine
meshes - our method trains a neural network to represent the initial spatial
profile and then employs automatic differentiation to obtain spectrally
accurate gradients at arbitrary nodes. These high-fidelity derivatives define
the right-hand side of the MOL-generated ordinary-differential system, and time
integration is replaced with a secondary temporal PINN while spatial accuracy
is retained without mesh refinement. The resulting "boundary-informed MOL-PINN"
matches or surpasses conventional MOL in accuracy using an order of magnitude
fewer collocation points, thereby shrinking memory footprints, lessening
dependence on large data sets, and increasing complexity robustness. Because it
relies only on automatic differentiation and standard optimizers, the framework
extends naturally to linear and nonlinear PDEs in any spatial dimension.

### Measuring the magnetic anisotropy of the spin Hall effect and spin relaxation length in nickel and permalloy via electrical spin injection

The spin Hall effect in ferromagnets is of great interest in the field of
spintronics, and while the effect has been quantified in many materials, the
dependence of the spin Hall angle on the relative orientation of spin
polarization and the magnetization is less well studied. Of equal importance
for the purpose of spin-charge interconversion in ferromagnets is the spin
relaxation length, which is predicted to be highly anisotropic with respect to
magnetization. Using a modified lateral spin valve geometry with a copper
channel and permalloy spin injector, we measure the dependence of the spin Hall
angle and spin relaxation length on magnetization orientation in permalloy and
nickel, using two distinct device geometries. This allows us to disentangle the
contributions of the spin relaxation length and spin Hall angle to the measured
spin-charge interconversion voltage output. Our results indicate a large
anisotropy in both the spin relaxation length and spin Hall angle in both
permalloy and nickel, in agreement with theoretical calculations. The
quantities change in opposite directions, with the spin relaxation length
rising as the magnetization is moved parallel to the spin polarization and the
spin Hall angle falling, leading to a near total cancellation of the
spin-charge interconversion output.

We unveil a mechanism that enables a robust supercurrent diode effect in
Josephson junctions based on multiband superconductors. We predict that
interband pairing can significantly amplifies this effect, even under weak
spin-orbit coupling while intraband pairing alone would render it negligible.
To illustrate this, we examine monolayer FeSe/STO, a system where recent
experiments suggest interband pairing in either a nodeless $d$-wave or $\eta$
pairing state. Using experimentally derived parameters, we predict that
FeSe/STO can serve as a high-temperature platform for realizing a substantial
supercurrent diode effect, with efficiencies reaching up to $30\%$ for $d$-wave
pairing and $12\%$ for $\eta$ pairing. These results demonstrate that measuring
the supercurrent diode effect can provides a powerful probe of the pairing
symmetry in monolayer FeSe/STO, offering critical insights into its
superconducting state.

For a gas-solid interfacial system where chemical species undergo reversible

both gas-phase hydrodynamics and surface coverage dynamics by coupling the
Langmuir adsorption model with compressible fluctuating hydrodynamics. To this
end, we derive a thermodynamically consistent mass-energy update scheme that
accounts for how the mass and energy variables in the gas and surface
subsystems should be updated according to the changes in the number of
molecules of each species in each subsystem due to adsorption and desorption
events. By performing a stochastic analysis for the ideal Langmuir model and
the full hydrodynamic system, we analytically confirm that our mass-energy
update scheme captures thermodynamic equilibrium predicted by equilibrium
statistical mechanics. We find that an internal energy correction term is
needed, which is attributed to the difference in the mean kinetic energy of gas
molecules colliding with the surface from that computed from the
Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. By performing an equilibrium simulation study
for an ideal gas mixture of CO and Ar with CO undergoing reversible adsorption,
we validate our overall simulation method and implementation.

Non-flat energy landscapes leading to localized pinning of skyrmions pose an
inherent and unavoidable challenge for studies of fundamental 2D spin structure
dynamics as well as applications. Accounting for pinning is a key requirement
for predictive modeling of skyrmion systems, as it impacts the systems'
dynamics and introduces randomizing effects. In this article, we use
magneto-optical Kerr microscopy to image skyrmions in a magnetic thin film
system in real time and analyze their hopping dynamics within the non-flat
energy landscape. To achieve a fully quantitative model, we utilize skyrmion
diffusion and dwell times at pinning sites to extrapolate the pinning energy
landscape into regions that cannot be sampled on reasonable experimental time
scales. For evaluation with a coarse-grained Thiele model, we perform long-time
measurements of skyrmion diffusion and then develop a two-step procedure to
determine simulation parameters by comparing them to experimentally accessible
behavior. This provides a direct conversion between simulation and experimental
units, which is the missing key step that has previously prevented quantitative
quasiparticle modeling. We demonstrate the predictive power of our approach by
measuring the experimentally unexplored density dependence of skyrmion
diffusion and show that it is in excellent agreement with simulation
predictions. Our technique thus enables quantitative skyrmion simulations on
experimental time and length scales, allowing for predictive in-silico
prototyping of skyrmion devices.

### Development and Validation of 2NN-MEAM Interatomic Potential for Sc and Al-Sc Alloys Thermodynamics Solidification and Intermetallic Ordering

We present a second-nearest-neighbor Modified Embedded Atom Method
(2NN--MEAM) potential for Scandium (Sc) and Aluminum-Scandium (Al--Sc) alloys
that unifies cohesive, thermodynamic, and solidification behavior within a
single transferable framework. The Sc component accurately reproduces cohesive
energy, lattice constants, defect energetics, and the experimental melting
point obtained from two-phase coexistence, demonstrating reliable description
of both hcp and liquid phases. The Al--Sc binary interaction parameters were
fitted using the L1$_2$--Al$_3$Sc reference and benchmarked against
first-principles and calorimetric data. The potential reproduces the strong
negative formation enthalpy of Al$_3$Sc (--0.45~eV~atom$^{-1}$), correct
relative stability of competing phases, and realistic elastic properties.
Mixing enthalpies of the liquid alloy agree with ideal-associated-solution and
CALPHAD models, confirming that the potential captures exothermic Al--Sc
association in the melt. Molecular-dynamics simulations of solidification
reveal the expected temperature and composition dependence of homogeneous
nucleation. Pure Al crystallizes readily, while Al--1~at.\%~Sc exhibits a
longer incubation and slower growth at the same absolute temperature due to
reduced undercooling and solute drag. Within the alloy, ordered Al$_3$Sc-type
L1$_2$ embryos appear spontaneously, with Sc atoms occupying cube-corner (B)
sites surrounded by twelve Al neighbors. Energy--volume trajectories confirm
that the potential links thermodynamics to microstructural evolution. Overall,
the developed 2NN--MEAM potential provides a quantitatively grounded basis for
modeling melting, solidification, and intermetallic ordering in Sc and Al--Sc
systems, enabling future multicomponent alloy design and large-scale nucleation
studies.

### Three Types of Non-Fermi-Liquid Fixed Point for a Triplet Quantum Impurity in a Cubic Metal

In cubic metals, a local, magnetic moment with a triplet ground state coupled
to $\Gamma_8$ conduction electrons can give rise to various non-Fermi liquid
(NFL) quantum critical behaviors. To date, only those exchange couplings have
been studied that are spherically symmetric already in the high-temperature,
local moment regime. Namely, only the effects of potential scattering, spin
exchange and quadrupolar exchange couplings were considered, and two types of
NFL fixed points have been identified. However, in cubic symmetry, six
independent exchange couplings can be present in the Hamiltonian: in addition
to the spherically symmetric potential scattering and spin exchange, there is a
spherical symmetry breaking, dipolar exchange interaction, and three spherical
symmetry breaking, quadrupolar terms. While all of them flow to fixed points
where rotational invariance is recovered, we found that one of the quadrupolar
couplings flows to a so far unidentified NFL fixed point. We derive the cubic
symmetry allowed exchanged couplings, solve them with the numerical
renormalization group, and present three types of NFL excitation, one of which
is novel, at least in the context of a quantum impurity with a triplet ground
state.

### Magnetic fluctuations and anisotropy in UTe2: a multi-orbital study based on GGA+U and RPA

- **TL;DR**: 本研究使用DFT+RPA方法研究了UTe2在不同压力下的磁涨落和各项异性，发现磁性的压力演化受U-5f态动量空间分布和费米能级态密度控制。

Pressure-induced changes in the magnetic and superconducting properties of a
spin-triplet superconductor candidate UTe2 have attracted considerable
interest, underscoring the need for microscopic theoretical insight. In this
paper, we investigate magnetic fluctuations and their anisotropy at ambient
pressure and under pressure using density functional theory (DFT) combined with
the random phase approximation (RPA). For each pressure, we perform DFT+U
calculations for several values of the Coulomb interaction U, construct a
72-orbital periodic Anderson model, and calculate magnetic susceptibilities
with use of the RPA. For U = 2 eV, the Fermi surfaces have a
quasi-two-dimensional shape, antiferromagnetic fluctuations develop with the
wave vector along the a* axis, and the magnetic anisotropy follows $\chi^b &gt;
\chi^a &gt; \chi^c$. The antiferromagnetic fluctuations are suppressed under
pressure because of a reduced density of states at the Fermi level, while the
magnetic anisotropy is weakened. In contrast, for U = 1 eV, where Fermi
surfaces are more three-dimensional, antiferromagnetic fluctuations with Q2 =
0.22 b* appear, accompanied by anisotropy $\chi^a &gt; \chi^c &gt; \chi^b$,
consistent with experiments. Under pressure, antiferromagnetic fluctuations
around Q2 are enhanced, the magnetic wave vector tilts slightly toward the a*
direction due to Fermi-surface distortion, and the magnetic anisotropy is
suppressed. These results demonstrate that the pressure evolution of magnetism
in UTe2 is governed by the momentum-space distribution of U-5f states and the
density of states at the Fermi level, providing a microscopic basis for
understanding the magnetic and superconducting properties of UTe2.

The incompleteness of single-particle basis sets has long cast a shadow over
correlated electronic-structure methods, making it highly challenging to obtain
numerically converged results. In this work, we compute the RPA correlation
energies of general molecules using the finite element method, while
ingeniously combining atomic orbital basis sets to accelerate the convergence
of total energies. We report atomization energies for 50 molecules within the
RPA framework, achieving accuracies on the order of meV per atom. The
computational strategy that integrates real-space discretization techniques
with atomic orbitals is expected to inspire the entire correlated
electronic-structure community.

### The Wishart--Rosenzweig--Porter random matrix ensemble

- **TL;DR**: 本文研究了Wishart-RP随机矩阵系综的相图和局域化特性，发现即使在放宽独立同分布假设的情况下，分形相中的能级压缩率仍与高斯RP模型一致，扩展了相关普适性猜想。

In recent years the Rosenzweig--Porter (RP) ensemble, obtained by adding a
diagonal matrix with independent and identically distributed elements to a
Gaussian random matrix, has been widely used as a minimal model for the
emergence of fractal eigenstates in complex many-body systems. A key open
question concerns the robustness of its phase diagram when the assumption of
independent and uncorrelated entries is relaxed -- an assumption that
simplifies its analysis, but is generally violated in realistic quantum
systems. In this work, we take a first step in this direction by considering a
deformed Wishart (rather than Gaussian) random matrix, which we dub the
``Wishart--RP'' ensemble. Using perturbation theory, as well as the cavity and
replica methods and the Dyson Brownian motion approach, we characterize its
phase diagram and localization properties. Remarkably, we show that the level
compressibility, which quantifies spectral correlations in the fractal phase,
coincides with that of the Gaussian RP model, thereby extending the
universality conjectured in [SciPost Phys. 14, 110 (2023)] beyond the fully
uncorrelated setting. We confirm our results with numerical tests.

### Enhanced magnetic, electrical, and magnetostrictive properties of La-doped SrCoO3 synthesized by microwave heating

We report microwave-assisted synthesis and physical properties of La-doped
SrCoO3-{\delta}. The Sr0.8La0.2CoO3-{\delta} synthesized via microwave heating
(MWH) exhibits superior physical properties compared to a nominally identical
composition obtained by conventional heating (CH) in an electrical furnace. The
MWH sample exhibits an enhanced ferromagnetic Curie temperature (158 K in CH
and 176 K in MWH samples) and higher saturation magnetization but smaller
coercive field and magnetoresistance at 10 K compared to the CH sample. While
the dc resistivity increases substantially below 120 K in the CH sample, it is
metallic from 350 to 10 K in the MWH sample. Further, the longitudinal
magnetostriction of the MWH sample ({\lambda}par = 247 ppm for H = 50 kOe) at
10 K is also higher than that of the CH sample ({\lambda}par = 128 ppm). The
observed enhanced properties of the MWH sample can not be attributed to grain
size and grain boundaries but are likely to arise from lesser oxygen defects
and partial oxidation of Co3+ into Co4+, however, the exact mechanism is not
fully understood at present.

### Dynamic destruction of magnetic order in a quantum Ising chain with oscillating transverse field

We study the dynamic response of magnetic domain walls in low-lying excited
states of an Ising chain to an oscillating transverse field. Based on the exact
instantaneous eigenstates, we find that when the frequency of the external
field is in off-resonant regions, the domain wall exhibits Bloch oscillation,
maintaining the magnetic order. However, the magnetic order is destroyed when
the field is at resonant frequency. Numerical simulations of the dynamics of
magnetization and entanglement entropy for initial states with single and
double domain walls accord with the predictions. These findings reveal the
nontrivial effect of a monochromatic electromagnetic field on quantum spin
dynamics.

The silicon-hydrogen system is of key interest for solar-cell devices,
including both crystalline and amorphous modifications. Elemental amorphous Si
is now well understood, but the atomic-scale effects of hydrogenating the
silicon matrix remain to be fully explored. Here, we present a machine-learned
interatomic potential model based on the atomic cluster expansion (ACE)
framework that can describe a wide range of Si-H phases, from crystalline and
amorphous bulk structures to surfaces and molecules. We perform numerical and
physical validation across a range of hydrogen concentrations and compare our
results to experimental findings. Our work constitutes an advancement toward
the exploration of large structural models of a-Si:H at realistic device
scales.

### Surface diffusion of phosphorus on Si(100) after PBr3 adsorption

Phosphorus diffusion on a Si(100) surface was studied using scanning
tunneling microscopy (STM) at temperatures of 77 and 300 K. The phosphorus
source utilized was the PBr$_3$ molecule, which fully dissociates on the
surface at 77 K. We observed diffusion of P atoms both along and across the
rows of Si dimers. To support the observation of different diffusion pathways
of phosphorus, activation energy calculations were performed using density
functional theory. At 77 K, phosphorus diffusion started and (or) finished
mostly in bridge positions. At 300 K, phosphorus diffuses predominantly between
end-bridge positions, accompanied by bromine diffusion. The presence of Br near
phosphorus significantly restricts its mobility. Additionally, phosphorus was
found to diffuse to an oxygen atom that appeared on the surface as a result of
water adsorption. This diffusion occurs because the P site near the oxidized
dimer is more stable compared to that on the clean surface. The obtained
results complement the knowledge about the interaction of phosphorus with the
silicon surface, specifically the phosphorus diffusion pathways on the Si(100)
surface.

### Subdimensional entanglement entropy: from virtual response to mixed-state holography

- **TL;DR**: 本文提出了子维纠缠熵（SEE）的概念，通过定义在低维子维纠缠子系统（SESs）上的纠缠熵来区分几何和拓扑贡献，为研究量子多体系统提供了新的响应理论框架。

Entanglement entropy (EE) serves as a key diagnostic of quantum phases and
phase transitions through bipartitions of the full system. However, recent
studies on various topological phases of matter show that EE from bipartitions
alone cannot effectively distinguish geometric from topological contributions.
Motivated by this limitation, we introduce the \textit{subdimensional
entanglement entropy} (SEE), defined for lower-dimensional
\textit{subdimensional entanglement subsystems} (SESs), as a response theory
characterizing many-body systems via \textit{virtual} deformations of SES
geometry and topology. Analytical calculations for cluster states, discrete
Abelian gauge theories, and fracton orders reveal distinct subleading SEE terms
that sharply differentiate geometric and topological responses. Viewing the
reduced density matrix on an SES as a mixed state, we establish a
correspondence between stabilizers and mixed-state symmetries, identifying
\textit{strong} and \textit{weak} classes. For SESs with nontrivial SEE, weak
symmetries act as \textit{transparent patch operators} of the strong ones,
forming robust \textit{transparent composite symmetries} (TCSs) that remain
invariant under finite-depth quantum circuits and yield \textit{strong-to-weak
spontaneous symmetry breaking} (SW-SSB). By bridging entanglement, mixed-state
and categorical symmetries, holographic principles of topological order, and
geometric-topological responses, SEE provides a unified framework that invites
further theoretical and numerical exploration of correlated quantum matter.

This paper reports on a systematic first-principles molecular dynamics
investigation of binary (TlO$_{0.5}$)$_{y}$-(TeO$_2$)$_{1-y}$ and ternary
$(TiO$_{2}$)$_{x}$-(TlO$_{0.5}$)$_{y}$-(TeO$_2$)_{1-x-y}$ tellurite glasses.
The obtained structural models are validated against available measured X-ray
pair distribution functions. In the binary system, increasing TlO$_{0.5}$
content induces network depolymerization through the reduction of Te
coordination number, the substitution of Te-O-Te linkages with
Te=O$^{-}$...Tl$^{+}$ units, and the proliferation of non-bridging oxygens. In
addition, rings analysis demonstrates a loss of the network connectivity via
the opening of small n-membered rings. In contrast, TiO$_2$ acts as a network
former in ternary glasses, preserving Te coordination number, and promoting a
high fraction of bridging oxygens. Ti atoms induces a network repolymerization
that manifests through the formation of smaller Ti-containing n-membered rings
thereby balancing the strong effect of Tl$_2$O modifier. Beside the structural
analysis, we also computed Raman spectra and non-linear optical properties on
the obtained large periodic models. Our results reproduce experimental trends
in Raman band shifts with composition, while nonlinear optical calculations
show that &lt;$\chi^{(3)}$&gt; remains stable with TlO$_{0.5}$ addition in binary
glasses, consistent with experiment. In the case of ternary systems, we find
that the inclusion of a small fraction of TiO$_2$ preserves the high optical
nonlinearity of the TeO$_2$ network while maintaining the overall network
connectivity. These results establish a predictive framework for tailoring the
atomic structure and nonlinear optical response of tellurite glasses through
the controlled interplay of modifiers nature and concentration.

### Atomically-resolved exciton emission from single defects in MoS$_2$

Understanding how atomic defects shape the nanoscale optical properties of
two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors is essential for advancing quantum
technologies and optoelectronics. Using scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS)
and luminescence (STML), we correlate the atomic structure and optical
fingerprints of individual defects in monolayer MoS$_2$. A bilayer of hexagonal
boron nitride (hBN) effectively decouples MoS$_2$ from the graphene substrate,
increasing its band gap and extending the defect charge state lifetime. This
enables the observation of sharp STML emission lines from MoS$_2$ excitons and
trions exhibiting nanoscale sensitivity to local potential fluctuations. We
identify the optical signatures of common point defects in MoS$_2$: sulfur
vacancies (Vac$_\text{S}^-$), oxygen substitutions (O$_\text{S}$), and
negatively charged carbon-hydrogen complexes (CH$_\text{S}^-$). While
Vac$_\text{S}^-$ and O$_\text{S}$ only suppress pristine excitonic emission,
CH$_\text{S}^-$ generate defect-bound exciton complexes ($A^-X$) about 200\,meV
below the MoS$_2$ exciton. Sub-nanometer-resolved STML maps reveal large
spectral shifts near charged defects, concurrent with the local band bending
expected for band-to-defect optical transitions. These results establish an
atomically precise correlation between structure, electronic states, and
optical response, enabling deterministic engineering of quantum emitters in 2D
materials.

In this work, we report high-performance atomic-layer-deposited indium oxide
(In2O3) transistors with high gated-Hall mobility ({\mu}H) exceeding 100 cm2/Vs
at room temperature (RT). It is found that the deposition of top hafnium oxide
(HfO2) above the In2O3 channel significantly enhances its crystallization,
leading to an average grain size of 97.2 nm in a 4.2-nm In2O3 channel. The ALD
of In2O3 exhibits an epitaxy-like growth behavior, with its (222) planes
aligning parallel to the (111) planes of both the top and bottom HfO2
dielectrics. As a result, bottom-gate In2O3 transistors with a high {\mu}H of
100.9 cm2/Vs and a decent subthreshold swing (SS) of 94 mV/dec are achieved by
gated-Hall measurement at RT. Furthermore, the devices maintain excellent
performance at low temperatures, achieving a {\mu}H of 162.2 cm2/Vs at 100 K.
Our study reveals the critical role of dielectric deposition induced
crystallization in enhancing carrier transport and offers a scalable pathway
toward high-mobility devices.

Understanding and optimizing polysulfide adsorption and conversion processes
are critical to mitigating shuttle effects and sluggish redox kinetics in
lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs). Here, we introduce a
machine-learning-accelerated framework, Precise and Accurate Configuration
Evaluation (PACE), that integrates Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials
(MLIPs) with Density Functional Theory (DFT) to systematically explore
adsorption configurations and energetics of a series of N6-coordinated
dual-atom catalysts (DACs). Our results demonstrate that, compared with
single-atom catalysts, DACs exhibit improved LiPS adsorption and redox
conversion through cooperative metal-sulfur interactions and electronic
coupling between adjacent metal centers. Among all DACs, Fe-Ni and Fe-Pt show
optimal catalytic performance, due to their optimal adsorption energies (-1.0
to -2.3 eV), low free-energy barriers (&lt;=0.4 eV) for the Li2S2 to Li2S
conversion, and facile Li2S decomposition barriers (&lt;=1.0 eV). To accelerate
catalyst screening, we further developed a machine learning (ML) regression
model trained on DFT-calculated data to predict the Gibbs free energy (\Delta
G) of Li2Sn adsorption using physically interpretable descriptors. The Gradient
Boosting Regression (GBR) model yields an R^2 of 0.85 and an MAE of 0.26 eV,
enabling the rapid prediction of \Delta G for unexplored DACs.
Electronic-structure analyses reveal that the superior performance originates
from the optimal d-band alignment and S-S bond polarization induced by the
cooperative effect of dual metal centres. This dual ML-DFT framework
demonstrates a generalizable, data-driven design strategy for the rational
discovery of efficient catalysts for next-generation LSBs.

metric of the valence band states throughout the entire Brillouin zone. The
global maximum of the metric is at the $\Gamma$ point, but other differential
geometric properties like Ricci scalar, Ricci tensor, and Einstein tensor are
found to vary significantly in the momentum space, indicating a highly
distorted momentum space manifold. The momentum integration of the quantum
metric further yields the gauge-invariant part of the spread of valence band
Wannier function, whose value agrees well with that experimentally extracted
from an optical sum rule of the dielectric function. Furthermore, the
dependence of these geometric properties on the energy gap offers a way to
quantify the quantum criticality of these common semiconductors.

Thermally induced antiphase boundaries (APBs) in ferromagnetic, ordered
Ni-Mn-Ga single crystal exhibit complex, irregular shapes and closed loops
without any lattice plane preferences. The APBs were visualized on polished
(100) surface using magnetic force microscopy (MFM) at the same location in
parent cubic austenite and monoclinic martensite with uniaxial magnetic
anisotropy. Based on ab-initio calculation we suggest that one APB curve with
dark and light contrast consists of a pair of APB interfaces with narrow, only
one-layer thick, core with structural partial B2' order in contrast to full L21
order of bulk. Calculated magnetic contrast using magnetostatic continuum
simulations agrees well with MFM observation.

- **TL;DR**: 通过Nb和Te共掺杂WSe2，显著提升了热电性能：功率因子提高17倍，晶格热导率降低72%，在850K时获得ZT_max ~ 1，相比原始WSe2提高了约30倍。

Tungsten diselenide (WSe2) emerges as a promising thermoelectric (TE)
candidate due to its high thermopower (S), cost-effectiveness, and
environmentally friendly characteristics. However, pristine WSe2 exhibits
limited electrical conductivity (sigma), a low power factor (PF), and high
lattice thermal conductivity (k_L), which restrict its overall TE performance.
Here, we show that through co-doping of Nb for W and Te for Se in WSe2, its
power factor increases 17-fold, reaching 8.91 microW cm^-1 K^-2 at 850 K.
Simultaneously, its lattice thermal conductivity (k_L) decreases from 1.70 W
m^-1 K^-1 to 0.48 W m^-1 K^-1. Experiments and density functional theory (DFT)
analysis demonstrate that the enhancement of PF is linked to an increased
density of states, higher effective mass (md*), improved mobility (mu), and
elevated electrical conductivity (sigma) owing to the replacement of Se2- with
Te2-; while the observed 72% reduction in k_L results primarily from phonon
scattering at Te-Se and Nb-W defects. As a result, a remarkable ZT_max ~ 1 is
obtained at 850 K for the sample W0.95Nb0.05Se2-yTey with y = 0.3, which is
about a 30-fold increase compared to WSe2, proving that Nb and Te co-doping in
WSe2 can significantly boost its TE performance.

Laccase is a natural green catalyst and utilized in pollution treatment.
Nevertheless, its practical application is constrained by limitations including
high cost, poor stability, and difficulties in recovery. Herein, with
inspiration from catalytic mechanism of natural laccase, we designed and
prepared a bimetallic metal-organic framework, namely, CoNi-MOF, using
low-temperature plasma (LTP) technology. We employed dielectric barrier
discharge (DBD) plasma to prepare CoNi-MOF, and by precisely modulating the
N2/O2 gas ratio, we could modulate the distribution concentration of oxygen
vacancies in CoNi-MOF. Experimental investigations and density functional
theory (DFT) calculations elucidated that the critical role of the oxygen
vacancies in enhancing the laccase-like activity, which promoted the activation
of molecular oxygen (O2) for generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS).
Compared to natural laccase, CoNi-MOF exhibited superior catalytic performance
in the degradation of antibiotic tetracycline (TC), along with enhanced
resistance to harsh environmental conditions, improved stability, and low
biotoxicity. Notably, aeration increased the dissolved oxygen (DO) content,
further improving the TC degradation efficiency. As such, this study not only
proposes a facile and efficient low-temperature plasma technology for
synthesizing high-performance laccase-like nanozymes but also provides a
promising and environmentally friendly strategy for the remediation of
antibiotic contamination in the environment.

This article reports a concept of heat-induced topological modifications of
non-layered WO 3 followed by successful synthesis of oxygen-vacant more-porous
nanosheets with exposed active (002) facet. Experimental measurements and
Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations have revealed that the
photoexcited electrons are found to accumulate preferentially on (002) facet to
yield enhanced electron conduction, and consequently, strengthen the reduction
potential as active catalytic sites for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Owing to
these beneficial properties, the more-porous nanosheets of WO 3 with (002)
facet have exhibited superior performance than that of less-porous nanosheets
of WO3 with (220) facet and bulk WO3 with (205) facet. This study therefore
provides a new understanding of regulating physical, optical, and electronic
properties through intricate atomic structure modulation of WO3, and may find
widespread application in optoelectronics, sensors, and energy conversion.

### Visualizing anomalous exciton diffusion dynamics in TMDCs using transient scattering microscopy: the role of trap states and Auger recombination

Research on energy transport has advanced in recent years with the emergence
of transient microscopy techniques that allow for imaging of carriers with high
spatial and temporal resolution. In this context, transient scattering
microscopy (TScM), has emerged as an alternative to traditional techniques.
However, the sensitivity of TScM to different carriers can complicate the
interpretation of results, highlighting the need to develop models tailored to
TScM. Here, TScM is used to visualize exciton transport in bulk TMDCs. We show
that exciton populations exhibit non-Gaussian profiles by analyzing the their
excess kurtosis. Numerical simulations incorporating anomalous diffusion -such
as Auger recombination and trap states- reproduce these experimental
observations. Furthermore, by tuning the injected carrier density, we
demonstrate that the temporal signature of the kurtosis is distinct for
Auger-dominated and trap-dominated regimes. Additionally, we find that
traditional Gaussian-fitting methods can yield inconsistent results for the
extracted diffusivities. As an alternative, we implement a discrete variable
calculation which yields robust, consistent diffusivity values. Our results
establish kurtosis as a vital diagnostic parameter for identifying anomolous
diffusion and demonstrate the necessity of moving beyond Gaussian
approximations for accurate analysis of TScM data.

The precise incorporation of a phosphorus atom into a silicon surface is
essential for the fabrication of nanoelectronic devices in which the active
area is formed from single impurities. The most accurate approach employs
scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) lithography, which may be done with atomic
precision. However, the accuracy decreases when phosphorus is incorporated into
the surface because P substitutes one of two neighboring Si atoms with equal
probability. Here, the P-Si exchange mechanism was studied theoretically on a
chlorinated Si(100) surface with an asymmetric configuration of Cl vacancies
surrounding the P atom. Density functional theory was used to estimate the
activation barriers and exchange rates between a P atom and neighboring Si
atoms on a Si(100)-2$\times$1-Cl surface with three Cl vacancies. The
calculation of various P-Si exchange pathways revealed that phosphorus has a
higher probability of substituting one Si atom than the others due to the
asymmetric configuration of Cl vacancies. Based on the theoretical study of the
P-Si exchange mechanism and experimental results from previous works, a scheme
for controlled P incorporation into the silicon surface without uncertainty is
proposed.

### Transitions between positive and negative charge states of dangling bonds on a halogenated Si(100) surface

Dangling bonds (DBs) are common defects in silicon that affect its electronic
performance by trapping carriers at the in-gap levels. For probing the
electrical properties of individual DBs, a scanning tunneling microscope (STM)
is an effective instrument. Here we study transitions between charge states of
a single DB on chlorinated and brominated Si(100)-2$\times$1 surfaces in an
STM. We observed transitions between positively and negatively charged states
of the DB, without the participation of the neutral state. We demonstrated that
the $(+/-)$ transition occurs when the DB and substrate states are out of
equilibrium. This transition is related to the charge neutrality level (CNL),
which indicates a change in the DB's character from donor-like to
acceptor-like. The STM voltage at which the $(+/-)$ transition took place
varied depending to the electrostatic environment of the DB. Our results
complement the understanding of the electronic properties of the DBs, and they
should be taken into account in applications that use charge manipulation on
the DBs.

Atom probe tomography (APT) provides the three-dimensional composition of
materials at near-atomic length scales, achieving detection limits in the range
of tens of atomic parts-per-million regardless of element type. APT requires
the specimen to be shaped as a needle with a tip radius of ~100 nm. The
development of site-specific lift-out procedures using focused ion
beam-scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) has enabled APT analysis of
multifunctional materials, advancing our understanding of their
structure-composition-property relationships. Yet these approaches are not
readily suitable for analyzing many nanomaterials. Co-electrodeposition of
metallic films forms a composite containing the nanomaterials of interest,
thereby facilitating APT specimen preparation and enabling analysis of
nanowires, nanosheets, and nano- and microparticles, etc. In this perspective
article, we showcase diverse examples from simple elementary to compositionally
complex alloys of varying dimensionalities, from individual nanoparticles to
aerogel structures. We emphasize the challenges encountered with specific
material classes during co-electrodeposition procedures and provide
recommendations for improving specimen preparation protocols to enhance
measurement yield, thereby advancing APT analysis capabilities for optimizing
the performance of functional nanomaterials.

### Multiferrons: lattice excitations with finite polarization and magnetization

Ferrons are a type of quasiparticle corresponding to elementary excitations
of the ferroelectric order. Analogously to how magnons modulate and transport
magnetization, ferrons modulate and transport electric polarization. Here, we
introduce multiferrons as elementary excitations with both electric and
magnetic character. Multiferrons lead to a tilt and elliptical precession of
the polarization and at the same time create a magnetization through the
mechanism of dynamical multiferroicity. Using first-principles calculations for
LiNbO$_3$, we show that the electric polarization of multiferrons is
perpendicular to the equilibrium ferroelectric polarization, whereas the
magnetization is parallel to it. Our calculations further demonstrate that
multiferrons carry net electric and magnetic quadrupole and octupole moments,
which we term multipolons. These multipolons could couple to internal
multipolar degrees of freedom, for example in altermagnets, or to external
probes such as neutrons, leading to potentially experimentally observable
phenomena following coherent or thermal excitation of multiferrons.

### Multiscale Modeling of Abnormal Grain Growth: Role of Solute Segregation and Grain Boundary Character

Abnormal grain growth (AGG) influences the properties of polycrystalline
materials; however, the underlying mechanisms, particularly the role of solute
segregation at the grain boundary (GB), are difficult to quantify precisely.
This study demonstrates a multiscale framework that integrates atomic-scale
segregation energetics (using density functional theory) with mesoscale grain
growth dynamics (using phase-field model) to investigate AGG, using $\alpha$-Fe
as an example system. Multisite segregation energies are calculated for
symmetric tilt grain boundaries (STGBs) along the $\langle 110 \rangle$ axis
for nine different solutes (Co, Cr, Mn, Mo, Nb, Ni, Ti, W, and V), encompassing
three different types of coincident site lattice (CSL) boundaries: $\sum 3
(11\bar{2})$, $\sum 9 (\bar{2}21)$, and $\sum 3 (\bar{1}11)$. The model takes
into account the effect of solute drag on GB mobility, estimated using a bulk
solute concentration of 0.1 at\%. The results demonstrate that AGG originates
due to GB anisotropy, the extent of which largely depends on the type of solute
atom present. Such a complex dependence necessitates using a multiscale model
to understand AGG comprehensively. In general, low-energy $\Sigma 3$ boundaries
are found to have higher mobility and show preferential growth for most of the
solutes, other than Co. The study reveals how the distribution of GB types
significantly influences AGG. When 10-30\% of the GBs are high-mobility type,
crown-like morphologies are observed, leading to AGG. These findings underscore
the critical role of GB chemistry and crystallography in governing AGG, and the
model can be generalized to provide a predictive framework for controlling
grain growth through strategic solute design in advanced alloys.
