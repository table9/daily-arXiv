- **TL;DR**: 这篇论文质疑传统超导理论对迈斯纳效应的解释，提出在磁场排出过程中存在动量守恒问题，需要引入径向电荷运动来解释。

The Meissner effect, the expulsion of magnetic field from the interior of a
metal entering the superconducting state, is arguably the most fundamental
property of superconductors, discovered in 1933. The conventional theory of
superconductivity developed in 1957 is generally believed to fully explain the
Meissner effect. We will review the arguments that support this consensus,
rooted in the concept of emergence. However, recent work has shown that there
are questions related to momentum conservation in the process of magnetic field
expulsion that have not been addressed within the conventional theory. Within a
reductionist approach, it has been proposed that those questions can only be
resolved by introducing physics that is not part of the conventional theory,
namely that there is radial motion of electric charge in the transition
process. This is consistent with the behavior of classical plasmas, where
motion of magnetic field lines is always associated with motion of charges. We
review how this approach explains puzzles associated with momentum transfer
between electrons and ions in the Meissner effect. Whether or not radial charge
motion is associated with the Meissner effect has fundamental implications
regarding superconductivity mechanisms in materials and regarding strategies to
search for new materials with higher superconducting transition temperatures.
Therefore, adjudication of this question is urgent and important.

- **TL;DR**: 本文研究了超导体/磁体异质结构中的邻近效应，比较了金属性和绝缘性磁体（铁磁体和交变磁体）对超导体电子谱的影响，发现有效模型仅适用于绝缘磁体异质结构。

Proximity effect in thin-film superconductor (S)/magnet heterostructures with
different types of magnets including ferromagnets, antiferromagnets and
altermagnets is widely considered in the framework of an effective model, where
the heterostructure is replaced by a homogeneous superconductor in the presence
of a homogeneous exchange field of a corresponding type. Here we study the
extent to which such a model is actually applicable to ballistic thin-film
superconductor/magnetic heterostructures. In particular, a comparative analysis
of thin-film superconductor/magnetic metal and superconductor/magnetic
insulator heterostructures is performed. Metallic and insulating ferromagnets
(FM, FI) and altermagnets (AM, AI) are considered. It is shown that in the S/FI
and S/AI heterostructures the the proximity effect creates a well-defined spin
splitting of the electronic spectra in the S layer. Thus, they are well
described by the effective model. At the same time, the proximity effect in
S/FM and S/AM heterostructures also creates a spin splitting of the spectra of
the S layer, but it has a chaotic spectral and spatial distribution and
unpredictable amplitude and, in general, cannot be detected via the spin
splitting of the superconducting density of states. Thus, the effective model
is not applicable to such heterostructures. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that
they support well-pronounced triplet correlations and, thus, can be used for
spintronics applications.

- **TL;DR**: 研究了通过UHV直流磁控溅射沉积的W0.75Re0.25超导薄膜，通过掺入N2调控晶体相，揭示了晶体相对薄膜输运性质的影响。

W0.75Re0.25, in its bulk form, has been shown to be an interesting
superconducting material due to its multiple crystalline phases, each
exhibiting distinct superconducting characteristics. However, little is known
about how these phases manifest in thin-film form, where deposition conditions
and dimensionality are critical aspects. Here, we investigate superconducting
W0.75Re0.25 thin films deposited via UHV dc magnetron sputtering. In order to
tune the crystalline phase of the films, we further explored the effect of
incorporating N2 during the deposition. The superconducting and normal-state
properties as a function of deposition conditions were investigated, revealing
the role of the crystal phase on the film transport properties.

### Altermon: a magnetic-field-free parity protected qubit based on a narrow altermagnet Josephson junction

Altermagnets provide a new route to engineer superconducting circuits without
magnetic fields. We theoretically study the Andreev bound state (ABS) spectrum
of a finite-width altrmagnet-based Josephson junction and show how the $d$-wave
altermagnetic symmetry and geometric confinement shape its low-energy
excitations. We find a clear distinction between the two $d$-wave symmetries:
$d_{x^2-y^2}$ order produces spin splitting, whereas $d_{xy}$ order preserves
spin degeneracy and exhibits splitting of the ABS spectrum induced by intermode
hybridization. Leveraging these novel features, we propose applying a
transverse electric field to tune the system and realize a magnetic-field-free,
parity-protected superconducting qubit that we call altermon.

### Space charge and ion transport in aerosol neutralization: Toward a concentration-dependent alternative to the $N_it$ product

- **TL;DR**: 该研究量化了带电粒子浓度对气溶胶颗粒中和速率的影响，重点关注由净空间电荷产生的内部电场对离子动力学的塑造作用。传统的中和器性能评估通常使用N_it乘积，该假设准中性条件并忽略小电荷不平衡产生的电场。

In this study, we quantify how charged particle concentration affects the
neutralization rate of aerosol particles, focusing on the role of ion dynamics
shaped by internal electric fields arising from net space charge. Conventional
neutralizer performance is typically evaluated using the $N_it$ product, which
assumes quasi-neutral conditions and neglects electric fields from small charge
imbalances. We demonstrate that internal electric fields become increasingly
important at high aerosol concentrations and significantly influence
neutralization dynamics. We develop a coupled ion--aerosol transport model in a
two-dimensional axisymmetric geometry that includes ion generation, convection,
diffusion, recombination, attachment to aerosols, and wall loss, with
self-consistent electric fields obtained from the Poisson equation. Results
show that even small net charges generate electric fields that enhance ion
drift and accelerate neutralization, effects not captured by traditional
$N_it$-based approaches. Using a neutralization time metric, we find that
neutralization becomes slower with increasing aerosol number concentration
$N_p$, higher initial particle charge $q_0$, and smaller particle diameter
$d_p$ when space charge is absent. When space charge is included, the influence
of $q_0$ and $d_p$ diminishes, while $N_p$ becomes the dominant factor
governing neutralization behavior. Accordingly, we propose a
concentration-dependent analytical expression for mean charge relaxation that
captures coupled ion--aerosol transport and space charge effects. The modeling
framework presented here is applicable to laboratory instruments, industrial
processes, and atmospheric environments where electrostatic interactions govern
aerosol behavior.

### A Physics-Informed Machine Learning Framework for Solid Boundary Treatment in Meshfree Particle Methods

- **Categories**: physics.comp-ph, physics.flu-dyn
- **TL;DR**: 提出基于物理信息机器学习的边界处理方法，用CNN-MLP网络直接预测粒子近似的边界修正项，替代传统虚粒子方法，提高计算效率和精度。

Meshfree particle methods, such as Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) and
the Moving Particle Semi-Implicit (MPS) method, are widely used to simulate
complex free-surface and multiphase flows. A key challenge in these methods is
the treatment of solid boundaries, where kernel truncation causes errors and
instabilities. Traditional treatments, such as ghost particles and
semi-analytical wall corrections, restore kernel completeness but add
significant computational cost and complexity, especially for irregular
geometries. We propose a physics-informed machine learning (ML) framework that
directly predicts boundary correction terms for particle approximations,
eliminating the need for ghost particles or analytical corrections. The
framework is based on a hybrid convolutional neural network-multilayer
perceptron (CNN-MLP) trained on physics-informed features that capture local
geometry, particle states, and kernel properties. Once trained, it provides
consistent boundary contributions across all spatial differential operators,
including gradients, divergences, and Laplacians. The approach is demonstrated
with MPS but is readily extensible to other particle methods such as SPH. Tests
with predefined fields, unsteady diffusion, and incompressible Navier-Stokes
flows demonstrate accuracy comparable to that of ghost-particle methods while
reducing computational overhead. The model generalizes well to unseen
geometries, flow conditions, and particle distributions, including dynamically
evolving domains. This work establishes a flexible, physics-informed ML
paradigm for boundary treatment in particle-based PDE solvers, improving both
accuracy and scalability across a broad class of meshfree methods.

### First-passage properties of the jump process with a drift. The general case

- **TL;DR**: 研究具有恒定漂移的跳跃过程的首次通过特性，识别了由漂移强度决定的三种状态：生存（弱漂移）、吸收（强漂移）和临界状态。

We study the first-passage properties of a jump process with constant drift
where jump amplitudes and inter-arrival times follow arbitrary light-tailed
distributions with smooth densities. Using a mapping to an effective
discrete-time random walk, we identify three regimes determined by the drift
strength: survival (weak drift), absorption (strong drift), and critical. We
derive explicit expressions for exponential decay rates in the survival and
absorption regimes, and characterize algebraic decay at the critical point. We
also obtain asymptotic behavior of the mean first-passage time, number of
jumps, and their variances for processes starting either close to the origin or
far from it.

### Interplay of Noise and Reservoir-induced Decoherence in Persistent Currents

- **TL;DR**: 研究非平衡环境下紧束缚环中的持续电流行为，发现电流表现出非单调行为，表明存在两种不同的退相干机制：一种是来自储层耦合引入的相干长度尺度，另一种是由噪声强度与储层耦合比驱动的更微妙机制。

Persistent current is a hallmark of quantum phase coherence. We study the
fate of the persistent current in a non-equilibrium setting, where a
tight-binding ring is subjected to stochastic disorder as well as a fermionic
reservoir attached to each site. We evaluate the current using Keldysh
technique and find that it exhibits non-monotonic behavior, suggesting two
distinct mechanisms of decoherence. While coupling to the reservoirs introduces
a coherence length scale given by the inverse of the coupling strength, the
other mechanism is more subtle and driven by the ratio of noise strength to
reservoir coupling. The interplay of noise and reservoir constitutes a purely
non-equilibrium steady state with a flatter distribution function that we
effectively describe using classical rate equations. We discuss possibilities
of realizing our findings in ultracold-atom experiments.

### Non-invertible bosonic chiral symmetry on the lattice

- **TL;DR**: 在晶格希尔伯特空间中实现了3+1维非可逆Z_N手征对称性生成元，使用无限维U(1)转子位点希尔伯特空间，通过Villain formulation的U(1)晶格规范理论构建手征对称性生成元。

In this work we realize the 3 + 1 dimensional non-invertible ${\mathbb{Z}}_N$
chiral symmetry generator as an operator in a many body lattice Hilbert space.
A crucial ingredient in our construction is the use of infinite dimensional
$U(1)$ rotor site Hilbert spaces. Specifically, our Hilbert space is that of a
$U(1)$ lattice gauge theory coupled to a charge $1$ scalar in the Villain
formulation, which allows for direct access to monopoles and for a simple
definition of a magnetic ${\mathbb{Z}}_N$ one-form symmetry $Z^{(1)}_m$ , at
the lattice Hamiltonian level. We construct the generator of the
${\mathbb{Z}}_N$ chiral symmetry as as a unitary operator in the subspace of
$Z^{(1)}_m$-invariant states, and show that it cannot be extended to the entire
Hilbert space while preserving locality and unitarity. Using a lattice-level
duality based on gauging $Z^{(1)}_m$, we find a dual description of this
subspace, as the subspace of a charge $1/N$ gauge theory invariant under an
electric one-form symmetry $Z^{(1)}_e$. We show that in this dual formulation,
the chiral symmetry generator does extend unitarily to the entire Hilbert
space, but has a mixed anomaly with the $Z^{(1)}_e$ symmetry.

### XDXD: End-to-end crystal structure determination with low resolution X-ray diffraction

- **TL;DR**: XDXD是首个端到端深度学习框架，可直接从低分辨率单晶X射线衍射数据确定完整原子模型，无需手动图谱解释。

Determining crystal structures from X-ray diffraction data is fundamental
across diverse scientific fields, yet remains a significant challenge when data
is limited to low resolution. While recent deep learning models have made
breakthroughs in solving the crystallographic phase problem, the resulting
low-resolution electron density maps are often ambiguous and difficult to
interpret. To overcome this critical bottleneck, we introduce XDXD, to our
knowledge, the first end-to-end deep learning framework to determine a complete
atomic model directly from low-resolution single-crystal X-ray diffraction
data. Our diffusion-based generative model bypasses the need for manual map
interpretation, producing chemically plausible crystal structures conditioned
on the diffraction pattern. We demonstrate that XDXD achieves a 70.4\% match
rate for structures with data limited to 2.0~\AA{} resolution, with a
root-mean-square error (RMSE) below 0.05. Evaluated on a benchmark of 24,000
experimental structures, our model proves to be robust and accurate.
Furthermore, a case study on small peptides highlights the model's potential
for extension to more complex systems, paving the way for automated structure
solution in previously intractable cases.

### Discovering How Ice Crystals Grow Using Neural ODE's and Symbolic Regression

- **TL;DR**: 使用神经常微分方程和符号回归学习沉积冰生长模型中的未知物理过程，提出了包含冰晶质量相关项的改进电容生长模型

Depositional ice growth is an important process for cirrus cloud evolution,
but the physics of ice growth in atmospheric conditions is still poorly
understood. One major challenge in constraining depositional ice growth models
against observations is that the early growth rates of ice crystals cannot be
directly observed, and proposed models require assumptions about the functional
dependence of physical processes that are still highly uncertain. Neural
ordinary differential equations (NODE's) are a recently developed machine
learning method that can be used to learn the derivative of an unknown
function. Here we use NODE's to learn the functional dependence of unknown
physics in the depositional ice growth model by optimizing against experimental
measurements of ice crystal mass. We find a functional form for the
depositional ice growth model that best fits 290 mass time series of ice
crystals grown in a levitation diffusion chamber. We use symbolic regression to
derive an equation for the function learned by the NODE model, which includes
additional terms proportional to ice crystal mass in the capacitance growth
model. We evaluate this functional form against experimental data sets from the
AIDA Aerosol and Cloud Chamber, finding that our new proposed model for
depositional ice growth accurately reproduces experimental results in the early
stages of ice crystal growth.

### Committors without Descriptors

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种基于图神经网络的自动提交器方法，用于增强分子动力学模拟中的稀有事件采样，能够直接处理原子坐标而非描述符，特别适用于涉及溶剂分子的系统。

The study of rare events is one of the major challenges in atomistic
simulations, and several enhanced sampling methods towards its solution have
been proposed. Recently, it has been suggested that the use of the committor,
which provides a precise formal description of rare events, could be of use in
this context. We have recently followed up on this suggestion and proposed a
committor-based method that promotes frequent transitions between the
metastable states of the system and allows extensive sampling of the process
transition state ensemble. One of the strengths of our approach is being
self-consistent and semi-automatic, exploiting a variational criterion to
iteratively optimize a neural-network-based parametrization of the committor,
which uses a set of physical descriptors as input. Here, we further automate
this procedure by combining our previous method with the expressive power of
graph neural networks, which can directly process atomic coordinates rather
than descriptors. Besides applications on benchmark systems, we highlight the
advantages of a graph-based approach in describing the role of solvent
molecules in systems, such as ion pair dissociation or ligand binding.

### Transitions driven by multibody interactions in an effective model of active matter

- **TL;DR**: 该研究通过Fox-UCNA近似和高维分析，揭示了活性粒子系统中多体相互作用在相变中的关键作用，发现了类似MIPS的一级相变和新的液-液相变。

When out-of-equilibrium particles interact by means of pairwise forces, their
stationary distribution in general exhibits many-body interactions. In the
particular case of active particles, it has been shown numerically that the
Motility Induced Phase Separation cannot be explained by the effective
attraction emerging from two isolated particles, thereby highlighting the role
of multibody interactions. In this work, we study the thermodynamics of the
Fox-UCNA approximation for active particles interacting by means of pairwise
repulsive forces. Working at large space dimension we establish that multibody
interactions up to infinite order are instrumental in giving rise to such
collective phenomena as phase transitions. We recover a MIPS-like first order
transition, but also find a liquid-liquid transition at somewhat lower
persistence times. This new transition is connected to a spin glass phase of
orientational-like degrees of freedom with disordered interactions set by the
particle positions themselves.

### Magnus Induced Magnetic Diode Effect in Skyrmion Systems

- **TL;DR**: 该论文展示了斯格明子可以表现出磁二极管效应，即在磁场反转时产生非互易的输运响应。这种效应通过斯格明子在具有锯齿形不对称势垒的通道中运动实现。

We show that skyrmions can exhibit what we call a magnetic diode effect,
where there is a nonreciprocal response in the transport when the magnetic
field is reversed. This effect can be achieved for skyrmions moving in a
channel with a sawtooth potential on one side and a reversed sawtooth potential
on the other side. We consider the cases of both spin-transfer torque (STT) and
spin-orbit torque (SOT) driving. When the magnetic field is held fixed, the
velocity response of the skyrmion is the same for current applied in either
direction for both STT and SOT driving, so there is no current diode effect.
When the magnetic field is reversed, under STT driving the velocity of the
skyrmion reverses and its absolute value changes. Under SOT driving, the
velocity remains in the same direction but drops to a much lower value,
resulting in negative differential conductivity. For a fixed current, we find a
nonreciprocal skyrmion velocity as a function of positive and negative applied
fields, in analogy to the velocity-current curves observed in the usual diode
effect. The nonreciprocity is generated by the Magnus force, which causes
skyrmions to interact preferentially with one side of the channel. Since the
channel sides have opposite asymmetry, a positive magnetic field can cause the
skyrmion to interact with the "hard" asymmetry side of the channel, while a
negative magnetic field causes the skyrmion to interact with the easy asymmetry
side. This geometry could be used to create new kinds of magnetic-field-induced
diode effects that can be harnessed in new types of skyrmion-based devices.

### Probing Hidden Symmetry and Altermagnetism with Sub-Picometer Sensitivity via Nonlinear Transport

- **TL;DR**: 本文提出非线性输运作为探测隐藏晶体对称性的新方法，在Ca3Ru2O7中发现了传统衍射无法检测到的低对称性相，揭示了从传统反铁磁到altermagnet的转变。

X-ray and neutron diffraction are foundational tools for determining crystal
structures, but their resolution limits can lead to misassignments, especially
in materials with subtle distortions or competing phases. Here, we demonstrate
the use of nonlinear transport as a complementary approach to uncover hidden
crystal symmetries, using the strongly correlated Ca$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ as a case
study. Below 48 K (T$_S$), where the magnetic moments of the antiferromagnetic
phase reorient from the a- to the b-axis, leading to a pseudogap opening, our
measurements, with support of DFT, reveal a previously overlooked
lower-symmetry phase. This is manifested by the emergence of longitudinal
nonlinear resistance (NLR) along the b-axis below T$_S$, providing direct
evidence of combined translational and time-reversal symmetry breaking. This
response also suggests a transformation from a conventional antiferromagnet
into an altermagnet. The lower-symmetry phase arises from a subtle lattice
distortion (~0.1 pm) associated with the magnetic transition at T$_S$, below
the detection limit of conventional diffraction. Moreover, this NLR below T$_S$
is accompanied by a nonlinear Hall effect, both of which are enhanced by the
large quantum metric associated with Weyl chains near the Fermi surface. Our
findings demonstrate nonlinear transport as a sensitive probe of hidden
symmetry breaking and altermagnetism, complementing and extending beyond the
reach of traditional diffraction and spectroscopic techniques.

### Simplifying Generation of Special Quasirandom Structures with ATAT Using Interactive Online Interface -- SimplySQS

- **TL;DR**: 开发了SimplySQS在线工具，简化ATAT mcsqs模块的使用，通过图形界面自动化SQS生成流程，并在PSTO钙钛矿系列中验证了工具的有效性。

The special quasirandom structure (SQS) method is a widely used approach for
modeling random alloys with periodic boundary conditions. Among available
implementations, the Alloy Theoretic Automated Toolkit (ATAT) mcsqs module
remains one of the most established tools for SQS generation. However, its
command-line operation and input file preparation often present a steep
learning curve, particularly for students and researchers without programming
experience. To lower these barriers, we have developed SimplySQS
(simplysqs.com), an online, browser-based interactive interface that automates
the preparation, execution, and analysis of ATAT mcsqs outputs. SimplySQS
allows users to upload or import structures from databases (MP, AFLOW, COD),
configure compositions and supercells via guided forms, automatically generate
ATAT input and batch scripts, and visualize results such as convergence
behavior, correlation functions, and radial distribution functions. The best
SQS outputs can be exported in standard formats (POSCAR, CIF, LMP, XYZ). By
simplifying setup and minimizing file-handling errors, SimplySQS broadens
access to ATAT mcsqs, making SQS generation more approachable for beginners
while streamlining workflows for experienced users. The workflow is illustrated
on the perovskite series Pb1-xSrxTiO3 (PSTO, including PbTiO3 (PTO) and SrTiO3
(STO)), where an all-in-one batch script generated with SimplySQS was used to
obtain SQSs across the composition range. The resulting structures were
subsequently optimized using the MACE MATPES-r2SCAN-0 universal
machine-learning interatomic potential (MLIP) to predict evolution of lattice
parameters. The MLIP accurately reproduced the cubic-to-tetragonal transition
near x = 0.5, with lattice parameters deviating by less than 1 % in the cubic
(x &gt; 0.5) and 3 % in the tetragonal (x &lt; 0.5) regions.

interactions these materials promise advances in nanotechnology by enabling
seamless integration of molecular systems with metallic electrodes. Here we
show that electron beam irradiation induces direct self patterning of silver
fractal nanoelectrodes on the technomolecular nanosheets, with formation
influenced by molecular structure: saturated variants yield localized
nanoparticles, while conjugated ones produce propagated fractals via electron
delocalization and cross linking. In situ transmission electron microscopy
reveals dynamic diffusion aggregation mechanisms, allowing controlled circuit
patterns through resist free electron beam lithography. This approach advances
flexible electronics, bioelectronics, and energy conversion, including fractal
antennas and unclonable identifiers.

- **TL;DR**: 提出基于Godunov光滑粒子流体动力学的新数值方法，用于特殊相对论流体动力学，通过黎曼求解器提高激波精度，并采用非等重子数和变平滑长度的新密度计算方法。

This paper proposes a novel numerical method based on Godunov Smoothed
Particle Hydrodynamics for special relativistic fluid dynamics. Our method
utilizes a Riemann solver to describe shock, enhancing accuracy in strong shock
waves. The formulation maintains conservation laws and achieves higher accuracy
through convolution integrals that define physical quantities for SPH
particles. We also propose the number density calculation method that uses a
non-equal baryon number in each SPH particle and variable smoothing length in a
way different from the conventional method. Numerical experiments demonstrate
the method's robustness across one- and two-dimensional relativistic shock tube
problems, as well as its ability to simulate Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities
accurately, validating SRGSPH as a reliable approach for high-resolution
relativistic simulations.

In this work, quantum Stirling engines based on monolayer, AB-stacked
bilayer, and ABC-stacked trilayer graphene under perpendicular magnetic fields
are analyzed. Performance maps of the useful work \((\eta W)\) reveal a robust
optimum at low magnetic fields and moderately low temperatures, with all
stackings capable of reaching Carnot efficiency under suitable configurations.
The AB bilayer achieves this across the broadest parameter window while
sustaining finite work, the monolayer exhibits highly constrained regimes, and
the trilayer shows smoother trends with sizable \(\eta W\). These results
identify multilayer graphene, particularly the AB bilayer, as a promising
platform for efficient Stirling engines, while also highlighting the
versatility of the monolayer in realizing all four operational regimes of the
Stirling cycle.

### A Hall viscosity for skyrmion via magnon interaction

- **TL;DR**: 从DMI相互作用中识别出霍尔黏度项，该项在绝缘磁体中影响斯格明子运动，与斯格明子电荷成正比，且斯格明子霍尔角对形状、尺寸和交换/DMI参数比有显著依赖性。

We identify a Hall viscosity term directly from the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
interaction (DMI), that breaks parity symmetry, in the skyrmion motion of
insulating magnets by time-averaging the magnon contribution to all orders. The
viscosity term is proportional to the skyrmion charge. Skyrmion Hall angle
shows significant dependence on the skyrmion shape and size, the ratio of
exchange over DMI parameters, while roughly independent of the Gilbert damping
parameter. The Hall angles have the same magnitude for opposite skyrmion
charges. We speculate a velocity-dependent Hall viscosity contribution to seek
asymmetric Hall angles for the opposite charges.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文研究了手性和轴性在极性介导下的有效耦合机制，提出了手性诱导轴性和轴性诱导手性的双向耦合概念，为稳定单畴态和界面功能应用提供了新途径。

In condensed matter physics, a broad spectrum of physical characteristics,
such as chirality, axiality, and polarity, arises as a direct consequence of
the underlying symmetry of the system. We here theoretically investigate the
effective coupling between chirality and axiality at their domain boundaries,
mediated by polarity. Based on symmetry considerations and model analyses, we
propose the concept of chirality-induced axiality via surface polarization,
which refers to a phenomenon where the handedness of chirality selects an axial
moment with a particular orientation by lowering its energy at the surface. We
further establish the inverse process, termed axiality-induced chirality via
surface polarization, whereby axiality in turn dictates the preferred
chirality. These reciprocal couplings open a new pathway for stabilizing
single-domain states of chirality and axiality. They further imply interfacial
functionalities, including the selective adsorption of chiral and axial
molecules.

We present an automated benchmarking suite for face-centered-cubic (FCC)
nickel that evaluates 47 quantitative metrics spanning both standard tests
(equation of state, elastic constants, surface energies and phonons) and
application-specific scenarios such as defect formation and migration, grain
boundaries, step edges, close-range interactions, and vacancy cluster
energetics. Using this framework, we assess 34 interatomic potentials from the
OpenKIM repository, including pairwise, embedded-atom, modified-embedded-atom,
angular-dependent, and spectral neighbor analysis potentials (SNAP). Results
are compared against ab initio benchmarks compiled from the literature. Most
potentials accurately reproduce lattice parameters, elastic constants, and
surface energies, whereas predictive accuracy degrades for migration barriers
and short-range compression. Principal-component analysis identifies correlated
property groups and a partially orthogonal component associated with migration
and short-range physics, revealing Pareto trade-offs between accuracy domains.
SNAP models occupy the lowest-error frontier, although several embedded-atom
potentials remain competitive across many metrics. The framework provides a
reproducible baseline for potential selection, highlights systematic
limitations across formalisms, and supports benchmarking-in-the-loop strategies
for developing next-generation machine-learning potentials for Ni and Ni-based
alloys.

We propose a relativistic unitary coupled cluster (UCC) expectation value
approach for computing first-order properties of heavy-element systems. Both
perturbative (UCC3) and non-perturbative (qUCC) commutator-based formulations
are applied to evaluate ground-state properties, including the permanent dipole
moment (PDM), magnetic hyperfine structure (HFS) constant, and electric field
gradient (EFG). The results are compared with available experimental data and
those from conventional coupled cluster (CC) calculations. The non-perturbative
commutator-based approach truncated at the singles and doubles level (qUCCSD)
exhibits markedly better agreement with both CCSD and experiment than the
perturbative UCC3 method, likely due to its improved treatment of relaxation
effects.

In this paper, the results of numerical experiments verifying a novel setup
for laser beam profiling are presented. The experimental setup is based on
infrared thermography and includes laser beam illuminating a thin metal plate.
The method allows to determine four parameters of the short high-power laser
pulse, namely the Super-Gaussian profile coefficient, laser power, pulse start
time and duration. The unknown parameters are retrieved based on temporal and
spatial temperature distributions at the rear side of the illuminated plate.
The applied inverse method is based on Levenberg-Marquardt technique and it is
implemented in the GNU Octave environment. Solutions of the forward problem are
obtained numerically, with the aid of three-dimensional transient heat transfer
model implemented in the commercial software ANSYS Fluent. The paper presents
the results of the sensitivity analysis as well as calibration and verification
of the developed inverse algorithm through application of numerically-generated
synthetic data. Strengths and weaknesses of the applied approach are widely
discussed.

- **TL;DR**: 本文研究了三种具有双态切换特性的化学动力学系统，分析了它们首次通过时间的非单调波动现象，并探讨了随机重置协议在加速首次通过过程中的有效性。

Interesting theoretical problems of target search or threshold crossing,
formally known as {\it first passage}, often arise in both diffusive transport
problems as well as problems of chemical reaction kinetics. We study three
systems following different chemical kinetics, and are special as they {\it
toggle between two states}: (i) a population dynamics of cells with
auto-catalytic birth and intermittent toxic chemical-induced forced death, (ii)
a bond cluster model representing membrane adhesion to extracellular matrix
under a fluctuating load, and (iii) a model of gene transcription with a
regulated promoter switching between active and inactive states. Each of these
systems has a target state to attain, which defines a first passage problem --
namely, population becoming extinct, complete membrane detachment, or mRNA
count crossing a threshold. We study the fluctuations in first passage time and
show that it is interestingly {\it non-monotonic} in all these cases, with
increasing strength of bias towards the target. We also study suitable {\it
stochastic resetting} protocols to expedite first passage for these systems,
and show that there is a re-entrant transition of the efficacy of this protocol
in all the three cases, as a function of the bias. The exact analytical
condition for these transitions predicted in earlier literature is verified
here through simulations.

We present the instrument concept for KVASIR, a backscattering indirect
time-of-flight neutron spectrometer for the European Spallation Source (ESS).
KVASIR will probe low lying excitations of single crystal hard condensed matter
that many advanced technologies rely upon. The instrument is simultaneously
optimized for high resolution of energy-and momentum transfer, while ensuring
perturbation by high magnetic fields. Detailed ray tracing simulations,
considering the true geometry and aberrations of the analyser configuration
have been performed. The proposed concept has room for polarisation analysis
and extreme sample environments. Inelastic neutron scattering studies of single
crystal hard condensed matter, with a particular focus on quantum, at yet
unseen spatial and dynamic precision under extreme conditions are hereby
enabled.

Magnetite is an important mineral with many interesting applications related
to its magnetic, electrical and thermal properties. Typically studied by
electronic structure calculations, these methods are unable to capture the
complex ion dynamics at relevant temperatures, time and length scales. We
present a hybrid Monte Carlo/Molecular Dynamics (MC/MD) method based on iron
oxidation state exchange for accurate atomistic modelling of bulk magnetite,
magnetite surfaces and nanoparticles that captures the complex ionic dynamics.
By comparing oxidation state patterns with those obtained from density
functional theory, we confirmed the accuracy of our approach. Lattice
distortions leading to the stabilisation of excess charges and a critical
surface thickness at which the oxidation states transition from ordered to
disordered were observed. This simple yet efficient approach paves the way for
elucidating aspects of oxidation state ordering of inverse spinel structures in
general and battery materials in particular.

### Non-Resonant Raman Optical Activity As Explored Via Phase-Space Electronic Structure Theory

In order to model experimental non-resonant Raman optical activity, chemists
must compute a host of second-order response tensors, (e.g. the electric-dipole
magnetic-dipole polarizability) and their nuclear derivatives. While these
response functions are almost always computed along vibrational modes within a
Born-Oppenheimer (BO) framework, here we provide a natural interpretation of
the electric-dipole magnetic-dipole polarizability within phase space
electronic structure theory, a beyond-BO model whereby the electronic structure
depends on nuclear momentum P in addition to nuclear position R. By coupling to
nuclear momentum, phase space electronic structure theory is able to capture
the asymmetric response of the electronic properties to an external field, in
sofar as for a vibrating (non-stationary) molecule, the partial derivatives
dmu/dB is not equal to dm/dF where mu and m are the electrical linear and
magnetic dipoles, and F and B are electric and magnetic fields. As an example,
for a prototypical methyloxirane molecule, we show that phase space electronic
structure theory is able to deliver a reasonably good match with experimental
results for a reasonable choice of gauge origin.

### LENNs: Locally Enhanced Neural Networks for High-Fidelity Modeling in Solid Mechanics

- **TL;DR**: 提出局部增强神经网络(LENNs)解决固体力学中局部不连续性问题，通过全局网络和局部网络的多级建模，结合平滑窗口函数，有效处理光滑全局响应和近尖端奇异性。

Despite prior advances in PINNs, significant challenges remain in localized
solid mechanics problems because of the limitations of single network
formulations in simultaneous resolution of smooth global responses and near-tip
singularities, and inadequacy in discontinuity representation, leading to
unstable training and limited accuracy. To address the challenges, we propose
Locally Enhanced Neural Networks (LENNs) that characterize localized
discontinuities in solid mechanics via multilevel modeling. In particular, this
novel framework employs a global network for the bulk solution and activates a
local network in localized area for non-smooth response, coupled through a
smooth window function that enables weighted superposition of local and global
solutions. Moreover, the local network embeds additional functions that encode
the discontinuous information into the input to capture localized non-smooth
mechanical behaviors. Finally, the composite solution is substituted into the
total potential energy functional for unified optimization. With this
structure, the method resolves the conflict of single network in representing
both smooth global and singular local fields without additional interface-loss
terms and amplifies the contribution of localized critical features in energy
optimization. We focus on a series of numerical experiments in solid mechanics
to demonstrate the performance of the method. Results show that LENNs perform
well in addressing localized discontinuous problems and provide accurate
predictions for both displacement and stress fields.

We investigate magnetic and thermodynamic properties of a spin-1 Heisenberg
diamond chain in a magnetic field using a combination of analytical and
numerical methods including the variational approach, exact diagonalization,
density-matrix renormalization group, localized-magnon theory, and quantum
Monte Carlo simulations. In the unfrustrated regime, the model exhibits a
quantum ferrimagnetic phase that captures key magnetic features of the
nickel-based polymeric compound [Ni3(OH)2(C4H2O4)(H2O)4].2H2O such as a at
minimum in the temperature dependence of the susceptibility times temperature
product and an intermediate one-third magnetization plateau. In the frustrated
regime, we uncover a rich variety of unconventional quantum phases including
uniform and cluster-based Haldane states, fragmented monomer-dimer phase, and
bound-magnon crystals. Analysis of the adiabatic temperature change and
magnetic Gruneisen parameter reveals an enhanced magnetocaloric effect near
field-induced transitions between these exotic quantum phases. Additionally, we
demonstrate that the frustrated spin-1 diamond chain can operate as an
efficient working medium of a quantum Stirling engine, which approaches
near-optimal efficiency when driven into these unconventional quantum states.

Antiferromagnets have garnered significant attention due to their negligible
stray field and ultrafast magnetic dynamics, which are promising for
high-density and ultrafast spintronic applications. Their dual functionality as
both spin sources and information carriers could enable all-electrical
self-induced switching of antiferromagnetic order, offering great potential for
ultra-compact spintronic devices. However, related progress is still elusive.
Here, we report the deterministic switching of chiral antiferromagnetic orders
induced by charge current at zero external magnetic field in the van der Waals
(vdW) magnetically intercalated transition metal dichalcogenide CoTa3S6. This
system exhibits strong interactions between cobalt atom magnetic moment lattice
and itinerant electrons within the metallic layers, as demonstrated by
temperature-dependent angle-resolved photoemission, scanning tunneling
spectroscopy, and topological Nernst effect measurements. Notably, the
itinerant-localization interactions lead to current-induced chiral spin orbit
torques as well as Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) exchange torques that
interact with the localized magnetic moments, facilitating all-electrical
switching of the chiral magnetic order in the CoTa3S6 flake. Our work opens a
promising avenue for manipulating antiferromagnetic orders by delicately
engineering the synergistic interactions between magnetic moments and itinerant
electrons.

Symmetries rigidly delimit the landscape of quantum matter. Recently
uncovered spatially modulated symmetries, whose actions vary with position,
enable excitations with restricted mobility, while Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM)
type anomalies impose sharp constraints on which lattice phases are realizable.
In one dimensional a spin chain, gauging procedures have linked modulated
symmetry to LSM type anomaly, but a general understanding beyond 1D remains
incomplete. We show that spatially modulated symmetries and their associated
dipole algebras naturally emerge from gauging ordinary symmetries in the
presence of generalized LSM type anomalies. We construct explicit lattice
models in two and three spatial dimensions and develop complementary field
theoretic descriptions in arbitrary spatial dimensions that connect LSM anomaly
inflow to higher-group symmetry structures governing the modulated symmetries.
Our results provide a unified, nonperturbative framework that ties together LSM
constraints and spatially modulated symmetries across dimensions.

Improving energy efficiency by recovering waste heat and providing thermal
protection is of high technological importance. This work investigates the
chalcogenide compounds CdGa2Te4 and ZnGa2Te4 using density functional theory
and BoltzTraP2 calculations. Both materials are dynamically stable, brittle,
and elastically anisotropic. Electronic structure calculations show direct band
gaps that range from 1.0 to 2.2 electronvolt. Carrier effective masses are
favorable, with CdGa2Te4 showing light electrons equal to 0.21 times the free
electron mass and ZnGa2Te4 showing moderately heavy carriers equal to 0.39
times the free electron mass. Thermoelectric transport calculations yield large
Seebeck coefficients of about 108 to 119 microvolt per kelvin. The
thermoelectric figure of merit ZT increases from about 0.4 at 50 K to about
0.78 at 800 kelvin, indicating promising thermoelectric performance. For
thermal barrier coating applications, both compounds combine ultralow lattice
thermal conductivity with moderate melting points around 790 to 850 K and small
thermal expansion coefficients, which helps resist thermal stress. Overall,
CdGa2Te4 and ZnGa2Te4 are multifunctional materials suitable for efficient
waste heat recovery and durable thermal barrier operation below 900 K.

### Stable rational approximations for parabolic equation methods

Modern parabolic equation (PE) methods for wave propagation rely on
application of a variety of fractional-powered differential operators. Rational
approximations of these operators need to properly map their spectra onto the
complex plane, accurately handling propagating modes while annihilating
evanescent ones. Standard approaches for stable and accurate rational
approximations include rotating the branch cut of the operators or imposing
stability constraint equations, and have yielded accurate results for wave
propagation in a variety of fluid, elastic, and fluid-elastic waveguides. The
stability constraint method, however, does not yield operators that are stable
for all fluid-elastic waveguides, and a recent study of waveguides comprised of
a thin elastic layer overlaying a thick fluid layer revealed instabilities in
the approximations derived from rotated operators. In this paper, we
demonstrate the applicability of a different rational approximation method, the
recently-developed adaptive Antoulas-Anderson (AAA) algorithm, to simulations
of wave propagation using the fluid-elastic parabolic equation. We find that
simulations using operators approximated using the AAA algorithm provide
excellent agreement with reference solutions, with errors in transmission loss
comparable to, and often less than, that of simulations using the rotated
operator method. In addition, we find that the AAA algorithm allows for the
application of the split-step Pad\'e method to fluid-elastic waveguides, which
yields a large gain in computational efficiency.

Edge-functionalized Transition Metal dichalcogenide nanoribbons of the zigzag

Specifically, systems of the type 5-zWXYNR + nA (X, Y = S, Se; n = 0, 1, 2; A =
H, B, C, N, O), involving five rows of a zWXY unit, are investigated as
transmission elements between semi-infinite electrodes, to identify atomic
adsorbates and adsorption conditions for maximizing the spin polarization of
current traversing the ribbons. Janus counterparts of these units, asymmetric
structures comprising a transition metal layer sandwiched by two different
chalcogen layers, are included in this study. In all cases considered, density
functional theory (DFT) modeling, involving the hybrid Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof
(HSE) exchange-correlation functional, is combined with the non-equilibrium
Green's function (NEGF) approach to determine both spin and charge transport
properties. The effect of the selected atomic absorbates on the geometric,
electronic, and magnetic properties of 5-zWXYNR (X, Y = S, Se) is evaluated. A

of the nature and the density of atomic adsorbates, is formulated in terms of
band structure analysis of the respective electrode units. Spin gaps emerging
close to the Fermi energy of the electrode are shown to provide an effective
predictor for the degree of current spin polarization achieved by any of the
transmission systems studied here. For any adsorbate configuration considered,
ferromagnetic (FM) as well as antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering is examined, and
the impact of the magnetic phase on the spin transport properties is discussed.
A spin-selective negative differential resistance effect is identified for
specific nanoribbon systems.

- **TL;DR**: 本文开发了一种基于射频激发的三维μ子自旋极化读取方法，通过单自旋检测实现对耦合F-μ-F系统中自旋纠缠态的观测和控制。

A spin-polarized muon implanted into a fluoride forms a coupled F--$\mu$--F
complex in which the muon spin and neighbouring fluorine nuclear spins become
entangled. Here we apply radio-frequency (RF) excitation to this coupled system
and use the three-dimensional distribution of emitted positrons to reconstruct
the time-dependent evolution of the muon spin polarization. This
three-dimensional readout, using single spin detection, is not possible in a
single NMR experiment and demonstrates significant advantages that are achieved
by using RF muon techniques. We demonstrate the application of this
vector-readout method to the experimental observation of a muon spin echo
signal that is controlled by the dipolar coupling to fluorine, as well as to a
double resonance experiment, in which we use pulses tuned to separate
frequencies to address both the muon and fluorine spins. This targeted
approach, in which selective RF pulses can control the muon spin and other
spins to which it is coupled, provides a novel route for probing systems of
entangled spins.

A first principles study is conducted to explore the changes in the magnetic
structure of Mn\textsubscript{3}GaN under anisotropic biaxial strain.
Mn\textsubscript{3}GaN is an antiperovskite with a structure similar to that of
an ideal cubic perovskite. Several manganese nitride antiperovskites including
Mn\textsubscript{3}GaN were reported to have a frustrated noncollinear
antiferromagnetic structure. Successful electric switching of its magnetic
structure has been reported. Furthermore, despite a cubic lattice symmetry, the
magnetic symmetry is rhombohedral, allowing a piezomagnetic response. Tensile
biaxial strain has been shown to produce a net magnetic moment by inducing
in-plane spin canting. Compressive biaxial strain has been used to induce a
spin-polarized ferro- or ferrimagnetic phase. In this study, anisotropic strain
in the (001) plane is applied, outlining a magnetic phase diagram that can
predict the properties when growing Mn\textsubscript{3}GaN thin films on
noncubic substrates. The lattice vectors along the a and b crystallographic
axes are strained by -5\% to 5\% in percentwise increments in all permutations.
An extensive phase diagram is mapped, revealing multiple combinations of strain
applied to the two lattice vectors that result in a ferro- or ferrimagnetic
transition. Unlike previous results, not only strictly compressive strain on
both lattice vectors, but combinations of tensile and compressive strain, as
well as uniaxial strain, are seen producing the magnetic phase transitions.
Furthermore, while biquadratic strain was seen producing a net moment in the
[110] direction under tensile strain and [\bar{1}\bar{1}0] under compressive
strain, anisotropic strain allows tuning the direction of the net
magnetization.

Recent developments in materials informatics and artificial intelligence has
led to the emergence of foundational energy models for material chemistry, as
represented by the suite of MACE-based foundation models, bringing a
significant breakthrough in universal potentials for inorganic solids. As to
all method developments in computational materials science, performance
benchmarking against existing high-level data with focusing on specific
applications, is critically needed to understand the limitations in the models,
thus facilitating the ongoing improvements in the model development process,
and occasionally, leading to significant conceptual leaps in materials theory.
Here, using our own published DFT (Density Functional Theory) database of
room-temperature dynamic stability and vibrational anharmonicity for $\sim2000$
cubic halide double perovskites, we benchmarked the performances of four
different variants of the MACE foundation models for screening the dynamic
stabilities of inorganic solids. Our analysis shows that, as anticipated, the
model accuracy improves with more training data. The dynamic stabilities of
weakly anharmonic materials (as predicted by DFT) are more accurately
reproduced by the foundation model, than those highly anharmonic and
dynamically unstable ones. The predominant source of error in predicting the
dynamic stability arises predominantly from the amplification of errors in
atomic forces when predicting the harmonic phonon properties through the
computation of the Hessian matrix, less so is the contribution from possible
differences in the range of the configurational spaces that are sampled by DFT
and the foundation model in molecular dynamics. We hope that our present
findings will stimulate future works towards more physics-inspired approaches
in assessing the accuracy of foundation models for atomistic modelling.

GoodRegressor, a general-purpose, C++-based symbolic regression framework for
interpretable materials modeling, is presented. The workflow consists of five
modules, parser, designer, curator, regressor, and designer (as a
post-process), that systematically explore descriptor combinations, nonlinear
transformations, and interaction terms to construct compact and physically
interpretable models. Applied to oxygen-ion conductors, the framework
successfully predicts activation energies and Arrhenius prefactors with high
accuracy ($R^2=0.804$ and $R^2=0.723$, respectively) and reveals clear physical
trends linking ionic transport (particularly activation energy) to coordination
environment, elastic moduli, and lattice flexibility. GoodRegressor bridges
data-driven prediction and physical understanding, providing a transparent and
extensible platform for symbolic regression applicable across diverse materials
systems.

### Semiconductor-Semimetal Transition in van der Waals Carbyne Crystals

Freestanding van der Waals crystals made of single-atom carbon chains
(carbynes) have been recently realized technologically. Here we investigate
their electronic and optical properties experimentally, by continuous-wave and
time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy, and theoretically. Employing a
fully three-dimensional tight-binding formalism benchmarked against density
functional theory calculations we predict the semimetal-semiconductor
transition to occur in van der Waals carbyne crystals composed by the chains of
about 42 atoms long. The semiconductor phase is characterized by a hyperbolic
van Hove singularity which gives rise to unconventional hyperbolic exciton
states. Experimentally, we access the semiconductor phase, where resonant
features associated with hyperbolic excitons are clearly visible. The exciton
oscillator strength is found to be strongly sensitive to the length of carbon
chains: our experiments show that it decreases with the increasing chain
length. This tendency, confirmed by the theoretical modeling, manifests the
evolution of the hyperbolic exciton state on the way to the
semiconductor-semimetal crossover. Our approach accounts for the actual
crystalline geometry, including alternating intra-chain hoppings and
inter-chain couplings. By fitting tight-binding dispersions to density
functional theory data we extract consistent parameters and establish a
comprehensive framework for the physics of carbyne crystals. This study paves
the way towards efficient band-gap engineering in ultimate one-dimensional
carbon crystals.

### Instabilities of a Generalized Gross-Neveu Quantum Criticality

We study the instabilities to the conformal critical point of an exactly
solvable family of Gross-Neveu models. Using conformal field theory techniques,
we construct the zero-temperature phase diagram and identify the
superconducting and ferromagnetic phases that destabilize the critical point.
Both instabilities appear only when the fermions are strongly renormalized,
above a critical anomalous dimension. A higher fermion anomalous dimension also
raises the critical degree of time-reversal-symmetry breaking required to
suppress superconductivity, indicating that pairing becomes more robust with
stronger renormalization.

### Stability Criteria and Optoelectronic Properties of Mg3ZBr3 (Z = As, Sb, Bi) Perovskites for Evaluating the Performance in PIN Photo Diode

The toxicity and stability issues of lead-based perovskites motivate the
search for non-toxic, durable alternatives. This work examines lead-free
$\mathrm{Mg_3ZBr_3}$ ($Z=\mathrm{As,Sb,Bi}$) halide perovskites as
optoelectronic materials, with emphasis on $\mathrm{Mg_3AsBr_3}$ and
$\mathrm{Mg_3SbBr_3}$. First-principles calculations establish cubic
$Pm\bar{3}m$ frameworks stabilized by strong Mg--Br linkages, and indirect band
gaps of $2.0645\,\mathrm{eV}$ for $\mathrm{Mg_3AsBr_3}$ and
$1.6533\,\mathrm{eV}$ for $\mathrm{Mg_3SbBr_3}$ obtained using hybrid
functionals. Optical spectra show a rapid rise in absorption above the gap and
an increasing static dielectric response along
$\mathrm{As}\rightarrow\mathrm{Sb}\rightarrow\mathrm{Bi}$, indicating
strengthened light--matter coupling. Phonon dispersions lack imaginary
branches, confirming dynamical stability, and exhibit large mode anharmonicity
(Gr\"uneisen signatures) consistent with soft-lattice heat transport. Moving
down the pnictogen series expands the lattice and lowers the Goldschmidt
tolerance factor, while enhanced pnictogen--Br $p$-orbital hybridization and
stereochemically active $n\mathrm{s}^{2}$ lone pairs (Sb, Bi) narrow the band
gap and increase the optical dielectric response. Elastic analyses confirm Born
stability and moderate stiffness, with Hill-averaged bulk moduli decreasing
from approximately $44\,\mathrm{GPa}$ ($\mathrm{Mg_3AsBr_3}$) to
$35\,\mathrm{GPa}$ ($\mathrm{Mg_3BiBr_3}$). Drift--diffusion $p$--$i$--$n$
simulations qualitatively track band-edge-limited spectra, aligning with the
computed gaps. Together, these results position these materials as promising
lead-free candidates for stable thin-film photodiode and photovoltaic
applications.

In this work, we present a novel investigation into the spin-dependent
thermoelectric performance of an extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model,
showcasing for the first time how its intrinsic spin filtration mechanism can
be strategically harnessed to function as an efficient spin thermoelectric
generator. By introducing a Fibonacci-type aperiodic modulation in the onsite
energies, we engineer a deterministic disorder that mimics realistic aperiodic
systems and profoundly influences transport characteristics. Furthermore, we
incorporate both nearest-neighbor (NN) and next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) hopping
amplitudes with tunable cosine dependencies, enabling us to meticulously
explore the intricate interplay between these hopping processes and its
implications on thermoelectric behavior. Our analysis reveals a remarkable
enhancement in the dimensionless thermoelectric figure of merit ZT for both
charge and spin transport channels, under carefully optimized conditions.
Notably, the spin thermoelectric response exhibits distinct advantages, opening
a new frontier in the design of next-generation thermoelectric materials and
devices. This qualitative study not only deepens our understanding of aperiodic
topological systems but also establish a foundational framework for exploiting
spin-based thermoelectricity in low-dimensional platforms.

### Interatomic potential development for topological insulator Bi1-xSbx and its dislocation by force-following active learning

We introduce a force following active learning algorithm that integrates
density functional theory DFT with the Gaussian Approximation Potential GAP
framework to develop a robust interatomic potential IP for a dislocation in a
topological insulator Bi1xSbx. Starting from an initial potential IP0 trained
on unit cell data from strained Bi Sb binaries our active learning approach
iteratively refines the IP during a structural relaxation. In each cycle if the
force error uncertainty of any atom near the dislocation core exceeds a
threshold value the IPi is efficiently retrained IPi to IPi1 by incorporating
DFT computed forces and energies of atoms near the high uncertainty atom. This
strategy ensures that the relaxation process maintains a low force error until
full convergence is achieved. Consequently the final IP here IP5 has two
capabilities 1 it reproduces the relaxation pathway observed during the active
learning process unlike the initial IP0 which lacks prior dislocation core
knowledge and 2 it captures the lattice and elastic properties of Bi Sb
binaries across a range of Sb concentrations. We also evaluate dislocation
properties Peierls stresses and dislocation generation by compression to assess
the performance of the trained potential IP5.

In this study, we investigate the structural properties, chemical stability,
and electronic, optical, and thermoelectric properties of
$\mathrm{Sr_2PrSbO_6}$ using first-principles calculations based on Density
Functional Theory (DFT). The goal of this study is to evaluate its potential
contribution to next-generation electrocatalysts, optoelectronic devices, and
thermoelectric systems. The structural optimization reveals that
$\mathrm{Sr_2PrSbO_6}$ crystallizes in a stable cubic perovskite structure with
space group $Fm\bar{3}m$. The calculated formation energy indicates high
thermodynamic stability, confirming the viability of $\mathrm{Sr_2PrSbO_6}$ for
practical applications. The electronic band structure calculations show that
$\mathrm{Sr_2PrSbO_6}$ is a wide bandgap semiconductor with a direct bandgap of
$3.488~\mathrm{eV}$ at the $\Gamma$-point. The calculated density of states
(DOS) indicates significant contributions from O $2p$, Sb $5p$, and Pr $5d$
orbitals. Optical property calculations, including the dielectric function and
absorption coefficient, reveal strong absorption in the UV regions, making
$\mathrm{Sr_2PrSbO_6}$ a promising candidate for optoelectronic applications
such as UV light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and photovoltaic-thermoelectric (PV-TE)
tandem systems. At room temperature, the calculated dimensionless quantity $ZT$
is $0.33$, which indicates this material as a possible candidate for
thermoelectric applications. Our results will serve as a benchmark for future
experimental and theoretical research on the properties of this material.

Nanoscale engineered spin systems, ranging from spins on surfaces to
nanographenes, provide flexible platforms to realize entangled quantum magnets
from a bottom up approach. However, assessing the quantum many-body Hamiltonian
realized in a specific experiment remains an exceptional open challenge, due to
the difficulty of disentangling competing terms accounting for the many-body
excitations. Here, we demonstrate a machine learning strategy to learn a
quantum many-body spin Hamiltonian from scanning spectroscopy measurements of
spin excitations. Our methodology leverages the spatially-resolved
reconstruction of the many-body excitations induced by depositing quantum
impurities next to the quantum magnet. We demonstrate that our algorithm allows
us to predict long-range Heisenberg exchange interactions, anisotropic
exchange, as well as antisymmetric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, including
in the presence of sizable noise. Our methodology establishes defect-induced
spatially-resolved dynamical excitations in quantum magnets as a powerful
strategy to understand the nature of quantum spin many-body models.

Alloying by addition of oxygen interstitials during additive manufacturing
provides new routes to strengthen and toughen metals and alloys. The underlying
mechanisms by which such interstitial atoms lead to enhanced properties remain,
however, unclear, not least due a lack of quantitative atomic-scale models
linking microstructure to properties. Here using quasi-3D imaging based on
multi-slice electron ptychography, we reveal the importance of a new type of
interstitial-character lattice defect, namely zero-dimensional stacking domains
(ZDSDs), present in high density in AM-processed oxygen-modulated pure
titanium. These ZDSDs promote slip diversity, and support intense work
hardening, enabling a three-fold enhancement in both strength and ductility in
Ti-0.45O compared to conventional pure Ti. The work demonstrates the potential
for using interstitial solutes to enhance mechanical properties in a range of
critical engineering alloys.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文开发了一种全带包络函数方法，用于准确模拟窄带隙、破缺带隙和反转带隙材料中的静电势效应，解决了传统方法在这些系统中的失效问题。

Even small electrostatic potentials can dramatically influence the band
structure of narrow-, broken-, and inverted-gap materials. A quantitative
understanding often necessitates a self-consistent Hartree approach. The
valence and conduction band states strongly hybridize and/or cross in these
systems. This makes distinguishing between electrons and holes impossible and
the assumption of a flat charge carrier distribution at the charge neutrality
point hard to justify. Consequently the wide-gap approach often fails in these
systems. An alternative is the full-band envelope-function approach by Andlauer
and Vogl, which has been implemented into the open-source software package
kdotpy (arXiv:2407.12651). We show that this approach and implementation gives
numerically stable and quantitatively accurate results where the conventional
method fails by modeling the experimental subband density evolution with
top-gate voltage in thick (26 nm - 110 nm), topologically inverted HgTe quantum
wells. We expect our openly-available implementation to greatly benefit the
investigation of narrow-, broken-, and inverted-gap materials.

We investigate the coupling of a multi-mode metal-insulator-metal cavity to a
two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in a quantum well in the presence of a
strong magnetic field. The TM cavity mode is strongly hybridized with an
intersubband transition of the 2DEG, forming a polaritonic mode in the
ultrastrong coupling regime, while the TE mode remains an almost purely cavity
mode. The magnetoplasmon excitation emerging from the presence of the magnetic
field couples with both TM and TE modes, exhibiting different coupling
strengths and levels of spatial field inhomogeneity. While the strong
homogeneity of the bare TE mode gives rise to the standard anticrossing of
strong coupling, the inhomogeneous polaritonic TM mode is shown to activate an
observable Coulombic effect in the spectral response, often referred to as
non-locality. This experiment demonstrates a cavity-induced modification of the
2DEG response and offers a new route to probing the effect of Coulomb
interactions in ultrastrongly coupled systems via reshaping of their cavity
mode profiles.

- **TL;DR**: 本文通过实验展示了在典型电荷密度波材料1T-TiSe2中，时间周期性光场与空间周期性调制之间的协同耦合，揭示了CDW在Floquet工程中的关键作用。

Floquet engineering has emerged as a powerful approach for dynamically
tailoring the electronic structures of quantum materials through time-periodic
light fields generated by ultrafast laser pulses. The light fields can
transiently dress Bloch electrons, creating novel electronic states
inaccessible in equilibrium. While such temporal modulation provides dynamic
control, spatially periodic modulations, such as those arising from charge
density wave (CDW) order, can also dramatically reconstruct the band structure
through real-space symmetry breaking. The interplay between these two distinct
forms of modulation-temporal and spatial-opens a new frontier in
electronic-phase-dependent Floquet engineering. Here we demonstrate this
concept experimentally in the prototypical CDW material 1T-TiSe$_2$. Using
time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (TrARPES) with mid-infrared
pumping, we observe a striking pump-induced instantaneous downshift of the
valence band maximum (VBM), which is in sharp contrast to the subsequent upward
shift on picosecond timescale associated with CDW melting. Most remarkably, the
light-induced VBM downshift is observed exclusively in the CDW phase and only
when the pump pulse is present, reaching maximum when pumping near resonance
with the CDW gap. These observations unequivocally reveal the critical role of
CDW in the Floquet engineering of TiSe$_2$. Our work demonstrates how
time-periodic drives can synergistically couple to spatially periodic
modulations to create non-equilibrium electronic states, establishing a new
paradigm for Floquet engineering enabled by spontaneous symmetry breaking.

for armchair and $\sim1.89^\circ$ for zigzag-edged flakes, tunable via in-plane
heterostrain. This locking mechanism, which relies on energy barriers that are
an order of magnitude larger than those of nearby metastable twist angles,
provides a geometric route to precision twist-angle control of two-dimensional
heterostructures and to understand the self-orientation of macroscopic flakes.

- **TL;DR**: 开发了一个理论框架，通过吸收光谱测量来测定纳米片浓度和横向尺寸，解决了传统方法依赖耗时元素分析的局限性。

Semiconductor nanoplatelets possess exceptional optical properties that make
them promising candidates for next-generation optoelectronic applications.
However, unlike quantum dots where absorption spectroscopy alone can determine
both size and concentration, nanoplatelets present a significant
characterization challenge: the absorption peak position reveals only
thickness, providing no information about lateral dimensions or concentration.
This limitation forces researchers to rely on time-consuming and costly
elemental analysis techniques for complete sample characterization. Here, we
present an experimentally verified theoretical framework that predicts the
frequency-dependent absorption coefficient of randomly oriented CdSe, CdS, and
CdTe nanoplatelets, enabling concentration determination from absorption
measurements and lateral size estimates. Our model shows that the integrated
absorption coefficient depends universally on nanoplatelet surface area and
thickness, yielding a practical tool to extract concentrations without
laborious elemental analysis. This approach bridges the characterization gap
between quantum dots and nanoplatelets, offering a streamlined method for rapid
sample analysis that could accelerate nanoplatelet research and applications.

- **TL;DR**: 通过精确工程的两步合成工艺稳定了Cu不足的CuxInSe2薄膜，实现了带隙从1.51 eV到1.4 eV的可调窄化，适用于无毒光伏应用。

The Cu-deficient CuxInSe2 (x larger than 0.3) phase can be stabilized as a
thin film. A uniform Cu-deficient composition with a chalcopyrite structure was
obtained by the precision engineering of a two-step synthesis process involving
electron-beam evaporation and Se vapor deposition. Detailed structural and
chemical analyses were performed employing various X-ray and microscopic
techniques to demonstrate that the chemical states and local structure in the
Cu-Se-In tetrahedral networks change with the loss of Cu, the In-Se bond
becomes shorter, and the In ions become excessively oxidized without phase
separation. Moreover, the results indicate that the bandgap narrowing is
primarily attributed to the reconstruction of In3+d 5s orbital states. The
bandgap narrows from 1.51 eV to 1.4 eV, which is optimal for the photon
absorber. Therefore, cation-deficient selenide is promising for stable nontoxic
photovoltaics with tunable bandgaps.

Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have had a profound impact on numerous
emerging optoelectronic technologies, achieving performance metrics that rival
or exceed incumbent materials. This impact is underpinned by the exceptional
properties of MHPs, including tuneable band gaps, high absorption coefficients,
long carrier diffusion lengths and combined with uncomplicated synthesis
methods. However, current MHP production relies on the toxic solvents, which
pose significant environmental and health risks. Moreover, these methods often
require complex multi component solvent systems and thermal processing to
achieve the desired material phases, further hindering scalability and
sustainability. Overcoming these challenges is critical to the future
development of MHP-based technologies. Overcoming these challenges is critical
to the future development of MHP-based technologies. Here, we present a novel
water-based solvent system and synthetic approach for the preparation of
size-controlled CsPbBr3 perovskite nanocrystals in ambient air and at room
temperature. The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of CsPbBr3 erovskite
nanocrystals (PNCs) exceeds 60 precent. To demonstrate the light to current
conversion ability of our PNCs a series of photoconductors were prepared, with
the best performing devices achieving a specific detectivity (D*) of 1.2 x
10^11 Jones. Thus, this green, scalable, and low-cost approach offers a
sustainable pathway for precise size and compositional control of MHP
nanocrystals, opening new possibilities for environmentally friendly
optoelectronic applications.

### Fermi arcs for generic nodal points hosting monopoles or dipoles

- **TL;DR**: 本文系统分析了拓扑半金属中费米弧的解析结构，涵盖不同类型的拓扑节点（二重或多重简并）和各向异性/非线性色散情况，并探讨了零单极子但具有理想偶极子的拓扑节点是否会产生费米弧。

Fermi arcs represent the surface states at the boundary of a
three-dimensional topological semimetal with the vacuum, illustrating the
notion of bulk-boundary correspondence playing out in real materials. Their
special character is tied up with the topological charges carried by the nodes
of the semimetal in the momentum space, where two or more bands cross. In fact,
they are constrained to begin and end on the perimeters of the projections of
the Fermi surfaces of the bands tangentially, signalling their mixing with the
bulk states. The number of Fermi arcs grazing onto the tangents of the
outermost projection about a given node also reflects the magnitude of the
charge at the node (equalling the Berry-curvature monopole), revealing the
intrinsic topology of the underlying bandstructure, which can be visualised in
experiments like ARPES. Here we take upon the task of unambiguously
characterising the analytical structure of these states for generic nodal
points, (1) whose degeneracy might be twofold or multifold; and (2) the
associated bands might exhibit isotropic or anisotropic, linear- or
nonlinear-in-momentum dispersion. Moreover, we also address the question of
whether we should get any Fermi arcs at all for topological nodes carrying zero
values of monopoles, but representing ideal dipoles.

Nodal-sphere semimetals (NSSMs), featuring spherical band degeneracies in
momentum space, constitute a fascinating class of topological materials.
However, their realization in real materials is severely hampered by discrete
crystallographic symmetry constraints, often resulting in gapped ``pseudo''
nodal spheres. Here, combining first-principles calculations and symmetry
analysis, we predict a new three-dimensional boron allotrope, CT-B$_{24}$, as a
nearly ideal NSSM. Its structural stability is systematically confirmed by
phonon calculations, \textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics simulations at
600~K, and elastic constant analysis. Notably, the electronic structure of
CT-B$_{24}$ exhibits two bands crossing linearly near the Fermi level, forming
a quasi-nodal sphere around the $\Gamma$ point. The maximum energy gap is
merely 0.008~meV, which is two orders of magnitude smaller than the gaps
reported in previous pseudo-NSSMs. Furthermore, the (001) surface hosts
pronounced drumhead-like surface states located outside the projected nodal
sphere, providing distinct signatures detectable by angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). The nodal sphere also demonstrates
remarkable robustness and tunability under external strain, driving a
topological phase transition from an NSSM to a Dirac semimetal and finally to a
trivial insulator. Our work not only presents a superior material platform for
exploring nodal-sphere physics but also suggests potential for strain-tunable
topological devices.

Sesqui-chalcogenides serve as a critical bridge between traditional
semiconductors and quantum materials, offering significant potential in
applications such as thermoelectrics, phase change memory, and topological
insulators. While considerable attention has been focused on antimony- and
bismuth-based compounds, characterized by substantial property changes upon
reduction in film thickness, indium containing sesqui-chalcogenides like
In$_2$Te$_3$ are emerging as promising candidates for photovoltaics and
electronic devices. However, the effects of film thickness on the properties of
In$_2$Te$_3$ remain largely unexplored. In this study, we investigate
high-quality In$_2$Te$_3$ thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy on Si(111)
substrates across a thickness range from 2.7 nm to 24 nm. We employ X-ray
diffraction, reflective high-energy electron diffraction and atomic force
microscopy to analyze both the crystal structure and film morphology.
Additionally, we utilize broadband optical spectroscopy alongside femtosecond
pump-probe measurements and Raman spectroscopy to assess optical and
vibrational properties, respectively. Our analysis reveals that material
properties exhibit minimal dependence on film thickness, contrasting sharply
with behavior observed in other chalcogenides such as Sb$_2$Te$_3$,
Bi$_2$Se$_3$, or GeTe. This phenomenon can be attributed to covalent bonding
present in In$_2$Te$_3$, which differs from those in its antimony- and
bismuth-containing counterparts.

Defects in two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors play a decisive role in
determining their electronic, optical, catalytic and quantum properties.
Understanding how defect energy levels respond to variations in layer thickness
is essential for achieving reproducible and scalable device performance. We
report the persistence of layer-tolerant defect levels in rhenium disulfide
(ReS2), where both donor- and acceptor-type charge transition levels remain
nearly unchanged from monolayer to bulk in both AA and AB stacking. The
associated two-level quantum system also retains its character across
thicknesses, enabling ReS2 to serve as a platform for layer-tolerant
single-photon emitters. The invariance arises from the interplay between
electronic energy minimization and structural relaxation, which together
counteract quantum confinement and reduced dielectric screening. Additionally,
the intrinsically weak interlayer coupling in ReS2 plays a crucial role. Our
findings uncover the microscopic origin of this unique behavior, distinguishing
ReS2 from other transitionmetal dichalcogenides and highlighting its potential
for thickness-independent optoelectronic and quantum photonic applications.

### Uncovering critical temperature dependence in Heusler magnets via explicit machine learning

- **TL;DR**: 使用可解释的显式机器学习分析Heusler化合物中磁转变温度Tc的材料依赖性，发现Tc主要由Fe、Co、Mn比例控制，HDE方法精度与其他机器学习相当，且可解释为广义序参数。

We employ interpretable explicit machine learning to analyze the material
dependence of the magnetic transition temperature $T_c$ in ferromagnetic and
ferrimagnetic Heusler compounds. For around 200 compounds, we consider both
experimental $T_c$ and calculated $T_c$ using \textit{ab initio} determination
of magnetic interactions together with a Monte-Carlo solution. We use the
hierarchical dependence extraction (HDE) procedure [Mor\'ee and Arita, Phys.
Rev. B 110, 014502 (2024)] to extract the dependencies of $T_c$ on chemical
proportions and magnetic moments from the main order to the higher order, and
construct an explicit expression of $T_c$ from these dependencies. The main
results are: (a) $T_c$ is mainly controlled by the proportions of Fe, Co, and
Mn, and increases with these proportions, consistent with previous machine
learning analyses of ferromagnetic materials. (b) The HDE describes $T_c$ with
an accuracy that is comparable to that of other machine learning procedures.
(c) The HDE expression of $T_c$ can be interpreted as a generalized order
parameter that increases with increasing magnetization amplitude, in
qualitative agreement with various theories of phase transitions. These results
strengthen our understanding of the material dependence of $T_c$ in collinear
Heusler magnets and motivate the further use of HDE in material design.

major step towards standardized scanning probe microscopy.

### Multiferroic-like Excitation in Ferroelectrics

Multiferroics are materials with coexisting electric and magnetic orders that
are of central importance for fundamental research and applications in sensor
and information technologies. However, intrinsic multiferroics that operate at
room temperature remain rare due to an apparent incompatibility between
magnetism and ferroelectricity. Here we predict that a pure ferroelectric hosts
multiferroic-like quasiparticles that simultaneously carry \emph{static}
magnetic and electric dipoles. The electric dipole moment emerges from the
parity-odd anharmonicity of the ferroelectric dynamics, while the magnetic
moment has both paramagnetic and diamagnetic origins generated by circularly
polarized transverse fluctuations of the ferroelectric polarization. In
contrast to the established ``dynamical multiferroicity" of conventional
phonons, which involve only \emph{oscillating} electric dipoles, these
``multiferron" modes produce a colossal electric-field-tunable second-harmonic
optical response as well as a magnetoelectric cross coupling. Multiferrons open
a new route toward nonlinear THz optical applications and offer multiferroic
functionalities in simple ferroelectrics.

The brownmillerite-type oxide Ba$_2$In$_2$O$_5$ (BIO) is a potential
candidate as an electrolyte material for mixed ionic-electronic conduction in
solid oxide fuel cells. Despite its structural relation to perovskite oxides,
the defect chemistry of BIO has remained largely unexplored. Using Density
Functional Theory within the generalized gradient approximation, complemented
by selected hybrid-functional calculations, we evaluate the formation energies,
charge transition levels, and concentrations as a function of oxygen partial
pressure of vacancies, oxygen interstitials, Frenkel pairs, and substitutional
Cr doping. Our results reveal that oxygen vacancies and interstitials dominate
the intrinsic defect landscape. Among the interstitials, we identify stable
dumbbell configurations that remain neutral across the entire band gap. Other
interstitial configurations show charged states and become the prevailing
compensating defect at high oxygen partial pressures. For extrinsic doping, we
find that Cr preferentially substitutes at the tetrahedral In site and behaves
as a donor. Its negative formation energies suggest the formation of secondary
phases, possibly the tetragonal Cr-doped BIO. These results provide a first
picture of the thermodynamics of intrinsic and extrinsic defects in BIO and set
the stage for future investigations into the tetragonal phase and the diffusion
dynamics of oxygen vacancies and interstitials.

Donor doping as a form of point defect engineering is a popular strategy for
tuning the physical properties of functional oxides. The renewed interest in
dislocation-tuned functional properties in ceramics requires a deeper
understanding of point defect-dislocation interactions. Here, we study the
room-temperature dislocation plasticity of donor-doped (0.05 wt% and 0.5 wt% Nb
as dopants) single-crystal SrTiO3 across the length scale, using a
combinatorial mechanical deformation approach including nanoindentation
(nano-/microscale), Brinell indentation (mesoscale), and uniaxial bulk
compression (macroscale). Compared to the nominally undoped sample, Nb-doped
SrTiO3 exhibits higher nanoindentation pop-in load and lower indentation creep
rates, suggesting less favored dislocation nucleation and motion. Under cyclic
Brinell indentation, the discrete slip traces on the 0.5 wt% Nb-doped sample
indicate suppressed dislocation multiplication. Extending to bulk compression,
0.5 wt% Nb-doped samples exhibit ~50% higher yield strength compared to that of
the nominally undoped sample. We further validated the findings by comparing
with an acceptor (Fe)-doped single crystal with equivalent doping
concentrations. This length-scale bridging approach consistently reveals
suppressed dislocation nucleation, multiplication, and motion in the 0.5 wt%
Nb-doped samples. These insights underline the importance of dislocation-defect
chemistry on the mechanical behavior of functional oxides.

Argyrodite solid electrolytes, such as Li$_6$PS$_5$Cl, exhibit some of the
highest known superionic conductivities. Yet, the mechanistic understanding of
Li$^+$ transport in realistic argyrodite microstructures -- where atomic-scale
mechanisms interplay with continuum-scale dynamics at grain boundaries --
remains limited. Here, we resolve Li$^+$ transport in silico by developing
accurate machine-learning potentials via closed-loop active learning and
embedding the potentials in a multiscale modeling framework that integrates
molecular dynamics with finite element simulations. We show that bulk diffusion
barriers scale linearly with anion radius. Grain boundaries have opposite
effects depending on the bulk -- enhancing Li$^+$ diffusion in low-diffusivity
phases but suppressing it in fast-diffusing ones. Simulations of
polycrystalline Li$_6$PS$_5$I reveal non-Arrhenius transport behaviors
consistent with experiments. Grain-size-dependent predictions indicate that
grain refinement improves intergranular contacts in argyrodites without
compromising superionic conductivity, while nanosizing can activate ionic
transport in electrolytes lacking intrinsic superionic behavior. Our findings
highlight the decisive role of microstructure in developing solid electrolytes.

Charge carriers in organic semiconductors form polarons, which are
self-localized states stabilized by interactions with their environment. Using
a dielectric-stabilized tight-binding model parameterized from first-principles
calculations, we compute ground and excited polaron states in
poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT). Our results quantitatively reproduce key
mid-infrared absorption features, notably the chain-length-dependent shift of
the intrachain polaron excitation peak (peak B) and its variation between
regioregular and regiorandom P3HT. Comparison to an alternative stabilization
mechanism based on local ring distortions reveals that dielectric polarization
dominates polaron formation, as ring distortions yield insufficient binding and
excitation energies inconsistent with experiments. These findings clarify the
microscopic origin of polarons in conjugated polymers and provide a predictive
framework linking polaron energetics to spectroscopic observables, advancing
the understanding of charge transport in organic semiconductors.

Computational models are used here for simulating diffusion-controlled
redistribution of hydrogen that is picked up by zirconium-base nuclear fuel
cladding during light water reactor operation. Axial localization of hydrogen,
leading to localized precipitation of zirconium hydrides at lower-temperature
regions near interpellet gaps, is studied with a bespoke model, while radial
diffusion, leading to formation of a densely hydrided rim subjacent to the
waterside oxide layer, is studied with a more general model. The calculated
results are compared with experimental observations and similar computational
studies reported in the literature. The results underline the importance of
hydrogen redistribution with regard to local embrittlement of the cladding
tubes.

- **TL;DR**: Fe掺杂YMnO3通过DFT计算研究，发现能有效减小带隙（从1.88eV降至1.19eV），增强介电响应和热电性能，适用于光伏和光电器件应用。

The hexagonal multiferroic oxide YMnO$_3$ has demonstrated applications in
various fields and is widely researched due to its interesting properties.
Since Mn(3d)--O(2p) interactions predominate close to the Fermi level, doping
in the B-site (Mn) with Fe provides a way to modulate the band gap and magnetic
order of YMnO$_3$. The need for a lead-free ferroelectric material with a
narrow band gap is crucial for absorbing a wide range of the solar spectrum.
Density functional theory calculations were carried out using GGA and meta-GGA
(for an accurate description of the band gap) exchange correlation functional
for the Fe-doped YMnO$_3$ multiferroics. Various magnetic configurations were
analyzed, finding collinear G-type AFM as the least energy state. The hexagonal
lattice is retained after Fe doping with slight distortions and a change in
lattice constants. Fe doping reduces spin frustration and induces
magnetization, while reducing the band gap from 1.88 eV for pure to 1.19 eV for
a 25 percent doping concentration. Additionally, Fe doping exhibits an enhanced
dielectric response, characterized by an increase in the static dielectric
constant and the presence of strong absorption peaks in the visible and UV
energy ranges. Thermoelectric studies illustrate enhanced conductivity due to
increased charge carriers induced by doping. In summary, first-principles
predictions of structural, electronic, optical, and transport behavior in
Fe-doped YMnO$_3$ provide a foundation for tailoring this oxide in
photovoltaic, thermoelectric, and optoelectronic applications.

Dislocations in ceramics have gained renewed research interest contrasting
the traditional belief that ceramics are brittle. Understanding dislocation

engineering. Here, we use MgO single crystals with mechanically seeded
dislocation densities from ~10^12 to ~10^15 m-2 to investigate the mechanical
behavior such as yield and fracture. Nano-/micro-pillar compression tests
reveal a dislocation density-dependent yield strength, mediated by the varying
dominating dislocation mechanisms from nucleation to multiplication/motion. The
dislocation-seeded samples can achieve a much-improved compressive plastic
strain beyond ~70%, with a high yield strength of ~2.35 GPa (diameter of ~400
nm). Complementary bulk compression tests, along with digital image correlation
(DIC), demonstrate a consistent dislocation-mediated deformation and a notable
size effect, with bulk samples exhibiting much reduced yield strength (~120
MPa) compared to the nano-/micro-pillars. Using three-dimensional Discrete
Dislocation Dynamics (3D-DDD) simulation, we further underline the dislocation
avalanche and work hardening during compression. This study provides new
insights into dislocation-mediated plasticity in MgO across the length scale
with tunable dislocation densities.

Traditional machine learning has advanced polymer discovery, yet direct
generation of chemically valid and synthesizable polymers without exhaustive
enumeration remains a challenge. Here we present polyT5, an encoder-decoder
chemical language model based on the T5 architecture, trained to understand and
generate polymer structures. polyT5 enables both property prediction and the
targeted generation of polymers conditioned on desired property values. We
demonstrate its utility for dielectric polymer design, seeking candidates with
dielectric constant &gt;3, bandgap &gt;4 eV, and glass transition temperature &gt;400 K,
alongside melt-processability and solubility requirements. From over 20,000
generated promising candidates, one was experimentally synthesized and
validated, showing strong agreement with predictions. To further enhance
usability, we integrated polyT5 within an agentic AI framework that couples it
with a general-purpose LLM, allowing natural language interaction for property
prediction and generative design. Together, these advances establish a
versatile and accessible framework for accelerated polymer discovery.
