### Helical phases and Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces probed by superconducting diode effects
- **arXiv**: [2510.18963](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18963)  ·  [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.18963.pdf)
- **Title (EN)**: Helical phases and Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces probed by superconducting diode effects
- **Authors**: Zekun Zhuang, Daniel Shaffer, Jaglul Hasan, Alex Levchenko
- **Categories**: cond-mat.supr-con
- **TL;DR**: 该论文系统研究了非中心对称超导体中的超导二极管效应和约瑟夫森二极管效应，发现在体系统中二极管效率在Lifshitz转变临界点接近最大值，而在约瑟夫森结中短结和长结的机制不同，且Bogolyubov费米面的出现会导致强各向异性。

Noncentrosymmetric superconductors (NCSs) with Rashba spin-orbit coupling
(SOC) and in-plane magnetic fields have emerged as natural platforms for
realizing both the bulk superconducting diode effect (SDE) and the Josephson
diode effect (JDE) - phenomena characterized by unequal critical currents in
opposite directions due to the simultaneous breaking of time-reversal and
inversion symmetries. Using the quasiclassical Eilenberger formalism, we
systematically investigate both the bulk SDE and the JDE in a clean NCS with
Rashba SOC and in-plane magnetic fields. For the bulk system, we find that the
diode efficiency can nominally approach its maximal value at the critical
endpoint of the first-order Lifshitz transition between weak and strong helical
phases featuring finite-momentum Cooper pairs, the latter marked by the
emergence of Bogolyubov Fermi surfaces (BFSs). In a Josephson junction, we show
that finite-momentum pairing in the superconducting leads is the dominant
mechanism behind the JDE in short junctions, whereas in long junctions it is
primarily governed by the Zeeman field in the normal region. In the
long-junction regime, the diode efficiency additionally oscillates between
positive and negative values as a function of magnetic field at low fields,
providing a route toward a highly tunable Josephson diode. At higher fields,
the onset of BFSs in the strong helical phase leads to a sharp suppression of
both the JDE and the Josephson current when the current direction is aligned
with momenta along the BFS, resulting in strong anisotropy. We propose that
this anisotropy in the Josephson current offers an alternative method for
detecting BFSs, applicable to systems with or without a JDE.

The aim of the present paper is to present a careful and accessible
discussion of the formal aspects of Boltzmann-Gibbs and Tsallis entropies. We
begin with a brief overview of Boltzmann-Gibbs entropy, highlighting its main
properties and the uniqueness theorems formulated by Shannon and Khinchin. Once
these foundational results are established, we introduce the framework of
nonadditive statistical mechanics, defining Tsallis entropy, discussing its
properties and uniqueness theorem, and contrasting it with the results from
additive statistical mechanics. We also show that, in an appropriate limit, the
Boltzmann-Gibbs results are recovered. The article concludes with a brief
discussion of R\'enyi entropy and its connections to the previously defined
entropic forms.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究通过量子蒙特卡洛模拟发现，双层t-J⊥-V模型中的层间环路电流涨落可以介导s波超导配对，为理解某些双层镍酸盐的超导机制提供了新视角。

Loop currents, as an orbital magnetism, have been proposed as a possible
fluctuation mechanism for superconducting pairing, which always remains
elusive. Here, we investigate the role of an interlayer loop current
fluctuation in mediating superconductivity using an unbiased bilayer
$t-J_{\perp}-V$ model via sign-problem-free projector quantum Monte Carlo
simulations. The model spontaneously generates the interlayer loop current by
breaking time-reversal and translational symmetries, favored by interlayer
Coulomb repusion. With hole doping, the loop current is rapidly suppressed,
while its fluctuations give rise to an interlayer $s$-wave superconductivity.
Our results establish a phase diagram to demonstrate a superconducting
transition due to the interlayer loop current fluctuations. It also provides
possible insights into some physics related to bilayer nickelates, with which
it shares a similar structure and a large interlayer spin exchange.

### Haerter-Shastry kinetic magnetism and metallicity in the triangular Hubbard model

- **TL;DR**: 该研究探讨了三角晶格Hubbard模型中由动力学诱导的120度反铁磁态在空穴掺杂下的稳定性，发现了一个具有多聚体条纹的中间相，并发现有限空穴密度下存在无隙电荷激发。

The fermionic Hubbard model, when combined with the ingredient of
frustration, associated with the breaking of particle-hole symmetry, harbors a
rich phase diagram. Aspects of theoretical findings associated with the nature
of magnetism and metallicity, in a diverse set of parameter regimes, are now
being actively investigated in triangular Hubbard cold atom and solid-state
(moir\'e) based emulators. Building on the theoretical work of Haerter and
Shastry [Phys. Rev. Lett. 95,087202 (2005)], we explore the impact of
kinetically frustrated magnetism, a phenomenon where antiferromagnetic order
emerges without any underlying magnetic interactions, at finite hole density.
We numerically study the infinite-$U$ triangular Hubbard model using the
density matrix renormalization group algorithm and estimate the extent of
stability of the kinetically induced $120^{\circ}$ antiferromagnetic state to
hole doping. Beyond the Haerter-Shastry regime, we find an intermediate phase
with multimer (involving multiple correlated spins) stripes that eventually
gives way to a paramagnet. We also find evidence of gapless charge excitations
(metallicity) throughout the phase diagram for finite hole density. We discuss
the implications at large, but finite and realistic values of $U/t$, and
investigate whether kinetic magnetism and superexchange collaborate or compete.

- **TL;DR**: 开发了一种在高压下对薄片材料进行点接触安德烈夫反射光谱测量的方法，结合金刚石压砧技术，用于研究薄片超导体的光谱特性。

Superconductors that can be mechanically exfoliated are an interesting
platform for exploring superconducting properties tuned by layer thickness.
These layered superconductors are also expected to exhibit sensitivity to
applied pressure. While pressure has been demonstrated to be an effective way
of tuning bulk superconductors, analogous studies on superconducting thin
flakes have been limited due to technical challenges. In particular,
spectroscopic measurements under pressure remain insufficiently explored. In
this work, we functionalized the diamond anvil cell technique for point-contact
Andreev reflection spectroscopy (PCAR) measurement on thin-flake materials
under pressure, offering the opportunity to obtain spectroscopic information on
superconductivity. To validate the feasibility of this method, we have
conducted PCAR measurements on iron-selenide thin flakes to extract
temperature-dependent superconducting gap values under ambient and high
pressure. Combine with the proven magnetotransport capability, our method
provides a conceptually simple tool for a detailed examination of thin-flake
superconductors under pressure.

### Soft Mode Origin of Charge Ordering in Superconducting Kagome CsV$_3$Sb$_5$

- **TL;DR**: 该研究通过高分辨率非弹性X射线散射和第一性原理计算，揭示了CsV₃Sb₅中电荷密度波(CDW)的微观起源——L点的软声子模式是CDW形成的主要机制。

Charge-density-wave (CDW) order and superconductivity coexist in the kagome
metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=K, Cs, Rb), raising fundamental questions about the
mechanisms driving their intertwined phases. Here we combine high-resolution
inelastic X-ray scattering with first-principles calculations to uncover the
origin of CDW formation in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. Guided by structure factor analysis,
we identify a soft phonon mode along the reciprocal M-L direction, with the
strongest effect at the L point, where the elastic scattering intensity also
grows most rapidly upon cooling. First-principles calculations incorporating
lattice anharmonicity and electron-phonon coupling reproduce these observations
and establish a soft-mode instability at the L point as the driving mechanism
of CDW formation. Despite the weakly first-order character of the transition,
our results unambiguously demonstrate that the CDW in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ originates
from a softened phonon, clarifying its microscopic origin and highlighting the
central role of lattice dynamics in kagome metals.

### Ferro-spinetic Altermagnets from Electronic Correlations

- **TL;DR**: 本文展示了交变磁体(altermagnets)中可切换的铁自旋极化现象，这是自旋版本的铁电性，由晶格对称性决定方向。

Altermagnets are fully compensated collinear antiferromagnets that lack the
combined time-reversal and translation symmetry. Here we show that their
symmetry allows for a switchable ferro-spinetic polarization - the spin
analogue of ferroelectricity - in a direction dictated by the lattice symmetry.
We demonstrate this effect first in its purest form in an interacting
altermagnetic fermion model, in which a many-body chiral symmetry forbids any
charge polarization. Our quantum Monte Carlo simulations reveal edge-localized,
reversible spin accumulations fully consistent with this symmetry locking.
Breaking the chiral symmetry releases the charge sector: a ferroelectric
polarization emerges orthogonal to the ferro-spinetic one, yielding mutually
perpendicular switchable spin- and charge-polarized responses. We identify
Mn-based metal-organic frameworks as realistic hosts for this effect, offering
a practical route for experimental verification.

### Decoding optoelectronic behavior in X$_3$BI$_3$ antiperovskite derivatives through many-body perturbation theory

- **Categories**: cond-mat.mtrl-sci
- **TL;DR**: 该研究通过第一性原理计算分析了X₃BI₃（X = Ca, Sr; B = P, As, Sb, Bi）反钙钛矿衍生物的结构、电子、光学、激子和极化子性质，发现这些材料具有直接带隙、适中的激子结合能和弱到中等的载流子-声子耦合，适合光电器件应用。

Antiperovskite derivatives have emerged as promising candidates for
optoelectronic applications. However, due to the significant computational
cost, their excitonic and polaronic properties remain underexplored despite
being critical for optoelectronic performance. Here, we present the structural,
electronic, optical, excitonic, and polaronic properties of a series of
antiperovskite derivatives with the chemical formula X$_{3}$BI$_{3}$ (X = Ca,
Sr; B = P, As, Sb, Bi) using state-of-the-art first-principles calculations.
All the compounds exhibit direct bandgaps with G$_{0}$W$_{0}$@PBE bandgap
ranging from 2.42 to 3.02 eV, optimal for efficient light absorption with
minimal energy loss. Exciton binding energies (0.258-0.318 eV) indicate
moderate Coulomb attraction, favoring exciton dissociation. Employing the
Feynman polaron model, we established the polaronic properties, where weak to
intermediate carrier-phonon coupling was observed, with polaron mobilities
reaching values up to 37.19 cm$^{2}$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$. These properties
establish X$_{3}$BI$_{3}$ materials as viable candidates for next-generation
optoelectronic devices.

### Multi-scale topology optimization of porous heat sinks with voided lattice structure using a two-layer Darcy-Forchheimer model

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种结合空隙晶格结构的水冷散热片拓扑优化框架，使用双层Darcy-Forchheimer模型，显著提升散热性能同时降低压力损失。

This study presents a topology optimization framework for the design of water
cooled heat sinks that incorporate voided lattice structures, formulated using
a two-layer Darcy-Forchheimer model. Conventional porous heat sinks often
suffer from excessive pressure drops due to their intricate geometries, which
limit their practical applicability. To overcome this issue, the proposed
method introduces an explicit representation of both void and porous regions,
together with graded lattice density, within a multi-material optimization
framework. The two-layer Darcy-Forchheimer model enables efficient
reduced-order simulations, allowing direct consideration of the heterogeneous
porous-void distribution during the optimization process. The optimized designs
are reconstructed into full-scale lattice geometries and validated through
coupled thermo-fluid finite element analyses under fixed pressure-drop
conditions. The results demonstrate that the voided lattice configurations
significantly outperform conventional plate-fin and uniform lattice heat sinks,
achieving approximately 20-30 percent higher maximum Nusselt numbers while
maintaining lower pressure losses.

Accurate prediction of atomistic, thermodynamic, and kinetic properties from
molecular structures underpins materials innovation. Existing computational and
experimental approaches lack the scalability required to efficiently navigate
chemical space. Scientific foundation models trained on large unlabeled
datasets offer a path toward exploring chemical space across diverse
application domains. Here we develop MIST, a family of molecular foundation
models with up to an order of magnitude more parameters and data than prior
works. Trained using a novel tokenization scheme that comprehensively captures
nuclear, electronic, and geometric information, MIST learns from a diverse
range of molecules. MIST models have been fine-tuned to predict more than 400
structure -- property relationships and match or exceed state-of-the-art
performance across benchmarks spanning physiology, electrochemistry, and
quantum chemistry. We demonstrate the ability of these models to solve
real-world problems across chemical space, including multiobjective electrolyte
solvent screening, olfactory perception mapping, isotope half-life prediction,
stereochemical reasoning for chiral organometallic compounds, and binary and
multi-component mixture property prediction. Probing MIST models using
mechanistic interpretability methods reveals identifiable patterns and trends
not explicitly present in the training data, suggesting that the models learn
generalizable scientific concepts. We formulate hyperparameter-penalized
Bayesian neural scaling laws and use them to reduce the computational cost of
model development by an order of magnitude. The methods and findings presented
here represent a significant step toward accelerating materials discovery,
design, and optimization using foundation models and provide valuable guidance
for training compute-optimal scientific foundation models.

### Magnon scattering and transduction in Coulomb-coupled quantum Hall ferromagnets

- **TL;DR**: 该论文研究了量子霍尔铁磁体中由库仑相互作用引起的独特现象：磁振子可以远距离散射点电荷，斯格明子可以在双层量子霍尔铁磁体中作为磁振子的发射器和接收器，实现跨层磁振子传输。

The magnetization field of a quantum Hall ferromagnet (QHFM) can host a
variety of spin textures, including skyrmions and magnons. When projected into
the lowest Landau level with $\nu = 1$ filling, the topological (Pontryagin)
charge density of the magnetization field is proportional to the electric
charge density, allowing for long-range spin-spin interactions. Inspired by
recent experimental developments that enable all-electrical magnon generation
and detection, in this work we theoretically demonstrate two phenomena that can
occur due to Coulomb interactions that are unique to QHFMs: magnons can scatter
off of point charges at a distance, and skyrmions can act as transmitters and
receivers for magnons to be transduced between separate layers of a bilayer
QHFM. The latter Coulomb-mediated spin drag effect occurs at arbitrary distance
and could facilitate long-range magnonics, such as detection of spin waves for
future experiments in 2D materials.

### Inter-orbital spin-triplet superconductivity from altermagnetic fluctuations

- **TL;DR**: 本文展示了反演对称性破缺的交变磁涨落如何促进自旋三重态配对，通过动量-轨道锁定机制和内部约瑟夫森耦合，形成了一种新型的轨道间自旋三重态超导态。

Altermagnetic (AM) fluctuations are a new class of collinear spin
fluctuations whose role in mediating superconductivity faces a fundamental
tension: their $\Gamma$-point peak favors intra-orbital spin-triplet pairing,
while their spin compensation favors inter-orbital singlets. Here, we
demonstrate that inversion-symmetry-broken AM fluctuations generically resolve
this competition in favor of spin-triplet pairing. As a proof of concept, we
study a minimal two-orbital model with two van Hove singularities. The broken
inversion symmetry induces momentum-orbital locking: the same orbital dominates
at opposite momenta, enhancing the triplet channel. Crucially, a subdominant
fluctuation channel arising from inter-van-Hove nesting provides an internal
Josephson coupling that locks the phase difference between triplet pairs on
different orbitals. We find this coupling changes sign ($+$ to $-$) upon a
crossover from AM-dominant to ferromagnetic-dominant fluctuations. The
resulting $\pi$-phase difference manifests as a $\tau_z$-type order parameter,
$c_{k,1\uparrow}c_{-k,1\uparrow} - c_{k,2\uparrow}c_{-k,2\uparrow}$. Although
intra-orbital in the original basis, its orbital-nontrivial character, as
manifested by its equivalence to inter-orbital pairing under rotation, defines
a general \textit{inter-orbital spin-triplet superconductivity}. This state is
distinct from the $\tau_0$-triplet pairing mediated by ferromagnetic
fluctuations, as evidenced by the canceled intra-orbital supercurrent in a
Josephson junction between them.

### First-principles calculation of electronic and topological properties of low-dimensional tellurium

- **TL;DR**: 该研究使用第一性原理密度泛函理论分析了碲在不同维度形态的结构、热力学、电子和拓扑性质，发现3D体相和1D纳米线具有Weyl节点等拓扑特征，而2D单层由于对称性保持而拓扑平庸，但可通过外部扰动诱导拓扑相变。

We employ first-principles density-functional theory to investigate the
structural, thermodynamic, electronic, and topological properties of tellurium
in its various dimensional forms: bulk trigonal tellurium (Te-I),
two-dimensional (2D) monolayers $\alpha$-Te, $\beta$-Te and one-dimensional
helical nanowire (Te-h). A softening of the acoustic phonon modes is seen in
most of the 2D phases, suggesting a tendency to structural distortions or phase
transitions under small perturbations. The trigonal 3D Te-I structure is
characterized as a narrow-gap semiconductor hosting Weyl nodes at high-symmetry
locations in the Brillouin zone, which is supported by the characteristic spin
texture seen in momentum space, where spins align radially, forming Berry
monopoles. This topological feature, along with the observation of Weyl phonons
is attributed to inversion symmetry breaking and strong SOC. Ultrathin Te-h
nanowires also exhibit signatures of Weyl nodes and presents a considerable
energy gap under SOC. On the other hand, the two-dimensional monolayers
$\alpha$-Te, $\beta$-Te, are classified as topologically trivial, as indicated
by their topological invariants, which arises from the preservation of both
spatial inversion and time-reversal symmetries in these systems. The potential
for inducing topological phase transitions via external perturbations suggest
that these monolayers are promising candidates for engineered Weyl phases or
other topological states. We demonstrate that tellurium and its low-dimensional
derivatives are versatile materials that exhibit a broad range of electronic
and phononic phenomena intrinsically linked to chirality and symmetry breaking.
The tunability of their electronic and topological properties places tellurium
as a promising material platform for the exploration and application of Weyl
physics in next-generation electronic and optoelectronic technologies.

- **TL;DR**: 提出基于机器学习的决策模型，在运行时动态选择不同分辨率的模拟方法，通过MLP预测粒子与连续介质模拟的差异，只在需要的地方使用高保真粒子模拟。

All simulation approaches eventually face limits in computational scalability
when applied to large spatiotemporal domains. This challenge becomes especially
apparent in molecular-level particle simulations, where high spatial and
temporal resolution leads to rapidly increasing computational demands. To
overcome these limitations, hybrid methods that combine simulations with
different levels of resolution offer a promising solution. In this context, we
present a machine learning-based decision model that dynamically selects
between simulation methods at runtime. The model is built around a Multilayer
perceptron (MLP) that predicts the expected discrepancy between particle and
continuum simulation results, enabling the localized use of high-fidelity
particle simulations only where they are expected to add value. This concurrent
approach is applied to the simulation of membrane fabrication processes, where
a particle simulation is coupled with a continuum model. This article describes
the architecture of the decision model and its integration into the simulation
workflow, enabling efficient, scalable, and adaptive multiscale simulations.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is influencing heterogeneous catalysis research
by accelerating simulations and materials discovery. A key frontier is
integrating AI with multiscale models and multimodal experiments to address the
"many-to-one" challenge of linking intrinsic kinetics to observables. Advances
in machine-learned force fields, microkinetics, and reactor modeling enable
rapid exploration of chemical spaces, while operando and transient data provide
unprecedented insight. Yet, inconsistent data quality and model complexity
limit mechanistic discovery. Generative and agentic AI can automate model
generation, quantify uncertainty, and couple theory with experiment, realizing
"self-driving models" that produce interpretable, reproducible, and
transferable understanding of catalytic systems.

### Loop Charges and Fragmentation in Pairwise Difference Conserving Circuits

In this work, we introduce a broad class of circuits, or quantum cellular
automata, which we call 'pairwise-difference-conserving circuits' (PDC). These
models are characterized by local gates that preserve the pairwise difference
of local operators (e.g. particle number). Such circuits can be de- fined on
arbitrary graphs in arbitrary dimensions for both quantum and classical degrees
of freedom. A key consequence of the PDC construction is the emergence of an
extensive set of loop charges associated with closed walks of even length on
the graph. These charges exhibit a one-dimensional character reminiscent of
1-form symmetries and lead to strong Hilbert-space fragmentation. As a case
study, we analyze a quasi one-dimensional ladder geometry, where we
characterize all dynam- ically disconnected sectors by the loop-charge
symmetries, providing a complete decomposition of the Hilbert space. For the
ladder geometry, we observe clear signatures of nonergodic dynamics even within
the largest symmetry sector.

variety of nanoscale electromechanical functionalities. Quantitative imaging of
nanoscale electromechanical phenomena requires high sensitivity while avoiding
artifacts induced by large drive biases. Conventional PFM often relies on high
voltages to overcome optical detection noise, leading to various non-ideal
effects including electrostatic crosstalk, Joule heating, and tip-induced
switching. To mitigate this situation, we introduce interferometrically
detected, resonance-enhanced dual AC resonance tracking (iDART), which combines
femtometer-scale displacement sensitivity of quadrature phase differential
interferometry with contact resonance amplification. Through this combination,
iDART achieves 10x or greater signal-to-noise improvement over current state of
the art PFM approaches including both single frequency interferometric PFM or
conventional, resonance enhanced PFM using optical beam detection. In this
work, we demonstrate a &gt;10x improvement of imaging sensitivity on PZT and
Y-HfO. Switching spectroscopy shows similar improvements, where further
demonstrates reliable hysteresis loops at small biases, mitigating
nonlinearities and device failures that can occur at higher excitation
amplitudes. These results position iDART as a powerful approach for probing
conventional ferroelectrics with extremely high signal to noise down to weak
piezoelectric systems, extending functional imaging capabilities to thin films,
2D ferroelectrics, beyond-CMOS technologies and bio-materials.

NbOI$_2$ has recently emerged as a new van der Waals material combining
semiconducting behavior with intrinsic in plane ferroelectricity and pronounced
transport and optical anisotropy. However, its photocarrier dynamics remain
largely unexplored. Here we report transient absorption spectroscopy of
NbOI$_2$ using femtosecond pump probe reflectance measurements. A pronounced
transient absorption feature is observed near the 2.34 eV excitonic resonance,
arising from photocarrier induced excitonic energy shifts and saturation. The
decay dynamics reveal an exciton lifetime of several tens of picoseconds and
show density-dependent behavior consistent with exciton exciton annihilation,
yielding an annihilation coefficient of 0.09 cm$^2$ s$^{-1}$, which is
comparable to that in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides. Polarization
resolved measurements further reveal a pronounced in-plane anisotropy in the
transient response that follows the linear absorption anisotropy. These
findings provide fundamental insight into photocarrier dynamics in NbOI$_2$ and
establish key parameters for understanding and exploiting its optoelectronic
behavior.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文提出了一种高效的机器学习原子间势能工作流，用于预测尼罗红染料在不同溶剂中的UV-Vis光谱，通过主动学习技术和多种建模方法比较，实现了与时间相关DFT相当的精度。

Machine Learned Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) offer a powerful combination
of abilities for accelerating theoretical spectroscopy calculations utilising
both ensemble sampling and trajectory post-processing for inclusion of vibronic
effects, which can be very challenging for traditional ab initio MD approaches.
We demonstrate a workflow that enables efficient generation of MLIPs for the
solvatochromic dye nile red system, in a variety of solvents. We use iterative
active learning techniques to make this process as efficient as possible in
terms of number and size of Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations.
Additionally, we compare the efficacy of various methodologies: generating
distinct MLIPs for each adiabatic state, using one ground state MLIP in
combination with delta-ML of excitation energies, and using a three-headed
multiheaded ML model. To evaluate the validity of the resulting models, we
compare predicted absorption and emission spectra to experimental spectra. We
found that the incorporation of larger solvent systems into training data, and
the use of delta models to predict the excitation energies, enables the
accurate and affordable prediction of UV-Vis spectra with accuracy equivalent
to the ground truth method, which is time-dependent DFT in this case.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种在张量网络重整化群方法中引入晶格反射对称性的方法，通过转置技巧在二维和三维系统中保持和施加反射对称性，为研究晶格旋转对称性铺平道路。

Tensor-network renormalization group (TNRG) is an efficient real-space
renormalization group method for studying the criticality in both classical and
quantum lattice systems. Exploiting symmetries of a system in a TNRG algorithm
can simplify the implementation of the algorithm and can help produce correct
tensor RG flows. Although a general framework for considering a global on-site
symmetry has been established, it is still unclear how to incorporate a lattice
symmetry like rotation or reflection in TNRG. As a first step for lattice
symmetries, we propose a method to incorporate the lattice-reflection symmetry
in the context of a TNRG with entanglement filtering in both two and three
dimensions (2D and 3D). To achieve this, we write down a general definition of
lattice-reflection symmetry in tensor-network language. Then, we introduce a
transposition trick for exploiting and imposing the lattice-reflection symmetry
in two basic TNRG operators: projective truncations and entanglement filtering.
Using the transposition trick, the detailed algorithms of the TNRG map in both
2D and 3D are laid out, where the lattice-reflection symmetry is preserved and
imposed. Finally, we demonstrate how to construct the linearization of the TNRG
maps in a given lattice-reflection sector, with the help of which it becomes
possible to extract scaling dimensions in each sector separately. Our work
paves the way for understanding the lattice-rotation symmetry in TNRG.

Many recent advances in our understanding of two-dimensional (2D) electron
systems stem from van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures. The assembly process
relies on the weak bonding across interfaces between layered vdW compounds,
making it possible to construct exceptionally clean heterostructures from
chemically and structurally distinct materials - a challenging task for
traditional thin-film growth techniques. Here we demonstrate an additional,
dynamic degree of freedom afforded by vdW interfaces, wherein we use
microstructured polymer stamps to disassemble and reconfigure vdW
heterostructures by sliding. We apply this technique to alter the dielectric
environment of monolayer graphene, perform scanning tunneling microscopy on
semiconducting and air-sensitive monolayers, and manipulate strain-sensitive
moir\'e materials. Together these demonstrations suggest a new paradigm for
assembling and dynamically modifying van der Waals heterostructures, with the
potential to reveal new insights into 2D electron systems.

### High-Efficiency Nonrelativistic Charge-Spin Conversion in X-Type Antiferromagnets

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种新型X型反铁磁材料，相比交变磁体能在特定晶向产生更高效的T-odd自旋电流，电荷-自旋转换效率高达90%，为低功耗自旋电子器件提供了高效自旋源。

Altermagnets have attracted considerable interest for their capacity to
generate spin splitting while preserving zero net magnetization. This work
proposes a distinct class of antiferromagnetic materials, termed X-type
antiferromagnets, which are shown to produce more efficient $\cal T$-odd spin
currents than altermagnets along specific crystallographic directions due to
their unique Fermi surface geometry. The spin current polarization is
controlled by the N\'eel vector orientation. In the (110)-oriented
$\beta-\mathrm{Fe}_2\mathrm{PO}_5$, the Fermi surface exhibits a $d$-wave
altermagnetic-like characteristic and becomes compressed into an approximately
X-shaped $d$-wave configuration, yielding highly efficient $\cal T$-odd spin
currents with a charge-to-spin conversion efficiency reaching 90%. Moreover,
when the N\'eel vector is tilted via unit cell selection or external means, the
system generates out-of-plane spin-polarized currents with efficiencies
substantially exceeding those of known ferromagnets, altermagnets, noncollinear
antiferromagnets, and low-symmetry materials. The highly efficient charge-spin
conversion in X-type antiferromagnets provides a novel and highly effective
spin source system for the development of low-power spintronic devices.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一个统一的开放量子系统多体微扰理论，将耗散、关联和外部驱动统一处理，通过Keldysh-Lindblad形式引入耗散相互作用的图解处理，保持Kadanoff-Baym方程结构不变。

We present a unified many-body perturbation theory for open quantum systems,
that treats dissipation, correlations, and external driving on equal footing.
Using a Keldysh-Lindblad formalism, we introduce diagrammatic treatment of
dissipative interaction lines representing quasiparticle flows and
fluctuations. Two new Feynman rules render the evaluation of dissipative
diagrams compact and systematically improvable, while preserving the Keldysh
and anti-Hermitian symmetries of the closed-system theory. Consequently, the
structure of the Kadanoff-Baym equations (KBE) remains unchanged, enabling
existing numerical methods to be directly applied. To illustrate this, we
derive dissipative versions of the second Born and GW approximations,
identifying the physical content of the self-energy components. Moreover, we
demonstrate that time-linear approximations to the full KBE retain their closed
structure and can be efficiently used to simulate relaxation and decoherence
dynamics. This framework establishes a general route toward first-principles
modeling of correlated, driven, and dissipative quantum materials.

### Ab Initio Free Energy Surfaces for Coupled Ion-Electron Transfer

- **TL;DR**: 该论文开发了一种考虑空间各向异性环境中电子转移的理论方法，通过引入独立于马库斯反应坐标的各向异性集体变量，构建了耦合离子-电子转移自由能面。

The Marcus theory of electron transfer assumes that diabatic energy gaps are
sampled from a single ensemble. This assumption can break down in spatially
anisotropic environments, such as electrochemical interfaces or biomolecular
structures, where distinct solvent ensembles arise along a collective variable
describing the anisotropy. Treating this collective variable as an additional
reaction coordinate linearly independent from the Marcus reaction coordinate,
we develop a formalism that enables calculation of the resulting Coupled
Ion-Electron Transfer (CIET) free-energy surface directly from constrained ab
initio trajectories. Applied to CO2 redox on a gold electrode, this method
reveals strong coupling to the anisotropy, predicting significantly different
activation barriers compared to either coordinate alone.

### Monte Carlo study of the $O(2)$-invariant $φ^4$ theory with a cubic perturbation in three dimensions

We study the $2$-component $\phi^4$ model on the simple cubic lattice in the
presence of a cubic, or equivalently, a $\mathbb{D}_4$ invariant perturbation.
To this end, we perform Monte Carlo simulations in conjunction with a finite
size scaling analysis of the data. We follow previous work on the $3$-component
case. We study the RG flow from the decoupled Ising fixed point into the
$O(2)$-invariant one and towards the fluctuation induced first order
transition. To this end we study the behavior of phenomenological couplings. At
the $O(2)$-invariant fixed point we obtain the estimate $Y_4=-0.1118(10)$ of
the RG-exponent of the perturbation. Note that the small modulus of $Y_4$ means
that the RG flow is slow. Hence, in order to interpret experiments or Monte
Carlo simulations of lattice models, which are effectively described by the
$\phi^4$ model with a cubic term, we have to consider the RG flow beyond the
neighborhood of the fixed points.

To achieve efficient anti-damping switching of nanoscale magnetic memories
with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy using spin-orbit torque requires that
the anti-damping spin-orbit torque have a strong out-of-plane component. The
spin anomalous Hall effect and the planar Hall effect spin current produced by
a ferromagnetic layer are candidate mechanisms for producing such an
out-of-plane anti-damping torque, but both require that the magnetic moment of
the spin source layer be canted partly out of the sample plane at zero applied
magnetic field. Here we demonstrate such a canted configuration for a
ferromagnetic SrRuO3 layer and we characterize all vector components of the
torque that it produces, including non-zero out-of-plane anti-damping torques.
We verify that the out-of-plane spin component can be tuned by the orientation
of magnetic moment, with significant contributions from both the spin anomalous
Hall effect and the planar Hall effect spin current.

### Synthesizability Prediction of Crystalline Structures with a Hierarchical Transformer and Uncertainty Quantification

Predicting which hypothetical inorganic crystals can be experimentally
realized remains a central challenge in accelerating materials discovery.
SyntheFormer is a positive-unlabeled framework that learns synthesizability
directly from crystal structure, combining a Fourier-transformed crystal
periodicity (FTCP) representation with hierarchical feature extraction,
Random-Forest feature selection, and a compact deep MLP classifier. The model
is trained on historical data from 2011 through 2018 and evaluated
prospectively on future years from 2019 to 2025, where the positive class
constitutes only 1.02 per cent of samples. Under this temporally separated
evaluation, SyntheFormer achieves a test area under the ROC curve of 0.735 and,
with dual-threshold calibration, attains high-recall screening with 97.6 per
cent recall at 94.2 per cent coverage, which minimizes missed opportunities
while preserving discriminative power. Crucially, the model recovers
experimentally confirmed metastable compounds that lie far from the convex hull
and simultaneously assigns low scores to many thermodynamically stable yet
unsynthesized candidates, demonstrating that stability alone is insufficient to
predict experimental attainability. By aligning structure-aware representation
with uncertainty-aware decision rules, SyntheFormer provides a practical route
to prioritize synthesis targets and focus laboratory effort on the most
promising new inorganic materials.

### Calculating the Luttinger liquid parameter for an interacting Kitaev chain quantum simulator

In this work, we introduce a solid-state platform for building quantum
simulators using implanted spin centers in solid-state materials. We build upon
the proposal for an $S=1$ chain of spin centers coupled through the magnetic
dipole-dipole interaction and subjected to an external magnetic field as a
quantum simulator for critical floating phases. We introduce another magnetic
field and map the system to the interacting Kitaev chain. This setup, tunable
through the applied fields and the orientation of the spin centers within the
crystal, exhibits a variety of rich quantum behavior which notably includes
floating phases, a $Z_2$ symmetry-breaking phase, and lines of both
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) and Pokrovsky-Talapov transitions.
Furthermore, we employ several novel methods to calculate the Luttinger liquid
parameter in our model with incommensurate correlations. We find that these
methods provide a route to identify BKT transitions with less computational
resources than utilizing entanglement entropy and central charge.

Multiferroic materials, particularly rare-earth orthochromates (RECrO$_3$),
have garnered significant interest due to their unique magnetic and
electric-polar properties, making them promising candidates for multifunctional
devices. Although extensive research has been conducted on their
antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition temperature (N$\acute{\textrm{e}}$el
temperature, $T_\textrm{N}$), ferroelectricity, and piezoelectricity, the
effects of doping and substitution of rare-earth (RE) elements on these
properties remain insufficiently explored. In this study, convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) were employed to predict and analyze the physical properties of
RECrO$_3$ compounds under various doping scenarios. Experimental and literature
data were integrated to train machine learning models, enabling accurate
predictions of $T_\textrm{N}$, besides remanent polarization ($P_\textrm{r}$)
and piezoelectric coefficients ($d_{33}$). The results indicate that doping
with specific RE elements significantly impacts $T_\textrm{N}$, with optimal
doping levels identified for enhanced performance. Furthermore, high-entropy
RECrO$_3$ compounds were systematically analyzed, demonstrating how the
inclusion of multiple RE elements influences magnetic properties. This work
establishes a robust framework for predicting and optimizing the properties of
RECrO$_3$ materials, offering valuable insights into their potential
applications in energy storage and sensor technologies.

### Learning Optimal Decoherence Time Formulas for Surface Hopping Simulation of High-Dimensional Scattering

In our recent work (J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2023, 14, 7680), we utilized the
exact quantum dynamics results as references and proposed a general machine
learning method to obtain the optimal decoherence time formula for surface
hopping simulation. Here, we extend this strategy from one-dimensional systems
to the much more intricate scenarios with multiple nuclear dimensions.
Different from the one-dimensional situation, an effective nuclear kinetic
energy is defined by extracting the component of nuclear momenta along the
non-adiabatic coupling vector. Combined with the energy difference between
adiabatic states, high-order descriptor space can be generated by binary
operations. Then the optimal decoherence time formula can be obtained by
machine learning procedures based on the full quantum dynamics reference data.
Although we only use the final channel populations in 24 scattering samples as
training data for machine learning, the obtained optimal decoherence time
formula can well reproduce the time evolution of the reduced and spatial
distribution of population. As benchmarked in a large number of 56840 one- and
two-dimensional samples, the optimal decoherence time formula shows
exceptionally high and uniform performance when compared with all other
available formulas.

Periodical driven systems provide unique opportunities to investigate the
dynamics of topological structures far from equilibrium. In this paper, we
report a time-crystalline soliton (TCS) state in a driven-dissipative $\phi^4$
model. This state exhibits spontaneous breaking of discrete time-translational
symmetry alongside spatial soliton behavior. During time evolution, the soliton
pattern periodically oscillates between kink and anti-kink configurations. We
further study TCS dynamics under noise, demonstrating that soliton random walk
can induce a dynamical transition between two distinct $Z_2$ symmetry-breaking
time-crystalline phases in time domain. Finally, we examine the annihilation of
two spatially separated TCSs under noise. Importantly, in contrast to the
confined behavior of time-crystalline monopoles reported in [Phys. Rev. Lett.
131, 056502 (2023)], the dynamics of time-crystalline solitons is deconfined
despite the nonequilibrium nature of our model: the statistically averaged
annihilation time scales as a power law with the solitons' initial separation.

When monolayer graphene is crystallographically aligned to hexagonal boron
nitride (BN), a moir\'e superlattice is formed, producing characteristic
satellite Dirac peaks in the electronic band structure. Aligning a second BN
layer to graphene creates two coexisting moir\'e patterns, which can interfere
to produce periodic, quasi-periodic or non-periodic superlattices, depending on
their relative alignment. Here, we investigate one of the simplest realizations
of such a double-moir\'e structure, graphene encapsulated between two BN
layers, using dynamically rotatable van der Waals heterostructures. Our setup
allows \textit{in situ} control of the top BN alignment while keeping the
bottom BN fixed. By systematically mapping the charge transport as a function
of BN angular alignment, we identify the simultaneous signatures of the
original moir\'es, super-moir\'es, and a third set of features corresponding to
quasi-Brillouin zones (qBZ) formed when the system's periodicity becomes
ill-defined. Comparing our measurements with theoretical models, we provide the
first experimental mapping of the qBZs as a function of angular alignment. Our
results establish a direct experimental link between moir\'e interference and
qBZ formation, opening new avenues for engineering electronic structures in
multi-aligned 2D heterostructures.

- **TL;DR**: 在结构分选的单壁碳纳米管膜中观察到激子热辐射，即使在高温下也能保持激子共振，这为选择性热发射和能量收集提供了新的可能性。

Owing to their small binding energies, excitons in bulk semiconductors
typically exhibit a sharp optical peak at low temperatures only. This
limitation can be overcome by single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and other
low-dimensional semiconductors with highly enhanced exciton binding energies.
Exciton thermal radiation, which can potentially be exploited for selective
thermal emission and energy harvesting, has been recently observed in
individual SWCNTs heated under photoirradiation. However, whether
macroscale-SWCNT assemblies can emit exciton thermal radiation under conduction
heating remains unclear and constitutes an important challenge for practical
applications. Herein, we observed peaked exciton thermal radiation from
structure-sorted SWCNT membranes. Transmission spectroscopy showed robust
exciton resonance at high temperatures, resulting in clear exciton resonance in
the thermal radiation band. The absolute emissivity spectra of the membranes
were determined at 850 K. Exciton dominance suppresses the contribution of
thermal free carriers to the infrared absorption/emission spectra, maintaining
the transparency below the optical gap even at elevated temperatures. These
phenomena are not observed in bulk semiconductors, highlighting the
structure-sorted SWCNT membranes as unique semiconductors leveraging stable
exciton resonances at elevated temperatures.

revealed. The electrical resistivity strongly decreases when a magnetic field
$\mathbf{H}$ is applied along the easy magnetic axis $\mathbf{a}$, while it
remains almost unchanged when $\mathbf{H}$ is applied along the hard magnetic
axes $\mathbf{b}$ and $\mathbf{c}$. The field-induced destabilization of the
ferromagnetic state is also anisotropic: the anomaly at the Curie temperature
$T_C$ disappears in fields higher than $\gtrsim1$~T for
$\mathbf{H}\parallel\mathbf{a}$ and in fields higher than $\gtrsim20$~T for
$\mathbf{H}\parallel\mathbf{b},\mathbf{c}$. At temperatures below 2~K, we
observe quantum oscillations in fields larger than 50~T applied along
$\mathbf{b}$, which support the presence of a two-dimensional Fermi surface
similar to that previously observed at low fields.

Elucidating the catalytic descriptor that accurately characterizes the
structure-activity relationships of typical catalysts for various important
heterogeneous catalytic reactions is pivotal for designing high-efficient
catalytic systems. Here, an interpretable machine learning technique was
employed to identify the key determinants governing the nitrate reduction
reaction ($\rm NO_3RR$) performance across 286 single-atom catalysts (SACs)
with the active sites anchored on double-vacancy $\rm BC_3$ monolayers. Through
Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) analysis with reliable predictive
accuracy, we quantitatively demonstrated that, favorable $\rm NO_3RR$ activity
stems from a delicate balance among three critical factors: low $\rm N_V$,
moderate $\rm D_N$, and specific doping patterns. Building upon these insights,
we established a descriptor ($\psi$) that integrates the intrinsic catalytic
properties and the intermediate O-N-H angle ($\theta$), effectively capturing
the underlying structure-activity relationship. Guided by this, we further
identified 16 promising catalysts with predicted low limiting potential
($U_{\rm L}$). Importantly, these catalysts are composed of cost-effective
non-precious metal elements and are predicted to surpass most reported
catalysts, with the best-performing Ti-V-1N1 is predicted to have an ultra-low
$U_{\rm L}$ of $-0.10$ V.

We consider a one-dimensional gas of hard rods, one of the simplest examples
of an interacting integrable model. It is well known that the hydrodynamics of
such integrable models can be understood by viewing the system as a gas of
quasiparticles. Here, we explore the dynamics of individual quasiparticles for
a variety of initial conditions of the background gas. The mean, variance, and
two-time correlations are computed exactly and lead to a picture of
quasiparticles as drifting Brownian particles. For the case of a homogeneous
background, we show that the motion of two tagged quasiparticles is strongly
correlated, and they move like a rigid rod at late times. Apart from a
microscopic derivation based on the mapping to point particles, we provide an
alternate derivation which emphasizes that quasiparticle fluctuations are
related to initial phase-space fluctuations, which are carried over in time by
Euler scale dynamics. For the homogeneous state, we use the Brownian motion
picture to develop a Dean-Kawasaki-type fluctuating hydrodynamic theory,
formally having the same structure as that derived recently by Ferrari and
Olla. We discuss differences with existing proposals on the hydrodynamics of
hard rods and some puzzles.

### Relation between structure and functionality in photosynthetic antenna complex of green sulfur bacteria: efficiency under natural sunlight pumping

- **TL;DR**: 该论文对绿硫细菌光合作用天线复合体进行了大规模模拟，研究了超过十万个叶绿素分子的能量转移过程，发现自然结构下的光捕获效率约为80%，而改变偶极取向会降低效率。

Large-scale simulations of light-matter interaction in natural photosynthetic
antenna complexes of the Chlorobium Tepidum green sulfur bacteria (GSB)
containing more than one hundred thousand chlorophyll molecules, comparable
with natural size, have been performed. Here we have modeled the entire process
of the exciton energy transfer, from sunlight absorption to exciton trapping in
the reaction centers (RCs) in presence of a thermal bath. The energy transfer
has been analyzed using the radiative non-Hermitian Hamiltonian and solving the
rate equations for the populations. Sunlight pumping has been modeled as
black-body radiation with an attenuation factor that takes the Sun-Earth
distance into account. Cylindrical structures typical of GSB antenna complexes,
and the dimeric baseplate comparable to natural size have been considered. Our
analysis shows that under natural sunlight, in photosynthetic antennae of GSB
the number of excitations reaching the RC per unit time matches the RC closure
rate and the internal efficiency shows values close to $\sim 80\%$. We also
considered cylindrical structures where the orientation of the dipoles does not
reflect the natural one. Specifically, we vary continuously the angle of the
transition dipole with respect to the cylinder main axis, focusing on the case
where all dipoles are parallel to the cylinder axis. We also consider the
important case where the dipoles are randomly oriented. In all cases the
light-harvesting efficiency is lower than in the natural structure, showing the
high sensitivity of light harvesting to the specific orientation of the dipole
moments. Our results allow for a better understanding of the relationship
between structure and functionality in photosynthetic antennae of GSB and could
drive the design of efficient light-harvesting devices.

### Pairing Symmetry Crossover from $d$-wave to $s_{\pm}$-wave in a Bilayer Nickelate Driven by Hund's Coupling and Crystal Field Splitting

The pairing symmetry of the recently discovered bilayer nickelate
superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is a subject of intense debate in condensed
matter physics, with the two leading theoretical candidates being a
sign-reversing $s_{\pm}$-wave and a $d$-wave state. To investigate its
ground-state properties in the intermediate coupling regime which is critical
for real materials, we construct a two-orbital bilayer Hubbard model and employ
the constrained-path quantum Monte Carlo method for large-scale simulations. By
systematically calculating ground-state pairing correlation functions across
parameter spaces, we map its pairing symmetry phase diagram. We find that an
increasing Hund's coupling selectively enhances the interlayer $s_{\pm}$-wave
pairing while suppressing the intralayer $d$-wave pairing. Similarly, a larger
crystal field splitting drives a transition from $d$-wave- to
$s_{\pm}$-wave-dominant states. Further analysis reveals that the strength of
the intralayer $d$-wave pairing is strongly correlated with the $(\pi, \pi)$
antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations, which are in turn effectively suppressed
by a large crystal field splitting, thereby weakening the $d$-wave pairing
channel. Additionally, the dominant pairing symmetry transition region roughly
overlaps with the inversion of orbital occupancy response to Hubbard $U$,
suggesting an intrinsic link between pairing competition and orbital physics.
Our results indicate that, within the parameter regime relevant to the actual
material, the $s_{\pm}$-wave is the most probable pairing symmetry.

### Practical algorithm for simulating thermal pure quantum states

The development of novel quantum many-body computational algorithms relies on
robust benchmarking. However, generating such benchmarks is often hindered by
the massive computational resources required for exact diagonalization or
quantum Monte Carlo simulations, particularly at finite temperatures. In this
work, we propose a new algorithm for obtaining thermal pure quantum states,
which allows efficient computation of both mechanical and thermodynamic
properties at finite temperatures. We implement this algorithm in our
open-source C++ template library, Physica. Combining the improved algorithm
with state-of-the-art software engineering, our implementation achieves high
performance and numerical stability. As an example, we demonstrate that for the
$4 \times 4$ Hubbard model, our method runs approximately $10^3$ times faster
than $\mathcal{H}\Phi$ 3.5.2. Moreover, the accessible temperature range is
extended down to $\beta = 32$ across arbitrary doping levels. These advances
significantly push forward the frontiers of benchmarking for quantum many-body
systems.

### Mechanism of the electrochemical hydrogenation of graphene

- **TL;DR**: 石墨烯电化学氢化实现可逆的导体-绝缘体转变，其机制是质子吸附与H2分子形成的竞争反应，比传统氢化方法快10^6倍，可通过晶格纳米级褶皱和氘取代来优化性能。

The electrochemical hydrogenation of graphene induces a robust and reversible
conductor-insulator transition, of strong interest in logic-and-memory
applications. However, its mechanism remains unknown. Here we show that it
proceeds as a reduction reaction in which proton adsorption competes with the
formation of H2 molecules via an Eley-Rideal process. Graphene's
electrochemical hydrogenation is up to $10^6$ times faster than alternative
hydrogenation methods and is fully reversible via the oxidative desorption of
protons. We demonstrate that the proton reduction rate in defect-free graphene
can be enhanced by an order of magnitude by the introduction of nanoscale
corrugations in its lattice, and that the substitution of protons for deuterons
results both in lower potentials for the hydrogenation process and in a more
stable compound. Our results pave the way to investigating the chemisorption of
ions in 2D materials at high electric fields, opening a new avenue to control
these materials' electronic properties.

### Krylov space dynamics of ergodic and dynamically frozen Floquet systems

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种基于Krylov空间的Floquet热化视角，提供了研究稳态收敛速率的高效数值算法，并应用于周期驱动的混合场Ising模型，成功解析了遍历和动态冻结相之间的转变。

In isolated quantum many-body systems periodically driven in time, the
asymptotic dynamics at late times can exhibit distinct behavior such as
thermalization or dynamical freezing. Understanding the properties of and the
convergence towards infinite-time (nonequilibrium) steady states however
remains a challenging endeavor. We propose a physically motivated Krylov space
perspective on Floquet thermalization which offers a natural framework to study
rates of convergence towards steady states and, simultaneously, an efficient
numerical algorithm to evaluate infinite-time averages of observables within
the diagonal ensemble. The effectiveness of our algorithm is demonstrated by
applying it to the periodically driven mixed-field Ising model, reaching system
sizes of up to 30 spins. Our method successfully resolves the transition
between the ergodic and dynamically frozen phases and provides insight into the
nature of the Floquet eigenstates across the phase diagram. Furthermore, we
show that the long-time behavior is encoded within the localization properties
of the Ritz vectors under the Floquet evolution, providing an accurate
diagnostic of ergodicity.

### Thermal Hall conductivity of semi-metallic graphite dominated by ambipolar phonon drag

It is now known that in addition to electrons, other quasi-particles such as
phonons and magnons can also generate a thermal Hall signal. Graphite is a
semimetal with extremely mobile charge carriers of both signs and a large
lattice thermal conductivity. We present a study of the thermal Hall effect in
highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) samples with electronic, phononic and
phonon drag contributions to the thermal Hall signal. The measured thermal Hall
conductivity ($\kappa_{xy}$) is two orders of magnitude higher than what is
expected by electronic carriers according to the electrical Hall conductivity
and the Wiedemann-Franz law, yielding a record Hall Lorenz number of
$164.9\times10^{-8}V^2 K^{-2}$ ($\sim$67$L_0$) - the largest ever observed in a
metal. The temperature dependence of the thermal Hall conductivity
significantly differs from its longitudinal counterpart, ruling out a purely
phononic origin of the non-electronic component. Based on the temperature
dependence and the amplitudes of the Seebeck and Nernst responses, we
demonstrate that ambipolar phonon drag dominates the thermal Hall response of
graphite.

- **TL;DR**: 在(BA)2PbI4/WSe2异质结构中，通过调节激发激光能量控制层间激子发射的圆偏振，WSe2单层作为可调自旋滤波器实现可调自旋极化。

The initialization and control of a long-lived spin population in lead halide
perovskites are prerequisites for their use in spintronic applications. Here,
we demonstrate circular polarization of the interlayer exciton emission in a
(BA)2PbI4/WSe2 monolayer heterostructure. The helicity of this emission is
controlled by tuning the energy of the excitation laser through the manifold of
exciton resonances of the WSe2 monolayer, together with an emerging interlayer
absorption feature of the heterostructure. Theoretical calculations show that
this resonance arises from hybridized (BA)2PbI4/WSe2 states in the valence
band. This hybrid character enables its observation in both linear absorption
and ultrafast pump-probe spectroscopies, and plays a key role in controlling
the sign of the helicity of the interlayer exciton emission. The tunable spin
polarization demonstrated here, with the WSe2 monolayer effectively acting as a
tunable spin filter, represents an important step toward the use of 2D
perovskites in opto-spintronic applications.

We extend the previous study of extracting crystalline symmetry-protected
topological invariants to the correlated regime. We construct the interacting
Hofstadter model defined on square lattice with the rotation and translation
symmetry defects: disclination and dislocation. The model realizes Chern
insulator and the charge density wave state as one tunes interactions.
Employing the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method, we calculate
the excess charge around the defects and find that the topological invariants
remain quantized in both phases, with the topological quantity extracted to
great precision. This study paves the way for utilizing matrix product state,
and potentially other quantum many-body computation methods, to efficiently
study crystalline symmetry defects on 2D interacting lattice systems.

Strong coupling with circularly polarized vacuum fluctuations offers a viable
route to manipulate molecular chirality. While experiments are advancing toward
the realization of chiral cavities, a mean-field theoretical framework for
describing electron-photon interaction in this platform has been missing. Here,
we present a mean-field theory that can be systematically improved to capture
the chiral correlation effects responsible for the enantioselective power of
chiral light. We use strong coupling M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory for
accessing the excitation manifold of electrons and chiral virtual photons. We
apply the developed methods to selected chiral systems and show that the
mean-field theory captures cavity frequency dispersion, but fails to describe
the chiral discrimination arising from coupled electron-photon excitations.

Valley, as a ubiquitous degree of freedom in lattices, has found wide
applications in both electronic and classical-wave devices in recent years.
However, achieving valley-polarized states, a prerequisite for valley-based
operations, still remains challenging. Here, we propose and experimentally
demonstrate a universal non-Hermitian mechanism for valley filtering using only
uniform background dissipation, which creates a propagation length contrast
between valleys through their intrinsic group velocity differences. We
implement this concept in an acoustic crystal, observing switchable and robust
valley polarization of sound through large-scale field mapping. Remarkably, our
approach is solely based on uniform loss, without the need for any special
lattice structures, tailored excitations, or external fields. We further
provide designs of our non-Hermitian valley filter on photonic and electronic
platforms. Our results offer a simple and effective solution to
valley-polarized state generation and may advance the development of novel
valley-based devices in both classical and quantum regimes.

Photocatalytic hydrogen (H2) production and carbon dioxide (CO2) conversion
to methane (CH4) are considered promising solutions for reducing CO2 emissions.
However, the development of highly active photocatalysts is essential to
efficiently drive these reactions without harming the environment. In this
study, we introduce a strategy that incorporates elements with both low and
high electronegativities into catalysts based on transition metals, thereby
enhancing both reactant adsorption and charge transfer. This strategy is
implemented in a high-entropy oxide (HEO) by adding cesium, an alkali metal
with very low electronegativity, and gallium, a metal with high
electronegativity, to transition metals titanium, niobium and tantalum. The
resulting oxide, TiNbTaGaCsO9 with a large concentration of oxygen vacancies,
exhibits strong light absorption, a low bandgap and a suitable band structure
for both hydrogen evolution and CO2 conversion. Compared to HEOs with only d0
or d0+d10 cationic configurations, the synthesized oxide with a wide
electronegativity difference and mixed d0+d10+s0 cationic configurations shows
significantly higher activity for both H2 and CH4 production, even without
using a cocatalyst. These results demonstrate a design strategy for creating
highly active HEOs containing alkali metals by taking advantage of the
electronegativity mismatch across the periodic table.

We present high-precision ab initio calculations of the static and dynamic
polarizability of the barium monohydroxide ($^{138}$BaOH) molecule, using
relativistic coupled-cluster theory. By thoroughly investigating the dependence
of the calculated polarizabilities on computational parameters (basis set size,
treatment of relativity, level of treatment of electron correlation, and
vibrational corrections), a procedure to determine uncertainties is constructed
and applied. The dipole moment of BaOH is also calculated and compared to
experiment, confirming the accuracy of the predicted polarizabilities. The
static and dynamic ($\lambda=1064\;\text{nm}$) polarizability was calculated
for both the ground state and the (010) vibrational bending mode, the latter
state being particularly interesting for a wide range of quantum experiments.
The ground state static polarizabilities were calculated to be 200.8(24) a.u.
and 297(5) a.u. for the parallel and perpendicular components respectively.

The symmetry-broken correlated states in twisted double bilayer graphene
(TDBG) can be tuned via several external knobs, including twist angle,
displacement field, and carrier density. However, a direct, momentum-resolved
characterization of how these parameters reshape the flat-band structure
remains limited. In this study, we employ micro focused angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy to investigate the flat-band dispersion of TDBG at a
twist angle of 1.6, systematically varying the displacement field and carrier
density via electrostatic gating. We directly observe multiple flat moir'e
minibands near charge neutrality, including a flat remote valence band residing
below the low-energy flat-band manifold. Furthermore, the dominant Coulomb
repulsive energy over the flat- band bandwidth suggests favorable conditions
for the emergence of interaction-driven correlated phenomena in TDBG. These
findings establish that the formation and evolution of flat bands in TDBG
arises from the interplay between the electron filling and the displacement
field.

The theory of the intrinsic Hall effect, both linear and nonlinear, is rooted
in a geometry which is defined in the Bloch-vector parameter space; the formal
expressions are mostly derived from semiclassical concepts. When disorder and
interaction are considered there is no Bloch vector to speak of; one needs a
more general quantum geometry, defined in a different parameter space. Such
higher-level geometrical formulation of the intrinsic Hall effect provides very
compact expressions, which have the additional virtue -- in the Bloch special
case -- of yielding the known results in a straightforward way: the logic is
not concealed by the algebra.

In this study, we consider a two-layer graphene structure stacked in the AA
form and exposed to the influence of two different electric fields applied to
different layers. The graphene layers are also subjected to an external
magnetic field perpendicular to the planes of the layers. We investigate the
possible effects of the applied in-plane fields and the magnetic field on
excitonic pairing, antiferromagnetic order, and the chemical potential.
Simultaneously, we analyze the effects of the interlayer Coulomb interaction
potential on the physical properties of the considered system. We demonstrate
that the application of planar electric fields leads to the formation of an
unusually large bandgap in the electronic band structure, which is not typical
for AA-stacked bilayer graphene. We discuss various values of the applied
electric field potentials and show their influence on the electronic band
structure of the system. Additionally, we identify the existence of a critical
value of the magnetic field above which Wigner crystallization-like effect is
present for the electrons, also affecting the excitonic gap in one spin
channel. The results obtained in this study could be important for applications
of AA-stacked bilayer graphene as a large band-gap material.

- **TL;DR**: 通过分析小振幅激发与扭结缺陷的散射，得到了重标度的Manning势。该研究基于非线性Klein-Gordon哈密顿量，描述了一维分子链在双曲衬底势中的动力学行为。

A rescaled Manning potential is obtained in the analysis of scatterings of
small- amplitude excitations with a kink defect. The generic model is a
nonlinear Klein- Gordon Hamiltonian describing a one-dimensional chain of
identical molecules, sub- jected to an hyperbolic single-particle substrate
potential. To account for isotope effects that are likely to affect
characteristic equilibrium parameters of the molec- ular chain, including the
lattice spacing (i.e. the characteristic intermolecuar dis- tance) and/or the
barrier height, the hyperbolic substrate potential is endowed with a real
parameter whose variation makes it suitable for the description of molecu- lar
excitations in a broad range of systems with inversion symmetry. These include
hydrogen-bonded molecular crystals, {\alpha}-helix proteins, long polymer
chains and two- state quantum-tunneling systems in general. Double-well models
with deformable profiles are relevant in physical contexts where the
equilibrium configurations are sensitive to atomic or molecular substitutions,
dilution, solvation and so on.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文开发了一个统一框架来描述具有均匀螺位错密度的电子系统在磁场中的热力学和量子振荡行为，所有观测值都可由单一可调能隙参数组织。

We develop a unified, single-scale description of thermodynamics and quantum
oscillations in electronic systems with a uniform areal density of screw
dislocations under a uniform magnetic field. A single tunable gap,
$\hbar|\omega_{eff}|$ with $\omega_{eff}=\omega_{c}+\omega_{cl}$, organizes all
equilibrium observables obtained from a compact harmonic-oscillator partition
function: free energy, internal energy, entropy, heat capacity, magnetization,
magnetic susceptibility, and magnetocaloric responses collapse onto universal
hyperbolic kernels in $x=\hbar|\omega_{eff}|/(2k_{B}T)$. We identify a
compensated-field regime where the transverse gap closes and the heat capacity
reaches an equipartition plateau, providing a sharp signature of magnetoelastic
interference. In transport and torque, the same scale rigidly shifts the Hall
fan and compresses the $1/B$ period of de Haas-van Alphen and Shubnikov-de Haas
oscillations when expressed in $1/B_{eff}$, enabling a phase-unwarping protocol
that metrologizes the dislocation density from a single field sweep. In
mesoscopic samples, boundary corrections to the Landau degeneracy generate
finite-size calorimetric oscillations that diagnose the effective magnetic
length. Moderate disorder and weak interactions preserve the kernel structure
while smoothing amplitudes. We outline an experimental roadmap combining
on-chip calorimetry, torque magnetometry, and transport, and discuss
device-level opportunities in caloritronics and strain engineering,
magnetocaloric microcooling, magnetoelastic heat switching, and dilatometric
transduction, where the single scale $\hbar|\omega_{eff}|$ enables rational
design and optimization.

### Atomic displacements drive flat band formation and lateral electron and hole separation in near-60 degree twisted MoSe2/WSe2 bilayers

- **TL;DR**: 在接近60度扭曲的MoSe2/WSe2异质双层中，约3度扭曲时出现价带和导带平带，原子位移产生极化梯度形成限制势，导致电子和空穴在莫尔超晶胞内局域化和横向分离。

Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) bilayers with an interlayer twist
exhibit a moire super-period, whose effects can manifest in both structural and
electronic properties. Atomic displacements can lead to reconstruction into
domains of aligned stacking, and flat bands can form that may host correlated
electron states. In heterobilayers angular mismatch is nearly unavoidable, so
understanding the consequences of an interlayer twist is essential. Using ab
initio density functional theory, we find that in near-60 degree twisted
MoSe2/WSe2 bilayers valence and conduction band flat bands emerge at ~3 degree
twist. Despite relatively limited reconstruction at these angles, atomic
displacement creates a polarization gradient that forms a confining potential,
localizing and laterally separating electrons and holes within the moire
supercell. Excitons formed from flat band electrons and holes should therefore
have not only the out-of-plane dipole moment familiar from MoSe2/WSe2
interlayer excitons, but an in-plane dipole moment as well.

### Temperature-invariant magneto-optical Kerr effect in a noncollinear antiferromagnet

- **TL;DR**: 在非共线反铁磁体Mn3NiN中，通过1550nm红外波长下的极向克尔效应测量，发现了温度不变的克尔信号，证实了贝里曲率的本征性质。

The anomalous Hall effect and magneto-optical Kerr effect have traditionally
been associated with ferromagnets, but recent studies reveal their presence in
noncollinear antiferromagnets due to nonzero Berry curvature despite negligible
net magnetization. However, Hall measurements often show strong temperature
dependence caused by extrinsic scattering, complicating quantitative analysis,
and temperature invariance of the Kerr effect remains unconfirmed. Here we
employ epitaxial, stoichiometric Mn3NiN single crystal films and perform polar
Kerr measurements at an infrared 1550 nm telecommunication wavelength,
demonstrating a spontaneous Kerr signal that remains stable within a few
percent across a 200 Kelvin range below the N\'eel temperature. This
temperature-invariant Kerr effect contrasts with the strongly
temperature-dependent Hall effect and confirms the intrinsic nature of Berry
curvature in these materials. Our findings establish infrared Kerr effect as a
reliable, local probe of Berry curvature in noncollinear antiferromagnets,
facilitating quantitative characterization and advancing antiferromagnetic
spintronic applications.

### How Accurate Are DFT Forces? Unexpectedly Large Uncertainties in Molecular Datasets

- **TL;DR**: 该论文分析了多个机器学习原子间势能数据集中的DFT数值误差问题，发现多个数据集存在显著的非零净力和力分量误差，强调了DFT数据收敛性对MLIP准确性的重要性。

Training of general-purpose machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs)
relies on large datasets with properties usually computed with density
functional theory (DFT). A pre-requisite for accurate MLIPs is that the DFT
data are well converged to minimize numerical errors. A possible symptom of
errors in DFT force components is nonzero net force. Here, we consider net
forces in datasets including SPICE, Transition1x, ANI-1x, ANI-1xbb, AIMNet2,
QCML, and OMol25. Several of these datasets suffer from significant nonzero DFT
net forces. We also quantify individual force component errors by comparison to
recomputed forces using more reliable DFT settings at the same level of theory,
and we find significant discrepancies in force components averaging from 1.7
meV/{\AA} in the SPICE dataset to 33.2 meV/{\AA} in the ANI-1x dataset. These
findings underscore the importance of well converged DFT data as increasingly
accurate MLIP architectures become available.

### Adaptive Ising machine based on phase-locking of an auto-oscillator to a bi-harmonic external driving with noise

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种自适应伊辛机(AIM)，通过双谐波驱动和噪声的协同作用，可在确定性计算和概率性计算之间动态切换的统一振荡器架构。

We introduce a universal theory of phase auto-oscillators driven by a bi
harmonic signal (having frequency components close to single and double of the
free-running oscillator frequency) with noise. With it, we show how
deterministic phase locking and stochastic phase slips can be continuously
tuned by varying the relative amplitudes and frequencies of the driving
components. Using, as an example, a spin-torque nano-oscillator, we numerically
validate this theory by implementing a deterministic Ising machine paradigm, a
probabilistic one, and dual-mode operation of the two. This demonstration
introduces the concept of adaptive Ising machines (AIM), a unified
oscillator-based architecture that dynamically combines both regimes within the
same hardware platform by properly tuning the amplitudes of the bi-harmonic
driving relative to the noise strength. Benchmarking on different classes of
combinatorial optimization problems, the AIM exhibits complementary performance
compared to oscillator based Ising machines and probabilistic Ising machines,
with adaptability to the specific problem class. This work introduces the first
OIM capable of transitioning between deterministic and probabilistic
computation taking advantage of a proper design of the trade-off between the
strength of phase-locking of an auto-oscillator to a bi harmonic external
driving and noise, opening a path toward scalable, CMOS compatible hardware for
hybrid optimization and inference.

### DFT-informed Design of Radiation-Resistant Dilute Ternary Cu Alloys

- **TL;DR**: 开发了一种系统的高通量计算框架，通过添加与空位结合并降低其迁移率的溶质来设计抗辐射的稀三元铜基合金，促进间隙-空位复合。

This research establishes a systematic, high-throughput computational
framework for designing radiation-resistant, dilute ternary copper-based alloys
by addition of solutes that bind to vacancies and reduce their mobility, thus
promoting interstitial-vacancy recombination. The first challenge in developing
alloys by this method is mitigating the vacancy-mediated solute drag effect,
since density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that solutes that bind
strongly to vacancies are also rapidly dragged to point-defect sinks, and thus
removed from the matrix. To overcome this issue, two types of solutes are added
to the Cu matrix: A first solute with a strong vacancy binding energy (B-type
species) and another solute that binds to 'B' and is a slow diffuser in Cu
(C-type species). Using DFT, 21 synergistic solute pairs are screened, with
'B'=Zr, Ge, Sn and 'C'=Fe, Co, Mo, Ni, Nb, W, Cr. Two promising alloys,
Cu(Zr,Co) and Cu(Zr,Fe) are then investigated in detail in the dilute regime.
Diffusion and solute drag in these alloys are modeled using the kinetic cluster
expansion approach (KineCluE) under irradiation conditions. It is shown that
strong Zr-'C' thermodynamic binding, especially between Zr and Co,
significantly reduces the mobility of Zr solute and suppresses the
vacancy-mediated solute drag. Using an analytical framework for the standard
five-jump frequency model for diffusion in binary alloys, it is found that
vacancy-Zr-Co triplets disrupt the kinetic circuits that promote solute drag in
the binary alloy by raising the dissociation barrier for the vacancy from the
solute.

### Spin-Locked Helical Currents and Pure Spin Pumping in Altermagnetic Nanotubes

We show that rolling a two-dimensional altermagnet into a nanotube turns it
into a spin-programmable chiral nanosolenoid with two reciprocal, SOC-free
functionalities. (i) Direct: injecting a single-spin-polarized current produces
a steady helical current whose handedness is locked to the spin orientation,
yielding opposite axial magnetic fields for opposite spins. (ii) Inverse: a
time-varying axial flux Phi(t) induces a circumferential Faraday field E_theta
= -(dPhi/dt)/(2 pi R) that drives equal-magnitude, opposite-sign axial charge
currents in the two spin channels, Iz^up = - Iz^down, thereby pumping a pure
spin current Is = (hbar/2e)(Iz^up - Iz^down) with zero net charge flow. Both
effects arise from the interplay between momentum-odd spin polarization
inherent to altermagnets and the screw symmetry of the rolled geometry, and
persist in the complete absence of spin-orbit coupling. Using V2Se2O as a
prototype, first-principles calculations reveal spin-dependent chiral wave
functions near both the conduction- and valence-band edges. These results
establish a nonrelativistic route toward compact spin-controlled flux
generators and charge-neutral spin injectors in light-element materials without
static magnetic bias.

- **TL;DR**: Dara是一个自动化X射线衍射数据分析框架，通过穷举搜索和Rietveld精修来自动识别多相系统中的晶体结构，提高XRD分析的可靠性和准确性。

Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) is a foundational technique for characterizing
crystalline materials. However, the reliable interpretation of XRD patterns,
particularly in multiphase systems, remains a manual and expertise-demanding
task. As a characterization method that only provides structural information,
multiple reference phases can often be fit to a single pattern, leading to
potential misinterpretation when alternative solutions are overlooked. To ease
humans' efforts and address the challenge, we introduce Dara (Data-driven
Automated Rietveld Analysis), a framework designed to automate the robust
identification and refinement of multiple phases from powder XRD data. Dara
performs an exhaustive tree search over all plausible phase combinations within
a given chemical space and validates each hypothesis using a robust Rietveld
refinement routine (BGMN). Key features include structural database filtering,
automatic clustering of isostructural phases during tree expansion,
peak-matching-based scoring to identify promising phases for refinement. When
ambiguity exists, Dara generates multiple hypothesis which can then be decided
between by human experts or with further characteriztion tools. By enhancing
the reliability and accuracy of phase identification, Dara enables scalable
analysis of realistic complex XRD patterns and provides a foundation for
integration into multimodal characterization workflows, moving toward fully
self-driving materials discovery.

Despite the remarkable success in increasing the efficiency and stability of
perovskite solar cells over the last decade, the underlying defect landscape of
halide perovskites remains unclear. Some charged defects in perovskites migrate
in response to an applied electric field, which complicates their
characterization with standard techniques. We combine thermal admittance
spectroscopy (TAS) with lateral photoconductivity-based methods, such as the
thermal steady-state photocurrent (SSPC) and the steady-state photocarrier
grating (SSPG), to estimate the kinetic and electrical properties of defects in
thin films of vacuum-deposited FA$_{0.7}$Cs$_{0.3}$Pb(I$_{0.9}$Br$_{0.1}$)$_3$
perovskite. The experimental results are consistent with exponential band tails
states coming from the lattice disorder, an acceptor-like Gaussian distribution
0.21~eV below the conduction band and approximately equal concentrations of
donors and acceptors ($1.7\times10^{17}$ cm$^{-3}$). One of the dopants has
room temperature mobility of $(0.5{-}1)\times10^{-7}$ cm$^2$ V$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$
with a thermal activation energy of 0.28--0.40 eV.

Moment Tensor Potentials (MTPs) are machine-learning interatomic potentials
whose basis functions are typically selected using a level-based scheme that is
data-agnostic. We introduce a post-training, cost-aware pruning strategy that
removes expensive basis functions with minimal loss of accuracy. Applied to
nickel and silicon-oxygen systems, it yields models up to seven times faster
than standard MTPs. The method requires no new data and remains fully
compatible with current MTP implementations.

Herein, we conduct a comprehensive investigation of Hexa-graphyne (HXGY), a
planar carbon allotrope formed by distorted hexagonal and rectangular rings
incorporating sp and sp$^2$-hybridized carbon atoms. First-principles
calculations confirm its energetic, dynamical and thermal stability (up to at
least 1000 K). Regarding its band structure, this material exhibits a
semimetallic nature. It exhibits high mechanical compliance, with a Young's
modulus approximately 13 times lower and a Poisson's ratio nearly 4 times
higher than those of graphene. The optical response is marked by strong
ultraviolet absorption, high infrared reflectivity, and pronounced transparency
in the visible-light range. Raman and infrared spectra exhibit sharp and
well-separated peaks, providing a clear signature of acetylenic linkage
stretching vibrations. Nanoribbon structures derived from HXGY show distinct
electronic behaviors depending on the edge termination type and width. These
findings highlight the HXGY potential for nanoelectronic and optoelectronic
applications.
