- **TL;DR**: 使用有限元法模拟8种不同人工晶状体模型的机械稳定性，评估轴向位移、弹性模量和应力等生物力学指标。

This study aimed to simulate the mechanical stability of eight different
(three commercial and five variations) haptic IOL models using FEM to measure
mechanical biomarkers (axial displacement, elasticity modulus, and stress)
under quasi-static compression. The results revealed that a commercial IOL
model exhibited a better mechanical response for smaller compression forces
than the other models. Conversely, a variation model performed better for
larger compression forces. These findings may help in developing more
mechanically stable IOL models.

### ComProScanner: A multi-agent based framework for composition-property structured data extraction from scientific literature

- **TL;DR**: 开发了一个名为ComProScanner的多智能体平台，用于从科学文献中自动提取、验证、分类和可视化化学成分、性质及合成数据，以构建机器学习数据集。

Since the advent of various pre-trained large language models, extracting
structured knowledge from scientific text has experienced a revolutionary
change compared with traditional machine learning or natural language
processing techniques. Despite these advances, accessible automated tools that
allow users to construct, validate, and visualise datasets from scientific
literature extraction remain scarce. We therefore developed ComProScanner, an
autonomous multi-agent platform that facilitates the extraction, validation,
classification, and visualisation of machine-readable chemical compositions and
properties, integrated with synthesis data from journal articles for
comprehensive database creation. We evaluated our framework using 100 journal
articles against 10 different LLMs, including both open-source and proprietary
models, to extract highly complex compositions associated with ceramic
piezoelectric materials and corresponding piezoelectric strain coefficients
(d33), motivated by the lack of a large dataset for such materials.
DeepSeek-V3-0324 outperformed all models with a significant overall accuracy of
0.82. This framework provides a simple, user-friendly, readily-usable package
for extracting highly complex experimental data buried in the literature to
build machine learning or deep learning datasets.

### Kinetics of Peierls dimerization transition: Machine learning force-field approach

- **TL;DR**: 开发了机器学习力场框架，用于模拟电荷密度波的非平衡动力学，揭示了电荷密度波畴的两阶段粗化行为。

We present a machine learning (ML) force-field framework for simulating the
non-equilibrium dynamics of charge-density-wave (CDW) order driven by the
Peierls instability. Since the Peierls distortion arises from the coupling
between lattice displacements and itinerant electrons, evaluating the adiabatic
forces during time evolution is computationally intensive, particularly for
large systems. To overcome this bottleneck, we develop a generalized
Behler-Parrinello neural-network architecture -- originally formulated for ab
initio molecular dynamics -- to accurately and efficiently predict forces from
local structural environments. Using the locality of electronic responses, the
resulting ML force field achieves linear scaling efficiency while maintaining
quantitative accuracy. Large-scale dynamical simulations using this framework
uncover a two-stage coarsening behavior of CDW domains: an early-time regime
characterized by a power-law growth $L \sim t^{\alpha}$ with an effective
exponent $\alpha \approx 0.7$, followed by a crossover to the Allen-Cahn
scaling $L \sim \sqrt{t}$ at late times. The enhanced early-time coarsening is
attributed to anisotropic domain-wall motion arising from electron-mediated
directional interactions. This work demonstrates the promise of ML-based force
fields for multiscale dynamical modeling of condensed-matter lattice models.

We have studied the electron-electron interactions in the system composed of
two metallic wires, placed in the external magnetic and electric fields. The
interactions between the electrons in the wires have been taken into account
within the usual Hubbard model. We have considered both half-filling and
partial-filling limits for the occupation of the atomic lattice sites. We show
the existence of the excitonic pairing in this low-dimensional system and
calculate the excitonic order parameter in different electron-electron
interaction regime, magnetic field and temperature. We demonstrate that the
usual Hubbard-$U$ interaction leads to strong electron localization which
enhance the local antiferromagnetic order in the system.

### A unified picture of phonon anomalies in crystals and glasses

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一个共振阻尼模型，统一解释了晶体中的van Hove奇点和玻璃中的玻色峰这两种振动异常现象，揭示了它们共同的物理起源。

Phonon spectra in solids often display anomalies that defy the simple Debye
law, most prominently the van Hove singularity in crystals and the boson peak
in glasses. Although traditionally regarded as distinct, both features are
increasingly recognized as sharing a common physical origin. In a recent work,
G. Ding et al. (Nat. Phys. 2025) propose a resonant-damping model that unifies
these anomalies within a single framework. By coupling phonon damping to
vibrational softening, their theory explains why some materials exhibit van
Hove peaks, others boson peaks, and many show both. This advance extends
earlier ideas and theories of Baggioli and Zaccone on the competition between
phonon propagation and damping, while also connecting to microscopic mechanisms
such as nonaffine motions in glasses. The resonant-damping paradigm thus offers
a promising step toward a unified understanding of vibrational anomalies across
ordered and disordered solids.

### Approach to equilibrium for a particle interacting with a harmonic thermal bath

- **TL;DR**: 研究谐振子探针与大型耦合振子链相互作用时的位置-位置关联函数长时间演化，发现在探针频率与浴频谱匹配时系统会出现热化现象，但高阶耦合项仍包含振荡或幂律衰减项，表明浴不能完全视为随机恒温器。

We study the long time evolution of the position-position correlation
function $C_{\alpha,N}(s,t)$ for a harmonic oscillator (the {\it probe})
interacting via a coupling $\alpha$ with a large chain of $N$ coupled
oscillators (the {\it heat bath}). At $t=0$ the probe and the bath are in
equilibrium at temperature $T_P$ and $T_B$, respectively. We show that for
times $t$ and $s$ of the order of $N$, $C_{\alpha,N}(s,t)$ is very well
approximated by its limit $C_{\alpha}(s,t)$ as $N\to\infty$. We find that, if
the frequency $\Omega$ of the probe is in the spectrum of the bath, the system
appears to thermalize, at least at higher order in $\alpha$. This means that,
at order 0 in $\alpha$, $C_\alpha(s,t)$ equals the correlation of a probe in
contact with an ideal stochastic {\it thermostat}, that is forced by a white
noise and subject to dissipation. In particular we find that $\lim_{t\to\infty}
C_\alpha(t,t)=T_B/\Omega^2$ while that $\lim_{\tau\to\infty}
C_\alpha(\tau,\tau+t)$ exists and decays exponentially in $t$. Notwithstanding
this, at higher order in $\alpha$, $C_{\alpha}(s,t)$ contains terms that
oscillate or vanish as a power law in $|t-s|$. That is, even when the bath is
very large, it cannot be thought of as a stochastic thermostat. When the
frequency of the bath is far from the spectrum of the bath, no thermalization
is observed.

### Fokker-Planck equation governing the distribution of walkers in AFQMC

- **TL;DR**: 本文推导了辅助场量子蒙特卡洛(AFQMC)的Fokker-Planck方程，并提出了求解该方程的新数值方案，揭示了AFQMC算法实际采样的波函数特性。

Auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) is typically formulated as an
open-ended random walk in an overcomplete space of Slater determinants,
implemented through a Langevin equation. However, the explicit form of the
underlying Fokker-Planck equation governing the walker population distribution
has remained unknown. In this paper, we derive the Fokker-Planck equation for
AFQMC and propose a novel numerical scheme to solve it. The solution of the
Fokker-Planck equation reveals the wavefunction actually sampled by the AFQMC
algorithm. Interestingly, we find that even when the exact ground state is used
as a guiding wavefunction in constrained path AFQMC, contrary to the common
assumption, the wavefunction sampled by AFQMC is not exact. Beyond clarifying
several fundamental aspects of AFQMC, the availability of a Fokker-Planck
equation formulation opens new avenues for systematically improving its
accuracy, which we outline in this paper.

### Quantum geometry and impurity sensitivity of superconductors without time-reversal symmetry: application to rhombohedral graphene and altermagnets

- **TL;DR**: 量子几何对超导体无序敏感性的影响，特别是在时间反演对称性破缺时，会导致量子几何对破坏和复杂的Tc行为。

Analyzing the consequences of the quantum geometry induced by the momentum
dependence of Bloch states has emerged as a very rich and active field in
condensed matter physics. For instance, for the superfluid stiffness or the
pairing mechanism, these geometric aspects can play an important role. We here
demonstrate that quantum geometry can also be essential for the disorder
sensitivity of a superconductor, in particular when time-reversal symmetry is
broken in the normal-state Bloch Hamiltonian. We derive a general expression
for the behavior of the critical temperature $T_c$ involving weighted
(anti-)commutators of the superconducting order parameter and impurity matrix
elements, which includes both wave-function effects and kinetic pair breaking
due to broken time-reversal symmetry in the dispersion. We analyze how the
former effects lead to "quantum geometric pair breaking", where any
superconductor becomes susceptible to microscopically non-magnetic impurities,
and formally relate it to the maximum possible localization of two-particle
Wannier states. Further, in the presence of kinetic pair breaking, impurities
can also enhance pairing, leading to an overall more complex, non-monotonic
behavior of $T_c$ with impurity concentration. We also analyze the fate of
finite-momentum pairing. Our results are directly relevant to rhombohedral
graphene, twisted MoTe$_2$, and superconducting altermagnets.

### Circuit-based cavity magnonics in the ultrastrong and deep-strong coupling regimes

- **TL;DR**: 研究腔磁系统中非微扰强耦合现象，发现在超强和深强耦合区域出现非平凡频移，建立了经典电路模型与量子模型的联系，揭示了频移与量子资源的关系。

We theoretically study nonperturbative strong-coupling phenomena in cavity
magnonics systems in which the uniform magnetization dynamics (magnons) in a
ferromagnet is coupled to the microwave magnetic field (photons) of a single LC
resonator. Starting from an effective circuit model that accounts for the
magnetization dynamics described by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, we
show that a nontrivial frequency shift emerges in the ultrastrong and
deep-strong coupling regimes, whose microscopic origin remains elusive within a
purely classical framework. The circuit model is further quantized to derive a
minimal quantum mechanical model for generic cavity magnonics, which
corresponds to a two-mode version of the Hopfield Hamiltonian and explains the
mechanism of the frequency shifts found in the {\it classical} circuit model.
We also formulate the relation between the frequency shift and quantum
quantities, such as the ground-state particle number, quantum fluctuations
associated with the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, and entanglement entropy,
providing a nondestructive means to experimentally access to these quantum
resources. By utilizing soft magnons in an anisotropic ferromagnet, we further
demonstrate that these quantum quantities diverge at the zeros of the magnon
band edges as a function of the external magnetic field. This work paves the
way for cavity magnonics beyond the conventional strong coupling regime.

### Canted antiferromagnetism and excitonic order in gated double-layer graphene

We study the effects of the electron-electron interactions on the excitonic
properties and charge-density modulations in the AB stacked double-layer (DL)
graphene, placed in the external gate-potential $V$. The coexistence of the
canted antiferromagnetic order and excitonic pairing gap has been studied with
the help of the generalized Hubbard model. We calculate the chemical potential
$\mu$, the average charge density difference between the layers
$\delta{\bar{n}}$, the antiferromagnetic gap-function $\Delta_{\rm AFM}$ and
the excitonic order parameters $\Delta_{\sigma}$ in the zero temperature limit.
We found that the excitonic pairing order parameter has a larger energy scale
than the canted antiferromagnetic gap-function. The charge neutrality, in the
DL graphene system, occurs only in the absence of the external gate-potential
$V$. Moreover, we have shown that the values of the antiferromagnetic
gap-function $\Delta_{\rm AFM}$ and excitonic order parameter $\Delta_{\sigma}$
are always increasing at the large values of inter-layer Coulomb interaction,
while they are decreasing for large values of the applied gate-potential $V$.

### Good Enough is Better: Feasibility vs. Pareto-Optimality in Alloy Design

- **TL;DR**: 在合金设计中，约束满足方法比基于优化的方法更有可能找到可行的合金，并且能更早找到第一个可行解

In alloy design, the search for candidate materials is often framed as an
optimization problem, with the goal of identifying Pareto-optimal solutions
across multiple objectives. However, Pareto-optimal solutions do not
necessarily satisfy all minimum performance thresholds required for practical
deployment. An alternative approach is to treat alloy design as a constraint
satisfaction problem, in which the goal is to identify any solution that meets
all bare minimum requirements across multiple quantities of interest. These
approaches have yet to be benchmarked against each other in the context of
realistic alloy design problems. In this work, we demonstrate that, in
realistic alloy design campaigns involving multiple objectives and constraints,
the constraint satisfaction framework yields a higher likelihood of finding
viable alloys than optimization-based approaches. Furthermore,
constraint-satisfaction approaches find the first viable alloy solutions
earlier than optimization. Our results suggest that focusing on feasibility
rather than optimality can lead to more actionable outcomes in materials
discovery, particularly in highly constrained applications.

### Temporal Renormalization and the Critical-like Behavior in Supercooled Liquids

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种基于Kadanoff变换的时间重正化方案，应用于过冷液体的长时间动力学，发现了三个特征时间尺度对应的临界行为。

Inspired by the Kadanoff transformation in the standard renormalization group
theory, we propose a temporal renormalization scheme. A Boltzmann factor that
explicitly depends on the renormalized timescale is constructed, permitting
thermodynamic quantities to be evaluated self-consistently across different
timescales. By applying the scheme to the long-time dynamics of supercooled
liquids, we uncover critical-like behaviors of supercooled liquid with three
characteristic renormalization timescales: At the first timescale s_{\alpha},
the system appears to be "thermodynamically frozen", i.e., the energy
fluctuation becomes temperature-independent throughout the supercooled regime.
At the second timescale s_{\beta}, the third-order moment of energy
distribution reaches a maximum, and s_{\beta} is nearly
temperature-independent. At the third timescale s_{\gamma}, the third-order
moment of energy distribution passes through a minimum, and s_{\gamma} diverges
as a power law s_{\gamma}=(T-T_{c})^(-{\gamma}). The scaling relations may
reveal an intrinsic behavior in supercooled liquids, highlighting their unique
feature. The current findings also demonstrate that temporal renormalization
provides a powerful lens for investigating the timescale-specific dynamics.

### Applying R-Matrix Theory to Atom-Molecule Inelastic Collisions: the case study of H$_2$O + H

- **TL;DR**: 基于R矩阵形式理论研究了原子与不对称顶分子非弹性散射，建立了空间固定坐标系中的严格框架，相比传统紧耦合方法在保持精度的同时显著减少计算时间，并利用GPU加速实现一个数量级的速度提升。

The present study presents a comprehensive theoretical investigation of atom
and asymmetric top molecule inelastic scattering based on the R-matrix
formalism. The proposed methodology establishes a rigorous framework for
treating inelastic collisions in the space-fixed coordinate system. The
excellent numerical performance of the method is demonstrated through the
comparison of state-to-state rotationally inelastic R-matrix cross sections for
the H + H$_2$O system with those obtained using conventional close-coupling
(CC) theory. The R-matrix approach is shown to deliver results of comparable
accuracy while achieving substantially reduced computation times. The method is
furthermore shown to achieve more than one order-of-magnitude speedup by
exploiting GPU-accelerated diagonalisation through the MAGMA library. This
combination of accuracy and computational efficiency positions the R--matrix
approach as a powerful and scalable tool for investigating inelastic scattering
involving complex polyatomic systems, thereby paving the way for systematic
studies of molecule-molecule interactions in astrophysical, atmospheric, and
cold-matter environments.

### Correlation between magnetism and lattice dynamics for cubic FeGe under pressure

This first-principles study investigates the structural, electronic, lattice
dynamical properties, and electron-phonon coupling in ferromagnetic cubic B20
FeGe under applied pressure. The implemented spin-scaling exchange-correlation
(ssxc) approach allowed to modify the magnetic moment and ferromagnetic phase
energetics using a single scaling parameter, thereby yielding an adjustment of
the critical pressure ($p_c$) to its experimental value. The ssxc scheme
resulted in a subtle energy shift of the electronic bands in the spin-up
channel, and reduced the magnetic moment, bringing it closer to the
experimentally reported value. Application of the ssxc approach to phonon
dispersion and electron-phonon interaction resulted in a slight mitigation of
the pronounced softening and large linewidths of the lowest-frequency acoustic
branch close to the $R$-point, typically observed with standard DFT
calculations. With increasing pressure, phonon anomaly and linewidths diminish
significantly and practically disappear at $p_c$ and beyond. This trend
parallels the pressure dependence of the magnetic moment. A comparative
analysis of the electronic joint density of states with the phonon linewidths
revealed that the momentum dependence of linewidths around the $R$-point
closely follow the momentum dependence of the electron-phonon matrix elements.
This indicates that the correlation between magnetic moment and linewidths
under applied pressure originates from the electron-phonon matrix elements,
presenting a distinct scenario compared to other B20 family members, where
nesting plays a more dominating role.

### Intrinsic Non-linearity of Josephson Junctions as an Alternative Origin of the Missing First Shapiro Step

- **TL;DR**: 论文发现约瑟夫森结中缺失的第一个夏皮罗台阶可能不是马约拉纳束缚态的标志，而是由结的非线性电流-电压特性引起的，并伴随有独特的锯齿状边界特征。

The missing first Shapiro step in microwave-irradiated Josephson junctions
has been widely interpreted as a hallmark of Majorana bound states. However,
conventional mechanisms like junction underdamping or Joule heating can produce
similar signatures. Here, we demonstrate that the intrinsic non-linear
current-voltage characteristic of low-to-moderate transparency junctions can
also suppress the first step, accompanied by distinctive zigzag boundaries
between the zeroth and first step at intermediate driving frequencies.
Microwave measurements on Al/WTe2 junctions and numerical simulations of a
non-linear resistively and capacitively shunted junction model reveal the first
step collapse induced by switching jumps of current, together with zigzag
features absent in scenarios solely driven by finite \b{eta} or Joule heating.
This zigzag signature therefore provides a crucial diagnostic tool, emphasizing
the necessity of comprehensive analysis of microwave spectra before attributing
the absence of the first Shapiro step to Majorana physics.

### Temperley-Lieb integrable models and fusion categories

- **TL;DR**: 该论文展示了包含非可逆自对偶对象的融合范畴如何产生可积任意子链，其哈密顿量满足Temperley-Lieb代数，并讨论了这些模型的能谱特性和能隙性质。

We show that every fusion category containing a non-invertible, self-dual
object $a$ gives rise to an integrable anyonic chain whose Hamiltonian density
satisfies the Temperley-Lieb algebra. This spin chain arises by considering the
projection onto the identity channel in the fusion process $a\otimes a$. We
relate these models to Pasquier's construction of ADE lattice models. We then
exploit the underlying Temperley-Lieb structure to discuss the spectrum of
these models and argue that these models are gapped when the quantum dimension
of $a$ is greater than 2. We show that for fusion categories where the
dimension is close to 2, such as the Fib$\times$Fib and Haagerup fusion
categories, the finite size effects are large and they can obscure the
numerical analysis of the gap.

### Domain wall induced topological Hall effect in the chiral-lattice ferromagnet Fe$_x$TaS$_2$

Magnetic topology and its associated emergent phenomena are central to
realizing intriguing quantum states and spintronics functionalities. Designing
spin textures to achieve strong and distinct electrical responses remains a
significant challenge. Layered transition metal dichalcogenides offer a
versatile platform for tailoring structural and magnetic properties, enabling
access to a wide spectrum of topological magnetic states. Here, we report a
domain-wall-driven, large, and tunable topological Hall effect (THE) in a
non-centrosymmetric intercalated transition metal dichalcogenides series
Fe$_x$TaS$_2$. By systematically varying the Fe intercalation level, we exert
precise control over the magnetic ground states, allowing manipulation of the
topological Hall effect. Real-space magnetic force microscopy (MFM) provides
direct evidence of periodic magnetic stripe domain formation, confirming the
microscopic origin of the observed topological transport phenomena. Our
findings establish a promising way for tuning the topology of domains to
generate substantial electromagnetic responses in layered magnetic materials.

### Self-diffusion in confined systems

- **TL;DR**: 研究硬球流体在平行板受限条件下的自扩散过程，推导出自扩散系数的理论表达式，并与分子动力学模拟结果高度吻合。

The self-diffusion process of a hard sphere fluid confined by two parallel
plates separated by a distance on the order of the particle diameter is
studied. The starting point is a closed kinetic equation for the distribution
function that takes into account the effects of the confinement and that is
valid in the low-density limit. From it, the Boltzmann-Lorentz equation that
describes the dynamics of some tagged particles when the whole system is in
equilibrium is derived. An equation that describes the diffusion in the
directions parallel to the walls is deduced by applying the Zwanzig-Mori
projection technique to the Boltzmann-Lorentz equation, obtaining an explicit
expression for the self-diffusion coefficient that depends on the height of the
system. A very good agreement between its theoretical prediction and Molecular
Dynamics simulation results is obtained for the whole range of heights.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种基于图神经网络的隐式溶剂模型LSNN，通过匹配自由能导数解决了传统ML方法无法进行绝对自由能比较的问题，在保持计算效率的同时达到了与显式溶剂相当的精度。

The implicit solvent approach offers a computationally efficient framework to
model solvation effects in molecular simulations. However, its accuracy often
falls short compared to explicit solvent models, limiting its use in precise
thermodynamic calculations. Recent advancements in machine learning (ML)
present an opportunity to overcome these limitations by leveraging neural
networks to develop more precise implicit solvent potentials for diverse
applications. A major drawback of current ML-based methods is their reliance on
force-matching alone, which can lead to energy predictions that differ by an
arbitrary constant and are therefore unsuitable for absolute free energy
comparisons. Here, we introduce a novel methodology with a graph neural network
(GNN)-based implicit solvent model, dubbed Lambda Solvation Neural Network
(LSNN). In addition to force-matching, this network was trained to match the
derivatives of alchemical variables, ensuring that solvation free energies can
be meaningfully compared across chemical species.. Trained on a dataset of
approximately 300,000 small molecules, LSNN achieves free energy predictions
with accuracy comparable to explicit-solvent alchemical simulations, while
offering a computational speedup and establishing a foundational framework for
future applications in drug discovery.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究系统探索了在α相钽薄膜上形成高质量氧化层的多种技术，发现等离子体氧化能产生最平滑、最高质量的氧化层，适合用于约瑟夫森结制造，并成功演示了在氧化α-Ta薄膜上的外延生长。

Tantalum (Ta) has recently emerged as a promising low-loss material, enabling
record coherence times in superconducting qubits. This enhanced performance is
largely attributed to its stable native oxide, which is believed to host fewer
two-level system (TLS) defects key $-$ contributors to decoherence in
superconducting circuits. Nevertheless, aluminum oxide (AlO$_x$) remains the
predominant choice for Josephson junction barriers in most qubit architectures.
In this study, we systematically investigate various techniques for forming
high-quality oxide layers on $\alpha$-phase tantalum ($\alpha$-Ta) thin films,
aiming to develop effective Josephson junction barriers. We explore thermal
oxidation in a tube furnace, rapid thermal annealing, as well as plasma
oxidation of both room-temperature and heated Ta films, and propose a
mechanistic picture of the underlying oxidation mechanisms. All methods yield
Ta$_2$O$_5$, the same compound as tantalum's native oxide. Among these, plasma
oxidation produces the smoothest and highest-quality oxide layers, making it
particularly well-suited for Josephson junction fabrication. Furthermore, we
demonstrate the successful epitaxial growth of $\alpha$-Ta atop oxidized
$\alpha$-Ta films, paving the way for the realization of trilayer Ta/Ta-O/Ta
Josephson junctions with clean, low-loss interfaces.

We investigate the second-order anomalous Hall response in two-dimensional
higher-wave-symmetric magnets, including the recently discovered class of
collinear magnets known as altermagnets, when subjected to a symmetry-breaking
external electric field. In these systems, the first- and second-order
anomalous Hall responses mediated by the first- and second-order multipoles of
the Berry curvature over the occupied states vanish by symmetry. However, a
symmetry-breaking dc electric field can induce a nonzero Berry curvature dipole
by coupling to a nonvanishing quantum metric, also known as the Berry
connection polarizability. An applied ac electric field can then generate a
finite nonlinear transverse Hall effect characterized by a second harmonic
response. We discuss this remarkable effect in a class of
higher-order-symmetric unconventional magnets (of $p$, $d$, $f$, $g$, $i$
symmetry), including the subclass of altermagnets. We demonstrate that the
electric-field-induced anomalous Hall effect in the higher-wave-symmetric
magnets can serve not only as a probe of the underlying quantum metric of the
occupied states but also as a means to distinguish the even ($d$-,$g$-wave) and
odd ($p$-wave) order parameter symmetries defined on the square lattice.

We investigate the weak interaction integer quantum Hall (IQH) phase, the
intermediate interaction phase identified as a chiral spin liquid (CSL) and the
transition between them in the triangular lattice Hofstadter-Hubbard model at a
density of one electron per site in an orbital magnetic field corresponding to
one-quarter flux per plaquette. Our primary tool is the finite system density
matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method with both interaction-strength scan
and fixed interaction techniques for cylinders of circumference 3, 5, and 7 and
lengths up to 240. For the IQH phase, we use single particle exact
diagonalization to clarify finite size effects, including an excess charge on
the edges of our cylinders, and the limitations of entanglement spectra
degeneracies on small circumference cylinders. For both phases, we use DMRG to
study the entanglement spectra, the entanglement entropy, and the effect of
flux insertion on charge and spin pumping, all of which show key differences
between the two phases. To study the transition, we use interaction-strength
scans extending between the two phases, and apply a scaling data collapse of a
bond-dimerization order parameter to extract critical exponents. We also
extract critical behavior from the divergence of correlation lengths on the IQH
side, measuring decay away from edges of both the dimerization order parameter
and transverse edge currents. The critical behavior and exponents are
consistent with an Ising transition in 1+1 dimensions. Finally, we obtain
excited states in various quantum number sectors finding that the gap to a
charge neutral momentum $\pi$ excitation corresponding to fluctuations of the
dimerization order parameter closes in the vicinity of the critical point but
gaps to other excitations remain large.

Recently, spin splitting of non-relativistic origin in compensated
antiferromagnets has drawn growing attention in condensed matter research.
Although many materials, now known to exhibit such spin splitting, have been
studied for decades, their manifestation along non-high-symmetry momentum
directions initially hindered their recognition. In recent years, significant
progress has been made in uncovering the symmetry principles that allow
non-relativistic spin splitting in the absence of net magnetization, revealing
the unconventional physics arising from their coexistence. In this review, we
provide a concise overview of non-relativistic spin splitting in compensated
antiferromagnets with various spin configurations, including collinear,
coplanar, and non-coplanar spin arrangements. We summarize practical
identification guidelines, highlight characteristic features in electronic band
structures, and discuss the emerging functionalities, with an emphasis on
promising directions for future exploration.

### Predictive Indicator of Critical Point in Equilibrium and Nonequilibrium Magnetic Systems

Determining critical points of phase transitions from partial data is
essential to avoid abrupt system collapses and reducing experimental or
computational costs. However, the complex physical systems and phase transition
phenomena have long hindered the development of unified approaches applicable
to both equilibrium and nonequilibrium phase transitions. In this work, we
propose predictive indicators to determine critical points in equilibrium and
nonequilibrium magnetic systems based on frequency-dependent response function.
For equilibrium phase transition, such as magnetization switching under
magnetic field, the static magnetization response function to a perturbing
magnetic field diverges at the critical field, serving as a noise-resilient
predictive indicator that also reflects the transition order and critical
exponents. In contrast, for nonequilibrium phase transition, such as
magnetization switching driven by spin-transfer torque, static response fails
to signal criticality. Instead, the dynamic response at ferromagnetic resonance
frequency diverges at the critical point, which is also robust against thermal
noise. We further demonstrate that these static and dynamic indicators can be
unified in the frame of first-order linear differential systems, offering a
generalizable strategy for predicting criticality in both equilibrium and
nonequilibrium transitions.

### An interpretable molecular descriptor for machine learning predictions in atmospheric science

- **TL;DR**: 提出了ATMOMACCS描述符，结合MACCS指纹和SIMPOL方法的基元，用于大气化合物的机器学习建模，显著提升了多种热力学性质的预测精度。

The study of aerosol formation and chemistry using machine learning is
limited by the lack of molecular descriptors suited to atmospheric compounds.
Interpretable models are particularly affected because they often rely on
dictionary-based descriptors tied to specific molecular substructures, which
currently fail to capture the full range of organic atmospheric compounds,
including large, highly oxidized molecules common in the atmosphere. We
introduce ATMOMACCS, an interpretable descriptor combining the 166 binary keys
of the MACCS fingerprint with motifs inspired by the SIMPOL method for
estimating saturation vapor pressures. We show that ATMOMACCS based models
improve predictions of saturation vapor pressures (7-8 % error reduction),
equilibrium partition coefficients (5 % and 9 % error reduction), glass
transition temperatures (22 % error reduction), and enthalpy of vaporization
(61 % error reduction) on four datasets with atmospheric compounds. Feature
analysis shows that saturation vapor pressure and partition coefficients are
governed by carbon number and oxygen-related features, whereas other
phase-transition properties (e.g., enthalpy of vaporization, glass transition
temperature) depend on carbon-hydrogen bond types and the presence of
heteroatoms other than oxygen. This highlights the generalizability of
ATMOMACCS across different datasets and properties as an interpretable
molecular descriptor.

A range of of unusual emergent behaviors have been reported in the
charge-density wave (CDW) state of the $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A=~$K, Rb, Cs) kagome
metals, including a CDW formation process without soft phonons, which points to
an unconventional CDW mechanism. Here, we use inelastic x-ray scattering to
show that the CDW in KV$_3$Sb$_5$ forms via phonons that soften to zero energy
at the CDW ordering vector ($L$-point) around $T_{\rm CDW}=78$~K. These soft
phonons exhibit a remarkable in-plane anisotropy, extending over a much larger
momentum range along $L$-$A$ relative to $L$-$H$, which leads to diffuse
scattering common among $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$. Using first-principles calculations, we
find that the momentum-dependent electron-phonon coupling (EPC) is peaked at
$L$ and exhibits the same in-plane anisotropy as the phonon softening.
Conversely, the electronic susceptibility is not peaked at $L$ and shows the
opposite in-plane anisotropy. Our findings favor momentum-dependent EPC as the
driving mechanism of the CDW in KV$_3$Sb$_5$, with a CDW formation process
similar to that of transition metal dichalcogenides.

A superlattice of multilayer graphene and hBN has proven to be a promising
pathway for engineering electronic band structures and topologies. In this
work, we experimentally demonstrate the role of hBN alignment in inducing
topological band reconstruction in bilayer graphene (BLG) superlattices. Our
study establishes that while the primary band retains its massive chiral naure,
the secondary bands host massless, chiral fermions. Magnetotransport
measurements, including Quantum Hall, temperature-dependent Shubnikov-de Haas
oscillations, and Berry phase analysis, confirm the distinct topological nature
of these bands. A significantly reduced Fermi velocity in the moir\'{e}
secondary band indicates band flattening induced by the moir\'{e} potential.
Our study provides a pathway for controlling topological quantum transport in
BLG/hBN superlattices.

### Dimensionality-Changing Transition from a Non-Fermi Liquid to a Spin-Solid in a Multichannel Kondo Lattice

A multichannel Kondo system, where a single quantum spin couples to multiple
channels of an electronic bath, provides one of the simplest examples of a
zero-dimensional non-Fermi liquid. It is natural to ask: what happens when an
extensive number of such systems are coupled together? A simple renormalization
group argument implies that in a chain of SU(N) multichannel quantum systems,
where each spin is coupled to its own bath of K channels, the individual spins
dynamically decouple at low energy when N&gt;K, resulting in a 'sliding' non-Fermi
liquid. Using Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations, we find evidences of a
continuous, 'dimensionality-changing' phase transition out of this non-Fermi
liquid into a valence-bond solid phase as the intersite coupling is increased.
Remarkably, at the critical point, correlations exhibit a power-law behavior
even along the direction in which the spins are coupled, indicating the
breakdown of dynamical decoupling at the transition. We also develop an RG
scheme to understand the universal aspects of this transition.

Rectification properties of semiconductor p-n junction diodes are the basic
and important characteristics for electronic device evaluation, especially for
novel semiconductor materials. Today's semiconductor devices' fabrication and
integration processes require multibillion-dollar investments and are desired
to be reduced or simplified. Therefore, low-cost and non-toxic base metal
materials with simple fabrication methods are desired for the future
semiconductor industry. Recently, copper-based sulfides have been studied for
semiconductor devices such as thermoelectric, photovoltaic, or water-splitting
applications. Here, a highly rectifying p-n diode of a cubic (disordered) phase
Cu4Fe5S8 polycrystal with a zincblende-like structure fabricated by a
simple/low-cost wet process is shown. It is found that the Cu4Fe5S8 diode shows
the highest rectification ratio in the order of 106 with a large forward
current density of 15 Acm-2 (@1.5 V forward bias) at room temperature among the
other compounds of copper iron sulfide devices. This remarkable and stable
diode characteristic obtained by the p-type layer anodically grown on the
sintered n-type cubic-Cu4Fe5S8 can bring the industry closer to low-cost
semiconductor manufacturing. These results open a platform of novel
semiconductor materials such as cubic-Cu4Fe5S8 with further superior crystal
growth and conductive characteristics.

"Every object that biology studies is a system of systems." (Fran\c{c}ois
Jacob, 1974). Most networks feature intricate architectures originating from
tinkering, a repetitive use of existing components where structures are not
invented but reshaped. Still, linking the properties of primitive components to
the emergent behavior of composite networks remains a key open challenge. Here,
by composing scale-invariant networks, we show how tinkering decouples Fiedler
and spectral dimensions, hitherto considered identical, providing valuable
insights into mesoscopic and macroscopic collective regimes.

### Stoichiometrically-informed symbolic regression for extracting chemical reaction mechanisms from data

A data-driven computational method is introduced to extract chemical reaction
mechanisms from time series chemical concentration data. It is realized through
the use of dynamic symbolic regression in which a sparse analytical form for a
dynamical system is discoverable from the underlying data. We specifically
develop the stoichiometrically-informed symbolic regression (SISR) method to
address a standing challenge in complex chemical reaction networks: Given a
time-series dataset of concentrations of several components, what is the
mechanism and the associated rate constants? SISR finds the optimal mechanism,
kinetic equations and rate constants by combining differential optimization
with a genetic optimization approach that searches a symbolic space of possible
reaction mechanisms. Use of SISR in several paradigmatic examples spanning
linear and nonlinear reaction schemes results in excellent agreement between
true and predicted mechanisms, including when the method is applied to noisy
data. The advantages of a stoichiometrically-informed approach such as SISR to
address reaction discovery is illustrated through comparison with the use of
generic state-of-the-art data-driven approaches.

Kitaev chain is a one-dimensional spinless fermion model that has $p$-wave
superconducting (SC) states and Majorana zero modes at the edge. Usually this
model is analyzed by taking only SC order parameter (OP) into account, but the
situation significantly changes when OPs other than the SCOP are included. It
turns out that the SC state in the latter case is prone to phase separation for
moderate to strong attractiive interactions.

We investigate the thermoelectric transport properties of an interacting
parallel double quantum dot in the Coulomb-blockade regime. Building on an
analytical solution based on an equation-of-motion technique, we extend the
formalism for the asymmetrically coupled situation and provide compact
closed-form expressions for steady-state currents together with the
differential conductance, Seebeck coefficient, and thermal conductance. We
determine the operating points that maximize efficiency and output power of the
system, clarifying their relation to standard near-equilibrium ZT expressions.
We further study the thermal rectification in both the open- and closed-circuit
configurations and derive an expression for the open-circuit case.
Interaction-induced resonances are understood in terms of the poles of the
resulting Green's function, generating gate and bias dependent regions of
enhanced efficiency at finite power, negative differential thermal conductance,
and finite thermal rectification.

The study of quasiparticle dynamics is central to understanding
non-equilibrium phenomena in quantum many-body systems. Direct simulation of
such dynamics on quantum hardware has been limited by circuit depth and noise
constraints. In this work, we use a recently developed constant-depth circuit
algorithm to examine the real-time evolution of site-resolved magnetization in
a transverse-field Ising chain on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. By
representing each spin as a pair of Majorana fermions, we identify two distinct
dynamical regimes governed by the relative strength of spin interaction.
Furthermore, we show how local impurities can serve as probes of Majorana
modes, acting as dynamical barriers in the weak coupling regime. These results
demonstrate that constant-depth quantum circuits provide a viable route for
studying quasiparticle propagation and for probing Majorana signatures on
currently available quantum processors.

- **TL;DR**: 钙原子在高压下可以表现出从负价到+2价的多价态行为，在CaI中观察到不寻常的电子从碘5p轨道转移到钙3d轨道，形成阴离子性质的钙。

An isolated calcium (Ca) atom has empty d-orbitals under ambient conditions.
However, s-d band hybridization has been observed in both elemental Ca and
compounds by manipulating thermodynamic conditions. Here, we reveal that the Ca
3d-band can even capture electrons from halogen atoms under pressure,
exhibiting anionic behaviors in iodides. We predict a CsCl-type monovalent CaI
at above 50 GPa by employing first-principles structural searching and
successfully identified the phase at 84 GPa using in situ X-ray diffraction. We
further reveal that, due to the effect of orbital broadening, unusual charge
transfer from the 5p orbitals of I to the 3d orbitals of Ca in CaI, gradually
reverses the ionicity of Ca and becomes the anionic ICa at 485 GPa. Multivalent
Ca stabilizes a set of metallic iodides with eight- to ten-fold iodine
hyper-coordination. Our findings demonstrate that the valence states of Ca can
vary from negative to +2, suggesting much greater complexity of Ca chemistry
under ultrahigh pressures.

We investigate electron transport and phase-breaking processes in thin
titanium nitride (TiN) films of epitaxial quality. Previous studies show that a
minute surface magnetic disorder significantly reduces the critical temperature
($T_\mathrm{c}$) and broadens the superconducting transition as the film
thickness and device size decrease. We measure electron dephasing rates via
magnetoresistance from $T_\mathrm{c}$ to $\sim 4T_\mathrm{c}$ in
various-thickness TiN films. Electron dephasing occurs on the picosecond
timescale and is nearly independent of temperature, differing from the expected
inelastic scattering due to the electron-phonon and electron-electron
interactions near $T_\mathrm{c}$, which occur over a nanosecond timescale. We
propose spin-flip scattering as a possible additional phase-breaking mechanism.
The significant increase in the dephasing rate for the thinnest film indicates
that magnetic disorder resides near the surface of naturally oxidized films.
Our research suggests that magnetic disorder may be a significant contributor
to RF dissipation in superconducting devices based on TiN.

- **TL;DR**: 本文系统评估了电子磁圆二色性(EMCD)在透射电镜中的定量分析极限，使用FeRh相变材料作为可调磁性参考，验证了EMCD在约6nm探针尺寸下与X射线磁圆二色性(XMCD)基准的一致性。

Electron magnetic circular dichroism (EMCD) in transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) enables element-specific measurement of spin and orbital
magnetic moments, analogous to X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD). While
the EMCD technique offers unmatched spatial resolution, its quantitative
accuracy remains under scrutiny, particularly in beam-splitter geometries with
convergent probes. Here, we systematically evaluate the limits of quantitative
EMCD analysis using the first-order magnetostructural transition in the
functional phase-change material FeRh as a tunable magnetic reference. Unlike
previous EMCD studies primarily focused on elemental ferromagnets such as Fe,
we demonstrate its applicability to a correlated material exhibiting coupled
structural and magnetic order. We demonstrate that the extracted
orbital-to-spin moment ratio ($m_\text{L}/m_\text{S}$) remains consistent with
XMCD benchmarks for TEM probes down to approximately 6 nm, thereby establishing
the validity range for reliable quantification. For nm-sized probes with higher
convergence angles, we observe an enhanced $m_\text{L}/m_\text{S}$, which we
attribute to a combination of instrumental factors and sensitivity to nanoscale
heterogeneity within the probed volume. Our results confirm that EMCD provides
quantitative agreement with macroscale techniques under suitable conditions,
while uniquely enabling spatially confined measurements of local magnetic
moments in functional magnetic materials, and allowing the study of
interfacial, defect-mediated, or phase-separated magnetism that is inaccessible
to photon-based methods.

Recently, a non-Hermitian Anderson impurity model with one-body loss has been
studied in [Phys. Rev. B 111, 125157 (2025)}], and it has been demonstrated
that the renormalization effect generated by strong correlations
counterintuitively changes the nature of dissipation into an emergent many-body
dissipation that causes a Kondo breakdown. In a closely related context, it is
also known that two-body loss in a non-Hermitian Kondo model triggers the Kondo
breakdown. To elucidate the essence of these phenomena, we study the Anderson
impurity model with a non-Hermitian complex hybridization as an effective model
that provides a simple understanding of the Kondo breakdown. Using the
slave-boson mean-field theory, we show that this model can explain the Kondo
breakdown with a single complex parameter. Furthermore, we provide the exact
Bethe ansatz solutions that support the results obtained by the slave-boson
mean-field theory. Finally, we point out that the Lehmann representation for
the non-Hermitian Green function cannot be obtained by the analytic
continuation to the complex energy upon the Kondo breakdown, where the
analyticity of the non-Hermitian Green function in the half-complex-$\omega$
plane no longer holds.

The adsorption of PBr3 on the Si(100)-2$\times$1 surface was studied by
scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and density functional theory (DFT). The
PBr3 molecule completely dissociates on the Si(100) surface at room temperature
into P and Br atoms. In most cases, the dissociated molecule was observed in
STM on three neighboring Si dimers. DFT calculations confirm that the PBr3
molecule can completely dissociate at room temperature. After annealing the
sample to 400$^{\circ}$C, phosphorus is incorporated into silicon, as evidenced
by the Si atoms ejected to the surface. These findings are useful for the
insertion of individual phosphorus atoms into silicon by PBr3 adsorption
through a halogen mask.

### Quantifying robustness and locality of Majorana bound states in interacting systems

Protecting qubits from perturbations is a central challenge in quantum
computing. Topological superconductors with separated Majorana bound states
(MBSs) provide a strong form of protection that only depends on the locality of
perturbations. While the link between MBS separation, robust degeneracy, and
protected braiding is well understood in non-interacting systems, recent
experimental progress in short quantum-dot-based Kitaev chains highlights the
need to establish these connections rigorously for interacting systems. We do
this by defining MBSs from many-body ground states and show how their locality
constrains their coupling to an environment. This, in turn, quantifies the
protection of the energy degeneracy and the feasibility of non-abelian
braiding.

### Microscopic evidence of a field-induced critical spin-liquid state in a frustrated metal

A field-induced quantum spin liquid (QSL) state is an extraordinary
phenomenon, hitherto unobserved in metallic frustrated compounds. Recent bulk
measurements have revealed intriguing field-induced magnetic states in metallic
frustrated CePdAl. However, the nature of these field-induced states,
potentially including a QSL state, remains unclear due to the lack of detailed
microscopic investigation. To elucidate these field-induced states, we employed
the transverse-field muon spin relaxation/rotation (TF-$\mu$SR) technique,
applying various magnetic fields parallel to the c-axis in single-crystalline
CePdAl over a broad temperature range (100~K-100~mK). Our $\mu$SR data indicate
that field-induced low-temperature states for fields B$\leq B_{c2}(=3.4~T)$
exhibit long-range magnetic order, whereas for B&gt;$B_{c2}$ they yield
contrasting behavior. Notably, at 3.75 T, the transverse relaxation rate
($\lambda_T$) diverges following a power-law dependence below 800~mK along with
an indication of finite frustration, whereas the Knight shift is temperature
independent. These observations corroborate the signature of a critical
spin-liquid (CSL) with antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations. Furthermore, at 4.3
T, a non-Fermi liquid state is observed where frustration is absent. This
comprehensive microscopic study strongly suggests the existence of a CSL state
in a metallic frustrated system.

### Vacancy diffusion on a brominated Si(100) surface: Critical effect of the dangling bond charge state

Silicon dangling bonds (DBs) on an adsorbate-covered Si(100) surface can be
created in a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) with high precision required
for a number of applications. However, vacancies containing DBs can diffuse,
disrupting precisely created structures. In this work, we study the diffusion
of Br vacancies on a Si(100)-2$\times$1-Br surface in an STM under typical
imaging conditions. In agreement with previous work, Br vacancies diffuse at a
positive sample bias voltage. Here, we demonstrated that only vacancies
containing a positively charged DB hop across the two atoms of a single Si
dimer, while vacancies containing neutral and negatively charged DBs do not.
Calculations based on the density functional theory confirmed that positively
charged Br (and Cl) vacancies have a minimum activation barrier. We propose
that diffusion operates by both one-electron and two-electron mechanisms
depending on the applied voltage. Our results show that the DB charge has a
critical effect on the vacancy diffusion. This effect should be taken into
account when imaging surface structures with charged DBs, as well as when
studying the diffusion of other atoms and molecules on the Si(100) surface with
vacancies in an adsorbate layer.

### Time-braiding phase of anyons tied to the nonuniversal scaling dimension

We use a braiding nonequilibrium fluctuation dissipation relation linking the
DC noise to the response function inferred from the braiding constraint in the
time-domain with a phase $\theta$ within the UNEPT (Unified Non equilibrium
Perturbative Theory). By applying the Kramers-Kr\"onig relations, we obtain an
integral equation connecting DC current and noise that involves $\theta$. By
specifying to thermal states so that noise is Poissonian, we find an analytical
solution for the DC current via the Wiener-Hopf technique. It reveals that the
time-braiding phase is determined by the scaling dimension~$\delta$. This
questions the universality of $\theta$ that can reflect the microscopic edge
dynamics, in contrast to the topologically protected braiding phase in the
space domain.

### Critical fluctuations and conserved dynamics in a strange ferromagnetic metal

- **TL;DR**: 在奇异金属铁磁体CeRh6Ge4中观察到Grüneisen比在量子临界点发散，具有动力学临界指数z=3，表明量子奇点涉及守恒自由度，需要超越朗道范式的描述。

The origin of the strange metallic behavior observed in a wide range of
quantum materials is an open challenge to condensed matter physics.
Historically, strange metals were uniquely associated with antiferromagnetic
quantum critical points (QCPs), but a new generation of materials reveals their
association with uniform order parameters, such as ferromagnetism, valley or
nematic order, suggesting a deeper common denominator. At a QCP, order
parameter fluctuations are characterized by the dynamical critical exponent
$z$, which quantifies the space-time scaling asymmetry. Here, we report the
observation of a divergence in the Gr\"uneisen ratio at the QCP of the
strange-metal ferromagnet CeRh$_6$Ge$_4$ with a dynamical critical exponent
$z=3$, signaling that the underlying quantum singularity involves a conserved
degree of freedom. Yet the magnetization of this easy-plane ferromagnet is not
conserved. We argue that the $z=3$ strange criticality requires a description
beyond the Landau paradigm, proposing a link with the gauge modes of the
small-to-large Fermi surface transition and the associated gauge charge of the
delocalizing heavy electrons.

Cost-effective materials are essential for large-scale deployment. The
emerging magnetocaloric hydrogen liquefaction technology could transform the
liquid hydrogen industry due to its potential in achieving higher efficiency.
Most studies of the cryogenic magnetocaloric effect (MCE) have focused on
resource-critical rare-earth-based compounds. Here we report on an ionic
magnetocaloric compound FeCl$_2$ which is based on ultralow-cost elements, as a
candidate working material for hydrogen liquefaction. FeCl$_2$ shows both
inverse and conventional MCE. From 0 to 1.5 T, the inverse effect yields a
positive magnetic entropy change ($\Delta S_T$) of about 5 J/kg/K near 20 K,
then declines toward zero at higher fields. In contrast, the conventional
(negative) response strengthens with field. The $\Delta S_T$ reaches 18.6
J/kg/K near 20 K in magnetic fields of 5 T. This value exceeds most light
rare-earth-based compounds and approaches that of heavy rare-earth-based
compounds. In magnetic fields of 5 T, the adiabatic temperature change reaches
about 3.6 K. The large $\Delta S_T$, along with the low cost of the elements in
FeCl$_2$, are prerequisites for inexpensive industrial-scale production, giving
the prospect of a practical magnetocaloric candidate for hydrogen liquefaction
in the 20 $\sim$ 77 K temperature window.

Molecular-scale materials with bistable behavior and tunable properties are
increasingly relevant for next-generation nanoscale electronic devices. Helical
foldamers are promising candidates, but their structural and mechanical
properties are highly sensitive to conformational stability and environmental
conditions. A systematic methodology based on quantum-chemical calculations is
proposed for assessing solvent-dependent mechanical behavior, combining
analysis of $\pi-\pi$ stacking interactions, conformational energetics, and
environmental effects. Using this methodology we identified simple design
principles for the rapid screening of new compounds, allowing evaluation of
their conformational stability and effective mechanical rigidity. Applying
these principles, we identify a modified helical aromatic foldamer that
exhibits improved mechanical and stability characteristics compared to the
initial reference compound.

### Metallic island array as synthetic quantum matter: fractionalized entropy and thermal transport

The surprisingly rich physics of a single Coulomb-blockaded metallic island,
when coupled to quantum Hall edge channels, is now well established -- giving
rise to charge fractionalization and multi-channel quantum impurity behavior.
Here, we show that qualitatively new physics emerges in arrays of such
elements. We consider a 1D chain of $N$ metallic islands, focusing on
thermodynamic signatures such as quantized entropy and anomalous thermal
conductance. Universal and robust behavior emerges for energy scales smaller
than the charging energy of the islands. In particular, we demonstrate that for
the bulk filling factor of $\nu=1$, the islands could support a finite heat
flow without temperature difference between them. Upon pinching the array with
a quantum point contact, we predict an entropy change that scales with the
number of islands as $\Delta S = \frac{1}{2}k_B \log (N+1)$, which can be
measured using charge detection. This fractional entropy suggests the emergence
of a novel type of excitations in the array.

### Predicting the 3D microstructure of SOFC anodes from 2D SEM images using stochastic microstructure modeling and CNNs

- **TL;DR**: 提出一种从2D SEM图像预测3D微观结构的新方法，使用随机几何的低参数3D模型生成虚拟3D结构，通过物理模拟获得对应2D图像，训练CNN网络实现3D重建。

The 3D microstructure of solid oxide fuel cell anodes significantly
influences their electrochemical performance, but conventional methods for
acquiring high-resolution microstructural 3D data such as focused ion beam
scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) are costly in both time and resources.
In contrast, obtaining 2D images, such as from scanning electron microscopy
(SEM), is more accessible, though typically providing insufficient information
to accurately characterize the 3D microstructure. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel approach that predicts the 3D microstructure from 2D SEM
images. The presented method utilizes a low-parametric 3D model from stochastic
geometry to generate a large number of virtual 3D microstructures and employs a
physics-based SEM simulation tool to obtain the corresponding 2D SEM images. By
systematically varying the underlying model parameters, a large dataset can be
generated to train convolutional neural networks (CNNs). By doing so, we can
statistically reconstruct the 3D microstructure from 2D SEM images by drawing
realizations from the stochastic 3D model using the predicted model parameters.
In addition, we conducted an error analysis on key geometrical descriptors to
quantitatively evaluate the accuracy and reliability of this stereological
prediction tool.

### Conductance Anomaly in a Partially Open Adiabatic Quantum Point Contact

We demonstrate that conductance anomalies can arise in a clean, adiabatic
quantum point contact when a channel is partially open. Even for a smooth
barrier potential, backscattering induces Friedel oscillations that, via
electron interactions, generate a singular correction to the conductance. This
correction is maximized when the channel is half-open, resulting in a reduction
of conductance. In addition, a magnetic field applied perpendicular to the
spin-orbit axis modifies the single-particle spectrum, resulting in conductance
oscillations via Fabry-P\'erot-type interference, as well as a non-monotonic
field dependence of the anomaly. Our findings reveal a universal mechanism by
which interactions modify the conductance of an ideal partially open channel
and offer a possible explanation for the anomalous features observed in
experiments.

Many strongly correlated states, such as those arising in the fractional

by dividing particles into multiple clusters, constructing a readily evaluable
wave function in each cluster, and (anti)symmetrizing across these clusters. We
introduce a method to compute quantities such as energies and correlators,
using Monte Carlo simulations for these states. Our framework overcomes the
factorial scaling of explicit (anti)symmetrization, allowing for studies of
systems beyond the reach of exact diagonalization.

Nickel based superalloys display outstanding properties such as excellent
creep strength, remarkable fracture toughness parameters, and corrosion
resistance. For this reason, Ni based materials are considered as materials
dedicated to the IV generation of nuclear reactors. Although these materials
seem promising candidates, their radiation resistance and impact of radiation
damage on the deformation mechanism are still not fully understood. In this
work, two commercially available nickel based alloys, Hastelloy X and Haynes
230, were investigated. Structural and mechanical properties have been
described by means of SEM and EBSD, TEM, and nanoindentation tests. Radiation
damage has been performed by Ar ion with energy 320keV with two doses up to
12dpa. Obtained results have revealed a hardening effect for both levels of
damage. However, more intensive effects were observed for Hastelloy X.
Moreover, a significant change in precipitates morphology in Hastelloy X has
been observed. It has been proposed that structural differences between both
alloys determine the type of occurring radiation induced processes. Excess
energy deposited into materials structure during ion irradiation can lower the
temperature of nucleation of high temperature phases, which initiates the
formation of grain boundary serrations.

Motivated by recent experiments on rhombohedral stacked multilayer graphene
and the observation of the anomalous Hall effect in a spontaneous spin-valley
polarized quarter metal state, we calculate the anomalous Hall conductivity for
this system in the presence of two types of impurities: weak and dense as well
as sparse and strong. Our calculation of $\sigma_{xy}$ is based on the
Kubo-Streda diagrammatic approach. In a model with Gaussian disorder applicable
to weak dense impurities, this involves all non-crossing diagrams (intrinsic,
side-jump and Gaussian skew-scattering contributions) and additionally diagrams
with two intersecting impurities, X and $\Psi$, representing diffractive
skew-scattering processes. A "Mercedes star" diagram (non-Gaussian skew
scattering) is furthermore included to treat in the case of strong, sparse
impurities. We supplement our asymptotically exact analytical solutions for an
isotropic model without warping effects by semi-numerical calculations
accounting perturbatively for warping, which plays a crucial role in the
low-energy band structure.

We present a systematic study of multi-magnon bound states (MBSs) in the
spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$ FM-AFM $J_1$-$J_2$ chain under magnetic fields using the
density-matrix renormalization group method. As a quantitative measure of
stability, we compute the magnon binding energy $E_{\rm b}(M,p)$ for bound
clusters of size $p$ over wide ranges of the frustration ratio $J_2/|J_1|$ and
the normalized magnetization $M/M_{\rm s}$. Near saturation, we benchmark our
data against the analytic two-magnon result and map out a clear hierarchy of
$p$-magnon states, whose phase boundaries follow an empirical scaling
$J_{2,{\rm c}}(p;p\!+\!1)/|J_1|\!\approx\!0.34\,p^{-2.3}$ for large $p$. We
further quantify the relation between the most stable $p$ and the zero-field
pitch angle $\theta$, verifying the conjectured inequality
$1/p&gt;\theta/\pi&gt;1/(p+1)$ up to $p \lesssim 9$. The binding energy shows
pronounced suppression as $J_2/|J_1|\!\to\!1/4^+$ and, for some frustration
values, attains a maximum below full saturation, indicating that partial
depolarization enhances bound-magnon mobility. Close to the FM instability,
$E_{\rm b}(M_{\rm s},p)$ exhibits an empirical power-law vanishing consistent
with a quantum-Lifshitz scenario. Our results provide a comprehensive,
experimentally relevant map of MBS stability across field and frustration,
offering concrete guidance for inelastic probes in quasi-one-dimensional

The electrochemical performance of the spinel LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4, a high-voltage
positive electrode material for Li-ion batteries, is influenced by the
transition metal arrangement in the octahedral network, leading to disordered
(Fd m S.G.) and ordered3 (P4332 S.G.) structures. However, widely used
techniques lack the spatial resolution necessary to elucidate the ordering
phenomenon at the particle scale. Using the 4D-STEM technique, we present the
first direct observation of ordering distribution in individual LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4
particles with nanometric spatial resolution. We propose a quantification
method for the local degree of ordering based on the ratio of ordered to
disordered spinel lattices along the particle thickness extracted from electron
diffraction spot intensities. In an ordered spinel LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4, the
transition metal ordering is consistently observed throughout the primary
particle. However, the extent of ordering in the spinel phase depends on its
distribution at the particle scale, a factor influenced by the annealing
conditions. The 4D-STEM analysis elucidates the boundary between highly-ordered
and low-ordered LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 particles.

### Charge-density waves and stripes in quarter metals of graphene heterostructures

- **TL;DR**: 本文在石墨烯家族中识别出谷相干电荷密度波（VC-CDW）序，该序在偶数层石墨烯中表现为条纹序，在奇数层中保持C3对称性，并与反常霍尔序共存于四分之一金属中。

Motivated by recent experiments, here we identify valley-coherent
charge-density wave (VC-CDW) order in the non-degenerate quarter-metal for the
entire family of chirally-stacked $n$ layer graphene, encompassing rhombohedral
multi-layer, Bernal bilayer, and monolayer cousins. Besides the hallmark broken
translational symmetry, yielding a modulated charge-density over an enlarged
unit-cell with a characteristic $2{\bf K}$ periodicity, where $\pm {\bf K}$ are
the valley momenta, this phase lacks the three-fold ($C_3$) rotational symmetry
but only for even integer $n$. The VC-CDW then represents a stripe order, as
observed in hexalayer graphene [arXiv:2504.05129], but preserves the $C_3$
symmetry for odd $n$ as observed in trilayer graphene [Nat. Phys. 20, 1413
(2024) and arXiv: 2411.11163]. From a universal Clifford algebraic argument, we
establish that the VC-CDW and an anomalous Hall order can lift the residual
valley degeneracy of an antiferromagnetically ordered spin-polarized
half-metal, when these systems are subject to perpendicular displacement
fields, with only the latter one displaying a hysteresis in off-diagonal
resistivity, as observed in all the systems with $2 \leq n \leq 6$. We showcase
a confluence of VC-CDW and anomalous Hall orders within the quarter-metal,
generically displaying a regime of coexistence, separating the pure phases.

We theoretically analyze the topological insulator (TI) surface state
mediated interactions between local moments in a proximate 2D ferromagnetic
insulator (FMI) motivated by recent experiments that show a significant
increase in the Curie temperature Tc of FMI-TI heterostructures. Such
interactions have been investigated earlier with a focus on dilute magnetic
dopants in TIs. Our problem involves a dense set of moments for which we find
that the short range Bloembergen-Rowland interaction, arising from virtual
particle-hole transitions between the valence and conduction bands, dominates
over the oscillatory Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction. We show
that the Tc enhancement is proportional to the Van Vleck susceptibility and
that the spin-momentum locking of surface states leads to out-of-plane
ferromagnetic order in the FMI. We investigate how the hybridization between
top and bottom surfaces in a thin TI film impacts Tc enhancement, and show how
our results can help understand recent experiments on atomically thin
Cr2Te3-(Bi,Sb)2Te3.

Resonant Inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) is a synchrotron-based
spectroscopy that has seen growing interest across a range of scientific
disciplines beyond fundamental physics. The interpretation of experimental RIXS
data requires theoretical calculations based on the Kramers-Heisenberg formula.
However, due to the dependence of RIXS on both the incident and scattered
photon properties, a tractable treatment of the angular dependence in this
formula has been lacking. In this work, within the electric dipole
approximation, we determine the number of fundamental spectra contributing to
the RIXS cross-section for all crystallographic point groups. We then derive a
general expression for the RIXS cross-section of isotropic samples such as
un-textured powders, homogeneous glasses or liquids, explicitly accounting for
the polarization and propagation directions of both the incident and scattered
photons. Simplified forms of the RIXS expressions are subsequently obtained for
most common point groups. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of our
formalism through a case study of uranium 3d4f RIXS.

### Berry Curvature Dipole-induced Non-linear Hall Effect in Oxide Heterostructures

The observation of non-linear Hall effects in time-reversal invariant systems
has established the intriguing role of band topology beyond Berry curvature in
determining transport phenomena. Many of these non-linear responses owe their
origin to the Berry curvature dipole (BCD), which, like the Berry curvature
(monopole), is also an electronic band structure effect, but is routinely
strongly constrained by crystalline symmetries. Here, we propose
non-centrosymmetric transition metal oxide heterostructures as promising
platforms for realizing and tuning BCD-induced non-linear Hall effects.
Specifically, we investigate superlattices of the form
$(\mathrm{Ba(Os,Ir)}\mathrm{O}_3)_n/(\mathrm{BaTiO}_3)_4$ ($n{=}1, 2$),
comprising metallic perovskite layers ($\mathrm{BaOsO_3}$ or
$\mathrm{BaIrO_3}$) sandwiched between insulating ferroelectric
$\mathrm{BaTiO_3}$ (BTO). The ferroelectric distortion in BTO breaks inversion
symmetry of the superlattice, giving rise to a finite BCD with two
symmetry-allowed components of equal magnitude and opposite sign. Our
first-principles calculations demonstrate that the magnitude of the BCD -- and
consequently the nonlinear Hall response -- can be effectively tuned by varying
the number of metallic layers or the choice of the B-site cation in these
$\mathrm{ABO_3}$ perovskites. Since Rashba splitting and ferroelectric
distortion in these systems are readily controllable via an external electric
field or strain, the non-linear Hall response in these materials can be
directly engineered. Our findings establish non-centrosymmetric oxide
perovskite heterostructures as a versatile platform for exploring and
manipulating BCD-driven non-linear transport phenomena.
