- **TL;DR**: 本文研究薄壁管状超导体在瓶颈结构中的拓扑性质，发现了新型的fluxoid孤子，这是一种具有非量子化磁通的新型涡旋，可在瓶颈结构中自由移动。

A thin-walled tubular superconductor develops a quantized fluxoid in the
presence of an axial magnetic field. The fluxoid corresponds to the number of
phase windings of the superconducting order parameter and is topological in
nature. When the tube has a radius variation along the axial direction, forming
a bottleneck structure between sections with different radius, a fluxoid
mismatch can appear depending on the applied magnetic field. The bottleneck
then becomes a topological boundary and is host to topologically protected
solutions for the order parameter, dubbed fluxoid solitons, that are free to
move around bottlenecks with cylindrical symmetry. Fluxoid solitons are a new
type of vortex with non-quantized flux, loosely related to Pearl vortices in
thin superconducting films and fluxons in Corbino Josephson junctions. We
characterize their properties as a function of system parameters using the
self-consistent quasiclassical theory of diffusive superconductors. We consider
both short bottleneck structures and long tapered tubes, where multiple trapped
fluxoid solitons adopt elaborate arrangements dictated by their mutual
repulsion.

- **TL;DR**: 在约150 GPa高压下成功合成新型铋二氢化物Cmcm-BiH₂超导体，在163 GPa时发现Tc约62 K的超导性，这是MH₂型金属二氢化物中的首个超导体。

Metal hydrides MHx with low hydrogen content are not expected to show high-Tc
superconductivity owing to the low hydrogen-derived electronic density of
states at Fermi level and the limited hydrogen contribution to electron-phonon
coupling strength. In this work, we report on the successful synthesis of a
novel bismuth dihydride superconductor, Cmcm-BiH$_2$, at approximately 150 GPa,
and the discovery of superconductivity with Tc about 62 K at 163 GPa, marking
the first instance of superconductor among the MH$_2$-type metal dihydrides.
Cmcm-BiH$_2$ adopts a unique host-guest type structure, in which the Bi atoms
via weak Bi-Bi covalent bonds form a three-dimensional open-channel framework
that encapsulates H$_2$-like molecules as guests, thereby broadening the
structural diversity of hydrides under high pressures. The occurrence of
superconductivity is evidenced by a sharp drop of resistivity to zero and the
characteristic downward shift of Tc under applied magnetic fields. Notably,
Cmcm-BiH$_2$ remains stable down to at least 97 GPa during decompression, with
the calculated lowest pressure for dynamic stability of 10 GPa. In-depth
analysis reveals that the covalent bismuth open-channel structure forms
metallic conduction channels, dominates the electronic states near the Fermi
level, and contributes approximately 51% of the total $lambda$ in Cmcm-BiH$_2$,
distinguishing it from known high-pressure hydride superconductors. These
findings highlight the critical role of non-hydrogen elements in producing
superconductivity and open new avenues for the design and optimization of
high-Tc hydride superconductors.

- **TL;DR**: 研究HgBa2CuO4+δ(Hg1201)在应变下的响应，发现a轴压缩导致b、c轴小幅度膨胀，且c方向Cu-O距离显著增加。同时观察到与二维电荷关联相关的应变诱导漫散射信号，该信号与超导性无关，接近(0.5,0,0)波矢，相关长度约四个晶胞。

We investigate the strain response of underdoped HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+\delta}$
(Hg1201), by synchrotron X-ray diffraction and corresponding simulations of
thermal diffuse scattering. The compression in the crystallographic $a$
direction leads to relatively small expansion in the $b$ and $c$ directions,
with Poisson ratios $\nu_{ba}$=0.16 and $\nu_{ca}$=0.11, respectively. However,
the Cu-O distance in the $c$ direction exhibits a notable 0.9% increase at 1.1%
$a$-axis compression. We further find strain-induced diffuse scattering which
corresponds to a new type of two-dimensional charge correlation. Interestingly,
this signal is insensitive to the onset of superconductivity and instead
corresponds to a short-range, nearly commensurate modulation with a wave vector
close to (0.5, 0, 0) and a correlation length of approximately four unit cells.
It closely resembles the charge order theoretically predicted in the phase
diagram of the spin-liquid model with resonating valence bonds on a square
lattice.

### Tensor-Network study of Ising model on infinite hyperbolic dodecahedral lattice

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种基于张量网络的算法，用于研究无限大双曲晶格上的经典伊辛模型，该晶格由相同的十二面体进行规则3D镶嵌。通过将角转移矩阵重整化群算法从2D推广到3D，在十二面体晶格上发现了连续非临界相变，相变温度约为4.66，临界指数符合平均场普适类。

We propose a tensor-network-based algorithm to study the classical Ising
model on an infinitely large hyperbolic lattice with a regular 3D tesselation
of identical dodecahedra. We reformulate the corner transfer matrix
renormalization group (CTMRG) algorithm from 2D to 3D to reproduce the known
results on the cubic lattice. Consequently, we generalize the CTMRG to the
hyperbolic dodecahedral lattice, which is an infinite-dimensional lattice. We
analyze the spontaneous magnetization, von Neumann entropy, and correlation
length to find a continuous non-critical phase transition on the dodecahedral
lattice. The phase transition temperature is estimated to be $T_{\rm pt}
\approx 4.66$. We find the magnetic critical exponents $\beta= 0.4999$ and
$\delta=3.007$ that confirm the mean-field universality class in accord with
predictions of Monte Carlo and high-temperature series expansions. The
algorithm can be applied to arbitrary multi-state spin models.

### Optimal superconductivity in twisted bilayer WSe$_2$ where the Van Hove singularity crosses half-filling

- **TL;DR**: 本文研究扭曲WSe2双层中位移场和电子相互作用对拓扑配对态形成的影响，发现在范霍夫奇点穿过半填充的小范围位移场内，超导相能够稳定存在。

The recent discovery of unconventional superconductivity has pointed to
twisted WSe$_2$ bilayer as a versatile platform for studying the correlated and
topological phases of matter. Here we analyze the effect of the displacement
field and electron interactions on the formation of a topological paired state
in twisted WSe$_2$. Our approach is based on the effective single band
$t$-$J$-$U$ model supplemented with intersite Coulomb interaction term and
treated within the Gutzwiller approximation. We show that the superconducting
phase is stabilized in a small range of displacement fields where the Van Hove
singularity crosses half-filling, which is in qualitative agreement with recent
experimental data. According to our analysis, such a circumstance comes as a
result of a subtle interplay between the large density of states of the Van
Hove singularity, in combination with the renormalization effects that appear
in the weak-to-moderate correlations regime. The two factors create favorable
conditions for the SC pairing only in a small area of the phase diagram.

### Tensor Renormalization-Group study of the surface critical behavior of a frustrated two-layer Ising model

- **TL;DR**: 研究了受挫双层伊辛模型的表面临界行为，发现Ashkin-Teller模型的表面磁标度维度二重简并被解除，两个不同的表面磁标度维度满足对偶关系x₁ˢ=1/4x₂ˢ

Two replicas of a 2D Ising model are coupled by frustrated spin-spin
interactions. It is known that this inter-layer coupling is marginal and that
the bulk critical behavior belongs to the Ashkin-Teller (AT) universality
class, as the $J_1$-$J_2$ Ising model. In this work, the surface critical
behavior is studied numerically by Tensor Renormalization-Group calculations.
The Bond-Weight Tensor Renormalization Group algorithm is extended to tackle
systems with boundaries. It is observed that the two-fold degeneracy of the
surface magnetic scaling dimension of the AT model is lifted in the frustrated
two-layer Ising model (F2LIM). The splitting is explained by the breaking of
the ${\mathbb Z}_2$-symmetry under spin reversal of a single Ising replica in
the F2LIM. The two distinct surface magnetic scaling dimensions $x_1^s$ and
$x_2^s$ of the F2LIM satisfies a simple duality relation $x_1^s=1/4x_2^s$.

### Landau Polarons as Generators of Quantum-Coherent States

- **TL;DR**: 通过飞秒相干多维光谱技术，在钙钛矿量子点中实时观测到极化子场诱导动力学，揭示了极化子在50-150飞秒时间尺度上延迟凝聚成相干态谱，这些相干态之间的耦合在同一时间尺度上动态演化。

Since Landau's theory, polarons have been understood as quasiparticles in
which charges are dressed by the lattice field, yet decades of transport and
spectroscopic studies have yielded only static indirect renormalizations.
Whether such dressing can dynamically reorganize electronic spectra to generate
new quantum-coherent states has remained unresolved. Here we use femtosecond
coherent multidimensional spectroscopy on size and composition controlled
perovskite quantum dots to track polaronic field-induced dynamics in real time,
revealing their consequences. We observe a delayed condensation into a confined
spectrum of coherent states on 50-150 fs timescales, with couplings between
these states evolving dynamically on the same timescale. The splittings are
robust, exhibit anomalous linear size dependence, exceed single-particle
splittings and manifest at 300 K. A Raman-constrained spin-boson Hamiltonian
captures both the anomalous scaling and dynamical onset, establishing polarons
as generators of coherent manifolds that enable collective quantum phenomena
including superradiance, superfluorescence and superabsorption.

### Floating zone growth of high-purity MgO substrate single crystals

- **TL;DR**: 使用光学浮区法成功生长了直径3.5-5mm、长度达40mm的无裂纹MgO单晶，纯度达到5N，比商用高纯度MgO衬底提高了一个数量级以上。

MgO single crystals with diameters between 3.5 and 5 mm and lengths up to 40
mm were grown by the optical floating zone technique (OFZ). Despite challenging
material properties such as the high melting point of 2825 {\deg}C, very high
evaporation rate and perfect {100} cleaving characteristics, crack-free
crystals were grown at high growth rates exceeding 40 mm/h and at high thermal
gradients. Chemical investigations revealed that the OFZ technique is suitable
for the preparation of substrate crystals with a purity of 5N to facilitate the
development of novel demonstrator devices based on epitaxially grown thin
films. The achieved purity level is improved by more than one order of
magnitude if compared to commercial MgO substrate single crystals graded as
high purity.

### Interpolative separable density fitting on adaptive real space grids

- **TL;DR**: 将插值可分离密度拟合(ISDF)方法推广到自适应实空间网格，用于处理高度局域化的基函数，通过双空间多级核分裂方法求解泊松方程，实现高效的四指标电子排斥积分张量压缩。

We generalize the interpolative separable density fitting (ISDF) method, used
for compressing the four-index electron repulsion integral (ERI) tensor, to
incorporate adaptive real space grids for potentially highly localized
single-particle basis functions. To do so, we employ a fast adaptive algorithm,
the recently-introduced dual-space multilevel kernel-splitting method, to solve
the Poisson equation for the ISDF auxiliary basis functions. The adaptive grids
are generated using a high-order accurate, black-box procedure that satisfies a
user-specified error tolerance. Our algorithm relies on the observation, which
we prove, that an adaptive grid resolving the pair densities appearing in the
ERI tensor can be straightforwardly constructed from one that resolves the
single-particle basis functions, with the number of required grid points
differing only by a constant factor. We find that the ISDF compression
efficiency for the ERI tensor with highly localized basis sets is comparable to
that for smoother basis sets compatible with uniform grids. To demonstrate the
performance of our procedure, we consider several molecular systems with
all-electron basis sets which are intractable using uniform grid-based methods.
Our work establishes a pathway for scalable many-body electronic structure
simulations with arbitrary smooth basis functions, making simulations of
phenomena like core-level excitations feasible on a large scale.

### A Universal Chern Model on Arbitrary Triangulations

Given a triangulation of a closed orientable surface, we consider the lattice
with sites at the vertices, edges and facets of the triangulation. Borrowing
from mathematics literature, we introduce on this lattice a pair of
tight-binding Hamiltonians derived from the boundary and Poincar\'e duality
maps of finite simplicial manifolds. These Hamiltonians have been proved to
have clean topological spectral gaps carrying non-trivial Chern numbers in the
limit of infinite refinement of the triangulation. We confirm this via
numerical simulations, and demonstrate how these models enable topological edge
modes at the surfaces of real-world objects. Furthermore, we describe a
metamaterial whose dynamics reproduces that of the proposed model, thus
bringing the topological metamaterials closer to real-world applications.

### A complex Gaussian representation of continuum wavefunctions respectful of their asymptotic behaviour

- **TL;DR**: 开发了优化复高斯基组的方法，用于精确表示整个空间中的连续径向波函数，包括直接优化方法和间接拟合法。

Complex Gaussian basis sets are optimized to accurately represent continuum
radial wavefunctions over the whole space. First, attention is put on the
technical ability of the optimization method to get more flexible series of
Gaussian exponents, in order to improve the accuracy of the fitting approach.
Second, an indirect fitting method is proposed, allowing for the oscillatory
behaviour of continuum functions to be conserved up to infinity as a factorized
asymptotic function, while the Gaussian representation is applied to some
appropriately defined distortion factor with limited spatial extension. As an
illustration, the method is applied to radial Coulomb functions with realistic
energy parameters. We also show that the indirect fitting approach keeps the
advantageous analytical structure of typical one-electron transition integrals
occurring in molecular ionization applications.

### ARPES of Bi2212 interpreted via a particle in a system of dynamic scatterers

- **TL;DR**: 使用抛物线柱函数定量分析过掺杂Bi2212在6-140K温度范围内反节点k点的ARPES光谱，发现电子态可视为一维动态散射系统中粒子运动的实现

In this work, I employ parabolic cylinder functions to quantitatively
describe the ARPES spectra of an over-doped Bi2212 across the temperature range
6 - 140K at the antinode k-point. These functions come from the solutions of a
particle moving in a system of random scatterers. The parameters, i.e. the
overall amplitude (A), the spectral coherence scale (C), and the energy shift
(EG), are determined directly by fitting to experimental data. At 140K, the
dominated feature of the ARPES spectrum resembles the solution of a particle
moving in a one-dimensional random system. According to the present model, the
electronic states of the over-doped Bi2212 at the antinode k-point can be
viewed as a realization of the theory of a particle moving in dynamic
scatterers in 1D with corrections from the ground state solutions at lower
temperature.

### Faradaic and capacitive charging of an electrolyte-filled pore in response to a small applied potential

- **TL;DR**: 该论文通过渐近分析研究了电化学装置中法拉第反应和双电层形成的耦合过程，提出了一个扩展的法拉第传输线模型，并推导出零电荷电位的表达式。

Electrochemical devices often charge both through Faradaic reactions and
electric double layer formation. Here, we study these coupled processes in a
model system of a long electrolyte-filled pore subject to a small
suddenly-applied potential, close to the equilibrium potential $\Psi^\text{eq}$
at which there is no net Faradaic charge transfer. Specifically, we solve the
coupled Poisson-Nernst-Planck and Frumkin-Butler-Volmer equations by asymptotic
approximations, using the pore's small inverse aspect ratio as the small
parameter. In the early-time limit, the reaction-diffusion equations yield an
extended Faradaic transmission line model that includes a voltage source,
$\Psi_\text{eq}$, biasing the Faradaic reactions, captured by the resistance
$R_F$. In the long-time limit, the model exhibits a nontrivial potential of
zero charge, $\Psi_\text{pzc} = \Psi_\text{eq}[1 - \hat{Z}(0)/R_F]$, where
$\hat{Z}(0)$ is the experimentally accessible zero-frequency impedance of the
system. This expression provides a new means to experimentally measure the
Faradaic contribution to $\Psi_\text{pzc}$.

### Characterizing Neon Thin Film Growth with an NbTiN Superconducting Resonator Array

- **TL;DR**: 使用超导微波谐振器阵列监测固态氖薄膜的生长均匀性，通过退火处理改善薄膜均匀性，支持电子在惰性量子固体上的量子比特平台开发。

Electrons levitating above the surface of solid neon have recently emerged as
a promising platform for high-quality qubits. The morphology and uniformity of
the neon growth in these systems is crucial for qubit performance in a scalable
architecture. Here we report on the controlled growth and characterization of
thin solid neon films using multiplexed superconducting microwave resonators.
By monitoring changes in the resonant frequency and internal quality factor
($Q_i$) of an array of frequency multiplexed quarter-wave coplanar waveguide
resonators, we quantify the spatial uniformity of the film. A pulsed gas
deposition protocol near the neon triple point results in repeatable film
formation, generating measurable shifts in frequency and variations in $Q_i$
across the resonator array. Notably, introducing a post-deposition anneal at 12
K for one hour improves the film homogeneity, as shown by the reduced
resonator-to-resonator variance in frequency and $Q_i$, consistent with
enhanced wetting. These results demonstrate resonator-based metrology as an
in-situ tool for characterising neon film growth, directly supporting the
development of electron on inert quantum solid qubit platforms.

### Multistability of interstitial magnesium and its carrier recombined migration in gallium nitride

- **TL;DR**: 通过密度泛函理论计算揭示了GaN中Mg间隙原子在载流子复合作用下的迁移机制，发现电子捕获能显著降低迁移能垒。

We present density-functional-theory calculations which provide a microscopic
picture of the recombination-enhanced migration of interstitial Mg in GaN. We
determine stable structures and migration pathways with accurate HSE
approximation to the exchange-correlation energy, and also computed
recombination rates using the obtained energy spectrum and wavefunctions. It is
found that the migration between the most stable octahedral sites
(Mg$_{\textrm{O}}$) via newly found interstitial complex structure shows the
lowest migration energy in which one or two electrons are captured during the
migration, that the most stable charge state of 2+ changes to 1+ or neutral,
and that by this recombination of carriers the migration barrier is
significantly reduced. Starting from Mg$_{\textrm{O}}^{2+}$, Mg captures an
electron becoming the 1+ charge state and overcomes the barrier of 1.65 eV,
much reduced from 2.23 eV in case of the migration with the 2+ charge state
kept. Moreover, further electron capture is realized accompanied by substantial
structural relaxation, thus Mg becoming neutral. Detailed HSE calculations for
this second capture show that the migration barrier is 1.55 eV, thus clarifying
the important role of the carrier recombination for Mg migration in GaN. These
findings are corroborated by the present quantitative calculations of
recombination rates based on electronic Hamiltonian constructed from our
DFT-obtained energy spectrum. The timescale of the recombination is clarified
to be in or under the timescale of the migration with typical electron density
and the enhancement is expected to be significant.

### Phase-Field/Discontinuity Capturing operator for direct van der Waals simulation (DVS)

- **TL;DR**: 提出了相场/间断捕捉(PF/DC)算子，解决了经典DC算子在直接范德华模拟中违反自由能耗散定律的问题，并在三维钝体空化流动模拟中取得优异结果。

Discontinuity capturing (DC) operators are commonly employed to numerically
solve problems involving sharp gradients in the solution. Despite their
success, the application of DC operators to the direct van der Waals simulation
(DVS) remains challenging. The DVS framework models non-equilibrium phase
transitions by admitting interfacial regions in which the derivative of
pressure with respect to density is negative. In these regions, we demonstrate
that classical DC operators may violate the free energy dissipation law and
produce unphysical wave structures. To address this limitation, we propose the
phase-field/discontinuity capturing (PF/DC) operator. Numerical results show
that PF/DC yields stable and accurate solutions in both bulk fluids and
interfacial regions. Finally, we apply the proposed method to simulate
cavitating flow over a three-dimensional bluff body, obtaining excellent
agreement with experimental data and significant improvements over results
produced using classical DC operators.

### $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theories: fermionic gauging, transmutation, and Kramers-Wannier dualities

We generalize the gauging of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetries by inserting Majorana
fermions, establishing parallel duality correspondences for bosonic and
fermionic lattice systems. Using this fermionic gauging, we construct fermionic
analogs of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theories dual to the transverse-field Ising
model, interpretable as Majorana stabilizer codes. We demonstrate a unitary
equivalence between the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory obtained by gauging the
fermion parity of a free fermionic system and the conventional $\mathbb{Z}_2$
gauge theory with potentially nonlocal terms on the square lattice with
toroidal geometry. This equivalence is implemented by a linear-depth local
unitary circuit, connecting the bosonic and fermionic toric codes through a
direction-dependent anyonic transmutation. The gauge theory obtained by gauging
fermion parity is further shown to be equivalent to a folded Ising chain
obtained via the Jordan--Wigner transformation. We clarify the distinction
between the recently proposed Kramers--Wannier dualities and those obtained by
gauging the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry along a space-covering path. Our results
extend naturally to higher-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theories,
providing a unified framework for bosonic and fermionic dualities and offering
new insights for quantum computation and simulation.

Estimating reaction rates and chemical stability is fundamental, yet
efficient methods for large-scale simulations remain out of reach despite
advances in modeling and exascale computing. Direct simulation is limited by
short timescales; machine-learned potentials require large data sets and
struggle with transition state regions essential for reaction rates. Reaction
network exploration with sufficient accuracy is hampered by the computational
cost of electronic structure calculations, and even simplifications like
harmonic transition state theory rely on prohibitively expensive saddle point
searches. Surrogate model-based acceleration has been promising but hampered by
overhead and numerical instability.
  This dissertation presents a holistic solution, co-designing physical
representations, statistical models, and systems architecture in the Optimal
Transport Gaussian Process (OT-GP) framework. Using physics-aware optimal
transport metrics, OT-GP creates compact, chemically relevant surrogates of the
potential energy surface, underpinned by statistically robust sampling.
Alongside EON software rewrites for long timescale simulations, we introduce
reinforcement learning approaches for both minimum-mode following (when the
final state is unknown) and nudged elastic band methods (when endpoints are
specified). Collectively, these advances establish a representation-first,
modular approach to chemical kinetics simulation. Large-scale benchmarks and
Bayesian hierarchical validation demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and
practical exploration of chemical kinetics, transforming a longstanding
theoretical promise into a working engine for discovery.

- **TL;DR**: 本文提出使用Koopman模态分解方法，将非线性动力学中的热力学耗散分解为各振荡模态的贡献，揭示了耗散与频率平方和模态强度成正比的关系。

Nonlinear oscillations are commonly observed in complex systems far from
equilibrium, such as living organisms. These oscillations are essential for
sustaining vital processes, like neuronal firing, circadian rhythms, and
heartbeats. In such systems, thermodynamic dissipation is necessary to maintain
oscillations against noise. However, due to their nonlinear dynamics, it has
been challenging to determine how the characteristics of oscillations, such as
frequency, amplitude, and coherent patterns across elements, influence
dissipation. To resolve this issue, we employ Koopman mode decomposition, which
recasts nonlinear dynamics as a linear evolution in a function space. This
linearization allows the dynamics to be decomposed into temporal oscillatory
modes coherent across elements, with the Koopman eigenvalues determining their
frequencies. Using this method, we decompose thermodynamic dissipation caused
by nonconservative forces into contributions from oscillatory modes in
overdamped nonlinear Langevin dynamics. We show that the dissipation from each
mode is proportional to its frequency squared and its intensity, providing an
interpretable, mode-by-mode picture. In the noisy FitzHugh--Nagumo model, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework in quantifying the impact of
oscillatory modes on dissipation during nonlinear phenomena like stochastic
resonance and bifurcation. For instance, our analysis of stochastic resonance
reveals that the greatest dissipation at the optimal noise intensity is
supported by a broad spectrum of frequencies, whereas at non-optimal noise
levels, dissipation is dominated by specific frequency modes. Our work offers a
general approach to connecting oscillations to dissipation in noisy
environments and improves our understanding of diverse oscillation phenomena
from a nonequilibrium thermodynamic perspective.

### The spinterface mechanism for the chiral-induced spin selectivity effect: A Critical Perspective

- **TL;DR**: 本文探讨了手性诱导自旋选择性(CISS)效应的spinterface机制，认为手性分子与表面磁性之间的反馈相互作用可以统一解释CISS现象，并与现有理论模型进行对比。

The chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect, whereby chiral molecules
preferentially transmit electrons of one spin orientation, remains one of the
most intriguing and debated phenomena at the interface of spintronics,
molecular electronics, and quantum materials. Despite extensive experimental
observations across diverse platforms - including transport junctions,
photoemission, and enantioselective chemistry - a comprehensive theoretical
framework is still lacking. In this perspective, we critically examine the
spinterface mechanism as a unifying explanation for the CISS effect. The
spinterface model, which hypothesizes a feedback interaction between electron
motion in chiral molecules and fluctuating surface magnetic moments, is shown
to quantitatively reproduce experimental data across various systems and
conditions. We contrast it with some existing theoretical models, highlighting
key experimental features. Importantly, we also address open questions and
criticisms of this model, including the nature of surface magnetism, the role
of dissipation, and the applicability of the mechanism to non-helical or
electrode-free systems. By offering falsifiable predictions and reconciling
theory with experimental raw data, this work aims to sharpen the dialogue
surrounding the microscopic origin of CISS and stimulate further experimental
and theoretical progress.

### Temperature-Dependent Spectroscopy of Cr3+:YGG Nanophosphors with Multisite Emission

- **TL;DR**: Cr3+:YGG纳米晶的发光性质随Cr3+浓度变化，低温下发射光谱红移，室温下光谱形状相似，归因于能量转移链过程。

An important feature of Cr3+ is the ability to tune the absorption and
emission spectra by changing the host. However, in some cases, different
emission spectra can be detected in samples with similar Racah parameters. The
present paper reports changes in the luminescence properties of Cr3+:YGG
nanocrystals. Cr3+:YGG nanocrystals were synthesized by a modified Pechini
method to obtain nanocrystals containing two fractions of Cr3+:YGG nanocrystals
with different lattice parameters and crystalline sizes. The increase in the
concentration of Cr3+ ions leads to a redshift of the 4T2g emission from 750 nm
to 850 nm for luminescence spectra measured at 80K. In contrast, room
temperature luminescence spectra showed similarity in the shape of the emission
spectra. The calculated crystal field strength was found to increase with the
concentration of Cr3+ ions, so the detected patterns in low-temperature
luminescence spectra were explained by energy transfer chain processes.

### Fast adaptive discontinuous basis sets for electronic structure

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种基于间断伽辽金方法的自适应基组框架，用于电子结构计算，支持原子中心基组和多项式基组的灵活组合，具有良好的数值条件和结构化稀疏性。

We develop a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) framework for automatically
constructing adaptive basis sets for electronic structure calculations. By
allowing basis functions to be discontinuous across element interfaces, our
approach supports flexible combinations of atom-centered and polynomial basis
sets, maintains favorable numerical conditioning, and induces structured
sparsity of the one- and two-electron integrals, which we compute using
specialised numerical integration strategies. We also introduce
multigrid-preconditioned Poisson solvers that enable fast algorithms for both
Hartree-Fock (HF) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations within our
DG basis sets. Moreover, these basis sets naturally support adaptive multigrid
preconditioning for the linear eigensolvers employed within the self-consistent
field iteration for HF and DFT. Numerical experiments for HF and DFT
demonstrate that our approach achieves chemical accuracy with modest basis
sizes that compare favorably to the sizes of ordinary GTO basis sets achieving
similar accuracy, while offering additional structured sparsity and improved
computational scalability in the size-extensive limit. The framework thus
provides a flexible route toward the construction of systematically improvable
and structured adaptive basis sets for electronic structure theory.

### The generic Mott transition in the sine-Gordon model through an embedded worm algorithm

The generic Mott transition in one-dimensional quantum systems can be
described by the sine-Gordon model with a tilt via bosonization. Because the
configuration space of the sine-Gordon model separates into distinct
topological sectors, standard local Monte Carlo schemes are limited to very
small system sizes. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the smooth worm
(SmoWo) Monte Carlo algorithm which enlarges the configuration space to allow
smooth transitions between topological sectors. The method combines worm
updates with event-chain Monte Carlo moves. We explicitly prove its validity
and quantify its performance. Thanks to the substantial acceleration achieved
by the SmoWo algorithm, we are able to simulate large system sizes, providing a
precise picture of the different phases and critical behaviour of the
sine-Gordon model.

### Beyond Poisson: First-Passage Asymptotics of Renewal Shot Noise

- **TL;DR**: 提出了首个适用于具有一般到达统计特性的更新散粒噪声的平均首次通过时间（FPT）的通用渐近公式，突破了长期以来仅限于泊松情况的限制。

The first-passage time (FPT) of a stochastic signal to a threshold is a
fundamental observable across physics, biology, and finance. While renewal shot
noise is a canonical model for such signals, analytical results for its FPT
have remained confined to the Poisson (Markovian) case, despite the prevalence
of non-Poisson arrival statistics in applications from neuronal spiking to gene
expression. We break this long-standing barrier by deriving the first universal
asymptotic formula for the mean FPT $\langle T_b \rangle$ to reach level $b$
for renewal shot noise with general arrival statistics and exponential marks.
Our central result is a closed-form expression that reveals precisely how
general inter-arrival statistics impact the naive Arrhenius law. We show that
the short-time behavior of the interarrival distribution dictates universal
scaling corrections, ranging from stretched-exponential to algebraic, that can
dramatically accelerate threshold crossing. Furthermore, we argue and confirm
numerically that the full FPT distribution becomes exponential at large
thresholds, implying that $\langle T_b \rangle$ provides a complete asymptotic
characterization. Our work, enabled by a novel exact solution for the moments
of the noise, establishes a general framework for analyzing extreme events in
non-Markovian systems with relaxation.

### One-dimensional moiré engineering in zigzag graphene nanoribbons on hBN

- **TL;DR**: 研究一维石墨烯纳米带/六方氮化硼异质结的结构弛豫和电子性质，发现扭曲角导致波纹形变和畴结构，产生可调控的一维量子限制电子态。

We study the structural relaxation and electronic properties of a
one-dimensional (1D) moir\'e system composed of a zigzag graphene nanoribbon
(GNR) placed on a hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) substrate. Using an effective
grid model derived from continuum elasticity theory, we calculate the relaxed
atomic structure of the GNR/hBN system for various twist angles and ribbon
widths. The relaxation gives rise to a characteristic 1D domain structure
consisting of alternating commensurate AB$'$ regions and two distinct types of
domain boundaries. At finite twist angles, the ribbon adopts a wavy shape,
locally tracing the hBN zigzag direction but occasionally sliding to adjacent
atomic rows. The resulting moir\'e potential strongly modulates the electronic
structure: the zero-energy zigzag edge states are modulated by the local
stacking, leading to densely packed subbands in the AB$'$ domains and sharply
localized domain-wall states in the energy gaps between domain plateaus, which
together realize gate-tunable one-dimensional arrays of quantum-confined
electronic states. Our results demonstrate that moir\'e modulation in GNR/hBN
heterostructures provides a versatile platform for electronic structure
engineering and the design of 1D moir\'e nanodevices.

Developing efficient Er3+,Yb3+:YAG eye-safe lasers is a priority of modern
laser technology. This paper focuses on the influence of the concentration of
Yb3+ ions on the spectroscopic properties of Er3+,Yb3+:YAG transparent
ceramics. Four samples with different concentrations of Yb3+ ions were prepared
by solid-state reaction sintering. The study revealed the influence of Yb3+
ions on the microstructure and the sintering process. A high concentration of
Yb3+ ions leads to the formation of Y3+-rich impurity phases and causes
segregation of Er3+ and Yb3+ and Si4+ into these phases. The influence of Yb3+
ions on the shape of emission spectra and the lifetimes of both Er3+ and Yb3+
ions was shown. Changes in the spectroscopic properties were ascribed to
increase in neat transfer between Yb3+ and Er3+ ions. IQE of Er3+ and Yb3+
luminescence were calculated, and optimal Er3+/Yb3+ ions ratio were proposed

- **TL;DR**: 通过光热离子空穴注入实现超快金属-绝缘体转变，在WS2/WSe2和WSe2/WSe2莫尔器件中观察到亚稳态相关绝缘体

Photoexcitation has been utilized to control quantum matter and to uncover
metastable phases far from equilibrium. Among demonstrations to date, the most
common is the photo-induced transition from correlated insulators to metallic
states; however, the reverse process without initial orders has not been
observed. Here, we show ultrafast metal-to-insulator transition in gate-doped
WS2/WSe2 and WSe2/WSe2 moir\'e devices using photo-thermionic hole injection
from graphite gates. The resulting correlated insulators are metastable, with
lifetimes exceeding microseconds. These findings establish an effective
mechanism for the ultrafast control of correlated electronic phases in van der
Waals heterostructures.

Precise probe and control of various quantum degrees of freedom in novel
quantum matter are central to understanding fundamental quantum physics and
hold promise for innovative routes to encode and process information. Chirality
is one such degree of freedom that has recently attracted intense research
interest, especially for Weyl fermions in topological Weyl semimetals. The
coupling of chiral degrees of freedom through light-matter interactions and the
versatile control of these couplings through external fields can lead to
precise quantum control of Weyl fermions. In this work, we demonstrate the
observation of light chirality-dependent photocurrent in the mid-infrared
regime. Excitation wavelength-dependent measurements reveal that the
photocurrent originates from the injection of chiral polarized Weyl fermions by
chiral polarized mid-infrared photons. The optical process that generates
unbalanced chiral polarized Weyl fermions is determined to be a third-order
nonlinear photocurrent process. Compared with nonmagnetic Weyl semimetals, such
coupling is versatilely tunable in magnetic Weyl semimetals with the
magnetization direction and external electric field in addition to the
chirality of light. Our results are not only directly applicable to tunable
circular-polarization-sensitive photodetection in the mid-infrared regime, but
also pave the way toward functional quantum devices that utilize the chiral
quantum degrees of freedom of Weyl fermions.

Non-Hermitian physics characterized by complex band spectra has established a
new paradigm in condensed matter systems and metamaterials. Recently,
non-Hermitian gain and nonreciprocity are deliberately introduced to valley
manipulation, leading to various phenomena beyond the Hermitian scenarios, such
as the amplified topological whispering gallery modes as an acoustic laser. In
contrast, pure loss is inevitable in practice and generally regarded as a
detrimental factor. Here, we reveal that the coupling loss can manipulate
valley degrees of freedom in a phononic metamaterial. Three distinct
valley-related effects, including valley-resolved nonreciprocity that functions
as a valley filter, valley-dependent skin effects where bulk states from
different valleys localize at opposite boundaries, and valley-projected edge
states with boundary-dependent lifetimes that leads to an anomalous beam
splitting, are demonstrated through theoretical analysis and airborne sound
experiments. Owing to the easy preparation of loss, our findings shed light on
both non-Hermitian and valley physics and may facilitate innovative
applications of valley-related devices.

### Optimal spin-charge interconversion in graphene through spin-pseudospin entanglement control

The electrical generation of spin signals is of central interest for
spintronics, where graphene stands as a relevant platform as its spin-orbit
coupling (SOC) is tuned by proximity effects. Here, we propose an enhancement
of spin-charge interconversion in graphene by controlling the intraparticle
entanglement between the spin and pseudospin degrees of freedom. We demonstrate
that, although the spin alone is not conserved in Rashba-Dirac systems, a
combined spin-pseudospin operator is conserved. This conserved quantity
represents the interconversion between pure spin and pseudospin textures to a
spin-pseudospin entangled structure, where Kane-Mele SOC tunes this balance. By
these means, we achieve spin-charge interconversion of 100\% efficiency via the
Rashba-Edelstein effect. Quantum transport simulations in disordered
micron-size systems demonstrate the robustness of this effect, and also reveal
a disorder resilient spin Hall effect generated by the interplay between Rashba
and Kane-Mele SOC. Our findings propose a platform for maximally efficient
spin-charge interconversion, and establish spin-pseudospin correlations as a
mechanism to tailor spintronic devices.

Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures of two-dimensional (2D) materials have
become a rich playground for the exploration of correlated quantum phases, and
recent studies have begun to probe their non-equilibrium dynamics under
femtosecond laser excitation. In a time-resolved experiment, optical excitation
of the multilayer structure can lead not only to rich dynamic responses from
the target layers, such as moir\'e interfaces, but also to additional device
functionality from the layer degree of freedom. Here, we investigate optical
excitation in a prototypical moir\'e device of dual-gated twisted WSe2
bilayers, with few-layer graphite gates and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN)
spacers. We establish an ultrafast photodoping mechanism in the moir\'e bilayer
from photo-thermionic emission of the graphite gates. Using transient
reflectance experiments, we reveal photo-induced hole injection evidenced by:
(i) a shift of gate voltages at which optical signatures of correlated
insulators are observed, (ii) a persistent optical signature indicative of
charge diffusion at microsecond timescales and local charge buildup from
pulse-to-pulse accumulation, and (iii) photoinduced absorption due likely to
transient formation of correlated insulators. We further demonstrate that the
injected holes can be selectively controlled by tuning the excitation energy,
fluence, and gate bias.

Semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), such as MoSe$_2$ and
WSe$_2$, exhibit unique optical and electronic properties. Vertical stacking of
layers of one or more TMDs, to create heterostructures, has expanded the fields
of moir\'e physics and twistronics. Bottom-up fabrication techniques, such as
chemical vapor deposition, have advanced the creation of heterostructures
beyond what was possible with mechanical exfoliation and stacking. These
techniques now enable the fabrication of lateral heterostructures, where two or
more monolayers are covalently bonded in the plane of their atoms. At their
atomically sharp interfaces, lateral heterostructures exhibit additional
phenomena, such as the formation of charge-transfer excitons, in which the
electron and hole reside on opposite sides of the interface. Due to the energy
landscape created by differences in the band structures of the constituent
materials, unique effects such as unidirectional exciton transport and
excitonic lensing can be observed in lateral heterostructures. This review
outlines recent progress in exciton dynamics and spectroscopy of TMD-based
lateral heterostructures and offers an outlook on future developments in
excitonics in this promising system.

We investigated electron-nuclear spin entanglement in the paramagnetic ground
state of the Ho-based cubic compound HoCo2Zn20. From analyses of magnetization
and specific heat data, we determined the cubic crystalline electric field
(CEF) parameters, the magnetic exchange constant, and the hyperfine coupling
constant between the 4f magnetic moment and the 165Ho nuclear spin. Our results
show that the Gamma5 CEF ground state is split by the hyperfine coupling, with
an energy width of 1.3 K at 0 T, and that the true paramagnetic ground state is
a quasi-sextet arising primarily from entanglement between the f-electron
effective spin S = 1 and the 165Ho nuclear spin I = 7/2. We further demonstrate
that, depending on the CEF parameters, the paramagnetic ground state can switch
to an electron-nuclear coupled dectet. These findings underscore the importance
of accurately identifying the electron-nuclear level scheme for understanding
the low-temperature properties of rare-earth compounds containing spin-active
nuclei.

the obtained experimental data on the spin-Hall effect, an assessment of the
spin-orbit interaction in the studied paramagnets was made.

Altermagnets are a recently-discovered class of materials with magnetic
ordering that have a zero net magnetization and a momentum-dependent spin
splitting in their band structure, arising from a collinear spin arrangement
with alternating polarizations in the crystal lattice. The nickeline-structured
manganese telluride ({\alpha}-MnTe) is an attractive altermagnet candidate due
to its predicted large spin splitting energy and a transition temperature near
300K. In this work, we present a thorough investigation of the spin structure
of {\alpha}-MnTe thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy with very high
crystal quality and low residual magnetization. The epitaxial {\alpha}-MnTe
films have a full-width-at-half-maximum of 0.1{\deg} as measured by
x-ray-diffraction rocking curves and a root-mean-square roughness below 1 nm.
Neutron diffraction measurements confirm the antiferromagnetic order in the
{\alpha}-MnTe film and show a N\'eel temperature of 307 K. Polarized neutron
reflectometry detects a vanishingly small net magnetization which may be
confined to the MnTe/InP interface, highlighting the near-ideal stoichiometry
in the sample. In vacuo angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy reveals that
the bulk band spectrum of the MnTe films is consistent with the weak
altermagnetic order as theoretically predicted and observed for the high
symmetry nodal plane in the center of the Brillouin zone. This study
establishes optimized growth conditions for the synthesis of stoichiometric
{\alpha}-MnTe thin films which exhibit exceptional structural and magnetic
ordering, thereby providing a robust platform for the precise characterization
of their altermagnetic properties.

The Hubbard model on the Kagome lattice is a widely used interacting model
for describing the electronic properties of various transition metal-based
Kagome materials. We find altermagnetism driven by Coulomb interaction in the
Kagome Hubbard model at Dirac filling with no spin-orbit coupling nor explicit
spatial symmetry breaking present. We show how this insulating altermagnet is
relevant to other lattices with larger unit cells such as the Lieb-Kagome
lattice. The ALM found displays a characteristic magnon splitting which can be
detected in inelastic neutron scattering experiments on interacting Kagome
materials.

### Controlling bubble and skyrmion lattice order and dynamics via stripe domain engineering in ferrimagnetic Fe/Gd multilayers

Ferrimagnetic Fe/Gd multilayers host maze-like stripe domains that transform
into a disordered bubble/skyrmion lattice under out-of-plane magnetic fields at
ambient temperature. Femtosecond magneto-optics distinguishes these textures
via their distinct coherent breathing dynamics. Crucially, applying a brief
in-plane ``set'' magnetic field to the stripe state enhances both frequency and
amplitude of the bubble/skyrmion lattice breathing mode. Lorentz transmission
electron microscopy, magnetic force microscopy, and micromagnetic simulations
reveal that this enhancement arises from field-aligned stripes nucleating a
dense, near-hexagonal bubble/skyrmion lattice upon out-of-plane field
application, with strong indications for a pure skyrmion lattice. Thus,
modifying the initial domain configuration by in-plane fields enables precise
control of coherent magnetization dynamics on picosecond to nanosecond
timescales and potentially even of topology.

### Hexagonal InOI monolayer: a 2D phase-change material combining topological insulator states and piezoelectricity

- **TL;DR**: 提出六方InOI单层作为有前景的二维相变材料，具有适中的相变能垒和可逆切换特性，应变工程可调控电子相变类型，相变还能调节压电响应和光学吸收范围。

Two-dimensional (2D) phase-change materials (PCMs) with moderate transition
barriers and distinctly contrasting properties are highly desirable for
multifunctional devices, yet such systems remain scarce. Using first-principles
calculations, we propose a hexagonal InOI monolayer as a promising 2D PCM. This
material exhibits two distinct polymorphs: an energetically favorable
T$^{\prime}$ phase and a metastable T phase, differentiated by iodine atom
positions. The T$^{\prime}$-to-T structural phase transition features a
moderate energy barrier $E_b$ of 72.1 meV per formula unit, facilitating
reversible switching. Notably, strain engineering tailors the electronic
transition, inducing either a metal-to-topological-insulator or a
metal-to-normal-insulator transformation. Additionally, this phase transition
modulates the piezoelectric response and shifts optical absorption from the
infrared to the visible range. These multifunctional properties make 2D
hexagonal InOI highly promising for applications in non-volatile memory,
low-contact-resistance spintronics, and optical switching devices.

An indispensable step toward understanding magnetic interaction in rare-earth
magnets is the determination of spatially anisotropic single-ion properties
resulting from the crystal electric field (CEF) physics. The CEF Hamiltonian
exhibits a discrete energy spectrum governed by a set of independent parameters
that reflect the site symmetry of the magnetic ion. However, experimentally
determining these parameters for magnetic ions at low-symmetry sites has been
proven highly challenging. In this study, we directly measured the CEF level
splitting under magnetic fields (B) using optical spectroscopy and extracted
both CEF parameters and the exchange energies of a triangular insulating magnet
CsErSe$_2$ as a model system. With increasing field, we find many CEF levels
undergo level-crossing, which accompanies switching of the eigenstate.
Particularly, such a crossing occurring at the ground state results in a
step-like increase in magnetization that we captured with the low-temperature
AC magnetic susceptibility measurements. Our work demonstrates that the
accurately determined CEF Hamiltonian parameters enable uncovering the rich
physics of field-induced collective magnetic phenomena, and potentially lead to
a new route to magnetic frustration.

Through systematic experimental and theoretical studies of
layer-thickness-dependent absorption in semiconducting MoSe$_2$ and WS$_2$
across the visible to near-infrared spectral range, we demonstrate a universal
absorption behavior in solids at nanoscale thicknesses. With increasing
thickness, a non-monotonic evolution of absorption integrated over the measured
spectral region is revealed which is accompanied by pronounced oscillatory
features. This strongly deviates from the expected Beer-Lambert law. The
observed behavior has origins in the electromagnetic interference effects
taking place between the two surfaces of the thin crystals. The present work on
2D semiconductors is extendable to all kinds of solids such as conventional
semiconductors (e.g. Si, GaAs, GaN, InP), (semi)metals (e.g. Al, Ag, Au,
c-HOPG) and 2D magnetic materials (e.g. CrSBr and NiPS$_3$). Our results
provide fundamental insights into light-matter interactions in solids at the
nanoscale and are vital for optimally designing the new generation of
absorption-based flexible optoelectronic devices.

### Zeeman Spectroscopy of Vacancy-Charge-Compensated Er3+ Sites in CaWO4 under Vector Magnetic Fields

We present polarization-resolved optical absorption measurements on Er3+ ions
in CaWO4 under vector magnetic fields, focusing on charge-compensated sites
arising from local Ca2+ vacancies. While the known axial Er3+ site displays a
single symmetric Zeeman-split transition pattern consistent with S4 symmetry,
two additional sites exhibit more complex spectral behavior, including sets of
transitions that interchange under 90{\deg} crystal rotations-evidence of
reduced, rhombic-like symmetry. From these polarization- and
temperature-dependent spectra, we extract effective g-factors. Our findings are
corroborated by electron paramagnetic resonance measurements and support a
model of multiple inequivalent Ca2+ vacancies around Er3+ sites in the host
lattice. This detailed characterization contributes to understanding
defect-engineered rare-earth sites for quantum information applications.

### Spin filtering on demand via localized states in an atomic-scale resonant tunneling magnetic tunnel junction

Spin filtering and its back-action spin transfer torque (STT) are key
ingredients of latest spintronic devices based on magnetic tunnel junctions
(MTJs). Resonant tunneling (RT), implemented by design or occurring as
parasitic effects, is known to crucially affect macroscopic device performance,
but direct experimental access to its individual microscopic processes has
remained difficult. Here we apply the RT scheme from MTJs to spin-polarized
scanning tunneling microscopy (SP-STM) for ultimate miniaturization obtained by
addressing distinct sites on individual nanomagnets. Combined with energy
selectivity, our experimental model set-up enables to study the spin filtering
capabilities of RT through an individual spin-split vacuum resonance state and
of the corresponding STT exerted on the nanomagnet. We find, that the sign and
magnitude of the STT follow the effective spin-polarization of the resonance
state, which, as we show, can by tailored on demand either by adjusting the
applied bias or the current injection point on the nanostructure. We
anticipate, that our atomic-scale RT-MTJ approach and the discovery of a
versatile tunable spin-filter at smallest scale will prove invaluable for
studying and designing next generation MTJs potentially based on recently
discovered 2D van-der-Waals magnets or altermagnets.

### Tailoring dispersion and evanescent modes in multimodal nonlocal lattices using positive-only interactions

Metamaterials derive their unconventional properties from engineered
microstructures, with periodic lattices providing a versatile framework for
modeling wave propagation. Dispersion relations, obtained from Bloch-Floquet
theory, govern how waves propagate, attenuate, or localize within such systems.
Extending interactions beyond nearest neighbors, through nonlocality,
substantially enriches the design space of band diagrams, enabling phenomena
such as negative or zero group velocities, roton-like extrema, and band-gap
localization. However, existing approaches to dispersion tailoring often rely
on analytical formulations or Fourier-based identifications, which become
impractical for complex coupling mechanisms and offer limited control over
physical constraints such as stiffness positivity. This work introduces a
general interpolation-based framework for customizing dispersion relations in
uniform nonlocal lattices. Rather than reconstructing full dispersion curves,
the method enforces prescribed frequency-wavenumber points as interpolation
constraints, enabling localized and tunable control of wave behavior. The
formulation is applied to both spring- and beam-interaction lattices, and
demonstrated on an Euler-Bernoulli beam model with adjustable nonlocal
couplings. Through systematic parameter tuning, the framework enables the
creation of rotons, the adjustment of group-velocity dispersion, and the design
of evanescent waves with controlled exponential decay within band gaps, all
while ensuring real, positive-only stiffness parameters and passive mechanical
behavior. Altogether, this parametric interpolation strategy provides a
physically consistent and computationally efficient route for engineering
advanced phononic functionalities in periodic nonlocal systems.

Many monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides, including MoS$_2$, MoSe$_2$,
WS$_2$, and WSe$_2$, are direct bandgap two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors
with sharp optical resonances at excitonic bound state frequencies. Recent
experiments have demonstrated that excitonic resonance frequencies in
multilayer van der Waals stacks are altered by long-range Coulomb interactions
with electrons in nearby but electrically isolated 2D materials. These
modulations have been successfully used to detect transitions between distinct
states of remote strongly correlated 2D electron fluids. In this Letter we
provide a theory of these frequency shifts, enabling a more quantitative
interpretation of excitonic-sensing experiments, and apply it as an example to
WSe$_2$ that is proximate to graphene bilayers and multilayers.

### The Piezochiral Effect

Chirality is a pervasive property of matter that underpins many important
phenomena across physics, chemistry and biology. Given its broad significance,
the development of protocols for rational control of chirality in solid state
systems is highly desirable, especially if this effect can be tuned
continuously and in two directions. Yet, this goal has remained elusive due to
the absence of a universal conjugate field that couples linearly to this
structural order. Here, we introduce the piezochiral effect, which enables
control of chirality through mechanical strain. We first show by symmetry
analysis that uniaxial strain induces chirality in a broad class of achiral
crystals that host fragments of opposite chirality within each unit cell, an
effect that has so far remained unrecognized. The strain-induced handedness can
be tuned either by changing the strain direction or by switching between
compressive and tensile strain. We experimentally verify this effect in AgGaS2,
using measurements of the optical activity under strain. Our discovery
establishes a new scheme for chirality control, with potential applications
that range from spintronics to asymmetric catalysis, and enantioselective
interactions in biosystems.
