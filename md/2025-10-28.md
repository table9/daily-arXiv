- **TL;DR**: 该研究通过使用氖气作为压力传输介质，将NV中心的工作压力扩展到近200 GPa，并应用于研究LaH9.6样品的迈斯纳效应，观察到强磁屏蔽效应和显著的磁通捕获现象。

Lanthanum hydride has attracted significant attention in recent years due to
its signatures of superconductivity at around 250 K (1, 2). However, the
megabar pressures required for synthesize and maintain its state present
extraordinary challenges for experiments, particularly in characterizing its
Meissner effect (3, 4). The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond has emerged
as a promising quantum probe to address this problem (5-8), but a gap remains
between its working pressure and the pressure required to study the
superconducting state of lanthanum hydride (9-12). In this work, using neon gas
as the pressure transmitting medium, the working pressure of NV centers is
extended to nearly 200 GPa. This quantum probe is then applied to study the
Meissner effect of a LaH$_{9.6}$ sample, synthesized by laser heating ammonia
borane and lanthanum. A strong magnetic shielding effect is observed, with the
transition temperature beginning at around 180 K and completing at 220 K. In
addition, magnetic field imaging after field cooling reveals strong flux
trapping and significant inhomogeneities within the sample. Our work provides
compelling evidence for superconductivity in lanthanum hydride and highlights
the importance of spatially resolved techniques in characterizing samples under
ultrahigh pressure conditions.

- **TL;DR**: 研究硫取代FeTe化合物的连续退火效应，发现退火过程通过去除过量铁磁杂质改善了超导态在磁场下的电输运性能，提高了上临界场。

Since iron-based superconductors have been discovered, many scientists have
focused on their characteristic properties, such as an unconventional mechanism
and a high upper critical field. Sulphur-substituted FeTe compounds are one of
the members of the iron-based superconductors; however, chemical processes,
such as O$_2$ annealing, are needed to induce superconductivity because of the
existence of excess iron in as-grown crystals. Thus, the removal of excess iron
and the obtaining of clean sulphur-substituted FeTe can play a key role in the
understanding of the superconducting properties and the application to the
superconducting devices. In this study, we present the successive annealing
effects on sulphur-substituted FeTe compounds to investigate the electrical
transport properties under high magnetic fields. Our measurements show that
successive annealing processes improve the electrical transport properties in
the superconducting states under magnetic fields. The removal of excess iron
acting as magnetic impurities is indicated by the improvement of the upper
critical field and its analysis.

The electro-magnetic responses of ordered vortex lattices in unconventional
superconductors
  are studied in a high field approximation. In the cases with a vortex lattice
formed within
  the lowest Landau level of the superconducting order parameter (OP) such as a
conventional
  s-wave paired system with a single OP and a nonchiral spin triplet paired one
with multiple
  components of OPs, the vanishing of the superfluid stiffness for a gauge
field disturbance
  perpendicular to the applied uniform magnetic field is found to be ensured
only for the vortex
  lattice structures minimizing the free energy. The notion of the vanishing
superfluid stiff ness ensured by minimization of the free energy is found to be
satisfied in a more complex
  d-wave pairing case where the vortex lattice in lower fields has an
anisotropic structure de viated from the six-fold hexagonal symmetry.
Interestingly, such an anisotropy in the vortex
  lattice structure of a d-wave paired superconductor is reflected not in the
resulting vortex flow
  conductivities obtained after minimizing the free energy but in the elastic
energy describing
  the harmonic fluctuation around the vortex lattice state. Relevance of the
obtained results to
  the vortex pinning effects are discussed.

### Light induced Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition in Superconducting Films

- **TL;DR**: 该论文报告了在超导体中通过光驱动实现的非平衡涡旋Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) 相变，这是一种独立于热涨落的量子相变。

We report a light-driven non-equilibrium vortex
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition in a superconductor. We use a
time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau model to demonstrate vortex-antivortex
deconfinement via light induced fields. The transformation occurs independently
of thermal fluctuations and is viewed as a quantum phase transition. The
resulting phase map mirrors QCD phase diagram, delineating confined, premelted,
and fully deconfined vortex phases. The nature of these phases is discussed.
Transitions between phases are governed by light induced depairing and phase
fluctuations, establishing a new class of light-induced topological
transitions.

### Tuning laser-induced optical breakdown and cavitation through the ionic environment in aqueous media

- **Categories**: physics.chem-ph, cond-mat.soft
- **TL;DR**: 实验研究了离子强度和离子特异性对水溶液中激光诱导空化的影响，发现增加离子强度会降低空化阈值，但在相同离子强度下，酸性溶液抑制空化而碱性溶液促进空化，这源于水合电子动力学的离子特异性效应。

Laser-induced cavitation in liquids originates from optical breakdown
processes that depend sensitively on both laser-plasma dynamics and the
chemical microenvironment of the solvent. Herein, we experimentally decouple
the effects of ionic strength and ion specificity on cavitation inception in
aqueous electrolytes spanning neutral, acidic, and alkaline regimes. Using
focused nanosecond laser pulses, we show that increasing ionic strength
universally lowers the cavitation threshold by enhancing charge screening and
seed-electron availability. However, under constant ionic strength, strongly
asymmetric behavior emerges: acidic (hydrogen chloride, HCl) solutions inhibit
cavitation, whereas alkaline (sodium hydroxide, NaOH) solutions enhance it.
This asymmetry arises from hydrated-electron kinetics that depends on the ion
specificity. In acidic solutions, hydronium ions act as diffusion-limited
scavengers of hydrated electrons, quenching their lifetime and inhibiting
avalanche ionization. In contrast, hydroxide ions reduce hydronium availability
and extend electron survival, promoting more efficient plasma formation.
Despite large discrepancies in breakdown thresholds, electrical conductivity
remains nearly constant, demonstrating that microscopic electron chemistry,
rather than bulk charge transport, governs cavitation onset. These results
establish a mechanism connection between electrolyte chemistry and optical
breakdown, showing that ion-specific reaction dynamics fundamentally control
laser-induced cavitation in aqueous environments.

### Intertwined Orders, Quantum Criticality and Skyrmions in Tunable Topological Bands
- **arXiv**: [2510.21913](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21913)  ·  [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.21913.pdf)

- **TL;DR**: 该论文研究了可调相互作用陈能带模型中斯格明子激发和量子相变，发现了绝缘体与超导体之间的连续量子相变，具有涌现的SO(5)对称性。

Skyrmions are emergent many-body excitations that lie at the heart of both
multi-component quantum Hall-like systems and deconfined quantum criticality.
In a companion article (X. Wang et al., arXiv:2507.22971), we studied a
microscopic time-reversal symmetric model of tunable interacting Chern bands
using numerically exact determinant quantum Monte Carlo calculations, and
presented evidence for the emergence of robust skyrmion excitations. These
charged excitations emerge in the vicinity of a many-body insulator at a
commensurate filling of the Chern bands, and lead to the onset of
superconductivity when doped away from the insulating phase. Here, we present
quantum Monte-Carlo results and a complementary field-theoretical analysis for
the quantum phase transition(s) that arise between the intertwined phases as a
function of two distinct tuning parameters. Our numerical results are
consistent with a single continuous quantum phase transition between an
insulating Chern antiferromagnet and a fully gapped superconductor, with an
emergent SO(5) symmetry at the putative critical point, highly suggestive of
deconfined quantum (pseudo-)criticality. We also present a detailed comparison
between the momentum-resolved spectral functions associated with the neutral
collective modes, single electron and composite spin-polaron excitations
obtained using a combination of Monte-Carlo computations and a Bethe-Salpeter
analysis built on top of the self-consistent Hartree-Fock calculation. We end
with a brief outlook on some of the interesting open problems.

### Impurity-induced topological decomposition

- **TL;DR**: 在非厄米晶格中，局域杂质可逐步分解全局拓扑性质，每个杂质使绕数减少1，表现为稳态响应中量子化平台的逐步分解。基于此原理，在厄米拓扑系统中可顺序诱导拓扑边缘态。

Controlling topological phases is a central goal in quantum materials and
related fields, enabling applications such as robust transport and programmable
edge states. Here we uncover a mechanism in which local on-site impurities act
as knobs to decompose global topological properties in discrete steps. In
non-Hermitian lattices with spectral winding topology, we show that each
impurity sequentially reduces the winding number by one, which is directly
manifested as a stepwise decomposition of quantized plateaus in the
steady-state response. Based on this principle, we further develop a scheme
that sequentially induces topological edge states under impurity control, in a
class of Hermitian topological systems constructed by doubling the
non-Hermitian ones. Our findings reveal a general scheme to tune global
topological properties with local perturbations, establishing a universal
framework for impurity-controlled topological phases and offering a foundation
for future exploration of reconfigurable topological phenomena across diverse
physical platforms.

### Dynamic Phase Transitions in Mean-Field Ginzburg-Landau Models: Conjugate Fields and Fourier-Mode Scaling
- **arXiv**: [2510.21803](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21803)  ·  [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.21803.pdf)

- **Authors**: Yelyzaveta Satynska, Daniel T. Robb
- **Categories**: cond-mat.stat-mech, physics.comp-ph
- **TL;DR**: 本文研究了周期性驱动平均场铁磁体的动态相变，发现在临界周期P_c处，正确的共轭场是整个偶傅里叶分量部分，而正确的序参量是z_k=√|m_k²-|m_{k,c}|²|。通过高精度极限环积分和傅里叶分析，确认了1/2标度律和1/3临界指数。

Dynamic phase transitions of periodically forced mean-field ferromagnets are
often described by a single order parameter and a scalar conjugate field.
Building from previous work, we show that, at the critical period $P_c$ of the
mean-field Ginzburg-Landau (MFGL) dynamics with energy $F(m)=am^2+bm^4-hm$, the
correct conjugate field is the entire even-Fourier component part of the
applied field. The correct order parameter is
$z_k=\sqrt{\bigl|\,m_k^2-|m_{k,c}|^2\,\bigr|}$, where $m_k$ is the $k^{th}$
Fourier component of the magnetization m(t), and $m_{k,c}$ is the $k^{th}$
Fourier component at the critical period. Using high-accuracy limit-cycle
integration and Fourier analysis, we first confirm that, for periodic fields
that contain only odd components, the symmetry-broken branch below $P_c$
exhibits $z_k \propto \varepsilon^{1/2}$ (computationally tested for modes
$k\le30$), where $\varepsilon=(P_c-P)/P_c$. This provides strong evidence that
the 1/2 scaling holds for all Fourier modes. We then find three robust facts:
(1) Exactly at $P_c$, adding a small perturbation composed of even Fourier
components with an overall field multiplier $h_{mult}$ yields $z_k \propto
h_{mult}^{1/3}$ across many $k$. (2) Mode-resolved deviations obey a parity
rule: $|\delta m_{2n}| \propto h_{mult}^{1/3}$ and $|\delta m_{2n+1}| \propto
h_{mult}^{2/3}$. (3) The same findings persist in MFGL models where an $m^6$
replaces the $m^4$ term and come with simple one-period integral criteria to
locate $P_c$.

### Vertex and front-tracking methods for the modeling of microstructure evolution at the solid state: a brief review

- **TL;DR**: 该论文比较了介观尺度微观结构演化建模中的两种主要数值框架：前沿捕获（FC）和前沿追踪（FT）方法，重点分析了FT方法的优势、挑战和最新进展。

In mesoscopic scale microstructure evolution modeling, two primary numerical
frameworks are used: Front-Capturing (FC) and Front-Tracking (FT) ones. FC
models, like phase-field or level-set methods, indirectly define interfaces by
tracking field variable changes. On the contrary, FT models explicitly define
interfaces using interconnected segments or surfaces. In historical FT
methodologies, Vertex models were first developed and consider the description
of the evolution of polygonal structures in terms of the motion of points where
multiple boundaries meet. Globally, FT-type approaches, often associated with
Lagrangian movement, enhance spatial resolution in 3D surfacic and 2D lineic
problems using techniques derived from finite element meshing and remeshing
algorithms. These efficient approaches, by nature, are well adapted to physical
mechanisms correlated to interface properties and geometries. They also face
challenges in managing complex topological events, especially in 3D. However,
recent advances highlight their potential in computational efficiency and
analysis of mobility and energy properties, with possible applications in
intragranular phenomena.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文展示了利用YBCO纳米器件中的Abrikosov涡旋运动实现太赫兹波交流约瑟夫森功能，在77K温度下观察到Shapiro台阶特征和高次谐波混频效应。

Superconducting materials are a key for technologies enabling a large number
of devices including THz wave mixers and single photon detectors, though
limited at very low temperatures for conventional superconductors. High
temperature operation could in principle be offered using cuprate
superconductors. However, the complexity of the material in thin film form, the
extremely short coherence length and material stability, have hindered the
realization of THz devices working at liquid nitrogen temperatures.
$YBa_2Cu_3O_{7-{\delta}}$ (YBCO) nanodevices have demonstrated non-linear
properties typical of Josephson-like behavior, which have the potential for the
mixing of AC signals in the THz range due to the large superconducting energy
gap. Here, we present AC Josephson functionalities for terahertz waves
utilizing Abrikosov vortex motion in nanoscale-confined fully planar YBCO thin
film bridges. We observe Shapiro step-like features in the current voltage
characteristics when irradiating the device with monochromatic sub-THz waves
(100 GHz to 215 GHz) at 77 K. We further explore these nonlinear effects by
detecting THz high-order harmonic mixing for signals from 200 GHz up to 1.4 THz
using a local oscillator at 100 GHz. Our results open a path to an
easy-fabricated HTS nonlinear nanodevice based on dimensional confinement
suitable for terahertz applications.

### Tracking Microhydration of the NaCl Rocksalt Molecule in Helium Nanodroplets by Penning Ionization Electron Spectroscopy

- **TL;DR**: 使用氦纳米液滴中的高分辨率Penning电离电子光谱研究NaCl分子的微水合作用，发现水分子数量影响NaCl的电离信号和离子对结构转变。

The microhydration of rock salt (NaCl) molecules was investigated using
high-resolution Penning ionization electron spectroscopy (PIES) in helium
nanodroplets. Although model calculations predict that NaCl molecules are fully
submerged inside the droplets, PIES of NaCl are highly resolved, in stark
contrast to other molecular species. Co-doping the droplets with a controlled
number of $n=5$--10 water molecules leads to efficient quenching of the NaCl
Penning ionization signal and to its full suppression for $n\gtrsim 30$.
Accompanying density-functional theory (DFT) and force field calculations
reveal a transition from contact ion pair structures to solvent-separated ion
pairs at $n=12$--15. However, it takes $n\approx 17$ water molecules to form a
complete solvation shell around the Cl$^-$ anion and as many as $n\approx 34$
to fully hydrate the Na$^+$ cation, thus the entire NaCl molecule, which
rationalizes the experimental findings.

### Quantum-inspired space-time PDE solver and dynamic mode decomposition

- **TL;DR**: 该论文研究了量子启发方法在时空偏微分方程求解和动态模式分解预测中的应用，使用矩阵乘积状态编码同时处理空间和时间维度，显著减少了自由度需求并实现了对数级计算复杂度。

Numerical solutions of partial differential equations (PDEs) are central to
the understanding of dynamical systems. Standard approaches involving
time-stepping schemes compute the solution at each time step, which becomes too
costly when simulating long-term dynamics. Alternatively, space-time methods
that treat the combined space-time domain simultaneously promise better
stability and accuracy. Interestingly, data-driven approaches for learning and
predicting dynamics, such as dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), also employ a
combined space-time representation. However, the curse of dimensionality often
limits the practical benefits of space-time methods. In this work, we
investigate quantum-inspired methods for space-time approaches, both for
solving PDEs and for making DMD predictions. We achieve this goal by treating
both spatial and temporal dimensions within a single matrix product state (MPS)
encoding. First, we benchmark our MPS space-time solver for both linear and
nonlinear PDEs, observing that the MPS ansatz accurately captures the
underlying spatio-temporal correlations while having significantly fewer
degrees of freedom. Second, we develop an MPS-DMD algorithm to make accurate
long-term predictions of nonlinear systems, with runtime scaling
logarithmically in both spatial and temporal resolution. This research
highlights the role of tensor networks in developing effective and
interpretable models, bridging the gap between numerical methods and
data-driven approaches.

### Hilbert Space Fragmentation in Hardcore Bose and Fermi Hubbard Models on Generalized Lieb Lattices

We study the Hilbert space fragmentation (HSF) in hardcore Bose and Fermi
Hubbard models in the framework of the restricted spectrum generating algebra
(RSGA). We present a family of hardcore Bose-Hubbard models with repulsive
density-density interactions on a generalized Lieb lattice. We show that this
system possesses the RSGA structure in the large interaction strength limit,
exhibiting quantum HSF. It allows us to construct a set of exact condensate
eigenstates, possessing off diagonal long-range order. Based on numerical
simulations conducted on several representative lattices, we demonstrate the
existence of weak fragmentations when the constraints are not exact. As
applications, we also studied the connection between HSF and RSGA in modified
fermionic Hubbard models, where the {\eta}-pairing states are shown to be
energy towers, acting as quantum scars.

### Nonlinear magnetization dynamics as a route to nonreciprocal phases, spin superfluidity, and analogue gravity

- **TL;DR**: 该论文展示了传统铁磁多层结构如何实现非线性与非厄米性的独立调控，通过直流驱动与吉尔伯特阻尼的平衡稳定了手性自旋超流极限环，实现了自发破缺时空平移对称性，并产生了非互易的自旋超流二极管效应。

The identification of platforms with independently tunable nonlinearity and
non-Hermiticity promises a quantitative route to far-from-equilibrium
universality across many-body systems. Here we show that a conventional
ferromagnetic multilayer realizes this paradigm: balancing a dc drive against
Gilbert damping stabilizes a chiral spin-superfluid limit cycle that
spontaneously breaks spacetime-translation symmetry. The resulting superflow is
intrinsically nonreciprocal: long-wavelength magnons of opposite chirality
acquire asymmetric dispersions and propagate direction-selectively, realizing a
spin-superfluid diode. This asymmetry is flow-borne - it reflects broken
Galilean invariance and requires neither structural asymmetry nor finely tuned
gain-loss balance. Linearized dynamics in the comoving superfluid frame are
intrinsically pseudo-Hermitian and, in the long-wavelength sector, can be
mapped to a (1+1)D wave equation on curved spacetime. Spatial modulation of the
drive enables the generation of sonic horizons that parametrically squeeze
magnons and produce Hawking-like particle-hole emission. Our results establish
a tabletop route from nonlinear dissipative-driven magnetization dynamics to
nonreciprocal transport, nonequilibrium phase transitions, and analogue-gravity
kinematics.

### Machine-learning-derived protocols for information-based work extraction from active particles

- **TL;DR**: 提出一种从单个活性粒子中提取有用功的方法，通过测量自推进力与约束力的相对符号并调整势阱刚度，利用机器学习找到最优的时变刚度协议，可提取超出传统反馈过程第二定律限制的功。

We propose and analyze a process that extracts useful work from a single
active particle maintained at constant temperature in a harmonic potential by
measuring the relative sign of the self-propulsion and the confining force and
then adjusting the stiffness of the potential. First, we show analytically that
useful work can be extracted by stepwise changes of the stiffness. Then, we use
a machine learning procedure to find time-dependent stiffness change protocols.
We find that these protocols involve discontinuous initial changes of the
stiffness opposite to the expected direction resembling the jumps analytically
found by Garcia-Millan et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 135, 088301 (2025)] in a
different information-based work extraction process. The learned protocols
allow to extract significantly larger amounts of useful work. The work
extracted exceeds that allowed by the second law for feedback processes, which
can be rationalized by the non-equilibrium character of the system considered.

### Interlayer Pores Play a Limited Role in Diffusion Through Hydrated Na-MMT: Insights from a Multiscale, Experimentally Anchored Model

This study investigates the interlayer diffusion dynamics in sodium
montmorillonite (Na-MMT), a smectite clay with significant applications in
environmental science, pharmaceuticals, and advanced materials. We present a
multiscale computational framework that integrates atomistic simulations with
mesoscale modelling to explore the influence of interlayer and free pores on
water and ion diffusion under varying dry densities (0.8--1.3 g/cm$^3$). The
model incorporates experimentally determined platelet size distributions and
explicitly accounts for polydispersity and anisotropic transport. The study
results reveal that interlayer pores contribute minimally to overall water
diffusion at the studied dry densities. Water diffusion predominantly occurs
through free pores, with diffusion scaling factors closely aligning with
experimental tritium tracer measurements when interlayer throttling was
considered. The study also highlights the anisotropic nature of diffusion in
Na-MMT, with diffusion parallel-to-compaction being significantly slower than
in the normal direction which is consistent with experiments. The computational
model, validated against lattice Boltzmann simulations and experimental data,
provides insights into the geometric tortuosity and pore size distribution of
Na-MMT. Despite its limitations, such as the absence of three-water minima
energy profiles and rigid platelet assumptions, the model offers a robust
framework for understanding nanoconfined diffusion. Future work will focus on
refining interlayer energy profiles and incorporating flexible platelet
dynamics to enhance predictive accuracy with implications for optimizing
materials in environmental, industrial, and biomedical applications.

In flat-band superconductors, the electron pairing is strongly enhanced so
that the critical temperature scales linearly with the interaction strength.
Identifying the governing pairing mechanism in flat-band superconducting
systems is therefore a central task, which may be constrained by experimental
probes via low-temperature scaling measurements. A key observable underlying
the Meissner effect and the resulting divergent DC conductivity is the
superfluid weight. While it is well established that the minimal quantum metric
provides the dominant contribution to the superfluid weight in conventional
superconductors with isolated flat bands, recent studies indicate that the
unconventional pairing can generate additional nonlocal quantum geometric
terms. This motivates us to derive the low-temperature scaling law of the
superfluid weight in two-dimensional flat-band superconductors with
sufficiently isolated bands. In particular, we consider the gap function with
point or line nodes classified by the Weierstrass preparation theorem. Beyond
the superfluid weight, we additionally deliver explicit low-temperature scaling
laws of the order parameter, the tunneling conductance, the specific heat, the
Sommerfeld coefficient, and the spin-lattice relaxation rate to provide
complementary experimental discriminants of the underlying pairing symmetry.
The implications of our results are also elucidated by applying them to a
selection of superconducting states in $C_{6v}$-symmetric systems.

- **TL;DR**: 研究了SrOPh及其氘代分子的A和B电子激发态之间的振动相互作用，发现氘代分子中由于能隙更小导致态混合更显著，通过KDC模型分析得出有效耦合强度为0.5 cm⁻¹。

We report detailed characterization of the vibronic interactions between the
first two electronically excited states, A and B, in SrOPh (Ph = phenyl, -C6H5)
and its deuterated counterpart, SrOPh-d5 (-C6D5). The vibronic interactions,
which arise due to non-adiabatic coupling between the two electronic states,
mix the B,v0 state with the energetically close vibronic level A,v21v33,
resulting in extra transition probability into the latter state. This state
mixing is more prominent in the deuterated molecule because of the smaller
energy gap between the interacting states. We model the mixing of the A and B
states using the Koppel-Domcke-Cederbaum (KDC) Hamiltonian parametrized in the
diabatic framework of Ichino, Gauss, and Stanton on the basis of
equation-of-motion coupled-cluster calculations. The simulation attributes the
observed mixing to a second-order effect mediated by linear quasi-diabatic
couplings between the A-C and B-C states. Based on the measured spectra, we
deduce an effective coupling strength of 0.5 cm-1. Non-adiabatic couplings
between different electronic states is an important factor that should be
considered in the design of laser-cooling protocols for complex molecules.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一个基于DSMC和PIC方法耦合的数值框架，用于模拟碰撞等离子体动力学，扩展了之前开发的均匀Landau方程DSMC技术到完全非均匀电磁体系。

We present a numerical framework for the simulation of collisional plasma
dynamics, based on a coupling between Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) and
Particle-in-Cell (PIC) methods for the Vlasov-Maxwell-Landau system. The
approach extends previously developed DSMC techniques for the homogeneous
Landau equation to the fully inhomogeneous, electromagnetic regime. The Landau
collision operator is treated through a stochastic particle formulation
inspired by the grazing-collision limit of the Boltzmann equation, which
enables an efficient and physically consistent representation of Coulomb
interactions without relying on the full Boltzmann structure. The resulting
collisional solver is combined, via operator splitting, with standard PIC
schemes for the Vlasov-Maxwell dynamics, providing flexibility in the choice of
field discretisation and time integration. The overall method preserves the
main physical invariants of the system while maintaining computational
efficiency and simplicity of implementation. Numerical experiments on benchmark
problems demonstrate the accuracy, robustness, and effectiveness of the coupled
DSMC-PIC approach across a wide range of collisional regimes.

- **TL;DR**: 本文发现通过使分数陈绝缘体偏离最低朗道能级极限，可以显著增强分数霍尔态的多体能隙，在某些情况下比传统LLL方法高出两个数量级。

Enhancing the many-body gap of a fractional state is crucial for realizing
robust fractional excitations. For fractional Chern insulators, existing
studies suggest that making flat Chern bands closely resemble the lowest Landau
level (LLL) seems to maximize the excitation gap, providing an apparently
optimal platform. In this work, we demonstrate that deforming away from the LLL
limit can, in fact, produce substantially larger FQH gaps. Using moir\'e flat
bands with strongly non-Landau-level wavefunctions, we show that the gap can
exceed that of the LLL by more than two orders of magnitude for short-range
interactions and by factors of two to three for long-range interactions. This
enhancement is generic across Abelian FCI states and follows a universal
enhancement factor within each hierarchy. Using the Landau level framework, we
identify the amplification of pseudopotentials as the microscopic origin of the
observed enhancement. This finding demonstrates that pseudopotential
engineering can substantially strengthen fractional topological phases. We
further examined non-Abelian states and found that, within finite-size
resolution, this wavefunction construction method can also be used to
manipulate and enhance the gap for certain interaction parameters.

### Exact time-evolving resonant states for open double quantum-dot systems with spin degrees of freedom

We study time-evolving resonant states in an open double quantum-dot system,
taking into account spin degrees of freedom as well as both on-dot and interdot
Coulomb interactions. We exactly derived a non-Hermite effective Hamiltonian
acting on the subspace of two quantum dots, where the non-Hermiticity arises
from an effect of infinite external leads connected to the quantum dots. By
diagonalizing the effective Hamiltonian, we identify four types of two-body
resonant states. For the initial states of localized two electrons with
opposite spins on the quantum dots, we exactly solve the time-dependent
Schroedinger equation and obtain time-evolving two-body resonant states. The
time-evolving resonant states are normalizable since their wave function grows
exponentially only inside a finite space interval that expands in time with
electron velocity. By using the exact solution, we analyze the survival and
transition probabilities of localized two electrons on the quantum dots.

### Emerging correlations between diffusing particles evolving via simultaneous resetting with memory

- **TL;DR**: 研究N维扩散行走者在重置到历史访问位置时，其位置各分量之间相关性的涌现。发现记忆核参数控制相关性的增长模式，存在临界值区分单调增长和非单调增长两种机制。

We study the emergence of correlations between $N$ components of the position
of a diffusive walker in $N$ dimensions that starts at the origin and resets to
previously visited sites with certain probabilities. This is equivalent to $N$
independent one-dimensional diffusive processes starting from the origin and
being subject to simultaneous resetting to positions visited in the past.
Resetting follows a memory kernel that interpolates between resetting to the
origin only, and the preferential relocation model, a path-dependent process
which is highly non-Markov. For weak memory, the correlation coefficient
between two components of the $N$-dimensional process grows monotonously with
time and tends at late times to a constant bounded by $1/5$, the value
corresponding to the non-equilibrium steady state of resetting to the origin.
When memory is sufficiently long-ranged, the correlation is non-monotonous and
reaches a maximum at a finite time before converging to its asymptotic value.
These two regimes are separated by a critical memory parameter value. In the
limiting case of the preferential relocation model, the components become
uncorrelated at both short and long times, but the correlation vanishes
logarithmically slowly at late times. The emergence of correlations through
resetting can be described in a unified way in all cases by noticing that the
processes are conditionally independent and identically distributed, even in
the presence of memory. In the non-Markovian case, the conditioning parameter
is the duration of a Brownian path composed of several parts of the full
trajectory of a fixed duration $t$.

Altermagnetic (AM) compounds have recently emerged as a promising platform
for realizing unconventional quantum phases, enabled by their unique spin-split
band structure at zero net magnetization. Here, we present a first-principles
investigation of magnetically intercalated transition metal dichalcogenides
(TMDs) of the form XY$_4$Z$_8$ (X $=$ Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cr, or V; Y $=$ Nb or Ta;
and Z $=$ Se or S), identifying a subset of new versatile AM candidates. Our
results establish a direct correlation between interatomic geometry, quantified
by the ratio of interlayer to intralayer spacing, and the selection of magnetic
ground states. Systems with A-type antiferromagnetic order exhibit
momentum-dependent spin splitting consistent with AM behavior. Crucially, the
combination of the AM spin-splitting and the spin-orbit coupling leads to the
emergence of Weyl nodes together with the corresponding topological Fermi arc
surface states. Moreover, we identify flat bands near the Fermi level that
originate from the intercalant-induced formation of an effective kagome-like
sublattice in the TMD layer. These results collectively establish magnetically
intercalated TMDs as a promising platform for engineering altermagnetism, flat
bands, and Weyl fermions within a single material family, facilitating the
development of topological and spintronic applications.

Marcus theory is fundamental to describing electron transfer reactions and
quantifying their rates, effectively representing the energy surface associated
with an electron transfer from the reactant to the product ionic state via
parabolas within a reaction coordinate diagram. Here, we present an intuitive
and computationally efficient generalised reaction coordinate amenable to
molecular dynamics simulations. By utilising the nuclear charge of the ion, we
are able to quantify in a targeted approach changes in the ion's solvation
shell, thereby efficiently obtaining the free energy profile associated with
the electron transfer, the transition state geometry and the evolution of the
water network.

Carbon nanotube (CNTs) materials, which exhibit intrinsically high electrical
conductivity, are promising candidates for energy-efficient electronic devices.
Recently, high-density CNT films have also been successfully employed as
switching elements in non-volatile memory cells. However, the mechanism of
electrical conduction through such complex systems is still poorly understood.
To identify structural parameters that govern the electrical current in CNT
films, we employed coarse-grained molecular dynamics to construct dense
mesoscale CNT film models, where we considered CNTs with different chiralities
and lengths. The effects of CNT geometrical features on the film morphologies
were quantified by devising a set of structural descriptors and analyzing their
mutual correlations. The impact of varying the concentration of amorphous
carbon (aC) inclusions on the film structure was assessed. Finally, we employed
a nodal analysis framework to compute the electrical current across the
networks and correlate the charge transport characteristics to the underlying
structural descriptors. Transport is found to be enhanced in films that exhibit
high curvature and buckling, low bundling, and strong connectivity, with
amorphous carbon components playing a nontrivial configuration-dependent role.
These findings provide a framework for the rational design of CNT-based
memristor architectures and highlight the potential of mesoscale modeling to
guide the engineering of advanced nanostructured materials.

For spin and fermionic systems in any spatial dimension, we establish that
the superpolynomial decay behavior of mutual information and conditional mutual
information is a universal property of gapped pure- and mixed-state phases,
i.e., all systems in such a phase possess this property if one system in this
phase possesses this property. We further demonstrate that the (conditional)
mutual information indeed decays superpolynomially in a large class of phases,
including chiral phases. As a byproduct, we sharpen the notion of mixed-state
phases.

We develop a unified perturbative framework for energy transport along a
chiral quantum Hall (QH) edge coupled to a disordered, compressible strip.
Treating the strip as a generic linear response environment characterized by
its retarded susceptibility $\chi_q^R(k,\omega)$, we derive leading-order
interaction corrections to both the edge heat flux and the plasmon spectrum.
Two complementary regimes are analyzed: (i) a gapped, local dielectric response
with finite-range coupling, which yields a universal negative $T^4$ correction
to the quantized heat flux and a corresponding convex cubic term in the plasmon
dispersion; and (ii) a hydrodynamic (diffusive) response with relaxation,
producing a crossover from $T^4$ to $T^{3/2}$ scaling and a change of sign in
the correction. The resulting backaction reduces the plasmon group velocity and
can suppress the apparent thermal conductance by an amount consistent with
experiment. Importantly, the total heat flux remains quantized: the apparent
deficit in the plasmon contribution corresponds to an induced energy flow
within the compressible strip, representing a form of heat drag between chiral
and nonchiral modes. The framework thus provides a microscopic and
quantitatively plausible explanation of the ``missing heat flux'' anomaly
observed at QH edges and links its transport signature to the nonlinearity of
the plasmon spectrum.

### Revealing Liquid-Gas Transitions with Finite-Size Scaling in Confined Systems

The application of an external field often renders empirical criteria for
identifying liquid-gas phase transitions ambiguous. Here, we demonstrate that
the finite-size scaling of the density profile provides a definitive criterion
to distinguish liquid-gas coexistence from a single fluid phase in
field-confined systems. Our scaling method collapses the density profiles of
different system sizes onto a single master curve for a one-phase system, while
causing the profiles to intersect at the interface in a two-phase system. We
validate this theoretical proposal through experiments and simulations of two
model systems: colloidal suspensions under gravity and/or two-dimensional
complex plasmas confined by a central potential. Our method is broadly
applicable for detecting liquid-gas phase transitions in laboratory systems
where external fields are inherent.

Using Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations and Monte-Carlo (MC)
simulations, we investigate the recently reported magnetic transition in B2
Al-Cr-Co alloys. The Cr sublattice is alloyed with different amounts of Co in
the antiferromagnetic (AFM) B2 AlCr binary alloy and the resulting exchange
interactions are analyzed within the Heisenberg Hamiltonian framework. DFT
results reveal that at low Co concentrations the system favors the AFM order,
while at high Co contents a transition to the ferromagnetic (FM) state is
observed. Within the FM stability field, the Curie temperature (TC), obtained
within the mean-field approximation, is below ~160 K and decreases with Co
concentration. The calculated exchange parameters evolve systematically with Co
content, and the trends are consistent with the DFT total energies. The
magnetic configurations obtained from MC simulations follow the DFT results at
low Cr levels but predict a spin-glass behavior for alloys containing more than
40 at.% Co on Cr sublattice. These findings provide a fundamental understanding
of how the chemistry-driven changes in exchange interactions affect magnetism
in the B2 Al-Cr-Co alloys.

High-temperature superconductors are essential for next-generation energy and
quantum technologies, yet their performance is often limited by the critical
current density ($J_c$), which is strongly influenced by microstructural
defects. Optimizing $J_c$ through defect engineering is challenging due to the
complex interplay of defect type, density, and spatial correlation. Here we
present an integrated workflow that combines reinforcement learning (RL) with
time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) simulations to autonomously identify
optimal defect configurations that maximize $J_c$. In our framework, TDGL
simulations generate current-voltage characteristics to evaluate $J_c$, which
serves as the reward signal that guides the RL agent to iteratively refine
defect configurations. We find that the agent discovers optimal defect
densities and correlations in two-dimensional thin-film geometries, enhancing
vortex pinning and $J_c$ relative to the pristine thin-film, approaching 60\%
of theoretical depairing limit with up to 15-fold enhancement compared to
random initialization. This RL-driven approach provides a scalable strategy for
defect engineering, with broad implications for advancing HTS applications in
fusion magnets, particle accelerators, and other high-field technologies.

conducted through diverse methodologies. These include the analysis of the

points in actually in the dataset. the investigation identifies an optimal
range of perturbation distances where the underlying manifold extraction
algorithm inside AI Poincar\'e exhibits optimal performance. Additionally, an
improved neural network architecture is proposed based on the observed results.
Finally, we apply the algorithm to preliminary experimental data from the

of conserved quantities even in the presence of fast decoherence of the
measured signal.

Using stochastic series expansion quantum Monte Carlo method and density
matrix renormalization group, we study the ground-state phase diagram of
$S=1/2$ Heisenberg model on 2D square-hexagon-octagon (SHO) lattice. In this
model, we consider two kinds of nearest-neighbor interaction (intra-hexagon
interaction $J_1$ and inter-hexagon $J_2$) and the selected third
nearest-neighbor interaction $J_3$ along $x$ direction. From our calculations,
there are five phases in the parameters regime $0&lt;\lambda_1=J_2/J_1&lt;4,
0&lt;\lambda_2=J_3/J_1&lt;4$, including a N\'eel antiferromagentic phase, a
Haldane-like symmetry protected topological phase, a hexagon phase and two
dimer phases. In the Haldane-like SPT phase, we characterized its topological
nature using the degeneracy of ground-state energy under open boundary
condition and the entanglement spectrum. To characterize the phase boundaries,
we use spin stiffness and Binder cumulant to do the comprehensive finite-size
scalings. From data collapse, the critical behaviors of all the nonmagnetic
phases to the antiferromagnetic phase belong to the 3D $O(3)$ Heisenberg
universality class. As a theoretical exploration, our work establishes a
foundational framework for understanding 2D magnetism on the SHO lattice.

We use a combination of density functional theory calculations and optical
modeling to establish that the electric field-induced Kerr rotation in metallic
thin films has contributions from both non-equilibrium orbital moment
accumulation (arising from the orbital Edelstein effect) and a heretofore
overlooked surface Pockels effect. The Kerr rotation associated with orbital
accumulation has been studied in previous works and is largely due to the dc
electric field-induced change of the electron distribution function. In
contrast, the surface Pockels effect is largely due to the dc field-induced
change to the wave functions. Both of these contributions arise from the dual
mirror symmetry breaking from the surface and from the dc applied field. Our
calculations show that the resulting Kerr rotation is due to the dc electric
field modification of the optical conductivity within a couple of nanometers
from the surface, consistent with the dependence on the local mirror symmetry
breaking at the surface. For thin films of Pt, our calculations show that the
relative contributions of the orbital Edelstein and surface Pockels effects are
comparable, and that they have different effects on Kerr rotation of $s$ and
$p$ polarized light, $\theta_K^s$ and $\theta_K^p$. The orbital Edelstein
effect yields similar values of $\theta_K^s$ and $\theta_K^p$, while the
surface Pockels effect leads to opposing values of $\theta_K^s$ and
$\theta_K^p$.

We demonstrate that when a Brownian bridge is physically constrained to be
canonical, its time evolution becomes identical to an m-geodesic on the
statistical manifold of Gaussian distributions. This finding provides strong
evidence that, akin to general relativity where free particles follow
geodesics, purely random processes also follow ``straight lines" defined by the
geometry of information. This geometric principle is a direct consequence of
the dually flat structure inherent to information geometry, originating from
the asymmetry of informational ``distance" (divergence) leading to the
violation of metric compatibility. Our results suggest a geometric foundation
for randomness and open the door to an equivalence principle for information.

Using ab initio Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, we investigate
the electronic structure, phase stability, and magnetic properties of
equiatomic binary alloys between Al and 3d magnetic transition elements (Cr,
Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni). Thermodynamically, all five binary aluminides are more
stable in the ordered B2 phase than in the disordered body centered cubic
phase, and Co is found to be the strongest B2 forming element with Al. The AlCo
and AlNi compounds with B2 structure are verified to be non-magnetic, whereas
AlFe turns out to be weakly magnetic, which is consistent with other DFT
calculations employing similar exchange-correlation approximations. Magnetic
simulations based on the Heisenberg Hamiltonian predict an antiferromagnetic
ground state for the hypothetical B2 AlCr, which is also confirmed by direct
DFT calculations. Doping AlCr with Co leads to an antiferromagnetic to
ferromagnetic transition, where ferromagnetism is to a large extent attributed
to Cr atoms. The phase stability and magnetic trends are explained using
electronic structure arguments. The present findings contribute to a deeper
understanding of the phase stability and magnetic properties of AlX binary
alloys, providing insights into the formation mechanisms of the B2 structure
with 3d magnetic transition metals.

Quantum coherence plays a key role in the operation and performance of
quantum heat engines and refrigerators. Despite its importance for the
fundamental understanding in quantum thermodynamics and its technological
implications, coherence effects in heat transport have not been observed
previously. Here, we measure quantum features in the heat transfer between a
qubit and a thermal bath in a system formed of a driven flux qubit galvanically
coupled to a $\lambda/4$ coplanar-waveguide resonator that is coupled to a heat
reservoir. This thermal bath is a normal-metal mesoscopic resistor, whose
temperature can be measured and controlled. We detect interference patterns in
the heat current due to driving-induced coherence. In particular, resonance
peaks in the heat transferred to the bath are found at driving frequencies
which are integer fractions of the resonator frequency. A selection rule on the
even/odd parity of the peaks holds at the qubit symmetry point. We present a
theoretical model based on Floquet theory that captures the experimental
results. The studied system provides a platform for studying the role of
coherence in quantum thermodynamics. Our work opens the possibility to
demonstrate a true quantum thermal machine where heat is measured directly.

[1-13C]pyruvate is the most widely used tracer for hyperpolarized metabolic
magnetic resonance imaging, with profound applications in tumor and
inflammation diagnosis as well as treatment monitoring. The most fundamental
hurdle to broader application, however, remains the rapid polarization
relaxation and the associated signal loss. Here, we report a method to address
this challenge. Studying the nuclear spin relaxation dispersion of
[1-13C]pyruvate across magnetic fields from 8 {\mu}T to 9.4 T, as a function of
additives, solvents, and preparation methods, allowed us to achieve relaxation
times of up to four minutes. Such a long time could enable reliable quality
control and nearly polarization loss-free transport, further boosting the power
of hyperpolarized metabolic MRI.

### Fast integration method for averaging polydisperse bubble population dynamics

Ensemble-averaged polydisperse bubbly flow models require statistical moments
of the evolving bubble size distribution. Under step forcing, these moments
reach statistical equilibrium in finite time. However, the transitional phase
before equilibrium and cases with time-dependent forcing are required to
predict flow in engineering applications. Computing these moments is expensive
because the integrands are highly oscillatory, even when the bubble dynamics
are linear. Ensemble-averaged models compute these moments at each grid point
and time step, making cost reduction important for large-scale bubbly flow
simulations. Traditional methods evaluate the integrals via traditional
quadrature rules. This approach requires a large number of quadrature nodes in
the equilibrium bubble size, each equipped with its own advection partial
differential equation (PDE), resulting in significant computational expense. We
formulate a Levin collocation method to reduce this cost. Given the
differential equation associated with the integrand, or moment, the method
approximates it by evaluating its derivative via polynomial collocation. The
differential matrix and amplitude function are well-suited to numerical
differentiation via collocation, and so the computation is comparatively cheap.
For an example excited polydisperse bubble population, the first moment is
computed with the presented method at $10^{-3}$ relative error with 100 times
fewer quadrature nodes than the trapezoidal rule. The gap increases for smaller
target relative errors: the Levin method requires $10^4$ times fewer points for
a relative error of $10^{-8}$. The formulated method maintains constant cost as
the integrands become more oscillatory with time, making it particularly
attractive for long-time simulations.

### Quantum fluctuations determine the spin-flop transition in hematite

Magnetic phase transitions between ordered phases are often understood on the
basis of semi-classical spin models. Deviations from the classical description
due to the quantum nature of the atomic spins as well as quantum fluctuations
are usually treated as negligible if long-range order is preserved, and are
rarely quantified for actual materials. Here, we demonstrate that a fully
quantum-mechanical framework is required for a quantitatively correct
description of the spin-flop transition in the insulating altermagnet hematite
between the collinear antiferromagnetic and the weakly ferromagnetic spin-flop
phase at low temperature. By applying both exact diagonalization and
density-matrix renormalization group theory to the quantum Heisenberg
Hamiltonian, we show how a quantum-mechanical treatment of an ab initio
parametrized spin model can significantly improve the predicted low-temperature
spin-flop field over a classical description when compared to measurements. Our
results imply that quantum fluctuations have a measurable influence on
selecting the ground state of a system out of competing ordered magnetic phases
at low temperature.

### Excitation of Confined Bulk Plasmons in metallic nanoparticles by penetrating electron beams within a non-local analytical approach

Using a linear hydrodynamic model (HDM) we investigate theoretically the
interaction between penetrating electron beams and sub-5 nm metallic spherical
nanoparticles (NPs), and provide an analytical expression of the electron
energy loss (EEL) probability including non-local effects in the response of
the confined electron gas. We focus on the characterization of the longitudinal
plasmon excitations, or confined bulk plasmons (CBPs), which cannot be
addressed within local dielectric frameworks, and show that their excitation is
highly sensitive to the impact parameter and kinetic energy of the incident
electron beam, as well as to the NP's size. In contrast to the local approach,
our decription captures a blueshift of the bulk plasmon envelope (BPE) with
decreasing NP size and a blueshift with increasing impact parameter. Moreover,
it predicts a threshold impact parameter, or minimum electron path inside the
NP, to efficiently activate a set of CBPs. Exploiting the multipolar
description of the CBPs we identify the underlying symmetry rules governing
their excitation by electron beams, and correlate the observed blueshift of the
BPE for increasing impact parameters with the excitation of higher-order CBPs.
Dispersion of the CBPs with decreasing NP sizes further increases this impact
parameter dependent blueshift of the BPE and also explains the decrease in the
impact parameter threshold.

Entropy of the cell fluid model with Curie-Weiss interaction is obtained in
analytical form as a function of temperature and chemical potential. A
parametric equation is derived representing the entropy as a function of
density. Features of both the entropy per particle and the entropy per cell are
investigated at the entropy-density and entropy-chemical potential planes. The
considered cell model is a multiple-occupancy model and possesses an infinite
sequence of first-order phase transitions at sufficiently low temperatures. We
find that the entropy exhibits pronounced minima at around integer-valued
particle densities, which may be a generic feature of multiple-occupancy
models.

In this study, we performed comprehensive investigations on the Raman active
phonon modes in cubic bixbyite In$_2$O$_3$, an important oxide based,
wide-bandgap semiconductor. Fundamental insights into the lattice dynamics are
revealed, by determining the atomistic contribution to all modes and their
frequencies by density functional perturbation theory calculations. Those
simulations were performed for different compositions of $^{16}$O and $^{18}$O
isotope ratios, including their pure states. An increasing red-shift of the
mode frequencies with increasing $^{18}$O content for all modes, due to the
increased atomic mass, is revealed. For the seven lowest energy modes, this
relative shift is below 1%, whereas for the remaining 15 higher energetic modes
a shift of about 5.5% was identified. All modes have energy contributions of
both indium and oxygen lattice sites, except for one, which corresponds to a
pure oxygen vibrational state. Applying Raman spectroscopy, those results could
be verified experimentally with excellent agreement. Investigated samples
consisted of a bulk single crystal with $^{16}$O isotopes and a MBE grown thin
film as the $^{18}$O sample. Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry
confirms the purity of the oxygen isotope in the sample. These isotopologue
studies allow for a direct experimental access to fundamental material
properties in cubic In$_2$O$_3$ by means of Raman spectroscopy. For example, we
speculate, that the presence of oxygen vacancies in In$_2$O$_3$ would result in
a shift of modes that are dominated by O-vibrations, e. g., $E_{g}^{(4)}$ or
$A_{g}^{(4)}$, towards lower frequencies.

The accurate prediction of ionization potentials (IPs) is central to
understanding molecular reactivity, redox behavior, and spectroscopic
properties. While vertical IPs can be accessed directly from electronic
excitations at fixed nuclear geometries, the computation of adiabatic IPs
requires nuclear gradients of the ionized states, posing a major theoretical
and computational challenge, especially within correlated frameworks. Among the
most promising approaches for IP calculations is the many-body Green's function
$GW$ method, which provides a balanced compromise between accuracy and
computational efficiency. Furthermore, it is applicable to both finite and
extended systems. Recent work has established formal connections between $GW$
and coupled-cluster doubles (CCD) theory, leading to the first derivation of
analytic $GW$ nuclear gradients via a unitary CCD framework. In this work, we
present an alternative, fully analytic formulation of $GW$ nuclear gradients
based on a modified version of the traditional equation-of-motion CCD
formalism, enabling the inclusion of missing correlation effects in the
traditional CCD methods.

Harnessing non-Markovian effects has emerged as a resource for quantum
control, where a structured environment can act as a quantum memory. We
investigate the quench dynamics from specific initial states to equilibrium
steady states in strongly correlated quantum dot systems. The distance between
quantum states is quantified using the Bures metric, which endows the space of
reduced density matrices with a Riemannian geometric structure. Using the
numerically exact hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) method, we
demonstrate a quantum Mpemba effect arising from non-Markovianity. This effect
is characterized by a relaxation slowdown due to information backflow from the
bath to the system, which induces a pronounced memory effect. We show that the
emergence of the non-Markovian quantum Mpemba effect on the approach to a
strongly correlated steady state is determined by the interplay between the
initial-state-dependent non-Markovianity and the initial geometric distance
between states. Our results underscore the critical role of memory effects in
quantum quench dynamics and suggest new pathways for controlling anomalous
relaxation in open quantum systems.

### Sensitive detection of the Rydberg transition in trapped electrons on liquid helium using radio-frequency reflectometry

- **TL;DR**: 使用射频反射测量法检测液氦上捕获电子的里德伯态激发，发现响应主要来自电子的横向运动而非量子电容效应

Radio-frequency reflectometry, which probes small changes in the electrical
impedance of a device, provides a useful method for sensitive and fast
detection of dynamic processes in quantum systems. Here, we use this method to
detect excitation of the quantized motional (Rydberg) states of trapped
electrons on liquid helium. The Rydberg transition in an ensemble of electrons
is detected by a change in the impedance of an rf circuit in response to a
pulsed-modulated microwave excitation. The result is compared with an
independent impedance measurement on the same electron system modulated by an
electrostatic potential and with a numerical simulation using the Green's
function method. Additionally, it is found that the rf response to the Rydberg
resonance can be strongly enhanced by a resonant mode of the electron
collective motion. Our results suggest that the observed response to the
Rydberg resonance must be attributed to the lateral motion of microwave-excited
electrons rather than the quantum capacitance associated with their vertical
displacement, as was recently reported. Our theoretical analysis based on the
solution of the master equation shows that the quantum capacitance would show a
response which is drastically different from what is observed in the
experiments.

Nowadays a bit is no longer a mere abstraction but a physical quantity whose
manipulation governs both operation of modern technologies and theoretical
frontiers of fundamental science. In this work we propose a setup in which the
memory time can be utilized to control the generation and storage of binary
information. In particular, we consider a nonequilibrium Brownian particle
immersed in a viscoelastic environment and dwelling in a spatially periodic
potential. We interpret its average velocity as a bit and show that depending
on the memory time characterizing the viscoelastic bath the particle can be
either in one of two stable states representing the bit values or in a chaotic
state in which the information is erased and a new bit can be generated. We
analyze randomness of the so obtained bit sequence and assess the stability of
the produced values. Our study provides a blueprint for storing and processing
information in a microscopic system using its memory.

Phonon polaritons in van der Waals crystals offer mid-infrared light
confinement deep below the diffraction limit, making them promising for
nanophotonics applications. However, the practical use of phonon polaritons
remains limited, in part due to the lack of precise control over the phonon
polariton dispersion, as crystal lattice vibrations are often inert to external
stimuli. Here, we address this challenge by zerovalent metal intercalation of
$\alpha$-MoO$_3$. Photo-induced force microscopy shows that introducing tin
into the van der Waals gap modulates the phonon polariton dispersion by up to
$38.5\pm0.5\%$, which is the highest amount of tunability among non-mechanical
modulation approaches, to the best of our knowledge. Intercalation with various
metal species preserves the phonon polariton lifetimes, while modulating the
dielectric permittivity in agreement with the density functional theory and
analytical calculations. Our results establish metal intercalation as a
practical route to reconfigurable mid-infrared nanophotonics.

Paired electrolysis at industrial current densities offers an
energy-efficient and sustainable alternative to thermocatalytic chemical
synthesis by leveraging anodic and cathodic valorization. However, its
industrial feasibility remains constrained by system integration, including
reactor assembly, asymmetric electron transfer kinetics, membrane selection,
mass transport limitations, and techno-economic bottlenecks. Addressing these
challenges requires an engineering-driven approach that integrates reactor
architecture, electrode-electrolyte interactions, reaction pairing, and process
optimization. Here, we discuss scale-specific electrochemical reactor assembly
strategies, transitioning from half-cell research to full-scale stack
validation. We develop reaction pairing frameworks that align electrocatalyst
design with electrochemical kinetics, enhancing efficiency and selectivity
under industrial operating conditions. We also establish application-dependent
key performance indicators (KPIs) and benchmark propylene oxidation coupled
with hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) or oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)
against existing industrial routes to evaluate process viability. Finally, we
propose hybrid integration models that embed paired electrolysis into existing
industrial workflows, overcoming adoption barriers.

Recent theoretical and experimental studies have revealed the co-existence of
heavy and light electrons in magic-angle multilayer graphene, which form a
periodic lattice of Anderson impurities hybridizing with Dirac semi-metals.
This work demonstrates that nontrivial features -- pairing potential,
pseudogap, and continuous quantum phase transitions -- already appear at the
single-impurity level, if valley-anisotropic anti-Hund's interactions ($J_S$,
$J_D$) are included, favoring either a singlet ($J_S&gt;J_D$) or a valley doublet
($J_D&gt;J_S$) impurity configuration. We derive a complete phase diagram and
analytically solve the impurity problem at several fixed points using
bosonization and refermionization techniques. When $J_D&gt;J_S,J_D&gt;0$, the valley
doublet only couples via pair-hopping processes to the conduction electrons, in
sharp contrast to the conventional Kondo scenario. Upon increasing $J_D$, there
is a quantum phase transition of the BKT universality class, from a Fermi
liquid to an anisotropic doublet phase, the latter exhibiting power-law
susceptibilities with non-universal exponents. On the other hand, when
$J_S&gt;J_D,J_S&gt;0$, increasing $J_S$ induces a second-order phase transition from
Fermi liquid to a local singlet phase, which involves a non-Fermi liquid as an
intermediate fixed point. Near the transition towards the anisotropic doublet
(local singlet) phase, the renormalized interaction of the Fermi liquid becomes
attractive, favoring doublet (singlet) pairing. Based on analytic solutions, we
construct ansatz for the impurity spectral function and correlation
self-energy, which account for the pseudogap accompanying side peaks, found in
recent spectroscopic measurements and a DMFT study. In particular, we obtain a
non-analytic V-shaped spectral function with non-universal exponents in the
anisotropic doublet phase. All results are further verified by NRG

We compute the electronic and emission properties of Coulomb-correlated
multi-particle states (X$^0$, X$^\pm$, XX) in weakly confining GaAs/AlGaAs
quantum dots using an 8-band $\mathbf{k}\!\cdot\!\mathbf{p}$ model coupled to
continuum elasticity and configuration interaction (CI). We evaluate
polarization-resolved oscillator strengths and radiative rates both in the
dipole approximation (DA) and in a quasi-electrostatic beyond-dipole (BDA)
longitudinal formulation implemented via a Poisson reformulation exactly
equivalent to the dyadic Green-tensor kernel. For the dots studied, BDA yields
lifetimes in quantitative agreement with experiment, e.g.,
$\tau^X=0.279\,\mathrm{ns}$ vs $0.267\,\mathrm{ns}$ (exp.) and
$\tau^{XX}=0.101\,\mathrm{ns}$ vs $0.115\,\mathrm{ns}$ (exp.). The framework
also reproduces electric-field tuning of the multi-particle electronic
structure and emission -- including the indistinguishability inferred from
$P=\tau^X/(\tau^X+\tau^{XX})$ -- and we assess sensitivity to CI-basis size and
to electron-electron and hole-hole exchange.

- **TL;DR**: 提出基于图论的CR-WMIS模型来改进传统投资组合优化方法，通过结合最大独立集的风险分散效应和加权最大独立集的收益权重效应，在S&P 500数据上验证了其在收益和风险方面的优越性。

The portfolio optimization problem is a critical issue in asset management
and has long been studied. Markowitz's mean-variance model has fundamental
limitations, such as the assumption of a normal distribution for returns and
sensitivity to estimation errors in input parameters. In this research, we
propose a novel graph theory-based approach, the cardinality-return weighted
maximum independent set (CR-WMIS) model, to overcome these limitations. The
CR-WMIS model pursues the optimization of both return and risk characteristics.
It integrates the risk diversification effect by selecting the largest number
of weakly correlated stocks, a feature of the maximum independent set (MIS)
model, with the weighting effect based on expected returns from the weighted
maximum independent set (WMIS) model. We validated the effectiveness of the
proposed method through a five-year backtesting simulation (April 2019 - March
2024) using real market data from the S&P 500. For this task, we employed a
simulated-bifurcation-based solver for finding high-quality solutions to
large-scale combinatorial optimization problems. In our evaluation, we
conducted a comprehensive risk assessment, which has not been sufficiently
explored in previous MIS and WMIS studies. The results demonstrate that the
CR-WMIS model exhibits superiority in both return and risk characteristics
compared to the conventional MIS and WMIS models, as well as the market index
(S&P 500). This study provides a practical portfolio optimization method that
overcomes the theoretical limitations of the mean-variance model, contributing
to both the advancement of academic theory and the support of practical
investment decision-making.

Van der Waals ferroelectrics are conventionally switched by sliding the
different layers between stacking orders with opposing electric polarizations.
Ultrashort laser pulses have been proposed to launch shear modes and induce
switching, with often unfeasible large pulse energies however. Here, we
demonstrate switching of ferroelectricity in bilayer hexagonal boron nitride
through nonlinearly excited phonons. We show that the efficiencies of
conventional coherent phonon excitation mechanisms, including infrared
absorption and Raman scattering techniques, are too low to overcome the energy
barrier separating the two ferroelectric states. We demonstrate instead that
excitation of high-frequency intralayer modes leads to a tilting of the
interlayer potential-energy landscape that enables changing the stacking order.
Our results provide an avenue towards efficient phononic slidetronics, enabling
ultrafast control of the stacking order in van der Waals materials.

### Dynamics and formation of antiferromagnetic textures in MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ single crystal

- **TL;DR**: 利用相干X射线成像技术直接观察MnBi2Te4中的反铁磁畴和畴壁，发现畴壁宽度为550(30)nm，并揭示了冷却和升温过程中畴壁演化的显著滞后现象。

We report coherent X-ray imaging of antiferromagnetic (AFM) domains and
domain walls in MnBi$_2$Te$_4$, an intrinsic AFM topological insulator. This
technique enables direct visualization of domain morphology without
reconstruction algorithms, allowing us to resolve antiphase domain walls as
distinct dark lines arising from the A-type AFM structure. The wall width is
determined to be 550(30) nm, in good agreement with earlier magnetic force
microscopy results. The temperature dependence of the AFM order parameter
extracted from our images closely follows previous neutron scattering data.
Remarkably, however, we find a pronounced hysteresis in the evolution of
domains and domain walls: upon cooling, dynamic reorganizations occur within a
narrow $\sim$1 K interval below $T_N$, whereas upon warming, the domain
configuration remains largely unchanged until AFM order disappears. These
findings reveal a complex energy landscape in MnBi$_2$Te$_4$, governed by the
interplay of exchange, anisotropy, and domain-wall energies, and underscore the
critical role of AFM domain-wall dynamics in shaping its physical properties.

### Deterministic single-photon source with on-chip 5.6 GHz acoustic clock

- **TL;DR**: 本文展示了一种基于量子点和声子-光子混合微腔的可扩展GHz频率单光子源，通过动态Purcell效应实现了高达14GHz的触发式单光子发射。

Scalable solid state single-photon sources (SPSs) with triggered
single-photon emission rates exceeding a few GHz would aid in the wide
technological adoption of photonic quantum technologies. We demonstrate
triggering of a quantum dot (QD) single photon emission using dynamic Purcell
effect induced at a frequency of several GHz by acoustic strain. To this end,
InAs QDs are integrated in a hybrid photon-phonon patterned microcavity, where
the density of optical states is tailored by the lateral confinement of photons
in um-sized traps defined lithographically in the microcavity spacer. The
single-photon character of the emission form a QD in a trap is confirmed by
measuring single-photon statistics. We demonstrate modulation of the QD
transition energy in a trap with a frequency up to 14 GHz by monochromatic
longitudinal bulk acoustic phonons generated by piezoelectric transducers. For
the modulation frequency of 5.6 GHz, corresponding to the acoustic mode of the
microcavity, the QD energy is periodically shifted through a spectrally narrow
confined photonic mode leading to an appreciable enhancement of the QD emission
due to the dynamic Purcell effect. The platform thus enables the implementation
of scalable III-V-based SPSs with on-chip tunable acoustic clocks with
frequencies that can exceed several GHz under continuous wave optical
excitation.

### Interrelation between precisions on integrated currents and on recurrence times in Markov jump processes

- **TL;DR**: 本文推导了马尔可夫跳跃过程中站点间净转移数平方变异系数的显式表达式，建立了与正向和反向转移时间精度的关联，并推导了一些动力学和热力学不等式。

For Markov jump processes on irreducible networks with finite number of
sites, we derive a general and explicit expression of the squared coefficient
of variation for the net number of transitions from one site to a connected
site in a given time window of observation (i.e., an `integrated current' as
dynamical output). Such expression, which in itself is particularly useful for
numerical calculations, is then elaborated to obtain the interrelation with the
precision on the intrinsic timing of the recurrences of the forward and
backward transitions. In biochemical ambits, such as enzyme catalysis and
molecular motors, the precision on the timing is quantified by the so-called
randomness parameter and the above connection is established in the long time
limit of monitoring and for an irreversible site-site transition; the present
extension to finite time and reversibility adds a new dimension. Some kinetic
and thermodynamic inequalities are also derived.

- **TL;DR**: 通过无溶剂机械化学合成方法，制备了六方氮化硼功能化锂草酸盐的层状复合材料，该材料兼具锂离子导体和隔膜功能，为固态电池提供了新型多功能材料平台。

The development of multifunctional solid-state materials is key to advancing
lithium-ion batteries with enhanced safety and simplified architectures. Here,
we report a scalable, highly efficient (near $100\%$), solvent-free
mechanochemical synthesis of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) functionalized with
lithium oxalate (Li$_2$C$_2$O$_4$), yielding a novel lamellar composite that
functions both as a lithium-ion conductor and separator. The high-energy
milling process promotes exfoliation of hBN and covalent attachment of oxalate
groups at edge and defect sites, forming a brown, nanocrystalline material with
uniform lithium distribution. The composite exhibits room-temperature ionic and
negligible electronic conductivity, thermal stability at least up to
$350~^{\circ}$C, and hosts stable free radicals enabling its use as a spin
label. The synthesis produces no byproducts and can be extended towards lithium
doping via secondary mechanochemical steps, creating highly doped, chemically
stable phases that host additional Li for ionic conduction. These results
introduce a new class of lithium-rich, boron nitride-based solids for
solid-state batteries, combining ion conduction, mechanical robustness, and
thermal resilience in a single material platform.

### Topological Control of Transition Metal Networks for Reversible High-Capacity Li-rich Cathodes

Developing high-energy-density batteries is essential for advancing
sustainable energy technologies. However, leading cathode materials such as
Li-rich oxides, including Li$_2$MnO$_3$, suffer from capacity loss due to
irreversible oxygen release and structural degradation, both consequences of
the oxygen redox activity that also enables their high capacity. The
atomic-scale mechanisms behind this degradation, and whether it can be made
reversible, remain open questions. Here, using submicrosecond-scale molecular
dynamics simulations with first-principles accuracy, we directly visualize the
entire charge-discharge cycle of Li$_2$MnO$_3$, uncovering the full lifecycle
of the O$_2$-filled nanovoids responsible for degradation and identifying the
critical size limit for voids to remain fully repairable upon discharge. Our
results reveal that the topology of the Mn cation network is the key factor
governing void growth, coalescence, and reparability. Based on a structural
topology-informed design principle, we computationally develop a novel
Li$_2$MnO$_3$ structure featuring a Mn lattice with a Kagome-like pattern,
demonstrating full electrochemical reversibility even under extreme 80%
delithiation. Our work establishes a new paradigm for designing high-energy
cathodes, shifting the focus from mitigating damage to engineering inherent
stability through atomic-level topological control of transition metal network.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究探讨了氧化物膜堆叠中界面粗糙度对原子级耦合的限制，发现即使消除污染物和非晶层，表面形貌不匹配仍会限制原子级接触，并强调电子ptychography是可靠的表征方法。

The ability to tune electronic structure in twisted stacks of layered,
two-dimensional (2D) materials has motivated the exploration of similar moir\'e
physics with stacks of twisted oxide membranes. Due to the intrinsic
three-dimensional (3D) nature of bonding in many oxides, achieving atomic-level
coupling is significantly more challenging than in 2D van der Waals materials.
Although clean interfaces with atomic level proximity have been demonstrated in
ceramic bicrystals using high-temperature and high-pressure processing to
facilitate atomic diffusion that flattens rough interfaces, such conditions are
not readily accessible when bonding oxide membranes. This study shows how
topographic mismatch due to surface roughness of the membranes can restrict
atomic-scale proximity at the interface to isolated patches even after obvious
issues of contaminants and amorphous interlayers are eliminated. In hybrid
interfaces between a chemically inert 2D material and an oxide membrane, the
reduced ability of the 2D material to conform to the membrane's step-terrace
topography also limits atomic-scale contact. In all these material systems, the
interface morphology is best characterized using cross-sectional imaging and is
necessary to corroborate investigations of interlayer coupling. When imaging
the bicrystal in projection, conventional through-focal imaging is found to be
relatively insensitive to the buried interface, whereas electron ptychography
reliably resolves structural variations on the order of a nanometer. These
findings highlight interface roughness as a key challenge for the field of
oxide twistronics and emphasizes the need for reliable characterization
methods.

### Machine-Learning-Guided Insights into Solid-Electrolyte Interphase Conductivity: Are Amorphous Lithium Fluorophosphates the Key?

Despite decades of study, the identity of the dominant \ce{Li+}-conducting
phase within the inorganic SEI of Li-ion batteries remains unresolved. While
the mosaic model describes LiF/\ce{Li2O}/\ce{Li2CO3} nanocrystallites within a
disordered matrix, these crystalline phases inherently offer limited ionic
conductivity. Growing evidence suggests that interfaces, grain boundaries, and
amorphous phases may instead host the primary fast-ion pathways. Motivated by
mixed-anion electrolyte decomposition products, we combine diffusion-based
generative structure prediction with machine-learning interatomic potentials
(MLIPs) to interrogate lithium difluorophosphate (\ce{LiPO2F2}), a key
decomposition product of phosphorus- and fluorine-containing electrolytes. We
identify a stable crystalline polymorph and, through MLIP-accelerated molecular
dynamics, show that the amorphous counterpart is more conductive, with
projected room-temperature $\sigma$ $\approx$ 0.18 mS cm$^{-1}$ and
$E_\mathrm{a}$ $\approx$ 0.40 eV. This enhancement is attributed to structural
disorder, which flattens the Li site-energy landscape, and to a low formation
energy for Li-interstitial defects, which supplies additional mobile carriers.
We present mixed-anion, amorphous Li--P--O--F phases as promising candidates
for the \ce{Li+}-conducting medium of the inorganic SEI, offering a path
forward for engineering improved battery interfaces.

The interaction of a quantum two-level system with a resonant driving field
results in the emergence of Rabi oscillations, which are the hallmark of a
controlled manipulation of a quantum state on the Bloch sphere. This
all-optical coherent control of solid-state two-level systems is crucial for
quantum applications. In this work we study Rabi oscillations emerging in a
WSe2 monolayer-based quantum dot. The emitter is driven coherently using
picosecond laser pulses to a higher-energy state, while photoluminescence is
probed from the ground state. The theoretical treatment based on a three-level
exciton model reveals the population transfer between the exciton ground and
excited states coupled by Coulomb interaction. Our calculations demonstrate
that the resulting exciton ground state population can be controlled by varying
driving pulse area and detuning which is evidenced by the experimental data.
Our results pave the way towards the coherent control of quantum emitters in
atomically thin semiconductors, a crucial ingredient for monolayer-based
high-performance, on-demand single photon sources.

Spins in solid-state materials, molecules, and other chemical systems have
the potential to impact the fields of quantum sensing, communication,
simulation, and computing. In particular, color centers in diamond, such as
negatively charged nitrogen vacancy (NV$^-$) and silicon vacancy centers
(SiV$^-$), are emerging as quantum platforms poised for transition to
commercial devices. A key enabler stems from the semiconductor-like platform
that can be tailored at the time of growth. The large growth parameter space
makes it challenging to use intuition to optimize growth conditions for quantum
performance. In this paper, we use supervised machine learning to train
regression models using different synthesis parameters in over 100 quantum
diamond samples. We train models to optimize NV$^-$ defects in diamond for high
sensitivity magnetometry. Importantly, we utilize a magnetic-field sensitivity
figure of merit (FOM) for NV magnetometry and use Bayesian optimization to
identify critical growth parameters that lead to a 300% improvement over an
average sample and a 55% improvement over the previous champion sample.
Furthermore, using Shapley importance rankings, we gain new physical insights
into the most impactful growth and post-processing parameters, namely electron
irradiation dose, diamond seed depth relative to the plasma, seed miscut angle,
and reactor nitrogen concentration. As various quantum devices can have
significantly different material requirements, advanced growth techniques such
as plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PE-CVD) can provide the ability
to tailor material development specifically for quantum applications.

Memristors are emerging as key electronic components that retain resistance
states without power. Their non-volatile nature and ability to mimic synaptic
behavior make them ideal for next-generation memory technologies and
neuromorphic computing systems inspired by the human brain. In this study, we
present a novel organic spintronic memristor based on a La0.67Sr0.33MnO3
(LSMO)/poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)/Co heterostructure, exhibiting
biologically inspired synaptic behavior. Driven by fluorine atom migration
within the PVDF layer, the device demonstrates both long-term depression (LTD)
and long-term potentiation (LTP) under controlled electrical polarization.
Distinctively, the resistance states can also be modulated by an external
magnetic field via the tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) effect, introducing a
non-electrical means of tuning synaptic plasticity. This magnetic control
mechanism enables multi-state modulation without compromising device
performance or endurance. Furthermore, convolutional neural network (CNN)
simulations incorporating this magnetic tuning capability reveal enhanced
pattern recognition accuracy and improved training stability, especially at
high learning rates. These findings underscore the potential of organic
spintronic memristors as high-performance, low-power neuromorphic elements,
particularly suited for applications in flexible and wearable electronics.

Luttinger compensated antiferromagnets (LcAFMs), combining spin polarization
with vanishing net magnetization, offering distinct advantages for
next-generation spintronic applications. Using first-principles calculations,
we demonstrate that conventional antiferromagnetic CrCl2 double chains can be
transformed into one-dimensional LcAFMs under an external electric field,
exhibiting pronounced isotropic spin splitting. The magnitude of the splitting,
as well as the band gap, can be effectively tuned by both in-plane and
out-of-plane fields, thereby providing greater controllability than in
two-dimensional counterparts. To further enhance the tunability, we design a
nearly lattice-matched CrCl2/MoTe2 heterostructure and uncover that interfacial
charge transfer generates a built-in electric field, inducing spin splitting
comparable to that driven by external fields. These results establish
interfacial engineering as a highly efficient route to realize and manipulate
LcAFM states in low-dimensional magnets, expanding the design principles for
spintronic functionalities at the nanoscale.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了LightPFP框架，通过知识蒸馏方法利用通用MLIP生成训练数据，避免了昂贵的DFT计算，实现了高效的任务特定MLIP开发。

Atomistic simulation methods have evolved through successive computational
levels, each building upon more fundamental approaches: from quantum mechanics
to density functional theory (DFT), and subsequently, to machine learning
interatomic potentials (MLIPs). While universal MLIPs (u-MLIPs) offer broad
transferability, their computational overhead limits large-scale applications.
Task-specific MLIPs (ts-MLIPs) achieve superior efficiency but require
prohibitively expensive DFT data generation for each material system. In this
paper, we propose LightPFP, a data-efficient knowledge distillation framework.
Instead of using costly DFT calculations, LightPFP generates a distilled
ts-MLIP by leveraging u-MLIP to generate high-quality training data tailored
for specific materials and utilizing a pre-trained light-weight MLIP to further
enhance data efficiency. Across a broad spectrum of materials, including
solid-state electrolytes, high-entropy alloys, and reactive ionic systems,
LightPFP delivers three orders of magnitude faster model development than
conventional DFT-based methods, while maintaining accuracy on par with
first-principles predictions. Moreover, the distilled ts-MLIPs further sustain
the computational efficiency essential for large-scale molecular dynamics,
achieving 1-2 orders of magnitude faster inference than u-MLIPs. The framework
further enables efficient precision transfer learning, where systematic errors
from the u-MLIP can be corrected using as few as 10 high-accuracy DFT data
points, as demonstrated for MgO melting point prediction. This u-MLIP-driven
distillation approach enables rapid development of high-fidelity, efficient
MLIPs for materials science applications.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文展示了如何使用自旋1纳米石墨烯构建具有键交替的自旋1链，探索Haldane相和二聚化相之间的拓扑相变，并提出了两种候选材料来实现不同的拓扑相。

The use of magnetic nanographenes as building blocks for artificial spin
lattices is enabling the exploration of flagship model Hamiltonians of
one-dimensional quantum magnetism with an unprecedented degree of control. The
spin-1 Heisenberg model, incorporating both linear and quadratic exchange
interactions, was first realized using [3]-triangulenes, where the hallmark
Haldane phase with spin fractionalization was observed. Later, the spin-1/2
Heisenberg Hamiltonian with exchange alternation was realized with Clar's
goblets, where two additional topological phases were identified. Here we show
that spin-1 nanographenes can also be used to explore the topological phase
transition between the Haldane phase and a dimerized phase predicted for spin-1
chains with bond-alternation. We first study how the boundary of the phase
transition is modified by non-linear exchange, known to be present in spin-1
nanographenes, using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG). Combining
multiconfigurational with first-principles calculations, we propose two
candidates to realize different topological phases of the model: a recently
synthesized extended Clar's goblet, and a passivated [4]-triangulene. Moreover,
we show how these two phases can be identified experimentally using inelastic
electron tunneling spectroscopy (IETS). This work paves the way for the
experimental realization of these topological phases, which can be locally
probed with scanning tunneling microscopy.

Understanding thermal transport in silicon nanostructures is crucial for
effective thermal management in semiconductor devices. In such nanostructures,
boundary scattering can significantly reduce thermal conductivity. Diffusive
boundary scattering explains the experimentally observed thickness dependence
of thermal conductivity in thin films with thicknesses of tens of nanometers;
however, introducing surface roughness further reduces the thermal
conductivity, which falls far below the theoretical lower limit. In this study,
we calculated the thermal conductivity and phonon transport properties of rough
thin films with thicknesses of up to 25 nm using anharmonic lattice dynamics
and investigated the mechanisms underlying the suppression of thermal
conductivity arising from surface roughness. We found that in ultrathin films
with rough surfaces, thermal conductivity was suppressed by a reduction in
group velocity caused by hybridization with surface-localized modes, as well as
a reduction in relaxation time due to the modulation of the anharmonic
interatomic force constants of surface atoms. The reduction in group velocity
significantly suppressed thermal conductivity across a wide range of
thicknesses and surface-roughness values. In contrast, the reduction in
relaxation time exhibited strong thickness dependence. Thus, this
relaxation-time reduction should be considered in ultrathin films with
roughness of approximately 0.1 nm and thicknesses below 5 nm. These
thermal-conductivity suppression mechanisms due to surface roughness were not
considered in the boundary-scattering model, resulting in an overestimation of
the thermal conductivity of the roughened thin films by up to approximately
100%.

Emerging altermagnets offer a promising avenue for spintronics, yet their
integration into magnetic tunnel junctions has been hindered by reliance on
ferromagnetic electrodes (introducing stray fields) or limited functionality
(non-tunable magnetoresistance without spin filtering). Here, we propose an
all-altermagnetic tunnel junction (AAMTJ) paradigm composed exclusively of
altermagnets-exemplified by experiment-feasible RuO2/NiF2/RuO2. Giant tunneling
magnetoresistance of 11704%, and high spin-filtering of ~90% in both spin
channels are achieved. This architecture unlocks tunable multistate
magnetoresistance and spin filtering via magnetization control of electrode and
barrier, stemming from their synergistic and antagonistic alignments of
momentum-dependent altermagnetic spin-splitting. Our AAMTJ inherently exhibits
low consumption and no stray field, with nonrelativistic spin splitting and
zero magnetic moment, combining advantages of both ferromagnetic and
antiferromagnetic tunnel junctions. This AAMTJ paradigm provides a
realistically versatile platform to develop revolutionarily potential of
altermagnets for reconfigurable magnetic memory devices.

Quantum heat engines are nanoscale devices that convert heat into work by
exploiting quantum effects, such as coherence and interference. Previous
studies of these devices did not consider spin-dependent effects, which can
influence the thermoelectric performance of the engine. In this work, we study
the thermoelectric behavior of a quantum heat engine based on an Aharonov-Bohm
ring - a mesoscopic ring where electrons exhibit interference depending on the
magnetic flux it encloses - incorporating Rashba spin-orbit interaction (SOI),
which couples the electron's motion and spin. We find that Rashba SOI enhances
the figure of merit $ZT$, measure of the engine's conversion efficiency. Our
results suggest that controlling spin-dependent interference could lead to
improvements in the fabrication of efficient thermoelectric devices.

We report magnetic, optical and oxidation states of oxygen deficient
TiO$_{2-\delta}$ nanoparticles (NPs) synthesized by environment-friendly green
route using Phyllanthus niruri (PN) whole plant extract instead of leaf
extract. Rietveld refinement of room temperature XRD pattern confirms the
formation of pure phase anatase TiO$_2$ crystals in a tetragonal structure with
space group I41/amd. TEM and SEM microstructure shows agglomerated spherical
shape NPs exhibiting average particle size $\sim$ 35~nm. FTIR result confirms
the presence of biomolecules and functional group attached to the surface of
TiO$_2$ NPs. The core level XPS of O-1s and Ti-2p confirms the presence of
oxygen vacancies that leads to the mixed oxidation states of Ti (Ti$^{4+}$ and
Ti$^{3+}$). UV-vis result shows a strong absorption peak ($\sim$ 250~nm) along
with reduced optical band gap energy E$_g$ $\sim$ 2.75~eV, possibly arises due
to the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) caused by lower band gap energy emerging
from oxygen vacancies. Magnetization as a function of applied magnetic field
shows ferromagnetic nature at room temperature [M$_S$ $\sim$ 0.029~emu/g and
H$_C$ $\sim$ 0.0143~T]. The observed ferromagnetic behaviour can be understood
by virtual hopping of electrons from Ti$^{3+}$(3d$^1$) to
Ti$^{4+}$(3d$^0$)-sites, however, vice versa is prohibited.

The strain states of the components of pseudomorphic superlattices can be
accurately modeled analytically through the application of linear elasticity.
In this particular case of GaN/AlN 'free-standing' superlattices, the
predictions derived from elastic modeling have been compared with total energy
calculations of several systems made of components with varying thicknesses. We
demonstrate that the elastic predictions for the lattice constants of the
components align with the values obtained from their total energy counterparts,
within the limits of computational errors and uncertainties. Furthermore, a
phenomenological analysis of the elastic energy stored in the superlattices
facilitates the evaluation of the excess energies associated with the
interfaces present in these systems. The results mentioned above are briefly
contrasted with findings reported in previous literature.

### Paradoxical Topological Soliton Lattice in Anisotropic Frustrated Chiral Magnets

Two-dimensional chiral magnets are known to host a variety of skyrmions,
characterized by an integer topological charge. However, these systems
typically favor uniform lattices as a thermodynamically stable phase composed
of either skyrmions (Q = -1) or antiskyrmions (Q = 1). In isotropic chiral
magnets, skyrmion-antiskyrmion coexistence is typically transient due to mutual
annihilation, making the observation of a stable, long-range ordered lattice a
significant challenge. Here, we address this challenge by demonstrating a
skyrmion-antiskyrmion lattice as a magnetic field-induced topological ground
state in chiral magnets with competing anisotropic interactions, specifically
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya and frustrated exchange interactions. This unique lattice
exhibits a net-zero global topological charge due to the balanced populations
of skyrmions and antiskyrmions. Furthermore, density functional theory and
spin-lattice simulations identify 2Fe/InSb(110) as an ideal candidate material
for realizing this phase. This finding reveals new possibilities for
manipulating magnetic solitons and establishes anisotropic frustrated chiral
magnets as a promising material class for future spintronic applications.

### Magnetoelectric effect of multiferroic metals

Much is known about the magnetoelectric effect of multiferroic insulators,
yet little is understood about multiferroic metals. In this work, we employ
first-principles calculations to identify the sliding van der Waals bilayer
$1T$-NbTe$_2$ as a multiferroic metal, where in-plane metallicity coexists with
out-of-plane polarization and magnetism. It exhibits linear magnetoelectric
response, originating from direct spin-charge interactions as a result of
external field-modulated Fermi energy, which differs from the
spin-charge-lattice or spin-orbit coupling mechanisms in multiferroic
insulators. We derive a universal formula for magnetoelectric coupling
parameters of multiferroic metals, which highlights the crucial role of
interlayer dielectric permittivity in enhancing performance. Our work provides
insights for exploring magnetoelectric coupling mechanisms and designing
functional materials with strong magnetoelectric coupling.

### Switching between Skyrmions and Yoshimori Spin Spirals via Li Absorption in Janus Magnets

Chiral magnetic textures have attracted considerable attention owing to their
topological properties and potential applications in spintronic devices. Here,
we employ first-principles calculations together with atomic spin dynamics
simulations to explore the switching between skyrmions and Yoshimori-type spin
spirals induced by Li adsorption in Janus two-dimensional (2D) CrTeSe. We show
that selective Li adsorption on either the Se- or Te-terminated surface
stabilizes distinct magnetic phases: Li adsorption on the Se side favors a
Yoshimori-type spin spiral, whereas adsorption on the Te side stabilizes the
skyrmionic state. This contrast originates from site-dependent modifications of
exchange interactions, magnetic anisotropy (MA), and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
interaction (DMI). In addition, the response of magnetic textures to
out-of-plane magnetic fields differs strongly between the two systems. These
results demonstrate that surface adsorption provides an effective strategy for
reversible control of chiral magnetic states in 2D magnets, while also offering
fundamental insights into the competing interactions that govern the stability
of skyrmions and Yoshimori spin spirals. Our findings highlight the potential
of Janus 2D materials as a versatile platform for engineering tunable
spintronic devices.

### Bidirectional Photoinduced Carrier Transfer in Fluorinated Quasi-2D Perovskites Governing Enhanced Photocurrent Generation

Quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) metal halide perovskites exhibit rich phase
heterogeneity that profoundly influences light-matter interactions and charge
transport. However, the fundamental mechanisms governing carrier transfer
across distinct phases remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate effective
electron-hole separation in fluorinated multilayered quasi-2D perovskite films
nominally prepared for three layers, using femtosecond transient absorption
spectroscopy. The films are revealed to comprise a heterogeneous phase
distribution (with 1, 2, 3 layers and bulk) naturally stacked along the growth
direction. Our ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements, show
the type-two band alignment between the small-n (layer number) phases and the
bulk. This alignment drives charge separation via both direct and sequential
carrier transfer mechanisms, whereby electrons preferentially migrate into the
bulk domains while holes accumulate in the small-n layers, extending even to
single layer phase-a process only rarely observed in previous studies. The
nearly symmetric transfer times of electrons and holes yield an efficient and
balanced spatial separation of carriers. Global target analysis employing a
carrier transfer model quantitatively reproduces the spectral evolution,
providing a rigorous validation of the mechanism. Nonetheless, we found
photocurrent enhancement in the diode devices of this quasi-2D perovskite as a
consequence of the efficient transfer of photocarriers in the opposite
directions. This work delivers a comprehensive picture of interphase charge
transfer in fluorinated quasi-2D perovskites and highlights strategies to
engineer directional separation pathways for high-performance photovoltaic,
optoelectronic, and quantum devices.

Pt-Sr binary intermetallics encompass a broad range of stoichiometries and
crystal structures, stabilized by complex bonding and multivalent chemistry.
The Sr-rich end member, PtSr5, is recently identified via
artificial-intelligence-guided materials design as a body-centered tetragonal
compound (I4/m). Using first-principles calculations, we show that PtSr5 hosts
a Dirac semimetal phase with trivial Z2 topology, classified as a normal Dirac
semimetal. A symmetry-indicator analysis based on parity eigenvalues at the
eight time-reversal-invariant momenta confirms that all Z2 invariants-evaluated
on time-reversal-invariant two-dimensional subspaces of momentum space with a
direct band gap-are trivial, thereby establishing the topologically trivial
nature of the Dirac semimetal phase. Nonetheless, our calculations reveal that
applying an external Zeeman magnetic field along the z-axis drives the system
into a Weyl semimetal phase, as corroborated by characteristic changes in the
computed surface states. This work demonstrates the tunability of topological
phases in PtSr5 via external perturbations and highlights the effectiveness of
AI-based materials exploration in discovering new quantum materials.

A theoretical study of a number of properties of A2CrH6 (where A = Ba, Sr,
and Ca) hydride perovskites with the Cambridge Serial Total Energy Package
(CASTEP). These include structural, hydrogen storage, mechanical, phonon,
thermodynamic, electronic, and optical properties. The lattice constants of the
compounds studied are in the range from 7.220 {\AA} to 8.082 {\AA}, and they
exhibit stable cubic crystal structures. Negative formation energies, elastic
constants, phonon dispersion and AIMD simulations testify to their
thermodynamic, mechanical, dynamic and thermal stability, respectively. For the
perovskite hydrides Ba2CrH6, Sr2CrH6 and Ca2CrH6, the corresponding specific
hydrogen storage capacities are 1.82 wt.%, 2.69 wt.%, and 4.37 wt.%,
respectively. Among these compounds, Sr2CrH6 exhibits the lowest applicable
hydrogen desorption temperature, at 463.7 K. The electronic bands show
remarkable spin activity, demonstrating that the change of A2+ cation (where A
= Ca, Sr, and Ba) immediately influences the spin polarization and electronic
behavior of hydride perovskites. On the basis of the elastic moduli studied,
the mechanical behavior determines that Ca2CrH6 is the strongest material. The
present results highlight the potential of A2CrH6 (A = Ca, Sr, and Ba)
perovskite hydrides, in particular Ca2CrH6, for applications in advanced energy
systems and hydrogen storage, as well as for electrical and optoelectronic
devices.

Large-scale datasets have enabled highly accurate machine learning
interatomic potentials (MLIPs) for general-purpose heterogeneous catalysis
modeling. There are, however, some limitations in what can be treated with
these potentials because of gaps in the underlying training data. To extend
these capabilities, we introduce AQCat25, a complementary dataset of 13.5
million density functional theory (DFT) single point calculations designed to
improve the treatment of systems where spin polarization and/or higher fidelity
are critical. We also investigate methodologies for integrating new datasets,
such as AQCat25, with the broader Open Catalyst 2020 (OC20) dataset to create
spin-aware models without sacrificing generalizability. We find that directly
tuning a general model on AQCat25 leads to catastrophic forgetting of the
original dataset's knowledge. Conversely, joint training strategies prove
effective for improving accuracy on the new data without sacrificing general
performance. This joint approach introduces a challenge, as the model must
learn from a dataset containing both mixed-fidelity calculations and
mixed-physics (spin-polarized vs. unpolarized). We show that explicitly
conditioning the model on this system-specific metadata, for example by using
Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM), successfully addresses this challenge
and further enhances model accuracy. Ultimately, our work establishes an
effective protocol for bridging DFT fidelity domains to advance the predictive
power of foundational models in catalysis.

It is now well established that a laser pulse can demagnetize a
  ferromagnet. However, for a long time, it has not had an analytic
  theory because it falls into neither nonlinear optics (NLO) nor
  magnetism. Here we attempt to fill this gap by developing a
  nonlinear optical theory centered on the spin moment, instead of
  the more popular susceptibility. We first employ group theory to
  pin down the lowest order of the nonzero spin moment in a
  centrosymmetric system to be the second order, where the
  second-order density matrix contains four terms of sum frequency
  generation (SFG) and four terms of difference frequency generation
  (DFG). By tracing over the product of the density matrix and the
  spin matrix, we are now able to compute the light-induced spin
  moment. We apply our theory to FePt and FePd, two most popular
  magnetic recording materials with identical crystal and electronic
  structures. We find that the theory can clearly distinguish the
  difference between those two similar systems. Specifically, we
  show that FePt has a stronger light-induced spin moment than FePd,
  in agreement with our real-time ultrafast demagnetization
  simulation and the experimental results. Among all the possible
  NLO processes, DFGs produce the largest spin moment change, a
  manifestation of optical rectification. Our research lays a solid
  theoretical foundation for femtomagnetism, so the light-induced spin moment
reduction can now be computed and compared among
  different systems, without time-consuming real-time calculations,
  representing a significant step forward.

Molecular zero-dimensional (0D) halide perovskite-inspired cesium copper
iodide (Cs3Cu2I5) is a highly promising candidate for optoelectronic
applications due to their low toxicity, high stability, and intense blue
emission. However, their intrinsically poor electrical conductivity, stemming
from isolated conductive copper iodide tetrahedra by cesium atoms, severely
limits charge transport which poses a critical challenge for optoelectronic
applications. In this study, we propose a novel strategy to overcome this
limitation by utilizing precisely optimized zinc oxide nanoripple structures
within a lateral Cs3Cu2I5 photodetector (PD) architecture featuring
interdigitated electrodes (IDEs). The ZnO nanoripple was systematically tuned
to improve the percolation paths, providing efficient routes for photogenerated
carriers to migrate to the IDEs. Consequently, the optimized heterojunctions
comprising Cs3Cu2I5 and ZnO exhibited superior photocurrent compared to the
pristine Cs3Cu2I5 counterparts. This nanostructure-mediated charge transport
engineering strategy for lateral structured PDs offers a new pathway for
utilizing low-conductivity 0D materials for conventional optoelectronics,
next-generation Internet of Things sensor networks, and plausibly biosensing
applications.

Argyrodite-type Ag-based sulfides combine exceptionally low lattice thermal
and high ionic conductivity, making them promising candidates for
thermoelectric and solid-state energy applications. In this work, we studied
Ag8TS6 (T= Si, Ge, Sn) argyrodite family by combining chemical-bonding
analysis, lattice vibrational properties simulation, and experimental
measurements to investigate their structural and thermal transport properties.
Furthermore, we propose a two-channel lattice-dynamics model based on
Gr\"uneisen-derived phonon lifetimes and compare it to an approach using
machine-learned interatomic potentials. Both approaches are able to predict
thermal conductivity in agreement with experimental lattice thermal
conductivities along the whole temperature range, highlighting their potential
suitability for future high-throughput predictions. Our findings also reveal a
relationship between bond heterogeneity arising from weakly bonded Ag+ ions and
occupied antibonding states in Ag-S and Ag-Ag interactions and strong
anharmonicity, including large Gr\"uneisen parameters, and low sound
velocities, which are responsible for the low lattice thermal conductivity of
Ag8SnS6, Ag8GeS6, and Ag8SiS6. We furthermore show that thermal and ionic
conductivities in all three compounds are independent of each other and can

- **TL;DR**: 通过双谐波静电力显微镜和扫描微波阻抗显微镜揭示了应变工程WS2薄片中复杂的界面条件，发现了应变诱导带隙增大与电导率测量矛盾，并证实这是由于尖端加载力引起的动态起皱效应。

The delicate interfacial conditions and behaviors play critical roles in
determining the valuable physical properties of two-dimensional materials and
their heterostructures on substrates. However, directly probing these complex
interface conditions remains challenging. Here, we reveal the complex in-plane
strain and out-of-plane bonding interface conditions in strain-engineered WS2
flakes by combined dual-harmonic electrostatic force microscopy (DH-EFM) and
scanning microwave impedance microscopy (sMIM). A significant contradiction is
observed between the intrinsically compressive-strain-induced larger bandgap
(lower electrical conductivity) detected by DH-EFM, and the higher electrical
conductivity measured by sMIM. Comparative electrical conductivity measurements
under different sMIM modes demonstrate that this contradiction arises from the
tip-loading-force-induced dynamic puckering effect, which is modulated by
interfacial bonding strength. Furthermore, the accumulation and release of
electrical conductivity during forward/backward sMIM-contact measurements
further confirmed the dynamic puckering effect, revealing the difference in
interface conditions between open ring and closed ring regions of WS2. This
work resolves the correlation between electrical properties and interface
conditions, providing insights for interface-engineered devices.

- **TL;DR**: 开发了一种物理信息扩散方法，通过嵌入紧凑性和局部环境多样性描述符来平衡物理合理性与结构新颖性，显著提高了生成晶体结构的多样性，并与晶体结构预测(CSP)形成协同效应。

Discovering materials with previously unreported crystal frameworks is key to
achieving transformative functionality. Generative artificial intelligence
offers a scalable means to propose candidate crystal structures, however
existing approaches mainly reproduce decorated variants of established motifs
rather than uncover new configurations. Here we develop a physics-informed
diffusion method, supported by chemically grounded validation protocol, which
embeds descriptors of compactness and local environment diversity to balance
physical plausibility with structural novelty. Conditioning on these metrics
improves generative performance across architectures, increasing the fraction
of structures outside 100 most common prototypes up to 67%. When crystal
structure prediction (CSP) is seeded with generative structures, most
candidates (97%) are reconstructed by CSP, yielding 145 (66%) low-energy
frameworks not matching any known prototypes. These results show that while
generative models are not substitutes for CSP, their chemically informed,
diversity-guided outputs can enhance CSP efficiency, establishing a practical
generative-CSP synergy for discovery-oriented exploration of chemical space.

### A platform for zero-field isolated skyrmions: 4$d$/Co atomic bilayers on Re(0001)

- **TL;DR**: 通过第一性原理DFT和原子自旋模拟，在Rh/Co、Pd/Co和Ru/Co三种4d/Co原子双层结构中实现了零场孤立斯格明子，其中Rh/Co和Pd/Co在Re(0001)衬底上能自发形成稳定的纳米尺度斯格明子。

Using first-principles density functional theory (DFT) combined with
atomistic spin simulations, we explore the possibility of realizing zero-field
isolated skyrmions in three 4$d$/Co atomic bilayers -- Rh/Co, Pd/Co, and Ru/Co
-- grown on the Re(0001) surface. Our investigation employs an extended
atomistic spin model, which goes beyond the standard model by including the
multi-spin higher-order exchange interactions (HOI) in addition to the
Heisenberg pairwise exchange interaction, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction
(DMI), and magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE). All magnetic
interactions of the extended spin model are calculated using DFT. The phase
diagram obtained from atomistic spin simulations based on this spin model for
Rh/Co and Pd/Co on Re(0001) reveals that isolated skyrmions emerge
spontaneously on the ferromagnetic background even in the absence of an
external magnetic field. The radius of zero-field isolated skyrmions in
Rh/Co/Re(0001) is around 6 nm, whereas the radius of those skyrmions in
Pd/Co/Re(0001) is about 12 nm. Transition-state theory calculations show that
the skyrmions are protected by substantial energy barriers, approximately 150
meV, which predominantly arise from DMI, with a small contribution from the HOI
interactions. The height of the barriers suggests that skyrmions could be
observed in low-temperature experiments. Based on this work, we propose 4$d$/Co
bilayers on Re(0001) as a new platform to realize nanoscale zero-field isolated
skyrmions.

- **TL;DR**: 通过32种非晶态Li-M-X体系的原子模拟，建立了非晶固态电解质的设计原则，识别了四种结构类型和两种有利的传输机制，揭示了氧化物和氟化物在电化学和水解稳定性方面的优势，并提出了体模量作为锂离子迁移率的简单预测指标。

Amorphous solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) offer unique advantages for
next-generation batteries, but their rational design is hindered by an unclear
structure-property relationship. This study establishes universal design
principles through atomistic simulations of 32 amorphous Li-M-X systems (M = B,
Al, Si, P; X = F, Cl, Br, I, O, S, Se, N). We identify four structure types
governed by a rule that saturated M-X groups with more negative charges
preferentially form M-X-M chains, identify paddle-wheel and cooperative
migration as two favorable transport mechanisms that are significantly enhanced
in amorphous structures. We also pinpoint Oxides and fluorides as optimal for
electrochemical and hydrolytic stability, and reveal bulk modulus as a simple
predictor for $Li^+$ mobility. These insights are integrated into a practical
design diagram, providing a novel and valuable framework for advancing
high-performance amorphous SSEs.

We propose a general strategy for enhancing the anomalous Nernst coefficient
based on the Sommerfeld-Bethe relation. This approach provides a systematic
framework for understanding the small anomalous Nernst coefficients typically
observed in ferromagnets and identifies conditions under which substantial
enhancements can be realized. We further introduce simplified models that
exhibit large Nernst coefficients as offering illustrative examples.

- **TL;DR**: 本文提出了一种在VASP中实现任意电场下超胞DFT计算的实现方法，通过VASP-Python接口应用用户自定义电场，并讨论了能量和力的必要修正。

Introducing electric fields into density functional theory (DFT) calculations
is essential for understanding electrochemical processes, interfacial
phenomena, and the behavior of materials under applied bias. However, applying
user-defined electrostatic potentials in DFT is nontrivial and often requires
direct modification to the specific DFT code. In this work, we present an
implementation for supercell DFT calculations under arbitrary electric fields
and discuss the required corrections to the energies and forces. The
implementation is realized through the recently released VASP-Python interface,
enabling the application of user-defined fields directly within the standard
VASP software and providing great flexibility and control. We demonstrate the
application of this approach with diverse case studies, including molecular
adsorption on electrified surfaces, field ion microscopy, electrochemical
solid-water interfaces, and implicit solvent models.

- **TL;DR**: 开发了TribChem软件的FAIR工具，将DFT模拟结果转换为符合FAIR原则的数据集，包含数据生成和检索两个工具，支持与公共存储库集成。

The increasing complexity and volume of data generated by high-throughput
computational materials science require robust tools to ensure their
accessibility, reproducibility, and reuse. In particular, integrating the FAIR
Guiding Principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) into
computational workflows is essential to enable open science practices. TribChem
is an open source Python software developed for the automated simulation of
solid-solid interfaces using density functional theory (DFT). While TribChem
already incorporates several FAIR-aligned features, we present here a dedicated
FAIR utility designed to transform TribChem results into FAIR-compliant
datasets. This utility comprises two tools: fair_data.py, which automatically
generates standardized machine- and human-readable outputs from the TribChem
database, and retrieve_data.py, which facilitates efficient data extraction
through a keyword-based interface. In this paper we show the capabilities of
the fair utility with examples for bulk, surface, and interface systems. The
implementation allows seamless integration with public repositories such as
Zenodo, paving the way for reproducible research and fostering data-driven
materials discovery.

- **TL;DR**: 本文通过第一性原理计算研究了高性能half-Heusler合金NbFeSb的电子和热电输运性质，开发了高效准确的计算方法，显著降低了计算成本。

We perform an ab initio computational investigation of the electronic and
thermoelectric transport properties of one of the best performance half-Heusler
(HH) alloys, NbFeSb. We use Boltzmann Transport equation while taking into
account the full energy/momentum/band dependence of all relevant electronic
scattering rates, i.e. with acoustic phonons, non-polar optical phonons (intra-
and inter-valley), polar optical phonons (POP), and ionized impurity scattering
(IIS). We use a highly efficient and accurate computational approach, where the
scattering rates are derived using only a few ab initio extracted matrix
elements, while we account fully for intra-/inter valley/band transitions,
screening from both electrons and holes, and bipolar transport effects. Our
computed thermoelectric power-factor (PF) values show good agreement with
experiments across densities and temperatures, while they indicate the upper
limit of PF performance for this material. We show that the polar optical
phonon and ionized impurity scattering (importantly including screening),
influence significantly the transport properties, whereas the computationally
expensive non-polar phonon scattering part (acoustic and non-polar optical) is
somewhat weaker, especially for electrons, and at lower to intermediate
temperatures. This insight is relevant in the study of half-Heusler and other
polar thermoelectric materials in general. Although we use NbFeSb as an
example, the method we employ is material agnostic and can be broadly applied
efficiently for electronic and thermoelectric materials in general, with more
than 10x reduction in computational cost compared to fully ab initio methods,
while retaining ab-initio accuracy.

### dynsight: an Open Python Platform for Simulation and Experimental Trajectory Data Analysis

- **TL;DR**: Dynsight是一个开源的Python平台，用于简化和整合从模拟或实验轨迹数据中提取和分析时间序列数据的工作流程。

The study of complex many-body systems through the analysis of the
trajectories of dynamically moving and interacting units is a non-trivial task.
The workflow for extracting meaningful information from raw trajectory data
typically involves several interconnected steps: (i) identifying and tracking
objects, and resolving their trajectories (for example, in experimental systems
where these are not automatically available as in molecular simulations); (ii)
translating the trajectories into data that are easier to handle and analyze
using suitable descriptors; and (iii) extracting meaningful information from
these data. Each of these tasks often requires substantial programming skills,
the use of different types of representations or methods, and the development
of interfaces between them. Despite the progress made by new tools targeting
individual steps, integrating them under a common framework would lower the
barrier to use (especially for diverse communities of users), reduce
fragmentation, and ultimately facilitate the development of new approaches in
trajectory data analysis. To this end, we introduce dynsight, an open Python
platform that streamlines the extraction and analysis of time-series data from
simulation or experimentally resolved trajectories. Dynsight simplifies
workflows, enhances accessibility, and supports the analysis of time-series and
trajectory data to unravel the dynamic complexity of systems across different
scales. Dynsight is open source (available at github.com/GMPavanLab/dynsight)
and can be easily installed using pip.

We developed DeFecT-FF, a framework for predicting the energies and
ground-state configurations of native point defects, extrinsic dopants,
impurities, and defect complexes in zincblende-phase Cd/Zn-Te/Se/S compounds
relevant to CdTe-based solar cells. The framework combines high-throughput DFT
data with crystal graph-based machine learning force fields (MLFFs) trained to
reproduce DFT energies and forces. Alloying at Cd or Te sites offers a route to
tune the electronic and defect properties of CdTe absorbers for improved solar
efficiency. Given the vast number of possible defect types, charge states, and
symmetry-breaking configurations, traditional DFT approaches are
computationally prohibitive. Our dataset includes GGA-PBE and HSE06-optimized
structures for bulk, alloyed, interface, and grain-boundary systems. Using
active learning, we expanded the dataset and trained MLFFs to accurately
predict energies across charge states. The model enabled rapid screening and
discovery of new low-energy defect configurations, validated through HSE06
calculations with spin-orbit coupling. The DeFecT-FF framework is publicly
available as a nanoHUB tool, allowing users to upload crystallographic files,
automatically generate defects, and compute defect formation energies versus
Fermi level and chemical potentials, greatly reducing the need for expensive
DFT simulations.
