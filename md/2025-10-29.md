### Surface Binding Energies for Amorphous Plagioclase Feldspar Calculated using Molecular Dynamics

- **TL;DR**: 使用分子动力学模拟研究无定形和结晶斜长石表面元素溅射的结合能差异，发现虽然平均结合能相似，但无定形结构具有更宽的结合能分布，而溅射产额差异很小（&lt;10-20%）。

Despite the well-established presence of amorphous compounds on planetary
bodies such as the Moon and Mercury due to space weathering, the direct effect
of atomic arrangement on the surface binding energies (SBEs) of elements on
these bodies remains largely unexplored. Accurate SBE values are essential for
reliably predicting sputtering yields and the energy distribution of ejecta.
Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations to quantify SBEs for the different
elements sputtered from amorphous atomic arrangements of the plagioclase
feldspar end members, albite and anorthite, and compare to their crystalline
counterparts. Results show that while the mean elemental SBEs from amorphous
surfaces are not significantly different from their crystalline counterparts,
the random orientation in amorphous structures gives rise to a spectrum of
bonding configurations, resulting in a distribution of SBEs with a wider range.
This contrasts with the clearly discretized set of SBE values associated with
the ordered atomic structure of crystalline surfaces. We then consider
sputtering by H, He, and a solar wind combination of 96% H and 4% He. For each
of these cases, we demonstrate that there is minimal difference (&lt;10% for
albite and &lt;20% for anorthite) between the sputtering yields of amorphous and
crystalline surfaces. We attribute these results to the presence of the same
elemental bonds across different atomic arrangements, which leads to similar
mean SBEs and, consequently, comparable sputtering yields.

- **TL;DR**: 本文研究了高形式对称性的 onsiteability 条件，提出了 onsiteability 与高形式规范化的等价性，特别针对 (2+1)D 中的有限 1-形式对称性给出了具体的代数条件。

An internal symmetry in a lattice model is said to be onsiteable if it can be
disentangled into an onsite action by introducing ancillas and conjugating with
a finite-depth circuit. A standard lore holds that onsiteability is equivalent
to being anomaly-free, which is indeed valid for finite 0-form symmetries in
(1+1)D. However, for higher-form symmetries, these notions become inequivalent:
a symmetry may be onsite while still anomalous. In this work, we clarify the
conditions for onsiteability of higher-form symmetries by proposing an
equivalence between onsiteability and the possibility of $higher$ gauging. For
a finite 1-form symmetry in (2+1)D, we show that the symmetry is onsiteable if
and only if its 't Hooft anomaly satisfies a specific algebraic condition that
ensures the symmetry can be 1-gauged. We further demonstrate that onsiteable
1-form symmetry in (2+1)D can always be brought into transversal Pauli
operators by ancillas and circuit conjugation. In generic dimensions, we derive
necessary conditions for onsiteability using lattice 't Hooft anomaly of
higher-form symmetry, and conjecture a general equivalence between
onsiteability and possibility of higher gauging on lattices.

### Exact nematic and mixed magnetic phases driven by competing orders on the pyrochlore lattice

- **TL;DR**: 该论文研究了焦绿石磁体中的J_{z±}模型，发现了在特定参数下会出现混合磁相和新型向列相，这是首次在焦绿石磁体中实现具有两个不同序参量的q=0长程有序相。

Pyrochlore magnets are a paradigmatic example of three-dimensional frustrated
systems and provide an excellent platform for studying a variety of exotic
many-body phenomena, including spin liquids, nematic phases, fragmentation, and
order by disorder. In recent years, increasing attention has been devoted to
bilinear spin models on this lattice, where multiple magnetic phases can be
degenerate in energy, often stabilizing unconventional magnetic states. In this
work, we focus on one such model, parametrized by the interaction coupling
$J_{z\pm}$, which defines a line in parameter space corresponding to the phase
boundary between three distinct magnetic phases. Using a combination of
analytical and numerical methods, we show that this model exhibits an
order-by-disorder mechanism at low temperatures, giving rise to a \emph{mixed}
magnetic phase. This represents the first realization of a $\mathbf{q}=0$
long-range-ordered phase in a pyrochlore magnet characterized by two distinct
order parameters, which we denote as the $A_2 \oplus \psi_2$ phase.
Furthermore, at $J_{z\pm} = 1/\sqrt{2}$, the model acquires a subextensive
number of discrete symmetries, which preclude the stabilization of conventional
long-range order and instead lead to the emergence of a novel nematic phase. We
characterize this nematic phase, describe how its ground-state configurations
are constructed, and analyze its stability at higher temperatures and under
small deviations from $J_{z\pm} = 1/\sqrt{2}$.

- **TL;DR**: 在监控相互作用Majorana费米子的测量诱导相变中，当纠缠从体积律到面积律转变时，量子混沌被抑制，这导致场论中的某个质量项消失，使得相变可能对应于非相互作用临界点。

At a generic volume- to area-law entanglement transition in a many-body
system, quantum chaos is arrested. We argue that this tends to imply the
vanishing of a certain "mass" term in the field theory of the
measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT) for monitored, interacting
fermions. To explore this idea, we consider the MIPT with no conserved
quantities that describes 1D monitored, interacting Majorana fermions in class
DIII. We conjecture that the MIPT is the noninteracting DIII one in this case;
the volume-law phase arises through the dangerously irrelevant mass. We propose
numerical tests of our conjecture and analytically identify a candidate
noninteracting critical point.

### Hybrid Neural Interpolation of a Sequence of Wind Flows

- **TL;DR**: 开发了一种混合神经插值方法，结合Tucker张量分解和神经网络，用于快速预测城市风场，在保持高精度(R²&gt;0.99)的同时显著减少训练时间。

Rapid and accurate urban wind field prediction is essential for modeling
particle transport in emergency scenarios. Traditional Computational Fluid
Dynamics (CFD) approaches are too slow for real-time applications,
necessitating surrogate models. We develop a hybrid neural interpolation method
for constructing surrogate models that can update urban wind maps on timescales
aligned with meteorological variations.
  Our approach combines Tucker tensor decomposition with neural networks to
interpolate Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) solutions across varying
inlet wind angles. The method decomposes high-dimensional velocity, pressure,
and eddy viscosity field datasets into a core tensor and factor matrices, then
uses Fourier interpolation for angular modes and k-nearest neighbors
convolution for spatial interpolation. A neural network correction mitigates
interpolation artifacts while preserving physical consistency.
  We validate the approach on a simple cylinder-sphere configuration and,
relative to a strong pure neural network benchmark, achieve comparable or
improved accuracy ($R^2 &gt; 0.99$) with significantly reduced training time. The
pure NN remains a feasible reference model; the hybrid provides an accelerated
approximate alternative that suppresses spurious oscillations, maintains wake
dynamics, and demonstrates computational efficiency suitable for real-time
urban wind simulation.

### Tailoring Superconductivity with Two-Level Systems

We investigate the impact of two-level systems (TLSs) on superconductivity,
treating them as soft modes localised in real space. We show that these defects
can either enhance or suppress the superconducting critical temperature,
depending on their surface density and average frequency. Using thin-film
aluminium as a case study, we quantitatively describe how TLSs modify both the
critical temperature and the zero-temperature superconducting gap. Our results
thus highlight new opportunities for tailoring material properties through TLS
engineering.

### Benchmarking a foundation potential against quantum chemistry methods for predicting molecular redox potentials

Computational high-throughput virtual screening is essential for identifying
redox-active molecules for sustainable applications such as electrochemical
carbon capture. A primary challenge in this approach is the high computational
cost associated with accurate quantum chemistry calculations. Machine learning
foundation potentials (FPs) trained on extensive density functional theory
(DFT) calculations offer a computationally efficient alternative. Here, we
benchmark the MACE-OMol-0 FP against a hierarchy of DFT functionals for
predicting experimental molecular redox potentials for both electron transfer
(ET) and proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) reactions. We find that
MACE-OMol achieves exceptional accuracy for PCET processes, rivaling its target
DFT method. However, its performance is diminished for ET reactions,
particularly for multi-electron transfers involving reactive ions that are
underrepresented in the OMol25 training data, revealing a key
out-of-distribution limitation. To overcome this, we propose an optimal hybrid
workflow that uses the FP for efficient geometry optimization and
thermochemical analysis, followed by a crucial single-point DFT energy
refinement and an implicit solvation correction. This pragmatic approach
provides a robust and scalable strategy for accelerating high-throughput
virtual screening in sustainable chemistry.

### Metallic Electro-Optic Effect in Twisted Double-Bilayer Graphene

- **TL;DR**: 在扭曲双层石墨烯中发现了一种基于贝里曲率和轨道磁矩相互作用的新型电光机制，该机制在C3z对称系统中产生巨大的线性磁电响应和可调谐太赫兹二色性。

Recent theoretical advances have highlighted the role of Bloch state
intrinsic properties in enabling unconventional electro-optic (EO) phenomena in
bulk metals, offering novel strategies for dynamic optical control in quantum
materials. Here, we identify an alternative EO mechanism in bulk metallic
systems that arises from the interplay between Berry curvature and the orbital
magnetic moment of Bloch electrons. Focusing on twisted double-bilayer graphene
(TDBG), we show that the enhanced intrinsic properties of moir\'e Bloch bands
give rise to a sizable linear magnetoelectric EO response, a first-order,
electric-field-induced non-Hermitian correction to the gyrotropic magnetic
susceptibility. This mechanism dominates in $C_{3z}$-symmetric TDBG, where EO
contributions originating from the Berry curvature dipole (BCD) are
symmetry-forbidden. Our calculations reveal giant, gate-tunable linear and
circular dichroism in the terahertz regime, establishing a robust and tunable
platform for ultrafast EO modulation in two-dimensional materials beyond the
BCD paradigm.

### Variational Calculations of the Excited States of the Charged NV-center in Diamond Using a Hybrid Functional

- **TL;DR**: 使用HSE06杂化密度泛函计算金刚石中NV-缺陷的激发电子态，包括三重态和两个最低单重态，结构弛豫效应也被考虑，结果与实验值吻合良好。

The excited electronic states involved in the optical cycle preparation of a
pure spin state of the negatively charged NV-defect in diamond are calculated
using the HSE06 hybrid density functional and variational optimization of the
orbitals. This includes the energy of the excited triplet as well as the two
lowest singlet states with respect to the ground triplet state. In addition to
the vertical excitation, the effect of structural relaxation is also estimated
using analytical atomic forces. The lowering of the energy in the triplet
excited state and the resulting zero-phonon line triplet excitation energy are
both within 0.1 eV of the experimental estimates. An analogous relaxation in
the lower energy singlet state using spin purified atomic forces is estimated
to be 0.06 eV. These results, obtained with a hybrid density functional,
improve on previously published results using local and semi-local functionals,
which are known to underestimate the band gap. The good agreement with
experimental estimates demonstrates how time-independent variational
calculations of excited states using density functionals can give accurate
results and, thereby, provide a powerful screening tool for identifying other
defect systems as candidates for quantum technologies.

### Observation of a pronounced Hebel-Slichter peak in the spin-lattice relaxation rate and implications for gap and pairing symmetry in LaNiGa$_2$

- **TL;DR**: 在LaNiGa2拓扑晶体超导体中观测到明显的Hebel-Slichter相干峰，这与之前提出的非酉三重态配对模型不符，数据更符合两带单重态BCS配对模型。

We report a pronounced Hebel-Slichter coherence peak in the zero field
nuclear quadrupolar resonance (NQR) spin-lattice relaxation rate of the
topological crystalline superconductor LaNiGa$_2$ in the superconducting state.
Previously, a two-band internally antisymmetric non-unitary triplet pairing
(INT) state was proposed for this system, with equal spin-pairing and two
distinct gaps associated with different spins. A detailed examination of the
temperature dependence of the NQR data shows that the data best fit an INT
model if the two gaps are equal and the model is unitary. Even a tiny
non-unitarity with two unequal gaps causes the coherence peak to diminish
rapidly and deviate from the data. On the other hand, the data are well-fit by
a two-band singlet BCS-like pairing with two distinct gaps consistent with
previous measurements. This raises doubts on the identification of non-unitary
triplet-pairing with time-reversal symmetry breaking in this material.

### Atomic and electronic structure of poly-[Ni(Salen)]: combined study by XPS, UV PES, NEXAFS and DFT methods

A detailed study of poly-[Ni(Salen)] polymer in its oxidized (Ox) and reduced
(Red) states was conducted using X-ray photoelectron (XPS) and ultraviolet
photoemission (UV PES) spectroscopy, near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure
(NEXAFS) spectroscopy, and quantum-chemical calculations. XPS analysis revealed
significant energy shifts (-1.5 to -1.8 eV) and broadening of the PE lines for
all atoms upon polymerization, indicating a major redistribution of valence
electron density between the monomer fragments. In the oxidized polymer, new
features in the Ni 2p and O 1s PE spectra were associated with the formation of
polarons with weakened Ni-O bonds; this effect diminished upon reduction as the
number of polarons decreased. Quantum-chemical calculations attributed the
valence band broadening to enhanced C 2p contributions from $\pi$-conjugation
between monomers. NEXAFS spectroscopy confirmed the stability of the
ethylenediamine fragment and the direct involvement of the phenolic rings of
the salen ligand in polymerization, also revealing a partial weakening and
incomplete restoration of the $\pi$ bonding between O and Ni atoms upon
reduction. Furthermore, it was shown that it is the $BF_{4}^-$ anions that
weaken the Ni-O bonds during oxidation, which are partially preserved in the
reduced state.

### Group word dynamics from local random matrix Hamiltonians and beyond

- **TL;DR**: 该论文研究一维量子自旋链，通过自由概率理论将多体量子动力学映射到无限Coxeter反射群上的单粒子跳跃动力学，并探讨群结构变化对物理性质的影响。

We study one dimensional quantum spin chains whose nearest neighbor
interactions are random matrices that square to one. By employing free
probability theory, we establish a mapping from the many-body quantum dynamics
of energy density in the original chain to a single-particle hopping dynamics
when the local Hilbert space dimension is large. The hopping occurs on the
Cayley graph of an infinite Coxeter reflection group. Adjacency matrices on
large finite clusters of this Cayley graph can be constructed numerically by
leveraging the automatic structure of the group. The density of states and
two-point functions of the local energy density are approximately computed and
consistent with the physics of a generic local Hamiltonian: Gaussian density of
states and thermalization of energy density. We then ask what happens to the
physics if we modify the group on which the hopping dynamics occurs, and
conjecture that adding braid relations into the group leads to integrability.
Our results put into contact ideas in free probability theory, quantum
mechanics of hyperbolic lattices, and the physics of both generic and
integrable Hamiltonian dynamics.

### Stress in chromium thin films deposited by DC magnetron sputtering on grounded cupper and stainless-steel substrate holders

- **TL;DR**: 研究了直流磁控溅射在硅衬底上沉积的铬薄膜，分析薄膜厚度、退火温度和不同衬底支架（铜与不锈钢）对薄膜内应力的影响。

Chromium thin films deposited on silicon substrates by DC magnetron
sputtering were systematically investigated as a function of film thickness,
using a DC power of 50 W and a post-deposition annealing temperature of 200 C.
Two types of grounded substrate holders, copper and stainless steel, were
employed to assess substrate-dependent effects. The intrinsic stress,
determined by the wafer curvature method, decreases with increasing film
thickness but increases with the annealing temperature. It is observed that for
thinner as-deposited chromium films, the stress showed a pronounced
irreversible increase when measured immediately after deposition and after
several days of aging. Films deposited on copper holders consistently exhibited
higher stress values than those grown on stainless steel holders. These
observations suggest that the intrinsic stress in as-deposited films is linked
to the growth mechanism, while the stress increase after annealing may be
related to thermally active diffusion and structural relaxation. The higher
stress in films grown on copper substrate holder can likely be associated with
enhanced ion bombardment due to the higher electrical conductivity of copper.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究探讨了无序对半导体-超导混合结构中马约拉纳态的影响，提出了通过正常态弹道输运特性来实验估计无序水平的方法。

Recent work on Majorana-bound states in semiconductor-superconductor hybrid
structures has elucidated the key role of unintentional (and unknown) disorder
(producing low-energy Andreev-bound states) in the system, which is detrimental
to the emergence of Majorana-carrying topological superconductivity
artificially engineered through the combination of superconductivity, Zeeman
spin splitting, and Rashba spin-orbit coupling. In particular, the disorder
must be smaller than the superconducting gap for the appearance of Majorana
modes, but the disorder-induced appearance of subgap Andreev-bound states
suppresses the Majorana modes. We theoretically investigate, as a function of
disorder, the normal state ballistic transport properties of nanowires with and
without superconductors in order to provide guidance on how to experimentally
estimate the level of disorder. Experimentally, the superconductivity is
suppressed simply by rotating the magnetic field appropriately, so both physics
can be studied in the same set-up. In particular, the presence of spin-orbit
coupling and Zeeman splitting produces a helical gap in the 1D electronic band
structure, which should have clear signatures in ballistic transport unless
these signatures are suppressed by disorder and/or Fabry-P\'erot resonances
associated with the finite wire sizes. Our work provides a benchmarking of when
and what signatures of the putative helical gap (which is essential for the
emergence of Majorana modes by leading to a single Fermi surface) could
manifest in realistic nanowires.

### TriDS: AI-native molecular docking framework unified with binding site identification, conformational sampling and scoring

Molecular docking is a cornerstone of drug discovery to unveil the mechanism
of ligand-receptor interactions. With the recent development of deep learning
in the field of artificial intelligence, innovative methods were developed for
molecular docking. However, the mainstream docking programs adopt a
docking-then-rescoring streamline to increase the docking accuracy, which make
the virtual screening process cumbersome. Moreover, there still lacks a unified
framework to integrate binding site identification, conformational sampling and
scoring, in a user-friendly manner. In our previous work of DSDP and its
subsequent flexible version, we have demonstrated the effectiveness of guiding
conformational sampling with the gradient of analytic scoring function. As the
third generation of DSDP, here we expanded the similar strategy to ML-based
differentiable scoring model to device a novel docking method named TriDS under
the mainstream AI training framework, which unifies the sampling and scoring
steps. To be user-friendly, TriDS also integrates ML-based model for binding
site prediction and has compatibility with multiple input file formats. We show
here that gradients of a suitable ML-based scoring function can lead to
excellent docking accuracy in the benchmark datasets, especially for large
ligands. Moreover, TriDS is implemented with enhanced computational efficiency
in terms of both running speed and GPU memory requirement.

### Ultrastrong Magnon-Photon Coupling in Superconductor/Antiferromagnet/Superconductor Heterostructures at Terahertz Frequencies

We predict the realization of ultrastrong coupling between magnons of
antiferromagnets and photons in superconductor/antiferromagnet/superconductor
heterostructures at terahertz frequencies, from both quantum and classical
perspectives. The hybridization of the two magnon modes with photons strongly
depends on the applied magnetic field: at zero magnetic field, only a single
antiferromagnetic mode with a lower frequency couples to the photon, forming a
magnon-polariton, while using a magnetic field activates coupling for both
antiferromagnetic modes. The coupling between magnon and photon is ultrastrong
with the coupling constant $\sim$ 100 GHz exceeding 10% of the
antiferromagnetic resonant frequency. The superconductor modulates the spin of
the resulting magnon-polaritons and the group velocity, achieving values
amounting to several tenths of the speed of light, which promises strong
tunability of magnon transport in antiferromagnets by superconductors.

- **TL;DR**: eT 2.0是一个开源电子结构程序，专注于性能和模块化，具有广泛的耦合簇能力，在性能上优于其他程序甚至商业替代品。

The eT program is an open-source electronic structure program with emphasis
on performance and modularity. As its name suggests, the program features
extensive coupled cluster capabilities, performing well compared to other
electronic structure programs, and, in some cases, outperforming commercial
alternatives. However, eT is more than a coupled cluster program; other models
based on wave function theory (such as full and reduced space configuration
interaction and a variety of self-consistent field models) and density
functional theory are supported. The second major release of the program, eT
2.0, has In addition, it includes a wide range of optimizations and algorithmic
improvements, as well as new capabilities for exploring potential energy
surfaces and for modeling experiments in the UV and X-ray regimes. Molecular
gradients are now available at the coupled cluster level, and high-accuracy
spectroscopic simulations are available at reduced computational cost within
the multilevel coupled cluster and multiscale frameworks. We present the
modifications to the program since its first major release, eT 1.0,
highlighting some notable new features and demonstrating the performance of the
new version relative to the first release and to other established electronic
structure programs.

- **TL;DR**: 本文展示了如何利用细胞分裂统计特性区分不同分裂模型（Timer、Sizer、Adder）和生长类型（线性/指数），但发现种群水平分布在各种模型中不可区分。

It is well known that the different cell-division models, such as Timer,
Sizer, and Adder, can be distinguished based on the correlations between
different single-cell-level quantities such as birth-size, division-time,
division-size, and division-added-size. Here, we show that other statistical
properties of these quantities can also be used to distinguish between them.
Additionally, the statistical relationships and different correlation patterns
can also differentiate between the different types of single-cell growth, such
as linear and exponential. Further, we demonstrate that various
population-level distributions, such as age, size, and added-size
distributions, are indistinguishable across different models of cell division
despite them having different division rules and correlation patterns.
Moreover, this indistinguishability is robust to stochasticity in growth rate
and holds for both exponential and linear growth. Finally, we show that our
theoretical predictions are corroborated by simulations and supported by
existing single-cell experimental data.

- **TL;DR**: 非晶态NdCo4.6薄膜的磁各向异性随厚度变化，当厚度超过40nm时从面内变为面外各向异性。HAXPES分析显示稀土元素钕在薄膜表面发生偏析，且偏析程度随厚度增加而增强，这解释了垂直各向异性及其厚度依赖性。

The magnetic anisotropy of amorphous NdCo$_{4.6}$ compounds deposited by
magnetron sputtering change with film thickness from in plane to out of plane
anisotropy at thickness above 40 nm. Xray reflectivity measurements shows the
progressive formation of an additional layer in between the 3 nm thick Si
capping layer and the NdCo compound film. Hard Xray Photoemission spectroscoy
(HAXPES) was used to analyze the composition and distribution of cobalt and
neodymium at the top layers region of NdCo$_{4.6}$ films of thickness ranging
from 5 nm to 65 nm using 7 keV, 10 keV and 13 keV incident photon energies,
with inelastic electron mean free paths ranging from 7.2 nm to 12.3 nm in
cobalt. The atomic cobalt concentration of the alloy deduced from HAXPES
measurements at the Nd 3d and Co 2p excitations results to be bellow the
nominal value, changing with thickness and incident photon energy. This proves
a segregation of the rare earth at the surface of the NdCo$_{4.6}$ thin film
which increases with thickness. The analysis of the background of the Co 2p and
Nd 3d peaks was consistent with this conclusion. This demonstrates that
neodymium incorporation in the cobalt lattice have a cost in energy which can
be associated to strain due to the difference in volume between the two
elements. The lowering of this strain energy will favor atomic anisotropic
environments for neodymium that explains the perpendicular anisotropy and its
thickness dependence of these thin film compounds.

### Nonlinear Layer Hall Effect and Detection of the Hidden Berry Curvature Dipole in $\mathcal{PT}$-Symmetric Antiferromagnetic Insulators

Recent experimental and theoretical studies have revealed the emergence of a
linear layer Hall effect (LHE) induced by hidden Berry curvature in
\textrm{MnBi}$_{2}$\textrm{Te}$_{4}$ thin films. This phenomenon underscores
the layer degree of freedom as a novel mechanism for generating Hall transport
in layered materials, providing a new pathway to probe and manipulate the
internal structure of fully compensated topological antiferromagnets (AFMs). In
this work, we predict a nonlinear LHE in $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric layered AFMs,
which manifests as a detectable nonlinear Hall conductivity even with respect
to the AFM order and odd with respect to the vertical electric field, in
contrast to the linear LHE. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the nonlinear Hall
currents induced by the hidden BCD and quantum metric dipole (QMD) obey
distinct symmetries and flow in different directions. Our proposed nonlinear
LHE establishes an experimentally advantageous framework for exclusively
probing the hidden BCD quantum geometry.

### Chiral gapped states are universally non-topological

- **TL;DR**: 该论文提出了Li-Haldane猜想的算子推广，研究了2+1维手性有隙基态中圆盘的纠缠哈密顿量，并推导了角点纠缠的若干普适性质。

We propose an operator generalization of the Li-Haldane conjecture regarding
the entanglement Hamiltonian of a disk in a 2+1D chiral gapped groundstate. The
logic applies to regions with sharp corners, from which we derive several
universal properties regarding corner entanglement. These universal properties
follow from a set of locally-checkable conditions on the wavefunction. We also
define a quantity $(\mathfrak{c}_{\text{tot}})_{\text{min}}$ that reflects the
robustness of corner entanglement contributions, and show that it provides an
obstruction to a gapped boundary. One reward from our analysis is that we can
construct a local gapped Hamiltonian within the same chiral gapped phase from a
given wavefunction; we conjecture that it is closer to the low-energy
renormalization group fixed point than the original parent Hamiltonian. Our
analysis of corner entanglement reveals the emergence of a universal conformal
geometry encoded in the entanglement structure of bulk regions of chiral gapped
states that is not visible in topological field theory.

### Signatures of superconducting pairing driven by electron-electron interactions in moiré WSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ homobilayer modelled by Hubbard Hamiltonian

Strong evidence of unconventional superconductivity has been very recently
reported experimentally in twisted transition metal dichalcogenide bilayer and
gathered a significant amount of interest. Here we consider the Hubbard model
on a triangular lattice describing the hole-doped moir\'e superlattice emerging
in WSe$_{2}$/WSe$_{2}$ twisted homobilayer in the moderately correlated regime.
By applying the Density Matrix Renormalization Group, we diagonalize the
spin-valley-polarized Hamiltonian and show signatures of coexisting singlet and
triplet pairings in the range of hole dopings and displacement fields reported
in the experiments. In this view, we show that the superconductivity in the
WSe$_{2}$/WSe$_{2}$ twisted homobilayer is likely to be induced by electronic
correlations and has a mixed-symmetry character. These predictions can shed
light on the nature of the superconducting state observed in the twisted
homobilayer of WSe$_{2}$/WSe$_{2}$. We also identify the emerging
superconducting orders, which are $d_{xy}(d_{x^2-y^2} \pm id_{xy} )$ and
$p_y(p_{x}\mp ip_{y})$ for the singlet and triplet channels in the cylinder of
width three(four), respectively.

### When bubbles matter: hydrogen transport governs apparent kinetics in 4-nitrophenol hydrogenation reaction

- **TL;DR**: 重新评估4-硝基苯酚还原反应的动力学，发现氢传输是影响表观催化活性的关键因素，而非催化剂固有性质。

The reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NiP) with sodium borohydride is widely used
to benchmark heterogeneous catalysts, yet its kinetics are commonly
oversimplified as pseudo-first-order. In reality, borohydride hydrolysis and
hydrogenation by dissolved hydrogen proceed concurrently, making hydrogen
transport a decisive factor in shaping apparent activity. Re-examining data on
Pt-SiO2 supraparticles with different pore structures, we attribute contrasting
kinetic behavior to distinct regimes of hydrogen transport: diffusive transport
sustains pseudo-first-order kinetics, while bubble-mediated escape causes
hydrogen loss and incomplete conversion. We propose a kinetic model that
captures this transition and enables consistent interpretation of experimental
data. More broadly, our analysis shows that apparent differences in activity
during 4-NiP benchmarking can arise from hydrogen transport rather than
intrinsic properties of the catalyst, underscoring the need to account for
transport effects when comparing catalyst performance.

### Evaluating the Performance of Direct Higher-Order Formulations in Combinatorial Optimization Problems

- **TL;DR**: 本研究评估了直接求解高阶项优化问题的有效性，使用基于模拟退火的高性能PUBO求解器，相比传统QUBO求解器在相同硬件平台上表现更优。

Ising machines, including quantum annealing machines, are promising
next-generation computers for combinatorial optimization problems. However, due
to hardware limitations, most Ising-type hardware can only solve objective
functions expressed in linear or quadratic terms of binary variables.
Therefore, problems with higher-order terms require an order-reduction process,
which increases the number of variables and constraints and may degrade
solution quality. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of directly
solving such problems without order reduction by using a high-performance
simulated annealing-based optimization solver capable of handling polynomial
unconstrained binary optimization (PUBO) formulations. We compare its
performance against a conventional quadratic unconstrained binary optimization
(QUBO) solver on the same hardware platform. As benchmarks, we use the low
autocorrelation binary sequence (LABS) problem and the vehicle routing problem
with distance balancing, both of which naturally include higher-order
interactions. Results show that the PUBO solver consistently achieves superior
solution quality and stability compared to its QUBO counterpart, while
maintaining comparable computational time and requiring no order-reduction
compilation indicating potential advantages of directly handling higher-order
terms in practical optimization problems.

### Relativistic Spin-momentum locking in altermagnets

Spin-momentum locking in altermagnets has been deeply explored in the
non-relativistic limit. Including spin-orbit coupling, altermagnets exhibit
antisymmetric exchange interactions, leading to spin cantings. Therefore, the
spin-momentum locking differs among the three spin components Sx, Sy, and Sz,
forming the relativistic spin-momentum locking. We consider orthorhombic YVO3
and hexagonal MnTe. For YVO3, the relativistic locking comprises s-, dxy -, and
dxz-wave. In MnTe, the dominant component Sy of MnTe inherits the polarized
charge distribution and the non-relativistic spin-momentum locking bulk g-wave,
but the breaking of the C6z rotational symmetry by the Neel vector lowers the
symmetry from g-wave to d-wave. The relativistic spin-momentum locking for MnTe
is composed of dxz-, dyz- and s-wave. Despite small magnitudes in real space,
the canted spin components contribute significant spectral weight in k-space,
impacting k-space properties such as the spin-Hall conductivity.

The ability to modulate the photoluminescence (PL) of nanomaterials via
spin-related effects is vital for many emerging quantum technologies, with
nanoscale quantum sensing and imaging being particular areas of focus.
Carbon-based quantum dots (CQDs) are among the most common forms of luminescent
nanomaterials, appealing due to their ease of synthesis, tunability through
organic chemistry, high brightness, and natural biocompatibility. However, the
observation of room temperature, spin-dependent PL has remained elusive. Here
we report on the observation of PL modulation of CQDs by magnetic fields ($\sim
10$ mT) under ambient conditions. We synthesize a series of CQDs using 19
different amino acids, which have a range of PL emission spectra and exhibit a
clear magneto-PL effect (up to $\sim 1$% change). Furthermore, an electron spin
resonance is detected in the PL with a g-factor of g $\approx$ 2, suggesting a
process similar to the radical pair mechanism is responsible. Finally, we show
that the magneto-PL contrast decreases in the presence of paramagnetic species,
which we attribute to an increase in magnetic noise-induced spin relaxation in
the CQDs. Our work brings new functionalities to these commonly used and
biocompatible luminescent nanoparticles, opening new opportunities for in situ
quantum sensing and imaging of biological samples.

### Beyond Random Phase Approximation in electron-hole bilayer superfluidity

We derive the normal and anomalous proper polarization functions and the
screened Coulomb interactions in a two-dimensional superfluid electron-hole
bilayer, including all first-order corrections beyond the Random Phase
Approximation (RPA). This requires a modification of the perturbation method as
first noted by Nozi\`eres and Schrieffer [1, 2]. We discuss the physical origin
and magnitude of the first-order corrections in a superfluid system with
long-range Coulomb interactions. Unlike conventional superconductivity,
Migdal's theorem does not apply here, so exchange vertex corrections cannot be
neglected. The screened electron-electron, hole-hole, and electron-hole
interactions in the superfluid state are evaluated as functions of the carrier
density. We find that at low density, the strong cancellations between the
normal and anomalous components that make screening of the interactions
negligible, apply not only within RPA but also with the first-order corrections
included. As the density is increased, the normal-anomalous cancellation
weakens and screening becomes increasingly significant. We find that the
first-order corrections amplify the normal-anomalous difference but only at
large momenta exchanged in the two-particle scattering, so their effect on the
interactions remains modest. We conclude that the superfluid state RPA is an
excellent approximation for the screening and for the effective electron-hole
pairing in this superfluid system over the range of densities up to the maximum
of the superfluid gap.

### Quantum geometric magnetic monopole and two-phase superconductivity in CeRh$_2$As$_2$

Recent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and density
functional theory plus Hubbard $U$ (DFT+$U$) studies revealed that a
heavy-fermion superconductor CeRh$_2$As$_2$ exhibits van Hove singularities and
the Dirac point near the Fermi level $E_{\mathrm F}$, which are key signatures
of strong-correlation effects and quantum geometry. We have constructed a
two-dimensional 12-orbital \textit{Dirac-Anderson} model as an effective model
for CeRh$_2$As$_2$. The band structure and Fermi-surface topology of the
Dirac-Anderson model agree well with the ARPES data and the DFT+$U$
calculations. We show that the quantum geometry strongly favors
magnetic-monopole fluctuations because of the Dirac point at the $M$ point. By
solving the linearized \'{E}liashberg equation, we demonstrate that the
$B_{1u}$ and $B_{2g}$ representations, spin-triplet states originating from the
Dirac point, exhibit the leading superconducting instabilities. By comparing
the random-phase approximation and the fluctuation-exchange approximation, we
further demonstrate that strong-correlation effects mitigate the influence of
quantum geometry. The phase diagram of CeRh$_2$As$_2$ under pressure is
discussed in connection with the theoretical results.

Considering deterministic classical lattice systems with continuous
variables, we show that, if the initial conditions are sampled according to a
probability distribution in which the dynamical variables are statistically
independent, the dynamical trajectory of any macroscopic observable is
approximately the same for the vast majority of the states in the sample. Our
proof relies on general concentration of measure results which provide tight
bounds for the deviation from typical behavior in the case of large system
sizes. The only condition that we assume for the dynamics is that the influence
of a local perturbation in the initial state decays sufficiently fast with
distance at any finite time. Our results are relevant, in particular, to
classical Hamiltonian systems on a lattice. We apply our general results to a
system of coupled rotors with long-range interactions, and report dynamical
simulations which verify our findings.

### Strong Intra- and Interchain Orbital Coupling Leads to Multiband and High Thermoelectric Performance in Na$_2$Au$X$ ($X$ = P, As, Sb, and Bi)

The intrinsic coupling among electrical conductivity ($\sigma$), Seebeck
coefficient ($S$), and lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_{\mathrm{L}}$)
imposes a fundamental limit on the dimensionless figure of merit $ZT$ in
thermoelectric (TE) materials. Increasing band degeneracy can effectively
balance $\sigma$ and $S$, enabling a high power factor (PF, $S^{2}\sigma$).
However, compounds with intrinsically large band degeneracy are scarce. Here,
we present an unconventional strategy to realize elevated band degeneracy in
zigzag-chain Na$_2$Au$X$ ($X$ = P, As, Sb, Bi) compounds by harnessing strong
intra- and interchain orbital coupling. Pronounced hybridization between
Au-$d_{z^{2}}$ and $X$-$p_{z}$ orbitals along the Au--$X$ zigzag chains,
together with unexpectedly strong interchain $X$-$p_{x}/p_{y}$ coupling,
produces a highly dispersive, multivalley valence band structure that supports
an exceptional PF. Concurrently, the intrinsically weak interchain interactions
arising from the quasi-one-dimensional framework, together with the weakened
Au--$X$ and Au--Au bonds within the chains due to filling of $p$-$d^{*}$
antibonding states, result in an ultralow $\kappa_{\mathrm{L}}$.
First-principles calculations combined with Boltzmann transport theory predict
that $p$-type Na$_2$AuBi achieves a PF of
$63.9\,\mu\mathrm{W}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-1}\,\mathrm{K}^{-2}$, an ultralow
$\kappa_{\mathrm{L}}$ of $0.49\,\mathrm{W}\,\mathrm{m}^{-1}\,\mathrm{K}^{-1}$,
and a maximum $ZT$ of $4.7$ along the zigzag-chain direction at
$800\,\mathrm{K}$. This work establishes a new design paradigm for
high-efficiency TE materials by exploiting substantial orbital overlap in
structurally weakly bonded, quasi-one-dimensional systems, opening promising
avenues for the discovery and engineering of next-generation high-performance
TE materials.

In third-order nonlinear transport, a voltage can be measured in response to
the cube of a driving current as a result of the quantum geometric effects,
which has attracted tremendous attention. However, in realistic materials where
disorder scattering also contributes to nonlinear transport, identifying the
geometric mechanisms remains a challenge. We find a total of 20 mechanisms of
third-order nonlinear transport by developing a comprehensive theory that
treats the geometric effects and disorder scattering on an equal footing. More
importantly, we find that 12 of these mechanisms can be unambiguously
identified, by deriving a scaling law that expresses the third-order nonlinear
Hall conductivity as a polynomial in the linear longitudinal conductivity. We
apply this theory to identify the geometric mechanisms of third-order nonlinear
transport in materials both with and without time-reversal symmetry, such as 2D
materials, topological materials, and altermagnets. This theory further
promotes nonlinear transport as a probe of geometric effects and phase
transitions in quantum materials.

We present a detailed study of magnetization, resistivity, heat capacity, and
X-ray and neutron powder diffraction measurements performed on single crystals
of non-stoichiometric CeAuBi$_2$, Au deficiency 18$\%$, a strongly correlated
antiferromagnet with N\'eel temperature T$_N$ = 13.2 K. Field-dependent
magnetization measurements reveal a large magnetic anisotropy at low
temperatures with an easy axis along the crystallographic c-axis, in which
direction a spin-flop transition exhibits strong features in magnetization,
specific heat, and resistivity at H$_c$ = 75 kOe. The constructed
temperature-field phase diagram connects this transition to the suppression of
magnetic order, which evolves from a second-order nature into a first-order
transition that bifurcates at the spin-flop into three transitions below 1 K.
The smoothed nature of the metamagnetic transitions in non-stoichiometric
CeAuBi$_2$ is well described by an Ising model with weak quenched disorder,
suggesting that the presence of Au vacancies is sufficient to smear the complex
metamagnetic behavior and tune the critical behavior of magnetic order.

An interaction between ferromagnetic and superconducting order, to be
realized in a 2d ferromagnetic superconductor, is proposed obeying necessary
symmetry principles. This interaction allow us to formulate a duality, similar
to the Boson-vortex duality in 2+1 dimensional superfluid. In the dual theory
Skyrmion and vortex excitations interact with each other via an emergent gauge

vortex with opposite topological charges. This interaction can lead to
formation of bound pairs of the mentioned topological excitations.

- **TL;DR**: DNA在聚集态和固态下表现出激发依赖性发射和室温磷光，这可以通过簇聚触发发射机制解释，其中核苷酸和富电子非芳香基团共同贡献于DNA的光物理性质。高压实验显示核苷酸在26 GPa下发光增强207倍，且减压后仍保持。

The photophysical properties of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) are fundamental
to life sciences and biophotonics. While previous studies have generally been
restricted to fluorescence, attributing it to pi-pi* transitions and charge
transfer within nucleobases in dilute solution, these understandings fail to
explain the pronounced visible emission in physiological and aggregated states,
and moreover, ignore the possible phosphorescence. Addressing this critical
gap, we systematically investigate native DNA across its structural hierarchy,
from nucleobases to single-stranded chains, under varying states. We
demonstrate that DNA exhibits excitation-dependent emission in aggregates and
moreover room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) in the solid state. These
behaviors are rationalized by the clustering-triggered emission (CTE)
mechanism, where nucleobases and electron-rich nonaromatic moieties like sugar
and phosphate synergistically contribute to DNA photophysics. High-pressure
experiments reveal a 207-fold luminescence enhancement for nucleotides at 26
GPa, largely retained after decompression, underscoring the precise control of
emission by intermolecular interactions. This study not only elucidates the
intrinsic luminescence mechanism of DNA and but also establishes pressure
modulation as a versatile approach for developing new nucleic acid-inspired
luminescent materials.

### Accelerated relaxation and Mpemba-like effect for operators in open quantum systems

- **TL;DR**: 该论文研究了开放量子系统中算子的量子Mpemba效应，定义了单调衰减的算子距离来检测这种效应，发现在单量子比特系统中只有加速弛豫，而在高维系统中存在真正的Mpemba效应。

Quantum Mpemba effect occurs when a quantum system, residing far away from
the steady state, relaxes faster than a relatively nearer state. We look for
the presence of this highly counterintuitive effect in the relaxation dynamics
of the operators within the open quantum system setting. Since the operators
evolve under a non-trace preserving map, the trace distance of an operator is
not a monotonically decaying function of time, unlike its quantum state
counterpart. Consequently, the trace distance can not serve as a reliable
measure for detecting the Mpemba effect in operator dynamics. We circumvent
this problem by defining a \textit{dressed} distance between operators that
decays monotonically with time, enabling a generalized framework to explore the
Mpemba-like effect for operators. Applying the formalism to various open
quantum system settings, we find that, interestingly, in the single qubit case,
only accelerated relaxation of operators is possible, while genuine Mpemba-like
effects emerge in higher-dimensional systems such as qutrits and beyond.
Furthermore, we demonstrate the existence of Mpemba-like effects in nonlocal,
non-equilibrium operators, such as current, in a double-quantum-dot setup. Our
results, besides offering fundamental insight about the occurrence of the
Mpemba-like effect under non-trace preserving dynamics, open avenues for new
experimental studies where quicker relaxation of observables could be of
significant interest.

### Viscous AC current-driven nanomotors

The recent discovery that electrons in nano-scale conductors can act like a
highly viscous liquid has triggered a surge of research activities
investigating consequences of this surprising fact. Here we demonstrate that
the electronic viscosity has an enormous influence on the operation of a
prototypical AC-current-driven nano-motor. The design of this prototype
consists of a diatomic molecule immersed in an otherwise homogeneous electron
liquid which carries an AC current. The motion of the diatomic is determined by
a subtle balance between the current-induced forces and electronic friction. By
ab-initio time-dependent density-functional simulations we demonstrate that the
diatomic performs a continuous rotation provided the amplitude and frequency of
the imposed AC current lie within certain islands of stability. Outside these
islands the nuclear motion is either chaotic or comes to a stand-still. The
proposed design of the nano-motor is the conceptually simplest realization of
the idea of an molecular waterwheel sandwiched between conducting leads

We have investigated the orbital-dependent electronic states of Cd6Ce, a
prototype of strongly correlated rare-earth-based Tsai-type quasicrystals and
approximants (ACs) by soft and hard x-ray photoemission spectroscopy. Our
results reveal that the 4f orbitals are predominantly hybridized with the
valence-band electrons far from the Fermi level EF, in sharp contrast to the
hybridization with conduction electrons at EF seen for the intermetallic
Ce-based compounds. This anomalous hybridization effect is likely responsible
for the unresolved magnetic ground state in Cd6Ce. These findings suggest that
Cd-based ACs, some of which show the multi-step magnetic transitions, provide a
new platform for investigating exotic magnetic properties that cannot be
understood within the conventional framework of hybridization at EF.

### Charge stripe and superconductivity tuned by interlayer interaction in a sign-problem-free bilayer extended Hubbard model

Competing orders represent a central challenge in understanding strongly
correlated systems. In this work, we employ projector quantum Monte Carlo
simulations to study a sign-problem-free bilayer extended Hubbard model. In
this model, a charge stripe phase, characterized by a peak at momentum
$k_x=2\pi\delta$ is induced by highly anisotropic interlayer spin-exchange
coupling $J_z$, and strongly suppressed upon introducing the spin-flip term
$J_\bot$; in contrast, \(J_\perp\) favors the emergence of interlayer pairing
superconductivity. We further demonstrate that the anisotropy of the interlayer
spin-exchange directly governs the competition between these two phases, while
the on-site interaction \(U\) plays a complex role in tuning both the charge
stripe and superconductivity. Our work identifies the key factors driving
charge stripe formation, highlights the sensitivity of both the charge stripe
and superconducting phases to interaction parameters, and thereby provides
valuable insights into competing orders in strongly correlated systems.

### Regularised density-potential inversion for periodic systems: application to exact exchange in one dimension

- **TL;DR**: 本文提出了基于凸分析的周期性系统密度泛函理论，采用Yukawa型电子相互作用，通过Moreau-Yosida正则化重构Hohenberg-Kohn映射，使其对扰动不敏感且便于数值实现。

A detailed convex analysis-based formulation of density-functional theory for
periodic systems in arbitrary dimensions is presented. The electron-electron
interaction is taken to be of Yukawa type, harmonising with underlying function
spaces for densities and wave functions. Moreau--Yosida regularisation of the
underlying non-interacting density functionals is then considered, allowing us
to recast the Hohenberg--Kohn mapping in a form that is insensitive to
perturbations (non-expansiveness) and lends itself to numerical implementation.
The general theory is exemplified with a numerical Hartree--Fock implementation
for one-dimensional systems. We discuss in particular the challenge of
self-consistent field optimisation in calculations related to the regularised
noninteracting Hohenberg--Kohn map. The implementation is used to demonstrate
that it is practically feasible to recover local Kohn--Sham potentials
reproducing the effects of exact exchange within this scheme, which provides a
proof-of-principle for recovering the exchange-correlation potential at more
accurate levels of theory. Error analysis is performed for the regularised
inverse Kohn--Sham algorithm by quantifying, both theoretically and
numerically, how perturbations of the input ground-state density propagate
through the regularised density-to-potential map.

### Memory-induced long-range order drag

- **TL;DR**: 研究表明，通过慢自由度形式的内存可以在局部耦合的快速自由度中诱导长程有序相，产生雪崩的幂律分布。这种内存诱导的长程有序可以传递到没有自身内存的耦合系统中。

Recent research has shown that memory, in the form of slow degrees of
freedom, can induce a phase of long-range order (LRO) in locally-coupled fast
degrees of freedom, producing power-law distributions of avalanches. In fact,
such memory-induced LRO (MILRO) arises in a wide range of physical systems.
Here, we show that MILRO can be transferred to coupled systems that have no
memory of their own. As an example, we consider a stack of layers of spins with
local feedforward couplings: only the first layer contains memory, while
downstream layers are memory-free and locally interacting. Analytical arguments
and simulations reveal that MILRO can indeed drag across the layers, enabling
downstream layers to sustain intra-layer LRO despite having neither memory nor
long-range interactions. This establishes a simple, yet generic mechanism for
propagating collective activity through media without fine tuning to
criticality, with testable implications for neuromorphic systems and laminar
information flow in the brain cortex.

### Interplay between Cu diffusion and bonding anisotropy on the thermoelectric performance of double cation chalcohalides $CuBiSeX_{2} (X = Cl, Br)$

- **TL;DR**: 该研究通过密度泛函理论计算探索了CuBiSeX2 (X = Cl, Br)双阳离子硫卤化物的热电性能，发现CuBiSeCl2具有超低晶格热导率和优异的热电性能。

Double cation chalcohalide have recently been emerged as the interesting
candidates for sustainable energy conversion applications, owing to their
intrinsic chemical tunability, suitable band gap, and low thermal conductivity.
With this motivation, the current study is designed to explore the structural,
electron and phonon transport mechanism, and thermoelectric properties of
$CuBiSeX_{2} (X = Cl, Br)$ through density functional theory-based
computations. The experimental feasibility of the compounds is ensured, and
they are predicted to be thermally, dynamically, and mechanically stable. The
distinct structural attributes coupled with suitable electronic band structure
promotes the electron transport properties. Comprehensively, the delocalized Cu
atom enhancing the phonon scattering process and the off-centred displacement
of cations leading to bonding anharmonicity results ultra-low lattice thermal
conductivity $(\kappa_L)$. Among these systems, $CuBiSeCl_2$ exhibits low
$\kappa_L$ (0.24 $W m^{-1} K^{-1}$ at 300 K) and superior thermoelectric
performance (zT = 1.18 at 600 K), whereas $CuBiSeBr_2$ ($\kappa_L$ = 0.65 $W
m^{-1} K^{-1}$ at 300 K, zT = 0.68 at 600 K) demands further optimization.
Overall, the study sheds light into the interplay between the Cu diffusion and
bonding anisotropy in phonon propagation and establishes the potential of
double-cation chalcohalides for mid-temperature thermoelectric applications.

### Phase-Rotated Altermagnets as Chern Valves for Topological Transport

- **TL;DR**: 通过旋转反铁磁电极的晶格相位，在拓扑绝缘体薄膜中实现可编程的拓扑输运，包括离散电导台阶和热电系数的可逆反转，无需外加磁场或净磁化。

Motivated by the emerging control of Berry-curvature textures in
altermagnets, we explore a two-terminal configuration where a
topological-insulator film is interfaced with two altermagnetic electrodes
whose crystalline phases can be rotated independently. The proximity coupling
imprints each momentum-dependent of the altermagnet spin texture onto the Dirac
surface states, giving rise to an angular mass whose sign follows the lattice
orientation. Adjusting the phase of one electrode redefines this mass pattern,
thereby tuning the number and spatial distribution of chiral edge channels.
This results in discrete conductance steps and a reversible inversion of the
thermoelectric coefficient-achieved without external magnetic fields or net
magnetization. A compact Dirac model captures both the quantized switching and
its resilience to moderate disorder. Overall, this symmetry-driven mechanism
provides a practical and low-dissipation route to programmable topological
transport via lattice rotation.

### Non-equilibrium correlation effects in spin transport through the 2D ferromagnet Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$

Understanding non-equilibrium spin transport through 2D ferromagnets is a
theoretical challenge, as correlations produce a complex electronic structure
with coexisting itinerant and localized electrons. We have developed a fully
non-equilibrium ab initio method, combining density functional theory,
dynamical mean-field theory, and non-equilibrium Green's functions to
investigate the transport in Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$, a prototypical high-temperature 2D
ferromagnet. We show that, while spin transport remains essentially
single-particle under moderate bias, inelastic spin-dependent scattering of
carriers with particle-hole excitations drives a distinctive hot-correlated
electron regime beyond a critical voltage. This regime is marked by incoherent
features in both the electronic spectrum and the conductance, which are
experimentally accessible. Our results demonstrates that material-specific
many-body non-equilibrium methods are essential for a complete understanding of
spin transport in 2D ferromagnets.

The intercalation of guest species into the gap of van der Waals materials
often leads to the emergence of intriguing phenomena, such as
superconductivity. While intercalation-induced superconductivity has been
reported in several bulk crystals, reaching a zero-resistance state in flakes
remains challenging. Here, we show a simple method for enhancing the
superconducting transition in tens-of-nm thick 2H-TaS2 crystals contacted by
gold electrodes through in-situ intercalation. Our approach enables measuring
the electrical characteristics of the same flake before and after
intercalation, permitting us to precisely identify the effect of the guest
species on the TaS2 transport properties. We find that the intercalation of
amylamine molecules into TaS2 flakes causes a suppression of the charge density
wave and an increase in the superconducting transition, with an onset
temperature above 3 K. Additionally, we show that a fully developed
zero-resistance state can be achieved in flakes by engineering the conditions
of the chemical intercalation. Our findings pave the way for the integration of
chemically tailored intercalation compounds in scalable quantum technologies.

Electron transfer (ET) at electrochemical interfaces is central to energy
conversion and storage, yet its theoretical and computational modeling remain
active research areas. This review elucidates key concepts and theories of ET
kinetics, focusing on coupling between classical solvent fluctuations and
quantum electronic states of metallic electrodes and redox species. We begin
with fundamental rate theories, reaction coordinates, and electrochemical
timescales, then explore weak, strong, and intermediate electronic coupling
regimes. Special attention is given to solvent dynamics and the structure of
the electrical double layer (EDL), which critically impact ET kinetics.
Atomistic simulations, particularly density functional theory (DFT) and
molecular dynamics (MD), are highlighted for testing linear response and
determining solvent reorganization energy, electronic coupling strengths, and
solvent relaxation dynamics. A central theme is linear response enabling
tractable treatments across Marcus theory, empirical valence bond (EVB) models,
the Anderson-Newns-Schmickler framework, and generalized Langevin dynamics.
While linear response offers useful simplifications, we assess its limitations,
particularly for strong solvation changes or inner-sphere ET at catalytic
interfaces. We discuss advances, including mapping Hamiltonian-based EVB-MD,
constrained DFT, and non-Gaussian free energy formulations, enabling rigorous
tests and access to diabatic and adiabatic free energy surfaces. We outline
opportunities to advance multiscale, quantum-classical models that integrate
EDL effects, multiple reaction coordinates, solvent-controlled dynamics, and
transitions between adiabatic and nonadiabatic regimes. This review serves as a
conceptual guide and practical resource for researchers integrating theory and
simulation in studying electrochemical ET across diverse systems.

The development of extreme ultraviolet sources is critical for advancing

probing the electronic structure of materials. Here, we report the construction
of a tabletop 10.8-eV femtosecond laser through cascaded third-harmonic
generation, which operates at a repetition rate of 1 MHz and delivers a photon
flux of approximately 1012 photons/s. The system achieves a high energy
resolution of approximately 11.8 meV and tunable polarization. This flexibility
enables detailed studies of orbitaland (pseudo)spin characteristics in quantum
materials. We demonstrate the capabilities of this laser-ARPES system by
investigating several prototypical materials, showcasing its potential for
elucidating complex phenomena in quantum materials.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一个统一框架，利用磁场约束的二维电子系统来限制Lorentz对称性破缺的最小标准模型扩展系数a_μ和b_μ，通过分析LV诱导的能级移动与光谱分辨率的关系获得实验约束。

We present a unified, SI-consistent framework to constrain minimal SME
coefficients $a_\mu$ and $b_\mu$ using magnetically confined two-dimensional
electron systems under a uniform magnetic field. Working in the nonrelativistic
(Schr\"odinger--Pauli) limit with effective mass, we derive the radial problem
for cylindrical geometries and identify how spatial components ($\mathbf
a,\mathbf b$) reshape the effective potential, via $1/r$ and $r$ terms or
spin-selective offsets, while scalar components ($a_0,b_0$) act through a
global energy shift and a spin-momentum coupling. Phenomenological upper bounds
follow from requiring LV-induced shifts to lie below typical spectroscopic
resolutions: $|a_0|\lesssim\delta E$, $|b_z|\lesssim\delta E/\hbar$, and
compact expressions for $|a_\varphi|$ and $|b_0|$ that expose their dependence
on device scales ($r_0$, $B_0$, $\mu$, $m$). Dimensional analysis clarifies
that, in this regime, spatial $a_i$ carry momentum dimension and $b_i$ carry
inverse-time/length dimensions, ensuring gauge-independent, unit-consistent
reporting. Finite-difference eigenvalue calculations validate the scaling laws
and illustrate spectral signatures across realistic parameter sets. The results
show that scalar sectors (notably $a_0$) are tightly constrained by
state-of-the-art $\mu$eV-resolution probes, while spatial and axial sectors
benefit from spin- and $m$-resolved spectroscopy and geometric leverage,
providing a reproducible pathway to test Lorentz symmetry in condensed-matter
platforms.

### Ultrafast recovery dynamics of dimer stripes in IrTe2

The transition metal dichalcogenide IrTe2 displays a remarkable series of
first-order phase transitions below room temperature, involving lattice
displacements as large as 20 percents of the initial bond length. This is
nowadays understood as the result of strong electron-phonon coupling leading to
the formation of local multicentre dimers that arrange themselves into
one-dimensional stripes. In this work, we study the out-of-equilibrium dynamics
of these dimers and track the time evolution of their population following an
infrared photoexcitation using free-electron lased-based time-resolved X-ray
photoemission spectroscopy. First, we observe that the dissolution of dimers is
driven by the transfer of energy from the electronic subsystem to the lattice
subsystem, in agreement with previous studies. Second, we observe a
surprisingly fast relaxation of the dimer population on the timescale of a few
picoseconds. By comparing our results to published ultrafast electron
diffraction and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy data, we reveal that
the long-range order needs tens of picoseconds to recover, while the local
dimer distortion recovers on a short timescale of a few picoseconds.

The control of localized magnetic domains at the nanoscale holds great
promise for next-generation spintronic applications. Colloidal transition metal
dichalcogenides nanostructures are experimentally accessible and chemically
tunable platforms for spintronics, deserving dedicated research to assess their
potential. Here, we investigate from first principles free-standing triangular
MoS2 nanoflakes with sulfur-terminated, hydrogen-passivated edges, to probe
intrinsic spin behavior at varying side lengths. We find a critical edge length
of approximately 1.5 nm separating nonmagnetic nanoflakes from larger ones with
a magnetic ground state emerging from several, energetically competing spin
configurations. In these systems, the magnetic activity is not uniformly
distributed along the edges but localized on specific "magnetic islands" around
molybdenum edge atoms. The localization of magnetic moments is robust even in
non-equilateral nanoflake geometries, highlighting their intrinsic stability
regardless of the (high) symmetry of the hosting structure. These findings
establish that the S-terminated, H-passivated triangular MoS2 nanoflakes are a
stable and experimentally accessible platform via colloidal synthesis for
low-dimensional, next-generation spintronic devices.

compatibility with standard CMOS technology. The strained Si quantum well
reduces the valley degeneracy into two closely spaced ones. The existence of a
near-degenerate valley state act as a leakage channel and compromises gate
fidelity. A robust and uniform valley splitting across the entire chip is
crucial for achieving scalability in the architecture and reliability in
operation. Imperfections such as broadened interfaces, alloy disorders and
atomic steps significantly compromise the valley splitting. The associated
scattering mechanisms play detrimental roles in the performance of the qubits.
In this manuscript, exploiting low-temperature magnetotransport measurements,
we investigate the scattering mechanisms and valley splitting in a
high-mobility undoped Si-SiGe 2DEG. At lower carrier densities, transport is
limited by remote impurity scattering, whereas at higher densities, background
impurity scattering near the quantum well dominates. Both the transport and
quantum lifetimes of the charge carriers increase with carrier concentration,
due to the enhancement in the impurity screening. Magnetic-field-induced
confinement effect also is found to improve the valley splitting.
Current-biasing measurements reveals the role of carrier heating in the
visibility of valley splitting and reveal a temperature limited valley
splitting of approximately 100 micro-eV. These results provide critical insight
into scattering-dominated regimes and valley splitting in undoped Si-SiGe,
advancing its potential for silicon-based quantum devices.

We report high-field electron spin resonance studies of the altermagnetic
material $\alpha$-MnTe. In magnetic fields applied parallel to the triangular
Mn$^{2+}$ layers we observed a single resonance line, corresponding to an
antiferromagnetic resonance (AFMR) mode. The resonance fields of this
excitation exhibit an isotropic behavior with $g_\mathrm{eff}=2.01$, which is
close to the free-electron $g$-factor value and agrees with the absence of
orbital momenta for the Mn$^{2+}$ ions. At low temperatures, the AFMR mode is
remarkably sharp ($\sim50$ mT for the full width at the half-maximum). This
mode exhibits a noticeable broadening with increasing temperature, indicating
the enhanced effect of magnon-magnon interactions. Based on this behavior, we
estimate the strength of these interactions.

We report the observation of an emergent charge order mode in the
optically-excited cuprate ladder Sr$_{14}$Cu$_{24}$O$_{41}$. Near-infrared
light in the ladder plane drives a symmetry-protected electronic metastable
state together with a partial melting of the equilibrium charge order. Our
time-resolved resonant inelastic x-ray scattering measurements at the upper
Hubbard band reveal a gapless collective excitation dispersing from the
charge-order wavevector up to 0.8 eV with a slope on the order of the
quasiparticle velocity. These findings reveal a regime where correlated
carriers acquire itinerant character at finite momentum, and charge order
becomes dynamically fluctuating, offering a platform to explore light-induced
pairing instabilities.

### Unlocking Dynamic Luminescent Mapping of pH with Sustainable Lignin-Derived Carbon Dots with Multimodal Readout Capacity

In this work, we demonstrate the use of CQDs synthesized from lignin -
currently one of the most abundant and underutilized by-products of paper and
pulp production - for advanced pH monitoring applications. The presented
approach integrates green chemistry principles with an operator-friendly,
low-cost, and practical solution for spatial and temporal pH measurement. CQDs
functionalized with m-aminophenylboronic acid enable highly sensitive and
reversible pH readouts through two complementary mechanisms: ratiometric
monitoring of emission band intensities, and direct visual observation of
colorimetric changes reflected in the CIE1931 chromaticity coordinates. The
system achieves maximal sensitivities of 137 percent per pH unit and 49.5
percent per pH unit, respectively, while simultaneously maintaining high
measurement resolution and full reproducibility of the readouts, placing it
among the most effective CQD-based pH sensors reported to date. Here, we
demonstrate the capability of 2D luminescent imaging of pH distributions,
allowing for both spatially resolved and time-resolved monitoring. Employing
just an excitation source, a digital camera or smartphone, and RGB channel
analysis, the setup eliminates the necessity for specialized filters or
sophisticated instrumentation. The combination of multimodal readout strategies
with the capacity for large-area visualization establishes lignin-derived CQDs
as a sustainable and practical platform for pH sensing. By simultaneously
addressing the challenges of waste valorization and the demand for innovative
sensing technologies, this solution fulfills the requirements of both
environmentally responsible material design and next-generation pH sensor
development.

Advances in quantum technologies are often limited by slow device
characterization, complex tuning requirements, and scalability challenges. Spin
qubits in electrostatically defined quantum dots provide a promising platform
but are not exempt from these limitations. Simulations enhance our
understanding of such devices, and in many cases, rapid feedback between
measurements and simulations can guide the development of optimal design and
control strategies. Here, we introduce a modular, graph-based simulator that
acts as a digital surrogate for a semiconductor quantum dot device, where
computationally expensive processes are accelerated using deep learning. We
demonstrate its potential by estimating crosstalk effects between gate
electrodes and applying these estimates to construct virtual gates in a quantum
dot device. We validate our approach through comparison with experiments on a
double quantum dot defined in a Ge/SiGe heterostructure. We envision that this
simulation framework will advance semiconductor-based quantum technologies by
enabling more efficient design, characterization, and control of complex
devices.

### Crossover from self-trapped bound states to perturbative scattering in the Heisenberg-Kondo lattice model

We map out the complete transport phase diagram of the ferromagnetic
Heisenberg-Kondo lattice model in two dimensions. The model involves
tight-binding electrons with hopping $t$, coupled to classical spins with
coupling $J'$, while the spins have a nearest neighbour coupling $J$ between
them. We work with a fixed, small $J/t$, and study the temperature dependence
of resistivity for varying electron density $n$ and coupling $J'/t$. Our
magnetic configurations are generated by exact diagonalisation-based Langevin
dynamics, while the conductivity is computed using the Kubo formula on exact
eigenstates. We work on lattices of size $20 \times 20$ and can access electron
density down to $n \sim 0.01$. The electron system remains homogeneous either
when the mean density is large or when the coupling $J'$ is small. In these
situations, the resistivity $\rho(T)$ displays a monotonic increase with
temperature and can be understood within a perturbative framework. However, at
very low density $n \lesssim 0.05$, strong coupling $J'/t \gtrsim 1$, and for
$T \sim T_c$, the electrons can locally polarise the magnetic state, create a
trapping potential, and form a bound state in it. The resistivity associated
with this polaronic phase is distinctly non-monotonic, with a peak near $T_c$.
We establish the boundary that separates the many-body polaronic window from
traditional scattering and extract a universal form for the resistivity in the
scattering regime. We suggest the origin of the `excess resistivity' in the
polaronic regime in terms of an increasing fraction of localised states as the
temperature tends to $T_c$. This pushes the mobility edge towards the chemical
potential $\mu$ and results in enhanced scattering of momentum states near
$k_F$. While our specific results are in two dimensions, the phenomenology we
uncover should be valid even in three dimensions.

### Observation of Hexagonal Close-Packed Water Ice at Extreme Pressures and Temperatures

The determination of the phase diagram of water ice under extreme conditions
remains a fundamental challenge in high-pressure physics. While theoretical
predictions have long suggested the existence of compact phases, such as
face-centered cubic (fcc) and hexagonal close-packed (hcp) structures, yet only
the fcc phase has been experimentally confirmed. Here, we report the first
direct observation of a hcp ice phase using synchrotron x-ray diffraction in
laser-heated diamond anvil cells. Between 80 and 200 GPa, we observe the
coexistence of fcc and hcp ice, arising from stacking disorder in the fcc
oxygen layers, similar to phenomena seen in compressed noble gases. Above 200
GPa, the hcp phase becomes dominant and is recovered at 300 K, indicating its
increased thermodynamic stability at ultrahigh pressures. These findings not
only expand our understanding of water's complex behavior under extreme
conditions but also may play a crucial role in the interiors of giant icy
planets.

### Bonding Character as a Descriptor for Huang-Rhys Factors in Optically Active Defects

The electron phonon coupling of a defect characterized by its Huang Rhys (HR)
factor is a crucial metric determining its excited-state dynamics, relevant to
defect applications as qubits and quantum emitters. However, HR factors remain
challenging to calculate from first principles, complicated by convergence
issues in excited-state relaxation and time consuming phonon calculations. Even
when calculated, HR factors lack a rational design principle. Here we show that
an orbital-based descriptor can be used to rationalize and efficiently estimate
HR factors. Combining this descriptor with a ground state deformation technique
allows circumventing both excited state relaxation and full phonon
calculations. Specifically, our descriptor for HR factors is constructed using
bonding character differences obtained from ground state density functional
theory, measured using crystal orbital Hamilton populations. We demonstrate
this descriptor for prototypical hBN defects and the diamond NV center. This
orbital-based descriptor can be potentially used in high throughput
computational screening to identify ideal candidates of spin qubits and SPEs.

### Magnetic and phononic dynamics in the two-ladder quantum magnet (C5H9NH3)2CuBr4

In quantum magnetic materials it is common to observe both static and dynamic
lattice effects on the magnetic excitation spectrum. Less common is to find
that the magnetic correlations have a significant impact on the phonon
spectrum. Can such an interplay occur in a structurally soft system with
comparable elastic and magnetic energy scales? Here we study the metal-organic
material (C5H9NH3)2CuBr4 (Cu-CPA), in which an explanation of the low-lying
excitations depends crucially on a full understanding of both the spin and
lattice subsystems. We report high-resolution neutron spectroscopy enabled by
large, deuterated single-crystals that reveal how both sectors are affected by
the recently discovered structural phase transition. By measuring over several
Brillouin zones, we disentangle the vibrational contribution to the spectrum in
order to obtain an accurate estimate of the quasi-one-dimensional magnetic
signal. The low-energy magnetic excitations are dominated by two gaps, $\Delta$
b = 0.41 meV and $\Delta$ a = 0.55 meV, which contribute with equal intensity
ratios, confirming that Cu-CPA realizes a two-ladder spin Hamiltonian, and we
deduce the magnetic interaction parameters of both ladders. The phonon spectrum
contains a highly localized mode at an anomalously low-energy around 2 meV.
This characteristic frequency drops by approximately 5 percent as magnetic
correlations become established with decreasing temperature, and we connect
this behavior with the location and structure of the cyclopentylammonium rings.

### Energy evolution in nanocrystalline iron driven by collision cascades

- **TL;DR**: 通过分子动力学模拟研究纳米晶铁在辐照下的行为，发现辐照会驱动所有纳米晶样品向单晶状态转变，并在约4 dpa后达到能量平台期。

Nanocrystalline materials are promising candidates for future fusion reactor
applications, due to their high density of grain boundaries which may serve as
sinks for irradiation induced defects. We use molecular dynamics to simulate
collision cascades in nanocrystalline iron and compare these to collision
cascades in initially defect free single crystals. We create nanocrystalline
samples via Voronoi tessellation of initially randomly placed grain seeds and
via severe plastic shearing. An irradiation induced annealing is observed
whereby after ~ 2 displacements per atom (dpa), irradiation drives all
simulation cells to a single crystalline state. Irradiation-induced defects
that distort the lattice generate elastic strain, so we use excess potential
energy as a measure of defect content. At low doses, the Voronoi samples
feature a few large, low energy grains, whereas the sheared samples show many
small, high energy grains due to the high defect and grain boundary content
caused by severe deformation. As dose increases beyond 1 dpa however, all
nanocrystalline samples converge to a similar behaviour. Excess potential
energy mirrors this trend, plateauing above ~ 4 dpa. We hypothesise that the
initially pristine cells will also reach a similar plateau after 5 dpa, which
is seemingly confirmed by running a single instance of each cell type to 10
dpa. A model is developed to explain the energy evolution.

### Equilibrium Spin Polarization Arising From Chirality

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种伪厄米量子框架，通过结构手性和电子关联解释手性诱导自旋选择性(CISS)现象，解决了与微观可逆性和昂萨格互易性的矛盾。

Chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) describes how chiral molecules and
materials generate spin polarization even at thermal equilibrium. This
observation has challenged established principles of microscopic reversibility
and Onsager reciprocity. We resolve this paradox by formulating a
pseudo-Hermitian quantum framework in which structural chirality and electron
correlations are sufficient to produce CISS observables. Chirality enters
through a non-local metric that couples spin and spatial motion, leading to
real spectra, unitary evolution, and thermodynamic consistency. The framework
predicts a chirality-induced spin magnetic ordering characterized by a
spin--displacement order $\langle \sigma \cdot x \rangle$, which reconciles
equilibrium spin polarization with detailed balance and explains the
persistence of CISS in materials composed of light elements. We also derive
generalized Onsager-Casimir relations that respect the observed parity
($\mathcal{P}$) and time-reversal ($\mathcal{T}$) breaking, while preserving
combined $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry. This approach establishes a coherent
foundation for equilibrium CISS and provides a route to link chemical chirality
with measurable spin-to-charge conversion effects.

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to investigate the
influence of mechanical strain on irradiation-induced defect and dislocation
evolution in nickel single crystals subjected to cumulative overlapping 5 keV
collision cascades at 300 K. The simulations reveal that tensile strain
modifies the dynamics of defect generation and recovery, promoting
stress-assisted defect mobility and enhancing defect survival compared to the
unstrained case. The heat spike duration and intensity decrease systematically
with increasing strain, indicating faster energy dissipation and altered defect
recombination behavior under applied stress. Analysis of the dislocation
structure shows that Shockley-type partial dislocations dominate the
microstructural response, while Hirth and other dislocation types remain
comparatively minor. Both the total and Shockley dislocation densities reach a
saturation value of $~10^{16}m^{-2}$ , marking the establishment of a
steady-state microstructure governed by the balance between dislocation
accumulation and recovery. The evolution of the total dislocation density with
strain is successfully described by the Kocks-Mecking model, demonstrating its
applicability to strain-dependent irradiation effects in metallic systems

Tuning magnetic anisotropy through chemical doping is a powerful strategy for
designing functional materials with enhanced magnetic properties. Here, we
report an enhanced Er^3+ magnetic moment resulting from nonmagnetic Lu^3+
substitution in the honeycomb-lattice antiferromagnet ErOCl. Unlike the
Curie-Weiss type divergence typically observed in diluted magnetic systems, our
findings reveal a distinct enhancement of magnetization per Er^3+ ion under
high magnetic fields, suggesting an unconventional mechanism. Structural
analysis reveals that Lu^3+ doping leads to a pronounced contraction of the c
axis, which is attributed to chemical pressure effects, while preserving the
layered SmSI-type crystal structure with space group R-3m. High-resolution
Raman spectroscopy reveals a systematic blueshift of the first and seventh
crystalline electric field (CEF) excitations, indicating an increase in the
axial CEF parameter B_2^0. This modification enhances the magnetic anisotropy
along the c axis, leading to a significant increase in magnetization at low
temperatures and under high magnetic fields, contrary to conventional
expectations for magnetic dilution. Our work not only clarifies the intimate
connection between magnetism and CEF in rare-earth compounds, but more
importantly, it reveals a physical pathway to effectively tune magnetic
anisotropy via anisotropic lattice distortion induced by chemical pressure.

strong excitonic effects, with flat O-p-derived valence bands tunable under
strain. These features allow the design of flat band materials with ultra large
electronic gaps in low-dimensional systems, making these materials promising
for devices operation at higher voltages and temperatures than conventional
semiconductor materials.

Quantitative electron magnetic circular dichroism (EMCD) in transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) enables the measurement of magnetic moments with
elemental and atomic site sensitivity, but its practical application is
fundamentally limited by noise. This study presents a comprehensive methodology
for noise estimation and suppression in EMCD measurements, demonstrated on
Ti-doped barium hexaferrite lamellae. By employing a classical three-beam
geometry and long-term acquisition of electron energy-loss spectra, we
systematically analyze the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) across individual energy
channels using bootstrap statistics. A robust energy alignment procedure based
on the neighboring Ba-M4,5 edges with an adequate energy upsampling is
introduced to minimize systematic errors from energy misalignment. The impact
of detector noise, particularly from CMOS-based EELS cameras, is evaluated
through variance-to-mean analysis and described by the noise amplification
coefficients, revealing that detector-amplified shot noise is the dominant
noise source. We recommend a stricter SNR threshold for reliable EMCD detection
and quantification, ensuring that critical spectral features such as the
Fe-L2,3 peaks meet the requirements for quantitative analysis. The approach
also provides a framework for determining the minimum electron dose necessary
for valid measurements and can be generalized to scintillator-based or direct
electron detectors. This work advances the reliability of EMCD as a
quantitative tool for magnetic characterization at the nanoscale with unknown
magnetic structures. The proposed procedures lay the groundwork for improved
error handling and SNR optimization in future EMCD studies.

Engineering van Hove singularities (vHss) near the Fermi level, if feasible,
offers a powerful route to control exotic quantum phases in electronic and
magnetic behaviors. However, conventional approaches, which rely primarily on
chemical and electrical doping, focus mainly on local electrical or optical
measurements, limiting their applicability to coupled functionalities. In this
study, a vHs-induced insulator-metal transition coupled with a ferromagnetic
phase transition was empirically achieved in atomically designed quasi-2D
SrRuO3 (SRO) superlattices via epitaxial strain engineering, which has not been
observed in conventional 3D SRO systems. Theoretical calculations revealed that
epitaxial strain effectively modulates the strength and energy positions of vHs
of specific Ru orbitals, driving correlated phase transitions in the electronic
and magnetic ground states. X-ray absorption spectroscopy confirmed the
anisotropic electronic structure of quasi-2D SRO modulated by epitaxial strain.
Magneto-optic Kerr effect and electrical transport measurements demonstrated
modulated magnetic and electronic phases. Furthermore, magneto-electrical
measurements detected significant anomalous Hall effect signals and
ferromagnetic magnetoresistance, indicating the presence of magnetically
coupled charge carriers in the 2D metallic regime. This study establishes
strain engineering as a promising platform for tuning vHss and resultant
itinerant ferromagnetism of low-dimensional correlated quantum systems.

of these defects, characterized morphologically and statistically, defines what
is called the "primary damage". In this work, we present a fully unsupervised
machine learning (ML) workflow that detects and classifies these defects
directly from molecular dynamics data. Local environments are encoded by the
Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP) vector, anomalous atoms are isolated
with autoencoder neural networks (AE), embedded with Uniform Manifold
Approximation and Projection (UMAP) and clustered using Hierarchical
Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN). Applied
to 80 keV displacement cascades in Ni, Fe$_7$0Ni$_{10}$Cr$_{20}$, and Zr, the
AE successfully identify the small fraction of outlier atoms that participate
in defect formation. HDBSCAN then partitions the UMAP latent space of
AE-flagged SOAP descriptors into well defined groups representing vacancy- and
interstitial-dominated regions and, within each, separates small from large
aggregates, assigning 99.7 % of outliers to compact physical motifs. A signed
cluster-identification score confirms this separation, and cluster size scales
with net defect counts (R2 &gt; 0.89). Statistical cross analyses between the ML
outlier map and several conventional detectors (centrosymmetry, dislocation
extraction, etc.) reveal strong overlap and complementary coverage, all
achieved without template or threshold tuning. This ML workflow thus provides
an efficient tool for the quantitative mapping of structural anomalies in
materials, particularly those arising from irradiation damage in displacement
cascades.

Kagome metals are an intriguing class of quantum materials as the presence of
both flat bands and Dirac points provides access to functional properties
present in strongly correlated and topological materials. To fully harness
these electronic features, the ability to tune the Fermi level relative to the
band positions is needed. Here we explore the structural, electronic and
magnetic impacts of substitutional alloying within ferromagnetic kagome metal
Fe3Sn2 in thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy. Transition metals Mn and
Co are chosen as substitutes for Fe to reduce or increase the d-band electron
count, thereby moving the Fermi level accordingly. We find that Co is not
incorporated into the Fe3Sn2 structure but instead results in a two-phase Fe-Co
and (Fe,Co)Sn composite. In contrast, Fe3-xMnxSn2 films are realized with x up
to 1.0, retaining crystalline quality comparable to the parent phase. The
incorporation of Mn repositions the flat bands relative to the Fermi level in a
manner consistent with hole-doping, as revealed by hard x-ray photoemission and
density functional theory. The Fe3-xMnxSn2 films retain room temperature
ferromagnetism, with x-ray magnetic circular dichroism measurements confirming
that the Fe and Mn moments are ferromagnetically aligned. The ability to
hole-dope this magnetic kagome metal provides a platform for tuning properties
such as anomalous Hall and Nernst responses.

- **TL;DR**: 通过不同客体分子的插层调控MnPS3的磁性性质，引入Mn2+空位实现从反铁磁到复杂磁结构的转变，包括饱和磁化为1μB/原子的亚铁磁态。

The magnetic properties of van der Waals materials are profoundly influenced
by structural defects. The layered antiferromagnet MnPS3 offers a unique
opportunity to explore defect-related magnetism, as Mn2+ vacancies can be
generated by the intercalation of specific guest molecules. However, the
effectiveness of this process in atomically thin flakes and the extent of the
magnetic tunability remain unclear. Here, we show that the magnetic properties
of MnPS3 can be tailored through the intercalation of different guest
molecules. Notably, the insertion of four alkylammonium ions introduces
different populations of Mn2+ vacancies, leading to a transition from the
pristine antiferromagnetic state to more complex magnetic textures, including a
ferrimagnetic state displaying a magnetic saturation of 1 uB/atom. Moreover, we
show that the intercalation of few-nm-thick flakes also leads to the emergence
of a ferrimagnetic response. This in-flake intercalation, which can be
monitored in real time using optical microscopy, can be interrupted before
completion, generating lateral heterostructures between pristine and
intercalated areas. This approach opens the way to the use of partial
intercalation to define regions with distinct magnetic properties within a
single flake.

- **TL;DR**: 研究探讨了硅、钴、银掺杂的类金刚石碳涂层在胺基嵌段共聚物润滑剂下的摩擦学行为，发现硅掺杂DLC具有最低摩擦系数和磨损，通过第一性原理计算揭示了掺杂剂-聚合物相互作用对边界层形成的关键作用。

This study examines the tribological behavior of diamond-like carbon (DLC)
coatings doped with silicon (Si), cobalt (Co), or silver (Ag) in the presence
of an amine-functionalized block copolymer lubricant. Under boundary
lubrication, Si-doped DLC (Si-DLC) exhibited the lowest coefficient of friction
($\approx$0.045) and nearly 45% lower wear than undoped DLC. Co-DLC showed
moderate improvement, while Ag-DLC provided no significant benefit.
Cross-sectional FIB-TEM revealed thin tribofilms, 12-17 nm in thickness, on Si-
and Co-doped surfaces. As reported for Si-DLC, these films incorporate
copolymer-derived fragments, suggesting a similar composition for Co-DLC. These
results indicate that dopant-polymer interactions are key to the development of
self-organized boundary layers. To gain atomic-level insight, first-principles
calculations were carried out on the adsorption of the dimethylaminoethyl
methacrylate (DMAEMA) unit, the copolymer's functional group. The calculated
adsorption energies were $-$2.27 to $-$0.57 eV for Si-DLC, $-$1.73 to $-$1.49
eV for Co(0001), and $-$1.21 to $-$1.08 eV for Ag(111). The order of stability
(Si $&gt;$ Co $&gt;$ Ag) was consistent with the experimental tribological ranking.
Chemical bonding dominated for Si-DLC, while Ag showed mainly weak
physisorption. Simulated pull-off forces further reflected this hierarchy, with
N-Si bonds requiring about twice the force of N-Co and nearly five times that
of N-Ag. The correspondence between adsorption strength and tribological
response highlights the decisive role of dopant species in tribofilm formation.
These findings provide guidance for designing durable low-friction surfaces in
applications such as electric drivetrains and precision mechanical systems.
