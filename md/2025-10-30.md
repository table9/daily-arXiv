- **TL;DR**: 开发了一种泵浦-探测频闪光谱技术，用于灵敏检测混合磁振子学中的磁光动力学，结合微波和光学脉冲实现高能量分辨率和高效率检测。

We demonstrate a pump-probe strobe light spectroscopy for sensitive detection
of magneto-optical dynamics in the context of hybrid magnonics. The technique
uses a combinatorial microwave-optical pump-probe scheme, leveraging both the
high-energy resolution of microwaves and the high-efficiency detection using
optical photons. In contrast to conventional stroboscopy using a
continuous-wave light, we apply microwave and optical pulses with varying pulse
widths, and demonstrate magnetooptical detection of magnetization dynamics in
Y3Fe5O12 films. The detected magneto-optical signals strongly depend on the
characteristics of both the microwave and the optical pulses as well as their
relative time delays. We show that good magneto-optical sensitivity and
coherent stroboscopic character are maintained even at a microwave pump pulse
of 1.5 ns and an optical probe pulse of 80 ps, under a 7 megahertz clock rate,
corresponding to a pump-probe footprint of ~1% in one detection cycle. Our
results show that time-dependent strobe light measurement of magnetization
dynamics can be achieved in the gigahertz frequency range under a pump-probe
detection scheme.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文研究拓扑绝缘体的基础和技术方面，特别关注铋化合物在光伏应用中的可行性以及结构无序对其性质的影响。

Topological phases of matter have garnered significant interest over the past
two decades for two main reasons: their identification, via topological
invariants, relies on the quantum geometry of the Bloch states, bringing
attention to an aspect of electronic band structure overlooked up to their
discovery. Secondly, these classes of materials present electronic states with
unusual properties, leading to exotic phenomena and making them relevant for
potential applications. In this thesis we explore both fundamental and
technological aspects of the first discovered topological phase: the
topological insulator. To this end, we consider different models of topological
insulators with a particular emphasis on Bismuth compounds, evaluating their
viability for photovoltaic applications, and separately, the impact of
structural disorder on their properties.

### Single-Shot All-Optical Switching in CoFeB/MgO Magnetic Tunnel Junctions

- **TL;DR**: 该论文展示了在无稀土CoFeB/MgO磁性隧道结中实现单次全光开关，通过调控覆盖层厚度实现精确热控制，使磁化从平行态确定性地反转到反平行态，并通过隧道磁电阻效应检测到微米级MTJ器件中的磁化反转。

We demonstrate single shot al optical switching (AOS) in rare earth free
CoFeB/MgO magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs), a material system widely adopted in
spin transfer torque magnetic random access memory (STT MRAM). By tuning the
capping layer thickness, we show that precise heat control enables
deterministic magnetization reversal from parallel (P) to antiparallel (AP)
state. Furthermore, we detect magnetization reversal in a micro scale MTJ
device via the tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) effect. Our findings suggest that
ultrafast spin transport or dipolar interactions or a combination of both may
play essential roles in the switching process. This work represents a
significant step toward integrating AOS with MTJ technology.

### Strain Engineering of Correlated Charge-Ordered Phases in 1T-TaS2

- **TL;DR**: 该研究通过应变工程调控1T-TaS2薄膜的电荷密度波相变，开发了基于电阻变化的应变传感器。

Strain engineering is a powerful strategy for controlling the structural and
electronic properties of two-dimensional materials, particularly in systems
hosting charge density wave (CDW) order. In this work, we apply uniaxial
tensile and compressive strain to thin 1T-TaS2 flakes using a flexible,
device-compatible platform, and systematically investigate the strain-dependent
behavior of the nearly commensurate (NC) to incommensurate (IC) CDW phase
transition. This transition is driven by Joule heating at room temperature.
Electrical transport measurements reveal that both the switching threshold
voltage and the resistance of the NC-CDW phase exhibit clear, reversible strain
dependence. Furthermore, we identify a quadratic dependence between the
strain-induced resistance change and the threshold voltage, confirming that
piezoresistive modulation governs the strain-tunability of the phase
transition. We demonstrate a room-temperature, electrically-readout strain and
displacement sensor with threshold-like response in a programmable window.
These results highlight the potential of 1T-TaS2 for on-chip sensing of strain
and displacement.

### Finite-Temperature Study of the Hubbard Model via Enhanced Exponential Tensor Renormalization Group

- **TL;DR**: 提出增强型1s⁺指数张量重整化群算法，实现二维Hubbard模型的高效有限温度模拟，计算成本降低50%，温度可降至T≈0.004t，可直接研究超导序并构建相图数据集。

The two-dimensional (2D) Hubbard model has long attracted interest for its
rich phase diagram and its relevance to high-$T_c$ superconductivity. However,
reliable finite-temperature studies remain challenging due to the exponential
complexity of many-body interactions. Here, we introduce an enhanced
$1\text{s}^+$ eXponential Tensor Renormalization Group algorithm that enables
efficient finite-temperature simulations of the 2D Hubbard model. By exploring
an expanded space, our approach achieves two-site update accuracy at the
computational cost of a one-site update, and delivers up to 50% acceleration
for Hubbard-like systems, which enables simulations down to
$T\!\approx\!0.004t$. This advance permits a direct investigation of
superconducting order over a wide temperature range and facilitates a
comparison with zero-temperature infinite Projected Entangled Pair State
simulations. Finally, we compile a comprehensive dataset of snapshots spanning
the relevant region of the phase diagram, providing a valuable reference for
Artificial Intelligence-driven analyses of the Hubbard model and a comparison
with cold-atom experiments.

### Amide Hydrogen Deuterium Exchange in Isotopically Mixed Waters

- **TL;DR**: 提出了广义Linderstrom-Lang模型，解决了氢氘交换实验中反向交换和同位素效应的问题，能够从混合物实验中获得准确的保护因子和分馏因子。

Hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX) of protein backbone amides provides a
powerful probe of conformational dynamics. However, when experiments are
performed in H2O/D2O mixtures, quantitative interpretation is hindered by back
exchange and isotope effects not captured by the classical Linderstrom-Lang
(LL) model. We introduce a generalized Linderstrom-Lang (GLL) framework that
explicitly accounts for forward and reverse exchange and for changes in
protection upon isotopic substitution. Analytical solutions describe
equilibrium enrichment (fractionation) and protection factors in mixtures,
reducing to the LL model in pure D2O. Application to HDX/NMR of the molecular
chaperone DNAJB1 in 50% D2O demonstrates that the GLL model recovers protection
factors at 100% D2O. Ignoring back exchange (i.e., using the LL model) causes
protection factors to be systematically underestimated. A particularly powerful
feature of our approach is that a single HDX experiment in a mixture (e.g., 50%
D2O) simultaneously provides protection factors that report on conformational
dynamics and local stability, and fractionation factors that are sensitive to
the local hydrogen-bonding environment.

### Discovery of Hyperelastic Constitutive Laws from Experimental Data with EUCLID

- **TL;DR**: EUCLID框架在实验数据上的性能评估，比较传统材料模型参数识别与自动化模型发现方法在天然橡胶材料上的表现。

We assess the performance of EUCLID, Efficient Unsupervised Constitutive Law
Identification and Discovery, a recently proposed framework for automated
discovery of constitutive laws, on experimental data. Mechanical tests are
performed on natural rubber specimens spanning simple to complex geometries,
from which we collect both global, force elongation, and local, full-field
displacement, measurements. Using these data, we obtain constitutive laws via
two routes, the conventional identification of unknown parameters in a priori
selected material models, and EUCLID, which automates model selection and
parameter identification within a unified model-discovery pipeline. We compare
the two methodologies using global versus local data, analyze predictive
accuracy, and examine generalization to unseen geometries. Moreover, we
quantify the experimental noise, investigate the coverage of the material state
space achieved by each approach and discuss the relative performance of
different datasets and different a priori chosen models versus EUCLID.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文研究了自旋玻璃在量子退火硬件相关网络架构上的非指数弛豫行为，揭示了挫败和紊乱如何共同调控弛豫动力学。

Understanding how frustration and disorder shape relaxation in complex
systems is a central problem in statistical physics and quantum annealing.
Spin-glass models provide a natural framework to explore this connection, as
their energy landscapes are governed by competing interactions and constrained
topologies. We investigate the non-exponential relaxation behavior of spin
glasses on network architectures relevant to quantum annealing hardware -- such
as finite size Chimera, Pegasus, and Zephyr graphs -- where embedding
constraints and finite connectivity strongly modulate the distribution of
barriers and metastable states. This slow relaxation arises from the combined
effects of frustration and disorder, which persist even beyond the conventional
spin-glass transition. Within the Fortuin-Kasteleyn-Coniglio-Klein (FKCK)
cluster formalism, the appearance of unfrustrated cluster regions gives rise to
multiple relaxation scales, as distinct domains follow different dynamical
pathways across a rugged energy landscape. This framework enables a more
comprehensive characterization of spin-glass energy landscapes and offers
valuable insight into how topological constraints and disorder jointly govern
relaxation dynamics, providing quantitative benchmarks for evaluating the
performance and limitations of quantum annealing architectures.

### A Universal Scaling Law for $T_c$ in Unconventional Superconductors

- **TL;DR**: 该论文建立了一个统一的Tc标度关系：N_CP·k_BT_c* = α·U，其中α=1/(16π)是普适常数，揭示了不同非常规超导体可能共享相同的超导机制。

Understanding the pairing mechanism of unconventional superconductors remains
a core challenge in condensed matter physics, particularly the ongoing debate
over whether the related effects caused by electron-electron interactions unify
various unconventional superconductors (UcSs). To address this challenge, it is
necessary to establish a universal quantitative relationship for the
superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$), which can be directly obtained
from experiments and correlated with microscopic parameters of different
material systems. In this work, we establish a relation: $N_{\text{CP}}\cdot
k_{B}T_{c}^\star = \alpha\cdot U $, where $\alpha = 1/(16\pi)$ is a universal
constant, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T_{c}^\star$ is the maximal
$T_{c}$, $U$ is the on-site Coulomb interaction, and
$N_{\text{CP}}$($\propto(\xi_0/a)^D$) quantifies the spatial extent of Cooper
pairs ($\xi_0$) relative to lattice parameter ($a$) in $D$ dimensions. The
validity of this scaling relationship is empirically demonstrated, across a
four order-of-magnitude $T_c^\star$ range (0.08--133 K), by database from 173
different compounds spanning 13 different UcS families in over 500 experiments.
The fact that the unified relationship is satisfied by different materials of
different UcS families reveals that they may share superconducting mechanisms.
In addition, the scaling relationship indicates the existence of a maximum
$T_{c}^\star$ determined by the minimum $N_{\text{CP}}$, providing a benchmark
for theoretical and experimental exploration of high-temperature
superconductivity.

### Molecular simulations of Perovskites CsXI3 (X = Pb,Sn) Using Machine-Learning Interatomic Potentials

- **TL;DR**: 开发了基于机器学习原子间势能（MLIPs）的LATTE框架，用于高效模拟铯基卤化物钙钛矿（CsPbI3和CsSnI3）的相变和结构稳定性，揭示了铅基和锡基钙钛矿在结构稳定性和相变温度上的差异。

Cesium based halide perovskites, such as CsPbI3 and CsSnI3, have emerged as
exceptional candidates for next generation photovoltaic and optoelectronic
technologies, but their practical application is limited by temperature
dependent phase transitions and structural instabilities. Here, we develop
machine learning interatomic potentials within the LATTE framework to simulate
these materials with near experimental accuracy at a fraction of the
computational cost compared to previous computational studies. Our molecular
dynamics simulations based on the trained MLIPs reproduce energies and forces
across multiple phases, enabling large scale simulations that capture cubic
tetragonal orthorhombic transitions, lattice parameters, and octahedral tilting
with unprecedented resolution. We find that Pb based perovskites exhibit larger
octahedral tilts and higher phase transition temperatures than Sn based
analogues, reflecting stronger bonding and enhanced structural stability,
whereas Sn based perovskites display reduced tilts and lower barriers,
suggesting tunability through compositional or interface engineering. Beyond
these systems, our work demonstrates that MLIPs can bridge first principles
accuracy with simulation efficiency, providing a robust framework for exploring
phase stability, anharmonicity, and rational design in next generation halide
perovskites.

### Stability of Planar Slits in Multilayer Graphite Crystals

- **TL;DR**: 研究使用二维粗粒度链模型模拟多层石墨晶体中的平面狭缝，发现覆盖石墨晶体表面线性空腔的多层石墨烯片只有在空腔宽度不超过临界值L_o时才能形成开放狭缝，临界宽度随覆盖层数K单调增加。

Using a two-dimensional coarse-grained chain model, planar slits in
multilayer graphite crystals are simulated. It is shown that when covering a
linear cavity on the flat surface of a graphite crystal with a multilayer
graphene sheet, an open (unfilled slit) can form only if the cavity width does
not exceed a critical value L_o (for width L&gt;L_o, only a closed state of the
slit is formed, with the cavity space filled by the covering sheet). The
critical width of the open slit L_o increases monotonically with the number of
layers K in the covering sheet. For a single-layer cavity, there is a finite
critical value of its width L_o&lt;3nm, while for two- and three-layer cavities,
the maximum width of the open slit increases infinitely with increasing K as a
power function K^\alpha with exponent 0&lt;\alpha&lt;1. Inside the crystal, two- and
three-layer slits can have stable open states at any width. For a slit with
width L&gt;7.6nm, a stationary closed state is also possible, in which its lower
and upper surfaces adhere to each other. Simulation of thermal oscillations
showed that open states of two-layer slits with width L&lt;15nm are always stable
against thermal oscillations, while wider slits at T&gt;400K transition from the
open to the closed state. Open states of three-layer slits are always stable
against thermal oscillations.

### Monte Carlo study on critical exponents of the classical Heisenberg model in ferromagnetic icosahedral quasicrystal

- **TL;DR**: 本文通过蒙特卡洛模拟研究了二十面体准晶中的铁磁有序现象，发现了新的普适性类别，并揭示了准晶中独特的铁磁转变机制。

Quasicrystals (QCs) lack three-dimensional periodicity of atomic arrangement
but possess long-range structural order, which are distinct from periodic
crystals and random systems. Here, we show how the ferromagnetic (FM) order
arises in the icosahedral QC (i-QC) on the basis of the Monte Carlo simulation
of the Heisenberg model on the Yb lattice of Cd$_{5.7}$Yb composed of regular
icosahedrons. By finite-size scaling of the Monte Carlo data, we identified the
critical exponents of the magnetization, magnetic susceptibility, and spin
correlation length, $\beta=0.508(30)$, $\gamma=1.361(59)$, and $\nu=0.792(17)$,
respectively. We confirmed that our data satisfy the hyperscaling relation and
estimated the other critical exponents $\alpha=-0.376(51)$, $\delta=3.68(23)$,
and $\eta=0.282(65)$. These results show a new universality class inherent in
the i-QC, which is different from those in periodic magnets and spin glasses.
In the i-QC, each Yb site at vertices of the regular icosahedrons is classified
into 8 classes with respect to the coordination numbers of the nearest-neighbor
and next-nearest-neighbor bonds. We revealed the FM-transition mechanism by
showing that the difference in the local environment of each site is governed
by cooperative evolution of spin correlations upon cooling, giving rise to the
critical phenomena.

Efficient computation of molecular integrals and Hartree-Fock energy remains
a central topic in quantum-chemistry algorithm development. Although many
sophisticated open-source packages are available, understanding their
implementations from first principles can be difficult for students and
developers alike. In this work, we present a concise overview and an extensible
pedagogical framework that implements the Hartree-Fock method and the
McMurchie-Davidson scheme for molecular integral evaluation. The implementation
follows an object-oriented design in C++, emphasizing clarity and modularity.
We also discuss strategies for parallel execution, including distributed
computing with MPI and shared-memory parallelization with OpenMP. Beyond
presenting a working reference, this work establishes a learning platform for
further exploration, including suggested mini-projects for algorithmic
optimization and HPC scalability. The accompanying open-source library, FSIM,
described in this work, serves as a compact resource for teaching and research
in computational chemistry and high-performance computing.

- **TL;DR**: Gen-COMPAS是一个生成式承诺器引导路径采样框架，用于高效重建分子转变路径，无需预定义变量，成本仅为传统方法的极小部分。

Molecular transitions -- such as protein folding, allostery, and membrane
transport -- are central to biology yet remain notoriously difficult to
simulate. Their intrinsic rarity pushes them beyond reach of standard molecular
dynamics, while enhanced-sampling methods are costly and often depend on
arbitrary variables that bias outcomes. We introduce Gen-COMPAS, a generative
committor-guided path sampling framework that reconstructs transition pathways
without predefined variables and at a fraction of the cost. Gen-COMPAS couples
a generative diffusion model, which produces physically realistic
intermediates, with committor-based filtering to pinpoint transition states.
Short unbiased simulations from these intermediates rapidly yield full
transition-path ensembles that converge within nanoseconds, where conventional
methods require orders of magnitude more sampling. Applied to systems from a
miniprotein to a ribose-binding protein to a mitochondrial carrier, Gen-COMPAS
retrieves committors, transition states, and free-energy landscapes
efficiently, uniting machine learning and molecular dynamics for broad
mechanistic and practical insight.

### Phonon dynamics and chiral modes in the two-dimensional square-octagon lattice

Chiral phonons, originally identified in two-dimensional hexagonal lattices
and later extended to kagome, square, and other lattices, have been extensively
studied as manifestations of broken inversion and time-reversal symmetries in
vibrational dynamics. In this work, we investigate the vibrational dynamics of
the two-dimensional square-octagon lattice using a spring-mass model with
central-force interactions. The model incorporates mass contrast and variable
coupling strengths among nearest, next-nearest, and third-nearest neighbors.
From the dynamical matrix, we obtain the phonon dispersion relations and
identify tunable phononic band gaps governed by both mass and spring-constant
ratios. The angular dependence of phase and group velocities is analyzed to
reveal the pronounced anisotropy inherent to this lattice geometry. We also
examine the distinctive features of the square-octagon geometry, including
flat-band anomalies in the density of states and anisotropic sound propagation
induced by longer-range couplings. In addition, we explore the emergence of
chiral phonons by introducing a time reversal symmetry-breaking term in the
dynamical matrix, and to elucidate their optical signatures, we construct a
minimal model to study infrared circular dichroism arising from chiral phonon
modes.

### Contactless cavity sensing of superfluid stiffness in atomically thin 4Hb-TaS$_2$

The exceptional tunability of two-dimensional van der Waals materials offers
unique opportunities for exploring novel superconducting phases. However, in
such systems, the measurement of superfluid phase stiffness, a fundamental
property of a superconductor, is challenging because of the mesoscopic sample
size. Here, we introduce a contact-free technique for probing the
electrodynamic response, and thereby the phase stiffness, of atomically thin
superconductors using on-chip superconducting microwave resonators. We
demonstrate this technique on 4Hb-TaS$_2$, a van der Waals superconductor whose
gap structure under broken mirror symmetry is under debate. In our cleanest
few-layer device, we observe a superconducting critical temperature comparable
to that of the bulk. The temperature evolution of the phase stiffness features
nodeless behavior in the presence of broken mirror symmetry, inconsistent with
the scenario of nodal surface superconductivity. With minimal fabrication
requirements, our technique enables microwave measurements across wide ranges
of two-dimensional superconductors.

### Improved operating voltage in InGaN-capped AlGaN-based DUV LEDs on bulk AlN substrates

- **TL;DR**: 通过使用7%InGaN帽层和SiO2保护层，实现了深紫外LED中p型和n型接触的协同优化，显著降低了工作电压和微分导通电阻。

Better wall plug efficiency of deep-ultraviolet light emitting diodes
(DUV-LEDs) requires simultaneous low resistivity p-type and n-type contacts,
which is a challenging problem. In this study, the co-optimization of p-InGaN
and n- AlGaN contacts for DUV LEDs are investigated. We find that using a thin
7%InGaN cap is effective in achieving ohmic p-contacts with specific contact
resistivity of 3.10x10^{-5} Ohm.cm^2. Upon monolithic integration of p- and n-
contacts for DUV LEDs, we find that the high temperature annealing of 800C
required for the formation of low resistance contacts to n-AlGaN severely
degrades the p-InGaN layer, thereby reducing the hole concentration and
increasing the specific contact resistivity to 9.72x10^{-4} Ohm.cm^2.
Depositing a SiO2 cap by plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PE-ALD) prior
to high temperature n-contact annealing restores the low p-contact resistivity,
enabling simultaneous low-resistance p- and n-contacts. DUV-LEDs emitting at

Magnetic skyrmions have been proposed as promising candidates for storing
information due to their high stability and easy manipulation by spin-polarized
currents. Here, we study how these properties are influenced by the interlayer
Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya interaction (IL-DMI), which stabilizes twin-skyrmions in
magnetic bilayers. We find that the spin configuration of the twin-skyrmion
adapts to the direction of the IL-DMI by elongating or changing the helicities
in the two layers. Driving the skyrmions by spin-polarized currents in the
current-perpendicular-to-plane configuration, we observe significant changes
either in the skyrmion velocity or in the skyrmion Hall angle depending on the
current polarization. These findings unravel further prospects for skyrmion
manipulation enabled by the IL-DMI.

We studied the magnetoresistance (MR) of well-characterized samples of
Co$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$Si at x=0.2, 0.4, and 0.65 at temperatures between 1.8 and
100~K and magnetic fields of 9~T. The quasilinear dependence of MR on the
magnetic field at low temperatures and the practically isotropic properties of
MR in these compounds are tentatively attributed to the specifics of Weyl
electron spectra and general disorder of the materials.

### Reactive capacitance of flat patches of arbitrary shape

We investigate the capacity of a flat partially reactive patch of arbitrary
shape to trap independent particles that undergo steady-state diffusion in the
three-dimensional space. We focus on the total flux of particles onto the patch
that determines its reactive capacitance. To disentangle the respective roles
of the reactivity and the shape of the patch, we employ a spectral expansion of
the reactive capacitance over a suitable Steklov eigenvalue problem. We derive
several bounds on the reactive capacitance to reveal its monotonicity with
respect to the reactivity and the shape. Two probabilistic interpretations are
presented as well. An efficient numerical tool is developed for solving the
associated Steklov spectral problem for patches of arbitrary shape. We propose
and validate, both theoretically and numerically, a simple, fully explicit
approximation for the reactive capacitance that depends only on the surface
area and the electrostatic capacitance of the patch. This approximation opens
promising ways to access various characteristics of diffusion-controlled
reactions in general domains with multiple small well-separated patches. Direct
applications of these results in statistical physics and physical chemistry are
discussed.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种六维可移动天线（6DMA）支持的宽带太赫兹通信系统，通过优化天线位置和旋转来减轻波束斜视效应，无需昂贵的真时延设备。

In this paper, we investigate a six-dimensional movable antenna
(6DMA)-enabled wideband terahertz (THz) communication system with sub-connected
hybrid beamforming architecture at the base station (BS). In particular, the
three-dimensional (3D) position and 3D rotation of each 6DMA surface can be
flexibly reconfigured to mitigate the beam squint effects instead of
introducing costly true-time-delay devices. We first analyze the normalized
array gain in the 6DMA-enabled wideband THz systems based on the beam squint
effects. Then, we formulate a sum-rate maximization problem via jointly
optimizing 3D positions, 3D rotations, and hybrid analog/digital beamforming.
To solve the non-convex problem, an alternating optimization algorithm is
developed that decomposes the original problem into three subproblems, which
are solved alternately. Specifically, given the positions and rotations of 6DMA
surfaces, we first reformulate the objective function and design a semidefinite
relaxation-based alternating minimization scheme to obtain the hybrid
analog/digital beamforming. Then, the positions and rotations of the 6DMA
surfaces are further optimized through a feasible gradient descent procedure.
The final solutions are obtained by repeating the above procedure until
convergence. Numerical results demonstrate the superior performance of the
proposed scheme compared with conventional fixed-position antenna
architectures.

We derive a formulation of the First Law of nonequilibrium thermodynamics for
biological information-processing systems by partitioning entropy in the Second
Law into microscopic and mesoscopic components and by assuming that natural
selection promotes optimal information processing and transmission. The
resulting framework demonstrates how mesoscopic information-based subsystems
can attain nonequilibrium steady states (NESS) sustained by external energy and
entropy fluxes, such as those generated by ATP/ADP imbalances in vivo.
Moreover, mesoscopic systems may reach NESS before microscopic subsystems,
leading to ordered structures in entropy flow analogous to eddies in a moving
stream.

Superconducting qubits have motivated the exploration of Josephson-junction
technologies beyond quantum computing, with emerging applications in low-energy
photon and phonon detection for astrophysics and dark matter searches.
Achieving sensitivity at the THz (meV) scale requires materials with smaller
superconducting gaps than those of conventional aluminum or niobium-based
devices. Here, we report the fabrication and characterization of hafnium
(Hf)-based Josephson junctions (Hf-HfOx-Hf), demonstrating Hf as a promising
low-Tc material platform for ultra-low threshold single THz photon and
single-phonon detection. Structural and chemical analyses reveal crystalline
films and well-defined oxide barriers, while electrical transport measurements
at both room and cryogenic temperatures exhibit clear Josephson behavior,
enabling extraction of key junction parameters such as critical current,
superconducting gap and normal-state resistance. This work presents the first
comprehensive study of Hf-based junctions and their potential for
next-generation superconducting detectors and qubit architectures leveraging
low superconducting gap energies.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文研究了hBN/SiC异质结构，发现通过移除特定位置的硼原子可以将层间相互作用从弱范德华耦合转变为强硅-氮共价键，从而实现过渡金属原子的可控锚定。

When two-dimensional atomic layers of different materials are brought into
close proximity to form van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures, interactions
between adjacent layers significantly influence their physicochemical
properties. These effects seem particularly pronounced when the interface
exhibits local order and near-perfect structural alignment, leading to the
emergence of Moir\'e patterns. Using quantum mechanical density functional
theory calculations, we propose a prototypical bilayer heterostructure composed
of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and silicon carbide (SiC), characterized by a
lattice mismatch of 18.77\% between their primitive unit cells. We find that
the removal of boron atoms from specific lattice sites can convert the
interlayer interaction from weak vdW coupling to robust localized
silicon-nitrogen covalent bonding. Motivated by this, we study the binding of
transition-metal adatoms and formulate design guidelines to enhance surface
reactivity, thereby enabling the controlled isolation of single-metal atoms.
Our machine-learning-assisted molecular dynamics simulations confirm both
dynamical stability and metal anchoring feasibility at finite temperatures. Our
results suggest the hBN/SiC heterostructure as a versatile platform for
atomically precise transition-metal functionalization, having potential for
next-generation catalytic energy-conversion technologies.

### A Topological Sum Rule for the Chirality of Carbon Nanotubes

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一个通用拓扑求和规则，将碳纳米管的螺旋性(n,m)与成核帽中六个五边形的位置坐标和直接关联，建立了从成核结构到最终手性的确定性关系。

The electronic properties of carbon nanotubes are fundamentally governed by
their chirality, specified by the integer indices (n,m). The lack of a
predictive theory directly connecting the architecture of the nucleation cap to
the resulting (n,m) has hindered the controlled synthesis of specific
chiralities. Here, we derive a universal topological sum rule that quantifies
this relationship. We show that (n,m) is uniquely determined by the sum of the
coordinates of the six pentagons in the cap. The complete set of these
coordinates, evaluated across rotationally symmetric lattice frames, fully
defines the carbon cap structure. This rule establishes that chirality is
encoded deterministically at nucleation, as any perturbation to the pentagon
positions overwhelmingly leads to a predictable, quanti able, and entropically
irreversible shift in (n,m). We further explain the preferential formation of
the (126) nanotube by identifying a six-fold symmetric cap with epitaxial
matching to the &lt;111&gt; catalyst facet. Our work provides a theoretical framework
that redefines the field, shifting the focus from growth kinetics to
deterministic nucleation programming and paving the way toward predictable
synthesis.

### Immobile and mobile excitations of three-spin interactions on the diamond chain

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种在钻石链上的可解一维自旋-1/2模型，具有三自旋相互作用，展示了驱动二阶相变的移动激发和完全不可移动的非平凡激发。

We present a solvable one-dimensional spin-1/2 model on the diamond chain
featuring three-spin interactions, which displays both, mobile excitations
driving a second-order phase transition between an ordered and a
$\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetry broken phase, as well as non-trivial fully immobile
excitations. The model is motivated by the physics of fracton excitations,
which only possess mobility in a reduced dimension compared to the full model.
We provide an exact mapping of this model to an arbitrary number of independent
transverse-field Ising chain segments with open boundary conditions. The number
and lengths of these segments correspond directly to the number of immobile
excitations and their respective distances from one another. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that multiple immobile excitations exhibit Casimir-like forces
between them, resulting in a non-trivial spectrum.

Creating a single unified interatomic potential capable of attaining ab
initio accuracy across all chemistry remains a long-standing challenge in
computational chemistry and materials science. This work introduces a training
protocol for foundation machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) that
bridge molecular, surface, and materials chemistry through cross-domain
learning. First, we introduce enhancements to the MACE architecture that
improve its performance on chemically diverse databases by increasing weight
sharing across chemical elements and introducing non-linear factors into the
tensor decomposition of the product basis. Second, we develop a multi-head
replay post-training methodology that enables efficient knowledge transfer
across diverse chemical domains. By fine-tuning on datasets at different levels
of electronic structure theory, including inorganic crystals, molecular
systems, surface chemistry, and reactive organic chemistry, we demonstrate that
a single unified model achieves state-of-the-art performance across several
chemical domains. Comprehensive benchmarking reveals superior cross-domain
transferability compared with existing specialised and multi-task models, with
notable improvements in molecular and surface properties while maintaining
state-of-the-art performance in materials-property prediction.

### Bayesian MINFLUX localization microscopy

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种基于贝叶斯理论的MINFLUX显微镜优化方法，相比现有启发式扫描模式，能在更少光子或更少曝光下实现纳米级分辨率

MINFLUX microscopy allows for localization of fluorophores with nanometer
precision using targeted scanning with an illumination profile with a minimum.
However, current scanning patterns and the overall procedure are based on
heuristics, and may therefore be suboptimal. Here we present a rigorous
Bayesian that offers maximal resolutions from either minimal detected photons
or minimal exposures. We estimate using simulated localization runs that this
approach should reduce the number of photons required for 1 nm resolution by a
factor of about four.

### Flocking in weakly nonreciprocal mixtures

- **TL;DR**: 弱非互易排列导致群体混合物中出现大规模结构形成，包括单向带结构和极性团簇，伴随两种物种的分离。

We show that weakly nonreciprocal alignment leads to large-scale structure
formation in flocking mixtures. By combining numerical simulations of a binary
Vicsek model and the analysis of coarse-grained continuum equations, we
demonstrate that nonreciprocity destabilizes the ordered phase formed by
mutually aligning or anti-aligning species in a large part of the phase
diagram. For aligning populations, this instability results in one species
condensing in a single band that travels within a homogeneous liquid of the
other species. When interactions are anti-aligning, both species self-assemble
into polar clusters with large-scale chaotic dynamics. In both cases, the
emergence of structures is accompanied by the demixing of the two species,
despite the absence of repulsive interactions. Our theoretical analysis allows
us to elucidate the origin of the instability, and show that it is generic to
nonreciprocal flocks.

### Spatially Inhomogeneous Triplet Pairing Order and Josephson Diode Effect Induced by Frustrated Spin Textures

We demonstrate that frustrated spin textures can generate anisotropic
Josephson couplings between $d$-vectors that can stabilize spatially varying
pairing orders in spin triplet superconductors. These couplings depend on the
relative orientation of $d$-vectors, analogous to Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya and
$\Gamma$-type interactions in magnetism, leading to an effective "pliability"
of the pairing order that competes with superfluid stiffness. Such couplings
cannot originate from spin-orbit coupling; rather, they can arise, for example,
when itinerant electrons are coupled to a local exchange field composed of
frustrated spin moments. Using a $T$-matrix expansion, we show that coupling to
a local exchange field leads to an effective tunneling of itinerant electrons
that is dependent on the underlying spin configurations at the barrier between
superconducting grains. Furthermore, Josephson tunneling through frustrated
spin textures can produce a Josephson diode effect. The diode effect originates
either from nonvanishing spin chirality in the barrier, or from antisymmetric
Josephson coupling between noncollinear $d$-vectors, both of which break
inversion and time-reversal symmetries.

### Trichome entanglement enhances damage tolerance in microstructured biocomposites

- **TL;DR**: 利用螺旋藻丝状体的物理缠结机制增强复合材料损伤容限，通过3D打印实现弯曲强度提升290%，断裂功提高15倍

Achieving damage tolerance in composite materials remains a central challenge
in materials science. Conventional strategies often rely on filler
incorporation or chemical modification, which can limit energy dissipation and
constrain structural stability. Here, we leverage the unique morphology of
Spirulina trichomes to investigate a reinforcement mechanism based on physical
filament entanglement. By comparing helical trichomes with their
morphologically straightened counterparts, we isolate filament geometry as the
key parameter governing mechanical performance. Trichome-based suspensions
exhibit enhanced viscoelastic response and a threefold increase in yield
stress. When processed via extrusion-based 3D printing using hydroxyethyl
cellulose (HEC) as a matrix, entangled trichomes yield a 290% improvement in
bending strength and a 15-fold enhancement in work of fracture. Fracture
surface analysis reveals a transition from interfacial debonding and pull-out
(in filaments) to crack propagation through the entangled network, indicating
structure-mediated toughening. These findings establish trichome entanglement
as a scalable, physically driven mechanism for enhancing damage tolerance
through microstructural architecture.

### Strongly nonlinear Bernstein modes in graphene reveal plasmon-enhanced near-field magnetoabsorption

- **TL;DR**: 在石墨烯中观测到非线性Bernstein模式，通过太赫兹激发和近场增强实现，这些模式在比回旋共振低近一个数量级的辐射强度下饱和，显示出强烈的非线性行为。

Bernstein modes -- hybrid magnetoplasmon excitations arising from the
coupling between cyclotron motion and collective oscillations in
two-dimensional electron systems -- offer direct access to non-local
electrodynamics. These modes can exhibit rich nonlinear behavior akin to
strong-coupling phenomena in cavity quantum electrodynamics, but reaching
nonlinear regime has remained experimentally challenging. Here we report the
observation of nonlinear Bernstein modes in graphene using terahertz excitation
with near-field enhancement from embedded metallic contacts. Photoresistance
spectroscopy reveals sharp resonances at Bc/2 and Bc/3 that saturate at
radiation intensities nearly an order of magnitude lower than the cyclotron
resonance. We ascribe this to strong local heating of the electron gas due to
resonant excitation of high-amplitude Bernstein magnetoplasmons, associated
with a combination of the field-concentration effect of the near field and
plasmonic amplification that is resonantly enhanced in the region of Bernstein
gaps. Polarization-resolved measurements further confirm the near-field origin:
Bernstein resonances are insensitive to circular helicity but strongly depend
on the angle of linear polarization, in sharp contrast to the cyclotron
resonance response. Our results establish graphene as a platform for nonlinear
magnetoplasmonics, opening opportunities for strong-field manipulation of
collective electron dynamics, out-of-equilibrium electron transport, and
solid-state analogues of cavity quantum electrodynamics.

### Quantum Spin Liquids Stabilized by Disorder in Non-Kramers Pyrochlores

- **TL;DR**: 该研究通过规范平均场理论分析无序量子自旋冰模型，发现量子自旋液相在结构无序条件下表现出惊人稳定性，仅在强场极化相变附近出现微小Griffiths区域。

This study investigates the emergence of quantum spin liquid phases in
pyrochlore oxides with non-Kramers ions, driven by structural randomness that
effectively acts as a transverse field, introducing quantum fluctuations on top
of the spin ice manifold. This is contrary to the naive expectation that
disorder favors phases with short-range entanglement by adjusting the spins
with their local environment. Given this unusual situation, it is essential to
assess the stability of the spin-liquid phase with respect to the disorder. To
perform this study, a minimal model for disordered quantum spin ice, the
transverse-field Ising model, is analyzed using a formulation of gauge
mean-field theory (GMFT) directly in real space. This approach allows the
inclusion of disorder effects exactly and provides access to non-perturbative
effects. The analysis shows that the quantum spin ice remains remarkably stable
with respect to disorder up to the transition to the polarized phase at high
fields, indicating that it can occur in real materials. Moreover, the Griffiths
region of enhanced disorder-induced fluctuations appears tiny and restricted to
the immediate vicinity of this transition due to the uniqueness of the
low-energy excitations of the problem. For most of the phase diagram, an
average description of the disorder captures the physical behavior well,
indicating that the inhomogeneous quantum spin ice behaves closely to its
homogeneous counterpart.

The study demonstrates the capabilities of a vector-based approach for
calculating stoichiometric coefficients in chemical equations, using black
powder as an illustrative example. A method is proposed for selecting and
constraining intermediate interactions between reactants, as well as for
identifying final products. It is shown that even a small number of components
can lead to a large number of final and intermediate products. Through concrete
calculations, a correlation is established between the number of possible
chemical equations and the number of reactants. A methodology is proposed for
computing all possible chemical equations within a reaction system for
arbitrary component ratios, enabling the derivation of all feasible chemical
reactions. Additionally, a method is developed for calculating the chemical
composition for a fixed set of reactants, allowing for the evaluation of the
set of products resulting from all possible chemical interactions given a
specified initial composition.

The GW plus Bethe-Salpeter equation (GW-BSE) formalism is a well-established
approach for calculating excitation energies and optical spectra of molecules,
nanostructures, and crystalline materials. We implement GW-BSE in the CP2K code
and validate the implementation for a standard organic molecular test set,
obtaining excellent agreement with reference data, with a mean absolute error
in excitation energies below 3 meV. We then study optical spectra of
nanographenes of increasing length, showing excellent agreement with
experiment. We further compute the size of the excitation of the lowest
optically active excitation which converges to about 7.6 $\r{A}$ with
increasing length. Comparison with time-dependent density functional theory
using functionals of varying exact-exchange fraction shows that none reproduce
both the size of the excitation and optical spectra of GW-BSE, underscoring the
need for many-body methods for accurate description of electronic excitations
in nanostructures.

- **TL;DR**: Error

We summarize key experimental studies of the low energy properties of
overdoped cuprate high temperature superconductors and conclude that a
theoretical understanding of the "essential physics" is achievable in terms of
a conventional Fermi-liquid treatment of the normal state, and a BCS mean-field
treatment of the (d-wave) superconducting state. For this perspective to be
consistent, it is necessary to posit that there is a crossover from a strongly
correlated underdoped regime (where a different theoretical perspective is
necessary) to the more weakly correlated overdoped regime. It is also necessary
to argue that the various observed features of the overdoped materials that are
inconsistent with this perspective can be attributed to the expected effects of
the intrinsic disorder associated with most of the materials being solid state
solutions (alloys). As a test of this idea, we make a series of falsifiable
predictions concerning the expected behavior of "ideal" (disorder free)
overdoped cuprates.

Ultrawide bandgap (UWBG) semiconductors exhibit exceptional electrical and
thermal properties, offering strong potential for high power and high frequency
electronics. However, efficient doping in UWBG materials is typically limited
to either n type or p type, constraining their application to unipolar devices.
The realization of pn junctions through heterogeneous integration of
complementary UWBG or WBG semiconductors is hindered by lattice mismatch and
thermal expansion differences. Here, we report the preliminary demonstration of
diamond GaN heterojunction pn diodes fabricated via grafting. A single
crystalline p plus diamond nanomembrane was integrated onto an epitaxially
grown c plane n plus GaN substrate with an ultrathin ALD Al2O3 interlayer. The
resulting diodes exhibit an ideality factor of 1.55 and a rectification ratio
of over 1e4. Structural and interfacial properties were examined by AFM, XRD,
Raman, and STEM, providing critical insights to guide further optimization of
diamond GaN pn heterojunction devices.

### Strongly enhanced lifetime of higher-order bimerons and antibimerons

- **TL;DR**: 本研究首次计算了高拓扑电荷(Q)磁双子的寿命，发现在广泛温度范围内它们比高Q斯格明子更稳定，特别是在室温下寿命可超过低Q结构3个数量级。

Magnetic bimerons, similar to skyrmions, are topologically nontrivial spin
textures characterized by topological charge $Q$. Most studies so far have
focused on low-$Q$ solitons ($|Q| \leq 1$), such as skyrmions, bimerons, and
vortices. Here, we present the first calculations of the lifetimes of high-$Q$
bimerons and demonstrate that they are fundamentally more stable than high-$Q$
skyrmions over a wide range of temperature. To obtain realistic results, our
chosen system is an experimentally feasible van der Waals interface,
Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$/Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$. We show that the lifetimes of high-$Q$
(anti)bimerons can exceed the lifetime of those with $|Q|=1$ by 3 orders of
magnitude. Remarkably, this trend remains valid even when extrapolated to room
temperature (RT), as the lifetimes are dominated by entropy rather than energy
barriers. This contrasts with high-$Q$ skyrmions, whose lifetimes fall with
$|Q|$ near RT. We attribute this fundamental difference between skyrmions and
bimerons to their distinct magnetic texture symmetries, which lead to different
entropy-dominated lifetimes.

### A Vector-Based Algorithm for Generating Complete Balanced Reaction Sets with Arbitrary Numbers of Reagents

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种基于向量的化学方程式配平方法，该方法通过确定性构建候选解、去重，并始终输出最低整数形式的系数。

We present a vector-based method to balance chemical reactions. The algorithm
builds candidates in a deterministic way, removes duplicates, and always prints
coefficients in the lowest whole-number form. For redox cases, electrons and
protons/hydroxide are treated explicitly, so both mass and charge are balanced.
We also outline the basic principles of the vector formulation of
stoichiometry, interpreting reactions as integer vectors in composition space,
this geometric view supports compact visualizations of reagent-product
interactions and helps surface distinct reaction families. The method
enumerates valid balances for arbitrary user-specified species lists without
special-case balancing rules or symbolic tricks, and it provides a clean
foundation for developing new algorithmic variants (e.g., alternative
objectives or constraints). On representative examples (neutralization, double
displacement, decomposition, classical redox, small multicomponent sets) and a
negative control, the method produced correct integer balances. When multiple
balances exist, we report a canonical one - minimizing the total coefficient
sum with a simple tie-breaker - without claiming global optimality beyond the
solutions the search enumerates. The procedure applies per reaction and extends
to reaction networks via consistent per-reaction application. We do not report
runtimes, broader benchmarking and code/data release are planned.

### The impact of fluctuations on particle systems described by Dean-Kawasaki-type equations

We study the role of fluctuations in particle systems modeled by
Dean-Kawasaki-type equations, which describe the evolution of particle
densities in systems with Brownian motion. By comparing microscopic
simulations, stochastic partial differential equations, and their deterministic
counterparts, we analyze four models of increasing complexity. Our results
identify macroscopic quantities that can be altered by the conserved
multiplicative noise that typically appears in the Dean-Kawasaki-type
description. We find that this noise enhances front propagation in systems with
density-dependent diffusivity, accelerates the onset of pattern formation in
particle systems with nonlocal interactions, and reduces hysteresis in systems
interacting via repulsive forces. In some cases, it accelerates transitions or
induces structures absent in deterministic models. These findings illustrate
that (conservative) fluctuations can have constructive and nontrivial effects,
emphasizing the importance of stochastic modeling in understanding collective
particle dynamics.

### Percolating Corrosion Pathways of Chemically Ordered NiCr Alloys in Molten Salts

- **TL;DR**: 化学有序排列的Ni2Cr合金在熔盐环境中腐蚀速率显著加快，主要原因是渗流Cr通道增强了近表面扩散并降低了Cr溶解的能垒。

Recent experiments have shown that chemical ordering in NiCr alloys can
significantly accelerate corrosion in molten salt environments. However, the
underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Using reactive molecular
dynamics and first-principles calculations, we show that long-range ordered
Ni$_2$Cr in Ni-33at.%Cr alloys corrodes far more rapidly in FLiNaK salt at
800{\deg}C than short-range ordered or random solid solutions. This accelerated
attack originates from percolating Cr pathways that enhance near-surface
diffusion and a lowered energetic barrier for Cr dissolution, as confirmed by
first-principles calculations. Contrary to earlier explanations that attributed
this behavior to residual stresses, our stress-free simulations demonstrate
that ordering alone accelerates the degradation. These results establish
percolation as a critical link between chemical ordering and corrosion
kinetics, offering a mechanistic basis for experimental observations.

### Coupling between vibration and Luttinger liquid in mechanical nanowires

The vibration of the mechanical nanowire coupled to photons via photon
pressure and coupled to charges via the capacity has been widely explored in
experiments in the past decades. This system is electrically neutral, thus its
coupling to the other degrees of freedom is always challenging. Here, we show
that the vibration can slightly change the nanowire length and the associated
Fermi velocity, which leads to coupling between vibration and Luttinger liquid.
We consider the transverse and longitudinal vibrations of the nanowires,
showing that the transverse vibration is much more significant than the
longitudinal vibration, which can be measured through the sizable frequency
shift. We predict an instability of the vibration induced by this coupling when
the frequency becomes negative at a critical temperature for the transverse
vibrations in nanowires with low Fermi energy, which can be reached by tuning
the chemical potential and magnetic field. The time-dependent oscillation of
the conductance, which directly measures the Luttinger parameter, can provide
evidence for this coupling. Our theory offers a new mechanism for exploring the
coupling between the vibration and the electronic excitations, which may lead
to intriguing applications in cooling and controlling the mechanical
oscillators with currents.

- **TL;DR**: 石墨烯层与基底振动激发模式耦合可在高偏压下产生强中红外辐射，这源于高电流驱动的非平衡现象，有望显著降低家庭和工业的能耗。

Mid-infrared (mid-IR) emission resonating with molecular vibration is one of
the important pathways to deliver heat energy required for various chemical
reactions. However, its practical applications have been limited due to the
lack of high-power large-area mid-IR sources so far. Here we report that
graphene layers coupled with the vibrational excitation modes of substrates can
generate intense mid-IR radiation at high bias. This is potentially related to
the high-current driven nonequilibrium phenomena, where sonic-boom-like shock
waves at the graphene/substrate interface can induce the overflow of excited
molecular vibrations in substrates followed by spontaneous or stimulated
transitions to ground states. The resulting mid-IR radiation is highly
efficient in thermal energy generation and transfer, which is expected to
significantly reduce power consumption in homes and industries.

We study the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of entanglement fluctuations in the
$\nu=1$ Quantum Symmetric Simple Exclusion Process, a free-fermion chain with
hopping amplitudes that are stochastic in time but homogeneous in space.
Previous work showed that the average entanglement growth after a quantum
quench can be explained in terms of pairs of entangled quasiparticles
performing random walks, leading to diffusive entanglement spreading. By
incorporating the noise-induced statistical correlations between the
quasiparticles, we extend this description to the full-time probability
distribution of the entanglement entropy. Our generalized quasiparticle picture
allows us to compute the average time evolution of a generic function of the
reduced density matrix of a subsystem. We also apply our result to the
entanglement asymmetry. This allows us to investigate the restoration of
particle-number symmetry in the dynamics from initial states with no
well-defined particle number, and the emergence of the quantum Mpemba effect.

### Spin-dependent anisotropic electron-phonon coupling in KTaO$_3$

KTaO$_3$ (KTO) is an incipient ferroelectric, characterized by a softening of
the lowest transverse optical (TO) mode with decreasing temperature. Cooper
pairing in the recently discovered KTO-based heterostructures has been proposed
to be mediated by the soft TO mode. Here we study the electron coupling to the
zone-center odd-parity modes of bulk KTO by means of relativistic Density
Functional Perturbation Theory (DFPT). The coupling to the soft TO mode is by
far the largest, with comparable contributions from both intraband and
interband processes. Remarkably, we find that for this mode,
spin-non-conserving matrix elements are particularly relevant. We develop a
three-band microscopic model with spin-orbit coupled $t_{2g}$ orbitals that
reproduces the main features of the ab initio results. For the highest energy
band, the coupling can be understood as a "dynamical" isotropic Rashba effect.
In contrast, for the two lowest bands, the Rashba-like coupling becomes
strongly anisotropic. The DFPT protocol implemented here enables the
calculation of the full electron-phonon coupling matrix projected onto any mode
of interest, and it is easily applicable to other systems.

We report the discovery of a geometric pathway for tuning ferroelectric
properties through thermally driven reconfiguration between coexisting polar
states in Li-substituted NaNbO3. Using first-principles density functional
theory calculation and 7Li solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy
measurement, we reveal that Li substitution creates two distinct polar
configurations whose transformation under annealing enhances the Curie
temperature and induces piezoelectric hardening. Our findings establish a
geometrically-driven polar state reconfiguration mechanism, providing a general
design principle for ferroics whereby macroscopic functional properties can be
engineered via lattice geometry.

### Spin Seebeck Effect in Correlated Antiferromagnetic V2O3

The spin Seebeck effect is useful for probing the spin correlations and
magnetic order in magnetic insulators. Here, we report a strong longitudinal
spin Seebeck effect (LSSE) in antiferromagnetic V2O3 thin films. The LSSE
response at cryogenic temperatures increases as a function of the external
magnetic field until it approaches saturation. The response at given power and
field exhibits a non-monotonic temperature dependence, with a pronounced peak
that shifts toward higher temperatures as the field increases. Furthermore, the
magnitude of the LSSE signal decreases consistently with increasing thickness,
implying that the bulk SSE dominates any interfacial contribution. This
negative correlation between the SSE and the thickness implies that the magnon
energy relaxation length in V2O3 is shorter than the thickness of our thinnest
film, 50 nm, consistent with the strong spin-lattice coupling in this material.

### Maximum Quantum Work at Criticality: Stirling Engines and Fibonacci-Lucas Degeneracies

Many-body effects and quantum criticality play a central role in determining
the performance of quantum thermal machines. Although operating near a quantum
critical point (QCP) is known to enhance engine performance, the precise
thermodynamic conditions required to attain the Carnot efficiency limit remain
unsettled. Here, we derive the exact conditions for a quantum Stirling engine
to achieve Carnot efficiency when a QCP drives its working medium. In the
low-temperature regime, where only the ground-state manifold is populated, the
net work output is given by $ W = k_B \delta \ln (g_{\text{crit}}/g_0) $ with $
\delta = T_H - T_L $, which directly yields the Carnot efficiency $ \eta_C = 1
- T_L/T_H $, independent of microscopic details. Notably, whereas ideal
Stirling cycles attain Carnot efficiency only with a perfect regenerator, here
no regenerator is required because, at low temperatures, the thermal population
remains confined to the degenerate ground state; this represents a clear
quantum advantage over engines with classical working substances. We validate
this universal result by recovering known behaviors in various quantum systems,
including spin chains with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions and magnetic
anisotropies. Applying the framework to the one-dimensional antiferromagnetic
Ising model, we predict non-extensive scaling of the work output governed by
Fibonacci and Lucas numbers for open chains and closed rings, respectively,
which converges to classical extensivity in the thermodynamic limit. This
analysis establishes a general and robust foundation for designing quantum
thermal machines that reach the Carnot bound while delivering finite work.

Single wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) exhibit remarkable optical and
electrical properties making them one of the most promising materials for next
generation electronic and optoelectronic devices. Their electronic properties
strongly depend on their chirality, i.e., their structural configuration, as
well as on the presence and nature of atomic defects. Currently, the lack of
versatile and efficient structural characterization techniques limits SWCNT
applications. Here, we report how four-dimensional scanning transmission
electron microscopy (4D-STEM) can address critical challenges in SWCNT
structural analysis. Using modern fast pixelated electron detectors, we were
able to acquire rapidly a large number of low noise electron diffraction
patterns of SWCNTs. The resulting 4D-STEM data allow to precisely determine the
local chirality of multiple nanotubes at once, with limited electron dose (down
to 1750 e-/{\AA}^2) and nanometric spatial resolution (down to 3.1 nm). We also
show how this approach enables to track the chirality along a single nanotube,
while giving access to the strain distribution. Then, we report how 4D-STEM
data enable to reconstruct high-resolution images with electron ptychography.
With this second approach, structural information can be obtained with atomic
scale spatial resolution allowing atomic defect imaging. Finally, we
investigate how multi-slice electron ptychography could provide even further
insight on nanotube defect structures thanks to its close to 3D imaging
capabilities at atomic resolution.

Mesoscopic systems possess shot noise in their currents due to the
quantization of the conducting quasiparticles. Measurements of this shot noise
are useful to study phenomena that do not manifest themselves in standard
conductance or resistance measurements, such as the statistics of the
conducting quasiparticles or quantum entanglement via Bell tests. The
corresponding particle statistics can be determined via two particle quantum
interference experiments, such as the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect which demonstrates
a bunching effect for bosons or an anti-bunching effect in fermions. In
superconducting proximity junctions, electrons incident on a superconductor can
induce holes via crossed Andreev reflection (CAR) in spatially separated normal
metal leads, where the resulting hole currents have nontrivial partition noise
due to the four terminal configuration. These nonlocally generated currents,
using a superconductor as a mesoscopic beam splitter, enable fabrication of
mesoscopic analogs to quantum optics interferometers using metallic and
superconducting films with multiport geometries.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了各向异性价电子密度重叠(AVDO)模型来精确模拟泡利交换排斥作用，该模型仅使用一个通用参数就能在有机分子二聚体上实现亚kcal/mol级别的精度。

Pauli exchange-repulsion is the dominant short-range intermolecular
interaction and it is an essential component of molecular force fields. Current
approaches to modeling Pauli repulsion in molecular force fields often rely on
over 20 atom types to achieve chemical accuracy. The number of parameters in
these approaches hampers the development of force fields with quantum-chemical
accuracy that are transferable across many chemical systems. We present the
anisotropic valence density overlap (AVDO) model for exchange-repulsion. The
model produces sub-kcal/mol accuracy for dimers of organic molecules from the
S101x7 dataset, a representative set of the most common biologically relevant
intermolecular interactions, and for acene dimers of increasing size. It uses a
single universal parameter, related to an atomic cross-sectional area, that is
transferable across chemical systems. Given recent progress in machine learning
the electronic density, this model offers a promising path toward
high-accuracy, next-generation machine-learned force fields.

We present a simulation technique to evaluate the most important quantity for
nucleation processes: the nucleation barrier, i.e. the free energy of formation
of the critical cluster. The method is based on stabilizing a small cluster by
simulating it in the NVT ensemble and using the thermodynamics of small systems
to convert the properties of this stable cluster into the Gibbs free energy of
formation of the critical cluster. We demonstrate this approach using
condensation in a Lennard-Jones truncated and shifted fluid as an example,
showing an excellent agreement with previous Umbrella Sampling simulations. The
method is straightforward to implement, computationally inexpensive, requires
only a small number of particles comparable to the critical cluster size, does
not rely on the use of Classical Nucleation Theory, and does not require any
cluster definition or reaction coordinate. All of these advantages hold the
promise of opening the door to simulate nucleation processes in complex
molecules of atmospheric, chemical or pharmaceutical interest that cannot be
easily simulated with current techniques.

- **TL;DR**: 通过钒取代增强Cu2P2-xVxO7的离子电导率，在993K时电导率从3.81×10^-5 S cm^-1（x=0）提升至2.08×10^-3 S cm^-1（x=1），提高两个数量级，有望应用于固体氧化物燃料电池。

In the quest of green energy, Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFC) have drawn
considerable attention for chemical-to-electric energy conversion. In the
present paper, we report an enhancement of ionic conductivity in Cu2P2-xVxO7 by
vanadium substitution. The electrical (dc and ac conductivity, diffusivity,
hopping rate, electric modulus and dielectric properties) and crystal
structural properties of Cu2P2-xVxO7 (x = 0, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1) are
investigated by impedance spectroscopy and neutron diffraction, respectively.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) study confirms the presence of Cu2+,
P5+and V5+ mono-valence states. The dc conductivity results reveal a two orders
of magnitude enhancement of ionic conductivity from ~3.81x10-5 S cm-1 for x =0
to ~2.08x10-3 S cm-1 for x =1 at 993 K, revealing a possible application in
SOFCs. DC transport number studies reveal that the total conductivity is
dominated by ionic conduction (&gt; 95%). In addition, the diffusivity and hopping
rate of oxide ions increase with increasing x. Besides, ac conductivity,
electric modulus and dielectric properties have been investigated to illustrate
the microscopic conduction mechanism. The derived results suggest that the
mechanism for ionic conduction is the correlated barrier hopping (CBH) process.
The soft-bond valence sum (BVS) analysis of the neutron diffraction patterns
reveals the three-dimensional (3D) oxide ion conduction pathways within the
crystal structure. The present study provides a pathway to enhance the ionic
conductivity, as well as understanding of microscopic conduction mechanism,
ionic conduction pathways and the role of crystal structure on the ionic
conduction.

- **TL;DR**: 在偏置低对称性二维金属系统中发现了一种共振TE模式，可在没有受激发射的情况下实现光学增益，这需要同时存在贝里曲率偶极子和非零磁电张量。

Optical gain is a critical process in today's semiconductor technology and it
is most often achieved via stimulated emission. In this theoretical study, we
find a resonant TE mode in biased low-symmetry two-dimensional metallic systems
which may lead to optical gain in the absence of stimulated emission. We do so
by first modeling the optical conductivity using Boltzmann non-equilibrium
transport theory and then simulating the scattering problem using a
scattered-wave formalism. Assuming that the system may possess a Berry
curvature dipole (BCD) and a non-zero Magnetoelectric tensor (MET), we find
that the optical conductivity has a non-trivial dependence on the direction of
the applied bias, which allows for probing the TE mode. After analyzing the
system with one of each of the effects, we find that the resonant TE mode is
only accessible when both effects are present. Further studies are necessary to
find materials with a suitably large BCD and MET, in order to realize the
predictions within this study.

We study a recently discovered property of many-body quantum chaotic systems
called ETH-monotonicity in two-dimensional systems. Our new results further
support ETH-monotonicity in these higher dimensional systems. We show that the
flattening rate of the $f$-function is directly proportional to the number of
degrees of freedom in the system, so as $L^2$ where $L$ is the linear size of
the system, and in general, expected to be $L^d$ where $d$ is the spatial
dimension of the system. We also show that the flattening rate is directly
proportional to the particle (or hole) number for systems of same spatial size.

The search for non-toxic lead-free halide perovskites that can compete with
the lead-based counterparts has led to the emergence of double perovskites as
potential candidates. Among many options, Cs2AgBiBr6 stands out as one of the
most suitable eco-friendly materials for numerous optoelectronic applications.
In this study, quasi-2D Cs2AgBiBr6 nanosheets (NSs) were prepared via the
low-temperature injection colloidal synthesis and used to fabricate
high-performance photodetectors in a transport-layer-free architecture. The
reaction temperature and ligands played vital roles in the structural purity,
shape, and size of the synthesized Cs2AgBiBr6 NSs. The fabricated NSs disclosed
lateral sizes of up to 1.4 um and are only a few nanometers thick. The
high-performance photodetectors fabricated using the Cs2AgBiBr6 NSs yielded a
high detectivity (D) of 1.15*10^12 Jones, responsivity (R) of 121 mA/W, a
notable on/off ratio of 2.39*10^4, and a fast rise and decay time of 857 and
829 us, respectively. The device demonstrates remarkable stability. Basically,
it sustains its entire photocurrent after storage in ambient conditions for 80
days. This work showcases a pathway for the colloidal synthesis of quasi-2D
Cs2AgBiBr6 lead-free double perovskite NSs with suitable properties for
high-performance photodetection and other optoelectronic applications.

### Fast high-fidelity baseband reset of a latched state for quantum dot qubit readout

- **TL;DR**: 该论文展示了一种按需、高保真度（&gt;99%）的量子点量子比特从闩锁读出状态重新初始化的方法，使用单基带电压脉冲在特定区域实现快速重置。

A common method for reading out the state of a spin qubit is by latching one
logical qubit state, either $|1\rangle$ or $|0\rangle$, onto a different,
metastable charge state. Such a latched state can provide a superior charge
sensing signal for qubit readout, and it can have a lifetime chosen to be long
enough that the charge sensed readout can be high fidelity. However, the
passive reset out of latched states is inherently long, which is not desirable.
In this work, we demonstrate an on-demand, high fidelity (&gt; 99%)
re-initialization of a quantum dot qubit out of a latched readout state. The
method is simple to apply as it involves a single baseband voltage pulse to a
specific region in the quantum dot stability diagram where the relaxation time
from the latched state to the ground state is over 50 times faster. We describe
the mechanism for the reset process as well as the boundaries for the optimal
reset region in the qubit gate voltage space.

We present a revised atomistic picture of the order-disorder transition in
the archetypal orbital-ordered perovskite material, LaMnO$_{3}$. Our study uses
machine-learning-driven molecular-dynamics simulations which describe the
temperature evolution of pair distribution functions in close agreement with
experiment. We find the orbital-disordered phase in LaMnO$_{3}$ to comprise a
mixture of differing structural distortions with and without inversion
symmetry, implying a mixture of different orbital arrangements. These
distortions are highly dynamic with an estimated lifetime of $\sim 40$ fs at
1,000 K, and their fluctuations converge with the timescales of conventional
thermal motion in the high-$T$ phase - indicating that the electronic
instability responsible for static Jahn-Teller distortions at low temperature
instead drives phonon anharmonicity at high temperatures. Beyond LaMnO$_{3}$,
our work opens an avenue for studying a wider range of correlated materials.

### Critical exponents of fluid-fluid interfacial tensions near a critical endpoint in a nonwetting gap

- **TL;DR**: 研究三相流体平衡在临界点附近的行为，分析界面张力的临界指数，发现非润湿间隙中存在异常临界指数3/4。

Fluid three-phase equilibria, with phases $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$, are
studied close to a tricritical point, analytically and numerically, in a
mean-field density-functional theory with two densities. Employing Griffiths'
scaling for the densities, the interfacial tensions of the wet and nonwet
interfaces are analysed. The mean-field critical exponent is obtained for the
vanishing of the critical interfacial tension $\sigma_{\beta\gamma}$ as a
function of the deviation of the noncritical interfacial tension
$\sigma_{\alpha\gamma}$ from its limiting value at a critical endpoint
$\sigma_{\alpha,\beta\gamma}$. In the wet regime, this exponent is $3/2$ as
expected. In the nonwetting gap of the model, the exponent is again $3/2$,
except for the approach to the critical endpoint on the neutral line where
$\sigma_{\alpha\beta} = \sigma_{\alpha\gamma}$. When this point is approached
along any path with $\sigma_{\alpha\beta} \neq \sigma_{\alpha\gamma}$, or along
the neutral line, $\sigma_{\beta\gamma} \propto | \sigma_{\alpha\gamma} -
\sigma_{\alpha,\beta\gamma}|^{3/4}$, featuring an anomalous critical exponent
$3/4$, which is an exact result derived by analytic calculation and explained
by geometrical arguments.

To elucidate low-frequency vibrational modes that modulate intramolecular
charge transfer (ICT), we investigate a benzoxazolium-coumarin (BCO+)
donor-pi-acceptor derivative using transmission terahertz time-domain
spectroscopy (THz-TDS). The retrieved complex refractive index reveals distinct
modes at 0.62, 0.85, 1.30, 1.81, and 2.07 THz. Gas-phase density functional
theory (DFT) agrees with these features and enables assignment of specific
intramolecular motions. Together, THz-TDS and DFT identify characteristic
low-frequency modes of BCO+ and suggest their connection to ICT-relevant
nuclear motions, demonstrating that THz-TDS provides a sensitive probe of
vibrational signatures in donor-pi-acceptor systems.

### When Heating Isn't Cooling in Reverse: Nosé-Hoover Thermostat Fluctuations from Equilibrium Symmetry to Nonequilibrium Asymmetry

- **TL;DR**: 该论文重新审视了分子动力学模拟中的加热-冷却不对称性现象，发现早期MD结果已暗示实验观察到的加热效率高于冷却的不对称性，并通过精确再现Evans和Holian的模拟设置验证了这种不对称性是真实非平衡效应。

Recent laboratory experiments suggest an intrinsic asymmetry between heating
and cooling, with heating occurring more efficiently. Two decades earlier,
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations had examined a related setup - heating one
side of a computational cell while cooling the other via distinct thermostats.
We revisit those calculations, recapitulating the underlying theory and showing
that earlier MD results already hinted at the observed laboratory asymmetry.
Recent realizations of a simple two-dimensional single-particle model,
thermostatted in $x$ and $y$ at different temperatures, reproduces key
features: at equilibrium, thermostat variables were identical, but under
nonequilibrium conditions, the heating variable is weaker than the cooling one.
At the same time, MD simulations from four decades ago by Evans and Holian
reported a surprising skew in the Nose--Hoover thermostat variable $\xi$ under
equilibrium - indicating a statistical bias in energy injection versus
extraction. We revisit those results with exact reproduction of their setup. We
show that when (1) the center-of-mass velocity is set to zero, (2) integration
is done carefully with finite differencing, and (3) sampling is sufficiently
long, the distribution of $\xi$ is symmetric and Gaussian with zero mean, as
predicted by theory and validated by two independent error estimates. However,
in the two-temperature cell, the distribution of thermostat variables become
asymmetric, the cold bath requires significantly stronger damping than the hot
bath requires anti-damping, with $\langle \xi_x \rangle / \langle \xi_y \rangle
= -T_y/T_x$. This exact analytic relation links thermostat effort to thermal
bias and the negative rate of change in the entropy of the system. These
results identify the microscopic origin of heating-cooling asymmetry as a
genuine nonequilibrium effect, consistent with experimental findings.

### Finite-Temperature Ferroelectric Phase Transitions from Machine-Learned Force Fields

Simulating finite temperature phase transitions from first-principles is
computationally challenging. Recently, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
using machine-learned force fields (MLFFs) have opened a new avenue for
finite-temperature calculations with near-first-principles accuracy. Here we
use MLFFs, generated using on-the-fly training, to investigate structural phase
transitions in four of the most well-studied ferroelectric oxides; BaTiO$_3$,
PbTiO$_3$, LiNbO$_3$ and BiFeO$_3$. Only using the 0 K ground state structure
as input for the training, the resulting MLFFs can qualitatively predict all
the main structural phases and phase transitions, while the quantitative
results are sensitive to the choice of exchange correlation functional with
PBEsol found to be more robust than LDA and r$^2$SCAN. MD simulations also
reproduce the experimentally observed order-disorder character of Ti
displacements in BaTiO$_3$, the abrupt first order transitions of BiFeO$_3$ and
PbTiO$_3$, and the mixed order-disorder and displacive character of the
ferroelectric transition in LiNbO$_3$. Finally, we discuss the potential and
limitations of using MLFFs for simulating ferroelectric phase transitions.

### Combined ab initio and experimental study of phosphorus-based anti-wear additives interacting with iron and iron oxide

The performance of phosphorus-based lubricant additives is governed by their
adsorption, stability, and reactivity at the metal interface. In this study, we
investigate the adsorption behavior and tribochemical stability of three
additives: Octyl Acid Phosphate (OAP), Dibutyl Hydrogen Phosphite (DBHP), and
Amine Neutralized Acid Phosphate (ANAP). These additives are studied on iron
and hematite surfaces using both ab initio calculations and experimental
analyses on steel. Simulations revealed that ANAP exhibited the strongest
adsorption on iron, followed by DBHP, while OAP showed weaker interactions,
though its chemisorption was enhanced on hematite via hydrogen loss. Under
tribological conditions, the DBHP phosphite dissociated more readily than the
other two phosphates molecules due to its lower phosphorus coordination, as
confirmed by bond order analysis. Quartz crystal microbalance (QCM)
measurements indicated significant differences in adsorption behavior across
temperatures, with DBHP forming stable deposits, while ANAP exhibited poor
retention, in agreement with ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirmed DBHP's strong chemisorption and
molecular dissociation, leading to increased phosphorus deposition. OAP,
despite forming a phosphorus-based layer, caused a reduction in Fe oxide,
consistent with its hydrogen release mechanism observed in simulations. These
findings highlight the critical role of molecular structure and oxidation state
in tribofilm formation and stability. Understanding these interactions at the
atomic level provides valuable insights for designing high-performance
lubricant additives for extreme operating conditions.

Hydrogen hydrates (HH) are a unique class of materials composed of hydrogen
molecules confined within crystalline water frameworks. Among their multiple
phases, the filled ice structures, particularly the cubic C2 phase, exhibit
exceptionally strong host-guest interactions due to ultra-short H2-H2O
distances and a 1:1 stoichiometry leading to two interpenetrated identical
diamond-like sublattices, one comprised of water molecules, the other of
hydrogen molecules. At high pressures, nuclear quantum effects involving both
hydrogen molecules and the water lattice become dominant, giving rise to a
dual-lattice quantum system. In this work, we explore the sequence of pressure-
and temperature-driven phase transitions in HH, focusing on the interplay
between molecular rotation, orientational ordering, lattice symmetry breaking
and hydrogen bond symmetrization. Using a combination of computational modeling
based on classical and path-integral molecular dynamics,
  quantum embedding, and high pressure experiments, including Raman
spectroscopy and synchrotron X-ray diffraction at low temperatures and high
pressures, we identify signatures of quantum-induced ordering and structural
transformations in the C2 phase. Our findings reveal that orientational
ordering in HH occurs at much lower pressures than in solid hydrogen, by
inducing structural changes in the water network and enhancing the coupling of
water and hydrogen dynamics. This work provides new insights into the quantum
behavior of hydrogen under extreme mechanochemical confinement and establishes
hydrogen-filled ices as a promising platform for the design of hydrogen-rich
quantum materials.

Measurements of the spectral emission properties of an iron-doped
Beta-Ga2O3(010) photocathode at 300K reveal the presence of ultracold electron
emission with a 6meV mean transverse energy (MTE) in the 3.5-4.4eV photon
energy range (282-354nm). This extreme sub-thermal photoemission signal is
consistent with direct emission of electrons photoexcited from the Fe dopant
states into the low effective mass and positive electron affinity primary
conduction band, and it is superimposed on a stronger signal with a larger MTE
associated with an (optical)phonon-mediated momentum resonant Franck-Condon
(FC) emission process from a thermally populated and negative electron affinity
upper conduction band. For photon energies above 4.5eV, a transition from a
long to a short transport regime is forced by an absorption depth reduction to
below 100nm and both MTE signals exhibit spectral trends consistent with
phonon-mediated FC emission if the polaron formation self-energy is included in
the initial photoexcited electron thermalization.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究系统研究了振动对ZBLAN玻璃结晶行为的影响，发现振动降低了结晶起始温度，增强了原子迁移率和成核动力学，并观察到晶体形态从针状向蝴蝶结状和羽毛状的转变。

ZBLAN glass is a promising material for infrared optical fibers due to its
wide transmission window and low theoretical attenuation. However, its strong
tendency to crystallize during processing limits optical performance. While
microgravity environments have been shown to suppress crystallization, the role
of mechanical vibration under normal gravity conditions remains poorly
understood. This study systematically investigates the influence of vibration
on the crystallization behavior of ZBLAN using a controlled heating and
vibration apparatus. Samples were subjected to varied thermal and vibrational
conditions, and their crystallization onset and morphological evolution were
examined through optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy
dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Results
show that vibration reduces the crystallization onset temperature, indicating
enhanced atomic mobility and nucleation kinetics. Progressive morphological
transitions from needle-like to bow-tie and feather-like crystals were observed
with increasing temperature and vibration intensity. Surface roughness analysis
corroborates these findings, revealing a significant increase in nanoscale
roughness in crystallized regions. Although brief exposure duration and partial
thermal decoupling introduced variability among samples, the overall results
confirm that vibration acts as a direct facilitator of nucleation rather than a
purely thermal effect. This work provides new insight into vibration-induced
crystallization in fluoride glasses and establishes the experimental foundation
for follow-up modeling and apparatus optimization studies under terrestrial and
microgravity conditions.
