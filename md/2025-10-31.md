- **TL;DR**: 本研究通过大规模量子蒙特卡洛模拟和理论分析，探索了(3+1)D O(3)模型中无序算子的标度行为，揭示了电流中心荷等普适贡献，建立了晶格模拟与连续场论之间的具体联系。

The disorder operator, as an easily measured non-local observable, displays
great potential in detecting intrinsic information of field theories. It has
been systematically studied in 1d and 2d quantum systems, while the knowledge
of 3d is still limited. The disorder operator associated with U(1) global
symmetry exhibits rich geometric dependence on the shape of the spatial region
at a quantum critical point, meanwhile, (3+1)D is the upper critical dimension
for O(N) criticalities, both of which pose a challenge for exploring the
disorder operator in high dimensions. In this work, we investigate the scaling
behaviors of disorder operators in (3+1)D O(3) models through large-scale
quantum Monte Carlo simulation combined with theoretical analysis. The
universal contributions, such as the current central charge, have been revealed
in our calculation, which establishes a concrete link between lattice
simulations and continuum field theory. This work opens new avenues for
experimental and numerical exploration of universal properties at quantum
critical points in (3+1)D models.

### $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Universality of the Mott Transition

- **Categories**: cond-mat.str-el
- **TL;DR**: 该论文证明了Mott相变在动量空间中存在Z2对称性破缺，导致普遍标度行为。电荷压缩率作为序参量，其极值温度遵循普遍标度关系，与晶格几何无关。

We demonstrate that the Mott transition exhibits universal scaling as a
consequence of the breaking of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry in momentum space. A
direct consequence of this discrete symmetry breaking is the charge or Mott gap
itself. From extensive numerics, we proffer that it is the charge
compressibility that acts as the underlying order parameter as it is zero in
the insulator and non-zero in the metallic state. Additionally, the Widom line
(temperature of the extremum of the compressibility) obeys a universal scaling
of $T_m=0.39U$ deep into the insulating state directly from $Z_2$ universality.
Furthermore, the temperature at which the second derivative of the
compressibility has a minimum is independent of lattice geometry, exhibiting a
universal scaling of $|U-U_c|^\alpha$ where $\alpha\approx 1$. Finally, our
computational approach reproduces the key features of the doping dependence of
the compressibility demonstrated in recent cold-atom quantum simulators of the
Hubbard model, thereby corroborating our conclusions on $\mathbb{Z}_2$
universality.

### Geometric and Orbital Control of Correlated States in Small Hubbard Clusters

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一个预测性框架，通过晶格几何、轨道杂化和外部电场三个控制杠杆来设计量子点阵列中的局域电子配对。揭示了三个基本设计原则：几何层次、轨道杂化和场压缩效应。

Arrays of semiconductor quantum dots provide a powerful platform to design
correlated quantum matter from the bottom up. We establish a predictive
framework for engineering local electron pairing in these artificial molecules
by systematically deploying three control levers: lattice geometry, orbital
hybridization, and external electric fields. Using Hartree-Fock simulations on
canonical 3D clusters from the tetrahedron (Z = 3) to the FCC lattice (Z = 12),
at and near half-filling, we uncover three fundamental design principles. (i)
Geometric Hierarchy: The resilience to Coulomb repulsion U is dictated by the
coordination number Z, which controls kinetic delocalization. (ii) Orbital
Hybridization: Counter-intuitively, inter-orbital hopping t_orb acts not as a
simple suppressor of pairing, but as a sophisticated control knob that enhances
double occupancy at moderate U by engineering the on-site energy landscape.
(iii) Field Squeezing: An electric field robustly induces pairing by forcing
charge localization, an effect most potent in low-connectivity clusters. These
principles form a blueprint for deterministically targeting charge and spin
correlations in quantum-dot-based quantum hardware.

### Hyperbolic Fracton Model, Subsystem Symmetry and Holography III: Extension to Generic Tessellations

- **TL;DR**: 该论文将双曲分形子模型从{5,4}镶嵌推广到一般镶嵌，研究了子系统对称性、分形子迁移率和全息对应关系等核心性质。

We generalize the Hyperbolic Fracton Model from the $\{5,4\}$ tessellation to
generic tessellations, and investigate its core properties: subsystem
symmetries, fracton mobility, and holographic correspondence. While the model
on the original tessellation has features reminiscent of the flat-space lattice
cases, the generalized tessellations exhibit a far richer and more intricate
structure. The ground-state degeneracy and subsystem symmetries are generated
recursively layer-by-layer, through the inflation rule, but without a simple,
uniform pattern. The fracton excitations follow exponential-in-distance and
algebraic-in-lattice-size growing patterns when moving outward, and depend
sensitively to the tessellation geometry, differing qualitatively from both
type-I or type-II fracton model on flat lattices. Despite this increased
complexity, the hallmark holographic features -- subregion duality via Rindler
reconstruction, the Ryu-Takayanagi formula for mutual information, and
effective black hole entropy scaling with horizon area -- remain valid. These
results demonstrate that the holographic correspondence in fracton models
persists in generic tessellations, and provide a natural platform to explore
more intricate subsystem symmetries and fracton physics.

### Beyond the Arcsine Law: Exact Two-Time Statistics of the Occupation Time in Jump Processes

- **TL;DR**: 本文研究了一维跳跃过程的双时间占据统计，推导了占据时间与位置的联合分布、老化占据时间定律和自相关函数的精确结果，揭示了连续时间极限下的普适特征。

Occupation times quantify how long a stochastic process remains in a region,
and their single-time statistics are famously given by the arcsine law for
Brownian and L\'evy processes. By contrast, two-time occupation statistics,
which directly probe temporal correlations and aging, have resisted exact
characterization beyond renewal processes. In this Letter we derive exact
results for generic one-dimensional jump processes, a central framework for
intermittent and discretely sampled dynamics. Using generalized Wiener-Hopf
methods, we obtain the joint distribution of occupation time and position, the
aged occupation-time law, and the autocorrelation function. In the
continuous-time scaling limit, universal features emerge that depend only on
the tail of the jump distribution, providing a starting point for exploring
aging transport in complex environments.

### Theories of Superconducting Diode Effects

- **TL;DR**: 本文综述了超导二极管效应(SDE)的理论机制，重点讨论了时间反演和反演对称性同时破缺的必要性，以及在不同凝聚态系统中的实现方案。

Superconducting diode effects (SDE), both in bulk superconductors and in
Josephson junctions, have garnered a lot of attention due to potential
applications in classical and quantum computing, as well as superconducting
sensors. Here we review various mechanisms that have been theoretically
proposed for their realization. We first provide a brief historical overview
and discuss the basic but subtle phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau theory of
SDE, emphasizing the need to the simultaneous breaking of time-reversal and
inversion symmetries. We then proceed to more microscopic treatments, focusing
especially on implementations in noncentrosymmetric materials described by the
Rashba-Zeeman model. Finally, we review proposals based on other condensed
matter systems such as altermagnets, valley polarized and topological
materials, and systems out of equilibrium.

### Latent Spaces for Langevin Dynamics

- **TL;DR**: 本文推导了一个通用的粗粒化嵌入函数族，使得朗之万动力学可以应用于非几何粗粒化表示，如TICA主成分或神经网络分子潜在嵌入。

In the field of machine learning coarse-grained potentials in molecular
dynamics, propagators require that the Hamiltonian is quadratic in momentum,
thus limiting the family of coarse-graining functions. In this paper, we derive
a general family of coarse-graining embedding functions for which Langevin
dynamics can be applied. This has significant implications in molecular
simulations, and it paves the way for Langevin dynamics to be run on
non-geometric coarse-graining representations such as those given by principal
components of time-lagged independent component analysis (TICA) or latent
embeddings of molecules obtained from neural networks.

### Equation Discovery, Parametric Simulation, and Optimization Using the Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) Method for the Heat Conduction Problem

- **TL;DR**: 本研究探讨了物理信息神经网络（PINN）在热传导问题中的建模、仿真和优化三大任务中的应用能力。

In this study, the capabilities of the Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN)
method are investigated for three major tasks: modeling, simulation, and
optimization in the context of the heat conduction problem. In the modeling
phase, the governing equation of heat transfer by conduction is reconstructed
through equation discovery using fractional-order derivatives, enabling the
identification of the fractional derivative order that best describes the
physical behavior. In the simulation phase, the thermal conductivity is treated
as a physical parameter, and a parametric simulation is performed to analyze
its influence on the temperature field. In the optimization phase, the focus is
placed on the inverse problem, where the goal is to infer unknown physical
properties from observed data. The effectiveness of the PINN approach is
evaluated across these three fundamental engineering problem types and compared
against conventional numerical methods. The results demonstrate that although
PINNs may not yet outperform traditional numerical solvers in terms of speed
and accuracy for forward problems, they offer a powerful and flexible framework
for parametric simulation, optimization, and equation discovery, making them
highly valuable for inverse and data-driven modeling applications.

### Evaluation of Wafer-Scale SOT-MRAM for Analog Crossbar Array Applications

- **TL;DR**: 本研究展示了300毫米兼容的SOT-MRAM器件在神经网路应用中的优异性能，包括高隧道磁阻比、快速低电压操作、低能耗和低噪声，通过量化感知训练和噪声训练在MNIST上达到95%准确率，并利用双稳态各向异性和随机切换特性实现二进制神经网络的随机训练。

Analog crossbar arrays consisting of emerging memory devices can greatly
alleviate the computational strain required by vector matrix multiplications
for neural network applications. The ability to produce spin orbit
torque-magnetic random-access memory (SOT-MRAM) at wafer-scale positions
SOT-MRAM as a strong memory candidate. In this work, we fabricate and measure
300 mm-compatible SOT-MRAM with 150% tunnel magnetoresistance ratio, fast (2
ns) and low voltage (&lt;1 V) operation, low energy dissipation (350 fJ), low
write noise (0.1%), and low device-to-device variation of 10%. Through 2-bit
quantization aware training and noisy training as mitigation techniques, the
measured SOT-MRAM devices attain 95% on MNIST. The bi-stable anisotropy and
stochastic switching of SOT-MRAM can additionally be leveraged for stochastic
training of binary neural networks, able to reach ideal accuracy for a single
device. Lastly, the devices were evaluated on implementation of probabilistic
graph modeling and the interplay of tunnel magnetoresistance ratio, probability
curve distribution, and conductance noise was shown to reduce potential errors
in implementation. Through these results, SOT-MRAM is shown to be a uniquely
effective candidate for implementation of crossbar accelerators in memory- and
energy-limited applications, able to take advantage of stochastic operation and
bi-stability to beneficial results in neural network applications.

### Predicting the adhesion and delamination strength of carbon films on metals by high-throughput ab initio calculations

Diamond and diamond-like carbon (DLC) coatings are widely employed for their
exceptional mechanical, thermal and chemical properties, but their industrial
application is often limited by weak adhesion to metallic substrates. In this
work, we employ a high-throughput ab initio approach to systematically
investigate the adhesion of diamond-metal interfaces, combining a set of
technologically relevant metals (Al, Ag, Au, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ir, Mg, Mo, Pt, Rh,
Ti, V, W, Zn) with the C(111), C(111)-2x1 (Pandey reconstructed), C(110),
C(100), that are most common in diamond and are representative of different
types of bonds present in DLC. Thanks to our automated and accurate
computational protocol for interface construction and characterization,
databases are populated and relevant trends are identified on the effect of
surface graphitization, ability to form carbides and metal reactivity on carbon
film adhesion and delamination strength. Beyond capturing trends, our workflow
yields predictive insights. Indeed, we found that adhesion energy scales with
the geometric mean of the constituent surface energies, providing a simple
descriptor for rapid screening; while comparing the work of separation with the
metal's cohesive energy anticipates the fracture location under tensile
loading. A novel method based on g(r) analysis is introduced to identify when
contact with a metal drives rehybridization of surface carbon from sp2 to sp3,
the structural signature of improved resistance to delamination. These
structural changes are mirrored by an electronic rearrangement at the
interface, quantified by a charge-accumulation descriptor that strongly
correlates with adhesion.

### High Resolution Polar Kerr Effect Studies of Cs3Sb5 and ScV6Sn6 Below the Charge Order Transition

- **TL;DR**: 对CsV3Sb5和ScV6Sn6单晶进行高分辨率极化克尔效应测量，在电荷有序转变温度以下未检测到自发极化克尔效应信号。

We report high resolution polar Kerr effect measurements on CsV3Sb5 and
ScV6Sn6 single crystals in search for signatures of spontaneous polar Kerr
effect (PKE) below the charge order transitions of these materials. Utilizing
two separate zero-area loop Sagnac interferometers operating at 1550 nm and 830
nm wavelengths, we studied the temperature dependence of possible PKE after
training with magnetic field. While a finite field Kerr measurement yielded
optical rotation expected from the Pauli susceptibility of the itinerant
carriers, no signal was detected at zero-field to within the noise floor limit
of the apparatus of below $\sim$100 nanoradians. Simultaneous coherent
reflection measurements confirm the sharpness of the charge order transition in
the same optical volume as the Kerr measurements. Application of strain to
reveal a hidden flux-ordered magnetic state did not result in a finite Kerr
effect.

### Spatially Structured Entanglement from Nonequilibrium Thermal Pure States

- **TL;DR**: 研究(1+1)维临界系统中量子淬火动力学，从热纯态（交叉帽态）出发，在空间不均匀哈密顿量下演化，分析可积和非可积系统的不同热化行为。

We study quantum quench dynamics in (1+1)-dimensional critical systems,
starting from thermal pure states called crosscap states, and evolving them
under spatially inhomogeneous Hamiltonians. The spatial inhomogeneity is
introduced through a deformation of the Hamiltonian, expressed as linear
combinations of the generators of the $SL^{(q)}(2,\mathbb{R})$ subalgebra of
the Virasoro algebra. We analyze the free massless Dirac fermion theory and
holographic conformal field theory as prototypical examples of integrable and
non-integrable dynamics. Consistent with general expectations, "M\"obius-type"
deformations lead to thermalization in the non-integrable case, and to periodic
revivals in the integrable one. In contrast, "sine-square-type" and
"displacement-type" deformations prevent both thermalization and scrambling,
instead producing late-time, graph-like entanglement patterns. These patterns
emerge from the interplay between the deformed Hamiltonian and the crosscap
initial state and appear to be universal: they are determined solely by the
deformation profile while remaining largely insensitive to microscopic details.
Finally, we perform a holographic calculation in three-dimensional gravity
using AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, which reproduces the main features of our
(1+1)-dimensional study.

### Nonadiabatic and anharmonic effects in high-pressure H3S and D3S superconductors

Superconductivity in compressed H3S arises from the interplay between
high-frequency phonons and a pronounced van Hove singularity near the Fermi
level. Using first-principles calculations, we investigate the superconducting
properties of H3S and D3S at 160 and 200 GPa, explicitly incorporating
anharmonic lattice dynamics and first-order vertex corrections to
electron-phonon (e-ph) interactions, thereby going beyond the Migdal
approximation underlying conventional Migdal-Eliashberg theory. We find that
both anharmonicity and nonadiabatic vertex corrections suppress the effective
e-ph coupling and reduce the superconducting critical temperature (Tc).
Calculations performed within the energy-dependent full-bandwidth Eliashberg
formalism, including both anharmonic and vertex effects, yield Tc values in
close agreement with experimental measurements for D3S at both pressures and
for H3S at 200 GPa.

### Ultrafast Relaxation Dynamics of Inner-Shell Vacancies in Hydrated Pyrrole

- **TL;DR**: 使用TDDFT和Ehrenfest动力学研究水合吡咯中内价电离后的超快分子间弛豫，发现衰变动力学强烈依赖于初始空穴位置。

We employ real-space, real-time time-dependent density functional theory
(TDDFT) combined with Ehrenfest dynamics to investigate ultrafast
intermolecular relaxation following inner-valence ionization in hydrated
pyrrole. This time-dependent approach treats electronic and nuclear motions
simultaneously, allowing the description of electronic excitation, charge
transfer, ionization, and nuclear motion.When the initial vacancy in the O 2s 1
state is created on the water molecule, the system predominantly undergoes
intermolecular Coulombic decay (ICD) and electron-transfer mediated decay
(ETMD), accompanied by pronounced charge transfer between pyrrole and water. In
contrast, ionization of the pyrrole site for N 2s electron leads to both ICD
and Auger decay channels. These results demonstrate that the decay dynamics are
strongly governed by the initial vacancy location, offering microscopic insight
into intermolecular energy-transfer mechanisms in hydrated molecular systems.

### Generative Artificial Intelligence for Air Shower Simulation

- **TL;DR**: 使用生成对抗网络(GANs)加速宇宙线大气簇射模拟，相比传统蒙特卡罗方法将每次簇射生成时间减少10^4倍

The detailed simulation of extensive air showers, produced by primary cosmic
rays interacting in the atmosphere, is a task that is traditionally undertaken
by means of Monte Carlo methods. These processes are computationally intensive,
accounting for a major fraction of the computational resources used in the
large-scale simulations required by current and future experiments in the field
of astroparticle physics. In this work, we present a novel approach based on
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to accelerate air shower simulations. We
developed and trained a GAN on a dataset of high-energy proton-induced air
showers generated with \texttt{CORSIKA}; our model reproduces key distributions
of secondary particles, such as energy spectra and spatial distributions at
ground level of muons. Once the model has been trained, which takes
approximately 74 hours, the generation real time per shower is reduced by a
factor of $10^4$ with respect to the full \texttt{CORSIKA} simulation, leading
to a substantial decrease in both computational time and energy consumption.

### Sweet-spot protection of hole spins in sparse arrays via spin-dependent magneto-tunneling

- **TL;DR**: 该论文开发了双量子点中空穴自旋隧穿的微观理论，揭示了自旋相关的磁修正对隧道耦合的影响，这些修正有助于保持现有的甜点并引入新的甜点。

Recent advances in the scaling of spin qubits have led to the development of
sparse architectures where spin qubits are distributed across multiple quantum
dots. This distributed approach enables qubit manipulation through hopping and
flopping modes, as well as protocols for spin shuttling to entangle spins
beyond nearest neighbors. Therefore, understanding spin tunneling across
quantum dots is fundamental for the improvement of sparse array encodings.
Here, we develop a microscopic theory of a minimal sparse array formed by a
hole in a double quantum dot. We show the existence of spin-dependent magnetic
corrections to the tunnel couplings that help preserve existing sweet spots,
even for quantum dots with different $g$-factors, and introduce new ones that
are not accounted for in the simplest models. Our analytical and numerical
results explain observed sweet spots in state-of-the-art shuttling and cQED
experiments, are relevant to hopping and flopping modes, and apply broadly to
sparse array encodings of any size.

### Mutual enhancement of altermagnetism and ferroelectricity

- **TL;DR**: 该理论研究金属性交变磁性与铁电性的共存可能性，发现两者在远离半满填充时能相互增强，并提出电调控交变磁性相的方法。

We consider theoretically the possibility of coexisting ferroelectric and
metallic altermagnetic order, which has recently been predicted in insulating
and semiconducting systems via ab initio calculations. Solving
self-consistently a mean-field Hubbard model, accounting also for the energy
cost of distorting the lattice to produce an electric polarization, our results
show that metallic altermagnetism and ferroelectricity suppress or enhance each
other depending on the doping level of the system. Close to half-filling, the
system can lower its energy by becoming altermagnetic, but at the expense of
losing the electric polarization. Away from half-filling, the coexistence of
ferroelectricity and altermagnetism is much more robust toward an increase in
the energy cost associated with the deformation of the lattice. Therefore, our
results suggest that filling fractions corresponding to doping relatively far
away from half-filling constitute the most promising regime to look for
coexistent ferroelectricity and metallic altermagnetism with mutual
enhancement. Moreover, we propose a way to electrically tune altermagnetism
between nodal and nodeless phases as well as achieving coexistence of a nodal
and nodeless phase for the two spin species.

- **TL;DR**: SrRuO3薄膜在(111)晶面减薄至几个晶胞厚度时，从金属铁磁体转变为半导体反铁磁体，展现出十二重各向异性磁阻效应。

SrRuO3 is a canonical itinerant ferromagnet, yet its properties in the
extreme two-dimensional limit on a (111) crystal plane remain largely
unexplored. Here, we demonstrate a complete transformation of its ground state
driven by dimensional reduction. As the thickness of (111)-oriented SrRuO3
films is reduced to a few unit cells, the system transitions from a metallic
ferromagnet to a semiconducting antiferromagnet. This emergent
antiferromagnetism is evidenced by a vanishing magnetic remanence and most
strikingly, by the appearance of an unconventional twelve-fold anisotropic
magnetoresistance. First-principles calculations confirm that an A-type
antiferromagnetic order is the stable ground state in the ultrathin limit. Our
findings establish (111) dimensional engineering as a powerful route to
manipulate correlated electron states and uncover novel functionalities for

Discrete dynamics arise naturally in systems with broken temporal translation
symmetry and are typically described by first-order recurrence relations
representing classical or quantum Markov chains. When memory effects induced by
hidden degrees of freedom are relevant, however, higher-order discrete
evolution equations are generally required. Focusing on linear dynamics, we
identify a well-delineated weak-memory regime where such equations can, on an
intermediate time scale, be systematically reduced to a unique first-order
counterpart acting on the same state space. We formulate our results as a
mathematical theorem and work out two examples showing how they can be applied
to stochastic Floquet dynamics under coarse-grained and quantum collisional
models.

The last two decades have witnessed a tremendous number of computational
predictions of hydride-based (phonon-mediated) superconductors, mostly at
extremely high pressures, i.e., hundreds of GPa. These discoveries were heavily
driven by Migdal-\'{E}liashberg theory (and its first-principles computational
implementations) for electron-phonon interactions, the key concept of
phonon-mediated superconductivity. Dozens of predictions were experimentally
synthesized and characterized, triggering not only enormous excitement in the
community but also some debates. In this Article, we review the
computational-driven discoveries and the recent developments in the field from
various essential aspects, including the theoretical, computational, and,
specifically, artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML) based
approaches emerging within the paradigm of materials informatics. While
challenges and critical gaps can be found in all of these approaches, AI/ML
efforts specifically remain in its infant stage for good reasons. However,
opportunities exist when these approaches can be further developed and
integrated in concerted efforts, in which AI/ML approaches could play more
important roles.

Molecular dynamics simulations for tripeptides in the gas phase and in
solution using empirical and machine-learned energy functions are presented.
For cationic AAA a machine-learned potential energy surface (ML-PES) trained on
MP2 reference data yields quantitative agreement with measured splittings of
the amide-I vibrations. Experimental spectroscopy in solution reports a
splitting of 25 cm-1 which compares with 20 cm-1 from ML/MM-MD simulations of
AAA in explicit solvent. For the AMA tripeptide a ML-PES describing both, the
zwitterionic and neutral form is trained and used to map out the accessible
conformational space. Due to cyclization and H-bonding between the termini in
neutral AMA the NH- and OH-stretch spectra are strongly red-shifted below 3000
cm-1. The present work demonstrates that meaningful MD simulations on the
nanosecond time scale are feasible and provides insight into experiments.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种基于补丁多层感知机的预测控制策略，用于提高高能激光设施的光束指向稳定性，相比传统PID控制能减少10-20%的残余抖动。

High-energy laser facilities such as PHELIX at GSI require excellent beam
pointing stability for reproducibility and relative independence for future
experiments. Beam pointing stability has been traditionally achieved using
simple proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control which removes the problem
of slow drift, but is limited because of the time delay in knowing the
diagnosis and the inertia in the mechanical system associated with mirrors. In
this work, we introduce a predictive control strategy where the forecasting of
beam pointing errors is performed by a patch-based multilayer perceptron
(Patch-MLP) designed to capture local temporal patterns for more robust
short-term jitter prediction. The subsequent conversion of these predicted
errors into correction signals is handled by a PID controller. The neural
network has been trained on diagnostic time-series data to predict beam
pointing error. Using the feed-forward controller compensates for system
delays. Simulations with a correction mirror placed upstream of the PHELIX
pre-amplifier bridge confirm that the predictive control scheme reduces
residual jitter compared to conventional PID control. Over a 10-hour dataset
the controller maintained stable performance without drift, while standard
pointing metrics showed consistent improvements of the order of 10 to 20
percent. The predictive controller operates without drift, and therefore may
improve reproducibility and operational efficiency in high energy, low
repetition rate laser experiment conditions.

Parametric excitation in coupled mechanical systems has enabled advances in
sensing, computation, and phonon control. The function of distinct phase modes
using parametric driving remains insufficiently explored. Here, we investigate
the nonlinear and parametric response of degenerate phase modes in a Double
Ended Tuning Fork (DETF) resonator. Our measurements reveal pronounced
nonlinearity and parametric amplification in the out-phase mode, attributed to
the dominant contribution of the coupling beam, while the in-phase mode remains
predominantly linear. Uniquely, we demonstrate parametric excitation through
the coupling spring, enabling selective amplification and de-amplification
controlled via the relative phase between harmonic and parametric drives. A
parametric gain of $\sim$13 dB is achieved in the out-phase mode, with
phase-dependent modulation of amplification, indicating its suitability for
signal processing, logic operations, and memory elements based on degenerate
modes. These results establish a new approach to exploiting mode-specific
nonlinear dynamics in coupled resonators for emerging applications in sensing
and phononic control.

### Evaluation of Structural Properties and Defect Energetics in Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$N Alloys

Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$N alloys are essential for high-performance optoelectronic
and power devices, yet the role of composition on defect energetics remains
underexplored, largely due to the limitations of first-principles methods in
modeling disordered alloys. To address this, we employ a machine learning
interatomic potential (MLIP) to investigate the structural and defect-related
physical properties in Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$N. The MLIP is first validated by
reproducing the equation of state, lattice constants, and elastic constants of
the binary endpoints, GaN and AlN, as well as known defect formation and
migration energies from density functional theory and empirical potentials. We
then apply the MLIP to evaluate elastic constants of AlGaN alloys, which
reveals a non-linear relation with alloying effect. Our results reveal that
nitrogen Frenkel pair formation energies and the migration barriers for
nitrogen point defects are highly sensitive to the local chemical environment
and migration path. In contrast, Ga and Al vacancy migration energies remain
relatively insensitive to alloy composition, whereas their interstitial
migration energies exhibit stronger compositional dependence. These results
provide quantitative insight into how alloying influences defect energetics in
AlGaN, informing defect engineering strategies for improved material
performance.

We study bosonic symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in (2+1)
dimensions with symmetry $G = G_{\text{space}}\times K$, where
$G_{\text{space}}$ is a general wallpaper group and
$K=\text{U}(1),\mathbb{Z}_N, \text{SO}(3)$ is an internal symmetry. In each
case we propose a set of many-body invariants that can detect all the different
phases predicted from real space constructions and group cohomology
classifications. They are obtained by applying partial rotations and
reflections to a given ground state, combined with suitable operations in $K$.
The reflection symmetry invariants that we introduce include `double partial
reflections', `weak partial reflections' and their `relative' or `twisted'
versions which also depend on $K$. We verify our proposal through exact
calculations on ground states constructed using real space constructions. We
demonstrate our method in detail for the groups p4m and p4g, and in the case of
p4m also derive a topological effective action involving gauge fields for
orientation-reversing symmetries. Our results provide a concrete method to
fully characterize (2+1)D crystalline topological invariants in bosonic SPT
ground states.

The spin-boson (SB) model is a standard prototype for quantum dissipation,
which we generalize in this work, to explore the dissipative effects on a
one-dimensional spin-orbit (SO) coupled particle in the presence of a sub-ohmic
bath. We analyze this model by extending the well-known variational polaron
approach, revealing a localization transition accompanied by an intriguing
change in the spectrum, for which the doubly degenerate minima evolves to a
single minimum at zero momentum as the system-bath coupling increases. For
translational invariant system with conserved momentum, a continuous
magnetization transition occurs, whereas the ground state changes
discontinuously. We further investigate the transition of the ground state in
the presence of harmonic confinement, which effectively models a quantum
dot-like nanostructure under the influence of the environment. In both the
scenarios, the entanglement entropy of the spin-sector can serve as a marker
for these transitions. Interestingly, for the trapped system, a cat-like
superposition state corresponds to maximum entanglement entropy below the
transition, highlighting the relevance of the present model for studying the
effect of decoherence on intra-particle entanglement in the context of quantum
information processing.

\beta-PdBi2 is one of the candidates for topological superconductors with a
superconducting (SC) transition temperature (Tc) of 5.3 K, in which parity
mixing of spin singlet and spin triplet has been anticipated, being crucial for
the further understanding of relationship with inversion symmetry and parity
mixing in the superconductivity. In this work, we measured the SC gap in
high-quality single crystal of \beta-PdBi2 by using high-resolution laser
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy below Tc. We found the isotropic SC
gaps in momentum space for multiple bands, and observed that the difference
between the SC gap of the topological surface bands and the bulk bands is about
0.1 meV, consistent with other experimental results. These direct and
quantitative experimental results support the possibility of \beta-PdBi2 as a
topological superconductor, characterized by unique crystal and electronic band
structures.

Oxide-water interfaces govern a wide range of physical and chemical processes
fundamental to many fields like catalysis, geochemistry, corrosion,
electrochemistry, and sensor technology. Near solid oxide surfaces, water
behaves differently than in the bulk, exhibiting pronounced structuring and
increased reactivity, typically requiring ab initio-level accuracy for reliable
modeling. However, explicit ab initio calculations are often computationally
prohibitive, especially if large system sizes and long simulation time scales
are required. By learning the potential energy surface (PES) from data obtained
from electronic structure calculations, machine learning potentials (MLPs) have
emerged as transformative tools, enabling simulations with ab initio accuracy
at dramatically reduced computational expense. Here, we provide an overview of
recent progress in the application of MLPs to atomistic simulations of
oxide-water interfaces. Specifically, we review insights that have been gained
into the reactivity of interfacial systems involving the dissociation and
recombination of water molecules, proton transfer processes between the solvent
and the surface and the dynamic nature of aqueous oxide surfaces. Moreover, we
discuss open challenges and future possible research directions in this rapidly
evolving but challenging field.

### Photoinduced Electronic Band Dynamics and Defect-mediated Surface Potential Evolution in PdSe$_2$

We use time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (TR-ARPES)
combined with density functional theory to investigate ultrafast carrier
dynamics in low-symmetry layered semiconducting PdSe$_2$. The indirect bandgap
is determined to be 0.55~eV. Following photoexcitation above this gap, we
resolve a valence band shift and broadening, both lasting less than a
picosecond, consistent with bandgap renormalization and carrier scattering,
indicative of strong many-body interactions. Subsequently, hot carriers
populate the conduction band minimum and are captured by defect states. A
surface photovoltage (SPV) of $\sim$ 67~meV emerges, persisting for over 50~ps,
driven by defect-assisted charge separation. The formation of native vacancies,
promoted by the low-symmetry lattice, likely gives rise to the mid-gap states
responsible for this long-lived SPV response. Detailed analysis of TR-ARPES
spectra disentangles the contributions of bandgap renormalization, carrier
scattering, defect states, and SPV. These findings establish PdSe$_2$ as a
prototypical layered quantum material exhibiting exotic photoresponses on
ultrafast timescales.

### Liquid anomalies and Fragility of Supercooled Antimony

Phase-change materials (PCMs) based on group IV, V, and VI elements, such as
Ge, Sb, and Te, exhibit distinctive liquid-state features, including
thermodynamic anomalies and unusual dynamical properties, which are believed to
play a key role in their fast and reversible crystallization behavior. Antimony
(Sb), a monoatomic PCM with ultrafast switching capabilities, stands out as the
only elemental member of this group for which the properties of the liquid and
supercooled states have so far remained unknown. In this work, we use
large-scale molecular dynamics simulations with a neural network potential
trained on first-principles data to investigate the liquid, supercooled, and
amorphous phases of Sb across a broad pressure-temperature range. We uncover
clear signatures of anomalous behavior, including a density maximum and
non-monotonic thermodynamic response functions, and introduce a novel
octahedral order parameter that captures the structural evolution of the
liquid. Moreover, extrapolation of the viscosity to the glass transition, based
on configurational and excess entropies, indicates that Sb is a highly fragile
material. Our results present a compelling new case for the connection between
the liquid-state properties of phase-change materials and their unique ability
to combine high amorphous-phase stability with ultrafast crystallization.

We investigate the phases and phase-transitions in one-dimensional
alternating mixed-spin (1/2-1) chain in the presence of both frustration and
anisotropy. Frustration is introduced via next-nearest-neighbor interactions,
while single-ion anisotropy is incorporated at each lattice site. Our results
show that moderate frustration can drive a phase transition from a
ferrimagnetic state to an anti-ferromagnetic ground state. Remarkably, the
presence of a weak easy-plane anisotropy destabilizes the ferrimagnetic order,
also leading to the emergence of an antiferromagnetic phase. Interestingly,
under strong frustration and anisotropy, the system exhibits signatures of a
novel phase with spin density wave (SDW)-like modulation . We explore these
anomalous phase transitions by employing exact diagonalization (ED) for small
system sizes and the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method to
characterize ground state properties for larger system sizes. We also
investigate the finite-temperature behavior across various phases using the
ancilla-based time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) approach. The primary
objective of this work is to elucidate the phase structure of alternating
mixed-spin chains under the combined effects of frustration and anisotropy. The
primary objective of this work is to elucidate the intricate interplay between
frustration and anisotropy in identifying the exotic phases and
phase-transitions in alternating mixed-spin chains. Our findings contribute to
a deeper understanding of mixed-spin quantum systems and may offer insights for
future theoretical and experimental studies.

- **TL;DR**: 随机重置在谐波势中的布朗运动比热平衡收敛更快，但达到不同的稳态。加速效果和稳态形状由单一无量纲参数控制，在弛豫速度和空间探索范围之间存在权衡。

Stochastic resetting is known for its ability to accelerate search processes
and induce non-equilibrium steady states. Here, we compare the relaxation times
and resulting steady states of resetting and thermal relaxation for Brownian
motion in a harmonic potential. We show that resetting always converges faster
than thermal equilibration, but to a different steady-state. The acceleration
and the shape of the steady-state are governed by a single dimensionless
parameter that depends on the resetting rate, the viscosity, and the stiffness
of the potential. We observe a trade-off between relaxation speed and the
extent of spatial exploration as a function of this dimensionless parameter.
Moreover, resetting relaxes faster even when resetting to positions arbitrarily
far from the potential minimum.

### Josephson effect with periodic order parameter

We investigate the Josephson effect in a two-dimensional superconducting
system with a smoothly and periodically varying order parameter. The order
parameter is modulated along one direction while remaining uniform in the
perpendicular direction, leading to a spatially periodic superconducting phase.
We show that the periodicity of the order parameter determines the winding
number of the eigenfunctions, which serves as a topological characterization of
the system. The winding number is calculated analytically and visualized
through the trajectory of the corresponding three-dimensional Bloch vector. By
solving the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation, we obtain both plane-wave solutions
describing bulk states and exponentially localized solutions that correspond to
edge modes. The analytic bulk-edge connection is employed to identify the
conditions under which the edge states emerge from the bulk spectrum. We find
that the winding numbers depend on the boundary conditions, which differ
between the plane-wave and exponential solutions. These results establish a
direct connection between the spatial modulation of the order parameter, the
topological structure of the eigenstates, and the emergence of edge modes in
periodically modulated Josephson systems.

Instanton theory has arisen as a practical tool for calculating tunneling
splittings in molecular systems. Unfortunately, the original formulation of
instanton theory fundamentally breaks down when trying to calculate the level
splitting in asymmetric double wells, as there is no imaginary-time periodic
orbit connecting the two non-degenerate minima. We have therefore developed a
new formulation of instanton theory based on a projected flux correlation
function that is applicable to these asymmetric systems. Comparison with exact
quantum-mechanical results in one- and two-dimensional models demonstrates that
it has a reasonably high accuracy, similar to that reported for instanton
theory in the symmetric case. The theory is then applied to study tunneling
between non-degenerate minima in the biomolecule $\alpha$-fenchol, for which we
find good agreement with experiment. Finally, we use the connection to
instanton rate theory, which is also derived from flux correlation functions,
to discuss the often misunderstood relationship between tunneling splittings
and reaction rate constants.

The bound electron-hole pairs known as excitons govern the optical properties
of insulating solids. While their behavior in equilibrium is well-understood
theoretically, the nonequilibrium regime at high excitation densities-where
phenomena like electron-hole liquids emerge - is less explored. This thesis
presents a first-principles study of excitons in two-dimensional materials. We
use the GW approximation and the Bethe-Salpeter equation to investigate their
properties from equilibrium to nonequilibrium conditions. We first demonstrate
how increasing photo-excited carrier density leads to a redshift-blueshift
crossover of excitons. We then show that electron-phonon interactions
critically modify optical spectra and exciton lifetimes at finite temperatures.
Finally, we unify these effects to demonstrate the formation of an
electron-hole liquid phase above a critical carrier density and below a
critical temperature. Our work identifies how enhanced Coulomb interactions in
two dimensions can stabilize this phase at significantly higher temperatures,
proposing promising material candidates for observing these collective states.

Conventional spin pumping, driven by magnetization dynamics, is longitudinal
since the pumped spin current flows normal to the interface between the
ferromagnet and the conductor. We predict \textit{Hall-type/transverse} and
\textit{unidirectional} spin pumping into conductors by near-field
electromagnetic radiation emitted by, \textit{e.g.}, magnetization dynamics.
The joint effect of the electric and magnetic fields results in a pure spin
current flowing parallel to the interface, i.e., a Hall-type spin pumping,
which is highly efficient due to the strong coupling to the electric field.
Such a transverse spin current is unidirectional, with the spatial distribution
controlled by the magnetization direction. Our finding reveals a robust
approach for generating and manipulating spin currents in future
low-dimensional spintronic and orbitronic devices.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种自适应并行的Basin Hopping算法实现，用于Lennard-Jones势原子团簇的全局优化，通过并行评估候选结构显著减少计算时间。

We present an adaptive and parallel implementation of the Basin Hopping (BH)
algorithm for the global optimization of atomic clusters interacting via the
Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential. The method integrates local energy minimization
with adaptive step-size Monte Carlo moves and simultaneous evaluation of
multiple trial structures, enabling efficient exploration of complex potential
energy landscapes while maintaining a balance between exploration and
refinement. Parallel evaluation of candidate structures significantly reduces
wall-clock time, achieving nearly linear speedup for up to eight concurrent
local minimizations. This framework provides a practical and scalable strategy
to accelerate Basin Hopping searches, directly extendable to ab initio
calculations such as density functional theory (DFT) on high-performance
computing architectures.

We investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of charge density waves in a
pumped one-dimensional Hubbard superlattice with staggered onsite Coulomb
interactions at half-filling, using time-dependent exact diagonalization. In
equilibrium, the system exhibits commensurate charge correlations consistent
with the superlattice periodicity. Under laser excitation, the charge
correlation function exhibits distinct behaviors across four representative
frequencies, spanning both linear and nonlinear optical regimes. Notably, we
observe a laser-induced commensurate-to-incommensurate transition in the charge
order, manifested by a shift in the peak wavevector of the charge structure
factor. This transition is driven by sublattice-selective doublon-holon
dynamics, where the laser frequency and intensity determine whether excitations
predominantly destabilize the charge order on the weakly or strongly
interacting sublattice. Our analysis of the excitation spectrum and
site-resolved correlation dynamics reveals the underlying mechanisms of this
transition. These results suggest a promising optical strategy for controlling
charge order in superlattice-based quantum materials.

### Superconductivity in hyperbolic spaces: Cayley trees, hyperbolic continuum, and BCS theory

We investigate $s$-wave superconductivity in negatively curved geometries,
focusing on Cayley trees and the hyperbolic plane. Using a self-consistent
Bogoliubov-de Gennes approach for trees and a BCS treatment of the hyperbolic
continuum, we establish a unified mean-field framework that captures the role
of boundaries in hyperbolic spaces. For finite Cayley trees with open
boundaries, the superconducting order parameter localizes at the edge while the
interior can remain normal, leading to two distinct critical temperatures:
$T_\textrm{c}^\textrm{edge} &gt; T_\textrm{c}^\textrm{bulk}$. A corresponding
boundary-dominated phase also emerges in hyperbolic annuli and horodisc
regions, where radial variations of the local density of states enhance edge
pairing. We also demonstrate that the enhancement of the density of states at
the boundary is significantly more pronounced for the discrete tree geometry.
Our results show that, owing to the macroscopic extent of the boundary,
negative curvature can stabilize boundary superconductivity as a phase that
persists in the thermodynamic limit on par with the bulk superconductivity.
These results highlight fundamental differences between bulk and boundary
ordering in hyperbolic matter, and provide a theoretical framework for future
studies of correlated phases in negatively curved systems.

### Knowledge Distillation of Noisy Force Labels for Improved Coarse-Grained Force Fields

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种知识蒸馏框架来改进粗粒度分子动力学模型，通过先训练教师模型去噪CG力标签，然后蒸馏其力和能量预测来训练更精确的学生模型。

Molecular dynamics simulations are an integral tool for studying the
atomistic behavior of materials under diverse conditions. However, they can be
computationally demanding in wall-clock time, especially for large systems,
which limits the time and length scales accessible. Coarse-grained (CG) models
reduce computational expense by grouping atoms into simplified representations
commonly termed beads, but sacrifice atomic detail and introduce mapping noise,
complicating the training of machine-learned surrogates. Moreover, because CG
models inherently include entropic contributions, they cannot be fit directly
to all-atom energies, leaving instantaneous, noisy forces as the only
state-specific quantities available for training. Here, we apply a knowledge
distillation framework by first training an initial CG neural network potential
(the teacher) solely on CG-mapped forces to denoise those labels, then distill
its force and energy predictions to train refined CG models (the student) in
both single- and ensemble-training setups while exploring different force and
energy target combinations. We validate this framework on a complex molecular
fluid - a deep eutectic solvent - by evaluating two-, three-, and many-body
properties and compare the CG and all-atom results. Our findings demonstrate
that training a student model on ensemble teacher-predicted forces and per-bead
energies improves the quality and stability of CG force fields.

### Temperature dependent ferroelectricity in strained KTaO3 with machine learned force field

Ferroelectric materials are a class of dielectrics that exhibit spontaneous
polarization which can be reversed under an external electric field. The
emergence of ferroelectric order in incipient ferroelectrics is a topic of
considerable interest from both fundamental and applied perspectives. Among the
various strategies explored, strain engineering has been proven to be a
powerful method for tuning ferroelectric polarization in materials. In the case
of KTaO3, first principles calculations have suggested that strain can drive a
ferroelectric phase transition. In this study, we investigate the impact of
in-plane uniaxial and biaxial strain, ranging from 0% to 1%, on pristine KTaO3
to explore its potential for ferroelectricity induction via inversion symmetry
breaking. By integrating density functional theory calculations with the
stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation assisted by on the fly
machine learned force field, we obtain accurate structural information and
dynamical properties under varying strain conditions while incorporating
higher-order anharmonic effects. Employing the Berry phase method, we obtained
the ferroelectric polarization of the strained structures over the entire
temperature range up to 300 K. Our findings provide valuable insights into the
role of strain in stabilizing ferroelectricity in KTaO3, offering guidance for
future experimental and theoretical studies on strain-engineered ferroelectric
materials.

### Effective-Hamiltonian reconstruction through Bloch-wave interferometry in bulk GaAs driven by strong THz fields

- **TL;DR**: 通过结合吸收光谱和HSG实验，成功重建了GaAs的三带电子-空穴有效哈密顿量，展示了哈密顿量重建的完整能力。

Effective Hamiltonians are powerful tools for understanding the emergent
phenomena in condensed matter systems. Reconstructing an effective Hamiltonian
directly from experimental data is challenging due to the complex relationship
between Hamiltonian parameters and observables. Complimentary to ARPES, which
probes surface electronic properties, bulk-sensitive techniques based on HHG
and HSG have shown strong potential for Hamiltonian reconstruction. Here, we
reconstruct an effective three-band electron-hole Hamiltonian in bulk GaAs
based on HSG. Based on previous understanding of HSG in bulk GaAs in terms of
Bloch-wave interferometry, an analytic model is derived to quantitatively
connect the Hamiltonian parameters with the measured sideband electric fields
under strong, low-frequency THz fields. Assuming that the exciton reduced mass
and the parameter that defines the hole Bloch wavefunctions in bulk GaAs are
known from existing absorbance and HSG experiments, we show that the bandgap of
GaAs, two dephasing constants associated with two electron-hole species, and an
additional Hamiltonian parameter that determines the electron-hole reduced
masses, can be simultaneously and unambiguously determined through Bloch-wave
interferometry. We thus demonstrate the full capability of Hamiltonian
reconstruction by combining absorbance spectroscopy and HSG experiments. We
find that the extracted bandgap of GaAs is approximately 13\,meV higher than
the expected value based on previous absorbance measurements. Quantum kinetic
analysis suggests that, in the HSG experiments, the electron-hole energy could
have been renormalized through Fr\"ohlich interaction that is modified by the
strong THz fields. We also show that the energy threshold in emission of
optical phonons can be suppressed by applying a strong THz field, leading to
nearly constant dephasing rates.

### Dynamical control of Coulomb interactions and Hubbard bands in monolayer 1T-TaS$_2$

- **TL;DR**: 该论文研究了1T-TaS2单层中电荷密度波(CDW)振幅与电子关联强度之间的耦合机制，揭示了晶格畸变如何通过调节库仑相互作用影响莫特绝缘体-金属相变。

Monolayer 1T-TaS$_2$ hosts a star-of-David charge-density wave (CDW) that
stabilizes a low-temperature Mott-insulating state. Recent time-resolved
spectroscopies indicate a coupling between the CDW amplitude mode and the
electronic correlation strength, yet the role of the screened Coulomb
interaction remains unclear. Using the constrained random-phase approximation,
we show that the CDW amplitude modifies the bare and screened on-site
interactions, leading to sizable variations in the effective Hubbard U. Our
combined density functional and dynamical mean-field theory calculations reveal
that the Hubbard bands shift in concert with the CDW amplitude, and that a
reduced distortion drives a transition from a Mott insulator to a correlated
metal. These results demonstrate a direct link between lattice distortions and
Coulomb interactions in transition-metal dichalcogenides, providing a
microscopic mechanism for light-induced control of correlated phases in
two-dimensional quantum materials.

### Emergence of charge-$4e$ superconductivity from 2D nematic superconductors

Charge-$4e$ superconductivity is an exotic state of matter that may emerge as
a vestigial order from a charge-$2e$ superconductor with multicomponent
superconducting order parameters. Showing its emergence in a microscopic model
from numerically-exact large-scale computations has been rare so far. Here, we
propose a microscopic lattice model with a nematic superconducting ground state
and show that it supports a rich set of vestigial phases at elevated
temperature, including a charge-$4e$ phase and a quasi-long-range nematic
phase, by performing large-scale Monte Carlo simulations. Combining theoretical
analysis with Monte Carlo simulations, we uncover the nature of these phases
and show that the phase transitions are governed by the proliferation of
distinct topological defects: half superconducting vortices,
$(\tfrac{1}{2},\tfrac{1}{2})$ vortices, integer nematic vortices, and
domain-wall excitations. In particular, we demonstrate that domain-wall
proliferation is crucial for the quasi-nematic phase and should be carefully
accounted for in phase transitions associated with vestigial charge-$4e$ order.

### Orbital Optimization and Neural-Network-Assisted Configuration Interaction Calculations of Rydberg States

- **TL;DR**: 提出一种使用平面波基组优化分子轨道的方法，用于准确计算分子的里德堡激发态，解决了传统原子基组对里德堡态过度限制的问题。

Rydberg excited states of molecules pose a challenge for electronic structure
calculations because of their highly diffuse electron distribution. Even large
and elaborate atomic basis sets tend to underrepresent the long-range tail,
overly confining the Rydberg state. An approach is presented where the
molecular orbitals are variationally optimized for the excited state using a
plane wave basis set in Hartree-Fock calculations, followed by configuration
interaction calculations on the resulting reference. Using excited state
optimized plane wave orbitals greatly enhances the convergence of the many-body
calculation, as illustrated by a full configuration interaction calculation of
the 2s Rydberg state of H$_2$. A neural-network-based selective configuration
interaction approach is then applied to calculations of the 3s, 3p$_x$ and
3p$_y$ states of H$_2$O and the 3s and 3p$_z$ states of NH$_3$. The obtained
values of excitation energy are in close agreement with experimental
measurements as well as previous many-body calculations based on sufficiently
diffuse atomic basis sets. Previously reported high-level calculations limited
to atomic basis sets lacking extra diffuse functions, such as aug-cc-pVTZ, give
significantly higher estimates due to confinement of the Rydberg states.

Here we show the first experimental implementation of the fully general
Kitaev chain with complex-valued order parameter $\Delta$ and site-varying
synthetic chemical potential $\mu$, using a passive multilayer acoustic
resonator design and fabrication. Our laboratory model faithfully reproduces
the key symmetries and the topological phase diagram of the model, and displays
robust Majorana-like edge modes spatially localized at smoothly engineered
domain walls and energetically localized in the middle of the bulk spectral
gap. We demonstrate precise control over mode positioning through smooth
spatial variations of $\mu$, and validate the stability of the modes and of the
spectral gap under continuous and complex variations of $\Delta$ -- both
critical requirements for topological braiding operations. These results
establish and validate the fundamental building blocks for experimental
implementation of complete braiding protocols, opening concrete pathways toward
accessible non-abelian physics and topologically protected information
processing.

### Theoretical design of the large topological magnetoelectric effect in the Co-intercalated NbS$_2$ structure

A triangular Co-ion lattice intercalated between 1-H NbS$_2$ layers can
exhibit a large anomalous Hall effect (AHE) due to the finite scalar spin
chirality originating from the non-coplanar $3q$ ordering of Co spins. This
large AHE occurs when the scalar spin chirality is uniform in all Co layers, as
indeed found in the Co$_{1/3}$NbS$_2$ case [Phys. Rev. Mater. 6, 024201
(2022)]. However, if the spin chirality were staggered with the opposite signs
in the adjacent Co layers, the net AHE would disappear, yielding instead the
topological magneto-electric effect. Here, we theoretically verify that a
transverse electric field generates a finite orbital magnetization under such
conditions, consistent with the axion-like coupling. Using first-principles
calculations, we show that the resulting magneto-electric coupling,
$\alpha^{zz}$ can be as large as 0.9 $e^2/2h$. We also demonstrate that the
inter-layer magnetic coupling in these materials can be tuned by strain,
enabling the switching between the AHE and the axionic states.

We report a comprehensive study of electronic-correlation effects in
Manganese-based antiferromagnetic pnictides BaMn$_2$Pn$_2$ (Pn=P,As,Sb,Bi). Our
density functional theory plus slave-spin mean-field simulations indicate that
all the compounds lie on the strong-coupling side of an itinerant-to-localized
moment crossover, corresponding to the critical interaction strength for the
Mott transition in the high-temperature paramagnetic phase. We also show that
the experimental N\'eel temperature of each compound scales with the distance
from this crossover.

Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures allow the engineering of electronic and
magnetic properties by the stacking different two-dimensional vdW materials.
For example, orbital hybridisation and charge transfer at a vdW interface may
result in electric fields across the interface that give rise to Rashba
spin-orbit coupling. In magnetic vdW heterostructures, this in turn can drive
the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction which leads to a canting of local
magnetic moments at the vdW interface and may thus stabilise novel 2D magnetic
phases. While such emergent magnetic "interphases" offer a promising platform
for spin-based electronics, direct spectroscopic evidence for them is still
lacking. Here, we report Zeeman effects with Land\'e $g$-factors up to
$\approx230$ at the interface of graphene and the vdW ferromagnet
Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$. They arise from a magnetic interphase in which local-moment
canting and itinerant orbital moments generated by the non-trivial band
topology of Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ conspire to cause a giant asymmetric level splitting
when a magnetic field is applied. Exploiting the inelastic phonon gap of
graphene, we can directly access the buried vdW interface to the Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$
by scanning tunnelling spectroscopy. Systematically analyzing the Faraday-like
screening of the tip electric field by the graphene, we demonstrate the
tunability of the constitutional interface dipole, as well as the Zeeman
effect, by tip gating. Our findings are supported by density functional theory
and electrostatic modelling.

Heat conduction and radiation are two of the three fundamental modes of heat
transfer, playing a critical role in a wide range of scientific and engineering
applications ranging from energy systems to materials science. However,
traditional physics-based simulation methods for modeling these processes often
suffer from prohibitive computational costs. In recent years, the rapid
advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have
demonstrated remarkable potential in the modeling of nanoscale heat conduction
and radiation. This review presents a comprehensive overview of recent
AI-driven developments in modeling heat conduction and radiation at the
nanoscale. We first discuss the ML techniques for predicting phonon properties,
including phonon dispersion and scattering rates, which are foundational for
determining material thermal properties. Next, we explore the role of
machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) in molecular dynamics
simulations and their applications to bulk materials, low-dimensional systems,
and interfacial transport. We then review the ML approaches for solving
radiative heat transfer problems, focusing on data-driven solutions to
Maxwell's equations and the radiative transfer equation. We further discuss the
ML-accelerated inverse design of radiative energy devices, including
optimization-based and generative model-based methods. Finally, we discuss open
challenges and future directions, including data availability, model
generalization, uncertainty quantification, and interpretability. Through this
survey, we aim to provide a foundational understanding of how AI techniques are
reshaping thermal science and guiding future research in nanoscale heat
transfer.

Topological phases in two-dimensional quantum lattice models are often
studied on cylinders for revealing different topological properties and making
the problem numerically tractable. This makes a proper understanding of
finite-circumference effects crucial for reliably extrapolating the results to
the thermodynamic limit. Using matrix product states, we investigate these
effects for the Laughlin-1/2 phase in the Hofstadter-Bose-Hubbard model, which
can be viewed as the lattice discretization of the bosonic quantum Hall problem
in the continuum. We propose a scaling of the model's parameters with the
cylinder circumference that simultaneously approaches the continuum and
thermodynamic limits. We find that different scaling schemes yield distinct
topological signatures: we either retrieve a spontaneous formation of charge
density wave ordering reminiscent of the Tao-Thouless states, known from the
continuum problem on thin cylinders, or we find uniform states with a
topological degeneracy that can be identified as minimally entangled states
known from studies of chiral spin liquids on cylinders. Finally, we carry out a
similar analysis of the non-Abelian Moore-Read phase in the same model. Our
results clarify the role of symmetries in numerical studies of topologically
ordered states on cylinders and highlight the role of lattice effects.

The interaction between hydrogen atoms and carbon nanoparticles is a
fundamental process governing the properties of carbonaceous materials in
environments ranging from combustion systems to the interstellar medium. This
study investigates the effects of controlled atomic hydrogen exposure on young
and mature soot nanoparticles, generated in premixed ethylene-air flames, and
deposited on substrates. We employed a multi-technique approach to characterize
the chemical, mechanical, and electrical evolution of the films. In-situ
infrared spectroscopy revealed non-monotonic behavior: an initial increase in
aliphatic CH bonds was observed, followed by a decrease at higher hydrogen
fluences. This was accompanied by a continuous decrease in the aromatic C=C
signal. Atomic force microscopy showed a significant increase in the Young's
modulus of the film for both sample types after hydrogenation. This mechanical
change was correlated with an increase in the I(D)/I(G) ratio from Raman
spectroscopy. Furthermore, both macroscopic current vs. voltage and local
scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements demonstrated a notable increase in
electrical conductivity. For single just-formed soot particles, moreover, a
hydrogen-induced transformation from a semiconductive to a semi-metallic nature
was observed. The collective evidence points towards an H-induced CC
cross-linking mechanism within the nanoparticle films. We propose that atomic
hydrogen facilitates the formation of radical sites, which promotes covalent
bond formation between adjacent particles or molecular units, creating a more
interconnected and rigid network, with smaller interlayer distance. These
findings provide crucial insights into the structural evolution of carbonaceous
materials in hydrogen-rich environments, with direct implications for
understanding soot formation and for the tailored design of carbon-based
materials.

Currently, machine learning methods are developing rapidly in polymer material

application for researchers in traditional fields. In response to the above
issues, this paper first analyzes the inherent challenges in the research and
development of polymer materials, including structural complexity and the
limitations of traditional trial-and-error methods. To address these problems,
it focuses on introducing key basic technologies such as molecular descriptors
and feature representation, data standardization and cleaning, and records a
number of high-quality polymer databases. Subsequently, it elaborates on the
key role of machine learning in polymer property prediction and material
design, covering the specific applications of algorithms such as traditional
machine learning, deep learning, and transfer learning; further, it deeply
expounds on data-driven design strategies, such as reverse design,
high-throughput virtual screening, and multi-objective optimization. The paper
also systematically introduces the complete process of constructing
high-reliability machine learning models and summarizes effective experimental
verification, model evaluation, and optimization methods. Finally, it
summarizes the current technical challenges in research, such as data quality
and model generalization ability, and looks forward to future development
trends including multi-scale modeling, physics-informed machine learning,
standardized data sharing, and interpretable machine learning.

Motivated by recent observations of fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) in the
vicinity of superconducting (SC) phases, we study fractional quantum
(anomalous) Hall-superconductor heterostructures in the presence of $U(1)$
order-parameter fluctuations and particularly focus on the case of $\nu = 2/3$
quantum Hall states leading to $\mathbb Z_3$ parafermions. We first employ a
phenomenological field theory to qualitatively determine the phase diagram.
Furthermore, we generalize a previously established alternating pattern of
superconductor and tunneling regions, coupled to fractional quantum Hall edge
states, to map the problem onto a topological Josephson junction chain
involving lattice parafermions. Using density matrix renormalization group
simulations, we establish a phase diagram composed of Mott insulating phases
and two different Luttinger liquids whose fundamental excitations carry charges
2e and $2e/3$, respectively. In agreement with analytical considerations using
conformal field theory, we numerically find transitions of
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) type as well as a continuous $\mathbb Z_3
\times U(1)$ second-order phase transition characterized by central charge c =
9/5. We finally extract information about a possible ground state degeneracy
and comment on the stability of parafermionic edge states in the presence of
fluctuations. These theoretical foundations can be expected to be of practical
importance for gate-defined FCI-SC heterostructures in moir\'e materials, in
which broad superconducting transitions indicative of strong order parameter
fluctuations were observed.

We revisit the problem of deceleration of a charge moving in a medium. Going
beyond the traditional approach, which relies on Ehrenfest dynamics, we treat
the projectile fully quantum mechanically, on the same footing as the electrons
of the target. In order to separate the dynamics of the projectile from that of
the electrons, we employ the Exact Factorization method. We illustrate the
resulting theory by applying it to the problem of the stopping power (SP) of a
jellium-model metal for slowly moving charges. The quantum mechanical nature of
particles manifests itself remarkably in the differences in the SP for
projectiles of the same charge moving with the same velocity, but having
different masses.

### Probing Topological Phases in a Strongly Correlated Ladder Model via Entanglement

The interplay between non-trivial band topology and strong electronic
correlations is a central challenge in modern condensed matter physics. We
investigate this competition on a two-leg ladder model with a p-wave-like
hybridisation between the legs. This model hosts a symmetry-protected
topological phase in its non-interacting limit. Using the density-matrix
renormalisation group algorithm, we compute the comprehensive quantum phase
diagram in the presence of a repulsive inter-leg density-density interaction.
Our analysis, based on entanglement entropy and the entanglement spectrum,
reveals a fascinating dichotomy in the stability of the topological phase. We
find a non-trivial change in the value of the edge entanglement entropy as we
include interaction. Furthermore, we find that the phase boundary separating a
trivial insulator phase and a topological one with winding number two remains
robustly pinned at its non-interacting location, irrespective of the
interaction strength. Variation of the effective conformal field theory's
central charge near the critical line explains the robustness of the gap. In
contrast, the transition to an insulating phase with winding number one is
heavily renormalised, with the critical line shifting significantly as the
interaction increases. By successfully mapping the phase diagram and
identifying the distinct behaviours of the phase boundaries, our work clarifies
how interactions can selectively preserve or destroy different aspects of a
topological phase.

### Impact of AlN buffer thickness on electrical and thermal characteristics of AlGaN/GaN/AlN HEMTs

We investigate the influence of AlN buffer thickness on the structural,
electrical, and thermal properties of AlGaN/GaN high-electron mobility
transistors (HEMTs) grown on semi-insulating SiC substrates by metal-organic
chemical vapor deposition. X-ray diffraction and atomic force microscopy reveal
that while thin AlN layers (120 nm) exhibit compressive strain and smooth
step-flow surfaces, thicker single-layer buffers (550 nm) develop tensile
strain and increased surface roughness. Multi-layer buffer structures up to 2
{\mu}m alleviate strain and maintain surface integrity. Low-temperature Hall
measurements confirm that electron mobility decreases with increasing interface
roughness, with the highest mobility observed in the structure with a thin AlN
buffer. Transient thermoreflectance measurements show that thermal conductivity
(ThC) of the AlN buffer increases with the thickness, reaching 188 W/m.K at 300
K for the 2 {\mu}m buffer layer, which is approximately 60% of the bulk AlN ThC
value. These results highlight the importance of optimizing AlN buffer design
to balance strain relaxation, thermal management, and carrier transport for
high-performance GaN-based HEMTs.

### Role of Phase Fluctuation in Dynamic Competition Between Charge Order and Superconductivity in Cuprates

Phase fluctuations are a key factor distinguishing nonthermal (ultrafast) and
thermal phase transitions. Charge order in cuprates is characterized by
short-range coherence while competing with superconductivity, and as such, it
provides a representative case to study the role of phase fluctuation in
coupled order parameter dynamics. In this work, we investigated the intertwined
evolution of charge order and superconductivity in cuprate/manganite
heterostructures using time-resolved resonant X-ray scattering. The resulting
dynamics are analyzed within a space- and time-dependent nonperturbative model
capturing both amplitude and phase dynamics. At low fluence, photo-induced
suppression of superconductivity results in a nonthermal enhancement of charge
order, underscoring the dynamic competition between charge order and
superconductivity. With increasing fluence, the slowing down of melting and
recovery dynamics is observed, indicating a critical role of phase
fluctuations. At high fluence, both charge order and superconductivity remain
suppressed for an extended time window due to decoupling between amplitude and
phase dynamics and the delayed recovery of phase coherence. Our work
underscores the importance of phase fluctuation for understanding the dynamic
competition between order parameters in cuprates.

We present a short review of an unusual but important application for a

concerning a contribution from Casimir forces across high-temperature
electron-positron plasma in nuclear interactions. The key message in the
current work is how high temperatures ($\sim10^{11}$ \,K) pop out as essential.

the Universe.

### Spin Polarons in Flat Band Ferromagnets

- **TL;DR**: 本文报告了在一维Mielke-Tasaki链中发现自旋极化子的形成，该模型具有平带铁磁性、平凡能带拓扑和淬灭的动能，但电子掺杂后仍能形成自旋极化子。

Spin polarons are bound states of electrons and spin-flips that form above
spin polarized electronic insulators.These bound states conventionally form in
one of two settings: in frustrated lattices with dispersive bands -- where the
motion of an electron preferences binding a nearby spin-flip -- or in
topological flat bands -- where the Chern number enforces an effective dipolar
interaction between electrons and spin flips. In this work, we report the
formation of a spin polaron in a context that doesn't fall cleanly into either
of these paradigms. In particular, we study the one-dimensional Mielke-Tasaki
chain, a paradigmatic model of flat band ferromagnetism, which has an exact
ferromagnetic ground state, trivial band topology, and quenched kinetic energy
in its lowest band. Despite these features, our density matrix renormalization
group simulations reveal the presence of spin polarons upon electron doping
this model. More surprisingly, combining these numerics with analytic
calculations, we show that polaron binding occurs when the interaction-induced
kinetic energy of the model is zero -- contrary to intuition from kinetic
magnetism -- and the glue binding the electrons and spin-flips arises from weak
mixing with the model's dispersive band -- contrary to what occurs in
topological flat bands. Our results open the doors to exploring how the quantum
geometry of flat bands drives the formation of exotic charge carriers.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种基于电场的精确方法，用于研究中心对称非磁性晶体中的隐藏自旋极化和自旋层分离现象，并在PtTe2单层材料中验证了该方法。

The emergence of hidden spin polarization in centrosymmetric nonmagnetic
crystals due to local symmetry breaking has created new opportunities for
potential spintronic applications and for enhancing our understanding of
mechanisms to electrically manipulate spin-related phenomena. In this work, we
investigate within density functional theory the properties of the hidden spin
texture and spin-layer segregation in a prototype centrosymmetric
dichalcogenide-monolayer material using an electric-field-based method. This
method is shown to yield a precise and robust alternative to traditional
layer-projected spin-polarization techniques for obtaining the intrinsic hidden
spin textures in such materials. Moreover, it gives access at the same time to
the spatial distribution within the monolayer of the individual spin-segregated
states responsible for the hidden spin textures, not provided by other
techniques. With this approach we determine and study the hidden spin textures
of the upper valence bands of the PtTe2 monolayer together with the spatial
behavior of the probability densities and spin polarization densities of the
corresponding maximally segregated spin states. This combined study enabled by
the electric-field method yields new insights into the mechanisms controlling
the spin-layer segregation and resulting hidden spin texture in such systems.
We also discuss the symmetry rules governing the shape in the Brillouin zone of
the hidden spin texture, which can be straightforwardly predicted within the
present framework.

### Resonating-valence-bond superconductor from small Fermi surface in twisted bilayer graphene

Mechanism of superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) remains one
of the central problems in strongly correlated topological systems. The most
intriguing question is about the nature of the normal state: is the Cooper pair
formed from small Fermi surface or large Fermi surface? In this work we point
out the possibility of a symmetric pseudogap metal with small hole pockets,
dubbed as second Fermi liquid (sFL). In the sFL phase at $\nu=-2-x$, there is a
two-component picture: two electrons mainly localize on the AA sites and form a
paired singlet due to anti-Hund's coupling mediated by the optical phonon,
while additional holes form small Fermi surfaces. The sFL phase corresponds to
an intrinsically strongly interacting fixed point and violates the perturbative
Luttinger theorem. We develop a unified framework to describe both a
renormalized Fermi liquid (FL) and an sFL phase. We propose that the normal
state of the TBG superconductor is the sFL phase, but it evolves toward the FL
phase under increasing hole doping. The superconducting phase emerges from the
sFL phase by transferring pairing of local moments to the mobile carriers.
Interestingly, the superconducting gap can exhibit a nematic nodal
$p_x$-pairing symmetry. This work provides, to our knowledge, the first unified
theory that explains both the pseudogap metal above $T_c$ and the two-gap
nematic superconductivity below it.

Uniaxial spintronic heterostructures constitute compact THz emitters under
femtosecond excitation, with emission amplitude and polarization governed by
the applied magnetic field. We demonstrate here efficient magnetically tunable
THz amplitude control in ultrathin, exchange-biased Co/Pt/Co/IrMn spin valve
heterostructures. Terahertz spintronic magnetometry resolves reversible
switching between parallel and antiparallel magnetization states and correlates
the high- and low-emission regimes with constructive and destructive
interference of charge transients generated by the inverse spin Hall effect in
the Pt spacer. A residual low-emission signal is traced to spin-to-charge
conversion in IrMn. Phase inversion under front- versus back-side excitation
confirms the ISHE origin, while a macrospin Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert model
reproduces the field dependence and separates layer-specific contributions.
Together, these results define a wafer-compatible spin valve device
architecture that enables efficient, low-field THz amplitude control.

As interest in sustainable materials grows, paper is being reimagined as a
multifunctional substrate with significant potential for future technologies
for innovative, environmentally friendly solutions. This study investigates the
swelling behavior and environmental responsiveness of a copolymer,
poly(N,N-dimethylacrylamide-co-4-methacryloyloxybenzophenone)
(P(DMAA-co-MABP)), when applied to cellulosic paper for use in
humidity-sensitive actuators. The copolymer's swelling behavior was
characterized using dynamic vapor sorption (DVS) and in-situ atomic force
microscopy (AFM). DVS measurements demonstrated that the polymer coating
significantly enhances the hygroscopic properties of the paper, while AFM
revealed the polymer's fast response to relative humidity (RH) changes, shown
by immediate height adjustments, increased adhesion, and decreased stiffness at
higher RH levels.Studies on polymer-modified paper-based bilayer actuators
demonstrate that incorporating the hydrophilic P(DMAA-co-MABP) results in
actuation in response to relative humidity variations between 10% and 90% RH.
From these findings, two models were proposed to assess key mechanisms in the
swelling behavior: the correlation between the heterogeneity in crosslinking
and the polymer swelling behavior, and the correlation between polymer-paper
interactions and the hygro-responsive bending behavior. Additionally, thermal
analysis was performed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC), providing a comprehensive profile of the
copolymer's behavior.

Two-dimensional bismuth (Bi) is a promising platform for quantum and energy
technologies due to strong spin-orbit coupling, high thermoelectric efficiency,
and magnetoresistance. However, scalable and flexible synthesis of high-quality
Bi with fast research turnaround remains challenging. We report a controlled
colloidal synthesis of Bi nanosheets with tunable lateral sizes (0.6 - 4.1 um),
hexagonal shape, and a layered single-crystalline structure along the {00l}
planes. The nanosheets exhibit excellent oxidation resistance and ambient
stability. ARPES measurements on individual nanosheets reveal a band structure
in excellent agreement with DFT calculations, confirming high crystal quality
and uniformity. Our findings enable fast production and characterization of
two-dimensional Bi, paving the way for fundamental studies and integration into
next-generation quantum and energy devices.

The magnetic ground state of RuO$_2$ has been under intense debate. Using
first-principles calculations, we show that compressive strain along [001]
direction stabilizes an altermagnetic phase in RuO$_2$ thin films grown on
(100) and (110) TiO$_2$ substrates. We further identify that compressive strain
enhances the density of states near the Fermi level, resulting in a Fermi
surface instability and the emergence of altermagnetism. The magnitude of
strain and the associated increase in the density of states can be tuned by
varying the film thickness, as systematically confirmed by x-ray diffraction
and photoemission spectroscopy measurements. Symmetry analysis further reveals
that (100) RuO$_2$ hosts an ideal altermagnetic order, whereas broken symmetry
in (110) films leads to an uncompensated ferrimagnetic state. Finally, we
discuss the effects of Hubbard $U$ parameters and evaluate the realistic
tunneling magnetoresistance of (100) RuO$_2$.

Helium and rare gases (RG: Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe) are typically considered
chemically inert, yet under the extreme pressures of planetary interiors they
may form compounds with unexpected properties. Using crystal structure
prediction and first-principles calculations, we mapped the phase diagram of
binary He-RG systems up to $1$ TPa. We identify several previously unknown
stoichiometric compounds that are both thermodynamically and vibrationally
stable at sub-terapascal pressures, within the reach of modern high-pressure
experiments. In particular, AHe$_{2}$ and AHe (A: Ar, Kr, Xe) adopt previously
unreported orthorhombic, hexagonal and cubic phases that remain stable over
wide pressure ranges. We further find that He-Xe systems host metallic and
excitonic insulator phases at pressures nearly an order of magnitude lower than
those required for pure helium, offering a pathway to realize these exotic
quantum states experimentally. Finite-temperature simulations also reveal
superionic He-Xe phases, in which helium ions diffuse either anisotropically or
isotropically depending on the host lattice. These findings constitute the
first prediction of helium-based systems that combine metallicity and
superionicity, with profound implications for energy transport and planetary
dynamo processes. Overall, our results demonstrate that mixing helium with
heavier rare gases provides an effective strategy to stabilize metallic,
excitonic insulator, and superionic phases at experimentally accessible
pressures, opening new research directions for condensed matter physics and
planetary science.
