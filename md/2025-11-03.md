- **Title (EN)**: PyTIE: A Python Program for the Evaluation of Degree-Based Topological Descriptors and Molecular Entropy
- **Authors**: Sahaya Vijay Jeyaraj, Roy S, Govardhan S, Tony Augustine, Jyothish K
- **Categories**: physics.chem-ph, math.CO
- **TL;DR**: PyTIE是一个开源的Python软件包集合，用于快速计算分子图的各种拓扑指数，包括基于度和邻域度的指数以及香农熵，支持QSAR和QSPR分析。

We have developed PyTIE (Python Topological Indices Expressions) which is
defined as the collections of Python packages such as PyTIE D, PyTIE DS, PyTIE
SMS DE, and PyTIE SMS DSE, which are open-source software packages and
cross-platform Python package designed to expedite the retrieval of results for
mathematics, chemistry and chemical engineering researchers within constant
time. This open-source tool extends its utility to chemistry and chemical
engineering researchers with limited mathematical proficiency. PyTIE
facilitates the loading of molecular graphs, specifying parameters such as
minimum degree, maximum degree, and the number of vertex pairs (edge
partitions). The edge partitions of a molecular graph based on degree sum also
plays a crucial role in predicting heat of formation and enthalpy of formation
along with DFT techniques. It systematically computes expressions and numerical
values for various topological indices, including degree-based and neighborhood
degree-based indices, as well as Shannon's entropy, providing visual
representations of the results. Emphasizing topological indices for
Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship and Quantitative
Structure-Property Relationship analyses, PyTIE proves particularly relevant in
these studies. Serving as a Python package, it seamlessly integrates with
libraries such as NumPy, math and SymPy offering extensive options for data
analysis. The efficiency of PyTIE is demonstrated through illustrative examples
in various contexts.

- **TL;DR**: 本文首次推导并实现了用于计算振动圆二色谱(VCD)的原子轴向张量(AATs)的解析梯度方法，基于包含双激发(CID)和单双激发(CISD)的组态相互作用方法。

In this work, we present the first derivation and implementation of analytic
gradient methods for the computation of the atomic axial tensors (AATs)
required for simulations of vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) spectra using
configuration interaction methods including double (CID) and single and double
(CISD) excitations. Our new implementation includes the use of non-canonical
perturbed orbitals to improve the numerical stability of the gradients in the
presence of orbital near-degeneracies, as well as frozen-core capabilities. We
validated our analytic CID and CISD formulations against two new
finite-difference approaches. Using this new implementation, we investigated
the significance of singly excited determinants and the role of CI-coefficient
optimization in VCD simulations by comparisons among Hartree-Fock (HF) theory,
second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation (MP2) theory, CID, and CISD
theories. For our molecular test set including (P )-hydrogen peroxide, (S
)-methyloxirane, (R)-3-chloro-1-butene, (R)-4-methyl-2-oxetanone, and (M
)-1,3-dimethylallene we noted sign discrepancies between the HF and MP2 methods
compared to that of the new CID and CISD methods for four of the five molecules
as well as similar discrepancies between the CID and CISD methods for (M
)-1,3-dimethylallene.

- **TL;DR**: 本文通过数值模拟研究了静态非均匀磁场下金属离子在多孔介质中的磁泳现象，发现Brinkman模型比Stokes模型更能准确预测离子输运行为，并揭示了顺磁性和反磁性离子在磁场梯度下形成团簇的机制。

We present a numerical investigation of the magnetophoresis of metal ions in
porous media under static, nonuniform magnetic fields. The multiphysics
simulations couple momentum transport, mass diffusion, and magnetic field
equations, with the porous medium modeled using two distinct approaches: a
Stokes-based formulation incorporating effective diffusivity, and a
Brinkman-based formulation that explicitly accounts for permeability and
medium-induced drag. Comparison with recent experimental data [Nwachuwku et al.
Submitted, 2025] reveals that the Stokes model partially fails to capture key
trends, while the Brinkman model, with permeability accurately reproduces
observed transport behavior on various porous media. Our simulations predict
that both paramagnetic (MnCl2) and diamagnetic (ZnCl2) ions may form
field-induced clusters under magnetic gradients over a range of concentrations
of 1mM-100mM and magnetic field gradients of up to 100 T2/m. The dominant
driving force is found to be the magnetic gradient (Kelvin) force, while the
paramagnetic force from concentration gradients contributes minimally. In
binary mixtures, hydrodynamic interactions between paramagnetic and diamagnetic
clusters significantly alter transport dynamics. Specifically, paramagnetic
clusters can pull diamagnetic clusters along the magnetic field gradient,
enhancing diamagnetic migration and suppressing the motion of paramagnetic
species. These findings highlight the importance of porous media modeling and
interspecies interactions in predicting magnetophoretic transport of ionic
mixtures.

### Evaluation of Reference Equations of State for Density Prediction in Regasified LNG Mixtures Using High-Precision Experimental Data

- **TL;DR**: 评估AGA8-DC92、GERG-2008和SGERG-88三种状态方程在预测再气化液化天然气混合物密度方面的性能。AGA8-DC92和GERG-2008表现优异，而SGERG-88在低温下偏差显著。

This study evaluates the performance of three reference equations of state
(EoS), AGA8-DC92, GERG-2008, and SGERG-88, in predicting the density of
regasified liquefied natural gas (RLNG) mixtures. A synthetic nine-component
RLNG mixture was gravimetrically prepared. High-precision density measurements
were obtained using a single-sinker magnetic suspension densimeter over a
temperature range of (250 to 350) K and pressures up to 20 MPa. The
experimental data were compared with EoS predictions to evaluate their
accuracy. AGA8-DC92 and GERG-2008 showed excellent agreement with the
experimental data, with deviations within their stated uncertainty. In
contrast, SGERG-88 exhibited significantly larger deviations for this RLNG
mixture, particularly at low temperatures of (250 to 260) K, where
discrepancies reached up to 3 %. Even at 300 K, deviations larger than 0.4 %
were observed at high pressures, within the model's uncertainty, but notably
higher than those of the other two EoSs. The analysis was extended to three
conventional 11-component natural gas mixtures (labeled G420 NG, G431 NG, and
G432 NG), previously studied by our group using the same methodology. While
SGERG-88 showed reduced accuracy for the RLNG mixture, it performed reasonably
well for these three mixtures, despite two of them have a very similar
composition to the RLNG. This discrepancy is attributed to the lower CO2 and N2
content typical in RLNG mixtures, demonstrating the sensitivity of EoS
performance to minor differences in composition. These findings highlight the
importance of selecting appropriate EoS models for accurate density prediction
in RLNG applications.

### Interpretable Artificial Intelligence (AI) Analysis of Strongly Correlated Electrons

- **TL;DR**: 提出基于AI的新工作流程，用于分析二维Hubbard模型的张量网络模拟快照数据集，揭示强关联电子系统中的复杂量子关联

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become an exceptionally powerful tool for
analyzing scientific data. In particular, attention-based architectures have
demonstrated a remarkable capability to capture complex correlations and to
furnish interpretable insights into latent, otherwise inconspicuous patterns.
This progress motivates the application of AI techniques to the analysis of
strongly correlated electrons, which remain notoriously challenging to study
using conventional theoretical approaches. Here, we propose novel AI workflows
for analyzing snapshot datasets from tensor-network simulations of the
two-dimensional (2D) Hubbard model over a broad range of temperature and
doping. The 2D Hubbard model is an archetypal strongly correlated system,
hosting diverse intriguing phenomena including Mott insulators, anomalous
metals, and high-$T_c$ superconductivity. Our AI techniques yield fresh
perspectives on the intricate quantum correlations underpinning these phenomena
and facilitate universal omnimetry for ultracold-atom simulations of the
corresponding strongly correlated systems.

### Dynamics of stochastic oscillator chains with harmonic and FPUT potentials

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种一维随机模型，描述在整数格点上进行连续时间随机游走的相互作用粒子链，粒子被限制在两个固定粒子之间，并受到不同温度浴的影响。

Inspired by recent studies on deterministic oscillator models, we introduce a
stochastic one-dimensional model for a chain of interacting particles. The
model consists of $N$ oscillators performing continuous-time random walks on
the integer lattice $\mathbb{Z}$ with exponentially distributed waiting times.
The oscillators are bound by confining forces to two particles that do not
move, placed at positions $x_0$ and $x_{N+1}$, respectively, and they feel the
presence of baths with given inverse temperatures: $\beta_L$ to the left,
$\beta_B$ in the middle, and $\beta_R$ to the right. Each particle has an index
and interacts with its nearest neighbors in index space through either a
quadratic potential or a Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou type coupling. This local
interaction in index space can give rise to effective long-range interactions
on the spatial lattice, depending on the instantaneous configuration. Particle
hopping rates are governed either by the Metropolis rule or by a modified
version that breaks detailed balance at the interfaces between regions with
different baths.

### Proximity-induced superconductivity and emerging topological phases in altermagnet-based heterostructures

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一个理论框架研究反铁磁-超导体异质结构中的超导邻近效应，发现可以通过引入Rashba自旋轨道耦合层实现奇宇称三重态配对，从而在二维系统中实现弱和强拓扑超导相。

We present a theoretical framework for investigating superconducting
proximity effect in altermagnet (AM)-superconductor (SC) heterostructures. In
general, AMs, characterized by vanishing net magnetization but spin-split
electronic spectra, provide a promising platform for realizing unconventional
magnetic phases. We consider a two-dimensional $d$-wave AM proximity coupled to
a three dimensional ordinary $s$-wave SC. By integrating out the
superconducting degrees of freedom, we derive an effective Hamiltonian that
describes the proximity-induced modifications in the AM layer in the form of a
self-energy. We then derive an effective Green's function to obtain the
proximity-induced pairing amplitudes in the AM layer and classify the induced
pairing amplitudes according to their parity, frequency, and spin. We find the
presence of even-parity singlet and triplet pairing amplitudes in the AM layer.
To achieve the odd-parity triplet components, important to realize topological
superconductivity, we introduce a layer of Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) in
the heterostructure. We analyse the band topology of this proximity-induced
AM-RSOC layer and demonstrate the emergence of both weak and strong topological
superconducting phases with edge-localized modes, characterized by winding
number and Chern number. These findings highlight the role of AM-SC hybrid
setup as a versatile platform for realizing odd-parity triplet pairings and
engineering topological superconductivity in two-dimension.

### Path-integral Monte Carlo estimator for the dipole polarizability of quantum plasma

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种基于路径积分蒙特卡洛的偶极极化率估计器，用于计算长波长极限下相互作用库仑等离子体的光学响应特性。

We present a path-integral Monte Carlo estimator for calculating the dipole
polarizability of interacting Coulomb plasma in the long-wavelength limit,
i.e., the optical region. Unlike the conventional dynamic structure factor in
reciprocal space, our approach is based on the real-space dipole
autocorrelation function and is suited for long wavelengths and small cell
sizes, including finite clusters. The simulation of thermal equilibrium in
imaginary time has exact Coulomb interactions and Boltzmann quantum statistics.
For reference, we demonstrate analytic continuation of the Drude model into the
imaginary time and Matsubara series, showing perfect agreement with our data
within ranges of finite temperatures and densities. Method parameters, such as
the finite time-step and finite-size effects prove only modestly significant.
Our method, here carefully validated against an exactly solvable reference,
remains amenable to more interesting domains in higher-order optical response,
quantum confinements and quantum statistical effects, and applications in
plasmonics, heterogeneous plasmas and nonlinear optics, such as
epsilon-near-zero materials.

### Higher-dimensional Fermiology in bulk moiré metals

- **TL;DR**: 该论文提出了一种在热力学平衡条件下合成高迁移率莫尔材料的新方法，报道了新型层状超晶格材料家族(Sr6TaS8)1+δ(TaS2)8，这些材料具有可调谐的莫尔超晶格结构，能够编码高维超空间晶体的电子特性。

In the past decade, moir\'e materials have revolutionized how we engineer and
control quantum phases of matter. Among incommensurate materials, moir\'e
materials are aperiodic composite crystals whose long-wavelength moir\'e
superlattices enable tunable properties without chemically modifying their
layers. To date, nearly all reports of moir\'e materials have investigated van
der Waals heterostructures assembled far from thermodynamic equilibrium. Here
we introduce a conceptually new approach to synthesizing high-mobility moir\'e
materials in thermodynamic equilibrium. We report a new family of foliated
superlattice materials (Sr$_6$TaS$_8$)$_{1+\delta}$(TaS$_2$)$_8$ that are
exfoliatable van der Waals crystals with atomically incommensurate lattices.
Lattice mismatches between alternating layers generate moir\'e superlattices,
analogous to those of 2D moir\'e heterobilayers, that are coherent throughout
these crystals and are tunable through their synthesis conditions without
altering their chemical composition. High-field quantum oscillation
measurements map the complex Fermiology of these moir\'e metals, which can be
tuned via the moir\'e superlattice structure. We find that the Fermi surface of
the structurally simplest moir\'e metal is comprised of over 40 distinct
cross-sectional areas, the most observed in any material to our knowledge. This
can be naturally understood by postulating that bulk moir\'e materials can
encode electronic properties of higher-dimensional superspace crystals in ways
that parallel well-established crystallographic methods used for incommensurate
lattices. More broadly, our work demonstrates a scalable synthesis approach
potentially capable of producing moir\'e materials for electronics applications
and evidences a novel material design concept for accessing a broad range of
physical phenomena proposed in higher dimensions.

### MRX: A differentiable 3D MHD equilibrium solver without nested flux surfaces

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种新的3D磁流体动力学平衡求解器，基于B、p的可容许变化概念，通过磁弛豫方法将磁场从扰动/非最小能态松弛到更低能态。

This article introduces a new 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibrium
solver, based on the concept of admissible variations of B, p that allows for
magnetic relaxation of a magnetic field in a perturbed/non-minimum energy state
to a lower energy state. We describe the mathematical theory behind this
method, including ensuring certain bounds on the magnetic energy, and the
differential geometry behind transforming to and from a logical domain and
physical domain. Our code is designed to address a number of traditional
challenges to 3D MHD equilibrium solvers, e.g. exactly enforcing physical
constraints such as divergence-free magnetic field, exhibiting high levels of
numerical convergence, dealing with complex geometries, and modeling stochastic
field lines or chaotic behavior. By using differentiable Python, our numerical
method comes with the additional benefits of computational efficiency on modern
computing architectures, high code accessibility, and differentiability at each
step. The proposed magnetic relaxation solver is robustly benchmarked and
tested with standard examples, including solving 2D toroidal equilibria at
high-beta, and a rotating ellipse stellarator. Future work will address the
integration of this code for 3D equilibrium optimization for modeling magnetic
islands and chaos in stellarator fusion devices.

### Natural-Orbital-Based Neural Network Configuration Interaction

- **TL;DR**: 本文评估了使用近似自然轨道替代标准Hartree-Fock轨道来提升神经网络辅助构型相互作用方法的效率，结果表明即使近似自然轨道也能显著减少所需Slater行列式数量。

Selective configuration interaction methods approximate correlated molecular
ground- and excited states by considering only the most relevant Slater
determinants in the expansion. While a recently proposed
neural-network-assisted approach efficiently identifies such determinants, the
procedure typically relies on canonical Hartree-Fock orbitals, which are
optimized only at the mean-field level. Here we assess approximate natural
orbitals - eigenfunctions of the one-particle density matrix computed from
intermediate many-body eigenstates - as an alternative. Across our benchmarks
for H$_2$O, NH$_3$, CO, and C$_3$H$_8$ we see a consistent reduction in the
required determinants for a given accuracy of the computed correlation energy
compared to full configuration interaction calculations. Our results confirm
that even approximate natural orbitals constitute a simple yet powerful
strategy to enhance the efficiency of neural-network-assisted configuration
interaction calculations.

### Enhancing Neural Network Backflow

- **TL;DR**: 该论文提出了一种改进神经网络回流(NNBF)方法的新策略，通过多行列式展开和对称性投影技术，在强关联系统中实现了最先进的变分能量。

Accurately describing the ground state of strongly correlated systems is
essential for understanding their emergent properties. Neural Network Backflow
(NNBF) is a powerful variational ansatz that enhances mean-field wave functions
by introducing configuration-dependent modifications to single-particle
orbitals. Although NNBF is theoretically universal in the limit of large
networks, we find that practical gains saturate with increasing network size.
Instead, significant improvements can be achieved by using a multi-determinant
ansatz. We explore efficient ways to generate these multi-determinant
expansions without increasing the number of variational parameters. In
particular, we study single-step Lanczos and symmetry projection techniques,
benchmarking their performance against diffusion Monte Carlo and NNBF applied
to alternative mean fields. Benchmarking on a doped periodic square Hubbard
model near optimal doping, we find that a Lanczos step, diffusion Monte Carlo,
and projection onto a symmetry sector all give similar improvements achieving
state-of-the-art energies at minimal cost. By further optimizing the projected
symmetrized states directly, we gain significantly in energy. Using this
technique we report the lowest variational energies for this Hamiltonian on
$4\times 16$ and $4 \times 8$ lattices as well as accurate variance
extrapolated energies. We also show the evolution of spin, charge, and pair
correlation functions as the quality of the variational ansatz improves.

### When Normality Tests Detect Equilibrium Distributions of Finite N-Body Systems

- **TL;DR**: 使用粒子数N作为非高斯性的量化指标，研究有限N理想气体的速度分布如何偏离高斯分布，并通过大规模蒙特卡洛模拟评估五种正态性检验方法对有限尺寸效应的检测能力。

The particle number $N$ can be used as a quantitative gauge of
non-Gaussianity. This idea extends to systems that are not literally finite by
assigning them a notional $N $that captures the same deviation. For an ideal
gas with $N$ insufficiently large for the thermodynamic limit, the velocity
distribution that maximises Havrda-Charv\'at entropy departs markedly from the
Maxwell-Boltzmann (Gaussian) form obtained in that limit. We explore how five
standard normality tests-Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Anderson-Darling, Cram\'er-von
Mises, Jarque-Bera and Shapiro-Wilk-respond to samples drawn from this
finite-$N$ equilibrium distribution. A large-scale Monte-Carlo study maps the
tests' statistical power across system size $N$ and sample size $n$, providing
practical reference tables for deciding when finite-size effects remain
detectable.

### Reducing the strain required for ambient-pressure superconductivity in bilayer nickelates

The remarkable discovery of high temperature superconductivity in bulk
bilayer nickelates under high pressure has prompted the conjecture that
epitaxial compressive strain might mimic essential aspects of hydrostatic
pressure. The successful realization of superconductivity in films on SrLaAlO4
(001) (SLAO) supports this correspondence, yet it remains unclear whether the
rich pressure-temperature phase diagram of bilayer nickelates can be
systematically mapped (and studied at ambient pressure) as a function of
epitaxial strain. To this end, experimental access near the elusive edge of the
superconducting phase boundary would provide invaluable insight into the nature
of the superconducting state and the ground state from which it emerges. It
would also offer a benchmark for theoretical models. Here we report
superconducting bilayer nickelates grown on LaAlO3 (001) (LAO), where the
compressive strain required for ambient-pressure superconductivity is nearly
halved to -1.2%. These films exhibit a superconducting onset above 10 K and
reach zero resistance at 3 K, with normal-state transport properties differing
from those of films grown on SLAO. Our results offer a new opportunity to probe
emergent phenomena near the superconducting phase boundary in the
strain-temperature phase diagram of bilayer nickelates.

Semiconductor quantum processors have potential to scale to modular quantum
computers, in which qubit registers are coupled by quantum links, enabling high
connectivity and space for control circuitry. Individual spin-qubit registers
have progressed to two-dimensional systems and execution of small quantum
algorithms. Separately, high-fidelity spin shuttling has been demonstrated in
linear channels defined by individual gate electrodes. Here, we realize the
first shared-control shuttling link integrated between distant qubit registers
to demonstrate quantum entanglement in a basic modular quantum processor based
on hole spin qubits in germanium. We develop a protocol to compensate for
spin-orbit-induced rotations during qubit transfer, allowing for shuttling
between qubit registers separated by more than one micrometer in approximately
a hundred nanoseconds. Combining local qubit operation with coherent shuttling,
we generate Bell states formed by spins residing in separate registers.
Characterizing them using quantum state tomography, we demonstrate entanglement
between spin qubits in distant registers.

Modern materials science generates vast and diverse datasets from both
experiments and computations, yet these multi-source, heterogeneous data often
remain disconnected in isolated "silos". Here, we introduce MaterialsGalaxy, a
comprehensive platform that deeply fuses experimental and theoretical data in
condensed matter physics. Its core innovation is a structure similarity-driven
data fusion mechanism that quantitatively links cross-modal records - spanning
diffraction, crystal growth, computations, and literature - based on their
underlying atomic structures. The platform integrates artificial intelligence
(AI) tools, including large language models (LLMs) for knowledge extraction,
generative models for crystal structure prediction, and machine learning
property predictors, to enhance data interpretation and accelerate materials
discovery. We demonstrate that MaterialsGalaxy effectively integrates these
disparate data sources, uncovering hidden correlations and guiding the design
of novel materials. By bridging the long-standing gap between experiment and
theory, MaterialsGalaxy provides a new paradigm for data-driven materials
research and accelerates the discovery of advanced materials.

The wave operator model provides a framework for modeling wave propagation by
encoding material parameter distributions into matrix-form operators. This
paper extends this framework from lossless to lossy media. We present a
derivation of the wave operator solution for the electric field in dissipative
environments, which can be decomposed into a closed-form propagation term and a
non-closed-form dissipation term. Based on an analysis of the dominant
exponential decay within the propagation term, an attenuation compensation
strategy is proposed to restore the attenuated data to an approximate lossless
state. The performance of this compensation strategy is analyzed and validated
through numerical experiments, establishing the theoretical foundation for
reduced order model (ROM)-based techniques in lossy media.

- **TL;DR**: 本文综述了过去五年中建立的超图上梯度流系统与信息几何之间的联系，将现代非平衡物理原理（如热力学不确定性关系、速度极限等）在超图扰动梯度流系统框架中重新表述。

This article serves to concisely review the link between gradient flow
systems on hypergraphs and information geometry which has been established
within the last five years. Gradient flow systems describe a wealth of physical
phenomena and provide powerful analytical technquies which are based on the
variational energy-dissipation principle. Modern nonequilbrium physics has
complemented this classical principle with thermodynamic uncertaintly
relations, speed limits, entropy production rate decompositions, and many more.
In this article, we formulate these modern principles within the framework of
perturbed gradient flow systems on hypergraphs. In particular, we discuss the
geometry induced by the Bregman divergence, the physical implications of dual
foliations, as well as the corresponding infinitesimal Riemannian geometry for
gradient flow systems. Through the geometrical perspective, we are naturally
led to new concepts such as moduli spaces for perturbed gradient flow systems
and thermodynamical area which is crucial for understanding speed limits. We
hope to encourage the readers working in either of the two fields to further
expand on and foster the interaction between the two fields.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文提出了一种通过自旋1/2间隔物调控自旋1位点间双二次项强度的通用策略，实现了对AKLT态所需非常规相互作用的工程化设计，为自下而上合成量子模拟器提供了蓝图。

Low-dimensional quantum systems host a variety of exotic states, such as
symmetry-protected topological ground states in spin-1 Haldane chains.
Real-world realizations of such states could serve as practical quantum
simulators for quantum phases if the interactions can be controlled. However,
many proposed models, such as the AKLT state, require unconventional forms of
spin interactions beyond standard Heisenberg terms, which do not naturally
emerge from microscopic (Coulomb) interactions. Here, we demonstrate a general
strategy to induce a biquadratic term between two spin-1 sites and to tune its
strength $\beta$ by placing pairs of spin-1/2 spacers in between them. $\beta$
is controlled by the ratio between Heisenberg couplings to and in between the
spacer spins. Increasing this ratio first increases the magnitude of $\beta$
and decreases the correlation length of edge states, but at a critical value of
the ratio, we observe a quantum phase transition between two spin-liquid phases
with hidden antiferromagnetic order. Detailed atomistic calculations reveal
that chains of nanographene flakes with 22 and 13 atoms, respectively, which
could be realized by state-of-the-art bottom-up growth technology, yield
precisely the couplings required to approach the AKLT state. These findings
deliver a blueprint for engineering unconventional interactions in bottom-up
synthesized quantum simulators.

Rydberg excitons in the semiconductor Cu$_2$O have been observed in
absorption experiments up to a principal quantum number of n = 28 at
millikelvin temperatures [1]. Here, we extend the experimental parameter space
by variing both temperature and excitation power. In particular, we show that
the P excitons close to the band gap react more sensitively to an increase of
the excitation power than states of the associated D exciton multiplet, even
though the latter are located at comparatively higher energy. This finding is
similar to the one observed when applying an external electric field,
suggesting that the observed behavior arises from internal electric fields
created by charged impurities that are optically ionized. At laser intensities
below 1 $\mu$W/cm$^2$, absorption lines of excitons with n=29 are observed.

- **TL;DR**: 开发生成式机器学习模型来恢复高扫描速度下获取的噪声EBSD图案，以提高晶体取向确定的准确性

Electron back-scatter diffraction (EBSD) has traditionally relied upon
methods such as the Hough transform and dictionary Indexing to interpret
diffraction patterns and extract crystallographic orientation. However, these
methods encounter significant limitations, particularly when operating at high
scanning speeds, where the exposure time per pattern is decreased beyond the
operating sensitivity of CCD camera. Hence the signal to noise ratio decreases
for the observed pattern which makes the pattern noisy, leading to reduced
indexing accuracy. This research work aims to develop generative machine
learning models for the post-processing or on-the-fly processing of Kikuchi
patterns which are capable of restoring noisy EBSD patterns obtained at high
scan speeds. These restored patterns can be used for the determination of
crystal orientations to provide reliable indexing results. We compare the
performance of such generative models in enhancing the quality of patterns
captured at short exposure times (high scan speeds). An interesting observation
is that the methodology is not data-hungry as typical machine learning methods.

This study investigates into the adsorption sensing capabilities of
single-walled (5,5) boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) towards environmental
pollutant gas molecules, including CH2, SO2, NH3, H2Se, CO2 and CS2. Employing
a linear combination of atomic orbital density functional theory (DFT) and
spin-polarized generalized gradient approximation (GGA), the investigation
reveals the nanotube's robust adsorption behavior without compromising its
structural integrity. Thermodynamic and chemical parameters, such as adsorption
energy, HOMO-LUMO gap, vertical ionization energy, and vertical electron
affinity, highlight the (5,5) BNNTs' potential as efficient absorbents for
pollutant molecules. Infrared spectroscopy confirms the formation of distinct
BNNT-gas complexes. These findings underscore the promising application of BN
nanotubes as absorbents for common gaseous pollutants, essential for developing
sensors to enhance indoor air quality.

### Superdiffusion and anomalous fluctuations in chiral integrable dynamics

Symmetries strongly influence transport properties of quantum many-body
systems, and can lead to deviations from the generic case of diffusion. In this
work, we study the impact of time-reversal symmetry breaking on the transport
and its universal aspects in integrable chiral spin ladders. We observe that
the infinite-temperature spin transport is superdiffusive with a dynamical
critical exponent z = 3/2 matching the one of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ)
universality class, which also lacks the time reversal symmetry. However, we
find that fluctuations of the net magnetization transfer deviate from the KPZ
predictions. Moreover, the full probability distribution of the associated spin
current obeys fluctuation symmetry despite broken time-reversal and
space-reflection symmetries. To further investigate the role of conserved
quantities, we introduce an integrable quantum circuit that shares the
essential symmetries with the chiral ladder, and which exhibits analogous
dynamical behaviour in the absence of energy conservation. Our work shows that
time-reversal symmetry breaking is compatible with superdiffusion, but
insufficient to stabilize the KPZ universality in integrable systems. This
suggests that additional fundamental features are missing in order to identify
the emergence of such dynamics in quantum matter.

### Lattice dynamics in chiral tellurium by linear and circularly polarized Raman spectroscopy: crystal orientation and handedness

Trigonal tellurium (Te) has attracted researchers' attention due to its
transport and optical properties, which include electrical magneto-chiral
anisotropy, spin polarization and bulk photovoltaic effect. It is the
anisotropic and chiral crystal structure of Te that drive these properties, so
the determination of its crystallographic orientation and handedness is key to
their study. Here we explore the structural dynamics of Te bulk crystals by
angle-dependent linearly polarized Raman spectroscopy and symmetry rules in
three different crystallographic orientations. The angle-dependent intensity of
the modes allows us to determine the arrangement of the helical chains and
distinguish between crystallographic planes parallel and perpendicular to the
chain axis. Furthermore, under different configurations of circularly polarized
Raman measurements and crystal orientations, we observe the shift of two phonon
modes only in the (0 0 1) plane. The shift is positive or negative depending on
the handedness of the crystals, which we determine univocally by chemical
etching. Our analysis of three different crystal faces of Te highlights the
importance of selecting the proper orientation and crystallographic plane when
investigating the transport and optical properties of this material. These
results offer insight into the crystal structure and symmetry in other
anisotropic and chiral materials, and open new paths to select a suitable
crystal orientation when fabricating devices.

Tunable Kondo lattice and heavy fermion physics have been recently reported
in moir\'e materials, but most of the studies have focused on the electrical
and magnetic properties. Quantitative thermoelectric measurements, which can
reveal entropic information of the heavy fermions, have yet to be achieved.
Here, we report a comprehensive thermoelectric study on the moir\'e heavy
fermion phase realized in hole-doped angle-aligned MoTe2/WSe2 bilayers. By
electrically gating the material to the Kondo lattice region of the phase
diagram, we observe a sign change in the Seebeck coefficient near the Kondo
coherence temperature, where the heavy fermion phase with an electron-like
Fermi surface evolves into an itinerant Fermi liquid with a hole-like Fermi
surface. We compare the results with the semiclassical Mott relation and
discuss the observed discrepancies. In addition to the thermal dissociation of
Kondo singlets in the heavy Fermi liquid, a sign change accompanied by a strong
peak in the Seebeck coefficient is also observed near a Zeeman breakdown of the
Kondo singlets, signaling an entropy accumulation. Our results provide entropic
information on both the formation and breakdown of heavy fermions in moir\'e
semiconductors.

### Characterizing Skyrmion Flow Phases with Principal Component Analysis

Principal component analysis (PCA) is a powerful method that can identify
patterns in large, complex data sets by constructing low-dimensional order
parameters from higher-dimensional feature vectors. There are increasing
efforts to use space-and-time-dependent PCA to detect transitions in
nonequilibrium systems that are difficult to characterize with equilibrium
methods. Here, we demonstrate that feature vectors incorporating the position
and velocity information of driven skyrmions moving through random disorder
permit PCA to resolve different types of disordered skyrmion motion as a
function of driving force and the ratio of the Magnus force to the dissipation.
Since the Magnus force creates gyroscopic motion and a finite Hall angle,
skyrmions can exhibit a greater range of flow phases than what is observed in
overdamped driven systems with quenched disorder. We show that in addition to
identifying previously known skyrmion flow phases, PCA detects several
additional phases, including different types of channel flow, moving fluids,
and partially ordered states. Guided by the PCA analysis, we further
characterize the disordered flow phases to elucidate the different microscopic
dynamics and show that the changes in the PCA-derived order parameters can be
connected to features in bulk transport measures, including the transverse and
longitudinal velocity-force curves, differential conductivity, topological
defect density, and changes in the skyrmion Hall angle as a function of drive.
We discuss how asymmetric feature vectors can be used to improve the resolution
of the PCA analysis, and how this technique can be extended to find disordered
phases in other nonequilibrium systems with time-dependent dynamics.

Hydrogen embrittlement remains a critical challenge in structural and
electronic applications of copper (Cu) but its mechanism is still not fully
understood. In this study, we combine density functional theory (DFT) and
bond-order potential (BOP) simulations to determine the atomistic pathways for
hydrogen adsorption/incorporation and fast interfacial diffusion at Cu grain
boundaries (GBs), including its interaction with vacancies. Undercoordinated
regions, such as surfaces and GBs, serve as preferential
adsorption/incorporation sites for atomic hydrogen, especially in the presence
of Cu vacancies. The presence of hydrogen in GB further enhances the
segregation of Cu vacancies, leading to the formation of stable
H-$V_\mathrm{Cu}$ complexes with cosegregation energy gains of up to $-0.8$ eV.
Furthermore, our simulations reveal that the migration barriers for hydrogen
within the GB networks are as low as $0.2$ eV and significantly lower than in
bulk Cu ($0.42$ eV). The results presented in this paper suggest an atomistic
mechanism that links $H_2$ exposure to H accumulation in GBs, providing
information on the early stages of hydrogen-induced degradation.

Topological chiral crystals have emerged as a fertile material platform for
investigating optical phenomena derived from the distinctive Fermi surface
Berry curvature and orbital magnetic moment textures around multifold chiral
band crossings pinned at the time-reversal invariant momenta. In this work, by
means of tight-binding model and first principles based calculations, we
investigate metallic electro-optic (EO) responses stemming from the Berry
curvature and orbital magnetic moment of Bloch electrons across 37 materials
belonging to space group 198 (SG198). Previously thought to vanish in SG198,
our findings reveal a nonzero Berry curvature dipole attributed to the
energetic misalignment between topologically charged point nodes of opposite
chirality. Moreover, we find that the recently predicted magnetoelectric EO
effects, which arise from the interplay between the Berry curvature and
magnetic moment on the Fermi surface, are readily accessible in BeAu under
experimentally feasible electric biases.

Tin-based halide perovskites have emerged as promising lead-free alternatives
for optoelectronic applications, yet their structural stability and phase
behavior at finite temperatures remain challenging to predict. Here, we assess
the predictive capabilities of the foundational machine learning model
MACE-MP-0 - trained on a broad chemical space and applied without
system-specific fine-tuning - for the temperature-dependent behavior of CsSnBr3
and Cs2SnBr6. Molecular Dynamics simulations in the NpT ensemble were performed
from 100 K to 500 K, and thermodynamic and structural descriptors including
enthalpy, specific heat, radial distribution functions, translational order,
bond angle distributions, and vibrational spectra were analyzed. Our results
show that CsSnBr3 undergoes a low-temperature orthorhombic-to-cubic phase
transition, evidenced by both the evolution of lattice parameters and subtle
anomalies in enthalpy and specific heat, although the experimentally observed
intermediate tetragonal phase is not captured. In contrast, Cs2SnBr6 remains
cubic and maintains a more rigid octahedral framework across the entire
temperature range. Overall, MACE-MP-0 qualitatively reproduces key thermal and
structural features of these materials, highlighting its usefulness as a first
step for studying new materials. For cases where capturing more subtle phase
behavior is required, system-specific fine-tuning with Density Functional
Theory data should be considered.

We present a first--principles density functional theory (DFT) study of
transition metal (TM = Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) functionalized two--dimensional
polyaramid (2DPA) to explore their structural, electronic, and magnetic
properties. Mechanical parameters, such as bulk modulus, shear modulus, Young's
modulus, Poisson's ratio, and Pugh ratio, together with phonon dispersion,
confirm the mechanical and dynamic stability of all doped systems. Electronic
structure analysis shows strong binding of Co, Cr, Fe, Ni, and Ti with
formation energies between --1.15 eV and --2.96 eV, while Mn binds more weakly
(--0.67 eV). TM doping introduces new electronic states that reduce the band
gap, with Fe-doped 2DPA exhibiting the lowest value of 0.26 eV. The systems
display predominantly ferromagnetic ordering, with magnetic moments of 1.14
{\mu}B (Co), 3.57 {\mu}B (Cr), 2.26 {\mu}B (Fe), 4.19 {\mu}B (Mn), and 1.62
{\mu}B (Ti). These results demonstrate that TM--doped 2DPA possesses tunable
magnetic and electronic characteristics, highlighting its potential for
spintronic applications.

We analyze the non-linear generalized Langevin equation which contains a
thermodynamic force. We show that even for systems in thermal equilibrium the
presence of the thermodynamic force implies that the auto-correlation function
of the fluctuating force becomes non-stationary. We further illustrate that a
standard coarse-graining procedure that neglects this fact predicts
waiting-time distributions incompatible with the original, microscopic process.
We conclude that one needs to proceed with care when adding thermodynamic
driving forces to the Langevin equation.

We have theoretically investigated the magnetic properties of the
quasi-two-dimensional organic conductor $\lambda$-(BETS)$_2$GaCl$_4$ using a
multi-band Hubbard model and the two-particle self-consistent method. We have
employed a four-band model, where each BETS molecule is considered as a site,
and a two-band model, treating each BETS dimer as a site. Our results for the
temperature dependence of the Stoner factor reveal a kink around
$T_\mathrm{kink} \approx 5 \mathrm{meV}$, indicating a change in the dominant
magnetic fluctuations. Above $T_\mathrm{kink}$, it shows a broad structure
indicating smeared antiferromagnetic (AFM) fluctuations, while below
$T_\mathrm{kink}$, the spin susceptibility peaks at a wavevector corresponding
to spin-density-wave (SDW)-like fluctuations. As the intra-dimer transfer
integral increases, the kink disappears, and the AFM fluctuations are enhanced.
Our findings are consistent with experimental observations, which also report a
change in magnetic properties from AFM to SDW-like fluctuations upon cooling.

Chiral molecules are known to preferentially select electrons with a
particular spin state, an effect termed chirality-induced spin selectivity
(CISS). In this work, the transient CISS dynamics in a chiral molecule are
investigated through time-dependent quantum-transport simulations, an important
step toward further understanding CISS and its application in devices such as
magnetoresistive random access memories and spin-based quantum computers. We
show that a nonzero spin polarization throughout the chiral molecule can be
attributed to a spin-dependent group velocity of electrons. Contrary to the
case where a chiral molecule is connected to a single lead, this spin
polarization persists into the steady state when two leads are connected. We
show that the simulated spin polarization qualitatively agrees with a reference
experiment, as evidenced by the distinct magnetic-field signatures calculated
from the spin polarization within a monolayer of chiral molecules.

- **TL;DR**: 通过氩离子辐照在六方氮化硼(h-BN)中引入可控空位缺陷，使其成为高效锂离子导体，同时保持电绝缘性，显著提升锂金属负极稳定性，实现无枝晶循环和抑制多硫化物穿梭效应。

The practical implementation of lithium-metal anodes has been hindered by
uncontrollable dendrite formation and interfacial instability. This study
presents a defect-engineering approach of a chemically stable and electrically
insulating interfacial layer of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) that markedly
enhances ionic conductivity through argon ion irradiation. Initially, the
electrochemical performance from commercially available, large-area chemical
vapor deposition (CVD)-grown h-BN films with industrial-scale argon ion
implantation motivated our subsequent detailed investigations using lab-scale
exfoliated single-crystal h-BN flakes. Integration of these exfoliated flakes
into a hybrid microfluidic-microelectronic chip provided direct evidence that
controlled vacancy defects transform h-BN into an efficient lithium-ion
conductor while preserving its intrinsic electrical insulation. Experimental
validation confirmed improved lithium-metal anode stability, achieving
dendrite-free cycling with Li plating/stripping Coulombic efficiencies
exceeding 99.5% about 1000 cycles. Further assemble of irradiated h-BN in
lithium-sulfur batteries effectively mitigates the polysulfide shuttle effect,
sustaining over 97% specific capacity around 300 cycles. These results
establish a robust, scalable interface-engineering route for next-generation
lithium-metal batteries that combine high ionic transport with excellent
electrical insulation.

This research provides a framework for describing the averaged modulus of the
velocity reached by an accelerated self-propelled Brownian particle diffusing
in a thermal fluid and constrained to a harmonic external potential. The system
is immersed in a thermal bath of harmonic oscillators at a constant
temperature, where its constituents also interact with the external field. The
dynamics is investigated for a sphere and a disk, and is split into two
stochastic processes. The first describes the gross-grained inner
time-dependent self-velocity generated from a set of independent
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes without the influence of the external field. This
internal mechanism provides the initial velocity for the particle to diffuse in
the fluid, which is implemented in a modified generalized Langevin equation as
the second process. We find that the system exhibits spontaneous fluctuations
in the diffusive velocity modulus due to the inner mechanism; however, as
expected, the momentary diffusive velocity fluctuations fade out at large
times. The internal propelled velocity module in spherical coordinates is
derived, as well as the simulation of the different modules for both the sphere
and the already known equations for a disk in polar coordinates.

### Absence of Parity Anomaly in Massive Dirac Fermions on a Lattice

- **TL;DR**: 该论文重新审视了二维空间中的Dirac费米子的宇称反常问题，发现在晶格正则化下，单个有质量Dirac锥不会产生半量子化的霍尔电导，而是产生整数量子化的霍尔电导。半量子化霍尔电导仅出现在无质量Dirac锥的情况下。

The parity anomaly for Dirac fermions in two spatial dimensions has shaped
perspectives in quantum field theory and condensed matter physics. In condensed
matter it has evolved as a mechanism for half-quantized Hall responses in
systems described by massive Dirac fermions. Here we reexamine the issue on a
lattice and show that the half-quantized Hall conductivity is absent for
massive Dirac fermions when lattice regularization is properly implemented and
the translational invariant symmetry is taken into account. We realize that a
single massive Dirac cone on a lattice always leads to an integer quantized
Hall conductivity and to the half-quantized Hall conductivity only in the
unphysical limit of infinite momentum cut-off. The half-quantized Hall
conductivity appears with nonzero longitudinal conductance as a signature of a
single massless Dirac cone on a lattice. Consequently, the parity anomaly is a
property of massless Dirac fermions in a semimetal/metal, not of massive Dirac
fermions in an insulator on a lattice.

### Theoretical Investigation of Anomalous Hall and Nernst Responses in Potassium Tri Vanadium Pentantimonide

We present a theoretical study of the anomalous Nernst and Hall conductance
in the Kagome metal potassium tri vanadium pentantimonide, based on a system
Hamiltonian incorporating nearest neighbour and complex next nearest neighbour
hopping, Rashba spin orbit coupling, an exchange field induced by magnetic
proximity, and a charge density wave potential. Our analysis reveals that the
Nernst conductivity exhibits a non monotonic temperature dependence. It
increases with temperature, reaches a pronounced peak, and subsequently
declines at higher temperatures due to thermal broadening, which diminishes the
influence of Berry curvature. Notably, small shifts in the chemical potential
can lead to dramatic changes in the Nernst signal enhancing its magnitude or
even reversing its sign highlighting the system sensitivity to carrier density.
We further explore the anomalous Hall behaviour within this framework. The band
structure hosts multiple bands with nonzero Berry curvature, and preliminary
Chern number calculations suggest weak topological features, namely, while not
fully quantized, the system exhibits significant Berry curvature accumulation.
Upon introducing momentum space winding, implemented via a momentum dependent
phase in the complex hopping terms to mimic orbital magnetic flux, we observe
that two bands acquire opposite Chern numbers. The remaining bands remain
topologically trivial.

### Crossover between intrinsic and temperature-assisted regimes in spin-orbit torque switching of antiferromagnetic order

- **TL;DR**: 通过调节Mn3Sn磁性层厚度，观察到从焦耳加热主导到自旋轨道力矩主导的开关行为转变，实现了无显著热效应的超快反铁磁存储开关。

Intensive studies have been made on antiferromagnets as candidate materials
for next generation memory bits due to their ultrafast dynamics reaching
picosecond time scales. Recent demonstrations of electrical bidirectional
switching of antiferromagnetic states have attracted significant attention.
However, under the presence of significant Joule heating that destabilizes the
magnetic order, the timescales associated with the switching can be limited to
nanoseconds or longer. Here, we present the observation of a crossover in the
switching behavior of the chiral antiferromagnet Mn3Sn by tuning the magnetic
layer thickness. While Joule heating interferes with switching in thicker
devices, we find clear signatures of an intrinsic spin-orbit torque mechanism
as the thickness is reduced, avoiding the heating effect. The suppression of
heating enables switching without significant attenuation of the readout signal
using pulses shorter than those required by temperature-assisted mechanisms.
The crossover into the spin-orbit torque switching behavior clarifies the
potential for achieving ultrafast switching as expected from the picosecond
spin dynamics of antiferromagnets. Our results lay the groundwork for designing
antiferromagnetic memory devices that can operate at ultrafast timescales.

### Ground states of a family of frustrated spin models for quasicrystals and their approximants

Many new families of quasicrystal-forming magnetic alloys have been
synthesized and studied in recent years. For small changes of composition, the
alloys can go from quasiperiodic to periodic (approximant crystals) while
conserving most of the local atomic environments. Experiments show that many of
the periodic approximants order at low temperatures, with clear signatures of
ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic transitions, and also in some cases undergo
non-equilibrium spin glass transitions. In contrast, the quasicrystals are
mostly found to be spin glasses. Systematically studying these alloys could
help elucidate the role played by quasiperiodicity in (de)stabilizing long
range magnetic order. In this work, we study cluster spin models with the aim
of understanding the mechanisms behind various types of long range magnetic
ordering in approximants and quasicrystals. These models embody key features of
real systems, and to some extent are analytically tractable, both for periodic
and quasiperiodic cases. For the quasicrystal, we describe two novel magnetic
phases with quasiperiodic ordering. Our results should serve to motivate
further studies with detailed numerical explorations of this family of models.

### Single femtosecond laser pulse-driven ferromagnetic switching

- **TL;DR**: 本文报道了在铁磁体中通过单激光脉冲实现确定性磁化翻转，突破了传统认为铁磁体难以实现光学切换的限制，为光自旋电子学在存储技术中的应用开辟了新途径。

Light pulses offer a faster, more energy-efficient, and direct route to
magnetic bit writing, pointing toward a hybrid memory and computing paradigm
based on photon transmission and spin retention. Yet progress remains hindered,
as deterministic, single-pulse optical toggle switching has so far been
achieved only with ferrimagnetic materials, which require too specific a
rare-earth composition and temperature conditions for technological use. In
mainstream ferromagnet--central to spintronic memory and storage--such bistable
switching is considered fundamentally difficult, as laser-induced heating does
not inherently break time-reversal symmetry. Here, we report coherent
magnetization switching in ferromagnets, driven by thermal anisotropy torque
with single laser pulses. The toggle switching behavior is robust over a broad
range of pulse durations, from femtoseconds to picoseconds, a prerequisite for
practical applications. Furthermore, the phenomenon exhibits reproducibility in
CoFeB/MgO-based magnetic tunnel junctions with a high magnetoresistance
exceeding 110%, as well as the scalability down to nanoscales with remarkable
energy efficiency (17 fJ per 100-nm-sized bit). These results mark a notable
step toward integrating opto-spintronics into next-generation memory and
storage technologies.

Rutile germanium dioxide (r-GeO2) has recently emerged as a promising
ultrawide-bandgap (UWBG) semiconductor owing to its wide bandgap (~4.4-5.1 eV),
ambipolar doping potential, and high theoretical thermal conductivity. However,
experimental data on the thermal conductivity of r-GeO2 epitaxial layers have
not been reported, primarily due to challenges in phase control and surface
roughness. Here, we report a high thermal conductivity of 52.9 +/- 6.6 W m^-1
K^-1 for high-quality (002) r-GeO2 films grown by metal-organic chemical vapor
deposition (MOCVD) and characterized using time-domain thermoreflectance
(TDTR). The phase control was achieved through a seed-driven stepwise
crystallization (SDSC) approach, and the surface roughness was significantly
reduced from 76 nm to 16 nm (locally as low as 1 A) via chemical mechanical
polishing (CMP). These results highlight the promise of r-GeO2 as a UWBG oxide
platform for power electronics applications.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究通过反铁磁共振技术研究了GdFe3(BO3)4中的自旋重取向转变，发现该转变具有一级相变特征，并识别出与长周期非公度态相关的新AFMR模式。

The multiferroic ferroborate GdFe$_3$(BO$_3$)$_4$ with huntite-type structure
exhibits magnetic ordering below T$_N$ = 38 K and contains two magnetic
subsystems associated with Gd and Fe ions. Competing anisotropies of these
subsystems drive a spin reorientation transition at T$_{SR}$ = 10.7 K,
switching the ground state from easy-axis to easy-plane. Using
antiferromagnetic resonance, we investigate the spin dynamics across this
transition. The observed incomplete softening of a magnon mode during both
field- and temperature-induced spin-reorientation transitions indicates the
first-order nature of the phase transition, which is accompanied by a
discontinuous jump in the effective anisotropy field. We reproduce this
behavior using a simple model that attributes the jump in the anisotropy field
to the presence of an effective fourth-order anisotropy constant, responsible
for the discontinuous character of the transition. Remarkably, for in-plane
magnetic fields, we identify a new AFMR mode that persists from 12 K up to
T$_N$. This mode likely corresponds to the dynamics of a long period
incommensurate state, previously detected by resonant elastic X-ray scattering.

Mechanical systems are pivotal in quantum technologies because of their long
coherent time and versatile coupling to qubit systems. So far, the coherent and
dynamic control of gigahertz-frequency mechanical modes mostly relies on
optomechanical coupling and piezoelectric coupling to superconducting qubits.
Here, we demonstrate on-chip cavity electro-acoustic dynamics using our
microwave-frequency electrically-modulated phononic-crystal (PnC) resonators on
lithium niobate (LN). Leveraging the high dispersion of PnC, our phononic modes
space unevenly in the frequency spectrum, emulating atomic energy levels.
Atomic-like transitions between different phononic modes are achieved by
applying electrical fields to modulate phononic modes via nonlinear
piezoelectricity of LN. Among two modes, we demonstrate Autler-Townes splitting
(ATS), alternating current (a.c.) Stark shift, and Rabi oscillation with a
maximum cooperativity of 4.18. Extending to three modes, we achieve
non-reciprocal frequency conversions with an isolation up to 20 dB.
Nonreciprocity can be tuned by the time delay between the two modulating
pulses. Our cavity electro-acoustic platform could find broad applications in
sensing, microwave signal processing, phononic computing, and quantum
acoustics.

The excitonic insulator (EI) is a more than 60-year-old theoretical proposal
that yet remains elusive. It is a purely quantum phenomenon involving the
spontaneous generation of excitons in quantum mechanics and the spontaneous
condensation of excitons in quantum statistics. At this point, the excitons
represent the ground state rather than the conventional excited state. Thus,
the scarcity of candidate materials is a key factor contributing to the lack of
recognized EI to date. In this review, we begin with the birth of EI,
presenting the current state of the field and the main challenges it faces. We
then focus on recent advances in the discovery and design of EIs based on the
first-principles Bethe-Salpeter scheme, in particular the dark-exciton rule
guided screening of materials. It not only opens up new avenues for realizing
excitonic instability in direct-gap and wide-gap semiconductors, but also leads
to the discovery of novel quantum states of matter such as half-EIs and
spin-triplet EIs. Finally, we will look ahead to possible research pathways
leading to the first recognized EI, both computationally and theoretically.

Multiorbital Hubbard models with Hund coupling and crystal-field splitting
exhibit an instability toward spin-triplet excitonic order in the parameter
regime characterized by strong local spin fluctuations. Upon chemical doping,
two distinct types of excitonic ferromagnetism have been reported. Using
steady-state nonequilibrium dynamical mean-field theory, we demonstrate that
photo-doped half-filled systems can host nonthermal counterparts of these
excitonic phases and exhibit a rich phase diagram in the space of photo-doping
and crystal field splitting. Photo-doping a spin-triplet excitonic insulator
provides a route towards nonequilibrium control of magnetic order.

A polycrystalline solid is modelled as an ensemble of random irregular
polyhedra filling the entire space occupied by the solid body, leaving no voids
or flaws between them. Adjacent grains can slide with a relative velocity
proportional to the local shear stress resolved in the plane common to the two
sliding grains, provided it exceeds a threshold. The local forces associated to
the continuous grain shape accommodation for preserving matter continuity are
assumed much weaker. The model can be solved analytically and for overcritical
conditions gives two regimes of deformation, plastic and superplastic. The
plastic regime, from yield to fracture, is dealt with. Applications to nickel
superalloys and stainless steels give impressive agreement with experiment.
Most work of the last century relies on postulating pre--existent cracks and
voids to explain plastic deformation and fracture. The present model gives much
better results.

Single crystals of $R$Rh$_6$Ge$_4$ ($R$ = Pr, Nd, Sm, Gd - Er) were
synthesized using a Bi flux and their physical properties were characterized by
magnetization, resistivity, and specific heat measurements. These compounds
crystallize in the noncentrosymmetric LiCo$_6$P$_4$-type structure (space group
$P\bar{6}m2$), where rare-earth atoms form a triangular lattice in the
$ab$-plane and chains along the $c$-axis. PrRh$_6$Ge$_4$ and ErRh$_6$Ge$_4$ do
not exhibit magnetic transitions above 0.4 K. NdRh$_6$Ge$_4$ and SmRh$_6$Ge$_4$
are ferromagnets, while GdRh$_6$Ge$_4$ and DyRh$_6$Ge$_4$ show
antiferromagnetic transitions, \red{whereas HoRh$_6$Ge$_4$ is a ferrimagnet}.
In addition, DyRh$_6$Ge$_4$ shows multiple transitions and magnetization
plateaus when a magnetic field is applied along the $c$-axis. In
SmRh$_6$Ge$_4$, like the Ce counterpart, the crystalline-electric field (CEF)
effect leads to an easy plane anisotropy, while in other compounds it gives
rise to a pronounced uniaxial anisotropy.

Palladium hydride is a model system for studying metal-hydrogen interactions.
Yet, its bulk electronic structure has proven difficult to directly probe, with
most studies to date limited to surface-sensitive photoelectron spectroscopy
approaches. This work reports the first in-situ ambient-pressure hard X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (AP-HAXPES) study of hydrogen incorporation in Pd
thin films, providing direct access to bulk chemical and electronic information
at elevated hydrogen pressures. Structural characterisation by in-situ X-ray
diffraction and neutron reflectometry under comparable conditions establishes a
direct correlation between hydrogen loading, lattice expansion, and electronic
modifications. Comparison with density functional theory (DFT) reveals how
hydrogen stoichiometry and site occupancy govern the density of occupied states
near the Fermi level. These results resolve long-standing questions regarding
PdH and establish AP-HAXPES as a powerful tool for probing the bulk electronic
structure of metal hydrides under realistic conditions.

Metal-ion batteries (MIBs) are essential for transitioning to a cleaner and

we have investigated the hexagonal (h) monolayer of BeS and BeTe as electrode
materials for alkali (Li and Na) MIBs. The structural and thermodynamic
stability, adsorption of Li/Na atoms, density of states, diffusion, and
migration of atoms, as well as capacity, are systematically investigated. The
structures of h-BeS and h-BeTe remain stable upon the adsorption of adatoms,
resulting in improved electronic conductivity of these monolayers. The climbing
image-nudged elastic band calculations estimate a low diffusion barrier of 0.16
eV (0.01 eV) for Li (Na) in h-BeS and 0.20 eV (0.16 eV) for Li (Na) in h-BeTe.
Additionally, a maximum storage capacity of 580 mAh g-1 for Li and 1305 mAh g-1
for Na in h-BeS, as well as 174 mAh g-1 for h-BeTe, is estimated for both metal

- **TL;DR**: 本研究通过第一性原理计算和非平衡格林函数方法，研究了金属-硅界面的热输运，发现电子-声子界面热导在不同金属/硅界面中作用不同：Au/Si界面主要由声子-声子过程主导，而Al/Si界面中电子-声子过程贡献了总热导的三分之一。

With the increasing miniaturization of electronic components and the need to
optimize thermal management, it has become essential to understand heat
transport at metal/semiconductor interfaces. While it has been recognized
decades ago that an electron phonon channel may take place at
metal-semiconductor interfaces, its existence is still controversial. Here, we
investigate thermal transport at metal-silicon interfaces using the combination
of first principles calculations and nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF). We
explain how to correct NEGF formalism to account for the out of equilibrium
nature of the energy carriers in the vicinity of the interface. The relative
corrections to the equilibrium distribution are shown to arise from the
spectral mean free paths of silicon and may reach 15 percents. Applying these
corrections, we compare the predictions of NEGF to available experimental data
for Au/Si, Pt/Si and Al/Si interfaces. Based on this comparison, we infer the
value of the electron phonon interfacial thermal conductance by employing the
two temperature model. We find that interfacial thermal transport at Au/Si
interfaces is mainly driven by phonon phonon processes, and that electron
phonon processes play a negligible role in this case. By contrast, for Al/Si
interfaces, we show that phonon-phonon scattering alone can not explain the
experimental values reported so far, and we estimate that the electron-phonon
interfacial conductance accounts for one third of the total conductance. This
work demonstrates the importance of the electron-phonon conductance at
metal-silicon interfaces and calls for systematic experimental investigation of
thermal transport at these interfaces at low temperatures. It paves the way for
an accurate model to predict the conductance associated to the interfacial
electron phonon channel.

Metal-ion batteries are in huge demand to cope with the increasing need for
renewable energy, especially in automobiles. In this work, we apply
first-principle calculations to examine two-dimensional beryllium carbide
(2D-Be2C) as a possible anode material for metal-ion (Na and K) batteries.
2D-Be2C is a semiconductor and becomes metallic by adsorbing metal ions.
Negative adsorption energy indicates stable adsorption on the monolayer of
Be2C. Alkali metal diffusion barrier and optimum path for minimum energy are
studied within the framework of the climbing image nudged elastic band method.
Here, six intermediate images are considered between the initial and final
states. The lowest diffusion barriers for a single adsorbed Na and K atom are
0.016 and 0.026 eV, respectively. A maximum open circuit voltage of around 1 V
is computed for K ions, whereas 0.5 V is for Na ions. Also, the maximum storage
capacity of the Be2C monolayer is estimated at 1785 Ah/kg.

- **TL;DR**: 研究了NiTi超弹性管材在不同外径D和壁厚t下的相变模式，通过拉伸和弯曲实验发现相变模式具有系统性尺寸依赖性，并用梯度增强模型分析了不同尺寸管材的相变模式差异。

The dependence of transformation pattern in superelastic NiTi tubes on tube
outer diameter D and wall-thickness t is investigated through quasi-static
uniaxial tension and large-rotation bending experiments. The evolution of
outer-surface strain fields is synchronized with global stress-strain and
moment-curvature responses using a multi-magnification, high-resolution stereo
digital image correlation system at 0.5-2x magnifications. The transformation
patterns exhibit systematic size-dependent behaviors. Under tension and for a
specific D, as the diameter-to-thickness ratio D/t decreases, a decreasing
number of fat/diffuse helical bands emerge, in contrast to sharp/slim bands in
thin tubes. Consequently, the austenite-martensite front morphology transitions
from finely-fingered to coarsely-fingered with decreasing D/t. Below a
characteristic D/t, front morphology no longer exhibits patterning and phase
transformation proceeds via propagation of a finger-less front. Moreover, the
transformation pattern exhibits an interrelation between D and D/t, where a
front possessing diffuse fingers is observed in a thin but small tube. Under
bending, both the global moment-curvature response and transformation pattern
exhibit D- and D/t-dependence. While wedge-like martensite domains consistently
form across all tube sizes, their growth is noticeably limited in smaller and
thicker tubes due to geometrical constraints. A gradient-enhanced model of
superelasticity is employed to analyze the distinct transformation patterns
observed in tubes of various dimensions. The size-dependent behavior is
explained based on the competition between bulk and interfacial energies, and
the energetic cost of accommodating martensite fingers. By leveraging an
axisymmetric tube configuration as a reference energy state, the extra energy
associated with the formation of fingers is quantified.

Quasi-one-dimensional (Q-1D) van der Waals chalcohalides have emerged as
promising materials for advanced energy applications, combining tunable
optoelectronic properties and composed by earth-abundant and non-toxic
elements. However, their widespread application remains hindered by challenges
such as anisotropic crystal growth, composition control and lack of knowledge
on optoelectronic properties. A deeper understanding of the intrinsic
limitations of these materials, as well as viable defect mitigation strategies
like the engineering of solid solutions, is critical. This work presents a
low-temperature synthesis route based on molecular ink deposition enabling
direct crystallization of tunable Bi(SzSe1-z)(IxBr1-x) solid solutions without
need for binary chalcogenide precursors. This approach yields phase-pure films
with precise control over morphology, composition, and crystallographic
orientation. XRD analysis and DFT calculations confirm the formation of
homogeneous solid solutions, while optoelectronic measurements reveal the
distinct roles of halogen and chalcogen anions in tuning bandgap energy and
carrier type, with Se shifting downwards the conduction band. The versatility
of this synthesis technique enables morphology control ranging from compact
films to rod-shaped microcrystals, expanding the functional adaptability of
these materials. These findings offer a foundational framework for defect
engineering and the scalable integration of chalcohalides in next-generation
energy technologies, including photovoltaics, photocatalysis, thermoelectrics,
and chemical sensing.

Perovskite materials are at the forefront of modern materials science due to
their exceptional structural, electronic, and optical properties. The
controlled fabrication of perovskite nanostructures is crucial for enhancing
their performance, stability, and scalability, directly impacting their
applications in next-generation devices such as solar cells, LEDs, and sensors.
Here, we present a novel, ligand-free approach to synthesize perovskite
nanocrystals (NCs) with average sizes up to 100 nm, using femtosecond pulsed
laser ablation (PLA) in ambient air without additional liquid media. We
demonstrate this method for both organic-inorganic (methylamino lead) hybrid
perovskites (MAPbX3, X = Cl, Br, I) and fully inorganic lead-free double
perovskites (Cs2AgBiX6, X = Cl, Br), achieving high-purity NCs without
stabilizing ligands - a critical advancement over conventional chemical
synthesis methods. By tailoring laser parameters, we systematically elucidate
the influence of perovskite composition (halide type, organic vs. inorganic
cation, single versus double perovskite structure) on the ablation process and
the resulting nanocrystal properties. Transmission electron microscopy and
X-ray diffraction confirm the preservation of crystallinity, with MAPbX3
forming larger (approximately 90 nm) cubic NCs and Cs2AgBiX6 forming smaller
(approximately 10 nm) rounded NCs. Photoluminescence spectroscopy reveals
pronounced size-dependent blue shifts (17-40 nm) due to quantum confinement,
particularly for Br and I containing perovskites. This clean, scalable, and
versatile PLA approach not only provides direct access to high-purity,
ligand-free perovskite NCs with tunable optical properties but also represents
a significant advance in the fabrication of nanostructures, enabling the
exploration of new perovskite-based optoelectronic and quantum devices.

- **TL;DR**: 开发一种通过全场观测准确识别复杂材料本构行为的方法，将本构关系推断问题表述为受平衡定律约束的间接逆问题，并扩展到包含接触的动态压痕问题。

We continue the development of a method to accurately and efficiently
identify the constitutive behavior of complex materials through full-field
observations that we started in Akerson, Rajan and Bhattacharya (2024). We
formulate the problem of inferring constitutive relations from experiments as
an indirect inverse problem that is constrained by the balance laws.
Specifically, we seek to find a constitutive behavior that minimizes the
difference between the experimental observation and the corresponding
quantities computed with the model, while enforcing the balance laws. We
formulate the forward problem as a boundary value problem corresponding to the
experiment, and compute the sensitivity of the objective with respect to the
model using the adjoint method. In this paper, we extend the approach to
include contact and study dynamic indentation. Contact is a nonholonomic
constraint, and we introduce a Lagrange multiplier and a slack variable to
address it. We demonstrate the method on synthetic data before applying it to
experimental observations on rolled homogeneous armor steel and a
polycrystalline aluminum alloy.

Dislocations in a thick ammonothermal GaN substrate were investigated using
synchrotron-radiation X-ray topography (SR-XRT) under six-beam diffraction
conditions. The high brilliance of the synchrotron source enabled the
observation of the super-Borrmann effect, which markedly enhanced the anomalous
transmission of X-rays through the 350~$\mu$m-thick crystal. Systematic
variation of the deviation angle~$\Delta\omega$ revealed a clear transition
from kinematical to dynamical diffraction, consistent with theoretical
predictions based on dynamical diffraction theory. By selectively exciting five
equivalent two-beam diffraction conditions near the six-beam configuration, the
Burgers vectors of individual threading edge dislocations (TEDs) were
determined according to the $g\cdot b$ invisibility criterion. The measured
dislocation image widths agreed well with calculated values derived from the
extinction distance and $|g\cdot b|$ dependence, confirming that most
dislocations possess Burgers vectors containing an $a$-type component of
$\frac{1}{3}\langle 11\bar{2}0\rangle$ or $\frac{2}{3}\langle
11\bar{2}0\rangle$. These results demonstrate that SR-XRT under multibeam
diffraction provides a powerful, nondestructive method for quantitative
dislocation analysis in thick GaN crystals, offering valuable insights into
defect structures critical for high-performance GaN-based electronic devices.

- **TL;DR**: NdSbxTe2-x材料中Sb含量变化导致磁阻的非单调演化，当Sb含量减少时出现高达99.9%的强负磁阻效应。

Magnetic topological semimetals LnSbTe (Ln = lanthanide elements) provide a
platform to study the interplay of structure, magnetism, topology, and electron
correlations. Varying Sb and Te compositions in LnSbxTe2-x can effectively
control the electronic, magnetic, and transport properties. Here, we report the
evolution of transport properties with Sb and Te contents in NdSbxTe2-x, (0 &lt; x
&lt; 1). Our work reveals nonmonotonic evolution in magnetoresistance with varying
composition stoichiometry. Specifically, reducing Sb content x leads to strong
negative magnetoresistance up to 99.9%. Such a strong magnetoresistance, which
is likely attributed to the interplay between structure, magnetism, and
electronic bands, establishes this material as a promising platform for
investigating topological semimetal for future device applications.
