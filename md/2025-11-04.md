- **TL;DR**: 提出了一个结合有限元分析和基于代理建模的框架，用于评估功能性梯度骨支架的生物力学和再生潜力，发现轴向孔隙梯度促进骨长入，径向梯度增强结构强度。

Critical sized bone defects remain a major clinical challenge, requiring
scaffolds that combine mechanical stability with regenerative capacity.
Functionally graded (FG) scaffolds, inspired by the graded architecture of
native bone, offer a promising solution by spatially varying porosity to
optimise both load transfer and tissue ingrowth. Here, we present an integrated
finite element agent based modelling (FEA ABM) framework to simultaneously
evaluate the biomechanics and regenerative potential of FG scaffolds under
physiologically relevant conditions. Cylindrical scaffolds with axial or radial
pore size gradients were compared with uniform controls. The finite element
model incorporated poroelastic tissue mechanics and gait related loading to
compute local shear strain and fluid velocity, which guided cellular behaviours
in the agent based model, including progenitor migration, proliferation,
differentiation, and apoptosis. Simulations over 150 days revealed that axial
gradients with larger pores at the host bone interface promoted greater bone
ingrowth, while radial gradients with denser peripheral struts substantially
reduced peak von Mises stresses. These findings highlight a fundamental design
trade off between maximising regenerative performance and enhancing structural
competence. The coupled FEA ABM framework establishes a mechanistic platform
for the rational design of next-generation FG scaffolds, offering a pathway
toward preclinical optimisation of implants tailored to defect location and
loading environment.

### Approximate Approach to Compute Characteristics of Inhomogeneous TASEP with Open Boundaries

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一个计算具有开放边界的一维非对称简单排斥过程中不同类型粒子流率和密度的近似方法，并扩展到连续时间过程。

A discrete-time totally asymmetric simple exclusion process on a lattice with
open boundaries is considered. There are particles of different types. The type
of a particle is characterized by the probability that a particle moves to a
vacant site and the probability that a particle occupying the rightmost site
departs the system. An approximate approach to compute the particle flow rate
and density in sites is proposed. A version of the approach is proposed for an
analogous continuous-time process. The accuracy of the approximation is
estimated. The approach can be used in traffic models and models of statistical
physics.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种混合精度的光子多重网格求解器，将计算密集的平滑过程卸载到光学域，在光子加速器上求解偏微分方程，可减少80%以上的数字操作。

Solving partial differential equations is crucial to analysing and predicting
complex, large-scale physical systems but pushes conventional high-performance
computers to their limits. Application specific photonic processors are an
exciting computing paradigm for building efficient, ultrafast hardware
accelerators. Here, we investigate the synergy between multigrid based partial
differential equations solvers and low latency photonic matrix vector
multipliers. We propose a mixed-precision photonic multigrid solver, that
offloads the computationally demanding smoothening procedure to the optical
domain. We test our approach on an integrated photonic accelerator operating at
2 GSPS solving a Poisson and Schr\"odinger equation. By offloading the
smoothening operation to the photonic system, we can reduce the digital
operation by more than 80%. Finally, we show that the photonic multigrid solver
potentially reduces digital operations by up to 97 % in lattice quantum
chromodynamics (LQCD) calculations, enabling an order-of-magnitude gain in
computational speed and efficiency.

### Generating Arrow of Time from Three-Particle System with Classical Mechanics

- **Title (EN)**: Generating Arrow of Time from Three-Particle System with Classical Mechanics
- **Authors**: Shuhei Kobayashi
- **Categories**: cond-mat.stat-mech
- **TL;DR**: 通过分析一维三粒子弹性碰撞系统，研究时间箭头的力学起源，发现能量交换遵循指数弛豫定律，即使基础运动方程具有时间反演对称性。

This study investigates the mechanical origin of the arrow of time by
analyzing a one-dimensional three-particle system with elastic collisions. By
mapping the system to a contact between finite heat baths through a thermal
wall, we show that the energy exchange follows an exponential relaxation law,
even though the underlying equations of motion are time-reversal symmetric. The
loss of time-reversal symmetry emerges from the coarse-graining of dynamical
variables, specifically the omission of velocity signs in energy
representation. This result suggests that the arrow of time originates from
information reduction in the transition from microscopic to macroscopic
descriptions.

### BzScope: an absolute cross section calculator for neutron-phonon scattering

- **Title (EN)**: BzScope: an absolute cross section calculator for neutron-phonon scattering
- **Authors**: Ming Tang, Zi-Yi Pan, Ni Yang, Xiao-Xiao Cai
- **Categories**: physics.comp-ph
- **TL;DR**: BzScope是一个用于高效计算晶体粉末中中子-声子非弹性散射绝对截面的Python软件包，改进了传统直方图方法在重现尖锐结构和确保收敛方面的局限性。

BzScope is a Python package designed for efficiently calculating absolute
cross sections of neutron-phonon inelastic scattering for crystalline powders
in large phase spaces, addressing the limitations of traditional histogramming
techniques in reproducing sharp structures and ensuring convergence. The
package employs an adapted integral method and supports calculations of single-
and two-phonon scattering functions in ideal crystalline powders, with
numerical robustness up to a momentum transfer of 100 Ang^-1. Higher order
scatterings up to several hundred orders are calculated by incoherent
approximation in a well-established thermal neutron scattering physics package,
NCrystal. In addition, a NCrystal plugin is made available for NCrystal-enabled
Monte Carlo packages, facilitating direct comparison between the new physics
and experimental data.
  Validation against NCrystal demonstrates good agreement in incoherent
scattering for cubic systems Ni. In addition, it shows improved accuracy for
low-symmetry materials $NiP_2$ by avoiding the isotropic atomic displacement
approximations in NCrystal. Benchmarks the experimental differential cross
section of LiH and total cross section of Be confirm its reliability.
  BzScope integrates with NCrystal via a plugin and therefore can be directly
used in any NCrystal-enabled Monte Carlo package. This tool enhances the
efficiency and accuracy of neutron scattering simulations, advancing the study
of condensed matter dynamics.

### Chimeric states of matter: Meissner effect without superconductivity

- **Authors**: Michael J Landry, Mingda Li
- **Categories**: cond-mat.supr-con, cond-mat.mtrl-sci, hep-lat, hep-th, quant-ph
- **TL;DR**: 该论文提出了'嵌合态'物质概念，其中对称性破缺和未破缺的特征共存于同一介质中，挑战了传统相分类。

Symmetry is central to how we classify phases of matter: solids break spatial
translations, superfluids break particle-number conservation, and
superconductors "break" gauge symmetry. Mixed anomalies involving higher-form
symmetries, however, present a generalization of spontaneous symmetry breaking
that admits a wider and more versatile set of possibilities. We introduce
chimeric states of matter, in which aspects of broken and unbroken phases
coexist. We find that the Meissner effect -- usually regarded as the defining
hallmark of superconductivity -- can occur in media that are resistive or even
insulating when probed by electric fields. We demonstrate this by constructing
an effective field theory of "symmetry chimerization" and propose that
Josephson junction networks could provide a laboratory realization. These
results broaden the landscape of possible phases of matter, showing that
physical media can mix features of symmetry-restored and symmetry-broken states
in a single substrate.

### A fast and rigorous numerical tool to measure length-scale artifacts in molecular simulations

- **TL;DR**: 该论文提出了一个数值算法来计算统计力学模拟中的质量因子，该因子基于Bogoliubov不等式，用于量化给定模拟盒子尺寸的统计力学一致性程度。

The two-sided Bogoliubov inequality for classical and quantum many-body
systems is a theorem that provides rigorous bounds on the free-energy cost of
partitioning a given system into two or more independent subsystems. This
theorem motivates the definition of a quality factor which directly quantifies
the degree of statistical-mechanical consistency achieved by a given simulation
box size. A major technical merit of the theorem is that, for systems with
two-body interactions and a known radial distribution function, the quality
factor can be computed by evaluating just two six-dimensional integrals. In
this work, we present a numerical algorithm for computing the quality factor
and demonstrate its consistency with respect to results in the literature
obtained from simulations performed at different box sizes.

### Cu-spin Correlation in the Electron-overdoped High-Tc Cuprate Thin Films of La_2-x_Ce_x_CuO_4_ Probed by Low-energy Muons

- **TL;DR**: 研究了电子掺杂铜酸盐La_2-x_Ce_x_CuO_4在过掺杂区域的Cu自旋关联，发现与空穴掺杂铜酸盐不同，即使在超导被抑制时Cu自旋关联仍然存在。

We investigated the Cu-spin correlation in the overdoped regime of the
electron-doped high-Tc cuprate thin films of La_2-x_Ce_x_CuO_4_, changing the
reduction condition from muon spin relaxation using low-energy muons. The
Cu-spin correlation developed at low temperatures for optimally reduced films
with x=0.13 as well as x=0.17 where the superconductivity was almost
suppressed. These results are contrary to those observed in the hole-doped
high-Tc cuprates where the development of the antiferromagnetic Cu-spin
correlation disappears together with the suppression of superconductivity. The
Cu-spin correlation developed at low temperatures in x=0.17 may be understood
in terms of antiferromagnetism, but it may be related to a ferromagnetic order
recently suggested in the nonsuperconducting heavily overdoped
La$_2-x_Ce_x_CuO_4_ with x~0.18.

### Generative Modeling Enables Molecular Structure Retrieval from Coulomb Explosion Imaging

- **TL;DR**: 使用基于扩散的Transformer神经网络从离子动量分布中重建分子几何结构，平均绝对误差低于1玻尔半径（约为典型化学键长度的一半）。

Capturing the structural changes that molecules undergo during chemical
reactions in real space and time is a long-standing dream and an essential
prerequisite for understanding and ultimately controlling femtochemistry. A key
approach to tackle this challenging task is Coulomb explosion imaging, which
benefited decisively from recently emerging high-repetition-rate X-ray
free-electron laser sources. With this technique, information on the molecular
structure is inferred from the momentum distributions of the ions produced by
the rapid Coulomb explosion of molecules. Retrieving molecular structures from
these distributions poses a highly non-linear inverse problem that remains
unsolved for molecules consisting of more than a few atoms. Here, we address
this challenge using a diffusion-based Transformer neural network. We show that
the network reconstructs unknown molecular geometries from ion-momentum
distributions with a mean absolute error below one Bohr radius, which is half
the length of a typical chemical bond.

### I. Magnetic, thermal and transport properties of YbCu$_{5-x}$Zn$_x$ alloys

- **TL;DR**: 研究了YbCu5-xZnx合金的结构、磁性和输运性质，发现随着Zn含量增加，Yb离子从Yb3+向Yb2+转变，系统表现出非费米液体行为，接近量子临界点。

Within the family of cubic YbCu$_4$X compounds ($X$ = Ni, Au and Zn), we have
investigated the YbCu$_{5-x}$Zn$_x$ ($1\geq x \geq 0.7$) alloys by means of
structural, magnetic, thermal and transport measurements. In the $\tau 1-$
YbCu$_{5-x}$Zn$_x$ (cubic AuBe$_5$ type, $0.7 \leq x \leq 1.5$) structural
phase, Yb ion is in its Yb$^{3+}$ magnetic configuration. However, by
increasing Zn content the unit cell grows faster than a reference computed as a
Cu by Zn atoms substitution, which indicates a shift of Yb ions towards the
larger Yb$^{2+}$ configuration. The magnetic behavior confirms such tendency
with a clear decrease of the saturation magnetization and effective moment
between $x=0.7$ and $x=1$. The specific heat at low temperature shows a
logarithmic dependence characteristic for a non-fermi-liquid behavior. The
characteristic energies of all studied parameters, including magneto
resistivity, show notably low values as an indication that these alloys are
close to a quantum critical point, which is approached from the non-magnetic
side as the Zn content decreases.

### Visualizing interaction-driven restructuring of quantum Hall edge states

- **TL;DR**: 利用扫描隧道显微镜直接观测石墨烯中量子霍尔边缘态，揭示了电子关联作用如何在不同尺度上重塑边缘通道的结构和性质。

Many topological phases host gapless boundary modes that can be dramatically
modified by electronic interactions. Even for the long-studied edge modes of
quantum Hall phases, forming at the boundaries of two-dimensional (2D) electron
systems, the nature of such interaction-induced changes has been elusive.
Despite advances made using local probes, key experimental challenges persist:
the lack of direct information about the internal structure of edge states on
microscopic scales, and complications from edge disorder. Here, we use scanning
tunneling microscopy (STM) to image pristine electrostatically defined quantum
Hall edge states in graphene with high spatial resolution and demonstrate how
correlations dictate the structures of edge channels on both magnetic and
atomic length scales. For integer quantum Hall states in the zeroth Landau
level, we show that interactions renormalize the edge velocity, dictate the
spatial profile for copropagating modes, and induce unexpected edge valley
polarization that differ from those of the bulk. While some of our findings can
be understood by mean-field theory, others show breakdown of this picture,
highlighting the roles of edge fluctuations and inter-channel couplings. We
also extend our measurements to spatially resolve the edge state of fractional
quantum Hall phases and detect spectroscopic signatures of interactions in this
chiral Luttinger liquid. Our study establishes STM as a promising tool for
exploring edge physics of the rapidly expanding 2D topological phases,
including newly realized fractional Chern insulators.

### Constructing a bifunctional platform based on Mn2+-doped Mg2Y8(SiO4)6O2 phosphors for multi-parameter optical thermometry and manometry

- **TL;DR**: 合成了Mn2+掺杂的Mg2Y8(SiO4)6O2荧光粉，该材料在408nm激发下产生强烈的橙色Mn2+发射，具有优异的热稳定性和压力敏感性，可用于光学测温和高灵敏度压力传感。

Series of the Mn2+-doped Mg2Y8(SiO4)6O2 phosphors were synthesized. Upon
excitation at 408 nm, these phosphors exhibited intense orange emission
originating from Mn2+, with concentration quenching observed beyond x = 0.07,
and they also demonstrated excellent thermal stability. For optical
thermometry, two independent parameters, emission band centroid ({\lambda}) and
lifetime, were employed as thermal indicators, yielding sensitivities of
d{\lambda}/dT = 0.053 nm K-1 and SR = 0.86% K-1, respectively. High-pressure
in-situ X-ray diffraction revealed that the phosphors retained structural
integrity under compression, accompanied by a progressive lattice contraction.
With increasing pressure (0.13-10.89 GPa), a spectral red-shift was observed,
corresponding to a pressure sensitivity of d{\lambda}/dp = 4.75 nm GPa-1.
Additionally, pressure-dependent shifts in color coordinates allowed the
development of a colorimetric manometric response, achieving a relative
sensitivity of 3.27% GPa-1. Remarkably, the pressure-induced spectral shift of
Mn2+ emission, characterized by low thermal cross-sensitivity, enabled a highly
reliable ratiometric manometric strategy, with a relative sensitivity of 72%
GPa-1. Notably, the system delivered the highest TIMF reported to date above 3
GPa, peaking at 1940 K GPa-1 at 7 GPa. These results position Mn2+-doped
Mg2Y8(SiO4)6O2 phosphors as a highly promising bifunctional material for
next-generation, multi-parameter optical sensing applications under extreme
conditions.

### The hybrid exact scheme for the simulation of first-passage times of jump-diffusions with time-dependent thresholds

- **TL;DR**: 将精确模拟方法从恒定阈值扩展到时间依赖阈值，应用于跳跃扩散过程，并进行算法结构和计算效率的比较分析。

The first-passage time is a key concept in stochastic modeling, representing
the time at which a process first reaches a specified threshold. In this work,
we consider a jump-diffusion (JD) model with a time-dependent threshold,
providing a more flexible framework for describing stochastic dynamics. We are
interested in the Exact simulation method developed for JD processes with
constant thresholds, where the Exact method for pure diffusion is applied
between jump intervals. An adaptation of this method to time-dependent
thresholds has recently been proposed for a more general stochastic setting. We
show that this adaptation can be applied to JD models by establishing a formal
correspondence between the two frameworks. A comparative analysis is then
performed between the proposed approach and the constant-threshold version in
terms of algorithmic structure and computational efficiency. Finally, we show
the applicability of the method by predicting neuronal spike times in a JD
model driven by two independent Poisson jump mechanisms.

### Simulation of Self-Assembled Monolayers of Polyalanine $α$-Helix Using an Effective Potential

Self-assembled monolayers of $\alpha$-polyalanine helices exhibit distinct
structural phases with implications for chiral-induced spin selectivity. We
combine scanning tunneling microscopy and theoretical modeling to reveal how
chiral composition governs supramolecular organization. Enantiopure systems
form hexagonal lattices, while racemic mixtures organize into rectangular
phases with stripe-like features. Our SCC-DFTB derived interaction potentials
show that opposite-handed helix pairs exhibit stronger binding and closer
packing, explaining the denser racemic structures. Crucially, we demonstrate
that the observed STM contrast arises from anti-parallel alignment of
opposite-handed helices rather than physical height variations. These findings
establish fundamental structure-property relationships for designing
peptide-based spintronic materials.

The emergence of two-dimensional (2D) superconductivity in bulk transition
metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) is a fascinating area of research, as their weak
interlayer coupling leads to novel superconducting behavior and offers a rich
platform to host nontrivial gap structures and interactions with other
electronic orders. In this work, we present a comprehensive study of the
superconducting properties of bulk single-crystalline
$1T$-Ti$_{1-x}$Ta$_x$Se$_2$ for x = 0.2. Our results confirm the weakly coupled
anisotropic superconductivity. Angle-dependent upper critical field
measurements and observation of a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition
confirm the quasi-2D nature of the superconducting state. These results
position $1T$-Ti$_{1-x}$Ta$_x$Se$_2$ as a promising platform for exploring
low-dimensional superconducting physics and highlight bulk TMD crystals as a
promising platform for realizing intrinsic 2D superconductivity, opening
avenues for future quantum applications.

Potential Energy Surfaces (PESs) are an indispensable tool to investigate,
characterise and understand chemical and biological systems in the gas and
condensed phases. Advances in Machine Learning (ML) methodologies have led to
the development of Machine Learned Potential Energy Surfaces (ML-PES) which are
now widely used to simulate such systems. The present work provides an overview
of concepts, methodologies and recommendations for constructing and using
ML-PESs. The choice of topics is focused on practical and recurrent issues to
conceive and use such model. Application of the principles discussed are
illustrated through two different systems of biomolecular importance: the
non-reactive dynamics of the Alanine-Lysine-Alanine tripeptide in gas and
solution phases, and double proton transfer reactions in DNA base pairs.

### Low-Frequency Noise and Resistive Switching in $β$-Na$_{0.33}$V$_2$O$_5$

The interplay between charge ordering and its manifestation in macroscopic
electrical transport in low-dimensional materials is crucial for understanding
resistive switching mechanisms. In this study, we investigate the electronic
transport and switching behavior of single-crystalline
$\beta$-Na$_{0.33}$V$_2$O$_5$, focusing on low-frequency resistance noise
dynamics of charge-order-driven resistive switching. Using electrical
transport, low frequency noise spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction, we probe
electron dynamics across the Na-ion-ordering (IO) and charge-ordering (CO)
transitions. Near room temperature, the weak temperature dependence of the
noise spectral density points to a dominance of nearest-neighbor polaron
hopping. Below IO transition temperature (\( T_{IO} \sim 240 \, \text{K} \)),
structural analysis reveals that Na-ions adopt a zig-zag occupancy pattern,
breaking the two-fold rotational symmetry and influencing the electronic ground
state. Subsequently, a sharp drop in resistance noise below the CO transition
temperature (\( T_{CO} \sim 125 \, \text{K} \)) indicates the emergence of
correlated electron behavior. Furthermore, application of sufficient electric
field leads to the destabilization of the CO state, and a transition to a
high-conducting state. The material exhibits distinct resistive switching
between 35~K and 110~K, with a resistance change spanning two orders of
magnitude, primarily driven by electronic mechanisms rather than Joule heating.
These findings provide new insights into charge-order-induced switching and
electronic correlations in quasi-one-dimensional systems, with potential
applications in cryogenic memory and neuromorphic computing devices owing to
the low noise levels in their stable resistive states.

We develop a theory of drag in graphene double layers near charge neutrality.
We work in the regime of electron hydrodynamics and account for interlayer
correlations of charge puddle disorder. The drag resistivity is expressed in
terms of the viscosity, intrinsic conductivity of the electron liquid, and the
correlation function of the puddle disorder. The contributions of the
interlayer transfer of momentum and energy to drag have opposite signs. This
leads to a nonmonotonic dependence of the drag resistivity on the carrier
density. For layer-symmetric doping, the drag resistivity changes sign as a
function of the carrier density. At interlayer separations shorter than the
disorder correlation length, the transconductivity saturates to the
disorder-induced enhancement of the intralayer conductivity. We provide
quantitative estimates of the effect for Dirac electron liquids in monolayer
graphene and bilayer graphene double-layer devices.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文提出了一个基于预训练深度神经网络的化学信息迁移学习框架，用于预测分子调节剂对钙钛矿太阳能电池性能的影响，并通过虚拟筛选和实验验证获得了26.91%的冠军效率。

The discovery of effective molecular modulators is essential for advancing
perovskite solar cells (PSCs), but the research process is hindered by the
vastness of chemical space and the time-consuming and expensive trial-and-error
experimental screening. Concurrently, machine learning (ML) offers significant
potential for accelerating materials discovery. However, applying ML to PSCs
remains a major challenge due to data scarcity and limitations of traditional
quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) models. Here, we apply a
chemical informed transfer learning framework based on pre-trained deep neural
networks, which achieves high accuracy in predicting the molecular modulator's
effect on the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs. This framework is
established through systematical benchmarking of diverse molecular
representations, enabling lowcost and high-throughput virtual screening over
79,043 commercially available molecules. Furthermore, we leverage
interpretability techniques to visualize the learned chemical representation
and experimentally characterize the resulting modulator-perovskite
interactions. The top molecular modulators identified by the framework are
subsequently validated experimentally, delivering a remarkably improved
champion PCE of 26.91% in PSCs.

Perovskite materials, known for their structural versatility and
multifunctional properties, continue to draw interest for advanced electronic
and optoelectronic applications. In this study, we investigate the elastic and
strain--engineered mechanical, electronic properties and optical properties of
the orthorhombic La2AlGaO6 (LAGO) hybrid perovskite using first--principles
quantum mechanical calculations based on density functional theory (DFT).
Structural optimizations were performed using both the local density
approximation (LDA) and the generalized gradient approximation (GGA). The
mechanical stability of LAGO was confirmed through the Born--Huang criteria,
and key elastic constants (C11, C12, C33, C44, and C66) were evaluated. These
constants were further used to derive mechanical parameters such as Young's
modulus, bulk modulus, shear modulus, Poisson's ratio, Cauchy's pressure, and
anisotropic factor, offering insights into the material's ductility, hardness,
and elastic anisotropy. Crucially, we explored the influence of biaxial strain
on the electronic band structure, DOS/PDOS, and Fermi energy, revealing
significant band gap modulation under compressive and tensile strain, and
hence, varying the optical properties. The coupling between elastic response
and electronic structure highlights LAGO's potential for tunable device
applications, where mechanical stimuli can be employed to tailor its electronic
functionality.

### Conventional and practical metallic superconductivity arising from repulsive Coulomb coupling

- **TL;DR**: 论文质疑传统s波超导在3D金属中的可行性，指出基于BCS-Migdal-Eliashberg框架的理论会荒谬地预测所有金属都有~100K的高Tc，但实际上只有Kohn-Luttinger预测的非s波超导存在，但Tc极低不可观测。

A concrete question is discussed: Can there be conventional $s$-wave
superconductivity in regular 3D metals, i.e., electrons in a jellium
background, interacting via the standard Coulomb coupling? We are interested in
'practical' superconductivity that can in principle be observed in experiments,
so the $T=0$ ground state being superconducting is not of interest, or for that
matter a $T_c$ which is exponentially small and therefore 'impractical' is also
not of interest in the current work. We find that almost any theory based on
the BCS-Migdal-Eliashberg paradigm, with some form of screened Coulomb coupling
replacing the electron-phonon coupling in the BCS or Eliashberg theory, would
uncritically predict absurdly high $T_c\sim100$ K in all metals (including the
alkali metals, which are well-described by the jellium model) arising from the
unavoidable fact that the Fermi, plasmon, and Coulomb potential energy scales
are all $&gt;10^4$ K. Therefore, we conclude, based on reduction ad absurdum, that
the violation of the venerable Migdal theorem in this problem is sufficiently
disruptive that no significance can be attached to numerous existing
theoretical publications in the literature claiming plasmon-induced (or other
similar Coulomb coupling-induced) practical SC. Using a careful analysis of the
Eliashberg gap equations we find that the superconducting $T_c$ of the 3D
electron gas can be reduced below the $\sim1$ K range depending on choices of
frequency and momentum cut-off parameters that are introduced to satisfy
Migdall's theorem but are apriori unknown. The only believable result is the
one discovered sixty years ago by Kohn and Luttinger predicting non-$s$-wave SC
arising from Friedel oscillations with exponentially (and unobservably) low
$T_c$. We provide several theoretical approaches using both BCS and Eliashberg
theories and different screening models to make our point.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了MS-iQCC方法，一种量子启发算法，可在经典硬件上高效运行，用于预测分子的基态和激发态电子结构。

We introduce the multistate iterative qubit coupled cluster (MS-iQCC) method,
a quantum-inspired algorithm that runs efficiently on classical hardware and is
designed to predict both ground and excited electronic states of molecules.
Accurate excited-state energetics are essential for interpreting spectroscopy
and chemical reactivity, but standard electronic structure methods are either
too computationally expensive for larger systems or lose reliability in the
presence of strong electron correlation. MS-iQCC addresses this challenge by
simultaneously optimizing multiple electronic states in a single,
state-averaged procedure that treats ground and excited states on equal
footing. This removes the energetic bias that is introduced when excited states
are computed one at a time and constrained to remain orthogonal to previously
optimized states. The approach supports multireference electronic structure by
allowing multideterminantal initial guesses and by adaptively building a
compact exponential ansatz from a pool of qubit excitation generators. We apply
MS-iQCC to H$_4$, H$_2$O, N$_2$, and C$_2$, including strongly correlated
geometries, and observe robust convergence of all targeted state energies to
chemically meaningful accuracy across their potential energy surfaces.

### Absence of magnetic order and magnetic fluctuations in RuO$_{2}$

- **TL;DR**: 通过核四极共振测量证明RuO2不具有静态或动态磁矩，因此不具备交变磁性特征

A novel magnetic class blending ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism, termed
altermagnetism, has gained significant attention for its staggered order in
coordinate and momentum spaces, time-reversal symmetry-breaking phenomena, and
promising applications in spintronics. Ruthenium dioxide (RuO$_{2}$) has been
considered a candidate material for altermagnetism, yet the presence of
magnetic moments on Ru atoms remains a subject of debate. In this study, we
systematically investigated the magnetic properties of RuO$_{2}$ powder using
nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) measurements. The NQR spectra show that
there is no internal magnetic field. Furthermore, the temperature independence
of spin-lattice relaxation rate, $1/T_1T$, proves that there are no magnetic
fluctuations. Our results unambiguously demonstrate that Ru atoms in RuO$_{2}$
possess neither static magnetic moments nor fluctuating magnetic moments, and
thus RuO$_{2}$ does not possess the magnetic characteristics essential for
altermagnetism.

### Quasiperiodicity-induced bulk localization with self similarity in non-Hermitian lattices

We analyze the localization behavior in a non-Hermitian lattice subject to a
quasiperiodic onsite potential. We characterize localization transitions using
multiple quantitative indicators, including inverse participation ratio (IPR),
eigenstate fractal dimension (EFD), extended eigenstate ratio (EER), and
spectral survival ratio. Despite the breaking of self-dual symmetry due to
non-Hermiticity, our results reveal the existence of a critical potential
strength, with its value increasing linearly with the nearest-neighbor
antisymmetric hopping term. On the other hand, the inclusion of longer-range
hopping not only enriches the topological properties but also gives rise to
novel localization phenomena. In particular, it induces the emergence of
mobility edges, as evidenced by both IPR and EFD, along with distinct features
in the spectrum fractal dimension, which we extract using the box-counting
method applied to the complex energy spectrum. Additionally, we uncover
self-similar structures in various quantities, such as EER and complex
eigenvalue ratio, as the potential strength varies. These findings highlight
important aspects of localization and fractal phenomena in non-Hermitian
quasiperiodic systems.

Interfaces govern the unique mechanical response of amorphous multilayers.
Here, we examine nanoindentation hardness and deformation behaviour of
amorphous-amorphous Ta$_2$O$_5$/SiO$_2$ nanolaminates with bilayer thicknesses
ranging from 2 nm to 334 nm. Whilst monolithic SiO$_2$ exhibits catastrophic
failure through a single dominant shear band, multilayer architectures
demonstrate varied deformation mechanisms. Hardness decreases with reduced
bilayer thickness, from 7.7 GPa at 334 nm to 5.5 GPa at 2 nm spacing,
contrasting with crystalline systems, which strengthen with decreasing spacing.
Cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy reveals that fine bilayer
spacings promote closely spaced vertical shear bands with bilayer compression,
while coarser spacings show fewer, widely spaced shear bands with chemical
intermixing. Scanning electron diffraction mapping demonstrates significant
densification beneath indents. The high interface density facilitates strain
accommodation that prevents catastrophic failure typical of brittle amorphous
materials.

### Exploring the limit of the Lattice-Bisognano-Wichmann form describing the Entanglement Hamiltonian: A quantum Monte Carlo study

The entanglement Hamiltonian (EH) encapsulates the essential entanglement
properties of a quantum many-body system and serves as a powerful theoretical
construct. From the EH, one can extract a variety of entanglement quantities,
such as entanglement entropies, negativity, and the entanglement spectrum.
However, its general analytical form remains largely unknown. While the
Bisognano-Wichmann theorem gives an exact EH form for Lorentz-invariant field
theories, its validity on lattice systems is limited, especially when Lorentz
invariance is absent. In this work, we propose a general scheme based on the
lattice-Bisognano-Wichmann (LBW) ansatz and multi-replica-trick quantum Monte
Carlo methods to numerically reconstruct the entanglement Hamiltonian in
two-dimensional systems and systematically explore its applicability to systems
without translational invariance, going beyond the original scope of the
primordial Bisognano-Wichmann theorem. Various quantum phases--including gapped
and gapless phases, critical points, and phases with either discrete or
continuous symmetry breaking--are investigated, demonstrating the versatility
of our method in reconstructing entanglement Hamiltonians. Furthermore, we find
that when the entanglement boundary of a system is ordinary (i.e., free from
surface anomalies), the LBW ansatz provides an accurate approximation well
beyond Lorentz-invariant cases. Our work thus establishes a general framework
for investigating the analytical structure of entanglement in complex quantum
many-body systems.

### Diode effect in a skyrmion-coupled high-temperature Josephson junction

- **TL;DR**: 平面约瑟夫森结与d波超导区域结合，在斯格明子晶体下方产生可门控调节的超导二极管效应，具有高工作温度和可调谐性。

We show that a planar Josephson junction having $d$-wave superconducting
regions, with a skyrmion crystal placed underneath, produces a robust
gate-tunable superconducting diode effect. The spatially-varying exchange field
of the skyrmion crystal breaks both inversion and time-reversal symmetries,
leading to an asymmetric current-phase relation with an anomalous phase shift.
Our theoretical calculations, obtained using resistively and capacitively
shunted junction model combined with Bogoliubov-de Gennes method, reveal that
the diode efficiency is largely tunable by controlling external gate voltage
and skyrmion radius. Incorporation of a $d$-wave superconductor such as
high-$T_c$ Cuprate enables the diode to function at higher operating
temperatures. Our results establish a unique and practically-realizable
mechanism for devising tunable field-free superconducting diodes based on
magnetic texture-superconductor hybrid platforms.

In this paper the exact solution and correlation functions for a double-chain
Ising model with multi-spin interactions and symmetric Hamiltonian density are
obtained. The study employs the transfer matrix method to derive fundamental
thermodynamic characteristics of the system. The main results include exact
expressions for the partition function, free energy, internal energy, specific
heat capacity, magnetization, susceptibility, and entropy in a strip of finite
length and in the thermodynamic limit. The work provides explicit formulas for
the eigenvalues and shows structure of eigenvectors of the transfer matrix. The
expression for magnetization in the thermodynamic limit using components of
normalized eigenvector corresponding to the maximum eigenvalue is obtained. A
detailed analysis is conducted for a special case of interactions involving all
kinds of two- and four-spin interactions. This gives the simplified formula for
free energy, it is calculated using the root of quadratic equation. The
research reveals properties of the system, including specific features of
ground states and phase diagram characteristics. Particular attention is given
to the behavior of physical quantities near frustration points and the
investigation of spin correlation functions. Plots of physical characteristics,
including inverse correlation length, illustrating the obtained results are
constructed.

The present manuscript revisits one of the earliest approaches to treating
molecular systems within the Schr\"odinger formalism of quantum mechanics: the
Heitler-London (HL) model. Originally proposed in 1927 and based on a linear
combination of atomic orbitals, the HL model provided a foundational
description of covalent bonds and has served as the basis for numerous
variational methods. Focusing on the hydrogen molecule, we begin by revisiting
the analytical calculations of the original HL model, from which the
qualitative physics of bonding and antibonding states can be obtained.
Subsequently, we propose including electronic screening effects directly in the
original HL wave function. We then compare our proposal with variational
quantum Monte Carlo (VQMC) calculations, whose trial wave function allows us to
optimize the electronic screening potential as a function of the inter-proton
distance. We obtain the bond length, binding energy, and vibrational frequency
of the H$_2$ molecule. Beyond revisiting this foundational approach in quantum
mechanics, our proposal can serve as improved input for constructing new, but
still analytically simple, variational wave functions to describe dissociation
or bond formation.

The electronic properties of two-dimensional (2D) metals are altered by
changes in their three-dimensional dielectric environment. In this Letter we
propose that superconductivity can be induced in a 2D metal by resonant
coupling between its plasmonic collective modes and optical phonons in a nearby
polar dielectric. Specifically, we predict that relatively high-temperature
superconductivity can be induced in bilayer graphene twisted to an angle
somewhat larger than the magic value by surrounding it with a THz polar
dielectric. Our conclusions are based on numerical solutions of Eliashberg
equations for massless Dirac fermions with tunable Fermi velocities and Fermi
energies, and can be understood qualitatively in terms of a generalized
McMillan formula.

Spin-torque vortex oscillators (STVOs) have been shown to exhibit rich and
complex dynamical regimes, which are strongly dependent on the polarizer's
configuration. Here, we give an overview of the dynamics in an STVO comprising
two vortex free layers, where each layer serves as a dynamic polarizer for the
other, increasing the number of degrees of freedom and therefore, the
complexity of the system. The dynamics are studied through extensive
micromagnetic simulations, performed using our own implementation of the
coupled equations of motion, implemented in the open-source micromagnetics code
Mumax3. We explore the roles of relative vortex configurations and layer
asymmetry on the current-driven dynamics, and find several complex regimes,
including self-modulated gyration, the emergence of C-state dynamics, as well
as chaotic transitions between regular gyration and this C-state.

We investigate the air-induced degradation of few-layer hafnium diselenide
(HfSe$_2$) through combined experimental and theoretical approaches. AFM and
SEM reveal the formation of selenium-rich spherical features upon ambient
exposure, while EDS confirms Se segregation. \textit{Ab initio} molecular
dynamics simulations show that Se atoms migrate to flake edges and that O/O$_2$
exposure leads to selective Hf oxidation, breaking Se--Hf bonds and expelling
Se atoms. No stable Se--O bonds are observed, indicating structural
reorganization rather than oxidation. These findings emphasize the material's
instability in air and the importance of encapsulation for preserving HfSe$_2$
in practical applications. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy confirms the
semiconducting character of the nanoparticles, with an electronic bandgap
compatible with that of elemental Se. These results highlight the critical role
of lattice defects and oxidation dynamics in the degradation process and
underscore the need for encapsulation strategies to preserve the integrity of
HfSe$_2$-based devices.

High-temperature superconductors (high-Tc SCs) host a rich landscape of
electronic phases encompassing the pseudogap, strange metal, superconducting,
antiferromagnetic insulating, and Fermi-liquid regimes. The superconducting
phase is notable for non-dissipative electronic functionality at relatively
high temperatures. These phases are commonly probed in thermodynamic phase
space by varying temperature or current through the sample. They can also be
probed by breaking time-reversal symmetry (TRS) with an external magnetic
field, which yields transition signatures distinct from those arising solely
from temperature or current tuning. Here we show that electron transport in
Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ is primarily governed by two-dimensional
superconductivity consistent with a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT)
topological phase transition, as supported by current-voltage characteristics
measured under temperature variation; these measurements preserve TRS. In
contrast, when an external magnetic field is applied, the superconducting state
is consistently preceded by weak antilocalization (WAL), where bound
vortex-antivortex pairs dissociate into a normal metallic state through an
intermediate localized phase. We further establish that highly disordered films
exhibit transport dominated by three-dimensional weak localization, with
superconductivity entirely suppressed.

Short-time dynamics in the $2D$ Blume-Capel model, with a non-conserved
order-parameter and short-ranged interactions, is analysed. For non-equilibrium
dynamics, both at a critical point in the $2D$ Ising universality class and at
the tricritical point, we reproduce the values $\Theta=0.190({5})$ and
$\Theta=-0.542({5})$, respectively, of the critical initial slip exponent.
These agree with more early estimates and with the Janssen-Schaub-Schmittmann
scaling relation. In phase-ordering kinetics, after a quench into the ordered
phase, we establish the validity of short-time dynamics. In the $2D$ Ising
universality class, we find $\Theta=0.39({1})$ in agreement with the scaling

- **TL;DR**: 提出split-flows方法，将粗粒化模型的反映射重新定义为跨分辨率的连续时间测度传输，能够进行条件采样并首次计算映射熵。

By reducing resolution, coarse-grained models greatly accelerate molecular
simulations, unlocking access to long-timescale phenomena, though at the
expense of microscopic information. Recovering this fine-grained detail is
essential for tasks that depend on atomistic accuracy, making backmapping a
central challenge in molecular modeling. We introduce split-flows, a novel
flow-based approach that reinterprets backmapping as a continuous-time measure
transport across resolutions. Unlike existing generative strategies,
split-flows establish a direct probabilistic link between resolutions, enabling
expressive conditional sampling of atomistic structures and -- for the first
time -- a tractable route to computing mapping entropies, an
information-theoretic measure of the irreducible detail lost in
coarse-graining. We demonstrate these capabilities on diverse molecular
systems, including chignolin, a lipid bilayer, and alanine dipeptide,
highlighting split-flows as a principled framework for accurate backmapping and
systematic evaluation of coarse-grained models.

- **TL;DR**: 开发了一种描述带点状杂质的Luttinger Liquid的新方法，基于散射相位场理论，通过匹配杂质位置处的电子波函数得到非局域作用量表达式，解决了紫外区域的收敛问题。

A new approach describing Luttinger Liquid with point-like impurity as field
theory for the phase of scattering is developed. It based on a matching of the
electron wave functions at impurity position point. As a result of the
approach, an expression for non-local action has been taken. The non-locality
of the theory leads to convergence of the observed values in an ultraviolet
region. It allows studying conductance of the channel up to electron-electron
interaction strength of the order of unit. Expansion of the non-local action in
small frequency powers makes possible to develop a new approach to the
renormalization group analysis of the problem. This method differs from the
"poor man's" approach widely used in solid-state physics. We have shown, in the
Luttinger Liquid "poor man's" approach breaks already in two-loop
approximation. We analyse the reason of this discrepancy. The qualitative
picture of the phenomenon is discussed.

### Inverse Purcell Suppression of Decoherence in Majorana Qubits via Environmental Engineering

- **Authors**: Vladimir Toussaint
- **Categories**: cond-mat.mes-hall
- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种优化拓扑量子器件的新方法：通过工程化环境来主动抑制退相干，而不是仅仅隔离量子比特与环境噪声。

We propose a novel approach for optimizing topological quantum devices:
instead of merely isolating qubits from environmental noise, we engineer the
environment to actively suppress decoherence. For a Majorana qubit in a
topological superconducting wire, we show that coupling via a parity-flipping
operator ($\gamma_L$) to a broadband bosonic environment yields a decoherence
rate scaling as $\Gamma \propto \rho(\epsilon)/\epsilon$, where
$\rho(\epsilon)$ is the environmental density of states at the qubit splitting
energy $\epsilon \sim e^{-L/\xi}$. By designing environments with suppressed
density of states at low frequencies (e.g., using photonic bandgap materials or
Josephson junction arrays), we achieve an ''inverse Purcell effect'' that leads
to a suppression factor $F_P \propto (\epsilon/\omega_c)^\alpha$, dramatically
reducing decoherence. This provides a quantitative design principle where
environmental engineering transforms detrimental noise into a tool for
coherence stabilization. Our work establishes environmental engineering as a
powerful approach for enhancing topological quantum devices.

### Temperature-driven polarization rotation and triclinic phase at morphotropic phase boundary of Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-PbTiO3 crystals

Information about the crystal structures in the range of morphotropic phase
boundary of ferroelectric perovskite solid solutions is important for
understanding their intricate properties which result in wide opportunities for
practical applications. However, for the (1-x)Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-xPbTiO3 solid
solution system this information is contradictory. Different
composition-temperature phase diagrams have been reported for this system in
literature based on the investigations of single crystals and ceramics using
various experimental techniques. In this work we apply polarized light
microscopy (PLM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and dielectric spectroscopy to study
the crystal structure and phase transitions in the
0.68Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.32PbTiO3 single crystal. We confirm the monoclinic MB
symmetry (space group Cm) of the room-temperature phase. According to PLM, it
transforms with increasing temperature into a triclinic (Tr) phase rather than
the previously reported monoclinic MC or tetragonal phase. XRD data are
consistent with the presence of Tr phase. The Tr phase transforms to the
monoclinic MC (Pm) phase and then to the cubic phase. Ergodic relaxor behavior
is observed above the Curie temperature. The unit cell in the MC phase is
pseudotetragonal with the lattice parameters a = b &lt; c and small monoclinic
angle. In the MB phase the direction of spontaneous polarization is temperature
independent and close to the &lt;111&gt; pseudocubic direction. In the Tr and MC
phases it changes with temperature so that near the Curie point it is close to
[001] axis. No significant anomalies in the dielectric properties or changes in
the domain structure are observed at the MB to Tr and Tr to MC phase
transitions. The domain structure changes dramatically when the temperature
varies within the Tr phase, causing a sharp change in birefringence.

Composite quantum compounds offer a fertile ground for uncovering the complex
interrelations between seemingly distinct phenomena in condensed matter physics
for advanced nonvolatile and spintronics applications. Beyond topological
superconductors and axion insulators, the idea of intertwined
Hyperferroelectricity (HyFE), multiple topological phases and Rashba
spin-splitting with reversible spin textures represents the local, global and
symmetry-driven characteristics of quantum materials, respectively, offering
unique pathways for enhanced functionalities. We unveiled a unified framework
to achieve this synergy through the presence of crystalline symmetries and
spin-orbit coupling in LiZnAs compound using first-principles calculations.
HyFE exhibits ability to maintain spontaneous polarization under open-circuit
boundary conditions, even with existence of depolarization field while Rashba
effect exhibits paradigmatic spin texture in momentum space with tangential
vector field. The presence of unstable $A_{2u}(LO)$ mode leads to free energy
minimum with significant well depth and polarization of -66 meV and $P_{HyFE} =
0.282~C/m^2$, respectively indicating stable HyFE. The robust HyFE stem from
mode-specific effective charges and larger high-frequency dielectric constants.
This study also addresses the subtle question of whether critical point of
topological phase transition shifts in response to drastically different Rashba
spin-splitting values obtained from VASP and WIEN2k. Moreover, biaxial strain
(BAS) induced Weyl semimetal (at 3.4% BAS) and topological insulating phase
(after 3.4% BAS) is observed with giant Rashba coefficient of 5.91 eV {\AA} and
2.42 eV {\AA}, respectively. Furthermore, switching of bulk polarization leads
to spin texture reversal, providing a robust mechanism to leverage spin degrees
of freedom in these Hyperferroelectric Rashba topological materials.

We explore the role of interfacial Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) for the
Josephson diode effect in all-metal diffusive Josephson junctions. Devices with
Fe/Pt and Cu/Pt weak links between Nb leads reveal a Josephson diode effect in
an in-plane magnetic field with magneto-chiral anisotropy according to the
symmetry of Rashba SOC. The Rashba SOC originates from inversion symmetry
breaking at the metal-metal interfaces. A control sample with a plain Cu-layer
as weak link exhibits also a finite diode efficiency that, in contrast, is
independent of the angle between current and field. The Fraunhofer patterns
display an apparent inverted hysteresis which can be traced back to stray
fields resulting from the conventional hysteretic vortex pinning in the Nb
contacts.

### Long-range frustration in Minimal Vertex Cover Problem on random graphs

- **TL;DR**: 本文通过考虑最小顶点覆盖问题中的长程挫败效应，建立了渗流模型理论框架，仅使用度分布就能分析预测稀疏随机图上的最小顶点覆盖能量密度。

A vertex cover on a graph is a set of vertices in which each edge of the
graph is adjacent to at least one vertex in the set. The Minimal Vertex Cover
(MVC) Problem concerns finding vertex covers with a smallest cardinality. The
MVC problem is a typical computationally hard problem among combinatorial
optimization on graphs, for which both developing fast algorithms to find
solution configurations on graph instances and constructing an analytical
theory to estimate their ground-state properties prove to be difficult tasks.
Here, by considering the long-range frustration (LRF) among MVC configurations
and formulating it into a theoretical framework of a percolation model, we
analytically estimate the energy density of MVCs on sparse random graphs only
with their degree distributions. We test our framework on some typical random
graph models. We show that, when there is a percolation of LRF effect in a
graph, our predictions of energy densities are slightly higher than those from
a hybrid algorithm of greedy leaf removal (GLR) procedure and survey
propagation-guided decimation algorithm on graph instances, and there are still
clearly closer to the results from the hybrid algorithm than an analytical
theory based on GLR procedure, which ignores LRF effect and underestimates
energy densities. Our results show that LRF is a proper mechanism in the
formation of complex energy landscape of MVC problem and a theoretical
framework of LRF helps to characterize its ground-state properties.

This study presents a dynamic modeling approach for precipitation in
electrolyte systems, focusing on the crystallization of an aromatic amine
through continuous processes. A novel model, integrating equilibrium and
crystallization kinetics, is formulated and applied to a continuous oscillatory
baffled reactor. The approach assumes rapid equilibrium establishment and is
formulated as a set of differential algebraic equations. Key features include a
population balance equation model to describe the particle size distribution
and the modeling of dynamically changing equilibria. The predictions of the
dynamic model show good agreement with the available experimental measurements.
The model is aimed at aiding the transition from a batch process to continuous
process by forming the basis for numerical optimization and advanced control.

Characterizing the electronic properties of single atoms, molecules, and
nanostructures is the hallmark of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM).
Recently, exploration of a complex manifold of nonequilibrium many-body
electron configurations has been enabled by the development of STM
electroluminescence methods (STML). STML provides access to optical properties
of individual molecules through a cascade of relaxation processes between
many-body states that obey energy conservation. Insufficient charge attachment
energies quench the relaxation cascade via optically excited states, causing
even intrinsically bright molecules to remain dark in STML. Here, we leverage
substrate work function control and tip-induced gating of the double barrier
tunnel junction to induce an energy shift of the ionic transition state of a
single free-base tetrabenzoporphyrin (H2TBP) to gain access to optically
excited states and bright exciton emission. The experimental observations are
validated by a rate equation and polaron model considering the relaxation
energy of the NaCl decoupling layer upon charging of the molecule.

### Impact of Oxygen Plasma Surface Treatment on Photoresist Adhesion in BaTiO3-Based Photonic Device Fabrication

- **TL;DR**: 氧等离子体预处理在BaTiO3薄膜上导致光刻胶脱附，研究发现这是由于等离子体诱导的表面化学变化形成了BaCO3富集界面层，降低了粘附性。

Oxygen-plasma pre-cleans are routine before fabrication, but on BaTiO3 thin
films we observed catastrophic photoresist lift-off during mild rinsing and
sonication. To explain the failure, we combined optical microscopy, EDS, and
XPS. EDS showed no meaningful bulk stoichiometry change, whereas XPS revealed a
nanometer-scale, plasma-induced shift in surface chemistry: hydroxylation and
carbonate formation consistent with a BaCO3-rich interphase at the
resist/BaTiO3 boundary. This chemically weak interphase, recreated upon each
plasma step and removable by simple solvent cleaning, provides the mechanism
for delamination. The key takeaway for practitioners is process guidance: avoid
uncritical O2-plasma use on BTO; if cleaning is required, use alternative
chemistries (e.g., UV-ozone) or carefully tuned plasma windows that preserve
adhesion. More broadly, the study illustrates how lightweight analytics at the
surface (correlative microscopy + surface spectroscopy) can pinpoint the root
cause of yield-limiting defects in oxide photonics and translate directly into
higher-reliability process recipes.

### Instability toward Superconducting Stripe Phase in Altermagnets with Strong Rashba Spin-Orbit Coupling

We numerically investigate finite-momentum superconductivity in
noncentrosymmetric metallic altermagnets with $d$-wave spin-splitting and
strong Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling. Focusing on a stripe phase in which
Cooper pairs acquire multiple center-of-mass momenta, we construct phase
diagrams that reveal phase boundaries between the stripe phase and a helical
phase characterized by a single center-of-mass momentum. Our results show that
the stripe phase emerges at low temperatures and exhibits a reentrant behavior
as a function of the strength of the altermagnetic splitting. We further
analyze the stripe phase within a linearized gap equation, and uncover the
mechanism of the pairing formation unique to the stripe phase. This mechanism
originates from the anisotropic deformation of the Fermi surfaces induced by
the altermagnetic splitting, highlighting the intriguing interplay between the
spin-orbit coupling and the altermagnets.

### Minimum Action Principle for Entropy Production Rate of Far-From-Equilibrium Systems

The Boltzmann distribution connects the energetics of an equilibrium system
with its statistical properties, and it is desirable to have a similar
principle for non-equilibrium systems. Here, we derive a variational principle
for the entropy production rate (EPR) of far-from-equilibrium discrete state
systems, relating it to the action for the transition probability measure of
discrete state processes. This principle leads to a tighter, non-quadratic
formulation of the dissipation function, speed limits, the
thermodynamic-kinetic uncertainty relation, the large deviation rate
functional, and the fluctuation relation, all within a unified framework of the
thermodynamic length. Additionally, the optimal control of non-conservative
transition affinities using the underlying geodesic structure is explored, and
the corresponding slow-driving and finite-time optimal driving exact protocols
are analytically computed. We demonstrate that discontinuous endpoint jumps in
optimal protocols are a generic, model-independent physical mechanism that
reduces entropy production during finite-time driving of far-from-equilibrium
systems.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了SAAM方法，一种在实空间中强制实施精确总自旋对称性的通用程序，用于神经网络量子蒙特卡洛，无需额外可调超参数即可实现精确自旋纯度。

Spin plays a fundamental role in understanding electronic structure, yet many
real-space wavefunction methods fail to adequately consider it. We introduce
the Spin-Adapted Antisymmetrization Method (SAAM), a general procedure that
enforces exact total spin symmetry for antisymmetric many-electron
wavefunctions in real space. In the context of neural network-based quantum
Monte Carlo (NNQMC), SAAM leverages the expressiveness of deep neural networks
to capture electron correlation while enforcing exact spin adaptation via group
representation theory. This framework provides a principled route to embed
physical priors into otherwise black-box neural network wavefunctions, yielding
a compact representation of correlated system with neural network orbitals.
Compared with existing treatments of spin in NNQMC, SAAM is more accurate and
efficient, achieving exact spin purity without any additional tunable
hyperparameters. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we apply SAAM to study the
spin ladder of iron-sulfur clusters, a long-standing challenge for many-body
methods due to their dense spectrum of nearly degenerate spin states. Our
results reveal accurate resolution of low-lying spin states and spin gaps in
[Fe$_2$S$_2$] and [Fe$_4$S$_4$] clusters, offering new insights into their
electronic structures. In sum, these findings establish SAAM as a robust,
hyperparameter-free standard for spin-adapted NNQMC, particularly for strongly
correlated systems.

Exact numerical results for the DC magnetoconductivity tensor of the
two-dimensional spatially disordered Yukawa-Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (2D-YSYK) model
on a square lattice, at first order in applied perpendicular magnetic field,
are obtained from the self-consistent disorder-averaged solution of the 2D-YSYK
saddle-point equations. This system describes fermions endowed with a Fermi
surface and coupled to a bosonic scalar field through spatially random Yukawa
interactions. The resulting local and energy-dependent fermionic self-energies
are employed in the Kubo formalism to calculate the longitudinal and Hall
conductivities, the Hall coefficient, the carrier mobility, and the cotangent
of the Hall angle, at fixed fermion density. From the interplay between YSYK
interactions and square-lattice embedding, and the non-Boltzmann
frequency-dependent self energies, we find nontrivial evolution of the
magnetotransport coefficients as a function of temperature and YSYK interaction
strength, notably a superlinear evolution of the Hall-angle cotangent and the
inverse carrier mobility with temperature, concomitant with
linear-in-temperature resistivity, in an extended crossover regime above the
low-temperature Marginal Fermi Liquid (MFL) ground state. Our model and results
provide a controlled theoretical framework to interpret linear magnetotransport
experiments in strange-metal phases found in strongly correlated solid-state
electron systems.

Scattering by charged impurities is known to mainly determine transport
properties of electrons in modern quantum materials, but it remains poorly
studied for materials with Mexican hat dispersion. Due to such nontrivial
features as a singular density of states and a ring-shaped Fermi surface,
electron-electron interaction and electron transitions between different
isoenergetic contours are of key importance in this materials. We show that
these factors significantly affect both the spatial profile of the screened
potential of Coulomb centers and the dependence of mobility on temperature and
electron density. The screened potential is calculated within the random phase
approximation. The transport properties are determined without using the usual
relaxation time approximation, since the distribution function in energy space
is a vector defined by a system of two equations.

Solid state spin photon interfaces operating in the near telecom and telecom
bands are a key resource for long distance quantum communication and scalable
quantum networks. However, their optical transitions often suffer from spectral
diffusion that hampers the generation of coherent spin photon entanglement.
Here we demonstrate narrow magneto-optical transitions of erbium dopants
implanted into thin film silicon carbide (SiC)-on-insulator, a viable platform
for industrially scalable quantum networks. Using high-resolution resonant
spectroscopy and spectral hole burning at cryogenic temperatures, we reveal sub
megahertz homogeneous linewidths and identify two lattice sites that best
stabilise the emitters. We further characterise their optical lifetimes and
magneto-optical response, establishing erbium doped SiC-on-insulator as a
robust and scalable platform for on-chip quantum networks.

Self-assembled networks of metallic nanowires (NWs) are being intensively
explored as test benches for neuromorphic proposals. In this work, we study the
electric transport properties of dense self-assembled networks of Ag-based NWs
(AgNWNs) coated with a thin insulating layer, using DC and AC stimuli. The
building blocks of this network are the metallic NWs and the NW-NW junctions,
either metallic or memristive. In the pristine state, frequency independence of
the impedance reveals an over-percolated purely resistive network. A
combination of low-temperature annealing and AC stimulus is shown to
drastically affect the resistivity of the sample (interpreted as a depopulation
of purely metallic junctions), unveiling a rich dynamic response. This
procedure triggers the achievement of a capacitive response, which is
successfully rationalized using a previously introduced 'two junction model'.
Thermal treatment appears to be an indirect strategy to effectively modify the
humidity content at the NW-NW intersections and, consequently, enable multiple
switching schemes suitable for brain-like processing alternatives.

observation of an anisotropic Fulde-Ferrell (FF) phase in few-layer
NbSe$_2$/CrSiTe$_3$ heterostructures under in-plane magnetic fields. Through
combined magnetoresistance and nonreciprocal transport measurements, we find
that due to the couplings from the ferromagnetic CrSiTe$_3$, a half-dome-shaped
region emerges in the magnetic field-temperature ($B$-$T$) diagram.
Importantly, the half-dome-shaped region exhibits finite second harmonic
resistance with in-plane anisotropy, indicating that the superconducting state
is an anisotropic FF phase. Through a symmetry analysis combined with mean
field calculations, we attribute the emergent anisotropic FF phase to the
CrSiTe$_3$ layer induced Rashba SOC and three-fold rotational symmetry
breaking. These results demonstrate that heterostructure stacking is a powerful
tool for symmetry engineering in superconductors, which can advance the design
of quantum devices in atomically thin superconducting materials.

The Boltzmann distribution for an equilibrium system constrains the
statistics of the system by the energetics. Despite the non-equilibrium
generalization of the Boltzmann distribution being studied extensively, a
unified framework valid for far-from-equilibrium discrete state systems is
lacking. Here, we derive an exact path-integral representation for discrete
state processes and represent it using the exponential of the action for
stochastic transition dynamics. Solving the variational problem, the effective
action is shown to be equal to the inferred entropy production rate (a
thermodynamic quantity) and a non-quadratic dissipation function of the
thermodynamic length (TL) defined for microscopic stochastic currents (a
dynamic quantity). This formulates a far-from-equilibrium analog of the
Boltzmann distribution, namely, the minimum action principle. The non-quadratic
dissipation function is physically attributed to incorporating non-Gaussian
fluctuations or far-from-equilibrium non-conservative driving. Further, an
exact large deviation dynamical rate functional is derived. The equivalence of
the variational formulation with the information geometric formulation is
proved. The non-quadratic TL recovers the non-quadratic thermodynamic-kinetic
uncertainty relation (TKUR) and the speed limits, which are tighter than the
close-to-equilibrium quadratic formulations. Moreover, if the transition
affinities are known, the non-quadratic TL recovers the fluctuation relation
(FR). The minimum action principle manifests the non-quadratic TKUR and FR as
two faces corresponding to the thermodynamic inference and partial control
descriptions, respectively. In addition, the validity of these results is
extended to coarse-grained observable currents, strengthening the
experimental/numerical applicability of them.

### Volumetric and viscosity data of 1-iodonaphthalene + n-alkanes mixture at (288.15-308.15) K

- **TL;DR**: 测量了1-碘萘与不同烷烃混合物的密度和粘度，发现过量摩尔体积为负值且随温度升高而减小，表明结构效应是主要贡献。粘度偏差也为负值，表明烷烃能破坏1-碘萘分子间的相互作用。

Density and viscosity measurements have been performed for the systems
1-iodonaphthalene + heptane, or + decane, or + dodecane, or + tetradecane over
the temperature range (288.15-308.15) K and atmospheric pressure. At this end,
a densitometer Anton-Paar DMA 602 and a Ubbelohde viscosimeter were used.
Excess molar volumes are large and negative and decrease when the temperature
is increased, which reveals that the main contribution to the excess molar
volume arises from structural effects. The values of the deviations of dynamic
viscosity from linear dependence on mole fraction are also large and negative,
indicating that n-alkanes are good breakers of the interactions between
1-iodonaphthalene molecules. Different models were applied for describing
viscosity data. McAllister's equation correlates well with kinematic
viscosities. Results are similar when dynamic viscosities are correlated with
the Grunberg-Nissan or Fang-He equations. This means that size effects are not
relevant to the mentioned data. The adjustable parameter of the Grunberg-Nissan
equation is negative for all the systems at any temperature, a typical feature
of systems where dispersive interactions are dominant. This is in agreement
with findings obtained in previous studies on similar n-alkane mixtures
involving C$_6$H$_5$X (X = Cl, Br, I) or 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene or
1-chloronaphthalene. Free volume effects have little influence on the present
dynamic viscosity results, well represented by the absolute rate model using
residual molar Gibbs energies obtained from the DISQUAC model.

We present an improved version of the algorithm contracting and optimizing
finite projected entangled pair states (fPEPS) in conjunction with projected
entangled pair operators (PEPOs). Our work has two components to it. First, we
explain in detail the characteristic contraction patterns that occur in fPEPS
calculations and how to slice them such that peak memory occupation remains
minimal while ensuring efficient parallel computation. Second, we combine
controlled bond expansion [A. Gleis, J.-W. Li, and J. von Delft, Phys. Rev.
Lett. 130, 246402 (2023)] with randomized singular value decomposition [V.
Rokhlin, A. Szlam, and M. Tygert, SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl. (2009)] and apply
it throughout the fPEPS algorithm. We present benchmark results for the Hubbard
model for system sizes up to 8x8 and SU(2) symmetric bond dimension of up to D
= 6 for PEPS bonds and $\chi$ = 500 for the environment bonds. Finally, we
comment on the state and future of the fPEPS-PEPO framework.

Dynamic conductance and time-of-flight current instability in a quantum wire
connected to electron reservoirs under DC bias voltage are studied in the
absence of a gate screening the Coulomb interaction of electrons. Due to a
strong electron-electron interaction, dramatic rearrangements of the charge
density distribution and the potential landscape in the wire occur at a
sufficiently high DC bias voltage. The applied voltage is screened mainly near
the cathode contact, and an almost flat potential profile is established in the
most of the wire. Thus, the size of the region of a population inversion of
electronic states greatly increases, and the band of wave vectors that form
unstable modes of electronic waves significantly reduces. As a result, the
conditions for the occurrence of the time-of-flight instability are greatly
facilitated and the negative dynamic conductivity increases.

We studied enhanced superconductivity in point contacts (PCs) based on a
type-I Weyl semimetal t-PtBi2 using both normal metal (Ag, Cu, Pt) and
ferromagnetic (Fe, Co, Ni) tips by measuring the differential resistance
dV/dI(V) curves. In most cases, the value of the superconducting critical
temperature Tc ranges between 3 and 5 K, which is several times higher than the
maximal bulk Tc. At the same time, among dozens of PCs with higher Tc, a few of
them reach Tc up to 8 K, including those with both normal and ferromagnetic
tips. The critical magnetic field is also highly enhanced in PCs and reaches up
to several Tesla. The common reason for the Tc increase may be related to
pressure/strain caused at the PC's formation. Moreover, a greater increase in
Tc is observed for PCs formed at the edge of the sample flake than for those
formed on the plane. The results also reveal that the growth of Tc in PCs based
on t-PtBi2 is compatible with ferromagnetism in Fe, Co, and Ni tips, initiating
discussion as to the possible non-trivial nature of enhanced superconductivity.
Anyway, our findings suggest that t-PtBi2 is a promising candidate for
realizing topological superconductivity at more accessible temperatures

### Generalized Finite-time Optimal Control Framework in Stochastic Thermodynamics

Optimal processes in stochastic thermodynamics are a frontier for
understanding the control and design of non-equilibrium systems, with broad
practical applications in biology, chemistry, and nanoscale/mesoscale systems.
Optimal mass transport theory and thermodynamic geometry have emerged as
optimal control methodology, but they are based on slow-driving and close to
equilibrium assumptions. An optimal control framework in stochastic
thermodynamics for finite time driving is still elusive. Therefore, we solve in
this paper an optimal control problem for changing the control parameters of a
discrete-state far-from-equilibrium process from an initial to a final value in
finite-time. Optimal driving protocols are derived that minimize the total
finite-time dissipation cost for the driving process. Our framework reveals
that discontinuous endpoint jumps are a generic, model-independent physical
mechanism that minimizes the optimal driving entropy production, whose
importance is further amplified for far-from-equilibrium systems. The
thermodynamic and dynamic physical interpretation and understanding of
discontinuous endpoint jumps is formulated. An exact mapping between the
finite-time to slow driving optimal control formulation is elucidated,
developing the state-of-the-art of optimal mass transport theory and
thermodynamic geometry, which has been the current paradigm for studying
optimal processes in stochastic thermodynamics that relies on slow driving
assumptions. Our framework opens up a plethora of applications to the
thermodynamically efficient control of a far-from-equilibrium system in
finite-time, which opens up a way to their efficient design principles.

The surface effect and quantum confinement render nanomaterials the
optoelectronic properties more susceptible to nonradiative processes than their
bulk counterparts. These nonradiative processes usually contain a series of
interwoven and competing sub-processes, which are challenging to disentangle.
Here, we investigate the structural origin of Auger recombination in ZnO
nanoparticles using transient absorption spectroscopy and ultrafast electron
diffraction. The photogenerated hot holes are captured by oxygen vacancies
through an Auger mechanism, inducing significant local structural distortions
around the oxygen vacancy and its neighboring zinc tetrahedron on a
sub-picosecond timescale. The recombination of trapped holes accelerates the
lattice thermalization and stabilizes the formed small hole polarons.
Subsequently, the recombination of localized polarons forms a confined
exciton-polaron complex that may account for the long-lived (&gt;7 ns) visible
luminescence observed in ZnO nanoparticles. Our findings are potentially
applicable to other transition metal oxide nanomaterials, bringing insights for
the optimization of their functional properties.

We theoretically demonstrate that strong non Fermi-liquid magnetic
oscillations of electron-electron scattering time can exist in
quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) conductors under condition of the magnetic
breakdown between two open electron orbits. They are shown to be due to
electron-electron interactions in a metallic phase under condition of the
magnetic breakdown and they are beyond the Fermi-liquid theory. In particular,
we consider as example the organic conductor (TMTSF)$_2$ClO$_4$ and perform
both analytical and numerical calculations for its known electron spectrum. We
also argue that similar oscillations of resistivity can exist in a metallic
phase of another Q1D organic conductor - (Per)$_2$Au(mnt)$_2$.

### Tuning the Electronic Structure of Graphene by Controlling Spatial Confinement

The electronic properties of a material depend on the spatial freedom of the
electron wavefunction. A well-known example is graphite, which is a
conventional gapless semiconductor, while a single layer of it, graphene,
exhibits extremely high electronic conductivity. Nevertheless, graphene ribbons
can have different physical properties, such as a tunable band gap, from
gapless to large band gap semiconductor. The purpose of this study is to
investigate the electronic structure of graphene few-layers composed of a layer
of graphene nanoribbons and graphene sheet(s), %\textcolor{blue}{or a
Sheebbon}, where quasi-one-dimensional nanoribbons can interact with
two-dimensional sheet of graphite. Using the tight-binding model for graphite,
we show how different configuration of such heterostructures can affect the
electronic structure, in which is different from their components electronic
structure. Namely, a gap of ~0.6 eV can be opened in a bilayer configuration
composed of a layer of gapless armchair nanoribbon stacked on graphene.

### Improved treatment of relativistic effects in linear augmented plane wave (LAPW) method: application to Ac, Th, ThO2 and UO2

We examine the influence of the relativistic effects within the linear
augmented plane wave method (LAPW) with the potential of general shape for
solids and suggest a few ways to account them more accurately: (1) we introduce
new radial wave functions based on two actual radial solutions of the Dirac
equation for j=l-1/2 and j=l+1/2 one-electron states; (2) the canonical LAPW
matrix elements for the spherically symmetric component of the potential,
assuming non-relativistic radial wave functions, should be corrected; (3) we
argue that for a realistic spin-orbit energy splitting of the semicore
6p-states the spin-orbit interaction constant zeta(p) should be calculated with
the 6p3/2 radial component; (4) in cases when two j=l +/- 1/2 components are
occupied (for example for the 6p states of actinides) the electron density,
associated with the small components of valence electrons, can be taken into
the calculation scheme. We demonstrate that the new treatment for the
relativistic effects is capable to change the equilibrium lattice constant up
to 0.15~{\AA} and the bulk modulus up to 26 GPa. We find that the electron
density of valence electrons at the nucleus increases by 2.3-4.3 times due to
the inclusion of small components, which can be essential for precise
description of the potential and density close to the nuclear region, important
for nuclear spectroscopies. In contrast to the common believe that in plain
band structure treatment UO2 is a metal, we show that in the presence of the
spin-orbit coupling UO2 has a small gap of forbidden states (0.2-0.4 eV) at the
Fermi level, where the highest occupied and the lowest unoccupied $5f$ bands
slightly overlap, as in calculations of the conduction and valence band in
solid Ge.

### Novel $H_{\rm c2}$ suppression mechanism in a spin triplet superconductor -- Application to UTe$_2$--

A novel $H_{\rm c2}$ suppression mechanism is theoretically proposed in a
spin triplet superconductor (SC) with equal spin pairs. We show that the upper
critical field $H_{\rm c2}$ can be reduced from the orbital depairing limit
$H^{\rm orb}_{\rm c2}$ to arbitrarily small value, keeping the second order
phase transition nature. This mechanism is sharply different from the known
Pauli-Clogston limit for a spin singlet SC where the reduction is limited to
$\sim$0.3$H^{\rm orb}_{\rm c2}$ with the first order transition when the Maki
parameter goes infinity. This novel $H_{\rm c2}$ suppression mechanism is
applied to UTe$_2$, which is a prime candidate for a spin triplet SC, to
successfully analyze the $H_{\rm c2}$ data for various crystalline orientations
both under ambient and applied pressure, and to identify the pairing symmetry.
It is concluded that the non-unitary spin triplet state with equal spin pairs
is realized in UTe$_2$, namely $(\hat b+i\hat c)k_a$ in $^3$B$_{\rm 3u}$ which
is classified under finite spin orbit coupling scheme.

We consider interacting paraparticle chains with a constant $R$-matrix where
the Hamiltonian sums over the internal degrees (flavors) of the paraparticles.
For such flavor-blind Hamiltonians we show a general factorization of the
Hilbert space into occupation and flavor parts with the Hamiltonian acting
non-trivially only on the former. For open boundaries, the spectrum therefore
coincides with that of the occupation Hamiltonian $H_{\rm occ}$ with the flavor
part merely adding degeneracies. For periodic boundaries, a cyclic reordering
of the flavors leads to a separation of $H_{\rm occ}$ into flux sectors at
fixed particle number, thus making the parastatistics directly observable in
the energy spectrum. For important exemplary cases, $H_{\rm occ}$ reduces to
the XXZ chain with flux allowing for an exact solution. In the gapless regime,
this solution shows flux-shifted $c=1$ conformal towers in the low-energy
spectrum and a temperature-dependent chemical potential in the bulk
thermodynamics.

Predictive simulation of vibrational spectra of complex condensed phases and
interfaces with thousands of degrees of freedom has long been a challenging
task of modern condensed matter theory. In this work, fourth-generation
high-dimensional committee neural network potentials (4G-HDCNNPs) are developed
for the first time, using active learning and query-by-committee, and
introduced to the essential nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) as well as
conformational entropy and anharmonicities from path integral (PI) molecular
dynamics simulations. Using representative bulk water and air-water interface
systems, we demonstrate the accuracy of the developed framework in infrared and
vibrational sum frequency generation spectral simulations. Specifically, by
seamlessly integrating non-local charge transfer interactions from 4G-HDCNNPs
with the NQEs from PI methods, our introduced methodology yields accurate
infrared spectra using predicted charges from the 4G-HDCNNP architecture
without explicit training of dipole moments. Our vibrational sum frequency
generation spectra also illustrate high accuracy for the considered air-water
interface system. The introduced framework in this work is general and offers a
benchmark tool and a simple, practical paradigm for predictive spectral
simulations of complex condensed phases and interfaces, free from empirical
parameterizations and/or ad hoc fittings.

have to exist in metallic phases of some quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D)

TMTSF stands for tetramethyltetraselenafulvalene, Per is polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbon and mnt is mononitrotoluene,

Majorana zero modes are anyons obeying non-Abelian exchange statistics
distinct from fermions or bosons. While significant progresses have been
achieved in the past two decades in searching for these exotic excitations in
solid-state systems, their non-Abelian nature remains unverified, as definitive
proof requires braiding operations. Here, we report preliminarily experimental
advances in creating, manipulating, and exchanging the presumed Majorana zero
modes in an envelope-shaped Josephson device composed of multiple trijunctions
on a topological insulator surface. We observed the signatures of in-gap states
migration consistent with the expectations of the Fu-Kane model, supporting the
realization of an exchange operation. This work would establish a critical
pathway toward ultimately braiding Majorana zero modes in the Fu-Kane scheme of
topological quantum computation.

Freestanding oxide films offer significant potential for integrating exotic
quantum functionalities with semiconductor technologies. However, their
performance is critically limited by surface roughness and interfacial
imperfection caused by dangling bonds, which disrupt coherent interactions and
suppress quantum phenomena at heterointerfaces. To address the challenge of
structural characterization of surfaces and interfaces, we develop a
metrological approach achieving atomic-scale precision in mapping the
topography of both free surfaces and buried interfaces within ultrathin oxide
heterostructures leveraging three-dimensional structures reconstructed from
multislice electron ptychography. This method also allows for counting the
number of atoms, even including light elements such as oxygen, along the
electron trajectory in electron microscopy, leading to the identification of
surface termination in oxide films. The planar-view of measurement geometry,
allowing for large field-of-view imaging, provides remarkably rich information
and high statistics about the atomic-scale structural inhomogeneities in
freestanding membranes. This quantitative analysis provides unprecedented
capabilities for correlating structural imperfection with quantum device
performance, offering critical insights for engineering robust heterointerfaces
in next-generation oxide electronics.

Transient states of matter far from equilibrium may exhibit physical
properties beyond those allowed by the equilibrium-state crystalline
symmetries. We explore ultrafast and direct electronic excitations of transient
states in a cavity superconductor by using time-resolved terahertz-pump
terahertz-probe spectroscopy. Our results show that the strong terahertz field
can transiently modify the symmetries of the electronic subsystems via the
injection of a transient supercurrent, leading to high-order nonlinear
dynamical responses that are not compatible with the equilibrium-state
symmetries, which evidences for transient symmetry breaking on the picosecond
time scale. Our study also finds that the strong coupling of the superconductor
to the designed microcavities enables the sensitive detection of the nonlinear
responses associated to the transient symmetry breaking.

We study explosive connectivity and mechanical rigidity in three-dimensional
cubic lattice structures under Achlioptas-type product-rule dynamics. Our work
combines extensive numerical simulation with the development of a new
theoretical framework. For connectivity, we rigorously establish the presence
of sublinear-width merger-cascade windows for $k\ge 2$, which drive macroscopic
jumps in the order parameter and imply a first-order transition. For rigidity,
we discover numerically that for richly-connected hosts, increasing the number
of choices $k$ monotonically enhances the efficiency of rigidification. To
explain this phenomenon, we propose a theoretical model centered on a
conditional progress function that links an edge's local product-rule score to
its global mechanical utility. We show that this function becomes
non-increasing, thus explaining the observed monotonic efficiency, under two
physically-motivated assumptions. Altogether, our work provides new insights
into the relationship between local dynamics and global connectivity and
rigidity in cubic lattice structures via both theory and computation.

### From Wavefunction Sign Structure to Static Correlation

- **TL;DR**: 该论文将静态关联重新定义为费米子符号问题的定量度量，通过变分能量差来量化节点惩罚，揭示了费米子关联的固有复杂性。

Static correlation, the breakdown of mean-field theory in correlated
many-fermion systems, can be reframed as a quantitative gauge of the
fermion-sign problem. The variational energy gap between correlated
wavefunctions constrained by mean-field and exact Dirichlet nodes defines a
nodal penalty driven by their topological differences. Method-agnostic and
dictated solely by the sign structure of the wavefunction, this penalty
measures the intrinsic complexity of fermionic correlations. This framework
unifies orbital and real-space views and opens a general route toward a
rigorous, method-independent decomposition of electron correlation, guiding
topology-aware approaches and future node-centric strategies.

- **TL;DR**: 本文提出了一种在莫尔材料中创建拓扑边界态的通用机制，通过物理边界切割莫尔位点来诱导体拓扑极化，从而产生具有分数电荷的鲁棒边界态。

Moir\'e superlattices provide a compelling platform for exploring exotic
correlated physics. Electronic interference within these systems often results
in flat bands with localized electrons, which are typically described by
effective moir\'e lattice models. While conventional models treat moir\'e sites
as indivisible, analogous to atoms in a crystal, this picture overlooks a
crucial distinction: unlike a true atom, a moir\'e site is composed of tens to
thousands of atoms and is therefore spatially divisible. Here, we introduce a
universal mechanism rooted in this spatial divisibility to create topological
boundary states in moir\'e materials. Through tight-binding and density
functional theory calculations, we demonstrate that cutting a moir\'e site with
a physical boundary induces bulk topological polarization, generating robust
boundary states with fractional charges. We further show that when the net edge
polarization is canceled, this mechanism drives the system into an intrinsic
moir\'e higher-order topological insulator (mHOTI) phase. As a concrete
realization, we predict that twisted bilayer tungsten disulfide ($WS_2$) is a
robust mHOTI with experimentally detectable corner states when its boundaries
cut through moir\'e hole sites. Our findings generalize the theoretical
framework of moir\'e higher-order topology, highlight the critical role of edge
terminations, and suggest new opportunities for realizing correlated HOTIs and
higher-order superconductivity in moir\'e platforms.

- **TL;DR**: ECR方法可用于分析复杂能带结构中的载流子散射机制，无需磁输运测量。研究发现该方法不仅适用于理想能带结构，也适用于复杂能带结构，且能更好地区分不同散射机制。

The electrical conductivity ratio (ECR) method can be used to analyze carrier
scattering mechanism (CSM) without the need of magenetic transport
measurements. In this work, the applicability of the ECR method in the analysis
of complex energy band structures is discussed. Combined with the
thermoelectric properties of SnSe, the feasibility using ECR method of ideal
single band transport model to study the CSM of semiconductor materials with
complicated band structure is studied. The results indicate that ECR method is
not only applicable to idea band structure as reported before but also to the
complicated band structure. The analysis results of the CSM of single crystal
SnSe by ECR method using ideal single-band model agree with the carrier
mobility temperature dependence in the nonphase transition temperature range.
The CSM along three direction of single crystal SnSe are different because of
its anisotropic crystal structure. The difference between dislocation
scattering (DS) and charged impurity scattering (CIS) is that DS is always
accompanied by polar optical phonon scattering (POP), such as the CSM of SnSe
along b axis direction. The difference between CIS and DS can be more easily
distinguished by the ECR method than the carrier mobility temperature dependent
method. DS and POP might be one of the approaches to improve thermoelectric
property because the scattering factor for DS or POP is larger than that of
acoustic phonon scattering (APS) and alloy scattering (AS). For polycrystalline
SnSe, the carrier scattering mechanisms varies with the crystal structure and
the temperature. This indicates that the ECR method can better reflect the
variation of carrier scattering mechanisms with temperature compared to the
carrier mobility temperature dependence method.

### Current-Gated Orthogonal Superconducting Transistor

Nonreciprocal charge transport in superconductors enables rectification but
is usually limited to the longitudinal direction. In this work, we show that a
direct current bias injected off principal axes in two-dimensional anisotropic
superconductors converts anisotropy into transverse nonreciprocity, enabling
supercurrent diode effect measurement. This is demonstrated within both a
Ginzburg-Landau framework and self-consistent mean-field calculations. When the
control bias exceeds its critical value, the transverse dissipationless
currents can only flow unidirectionally. This mechanism motivates the design of
a multi-terminal current-gated orthogonal superconducting transistor (CGOST)
and yields simple, bias direction angle-dependent design rules for device
optimization. As direct applications, we propose a tunable supercurrent range
controller and a half-wave rectifier based on the CGOST. Our findings open new
avenues for developing nonreciprocal superconducting electronic devices.

### On the Fibonacci-Lucas Ground State Degeneracies of the One-Dimensional Antiferromagnetic Ising Model at Criticality

This work examines the one-dimensional antiferromagnetic Ising model in a
longitudinal magnetic field, comparing open-chain and closed-ring geometries.
At the nontrivial quantum critical point (QCP) $B_{\mathrm{crit}} = B/J = 2$,
we perform a microcanonical analysis of the ground-state manifold and
explicitly count the number of degenerate configurations. The enumeration
reveals that ground states follow the $N$th Fibonacci sequence for open chains
and the $N$th Lucas sequence for periodic rings, establishing a clear
correspondence between critical degeneracy, topology, and the golden ratio.
This combinatorial duality exposes a number-theoretic structure underlying
quantum criticality and highlights the role of topological constraints in
shaping residual entropy. Beyond its conceptual relevance, the result provides
a compact framework for analyzing degeneracy scaling in one-dimensional spin
systems and may inform future studies of critical phenomena and quantum
thermodynamic devices operating near critical regimes.

### Comparison between first-principles supercell calculations of polarons and the ab initio polaron equations

- **TL;DR**: 本文比较了两种计算极化子的第一性原理方法：基于密度泛函理论的超胞方法和基于密度泛函微扰理论的耦合非线性特征值方法。通过TiO2、MgO和LiF等典型绝缘体中的小极化子案例，发现两种方法得到的极化子波函数和晶格畸变几乎相同，形成能量在TiO2中吻合良好，在MgO中吻合一般。

Polarons are composite quasiparticles formed by excess charges and the
accompanying lattice distortions in solids, and play a critical role in
transport, optical, and catalytic properties of semiconductors and insulators.
The standard approach for calculating polarons from first principles relies on
density functional theory and periodic supercells. An alternative approach
consists of recasting the calculation of polaron wavefunction, lattice
distortion, and energy as a coupled nonlinear eigenvalue problem, using the
band structure, phonon dispersions, and the electron-phonon matrix elements as
obtained from density functional perturbation theory. Here, we revisit the
formal connection between these two approaches, with an emphasis on the
handling of self-interaction correction, and we establish a compact formal link
between them. We perform a quantitative comparison of these methods for the
case of small polarons in the prototypical insulators TiO2, MgO, and LiF. We
find that the polaron wavefunctions and lattice distortions obtained from these
methods are nearly indistinguishable in all cases, and the formation energies
are in good (TiO2) to fair (MgO) agreement. We show that the residual
deviations can be ascribed to the neglect of higher-order electron-phonon
couplings in the density functional perturbation theory approach.

We studied interference dislocations (forks) adjacent to an emission spot in
an interference pattern. The adjacent interference dislocations are observed in
emission of excitons in a monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide and in
emission of spatially indirect excitons, also known as interlayer excitons, in
a van der Waals heterostructure. The simulations show that the adjacent
interference dislocations appear due to the moir\'e effect in combined
interference patterns produced by constituting parts of the emission spot. The
adjacent interference dislocations can appear in interference images for
various spatially modulated emission patterns.

### Altermagnetism and Anomalous Transport in Ag$^{2+}$ Fluorides: KAgF$_3$ and K$_2$AgF$_4$

Compounds containing Ag$^{2+}$ ion with 4d$^9$ configuration will cause
significant Jahn-Teller distortions and orbital ordering. Such orbital order is
closely related to the magnetic coupling, according to Goodenough-Kanamori
Ruels. Our first-principles calculations reveal that the ground state of
KAgF$_3$ exhibits collinear A-type antiferromagnetic (A-AFM) ordering
accompanied by C-type orbital ordering. In contrast, K$_2$AgF$_4$ adopts a
collinear intralayer antiferromagnetic configuration coupled with ferromagnetic
orbital ordering. The A-AFM KAgF$_3$ presents distinct altermagnetic responses,
including: (i) prominent anomalous transport effects, such as anomalous Hall
conductivity (AHC), anomalous Nernst conductivity (ANC), and thermal anomalous
Hall conductivity (TAHC); and (ii) strong magneto-optical responses, manifested
through pronounced Kerr and Faraday effects. On the other hand, K$_2$AgF$_4$
behaves as a conventional collinear antiferromagnet preserving $\mathcal{PT}$
symmetry, hence precluding the emergence of an anomalous Hall response.

### Superconductivity of bilayer two-orbital Hubbard model for La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ under high pressure

By combining density functional theory (DFT) and density matrix
renormalization group calculations, we investigate the unusual pressure
dependence of superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) in the nickelate
superconductor La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$. Using the hopping integrals and on-site
potentials obtained by fitting the DFT band structures, we map a quantum phase
diagram of a bilayer two-orbital Hubbard model with increasing pressure in a
ladder geometry, which has an intermediate Hubbard repulsion and a Hund's
coupling. Near $3/8$ filling, we find a strong spin density wave order, which
at $3/8$ filling shows a real-space spin pattern similar to the spin-charge
stripe order along a lattice direction. At $21/64$ filling, we find a
superconducting phase with interlayer superconductivity (SC) in both the
$d_{z^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals, as well as in-plane SC in the $d_{z^2}$
orbital. Intriguingly, the SC is weakened with increasing pressure and transits
to a Luttinger liquid above $80$ GPa, which qualitatively agrees with the
experimental observations of decreasing $T_c$ with increasing pressure and a
transition to Fermi liquid above $80$ GPa in La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$. Through a
comparative study, we further show that the ratio of interaction to hopping
integral, which reduces moderately with increasing pressure, may play a
dominant role in the weakening of SC. Our results of this experimentally
relevant model not only find a robust SC through suppressing the competing spin
density wave order, but also give new insight into the unusual pressure
dependence of SC in La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$.

Manipulating electron quantum 1D channels is an important element in the
field of quantum information due to their ballistic and phase coherence
properties. In GaAs and graphene based two dimensional gas systems, these edge
channels have been investigated with both integer and fractional quantum Hall
effects, contributing to the realization of electron interferometer and anyon
braiding. Often, at the p-n junction in the quantum Hall (QH) regime, the
presence of a depletion region due to a band gap or the formation of gaps
between the zeroth Landau levels (zLL) suppresses interaction between the
co-propagating edge channels of opposing doping regimes and helps to preserve
the phase coherence of the channels. Here, we observe a new type of p-n
junction in hexagonal boron nitride aligned graphene that lacks both the zLL
and band gap. In this system, a van Hove singularity (vHS) emerges at the p-n
junctions under magnetic fields of several Tesla, owing to the doping inversion
near the secondary Dirac point. By fabricating devices with independently
tunable global bottom and local top gates, we enable the study of interactions
between p-type and n-type QH edge channels through magnetic breakdown
associated with the vHS. These findings provide valuable insights into the
interactions of superlattice-induced QH edge channels in hBN-aligned graphene.

The phenomenological theory of martensite crystallography (PTMC) explains the
main crystallographic and microstructural features of martensite in shape
memory alloys, such as the transformation twins between the martensite
variants, and the interfaces between austenite and martensite bi-variant
laminates. It also permits to determine which austenite and martensite lattice
parameters should be targeted to get supercompatibility, which has driven over
the last decades important research and development of new shape memory alloys
with low hysteresis and high cyclability. First, we show that the cofactor
conditions generally used to define supercompatibility are not necessary
because they are redundant with the invariant plane condition. Second, we
develop an alternative to the PTMC, called correspondence theory (CT). The
mathematical tools of the PTMC come from continuum mechanics (pole
decompositions and stretch tensors); they are advantageously replaced here by
pure crystallographic tools (metric tensors, group of symmetries and
correspondence), which allow direct calculations of the transformation twins
and their generic and non-generic characters. A new symmetric matrix, called
compatibility of metrics by correspondence (CMC) is also introduced. The
supercompatibility condition can now be understood and written as the
degeneracy of a quadratic form of the CMC, or geometrically as the degeneracy
of double-cone into a double-plane, a plane, or the full space. We also show
that for usual martensitic transformations, the different types of habit planes
formed by bi-variant laminates can be determined from the CMC matrix, in a more
rigorous and efficient way than that proposed by the PTMC. The CT does not
differ from the PTMC in its foundations, but is represents a good alternative
to understand and calculate the crystallographic properties of martensite in
shape memory alloys.

CoNb$_2$O$_6$ is a unique magnetic material. It features bulk
three-dimensional magnetic order at low temperatures, but its quantum critical
behavior in a magnetic field is well described by the one-dimensional
transverse-field Ising universality class. This behavior is facilitated by the
structural arrangement of magnetic Co$^{2+}$ ions in nearly isolated zig-zag
chains. In this work, we investigate the effect of random site dilution on the
critical properties of such a quasi-one-dimensional quantum Ising system. To
this end, we introduce an anisotropic site-diluted three-dimensional
transverse-field Ising model. We find that site dilution leads to
unconventional activated scaling behavior at the quantum phase transition.
Interestingly, the critical exponents of the quantum critical point are in good
agreement with those of the disordered three-dimensional transverse-field Ising
universality class, despite the strong spatial anisotropy. We discuss the
generality our findings as well as implications for experiments.

Moir\'e patterns arising from twisted van der Waals stacks fundamentally
reshape their electronic properties, enabling band-structure engineering that
has driven rapidly growing interest in this field. In studying electronic
properties, however, structural disorder present in real devices often leads to
twist-angle inhomogeneity and obscures angle-dependent electronic effects when
measured with bulk-averaged measurements. Probes that can access local
thermodynamic response of the electronic systems with high sensitivity would be
highly valuable. Here, we adopt Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) to locally
investigate graphene-hBN superlattices. By additionally modulating the chemical
potential of the system, we obtain the inverse compressibility with high
signal-to-noise ratio, enabling extraction of the local thermodynamic DOS. From
this information, we determine the local twist angle along the device and find
that twist-angle deviations are strongly correlated with bubble-induced strain
features. Furthermore, by simultaneously tracking the offsets in the contact
potential difference and in the net charge, we identify which interface within
the heterostructure hosts the trapped bubbles. This capability to identify
local electro-chemical environments provides a practical tool for strain-based
studies and future device designs utilizing nanoscale engineering in moir\'e
systems.

- **TL;DR**: 使用高维玻色化方法推导了描述各向同性二维费米液体中Pomeranchuk相变的有效场理论，发现该相变由导致自发费米面畸变的特征模软化触发。

We use high-dimensional bosonization to derive an effective field theory that
describes the Pomeranchuck transition in isotropic two-dimensional Fermi
liquids. We find that the transition is triggered by the softening of an
eigenmode that leads to spontaneous Fermi surface distortion. The resultant
theory in terms of this critical mode has dynamical critical exponent $z = 2$
and the upper critical dimension is $d_c = 4-z= 2$. As a result the system is
at the upper critical dimension in 2D, resulting in a Gaussian fixed point with
a marginally irrelevant quartic perturbation.

High aspect ratio oblate polygonal gold crystals - such as triangular and
hexagonal platelets - have attracted considerable interest due to their
extraordinary physical, chemical, and mechanical properties. Commonly referred
to as "gold flakes," these structures exhibit atomically flat surfaces,
$\mu$m$^2$ areas with nanometric thickness, and a monocrystalline morphology.
Since their first discovery by John Turkevich in 1951, considerable progress
has been made in shape-controlled synthesis and large-scale production,
unlocking steadily new opportunities for ever more advanced applications. This
review explores large-area gold flakes with lateral dimensions spanning from
hundreds of nanometers to millimeters, emphasizing their unique properties. We
provide a comprehensive overview of key developments, from early discoveries,
synthesis approaches, and fabrication techniques to recent breakthroughs.
Emphasis is placed on the integration of gold flake as functional building
blocks in photonics (e.g., for nanoantennas), sensing, nanoelectronics,
biomedicine, and beyond. We conclude with a discussion of emerging roles and
future developments of this unique class of materials.

### Ferroelectricity-driven altermagnetism in two-dimensional van der Waals multiferroics

- **TL;DR**: 本文提出了一种通过铁电极化和层间滑动控制二维多铁材料中交变磁性的有效策略，在FeCuP2S6材料中实现了可逆的自旋分裂开关。

Altermagnets (AMs) are a recently identified class of unconventional
collinear compensated antiferromagnets that exhibit momentum-dependent spin
splitting despite having zero net magnetization. This unconventional magnetic
order gives rise to a range of phenomena, including the anomalous Hall effect,
chiral magnons, and nonlinear photocurrents. Here, using spin space group (SSG)
symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations, we demonstrate an
efficient strategy to control altermagnetism in two-dimensional multiferroics
through ferroelectric polarization and interlayer sliding. For material
realization, we find that monolayer and bilayer FeCuP2S6 exhibit finite spin
splitting when ferroelectric sublattices are connected by nonsymmorphic
screw-axis operations rather than pure translation or inversion symmetry.
Interlayer sliding further enables reversible switching or suppression of spin
splitting through modifications of the SSG. Our calculations further reveal
that the anomalous Hall response serves as a direct probe of these spin-split
states. These findings establish two-dimensional van der Waals multiferroics as
promising platforms for realizing electrically controllable altermagnetism and
advancing next-generation spintronic and magnetoelectric technologies.

### Emergence of charge-2$e$ bosonic carriers and pseudogaps in the dynamics of residual electrons

- **TL;DR**: 该研究通过量子蒙特卡洛模拟证明，即使在存在低能电子的情况下，吸引Hubbard模型中也会出现电荷2e的玻色子束缚对，并导致非费米液体行为。

Emergence of charge-2$e$ bosonic carriers as tightly bound electrons presents
perhaps the simplest route to understand the non-Fermi liquid behaviors widely
observed in functional materials. However, such scenario is typically discarded
when unbound electrons are observed near the chemical potential. Here, using
attractive Hubbard model as a representative example, we demonstrate the
emergence of such ''bosonic'' bound pairs in the presence of residual
low-energy electrons through determinant quantum Monte Carlo computation of
their propagators. Furthermore, above the superfluid temperature the electronic
spectral function is found to display a typical non-Fermi liquid behavior,
namely a pseudogap near the chemical potential. This study provides the
microscopic foundation for scenarios of boson-fermion mixed liquid as effective
descriptions for some of the strongly correlated functional materials.

Twisted graphene layers exhibit extremely low friction for relative sliding.
Nevertheless, previous studies suggest that the area contribution to friction
for commensurate moir\'e systems is finite and might restrict macroscopic
superlubricity for large layer overlaps. In this paper, we investigate the
potential energy surface (PES) for relative displacement of the layers forming
moir\'e patterns (2,1) and (3,1) by accurate density functional theory
calculations using the vdW-DF3 functional. The amplitudes of PES corrugations
on the order of 0.4 and 0.03 $\mu$eV per atom of one layer, respectively, are
obtained. The account of structural relaxation doubles this value for the (2,1)
pattern, while causing only minimal changes for the (3,1) pattern. We show that
different from aligned graphene layers, for moir\'e patterns, PES minima and
maxima can switch their positions upon changing the interlayer distance. The
PES shape is closely described by the first spatial Fourier harmonics both with
and without account of structural relaxation. A barrier for relative rotation
of the layers to an incommensurate state that can make superlubricity robust is
estimated based on the approximated PES. We also derive a set of measurable
physical properties related to interlayer interaction including shear mode
frequency, shear modulus and static friction force. Furthermore, we predict
that it should be possible to observe domain walls separating commensurate
domains, each comprising a large number of moir\'e pattern unit cells, and
provide estimates of their characteristics.

Antiperovskite (APV) nitrides exhibit a diverse range of electronic
properties, including superconductivity, magnetic effects, and nontrivial
topological behaviors. In this study, we propose a new family of APV nitrides
by incorporating 4$f$-electron metals, known for strong electron correlations,
localized magnetic moments, and spin-orbit coupling, to further explore the
unique properties of APVs. A high-throughput density functional theory (DFT)
calculation was utilized to identify stable lanthanide APV nitride compounds.
To address the challenge of strong electron correlation, we developed a
double-screening framework that assumes either a fully itinerant or localized
nature of the $f$-electrons during calculations. Using this approach, we
systematically identified 37 stable lanthanide APV nitride compounds from both
thermodynamic and dynamical perspectives. Furthermore, we report nontrivial
topological behaviors observed among these stable lanthanide APV nitride
compounds, as computed by DFT. Notably, Dirac and semi-Dirac cones are observed
near the Fermi level for Er$_3$TlN. This study opens a pathway to investigate
lanthanide APVs, revealing potential novel physical properties by leveraging
the rich physics of both APVs and $f$-electrons.

### The Quantum Self-Consistent Harmonic Approximation: A Unified Framework for Quantum Spin System

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种量子自洽谐波近似(QSCHA)方法，消除了传统SCHA中的半经典假设，通过自旋相干态形式构建完全量子化框架，改进了对量子系统的描述精度。

The Self-Consistent Harmonic Approximation (SCHA) has been utilized to
investigate quantum and thermal phase transitions within magnetic models and,
more recently, in spintronic applications. The SCHA methodology involves
utilizing simple harmonic Hamiltonians, which are augmented with
renormalization parameters that incorporate high-order fluctuations typically
overlooked by conventional Linear Spin-Wave (LSW) theories. Although this
approach exhibits reasonable accuracy for models defined by large spin values,
its reliability diminishes when applied to quantum systems with $S=1/2$. The
traditional development of SCHA has incorporated semiclassical assumptions that
obscure quantum effects. In this study, we introduce a quantum framework for
the SCHA that eliminates the need for semiclassical approximations. Our Quantum
Self-Consistent Harmonic Approximation (QSCHA) utilizes the spin coherent
states formalism within a fully quantum formulation. Consequently, we derive a
novel renormalization parameter that accurately integrates quantum corrections.
To assess the efficacy of this new approach, we apply the QSCHA to analyze the
critical temperature transitions across various well-documented magnetic
models. The findings, combined with the simplified operational procedure
relative to other conventional interacting spin-wave methodologies, suggest
that QSCHA is a promising tool for advancing research in quantum magnetism and
spintronics.

### Machine-learned tuning to protected states by probing noise resilience

- **TL;DR**: 提出一种基于机器学习的调谐方法，通过向系统注入噪声并直接搜索最具噪声鲁棒性的配置，来寻找量子系统中的受保护状态。

Protected states are promising for quantum technologies due to their
intrinsic resilience against noise. However, such states often emerge at
discrete points or small regions in parameter space and are thus difficult to
find in experiments. In this work, we present a machine-learning method for
tuning to protected regimes, based on injecting noise into the system and
searching directly for the most noise-resilient configuration. We illustrate
this method by considering short quantum dot-based Kitaev chains which we
subject to random parameter fluctuations. Using the covariance matrix
adaptation evolutionary strategy we minimize the typical resulting ground state
splitting, which makes the system converge to a protected configuration with
well-separated Majorana bound states. We verify the robustness of our method by
considering finite Zeeman fields, electron-electron repulsion, asymmetric
couplings, and varying the length of the Kitaev chain. Our work provides a
reliable method for tuning to protected states, including but not limited to
isolated Majorana bound states.

### A CN complex as an alternative to the T center in Si

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种无氢的碳氮(CN)杂质复合物作为T中心的等电子替代品，用于量子信息科学应用，解决了T中心对氢敏感的缺陷。

We present a first-principles study of a carbon-nitrogen (CN) impurity
complex in silicon as an isoelectronic alternative to the T center
[(CCH)$_\mathrm{Si}$]. The latter has been pursued for applications in quantum
information science, yet its sensitivity to the presence of hydrogen is still
problematic. Our proposed complex has no hydrogen, thereby eliminating this
issue. First, we show that the CN complex is stable against decomposition into
substitutional and interstitial defects. Next, we show that due to being
isoelectronic to the T center, the CN complex has a similar electronic
structure, and therefore could be used in similar applications. We assess
several low-energy configurations of the CN complex, finding (CN)$_\mathrm{Si}$
to be stable and have the largest Debye-Waller factor. We predict a zero-phonon
line (ZPL) of 828 meV (in the telecom S-band) and a radiative lifetime of 4.2
$\mu$s, comparable to the T center. Due to the presence of a bound exciton,
choice of the exchange-correlation functional and also supercell-size scaling
of the ZPL and transition dipole moment require special scrutiny; we rigorously
justify our extrapolation schemes that allow computing values in the dilute
limit.

### Quantum Acoustics Demystifies the Strange Metals

Phonons have long been thought to be incapable of explaining key phenomena in
strange metals, including linear-in-\textit{T} Planckian resistivity from high
to very low temperatures. We argue that these conclusions were based on static,
perturbative approaches that overlooked essential time-dependent and
nonperturbative electron-lattice physics. In fact ``phonons'' are not the best
target for discussion, just like ``photons'' are not the best way to think
about Maxwell's equations. Quantum optics connects photons and
electromagnetism, as developed 60 years ago by Glauber and others. We have been
developing the parallel world of quantum acoustics. Far from being only of
academic interest, the new tools are rapidly exposing the secrets of the
strange metals, revealing strong vibronic (vibration-electronic) interactions
playing a crucial role forming polarons and charge density waves, linear-in-$T$
resistivity at the Planckian rate over thousands of degrees, resolution of the
Drude peak infrared anomaly, and the absence of a $T^4$ low-temperature
resistivity rise in 2D systems, and of a Mott-Ioffe-Regel resistivity
saturation. We derive Planckian transport, polarons, CDWs, and pseudogaps from
the Fr\"ohlich model. The ``new physics'' has been hiding in this model all
along, in the right parameter regime, if it is treated nonperturbatively. In
the course of this work we have uncovered the generalization of Anderson
localization to dynamic media: a universal Planckian diffusion emerges, a
``ghost'' of Anderson localization. Planckian diffusion is clearly defined and
is more fundamental than the popular but elusive, model dependent concept of
``Planckian speed limit''.

Recent advances in Kitaev materials have highlighted their potential to host
Majorana fermions without or high-temperature of superconductivity. In this
research, we propose $Li_2IrO_3$ as a promising High-temperature
superconducting platform supporting Majorana edge modes due to its strong
spin-orbit coupling, honeycomb lattice structure, and proximity to a quantum
spin liquid (QSL) phase. A theoretical and numerical framework based on the
Kitaev-Heisenberg Hamiltonian is developed to model spin interactions in
$Li_2IrO_3$. Here, the existence of topological zero-energy states is
demonstrated, and their signatures in the edge-localized spectral weight are
identified. A device concept based on this material is also proposed with
potential industrial applications in spintronics, magnetic field sensing, and
topological quantum memory.

### Characterising Atomic-Scale Surface Disorder on 2D Materials Using Neutral Atoms

- **TL;DR**: 使用扫描氦显微镜(SHeM)研究二维MoS2表面清洁度，发现即使微量碳污染也会导致原子级无序，平坦区域比边缘区域更容易被污染。

Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), such as MoS2,
have the potential to be widely used in electronic devices and sensors due to
their high carrier mobility and tunable band structure. In 2D TMD devices,
surface and interface cleanness can critically impact the performance and
reproducibility. Even sample surfaces prepared under ultra-high vacuum (UHV)
can be contaminated, causing disorder. On such samples, trace levels of
submonolayer contamination remain largely overlooked, and conventional surface
characterisation techniques have limited capability in detecting such
adsorbates. Here, we apply scanning helium microscopy (SHeM), a non-destructive
and ultra-sensitive technique, to investigate the surface cleanness of 2D MoS2.
Our measurements reveal that even minute amounts of adventitious carbon induce
atomic-scale disorder across MoS2 surfaces, leading to the disappearance of
helium diffraction. By tracking helium reflectivity over time, we quantify the
decay of surface order across different microscopic regions and find that flat
areas are more susceptible to contamination than regions near edges. These
findings highlight the fragility of surface order in 2D materials, even under
UHV, and establish SHeM as a powerful tool for non-damaging microscopic 2D
material cleanness characterisation. The approach offers a new route to
wafer-scale characterisation of 2D material quality.

- **TL;DR**: 通过纳秒电压脉冲在磁性涡旋中实现Floquet工程化磁子频率梳的确定性控制，可编程地启动或抑制频率梳，实现高相位稳定性的自振荡或按需返回静态基态。

Frequency combs represent a hallmark of coherence emerging from nonlinear
dynamics, where periodic driving organizes energy into a precisely spaced
spectral structure. Extending this concept to collective excitations in solids
such as magnons, the quanta of spin waves in magnetically ordered materials,
offers a powerful route to control energy flow, coherence, and information
processing in condensed matter systems. Here, we demonstrate deterministic
control of Floquet-engineered magnon frequency combs in magnetic vortices using
nanosecond voltage pulses. By tuning the pulse duration and timing, we control
the nonlinear energy transfer between magnons and the vortex core, enabling the
Floquet-engineered initiation or suppression of magnon frequency combs far
below their spontaneous instability threshold. This pulse-programmable
interaction allows the vortex to sustain magnon-driven auto-oscillation with
high phase stability, or to revert to its static ground state on demand. Our
results establish vortex-based magnetic systems as a robust solid-state
platform for Floquet engineering, bridging nonlinear spin dynamics with
frequency conversion and coherent spin-based quantum devices.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种使用超薄ALD硅氧化物界面层调控AOS晶体管阈值电压的方法，可在低温工艺下实现多级VT控制并提升器件可靠性。

We demonstrate a gate dielectric engineering approach leveraging an
ultrathin, atomic layer deposited (ALD) silicon oxide interfacial layer (SiL)
between the amorphous oxide semiconductor (AOS) channel and the high-k gate
dielectric. SiL positively shifts the threshold voltage (V$_T$) of AOS
transistors, providing at least four distinct $V_T$ levels with a maximum
increase of 500 mV. It achieves stable $V_T$ control without significantly
degrading critical device parameters such as mobility, on-state current, all
while keeping the process temperature below 225 $^{\circ}$C and requiring no
additional heat treatment to activate the dipole. Positive-bias temperature
instability tests at 85 $^{\circ}$C indicate a significant reduction in
negative $V_{T}$ shifts for SiL-integrated devices, highlighting enhanced
reliability. Incorporating this SiL gate stack into two-transistor gain-cell
(GC) memory maintains a more stable storage node voltage ($V_{SN}$) (reduces
$V_{SN}$ drop by 67\%), by limiting unwanted charge losses. SiL-engineered GCs
also reach retention times up to 10,000 s at room temperature and reduce
standby leakage current by three orders of magnitude relative to baseline
device, substantially lowering refresh energy consumption.

Fermi arcs in Weyl semimetals provide a unique platform for surface-state
engineering, yet di rectly tracking of their evolution under surface tuning
remains experimentally challenging. Here we
  theoretically propose that nonreciprocal charge transport can serve as a
direct probe of Fermi arc
  Lifshitz transitions (FALT). We show that different surface terminations in
Co3Sn2S2 can produce
  f
  inite and highly tunable second-order nonreciprocal signals, which can be
further modulated by
  adjusting the surface potential. Strikingly, we show that the second-order
conductivity exhibits sign
  changes as the Fermi arc connectivity is tuned across FALT driven by gating
or chemical potential
  variation. This behavior arises from the chiral nature of electron velocities
on the Fermi arcs, and is
  highly sensitive to surface termination and symmetry breaking. Our findings
establish nonreciprocal
  transport as an electrically measurable fingerprint of FALT and propose new
strategies that could be
  directly applied in devices for in situ engineering and detecting transport
properties in topological
  materials.

Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters are essential for
next-generation, high-efficiency organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), yet
their rational design is hampered by the high computational cost of accurate
excited-state predictions. Here, we present a comprehensive benchmark study
validating semi-empirical extended tight-binding (xTB) methods -- specifically
sTDA-xTB and sTD-DFT-xTB -- for the high-throughput screening of TADF
materials. Using an unprecedentedly large dataset of \num{747} experimentally
characterized emitters, our framework demonstrates a computational cost
reduction of over \qty{99}{\percent} compared to conventional TD-DFT, while
maintaining strong internal consistency between methods (Pearson $r \approx
\num{0.82}$ for \deltaest), validating their utility for relative molecular
ranking. Validation against \num{312} experimental \deltaest values reveals a
mean absolute error of approximately \qty{0.17}{\electronvolt}, a discrepancy
attributed to the vertical approximation inherent to the HTS protocol,
underscoring the methods' role in screening rather than quantitative
prediction. Through large-scale data analysis, we statistically validate key
design principles, confirming the superior performance of Donor-Acceptor-Donor
(D-A-D) architectures and identifying an optimal D-A torsional angle range of
\qtyrange{50}{90}{\degree} for efficient TADF. Principal Component Analysis
reveals that the complex property space is fundamentally low-dimensional, with
three components capturing nearly \qty{90}{\percent} of the variance. This work
establishes these semi-empirical methods as powerful, cost-effective tools for
accelerating TADF discovery and provides a robust set of data-driven design
rules and methodological guidelines for the computational materials science
community.

We probe the broadband nonlinear magnetization dynamics of a high-quality
magnetic sphere under a strong microwave drive using microwave spectroscopy. We
observe a \textit{Fano resonance} in the microwave transmission when the driven
amplitude of the magnetization is large and the drive frequency $\omega_d$ is
close to but not at the ferromagnetic resonance. When the drive frequency is
very close to the ferromagnetic resonance, the microwave transmission splits
into two absorption dips. We interpret the unexpected Fano resonance by a
scattering theory of photons considering the three-magnon interaction between
the Kittel magnon and magnon pairs with opposite wave vectors of frequency
$\omega_d/2$. The theoretical model suggests that the microwave spectroscopy
measures the dynamics of the fluctuation $\delta \hat{\alpha}$ of the Kittel
magnon and $\delta\hat{\beta}_{\pm k}$ of the magnon pairs over the driven
steady states, which are coupled coherently by the steady-state amplitudes.
When the damping of $\delta\hat{\beta}_{\pm k}$ is much smaller than that of
$\delta \hat{\alpha}$, the theoretical calculation can well reproduce the
observed Fano resonance. Mode fluctuations with a low damping should be useful
for quantum information and logic operations in future magnonic devices.

Altermagnetism is a recently identified phase with a d, g or i-wave spin
symmetry of magnetic ordering. Its discovery opens new research fronts at
intersections of magnetism and spintronics with fields ranging from
superconductivity to topological and relativistic quantum physics. Here we
demonstrate an unconventional relativistic spin polarization in an altermagnet
by spin and angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy of electronic bands in
single-domain MnTe. The relativistic spin-orbit coupling origin is revealed by
observing that the alternating momentum-dependent spin polarization is
orthogonal to the magnetic-ordering vector. The collinearity, even-parity and
time-reversal-odd nature of the demonstrated relativistic spin polarization in
the altermagnet is unparalleled in conventional forms of the relativistic spin
polarization. Our experimental results and methodology are supported by
non-relativistic spin-symmetry and relativistic magnetic-symmetry analyses, and
microscopic ab initio ground-state and photoemission theory.

- **TL;DR**: 研究了铁电纳米线阵列的畴结构、电卡效应和负电容状态，发现尺寸效应和偶极相互作用决定了阵列的稳定性，通过调控介质环境可优化负电容和电卡响应。

We analyzed the domain morphology, electrocaloric response, and negative
capacitance states in a one-dimensional array of uniformly oriented, radial
symmetric ferroelectric nanowires, whose spontaneous polarization is normal to
their symmetry axis. The wires are densely packed between flat electrodes.
Using finite element modeling based on the Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire approach,
electrostatics, and elasticity theory, we calculated the distributions of
spontaneous polarization, domain structures, electric potential, electric
field, dielectric permittivity, and electrocaloric response in the nanowires.
Due to size and depolarization effects, the paraelectric and ferroelectric
(poly-domain or single-domain) states of the wires can be stable, depending on
their radius and the dielectric permittivity of the surrounding medium. It is
demonstrated that dipole-dipole interaction between the nanowires determines
the stability of the polar (or anti-polar) state in the array when the wire
radius is significantly smaller than the critical size of the paraelectric
transition in an isolated wire. We reveal that a large region of a mixed state,
characterized by poly-domain ferroelectric states with nonzero average
polarization inside each wire and zero average polarization of the whole array,
can be stable. By selecting the dielectric permittivity of the surrounding
medium and the nanowire radius, one can maximize the negative capacitance
effect in the capacitor with densely packed wires. It is also possible to
achieve maximal enhancement of the electrocaloric response due to size effects
in the wires. The underlying physics of the predicted enhancement is the
combined action of size effects and the long-range electrostatic interactions
between the ferroelectric dipoles in the nanowires and the image charges in the
electrodes

Materials which show a strong time-reversal symmetry-breaking response
leading to spin-polarization phenomena, in conjunction with antiparallel
magnetic alignments producing zero net magnetization, have recently been
identified, classified, and been given the name 'altermagnets'. However,
measuring and diagnosing possible candidates as altermagnetics still remains a
challenge. From the uncertainty of the material being an altermagnet,
additional experimental probes are essential to resolve this. Here, we propose
using spin-dependent and magnetic momentum density probes such as
spin-polarised positron annihilation and revisiting magnetic Compton
scattering. By looking at the previously claimed altermagnetic candidates RuO2,
CrSb and MnTe, we present theoretical altermagnetic calculations of the
experimental quantities measured by these probes. We show that these quantities
should produce a measurable signal and unequivocally confirm the altermagnetic
state. We also highlight the additional benefits from these probes such as
extracting spin-resolved Fermi surfaces which are key for further understanding
the nature of the altermagnetic state.

- **TL;DR**: 研究了最小扭曲双层石墨烯中的温度依赖性电输运，发现线性温度电阻率与纵向声子散射过程相关，这种散射在莫尔材料中主导电阻率。

The electronic and vibrational properties of 2D materials are dramatically
altered by the formation of a moir\'e superlattice. The lowest-energy phonon
modes of the superlattice are two acoustic branches (called phasons) that
describe the sliding motion of one layer with respect to the other. Considering
their low-energy dispersion and damping, these modes may act as a significant
source of scattering for electrons in moir\'e materials. Here, we investigate
temperature-dependent electrical transport in minimally twisted bilayer
graphene, a moir\'e system developing multiple weakly-dispersive electronic
bands and a reconstructed lattice structure. We measure a linear-in-temperature
resistivity across the band manyfold above $T\sim{10}$ K, preceded by a
quadratic temperature dependence. While the linear-in-temperature resistivity
is up to two orders of magnitude larger than in monolayer graphene, it is
reduced (approximately by a factor of three) with respect to magic-angle
twisted bilayer graphene. Moreover, it is modulated by the recursive band
filling, with minima located close to the full filling of each band. Comparing
our results with a semiclassical transport calculation, we show that the
experimental trends are compatible with scattering processes mediated by
longitudinal phasons, which dominate the resistivity over the contribution from
conventional acoustic phonons of the monolayer. Our findings highlight the
close relation between vibrational modes unique to moir\'e materials and
carrier transport therein.

- **TL;DR**: 本文开发了一个微观量子框架来解释振动强耦合下的拉曼散射，发现拉曼响应取决于腔模与振动模式的空间重叠程度。

Resonant coupling of a vibration to a cavity mode has been reported to
dramatically modify spontaneous Raman scattering, but subsequent studies have
produced conflicting results. In this Letter, we develop a microscopic quantum
framework that captures the spatial structure of polaritonic modes. In a
homogeneously filled cavity, spatial overlap between polaritons and cavity
resonances enforces selection rules that suppress the initially reported
polaritonic Raman peaks, consistent with most experiments. In contrast, for a
quasi-two-dimensional (2d) molecular layer, these rules are lifted, yielding
Raman peaks at the polariton energies. Our work clarifies that the Raman
response under vibrational strong coupling is determined by cavity-vibration
spatial mode overlap and offers a framework for Raman studies of strongly
coupled quasi-2d systems.

### Machine learning descriptors for predicting the high temperature oxidation of refractory complex concentrated alloys

Refractory Complex Concentrated Alloys (RCCAs) can exhibit exceptional
high-temperature strength, making such alloys promising candidates for
high-temperature structural applications. However, current RCCAs do not possess
the high-temperature oxidation resistance required to survive in oxidizing
environments for more than a few hours at or above 1000$^\circ$C, without
relying primarily on an environmental barrier coating. Here, we present a
machine-learning framework designed to predict the oxidation-induced specific
mass changes of RCCAs exposed for 24 h at 1000$^\circ$C in air, in order to
support the search for oxidation-resistant alloys over a wide range of
compositions. A database was constructed of experimental specific mass change
data, upon oxidation at 900-1000$^\circ$C for 24 h in air, for 77 compositions
comprised of simple elements, binary alloys, and higher-order elemental
systems. We then developed a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model with
physics-informed descriptors based on oxidation products, capturing the
fundamental chemistry of oxide formation and stability. Application of this GPR
model to the database yielded a MAE (mean absolute error) test score of 5.78
mg/cm$^2$, which was a significant improvement in accuracy relative to models
only utilizing traditional alloy-based descriptors. Our model was used to
screen over 5,100 quaternary RCCAs, revealing compositions with significantly
lower predicted specific mass changes compared to existing literature sources.
Overall, this work establishes a versatile and efficient strategy to accelerate
the discovery of next-generation RCCAs with enhanced resistance to extreme
environments.

### Modulation of Quantum Transport in Complex Oxide Heterostructures with Proton Implantation

The interfacial electronic properties of complex oxides are governed by a
delicate balance between charge transfer, lattice distortions, and electronic
correlations, posing a key challenge for controlled tunability in materials
research. Here, we demonstrate that proton implantation serves as a precise
tool for modulating interfacial transport in SrTiO3-based heterostructures. By
introducing protons into the SrTiO3 substrate beneath an amorphous
(La,Sr)(Al,Ta)O3 capping layer, we uncover a competition between disorder and
charge doping induced by implantation. At low implantation fluences below
1x1015 protons/cm2 (1E15), charge doping dominates, leading to an increase in
carrier density and mobility, analogous to electrostatic gating effect. This
enables the emergence of quantum transport oscillations at low temperature.
Conversely, at higher fluences (above 1E15), disorder scattering prevails,
suppressing carrier mobility and inducing an insulating state. The nonmonotonic
evolution of transport with implantation fluence underscores the critical
interplay between electronic correlations and disorder, offering a new paradigm
for the controlled engineering of interfacial quantum states in SrTiO3-based
oxide heterostructures.

### Finite-frequency admittance and noise of a helical edge coupled to a magnet

The exchange coupling of the helical edge state of a quantum spin-Hall
insulator with an easy-plane magnet has no effect on its DC electrical
conductance if the magnet's anisotropy axis is aligned with the spin
quantization axis of the helical edge state [Meng et al., Phys. Rev. B 90,
205403 (2014)]. We here calculate the AC conductance $G_V(\omega)$ and the
noise power $S_V(\omega)$ in the presence of a DC bias $V$. While both take the
universal values $G_V({\omega = 0}) = e^2/h$ and $S_V(\omega = 0) = 4 e^2
k_{\rm B} T/h$ in the zero-frequency limit, $G_V(\omega)$ and $S_V(\omega)$ are
quickly suppressed for finite $\omega$, so that low-frequency transport is
effectively noiseless.

Charge carrier dynamics critically affect the efficiency and stability of
organic photovoltaic devices, but they are challenging to model with
traditional analytical methods. We introduce \b{eta}-Linearly Decoded Latent
Ordinary Differential Equations (\b{eta}-LLODE), a machine learning framework
that disentangles and reconstructs extraction dynamics from time-resolved
charge extraction measurements of P3HT:PCBM cells. This model enables the
isolated analysis of the underlying charge carrier behaviour, which was found
to be well described by a compressed exponential decay. Furthermore, the learnt
interpretable latent space enables simulation, including both interpolation and
extrapolation of experimental measurement conditions, offering a predictive
tool for solar cell research to support device study and optimisation.

Thermoelectric materials with a high figure of merit (ZT) are highly demanded
for a sustainable solution to the energy crisis. In this study, we have
predicted three new double perovskite oxides (DPOs), Ba2GaXO6 (X = V, Nb, Ta),
with high ZT values using density functional theory (DFT) calculations and
investigated their structural, electronic, thermoelectric, and mechanical
properties. The electronic properties, such as electronic band structure,
density of states (DOS), and charge density mapping, are used to disclose the
conductive nature, chemical bonding within these compounds, which exhibit
direct band gaps of 0.924, 2.354, and 3.279 eV for Ba2GaVO6, Ba2GaNbO6, and
Ba2GaTaO6, respectively, as calculated using the TB mBJ potential. The
thermoelectric performance of the new DPOs, Ba2GaXO6 (X = V, Nb, Ta), was
assessed using the BoltzTrap2 code, which yielded outstanding ZT values of
2.36, 1.78, and 1.91 at 1500 K for Ba2GaVO6, Ba2GaNbO6, and Ba2GaTaO6,
respectively, indicating their potential for waste heat management. The high ZT
values are attributed to an ultra low lattice thermal conductivity, arising
from strong scattering of acoustic and optical phonon modes. The changes in
thermoelectric parameters with temperature were analyzed and explained.

Coherent ferrons, the quanta of polarization waves, can potentially be
hybridized with many other quasiparticles for achieving novel control
modalities in quantum communication, computing, and sensing. Here, we
theoretically demonstrate a new hybridized state resulting from the strong
coupling between fundamental-mode (wavenumber is zero) coherent ferrons and
cavity bulk acoustic phonons. Using a van der Waals ferroelectric CuInP2S6
membrane as an example, we predict an ultra-strong ferron-phonon coupling at
room temperature, where the coupling strength g_c reaches over 10% of the
resonant frequency {\omega}_0. We also predict an in-situ electric-field-driven
bistable control of mode-specific ferron-phonon hybridization via ferroelectric
switching. We further show that, CuInP2S6 allows for reaching the fundamentally
intriguing but challenging deep strong coupling regime (i.e., g_c/{\omega}_0&gt;1)
near the ferroelectric-to-paraelectric phase transition. Our findings establish
the theoretical basis for exploiting coherent ferrons as a new contender for
hybrid quantum system with strong and highly tunable coherent coupling.

This study uses angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to examine the
low-temperature electronic structure of Cs(V$_{0.95}$Nb$_{0.05}$)$_3$Sb$_5$,
demonstrating that partially substituting V atoms with isoelectronic Nb atoms
results in \blue{an increase of the band width} and enhanced gap opening at the
Dirac-like crossings due to the resulting chemical pressure. This increases the
magnetic circular dichroism signal in the angular distribution (MCDAD) compared
to CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, enabling detailed analysis of magnetic circular dichroism in
several bands near the Fermi level. These results \blue{substantiate} the
predicted coupling of orbital magnetic moments to three van Hove singularities
near the Fermi level at M points. Previous studies have observed that Nb doping
\blue{lowers the charge density transition temperature} and increases the
critical temperature for superconductivity. This article demonstrates that Nb
doping concomitantly increases the magnetic circular dichroism signal
attributed to orbital moments.

While defects are unavoidable in crystals and often detrimental to material
performance, they can be a key ingredient for inducing functionalities when
tailored. Here, we demonstrate that an A-site-deficient perovskite
Y$_{1/3}$TaO$_3$ exhibits room-temperature ferroelectricity in a $Pb2_1m$
phase, enabled by ordered vacancies coupled with TaO$_6$ octahedral rotations.
Defect-ordered perovskites are frequently trapped in centrosymmetric
incommensurate states due to competing structural instabilities; we circumvent
this by favoring rotational over polar instability through compositional
selection. Unlike canonical improper ferroelectrics that are
\textit{ferrielectric}, the vanishing dipoles on vacancy layers in
Y$_{1/3}$TaO$_3$ allow for a net ferroelectric alignment of local dipoles,
resulting in enhanced polarization. Upon heating, Y$_{1/3}$TaO$_3$ transforms
to a paraelectric incommensurate phase at $\simeq$750 K, whose atomic
arrangement mirrors the domain topology observed in hybrid improper
ferroelectrics. Superspace analysis of the modulated phase reveals a route to
improve room-temperature polarization, achieved through epitaxial strain, as
confirmed by our lattice-dynamics calculations. This defect-ordering strategy
should be generalizable to other improper ferroelectrics, including
magnetoelectric multiferroics, providing a pathway to amplify otherwise limited
macroscopic polarization.

### Low-field magnetization processes of hexagonal easy-plane altermagnet $α$-MnTe

Single crystals of $\alpha$-MnTe were synthesized by chemical vapor transport
using iodine as the transport reagent. Structural characterization by powder
x-ray diffraction confirmed the hexagonal structure (space group P6$_{3}$/mmc).
Magnetization $M(T)$ and specific heat $C_p(T)$ measurements revealed an
antiferromagnetic phase transition at $T_N \approx307$ K. The magnetic entropy
derived from the $C_p(T)$ data is consistent with the $S = 5/2$ spin state of
Mn$^{2+}$ ions. Angle- and field-dependent magnetization measurements indicate
complex magnetic responses associated with domains, and show an anomaly around
1 T. These features are analyzed using a phenomenological micromagnetic model
that includes higher-order anisotropic exchange interactions coupling the weak
ferromagnetic component and the antiferromagnetic order parameter. The model
captures the generic behavior of magnetic states and demonstrates that the
observed uniaxial and unidirectional anisotropies arise from metastable domain
configurations and irreversible magnetization processes.

The interaction between cation diffusion and polyanion rotational dynamics
has garnered significant attention, yet characterizing the rotational dynamics
of polyanions remains challenging. Previous studies have primarily relied on
complex techniques such as Nuclear Magnetic Resonance and Quasi-Elastic Neutron
Scattering. In this work, we use ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD)
simulations and temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy to investigate the
reorientational dynamics of the NO2- polyanion in Na3ONO2 and NaNO2. Our
findings reveal distinct reorientational behaviors and establish a clear
correlation between molecular reorientation and Raman spectral features in
polyanion-based solid electrolytes. AIMD simulations show that NO2- rotates
easily in Na3ONO2, while its rotational dynamics are hindered in NaNO2. Raman
spectroscopy confirms these results, with temperature-dependent shifts in the
internal vibrational modes of the polyanion. In Na3ONO2, the full width at half
maximum (FWHM) of these modes increases with temperature, while NaNO2 exhibits
a constant FWHM until a significant jump at the ordered-disordered phase
transition. These insights enhance our understanding of polyanion reorientation
and offer a framework for characterizing similar dynamics in other solid
electrolytes.

Heterogeneous catalysts based on Single Atom Alloys (SAA) play a significant

nanoparticles prepared under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions on model
Al2O3/NiAl(110) support. Employing a unique combination of surface sensitive
techniques - scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), infrared reflection
absorption spectroscopy (IRAS), molecular beams - and density functional theory
(DFT) calculations, we performed detailed structural characterization of these
systems at the microscopic level. We demonstrate that Pd disperses atomically
in Cu nanoparticles and becomes partly negatively charged. Importantly, these
Pd/Cu nanostructured systems show an outstanding catalytic performance in
selective dehydrogenation of butanol and exhibit 100 % selectivity toward
butanal over a broad range of Pd loadings - the property that cannot be
reproduced employing simplified single crystalline Pd/Cu(111) counterparts. The
developed approach for preparation and characterization of these nanostructured
SAA-catalysts lays a foundation for further fundamental-level catalytic studies
on this important class of materials and their rational design for practical
applications.

We introduce an automated workflow for generating non-empirical
Wannier-localized optimally-tuned screened range-separated hybrid (WOT-SRSH)
functionals. WOT-SRSH functionals have been shown to yield highly accurate
fundamental band gaps, band structures, and optical spectra for bulk and 2D
semiconductors and insulators. Our workflow automatically and efficiently
determines the WOT-SRSH functional parameters for a given crystal structure and
composition, approximately enforcing the correct screened long-range Coulomb
interaction and an ionization potential ansatz. In contrast to previous manual
tuning approaches, our tuning procedure relies on a new search algorithm that
only requires a few hybrid functional calculations with minimal user input. We
demonstrate our workflow on 23 previously studied semiconductors and
insulators, reporting the same high level of accuracy. By automating the tuning
process and improving its computational efficiency, the approach outlined here
enables applications of the WOT-SRSH functional to compute spectroscopic and
optoelectronic properties for a wide range of materials.

We introduce the intrinsic nonlinear planar thermal Hall effect (NPTHE)-- a
dissipationless thermal response proportional to $(\nabla T)^2B$, which arises
when the temperature gradient $\nabla T$ and magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$ lie
within the same plane. The effect originates from a thermal gradient induced
correction to the Berry curvature, characterized by the thermal Berry
connection polarizability (TBCP) tensor, leading to a nonlinear transverse heat
current independent of scattering time. A symmetry analysis shows that the
intrinsic NPTHE is permitted only in noncentrosymmetric crystal point groups
lacking horizontal mirror symmetry. Using a tilted Dirac model, we demonstrate
that its characteristic angular dependence provides an effective means to
control the nonlinear thermal response. Our results establish a new class of
quantum geometry driven intrinsic nonlinear thermal transport, offering both a
sensitive probe of band geometry and a pathway toward nonlinear thermal
functionalities in quantum materials.

Strong coupling among spontaneous structural symmetric breaking, magnetism
and metallicity in an intrinsic polar magnetic metal can give rise to novel
physical phenomena and holds great promise for applications in spintronics.
Here, we elucidate the mechanism of metallic ferroelectricity in the recently
discovered polar metal Sr$_3$Co$_2$O$_7$. Our first-principles calculations
reveal that both the spontaneous ferroelectric displacements and the
metallicity originate from charge disproportionation of Co ions. This is
characterized by an inverted ligand-field splitting of the Co $t_2g$ orbitals
at one site, while the metallic behavior is preserved by the t$_2g$ orbitals at
both sites. The charge disproportionation stabilizes the asymmetric phase
Within the framework of the on-site Hubbard U interaction. We thus propose that
in related transition metal oxides, charge disproportionation within specific
orbitals can concurrently drive metallicity and ferroelectricity, enabling
strong coupling between these properties. More remarkably, this mechanism
allows for the coexistence of magnetism, as evidenced in Sr$_3$Co$_2$O$_7$. Our
findings highlight a promising avenue for realizing polar magnetic metals and
provide a new design principle for exploring multifunctional materials.

### Excitons in moiré superlattices with disordered electrons

Moir\'{e} superlattices in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs)
heterobilayers exhibit various correlated insulating states driven by
long-range Coulomb interactions, and these states crucially alter exciton
resonances, particularly at fractional fillings. We revisit a theoretical
framework to investigate the doping dependence of exciton spectra by extending
hydrogenic exciton wavefunctions, systematically analyzing how the 1$s$, 2$s$,
and 3$s$ Rydberg states respond to moir\'e-induced mixing of $s$- and $p$-type
orbitals. Notably, while the 1$s$ state remains relatively robust against
doping, higher Rydberg excitons show strong redshifts and oscillator-strength
quenching near specific fractional fillings. We incorporate both defect-induced
quasi-ordering and thermal fluctuations to capture realistic device conditions,
employing a large supercell approach. By selectively randomizing a subset of
electrons or utilizing classical Monte Carlo simulations, we present direct
calculations of exciton spectra under varying defect densities and
temperatures. Our results emphasize how even moderate disorder or finite
temperature can partially or completely suppress characteristic moir\'{e}
exciton physics. Especially, we show how the 2$s$ exciton states respond to the
phase transition in correlated electron states. This comprehensive picture not
only clarifies recent experimental observations but also provides a framework
to guide the design of moir\'{e}-based optoelectronic devices.

Lithium niobate (LiNbO$_3$, LN) is a nonlinear optical material of high
interest for integrated photonics with applications ranging from optical
communications to quantum information processing. The performance of on-chip
devices based on thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) is presently limited by
fabrication imperfections such as sidewall surface roughness and geometry
inhomogeneities over the chip. Atomic layer etching (ALE) could potentially be
used to overcome these difficulties. Although an isotropic ALE process for LN
has been reported, performing LN fabrication completely with ALE faces several
challenges, including the lack of a directional ALE process for pattern
transfer and the redeposition of involatile compounds. Here, we report a
directional ALE process for LN consisting of sequential exposures of
HBr/BCl$_3$/Ar plasma for surface modification and Ar plasma for removal. The
HBr chemistry is found to decrease redeposition compared to F- and Cl-based
plasmas, which we attribute to the higher vapor pressures of Br-based products.
A grating pattern etched entirely by the process (total etch depth of 220 nm)
exhibits no aspect ratio dependent etching (ARDE) down to the smallest tested
gap of 150 nm, in contrast to ion milling in which ARDE manifests even at 300
nm gaps for the same etch depth. The HBr plasma chemistry is also found to
support an isotropic process consisting of sequential exposures of H$_2$ plasma
and HBr/BCl$_3$/Ar plasma. These processes could be used together to perform
the complete fabrication process for TFLN devices, eliminating imperfections
arising from ion milling.
