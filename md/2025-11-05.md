- **Categories**: physics.chem-ph, physics.atm-clus, physics.plasm-ph
- **TL;DR**: 开发了一种理论方法，将不同尺寸的团簇集合作为单一物种在气体中输运进行描述。主要假设是团簇之间存在局部部分化学平衡。研究发现，即使在原始分子物种输运中热扩散可忽略，在集体描述中热扩散也会成为重要因素。推导了有效扩散和热扩散系数的解析表达式，并应用于离心等离子化学反应器中的H2S转化技术。

A theoretical approach to describing transport of an entire ensemble of
clusters with different sizes as a single species in gas has been developed.
The major assumption is an existence of local partial chemical equilibrium
between the clusters. It is shown that thermal diffusion emerges in the
collective description as a significant factor even if it is negligible when
transport of the original molecular species is considered. Analytical
expressions for the effective diffusion and thermal diffusion coefficients at
temperature, pressure, and chemical composition gradients have been derived.
The theory has been applied to a technology of H2S conversion in a centrifugal
plasma-chemical reactor and has made it possible to account for sulfur clusters
in numerical process modeling.

- **TL;DR**: 使用Cornell型势能和双阱薛定谔方法研究氢键中的质子和氘核隧穿，提供半解析波函数和隧穿分裂，揭示同位素依赖的量子效应。

Hydrogen bonds play a pivotal role in chemistry, biology, and
condensed-matter physics, where quantum tunnelling can strongly influence
structure and dynamics. Isotope substitution (H $\rightarrow$ D) provides a
sensitive probe of such tunnelling, but theoretical descriptions often rely on
purely numerical models or simplified potentials that obscure physical
interpretation. Here we employ a Cornell-type potential combined with a
double-well Schr\"odinger approach to investigate proton and deuteron
tunnelling across hydrogen bonds. The model yields semi-analytical
wavefunctions and tunnelling splittings that transparently capture
isotope-dependent quantum effects. We present scaling behaviour of tunnelling
splittings with isotope mass, discuss the influence of barrier width and
curvature, and compare model trends with representative experimental and
computational results. Beyond hydrogen bonding, the framework provides a
general methodology for modelling tunnelling in double-well systems relevant to
spectroscopy, enzymatic catalysis, and materials applications.

### Benchmarking Proton Tunneling Splittings with a Wavefunction-Based Double-Well Model: Application to the Formic Acid Dimer

- **TL;DR**: 开发了一个基于波函数的框架，使用Cornell型双阱势来研究氢键隧穿分裂，并将其作为氢键隧穿的基准测试。

Proton tunneling across hydrogen bonds is a fundamental quantum effect with
implications for spectroscopy, catalysis, and biomolecular stability. While
state-of-the-art instanton and path-integral methods provide accurate
multidimensional tunneling splittings, simplified one-dimensional models remain
valuable as conceptual and benchmarking tools. Here we develop a
wavefunction-based framework for tunneling splittings using a Cornell-type
double-well potential and apply it as a benchmark for hydrogen-bond tunneling.
Analytical WKB estimates and numerical finite-difference solutions are compared
across a range of barrier parameters, showing consistent agreement. As a test
case, we map the formic acid dimer (FAD) barrier onto a quartic double-well
model parameterized to reproduce the reported barrier height of $V_b \\approx
2848~\\text{cm}^{-1}$. The resulting tunneling splitting of about
$0.037~\\text{cm}^{-1}$ matches the reduced-dimensional calculations of Qu and
Bowman. The close agreement between numerical and semiclassical results
highlights the pedagogical and diagnostic value of one-dimensional models,
while comparison with molecular benchmarks clarifies their limitations relative
to full multidimensional quantum treatments.

### Forbidden Electron Transfer in the Adiabatic Limit of the Marcus-Inverted Region

- **Authors**: Ethan Abraham
- **Categories**: physics.chem-ph, cond-mat.mes-hall, cond-mat.mtrl-sci, quant-ph
- **TL;DR**: 在凝聚相电子转移的绝热极限下，无势垒跃迁的起始点比非绝热Marcus理论预测的驱动力更低。在Marcus反转区的绝热极限中，等能电子转移在没有核隧穿的情况下被严格禁止，这是由于绝热和diabatic电子表面之间映射的拓扑变化导致的。

Here it is shown that in the adiabatic limit of condensed-phase electron
transfer, the onset of barrierless transition occurs at a lower driving force
than predicted by the non-adiabatic Marcus formulation. Furthermore, in the
adiabatic limit of the Marcus-inverted region, isoenergetic electron transfer
is strictly forbidden in the absence of nuclear tunneling. This "forbidden"
behavior arises from a topological change in the mapping between the adiabatic
and diabatic electronic surfaces, emerging precisely at the onset of the
Marcus-inverted region.

### Collective excitations and divergent spin currents in non-centrosymmetric superconductors

- **TL;DR**: 研究非中心对称超导体在激光照射下的集体模式，发现激光驱动不仅增强三次谐波响应，还增强自旋电流的二次谐波响应，提出了不包含带间跃迁的理论解释。

We study the collective modes in a non-centrosymmetric superconductor with
Rashba spin-orbit coupling under laser irradiation. The concept of Anderson
Pseudospin Resonance allows to reveal how laser driving gives rise not only to
the established resonant enhancement of the third harmonic response, but also
to a resonant enhancement in the second harmonic response of the spin current.
We propose a theory which explains the phenomenon without including interband
transitions. The theory is corroborated by numerical simulations which
incorporate interband effects and allow us to clarify the signatures of the
collective modes in the long-time dynamics of the superconductor.

### Marginal Fermi liquids from Fermi surfaces coupled via matrix boson gas

- **Title (EN)**: Marginal Fermi liquids from Fermi surfaces coupled via matrix boson gas
- **Authors**: Vibhu Mishra
- **Categories**: cond-mat.str-el
- **TL;DR**: 提出了一个金属临界点模型，在T=0和大N极限下研究。模型包含两种费米子和矩阵玻色子，通过类slave-boson相互作用耦合。在d=z+1维时，电子自能呈现边际费米液体行为。

We propose a model of metallic critical point which we study at $T=0$ in the
large-$N$ limit. We start with two species of fermions $c_i, f_i$, each with
$N$ flavors and matrix bosons $b_{ij}$ with $N^2$ components. They interact
with each other via slave-boson like interaction $\int b_{ij}^{\dagger} \,
c_i^{\dagger}f_j$. The bosons have a bare dispersion of
$\varepsilon_{\textbf{q}}^b = \lambda_z |\textbf{q}|^z$ and we study the
problem in $d$ spatial dimensions. We show that for $d = z+1,$ the electronic
self energy shows marginal Fermi liquid behavior. We first evaluate the
fermionic self energy $\Sigma(i\omega)$ using the standard approximate boson
self energy $\Pi(\textbf{q}, i\nu) \propto |\nu|/|\textbf{q}|$ and find that
$\Sigma(i\omega) \sim \omega \ln(N/|\omega|)$ which shows a much weaker
dependence on $N$ when compared with similar results from non-SYK large-$N$
Ising-nematic models. Then we evaluate $\Sigma(i\omega)$ again using a more
precise form of $\Pi$ which allows us to study the interplay between $N
\rightarrow \infty$ limit for which $\Sigma(i\omega) \sim \omega
\ln(1/|\omega|)$, and the $\omega \rightarrow 0$ limit where we recover
$\Sigma(i\omega) \sim \omega \ln(N/|\omega|)$. We also use the full bosonic
self energy to obtain the correction to the bosonic specific heat as
$\frac{T}{N} \ln(1/T)$. Since there are $N^2$ bosons and $N$ fermions, the bulk
heat capacity for both fermions and bosons show nearly similar functional form
$NVT \ln(N/T)$ and $NVT \ln(1/T)$ respectively for $T \rightarrow 0$.

### Making PLUMED fly: a tutorial on optimizing performance

- **TL;DR**: PLUMED是一个广泛使用的开源软件包，用于分析和增强分子动力学模拟。本教程介绍了性能测量工具，展示了如何通过向量化命令优化距离、角度和扭转等计算，以及原子序参数和二级结构变量的计算优化。

PLUMED is an open-source software package that is widely used for analyzing
and enhancing molecular dynamics simulations that works in conjunction with
most available molecular dynamics softwares. While the computational cost of
PLUMED calculations is typically negligible compared to the molecular dynamics
code's force evaluation, the software is increasingly being employed for more
computationally demanding tasks where performance optimization becomes
critical. In this tutorial, we describe a recently implemented tool that can be
used to reliably measure code performance. We then use this tool to generate
detailed performance benchmarks that show how calculations of large-numbers of
distances, angles or torsions can be optimized by using vector-based commands
rather than individual scalar operations. We then present benchmarks that
illustrate how to optimize calculations of atomic order parameters and
secondary structure variables. Throughout the tutorial and in our
implementations we endeavor to explain the algorithmic tricks that are being
used to optimize the calculations so others can make use of these prescriptions
both when they are using PLUMED and when they are writing their own codes.

### Dynamical Phase Transitions Across Slow and Fast Regimes in a Two-Tone Driven Duffing Resonator

- **TL;DR**: 研究双色激励下的杜芬谐振器，发现两个驱动之间的竞争关系，在慢拍频区域次级驱动会诱导动态相变，建立了相图框架用于控制非线性系统。

The response of nonlinear resonators to multifrequency driving reveals rich
dynamics beyond conventional single-tone theory. We study a Duffing resonator
under bichromatic excitation and identify a competition between the two drives,
governed by their detuning and relative amplitudes. In the slow-beating regime,
where the tones are closely spaced, the secondary drive acts as a modulation
that induces dynamical phase transitions between coexisting stationary states.
We introduce the cycle-averaged amplitude as an order parameter and map the
resulting phase diagram as a function of the drive detuning and amplitude
ratio, capturing the pronounced asymmetry observed for blue versus red detuning
in experiment. We devise a model to link the onset of these transitions to the
resonance properties around the nonlinear stationary mode of the system. Our
results provide a framework for controlling driven nonlinear systems, enabling
state manipulation, and sensing in nanomechanical, optical, and superconducting
circuit platforms.

### Nuclear spin-free 70Ge/28Si70Ge quantum well heterostructures grown on industrial SiGe-buffered wafers

- **TL;DR**: 该研究展示了在工业SiGe缓冲层上外延生长无核自旋同位素的70Ge/28Si70Ge异质结构，用于延长空穴自旋量子比特的相干时间。

The coherence of hole spin qubits in germanium planar heterostructures is
limited by the hyperfine coupling to the nuclear spin bath due to 29Si and 73Ge
isotopes. Thus, removing these nuclear spin-full isotopes is essential to
extend the hyperfine-limited coherence times needed to implement robust quantum
processors. This work demonstrates the epitaxial growth of device-grade nuclear
spin-free 70Ge/28Si70Ge heterostructures on industrial SiGe buffers while
minimizing the amounts of highly purified 70GeH4 and 28SiH4 used. The obtained
70Ge/28Si70Ge heterostructures exhibit a dislocation density of 5.3 x 10e6 cm-2
and an isotopic purity exceeding 99.99%, with carbon and oxygen impurities
below the detection sensitivity, as revealed by atom probe tomography.
Magnetotransport measurements on gated Hall bars demonstrate effective gate
control of hole density in nuclear spin-free quantum wells. Negative threshold
gate voltages confirm the absence of intentional doping in the wells, while
Hall and Shubnikov-de Haas analyses yield consistent carrier densities (1.4 x
10e11 cm-2) and high mobilities (2.4 x 10e5 cm2/Vs). Mobility trends reveal
interfacetrap- limited scattering and percolation concentration below 7 x 10e10
cm-2. These analyses, along with atomic-level studies, confirm the high quality
of epitaxial 70Ge/28Si70Ge heterostructures and their relevance as a platform
for long-coherence spin qubits.

### Some remarks on the objectivity and thermodynamic consistency of Korteweg-type fluids

In this note we compare the entropy principle and the objectivity arguments
in the methodologies of Dunn and Serrin [1] and in the more recent weakly
nonlocal thermodynamic analysis of Korteweg-type fluids in [2]. It is concluded
that the different objectivity approaches lead to the same constitutive
functions, and that the difference in the thermodynamically compatible pressure
tensors of perfect Korteweg fluids is due to different symmetry requirements.

### Delta-learned force fields for nonbonded interactions: Addressing the strength mismatch between covalent-nonbonded interaction for global models

- **TL;DR**: Δ-sGDML方法通过分离训练分子内和分子间模型，解决了传统机器学习力场在处理非共价相互作用时的偏差问题，显著提高了力预测精度。

Noncovalent interactions--vdW dispersion, hydrogen/halogen bonding,
ion-$\pi$, and $\pi$-stacking--govern structure, dynamics, and emergent
phenomena in materials and molecular systems, yet accurately learning them
alongside covalent forces remains a core challenge for machine-learned force
fields (MLFFs). This challenge is acute for global models that use
Coulomb-matrix (CM) descriptors compared under Euclidean/Frobenius metrics in
multifragment settings. We show that the mismatch between predominantly
covalent force labels and the CM's overrepresentation of intermolecular
features biases single-model training and degrades force-field fidelity. To
address this, we introduce \textit{$\Delta$-sGDML}, a scale-aware formulation
within the sGDML framework that explicitly decouples intra- and intermolecular
physics by training fragment-specific models alongside a dedicated binding
model, then composing them at inference. Across benzene dimers, host-guest
complexes (C$_{60}$@buckycatcher, NO$_3^-$@i-corona[6]arene), benzene-water,
and benzene-Na$^+$, \mbox{$\Delta$-sGDML} delivers consistent gains over a
single global model, with fragment-resolved force-error reductions up to
\textbf{75\%}, without loss of energy accuracy. Furthermore, molecular-dynamics
simulations further confirm that the $\Delta$-model yields a reliable force
field for C$_{60}$@buckycatcher, producing stable trajectories across a wide
range of temperatures (10-400~K), unlike the single global model, which loses
stability above $\sim$200~K. The method offers a practical route to homogenize
per-fragment errors and recover reliable noncovalent physics in global MLFFs.

### Origin of sublattice particle-hole asymmetry in monolayer FeSe superconductors

- **TL;DR**: 本文研究了FeSe/SrTiO3超导体中两个Fe亚晶格间的粒子-空穴不对称性，揭示了衬底诱导的向列对称性破缺是关键机制，提出了两种可能的配对函数机制，并通过实验验证了奇频配对关联的存在。

In iron-based superconductors, the two Fe atoms in the unit cell are
typically related by crystal symmetries; therefore, we expect no intra-unit
cell variations in the superconducting gap. However, recent experiments have
challenged this expectation, reporting intra-unit cell variations in the gap
with an unusual particle-hole asymmetry. Here, we examine the origin of this
asymmetry between the two Fe sublattices in monolayer FeSe grown on SrTiO$_3$.
We reveal that, in addition to the substrate-induced broken inversion symmetry,
substrate nematic symmetry breaking is key to observing this asymmetry. We
further identify two possible mechanisms through which this can occur. The
first is through an odd-parity gap function that coexists with an extended
$s$-wave function. The second is via a nodeless $d$-wave gap function that
develops in the presence of a symmetry-breaking substrate. We argue that the
latter mechanism is more physical. To test our theory, we performed scanning
tunneling spectroscopy measurements across the nematic domain walls, which
exhibit a clear enhancement of the asymmetry between the two Fe sublattices. In
addition, we reveal that the observed sublattice particle-hole asymmetry is
associated with odd-frequency pairing correlations, providing an experimental
realization of this unusual pairing correlation.

### Role of on-site Coulomb energy and negative-charge transfer in a Dirac semi-metal

- **TL;DR**: NiTe₂是一种II型狄拉克半金属，本文通过多种光谱技术量化了其电子参数，发现NiTe₂具有负电荷转移能和适度的电子关联性，使其成为中等关联的p型狄拉克半金属。

Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy in combination with band structure
calculations have shown that the layered transition metal dichalcogenide
NiTe$_2$ is a type-II Dirac semimetal. However, there are conflicting
conclusions in the literature regarding the role of electron correlations in
NiTe$_2$. We study the core-level and valence band electronic structure of
single crystal NiTe$_2$ using soft and hard X-ray photoemission spectroscopy
(SXPES, HAXPES), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and Ni $2p-3d$ resonant
photoemission spectroscopy(resonant-PES) to quantify electronic parameters in
NiTe$_2$. The on-site Coulomb energy ($U_{dd}$) in the Ni $3d$ states is
quantified from measurements of the Ni $3d$ single particle density of states
and the two-hole correlation satellite. The Ni $2p$ core level and $L$-edge XAS
spectra are analyzed by charge transfer cluster model calculations using the
experimentally estimated $U_{dd}$ (= 3.7 eV), and the results show that
NiTe$_2$ exhibits a negative charge-transfer energy ($\Delta$ = -2.8 eV). The
same type of cluster model analysis of NiO $L$-edge XAS confirms its well-known
strongly correlated charge-transfer insulator character, with $U_{dd}$ = 7.0 eV
and $\Delta$ = 6.0 eV. The $d$-$p$ hybridization strength $T_{eg}$ for
NiTe$_2$$&lt;$NiO, and indicates that the reduced $U_{dd}$ in
NiTe\textsubscript{2} compared to NiO is not due to an increase in $T_{eg}$.
The increase in $d^n$ count on the Ni site in NiTe$_{2}$ by nearly one electron
is attributed to negative-$\Delta$ and a reduced $U_{dd}$. However, since
$U_{dd}$$&gt;$$|\Delta|$, the results indicate the important role of a finite
repulsive $U_{dd}$ in making NiTe$_{2}$ a moderately correlated $p$-type Dirac
semi-metal.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文研究了基于马约拉纳零模的拓扑量子计算机的时钟速度，通过时间相关的量子噪声提取电子穿越系统的传输时间，并提出了一个启发式公式来描述传输时间与纳米线长度的线性关系。

The clock speed of topological quantum computers based on Majorana zero mode
(MZM)-supporting nanoscale devices is determined by the time taken for
electrons to traverse the device. We employ the time-dependent
Landauer-B{\"u}ttiker transport theory for current cross-lead correlations in a
superconducting nanowire junction hosting MZMs. From the time-dependent quantum
noise, we are able to extract traversal times for electrons crossing the
system. After demonstrating a linear scaling of traversal times with nanowire
length, we present a heuristic formula for the traversal times which accurately
captures their behaviour. We then connect our framework to a proposed
experimental verification of this discriminant between spurious and genuine
MZMs utilizing time-resolved transport measurements.

### Posterior corrections for systematic distortions in atomic-resolution images from hexagonal crystals

- **TL;DR**: 本文提出了一种基于信息论的后处理方法来校正原子分辨率图像中的对称性破坏，通过恢复六方晶体的平移周期性对称性来证明新方法的有效性。

Digital images from crystals, as projected from the third spatial dimension
and recorded in atomic resolution with any kind of real-world microscope,
feature necessarily broken symmetries of the translation-periodicity-restricted
Euclidean plane. The symmetry breakings are due to both the imaging process and
the real structure of the imaged crystal, with the former cause typically
dominating. A posterior algorithmic reduction of the symmetry breaking in such
images constitutes, thus, often a correction for many of the distortions that
were introduced by the imaging processes. Numerically quantified restorations
of such symmetries can, therefore, be used to demonstrate the efficacy of a
newly implemented posterior correction method for atomic-resolution images from
hexagonal crystals. Recently developed information theory based methods are
here shown to be suitable for this purpose. Thirteen experimental
atomic-resolution images from graphite and monolayer molybdenite (MoS2), as
respectively obtained by scanning tunneling microscopy, atomic force microscopy
in the torsional resonance mode, and aberration-corrected parallel illumination
transmission electron microscopy served as test cases in our larger (in its
totality so far unpublished) study, from which we quote here. The source code
of the software that was used for our distortion corrections and the whole
report on that study are freely available on GitHub.

### Mittag-Leffler Quantum Statistics and Thermodynamic Anomalies

Building upon the framework established in our recent work [M. Seifi et al.,
Phys. Rev. E 111, 054114 (2025)], wherein a generalized Maxwell Boltzmann
distribution was formulated using the Mittag Leffler function within the
superstatistical formalism, we extend this approach to the quantum domain.
Specifically, we introduce two statistical distributions,termed the Mittag
Leffler Bose Einstein (MLBE) and Mittag Leffler Fermi Dirac (MLFD)
distributions, constructed by generalizing the conventional Bose-Einstein and
Fermi-Dirac distributions through the Mittag-Leffler function. This
generalization incorporates a deformation parameter (\alpha), which facilitates
a continuous interpolation between bosonic and fermionic statistics, while
inherently capturing nonequilibrium effects and generalized thermodynamic
behavior. We analyze the thermodynamic geometry associated with these
distributions and identify significant departures from standard statistical
models. Notably, the MLBE distribution manifests a Bose-Einstein-like
condensation even in the absence of interactions, whereas the MLFD distribution
exhibits unconventional features, such as negative heat capacity in the
low-temperature regime. These findings highlight the pivotal role of
statistical deformation in determining emergent macroscopic thermodynamic
phenomena.

### Edge Irregularity Strength: A Complementary Descriptor to Topological Indices in QSPR and QSAR Studies

- **TL;DR**: 本文探讨了边不规则强度在化学图论中的应用，证明其可作为预测物理化学性质的工具，类似于拓扑指数。

In chemical graph theory, topological indices are widely used as numerical
descriptors for establishing quantitative structure-property relationships
(QSPR) and quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR). These indices
successfully correlate molecular structure with various physicochemical and
biological properties. In addition to these methods, the concept of edge
irregularity strength, a graph labeling measure, offers another perspective for
representing structural characteristics. In this context, the edge irregularity
strength concept provides a systematic way of assigning numerical labels to
atoms based on specific rules. In this work, we explore the chemical
applicability of the edge irregularity strength and demonstrate that it can
also serve as a predictive tool for physicochemical properties, similar to
topological indices. The findings show that the edge irregularity strength

We report the results of resistance measurements under pressure up to
$4.2\,\mathrm{GPa}$ on single-crystalline $\mathrm{CaSb}_2$ , which shows the
maximum of superconducting transition temperature $T_\mathrm{c}$ at
$3.1\,\mathrm{GPa}$. At room temperature, $R(P)$ shows a subtle anomaly at
$3.1\,\mathrm{GPa}$. However, Bloch-Gr\"uneisen analysis of $R(T)$ indicates
that the electronic state does not change significantly across
$3.1\,\mathrm{GPa}$.

The accurate simulation of strongly correlated electron systems remains a
central challenge in condensed matter physics, motivating the development of
various non-perturbative many-body methods. Such methods are typically
benchmarked against the numerical exact determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC)
in the Hubbard model; however, DQMC is limited by the fermionic sign problem
and the uncertainties of numerical analytic continuation. To address these
issues, we use the exactly solvable Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) model as a
benchmarking platform to evaluate three many-body approximations: $GW$, $HGW$,
and $SGW$. We compare the Green's functions, spectral functions, and response
functions obtained from these approximations with the exact solutions. Our
analysis shows that the $GW$ approximation, often considered insufficient for
describing strong correlation, exhibits a previously unreported solution branch
that accurately reproduces Mott physics in the HK model. In addition, using a
covariant formalism, we find that $HGW$ provides an accurate description of
charge response, while $SGW$ performs well for spin correlations. Overall, our
work demonstrates that the HK model can effectively benchmark many-body
approximations and helps refine the understanding of $GW$ methods in strongly
correlated regimes.

- **TL;DR**: 利用实时含时密度泛函理论研究FeCl2单层中飞秒激光诱导的超快退磁过程，揭示了Fe到Cl原子的磁矩转移机制及其非单调的激光能量依赖性。

The microscopic origin of laser-induced ultrafast demagnetization remains an
open question, to which the non-thermal electronic distribution plays a vital
role at the initial stage. Herein, we investigate the connection between the
non-thermal electronic distribution and the ultrafast spin dynamics as well as
the electronic structure evolution in ferromagnetic \ce{FeCl2} monolayer using
real-time time-dependent density functional theory (rt-TDDFT) with
self-consistent Hubbard $U$ correction. Our simulations reveal that femtosecond
laser pulses induce ultrafast magnetic moment transfer from Fe to Cl atoms.
More importantly, through a comprehensive analysis of orbital-resolved
electronic structure, we elucidate the microscopic origin of this transfer,
attributing it to specific intra-atomic and inter-atomic charge transfer
pathways driven by non-thermal excitations. The extent of demagnetization of Fe
atoms exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the laser photon energy, reaching
a maximum at the resonant excitation. In addition, the dynamical evolution of
the band structure was studied based on the eigenstates of the instantaneous
Hamiltonian. Under resonant excitation, the bandgap reduction reaches up to
$41\%$ within tens of fs. These findings provide fundamental insights into
ultrafast spin control and suggest a strategy to optically engineer the
magnetism in two-dimensional magnetic materials.

Silicon nitride membranes are a powerful and ubiquitous optomechanical
resonator technology, enabling high mechanical Q, low optical loss, and
enhanced optomechanical coupling via a panoply of strain-, phononic-, and
photonic-crystal engineering techniques. Fabrication and characterization of
silicon nitride membranes has become a form of tacit knowledge in optomechanics
research groups. Here we present a video run-through of the design,
fabrication, and characterization of a contemporary silicon nitride membrane
resonator (specifically, a centimeter-scale Si3N4 nanoribbon supporting
$Q&gt;10^8$ torsion modes). Our tutorial can serve as a starting point or
refresher for practitioners in the field.

### Equivalence of charged and neutral density functional formulations for correcting the many-body self-interaction of polarons

The electron self-interaction problem in density functional theory affects
the accurate modeling of polarons, particularly their localization and
formation energy. Charged and neutral density functional formulations have been
developed to address this issue, yet their relationship remains unclear. Here,
we demonstrate their equivalence in treating the many-body self-interaction of
the polaron state. In particular, we connect with each other piecewise-linear
functionals based on adding an extra charge to the supercell, the pSIC approach
derived from the energetics of the neutral defect with polaronic distortions in
a supercell, and the unit-cell method for polarons based on electron-phonon
couplings. We show that these approaches lead to the same formal expression of
the self-interaction corrected energy, which is fully defined by the energetics
of the neutral charge state of the charged polaronic structure. Residual
differences between these methods solely arise from the achieved polaronic
structure, which is affected by different treatments of electron-screening and
finite-size effects. We apply these methods to a set of prototypical small hole
and electron polarons, including the hole polaron in MgO, the hole polaron in
$\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$, the $V_\text{k}$ center in NaI, the electron polaron in
BiVO$_4$, and the electron polaron in TiO$_2$. We show that the ground-state
properties of polarons obtained using charged and neutral density functional
formulations are in excellent agreement.

Understanding how macroscopic nonequilibrium systems respond to changes in
external or internal parameters remains a fundamental challenge in physics. In
this work, we report a parameter transitional symmetry valid for macroscopic
dynamics arbitrarily far from equilibrium. The symmetry leads to exact response
relations and gives meaningful expansions in both linear and short-time
regimes. This framework provides a universal description of macroscopic
response phenomena arbitrarily far from equilibrium - including non-stationary
processes and time-dependent attractors. The theory is validated and
demonstrated numerically using the Willamowski-Rossler model, which exhibits
rich dynamical behaviors including limit cycles and chaos.

### Size-Consistent Adiabatic Connection Functionals via Orbital-Based Matrix Interpolation

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种基于轨道的大小一致性矩阵插值方法(OSMI)，用于构建密度泛函理论中的相关泛函，该方法在弱相关和强相关极限下构建相关能矩阵，解决了传统方法中大小一致性的问题。

We introduce a size-consistent and orbital-invariant formalism for
constructing correlation functionals based on the adiabatic connection for
density functional theory (DFT). By constructing correlation energy matrices
for the weak and strong correlation limits in the space of occupied orbitals,
our method, which we call orbital-based size-consistent matrix interpolation
(OSMI), avoids previous difficulties in the construction of size-consistent
adiabatic connection functionals. We design a simple, nonempirical adiabatic
connection and a one-parameter strong-interaction limit functional, and we show
that the resulting method reproduces the correlation energy of the uniform
electron gas over a wide range of densities. When applied to subsets of the
GMTKN55 thermochemistry database, OSMI is more accurate on average than MP2 and
nonempirical density functionals. Most notably, OSMI provides excellent
predictions of the barrier heights we tested, with average errors of less than
2 kcal mol$^{-1}$. Finally, we find that OSMI improves the trade-off between
fractional spin and fractional charge errors for bond dissociation curves
compared to DFT and MP2. The fact that OSMI provides a good description of
molecular systems and the uniform electron gas, while also maintaining low
self-interaction error and size-consistency, suggests that it could provide a
framework for studying heterogeneous chemical systems.

### Spin and orbital excitations in undoped infinite layers: a comparison between superconducting PrNiO2 and insulating CaCuO2

Infinite-layer nickelates are among the most promising cuprate-akin
superconductors, although relevant differences from copper oxides have been
reported. Here, we present momentum- and polarization-resolved RIXS
measurements on chemically undoped, superconducting PrNiO2, and compare its
magnetic and orbital excitations with those of the reference infinite layer
cuprate CaCuO2. In PrNiO2, the in-plane magnetic exchange integrals are smaller
than in CaCuO2, whereas the out-of-plane values are similar, indicating that
both materials support a three-dimensional antiferromagnetic order. Orbital
excitations, associated to the transitions within 3d states of the metal, are
well reproduced within a single-ion model and display similar characteristics,
except for the Ni-dxy peak which, besides lying at significantly lower energy,
shows an opposite dispersion to that of Cu-dxy. This is interpreted as a
consequence of orbital superexchange coupling between nearest neighbor sites,
which drives the orbiton propagation. Our observations demonstrate that
infinitelayer cuprates and nickelates share most of the spin and orbital
properties, despite their markedly different charge-transfer energy Delta.

We investigate the two-dimensional optical Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model,
in which the electron hopping amplitude is modulated by the difference between
neighboring phonon coordinates. Using sign-problem-free auxiliary-field quantum
Monte Carlo simulations, complemented by mean-field analysis, we determine the
long-range ordered phases as a function of the electron-phonon coupling and
phonon frequency. By examining both adiabatic and antiadiabatic regimes, we
reveal the emergence of staggered and armchair valence bond solid (VBS) phases,
as well as the O(4) antiferromagnetic phase. In addition, finite-temperature
simulations show that the VBS transition occurs at critical temperatures
significantly higher than in models with local electron-phonon coupling,
consistent with the presence of lighter polarons in the metallic regime. These
findings establish the ground-state and finite-temperature phase diagrams of
the optical SSH model, which emphasize its similarities and contrasts with
other electron-phonon systems.

- **TL;DR**: 通过Kohn-Sham反演方法从量子蒙特卡洛计算获得基准KS势，与常用密度泛函近似进行比较，发现不同DFA产生相似电子密度但KS势不同，QMC-KS能隙通常大于大多数DFA。

Using the Kohn-Sham (KS) inversion method of Hollins et al. [J. Phys.:
Condens. Matter 29, 04LT01 (2017)], we invert densities from variational and
diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations to obtain benchmark QMC-KS
potentials for a range of insulators and semiconductors, which we then compare
to the KS potentials of popular density functional approximations (DFAs). Our
results show that different DFAs yield similar electron densities, despite
differences in their KS potentials, which originate primarily from the exchange
and correlation contribution. We also find that the KS gap from the QMC density
is typically larger than the KS gaps of most DFAs, with the exception of
Hartree-Fock. Finally, the KS gap is sensitive to the inclusion of semicore
states in the pseudopotentials, such that comparison with experiment should be
done with caution.

Particle-like chiral magnetic skyrmions can flow in nanotracks and behave
like chiral fluids. Using interacting flows to perform logical operations is an
important topic in microfluidics and nanofluidics. Here, we report a basic
nanofluidic logic computing system based on chiral magnetic skyrmions flowing
in parallel pipelines connected by an H-shaped junction. The flow behaviors
could be manipulated by adjusting the spin polarization angle, which controls
the intrinsic skyrmion Hall angle. We demonstrate that within certain range of
the spin polarization angle, fully developed skyrmion flows could lead to
fluidic logical operations, which significantly reduce the complexity of
skyrmion logic as there is no need for deterministic creation, precise control,
and detection of a single isolated skyrmion. Our results suggest that the
chiral flow behaviors of magnetic quasiparticles may offer possibilities for
spintronic and nanofluidic functions.

Metal halide perovskites are promising materials for optoelectronic
applications owing to their outstanding optical and electronic properties.
Among them, all-inorganic perovskites such as CsPbBr$_3$ offer superior thermal
and chemical stability. However, obtaining high-quality CsPbBr$_3$ thin films
via solution processing remains challenging due to the precursor's low
solubility, and current additive or solvent engineering strategies are often
complex and poorly reproducible. High-pressure recrystallization has recently
emerged as a promising route to improve film quality, yet its impact on film
properties remains insufficiently explored. Here, we systematically investigate
the morphological, structural, and optical properties of CsPbBr$_3$ thin films
prepared by high-pressure recrystallization, in comparison with standard
non-recrystallized films. Optimized recrystallization at 300 bar produces
smooth, pinhole-free, single-phase 3D perovskite layers with sub-nanometer
roughness, while the film thickness is precisely tunable via precursor
concentration. The process enhances both grain and crystallite sizes, leading
to amplified spontaneous emission with a reduced excitation threshold and
improved photostability. Temperature-dependent X-ray diffraction further
reveals the orthorhombic--tetragonal--cubic phase transition, consistent with
single-crystal behavior. This study provides fundamental insights into
pressure-driven recrystallization and establishes a reproducible, scalable
approach for fabricating high-quality CsPbBr$_3$ films for optoelectronic
devices.

We show that a large class of nonequilibrium many-body systems in contact
with two thermal baths admit an exact mapping onto equivalent equilibrium
systems. This mapping provides direct access to nonequilibrium phase transition
points from known equilibrium results, irrespective of the model, interaction
topology, or distance from equilibrium. We verify the universality of this
correspondence using paradigmatic models (Ising, Potts, and Blume-Capel), and
highlight distinctive features in entropy production close to critical and
tricritical points. Our findings connect equilibrium and nonequilibrium
statistical mechanics, with implications for microscopic thermal machines and
stochastic thermodynamics.

We present a novel nonadiabatic perturbation theory (NAPT) for correlated
systems of electrons and nuclei beyond the Born-Oppenheimer (BO) approximation.
The essence of the method is to exploit the smallness of the
electronic-to-nuclear mass ratio by treating the electron-nuclear correlation
terms in the electronic equation of motion of the exact factorisation (EF)
framework as perturbation. We prove that any finite-order truncation of the
NAPT preserves the normalisation of the conditional electronic factor as well
as the gauge covariance of the resulting perturbative equations of motion. We
illustrate the usefulness of NAPT by obtaining nonadiabatic corrections to the
BO Berry phase in Jahn--Teller systems with a conical intersection. It well
captures the departure of the exact Berry phase from being topological via the
lowest-order NAPT. By removing the conical intersection with a constant gap, it
further yields the correct scaling of the Berry phase toward zero.

### Theoretical analysis of photon detection mechanism in superconducting single-photon detectors

To elucidate the photon detection mechanism of superconducting single-photon
detectors, we theoretically examine the dynamics of type-II superconductors
with a bias current using the two-dimensional time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau
and the Maxwell equations. The photon injection that weakens the
superconducting order parameter is treated phenomenologically as a local
temperature increase, and the amount of injection is controlled by the initial
hotspot radius. The photon is detected by the voltage change between two
electrodes attached to the left and right edges of the superconductor. We find
that certain parameter ranges can be explained by the traditionally considered
hotspot model, while other parameter ranges are governed by the generation and
annihilation of superconducting vortex and antivortex pairs. The photon
detection is possible for an initial hotspot radius that exceeds a threshold
value. We find that the generation of a vortex--antivortex pair occurs near the
threshold. The flow of the pair perpendicular to the current direction finally
creates a normal region for the photon detection. The voltage change for the
Ginzburg--Landau parameter close to the transition point from type-II to type-I
superconductor shows anomalous behavior that is not associated with the
dynamics of the vortex--antivortex pair. We also examine the effects of
spatially non-uniform current density on the voltage change and the
superconducting order parameter to provide a hint to understand the behavior of
wide-strip single-photon detectors. The estimated values of incident photon
energy and response time for photon detection are reasonable in comparison with
experiments. The present comprehensive examination provides useful guidelines
for flexible design of device structures.

### Embedding independent length scale of flat bands

In flat band systems with quenched kinetic energy, most of the conventional
length scales related to the band dispersion become ineffectual. Although a few
geometric length scales, such as the quantum-metric length, can still be
defined, because of their embedding dependence, i.e., the dependence on the
choice of orbital positions used to construct the tight-binding model, they
cannot serve as a universal length scale of the flat band systems. Here, we
introduce an embedding-independent length scale $\xi_\text{flat}$ of a flat
band that is defined as the localization length of an in-gap state proximate to
the flat band. Because $\xi_\text{flat}$ is derived from the intrinsic
localization of compact localized states, it is solely determined by the
Hamiltonian and provides a robust foundation for embedding-independent
observables. We show analytically that the superconducting coherence length in
a flat-band superconductor is given by $\xi_\text{flat}$ in the weak-coupling
limit, thereby identifying $\xi_\text{flat}$ as the relevant length scale for
many-body phenomena. Numerical simulations on various lattice models confirm
all theoretical predictions, including the correspondence between
$\xi_\text{flat}$ and the superconducting coherence length. Our results
highlight $\xi_\text{flat}$ as a universal length scale for flat bands and open
a pathway to embedding-independent characterization of strongly interacting
flat-band materials.

The hybridization gap in strained-layer InAs/InxGa1-xSb quantum spin Hall
insulators (QSHIs) is significantly enhanced compared to binary InAs/GaSb QSHI
structures, where the typical indium composition, x, ranges between 0.2 and
0.4. This enhancement prompts a critical question: to what extent can quantum
wells (QWs) be strained while still preserving the fundamental QSHI phase? In
this study, we demonstrate the controlled molecular beam epitaxial (MBE) growth
of highly strained-layer QWs with an indium composition of x = 0.5. These
structures possess a substantial compressive strain within the In0.5Ga0.5Sb QW.
Detailed crystal structure analyses confirm the exceptional quality of the
resulting epitaxial films, indicating coherent lattice structures and the
absence of visible dislocations. Transport measurements further reveal that the
QSHI phase in InAs/In0.5Ga0.5Sb QWs is robust and protected by time-reversal
symmetry. Notably, the edge states in these systems exhibit giant
magnetoresistance when subjected to a modest perpendicular magnetic field. This
behavior is in agreement with the Z2 topological property predicted by the
Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang (BHZ) model, confirming the preservation of topologically
protected edge transport in the presence of enhanced bulk strain.

Accurately analyzing NMR and MRI diffusion experimental data relies on the
theoretical expression used for signal attenuation or phase evolution. In a
complex system, the encountered magnetic field is often inhomogeneous, which
may be represented by a linear combination of z^n gradient fields, where n is
the order. Additionally, the higher the order of the nonlinear gradient field,
the more sensitive the phase variances are to differences in diffusion
coefficients and delay times. Hence, studying higher-order fields has both
theoretical and experimental importance, but this is a challenge for
traditional methods. The recently proposed phase diffusion method proposed a
general way to overcome the challenge. This method is used and demonstrated in
detail in this paper to determine the phase evolution in a quadric field (n =
4). Three different types of phase evolution in the quadric gradient field are
obtained. Moreover, a general signal attenuation expression is proposed to
describe the signal attenuation for spin diffusion from the origin of the
nonlinear gradient field. This approximation is based on the short gradient
pulse (SGP) approximation but is extended to include the finite gradient pulse
width (FGPW) effect by using the mean square phase. Compared to other forms of
signal attenuation, such as Gaussian and Lorentzian, this method covers a
broader range of attenuation, from small to relatively large. Additionally,
this attenuation is easier to understand than the Mittag-Leffler function-based
attenuation. The results, particularly the phase and signal attenuation
expressions obtained in this paper, potentially advance PFG diffusion research
in nonlinear gradient fields in NMR and MRI.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文提出了一种基于非对称晶体结构的机制，解释了铜氧化物中赝隙现象的关键特征，包括费米面重构形成小费米口袋、载流子密度变化以及ARPES观测到的费米弧。

We propose a structure-property relation that could be key to the pseudogap
phenomenology in cuprates. The underlying nonsymmorphic crystal structure in
the low-temperature orthogonal phase endows the lattice with a sublattice
structure that gives rise to two electronic bands near the Fermi surface. In
the presence of spin-orbit coupling, the hybridization of these two bands
generates small Fermi pockets and, correspondingly, a change in the number of
free carriers. A sublattice structure also leads to angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) matrix-element interference, naturally
explaining the emergence of Fermi arcs and their consistency with closed Fermi
pockets. We employ a symmetry analysis to highlight the expected Fermi surface
properties, and complement it with density functional theory (DFT) for a
quantitative discussion and comparison with recent experiments in doped
La$_2$CuO$_4$. The proposed mechanism can consistently account for the most
salient features of the pseudogap in the cuprates, namely, the Fermi surface
reconstruction with the formation of small Fermi pockets and the corresponding
change in carrier density, and the observation of Fermi arcs by ARPES.

- **TL;DR**: 研究发现声表面波可以通过声子-轨道耦合在轻金属中产生轨道电流，这种声学轨道霍尔效应比声学自旋电流效率更高、扩散距离更长，为低耗散轨道电子器件提供了新机会。

Orbital currents provide a new degree of freedom for controlling magnetism,
yet their interaction with lattice dynamics remains largely unexplored. Here we
report a systematic investigation of the acoustic orbital Hall effect in light
metals such as Ti and Cr, where surface acoustic waves generate orbital
currents through phonon-orbital coupling. The acoustic orbital current in Ti
exhibits higher efficiency and longer diffusion length compared to the acoustic
spin current in Pt. The sign and magnitude of the rectified acoustic voltages
in nonmagnetic (Ti, Cr)/ferromagnetic (Ni, Co, Fe$_x$Co$_{1-x}$) bilayers are
determined by the product of orbital-to-spin conversion and magnetoelastic
coupling efficiencies of the ferromagnet. Additionally, we find evidence for
acoustic orbital pumping, whereby the excitation of ferromagnetic resonance by
surface acoustic waves injects an orbital current from the ferromagnet into the
nonmagnet. These results establish lattice dynamics as an efficient driver of
orbital transport, opening opportunities for low-dissipation orbitronic devices
that harness and sense phonons.

This study investigates the application of Random Forest Regression for
predicting mechanical properties of alloy steel-Elongation, Tensile Strength,
and Yield Strength-from material composition features including Iron (Fe),
Chromium (Cr), Nickel (Ni), Manganese (Mn), Silicon (Si), Copper (Cu), Carbon

comprising these features, we trained and evaluated the Random Forest model,
achieving high predictive performance as evidenced by R2 scores and Mean
Squared Errors (MSE). The results demonstrate the model's efficacy in providing
accurate predictions, which is validated through various performance metrics
including residual plots and learning curves. The findings underscore the

### Charge glass from supercooling topological-ordered liquid

- **TL;DR**: 拓扑有序液体的结晶过程与常规液体不同，通过三重子的扩散运动驱动相变，表现出玻璃化行为和异常小的Avrami指数(~0.5)，这解释了有机导体中的电荷玻璃行为。

Topological order characterizes a class of quantum and classical many-body
liquid states that escape the conventional classification by spontaneous
symmetry breaking. Many properties of the topological-ordered states still
await a clear understanding, and nature of phase transition dynamics is one of
them. Normally, when a liquid freezes into a solid, crystallization starts with
nucleation and a solid domain quickly grows on the surface of the expanding
nucleus, and the domains evolve into macroscopic size. In this work, we reveal
that the crystallization of the topological-ordered liquid proceeds in a
fundamentally different way. The topological-ordered phase is characterized by
a global conserved quantity and its conjugate fractional charge, which we call
a flux and a triplet in our working system of the charge Ising model on a
triangular lattice. In contrast to the normal crystallization process, the
phase transition is driven by the diffusive motion of triplets, which is
required to change the value of conserved fluxes to exit the
topological-ordered phase. In order to complete crystallization, triplets must
spend a divergently long time to diffuse over a macroscopic distance across the
system, which results in glassy behavior. Reflecting the diffusive motion of
triplets, the initial crystallization process shows slowing down with unusually
small Avrami exponent $\sim0.5$. These anomalous dynamics are specific to the
crystallization from topological-ordered liquid, and well account for the main
features of charge glass behavior exhibited by the organic conductors,
$\theta$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$X(SCN)$_4$.

Polarizable Quantum Mechanics/Molecular Mechanics (QM/MM) approaches based on
fluctuating charges and dipoles (QM/FQ(F$\mu$)) are formulated within the
state-specific Vertical Excitation Model (VEM) to compute vertical excitation
energies of solvated systems. This methodology overcomes the limitations of the
widely used Linear Response (LR) approach. While LR can capture the dynamic
response of the solvent to the QM transition density, it neglects the solvent
reorganization that follows solute relaxation upon electronic excitation. In
contrast, the VEM framework explicitly accounts for this effect. Benchmark
calculations of vertical excitation energies using QM/FQ(F$\mu$) are reported
for a representative set of solutes - acrolein, acetone, caffeine,
p-nitroaniline, coumarin 153, doxorubicin, and betaine-30 - comparing VEM with
LR, corrected LR (cLR), and cLR 2 schemes. The results reveal notable
variations in solvent response depending on the character of the electronic
transition and demonstrate that optimal accuracy can be achieved by selecting
the most appropriate model for each specific system and excitation.

The linear absorption spectrum of excitons in TMDC monolayers under the
influence of an in-plane magnetic field is theoretically studied. We
demonstrate that in-plane magnetic fields induce a hybridization between
spin-bright and spin-dark exciton transitions, resulting in a brightening of
spin-dark excitons. We analytically investigate spectral features including
resonance energy shifts, broadening and amplitudes ratios. In particular, for a
MoSe$_2$ monolayer with radiatively-limited linewidth, we find a complex
interplay of dark-bright splitting and linewidth difference of both involved
spin-bright and spin-dark excitons.

The structural, vibrational, and optical properties of Rb$_2$TeBr$_6$ have
been investigated under high pressure using synchrotron X-ray diffraction,
Raman spectroscopy, photoluminescence (PL), and optical absorption
measurements. At ambient conditions, Rb$_2$TeBr$_6$ crystallizes in the cubic
Fm-3m structure, which remains stable below 8.0 GPa. Within this pressure
range, subtle inter-octahedral rotations develop, producing a gradual localized
deviation from the ideal cubic framework. This local reorientation facilitates
radiative recombination, leading to a pronounced enhancement of PL intensity
with pressure up to 2.4 GPa. Beyond this pressure point, enhancement of
nonradiative relaxation channels result in gradual PL quenching. Additionally,
the PL intensity increases upon the application of an external weak magnetic
field. A structural transition to the orthorhombic Pnnm phase occurs at around
8.0 GPa, followed by a monoclinic P$2_1/m$ phase above 10.7 GPa, and eventual
amorphization beyond 25.5 GPa. Optical absorption spectra reveal continuous
band-gap narrowing upon compression. These findings demonstrate the strong
coupling among lattice dynamics, electronic structure, and optical response in
Rb$_2$TeBr$_6$, underscoring its potential as a pressure-tunable optoelectronic
material

We propose and study a generalized quantum statistical framework, referred to
as \emph{alpha statistics}, that continuously interpolates between
Bose--Einstein and Fermi--Dirac statistics and naturally extends into the
hyperbosonic regime for $\alpha &lt; 0$. Inspired by Haldane's exclusion
statistics, this formulation introduces a modified occupation weight function
that encodes effective statistical interactions via the parameter $\alpha$.
Using thermodynamic geometry, we analyze the sign and singular behavior of the
thermodynamic curvature as a diagnostic of underlying interactions and phase
structures. A crossover temperature $T^{*}$, at which the curvature changes
sign, marks the transition between effectively attractive (Bose-like) and
repulsive (Fermi-like) statistical regimes. When expressed relative to the
Bose--Einstein condensation temperature $T_{c}$, the ratio $T^{*}/T_{c}$
depends universally on $\alpha$. For negative $\alpha$, corresponding to
hyperbosonic statistics, we find curvature singularities at specific
fugacities, indicating modified condensation phenomena distinct from
conventional Bose condensation. These results highlight the geometric and
thermodynamic consequences of alpha statistics and establish a link between
fractional exclusion principles and curvature-induced interaction signatures in
statistical thermodynamics.

### Unlocking n-alk-1-ynes Conformers: Quantum "Trigger Finger" versus "Stiff Joint" Conformations

- **TL;DR**: n-炔烃分子构象存在两种近简并的旋转异构体：平面构型(Cs)和扭曲构型(C1)，具有独特的量子触发机制，这对光谱数据解释和分子电子学中的构象控制具有重要意义。

Molecular conformation in n-alk-1-ynes (CnA) is conventionally simplified to
an all-planar structure. We report a comprehensive quantum chemical analysis
revealing two near-isoenergetic rotamers at the acetylenic terminus: planar
(C$_s$) and skewed (C$_1$). The high, symmetric rotational energy barrier
($\approx 150$\,meV) arises from unique steric relief near the $\mathrm{sp}$
center coupled with electronic stabilization of C$_1$. This creates a unique
kinetic profile: a Quantum ``Trigger Finger'' ($\alpha$ rotation) that enforces
an $\approx 50\%:\,50\%$ $\mathrm{C}_s/\mathrm{C}_1$ ensemble, sharply
contrasting with the thermodynamically biased ``Stiff Joint'' ($\delta$
rotation) of the alkyl chain. This structural degeneracy necessitates ensemble
averaging for spectroscopic data interpretation, while the slow interconversion
permits kinetic trapping and intentional conformer enrichment during synthesis
and molecular junction fabrication. Our work redefines the alkyne anchor,
providing a blueprint for accurate interpretation of spectroscopic data and
achieving conformational control in molecular electronics.

### Noises in a two-channel charge Kondo model

We investigate fluctuations of electric and heat currents, along with their
cross-correlations, in a two-channel charge Kondo circuit driven by either a
voltage bias or a temperature gradient applied across the weak link. The ratios
of voltage-driven electric/heat noise to the applied voltage $V$ exhibit
oscillations with the gate voltage $N$, resembling the behavior of the
thermoelectric coefficient $G_T$. In contrast, the ratios of temperature-driven
electric/heat noise to the temperature difference $\Delta T$ vary with $N$ in a
manner analogous to the thermal coefficient $G_H$ or the electric conductance
$G$. The mixed noise, which is defined as the correlation function between
electric and heat currents, displays behavior opposite to that of the above
noises. The logarithmic temperature dependence of these noises signals
non-Fermi-liquid behavior, while their oscillations with gate voltage reflect
the roles of particle-hole and time-reversal symmetries in thermoelectric
transport. Our results demonstrate that the fundamental relations linking
voltage- and temperature-induced noises to thermoelectric transport across a
tunnel junction persist beyond the Fermi-liquid paradigm.

The planar Hall effect (PHE) is typically symmetric under magnetic field
reversal, as required by the Onsager reciprocity relations. Recent advances
have identified the antisymmetric PHE (under magnetic field reversal) as an
intriguing extension in magnetic systems. While new mechanisms have been
proposed, the role of conventional anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) in this
phenomenon remains unclear. Here, we report the experimental discovery of an
antisymmetric (with respect to both magnetic field and magnetization) PHE and
magnetoresistance in single-crystal $Co_{30}Pt_{70}$ (111) thin films with
$C_{3}$ rotational symmetry and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA). We
demonstrate that both antisymmetric effects arise naturally from the intrinsic
fourth-rank AMR tensor inherent to C3-symmetric planes, assisted by PMA. Our
findings link conventional AMR to antisymmetric galvanomagnetic responses,
offering new insights into symmetry-governed transport in crystalline
ferromagnets.

We study the quantum relaxation dynamics for a lattice version of the
one-dimensional (1D) $N$-flavor Gross-Neveu (GN) model after a Hamiltonian
parameter quench. Allowing for a system-reservoir coupling $\gamma$, we
numerically describe the system dynamics through a time-dependent
self-consistent Lindblad master equation. For a closed ($\gamma=0$) finite-size
system subjected to an interaction parameter quench, the order parameter
dynamics exhibits oscillations and revivals. In the thermodynamic limit, our
results imply that the order parameter reaches its post-quench stationary value
in accordance with the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH). However,
time-dependent finite-momentum correlation matrix elements equilibrate only if
$\gamma&gt;0$. Our findings highlight subtle yet important aspects of the
post-quench relaxation dynamics of quantum many-body systems.

Hybrid nanostructures that combine semiconducting and metallic components
offer great potential for photothermal therapy, optoelectronics, and sensing,
by integrating tunable optical properties with enhanced light absorption and
charge transport. Boosting the integrated performance of these hybrid systems
demands techniques capable of probing local variations of the physical
properties inaccessible to bulk analysis. Here, we report the single-particle
dielectric characterization of hybrid, semiconducting bismuth sulfide
(Bi$_2$S$_3$) nanorods (NR) decorated with metallic Au nanoparticles (NP),
employing scanning dielectric microscopy, which uses electrostatic force
microscopy in combination with finite-element numerical simulations. We reveal
a pronounced enhancement in the local dielectric response of Bi$_2$S$_3$ upon
Au decoration, attributed to interfacial polarization and electron transfer
from Au to the Bi$_2$S$_3$ matrix, thus suggesting a
semiconductor-to-metal-like transition at the single-particle level. Numerical
simulations show that the response is dominated by the vertical component of
the permittivity and that the decorating metallic Au NP produce only moderate
shielding of the semiconductor Bi$_2$S$_3$ NR core, indicating that the large
increase in the dielectric response originates primarily from intrinsic
modifications within the NR. Overall, these findings provide direct insight
into structure--property relationships at the single-particle level, supporting
the rational design of advanced hybrid nanostructures with tailored electronic
functionalities.

The rise of high-entropy oxides as a major functional materials design
principle in recent years has prompted us to investigate how compositional
disorder affects long-range magnetic ordering in double perovskite oxides.
Since ferromagnetic insulators are emerging as an important platform for
lossless spintronics, we consider the $RE_2$NiMnO$_6$ ($RE$ : rare-earth)
family and investigate single-crystalline films of
(La$_{0.4}$Nd$_{0.4}$Sm$_{0.4}$Gd$_{0.4}$Y$_{0.4}$)NiMnO$_{6}$ grown on
SrTiO$_3$ (001) substrates in this work. Despite configurational disorder and
high cationic size variance at the $RE$ site, the material exhibits robust
ferromagnetic ordering with a Curie temperature ($T_\mathrm{c}$) of
approximately 150 K. This $T_\mathrm{c}$ is consistent with the expectation
based on consideration of the average ionic radii of the rare-earth ($RE$)
sites in the bulk $RE_2$NiMnO$_6$. Below $T_\mathrm{c}$, Raman spectroscopy
measurement finds a deviation from anharmonic behavior, where the phonon
renormalization aligns with a mean-field approximation of spin-spin
correlation. At lower temperature, magnetic $RE$ ions also contributed to the
magnetic behavior and the system displays a reentrant spin-glass-like behavior.
This study demonstrates that while a mean-field approach serves as a viable
starting point for predicting the long-range transition temperature,
microscopic details of the complex magnetic interactions are essential for
understanding the low-temperature phase.

This work presents a fully theoretical and self consistent framework for
calculating the third-order nonlinear susceptibility of CdSe/ZnS--MOF composite
quantum dots. The approach unifies finite-potential quantum confinement,the
Liouville von Neumann density matrix expansion to third order, and
effective-medium electrodynamics (Maxwell--Garnett and Bruggeman) within a
single Hamiltonian-based model, requiring no empirical fitting. Electron hole
quantized states and dipole matrix elements are obtained under the
effective-mass approximation with BenDaniel--Duke boundary conditions; closed
analytic forms for(including Lorentzian/Voigt broadening) follow from the
response expansion. Homogenization yields macroscopic scaling laws that link
microscopic descriptors (core radius, shell thickness, dielectric mismatch) to
bulk coefficients and. A Kramers--Kronig consistency check confirms causality
and analyticity of the computed spectra with small residuals. The formalism
provides a predictive, parameter-transparent route to engineer third-order
nonlinearity in hybrid quantum materials,clarifying how size and environment
govern the magnitude and dispersion of.

Strain engineering is a powerful strategy for tuning the optoelectronic
properties in two-dimensional materials, yet the underlying mechanisms
governing their strain response are often not fully elucidated. In this work,
our first-principle calculations show that the penta-orthorhombic PdS$_2$
monolayer exhibits two key strain-tunable properties: a continuous redshift of
its main optical absorption peak from $\sim$2.0 to $\sim$1.6~eV and enhancement
in carrier mobility, with a more than threefold increase for electron under
0--4\% biaxial tensile strain. Subsequent analysis reveals that the tunable
optical response originates from a robust band nesting feature between the
highest valence and lowest conduction bands, which is preserved across the
Brillouin zone under biaxial strain. For the carrier transport, deformation
potential theory predicts mobility increasing with strain, strongly correlating
with the reduction of carrier effective mass. Our first-principles calculations
show a strain-induced monotonic decrease in carrier linewidths near the band
edges, indicating suppressed carrier-phonon scattering and longer carrier
lifetime as the origin of the mobility enhancement. Our work establishes a
pathway for engineering the optoelectronic response in 2D semiconductors where
strong band nesting governs the optical properties and paves the way for the
rational design of continuously tunable flexible optoelectronic devices.

Atom-centered electric multipole moments can be extremely useful in chemistry
as they enable the systematic mapping of a complex electrostatic problem to a
simpler model. However, since they do not correspond to physical observables,
there is no unique way to define them. In this work, we present an extension of
the dynamically generated RESP charges (D-RESP) method, referred to as xDRESP,
where atom-centered multipoles are computed from mixed quantum
mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) molecular dynamics simulations. We
compare the ability of xDRESP charges to reproduce the electrostatic potential,
as well as molecular multipoles, against the performance of fixed point-charge
models commonly used in force fields. Moreover, we highlight cases where DRESP
atomic multipoles can provide valuable information about chemical systems, such
as indicating when polarization plays a significant role, and chemical
reactions, in which xDRESP atomic multipoles can be used as an on-the-fly
analysis tool to track changes in electron density.

We propose a four-bands model describing the electron energy spectra near the
Weyl points in the topological semimetals of the TaAs family (TaAs, TaP, NbAs,
NbP). This model takes into account the fact that these Weyl points result from
the band-contact lines which would exist in the mirror-reflection planes of
these materials if the spin-orbit interaction were absent in them. Within this
model, we obtain conditions for the existence of the Weyl points, determine
their positions in the Brillouin zone, and derive the explicit formula for
dispersion of the bands along the straight line connecting the two close Weyl
points with opposite topological charges. Using NbP as an example, the values
of the parameters defining the model spectrum are found. The obtained results
show that for the semimetals of the TaAs family, the charge-carriers spectrum
in the vicinity of the two close Weyl points can be analyzed without complex
band-structure calculations.

### Parity Anomalous Semimetal with Minimal Conductivity Induced by an In-Plane Magnetic Field

- **TL;DR**: 通过面内磁场在磁性拓扑三明治结构中实现了宇称反常半金属相，该相具有单个无配对的无能隙狄拉克锥和半整数量子化霍尔电导率。

The interplay between topological materials and local symmetry breaking gives
rise to diverse topological quantum phenomena. A notable example is the parity
anomalous semimetal (PAS), which hosts a single unpaired gapless Dirac cone
with a half-integer quantized Hall conductivity. Here, we realize this phase in
a magnetic topological sandwich structure by applying an in-plane magnetic
field. This configuration aligns the magnetization of one surface in-plane
while preserving magnetization out-of-plane on the opposite surface, satisfying
the condition for a gapless surface state near the Fermi level on only one
surface. Our key evidence is a distinctive two-stage evolution of the
conductivity tensor ($\sigma_{xy}$, $\sigma_{xx}$). The first stage culminates
in the PAS at the fixed point ($\frac{e^2}{2h}$, $m \frac{e^2}{h}$), where $m
\approx 0.6$ corresponds to the minimal longitudinal conductivity of a single
gapless Dirac cone of fermions on a 2D lattice. This PAS state remains
stabilized and is superposed with a gapped band flow in the second stage. This
observation demonstrates that this state stabilized by the in-plane field
resists localization--contrary to conventional expectations for 2D electron
systems with broken time reversal symmetry. The dynamic transition from an
integer quantized insulator to a half-integer quantized semimetal establishes
this material system as a versatile platform for exploring parity anomaly
physics.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种多尺度量子力学/经典力学方法，用于模拟分子在等离子体纳米结构上的表面增强红外吸收光谱，结合DFT描述分子和ωFQ/ωFQFμ模型描述等离子体材料。

We present a multiscale quantum mechanics/classical (QM/MM) approach for
modeling surface-enhanced infrared absorption (SEIRA) spectra of molecules
adsorbed on plasmonic nanostructures. The molecular subsystem is described at
the density functional theory (DFT) level, while the plasmonic material is
represented using fully atomistic, frequency-dependent Fluctuating Charges
($\omega$FQ) and Fluctuating Charges and Dipoles ($\omega$FQF$\mu$) models.
These schemes enable an accurate and computationally efficient description of
the plasmonic response of both graphene-based materials and noble metal
nanostructures, achieving accuracy comparable to ab initio methods. The
proposed methodology is applied to the calculation of SEIRA spectra of adenine
adsorbed on gold nanoparticles and graphene sheets. The quality and robustness
of the approach are assessed through comparison with surface-enhanced Raman
scattering (SERS) spectra and available experimental data. The results
demonstrate that the proposed framework provides a reliable route to simulate
vibrational responses of plasmon-molecule hybrid systems.

### Anomalous Hall effect in metallic collinear antiferromagnets

- **TL;DR**: 本文提出了反铁磁体中反常霍尔效应的最小模型，通过理论分析发现该效应仅在某些奈尔序方向上被允许，其机制源于动量依赖交换相互作用与自旋轨道耦合的相互作用。

In this paper we propose and theoretically study minimal models of all
N\'{e}el ordered collinear antiferromagnets which show the anomalous Hall
effect. For simplicity we consider two-dimensional models of antiferromagnets
with two magnetic sublattices on a square lattice. Examples of N\'{e}el ordered
ferrimagnet and of Dzyaloshinskii's weak ferromagnet are given. Turov's
invariants of existence of the magnetization in N\'{e}el ordered
antiferromagnets for proposed systems are analyzed. As a result, we obtain that
the anomalous Hall effect is allowed only for certain directions of the
N\'{e}el order defined by the crystal lattice symmetries. We derive the
mechanism of the anomalous Hall effect in antiferromagnets to be the interplay
of momentum-dependent exchange interaction of conducting fermions with the
N\'{e}el order, and the spin-orbit coupling consistent with the broken
symmetries that allowed for the Turov's invariant in the system.

### Non-altermagnetic spin texture in MnTe

Recently, altermagnets have emerged as promising candidates in spintronics,
uniquely combining large spin-polarized electronic states with zero net
magnetization. A prominent example is $\alpha$-MnTe, whose altermagnetic spin
splitting, i.e., the degeneracy lift in momentum space induced by collinear
magnetic order, has been experimentally observed. However, the direct evidence
of its $g$-wave spin polarization, the key property for altermagnetic
spintronics, is thus far lacking. By combining high-resolution spin- and
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (SARPES) with first-principles
calculations, we reveal a $k_z$-independent, Rashba-like spin texture in
$\alpha$-MnTe. Our results indicate that the observed spin polarization is
primarily governed by spin-orbit coupling, whereas the magnetic order
contributes to the splitting of energy bands but plays a much less dominant
role in spin polarization due to the multi-domain nature. From this result, we
further establish a way to prescreen altermagnet candidates that favor the
formation of large antiferromagnetic domains based on symmetry analysis. Our
work elucidates the interplay between magnetic order and spin-orbit coupling in
governing spin polarization in altermagnet candidates, and thereby advances the
materials design paradigm for spin-functional devices.

### First-principles Prediction of Carrier Mobility in Semiconductor Nanowires Based on the Spatially Dependent Boltzmann Transport Equation

Carrier mobility in bulk semiconductors is typically governed by
electron-phonon (e-ph) scattering. In nanostructures, spatial confinement can
lead to significant surface scattering, lowering mobility and breaking the
spatial homogeneity assumption of conventional models. In this work, a fully ab
initio framework based on the spatially dependent Boltzmann transport equation
for one-dimensional nanowires is developed. We apply it to Si and GaN assuming
diffusive surface scattering, and reveal the mobility-diameter relation:
$\mu_\mathrm{1D} = \mu_\mathrm{bulk}
\left[1-\left(d/d_0\right)^{-\beta}\right]$. The parameter $d_0$, comparable to
the carrier mean free path, defines a boundary layer exhibiting a considerable
mobility gradient, and also quantifies the competition between e-ph and surface
scattering together with $\beta$. We further discuss the effects of
orientation, cross-sectional shape, and temperature. Moreover, experimental
data are generally lower than our predictions, possibly due to structural
imperfections, systematic errors from measurements, etc. Therefore, our
theoretical method can provide an intrinsic benchmark toward optimized
experimental realizations.

### Suppression of auxetic behavior in black phosphorus with sulfur substitution

- **TL;DR**: 硫掺杂黑磷(b-P)通过密度泛函理论计算系统研究，发现硫取代会抑制黑磷的负泊松比(拉胀行为)，改变其弹性、机械和电子性质，导致金属化。

Sulfur-doped black phosphorus (b-P) has recently emerged as a promising
candidate for next-generation electronic and optoelectronic technologies owing
to its enhanced environmental stability and tunable electronic properties. In
this work, we systematically investigate the effects of sulfur substitution on
the elastic, mechanical, and electronic properties of b-P, with a particular
focus on its auxetic behavior (that is, negative Poisson's ratio), using
first-principles density functional theory calculations. Our results unveil the
fundamental origin of the intrinsic auxetic response in pristine b-P and
elucidate how sulfur incorporation alters this behavior. We find that sulfur
atoms distort the characteristic bow-tie structural motif responsible for the
negative Poisson's ratio in b-P, thereby suppressing the in-plane auxeticity.
Moreover, the resulting charge redistribution also effectively quenches the
out-of-plane auxetic response of b-P. With increasing sulfur content, the bulk
modulus and Poisson's ratio increase, whereas the Young's modulus, shear
modulus, and Debye temperature decrease. Additionally, sulfur substitution
suppresses the semiconducting properties of b-P, giving rise to metallicity.
These findings highlight that although sulfur substitution enhances the
environmental stability of b-P, it also substantially modifies its elastic and
mechanical properties, particularly the auxetic behavior, which is an important
consideration in the design of nanoscale electronic devices.

Monazite (CePO4) is widely used in U-Th-Pb geochronology due to its reliable
age determinations, although isotopic disturbances often require nanoscale
investigation to better understand the mechanisms at play. Atom Probe
Tomography (APT) offers unique capabilities for nanoscale chemical analysis and
3D atomic reconstruction but presents challenges for insulating materials such
as CePO4, particularly due to oxygen loss during field evaporation. This study
investigates the effects of laser wavelength, energy, metallic coatings and
detection device on mass spectrum optimization and compositional accuracy in
synthetic CePO4 samples. Results show that shorter laser wavelengths (260 nm)
enhance peak resolution, particularly when combined with advanced reflectron
configurations, as demonstrated with the LEAP 6000 XR. Chromium coatings
further improve thermal dissipation and reduce noise levels. However,
compositional measurements reveal systematic underestimation of oxygen and
overestimation of P and Ce, likely influenced by preferential low-field element
evaporation. These findings highlight the need to carefully tune experimental
parameters to mitigate quantification biases and enhance the reliability of APT
analyses for geological materials.

### Time-Reversed Superfluorescence in a Polaronic Quantum Material

Superfluorescence, the cooperative burst of spontaneous emission from an
ensemble of dipoles, arises when microscopic oscillators spontaneously
synchronize their phases. Here we show that this process can be reversed in
time within quantum materials. Coherent multidimensional spectroscopy of halide
perovskite quantum dots reveals a delayed cooperative absorption burst, the
mirror image of superfluorescent emission, driven by transient polaron fields
that phase-lock unit-cell dipoles within 100 fs. The effect scales
systematically with quantum-dot size and halide composition, reaching
near-unity coherence fidelity even at 300 K. A microscopic exciton-polaron
model reproduces the buildup and decay of the coherent state, identifying
lattice polarons as the mediators of synchronization. These results demonstrate
that many-body temporal coherence can self-organize and persist at room
temperature, opening routes toward engineered collective optical states and
superabsorbing quantum devices.

- **TL;DR**: 通过氢注入实现GaAsN纳米线带隙的可逆、可调和无损调节，带隙可增加高达460 meV，并展示了局部带隙调谐能力。

Bandgap engineering in semiconductors is required for the development of
photonic and optoelectronic devices with optimized absorption and emission
energies. This is usually achieved by changing the chemical or structural
composition during growth or by dynamically applying strain. Here, the bandgap
in GaAsN nanowires grown on Si is increased post-growth by up to 460 meV in a
reversible, tunable, and non-destructive manner through H implantation. Such a
bandgap tunability is unattained in epilayers and enabled by relaxed strain
requirements in nanowire heterostructures, which enables N concentrations of up
to 4.2% in core-shell GaAs/GaAsN/GaAs nanowires resulting in a GaAsN bandgap as
low as 0.97 eV. Using micro-photoluminescence measurements on individual
nanowires, it is shown that the high bandgap energy of GaAs at 1.42 eV is
restored by hydrogenation through formation of N-H complexes. By carefully
optimizing the hydrogenation conditions, the photoluminescence efficiency
increases by an order of magnitude. Moreover, by controlled thermal annealing,
the large shift of the bandgap is not only made reversible, but also
continuously tuned by breaking up N-H complexes in the hydrogenated GaAsN.
Finally, local bandgap tuning by laser annealing is demonstrated, opening up
new possibilities for developing novel, locally and energy-controlled quantum
structures in GaAsN nanowires.
