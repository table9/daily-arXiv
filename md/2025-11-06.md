- **TL;DR**: 通过分析几何阻挫磁性材料冷却时释放的熵，揭示了低能磁态结构，发现高自旋三角晶格层状化合物的最低能态可用单个磁性位点上的双重态描述。

The entropy that an insulating magnetic material releases upon cooling can
reveal important information about the properties of spin states in that
material. In many geometrically frustrated (GF) magnetic compounds, the heat
capacity exhibits a low-temperature peak that comes from the spin states
continuously connected to the ground states of classical models, such as the
Ising model, on the same GF lattice, which manifests in the amount of entropy
associated with this heat-capacity peak. In this work, we simulate numerically
the values of entropy released by higher-spin triangular-lattice layered
systems and materials on SCGO lattices. We also compare the experimentally
measured values of entropy in several strongly GF compounds, $NiGa_2S_4$,
$FeAl_2Se_4$ and SCGO/BSZCGO, with possible theoretical values inferred from
the classical models to which the quantum states of those materials may be
connected. This comparison suggests that the lowest-energy states of
higher-spin layered triangular-lattice compounds can be described in terms of
doublet states on individual magnetic sites. Our analyses demonstrate how the
values of entropy can reveal the structure of low-energy magnetic states in GF
compounds and call for more accurate thermodynamic measurement in GF magnetic
materials.

- **TL;DR**: CoTe₂和NiTe₂是拓扑狄拉克II型金属，其d带未表现出CoO和NiO中预期的关联诱导带窄化。研究发现这是由于负电荷转移能和减小的库仑相互作用导致的，这种电子结构框架是实现拓扑金属中带反转的关键。

The layered $3d$ transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) CoTe$_2$ and
NiTe$_2$ are topological Dirac Type-II metals. Their $d$-bands do not exhibit
the expected correlation-induced band narrowing seen in CoO and NiO. We address
this conundrum by quantifying the on-site Coulomb energy $U_{dd}$ via
single-particle partial density of states and the two-hole correlation
satellite using valence band resonant photoemission spectroscopy (PES), and
obtain $U_{dd}$ = 3.0 eV/3.7 eV for CoTe$_2$/NiTe$_2$. Charge-transfer (CT)
cluster model simulations of the measured core-level PES and x-ray absorption
spectra of CoTe$_2$ and CoO validate their contrasting electronic
parameters:$U_{dd}$ and CT energy $\Delta$ are (3.0 eV, -2.0 eV) for CoTe$_2$,
and (5.0 eV, 4.0 eV) for CoO, respectively. The $d$-$p$ hybridization strength
$T_{eg}$ for CoTe$_2$$&lt;$CoO, and indicates that the reduced $U_{dd}$ in
CoTe$_2$ is not due to $T_{eg}$. The increase in $d^n$-count$\sim$1 by CT from
ligand to Co site in CoTe$_2$ is due to a negative-$\Delta$ and reduced
$U_{dd}$. Yet, only because $U_{dd}$$&gt;$$\big|\Delta\big|$, CoTe$_{2}$ becomes a
topological metal with $p$$\rightarrow$${p}$ type lowest energy excitations.
Similarly, we obtain a negative-$\Delta$ and reduced $U_{dd}$ in NiTe$_2$
compared to NiO. The study reveals the nexus between negative-$\Delta$ and
reduced $U_{dd}$ required for setting up the electronic structure framework for
achieving topological behavior via band inversion in correlated metals.

### Moiré modulated quantum spin liquid candidate 1T-TaSe$_2$

- **TL;DR**: 该研究使用扫描隧道显微镜和谱学技术探测二维量子自旋液体候选材料1T-TaSe₂，通过非弹性隧穿谱直接测量其低能激发，发现与调制√3×√3自旋液体基态一致的实验证据。

Quantum spin liquids are quantum phases of matter featuring collectively
entangled states and emergent fractional many-body excitations. While methods
exist to probe three-dimensional quantum spin liquids experimentally, these
techniques lack the sensitivity to probe two-dimensional quantum spin liquids.
This seriously hampers the study of potential monolayer quantum spin liquid
candidates such as $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ and 1T-TaSe$_2$. Scanning tunneling
microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) have recently been suggested as
promising probes of the quantum spin liquid state, as they can access the
spinon spectrum through inelastic tunneling spectroscopy (IETS). In this work,
we employ this approach on the quantum spin liquid candidate material
1T-TaSe$_2$ and directly measure its low-energy inelastic excitations. We
observe the emergence of a $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ reconstruction driven by
the substrate, equivalent spectroscopy across all spin sites and coexistence of
zero and finite energy excitations. We show that these observations are
consistent with a modulated $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ spin liquid ground state.
Our results demonstrate that IETS provides a powerful route to obtain
atomic-scale insight into the magnetic excitations of two-dimensional
materials, allowing to explore the effects of moir\'e modulations on potential
quantum liquid phases.

### Free Majorana Modes in Superconducting Quantum Wires

- **TL;DR**: 本文通过磁性自旋1/2杂质与Luther-Emery线中的自旋束缚态相互作用，展示了如何在超导导线模型中实现零能马约拉纳费米子（马约拉纳零模），并建立了s波和p波超导导线之间的对应关系。

An s-wave superconducting wire with attractive interactions can admit a
zero-energy bound state equation (solution) at an edge similar to the
Jackiw-Rebbi model; this is a specific aspect of low-dimensional quantum
systems, Dirac equation and e.g. of the Luther-Emery liquid with a spin gap. In
this Letter, K. Le Hur Europhys. Lett., 49 (6), pp. 768-774 (2000), I
introduced a magnetic spin-1/2 impurity interacting with such a (spin) bound
state in a Luther-Emery wire representing then a Hubbard ladder in a d-wave
superconducting state. This method is general and show how Majorana fermions at
zero energy, i.e. Majorana zero modes, can take place in a superconducting wire
model from the two-channel Kondo effect. Within these two channels (wires), the
Luther-Emery form of the superconducting term can be reached within the
weak-coupling attractive limit. Due to the interest in Majorana zero modes from
magnetic impurities interacting with an s-wave superconductor, I take time to
analyze zero-energy edge solutions in my model and present a correspondence
with the p-wave superconducting wire in the topological phase through
alternatives versions of the quantum field theory. I develop the relation
between the edge magnetic susceptibility and the local capacitance measure in a
p-wave superconducting wire. I elaborate on the idea that Majorana zero modes,
i.e. free Majorana fermions, can be realized with magnetic impurities bridging
the gap between two s-wave superconducting wires. The spin gap and the
resonance with the impurity can protect the free Majorana solutions when
including perturbations.

### Dynamics of excitons in CdSe nanoplatelets

We show how to calculate the linear and nonlinear optical functions of CdSe
nanoplatelets, taking into account the effect of a dielectric confinement on
excitonic states. We consider both stationary and non-stationary excitation
regime. We obtain obtain analytical expressions for the absorption coefficient,
the exciton resonance energy and binding energy of nanoplatelets. The impact of
plate geometry (thickness, lateral dimension) on the spectrum is discussed. In
the nonlinear case we analyze the impact of temperature. For the short-pulse
excitation the time dependence of the spectra is considered. The results are
compared with the available experimental data.

### Niobium's intrinsic coherence length and penetration depth revisited using low-energy muon spin spectroscopy

- **TL;DR**: 通过低能μ子自旋光谱技术测量氧掺杂铌的伦敦穿透深度和BCS相干长度，发现清洁铌位于I型和II型超导边界，可能本质上是I型超导体。

We report measurements of the London penetration depth ($\lambda_L$) and
Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) coherence length ($\xi_0$) in oxygen-doped
niobium, with impurity concentrations spanning the "clean" to "dirty" limits.
Depth-resolved low-energy muon spin spectroscopy (LE-$\mu$SR) was used to
quantify the element's Meissner screening profiles, analyzed within a framework
that accounts for nonlocal electrodynamics. The analysis indicates intrinsic
length scales of $\lambda_L = 29.1(10)$ nm and $\xi_0 = 39.9(25)$ nm,
corresponding to a Ginzburg-Landau (GL) parameter of $\kappa = 0.70(5)$. The
obtained $\lambda_L$ and $\kappa$ value are smaller than values commonly used
in applications and modeling, indicating that clean niobium lies at the
boundary between type-I and type-II superconductivity, supporting the
contemporary view that its intrinsic state may be type-I.

### Modal Backflow Neural Quantum States for Anharmonic Vibrational Calculations

- **TL;DR**: 本文提出了一种模态回流（MBF）神经网络量子态设计，用于解决玻色子系统的非简谐振动问题，通过选择性配置方案和预训练策略实现了光谱级精度的振动能量计算。

Neural quantum states (NQS) are a promising ansatz for solving many-body
quantum problems due to their inherent expressiveness. Yet, this expressiveness
can only be harnessed efficiently for treating identical particles if the
suitable physical knowledge is hardwired into the neural network itself. For
electronic structure, NQS based on backflow determinants has been shown to be a
powerful ansatz for capturing strong correlation. By contrast, the analogue for
bosons, backflow permanents, is unpractical due to the steep cost of computing
the matrix permanent and due to the lack of particle conservation in common
bosonic problems. To circumvent these obstacles, we introduce a modal backflow
(MBF) NQS design and demonstrate its efficacy by solving the anharmonic
vibrational problem. To accommodate the demand of high accuracy in
spectroscopic calculations, we implement a selected-configuration scheme for
evaluating physical observables and gradients, replacing the standard
stochastic approach based on Monte Carlo sampling. A vibrational
self-consistent field calculation is conveniently carried out within the MBF
network, which serves as a pretraining step to accelerate and stabilize the
optimization. In applications to both artificial and ab initio Hamiltonians, we
find that the MBF network is capable of delivering spectroscopically accurate
zero-point energies and vibrational transitions in all anharmonic regimes.

### Revisiting Nishimori multicriticality through the lens of information measures

- **TL;DR**: 该论文将量子信息度量扩展到Nishimori线之外，证明了相干信息等指标可作为相变的精确指示器。在2D随机键Ising模型中，所有统计和信息理论指标提取的临界点高度一致，相干信息表现出最小的有限尺寸效应。

The quantum error correction threshold is closely related to the Nishimori
physics of random statistical models. We extend quantum information measures
such as coherent information beyond the Nishimori line and establish them as
sharp indicators of phase transitions. We derive exact inequalities for several
generalized measures, demonstrating that each attains its extremum along the
Nishimori line. Using a fermionic transfer matrix method, we compute these
quantities in the 2d $\pm J$ random-bond Ising model-corresponding to a surface
code under bit-flip noise-on system sizes up to $512$ and over $10^7$ disorder
realizations. All critical points extracted from statistical and
information-theoretic indicators coincide with high precision at
$p_c=0.1092212(4)$, with the coherent information exhibiting the smallest
finite-size effects. We further analyze the domain-wall free energy
distribution and confirm its scale invariance at the multicritical point.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种求解多层系统中正电子扩散方程的方法，包含材料特定的注入剖面、扩散参数和正电子亲和力，使用马尔可夫链方法模拟湮灭概率，并提供实验S参数数据的拟合功能。

We present a method for solving the positron diffusion equation in
multi-layer systems. Our approach incorporates material-specific implantation
profiles, diffusion parameters, and positron affinities. It utilizes a Markov
chain approach to model annihilation probabilities and provides fitting
capabilities for experimental S (lineshape) parameter data. We have implemented
this algorithm in Python and made it available for free under the name LIMPID.
To demonstrate its performance, we analyze depth-resolved Doppler-Broadening
Spectroscopy measurements of a Cu layer on a Si substrate, achieving excellent
agreement with the experimental profiles. The LIMPID tool enhances the
reproducibility and comparability of positron defect characterization
measurements across different research groups.

### SC$^*$ Superconductivity and Spin Stiffnesses in the SU(2) Gauge Theory of the Two-Dimensional Hubbard Model

- **TL;DR**: 本文研究了二维Hubbard模型中SU(2)规范理论下的自旋涨落，发现超导态SC*会显著抑制空间和时间自旋刚度，增强量子自旋涨落，从而稳定量子无序态。

We consider the SU(2) gauge theory for spin fluctuations in the
two-dimensional Hubbard model, where the electron field is fractionalized in
terms of spinons and chargons. In this theory, spinons are described by a
non-linear sigma model, while chargons are treated as fermions at a mean-field
level. We investigate the instability to a superconducting state SC*, arising
from a fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*) where pairing between chargons occurs.
Consistent with previous studies, our analysis reveals a coexisting phase
characterized by both magnetic and superconducting order for the chargons. The
central contribution of this work is the calculation of the feedback of
superconductivity on spatial and temporal spin stiffnesses, thereby quantifying
its impact on spin fluctuations. Our key finding is that superconductivity
significantly suppresses these spin stiffnesses, enhancing quantum spin
fluctuations. This enhancement suggests that superconductivity can play a
crucial role in stabilizing quantum disorder against long-range magnetic
ordering.

### Dynamics of Cu2O Rydberg Excitons -- Kerr Effect and Quantum Beats

We investigate the nonlinear refraction and the nonlinear Kerr phase shift
which are due to Rydberg excitons induced in Cu2O crystal by short-time pulses.
We observe the phenomenon of quantum beats, analogous to that observed in
exciton emission spectra, obtained in the same conditions. The calculated
temporal evolution show dependence on the exciton state number, the applied
laser power, and quantities related to dissipative processes.

### The theory of planar ballistic SNS junctions

- **TL;DR**: 该论文提出了平面弹道SNS结的理论，考虑了超导层中的相位梯度，解决了阶跃配对势模型中的电荷守恒问题，并推导了不同条件下的电流-相位关系。

The paper presents the theory of planar ballistic SNS junctions with equal
Fermi velocities and effective masses in all layers. The theory takes into
account phase gradients in superconducting layers commonly ignored in the past.
At $T=0$ the current-phase relation was derived for any thickness $L$ of the
normal layer in the model of the steplike pairing potential model analytically.
The obtained current-phase relation is essentially different from that in
theory neglecting phase gradients, especially in the limit $L\to 0$ (short
junction). The analysis resolves the problem with the charge conservation law
in the steplike pairing potential model. The current-phase relation at
temperatures exceeding the energy spacing between Andreev levels but less than
the critical temperature was also calculated numerically. The current at these
temperatures is temperature independent and decreases with growing $L$ as
$1/L^4$. The previous theory predicted the current exponentially decreasing
with growing $T$ and $L$. Possible implications of the analysis for planar
junctions with non-equal Fermi velocities and for non-planar junctions (narrow
normal bridge between two bulk superconductors) are also discussed.

### Enhancing composition-based materials property prediction by cross-modal knowledge transfer

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种通过跨模态知识转移增强基于成分的材料性能预测的通用方法，包括隐式和显式转移两种形式，在多个基准测试中取得了最先进性能。

Crystal graph neural networks are widely applicable in modeling
experimentally synthesized compounds and hypothetical materials with unknown
synthesizability. In contrast, structure-agnostic predictive algorithms allow
exploring previously inaccessible domains of chemical space. Here we present a
universal approach for enhancing composition-based materials property
prediction by means of cross-modal knowledge transfer. Two formulations are
proposed: implicit transfer involves pretraining chemical language models on
multimodal embeddings, whereas explicit transfer suggests generating crystal
structures and implementing structure-aware predictors. The proposed approaches
were benchmarked on LLM4Mat-Bench and MatBench tasks, achieving
state-of-the-art performance in 25 out of 32 cases. In addition, we
demonstrated how another modeling aspect of chemical language models -
interpretability - benefits from applying a game-theoretic approach, which is
able to incorporate high-order feature interactions.

### Integrability of a family of clean SYK models from the critical Ising chain

We establish the integrability of a family of SYK models with uniform
$p$-body interactions. We derive the R-matrix and mutually commuting transfer
matrices that generate the Hamiltonians of these models, and obtain their exact
eigenspectra and eigenstates. Remarkably, the R-matrix is that of the critical
transverse-field Ising chain. This work reveals an unexpected connection
between the SYK model, central to many-body quantum chaos, and the critical
Ising chain, a cornerstone of statistical mechanics.

response of charge carriers to an external magnetic field in bulk
semiconductors and semiconductor nanostructures. The linear response is

Various experimental methods for measuring the electron g factor are
considered, beginning with historical works and including modern research. A
detailed analysis of theoretical methods for calculating the electron and hole
g factors in bulk semiconductors and nanostructures of various shapes also
includes fundamental work from previous years and the present time.

### Accelerating inverse materials design using generative diffusion models with reinforcement learning

- **TL;DR**: MatInvent是一个基于强化学习的扩散模型优化工作流，用于目标导向的晶体生成，显著减少了对标记数据和属性计算的需求。

Diffusion models promise to accelerate material design by directly generating
novel structures with desired properties, but existing approaches typically
require expensive and substantial labeled data ($&gt;$10,000) and lack
adaptability. Here we present MatInvent, a general and efficient reinforcement
learning workflow that optimizes diffusion models for goal-directed crystal
generation. For single-objective designs, MatInvent rapidly converges to target
values within 60 iterations ($\sim$ 1,000 property evaluations) across
electronic, magnetic, mechanical, thermal, and physicochemical properties.
Furthermore, MatInvent achieves robust optimization in design tasks with
multiple conflicting properties, successfully proposing low-supply-chain-risk
magnets and high-$\kappa$ dielectrics. Compared to state-of-the-art methods,
MatInvent exhibits superior generation performance under specified property
constraints while dramatically reducing the demand for property computation by
up to 378-fold. Compatible with diverse diffusion model architectures and
property constraints, MatInvent could offer broad applicability in materials
discovery.

### Unraveling Deconfined Quantum Criticality in Non-Hermitian Easy-Plane $J$-$Q$ Model

- **Categories**: cond-mat.str-el
- **TL;DR**: 本文通过构建非厄米易平面J-Q模型并进行量子蒙特卡罗模拟，研究了非厄米相互作用对潜在DQCP转变的影响，发现一阶转变强度随非厄米相互作用增强而显著减弱，支持J-Q模型中的转变是准临界的观点。

Deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) characterizes the continuous
transition beyond Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm, occurring between two phases
that exhibit distinct symmetry breaking. The debate over whether genuine DQCP
exists in physical SU(2) spin systems or the transition is weakly first-order
has persisted for many years. In this letter, we construct a non-Hermitian
easy-plane $J$-$Q$ model and perform sign-problem-free quantum Monte Carlo
(QMC) simulation to explore the impact of non-Hermitian microscopic
interactions on the transition that potentially features a DQCP. Our results
demonstrate that the intensity of the first-order transitions significantly
diminishes with the amplification of non-Hermitian interactions, serving as
numerical evidence to support the notion that the transition in $J$-$Q$ model
is quasi-critical, possibly in the vicinity of the fixed point governing DQCP
in the complex plane, described by a non-unitary conformal field theory (CFT).
The non-Hermitian interaction facilitates the approach towards such a complex
fixed point in the parameter regime. Furthermore, our QMC study on the
non-Hermitian J-Q model opens a new route to numerically investigating the
nature of complex CFT in the microscopic model.

### Extrinsic anomalous Hall effect in altermagnets

- **Categories**: cond-mat.mes-hall, cond-mat.str-el
- **TL;DR**: 在约一半的反铁磁自旋劳厄群中，外禀反常霍尔电导率与内禀值相当；在有Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya相互作用的反铁磁体中，外禀贡献在清洁极限下也至关重要；而在其他反铁磁体中则基本可忽略。

We find the extrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) to be comparable to
the intrinsic one in roughly half of the altermagnetic spin Laue groups in the
limit of large exchange splitting. In materials with a finite
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya type interaction, the extrinsic contribution is essential
even in the clean limit. In other altermagnets it is mostly negligible. This
peculiar behavior is linked to the nonanalytic dependence of the intrinsic AHC
on spin-orbit coupling. Both originate from the lifting of the spin degeneracy
along the nodal planes as the weak spin-orbit coupling breaks the
nonrelativistic spin symmetry.

- **TL;DR**: 本文提出了首个基于量子增强约瑟夫森结场效应晶体管（JJFET）的电压控制超导闪存模数转换器（ADC）设计，用于深低温环境下的超低功耗数据转换。

The increasing demand for cryogenic electronics in superconducting and
quantum computing systems calls for ultra energy efficient data conversion
architectures that remain functional at deep cryogenic temperatures.In this
work, we present the first design of a voltage-controlled superconducting flash
analog-to-digital converter (ADC) based on a novel quantum enhanced Josephson
junction field effect transistor (JJFET).Exploiting its strong gate tunability
and transistor-like behavior, the JJFET offers a scalable alternative to
conventional current controlled superconducting devices while aligning
naturally with CMOS style design methodologies.Building on our previously
developed Verilog A compact model calibrated to experimental data, we design
and simulate a three bit JJFET based flash ADC.The core comparator block is
realized through careful bias current selection and augmented with a three
terminal nanocryotron to precisely define reference voltages.Cascaded JJFET
comparators ensure robust voltage gain, cascadability, and logic level
restoration across stages.Simulation results demonstrate accurate quantization
behavior with ultra-low power dissipation, underscoring the feasibility of
voltage driven superconducting mixed signal circuits.This work establishes a
critical step toward unifying superconducting logic and data conversion, paving
the way for scalable cryogenic architectures in quantum classical
co-processors, low-power AI accelerators, and next generation energy
constrained computing platforms.

- **TL;DR**: 在ORCA量子化学程序套件中实现了高效的重新归一化内部收缩多参考耦合簇单双激发(RIC-MRCCSD)方法，通过结合Evangelista的Wick方程生成器和ORCA的AGE代码生成器，实现了自旋自由公式，显著提高了计算效率。

In this paper, an efficient implementation of the renormalized
internally-contracted multreference coupled cluster with singles and doubles
(RIC-MRCCSD) into the ORCA quantum chemistry program suite is reported. To this
end, Evangelista's Wick&d equation generator was combined with ORCA's native
AGE code generator in order to implement the many-body residuals required for
the RIC-MRCCSD method. Substantial efficiency gains are realized by deriving a
spin-free formulation instead of the previously reported spin-orbital version
developed by some of us. Since AGE produces parallelized code, the resulting
implementation can directly be run in parallel with substantial speedups when
executed on multiple cores. In terms of runtime, the cost of RIC-MRCCSD is
shown to be between single-reference RHF-CCSD and UHF-CCSD, even when active
space spaces as large as CAS(14,14) are considered. This achievement is largely
due to the fact that no reduced density matrices (RDM) or cumulants higher than
three-body enter the formalism. The scalability of the method to large systems
is furthermore demonstrated by computing the ground-state of a vitamin B12
model comprised of an active space of CAS(12, 12) and 809 orbitals. In terms of
accuracy, RIC-MRCCSD is carefully compared to second- and approximate
fourth-order $n$-electron valence state perturbation theories (NEVPT2,
NEVPT4(SD)), to the multireference zeroth-order coupled-electron pair
approximation (CEPA(0)), as well as to the IC-MRCCSD from Kohn. In contrast to
RIC-MRCCSD, the IC-MRCCSD equations are entirely derived by AGE using the
conventional projection-based approach, which, however, leads to much higher
algorithmic complexity than the former as well as the necessity to calculate up
to the five-body RDMs. Remaining challenges such as the variation of the
results with the flow, a free parameter that enters the RIC-MRCCSD theory, are
discussed.

We investigate the statistical properties of one-dimensional Burgers dynamics
evolving from stochastic initial conditions defined by a Poisson point process
for the velocity potential, with a power-law intensity. Thanks to the
geometrical interpretation of the solution in the inviscid limit, in terms of
first-contact parabolas, we obtain explicit results for the multiplicity
functions of shocks and voids, and for velocity and density one- and two-point
correlation functions and power spectra. These initial conditions gives rise to
self-similar dynamics with probability distributions that display power-law
tails. In the limit where the exponent $\alpha$ of the Poisson process that
defines the initial conditions goes to infinity, the power-law tails steepen to
Gaussian falloffs and we recover the spatial distributions obtained in the
classical study by Kida (1979) of Gaussian initial conditions with vanishing
large-scale power.

Radiation-induced defects can have a significant impact on the longevity and
performance of semiconductor devices. We present an Atomistically Informed
Device Engineering (AIDE) method that integrates first-principles defect
properties and experimentally measured parameters into a device model to
dynamically simulate the defect chemistry in semiconductors. For a
silicon-doped gallium arsenide (GaAs) material, we showcase three capabilities:
(i) Fermi level $E_F$ movement including its component electron and hole Fermi
levels, (ii) dynamical charge equilibration with the arsenic vacancy serving as
an example, and a (iii) diffusion-driven reaction between Coulomb attracted
gallium interstitial ($Ga_i$) and arsenic vacancy ($v_{As}$). Governed by
charge carrier reactions, the electron and hole Fermi levels remained
dissimilar until equilibrium was achieved at $E_F\approx1.32$ eV. The
equilibrium Fermi level was verified by successfully identifying $v_{As}^{3-}$
as the most populated charge state within the arsenic vacancy defect. Lastly, a
Coulomb attraction, created by the shifted Fermi level and the charge
equilibration process, between $Ga_i^{1+}$ and $v_{As}^{3-}$ resulted in the
formation of a doubly negative gallium antisite ($Ga_{As}^{2-}$). The AIDE
method can access experimentally inaccessible short-time and low-concentration
regimes, is generalizable to other more complex systems (e.g., indium gallium
arsenide), and, after solving open problems in GaAs, will serve as a virtual
experiment to bound estimates for difficult-to-measure physical quantities.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一个系统框架来分析铜(II)酞菁分子自旋量子比特的横向弛豫机制，发现电子-电子偶极相互作用是主要的退相干通道，而非核自旋耦合。

Molecular spin qubits are promising candidates for quantum technologies, but
their performance is limited by decoherence arising from diverse mechanisms.
The complexity of the environment makes it challenging to identify the main
source of noise and target it for mitigation. Here we present a systematic
experimental and theoretical framework for analyzing the mechanisms of
transverse relaxation in copper(II) phthalocyanine (CuPc) diluted into
diamagnetic phthalocyanine hosts. Using pulsed EPR spectroscopy together with
first-principles cluster correlation expansion simulations, we quantitatively
separate the contributions from hyperfine-coupled nuclear spins, spin--lattice
relaxation, and electron--electron dipolar interactions. Our detailed modeling
shows that both strongly and weakly coupled nuclei contribute negligibly to
$T_2$, while longitudinal dipolar interactions with electronic spins, through
instantaneous and spectral diffusion, constitute the main decoherence channel
even at moderate spin densities. This conclusion is validated by direct
comparison between simulated spin-echo dynamics and experimental data. By
providing a robust modeling and experimental approach, our work identifies
favorable values of the electron spin density for quantum applications, and
provides a transferable methodology for predicting ensemble coherence times.
These insights will guide the design and optimization of molecular spin qubits
for scalable quantum devices.

We investigate quantum effects on magnon excitations in a minimal spin-1/2
Heisenberg model for 2D altermagnets on the square lattice. A continuous
similarity transformation is applied in momentum space to derive an effective
Hamiltonian that conserves the number of magnon excitations. This allows us to
quantitatively calculate the one-magnon dispersion, the effects of
magnon-magnon interactions, and the dynamic structure factor in a certain range
of parameters. In particular, we focus on the altermagnetic spin splitting of
the magnon bands and the size of the roton minimum. We further map out
divergencies of the continuous similarity transformation for different types of
generators, which signal either the breakdown of the N\'eel-ordered phase or
the presence of significant magnon decay.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文发现了一种新的非互易磁输运机制——洛伦兹偏散射，在BiTeBr材料中主导了NRMT效应，并揭示了前所未有的四次方标度律。

In materials with broken inversion symmetry, nonreciprocal magneto-transport
(NRMT) manifests as a bilinear dependence of charge conductivity on applied
electric (E) and magnetic (B) fields. This phenomenon is deeply rooted in
symmetry and electronic quantum geometry, holding promise for novel
rectification and detector technologies. Existing experimental studies
generally attribute NRMT to Zeeman-driven mechanisms and exhibit quadratic
scaling with conductivity. Here, we report a previously unknown NRMT
microscopic mechanism - Lorentz skew scattering (LSK) - revealed through the
discovery of an unprecedented quartic scaling law of NRMT as well as
quantitative agreement between theory and experiment in BiTeBr. LSK emerges
from the interplay of Lorentz force and skew scattering, bridging classical
field effect to quantum scattering effect on the Fermi surface. We demonstrate
that the LSK dominates NRMT in BiTeBr, and elucidate that this dominance over
other possible contributions stems from high mobility and strong Rashba
splitting. The finding of LSK mechanism is of unique importance because it
unveils the leading NRMT effect in high-mobility systems and suggests a
universal principle towards strong NRMT by enhancing electronic relaxation time
in topological materials, rendering a new designing idea for low-dissipation
rectifiers and high-performance quantum electronics.

- **TL;DR**: 本文通过求解麦克斯韦方程和伦敦方程，详细研究了超导体中迈斯纳效应和贝克尔-伦敦效应的动力学过程，证明传统理论能够正确描述这些效应的动态行为。

It is generally accepted that the most fundamental property of a
superconductor is that it exhibits the Meissner effect. Of similar importance
is the Becker-London effect, i.e. generation of magnetic field inside a
rotating superconductor. Hirsch has recently pointed out that, within the
conventional theory of superconductivity, the question about how these effects
are generated dynamically has not even been asked yet. Here we fill in this gap
in the literature by a detailed study of the evolution of the electromagnetic
field for both of these effects. To this end, we solve the Maxwell equations
supplemented by the simplest conventional constitutive equation for a
superconductor, namely the London equation. We demonstrate that, contrary to
the expectations of Hirsch, the conventional theory does correctly describe the
dynamics of both, the Meissner and the Becker-London effect. We find that the
dynamics of the studied processes is quite rich and interesting even at this
level of description.

We propose a system-oriented basis-set design based on even-tempered basis
functions to variationally encode electronic ground-state information into
molecular orbitals. First, we introduce a reduced formalism of concentric
even-tempered orbitals that achieves hydrogen energy accuracy on par with the
conventional formalism, with lower optimization cost and improved scalability.
Second, we propose a symmetry-adapted, even-tempered formalism specifically
designed for molecular systems. It requires only primitive S-subshell
Gaussian-type orbitals and uses two parameters to characterize all exponent
coefficients. In the case of the diatomic hydrogen molecule, the basis set
generated by this formalism produces a dissociation curve more consistent with
cc-pV5Z than cc-pVTZ at the size of aug-cc-pVDZ. Finally, we test our
even-tempered formalism against several types of tetra-atomic hydrogen
molecules for ground-state computation and point out its current limitations
and potential improvements.

the epitaxial strontium iridate (SrIrO$_3$) and iridate/manganite
SrIrO$_3$/La$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$MnO$_3$ heterostructure have been investigated.
The influence of epitaxial strain relaxation caused by the lattice mismatch

(LaAlO$_3$)$_{0.3}$(Sr$_2$TaAlO$_6$)$_{0.7}$, LaAlO$_3$, and
Pb(Mg$_{1/3}$Nb$_{2/3}$)O$_3$-PbTiO$_3$ on electron and magnetic transport has
been observed. A pronounced impact of strong spin-orbit interaction on
characteristics of SrIrO$_3$ films has been revealed by means of X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy, magnetoresistance and Hall-resistance measurements
at temperatures T = 2-300 K. These findings highlight the tunability of
spin-orbit-driven transport phenomena in strain-controlled SrIrO$_3$-based
epitaxial systems, relevant for future spintronic oxide heterostructures. The
contribution of Kondo scattering on temperature dependence of SrIrO$_3$ films
resistance was observed.

We present the first open access version of the QMeCha (Quantum MeCha) code,
a quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) package developed to study many-body interactions
between different types of quantum particles, with a modular and easy-to-expand
structure. The present code has been built to solve the Hamiltonian of a system
that can include nuclei and fermions of different mass and charge, e.g.
electrons and positrons, embedded in an environment of classical charges and
quantum Drude oscillators. To approximate the ground state of this
many-particle operator, the code features different wavefunctions. For the
fermionic particles, beyond the traditional Slater determinant, QMeCha also
includes Geminal functions such as the Pfaffian, and presents different types
of explicit correlation terms in the Jastrow factors. The classical point
charges and quantum Drude oscillators, described through different variational
ans\"atze, are used to model a molecular environment capable of explicitly
describing dispersion, polarization, and electrostatic effects experienced by
the nuclear and fermionic subsystem. To integrate these wavefunctions,
efficient variational Monte Carlo and diffusion Monte Carlo protocols have been
developed, together with a robust wavefunction optimization procedure that
features correlated sampling. In conclusion, QMeCha is a massively parallel
code introduced here to explore quantum correlation effects in mixed systems
with thousands of fermions and bosonic particles, beyond what was previously
accessible to other reference methods.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究发现EuSn2As2中的平面纳米缺陷形成了EuSnAs2相，这些缺陷在反铁磁主体晶格中产生局部铁磁有序，解释了该材料的反常磁学性质。

We report a study of nano-scale structural peculiarities of the
antiferromagnetic layered semimetal EuSn2As2, and show that they are
responsible for its puzzling magnetic properties. The high resolution
transmission electron microscopy revealed the presence of planar defects in the
lattice of the studied single crystals. Using a combination of microstructural
and DFT analysis we demonstrated that a single planar nano-defects forms a
layer of a distinct phase EuSnAs2, that is different from the EuSn2As2 phase of
the bulk lattice. The smaller distance between Eu layers in the planar
nano-defect promotes formation of local ferromagnetic (FM) ordering of the Eu
atoms. On average, the planar defects form a weak ferromagnetic phase in the
antiferromagnetic (AFM) host lattice. The obtained results explain several
puzzling features in magnetic properties of A-type AFM materials: the nonlinear
magnetization in low in-plane fields, ferromagnetic-type hysteresis in low
field, and the upturn of the magnetic susceptibility in the AFM state at
temperatures approaching zero.

- **TL;DR**: 在石墨烯-hBN莫尔超晶格中发现了一种由洛伦兹偏斜散射引起的巨大非线性霍尔效应，该效应通过垂直磁场驱动，产生创纪录的高非线性霍尔电导率。

The nonlinear Hall effect (NHE) can enable rectification and energy
harvesting, and its control by external fields, including gate, strain and
magnetic field, has been pursued intensively. However, existing tuning pathways
rely predominantly on fully quantum mechanical effects and are typically
inefficient, resulting in weak NHE signals that limit further progress. In this
work, we report the discovery of a distinct type of NHE in a graphene-hBN moire
superlattice, which arises from a classical-quantum cooperative effect called
Lorentz skew scattering (LSK), induced by a perpendicular magnetic field. This
field-driven NHE exhibits a linear dependence on magnetic field and a
pronounced unidirectional angular dependence. Remarkably, its magnitude reaches
up to 32% of the linear Hall signal. We show that this giant, field-tunable NHE
originating from LSK follows a unique quartic scaling law and produces a
record-high nonlinear Hall conductivity (36000 {\mu}mV-1{\Omega}-1) near van
Hove singularities of moire minibands, which is over an order of magnitude
larger than all previously reported NHEs. Our findings establish an efficient,
magnetic-field-driven route to giant Hall rectification in high-mobility
materials, offering a broadly applicable paradigm for modulating the NHE beyond
electrostatic gating.

The Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) with electron-phonon (e-ph)
interactions computed from first principles is widely used to study electronic
transport and nonequilibrium dynamics in materials. Calculating the e-ph
collision integral is the most important step in the BTE, but it remains
computationally costly, even with current MPI+OpenMP parallelization. This
challenge makes it difficult to study materials with large unit cells and to
achieve high resolution in momentum space. Here, we show acceleration of BTE
calculations of electronic transport and ultrafast dynamics using graphical
processing units (GPUs). We implement a novel data structure and algorithm,
optimized for GPU hardware and developed using OpenACC, to process scattering
channels and efficiently compute the collision integral. This approach
significantly reduces the overhead for data referencing, movement, and
synchronization. Relative to the efficient CPU implementation in the
open-source package Perturbo (v2.2.0), used as a baseline, this approach
achieves a speed-up of 40 times for both transport and nonequilibrium dynamics
on GPU hardware, and achieves nearly linear scaling up to 100 GPUs. The novel
data structure can be generalized to other electron interactions and scattering
processes. We released this GPU implementation in the latest public version
(v3.0.0) of Perturbo. The new MPI+OpenMP+GPU parallelization enables sweeping
studies of e-ph physics and electron dynamics in conventional and quantum
materials, and prepares Perturbo for exascale supercomputing platforms.

Understanding the evolution of structure and functionality through amorphous
to crystalline phase transitions is critical for predicting and designing
devices for application in extreme conditions. Here, we consider both aspects
of recrystallization of irradiated GaAs. We find that structural evolution
occurs in two stages, a low temperature regime characterized by slow, epitaxial
front propagation and a high-temperature regime above dominated by rapid growth
and formation of dense nanotwin networks. We link aspects of this structural
evolution to local ordering, or paracrystallinity, within the amorphous phase.
Critically, the electronic recovery of the materials is not commensurate with
this structural evolution. The electronic properties of the recrystallized
material deviate further from the pristine material than do those of the
amorphous phase, highlighting the incongruence between structural and
electronic recovery and the contrasting impact of loss of long range order
versus localized defects on the functionality of semiconducting materials.

Low-valent Group 13 fragments can serve as neutral two-electron L-type
metalloligands to transition-metal (TM) centers, enabling heterometallic M-TM
platforms with bonding and reactivity patterns distinct from classical CO,
phosphine, and carbene ligation. This chapter develops a unifying,
descriptor-based view of aluminylene Al(I), gallylene Ga(I), and indylene In(I)
donors, and contrasts them with the limited L-type behavior of Tl(I). We map
synthetic gateways to isolable M(I) donors, analyze their
sigma-donation/pi-acceptance profiles, and extract periodic design rules in
which the sigma-donor strength decreases Al &gt; Ga &gt; In, whereas Tl(I) has not
yet been convincingly shown to engage in neutral L-type Tl-&gt;TM coordination.
Borderline cases that blur L-, X-, and Z-type classifications are also examined
to clarify descriptors and guide consistent usage across the series. This
contribution links ligand sterics/electronics, ambiphilicity at M(I), and the
chosen TM fragment to guide the rational design of M-TM platforms that harness
Group-13 M(I) donors for small-molecule activation and cooperative catalysis.

- **TL;DR**: 在AlGaN/GaN二维电子系统的等离子体晶体中发现了具有平方根色散关系的槽等离子体激发，这种未屏蔽模式遵循非常规波矢量子化规则，能在室温下持续存在。

We experimentally investigate the terahertz spectrum of plasma excitations in
a plasmonic crystal based on AlGaN/GaN two-dimensional electron system (2DES).
While screened plasmon modes with linear dispersion are readily observed in the
plasmonic crystals, the existence of unscreened modes localized in the slots
between the gates has remained unobserved until now. We discover this slot
plasma excitation exhibiting square-root dispersion. It turned out that these
slot plasmons follow an unconventional wave-vector quantization rule, $q_u=(N +
1/4) \times \pi/l_u$ for even integers $N$, and require the condition for
excitation $q_u h \ll 1$, where $h$ is the gate-to-2DES distance and $l_u$ is
the slot width. We develop an analytical model that accurately captures the
found dispersion and relaxation, revealing a non-trivial $-\pi/4$ phase shift
upon plasmon reflection at the gate edge. Experiments demonstrate that the slot
plasmons persist up to room temperature, thereby enabling a broad range of
opportunities for the advancement of plasmonic devices.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文提出了一个归一化描述符d̂，用于比较不同材料的二阶非线性光学性能，解决了χ(2)随带隙变化而难以直接比较的问题。

Second-order nonlinear optical materials enable frequency doubling of light
(second-harmonic generation, SHG), which is essential for optoelectronic
applications ranging from materials characterization to quantum technologies.
However, comparing SHG performance across materials remains challenging as the
second-order nonlinear susceptibility $\chi^{(2)}$ spans several orders of
magnitude and strongly depends on the band gap $E_g$. To address this, we
empirically validate a theoretical upper bound on $\chi^{(2)}$ using new
databases of \textit{ab initio}-computed nonlinear optical (NLO) properties. We
then formulate a normalized descriptor, $\hat{d}$, which expresses the NLO
response of a material relative to the band gap-dependent physical limit. We
show that $\hat{d}$ exhibits a similar distribution across a wide range of band
gap energies. This universality supports the use of $\hat{d}$ as a robust,
generalizable descriptor for data-driven and chemistry-informed machine
learning models of NLO response, enabling accelerated materials discovery and
optimization across broad application frequencies.

### Switching perpendicular magnets for Processing-in-memory with voltage gated Weyl Semimetals

Processing-in-memory (PIM) reduces data transfer latency by rolling memory
and logic elements into one compute location. As an emergent material candidate
for such an architecture, we propose a strained Weyl semimetal based
spin-orbit-torque random-access memory (SWSM-SOTRAM) device. The spin-orbit
torque (SOT) originates from two mechanisms: (1) the inverse spin Galvanic
effect (iSGE), which generates nonequilibrium in-plane spin accumulation at
interfaces, and (2) a bulk spin Hall effect (SHE), which produces a transverse
spin current carrying out-of-plane spin angular momentum. The latter is tunable
via an exchange Zeeman field. Both effects are evaluated using the
tight-binding model coupled with a nonequilibrium Green's function (TB-NEGF)
formalism for quantum transport. Information write is achieved through SOT
switching of an out-of-plane free magnet. A piezo attached to a
magnetostrictive selector modulates the strain in the latter, leading to the
rotation of the magnetization and hence the exchange Zeeman field exerted on
the Weyl semimetal. This strain-controlled exchange field enables the symmetry
tuning of the Weyl semimetal and modulation of its spin Hall effect. The
TB-NEGF calculations of SHE and iSGE, combined with Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert
(LLG) simulations of magnetization dynamics, establish the SOT switching
mechanism and demonstrate a pathway toward the SWSM-SOTRAM PIM device.

- **TL;DR**: EGMOF是一个混合扩散-变换器框架，通过模块化工作流实现MOF材料的逆向设计，将过程分解为从属性到描述符再到结构的两个步骤，在小数据集条件下仍保持高准确率。

Designing materials with targeted properties remains challenging due to the
vastness of chemical space and the scarcity of property-labeled data. While
recent advances in generative models offer a promising way for inverse design,
most approaches require large datasets and must be retrained for every new
target property. Here, we introduce the EGMOF (Efficient Generation of MOFs), a
hybrid diffusion-transformer framework that overcomes these limitations through
a modular, descriptor-mediated workflow. EGMOF decomposes inverse design into
two steps: (1) a one-dimensional diffusion model (Prop2Desc) that maps desired
properties to chemically meaningful descriptors followed by (2) a transformer
model (Desc2MOF) that generates structures from these descriptors. This modular
hybrid design enables minimal retraining and maintains high accuracy even under
small-data conditions. On a hydrogen uptake dataset, EGMOF achieved over 95%
validity and 84% hit rate, representing significant improvements of up to 57%
in validity and 14% in hit rate compared to existing methods, while remaining
effective with only 1,000 training samples. Moreover, our model successfully
performed conditional generation across 29 diverse property datasets, including
CoREMOF, QMOF, and text-mined experimental datasets, whereas previous models
have not. This work presents a data-efficient, generalizable approach to the
inverse design of diverse MOFs and highlights the potential of modular inverse
design workflows for broader materials discovery.

### Coherent Phonon Negative Refraction via Interfacial Momentum Compensation

- **TL;DR**: 通过引入离散平移对称性介导的动量补偿机制，实现了相干声子的负折射，无需强色散各向异性或负曲率能带。

Negative refraction of coherent phonons is crucial for thermal management and
quantum information processing, but it remains unrealized because achieving the
suitable dispersion for negative refraction simultaneously with long-range
coherence is challenging. In this letter, we overcome this limitation by
introducing a momentum compensation mechanism mediated by discrete
translational symmetry. Interfacial reciprocal lattice vectors provide momentum
compensation during phonon tunneling and induce asymmetric mode matching,
resulting in negative refraction without requiring strong dispersion anisotropy
or a negative-curvature band. Using non-equilibrium Green's function formalism,
we demonstrate coherent negative refraction of isotropic acoustic phonons in
graphene/hexagonal boron nitride heterostructures. This general mechanism
enables active control of phonon flow via interfacial design, paving the way
for applications in atomic-scale phonon lenses and directional thermal
transport.

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of important crystalline and
highly porous materials whose hierarchical geometry and chemistry hinder
interpretable predictions in materials properties. Commutative algebra is a
branch of abstract algebra that has been rarely applied in data and material
sciences. We introduce the first ever commutative algebra modeling and
prediction in materials science. Specifically, category-specific commutative
algebra (CSCA) is proposed as a new framework for MOF representation and
learning. It integrates element-based categorization with multiscale algebraic
invariants to encode both local coordination motifs and global network
organization of MOFs. These algebraically consistent, chemically aware
representations enable compact, interpretable, and data efficient modeling of
MOF properties such as Henry's constants and uptake capacities for common
gases. Compared to traditional geometric and graph-based approaches, CSCA
achieves comparable or superior predictive accuracy while substantially
improving interpretability and stability across data sets. By aligning
commutative algebra with the chemical hierarchy, the CSCA establishes a
rigorous and generalizable paradigm for understanding structure and property
relationships in porous materials and provides a nonlinear algebra-based
framework for data-driven material discovery.

There has been experimentally implemented a technique of neutralization of an
acoustoelectric domain under the conditions of the lateral transport of charge
carriers in strong electric fields in the multilayer InGaAs/GaAs
heterostructures with quantum wells. The technique is implemented by means of
deposition of a shunting semi opaque silver film on the heterostructure surface
between the ohmic contacts. In absence of shunting the domain appearance leads
to current decrease, current oscillations and also to a strong decrease of the
band-to-band emission during a voltage pulse applied to the sample. The
shunting eliminated the current decrease and enabled it to strongly enlarge the
band-to-band emission intensity.

### Mysterious Role of Cap Configuration in Single-Walled Carbon Nanotube Catalytic Growth

Understanding the role of cap structure during the nucleation and growth of
single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) is essential for achieving
chirality-controlled synthesis. In this work, we propose a novel and intuitive
algorithm to determine the chirality of nascent carbon caps by tracking the
relative shifts of six pentagons within a topological coordinate system. Based
on this algorithm, we propose three routes of pentagon shifts for the chirality
mutations from armchair (AC) to near-AC caps, namely the transverse shift (n,n)
to (n+1,n-1), inward shift (n,n) to (n-1), and outward shift (n,n) to (n+1,n),
can occur according to the energy profiles calculated based on the density
function theory (DFT), providing a new perspective to explain the experimental
abundance of near-AC SWCNTs. After that, we construct 24 representative short
caps and long SWCNTs with different chiralities and symmetries, and perform DFT
calculations to evaluate their thermodynamic stability and deformation
behaviors on flat Ni(111) surfaces and curved Ni55 particle, respectively. The
results reveal that cap topology and catalyst curvature together induce dual
deformations that significantly influence the formation and interface energies.
Notably, AC and near-AC caps exhibit superior flexibility and robust energetic
advantages, especially the (6,6) cap with C6v symmetry. A linear correlation
between cap-induced deformation and formation energy is established through a
defined shape factor, highlighting the interaction between cap structure and
catalyst interface as a key driver of chirality selection. This study
theoretically reveals the cap evolution mechanism and lays the foundation for
the rational design of SWCNT growth strategies.

- **TL;DR**: CaMnBi₂在46K发生结构相变，从四方晶系转变为正交晶系，伴随Bi-Bi键的zigzag键序波调制，而非之前认为的自旋倾斜导致的Weyl半金属态。

Dirac semimetals of the form $A$Mn$X_2$ ($A =$ alkaline-earth or divalent
rare earth; $X =$ Bi, Sb) host conducting square-net Dirac-electron layers of
$X$ atoms interleaved with antiferromagnetic Mn$X$ layers. In these materials,
canted antiferromagnetism can break time-reversal symmetry (TRS) and produce a
Weyl semimetallic state. CaMnBi$_2$ was proposed to realize this behavior below
$T^{*}\sim 50$ K, where anomalies in resistivity and optical conductivity were
reported. We investigate single-crystal CaMnBi$_{2}$ using polarized and
unpolarized neutron diffraction, x-ray diffraction, and density functional
theory (DFT) calculations to elucidate the underlying crystal and magnetic
structures. The results show that the observed anomalies do not originate from
spin canting or weak ferromagnetism; no measurable uniform Mn spin canting is
detected. Instead, CaMnBi$_2$ undergoes a coupled structural and magnetic
symmetry-lowering transition at $T^{*} = 46(2)$ K, from a tetragonal lattice
with C-type antiferromagnetism to an orthorhombic phase with unit-cell doubling
along the $c$ axis and minimal impact on magnetism. Analysis of superlattice
peak intensities and lattice distortion reveals a continuous second-order
transition governed by a single order parameter. The refined atomic
displacements correspond to a zigzag bond-order-wave (BOW) modulation of Bi-Bi
bonds, consistent with an electronically driven Peierls-type instability in the
Dirac-electron Bi layer, long anticipated by Hoffmann and co-workers [W.~Tremel

We study the electrical tunability of ultrastrong light-matter interactions
between a single terahertz circuit-based complementary split ring resonator
(cSRR) and a two-dimensional electron gas. For this purpose, transmission
spectroscopy measurements are performed under the influence of a strong
magnetic field at different set points for the electric gate bias. The
resulting Landau polariton dispersion depends on the applied electric bias, as
the gating technique confines the electrons in-plane down to extremely
sub-wavelength dimensions as small as d = 410 nm. This confinement allows for
the excitation of standing plasma waves at zero magnetic field and an effective
tunability of the electron number coupled to the THz resonator. This allows the
normalized coupling strength to be tuned in-situ from $\eta$ = 0.46 down to
$\eta$ = 0.18. This is the first demonstration of terahertz far-field
spectroscopy of an electrically tunable interaction between a single terahertz
resonator and electrons in a GaAs quantum well heterostructure.

Low-temperature refrigeration technology constitutes a crucial component in
space exploration. The small-scale, low-vibration Stirling-type pulse tube
refrigerators hold significant application potential for space cooling.
However, the efficient operation of current Stirling-type pulse tube
cryocoolers in space cooling applications remains challenging due to the rapid
decay of the heat capacity of regenerative materials below 10 K. This study
adopts a novel material strategy: using a novel high-spin S = 7/2 magnetic
regenerative material, Gd2O2Se, we construct a multistage tunable regenerative
material structure to achieve an efficient cooling approach to the liquid
helium temperature range. Under substantial geometric frustration from a
double-layered triangular lattice, it exhibits two-step specific heat
transition peaks at 6.22 K and 2.11 K, respectively. Its ultrahigh specific
heat and broad two-step transition temperature range effectively bridge the gap
between commercially used high-heat-capacity materials. Experimental
verification shows that when Gd2O2Se is combined with Er3Ni and HoCu2 in the
Stirling-type pulse tube cryocooler, the cooling efficiency of the pulse tube
increases by 66.5 % at 7 K, and the minimum achievable temperature reaches 5.85
K. These results indicate that Gd2O2Se is an ideal magnetic regenerative
material for space cooling

Axial or circularly polarized phonons are collective lattice vibrations with
angular momentum. Over the past decade they have emerged as a promising
mechanism for the manipulation of magnetism, in parallel to well established
optical protocols. In particular, coherent axial phonons were shown to induce
magnetization in materials without spin-ordering, making them a viable tool for
ultrafast magnetic switching. The experimental evidence suggests that the size
of this magnetization is significant, opening a new research area on the
phono-magnetic effect. Remarkably, the coupling of axial phonons to magnetism
has been observed a broad class of materials, pointing to a universal nature of
the underlying mechanisms. In this review article, we present the recent
progress in the field. We give an introduction to the phenomenological
perspective and an overview of the experimental evidence for the magnetization
emerging from axial phonons, which includes discussing the observations of
phonon Zeeman effect, the magneto-optical Kerr effect and the proximity-induced
magnetization switching. We present recently proposed microscopic theories for
the phono-magnetic effects, based on perturbation theory, adiabatic motion and
Floquet theory as well as the emergence of the phonon magnetic moment due to
artificial gauge fields or inertial effects. This summary allows us to see
correspondences between the seemingly different theoretical approaches,
facilitating a more complete perspective of the effect.

Metal hydrides remain an intriguing alternative to conventional gaseous and
liquid hydrogen storage methods, offering high volumetric storage density and
enhanced hydrogen storage safety at ambient conditions. In this regard, the
intermetallic compound FeTi is one of the most promising storage materials.
However, its widespread industrial application remains challenging due to the
need for activation, slow initial kinetics, large hysteresis, and high material
costs. In this study, we aim to overcome these limitations by devising an
alternative synthesis pathway to prepare nanoporous and ultra-fine porous FeTi
with controlled grain and ligament sizes, allowing us to study the obtained
well-defined microstructures in detail. In particular, we observe the
confinement of the FeTi phase by surface oxides, which can be correlated with
the hydrogen sorption properties of the respective material. These experimental
results are further supported by an analytical model allowing the calculation
of the absorption pressure as a function of microstructure-dependent elastic
stresses. Additionally, we show that such stresses also influence the
absorption-desorption hysteresis. This study lays the groundwork for the
controlled and systematic study of the processing-structure-properties
relations in metal hydrides and FeTi in particular, thereby paving the way to
cost-effective and efficient hydrogen storage solutions based on metal
hydrides.

Interatomic potentials are essential for molecular dynamics simulations of
magnetic materials, yet incorporating magnetic features into potentials for
complex antiferromagnets remains challenging. Nickel oxide (NiO), a
prototypical cubic antiferromagnet, exemplifies this difficulty. Here we
develop a methodology to integrate magnetic properties into interatomic
potentials for cubic antiferromagnets by adding a magnetic Hamiltonian which
includes both the Heisenberg exchange and N\'eel model. We apply this approach
to NiO by constructing two potentials: one based on the Born model of ionic
solids and another using a reference-free modified embedded atom method. Both
potentials include magnetoelastic interactions and are validated against
Density Functional Theory calculations, showing excellent agreement in
mechanical and magnetic properties at zero temperature. These models enable
large-scale simulations of magnetoelastic phenomena in antiferromagnets and
open avenues for molecular dynamics studies involving coupled electric and
magnetic fields in metal oxides.

The sharp optical resonances of NV- centers in diamond at cryogenic
temperatures offer powerful new capabilities for material characterization, but
extracting the most detailed information typically requires careful calibration
of individual sensors, limiting scalability. In this work, we use resonant
photoluminescence excitation imaging to optically resolve and monitor hundreds
of individual NVs across large fields of view, enabling statistical analysis of
their spatial distribution with sub-diffraction resolution. This multiplexed,
non-destructive approach allows quantum sensors to characterize the material
platform they inhabit. Focusing on CVD-grown diamond, we uncover significant
deviations from random distributions, including an unexpectedly high occurrence
of closely spaced clusters comprising two or more NVs. These findings suggest
non-Poissonian formation dynamics and point to spatially correlated defect
generation mechanisms. Beyond offering insight into diamond growth and NV
center formation, our approach enables the scalable identification of naturally
occurring NV clusters - configurations that are promising for
entanglement-assisted quantum information protocols and correlated sensing -
and establishes a path toward structural and electronic defect analysis in
various material hosts at the single-emitter level.

There is a growing interest in identifying the origin of single-photon
emission in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), with proposed candidates including
boron and nitrogen vacancies as well as carbon substitutional dopants. Because
photon emission intensity often increases with sample thickness, hBN flakes
used in these studies commonly exceed 30 atomic layers. To identify potential
emitters at the atomic scale, annular dark-field scanning transmission electron
microscopy (ADF-STEM) is frequently employed. However, due to the intrinsic AA'
stacking of hBN with vertically alternating boron and nitrogen atoms, this
approach is complicated even in few-layer systems. Here, we demonstrate using
STEM image simulations and experiments that, even under idealized conditions,
the intensity differences between boron- and nitrogen-dominated columns and
carbon substitutions become indistinguishable at thicknesses beyond 17 atomic
layers (ca. 6 nm). While vacancy-type defects can remain detectable at somewhat
larger thicknesses, also their detection becomes unreliable at thicknesses
typically used in photonic studies. We further show that common residual
aberrations, particularly threefold astigmatism, can lead to artificial
contrast differences between columns, which may result in misidentification of
atomic defects. We systematically study the effects of non-radially symmetric
aberrations on multilayer hBN and demonstrate that even small residual

Plasma-activated bonding of SiCN films offers high bonding strength at the
hybrid-bonding interface, thereby enhancing mechanical reliability. Although
experimental studies have shown that the interfacial bonding properties of SiCN
films vary with SiCN composition and plasma treatment parameters, a clear
correlation between these parameters and the resulting bonding properties has
not yet been established. This study presents an atomistic investigation of
SiCN-SiCN plasma-activated bonding with controlled SiCN composition and plasma
fluence, which performs O2 plasma surface activation, surface hydroxylation,
direct bonding, post-bonding annealing, and debonding using reactive molecular
dynamics. The structural characterization of the plasma-activated SiCN surface,
including density of various covalent bonds and surface roughness, exhibits
composition- and plasma fluence-dependent chemical and morphological
modification. Bonding energy evaluated from atomic traction-separation
responses in cohesive zone volume elements (CZVE) during debonding simulations
shows a positive correlation with the interfacial Si-O-Si density. Since the
interfacial Si-O-Si density reflects the combined effects of these chemical and
morphological modifications, the dependence of bonding energy on composition
and plasma fluence is successfully elucidated by the structural
characterization. These results establish an atomic-level
material-process-property relationship and offer practical guidance for
optimizing SiCN composition and plasma treatment parameters for SiCN-SiCN
plasma-activated bonding.

- **TL;DR**: 磁性斯格明子位错表现出核心分裂结构，斯格明子伸长可达原长度的180%，形成从单个斯格明子到两个半斯格明子的拓扑转变。尽管结构独特，其长程应变场仍遵循传统Volterra弹性理论，与极性斯格明子晶格形成对比。

Magnetic and polar skyrmions exhibit topologically protected quasiparticle
behavior, including emergent fields, deformation, and the formation of a
densely packed skyrmion lattice, beyond conventional domain configurations
described by Kittel's law. Analogous to atomic crystals, lattice defects,
especially dislocations and their associated strain fields, are crucial for
understanding the lattice behavior of skyrmions; however, their features and
roles remain insufficiently understood. Here, we show that magnetic skyrmion
dislocations develop a core-split structure due to a significant skyrmion
elongation up to 180% of their original length, reaching a topological
transition from a single skyrmion to two half-skyrmions. Despite such a
distinct structure, the long-range strain fields around the dislocation
perfectly obey conventional Volterra's elasticity theory, in contrast to polar
skyrmion lattices, where skyrmion deformations cause a breakdown of the
elasticity theory. Furthermore, an energetic analysis shows that
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction drives the large skyrmion deformation of the
dislocation core. Our findings not only clarify the coexistence of topological
core-reconstruction and a robust long-range elastic field of dislocations in
magnetic skyrmion lattices, but also reveal that magnetic and electric domains,
long regarded as dual and analogous, exhibit fundamental differences when
extended into the regime of collective topological quasiparticles.

Altermagnets (AMs), recently identified as a third class of collinear
magnetic materials, have attracted significant attention in condensed matter
physics. Despite this growing interest, the realization of real Chern
insulators in intrinsic altermagnetic systems has rarely been reported. In this
work, based on first-principles calculations and theoretical analysis, we
identify monolayer Fe$_2$S$_2$O and Fe$_2$Se$_2$O as a novel class of
two-dimensional altermagnetic real Chern insulators. We demonstrate that these
materials possess altermagnetic ground states and host a nontrivial mirror real
Chern number, leading to the emergence of symmetry-protected zero-dimensional
corner states. Notably, these corner modes are spin-polarized, giving rise to a
unique spin-corner coupling effect. We further show that the real Chern
insulating phases and their associated corner states remain robust against
spin-orbit coupling, as well as under both uniaxial and biaxial strain.
Additionally, these materials exhibit pronounced linear dichroism and strong
optical absorption. Our findings uncover the novel topological character of
Fe$_2$S$_2$O and Fe$_2$Se$_2$O, establishing them as promising platforms for
exploring real Chern insulators in altermagnetic systems.

- **TL;DR**: 本研究通过计算模拟探讨了羟基功能化碳纳米管对草甘膦的吸附机制，发现羟基功能化显著增强吸附能力，特别是在20-25%功能化浓度下效果最佳，为环境修复提供了一种有前景的方法。

This computational study investigates glyphosate adsorption mechanisms on
hydroxyl-functionalized carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as an alternative approach for
environmental remediation. Single-walled CNTs with (10,0) zigzag chirality were
functionalized with hydroxyl groups at concentrations of 5-25% and evaluated
for interactions with glyphosate in five different ionization states (G1-G5)
corresponding to pH-dependent protonation. Using semi-empirical tight-binding
methods implemented in xTB software, molecular geometry optimization,
electronic property calculations, topological analyses via Quantum Theory of
Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM), and molecular dynamics simulations at 300K were
performed. Results demonstrate that functionalization significantly enhances
adsorption capacity, with binding energies becoming increasingly negative at
higher OH concentrations and with more deprotonated glyphosate forms (G4 and
G5). Electronic coupling analyses reveal optimized charge reactivity and
transport in systems with 20-25% OH functionalization. Topological
characterization identified 477 bond critical points, confirming donor-acceptor
interactions with strong covalent contributions, particularly in highly
functionalized systems. Radial distribution function profiles from molecular
dynamics simulations demonstrate that functionalization promotes spatial
organization on nanotube surfaces, increasing contact regions and reducing
molecular mobility. Systems with moderate interactions (CNT+OHx+G1 and
CNT+OHx+G3) present environmentally and economically viable solutions, enabling
adsorbent regeneration and reuse. The findings indicate that OH-functionalized
carbon nanotubes show significant promise for glyphosate detection and capture
applications in environmental monitoring and remediation, regardless of the
pesticide's ionization state.

Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy is employed to study the electronic
structure of bulk TiSe2 before and after doping with potassium impurities. A
splitting in the conduction band into two branches is observed after
room-temperature deposition. The splitting energy increases to approximately
130 meV when the sample is cooled to 40 K. One branch exhibits a non-dispersive
two-dimensional feature, while other one shows the characteristics of three
dimensional bulk band dispersion. Core level spectroscopy suggests that the K
impurities predominantly occupy the intercalated sites within the van derWaals
gap. The results indicate the formation of a quasi-freestandingTiSe2 layer.
Additionally, doping completely suppresses the periodic lattice distortion in
the surface region. These findings are further supported by density functional
theory calculations, which compare the band structure of monolayer and bulk
TiSe2 with experimental data. Thus, the dimensional and intrinsic electronic
properties of 1T-TiSe2 can be controlled through the intercalation procedure
used in this work.
