- **TL;DR**: 该论文研究了未掺杂和掺杂的(3,0)碳纳米管在常压下的电子-声子耦合和超导特性，发现未掺杂(3,0)CNT是双能隙超导体，Tc约33K，创下元素超导体在常压下的最高记录。

A very recent report claims that ambient-pressure high-temperature ($T_c$)
superconductivity was found in boron-doped three-dimensional networks of carbon
nanotubes (CNTs). Here, we systematically study the electron-phonon coupling
(EPC) of one-dimensional (1D) (3,0) CNT under ambient pressure. Our results
show that the EPC constant $\lambda$ of the undoped 1D (3,0) CNT is 0.70, and
reduces to 0.44 after 1.3 holes/cell doping. Further calculations show that the
undoped (3,0) CNT is a two-gap superconductor with a superconducting $T_c$
$\sim$ 33 K under ambient pressure. Additionally, we identify three
characteristic phonon modes with strong EPC, establishing that the pristine
(3,0) CNT is a high-$T_c$ superconducting unit, and further suggest that
searching for those superconducting units with strong EPC phonon mode would be
an effective way to discover high-$T_c$ phonon-mediated superconductors. Our
study not only provide a crucial and timely theoretical reference for the
recent report regarding superconducting CNTs, but also uncover that the
pristine (3,0) CNT hosts the highest record of superconducting $T_c$ among the
elemental superconductors under ambient pressure.

- **TL;DR**: 评估大型语言模型在高温铜酸盐专业领域文献理解能力的研究，通过专家构建的数据库和问题集测试了6个LLM系统，发现基于检索增强生成(RAG)的系统在提供全面且有证据支持的答案方面表现优于闭源模型。

Large Language Models (LLMs) show great promise as a powerful tool for
scientific literature exploration. However, their effectiveness in providing
scientifically accurate and comprehensive answers to complex questions within
specialized domains remains an active area of research. Using the field of
high-temperature cuprates as an exemplar, we evaluate the ability of LLM
systems to understand the literature at the level of an expert. We construct an
expert-curated database of 1,726 scientific papers that covers the history of
the field, and a set of 67 expert-formulated questions that probe deep
understanding of the literature. We then evaluate six different LLM-based
systems for answering these questions, including both commercially available
closed models and a custom retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system capable
of retrieving images alongside text. Experts then evaluate the answers of these
systems against a rubric that assesses balanced perspectives, factual
comprehensiveness, succinctness, and evidentiary support. Among the six systems
two using RAG on curated literature outperformed existing closed models across
key metrics, particularly in providing comprehensive and well-supported
answers. We discuss promising aspects of LLM performances as well as critical
short-comings of all the models. The set of expert-formulated questions and the
rubric will be valuable for assessing expert level performance of LLM based
reasoning systems.

### Dynamics of the Schmid-Higgs Mode in $d$-wave superconductors

- **TL;DR**: 研究d波超导体中纵向集体模式的动力学行为，发现序参量在扰动后呈现振荡衰减，频率为反节点方向配对振幅的两倍，振幅按1/t²衰减

We study the dynamics of the longitudinal collective mode in an
unconventional superconductor. For concreteness, we assume that the
superconductor is described by a $d$-wave order parameter with $d_{x^2-y^2}$
symmetry. After the superconductor has been suddenly subjected to a
perturbation at time $t=0$, the order parameter exhibits a peculiar oscillatory
behavior, with the amplitude of the oscillations slowly decaying with time in a
power-law fashion. Assuming that the initial perturbation is weak, we use a
formalism based on quasi-classical approach to superconductivity to determine
both the frequency of the oscillations as well as how fast these oscillations
decay with time by evaluating the time dependence of the pairing
susceptibility. We find that the frequency of the oscillations is given by
twice the value of the pairing amplitude in the anti-nodal direction and its
amplitude decays as $1/t^2$. The results are also verified by a direct
calculation of the order parameter dynamics by numerically solving the
equations of motion for the Anderson pseudospins.

### Vortex-Controlled Quasiparticle Multiplication and Self-Growth Dynamics in Superconducting Resonators

Even in the quantum limit, non-equilibrium quasiparticle (QP) populations
induce QP poisoning that irreversibly relaxes the quantum state and
significantly degrades the coherence of transmon qubits. A particularly
detrimental yet previously unexplored mechanism arises from QP multiplication
facilitated by vortex trapping in superconducting quantum circuits, where a
high-energy QP relaxes by breaking additional Cooper pairs and amplifying the
QP population due to the locally reduced excitation gap and enhanced quantum
confinement within the vortex core. Here we directly resolve this elusive QP
multiplication process by revealing vortex-controlled QP self-generation in a
highly nonequilibrium regime preceding the phonon bottleneck of QP relaxation.
At sufficiently low fluence, femtosecond-resolved magneto-reflection
spectroscopy directly reveals a continuously increasing QP population that is
strongly dependent on magnetic-field-tuned vortex density and absent at higher
excitation fluences. Quantitative analysis of the emergent QP pre-bottleneck
dynamics further reveals that, although the phonon population saturates within
$\simeq$10~ps, both free and trapped QPs continue to grow in a self-sustained
manner--hallmarks of the long-anticipated QP-vortex interactions in
nonequilibrium superconductivity. We estimate a substantial increase of
$\sim$34\% in QP density at vortex densities of $\sim$ 100 magnetic flux quanta
per $\mathrm{\mu m^{2}}$. Our findings establish a powerful spectroscopic tool
for uncovering QP multiplication and reveal vortex-assisted QP relaxation as a
critical materials bottleneck whose mitigation will be essential for resolving
QP poisoning and enhancing coherence in superconducting qubits.

### Fermionic spinon theory of the hourglass spin excitation spectrum of the cuprates

We present a theory for the spin fluctuation spectrum of the hole-doped
cuprates in a ground state with period 4 unidirectional charge density wave
(`stripe') order. Motivated by recent experimental evidence for a
fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*) description of the intermediate temperature
pseudogap metal, we employ a theory of fermionic spinons which are confined
with the onset of stripe order at low temperatures. The theory produces the
`hourglass' spectrum near stripe-ordering wavevector observed by neutron
scattering. Additional scattering from spinon continua and bound states appears
at higher energies and elsewhere in the Brillouin zone, and could be observed
by neutron or X-ray scattering.

### N-Mode Quantized Anharmonic Vibronic Hamiltonians for Matrix Product State Dynamics

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种基于n模量化的高维模型表示方法，用于精确计算光化学过程中的振动电子量子动力学，并通过马来酰亚胺的激发态量子动力学验证了方法的准确性。

Theoretical predictions of photochemical processes are essential for
interpreting and understanding spectral features. Reliable quantum dynamics
calculations of vibronic systems require precise modeling of anharmonic effects
in the potential energy surfaces and off-diagonal nonadiabatic coupling terms.
In this work, we present the n-mode quantization of all vibronic Hamiltonian
terms comprised of general high-dimensional model representations. This results
in a second-quantized framework for accurate vibronic calculations employing
the density matrix renormalization group algorithm. We demonstrate the accuracy
and reliability of this approach by calculating the excited state quantum
dynamics of maleimide. We analyze convergence and the choice of parameters of
the underlying time-dependent density matrix renormalization group algorithm
for the n-mode vibronic Hamiltonian, demonstrating that it enables accurate
calculations of complex photochemical dynamics.

### Dynamics of Josephson junctions beyond the tunneling limit

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一个广义的RCSJ模型，能够描述具有非线性电流-电压特性的耗散电流和任意电流-相位关系的超电流，适用于约瑟夫森二极管效应等超出传统隧穿极限的情况。

The dynamics of the superconducting phase difference across a Josephson
junction can be described within the resistively and capacitively shunted
Josephson junction (RCSJ) model. Microscopic derivations of this model
traditionally rely on the tunneling limit. Here, we present a derivation of a
generalized version of the RCSJ model, which accounts for dissipative currents
with nonlinear current-voltage characteristics as well as supercurrents with
arbitrary current-phase relations. This requires a generalized
fluctuation-dissipation theorem to describe the Langevin current, which we
deduce along the lines of fluctuation theorems for mesoscopic conductors. Our
work is motivated in particular by recent theories of the Josephson diode
effect, which is not captured within the RCSJ model in the tunneling limit.

### Krylov Complexity Meets Confinement

- **TL;DR**: 使用Ising模型证明Krylov态复杂度可作为禁闭现象的灵敏定量探针，揭示禁闭对量子信息传播的显著抑制作用

In high-energy physics, confinement denotes the tendency of fundamental
particles to remain bound together, preventing their observation as free,
isolated entities. Interestingly, analogous confinement behavior emerges in
certain condensed matter systems, for instance, in the Ising model with both
transverse and longitudinal fields, where domain walls become confined into
meson-like bound states as a result of a longitudinal field-induced linear
potential. In this work, we employ the Ising model to demonstrate that Krylov
state complexity--a measure quantifying the spread of quantum information under
the repeated action of the Hamiltonian on a quantum state--serves as a
sensitive and quantitative probe of confinement. We show that confinement
manifests as a pronounced suppression of Krylov complexity growth following
quenches within the ferromagnetic phase in the presence of a longitudinal
field, reflecting slow correlation dynamics. In contrast, while quenches within
the paramagnetic phase exhibit enhanced complexity with increasing longitudinal
field, reflecting the absence of confinement, those crossing the critical point
to the ferromagnetic phase reveal a distinct regime characterized by
orders-of-magnitude larger complexity and display trends of weak confinement.
Notably, in the confining regime, the complexity oscillates at frequencies
corresponding to the meson masses, with its power-spectrum peaks closely
matching the semiclassical predictions.

### Robust Subgroup Method Using DE Algorithm for Resonance Self-Shielding Calculation

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种增强的鲁棒子群方法，将鲁棒估计与差分进化算法结合，用于共振自屏蔽处理，解决了传统子群拟合中的系统吸收偏差问题。

This paper presents an enhanced version of the subgroup method for resonance
self-shielding treatment, termed the robust subgroup method, which integrates
Robust Estimation (RE) with a Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm. The RE
approach is employed to handle model misspecification and data contamination,
while the DE algorithm serves as an optimization tool within the RE framework
to obtain constrained solutions. Numerical validation against experimental
benchmarks shows that the proposed method removes a systematic absorption bias
in conventional subgroup fits that would otherwise depress reactivity. This
bias appears only in benchmarks sensitive to U-238. Mechanistically, it
reflects a threshold-like conditioning failure: strong self-shielding leverage
dominates the loss and is magnified by dilution-induced multicollinearity. This
adverse conditioning appears to be seeded by a narrow, sparse resonance
structure at low energies in fertile even-even nuclides, thereby causing rapid
self-shielding response saturation and a weak Doppler broadening. By bounding
influence and enforcing feasibility within an RE-DE framework, the inferred
subgroup parameters track the underlying physics more faithfully, improving the
predictive fidelity of subsequent transport simulations.

### A data-driven quest for room-temperature bulk plastically deformable ceramics

- **TL;DR**: 使用数据驱动方法识别控制陶瓷室温块体塑性的关键参数，建立了连接材料本征特性与塑性行为的多尺度描述符空间

The growing number of ceramics exhibiting bulk plasticity at room temperature
has renewed interest in revisiting plastic deformation and dislocation-mediated
mechanical and functional properties in these materials. In this work, a
data-driven approach is employed to identify the key parameters governing
room-temperature bulk plasticity in ceramics. The model integrates an existing
dataset of 55 ceramic materials, 38 plastically deformable and 17 brittle, and
achieves accurate classification of bulk plasticity. The analysis reveals
several key parameters essential for predicting bulk plasticity: i) Poisson's
ratio and Pugh's ratio as macroscopic indicators reflecting the balance between
shear and volumetric deformation resistance, and ii) Burgers vector, crystal
structure and melting temperature as crystallographic descriptors associated
with lattice geometry, slip resistance and thermal stability, and iii) Bader
charge as a microscopic measure of bonding character. Together, these
parameters define a multiscale descriptor space linking intrinsic materials
properties to bulk room-temperature plasticity in ceramics, bridging the gap
between empirical ductility criteria and atomistic mechanisms of
dislocation-mediated plasticity. While preliminary, this study provides the
first systematic, data-driven mapping of the governing factors of ceramic
plasticity. The resulting framework establishes a foundation for unifying
experimental and computational studies through shared datasets and descriptors,
fostering collective progress toward understanding and designing intrinsically
ductile ceramics.

### Superconducting Properties on Two-dimensional Quasicrystal (Ta$_{0.95}$Cu$_{0.05}$)$_{1.6}$Te Studied with $^{125}$Te-NMR

- **TL;DR**: 通过125Te核磁共振研究准晶(Ta0.95Cu0.05)1.6Te的超导性质，发现其具有s波超导特征但相干峰异常小，可能实现非常规超导态。

Physical properties in the normal and superconducting (SC) state are
investigated with $^{125}$Te-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements in a
quasicrystal $\mathrm{(Ta_{0.95}Cu_{0.05})_{1.6}Te}$, which was a recently
discovered superconductor with the SC transition temperature $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ =
0.94 K. The nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate $1/T_1$ shows a coherence peak
just below $T_{\mathrm{c}}$, followed by an exponential decrease down to 0.1 K.
The overall temperature dependence of $1/T_1$ is in good agreement with an
$s$-wave SC model with a SC gap slightly smaller than the BCS value. However,
the coherence peak is unusually small, which may be attributable to a reduced
Bogoliubov peak theoretically predicted for quasicrystals. Furthermore,
$^{125}$Te-NMR spectra show almost no broadening nor shift in the SC state,
suggesting that an unusual SC state such as parity mixing might be realized in
the Ta$_{1.6}$Te superconductor.

Inspired by nature, this study employs the Materials Genome Initiative to
identify key components of HTSC superconductors. Integrating AI with
high-throughput screening, we uncover crucial superconducting "genes". Through
HTS techniques and advanced machine learning models, we demonstrate that
Functional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) ensure accurate extrapolation
of potential compounds. Leveraging extensive datasets from the ICSD, the
Materials Project and COD, our implemented HTS pipeline classifies
superconductors, with CNN and long short-term memory (LSTM) models predicting
Tc and their foundational elements. We address the scarcity of
non-superconducting material data by compiling a dataset of 53,196
non-superconducting materials (DataG Non-Sc) and introduce a novel neural
network architecture using Functional API for improved prediction, offering a
powerful tool for future superconductor discovery. Our findings underscore the
transformative potential of combining HTS with AI-driven models in advancing
HTSC materials, highlighting Pu and H elements (with Tc nearly 100 K) as
significant predictors of high-temperature superconductivity, suggesting their
role as a crucial gene in these materials.

### Electron transfer in confined electromagnetic fields: a unified Fermi's golden rule rate theory and extension to lossy cavities

- **Categories**: physics.chem-ph
- **TL;DR**: 本文提出了一个基于费米黄金法则的统一电子转移速率理论，适用于受限电磁场中的非绝热电子转移过程，涵盖了所有温度区间和腔模时间尺度。

With the rapid development of nanophotonics and cavity quantum
electrodynamics, there has been growing interest in how confined
electromagnetic fields modify fundamental molecular processes such as electron
transfer. In this paper, we revisit the problem of nonadiabatic electron
transfer (ET) in confined electromagnetic fields studied in [J. Chem. Phys.
150, 174122 (2019)] and present a unified rate theory based on Fermi's golden
rule (FGR). By employing a polaron-transformed Hamiltonian, we derive analytic
expressions for the ET rate correlation functions that are valid across all
temperature regimes and all cavity mode time scales. In the high-temperature
limit, our formalism recovers the Marcus and Marcus-Jortner results, while in
the low-temperature limit it reveals the emergence of the energy gap law. We
further extend the theory to include cavity loss by using an effective Brownian
oscillator spectral density, which enables closed-form expressions for the ET
rate in lossy cavities. As applications, we demonstrate two key cavity-induced
phenomena: (i) resonance effects, where the ET rate is strongly enhanced at
certain cavity mode frequencies, and (ii) electron-transfer-induced photon
emission, arising from the population of cavity photon Fock states during the
ET process. These results establish a general framework for understanding how
confined electromagnetic fields reshape charge transfer dynamics, and suggest
novel opportunities for controlling and probing ET reactions in nanophotonic
environments.

### Unconventional quantization of 2D plasmons in cavities formed by gate slots

We demonstrate that the slot between parallel metal gates placed above
two-dimensional electron system (2DES) forms a plasmonic cavity with
unconventional mode quantization. The resonant plasmon modes are excited when
the slot width $L$ and the plasmon wavelength $\lambda$ satisfy the condition
$L = \lambda/8 +n \times \lambda/2$, where $n=0, 1, 2 \ldots$. The lowest
resonance occurs at a surprisingly small cavity size, specifically one eighth
of the plasmon wavelength, which contrasts with the conventional
half-wavelength Fabry-Perot cavities in optics. This unique quantization rule
arises from a non-trivial phase shift of $-\pi/4$ acquired by the 2D plasmon
upon reflection from the edge of the gate. The slot plasmon modes exhibit weak
decay into the gated 2DES region, with the decay rate being proportional to the
square root of the separation between the gate and the 2DES. Absorption
cross-section by such slots reaches $\sim 50$ % of the fundamental dipole limit
without any matching strategies, and is facilitated by field enhancement at the
metal edges.

### Resolution of Loschmidts Paradox via Geometric Constraints on Information Accessibility

- **Authors**: Ira Wolfson
- **Categories**: cond-mat.stat-mech, nlin.CD, physics.hist-ph, quant-ph
- **TL;DR**: 本文解决了Loschmidt悖论——微观可逆动力学与宏观不可逆演化之间的矛盾，包括热力学时间箭头的长期谜题。核心观点是：熵增加不是因为动力学不对称，而是因为信息可及性存在几何边界。

We resolve Loschmidt's paradox -- the apparent contradiction between
time-reversible microscopic dynamics and irreversible macroscopic evolution --
including the long-standing puzzle of the thermodynamic arrow of time. The
resolution: entropy increases not because dynamics are asymmetric, but because
information accessibility is geometrically bounded. For Hamiltonian systems
(conservative dynamics), Lyapunov exponents come in positive-negative pairs
($\{\lambda_i, -\lambda_i\}$) due to symplectic structure. Under time reversal
these pairs flip ($\lambda_i \to -\lambda_i$), but stable manifolds contract
below quantum resolution $\lambda = \hbar/\sqrt{mk_BT}$, becoming physically
indistinguishable. We always observe only unstable manifolds where trajectories
diverge. Hence information loss proceeds at the same rate $h_{KS} =
\frac{1}{2}\sum_{\text{all } i}|\lambda_i|$ in both time directions, resolving
the arrow of time: ``forward'' simply means ``where we observe expansion,''
which is universal because stable manifolds always contract below
measurability. Quantitatively, for N$_2$ gas at STP with conservative estimates
($h_{KS} \sim 10^{10}$ s$^{-1}$), time reversal at $t = 1$ nanosecond requires
momentum precision $\sim 10^{-13}$ times quantum limits -- geometrically
impossible. At macroscopic times, the precision requirement becomes $\sim
10^{-10^{10}}$ times quantum limits. This framework preserves microscopic
time-reversal symmetry, requires no special initial conditions or Past
Hypothesis, and extends to quantum systems (OTOCs) and black hole
thermodynamics.

### Novel Numerical Methods for Accurate Space Thermal Analysis: Enforcing View Factors and Modeling Diffuse Reflectivity

- **TL;DR**: 本研究提出了两种新的方法来改进空间热建模中的辐射热传递模拟精度和效率，通过结合漫反射率和使用Gebhart方法计算辐射交换因子，解决了现有校正方案无法同时满足开放系统闭包性和互易性的问题。

Accurate thermal analysis is crucial for modern spacecraft, driving demand
for reliable modeling tools. This research advances space thermal modeling by
improving the simulation accuracy and efficiency of radiative heat transfer,
the dominant mode of heat exchange in space. To this end, we incorporate
diffuse reflectivity using the Gebhart method, which computes radiative
exchange factors (REFs) from geometric view factors. The view factors, obtained
via Monte Carlo ray tracing (MCRT), require post-processing to mitigate
statistical errors. Critically, existing correction schemes cannot
simultaneously enforce closure and reciprocity for open systems. This research
addresses this gap by proposing two novel enforcement methods: (i) a
least-squares optimization with non-negativity rectification (NNR) and small
positive value avoidance (SPVA), and (ii) an iterative enforcement algorithm.
To ensure consistency across different discretization levels, this work also
introduces the multi-node surface model relations to formalize the connection
between sub-face, face, and node representations of view factors and REFs. A
simple case study demonstrates a substantial reduction in mean absolute error
(MAE): the least-squares method achieves an 81% MAE reduction, while the
iterative method offers the best balance of accuracy (56% MAE reduction) and
computational efficiency. A second case study shows that including diffuse
reflections decreases the steady-state temperature of a plate by $4^{\circ}C$,
reinforcing that reflected radiation reduces net absorption. This work
introduces and validates computationally efficient methods for integrating
diffuse reflectivity into space thermal analyses and for consistently coupling
multi-node surface radiative models. The results enable more accurate and
robust thermal predictions for spacecraft systems.

- **TL;DR**: 本研究通过有限元建模和实验验证，发现振动会降低ZBLAN玻璃的热传递效率，导致样品温度下降。通过改进实验装置保持稳定接触，在振动条件下实现了均匀加热和一致的结晶行为。振动频率增加会加速成核、增强热传递，并使有效光纤拉制温度窗口降低约30°C。

In Part I of this study, vibration assisted heat treatments of ZBLAN glass
revealed irregular crystallization at higher vibration levels, attributed to
intermittent loss of thermal contact between the sample and the inner silica
ampoule wall. The present work (Part II) investigates this mechanism through
finite element modeling (FEM) and experimental validation.COMSOL Multiphysics
simulations incorporating conduction, radiation, and contact resistance confirm
that intermittent contact markedly reduces heat transfer efficiency, lowering
the sampletemperature. To mitigate this effect, the experimental setup was
redesigned with a four-degree inclination to maintain stable contact during
vibration. Subsequent experiments at vibration levels H3-H5 demonstrated
uniform heating and consistent crystallization behavior.Comprehensive
microscopic, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive X-ray
Spectroscopy (EDS), and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) analyses revealed that
even at subtle vibration levels (~50 Hz), partially crystallized ZBLAN
transformed into well-developed crystalline structures near 360C. With
increasing vibration amplitude, amorphous ZBLAN began forming incipient
crystalline phases around 330C, and at higher frequencies (~100 Hz), partial
crystallization initiated at approximately 350C. These results indicate that
higher vibration frequencies accelerate nucleation, enhance heat transfer, and
reduce the effective fiber-drawing temperature window by about 30C. Prolonged
exposure above 330C under vibration promotes unwanted phase transitions,
emphasizing the need for precise thermal and vibrational control. This study
establishes a predictive framework for vibration-resistant ZBLAN processing
applicable to both terrestrial and microgravity environments.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一类具有MH4化学计量比的高温超导体，在常压下实现超导，其中PtH4、AuH4和PdH4的超导临界温度分别达到84K、89K和133K，均超过液氮温度。

Hydrides have long been considered promising candidates for achieving
room-temperature superconductivity; however, the extremely high pressures
typically required for high critical temperatures remain a major challenge in
experiment. Here, we propose a class of high-Tc ambient-pressure
superconductors with MH4 stoichiometry. These hydrogen-based compounds adopt
the bcc PtHg4 structure type, in which hydrogen atoms occupy the one-quarter
body-diagonal sites of metal lattices, with the metal atoms acting as chemical
templates for hydrogen assembly. Through comprehensive first-principles
calculations, we identify three promising superconductors, PtH4, AuH4 and PdH4,
with superconducting critical temperatures of 84 K, 89 K, and 133 K,
respectively, all surpassing the liquid-nitrogen temperature threshold of 77 K.
The remarkable superconducting properties originate from strong electron-phonon
coupling associated with hydrogen vibrations, which in turn arise from phonon
softening in the mid-frequency range. Our results provide crucial insights into
the design of high-Tc superconductors suitable for future experiments and
applications at ambient pressure.

### Competitive Orders in Altermagnetic Chiral Magnons

- **TL;DR**: 在反铁磁体中，即使没有自旋轨道耦合和外磁场，磁振子也会出现手性分裂。研究发现，在有限温度下，长程各向异性自旋交换也能通过磁振子-磁振子相互作用诱导手性分裂，并与各向同性自旋交换诱导的手性分裂竞争，导致温度依赖的调制效应。

In altermagnets, magnons-the quanta of collective spin excitations-exhibit
chiral splitting even in the absence of spin-orbit coupling and external
magnetic fields. Typically, this chiral splitting behavior can be well
described by alternating isotropic spin exchanges (ISE) in the low-temperature
regime; however, its dynamic behavior at a finite temperature remains unclear.
In this study, we reveal that, when including magnon-magnon interactions, long
range anisotropic spin exchange (ASE) can also induce chiral splitting of
magnons at a finite temperature. Crucially, the chiral splitting induced by ASE
competes with that arising from ISE, leading to a pronounced temperature
dependent modulation of the altermagnetic chiral splitting. Moreover, this
competition is intimately connected to spin fluctuations, and can reverse the
spin current driven by the band splitting as temperature increases. Our work
uncovers the intrinsic competition governing collective spin excitations in
altermagnets, providing new insights into their finite-temperature dynamical
behavior.

- **TL;DR**: 评估GNOF和GNOFm在12个5-6元分子环上的表现，这些系统主要特征为动态相关。两种泛函在Dunning基组下都能提供平衡准确的结果，GNOFm有微小但系统的改进。

The Global Natural Orbital Functional (GNOF) provides a straightforward
approach to capture most electron correlation effects without needing
perturbative corrections or limited active spaces selection. In this work, we
evaluate both the original GNOF and its modified variant GNOFm on a set of
twelve 5- and 6-membered molecular rings, systems characterized primarily by
dynamic correlation. This reference set is vital as it comprises essential
substructures of more complex molecules. We report complete-basis-set limit
correlation energies for GNOF, GNOFm, and the benchmark CCSD(T) method. Across
the Dunning basis sets, both functionals deliver a balanced and accurate
description of the molecular set, with GNOFm showing small but systematic
improvements while preserving the overall robustness of the original
formulation. These results confirm the reliability of the GNOF family and its
ability to capture dynamic correlation effects.

### Modeling Memristor-Based Neural Networks with Manhattan Update: Trade-offs in Learning Performance and Energy Consumption

- **TL;DR**: 本研究系统分析了基于忆阻器的神经网络使用曼哈顿更新规则训练时的性能与能耗权衡，发现单感知器可容忍非线性度≤0.01，而深度神经网络需要≤0.001。增加离散电导状态可改善收敛性，提出的固定差分对中一个忆阻器的策略可将训练能耗降低近50%。

We present a systematic study of memristor based neural networks trained with
the hardware-friendly Manhattan update rule, focusing on the trade offs between
learning performance and energy consumption. Using realistic models of
potentiation/depression (P/D) curves, we evaluate the impact of nonlinearity
(NLI), conductance range, and number of accessible levels on both a single
perceptron (SP) and a deep neural network (DNN) trained on the MNIST dataset.
Our results show that SPs tolerate P/D nonlinearity up to NLI $\leq 0.01$,
while DNNs require stricter conditions of NLI $\leq$ 0.001 to preserve
accuracy. Increasing the number of discrete conductance states improves
convergence, effectively acting as a finer learning rate. We further propose a
strategy where one memristor of each differential pair is fixed, reducing
redundant memristor conductance updates. This approach lowers training energy
by nearly 50% in DNN with little to no loss in accuracy. Our findings highlight
the importance of device algorithm codesign in enabling scalable, low power
neuromorphic hardware for edge AI applications.

### Statistics of leaves in growing random trees

- **TL;DR**: 该论文研究了图中叶顶点（度为一的顶点）的重要性，引入了叶度的概念（一个顶点连接的叶子数量），并分析了随机递归树和基于叶度的优先附着模型的叶度分布特性。

Leaves, i.e., vertices of degree one, can play a significant role in graph
structure, especially in sparsely connected settings in which leaves often
constitute the largest fraction of vertices. We consider a leaf-based
counterpart of the degree, namely, the leaf degree -- the number of leaves a
vertex is connected to -- and the associated leaf degree distribution,
analogous to the degree distribution. We determine the leaf degree distribution
of random recursive trees (RRTs) and trees grown via a leaf-based preferential
attachment mechanism that we introduce. The RRT leaf degree distribution decays
factorially, in contrast with its purely geometric degree distribution. In the
one-parameter leaf-based growth model, each new vertex attaches to an existing
vertex with rate $\ell$ + a, where $\ell$ is the leaf degree of the existing
vertex, and a &gt; 0. The leaf degree distribution has a powerlaw tail when 0 &lt; a
&lt; 1 and an exponential tail (with algebraic prefactor) for a &gt; 1. The critical
case of a = 1 has a leaf degree distribution with stretched exponential tail.
We compute a variety of additional characteristics in these models and
conjecture asymptotic equivalence of degree and leaf degree powerlaw tail
exponent in the scale free regime. We highlight several avenues of possible
extension for future studies.

### Unveiling the Adsorption and Electronic Interactions of Drugs on 2D Graphsene: Insights from DFT and Machine Learning Approach

Efficient identification of promising drug candidates for nanomaterial-based
delivery systems is essential for advancing next-generation therapeutics. In
this work, we present a synergistic framework combining density functional
theory (DFT) and machine learning (ML) to explore the adsorption behavior and
electronic interactions of drugs on a novel 2D graphene allotrope, termed
Graphsene (GrS). Graphsene, characterized by its porous ring topology and large
surface area, offers an excellent platform for efficient adsorption and strong
electronic coupling with drug molecules. A dataset comprising 67 drugs adsorbed
on various 2D substrates was employed to train the ML model, which was
subsequently applied to predict suitable drug candidates for GrS based on
molecular size and adsorption energy criteria (database link provided in a
later section). The ML model exhibited robust predictive accuracy, achieving a
mean absolute error of 0.075 eV upon DFT validation, though its sensitivity to
initialization highlighted the need for larger and more diverse datasets.
DFT-based analyses, including adsorption energetics, projected density of
states (PDOS), and Bader charge calculations, revealed pronounced charge
transfer and electronic coupling between the drug molecules and the GrS
surface, elucidating the fundamental nature of drug-substrate interactions. The
study reveals that the integrated DFT-ML strategy offers a rapid,
cost-efficient approach for screening and understanding drug-nanomaterial
interactions, paving the way for data-driven design of advanced
nanomaterial-enabled drug delivery systems.

### Scalable Autoregressive Deep Surrogates for Dendritic Microstructure Dynamics

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种基于自回归深度代理模型的机器学习框架，用于快速预测合金凝固过程中的枝晶演化，相比传统相场方法实现了两个数量级的加速。

Microstructural pattern formation, such as dendrite growth, occurs widely in
materials and energy systems, significantly influencing material properties and
functional performance. While the phase-field method has emerged as a powerful
computational tool for modeling microstructure dynamics, its high computational
cost limits its integration into practical materials design workflows. Here, we
introduce a machine-learning framework using autoregressive deep surrogates
trained on short trajectories from quantitative phase-field simulations of
alloy solidification in limited spatial domains. Once trained, these surrogates
accurately predict dendritic evolution at scalable length and time scales,
achieving a speed-up of more than two orders of magnitude. Demonstrations in
isothermal growth and in directional solidification of a dilute Al-Cu alloy
validate their ability to predict microstructure evolution. Quantitative
comparisons with phase-field benchmarks further show excellent agreement in the
tip-selection constant, morphological symmetry, and primary spacing evolution.

### Upper critical in-plane magnetic field in quasi-2D layered superconductors

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一个分析多层超导体面内上临界磁场数据的框架，通过可解析处理的超导配对模型研究Hc2-Tc临界曲线，并应用于石墨烯-WSe2实验数据分析。

The study of the interplay of applied external magnetic field and
superconductivity has been invigorated by recent works on Bernal bilayer and
rhombohedral multilayer graphene. These studies, with and without proximitized
spin-orbit coupling, have opened up a new frontier in the exploration of
unconventional superconductors as they offer a unique platform to investigate
superconductivity with high degree of in-plane magnetic field resilience and
even magnetic field-induced superconductivity. Here, we present a framework for
analyzing the upper critical in-plane magnetic field data in multilayer
superconductors. Our framework relies on an analytically tractable
superconducting pairing model that captures the normal state phenomenology of
these systems and applies it to calculate the relationship between the upper
critical field $H_{c2}$ and the corresponding critical temperature $T_{c}$. We
study the $H_{c2}-T_{c}$ critical curve as a function of experimental
parameters (Ising and Rashba spin-orbit coupling) and depairing mechanisms
(Zeeman and orbital coupling) for both spin-singlet and spin-triplet pairing.
By applying our framework to analyze four recent Bernal bilayer
graphene-WSe$_2$ experiments [1-4], we identify an apparent discrepancy between
fitted and measured spin-orbit parameters, which we propose can be explained by
an enhancement of the Land\'e g factor in the Bernal bilayer graphene
experiments.

### Experimental confirmation of the magnetic ordering transition induced by an electronic structure change in the metallic triangular antiferromagnet Co$_{1/3}$TaS$_2$

We report ARPES studies combined with DFT+DMFT calculations to confirm that
the magnetic ordering vector transition from \textbf{Q}=(1/2,0,0) to
\textbf{Q}=(1/3,0,0) in the metallic triangular antiferromagnets
Co$_{1/3\pm\epsilon}$TaS$_2$ ($\epsilon\approx$0.007) is induced by the
electronic structure change in the system. The ARPES-measured Fermi surface
(FS) maps of Co$_{0.325}$TaS$_2$ show two hexagonal and one circular hole-like
FSs around $\Gamma$, which matches well with the triple-\textbf{Q} state by
taking into account the contribution of nesting vectors occurring between Co
3$d$ and Ta 5$d$ orbitals. In the case of Co$_{0.340}$TaS$_2$, a new electron
pocket around K appears and the FS geometry changes as a result of the
correlation effect of Co$_4$S$_{18}$ tripods forming in the system. The
magnetic susceptibility calculations based on the DFT+DMFT band structure
indicate that the most stable magnetic ordering vector changes to (1/3,0,0)
from (1/2,0,0), which is very consistent with the magnetic phase transition
around $x$=1/3 in Co$_{x}$TaS$_2$.

A simplification of the VV10 van der Waals density functional [J. Chem. Phys.
133, 244103 (2010)] is made by an approximation of the integrand of the
six-dimentional integral in terms of a few products of three-dimensional
density-like distributions and potential-like functions of the interelectronic
distance only, opening the way for its straightforward computation by fast
multipole methods. An even faster computational scheme for molecular systems is
implemented where the density-like distributions are fitted by linear
combinations of usual atom-centered basis functions of Gaussian type and the
six-dimensional integral is then computed analytically, at a fraction of the
overall cost of a typical calculation. The simplicity of the new approximation
is commensurate with that of the original VV10 functional, and the same level
of accuracy is seen in tests on molecules.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文开发了一种新型轨道分辨偏振测量技术，直接测量了非阿贝尔量子几何张量，实现了对六能带二维合成晶格中非阿贝尔四元数电荷、欧拉曲率和非阿贝尔量子度量的实验探测。

Recent discoveries in semi-metallic multi-gap systems featuring band
singularities have galvanized enormous interest in particular due to the
emergence of non-Abelian braiding properties of band nodes. This previously
uncharted set of topological phases necessitates novel approaches to probe them
in laboratories, a pursuit that intricately relates to evaluating non-Abelian
generalizations of the Abelian quantum geometric tensor (QGT) that
characterizes geometric responses. Here, we pioneer the direct measurement of
the non-Abelian QGT. We achieve this by implementing a novel orbital-resolved
polarimetry technique to probe the full Bloch Hamiltonian of a six-band
two-dimensional (2D) synthetic lattice, which grants direct experimental access
to non-Abelian quaternion charges, the Euler curvature, and the non-Abelian
quantum metric associated with all bands. Quantum geometry has been highlighted
to play a key role on macroscopic phenomena ranging from superconductivity in
flat-bands, to optical responses, transport, metrology, and quantum Hall
physics. Therefore, our work unlocks the experimental probing of a wide
phenomenology of multi-gap systems, at the confluence of topology, geometry and
non-Abelian physics.

### Geometry and universal scaling of Pareto-optimal signal compression

I investigate the generic problem of lossy compression of a fluctuating
stochastic signal $X$ into a discrete representation $Z$ through optimal
thresholding. The signal modulates transition rates of a two-state system
described by a binary variable $Y$. Optimising the retained mutual information
between $Z$ and $Y$ under a constraint on fixed encoding cost of $Z$ reveals
Pareto-optimal trade-offs, determined numerically using genetic algorithms. In
the small-noise regime, these fronts are either concave or exhibit piecewise
convex ``intrusions'' separated by first-order transitions in the optimal
protocol. An analytical high-rate expansion shows that the optimal threshold
density follows a universal cube-root scaling with the product of the prior
distribution and the Fisher information associated with the response, which
holds qualitatively even for few discrete states. Extending the analysis to
non-Gaussian fluctuations reveals that for some parameters optimal encoders can
yield strictly better information-cost trade-offs than Gaussian surrogates,
meaning the same information content can often be achieved with fewer discrete
readout states.

- **TL;DR**: 本文提出了Eiron中的域分解蒙特卡洛算法，相比EIRENE的两种并行算法性能更好，能解决内存限制问题，支持更大规模模拟。

EIRENE [1] is a Monte Carlo neutral transport solver heavily used in the
fusion community. EIRENE does not implement domain decomposition, making it
impossible to use for simulations where the grid data does not fit on one
compute node (see e.g. [2]). This paper presents a domain-decomposed Monte
Carlo (DDMC) algorithm implemented in a new open source Monte Carlo code,
Eiron. Two parallel algorithms currently used in EIRENE are also implemented in
Eiron, and the three algorithms are compared by running strong scaling tests,
with DDMC performing better than the other two algorithms in nearly all cases.
On the supercomputer Mahti [3], DDMC strong scaling is superlinear for grids
that do not fit into an L3 cache slice (4 MiB). The DDMC algorithm is also
scaled up to 16384 cores in weak scaling tests, with a weak scaling efficiency
of 45% in a high-collisional (heavier compute load) case, and 26% in a
low-collisional (lighter compute load) case. We conclude that implementing this
domain decomposition algorithm in EIRENE would improve performance and enable
simulations that are currently impossible due to memory constraints.

We address the problem of active optical steering of structural phase
transitions in solids. We demonstrate that existing reinforcement learning
approaches can derive optimal time-dependent electric fields in
optically-driven dissipative classical systems far beyond the harmonic regime,
enabling the stabilization of non-thermal structural phases. Our approach
relies on experimentally extractable metrics of the phase-space evolution and
physically-interpretable Fourier Neural Network surrogates of the
time-dependent electric field. Using first-principles simulations, we
demonstrate the stabilization of a symmetric phase in bismuth through impulsive
Raman scattering under continuous and pulsed light sources in the presence of
dissipation. Importantly, the method is gradient-free, which enables
optimization loops based solely on experimental data, such as the measures of
half-periods of oscillations in transient spectroscopy. Our framework thus
provides a practical route for controlling non-equilibrium structural dynamics
with light, opening pathways to stabilize hidden and metastable phases in
quantum materials.

The supercurrent diode effect (SDE), characterized by nonreciprocal critical
currents, represents a promising building block for future dissipationless
electronics and quantum circuits. Realizing SDE requires breaking both
time-reversal and inversion symmetry in the device. Here we use conductive
atomic force microscopy (c-AFM) lithography to pattern reconfigurable
superconducting weak links (WLs) at the LaAlO3/KTaO3 (LAO/KTO) interface. By
deliberately engineering the WL geometry at the nanoscale, we realize SDE in
these devices in the presence of modest out-of-plane magnetic fields. The SDE
polarity can be reversed by simply changing the WL position, and the
rectification efficiency reaches up to 13% under optimal magnetic field
conditions. Time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau simulations reveal that the observed
SDE originates from asymmetric vortex motion in the inversion-symmetry-breaking
device geometry. This demonstration of SDE in the LAO/KTO system establishes a
versatile platform for investigating and engineering vortex dynamics, forming
the basis for engineered quantum circuit elements.

We study the $T=0$ phase diagrams of models of bilayers of $S=1/2$ square
lattices antiferromagnets with SU(2) Heisenberg symmetry that have 2, 4, and 6
spin exchanges. We study two families of bilayer models with distinct internal
symmetries and, hence, different phase diagram topologies. A traditional
bilayer model in which the interlayer interaction is Heisenberg so that the two
layers can exchange spin (and energy) with each other, making it possible to
achieve a simple dimerized valence bond liquid-like state. The resulting phase
diagram is rich with N\'eel, valence bond solid and simple dimer phases, and
both first-order and continuous transitions, which we demonstrate are
consistent with the conventional Landau theory of order parameters. In the
second family of models in which the layers can exchange only energy but no
spin (reminiscent of the Ashkin-Teller coupling), the simple dimer state cannot
occur. The phase diagrams reveal a number of phase transitions that are
accessed for the first time. We find that the phase transition between N\'eel
and VBS is first order in both the spin-spin and energy-energy coupled models,
although they have strikingly distinct finite-size scaling behavior and that
the transition from VBS to dimer in the spin-spin coupling model deviates from
the expected scenario of an XY model with dangerously irrelevant four-fold

The precise identification of neurotransmitters is essential for
comprehending cerebral function, detecting neurological conditions, and
formulating successful therapeutic approaches. The present work investigates
the electrochemical detection of serotonin with the excellent hybrid
electrocatalyst $Cu_2S/H{\beta}cd-rGO$. $Cu_2S$, with its significant features
as improved catalytic activity and enhanced charge transfer when combined with
$H{\beta}cd-rGO$, will enhance the performance. The integration of $Cu_2S$ with
$H{\beta}cd-rGO$, regulated by the van der Waals force and the electrostatic
interaction, makes it a stable catalyst without disrupting the composite
structure. Also, the aggregation of the $Cu_2S/H{\beta}cd$ with the layered
sheets of rGO can be highly reduced and resulting in the improvement of the
conductivity. Thus, the above features resulted in the improved oxidation
response current when fabricated over the glassy carbon electrode (GCE). The SR
showed sensitive response at a broad linear range of 0.019 to 0.299 $\mu$M and
4.28 to 403.14 $\mu$M, resulting in a lower limit of detection (LOD) of 1.2 nM
or 0.0012 $\mu$M and a sensitivity of about 15.9 $\mu$A ${\mu}M^{-1}$
$cm^{-2}$. The sensor demonstrated excellent selectivity against common
interferents, including aminophenol, dopamine, epinephrine, hydroquinone,
melatonin, and chlorine. The real sample studies in the biological samples show
good recovery values, showing the effectiveness of the as-fabricated sensor.
Thus, the cost-efficient and straightforward integration of
$Cu_2S/H{\beta}cd-rGO$ will be an outstanding electrocatalyst for detecting SR.

- **TL;DR**: 本文严格推导了布洛赫态轨道磁矩矩阵元，包含之前被忽略的贝里联络项，发现了两个新贡献项，并在双层系统中验证了这些项对轨道霍尔电导的修正作用。

We present a rigorous derivation of the matrix elements of the orbital
magnetic moment (OMM) of Bloch states. Our calculations include the Berry
connection term in the k-derivatives of Bloch states, which was omitted in
previous works. The resulting formula for the OMM matrix elements applies to
any non-degenerate Bloch states within Hilbert space. We identify two new
contributions: the first restores gauge covariance for non-degenerate states,
while the second, being itself gauge covariant, can provide significant
quantitative corrections depending on the system under study. We examine their
impact on the orbital Hall effect in two bilayer systems: a 2H transition metal
dichalcogenide bilayer and a biased bilayer graphene. In both cases, these new
terms reduce the orbital Hall conductivity plateau compared with results that
neglect them, suggesting that multi-layered van der Waals materials may be
particularly susceptible to the derived OMM corrections. Our findings may
contribute to the formal understanding of electronic OMM transport and to the
conceptual foundations of the emerging field of orbitronics.

- **TL;DR**: 研究了一维界面守恒随机演化方程族，通过参数n推广了随机Burgers方程。分析了n=1,2,3时的强耦合标度行为，发现奇偶n值表现出不同的顶点重整化行为。

The occurrence of strong coupling or nonlinear scaling behavior for
kinetically rough interfaces whose dynamics are conserved, but not necessarily
variational, remains to be fully understood. Here we formulate and study a
family of conserved stochastic evolution equations for one-dimensional
interfaces, whose nonlinearity depends on a parameter n, thus generalizing that
of the stochastic Burgers equation, whose behavior is retrieved for n=0. This
family of equations includes as particular instances a stochastic porous medium
equation and other continuum models relevant to various hard and soft condensed
matter systems. We perform a one-loop dynamical renormalization group analysis
of the equations, which contemplates strong coupling scaling exponents that
depend on the value of $n$ and may or may not imply vertex renormalization.
These analytical expectations are contrasted with explicit numerical
simulations of the equations with n=1,2, and 3. For odd n, numerical stability
issues have required us to generalize the scheme originally proposed for n=0 by
T. Sasamoto and H. Spohn. Precisely for n=1 and 3, and at variance with the n=0
and 2 cases (whose numerical exponents are consistent with non-renormalization
of the vertex), numerical strong coupling exponent values are obtained which
suggest vertex renormalization, akin to that reported for the celebrated
conserved KPZ equation. We also study numerically the statistics of height
fluctuations, whose probability distribution function turns out (at variance
with cKPZ) to have zero skewness for long times and at saturation, irrespective
of the value of n. However, the kurtosis is non-Gaussian, further supporting
the conclusion on strong coupling asymptotic behavior. The zero skewness seems
related with space symmetries of the n=0 and 2 equations, and with an emergent
symmetry at the strong coupling fixed point for odd values of n.

Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) integrates partial differential
equations (PDEs) into machine learning models to solve inverse problems, such
as estimating coefficient functions (e.g., the Hamiltonian function) that
characterize physical systems. This framework enables data-driven understanding
and prediction of complex physical phenomena. While coefficient functions in
PIML are typically estimated on the basis of predictive performance, physics as
a discipline does not rely solely on prediction accuracy to evaluate models.
For example, Kepler's heliocentric model was favored owing to small
discrepancies in planetary motion, despite its similar predictive accuracy to
the geocentric model. This highlights the inherent uncertainties in data-driven
model inference and the scientific importance of selecting physically
meaningful solutions. In this paper, we propose a framework to quantify and
analyze such uncertainties in the estimation of coefficient functions in PIML.
We apply our framework to reduced model of magnetohydrodynamics and our
framework shows that there are uncertainties, and unique identification is
possible with geometric constraints. Finally, we confirm that we can estimate
the reduced model uniquely by incorporating these constraints.

To enable lightweight and flexible solar cell applications it is imperative
to develop direct bandgap absorber materials. Moreover, to enhance the
potential sustainability impact of the technologies there is a drive to base
the devices on earth-abundant and readily available elements. Herein, we report
on the epitaxial growth of Zn3P2 nanowires using exclusively earth-abundant
components, using Sn as the nanowire catalyst and Si (111) as the substrate. We
observe that the nanowires exhibit a triangular cross section at lower
temperatures, a pseudo-pentagonal cross section at intermediate temperatures,
and a hexagonal cross section in a twin plane superlattice configuration at
high temperatures and high V/II ratios. At low temperatures, the surface facets
are constricted into a metastable configuration, yielding the triangular
morphology due to the symmetry of the substrate, while intermediate
temperatures facilitate the formation of a pseudo-pentagonal morphology with
lower surface to volume ratio. The twin plane superlattice structure can only
be observed at conditions that facilitate the incorporation of Sn into Zn3P2,
which is needed to form heterotwins in the tetragonal structure, namely at high
temperatures and high phosphine partial pressures. These findings show a clear
pathway to use Zn3P2 nanowires in sustainable solar energy harvesting using
exclusively earth-abundant components, as well as opening up a novel route of
fabricating quantum wells inside nanowires using heterotwins.

### Pair-mixing induced Time-reversal-breaking superconductivity

Experimental evidences of spontaneous time-reversal (TR) symmetry breaking
have been reported for the superconducting ground state in the transition metal
dichalcogenide (TMD) superconductor 4H$_b$-TaS$_2$ or chiral molecule
intercalated TaS$_2$ hybrid superlattices, and is regarded as evidence of
emergent chiral superconductivity. However, the $T_c$ of these TMD
superconductors is of the same order as pristine 1H or 2H-TaS$_2$, which do not
show any signature of TR breaking and are believed to be conventional
Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer superconductors. To resolve this puzzle, we propose a
new type of pair-mixing state that mixes the dominant conventional s-wave
pairing channel with the subdominant chiral p-wave pairing channel via a finite
Cooper-pair momentum, based on symmetry analysis within the Ginzburg-Landau
theory. Our analysis shows that the fourth-order terms in the chiral p-wave
channel can lead to a variety of pair-mixing states with spontaneous TR
breaking. These TR-breaking superconducting states also reveal a zero-field,
junction-free superconducting diode effect that is observed in chiral molecule
intercalated TaS$_2$ superlattices.

We investigate the interplay between altermagnetic band structures and
electronic correlations by focusing on the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ altermagnetic
generalization of the Hatsugai-Kohmoto model. We find that with increasing
interaction, a many-body Lifshitz transition takes place when doubly occupied
regions disappear from the Fermi surface and each momentum state becomes fully
spin polarized. The spin susceptibility is directly evaluated from the Kubo
formula in terms of many-body occupation probabilities. We find that the
dynamical susceptibility, which possesses only transverse non-zero components
for small wavevectors, develops a gap proportional to the interaction strength,
and displays a sharp peak at a frequency increasing with the interaction. %with
increasing frequency. Above the Lifshitz transition, this peak moves to the
lower gap edge and becomes log-divergent. The signal intensity increases with
the interaction up until the Lifshitz transition and saturates afterwards. The
static susceptibility remains unaffected by the correlations and altermagnetism
reduces the static transverse response.

We analyze the thermal and electrical characteristics of the metasurface
consisting of
  the coplanar interdigital array of the graphene microribbons (GMRs) connected
by nanobridges (NBs). These nanobridges could be implemented using graphene
nanoribbons (GNRs), single-wall semiconducting carbon nanotubes (CNTs), or
black-arsenic-phosphorus (b-AsP) nanostructures. The bias voltage applied
between neighboring GMRs indices electron and hole two-dimensional systems in
the GMRs and induces thermionic currents flowing through connecting NBs. The
resulting self-heating increases thermionic currents providing an effective
positive feadback between the carrier effective temperature and the injected
currents. This mechanism may lead to thermal breakdown enabling threshold
behavior of current-voltage characteristics and resulting in the S-shape of
these characteristics. The devices based on the GMR/GNR, GMR/CNT, and GMR/AsP
metasurface structures can be used as fast voltage-controlled current switches,
sensors, thermal terahertz and infrared sources, and other devices.

### XYZ integrability the easy way

Sutherland showed that the XYZ quantum spin-chain Hamiltonian commutes with
the eight-vertex model transfer matrix, so that Baxter's subsequent tour de
force proves the integrability of both. The proof requires parametrising the
Boltzmann weights using elliptic theta functions and showing they satisfy the
Yang-Baxter equation. We here give a simpler derivation of the integrability of
the XYZ chain by explicitly constructing an extensive sequence of conserved
charges from a matrix-product operator. We show that they commute with the XYZ
Hamiltonian with periodic boundary conditions or an arbitrary boundary magnetic
field. A straightforward generalisation yields impurity interactions that
preserve the integrability. Placing such an impurity at the edge gives an
integrable generalisation of the Kondo problem with a gapped bulk. We make
contact with the traditional approach by relating our matrix-product operator
to products of the eight-vertex model transfer matrix.

### Combining Harmonic Sampling with the Worm Algorithm to Improve the Efficiency of Path Integral Monte Carlo

- **TL;DR**: 提出了两种改进的路径积分蒙特卡洛算法：H-PIMC和M-PIMC，通过将势能分解为谐波和非谐波部分来提高固体和稠密受限液体系统的采样效率。

We propose an improved Path Integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) algorithm called
Harmonic PIMC (H-PIMC) and its generalization, Mixed PIMC (M-PIMC). PIMC is a
powerful tool for studying quantum condensed phases. However, it often suffers
from a low acceptance ratio for solids and dense confined liquids. We develop
two sampling schemes especially suited for such problems by dividing the
potential into its harmonic and anharmonic contributions. In H-PIMC, we
generate the imaginary time paths for the harmonic part of the potential
exactly and accept or reject it based on the anharmonic part. In M-PIMC, we
restrict the harmonic sampling to the vicinity of local minimum and use
standard PIMC otherwise, to optimize efficiency. We benchmark H-PIMC on systems
with increasing anharmonicity, improving the acceptance ratio and lowering the
auto-correlation time. For weakly to moderately anharmonic systems, at $\beta
\hbar \omega=16$, H-PIMC improves the acceptance ratio by a factor of 6-16 and
reduces the autocorrelation time by a factor of 7-30. We also find that the
method requires a smaller number of imaginary time slices for convergence,
which leads to another two- to four-fold acceleration. For strongly anharmonic
systems, M-PIMC converges with a similar number of imaginary time slices as
standard PIMC, but allows the optimization of the auto-correlation time. We
extend M-PIMC to periodic systems and apply it to a sinusoidal potential.
Finally, we combine H- and M-PIMC with the worm algorithm, allowing us to
obtain similar efficiency gains for systems of indistinguishable particles.

Light polarization is one of the most fundamental features, equivalent to
energy and coherence. Magnetism changes light polarization, and vice versa. The
irradiation of intense circularly polarized femtosecond pules to magnetic
materials can alter the magnetic orders and elementary excitations,
particularly in the visible to infrared spectral regions. Furthermore, the
recent development of x-ray free-electron laser enables the element-specific
trace of the ultrafast dynamics with high time and spatial resolution. However,
the light helicity of x-ray photons has not yet been used to control order
parameters in condensed matter materials, not limited to such magnetic
phenomenon. Here, we demonstrate the deterministic magnetization reversal of a
ferromagnetic Pt/Co/Pt multilayer solely by irradiating femtosecond pulses of
circularly polarized hard x-rays. The observed all-optical magnetization
switching depends on the helicity of incident x-ray pulses and is strongly
resonant with the photon energy at the Pt $L_3$ edge. These results originate
in the x-ray magnetic circular dichroism of Pt, involving helicity-dependent
excitation from the 2$p_{3/2}$ core level to the exchange-split 5$d$ valence
states owing to the magnetic proximity effect with Co. These findings mark a
new frontier for examining interactions between light and matter in the x-ray
region.

We investigate analytically and numerically the effects of disorder on the
helical edge of the 2D topological insulator in the presence of the Zeeman
field and superconductivity. Employing bosonization and a renormalization-group
analysis, we study how impurity potentials modify charge- and spin-density wave
correlations as well as superconducting pair correlations. Our results reveal
that the Zeeman field controls the competition: in the attractive regime, it
amplifies the superconducting gap, while in the repulsive regime, it stabilizes
impurity effects by keeping the system longer in the relevant regime for
disorder. We also find that disorder induces logarithmic suppression of
transverse density-wave correlations, while at the same time introducing
positive logarithmic corrections that enhance superconducting pair correlations
and contribute to their stability. These effects directly modify the scaling of
spin conductance, providing experimentally accessible signatures of the
interplay between disorder and superconductivity in topological edge channels.

Arrays of bosonic condensates of exciton-polaritons have emerged as a
promising platform for simulating classical XY models, capable of rapidly
reaching phase-locked states that may be mapped to arrays of two-dimensional
classical spins. However, it remains unclear whether these states genuinely
minimize the corresponding XY Hamiltonian and how the convergence time scales
with the system size. Here, we develop an analytical model revealing that an
array of $N$ condensates possesses $N$ stable phase configurations. The system
selectively amplifies a specific configuration dependent on the pump power: at
low power, the state with the smallest eigenvalue of an effective XY
Hamiltonian is favored, while at high power, the state with the largest
eigenvalue prevails. At intermediate pump powers, the system visits all
eigenstates of the Hamiltonian. Crucially, the formation rate for any of these
phase-locked states remains on the order of 100 ps, independent of the size of
the array, demonstrating the exceptional speed and scalability of
polariton-based XY simulators.

We present a study of low-temperature electric and thermal transport in
RuO$_2$, a metallic oxide which has attracted much recent attention. Careful
scrutiny of electric resistivity reveals a quadratic temperature dependence
below $\sim$ 20 K undetected in previous studies of electronic transport in
this material. The prefactor of this T$^2$ resistivity, given the electronic
specific heat, corresponds to what is expected by the Kadowaki-Woods scaling.
The variation of its amplitude across 4 different samples is negligible despite
an eightfold variation of residual resistivity. There is also a T$^5$
resistivity due to scattering by phonons. By measuring thermal conductivity,
$\kappa$, at zero field and at 12 T, we separated its electronic and the
phononic components and found that the electronic component respects the
Wiedemann-Franz law at zero temperature and deviates downward at finite
temperature. The latter corresponds to a threefold discrepancy between the
prefactors of the two (thermal and electric) T-square resistivities. Our
results, establishing RuO$_2$ as a weakly correlated Fermi liquid, provide new
input for the ongoing theoretical attempt to give a quantitative account of
electron-electron scattering in metallic oxides starting from first principles.

Accurate determination of crystal structures is central to materials science,
underpinning the understanding of composition-structure-property relationships
and the discovery of new materials. Powder X-ray diffraction is a key technique
in this pursuit due to its versatility and reliability. However, current
analysis pipelines still rely heavily on expert knowledge and slow iterative
fitting, limiting their scalability in high-throughput and autonomous settings.
Here, we introduce a physics-guided contrastive learning framework termed as
XCCP. It aligns powder diffraction patterns with candidate crystal structures
in a shared embedding space to enable efficient structure retrieval and
symmetry recognition. The XRD encoder employs a dual-expert design with a
Kolmogorov-Arnold Network projection head, one branch emphasizes low angle
reflections reflecting long-range order, while the other captures dense high
angle peaks shaped by symmetry. Coupled with a crystal graph encoder,
contrastive pretraining yields physically grounded representations. XCCP
demonstrates strong performance across tasks, with structure retrieval reaching
0.89 and space group identification attains 0.93 accuracy. The framework
further generalizes to compositionally similar multi principal element alloys
and demonstrates zero-shot transfer to experimental patterns. These results
establish XCCP as a robust, interpretable, and scalable approach that offers a
new paradigm for X-ray diffraction analysis. XCCP facilitates high-throughput
screening, rapid structural validation and integration into autonomous
laboratories.

Hydrocarbon contamination is an ever-present factor to consider in surface
science measurements. In the case of van der Waals material surfaces, the
structure of this contamination has become known in recent years as a
self-assembled layer of normal-alkanes, resulting from a few days' exposure to
ambient air. Knowledge of its composition and structure enables systematic
investigation of its influence on surface properties. Here, we investigate the
effect of this contamination on scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and
spectroscopy measurements by comparing clean and ambient alkane-contaminated
surfaces of graphite. Our results reveal that the ambient alkane layer
suppresses the well-known phonon-induced gap near the Fermi energy, resolving a
long-standing inconsistency in STM studies, where this feature is often absent.
Furthermore, we show that the presence of the contamination layer alters the
current-distance ($I(z)$) characteristics, flattening its exponential decay by
a factor of 1.5 to 5 compared to the clean surface. This change arises from
extra conductance channels through the alkane layer alongside the tunnel
junction, as the tip penetrates the contaminant overlayer. Finally, based on
the $I(z)$ characteristics, we provide a practical guide to detect the presence

Inorganic crystal materials have broad application potential due to excellent
physical and chemical properties, with elastic properties (shear modulus, bulk
modulus) crucial for predicting materials' electrical conductivity, thermal
conductivity and mechanical properties. Traditional experimental measurement
suffers from high cost and low efficiency, while theoretical simulation and
graph neural network-based machine learning methods--especially crystal graph
convolutional neural networks (CGCNNs)--have become effective alternatives,
achieving remarkable results in predicting material elastic properties. This
study trained two CGCNN models using shear modulus and bulk modulus data of
10987 materials from the Matbench v0.1 dataset, which exhibit high accuracy
(mean absolute error &lt;13, coefficient of determination R-squared close to 1)
and good generalization ability. Materials were screened to retain those with
band gaps between 0.1-3.0 eV and exclude radioactive element-containing
compounds. The final predicted dataset comprises two parts: 54359 crystal
structures from the Materials Project database and 26305 crystal structures
discovered by Merchant et al. (2023 Nature 624 80). Ultimately, this study
completed the prediction of shear modulus and bulk modulus for 80664 inorganic
crystals. This work enriches existing material elastic data resources and
provides robust support for material design, with all data openly available at

Topological materials--including insulators (TIs) and semimetals (TSMs)--hold
immense promise for quantum technologies, yet their discovery remains
constrained by the high computational cost of first-principles calculations and
the slow, resource-intensive nature of experimental synthesis. Here, we
introduce TXL Fusion, a hybrid machine learning framework that integrates
chemical heuristics, engineered physical descriptors, and large language model
(LLM) embeddings to accelerate the discovery of topological materials. By
incorporating features such as space group symmetry, valence electron
configurations, and composition-derived metrics, TXL Fusion classifies
materials across trivial, TSM, and TI categories with improved accuracy and
generalization compared to conventional approaches. The framework successfully
identified new candidates, with representative cases further validated through
density functional theory (DFT), confirming its predictive robustness. By
uniting data-driven learning with chemical intuition, TXL Fusion enables rapid
and interpretable exploration of complex materials spaces, establishing a
scalable paradigm for the intelligent discovery of next-generation topological
and quantum materials.

### Symmetry-enriched topological order and quasi-fractonic behavior in $\mathbb{Z}_N$ stabilizer codes

- **TL;DR**: 该论文研究了Z_N双变量自行车(BB)码的拓扑性质，发现这些码的拓扑特性可以通过其Z_p对应物(p是N的质因数)来确定，即使N包含质数幂次。

We study a broad class of qudit stabilizer codes, termed $\mathbb{Z}_N$
bivariate-bicycle (BB) codes, arising either as two-dimensional realizations of
modulated gauge theories or as $\mathbb{Z}_N$ generalizations of binary BB
codes. Our central finding, derived from the polynomial representation, is that
the essential topological properties of these $\mathbb{Z}_N$ codes can be
determined by the properties of their $\mathbb{Z}_p$ counterparts, where $p$
are the prime factors of $N$, even when $N$ contains prime powers ($N = \prod_i
p_i^{k_i}$). This result yields a significant simplification by leveraging the
well-studied framework of codes with prime qudit dimensions. In particular,
this insight directly enables the generalization of the algebraic-geometric
methods (e.g., the Bernstein-Khovanskii-Kushnirenko theorem) to determine anyon
fusion rules in the general qudit situation. Moreover, we analyze the model's
symmetry-enriched topological order (SET) to reveal a quasi-fractonic behavior,
resolving the anyon mobility puzzle in this class of models. We also present a
computational algebraic method using Gr\"{o}bner bases over the ring of
integers to efficiently calculate the topological order and its SET properties.

- **TL;DR**: 在WSe2单层中，重n掺杂显著增强了多粒子激子复合物的光致发光强度，量子产率超过50%，为高效原子级薄光发射器提供了新机会。

Monolayers of group-VI transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are
two-dimensional semiconductors that exhibit exceptionally strong light-matter
coupling yet typically suffer from low emission quantum yields. In this letter,
we investigate the heavily n-doped regime of a WSe$_2$ monolayer and show that
multi-particle excitonic complexes produce photoluminescence signals up to two
orders of magnitude stronger than in the neutral state. Time-resolved
photoluminescence and differential reflectivity measurements reveal that the
quantum yield rises with carrier density and exceeds 50% for electron
concentrations above 10$^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$. These findings establish TMD
monolayers as a platform for exploring excitonic complexes in high-density
electron gases and point toward new opportunities for efficient, atomically
thin light emitters.

### The phase-field model of fracture incorporating Mohr-Coulomb, Mogi-Coulomb, and Hoek-Brown strength surfaces

- **TL;DR**: 该研究实现了一个通用的相场断裂驱动力的有限元框架，能够同时考虑材料的强度面和韧性控制，适用于多种强度准则。

Classical phase-field theories of brittle fracture capture
toughness-controlled crack propagation but do not account for the material's
strength surface, which governs fracture nucleation in the absence of cracks.
The phase-field formulation of Kumar et al. (2020) proposed a blueprint for
incorporating the strength surface while preserving toughness-controlled
propagation by introducing a nucleation driving force and presented results for
the Drucker--Prager surface. Following this blueprint, Chockalingam (2025)
recently derived a general driving-force expression that incorporates arbitrary
strength surfaces. The present work implements this driving force within a
finite-element framework and incorporates representative strength surfaces that
span diverse mathematical and physical characteristics -- the Mohr--Coulomb, 3D
Hoek--Brown, and Mogi--Coulomb surfaces. Through simulations of canonical
fracture problems, the formulation is comprehensively validated across fracture
regimes, capturing (i) nucleation under uniform stress, (ii) crack growth from
large pre-existing flaws, and (iii) fracture governed jointly by strength and
toughness. While the strength surfaces examined here already encompass a broad
range of brittle materials, the results demonstrate the generality and
robustness of the proposed driving-force construction for materials governed by
arbitrary strength surfaces.

### Unconventional Thermal Expansion in quasi-one-dimensional monoclinic BaIrO$_3$

We have investigated the temperature dependence of the crystal structure of
quasi-one-dimensional monoclinic BaIrO$_3$ using X-ray diffraction. Diffraction
patterns were measured across a temperature range from 13 K to 300 K, with
5-degree steps, and Rietveld refinements were performed to extract the relevant
lattice parameters. The resulting cell volumes exhibit a significant deviation
from the Debye model predictions for lattice-specific heat within a reasonable
range of the Debye temperature, Gr{\"u}neisen parameter, and bulk modulus. This
suggests an invar-like, unconventional thermal expansion behavior. The
deviation begins near the weak ferromagnetic transition temperature, indicating
a strong correlation with changes in the electronic and magnetic structure of
monoclinic BaIrO$_3$.

### Correlated electronic structure and local spin in lead-copper-vanadium-bromine apatite: a DMFT study

We study the correlated electronic structure and local spin behaviour of the
copper-substituted lead-vanadium bromine apatite Pb$_9$Cu(VO$_4$)$_6$Br$_2$
using DFT+DMFT with a two-orbital Cu-centred low-energy model. Simulations are
done for several temperatures (20, 60, 100 K) and a broad range of band
fillings 2.46 $\leq$ n $\leq$ 3.54. We find that the present compound stays
metallic even once correlations are treated dynamically around the
stoichiometric filling (n $\simeq$ 3). Away from n $\simeq$ 3, both hole and
electron doping drive the system toward non-Fermi-liquid behaviour, and
spectral weight is transferred from the low-energy peak into upper and lower
Hubbard-like features. By analysing the low-frequency self-energy exponent and
the dynamical part of the local spin susceptibility, we identify a narrow
window of enhanced spin fluctuations on the slightly hole-doped side (n
$\simeq$ 2.94), i.e. a spin-freezing-crossover regime of the kind reported in
the literature for multiorbital Hund metals. This places
Pb$_9$Cu(VO$_4$)$_6$Br$_2$ among the promising members of the Cu-substituted
apatite family.

Quantum simulators enable studies of many-body phenomena which are
intractable with classical hardware. Spins in devices based on semiconductor
quantum dots promise precise electrical control and scalability advantages, but
accessing many-body phenomena has so far been restricted by challenges in
nanofabrication and simultaneous control of multiple interactions. Here, we
perform spectroscopy of up to eight interacting spins using a 2x4 array of
gate-defined germanium quantum dots. The spectroscopy protocol is based on
Ramsey interferometry and adiabatic mapping of many-body eigenstates to
single-spin eigenstates, enabling a complete energy spectrum reconstruction. As
the interaction strength exceeds magnetic disorder, we observe signatures of
the crossover from localization to a chaotic phase marking a step towards the
observation of many-body phenomena in quantum dot systems.

### Revealing the innate sub-nanometer porous structure of carbon nanomembranes with molecular dynamics simulations and highly charged ion spectroscopy

- **TL;DR**: 该研究通过分子动力学模拟构建不同孔隙度的碳纳米膜结构模型，并与实验数据对比，揭示了碳纳米膜在真空中的结构特征和组成。

Carbon nanomembranes (CNMs) are nanometer-thin disordered carbon materials
that are suitable for a range of applications, from energy generation and
storage, through to water filtration. The structure-property relationships of
these nanomembranes are challenging to study using traditional experimental
characterization techniques, primarily due to the radiation-sensitivity of the
free-standing membrane. Highly charged ion spectroscopy is a novel
characterization method that is able to infer structural details of the carbon
nanomembrane without concern of induced damage affecting the measurements. Here
we employ molecular dynamics simulations to produce candidate structural models
of terphenylthiol-based CNMs with varying degrees of nanoscale porosity, and
compare predicted ion charge exchange data and tensile moduli to experiment.
The results suggest that the in-vacuum CNM composition likely comprises a
significant fraction of under-coordinated carbon, with an open sub-nanometer
porous structure. Such a carbon network would be reactive in atmosphere and
would be presumably stabilized by hydrogen and oxygen groups under atmospheric
conditions.

### High-Temperature Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect in Buckled Honeycomb Antiferromagnets

We propose N\'eel antiferromagnetic (AF) Mott insulators with a buckled
honeycomb structure as potential candidates to host a high-temperature AF Chern
insulator (AFCI). Using a generalized Kondo lattice model we show that the
staggered potential induced by a perpendicular electric field due to the
buckling can drive the AF Mott insulator to an AFCI phase. We address the
temperature evolution of the Hall conductance and the chiral edge states. The
quantization temperature $T_q$, below which the Hall conductance is quantized,
depends essentially on the strength of the spin-orbit coupling and the hopping
parameter, independent of the specific details of the model. The deviation of
the Hall conductance from the quantized value $e^2/h$ above $T_q$ is found to
be accompanied by a spectral broadening of the chiral edge states, reflecting a
finite life-time, i.e., a decay. Using parameters typical for heavy
transition-metal elements we predict that the AFCI can survive up to room
temperature. We suggest Sr$_3$CaOs$_2$O$_9$ as a potential compound to realize
a high-$T$ AFCI phase.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文研究了量子点热机的性能优化，重点分析了内部微观动力学对最大功率、最大功率效率和噪声等实际参数的影响，而不仅仅是追求卡诺效率。

Continuous particle exchange thermal machines require no time-dependent
driving, can be realised in solid-state electronic devices, and miniaturised to
nanometre scale. Quantum dots, providing a narrow energy filter and allowing to
manipulate particle flow between the hot and cold reservoirs are at the heart
of such devices. It has been theoretically shown that by mitigating passive
heat flow, Carnot efficiency can be approached arbitrarily closely in a quantum
dot heat engine, and experimentally, values of 0.7{\eta}C have been reached.
However, for practical applications, other parameters of a thermal machine,
such as maximum power, efficiency at maximum power, and noise - stability of
the power output or heat extraction - take precedence over maximising
efficiency. We explore the effect of internal microscopic dynamics of a quantum
dot on these quantities and demonstrate that its performance as a thermal
machine depends on few parameters - the overall conductance and three inherent
asymmetries of the dynamics. These parameters will act as a guide to
engineering the quantum states of the quantum dot, allowing to optimise its
performance beyond that of the simplest case of a two-fold spin-degenerate
transmission level.

### The Moving Beam Diffraction Geometry: the DIAD Application of a Diffraction Scanning-Probe

Understanding the interactions between microstructure, strain, phase, and
material behavior is crucial in many scientific fields. However, quantifying
these correlations is challenging, as it requires the use of multiple
instruments and techniques, often separated by space and time. The Dual Imaging
And Diffraction (DIAD) beamline at Diamond is designed to address this
challenge. DIAD allows its users to visualize internal structures, identify
compositional/phase changes, and measure strain. DIAD provides two independent
beams combined at one sample position, allowing quasi-simultaneous X-ray
Computed Tomography and X-ray Powder Diffraction. A unique functionality of the
DIAD configuration is the ability to perform image-guided diffraction, where
the micron-sized diffraction beam is scanned over the complete area of the
imaging field of view without moving the specimen. This moving beam diffraction
geometry enables the study of fast-evolving and motion-susceptible processes
and samples. Here, we discuss the novel moving beam diffraction geometry
presenting the latest findings on the reliability of both geometry calibration
and data reduction routines used. Our measures confirm diffraction is most
sensitive to the moving geometry for the detector position downstream normal to
the incident beam. The observed data confirm that the motion of the KB mirror
coupled with a fixed aperture slit results in a rigid translation of the beam
probe, without affecting the angle of the incident beam path to the sample. Our
measures demonstrate a nearest-neighbour calibration can achieve the same
accuracy as a self-calibrated geometry when the distance between calibrated and
probed sample region is smaller or equal to the beam spot size. We show the
absolute error of the moving beam diffraction geometry remains below 0.0001,
which is the accuracy we observe for the beamline with stable beam operation.

Donor spin qubits in silicon offer one- and two-qubit gates with fidelities
beyond 99%, coherence times exceeding 30 seconds, and compatibility with
industrial manufacturing methods. This motivates the development of large-scale
quantum processors using this platform, and the ability to automatically tune
and operate such complex devices. In this work, we present the first machine
learning algorithm with the ability to automatically locate the charge
transitions of an ion-implanted donor in a silicon device, tune single-shot
charge readout, and identify the gate voltage parameters where tunnelling rates
in and out the donor site are the same. The entire tuning pipeline is completed
on the order of minutes. Our results enable both automatic characterisation and
tuning of a donor in silicon devices faster than human experts.

Understanding charge transfer at oxide interfaces is crucial for designing
materials with emergent electronic and magnetic properties, especially in
systems where strong electron correlations and spin-orbit coupling coexist.
SrIrO$_3$/SrCoO$_3$ (SIO/SCO) superlattices offer a unique platform to explore
these effects due to their contrasting electronic structures and magnetic
behaviors. Building on past theory based on continuity of O 2p band alignment,
we employ density functional theory (DFT) to model electron transfer from Ir to
Co across the SIO/SCO interface. To characterize these effects, we synthesized
epitaxial SIO/SCO superlattices via molecular beam epitaxy. Structural and
transport measurements confirmed high crystallinity, metallic behavior, and
suppression of Kondo scattering that has been reported in uniform SIO films.
Further characterization via X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) revealed
orbital anisotropy and valence changes consistent with interfacial charge
transfer. Co K- and L$_{2,3}$-edge and Ir L$_2$-edge spectra verified electron
donation from Ir to Co, stabilizing the perovskite SCO phase and tuning the
electronic structure of SIO via hole-doping. O K-edge XAS showed band alignment
shifts in the SIO layer consistent with DFT predictions. Our work here provides
a pathway for engineering oxide heterostructures with tailored magnetic and
electronic properties.
