Designing metamaterials for extreme mechanical behavior involves the optimal
selection of design parameters. However, identifying these optimal parameters
through topology optimization (TO) across a large parametric space requires
extensive computational resources. To address this challenge, we propose a
novel deep learning framework for metamaterial topology optimization using an
enhanced deep super-resolution (EDSR) approach. Generating low-resolution
topologies significantly reduces computational cost compared to high-resolution
designs. Therefore, an EDSR network is trained to learn the mapping between
low- and high-resolution metamaterial topologies. The training dataset is
generated using solid isotropic material with penalization (SIMP)-based TO. We
demonstrate the proposed approach for the design of mechanical metamaterials
targeting objectives such as maximization of bulk modulus, shear modulus, and
elastic modulus, and minimization of Poisson's ratio. Quantitative assessments
-including (i) pixel value error, (ii) objective function error, (iii)
intersection over union, and (iv) volume fraction error -validate the accuracy
of the EDSR-based TO. Our framework predicts high-resolution topologies of size
$192 \times 192$ from optimized low-resolution topologies of size $48 \times
48$. Once trained, the proposed network predicts these high-resolution
topologies with only $5-7\%$ of the computational cost required by conventional
SIMP-based TO at the same resolution. Moreover, by adding upscale blocks, the
framework can generate smoother, higher-resolution topologies suitable for 3D
printing. This approach offers a scalable and efficient solution with strong
potential for multidisciplinary metamaterial design applications.

### Structure Matters: A Scale-Resolved Numerical Operando Approach for Lithium-Sulfur Batteries

- **TL;DR**: 本文提出了一种多尺度模拟方法，用于研究锂硫电池多孔阴极结构对放电倍率性能的影响，通过高性能计算和粗粒度连续介质模型来改进锂硫电池性能。

Lithium-Sulfur batteries (LSBs) are believed to have a high potential for
aerospace applications due to their high gravimetric energy density. However,
despite decades of research and advances, they still suffer from poor rate
capability and low power output, eventually preventing their practical
implementation. One particular aspect we want to shed light on is the influence
of the porous cathode structure on the rate performance during discharge.
Therefore, we present a scale-resolved simulation methodology that aims to
provide structural insights into the electrochemical cell behavior that are
experimentally hardly accessible even for modern operando methods. Our
numerical operando approach employs high-performance computing (HPC) and is
based on a coarse-grained continuum model. The latter is spatially discretized
with a Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method and advanced in time by an adaptive
controller. The models and methods as well as HPC aspects of our toolbox will
be critically discussed, finally showcasing the capabilities of our workflow to
improve LSBs.

### Impact of higher-order exchange on the lifetime of skyrmions and antiskyrmions

- **TL;DR**: 本文研究了高阶交换相互作用对斯格明子和反斯格明子寿命的影响，发现在包含四阶交换项后，这些拓扑磁结构的寿命显著增强，甚至在没有DMI的情况下也能保持热稳定性。

Reliable control of skyrmion lifetime is essential for realizing spintronic
devices, yet the role of higher-order exchange - which can lead to skyrmion
stabilization - remains largely unexplored. Here we calculate lifetimes of
isolated skyrmions and antiskyrmions at transition-metal interfaces based on an
atomistic spin model that includes all fourth-order exchange terms. Within
harmonic transition-state theory, we evaluate both energetic and entropic
contributions and find substantially enhanced lifetimes when higher-order
exchange is included. The four-spin four-site interaction raises the energy
barrier and lowers the curvature of the energy landscape at the collapse saddle
point, increasing the pre-exponential factor. We show that skyrmions and
antiskyrmions can remain thermally stable even without Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
interaction (DMI), and that tuning the four-spin term by a small amount
modulates the prefactor over orders of magnitude. Our results identify
higher-order exchange as a promising route to stabilize topological magnetic
textures - in particular in systems lacking DMI - and to engineer their
thermally activated decay.

### Systematic global structure search of bismuth-based binary systems under pressure using machine learning potentials

- **TL;DR**: 使用多项式机器学习势能对11种铋基二元系统在0-20 GPa压力范围内进行全局结构搜索，发现了多个新化合物并验证了已知化合物，证明了MLP方法的可靠性。

Machine learning potentials (MLPs) have significantly advanced global crystal
structure prediction by enabling efficient and accurate property evaluations.
In this study, global structure searches are performed for 11 bismuth-based
binary systems, including Na-Bi, Ca-Bi, and Eu-Bi, under pressures ranging from
0 to 20 GPa, employing polynomial MLPs developed specifically for these
systems. The searches reveal numerous compounds not previously reported in the
literature and identify all experimentally known compounds that are
representable within the explored configurational space. These results
highlight the robustness and reliability of the current MLP-based structure
search. The study provides valuable insights into the discovery and design of
novel bismuth-based materials under both ambient and high-pressure conditions.

### Recursive entropy in thermodynamics: establishing the statistical-physics basis of the zentropy approach

- **Categories**: cond-mat.stat-mech
- **TL;DR**: 本文证明了zentropy理论中的熵方程是熵的递归性质的表述，阐明了熵作为未约束自由度不确定性的含义，并通过最大化递归形式的熵推导出配分函数，为微观与宏观行为提供了严格桥梁。

The recursive property of entropy is well known in the field of information
theory; however, the concept is rarely used in the field of thermodynamics,
despite being the field where the concept of entropy originated. This work
shows that the equation for entropy used in the zentropy, which is an exact
multiscale approach to thermodynamics, is a statement of the recursive property
of entropy. Further, we clarify the meaning of entropy as the uncertainty
arising from unconstrained degrees of freedom and separate configurational
contributions from intra-configurational ones. Building on this, we derive the
partition function, as used in zentropy, by maximizing entropy in its recursive
form. The resulting framework is exact for a chosen level of description and
enables principled coarse-graining, thereby reducing computational complexity
while preserving thermodynamic consistency. These results position zentropy as
a rigorous bridge between microscopic and macroscopic behavior, facilitating
quantitative predictions and the study of emergent phenomena.

### Twistraintronics in Square Moire Superlattices of Stacked Graphene Layers

- **TL;DR**: 首次观察到可控应变诱导的方形莫尔图案，通过选择性位移天然褶皱实现了从三角到方形莫尔结构的可逆转变，展示了扭曲应变电子学在实现高关联电子态方面的潜力。

We report the first observation of controlled, strain-induced square moire
patterns in stacked graphene. By selectively displacing native wrinkles, we
drive a reversible transition from the usual trigonal to square moire order.
Scanning tunneling microscopy reveals elliptically shaped AA domains, while
spectroscopy shows strong electronic correlation in the form of narrow bands
with split Van Hove singularities near the Fermi level. A continuum model with
electrostatic interactions reproduces these features under the specific
twist-strain combination that minimizes elastic energy. This work demonstrates
that the combination of twist and strain, or twistraintronics, enables the
realization of highly correlated electronic states in moire heterostructures
with geometries that were previously inaccessible.

### Superexchanges and Charge Transfer in the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ Thin Films

- **Authors**: Yuxun Zhong, Wéi Wú, Dao-Xin Yao
- **Categories**: cond-mat.supr-con
- **TL;DR**: 研究发现La3Ni2O7薄膜中的反铁磁超交换耦合比高压块体材料显著减弱，特别是层间耦合减少约27%，而层内耦合基本不变。薄膜的双轴压缩导致电荷转移能隙减小，并揭示了载流子掺杂的显著粒子-空穴不对称性。

The recent discovery of superconductivity with $T_c$ above 40 K in
La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and (La,Pr)$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films at ambient pressure
marks a new era in the field of the nickelate superconductors. Motivated by the
recent experimental reports, we study an 11-band Hubbard model with
tight-binding parameters derived from \textit{ab initio} calculations of
La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films, by using large scale determinant quantum Monte
Carlo and cellular dynamical mean-field theory approaches. Our results
demonstrate that the major antiferromagnetic superexchange couplings in
thin-film La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ can be significantly weaker than in the bulk at
29.5 Gpa. The out-of-plane antiferromagnetic correlation between
Ni$-d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbitals is significantly reduced by about 27% in film,
whereas, the in-plane magnetic correlations remain largely unchanged. We
estimate the antiferromagnetic coupling constants, $J_{\parallel}$ and
$J_{\perp}$ by using perturbation theory. Regarding charge transfer, we find
that biaxial compression in the thin films results in reduced charge-transfer
gap compared to the bulk material. We determine the distribution of doped holes
and electrons among the in-plane (Ni$-d_{x^2-y^2}$ and O$-p_x/p_y$) orbitals
and the out-of-plane (Ni$-d_{3z^2-r^2}$ and O$-p_z$) orbitals. A significant
particle-hole asymmetry regarding carrier doping is revealed. Our results
provide a foundation for subsequent studies of the low-energy $t-J$ model of
La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films, and ofer key insights into the understanding of
physical differences between the film and bulk bilayer nickelate
high-temperature superconductors.

### Non-resonant SABRE provides a new and versatile hyperpolarization approach for magnetic resonance

- **Categories**: physics.chem-ph
- **TL;DR**: 本文提出了一种新的SABRE超极化策略，能够在无磁场控制条件下产生与磁场无关的自旋有序，显著扩展了SABRE技术的通用性和效率。

Hyperpolarization approaches in magnetic resonance overcome the sensitivity
limitations imposed by thermal magnetization and play an important role in a
very wide range of modern applications. One of the newer strategies, variants
of what is generically called SABRE, uses para-hydrogen to form hydrides on
transition metal catalysts, followed by reversible exchange to polarize target
molecules in solution, and has produced large signal enhancements (approx.
10^4) on hundreds of different molecules, cheaply and rapidly. Most commonly,
the sample is kept in a constant field, matched to make the hydride scalar
coupling comparable to the frequency difference between hydride protons and
target protons (approx. 6.5 mT) or hydride protons and target heteronuclei
(approx. 0.5 {\mu}T). Here we demonstrate a different strategy, applicable to a
wide range of target molecules, that produces field-independent spin order in
the target molecules that is efficiently converted to magnetization. The
observed signal is even independent of field direction, hence significant
polarization can be achieved in a sample on a lab bench with no field control
at all. We show this signal arises from creation of two-spin order in the
target molecules, and discuss multiple ways this strategy should expand SABRE
generality and efficiency. We also show that, in many cases, the standard
assumption in low-field SABRE of a starting state with only singlet
polarization leads to incorrect results.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究在InAsSb-Al混合纳米交叉结构中实现了多终端约瑟夫森结，通过分子束外延生长和As辅助合并机制形成，并研究了其超导输运特性。

This work presents multiterminal Josephson junctions in hybrid
semiconductor-superconductor InAsSb-Al nanocrosses. Hybrid nanocrosses are
grown using molecular beam epitaxy and are formed through As-assisted merging
of oppositely directed InAsSb nanowires. We explain this complex ternary
merging mechanism using a temperature-dependent phase diagram and investigate
the detailed crystal structure with atomic-resolution imaging. The hybrid
nanoscrosses enabled the fabrication of multiterminal Josephson junction
devices, which were characterized at low temperatures. The supercurrent through
each terminal combination was measured as a function of the density in the
junction and the relative phase of the terminals, which was controlled by an
external magnetic field.

### Fast and Scalable Evaluation of Unbiased Atomic Forces in ab initio Variational Monte Carlo via the Lagrangian Technique

- **TL;DR**: 本文提出了一种改进的变分蒙特卡洛力计算方法，通过单次耦合扰动Kohn-Sham计算替代3N次DFT计算，显著提高了计算效率和可扩展性，同时提高了力的准确性和与势能面的一致性。

Ab initio quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods are state-of-the-art electronic
structure calculations based on highly parallelizable stochastic frameworks for
accurate solutions of the many-body Schr\"{o}dinger equation, suitable for
modern many-core supercomputer architectures. Despite its potential, one of the
major drawbacks that still hinders QMC applications, especially when targeting
dynamical properties of large systems or large amounts of configurations, is
the lack of an affordable method to compute atomic forces that are consistent
with the corresponding potential energy surfaces (PESs), also known as unbiased
atomic forces. Recently, one of the authors in the present paper proposed a way
to obtain unbiased forces with the Jastrow-correlated Slater determinant
ansatz, where the determinant part is frozen to the values obtained by a
mean-field method, such as DFT. However, the proposed method has a significant
drawback for its applications: for a system with $N$ nuclei, one requires $3N$
additional DFT calculations to get unbiased forces, which is not negligible as
the system size increases. This paper presents a way to replace the $3N$ DFT
calculations with a single coupled-perturbed Kohn-Sham calculation, following
the so-called Lagrangian technique established in quantum chemistry. This
improves the computational cost and scalability of the method. We also
demonstrate that the developed unbiased VMC force calculation improves not only
the consistency with PESs, but also its accuracy, by investigating three
molecules from the rMD17 benchmark set, and comparing the corrected VMC forces
with those obtained by the Coupled-Cluster Singles and Doubles with
perturbative Triples [CCSD(T)] calculations. We found that the bare VMC forces
are significantly biased from the CCSD(T) ones, while the unbiased ones give
values much closer to those of the CCSD(T) ones.

### Application of boundary functionals of the theory of random processes to aerosol coagulation

- **TL;DR**: 应用随机过程理论的边界泛函来描述气溶胶在凝聚过程中的行为，通过首次通过时间分析气溶胶浓度的时间依赖性，获得了气溶胶浓度达到特定值的概率和平均浓度表达式。

A new approach to describing aerosol behavior is proposed. Boundary
functionals of random process theory are applied to describe the behavior of
aerosol concentrations during coagulation. It is shown that considering the
first-passage time of a given aerosol concentration level corresponds to
experimental results for the time dependence of aerosol concentration.
Probabilities for aerosol concentrations to attain specific values are
obtained, as well as expressions for average aerosol concentrations.

### Electrostatics-induced breakdown of the integer quantum Hall effect in cavity QED

- **TL;DR**: 分析二维电子气在金属裂环谐振器中整数量子霍尔效应崩溃的机制，发现静电边界效应可能导致非手性边缘通道的形成，从而解释实验现象。

We analyze the recently observed breakdown of the integer quantum Hall effect
in a two-dimensional electron gas embedded in a metallic split-ring resonator.
By accounting for both the quantized vacuum field and electrostatic boundary
modifications, we identify a mechanism that could potentially explain this
breakdown in terms of non-chiral edge channels arising from electrostatic
boundary effects. For experimentally relevant geometries, a minimal
single-electron model of this mechanism predicts characteristic signatures and
energy scales consistent with those observed in experiments. These predictions
can be directly tested against alternative, purely vacuum-induced explanations
to shed further light on the origin of this puzzling phenomenon.

### Many-body wave function and edge magnetization of an open $p+is$ superconducting chain

- **Categories**: cond-mat.supr-con
- **TL;DR**: 构建了一维p+is配对超导体在开放边界条件下的精确BCS基态波函数，并计算了边缘自旋磁化强度。

Although BCS wave function for superconductors under periodic boundary
conditions are well-established, obtaining an explicit form of the many-body
BCS wave function under open boundary condition is usually a nontrivial
problem. In this work, we construct the exact BCS ground state wave function of
a one-dimensional spin-1/2 superconductor with $p+ is$ pairing symmetry under
open boundary conditions for special sets of parameters. The spin magnetization
on the edges are calculated explicitly using the obtained wave function.
Approximate expression of the wave function is also discussed based on
degenerate perturbation theory when the $s$-wave component is much smaller than
the $p$-wave one, which provides more intuitive understanding for the system.
Our work is useful for obtaining deeper understandings of open $p+ is$
superconducting chains on a wave function level.

### Wetting Transparency of Graphene: Amacroscopic Window but Nanoscopic Mirror

Graphene supported on a substrate in contact with water underpins a wide
range of processes and technologies, yet its wettability remains controversial.
Understanding how substrate charges and graphene's properties influence water
organization is crucial. Here, we combine heterodyne-detected sum-frequency
generation (HD-SFG) spectroscopy with molecular dynamics simulations to
investigate CaF$_2$-supported graphene interfaces in contact with water. We
find that interfacial water orientation is primarily governed by the CaF$_2$
substrate's pH-dependent local electrostatics, confirming graphene's
macroscopic wetting transparency. However, at the nanoscale, graphene's
polarizability induces a local inversion of water's molecular orientation above
substrate charges, revealing subtle structural ordering that is masked in
spatially averaged measurements. These insights elucidate the molecular origins
of graphene's wetting behavior and suggest new avenues to tailor interfacial
phenomena in graphene-based nanofluidic, sensing, and energy applications.

### Photo-induced switching of magnetisation in the epsilon-near-zero regime

- **TL;DR**: 该研究发现，在钴掺杂钇铁石榴石薄膜中，中红外脉冲可将迷宫状磁畴转变为稳定的平行条纹，这主要源于各向异性的部分淬灭。令人意外的是，这种磁化切换过程在介电常数近零点处光谱最强，而非在吸收光能最大处。

The possibility of controlling spins using ultrashort light and strain pulses
has triggered intense discussions about the mechanisms responsible for magnetic
re-ordering. All-optical magnetisation switching can be achieved through
ultrafast heat-driven demagnetisation or transient modifications of magnetic
anisotropy. During the phononic switching of magnetic dielectrics, however,
mid-infrared optical excitations can modify the crystal environment via both
the thermal quenching of anisotropy and the generation of strain respectively,
with the relative distinction between these thermal and non-thermal processes
remaining an open question. Here, we examine the effect of mid-infrared pulses
tuned to the frequency of optical phonon resonances on the labyrinthine domain
structure of a cobalt-doped yttrium iron garnet film. We find that the
labyrinthine domains are transformed into stable parallel stripes, and
quantitative micromagnetic calculations demonstrate this stems predominantly
from a partial quenching of the anisotropy. Contrary to conventional wisdom,
however, we find that this heat-facilitated process of magnetisation switching
is spectrally strongest not at the maximum of absorbed optical energy but
rather at the epsilon-near-zero points. Our results reveal that the
epsilon-near-zero condition provides an alternative pathway for laser-driven
control of magnetisation, even when the underlying mechanism is primarily
thermal.

### Fine-Tuning Unifies Foundational Machine-learned Interatomic Potential Architectures at ab initio Accuracy

- **TL;DR**: 微调可将基础机器学习原子间势（MLIP）转化为在多种架构下实现一致、接近从头计算精度的模型，显著提升力和能量的预测准确性。

This work demonstrates that fine-tuning transforms foundational
machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) to achieve consistent, near-ab
initio accuracy across diverse architectures. Benchmarking five leading MLIP
frameworks (MACE, GRACE, SevenNet, MatterSim, and ORB) across seven chemically
diverse compounds reveals that fine-tuning universally enhances force
predictions by factors of 5-15 and improves energy accuracy by 2-4 orders of
magnitude. The investigated models span both equivariant and invariant, as well
as conservative and non-conservative, architectures. While general-purpose
foundation models are robust, they exhibit architecture-dependent deviations
from ab initio reference data; fine-tuning eliminates these discrepancies,
enabling quantitatively accurate predictions of atomistic and structural
properties. Using datasets constructed from equidistantly sampled frames of
short ab initio molecular dynamics trajectories, fine-tuning reduces force
errors by an order of magnitude and harmonizes performance across all
architectures. These findings establish fine-tuning as a universal route to
achieving system-specific predictive accuracy while preserving the
computational efficiency of MLIPs. To promote widespread adoption, we introduce
the aMACEing Toolkit, which provides a unified and reproducible interface for
fine-tuning workflows across multiple MLIP frameworks.

### Coarse-graining nonequilibrium diffusions with Markov chains

We investigate nonequilibrium steady-state dynamics in both continuous- and
discrete-state stochastic processes. Our analysis focuses on planar diffusion
dynamics and their coarse-grained approximations by discrete-state Markov
chains. Using finite-volume approximations, we derive an approximate master
equation directly from the underlying diffusion and show that this
discretisation preserves key features of the nonequilibrium steady-state. In
particular, we show that the entropy production rate of the approximation
converges as the number of discrete states goes to the limit. These results are
illustrated with analytically solvable diffusions and numerical experiments on
nonlinear processes, demonstrating how this approach can be used to explore the
dependence of entropy production rate on model parameters. Finally, we address
the problem of inferring discrete-state Markov models from continuous
stochastic trajectories. We show that discrete-state models significantly
underestimate the true entropy production rate. However, we also show that they
can provide tests to determine if a stationary planar diffusion is out of
equilibrium. This property is illustrated with both simulated data and
empirical trajectories from schooling fish.

### Direct Visualization of the Magnetic Monopole Field in a 3D Artificial Spin Ice

Magnetic monopoles, long hypothesised as fundamental particles carrying
isolated magnetic charge, emerge in spin-ice systems as fractionalised
excitations governed by the ice rule. Yet their three-dimensional field
structure has never been directly visualised. Here, we use two-photon
lithography and processing to fabricate a fully three-dimensional artificial
spin-ice lattice with diamond-bond geometry. We then use scanning
nitrogen-vacancy magnetometry to directly measure the stray magnetic fields of
both charge-neutral and monopole vertices. We find that ice-rule vertices
produce antivortex textures directly above their vertices, stabilised by the
local frustrated two-in/two out ordering principle. Direct imaging of the
monopole stray field shows a highly divergent profile. By correlating
experiment with micromagnetic simulations and performing a multipole expansion
of the reconstructed magnetisation, we reveal that monopoles in 3DASI are
non-trivial micromagnetic entities, carrying both magnetic charge and an
intrinsic moment, giving rise to anisotropic interactions that are dependent
upon the quasiparticles position on the lattice. Results suggest that as
monopoles separate under an applied field, the dipolar contribution to their
interaction reorients relative to the underlying Coulombic field, revealing
that monopole coupling is tunable through geometry, being set by the local
vertex topology. These findings establish 3DASI as a programmable magnetic
metamaterial in which nanoscale geometry governs the energetics and dynamics of
emergent magnetic charges.

We study the interplay between altermagnetism and unconventional
superconductivity for the case of two-dimensional square- and
triangular-lattice systems. Our approach is based on an effective single
particle Hamiltonian which mimics the alternating spin splitting characteristic
for the $d$-$wave$ and $i$-$wave$ altermagnetic state. By supplementing the
model with intersite pairing term we characterize the principal features of the
coexistent altermagnetic-superconducting state as well as the possibility of
inducing the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) phase. Our calculations
show that the subtle interplay between the symmetries of the superconducting
and altermagnetic order parameters as well as the shape/size of the Fermi
surface lead to various types of anisotropic behaviors of the resultant
non-zero momentum pairing, which has not been possible in the originally
proposed FFLO state. Moreover, in the considered systems additional pairing
symmetries appear leading to an exotic multi-component order parameter with
singlet-triplet mixing. To interpret the obtained data we analyze the Cooper
pair density in the momentum space and the corresponding Fermi wave vector
mismatch resulting from the altermagnetic spin splitting. We discuss our result
in the context of possible applications like, e.g., the superconducting diode.

### Complex-Energy Second-Order Approximate Coupled-Cluster Methods for Electronic Resonances

- **TL;DR**: 本文结合了复吸收势和复基函数技术与RI-CC2方法，开发了新的复能量RI-CC2方法，用于准确计算电子共振态（特别是临时阴离子）的负电子亲和能和衰变宽度。

Electronic resonances are metastable states with finite lifetimes,
encountered in processes such as photodetachment, electron transmission, and
Auger decay. Resonances appear in Hermitian quantum mechanics as increased
density of states in the continuum rather than as discrete energy levels. To
describe resonances accurately, including their coupling to the continuum,
methods based on non-Hermitian quantum mechanics can be used, which yield
complex energies. In this work, we combine the complex absorbing potential
(CAP) and complex basis functions (CBF) techniques with the RI-CC2 method. The
second-order coupled cluster method (CC2) offers a good balance between
accuracy and computational cost by approximating equation-of-motion
coupled-cluster singles and doubles (EOM-CCSD) theory, making it suitable for
studying of electronic resonances in larger molecules. The
resolution-of-the-identity (RI) approximation further reduces computational
demands without significant loss in accuracy. We investigate the numerical
performance of the new complex-energy RI-CC2 methods focusing on temporary
anions. Negative electron affinities and decay widths can be computed using the
electron-attachment (EA) variant of RI-CC2. For N2, C2H4, CH2O, and HCOOH,
EA-CC2 yields affinities about 0.1-0.2 eV smaller than EOM-EA-CCSD, while
deviations reach 0.5 eV for larger anions such as uracil, naphthalene,
cyanonaphthalene, and pyrene. As a result of these trends, EA-CC2 is in better
agreement with experiment for the negative electron affinities than EOM-EA-CCSD
for all studied anions. The corresponding resonance widths from EA-CC2
calculations are about 0.05-0.25 eV smaller compared to EOM-EA-CCSD.
Semi-empirical spin-scaling increases electron affinities by 0.3-0.5 eV and
broadens resonance widths, improving the agreement with EOM-EA-CCSD but
worsening the agreement with experiment.

### Mixed-Valent Ce Disrupts Magnetic Ordering in CeFe$_2$Ga$_8$

- **TL;DR**: 该研究对混合价态化合物CeFe2Ga8进行了全面表征，发现其具有准一维结构和混合价态Ce3+/Ce4+，铁亚晶格为非磁性，在低温下没有磁有序，表现出短程磁有序但非自旋玻璃行为。

Mixed valency in intermetallics with lanthanide cations is well established
as a pathway to unusual charge transport, complex magnetism, and
superconductivity. In this work, we report a comprehensive study of the
structural, magnetic, electronic, and thermal properties of the mixed valent
compound CeFe$_2$Ga$_8$. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterize CeFe$_2$Ga$_8$ as a
quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) compound with mixed-valent Ce$^{3+}$ and Ce$^{4+}$
on a single crystallographic site. $^{57}$Fe M\"ossbauer spectroscopy indicates
that the Fe sublattice is nonmagnetic, in direct contrast with recent reports
of this compound. Low-temperature electrical resistivity and heat capacity
measurements show no evidence of magnetic ordering, and a modest Sommerfeld
coefficient ($\gamma$) of 22.7 mJ/mol$\cdot$K$^2$ make extensive Kondo
hybridization unlikely. DC and AC magnetic susceptibility data suggest
short-range magnetic order at $\sim$5.2 and 7.6 K with no frequency dependence,
ruling out canonical spin-glass behavior in this compound. Additionally, the
magnetic susceptibility data does not contain any broad features that are
typically associated with an intermediate valence state in Ce, suggesting
either high-temperature valence fluctuation or a different mechanism of mixed
valency. This work demonstrates that mixed-valent Ce inhibits magnetic ordering
in CeFe$_2$Ga$_8$ and provides a broader picture for how to analyze short-range
spin interactions in Q1D intermetallics.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究通过综合实验和理论计算，发现KSrFe₂(PO₄)₃的磁性基态既不是传统的三维长程有序，也不是纯无隙自旋液体，而是自旋冻结与持续动力学共存的复杂磁态。

A comprehensive $^{31}$P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) study, combined
with thermodynamic measurements and first-principle band-structure
calculations, has been conducted to explore the ground state of the $S = 5/2$
double trillium lattice antiferromagnet KSrFe$_2$(PO$_4$)$_3$. Our experimental
results indicate that the magnetic ground state is neither a conventional
three-dimensional (3D) long-range order (LRO) nor a pure gapless spin-liquid
state, as conjectured previously [Boya et al., APL Mater. 10, 101103 (2022)].
Specifically, the observation of a nearly field-independent NMR linewidth below
$T^{*}$ = (3.5 $\pm$ 0.4) K, and a significant enhancement of spin-spin
relaxation rate $1/T_2$ below $2T^{*}$ (where $T^{*}$ is the characteristic
temperature identified from the magnetic susceptibility), indicate a complex
magnetic ground state where spin freezing coexists with persistent dynamics.
Furthermore, we argue that the lack of magnetic LRO and the persistence of
strong magnetic fluctuations in KSrFe$_2$(PO$_4$)$_3$ are unlikely to originate
from intersite K/Sr disorder, rather arise due to intrinsic magnetic
frustration. Our findings position KSrFe$_2$(PO$_4$)$_3$ into a broader family
of geometrically frustrated magnets characterized by coexisting spin freezing
and pronounced antiferromagnetic fluctuations, marking it as a promising
platform for investigating exotic phenomena in 3D frustrated magnets.

### Point Defects Limited Carrier Mobility in Janus MoSSe monolayer

- **TL;DR**: 本文通过第一性原理计算研究了Janus MoSSe中常见缺陷对电子输运的影响，定义了饱和缺陷浓度(C_sat)作为衡量器件容忍缺陷能力的指标，发现硒空位是最敏感的缺陷类型。

Point defects, often formed during the growth of Janus MoSSe, act as built-in
scatterers and affect carrier transport in electronic devices based on Janus
MoSSe. In this study, we employ first-principles calculations to investigate
the impact of common defects, such as sulfur vacancies, selenium vacancies, and
chalcogen substitutions, on electron transport, and compare their influence
with that of mobility limited by phonons. Here, we define the saturation defect
concentration ($C_{\mathrm{sat}}$) as the highest defect density that still
allows the total mobility to remain within 90\% of the phonon-limited value,
providing a direct measure of how many defects a device can tolerate. Based on
$C_{\mathrm{sat}}$, we find a clear ranking of defect impact: selenium
substituting for sulfur is relatively tolerant, with
$C_{\mathrm{sat}}\approx2.07\times10^{-4}$, while selenium vacancies are the
most sensitive, with $C_{\mathrm{sat}}\approx3.65\times10^{-5}$. Our
$C_{\mathrm{sat}}$ benchmarks and defect hierarchy provide quantitative,
materials-specific design rules that can guide the fabrication of high-mobility
field-effect transistors, electronic devices, and sensors based on Janus MoSSe.

We construct exact strong zero mode operators (ESZM) in integrable quantum
circuits and the spin-1/2 XXZ chain for general open boundary conditions, which
break the bulk U(1) symmetry of the time evolution operators. We show that the
ESZM is localized around one of the boundaries induces infinite boundary
coherence times. Finally we prove that the ESZM becomes spatially non-local
under the map that relates the spin-1/2 XXZ chain to the asymmetric simple
exclusion process, which suggests that it does not play a significant role in
the dynamics of the latter.

### In-Plane Field induced Quantized Longitudinal Conductivity in Magnetic Topological Insulators

- **TL;DR**: 在强面内磁场下，三层磁性拓扑绝缘体中发现了面内量子化态，其特征是纵向电导率量子化为e²/h。该态出现在通过磁场角度和方向调谐的量子反常霍尔相之间的量子临界点处，将能隙闭合行为与量子化临界性直接联系起来。

We report the discovery of an in plane quantization (IPQ) state in trilayer
magnetic topological insulators, characterized by a quantized longitudinal
conductivity of e2/h under strong in-plane magnetic fields. This state emerges
at a quantum critical point separating quantum anomalous Hall phases tuned by
field angle and orientation, directly linking gap-closing behavior to quantized
criticality. Temperature and gate dependent transport measurements, supported
by a self consistent approximation model, reveal that electron hole puddles
dominate charge transport in this regime, highlighting the essential role of
impurity disorder in stabilizing quantized critical transport. These findings
establish a tunable experimental framework that connects gap-closing physics
with universal conductivity, offering both microscopic insight into critical
transport in magnetic topological insulators and a robust platform for probing
quantum criticality in topological systems.

### Anomalous Nodal Gap in a Doped Spin-1/2 Antiferromagnetic Mott Insulator

- **TL;DR**: 该研究通过角分辨光电子能谱分析电子掺杂的Sr₂IrO₄，发现其表现出与铜氧化物超导体相似的掺杂演化行为，包括反铁磁间隙、异常节点间隙的形成，以及最终演变为d波超导间隙的点节点。

Many emergent phenomena appear in doped Mott insulators near the
insulator-to-metal transition. In high-temperature cuprate superconductors,
superconductivity arises when antiferromagnetic (AFM) order is gradually
suppressed by carrier doping, and a $\textit{d}$-wave superconducting gap forms
when an enigmatic nodal gap evolves into a point node. Here, we examine
electron-doped Sr$_{2}$IrO$_{4}$, the 5$\textit{d}$-electron counterpart of
cuprates, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. At low doping
levels, we observe the formation of electronic states near the Fermi level,
accompanied by a gap at the AFM zone boundary, mimicking the AFM gap in
electron-doped cuprates. With increasing doping, a distinct gap emerges along
the (0,0)-($\pi$,$\pi$) nodal direction, paralleling that observed in
hole-doped cuprates. This anomalous nodal gap persists after the collapse of
the AFM gap and gradually decreases with further doping. It eventually vanishes
into a point node of the reported $\textit{d}$-wave gap. These observations
replicate the characteristic features in both electron- and hole-doped
cuprates, indicating a unified route toward nodal metallicity in doped spin-1/2
AFM Mott insulators.

Metal-insulator transitions and superconductivity in rutile-structured oxides
hold promise for advanced electronic applications, yet their thin film
synthesis is severely hindered by limited substrate options. Here, we present
three single- crystalline substrates, BeAl2O4, Mg2SiO4, and Al2SiO4(F,OH)2,
prepared via optimized thermal and chemical treatments to achieve atomically
smooth surfaces suitable for epitaxial growth. Atomic force microscopy confirms
atomic step-and-terrace surface morphologies, and oxide molecular-beam epitaxy
growth on these substrates demonstrates successful heteroepitaxy of rutile
TiO2, VO2, NbO2, and RuO2 films. Among these unconventional substrates, BeAl2O4
exhibits exceptional thermal and chemical stability, making it a versatile
substrate candidate. These findings introduce new substrate platforms that
facilitate strain engineering and exploration of rutile oxide thin films,
potentially advancing the study of their strain-dependent physical properties.

### Anisotropy of linear magnetoresistance in Kagome metal ZrV$_6$Sn$_6$

The Kagome lattice has attracted extensive attention due to the diverse
magnetic properties and non-trivial electronic states generated by its unique
atomic arrangement, which provides an excellent system for exploring
macroscopic quantum behavior. Here, we report the anomalous transport
properties in 166-type Kagome metal ZrV$_6$Sn$_6$ single crystals. The
quadratic and linear magnetoresistance (LMR) can be observed depending on the
directions of the field and the current. Integrating Hall resistivity and
quantum oscillation measurements, we found that the LMR could match well with
the Abrikosov model. However, this model encounters difficulties in explaining
the anisotropy of the magnetoresistance. To solve the issue, we extrapolate the
Abrikosov model to the case of two-dimensional linear dispersion. It was found
that when the field is parallel to the linear dependence momentum, the
quantized energy is $\epsilon_n^{\pm}$ = $\pm v\sqrt{p^2+2eHn/c}$, resulting in
LMR. By contrast, when it is parallel to the non-linear dependence momentum,
the energy is $\epsilon_n^{\pm}$ = $\pm v\sqrt{2eHn/c}$, without yielding LMR.
Through the combination of experiment and theory, the modified Abrikosov model
could interpret the macroscopic quantum transport in ZrV$_6$Sn$_6$ crystal. The
present research provides a new perspective for understanding the LMR behavior.

We provide a systematic formula, in terms of integer partitions, that
generates perturbation theory explicitly at an arbitrary order. Our approach
naturally includes an infinite number of perturbations and uses a single matrix
equation that contains the information for both the eigenvalue and eigenvector
corrections. The formula reduces to the standard case of one perturbation in
the appropriate limit. This formulation streamlines the derivations that are
traditionally tedious in perturbation theory, facilitating high-order
calculations.

### Ultimate photon entanglement in biexciton cascade

The polarization entanglement of photons emitted by semiconductor quantum
dots is unavoidably limited by the spin fluctuations of the host lattice
nuclei. To overcome this limitation, we develop a theory of entangled photon
pair generation by a symmetric colloidal quantum dot mediated by a triplet
exciton. We derive general analytical expressions for the concurrence as a
function of the hyperfine interaction strength and show that it is
intrinsically higher than that in conventional doublet-exciton systems such as
self-assembled quantum dots. The concurrence sensitively depends on the shape
anisotropy and the strain applied to a nanocrystal. In particular, we uncover a
possibility of completely suppressing the detrimental effect of the hyperfine
interaction due to the interplay between nanocrystal anisotropy and
electron-hole exchange interaction. We argue that this represents the ultimate
limit for the generation of entangled photon pairs by semiconductor quantum
dots.

### Fuzzy Neural Network Performance and Interpretability of Quantum Wavefunction Probability Predictions

Predicting quantum wavefunction probability distributions is crucial for
computational chemistry and materials science, yet machine learning (ML) models
often face a trade-off between accuracy and interpretability. This study
compares Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference
Systems (ANFIS) in modeling quantum probability distributions for the H$_{2}^+$
ion, leveraging data generated via Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs).
While ANN achieved superior accuracy (R$^2$ = 0.99 vs ANFIS's 0.95 with
Gaussian membership functions), it required over 50x more parameters (2,305 vs
39-45). ANFIS, however, provided unique interpretability: its Gaussian
membership functions encoded spatial electron localization near proton
positions ($\mu = 1.2 A$), mirroring Born probability densities, while fuzzy
rules reflected quantum superposition principles. Rules prioritizing the
internuclear direction revealed the system's 1D symmetry, aligning with Linear
Combination of Atomic Orbitals theory--a novel data-driven perspective on
orbital hybridization. Membership function variances ($\sigma$) further
quantified electron delocalization trends, and peak prediction errors
highlighted unresolved quantum cusps. The choice of functions critically
impacted performance: Gaussian/Generalized Bell outperformed Sigmoid, with
errors improving as training data increased, showing scalability. This study
underscores the context-dependent value of ML: ANN for precision and ANFIS for
interpretable, parameter-efficient approximations that link inputs to physical
behavior. These findings advocate hybrid approaches in quantum simulations,
balancing accuracy with explainability to accelerate discovery. Future work
should extend ANFIS to multi-electron systems and integrate domain-specific
constraints (e.g., kinetic energy terms), bridging data-driven models and
fundamental physics.

Moir\'e superlattices have emerged as a versatile platform for exploring a
wide range of ex- otic quantum phenomena. Unlike angstrom-scale materials, the
moir\'e length-scale system contains a large number of atoms, and its
electronic structure is significantly modulated by the lattice relaxation.
These features pose a huge theoretical challenge. Among the available
theoretical approaches, tight-binding (TB) methods are widely employed to
predict the electronic, transport, and optical properties of systems such as
twisted graphene, twisted transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), and related
moir\'e materials. In this review, we pro- vide a comprehensive overview of
atomistic TB Hamiltonians and the numerical techniques commonly used to model
graphene-based, TMD-based and hBN-based moir\'e superlattices. We also discuss
the connection between atomistic TB descriptions and effective low-energy
continuum models. Two examples of different moir\'e materials and geometries
are provided to emphasize the advantages of the TB methods. This review is
intended to serve as a theoretical and practical guide for those seeking to
apply TB methods to the study of various properties of moir\'e superlattices.

We analyze powder-averaged inelastic neutron scattering and magnetization
data for the distorted honeycomb compound Cu$_5$SbO$_6$ using a first-order
dimer expansion calculation and quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We show that,
in contrast to the previously proposed honeycomb lattice model, Cu$_5$SbO$_6$
accommodates interacting dimerized spin chains with alternating
ferromagnetic-antiferromagnetic couplings along the chain. Moreover, unlike the
typical couplings observed in other Cu$^{2+}$-based distorted honeycomb
magnets, the spin chains in Cu$_5$SbO$_6$ primarily couple through an
antiferromagnetic coupling $J_4$ that arises between the honeycomb layers,
rather than the expected interchain $J_3$ coupling in the layers. This finding
reveals a different magnetic coupling scheme, $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_4$, for
Cu$_5$SbO$_6$. In addition, utilizing x-ray spectroscopy and transmission
electron microscopy, we also refine the crystal structure and stacking-fault
model of the compound.

We compute and analyze the dependence of excitonic second- and third-harmonic
generation (SHG/THG) as a function of the optical excitation intensity in the
presence of static electric fields by solving the semiconductor Bloch
equations. Our simulations are performed for excitation of the strongly bound
intralayer exciton of an inversion-symmetric homobilayer of MoS2 with in-plane
electric fields. We demonstrate that for resonant excitation at the 1s
K-exciton the SHG and the THG show complex dependencies on both the strength of
the static field and the peak amplitude of the optical pulse. For sufficiently
intense optical excitation, the THG increases and the SHG increases
superlinearly with the amplitude of the static field as long as exciton
ionization is not yet dominating. Microscopic simulations demonstrate that
these dependencies arise from an interplay between several effects including
static and transient Stark shifts, exciton ionization, Wannier-Stark
localization, off-resonant Rabi oscillations, and a modified interference
between optical nonlinearities induced by the intraband acceleration. Our
findings offer several new possibilities for controlling the strong-field
dynamics of systems with strongly bound excitons.

This review presents the covalent chemistry of carbon within the spin-radical
concept of electron interaction. Using the language of valence bond
trimodality, the regions of classical spinless covalence and its spin
counterpart are defined. Carbon is the only element exhibiting spin covalent
chemistry. Classical covalent chemistry of carbon concerns molecular substances
whose valence bond structure includes segregate or chained single sp3C-C bonds.
Substances with double sp2C-C and triple sp1C-C bonds are the subject of spin
covalent chemistry of carbon. The mathematical apparatus of spin covalence
forms the basis of algorithms governing the chemical modification of carbon
substances, polymerization processes, and catalysis involving them, making it
possible to supplement the empirical spin covalent chemistry of carbon with its
virtual analog.

- **TL;DR**: 二维异质结构中存在固有的断裂非互易性，表现为裂纹阻力的方向不对称性，这种特性由晶格失配界面的非对称预应变状态控制。

We reveal intrinsic fracture nonreciprocity, manifesting as directional
asymmetry in crack resistance, in two-dimensional heterostructures engineered
through lattice-mismatched interfaces. Density-functional theory combined with
machine-learning molecular dynamics show that intrinsic lattice mismatch
between bonded component crystals imprints asymmetric prestrain states at crack
tips, governing bond-breaking thresholds through charge redistribution. The
failure criterion obeys a universal exponential scaling law between normalized
charge density and bond strain, insensitive to bonding chemistry and local
atomic environment. The magnitude of nonreciprocity scales systematically with
lattice mismatch, reaching 49% at 10% mismatch. Validation across hexagonal,
square, rectangular, and oblique two-dimensional lattices confirms
universality, establishing interface strain engineering as a general design
principle that bridges electronic structure to nanoscale failure, enabling
rational design of damage-tolerant nanostructures.

Quasiparticle hybridization remains a major challenge to realizing and
controlling exotic states of matter in existing quantum simulation platforms.
We report the absence of hybridization for compact localized states (CLS)
emerging in the chiral spin liquid described by the Yao-Kivelson model. The CLS
form due to destructive quantum interference at fine-tuned coupling constants
and populate perfectly flat quasiparticle bands on an effective kagome lattice.
Using a formalism for general Majorana-hopping Hamiltonians, we derive exact
expressions for CLS for various flux configurations and both for the
topological and trivial phases of the model. In addition to finite-energy
matter fermions with characteristic spin-spin correlations, we construct
compact localized Majorana zero modes attached to $\pi$-flux excitations, which
enable non-Abelian braiding of Ising anyons with minimal separation. Our
results inform the quantum simulation of topologically ordered states of matter
and open avenues for exploring flat-band physics in quantum spin liquids.

### Altermagnetic Spin Precession and Spin Transistor

Altermagnets hold great potential for spintronic applications, yet their
intrinsic spin dynamics and associated transport properties remain largely
unexplored. Here, we investigate spin-resolved quantum transport in a
multi-terminal setup based on a $d$-wave altermagnet. It is found that the
altermagnetic spin splitting in momentum space induces an interesting spin
precession in real space, giving rise to characteristic spin patterns. This
altermagnetic spin precession manifests as a spatial modulation of the Hall
voltage, whose oscillation period provides a direct measure of the
spin-splitting strength. When the altermagnetism is electrically tunable, the
proposed setup functions as a prototype for a highly efficient spin transistor.
The key physical effects are shown to be robust against dephasing and
crystalline warping. Our work not only identifies a fingerprint signature of
altermagnets, offering a direct probe of the altermagnetic spin splitting, but
also represents an important step toward bridging their fundamental physics
with practical spintronic applications.

### Disorder-broadened topological Hall phase and anomalous Hall scaling in FeGe

Magnetic skyrmions are topologically protected spin textures that are
promising candidates for low-power spintronic memory and logic devices.
Realizing skyrmion-based devices requires an understanding of how structural
disorder affects their stability and transport properties. This study uses
Ne$^{+}$ ion irradiation at fluences from $10^{11}$ to $10^{14}$ ions-cm$^{-2}$
to systematically vary defect densities in 80 nm epitaxial FeGe films and
quantify the resulting modifications to magnetic phase boundaries and
electronic scattering. Temperature- and field-dependent Hall measurements
reveal that increasing disorder progressively extends the topological Hall
signal from a narrow window near 200\~K in pristine films down to 4\~K at the
highest fluence, with peak amplitude more than doubling. Simultaneously, the
anomalous Hall effect transitions from quadratic Berry curvature scaling to
linear skew scattering behavior, with the skew coefficient increasing
threefold. These results establish quantitative correlations between defect
concentration, skyrmion phase space, and transport mechanisms in a chiral
magnet. It demonstrates that ion-beam modification provides systematic control
over both topological texture stability and electrical detectability.

We investigate quantum fluctuation effects arising from the Heisenberg
uncertainty principle governing angular momentum operators in the full
dynamical evolution of disentanglement-entanglement-disentanglement between
itinerant electrons and localized magnetic moments under the s-d exchange
interaction. Beyond the conventional deterministic spin-transfer torque, we
identify an intrinsic channel for the transfer of spin quantum fluctuations. By
extending the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation to include both quantum and
thermal stochastic fields, we reveal a temperature regime where quantum
fluctuations dominate spin dynamics. Furthermore, voltage-controlled magnetic
anisotropy can exponentially amplify these quantum fluctuation signals,
enabling their binary detection via tunneling magnetoresistance in magnetic
tunnel junctions. These results establish a microscopic framework for quantum
fluctuation-driven spin dynamics and provide a fundamental route toward
spin-based quantum true random number generation.

### Bayesian learning for accurate and robust biomolecular force fields

Molecular dynamics is a valuable tool to probe biological processes at the
atomistic level - a resolution often elusive to experiments. However, the
credibility of molecular models is limited by the accuracy of the underlying
force field, which is often parametrized relying on ad hoc assumptions. To
address this gap, we present a Bayesian framework for learning physically
grounded parameters directly from ab initio molecular dynamics data. By
representing both model parameters and data probabilistically, the framework
yields interpretable, statistically rigorous models in which uncertainty and
transferability emerge naturally from the learning process. This approach
provides a transparent, data-driven foundation for developing predictive
molecular models and enhances confidence in computational descriptions of
biophysical systems. We demonstrate the method using 18 biologically relevant
molecular fragments that capture key motifs in proteins, nucleic acids, and
lipids, and, as a proof of concept, apply it to calcium binding to troponin - a
central event in cardiac regulation.

We study broadband terahertz (THz) conductivity and ultrafast
photoconductivity spectra in lithographically fabricated multilayer epitaxial
graphene nanoribbons grown on C- face of 6H-SiC substrate. THz near-field
spectroscopy reveals local conductivity variations across nanoscale structural
inhomogeneities such as wrinkles and grain boundaries within the multilayer
graphene. Ultrabroadband THz far-field spectroscopy (0.15-16 THz) distinguishes
doped graphene layers near the substrate from quasi-neutral layers (QNLs)
further from the substrate. Temperature-dependent THz conductivity spectra are
dominated by intra-band transitions both in the doped and QNLs. Photoexcitation
then alters mainly the response of the QNLs: these exhibit a very high carrier
mobility and a large positive THz photoconductivity with picosecond lifetime.
The response of QNLs strongly depends on the carrier temperature $T_c$: the
scattering time drops by an order of magnitude down to ~10 fs upon an increase
of $T_c$ from 50 K to $T_c &gt;$ 1000 K, which is attributed to an enhanced
electron-electron and electron- phonon scattering and to an interaction of
electrons with mid-gap states.

We provide here a study of some competing ordering tendencies exhibited by
the exactly solvable 2D Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) model on a square lattice. To
this end, we investigate the interplay between superconductivity,
charge-density wave (CDW) and pair-density wave (PDW) orders as a function of
interaction, doping parameter, magnetic field, and uniaxial strain. As a
result, we confirm the intertwined nature of CDW and PDW fluctuating orders for
intermediate-to-strong couplings. We also verify that, while an applied
magnetic field favors the formation of a CDW and allows the subsequent
emergence of a PDW as a secondary order, strain effects favor unidirectional
PDW as a primary order over the subdominant appearance of a stripe-like CDW.
These results underscore the value of the HK model as an interesting platform
in order to investigate (via an exactly solvable framework) the emergence of
charge order and unconventional superconductivity in fermionic systems with
strong interactions. Finally, we briefly discuss an orbital generalization of
the HK model, which has been recently argued to be relevant to describe the
properties of realistic strongly correlated systems.

Melting is an everyday phase transition that is determined by thermodynamic
parameters like temperature and pressure. In contrast, ultrafast melting is
governed by the microscopic response to a rapid energy input and, thus, can
reveal the strength and dynamics of atomic bonds as well as the energy flow
rate to the lattice. Accurately describing these processes remains challenging
and requires detailed insights into transient states encountered. Here, we
present data from femtosecond electron diffraction measurements that capture
the structural evolution of copper during the ultrafast solid to liquid phase
transformations. At absorbed energy densities 2 to 4 times the melting
threshold, melting begins at the surface slightly below the nominal melting
point followed by rapid homogeneous melting throughout the volume. Molecular
dynamics simulations reproduce these observations and reveal a weak electron
lattice energy transfer rate for the given experimental conditions. Both
simulations and experiments show no indications of rapid lattice collapse when
its temperature surpasses proposed limits of superheating, providing evidence
that inherent dynamics limits the speed of disordering in ultrafast melting of
metals.

Exact results are presented for itinerant systems
  demonstrating that the nearest neighbor Coulomb
  repulsion (V) destroys the homogeneity in the high concentration regime, this
  property being not present in the low concentration domain. Since the effects
  of V often seems contradictory, and the number of phases in which it could
  appear is extremely large, this result underlines that the action of the
  nearest neighbor repulsion is not necessarily routed in the characteristics
  of phases on which it acts, but could be intimately related to V itself.
  The $V &gt; 0$ case usually means non-integrability, hence the deduced exact
  ground states are related to non-integrable systems, the technique being
  based on positive semidefinite operator properties.

The rapid expansion of materials science databases has driven machine
learning-based discovery while also posing challenges in data integration,
duplication, and interoperability. Robust standardization and de-duplication
methods are needed to address these issues and streamline materials research.
We present LeMat-Bulk, a unified dataset combining Materials Project, OQMD, and
Alexandria, encompassing over 5.3 million PBE-calculated materials and also
representing the largest collection of PBESol and SCAN functional calculations.
Our methodology standardizes calculations across databases that utilize
different parameters, effectively addressing redundancy and enhancing
cross-compatibility. To de-duplicate, we propose a hashing function which we
termed the Bonding Algorithm Weisfeiller-Lehman (BAWL). We comprehensively
benchmark this fingerprint under atomic noise, lattice strain, and symmetry
transformations, demonstrating that it outperforms existing fingerprinting
techniques such as SLICES, and CLOUD in robustness while offering greater
computational efficiency than similarity-based approaches such as Pymatgen's
StructureMatcher. Additionally, the fingerprint facilitates the analysis of
functional-dependent trends (PBE, PBESol, SCAN) offering a scalable framework
for data-driven materials science.

### On-Shell Methods for Quantum Matter: Strongly correlated Dirac materials

We propose a framework for applying on-shell scattering amplitude methods to
emergent relativistic phases of quantum matter. Many strongly correlated
systems, from Dirac and Weyl semimetals to topological-insulator surfaces,
exhibit low-energy excitations that are effectively massless relativistic
spinors. We show that physical observables such as nonlinear optical and Hall
responses can be obtained from compact on-shell amplitudes, bypassing the
complexity of Feynman diagrams. As a concrete demonstration, we derive the
nonlinear Hall conductivity of a Dirac semimetal from a single parity-odd
three-photon amplitude, highlighting the analytic and conceptual power of
amplitude-based approaches for strongly correlated condensed-matter systems.

The chemical flexibility of the $RM_6X_6$ stoichiometry, where an $f$-block
element is intercalated in the CoSn structure type, allows for the tuning of
flatbands associated with kagome lattices to the Fermi level and for emergent
phenomena due to interactions between the $f$- and $d$-electron lattices. Yet,
5$f$ members of the "166" compounds are underrepresented compared with 4$f$
members. Here, we report single-crystal growth of UCr$_6$Ge$_6$, which
crystallizes in a monoclinically distorted Y$_{0.5}$Co$_3$Ge$_3$-type
structure. The real-space character of the modulation, which is unique within
the $RM_6X_6$ family, is approximated by a 3$\times$1$\times$2 supercell of the
average monoclinic cell. The compound has kagome-lattice flatbands near the
Fermi level and a moderately enhanced electronic heat capacity, as evidenced by
its low-temperature Sommerfeld coefficient ($\gamma=86.5$ mJ mol$^{-1}$
K$^{-2}$) paired with band structure calculations. The small, isotropic
magnetization and featureless resistivity of UCr$_6$Ge$_6$ suggest itinerant
uranium 5$f$ electrons and Pauli paramagnetism. The isotropic magnetic behavior
of the uranium 5$f$ electrons starkly contrasts with localized behavior in
other uranium 166 compounds, highlighting the high tunability of the magnetic
ground state across the material family.

Tunable electronic properties in magnetic materials lead to novel physical
phenomena that have the potential to be exploited in the design of new
spintronic devices. Here, we report the effect of uniaxial stress on the
anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in the hexagonal frustrated antiferromagnetic
Heusler compound Mn3Ge. Our x-ray diffraction results show that the c/a ratio
varies linearly with strain when stress is applied along the a axis, as well as
a significantly higher Young's modulus along the c direction. The linear
behavior of the c/a ratio under uniaxial stress mirrors that seen under
hydrostatic pressure up to 1.8 GPa, but results in a characteristically
different behavior of the AHE. Stress applied along the a axis induces a
distortion in the ab plane, smoothing the abrupt jump in the AHE signal at zero
magnetic field. In contrast, stress applied along the c axis has little effect,
presumably due to the higher Young's modulus. We argue that this is due to
pronounced changes in magnetic order.

Bi alloying is predicted to transform GaAs from a semiconductor to a
topological insulator or semi-metal. To date, studies of the GaAs$_{1-x}$Bi$_x$
alloy band structure have been limited, and the origins of Bi-induced
enhancement of the spin-orbit splitting energy, $\Delta_\mathrm{SO}$, are
unresolved. Here, we present high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy (ARPES) of droplet-free epitaxial GaAs$_{1-x}$Bi$_x$ films with
$x_{\mathrm{Bi}}$ = 0.06. In addition to quantifying the Bi-induced shifts of
the light-hole and heavy-hole valence bands, we probe the origins of the
Bi-enhanced $\Delta_\mathrm{SO}$. Using exact-two-component density functional
theory calculations, we identify the key role of Bi p-orbitals in the upward
shift of the light-hole and heavy-hole bands that results in the Bi-enhanced
$\Delta_\mathrm{SO}$.

The fabrication of large, high-quality single crystals (SCs) of all-inorganic
cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr$_3$) via accessible methods remains a significant
challenge. This work presents a systematic approach to optimize the antisolvent
vapor-assisted crystallization (AVC) method, where the experimental design is
guided by a theoretical methods at each step. A synergistic 9:1 (v/v) DMSO/DMF
binary solvent was selected to balance solubility and kinetics, a choice
rationalized by an analysis of Gutmann's donor numbers. Subsequently, ethanol
was selected as a promising antisolvent by evaluating its properties against
key criteria of miscibility and diffusion rate using Hansen Solubility
Parameters (HSP) and Fick's law expressed in terms of saturated vapor pressure.
Within this rationally-defined chemical system, the "growth window" was
experimentally mapped, identifying an optimal precursor concentration of 0.35 M
and a preliminary titration step to induce a controlled metastable state. The

Quantitative low-energy electron diffraction [LEED $I(V)$ or LEED $I(E)$, the
evaluation of diffraction intensities $I$ as a function of the electron energy]
is a versatile technique for the study of surface structures. The technique is
based on optimizing the agreement between experimental and calculated
intensities. Today, the most commonly used measure of agreement is Pendry's $R$
factor $R_\mathrm{P}$. While $R_\mathrm{P}$ has many advantages, it also has
severe shortcomings, as it is a noisy target function for optimization and very
sensitive to small offsets of the intensity. Furthermore, $R_\mathrm{P} = 0$,
which is meant to imply perfect agreement between two $I(E)$ curves can also be
achieved by qualitatively very different curves. We present a modified $R$
factor $R_\mathrm{S}$, which can be used as a direct replacement for
$R_\mathrm{P}$, but avoids these shortcomings. We also demonstrate that
$R_\mathrm{S}$ is as good as $R_\mathrm{P}$ or better in steering the
optimization to the correct result in the case of imperfections of the
experimental data, while another common $R$ factor, $R_\mathrm{ZJ}$ (suggested
by Zanazzi and Jona) is worse in this respect.
