- **TL;DR**: 该论文研究了一种纯几何结构实现的约瑟夫森二极管效应，通过在由两条平行自旋无p波链组成的Kitaev梯子约瑟夫森结中引入腿间相位差来打破时间反演对称性，从而实现无磁场或自旋轨道耦合的非互易超导输运。

We study the Josephson diode effect realized purely by geometry in a Kitaev-ladder Josephson junction composed of two parallel spinless $p$-wave chains coupled by an interleg hopping $t_\perp$. The junction is governed by two phases: the superconducting phase difference across the weak link, $θ$, and the leg-to-leg phase difference, $φ$. For $φ\notin \{0, π\}$ (mod $2π$), time-reversal symmetry is broken, and the absence of leg-exchange symmetry leads to a breakdown of the antisymmetry of the current-phase relation, yielding nonreciprocal Josephson transport without magnetic fields or spin-orbit coupling. By resolving transport into bonding and antibonding channels defined by $t_\perp$, it is shown that the leg phase acts as an effective phase shift for interband ($p_ν/p_{-ν}$) tunneling, whereas the same-band ($p_ν/p_ν$) contribution remains unshifted. These channels arise at different perturbative orders and, together with the $4π$-periodic Majorana channel that emerges near the topological transition, interfere to produce a pronounced diode response. The class-D Pfaffian invariant identifies the parameter regime where the ladder hosts Majorana zero modes. Bogoliubov-de Gennes calculations reveal a dome-like dependence of the diode efficiency $η$ on $t_\perp$: $η\to 0$ for $t_\perp\to 0$ and for large $t_\perp$, with a maximum at intermediate coupling that is tunable by $φ$. The present results establish a field-free, geometry-based route to superconducting rectification in one-dimensional topological systems and specify symmetry and topology conditions for optimizing the effect in ladder and network devices.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究展示了悬浮NbSe2薄层中通过局部应变和热调制实现可控超导性，能够调制临界温度约0.92K（约12.5%），并实现栅极可调超导临界电流和可配置的多稳态传输特性。

Tunable superconductors provide a versatile platform for advancing next-generation quantum technologies. Here, we demonstrate controllable superconductivity in suspended NbSe2 thin layers, achieved through local strain and thermal modulation of the superconducting state. Our results show that suspended NbSe2 structures enable strain modulation of the critical temperature by up to approximately 0.92 K (about 12.5% of the critical temperature) and allow the realization of gate-tunable superconducting critical currents. We further demonstrate configurable hysteretic transport characteristics exhibiting multistability and negative differential resistance, providing easily reconfigurable, spatially dependent superconducting states. These phenomena are well explained by calculations of electron-phonon coupling using density functional theory, together with time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau dynamics coupled to the thermal diffusion equation. Our work provides profound insight into strain and thermal modulation of van der Waals superconductors and opens new opportunities for tunable on-chip superconductor devices, integrated superconducting circuits, and quantum simulators.

- **TL;DR**: 研究Holstein和SSH两种电子-声子耦合对双极化子形成和超导性的协同效应，发现适当结合两种耦合可以压缩双极化子尺寸而不显著增加质量，从而提高超导转变温度。

We study bipolaron formation and bipolaronic superconductivity on a square lattice, where electrons couple to both local Holstein phonons via on-site charge density and nonlocal bond Su-Schrieffer-Heeger phonons via modulation of hopping amplitudes. Using an unbiased Diagrammatic Monte Carlo method, we investigate how the interplay between these two types of electron-phonon coupling affects the bipolaron binding energy, effective mass, spatial extent (quantified by the mean-squared radius), and the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$. We find that, in some parameter space, the moderate Holstein coupling, though detrimental to $T_c$ when acting alone, can enhance superconductivity when combined with the bond SSH coupling by further compressing the bipolaron without significantly increasing its mass. Similarly, introducing bond SSH coupling into a Holstein bipolaron reduces its size while keeping the effective mass nearly unchanged, leading a higher $T_c$. These effects give rise to nonmonotonic behavior and reveal a cooperative regime in which both couplings work together to enhance superconductivity. We further examine phonon frequency asymmetry, particularly the case $ω_H/t = 2ω_B/t$, and show that in the deep adiabatic regime, adding Holstein coupling can even raise $T_c$ when combined with bond SSH coupling. These results highlight the distinct and complementary roles of local Holstein and non-local bond SSH electron-phonon couplings, and suggest strategies for optimizing high-$T_c$ superconductivity in systems with multiple phonon modes.

We employ a large-scale, unbiased constrained-path quantum Monte Carlo method to systematically simulate the effective two-orbital Hubbard model for twisted bilayer graphene in order to gain deeper insight into the relationship between correlated states and the superconducting pairing mechanism in twisted bilayer graphene, as well as the influence of the twist angle on superconductivity. Initially, we investigate the modulation of superconductivity by nearest-neighbor attractive Coulomb interactions, demonstrating that electron-phonon coupling plays a significant role in the system. Our numerical results reveal that the superconducting state is dominated by chiral NN-d+id superconducting electron pairing symmetry, and that such nearest-neighbor attractive Coulomb interactions significantly enhance the effective long-range pairing correlation function of chiral NN-d+id wave. Then, we explore how the twist angle affects the superconducting state. Our results show that as the twist angle deviates downward from 1.08°, the effective pairing correlation function of the chiral NN-d+id wave increases substantially. Through these investigations, our numerical findings not only contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of strongly correlated systems such as twisted bilayer graphene, but also provide guidance for identifying twist-angle systems with potentially higher superconducting transition temperatures.

- **TL;DR**: 分析各向异性狄拉克材料在非均匀电磁场下的行为，研究场分布如何影响能谱、朗道能级和态局域化，并探讨有限范围对局域化和输运的影响。

This work analyzes anisotropic Dirac materials, such as graphene and borophene, under inhomogeneous electric and magnetic fields with position-dependent profiles. Exact solutions of the Dirac--Weyl equation are obtained for singular and exponentially decaying interactions, showing how anisotropy and field shape influence the energy spectrum, Landau levels, and state localization. The analysis is further extended using the Asymptotic Iteration Method (AIM) in its perturbative form, applied to systems with bounded domains $( -\infty, x_0 ]$ or $( 0, x_0 ]$. In particular, we consider the case $( -\infty, x_0 ]$, where the field vanishes asymptotically. The first-order corrections reveal how the finite range $x_0$ modifies localization and transport, and how a critical electric field emerges at which Landau levels collapse, providing insight into the design of field-defined regions in two-dimensional nanoelectronic and quantum devices.

The formation of flat electronic bands from long-wavelength superperiodic moiré potentials in van der Waals heterostructures underpins the creation and control of a host of highly-tuneable correlated and topological phases. The underlying moiré periodicity is, however, typically considered a fixed property of the heterostructure. Here, we show how the development of a charge-density wave (CDW) in one of the constituent materials can create an emergent moiré periodicity, realising a superperiodic potential in TiSe$_2$/graphite epitaxial heterostructures with an order-of-magnitude longer wavelength than that expected from the normal-state lattice mismatch. We demonstrate how this drives the formation of a remarkably strong band flattening, which can be readily deactivated by carrier doping across the CDW phase transition, opening new prospects for engineering moiré matter by exploiting the rich many-body states of the parent compounds of 2D heterostructures.

- **TL;DR**: X射线吸收光谱(XAS)在分析TiO2负载单原子催化剂(SACs)的结构和电子性质方面具有独特优势，本文综述了XAS在单金属和双金属SACs表征中的应用，以及原位XAS在监测光催化反应过程中的应用。

Surface modification of TiO2 with single-atom catalysts (SACs) is an effective strategy for enhancing photocatalytic efficiency. However, thorough characterization of SACs at the atomic scale remains challenging. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) offers unique advantages for the in-depth analysis of TiO2-supported SACs. By employing XAS, the local atomic structure, oxidation state, and electronic properties of the SACs, as well as the underlying photocatalytic mechanism, can be revealed. Herein, we present a short review on the application of XAS in studying TiO2-supported SACs. We first elucidate the key role of XAS in simultaneously probing the structure and electronic properties of monometallic SACs across different periods. Next, we discuss XAS studies of bimetallic SACs from the perspective of each constituent element and highlight the element-specific capabilities of XAS for analyzing multi-element SACs. Finally, we demonstrate how in situ XAS can effectively monitor structural and electronic property changes in SACs under real photocatalytic reaction conditions. Additionally, we provide practical suggestions for utilizing XAS more efficiently in the analysis of various SAC systems.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文研究了随机矩阵特征值密度相关性的动力学演化，发现在Dyson布朗运动下，动态相关性在复平面偏微分方程特征表达下仍保持高度普适性。

It was shown roughly thirty years ago that the density correlations of eigenvalues of large random matrices display a universal form, independent of most of the details of the distribution of the random matrix itself. We show that when the matrix elements evolve according to a Dyson Brownian motion, dynamical correlations retain a large degree of the universality found at equal times when expressed in terms of the characteristics of some partial differential equation in the complex plane.

### Coupled Aerodynamic-Electromagnetic Modeling for RCS Estimation of Million-Scale Chaff Clouds with Arbitrarily Curved 3D Geometries

- **TL;DR**: 本文提出了一个结合空气动力学和电磁学的多物理场耦合框架，用于准确预测大规模箔条云的雷达散射截面(RCS)，考虑了箔条在部署后的三维几何形状变化和空气动力学效应。

Accurate prediction of the radar cross section (RCS) of chaff clouds requires careful consideration of aerodynamic effects, as the orientation and spatial distribution of individual chaff elements evolve significantly after deployment. Building upon conventional six-degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) formulations for chaff aerodynamic analysis-which assumed straight or two-dimensionally bent geometries-we extend the framework to incorporate arbitrarily curved three-dimensional chaff geometries. This extension enables accurate modeling of both flattened and helical dynamics induced by aerodynamic moments acting along the roll, pitch, and yaw directions, thereby providing a more comprehensive and realistic description of chaff motion. We then finally develop a coupled aerodynamic-electromagnetic framework that integrates the extended aerodynamic model with our recently developed fast method-of-moments solver, which is optimized for efficiently estimating the RCS of million-scale chaff clouds. The proposed multiphysics coupled framework allows real-time, first-principles prediction of the monostatic and bistatic RCS of large-scale chaff clouds with arbitrary geometries, orientations, and lengths, accurately incorporating their time-varying aerodynamic evolution. Simulation results confirm that the monostatic RCS is strongly influenced by aerodynamic effects, with the coexistence of flattened and helical motions playing a critical role in determining the overall scattering response. The proposed framework thus provides a physically grounded and computationally efficient approach for predicting the RCS of large-scale chaff clouds. Furthermore, it can be directly extended to radar signal processing applications by utilizing multi-frequency complex-valued far-field responses, thereby enabling the reconstruction of Range-Doppler, Range-Angle, and Doppler-Angle maps.

### Looking Inside the Widom Region: Non-Equilibrium Stratification in Supercritical CO2

- **TL;DR**: 实验发现超临界二氧化碳在非平衡条件下会自发分层，形成具有不同热力学性质的层状结构，挑战了传统热力学对超临界态作为连续相的描述。

The supercritical state of matter is usually described as a continuous phase without sharp boundaries between liquid and gas regions. However, under non-equilibrium conditions, this view breaks down. Here we report an experimental investigation of non-equilibrium fluctuations in supercritical carbon dioxide (CO2) subjected to a stabilising temperature gradient. Using shadowgraphy, we reveal spontaneous stratification of the fluid into different layers, separated by transition regions, where thermodynamic properties vary dramatically. These signatures are particularly evident when the system crosses the Widom lines, loci of the extrema of the response function in the supercritical domain. The analysis of the intermediate scattering function of temperature fluctuations highlights the presence of Brunt-Vaisala oscillations within the fluid at multiple frequencies. These oscillations arise from the coupling of thermal and viscous modes under gravity and are a clear signature of the layered structure of the fluid. Our approach enables systematic exploration of a wide range of thermodynamic conditions in a single experiment. These findings suggest that the Widom region cannot be described as a homogeneous phase, but rather as a dynamic assembly of phase-like behaviours, challenging the applicability of classical thermodynamics in non-equilibrium supercritical regimes.

- **TL;DR**: 在LaAlO3/KTaO3异质结构中首次观察到可编辑的超导二极管效应，通过导电原子力显微镜光刻技术实现了SDE极性和效率的可逆纳米级编辑。

Superconducting diodes, which enable dissipationless supercurrent flow in one direction while blocking it in the reverse direction, are emerging as pivotal components for superconducting electronics. The development of editable superconducting diodes could unlock transformative applications, including dynamically reconfigurable quantum circuits that adapt to operational requirements. Here, we report the first observation of the superconducting diode effect (SDE) in LaAlO3/KTaO3 heterostructures, a two-dimensional oxide interface superconductor with exceptional tunability. We observe a strong SDE in Hall-bar (or strip-shaped) devices under perpendicular magnetic fields (&lt; 15 Oe), with efficiencies above 40% and rectification signals exceeding 10 mV. Through conductive atomic force microscope lithography, we demonstrate reversible nanoscale editing of the SDE's polarity and efficiency by locally modifying the superconducting channel edges. This approach enables multiple nonvolatile configurations within a single device, realizing an editable superconducting diode. Our work establishes LAO/KTO as a platform for vortex-based nonreciprocal transport and provides a pathway toward designer quantum circuits with on-demand functionalities.

### An Unusual Dresselhaus Spin-Orbit Contribution of Even Order in Momentum

- **TL;DR**: 该论文揭示了在普通半导体异质结构中，通过带间效应出现了一种二次Dresselhaus自旋轨道耦合项，这种非常规的自旋轨道项产生了多种独特的量子现象，为利用偶阶动量自旋轨道项的自旋电子学功能开辟了新途径。

The spin-orbit (SO) coupling is conventionally known to manifest as \emph{odd} functions of momentum. Here, through both model calculations and symmetry analysis along with the method of invariants, we reveal that, in ordinary semiconductor heterostructures, a \emph{quadratic} Dresselhaus SO term -- inheriting from its bulk crystal form -- emerges via the interband effect, while complying with time-reversal and spatial symmetries. Furthermore, we observe that this unusual SO term gives rise to a range of striking quantum phenomena, including hybridized swirling texture, anisotropic energy dispersion, avoided band crossing, longitudinal \emph{Zitterbewegung}, and opposite spin evolution between different bands in quantum dynamics. These stand in stark contrast to those associated with the usual \emph{linear} SO terms. Our findings uncover a previously overlooked route for exploiting interband effects and open new avenues for spintronic functionalities that leverage unusual SO terms of \emph{even} orders in momentum.

- **TL;DR**: 对无序缺陷萤石结构Ho2Zr2O7的热磁特性和晶体电场能级进行研究，发现该材料在磁挫败和结构无序共存的情况下表现出缓慢自旋动力学但无玻璃态行为，且无长程磁有序。

In this work, we report on the thermomagnetic characterization and crystalline-electric field (CEF) energy scheme of the disordered defect-fluorite Ho2Zr2O7. This structural phase is distinguished by the coexistence of magnetic frustration and extensive disorder, with Ho3+ and Zr4+ sharing randomly the same 4a site with even 50% occupancy, and an average 1/8 oxygen vacancy per unit cell. AC magnetic susceptibility measurements performed on powder samples down to 0.5 K revealed signs of slowing spin dynamics without glassy behavior, including a frequency dependent peak at 1 K. Yet, no evidence for long-range magnetic order is found down to 150 mK in specific heat. Inelastic neutron scattering measurements show a weak, low-lying CEF excitation around 2 meV, accompanied by a broad level centered at 60 meV. To fit our observations, we propose an approach to account for structural disorder in the crystal-field splitting of the non-Kramers Ho3+. Our model provides an explanation to the broadening of the high-energy, single-ion excitations and suggests that the zirconate ground-state wave function has zero magnetic moment. However, structural disorder acts as guarantor of the magnetism in Ho2Zr2O7, allowing the mixing of low lying states at finite temperatures. Finally, we show that this scenario is in good agreement with the bulk properties reported in this work.

- **TL;DR**: 通过表面声波传播研究二维材料h-BN与基底之间的弹性耦合特性，使用飞秒激光泵浦-探测干涉技术测量表面垂直速度分布，揭示hBN区域的声波色散现象

Understanding the properties of two-dimensional materials interfaces with the substrate is necessary for device applications. Surface acoustic wave propagation through the layered material flake on a substrate could provide unique information on the transverse rigidity of the flake-to-substrate interaction. We generate ultrasonic waves by a focused femtosecond laser pulse at the surface of the model system -- fused silica with h-BN flake transferred above. Using an all-optical spatially resolved pump-probe interferometric technique, we measure the spatial dependencies of the surface vertical velocity profiles. Our measurements reveal the appearance of the surface acoustic wave dispersion in the hBN flake region compared to fused silica surface. Multilayer modeling allows us to gain access to longitudinal and shear elastic coupling constants $c^*_{33}$ and $c^*_{44}$ between hexagonal BN and substrate.

We study the Ising model at fixed magnetization on a triangular ladder with three-spin interactions. By recasting the ground-state determination as a linear programming (LP) problem, we solve it exactly using standard LP techniques. We construct the phase diagram for arbitrary fixed magnetization and identify three types of ground states: periodic, phase-separated, and ordered but aperiodic. When magnetization is treated as a free parameter, the ground state adopts only periodic configurations with the average magnetization per site $0$, $\pm 1/3$ or $\pm 1$, except for the phase boundaries.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了扩展深度能量方法(XDEM)，统一了离散和连续断裂模型，在稀疏均匀配置点下实现精确断裂预测，显著提升了标准DEM的精度和效率。

Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have recently emerged as powerful tools for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), with the Deep Energy Method (DEM) proving especially effective in fracture mechanics due to its energy-based formulation. Despite these advances, existing DEM approaches require dense collocation near cracks, face stability challenges, and typically treat discrete and continuous fracture models separately. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Extended Deep Energy Method (XDEM), a unified deep learning framework that incorporates both displacement discontinuities and crack-tip asymptotics in the discrete setting, while flexibly coupling displacement and phase fields in the continuous setting. This integration enables accurate fracture predictions using uniformly distributed, relatively sparse collocation points. Validation across benchmark problems including stress intensity factor evaluation, straight and kinked crack growth, and complex crack initiation demonstrates that XDEM consistently outperforms standard DEM in accuracy and efficiency. By bridging discrete and phase-field models within a single framework, XDEM establishes a robust foundation for applying AI to fracture mechanics and opens new avenues for predictive modeling in engineering and materials science.

Understanding how gas mixtures diffuse and distribute within porous frameworks is central to designing advanced separation and storage materials. Here, we investigate the transport and spatial distribution of binary gas mixtures in a porous metal organic framework, viz., ZIF-90, using molecular simulations. We perform grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations to examine the competitive adsorption of carbon dioxide and nitrogen from a binary gas mixture in ZIF-90, while molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are conducted to investigate the transport behavior of the adsorbed molecules within the framework. These integrated simulations reveal that the framework topology and pore chemistry jointly dictate diffusion pathways and preferential occupancy of gas species, underscoring their intrinsic interdependence. Competitive adsorption leads to distinct spatial partitioning within the pores, which in turn modulates mixture diffusivity inside the porous medium compared to their bulk properties. Our results provide molecular-level insight into how ZIF-90 accommodates and separates gas mixtures, offering design principles for optimizing metal-organic frameworks in energy and environmental applications.

We performed high-resolution magnetostriction measurements on the Pauli-limited superconductor Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ using high-quality single crystals. A first-order superconducting transition, accompanied by pronounced hysteresis, was observed under in-plane magnetic fields, where the relative length change of the sample, $ΔL/L$, was on the order of $10^{-8}$. To ensure the reliability of the measurements, particular attention was paid to minimizing the influence of magnetic torque, which can significantly affect data under in-plane field configurations, via field-angle-resolved magnetostriction. Within the hysteresis regime, slightly below the Pauli-limited upper critical field, a hump-like anomaly in the magnetostriction coefficient was identified. Furthermore, a characteristic double-peak structure in the field-angle derivative of the magnetostriction provides additional support for this anomaly. Although these findings may reflect a lattice response associated with the emergence of the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) phase in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, the possibility of a broadened first-order transition cannot be excluded. Notably, this magnetostriction anomaly qualitatively deviates from the FFLO phase boundary suggested by previous NMR measurements, highlighting the necessity for further experimental and theoretical investigations to elucidate the nature of the FFLO state in this material.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究开发了一种基于单层过渡金属二硫化物和铁电衬底的晶体管架构，实现了从量子关联到热载流子输运的交叉调控，在低温下观察到电子-电子相互作用驱动的准周期电流涨落，在室温下获得了创纪录的高电子迁移率和最大导通电流。

Quantum correlation and hot-carrier transport represent two fundamentally distinct regimes of electronic conduction, rarely accessible within the same device. Here, we report a state-of-the-art monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides transistor architecture on a ferroelectric substrate that enables this crossover by leveraging the strong dielectric screening and in-plane gate control. At cryogenic temperatures, the devices exhibit reproducible quasi-periodic current fluctuations, consistent with an emergent potential landscape driven by electron-electron interactions at low carrier densities. As the temperature increases, this correlated potential profile thermally dissolves and transport is dominated by the lateral gate-field that drives the carriers with high kinetic energy. These hot-carriers can efficiently surmount the scattering events, exhibiting a record-high room-temperature electron mobility of ~4,800 cm^2/Vs and a maximum on-current ~0.5 mA/μm, surpassing traditional FETs in key performance metrics. These findings establish a unified approach for probing intermediate mesoscopic orders, while advancing the transistor performance limits in scalable 2D transistors.

Heterostructures of two-dimensional materials offer a versatile platform to study light-matter interactions of electron and hole gases. By separating electron and hole layers with an insulator long-lived electron-hole bound states known as interlayer excitons can form. We predict that by placing an interlayer exciton in a time-reversal-symmetry-breaking chiral cavity the energy spectrum of an interlayer exciton can be reordered. As a consequence of this reordering the ground state of the interlayer exciton can be driven from an s-orbital to a p-orbital, effectively changing the symmetry of the electron-hole pair. We present a phase diagram showing the couplings and separations required for a p-orbital excitonic ground state where we predict that larger interlayer separations require higher cavity couplings. We expect these results to be relevant for angular-momentum-tunable, single photon emission physics.

- **TL;DR**: 本文通过自旋对称性破缺研究EuB6和SmB6，发现顺磁构型产生不同的交换场，导致Eu和Sm的电子和磁性质对称性破缺，为实验观察到的多原子环境提供了新的解释。

Symmetry breaking (SB) has proven to be a powerful approach for describing quantum materials: strong correlation, mass renormalization, and complex phase transitions are among the phenomena that SB can capture, even when coupled to a mean-field-like theory. Traditionally, corrective schemes were required to account for these effects; however, SB has emerged as an alternative that can also successfully describe the intricate physics of quantum materials. Here, we explore spin SB on EuB6 and SmB6 and how its relation to the exchange field can determine onsite properties, depending on the type of symmetry breaking. Using spin-polarized Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations with the r2SCAN functional, we systematically compare four magnetic configurations, one totally symmetric - non-magnetic (NM) configuration - and three with different types of symmetry breaking: ferromagnetic (FM), antiferromagnetic (AFM) and a paramagnetic (PM) configuration - modeled through a Special Quasirandom Structure (SQS) method - to capture local symmetry-breaking effects. Our results show that the PM configuration produces distinct magnetic environments for the rare-earth atoms, leading to different exchange fields. These, in turn, induce symmetry breaking in the electronic and magnetic properties of Eu and Sm. Those results provide an alternative explanation for the experimental results on both materials, EuB6 and SmB6, where X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES) measurements suggest the presence of multiple atomic environments, previously attributed to a mixed-valence configuration.

Visibility graphs are spatial interpretations of time series. When derived from the time evolution of physical systems, the graphs associated with such series may exhibit properties that can reflect aspects such as ergodicity, criticality, or other dynamical behaviors. It is important to describe how the criticality of a system is manifested in the structure of the corresponding graphs or, in a particular way, in the spectra of certain matrices constructed from them. In this paper, we show how the critical behavior of an Ising spin system manifests in the spectra of the adjacency and Laplacian matrices constructed from an ensemble of time evolutions simulated via Monte Carlo (MC) Markov Chains, even for small systems and short MC steps. In particular, we show that the number of spanning trees -- or its logarithm -- , which represents a kind of \emph{structural entropy} or \emph{topological complexity} here obtained from Kirchhoff's theorem, can, in an alternative way, describe the criticality of the spin system. These findings parallel those obtained from the spectra of correlation matrices, which similarly encode signatures of critical and chaotic behavior.

- **TL;DR**: NeuroPINNs是一种基于神经科学启发的PINNs扩展，使用脉冲神经元模型实现节能的PDE求解，特别适合神经形态硬件和资源受限设备。

We introduce NeuroPINNs, a neuroscience-inspired extension of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) that incorporates biologically motivated spiking neuron models to achieve energy-efficient PDE solving. Unlike conventional PINNs, which rely on continuously firing activations and therefore incur high computational and energy costs, NeuroPINNs leverage Variable Spiking Neurons (VSNs) to enable sparse, event-driven communication. This makes them particularly well-suited for deployment on neuromorphic hardware and for scenarios with constrained computational resources, such as embedded and edge devices. A central challenge, however, lies in reconciling the discontinuous dynamics of spiking neurons with the smooth residual-based loss formulation required in PINNs. Direct smoothing introduces systematic biases, leading to inaccurate PDE learning. To overcome this, we employ a novel stochastic projection method inspired from upscaled theory that faithfully captures spiking behavior while maintaining compatibility with gradient-based optimization. Standard surrogate backpropagation is used for parameter updates, ensuring computational tractability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of NeuroPINNs on four representative PDE problems across both regular and irregular domains. Furthermore, application of NeuroPINN for linear elastic micromechnics in three dimensions was also explored. Results show that NeuroPINNs achieve high accuracy while substantially reducing communication and energy demands, marking a step toward scalable, neuromorphic-ready scientific machine learning.

It is known that the many-body ground state of a two-dimensional electron system can be tuned through Coulomb engineering by controlling the permittivity of the surrounding media. However, permittivities are traditionally restricted to positive values. In this paper we argue that the negative capacitance effect demonstrated in appropriately engineered structures can open new vistas in Coulomb engineering. Negative permittivities transform the natural repulsive interaction of electrons into an attractive one raising the intriguing possibility of a superconducting ground state. Using models of two-dimensional electron systems with linear and parabolic dispersion relations coupled to environments with negative capacitance, we estimate the strength and sign of the engineered Coulomb interaction and outline parameter regimes that could stabilize correlated electronic phases.

A lens, a device transforming propagation directions in an organized fashion, is one of the fundamental tools for wave manipulation. Spin wave, the collective excitation of ordered magnetizations, stands out as a promising candidate for future energy-saving information technologies. Here we propose theoretically and verify by micromagnetic simulations, that an antiferromagnetic skyrmion naturally serves as a lens for spin wave, when the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya strength exceeds a threshold. The underlying mechanism is the spin wave deflection caused by Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, a mechanism that is ordinarily overshadowed by the magnetic topology.

Motivated by recent theoretical predictions of a square-shaped skyrmion lattice (S-SkL) in centrosymmetric tetragonal Ce-based magnets [Yan Zha and Satoru Hayami, Phys. Rev. B 111, 165155 (2025)], we perform a comprehensive theoretical investigation on the role of multiorbital effects, magnetic anisotropy, and momentum-based frustrated exchange interactions in stabilizing such topologically nontrivial magnetic textures. By employing self-consistent mean-field calculations over a broad range of model parameters, we demonstrate that the cooperative interplay among multiorbital effects, frustrated exchange interactions at higher-harmonic wave vectors, and crystal-field anisotropy is crucial for the stabilization of the S-SkL. Furthermore, the competition between the easy-plane intraorbital coupling and the easy-axis interorbital coupling leads to a significant enhancement of the S-SkL stability region. We also identify a plethora of multi-$Q$ states, including magnetic bubble lattice and double-$Q$ phases with a local/global scalar chirality. Our findings elucidate the microscopic mechanism responsible for the emergence of S-SkLs in Ce-based magnets and provide a route toward realizing skyrmion lattices in a broader class of $f$-electron materials beyond conventional Gd- and Eu-based systems lacking orbital angular momentum.

- **TL;DR**: 提出量子辅助机器学习框架，通过量子退火解决材料发现中的数据稀缺和优化问题，在高熵合金中发现并验证了性能优异的Al8Cr38Fe50Mn2Ti2合金。

Data scarcity remains a central challenge in materials discovery, where finding meaningful descriptors and tuning models for generalization is critical but inherently a discrete optimization problem prone to multiple local minima confounding the true optimal state. Classical methods often get trapped in these minima, while quantum annealing can escape them via quantum fluctuations, including tunneling, that overcome narrow energy barriers. We present a quantum-assisted machine-learning (QaML) framework that employs quantum annealing to address these combinatorial optimization challenges through feature selection, support-vector training formulated in QUBO form for classification and regression, and a new QUBO-based neural-network pruning formulation. Recursive batching enables quantum annealing to handle large feature spaces beyond current qubit limits, while quantum-pruned networks exhibit superior generalization over classical methods, suggesting that quantum annealing preferentially samples flatter, more stable regions of the loss landscape. Applied to high-entropy alloys (HEAs), a data-limited but compositionally complex testbed, the framework integrates models for fracture-strain classification and yield-strength regression under physics-based constraints. The framework identified and experimentally validated Al8Cr38Fe50Mn2Ti2 (at.%), a single-phase BCC alloy exhibiting a 0.2 % yield strength of 568 MPa, greater than 40 % compressive strain without fracture, and a critical current density in reducing acid nearly an order of magnitude lower than 304 stainless steel. These results establish QA as a practical route to overcome classical optimization limits and accelerate materials discovery.

### Ordering in statistical systems on the way to the thermodynamic limit

It is well known that the mathematically accurate description of ordering and related symmetry breaking in statistical systems requires to consider the thermodynamic limit. But the order does not appear from nowhere, and yet before the thermodynamic limit is reached, there should exist some kind of preordering that appears and grows in the process of increasing the system size. The quantitative description of growing order, under the growing system size, is developed by introducing the notion of {\it order indices}. The rigorous proof of the phase transition existence is a separate difficult problem that is not the topic of the present paper. We illustrate the approach resorting to several models in the mean-field approximation, which makes it possible to demonstrate the notion of order indices for finite systems in a clear way. We show how the order grows on the way to the thermodynamic limit for Bose-Einstein condensation, arising superconductivity, magnetization, and crystallization phenomena.

Thermoacoustic tomography (TAT) is an imaging modality based on the thermoacoustic effect. In TAT, a short microwave or radio wave pulse is directed to the imaged target. The energy of the electromagnetic pulse is absorbed depending on the target's dielectric parameters, resulting in a spatially varying pressure distribution via the thermoacoustic effect. This pressure, known as the initial pressure distribution, relaxes as broadband ultrasound waves that are measured on the boundary of the target. In the inverse problem of TAT, the initial pressure is estimated from the measured ultrasound waves. TAT can further be extended to quantitative TAT (QTAT), where the aim is to estimate the dielectric parameters of the imaged target by utilizing a model for electromagnetic wave propagation. In this work, we consider the QTAT problem and propose an approach for simultaneous estimation of electrical conductivity and permittivity from the ultrasound waves. The problem is approached in the framework of Bayesian inverse problems. The forward model describing electromagnetic and acoustic wave propagation is based on Maxwell's equations and the acoustic wave equation, respectively. The approach is evaluated with numerical simulations. The results show that the dielectric parameters can be accurately estimated using the proposed approach. However, the ultrasound sensor geometry and the number of electromagnetic pulses have a significant effect on the accuracy of the estimated parameters.

Computation of electronic spectra is one of the most important applications of methods capturing static electron correlation, including complete-active-space self-consistent field (CASSCF) and post-CASSCF theories. Performance of these techniques critically depends on the active space construction, both in terms of accuracy and computational effort. In this work we benchmark the performance of automatic active space construction, as implemented in the Active Space Finder software, for the computation of electronic excitation energies. The multi-step procedure constructs meaningful molecular orbitals and selects the most suitable active space based on information from more approximate correlated calculations. It aims to tackle a key difficulty in computing excitation energies with CASSCF: choosing active spaces that are balanced for several electronic states. The Active Space Finder is tested with several established data sets of small and medium-sized molecules and shows encouraging results. We evaluate multiple setting configurations and provide practical recommendations.

Using the muon as a sensitive local magnetic probe, we investigated the layered kagome superconductor Cs(V$_{0.95}$Ti$_{0.05}$)$_3$Sb$_5$, a material notably devoid of both static magnetic moments and long-range charge order. Our transverse-field $μ$SR measurements reveal that the local magnetic susceptibility, obtained via the muon Knight shift, is dominated by orbital excitations with a split energy levels around 20 meV. Meanwhile, the persistence of itinerant electron paramagnetism down to 5 K and 7 T confirms the absence of static magnetism within this regime. In addition, zero-field (ZF) $μ$SR experiments detect a significant increase in the inhomogeneous nuclear dipolar field distribution below a featured temperature at 70 K. We attribute this ZF-$μ$SR feature to the emergence of local lattice distortions at low temperatures, potentially arising from orbital ordering. Significantly, our study establishes that orbital excitations constitute an intrinsic property of the layered V-Sb kagome lattice. Despite its small magnitude, spin-orbit coupling plays a crucial role in governing the lattice dynamics, potentially driving the emergence of novel phenomena such as phonon carrying angular momentum in crystals with non-chiral point groups.

Thermally activated abrupt switching between localized and itinerant electronic states during the insulator-metal transition (IMT) in correlated oxide systems serves as a powerful platform for exploring exotic physical phenomena and device functionality. One ongoing focal challenge lies in the realization of the broadly tunable IMT property in correlated system, to satisfy the demands of practical applications across diverse environments. Here, we unveil the overwhelming advantage associated with interfacial strain in bridging the bandwidth and band-filling control over the IMT property of VO2. Tailoring the orbital overlapping through strain-mediated bandwidth control enables a widely tunable thermally-driven IMT property in VO2. Benefiting from adjustable defect dynamics, filling-controlled Mott phase modulations from electron-localized t2g1eg0 state to electron-itinerant t2g1+Δeg0 state through oxygen vacancies can be facilitated by using in-plane tensile distortion, overcoming the high-speed bottlenecks in iontronic devices. Defect-engineered electronic phase transitions are primarily governed by the electron filling in t2g band of VO2, showcasing a definitive relationship with the incorporated defect concentration. Our findings provide fundamentally new insights into the on-demand design of emergent electronic states and transformative functionalities in correlated oxide system by unifying two fundamental control paradigms of bandwidth and band-filling control.

- **TL;DR**: 在高压高温条件下，PbTiO3会分解为PbO和TiO2，而在室温压缩下则保持四方相结构。激光加热产生了新的PbO多晶型，计算预测α-PbO在70GPa以上会金属化。

We investigated the behavior of lead titanate (PbTiO3) up to 100 GPa, both at room temperature and upon laser heating, using synchrotron X ray diffraction combined with density functional theory (DFT) computations. At the high pressure temperature (PT) conditions produced in laser heated diamond anvil cells, PbTiO3 dissociates into PbO and TiO2, consistent with our DFT computations showing that decomposition becomes enthalpically favored above 65 GPa. In contrast, on room temperature compression, PbTiO3 persists in the tetragonal I4mcm phase up to at least 100 GPa. Laser heating produces distinct PbO phases: a compressed form of alpha PbO and a previously unreported delta PbO polymorph, both of which transform to beta PbO on decompression. The calculations predict that alpha PbO undergoes pressure-induced band gap closure, metallizing above 70 GPa, whereas the delta and beta phases remain semiconducting with a band gap above 1 eV even at megabar pressures. The experimental and confirming theoretical results reveal an unanticipated dimension of the behavior of PbTiO3, showing that distinct equilibrium and metastable phases can be stabilized along different PT synthesis paths.

Two recent topics on a formal thermodynamic analogy of intracellular diffusivity fluctuations observed experimentally in normal/anomalous diffusion are reported. Not only the analogs of the quantity of heat and work as well as the internal energy but also that of the Clausius inequality are identified. Then, the analog of the heat engine is constructed to characterize extraction of the diffusivity change as the analog of work during a cycle, the efficiency of which is formally equivalent to that of the Carnot engine, making the total change of the entropy concerning the fluctuations vanish. The effect of the slow variation of the fluctuations on the efficiency is also briefly discussed.

Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods are uniquely capable of providing exact simulations of quantum many-body systems. Unfortunately, the applications of a QMC simulation are limited because extracting dynamic properties requires solving the analytic continuation (AC) problem. Across the many fields that use QMC methods, there is no universally accepted analytic continuation algorithm for extracting dynamic properties, but many publications compare to the maximum entropy method. We investigate when entropy maximization is an acceptable approach. We show that stochastic sampling algorithms reduce to entropy maximization when the Bayesian prior is near to the true solution. We investigate when is Bryan's controversial optimization algorithm [Bryan, Eur. Biophys. J. 18, 165-174 (1990)] for entropy maximization (sometimes known as the maximum entropy method) appropriate to use. We show that Bryan's algorithm is appropriate when the noise is near zero or when the Bayesian prior is near to the true solution. We also investigate the mean squared error, finding a better scaling when the Bayesian prior is near the true solution than when the noise is near zero. We point to examples of improved data-driven Bayesian priors that have already leveraged this advantage. We support these results by solving the double Gaussian problem using both Bryan's algorithm and the newly formulated dual approach to entropy maximization [Chuna et al., J. Phys. A: Math.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了新的混合量子-经典运动方程，在精确因子化框架内同时描述电子相干性和相位演化，揭示了投影量子动量修正和相位修正的重要性。

We propose new mixed quantum-classical equations of motion within the exact factorization framework to describe electronic coherence and phase evolution simultaneously. The derivation reveals that not only a projected quantum momentum correction, recently identified by Arribas and Maitra [Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 233201 (2024)], but also a phase-correction appears within the order of $\hbar$, providing a unified and rigorous account of electronic coherence and phase evolution as well as their effect on the nuclear force. Benchmark tests on one- and two-dimensional model systems demonstrate that the new formulations capture key nonadiabatic features with high accuracy.

- **TL;DR**: 使用量子蒙特卡洛方法研究石墨烯中的共振价键态，发现几何约束驱动的电子配对机制：在特定尺寸下能隙消失，RVB配对不稳定；而在有限能隙情况下，电子配对稳定存在。

We determine the resonating-valence-bond (RVB) state in graphene using real-space quantum Monte Carlo with correlated variational wave functions. Variational and diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (DMC) calculations with Jastrow-Slater-determinant and Jastrow-antisymmetrized-geminal-power ansatze are employed to evaluate the RVB pairing energy. Using a rectangular graphene sample that lacks $π/3$ rotational symmetry, we found that the single-particle energy gap near the Fermi level depends on the system size along the $x$-direction. The gap vanishes when the length satisfies $L_x=3n\sqrt{3}d$, where $n$ is an integer and $d$ is the carbon-carbon bond length, otherwise, the system, exhibits a finite gap. Our DMC results show no stable RVB pairing in the zero-gap case, whereas the opening of a finite gap near the Fermi level stabilizes the electron pairing. The DMC predicted absolute value of pairing energy at the thermodynamic limit for a finite-gap system is $\sim 0.48(1)$ mHa/atom. Our results reveal a feometry-driven electron pairing mechanism in the confined graphene nanostructure.

We study the charge transport and thermoelectric properties of the junction, comprising double quantum dot embedded in T-shaped geometry on the interface between two normal/ferromagnetic electrodes and superconducting lead. We show that the interdot coupling plays major role in controlling the local and nonlocal transport properties of this setup. For the weak interdot coupling limit, we obtain the interferometric (Fano-type) lineshapes imprinted in the quasiparticle spectra, conductances and Seebeck coefficients. In contrast, for the strong interdot coupling, we predict that the local and nonlocal transport coefficients are primarily dependent on the molecular Andreev bound states induced by superconducting proximity effect, simultaneously in both quantum dots.

By means of first-principles calculations, we investigate the role of electron-phonon interaction in the electronic structure of hybrid interfaces, formed by MoS$_2$ and monolayers of the organic molecules pyrene and pyridine, respectively. Quasiparticle energies are initially obtained within the $G_0W_0$ approximation and subsequently used to evaluate the electron-phonon self-energy and momentum-resolved spectral functions to assess the temperature renormalization of the band structure. We find that the band-gap renormalization by zero-point vibrations of both hybrid systems is comparable to that of pristine MoS$_2$, with a value of approximately 80 meV. Pronounced features of molecular origin emerge in the spectral function of the valence region, which we attribute to satellites arising from out-of-plane vibrational modes of the organic monolayers. For pyrene, this satellite exhibits a predominantly molecular character, while for pyridine, it has a hybrid nature, originating from the coupling of molecular vibrations to the MoS$_2$ valence band.

Using the mean-field approximation, a formula for the effective electrical conductivity of a two-dimensional system of randomly arranged conducting sticks with a given orientation distribution was obtained. Both the resistance of the sticks themselves and the resistance of the contacts between them were taken into account. The accuracy in the resulting formula was analyzed. A comparison of the theoretical predictions of mean-field approach with the results of direct electrical conductivity calculations for several model orientation distributions describing systems with crossed sticks demonstrated good agreement.

### Walsh-Hadamard Neural Operators for Solving PDEs with Discontinuous Coefficients

- **TL;DR**: 提出了Walsh-Hadamard神经算子(WHNO)，利用矩形波函数谱基处理不连续系数PDE问题，与Fourier神经算子(FNO)组合可显著提升精度。

Neural operators have emerged as powerful tools for learning solution operators of partial differential equations (PDEs). However, standard spectral methods based on Fourier transforms struggle with problems involving discontinuous coefficients due to the Gibbs phenomenon and poor representation of sharp interfaces. We introduce the Walsh-Hadamard Neural Operator (WHNO), which leverages Walsh-Hadamard transforms-a spectral basis of rectangular wave functions naturally suited for piecewise constant fields-combined with learnable spectral weights that transform low-sequency Walsh coefficients to capture global dependencies efficiently. We validate WHNO on three problems: steady-state Darcy flow (preliminary validation), heat conduction with discontinuous thermal conductivity, and the 2D Burgers equation with discontinuous initial conditions. In controlled comparisons with Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) under identical conditions, WHNO demonstrates superior accuracy with better preservation of sharp solution features at material interfaces. Critically, we discover that weighted ensemble combinations of WHNO and FNO achieve substantial improvements over either model alone: for both heat conduction and Burgers equation, optimal ensembles reduce mean squared error by 35-40 percent and maximum error by up to 25 percent compared to individual models. This demonstrates that Walsh-Hadamard and Fourier representations capture complementary aspects of discontinuous PDE solutions, with WHNO excelling at sharp interfaces while FNO captures smooth features effectively.

We have developed a reduced-cost non-Dyson third-order algebraic diagrammatic construction theory for the electron-attachment problem based on state-specific frozen natural orbitals. Density fitting and truncated natural auxiliary functions were employed to enhance computational efficiency. The use of state-specific frozen natural orbitals significantly decreases the virtual space and provides a notable speedup over the conventional EA-ADC(3) method with a systematically controllable accuracy. A perturbative correction for the truncated natural orbitals significantly reduces the error in the calculated electron affinity values. The method also shows sufficient accuracy in the case of non-valence correlation-bound anions, where the local approximation-based methods fail. The efficiency of the method is demonstrated by performing an EA-ADC(3) calculation with more than 1300 basis functions.

- **TL;DR**: 本文提出了kagome超导体中4a0条纹电荷密度波（CDW）的微观机制，通过分析12位点kagome晶格Hubbard模型中的CDW不稳定性，揭示了重构费米面的嵌套矢量导致4a0周期CDW的形成。

The interplay between unconventional density waves and exotic superconductivity has attracted growing interest. Kagome superconductors $A\rm{V}_3\rm{Sb}_5$ ($A = \rm{K}, \rm{Rb}, \rm{Cs}$) offer a platform for studying quantum phase transitions and the resulting symmetry breaking. Among these quantum phases, the $4a_0$ stripe charge-density-wave (CDW) has been widely observed for $A=\rm{Rb}$ and $\rm{Cs}$ by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements. However, the microscopic origin of the $4a_0$ stripe CDW remains elusive, and no theoretical studies addressing this phenomenon have been reported so far. In this paper, we propose a microscopic mechanism for the emergence of the $4a_0$ stripe CDW. We analyze the CDW instability in the 12-site kagome lattice Hubbard model with the $2\times2$ bond order driven by the paramagnon-interference mechanism by focusing on the short-range magnetic fluctuations due to the geometrical frustration of kagome lattice. We reveal that the nesting vector of the reconstructed Fermi surface, formed by the $2\times 2$ bond order, gives rise to a $4a_0$-period CDW. Remarkably, the obtained stripe CDW is composed of both the off-site hopping integral modulations and on-site potentials. The real-space structure of the stripe CDW obtained here is in good qualitative agreement with the experimentally observed stripe pattern.

- **TL;DR**: 提出并实验验证了一种用于亚开尔文温度量子器件的通用主动噪声消除方案，通过动态注入相位相干反噪声信号来补偿周期性环境干扰。

Solid-state quantum technologies such as quantum dot qubits and quantum electrical metrology circuits rely on quantum phenomena at ultra-low energies, making them highly sensitive to various forms of environmental noise. Conventional passive filtering schemes can reduce high-frequency noise but are often ineffective against low-frequency interference, like powerline or instrument-induced. Extending such filters to lower frequencies causes practical issues such as longer stabilization times, slower system response, and increased Johnson noise, which impede low-frequency transport measurements. To address these limitations, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a generalized active noise cancellation scheme for quantum devices operating at sub-Kelvin temperatures. Our approach compensates periodic environmental interference by dynamically injecting a phase-coherent anti-noise signal directly into the device. We employ an automated feedback protocol featuring beat-frequency reduction and adaptive phase-amplitude tuning, enabling real-time compensation without any manual intervention. Unlike post-processing or passive filtering, this method suppresses noise at the device level without introducing additional time constants. We implement the scheme on a gate-defined Si/SiGe quantum dot subject to strong 50 Hz powerline interference and validate its effectiveness through acquiring Coulomb Blockade Oscillations and Coulomb diamond plots. The technique achieves substantial suppression of both the targeted interference and the overall noise floor, thereby stabilizing transport characteristics and enhancing device fidelity. While demonstrated on a quantum dot, the proposed framework is broadly applicable to a wide class of solid-state quantum devices where deterministic noise presents a critical bottleneck.

- **TL;DR**: 计算了二十面体顶点上经典反铁磁XX模型在磁场中的基态，发现磁化强度随外场变化出现两个不连续点，在第一个不连续点后的宽场范围内存在简并基态。

The ground state of the classical antiferromagnetic XX model in a magnetic field is calculated for spins mounted on the vertices of the icosahedron. The magnetization is characterized by two discontinuities as a function of the external field. For a wide field range above the first discontinuity the ground state is degenerate, with two spins related by spatial inversion aligned with the field and the rest forming two magnetization units in the form of pentagons. It is shown that the degeneracy originates from the coupling of the two pentagons, which introduces the triangle, associated with ground-state degeneracy, as an interaction unit in the icosahedron. The magnetization discontinuities are shown to evolve first from the coupling of isolated triangles and then from the coupling of the two spins related by spatial inversion.

- **TL;DR**: VSe2/VN异质结构通过层间电荷转移实现了显著的能谷分裂和自旋选择性，具有高自旋过滤效率（75.4%）和室温铁磁居里温度，为谷电子学和自旋电子学提供了实用平台。

Rapid progress in valleytronics and spintronics is limited by the scarcity of two-dimensional materials that simultaneously provide robust valley splitting and strong spin selectivity. Here we showed that a van der Waals heterostructure (VSe2/VN) built from hexagonal VSe2 and hexagonal VN addressed this gap. Using first-principles density functional theory, phonon, ab initio molecular dynamics stability tests, Bader charge analysis, and Wannier-based Berry-curvature calculations, we demonstrated an energetically and dynamically stable heterostructure that exhibited interlayer charge transfer and a work function intermediate between the constituent monolayers. The electronic structure showed small indirect PBE gap (108.9 meV), with HSE06 indicating a half-metallic tendency; a sizable conduction-band valley splitting (ΔCKK' = 22.9 meV for spin-up and ΔCKK' = 61.3 meV for spin-down); and pronounced spin asymmetry, where the spin-down channel showed a wide semiconducting gap (0.64 eV) while the spin-up channel was nearly gapless. These features yielded a high zero-strain spin-filter efficiency P = 75.4%, tunable to 82.5% under +4% biaxial tensile strain. The heterostructure also supported non-zero, valley-contrasting Berry curvature, and a large anomalous Hall conductivity (peak sigmaxy = 568.33 S/cm). Importantly, mean-field estimation placed the ferromagnetic Curie temperature near room temperature at zero strain (Tc = 284.04 K), while Tc decreased to 183.9 K at +4% strain, the magnetic order remained robust to cryogenic temperatures, providing a beneficial tuning knob to balance spin-filter performance with thermal stability in device-relevant regimes. These results identified VSe2/VN as a practical, strain-tunable platform for integrated valleytronic, spintronic devices, and for exploring anomalous Hall and valley-dependent transport phenomena.

The process of preparing heterogeneous catalysts on porous supports includes a drying stage, in which the porous material, impregnated with an aqueous solution of the catalyst precursor, is dried, and the precursor is precipitated on the pore walls.

This paper presents a mathematical model for simulating the precipitation distribution during the drying of a porous sphere. Examples of calculations are given demonstrating the influence of some parameters on the distribution by space and by pore size.17

We report a well-resolved 0.7 conductance anomaly at $G = 0.7\times(2e^2/h)$ in bilayer graphene/WSe$_2$ quantum point contacts. Proximity-enhanced spin-orbit coupling splits the four-fold ground state of bilayer graphene into well-separated spin-valley locked Kramers doublets. The anomaly emerges between these opposite spin-valley states. Despite fundamentally different band structure and wavefunction characteristics, the temperature and bias phenomenology closely mirror GaAs systems. In contrast, the parallel magnetic field response differs significantly, confirming the central role of valley degrees of freedom. This opens new pathways to study valley-exchange correlation physics in regimes inaccessible to conventional semiconductors.

Spontaneous breaking of time-reversal and spatial-inversion symmetries in solids triggers diverse intriguing phenomena. Although these phenomena have been extensively studied in insulators, similar investigations for metals remain limited. Herein, we report the observation and properties of spontaneous (i.e., zero-magnetic field) nonreciprocal charge transport in the zigzag intermetallic compound NdRu2Al10. This effect is attributed to the antiferromagnetic (AF) order, which can be interpreted as a magnetic toroidal dipole order. Our results reveal an excessively large nonreciprocal coefficient for this material, attributed to the strong effective magnetic field generated through c-f exchange interactions. The results also suggest that the nonreciprocal response of this material depends on the spin configurations of the AF domains. Overall, our findings are distinct from those previously reported for field-induced nonreciprocal charge transport and contribute to a comprehensive understanding of cross-correlations in symmetry-broken metals.

Implementation of neuromorphic hardware is a promising way to improve the computing efficiency and decrease the energy consumption of artificial neural networks. For this purpose, electronic elements emulating the behavior of synapses and neurons have to be developed. In order to realize electronic artificial neurons, threshold resistive switches or memristors can be efficiently used. One of the most widespread materials for threshold switches is vanadium dioxide due to its property to demonstrate the metal-insulator transition at a temperature about 70 °C. However, the processes of VO$_{2}$ synthesis are quite restrictive in temperature and gas atmosphere conditions, which hinders its integration into CMOS fabrication. In this work, we propose a new method of VO$_{2}$ synthesis: reactive pulsed laser deposition from metallic V target in oxygen atmosphere at room temperature, followed by vacuum annealing. Our method enables target synthesis of an appropriate VO$_{2}$ phase in a polycrystalline thin film form by finely tuning oxygen pressure during room temperature deposition, which allows to relax the equipment demands, such as high temperature heating in oxygen. Successful targeted VO$_{2}$ synthesis under fabrication conditions close to back-end-of-line CMOS production, achieved in this work, show the way toward its large-scale microelectronic integration for neuromorphic hardware creation.

We study the relaxation dynamics at criticality in the one-dimensional spin-$1/2$ Nagle-Kardar model, where short- and long-range interactions can compete. The phase diagram of this model shows lines of first and second-order phase transitions, separated by a tricritical point. We consider Glauber dynamics, focusing on the slowing-down of the magnetization $m$ both along the critical line and at the tricritical point. Starting from the master equation and performing a coarse-graining procedure, we obtain a Fokker-Planck equation for $m$ and the fraction of defects. Using central manifold theory, we analytically show that $m$ decays asymptotically as $t^{-1/2}$ along the critical line, and as $t^{-1/4}$ at the tricritical point. This result implies that the dynamical critical exponent is $z=2$, proving that the macroscopic critical dynamics of the Nagle-Kardar model falls within the dynamic universality class of purely relaxational dynamics with a non-conserved order parameter (model A). Large deviation techniques enable us to show that the average first passage time between local equilibrium states follows an Arrhenius law.

Halide perovskites have emerged in the last decade as a new important class of semiconductors for a variety of optoelectronic applications. A lot of previous studies were thus devoted to the characterisation of their point defects. Positron annihilation spectroscopy is a well recognized tool for probing vacancies in materials. Recent applications of this technique to APbX$_3$ halide perovskites are sparse, and the rare theoretical predictions of positron lifetimes in these materials, published in association with experiments, do not fully agree with each other. These works suggest that vacancies on the A site are not detected.
  In our theoretical study we focus on the role of the electron-positron correlation functional. We thoroughly revisit and compare several approximations when applied to methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI$_3$) with or without vacancies, as well as inorganic perovskites CsPbI$_3$ and CsPbBr$_3$, in various phases. We show also the relationship between the size of the voids, through Voronoi volumes, and the calculated lifetimes. For the cubic phases we investigate in detail the role of polymorphism, including the distribution of vacancy formation energies and positron annihilation lifetimes.
  In our lifetimes calculations, apart from older and more recent semi-local approximations for the electron-positron correlation potential, we also consider the weighted density approximation (WDA), which is truly non-local and should better describe positron annihilation in regions with strong electronic density variations. We show that for this class of materials, and especially for cations vacancies, the influence of the chosen approximation is crucial, much stronger than in metals, alloys and conventional semiconductors. This influence may induce to reconsider the interpretation of experimentally determined lifetimes.

The quantum electrodynamic Araki-Sucher correction arising from the interaction between electrons and nuclei is calculated for rovibrational energy levels of the hydrogen molecule and its isotopologues. The corresponding expectation value $\langle r_{en}^{-3}\rangle$ is evaluated across a wide range of internuclear distances using the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. The electronic wave function is represented as a linear combination of explicitly correlated Gaussian basis functions. This correction contributes approximately tenths of a megahertz (about $10^{-5}$cm$^{-1}$) to the dissociation energy of rovibrational levels and to the transitions between them. Given recent spectroscopic measurements with an accuracy of 10 kHz, this correction is necessary to achieve sub-MHz agreement between theory and experiment.

Hydrothermal synthesis offers an economical and scalable way to produce nanodiamonds under relatively mild, low-pressure and low-temperature conditions. However,its sustainability and the detailed mechanisms behind diamond formation in such environments are still not fully understood. In this work, we designed ten hydrothermal synthesis protocols using different CHO-based molecular precursors containing COOH and OH groups, such as organic acids, polyols, sugars, and polysaccharides.The reactions were carried out at 190 degrees Centigrade in chlorinated, strongly alkaline aqueous solutions with alkali and alkaline-earth metal ions. Using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, we confirmed the presence of diamond-specific lattice planes and sp3-hybridized carbon structures. Our results show that the type of precursor, its molecular size, and the ionic composition of the solution play key roles in determining the defect patterns and polymorph distribution in the resulting nanodiamonds. Atomic-scale imaging showed both coherent and incoherent transitions from graphite to diamond, along with gradual lattice compression and complex twinning patterns. These observations provide direct insight into how interfacial crystallography and defect dynamics drive diamond formation in aqueous systems. Overall, the study positions hydrothermal synthesis as a sustainable, chemistry-driven, and tunable approach for creating nanodiamonds tailored for applications in quantum technologies, biomedicine, catalysis, and advanced materials.

- **TL;DR**: 通过磁传输、法拉第角旋转和磁圆二色性测量，发现NiI₂的磁激发谱更符合Kitaev自旋模型而非先前提出的螺旋自旋框架，表明vdW多铁材料中存在Kitaev物理。

Bond-dependent magnetic interactions, particularly those described by the Kitaev model, have emerged as a key pathway toward realizing unconventional magnetic states such as quantum spin liquids and topologically nontrivial excitations, including skyrmions. These interactions frustrate conventional magnetic order and give rise to rich collective behavior that continues to challenge both theory and experiment. While Kitaev physics has been extensively explored in the context of honeycomb magnets, direct evidence for its role in real materials remains scarce. Magnetic van der Waals (vdW) materials have emerged as a versatile platform for exploring low-dimensional electrical, magnetic, and correlated electronic phenomena, and provide a fertile ground for potential applications ranging from spintronics to multiferroic devices and quantum information technologies. Here, we demonstrate, through magneto-transmission, Faraday angle rotation, and magnetic circular dichroism measurements, that the magnetic excitation spectrum of NiI$_2$, a van der Waals multiferroic material, is more accurately captured by a Kitaev-based spin model than by the previously invoked helical spin framework.

- **TL;DR**: 在拓扑半金属CoSi中观察到维德曼-弗朗兹定律的显著违反，电子洛伦兹数比索末菲值高出约40%，这源于拓扑能带诱导的电子-空穴补偿导致的强双极扩散输运。

The Wiedemann-Franz (WF) law, relating the electronic thermal conductivity ($κ_{\rm e}$) to the electrical conductivity, is vital in numerous applications such as in the design of thermoelectric materials and in the experimental determination of the lattice thermal conductivity ($κ_{\rm L}$). While the WF law is generally robust, violations are frequently observed, typically manifesting in a reduced Lorenz number ($L$) relative to the Sommerfeld value ($L_0$) due to inelastic scattering. Here, we report a pronounced departure from the WF law in the topological semimetal CoSi, where the electronic Lorenz number ($L_{\rm e}$) instead rises up to $\sim40\%$ above $L_0$. We demonstrate that this anomaly arises from strong bipolar diffusive transport, enabled by topological band-induced electron-hole compensation, which allows electrons and holes to flow cooperatively and additively enhance the heat current. Concurrently, we unveil that the lattice contribution to thermal conductivity is anomalously large and becomes the dominant component below room temperature. As a result, if $κ_{\rm L}$ is assumed negligible -- as conventional in metals, the resulting $L$ from the total thermal conductivity ($κ_{\rm tot}=κ_{\rm L}+κ_{\rm e}$) deviates from $L_0$ by more than a factor of three. Our work provides deeper insight into the unconventional thermal transport physics in topological semimetals.

The Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition is an archetypal example of a topological phase transition, which is driven by the proliferation of vortices. In this Letter, we analyze the persistence of the BKT transition in the XY model under the influence of long-range algebraically decaying interactions of the form $\sim 1/{r^{2+σ}}$. The model hosts a magnetized low temperature phase for sufficiently small $σ$. Crucially, in the presence of long-range interactions, spin waves renormalize the interaction between vortices, which stabilizes the BKT transition. As a result, we find that there is no direct transition from the magnetized to the disordered phase and that the BKT transition persists for arbitrary long-range exponents, which is distinct from previous results. We use both Landau-Peierls-type arguments and renormalization group calculations - including a coupling between spin wave and topological excitations - and obtain similar results. We emphasize that Landau-Peierls-type arguments are a powerful tool for analyzing continuous spin models. We discuss the relevance of our findings for current Rydberg atom experiments, and highlight the importance of long-range couplings for other types of topological defects.

The manufacturing processes of heterostructures determine the structure and properties of their interfaces. In this work, we simulate PbTe and PbSe heterostructures manufactured via (1) direct wave bonding and (2) heteroepitaxial growth. The former contains interfaces with 2D misfit dislocation networks while the latter contains complex 3D networks with both misfit and threading dislocations. To compute the surface energy of interfaces, we measure the interaction energy across surfaces using a well-verified code. Compared with hypothetical interfaces modeled to be coherent, a typical assumption in traditional slab-based methods, the surface energy of wafer bonded and epitaxially grown interfaces are significantly different. Semi-coherent interfaces exhibit up to ~27% lower surface energies than coherent ones, while coherent models overestimate surface energies by up to ~50% relative to epitaxial interfaces. The consequence of such differences can lead to conflicting predictions of physical phenomena such as fracture toughness or growth mode.

Robust model predictive control (MPC) aims to preserve performance under model-plant mismatch, yet robust formulations for nonlinear MPC (NMPC) with data-driven surrogates remain limited. This work proposes an offset-free robust NMPC scheme based on symbolic regression (SR). Using a compact NARX structure, we identify interpretable surrogate models that explicitly represent epistemic (structural) uncertainty at the operating-zone level, and we enforce robustness by embedding these models as hard constraints. gest margins. The single-zone variant (RNMPC$_{SZ}$) was investigated. Synthetic data were generated within one operating zone to identify SR models that are embedded as constraints, while the nominal predictor remains fixed, and the multi-zone variant (RNMPC$_{MZ}$), zone-specific SR models from multiple operating zones are jointly enforced in the constraint set; at each set-point change, the nominal predictor is re-scheduled to the SR model of the newly active zone. In both cases, robustness is induced by the intersection of the admissible sets defined by the enforced SR models, without modifying the nominal cost or introducing ancillary tube dynamics. The approach was validated on a simulated pilot-scale electric submersible pump (ESP) system with pronounced nonlinearities and dynamically varying safety envelopes (downthrust and upthrust). RNMPC$_{SZ}$ and RNMPC$_{MZ}$ maintained disturbance tracking and rejection, and by intersecting models in the constraints, they increased margins and eliminated violations (especially near the upthrust), with a slight increase in settling time. Including up to four models per zone did not increase the time per iteration, maintaining real-time viability; RNMPC$_{MZ}$ presented the lar

Scattering processes by the interface roughness in a quantum well in a quantizing magnetic field are considered. An expression for the scattering rate is derived for a magnetic field tilted relative to the quantum well layers. By analyzing this expression, trends in the behavior of the scattering rate are established with variation in the magnetic field strength and orientation, the potential profile of the quantum well, and the interface roughness parameters.

We investigate displacive short-range order in pyrochlore Y2Nb2O7, which exhibits a nonmagnetic insulating state despite the presence of formally tetravalent Nb4+ (S = 1/2) ions on the pyrochlore network. Synchrotron x-ray diffraction on a single crystal reveals a characteristic x-ray diffuse scattering (XDS) pattern primarily around q = {0.5, 0.5, 2}. Reverse Monte Carlo (RMC) simulations uncover local Nb displacements along the &lt;111&gt; axes, leading to the formation of linear Nb4 tetramers. Our findings highlight a crucial role of molecular orbital degrees of freedom in stabilizing the nonmagnetic insulating state. This study demonstrates that RMC analysis of XDS provides a powerful approach for elucidating short-range correlations and the underlying mechanisms governing the physical properties of crystalline materials.

### Magnetic and structural properties of epitaxial Er-substituted yttrium iron garnet films grown by pulsed laser deposition

Er-substituted yttrium iron garnet (Er:YIG) holds the potential of combining the low magnetic damping of YIG with the telecom-band optical transitions of $\text{Er}^{3+}$ ions, making it a suitable material for hybrid optomagnonic devices and microwave-to-optical quantum transduction. We report the epitaxial growth of $\text{Er}_{x}\text{Y}_{3-x}\text{Fe}_{5}\text{O}_{12}$ films with $x=0.008-0.20$ on (111)-oriented gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG) substrates using pulsed laser deposition. X-ray diffraction, reciprocal space mapping, and scanning transmission electron microscopy confirm single-phase, fully coherent growth with atomically sharp interfaces across the entire substitution range. Magnetometry reveals a gradual decrease in saturation magnetization with increasing Er content, consistent with antiparallel coupling between Er$^{3+}$ spins and the net Fe$^{3+}$ moments, along with the emergence of an in-plane uniaxial magnetic anisotropy. The ferromagnetic resonance broadens with Er concentration due to increased Gilbert damping and inhomogeneous linewidth broadening. Films with low Er content ($x=0.008$), most relevant for optomagnonic applications, retain nearly isotropic magnetization and exhibit a damping parameter only slightly higher than that of undoped YIG. These results identify growth and substitution conditions that preserve YIG's low-loss magnetic properties while introducing optical functionality, establishing Er:YIG as a viable platform for hybrid quantum magnonics and microwave-to-optical transduction.

The prohibition of finite-temperature phase transition in one-dimensional (1D) Ising models and 1D/2D quantum Heisenberg models with short-range interactions fundamentally constrains the application potentials of low-dimensional magnetic materials. Recently, ultranarrow phase crossover (UNPC), which can approach a transition at a desirable finite temperature $T_0$ arbitrarily closely, was discovered in 1D decorated Ising chains and ladders. Here we present a theoretical study of similarly decorated, yet much more challenging, quantum Heisenberg ferrimagnets in a magnetic field, which features ferromagnetic backbone exchange $J$, antiferromagnetic site-decoration coupling $J_{AF}$, and different magnetic moments for the backbone and decorating spins $μ_aS_a&lt;μ_bS_b$. We exactly solved the model in the large $J$ limit -- as a central-macrospin model -- and found two finite-temperature second-order transitions; just above $T_{c2}$ a ``half-ice, half-fire'' regime appears. Finite-$J$ weak-field results follow from an effective-field mapping, suggesting the emergence of UNPC at finite $T_0$ in 2D square lattices thanks to its exponentially strong initial magnetic susceptibility $χ_0\propto e^{4πS_a^2 J/T_0}$, though less likely in 1D chains where $χ_0\propto J/T_0$. These results may shed light on new technological applications of low-dimensional quantum spin systems and attract experimental and computational tests.

- **TL;DR**: 本文揭示了斯格明子形成的两阶段动力学过程，建立了与平衡相的关联，并通过符号回归和神经网络推导出斯格明子形成判据。

We uncover a universal two-stage dynamics during skyrmion formation and establish its connection to equilibrium phases through the introduction of a chiral correlation $χ$. Stage I involves stripe coarsening governed by the exchange-to-DMI ratio $J'$, while stage II entails stripe contraction driven by the synergy between $J'$ and the anisotropy-to-DMI ratio $K'$. The magnetic field-to-DMI ratio $B'$ influences both stages. By combining symbolic regression with neural networks, we model the competition and cooperation among these parameters and derive a skyrmion formation criterion, $0.58 K'J' + μB'J' &gt; 1$. Our model disentangles their distinct roles: $J'$ sets the stripe width, $K'$ primarily controls the skyrmion size, and $B'$ strongly affects the topological charge. This approach provides a general framework for predicting and controlling magnetic phases in chiral magnets.

Light-matter interaction in frustrated Kagome metals enables access to hidden quantum states, yet the microscopic origin of symmetry breaking under ultrafast excitation remains elusive. Here, we uncover a microscopic mechanism for laser-induced symmetry breaking in RbV3Sb5 through first-principles real-time simulations. Selective excitation of a single-QM phonon mode dynamically breaks both rotational and time-reversal symmetries within the 2X2X1 charge density wave (CDW) superlattice. The resulting anisotropic lattice distortion lifts geometric frustration and stabilizes a nonequilibrium ferrimagnetic phase, accompanied by a sizable intrinsic anomalous Hall effect. Distinct from prior interpretations based on orbital antiferromagnetism or extrinsic perturbations, our findings reveal a spin-driven pathway for symmetry breaking under strong optical fields. These results provide a microscopic foundation for exploring how spin, lattice and charge degrees of freedom are intertwined in nonequilibrium correlated states.

- **TL;DR**: 通过实验和理论计算研究氢在超薄钒薄膜中的吸收行为，发现50nm薄膜呈现类似块体的相变行为，而10nm薄膜则显示连续吸收且相变临界温度降低，界面电子结构影响氢结合能。

We report combined experimental and first principles investigations of hydrogen absorption in epitaxial vanadium films on MgO(001) with nominal thicknesses of 10 nm and 50 nm. In - situ optical transmission and four - probe resistance isotherms show that the 50 nm film reproduces bulk like behavior with a clear first order alpha-beta hydride transition, the formation enthalpy and entropy gradually decrease with increasing hydrogen concentration. The 10 nm film, by contrast, displays continuous uptake without plateaus, with formation enthalpies H that are relatively close in magnitude to the 50 nm film (both exhibiting exothermic behavior in the range of approximately 0.5 to 0.3 eV/H), but with a more negative entropy change S (larger S) indicating reduced configurational freedom for hydrogen in the ultrathin limit; the critical temperature for phase coexistence is suppressed below 400 K. Density functional theory calculations on MgO V superlattices (Vn/(MgO)n, n = 3,5,7) reveal pronounced V 3d and O 2p hybridization and interfacial charge redistribution that weaken hydrogen binding near the interface and recover toward bulk values with increasing V thickness. These results indicate that interfacial electronic structure, in addition to finite size energetics, governs hydride stability in ultrathin V films and that layer - thickness and interface engineering can tune reversible hydrogen uptake.

Numerical simulations of strongly correlated fermions at finite temperature are essential for studying high-temperature superconductivity and other quantum many-body phenomena. The recently developed tangent-space tensor renormalization group (tanTRG) provides an efficient and accurate framework by representing thermal density operators as matrix product operators. However, the particle number generally varies during the cooling process. The conventional strategy of fine-tuning chemical potentials to reach a target filling is computationally demanding. Here we propose a fixed-$N$ tanTRG algorithm that stabilizes the average particle number by adaptively tuning the chemical potential within the imaginary-time evolution. We benchmark its accuracy on exactly solvable free fermions, and further apply it to the square-lattice Hubbard model. For hole-doped cases, we study the temperature evolution of charge and spin correlations, identifying several characteristic temperature scales for stripe formation. Our results establish fixed-$N$ tanTRG as an efficient and reliable tool for finite-temperature studies of correlated fermion systems.

It is further employed in density-potential inversion schemes and, through the choice of topology for the density and potential space, can be directly linked to classical field theories. This perspective collects various appearances of the regularization technique within density-functional theory alongside possibilities for their future development.

We study the thermal transport properties of a mesoscopic device comprising two metallic islands embedded in a two-dimensional electron gas in the integer quantum Hall regime. It is shown that the $2M$ ballistic edge channels connecting the islands to the external reservoirs and the $N$ inter-island channels play a central role in the phenomenon of heat Coulomb blockade. Unlike the single-island case, where the heat flux is reduced by exactly one quantum of thermal conductance, we predict an additional suppression proportional to the factor $M^2/(2N+M)^2$. We further examine a configuration in which the islands are placed between electrodes at different temperatures and identify the conditions under which the Wiedemann-Franz law is violated.

The nature of the intermediate ground-state phase in the spin-1/2 frustrated square lattice model has long been debated. Using cluster density matrix embedding theory, we investigate the phase diagram of this model. The Neel phase is directly identified for J2&lt;0.45 and the collinear phase for J2&gt;0.65 based on the ground state. Although no direct evidence of an internal phase transition is found within the intermediate phase from the ground state, analysis of the first excited state wave function reveals a continuous quantum phase transition in this region, with a critical point at J2=0.55. This critical point divides the intermediate phase into PVBS and CVBS.

Both compounds exhibit significant spontaneous polarization and indirect band gaps of $\sim$ 1.8 eV, well suited for visible-light absorption ($&gt;$10$^5$ cm$^{-1}$). Low carrier effective masses along the polar axis indicate efficient charge transport. \textit{Ab initio} molecular dynamics simulations (AIMD) show that polarization-coupled magnetization switching is feasible above room temperature, making these materials suitable for room-temperature applications.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究构建了0D/1D S型异质结（IVO/CTFO），通过Cu掺杂、晶格应变和氧空位等多重协同效应，解决了CO2光还原中*CO脱附动力学瓶颈和电荷分离效率低的问题，实现了高效CO产率和选择性。

The catalytic CO2 photoreduction to CO is significantly hindered by the pervasive kinetic bottleneck of *CO-desorption and inefficient charge separation. Surpassing the conventional single photocatalytic strategy, herein, a multi-synergetic 0D/1D S-scheme heterojunction by precisely assembling 0D InVO4 nanoparticles on 1D Cu-doped TbFeO3 (IVO/CTFO). This nano-heterojunction is rationally designed at multiple steps where Cu2+ substitution at the Fe3+ site induces a compression in lattice strain and oxygen vacancies (VO), acting as electron traps and CO2 chemisorption sites, which breaks spin-polarization of pristine TbFeO3 to facilitate multichannel charge flow. The 0D/1D strategy couples the maximum surface active-sites and short charge diffusion routes with directional charge migration. Moreover, a 0D/1D lattice mismatch creates a built-in electric field at the interface, resulting in an enhanced lifetime (64.70 ns) of charged species, an efficient CO yield (65.75 mmole g-1.h-1), and high selectivity (95.93%). DFT calculations and experimental findings confirmed the Fermi level shift toward the conduction band and the existence of spin-hybridization. Operando-DRIFTS and the free-energy diagram unveil a H+ mediated mechanism at the interface, alongside a reduction in energy barrier for CO2 photoreduction from *COOH to *CO. Thus, this study presents an excellent approach that integrates defect-engineering, strain-compression, and interfacial design in advancing solar fuels production.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究在石墨烯上通过氢原子吸附实现了自旋-1/2之间的超长程交换耦合，在超过10纳米距离上达到3 meV的交换强度，超越了所有先前系统。

Magnetic interactions between localized spins-1/2 play a central role in quantum magnetism, spin-based quantum computing, and quantum simulation. The range and strength of these interactions are key figures of merit. Here, we probe exchange interactions in pairs and trimers of spins-1/2 introduced by chemisorption of individual hydrogen atoms on graphene. Using scanning tunneling microscopy and inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy, supported by large-scale mean-field Hubbard calculations, we demonstrate 3 meV exchange couplings at separations beyond 10 nm, surpassing all prior systems. The couplings can be ferro- or antiferromagnetic depending on the relative sublattice arrangement. Real-space mapping of spin excitation amplitudes enables characterization with atomic-resolution. Through atomic manipulation we extend this control to spin trimers, revealing collective spin excitations when pairwise exchange couplings are comparable.

Various techniques can be employed to determine the temperature of magnetic transformation, whether it be the Curie or Neel temperature. The standard procedure typically involves creating alloys with defined compositions and performing measurements experimentally. Alternatively, these temperatures can be predicted based on a material known physical and chemical properties prior to experiments. We identified an optimal feature set and selected the most effective algorithm. Our findings show that the Voting Ensemble model, when combined with Monte Carlo cross-validation, achieves the highest prediction accuracy. The normalized root mean squared error serves as the primary performance metric. For implementation, we utilize the Azure Machine Learning framework for its robust computational and integration capabilities. This approach offers an efficient and reliable strategy for designing and predicting the Curie temperature of ternary alloys. The paper also highlights potential applications of the model and its extensions for other systems.

- **TL;DR**: QET是一种电荷感知的等变架构，通过可解析求解的电荷平衡方案实现线性缩放，解决了传统基础势函数在电荷转移系统中准确建模静电相互作用的问题。

Electrostatics govern charge transfer and reactivity in materials. Yet, most foundation potentials (FPs) either do not explicitly model such interactions or pay a prohibitive scaling penalty to do so. Here, we introduce charge-equilibrated TensorNet (QET), an equivariant, charge-aware architecture that attains linear scaling with system size via an analytically solvable charge-equilibration scheme. We demonstrate that a trained QET FP matches state-of-the-art FPs on standard materials property benchmarks but delivers qualitatively different predictions in systems dominated by charge transfer. The QET FP reproduces the correct structure and density of the NaCl-CaCl2 ionic liquid, which charge-agnostic FPs miss. We further show that a fine-tuned QET captures reactive processes at the Li/Li6PS5Cl solid-electrolyte interface and supports simulations under applied electrochemical potentials. These results remove a fundamental constraint in the atomistic simulation of accurate electrostatics at scale and establish a general, data-driven framework for charge-aware FPs with transformative applications in energy storage, catalysis, and beyond.

- **TL;DR**: 研究了双层石墨烯晶体管在亚太赫兹辐射下的光电压产生机制，发现主要来源于p-n结的热电效应，并观察到0.13 THz的二维等离子体激元共振。

We present a combined experimental and theoretical study of photovoltage generation in a bilayer graphene (BLG) transistor structure exposed to subterahertz radiation. The device features a global bottom and split top gate, enabling independent control of the band gap and Fermi level, thereby enabling the formation of a tunable p-n junction in graphene. Measurements show that the photovoltage arises primarily through a thermoelectric mechanism driven by heating of the p-n junction in the middle of the channel. We also provide a theoretical justification for the excitation of two-dimensional plasmons at a record-low frequency of 0.13 THz, which manifests itself as characteristic oscillations in the measured photovoltage. These plasmonic resonances, activated by a decrease in charge carrier concentration due to opening of the band gap, lead to a local enhancement of the electromagnetic field and an increase in the carrier temperature in the junction region. The record-low frequency of plasmon resonance is enabled by the low carrier density achievable in the bilayer graphene upon electrical induction of the band gap.

We report the crystal growth, structure, physical properties, and first-principles calculations of a vanadium-based oxytelluride Cs$_{1-δ}$V$_2$Te$_2$O. The material possesses two-dimensional V$_2$O square nets sandwiched by tellurium layers, with local crystallographic symmetry satisfying the spin symmetry for a $d$-wave altermagnet. An antiferromagnetic transition at 293 K is unambiguously evidenced from the measurements of magnetic susceptibility and specific heat. In addition, a secondary transition at $\sim$70 K is also observed, possibly associated with a Lifshitz transition. The first-principles calculations indicate robust Néel-type collinear antiferromagnetism in the V$_2$O plane. Consequently, spin splittings show up in momentum space, in relation with the real-space mirror/rotation symmetry. Interestingly, the V-$d_{yz}/d_{xz}$ electrons, which primarily contribute the quasi-one-dimensional Fermi surface, turns out to be fully orbital- and spin-polarized, akin to the case of a half metal. Our work lays a solid foundation on the potential applications utilizing altermagnetic properties in vanadium-based oxychalcogenides.

We present an analytical framework that predicts and controls nanoparticle size through external magnetic fields, uniting first-principles thermodynamics with a sphere packing approach. Calibrated to diamagnetic silver nanoparticles (20 nm at zero field and 5 nm at 250 mT), the model yields a closed-form relation between radius and field that reproduces the observed shift in most-probable size. Within the limits of classical capillarity and spherical demagnetization, the field lowers the nucleation barrier and drives the distribution toward smaller particles. Our results are robust for radii above 3 nm (5740 atoms). Below this scale non-extensive effects likely dominate, as discussed in detail in Supplementary Information. The approach generalizes to both diamagnetic and paramagnetic systems and the limitations expected for very small or ferromagnetically ordered nanoparticles are discussed.

- **TL;DR**: KV2Se2O在高压下发生金属-绝缘体转变，形成磁性受阻原子绝缘体，这是首个与结构变化解耦的压力驱动金属-绝缘体转变案例。

Among the complex many-body systems, the metal-insulator transition stands out as a cornerstone and a particularly fertile ground for scientific inquiry. The established models including Mott insulator, Anderson localization and Peierls transition, are still insufficient to capture the complex and intertwined phenomena observed in certain material systems. KV2Se2O, a newly discovered room-temperature altermagnetic candidate exhibiting a spin-density-wave transition below 100 K, provides a unique platform to investigate the interplay of many-body effects and unconventional magnetism, specifically the anticipated metal-insulator transition under extreme conditions. Here, we report a compression-induced insulator by suppressing the metallic behavior without structural phase transition. The newly opened gap is estimated to be 40 meV at around 43.5 GPa, given direct evidence for the insulating state. A concurrent switching of carrier type demonstrates the large Fermi surface reconstruction crossing the metal-insulator transition. The density functional theory calculations indicate that the discovered V+2.5-based insulator is a magnetic obstructed atomic insulator, being a spin-singlet state with bonding orbital order. This work not only presents an archetype of a pressure-driven metal-insulator transition decoupled from structural change but also delivers fundamental physical insights into the metal-insulator transition.

### Density-dependent sodium-storage mechanisms in hard carbon materials

- **TL;DR**: 该研究通过多尺度模拟方法揭示了硬碳密度对钠存储机制的影响，发现中等密度硬碳(1.3-1.6 g cm⁻³)具有最佳平衡性能。

Understanding the sodium-storage mechanism in hard carbon (HC) anodes is crucial for advancing sodium-ion battery (SIB) technology. However, the intrinsic complexity of HC microstructures and their interactions with sodium remains poorly understood. We present a multiscale methodology that integrates grand-canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations with a machine-learning interatomic potential based on the Gaussian approximation potential (GAP) framework to investigate sodium insertion mechanisms in hard carbons with densities ranging from 0.7 to 1.9 g cm$^{-3}$. Structural and thermodynamic analyses reveal that increasing carbon density reduces pore size and accessibility, thereby modulating the relative contributions of adsorption, intercalation, and pore filling to the overall storage capacity. Low-density carbons favor pore-filling, achieving extremely high capacities at near-zero voltages, whereas high-density carbons primarily store sodium through adsorption and intercalation, leading to lower but more stable capacities. Intermediate-density carbons ($1.3-1.6$ g cm$^{-3}$) provide the most balanced performance, combining moderate capacity ($\approx 400$ mAh g$^{-1}$), safe operating voltages, and minimal volume expansion ($&lt;10$\%). These findings establish a direct correlation between carbon density and electrochemical behavior, providing atomic-scale insight into how hard carbon morphology governs sodium-storage. The proposed framework offers a rational design principle for optimizing HC-based SIB anodes toward high energy density and long-term cycling stability.

- **TL;DR**: 在半导体中实现了相距达40微米的电子-核自旋振荡器的远程同步，通过自旋扩散实现耦合，当距离超过扩散长度时同步失效。

Synchronization resulting in unified collective behavior of the individual elements of a system that are weakly coupled to each other has long fascinated scientists. Examples range from the periodic oscillation of coupled pendulum clocks to the rhythmic behavior in biological systems. Here we demonstrate this effect in a solid-state platform: spatially remote, auto-oscillating electron-nuclear spin systems in a semiconductor. When two such oscillators separated by up to 40 $μ$m are optically pumped, their individually different frequencies lock to a common value, revealing long-range coherent coupling. For larger separations, the synchronization breaks. The interaction distance matches the electron spin diffusion length, identifying spin transport as the coupling-mediating mechanism and establishing phase coherence over mesoscopic distances. As a consequence, a wide-area optical pump drives all oscillators within the illuminated spot into a single synchronized state, despite their inhomogeneity. This synchronization accounts for the exceptional stability of the resulting auto-oscillations, enabling collective motion in distributed spin systems and paving the way toward coherent spin networks in spintronics.

Self-sustained oscillators play a central role in the stabilization and synchronization of complex dynamical systems. A number of different physical systems are currently being investigated to clarify the importance of such active components in the quantum realm. Here we explore the properties of a driven dissipative electron-photon hybrid system based on superconducting microwave resonators coupled resonantly to a voltage-biased double quantum dot (DQD). First, we establish a Hopf bifurcation at a critical value of the electron-photon coupling, beyond which an effective negative friction sustains steady limit-cycle oscillations of individual resonators. Second, we show that two such limit-cycle resonators coupled via the same voltage-biased DQD synchronize for small enough frequency detuning. A nonlinear photon Keldysh action is derived by perturbation theory in the effective circuit fine-structure constant, and the limit-cycle dynamics is analyzed in terms of resulting saddle-point, and Fokker-Planck equations. In the Markovian limit of infinite bias voltage, these results are shown to agree well with the solution of a corresponding Lindblad master equation for the DQD resonator system.

Comprehensive study using DC transport, specific heat, magnetization, and two-coil mutual inductance measurements unveils an understanding of three temperature regimes in SmB$_6$: (i) $T \geq T^{*}$ ($\sim66$K), (ii) $T_g$ ($\sim40$ K) $\leq T &lt; T^{*}$, and (iii) $T &lt; T_g$. Onset of Kondo breakdown below $T^{*}$ releases disorder-driven magnetic fluctuations, which splits the bulk ($\sim116$K) and surface Kondo temperature ($T_k^{s} \approx 7$ K). Below $T_g$, as magnetic fluctuations subside, surface Kondo screening revives, stabilizing the topological surface state and generating an in-gap feature ($\sim2.2$ meV) across which Dirac-like carriers are excited. Nyquist impedance analysis reveals a crossover from purely capacitive to capacitive-inductive behavior, signalling a disorder-driven two-fluid phase of heavy quasiparticles and light, high-mobility carriers below $T_g$. We identify a characteristic length scale, $L_{ν_0}(T)$, associated with the high-mobility phase, exhibiting an almost divergent trend below $T_k^{s}$. These findings underscore the complex nature of the surface conducting state in SmB$_6$.

- **TL;DR**: 提出首个采用互补和非对称锥形欧拉弯曲的中红外波导阵列设计，在3.1-3.6微米波长范围内实现亚波长间距集成，并将串扰降至30 dB以下。

This paper delivers the first report of a mid-infrared (MIR) waveguide array design that employs complementary and asymmetric tapered Euler-shaped bends. These provide greater fabrication flexibility to achieve subwavelength-pitch integration while reducing crosstalk to below 30 dB across the 3.1 to 3.6 micron wavelength range. Unlike previous designs, which maintained constant waveguide widths, the Euler waveguide bends are characterized by asymmetric and complementary tapered waveguide widths. This approach significantly reduces crosstalk to below 30 dB for both the first and second neighboring waveguides across a 500 nm wavelength range, enhancing the efficiency of optical phased arrays (OPA) with a large field of view, optimizing light propagation and minimizing crosstalk. The waveguide array is fabricated on a silicon-on-insulator platform, with a 2-micron buried oxide layer and a 500 nm-thick silicon layer. The design is highly tolerant to fabrication variations, maintaining consistent performance even with width variations. The spectral responses, simulated using the 3D finite-difference time-domain method, demonstrate negligible coupling and low insertion loss across the wavelength range. This work offers a robust and CMOS-compatible solution for MIR integrated photonic circuits.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文通过结合DFT+U和Anderson杂质模型精确对角化方法，成功解决了CeCo5中Ce中间价态导致的传统DFT方法失效问题，准确预测了其磁性和磁各向异性。

The intermediate valence of Ce in CeCo$_5$ challenges standard density functional theory (DFT) and static DFT+$U$ approaches, which fail to capture its magnetic properties. By combining DFT+$U$ with exact diagonalization of the Anderson impurity model for the Ce 4$f$ shell, we find a substantial reduction of Ce spin and orbital moments, consistent with DFT+DMFT, arising from Ce$^{4+}$ - Ce$^{3+}$ valence fluctuations. The total magnetic moment of 6.70 $μ_B$ agrees with experiment, and the calculated $4f$ density of states reproduces photoemission and Bremsstrahlung isochromat spectra. The uniaxial magnetic anisotropy energy reaches 4.8 meV/f.u. when Coulomb correlations on both Ce 4$f$ and Co 3$d$ shells are included, in very good agreement with experimental data. These results highlight the importance of dynamical correlations and provide guidance for exploring high-performance, low-rare-earth-content permanent magnets.

In this study, we demonstrate an improved version of the roll-to-roll mechanical exfoliation method, incorporating a controlled sliding motion into the exfoliation process to achieve uniform nanosheet films of two-dimensional materials at wafer-scale. This scalable technique enables the fabrication of high-quality films suitable for electronic and optoelectronic applications. We validate the process by fabricating WSe2 phototransistors directly on the exfoliated films, achieving performance metrics comparable to the best reported devices based on electrochemically exfoliated material. The all-dry transfer method employed ensures minimal contamination and preserves the intrinsic properties of the material. This work highlights the potential of high-throughput mechanical exfoliation as a cost-effective and reliable route for large-scale production of 2D material-based devices.

Magnetotransport underlines many important phenomena in condensed matter physics, such as the Hall effect and magnetoresistance (MR) effect. Thus far, most magnetotransport studies are based on bulk resistance measurements without direct access to microscopic details of the spatial transport pattern. Here, we report nanoscale imaging of magnetotransport using a scanning single-spin quantum magnetometer, which is demonstrated in a graphene-metal hybrid device at room temperature. By visualizing the current flow at elevated magnetic fields (~0.5 T), we directly observe the Lorentz deflection of current near the graphene-metal interface, which is a hallmark of magnetotransport. Combining the local current distribution with global resistance measurements, we reveal that transport properties of the hybrid are governed by a complex interplay of intrinsic MR around the Dirac cone, carrier hydrodynamics, interface resistance, and the nanoscale device geometry. Furthermore, accessing the local transport pattern across the interface enables quantitative mapping of spatial variations in contact resistance, which is commonly present in electronic devices made from two-dimensional materials yet non-trivial to characterize. Our work demonstrates the potential of nanoscale current imaging techniques for studying complex electronic transport phenomena that are difficult to probe by resistance-based measurements.

We investigate uniaxial-stress effects on the magnetic phase diagram of the square-lattice itinerant magnet EuAl$_{4}$, where strong coupling among spin, lattice, and charge produces a variety of helimagnetic phases, including rhombic and square skyrmion lattices. Combining resistivity and magnetization measurements with neutron scattering, we find that compressive stresses of only several tens of MPa along [010] enhance antiferromagnetic character and shorten the magnetic modulation period in the lowest-temperature single-Q spiral state, thereby driving the critical temperatures and fields of multiple phases to higher values. First-principles calculations show that increasing orthorhombic lattice distortion deforms the Fermi surface relevant to the magnetism, providing compelling evidence that Fermi-surface nesting plays a crucial role in stabilizing the helical magnetic modulations in EuAl$_{4}$.

Stacking faults and other topological defects in ferroics can have a significant influence on the electronic and mechanical properties of the material. Here, regular stacking faults in the tetragonal tungsten bronze material Sr$_2$NaNb$_5$O$_{15}$ are investigated through transmission electron microscopy, symmetry mode analysis and machine-learned force-field calculations. It is shown that the faults, with a fault vector of $\frac{1}{4}[\bar{2}12]_o$, annihilate in sets of four in the material, owing to the $\frac{1}{4}$ unit cell displacement along the b-axis. The four resulting domains emerge as four possible directions of the S$_3$ order parameter, related to NbO$_6$ octahedral tilts in the material. Force-field calculations reveal that the stacking faults are likely placed at positions where the octahedra in neighbouring domains have similar magnitudes of rotation, and that the estimated stacking fault energy is 46 mJ/m$^2$. The investigation shows that the stacking faults have a significant local effect on the polar modes present in the structure, and therefore could affect the ferroelectric properties.

Within the quantum field-theoretical approach describing the evolution of a quadratic Liouvillian in the basis of Keldysh contour coherent states, we investigate the spectral and transport properties of a dissipative superconducting system coupled to normal Fermi reservoirs. We derive a generalization of the Meir-Wingreen formula and Onsager matrix for a superconducting system subject to an arbitrary number of fermionic baths. Following Kirchhoff's rule, we obtain an expression describing the dissipation induced loss current and formulate modified quantum kinetic equations. For wide-band contacts locally coupled to individual sites, we find that each contact reduces the degeneracy multiplicity of the non-equilibrium steady state by one. These results are numerically verified through several cases of the extended Kitaev model at symmetric points with a single contact. Furthermore, in the linear response regime at low temperatures, we demonstrate that (non-)degenerate non-equilibrium steady states correspond to (non-)quantized conductance peaks. Revisiting a paradigmatic problem of resonant transport in the Majorana mode of the Kitaev model we demonstrate that the dissipation accounts for the zero-bias peak suppression and its asymmetry.

- **TL;DR**: 通过电子法布里-珀罗干涉仪研究量子点中的近藤效应，发现近藤屏蔽云的空间延伸与腔体尺寸相当，并揭示了相干输运与近藤效应之间的相互作用。

The Kondo effect emerges when a localized spin is screened by conduction electrons, giving rise to a strongly-correlated many-body ground state. In this work, we investigate this phenomenon in a GaAs/AlGaAs quantum dot, focusing on the spatial extension of the Kondo screening cloud in the electron reservoirs. To probe its properties, the dot is coupled to an electronic Fabry-Pérot interferometer, enabling controlled modulation of the density of states at the Fermi level. The observation of Kondo temperature oscillations indicates a Kondo screening length comparable to the cavity size. Furthermore, we explore how the coupling asymmetry with the two reservoirs affects both the amplitude and the phase of the conductance oscillations, revealing a subtle interplay between coherent transport and Kondo effect.

Slack's phonon-glass and electron-crystal concept has been the guiding paradigm for designing new thermoelectric materials. Zintl phases, in principle, have been shown as great contenders of the concept and thereby good thermoelectric candidates. With this as motivation, we design new Zintl phases SrBaX (X = Si, Ge, Sn) using state-of-the-art computational methods. Herein, we use first-principles simulations to provide key theoretical insights to thermal and electrical transport properties. Some of the key findings of our work feature remarkably low lattice thermal conductivities ($&lt;$~1~W~m$^{-1}$~K$^{-1}$), putting proposed materials among the well-known thermoelectric materials such as SnSe and other contemporary Zintl phases. We ascribe such low values to antibonding states induced weak bonding in the lattice and intrinsically weak phonon transport, resulting in low phonon velocities, short lifetimes, and considerable anharmonic scattering phase spaces. Besides, our results on electronic structure and transport properties reveal tremendous performance of SrBaGe ($ZT\sim$ 2.0 at 700~K), highlighting the relevance among state-of-the-art materials such as SnSe. Further, the similar performances for both $p$- and $n$-type dopings render these materials attractive from device fabrication perspective. We believe that our study would invite experimental investigations for realizing the true thermoelectric potential of SrBaX series.

- **TL;DR**: 光学脉冲可以在有序量子固体中产生类似法拉第波的持久现象，称为法拉第-戈德斯通波，这种光生成的晶体态对热噪声具有鲁棒性。

Faraday waves, typically observed in driven fluids, result from the confluence of nonlinearity and parametric amplification. Here we show that optical pulses can generate analogous phenomena that persist much longer than the pump time-scales in ordered quantum solids. We present a theory of ultrafast light-matter interactions within a symmetry-broken state; dynamical nonlinear coupling between the Higgs (amplitude) and the Goldstone (phase) modes drives an emergent phason texture that oscillates in space and in time: Faraday-Goldstone waves. Calculated signatures of this spatiotemporal order compare well with measurements on K$_{0.3}$MnO$_{3}$; Higgs-Goldstone beating, associated with coherent energy exchange between these two modes, is also predicted. We show this light-generated crystalline state is robust to thermal noise, even when the original Goldstone mode is not. Our results offer a new pathway for the design of periodic structures in quantum materials with ultrafast light pulses.

- **TL;DR**: 基于核岭回归的机器学习框架，使用平均场特征预测一维Hubbard模型的自能，适用于从弱相互作用到强关联的广泛参数范围。

We demonstrate that a machine learning framework based on kernel ridge regression can encode and predict the self-energy of one-dimensional Hubbard models using only mean-field features such as static and dynamic Hartree-Fock quantities and first-order GW calculations. This approach is applicable across a wide range of on-site Coulomb interaction strengths $U/t$, ranging from weakly interacting systems ($U/t \ll 1$) to strong correlations ($U/t &gt; 8$). The predicted self-energy is transformed via Dyson's equation and analytic continuation to obtain the real-frequency Green's function, which allows access to the spectral function and density of states. This method can be used for nearest-neighbor interactions $t$ and long-range hopping terms $t'$, $t''$, and $t'''$.

Electron spectroscopy implemented in electron microscopes provides high spatial resolution, down to the atomic scale, of the chemical, electronic, vibrational and optical properties of materials. In this review, we will describe how temporal coincidence experiments in the nanosecond to femtosecond range between different electron spectroscopies involving photons, inelastic electrons and secondary electrons can provide information bits not accessible to independent spectroscopies. In particular, we will focus on nano-optics applications. The instrumental modifications necessary for these experiments are discussed, as well as the perspectives for these coincidence techniques.

We study diffusive magnetotransport in highly p-doped large area twisted bilayer graphene samples as a function of twist angle, crossing from 1° (below), to 20° (above) the van Hove singularity with 7° and 9° samples near the van Hove singularity. We report weak localization in twisted bilayer graphene for the first time. All samples exhibit weak localization, from which we extract the phase coherence length and intervalley scattering lengths, and from that determine that dephasing is caused by electron-electron scattering and intervalley scattering is caused by point defects. We observe signatures of universal conductance fluctuations in the 9° sample, which has high mobility and is near the van Hove singularity. Further improvements in sample quality and applications to large area moire materials will open new avenues to observe quantum interference effects.

Atomically thin silver (Ag) films offer unique opportunities in plasmonic, quantum optics, and energy harvesting, yet conventional growth methods struggle to achieve structural control at the monolayer limit. Here, we demonstrate phase-selective synthesis of large-area, crystalline 2D Ag films via defect-engineered confinement heteroepitaxy (CHet) at the epitaxial graphene/silicon carbide (EG/SiC) interface. By tuning graphene growth and post-growth defect introduction, two distinct Ag phases are achieved with disparate properties: a nearly commensurate Ag(1) lattice stabilized by vacancy and line defects in epitaxial graphene, and a denser Ag(2) phase preferentially grown with sp3-rich zero-layer graphene. Structural and spectroscopic characterization confirm lattice registry with the SiC substrate, while theoretical calculations reveal a thermodynamic preference for Ag(2) but an easier nucleation for Ag(1). Both phases are found to be semiconducting, with the Ag(2) phase exhibiting slightly enhanced n-doping of graphene. Notably, nonlinear optical measurements reveal a three-order magnitude difference in second-order susceptibility between the two phases, demonstrating promise for phase-tunable 2D metals in reconfigurable optoelectronic and metamaterial platforms.

We introduce an ideal limit of rhombohedral graphene multilayers. In this limit, we show analytically how short-range repulsion stabilizes a layer-pseudospin skyrmion lattice, which generates an effective magnetic field and gives rise to a Chern band. This establishes the real-space origin of interaction-driven topology in moiré rhombohedral graphene. The resulting interaction-induced skyrmion lattice is physically analogous to magnetic skyrmion crystals and hosts a hierarchy of collective excitations naturally described within the framework of skyrmion-lattice dynamics.

We present a framework to characterize Mott insulating phases within the interacting one-body picture, focusing on the Hubbard diamond chain featuring both Hubbard interactions and spin-orbit coupling simulated within cellular dynamical mean field theory. Using symmetry analysis of the single-particle Green's function, we classify spectral functions by irreducible representations at high-symmetry points of the Brillouin zone. Complementarily, we calculate the one-body reduced density matrix which allows us to reach both a qualitative description of charge distribution and an analysis of the state purity. Moreover, within the Tensor Network framework, we employ a Density Matrix Renormalization Group approach to confirm the presence of three distinct phases and their corresponding phase transitions. Our results highlight how symmetry-labelled spectral functions and effective orbital analysis provide accessible single-particle tools for probing correlation-driven insulating phases.

By laser pump-probe time-resolved coherent magnetic X-ray diffraction imaging, we have measured the migration velocity of antiferromagnetic domain walls in the Mott insulator Sr2IrO4 at 100 K. During the laser-induced demagnetization, we observe domain walls moving at 3x10^6 m/s, significantly faster than acoustic velocities. This is understood to arise from a purely electronic spin contribution to the magnetic structure without any role for coupling to the crystal lattice.

### Machine-Learning Accelerated Calculations of Reduced Density Matrices

- **TL;DR**: 使用神经网络架构加速和预测大尺寸系统的n粒子约化密度矩阵(n-RDMs)，通过在小尺寸n-RDMs上训练神经网络来预测大尺寸系统的物理性质。

$n$-particle reduced density matrices ($n$-RDMs) play a central role in understanding correlated phases of matter. Yet the calculation of $n$-RDMs is often computationally inefficient for strongly-correlated states, particularly when the system sizes are large. In this work, we propose to use neural network (NN) architectures to accelerate the calculation of, and even predict, the $n$-RDMs for large-size systems. The underlying intuition is that $n$-RDMs are often smooth functions over the Brillouin zone (BZ) (certainly true for gapped states) and are thus interpolable, allowing NNs trained on small-size $n$-RDMs to predict large-size ones. Building on this intuition, we devise two NNs: (i) a self-attention NN that maps random RDMs to physical ones, and (ii) a Sinusoidal Representation Network (SIREN) that directly maps momentum-space coordinates to RDM values. We test the NNs in three 2D models: the pair-pair correlation functions of the Richardson model of superconductivity, the translationally-invariant 1-RDM in a four-band model with short-range repulsion, and the translation-breaking 1-RDM in the half-filled Hubbard model. We find that a SIREN trained on a $6\times 6$ momentum mesh can predict the $18\times 18$ pair-pair correlation function with a relative accuracy of $0.839$. The NNs trained on $6\times 6 \sim 8\times 8$ meshes can provide high-quality initial guesses for $50\times 50$ translation-invariant Hartree-Fock (HF) and $30\times 30$ fully translation-breaking-allowed HF, reducing the number of iterations required for convergence by up to $91.63\%$ and $92.78\%$, respectively, compared to random initializations. Our results illustrate the potential of using NN-based methods for interpolable $n$-RDMs, which might open a new avenue for future research on strongly correlated phases.

- **TL;DR**: 研究CsGeX3钙钛矿铁电体的畴壁与点缺陷相互作用，发现缺陷与畴壁亲和性弱，畴壁迁移能垒低，适合高频开关应用，但难以实现导电畴壁用于纳米电子学。

Among all-inorganic halide perovskites, the only known ferroelectrics are the family of CsGeX$_3$ (X = Cl, Br, I). Here, we study their ferroelectric domain walls (DWs) and common point defects by density functional theory (DFT) calculations and investigate the interplay between DWs and defects. The most stable defects are V$_{\text{X}}$ and V$_{\text{Cs}}$ and the former shows low migration barriers and high mobility. In contrast to oxide ferroelectrics, the affinity between point defects and DWs is negligible, reflecting the subtle structural distortions at CsGeX$_3$ DWs. Concomitantly, the formation energies and migration energy barriers of CsGeX$_3$ DWs are small compared to oxides, and neither V$_{\text{X}}$ nor V$_{\text{Cs}}$ pin migrating DWs. The band gap invariance across DWs and the lack of affinity towards intrinsic charged point defects imply that conducting DWs for nanoelectronics may be challenging to realise in CsGeX$_3$. However, shallow $p$-type defect levels and low hole effective masses suggest that high $p$-type conductivity may be achievable in nominally ferroelectric CsGeX$_3$. The low DW migration energy barriers and insignificant DW pinning by point defects make CsGeX$_3$ promising materials as robust soft ferroelectrics for high-frequency switching applications with low energy dissipation.

We investigate the quantum phases of higher-spin Kitaev models using tensor network methods. Our results reveal distinct bond-ordered phases for spin-1, spin-$\tfrac{3}{2}$, and spin-2 models. In all cases, we find translational symmetry breaking with unit cells being tripled by forming valence-bond orders. However, these three phases are distinct, forming plaquette order, topological dimer order, and non-topological dimer order, respectively. Our findings are based on a cross-validation between variational two-dimensional tensor network calculations: an unrestricted exploration of symmetry-broken states versus the detection of symmetry breaking from cat-state behavior in symmetry-restricted states. The origin of different orders can also be understood from a theoretical analysis. Our work sheds light upon the interplay between topological and symmetry-breaking orders as well as their detection via tensor networks.

We present a density-functional theory study of the effects of oxygen vacancies on the structural and electronic properties of vanadium dioxide (VO$_2$). Our motivation is the reported suppression of the metal-insulator transition by oxygen vacancies and the lack of a clear consensus on its origin. We use the DFT$+V$ method with a static intersite vanadium-vanadium interaction term, $V$, to calculate the properties of the oxygen-deficient metallic rutile and insulating monoclinic M1 phases of VO$_2$ on the same footing. We find that oxygen vacancies induce local distortions in the M1 phase, but do not destroy the dimerization usually associated with the insulating behavior. In spite of this, we find that the M1 phase becomes metallic as a result of the partial filling of the conduction band due to a rigid-band-like doping effect.

Experimental and theoretical studies of unusual polar, dielectric and magnetic properties of room temperature multiferroics, such as perovskites Pb(Fe$_{1/2}$Nb$_{1/2}$)O$_3$ (PFN) and Pb(Fe$_{1/2}$Ta$_{1/2}$)O$_3$ (PFT), are very important. We study the phase composition, dielectric, ferroic properties of the solid solutions PFN and PFT substituted with 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 % of Mn ions prepared by the solid-state synthesis. The XRD analysis confirmed the perovskite structure of sintered ceramics. Electric measurements revealed the ferroelectric-type hysteresis of electric charge in pure PFN ceramics and in PFN ceramics substituted with (10 - 30)% of Mn. At the same time, the PFN-5% Mn ceramics did not show any ferroelectric properties due to very high conductivity.Temperature dependences of the dielectric permittivity of PFN-10% Mn and PFN-15% Mn ceramics have two pronounced maxima, one of which is relatively sharp and has a weak frequency dispersion; another is diffuse and has a strong frequency dispersion. A further increase in the Mn content up to 20% leads to the right shift in the paraelectric-ferroelectric phase transition temperature, as well as to the strong suppression of the second wide maximum, which transforms into a small diffuse shoulder. An increase in the Mn substitution up to 30% leads to a significant decrease in the dielectric permittivity, left shift of its maximum, and induces a pronounced frequency dispersion of the paraelectric-ferroelectric transition temperature, which is inherent to relaxor-like ferroelectrics.Comparison of the model with experiments reveal the coexistence of the ordered ferroelectric-like and disordered relaxor-like phases in the multiferroic solid solutions PFN-Mn and PFT-Mn.
