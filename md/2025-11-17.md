- **TL;DR**: 使用iPEPS方法研究二维横场Ising模型的虚时弛豫临界动力学，通过两种初始状态分析临界点和临界指数，验证了虚时演化在探测量子临界性中的有效性。

We investigate the imaginary-time relaxation critical dynamics of the two-dimensional transverse-field Ising model using infinite projected entangled pair states (iPEPS) with the full-update strategy. Simulating directly in the thermodynamic limit, we explore the relaxation process near the critical point with two types of initial states: a fully polarized state and a product state with a small magnetization. For the fully polarized state, the magnetization shows a power law scaling $M\propto τ^{-β/(νz)}$ in the imaginary-time evolution, from which both the critical point and critical exponent can be determined with high accuracy. For the nearly paramagnetic state, the relaxation process exhibits a behavior of $M\propto τ^θ$ with $θ=0.1958$ being the critical initial-slip exponent, which is in good agreement with that obtained from the dynamic scaling of the self-correlation in quantum Monte Carlo method. These universal features emerge well before the system converges to the ground state, demonstrating the efficiency of imaginary-time evolution for probing quantum criticality. Our results demonstrate that iPEPS can serve as a robust and scalable method for studying dynamical critical phenomena in two-dimensional quantum many-body systems.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一个利用结构光控制超导体中希格斯模式和涡旋动力学的新框架，展示了类似卡皮查-狄拉克效应的现象，为探测非平衡超导性提供了新途径。

We present a novel framework for controlling Higgs mode and vortex dynamics in superconductors using structured light. We propose a phenomenon analog of the Kapitza-Dirac effect in superconductors, where Higgs waves scatter off light-induced vortex lattices, generating interference patterns akin to matter wave diffraction. We also find that the vortices enable the linear coupling of Higgs mode to the electromagnetic field. This interplay between light-engineered Higgs excitations and emergent vortex textures opens a pathway to probe nonequilibrium superconductivity with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. Our results bridge quantum optics and condensed matter physics, offering new examples of quantum printing where one uses structured light to manipulate the collective modes in correlated quantum fluids.

- **TL;DR**: 对层状拓扑半金属TaNiTe$_5$的红外光谱研究表明，尽管其具有准一维结构，但在电子和光学性质上表现为三维各向异性半金属。

We present an infrared spectroscopy study of the layered topological semimetal TaNiTe$_5$, a material with a quasi-one-dimensional structure and strong in-plane anisotropy. Despite its structural features, infrared reflectivity and electronic transport measurements along the $a$ and $c$ crystallographic axes show metallic behavior without evidence of reduced dimensionality. Optical conductivity reveals an anisotropic but conventional metallic response with low scattering rates and a single sharp infrared-active phonon mode at $396$ cm$^{-1}$ ($49$ meV). Ab initio calculations closely match the experimental optical data and confirm a three-dimensional electronic structure. Our results demonstrate that TaNiTe$_5$ behaves as a three-dimensional anisotropic semimetal in its electronic and optical properties.

- **TL;DR**: 提出一种计算电子跃迁对精细结构常数变化敏感性的新方法，通过一阶微扰理论直接计算相对论动能和静止质量算符的期望值，避免了传统数值变分法的多次计算。

Quasi-forbidden electronic transitions in atoms and quasi-degenerate vibronic transitions in molecules serve as powerful probes of hypothetical temporal variations of fundamental constants. Computation of the sensitivity of a transition to a variation of the fine-structure constant is conventionally performed by numerical variation of the speed of light in sophisticated electronic structure calculations, and therewith several individual calculations have to be performed. An approach is presented herein that obtains sensitivity coefficients as first order perturbation to the Dirac-Coulomb Hamiltonian and allows their computation as expectation values of the relativistic kinetic energy and rest-mass operators. These are available in essentially all \emph{ab initio} relativistic electronic structure codes. Additionally, the corresponding operators for two-component Hamiltonians are derived, explicitly for the zeroth order regular approximation Hamiltonian. The approach is applied to demonstrate great sensitivity of highly charged polar molecules that were recently proposed for high-precision spectroscopy in [Zülch \emph{et al.}, arXiv:2203.10333[physics.chem-ph]]. In particular, a high sensitivity of a wealth of quasi-degenerate vibronic transitions in PaF$^{3+}$ and CeF$^{2+}$ to temporal variations of the fine-structure constant and the electron-proton mass ratio is shown.

- **TL;DR**: 提出基于Mamba架构的BOA压缩器，在高能物理数据压缩中实现最佳压缩比，但吞吐量较低

The petabyte-scale data generated annually by High Energy Physics (HEP) experiments like those at the Large Hadron Collider present a significant data storage challenge. Whilst traditional algorithms like LZMA and ZLIB are widely used, they often fail to exploit the deep structure inherent in scientific data. We investigate the application of modern state space models (SSMs) to this problem, which have shown promise for capturing long-range dependencies in sequences. We present the Bytewise Online Autoregressive (BOA) Constrictor, a novel, streaming-capable lossless compressor built upon the Mamba architecture. BOA combines an autoregressive Mamba model for next-byte prediction with a parallelised streaming range coder. We evaluate our method on three distinct structured datasets in HEP, demonstrating state-of-the-art compression ratios, improving upon LZMA-9 across all datasets. These improvements range from 2.21$\times$ (vs. 1.69$\times$) on the ATLAS dataset to a substantial 44.14$\times$ (vs. 27.14$\times$) on the highly-structured CMS dataset, with a modest $\sim 4.5$MB model size. However, this gain in compression ratio comes with a trade-off in throughput; the Storage-Saving Rate ($σ_{SSR}$) of our prototype currently lags behind highly-optimised CPU-based algorithms like ZLIB. We conclude that while this Mamba-based approach is a highly promising proof-of-principle, significant future work on performance optimisation and hardware portability is required to develop it into a production-ready tool for the HEP community.

### Ergodic properties of occupation times in heterogeneous media

- **TL;DR**: 本文研究了异质介质中布朗运动的遍历性质，通过占据时间统计和Feynman-Kac形式，分析了两种空间变化扩散系数模型的遍历性转变。

We investigate the ergodic properties of Brownian motion in heterogeneous media through the statistics of occupation times. Using the Feynman-Kac formalism, we derive analytical expressions for the distributions, moments, and ergodicity breaking parameters of occupation times in two models with spatially varying diffusion coefficient: a piecewise-constant profile and a power-law profile. In the piecewise model, the half occupation time and the occupation time within an interval follow asymmetric arcsine and half-Gaussian distributions, respectively, indicating non-ergodic behavior. For the power-law case, the corresponding distributions are the Lamperti and Mittag-Leffler. In both models, we identify a transition from non-ergodic to ergodic dynamics as the exponent vary. Numerical simulations fully corroborate the analytical results, demonstrating the effectiveness of the Feynman-Kac approach for quantifying ergodicity in heterogeneous diffusion processes.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文展示了在AlScN/GaN异质结构中实现超低薄层电阻的多通道二维电子气系统，通过引入GaN/AlN夹层提高了电子迁移率，在300K时五通道结构的薄层电阻降至45Ω/□，达到与最先进Al(In)N/GaN系统相当的性能。

Aluminum scandium nitride (AlScN) is a promising barrier material for gallium nitride (GaN)-based transistors for the next generation of radio-frequency electronic devices. In this work, we examine the transport properties of two dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) in single- and multi-channel AlScN/GaN heterostructures grown by molecular beam epitaxy, and demonstrate the lowest sheet resistance among AlScN-based systems reported to date. Assorted schemes of GaN/AlN interlayers are first introduced in single-channel structures between AlScN and GaN to improve conductivity, increasing electron mobility up to $1370$ cm$^{2}$/V$\cdot$s at 300 K and $4160$ cm$^{2}$/V$\cdot$s at 77 K, reducing the sheet resistance down to 170 $Ω/\square$ and 70 $Ω/\square$ respectively. These improvements are then leveraged in multi-channel heterostructures, reaching sheet resistances of 65 $Ω/\square$ for three channels and 45 $Ω/\square$ for five channels at 300 K, further reduced to 21 $Ω/\square$ and 13 $Ω/\square$ at 2 K, respectively, confirming the presence of multiple 2DEGs. Structural characterization indicates pseudomorphic growth with smooth surfaces, while partial barrier relaxation and surface roughening are observed at high scandium content, with no impact on mobility. This first demonstration of ultra-low sheet resistance multi-channel AlScN/GaN heterostructures places AlScN on par with state-of-the-art multi-channel Al(In)N/GaN systems, showcasing its capacity to advance existing and enable new high-speed, high-power electronic devices.

Sub-wavelength cavities have emerged as a promising platform to realize strong light-matter coupling in condensed matter systems. Previous studies are limited to dielectric sub-wavelength cavities, which preserve time-reversal symmetry. Here, we lift this constraint by proposing a cavity system based on magneto-electric materials, which host surface electromagnons with non-orthogonal electric field and magnetic field components. The quantum fluctuations of the surface electromagnons drive a nearby graphene monolayer into an anyonic Chern insulator, characterized by anyonic quasi-particles and a topological gap that decays polynomially with the graphene-substrate distance. Our work opens a path to controllably break time-reversal symmetry and induce exotic quantum states through cavity vacuum fluctuations.

- **TL;DR**: 通过拉曼光谱和电输运测量，在高压低温条件下观察LaH10的超导现象，证实了声子介导的超导机制，并建立了拉曼光谱作为研究高温超导的可靠方法。

The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in hydrogen-rich compounds under extreme pressures has prompted great excitement, intense research, but also debate over the past decade. Electrical transport has been the primary diagnostic tool for identifying superconductivity in these systems, whereas complementary probes, including magnetic, spectroscopic, tunnelling and ultrafast methods, remain mostly qualitative due to experimental constraints and sample heterogeneity. Recent concerns over their reliability have fuelled controversy, leading to scepticism and pointing out the need for alternative, quantitative approaches. In this study, we acquired unprecedented high-quality Raman spectra of hexagonal LaH10 at approximately 145 GPa and low temperatures, in conjunction with electrical transport measurements. Upon cooling, we observe a drop of resistivity and simultaneous remarkable variations of phonon frequencies and linewidths. These effects are interpreted and perfectly reproduced by the Migdal-Eliashberg theory, providing a definitive proof of phonon-mediated superconductivity and enabling a quantitative determination of the superconducting energy gap. Our results establish Raman spectroscopy as a robust, contact-free probe with micrometric resolution for studying high temperature superconductivity, opening a powerful route to its discovery and characterization.

- **TL;DR**: 评估不同交换关联泛函在氢分子到金属相变中的表现，发现r2SCAN泛函在键长和离解能方面表现最佳，而含范德华修正的泛函在相变区域显示出差异。

We investigate basic hydrogen quantities like the molecular bond length, the molecular dissociation energy and the van-der-Waals interaction in idealized situations in an effort to discern a suitable exchange-correlation functional for the molecular to metal transition in warm dense hydrogen. The best reproduction of bond length and dissociation energy is given by the r2SCAN functional, several vdW functionals and also HSE06 fair qualitatively and quantitatively no better than PBE or worse. In addition we investigate quantities like the static and dynamic ion structure factor, and the electronic DOS to determine differences between exchange-correlation functionals with and without van-der-Waals corrections in the transition region from the molecular to the metallic regime of hydrogen.

### Beyond quantum mean-field approximation: Phase-space formulation of many-body time-dependent density functional theory and efficient spectral approximations

- **TL;DR**: 本文提出了一种解决时间依赖2-约化密度矩阵高维数值挑战的方法，通过Wigner相空间公式和谱近似技术，实现了2-RDM动力学的首次实际模拟。

As a universal quantum mechanical approach to the dynamical many-body problem, the time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) might be inadequate to describe crucial observables that rely on two-body evolution behavior, like the double-excitation probability and two-body dynamic correlation. One promising remedy is to utilize the time-dependent 2-reduced density matrix (2-RDM) that directly represents two-body observables in an N-particle system, and resort to the extended TDDFT for multibody densities to break the confines of spatial local on one-body density [Phys. Rev. Lett. 26(6) (2024) 263001]. However, the usage of 2-RDM is prohibitive due to the augmented dimensionality, e.g., 4-D space for unidimensional 2-RDM. This work addresses the high-dimensional numerical challenges by using an equivalent Wigner phase-space formulation of 2-RDM and seeking efficient spectral approximations to nonlocal quantum potentials. For spatial periodic case, a pseudo-difference operator approach is derived for both the Hartree-exchange-correlation term and two-body collision operator, while the discretization via the Chebyshev spectral element method is provided for non-periodic case. A massively parallel numerical scheme, which integrates these spectral approximations with a distributed characteristics method, allows us to make the first attempt for real simulations of 2-RDM dynamics. Numerical experiments demonstrate the two-body correction to the quantum kinetic theory, and show the increase in the system's entropy induced by the two-bdoy interaction. Thus it may pave the way for an accurate description of 2-RDM dynamics and advance to a practical application of many-body TDDFT.

### Scaling of free cumulants in closed system-bath setups

The Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) has been established as a cornerstone for understanding thermalization in quantum many-body systems. Recently, there has been growing interest in the full ETH, which extends the framework of the conventional ETH and postulates a smooth function to describe the multi-point correlations among matrix elements. Within this framework, free cumulants play a central role, and most previous studies have primarily focused on closed systems. In this paper, we extend the analysis to a system-bath setup, considering both an idealized case with a random-matrix bath and a more realistic scenario where the bath is modeled as a defect Ising chain. In both cases, we uncover a universal scaling of microcanonical free cumulants of system observables with respect to the interaction strength. Furthermore we establish a connection between this scaling behavior and the thermalization dynamics of the thermal free cumulants of corresponding observables.

- **TL;DR**: 在Nb-Ta-Ti-V体系中，增加V含量会因原子尺寸较小产生显著的原子错配，提高刃型位错相对于螺型位错的滑移能垒，导致变形机制从螺型位错控制逐渐转变为刃型位错控制，从而显著提高高温强度。

The strength of body-centered cubic materials is traditionally known to be governed by screw dislocations. However, recent findings reveal that in certain refractory complex concentrated alloys, edge dislocations can instead control strength. This work integrates high-temperature mechanical testing, in-situ neutron scattering during heating and tension, scanning transmission electron microscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations to uncover the mechanism behind this behavior. In the Nb-Ta-Ti-V system, increasing the V content, due to its smaller atomic size, induces substantial atomic misfit that raises the glide barrier for edge dislocations relative to screw dislocations. This effect drives a gradual transition from screw to edge dislocation-controlled deformation, leading to markedly enhanced strength at elevated temperatures.

Resonant parametric modulation is a major tool of studying magnetic systems. For a spin-1/2 chain in a strong magnetic field, the resulting excitations can be mapped on fermionic excitations in the Kitaev chain. We show that the response to the modulation turn-on allows one to reveal dynamical aspects of the nontrivial topology of the periodic chain. In the topological regime, depending on how fast the turn-on is, the system displays the absence of spatial magnetization correlations or their increase with the increasing detuning of the modulation from resonance. The transition between the topological and trivial regimes is controlled by the modulation frequency.

The optical properties of the superconducting K$_{0.8}$Fe$_{1.7}$(Se$_{0.73}$S$_{0.27}$)$_2$ single crystals with a critical temperature $T_c\approx 26$ K have been measured in the {\it ab} plane in a wide frequency range using both infrared Fourier-transform spectroscopy and spectroscopic ellipsometry at temperatures of 4--300 K. The normal-state reflectance of K$_{0.8}$Fe$_{1.7}$(Se$_{0.73}$S$_{0.27}$)$_2$ is analyzed using a Drude-Lorentz model with one Drude component. The temperature dependences of the plasma frequency, optical conductivity, scattering rate, and dc resistivity of the Drude contribution in the normal state are presented. In the superconducting state, we observe a signature of the superconducting gap opening at $2Δ$(5~K) = 11.8~meV. An abrupt decrease in the low-frequency dielectric permittivity $\varepsilon _1(ω)$ at $T &lt; T_c$ also evidences the formation of the superconducting condensate. The superconducting plasma frequency $ω_{pl,s} = (213\pm 5)$~cm$^{-1}$ and the magnetic penetration depth $λ=(7.5\pm 0.2)$~$μ$m at $T=5$~K are determined.

- **TL;DR**: 论文揭示了势垒亲和性(PBA)这一反直觉量子效应，解释了电子在原子间区域积累的根本机制，推翻了传统化学键形成的认知。

Electron accumulation in interatomic regions is a fundamental quantum phenomenon dictating chemical bonding and material properties, yet its origin remains elusive across disciplines. Here, we report a counterintuitive quantum effect -- potential-barrier affinity (PBA) -- revealed by solving the Schrödinger equation for a crystalline potential. PBA effect drives significant interatomic electron accumulation when electron energy exceeds the barrier maximum. This effect essentially determines interatomic electron density patterns, governing microstructures and properties of condensed matters. Our theory overturns the traditional wisdom that the interstitial electron localization in electride requires potential-well constraints or hybrid orbitals, and it serves the fundamental mechanism underlying the formation of conventional chemical bonds. This work delivers a paradigm shift in understanding electron distribution and establishes a theoretical foundation for the microscopic design of material properties.

### Power law attention biases for molecular transformers

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种基于物理幂律的低复杂度注意力偏置方法，通过原子间距离的对数函数来加权注意力概率，在分子性质预测任务中表现优于位置编码和图注意力。

Transformers are the go-to architecture for most data modalities due to their scalability. While they have been applied extensively to molecular property prediction, they do not dominate the field as they do elsewhere. One cause may be the lack of structural biases that effectively capture the relationships between atoms. Here, we investigate attention biases as a simple and natural way to encode structure. Motivated by physical power laws, we propose a family of low-complexity attention biases $b_{ij} = p \log|| \mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j||$ which weigh attention probabilities according to interatomic distances. On the QM9 and SPICE datasets, this approach outperforms positional encodings and graph attention while remaining competitive with more complex Gaussian kernel biases. We also show that good attention biases can compensate for a complete ablation of scaled dot-product attention, suggesting a low-cost path toward interpretable molecular transformers.

We hybridize swap Monte Carlo and geometric relaxation to determine the intrinsic compositional structure (CS) of lead magnesium niobate (PMN) relaxor. We verify the stability of a Nb-rich sublattice in PMN, as prescribed by the prevailing random-site model. But ions in the complementary sublattice are not randomly mixed. The majority of Nb ions collapse into a dominant Nb cluster which percolates the lattice with a mesh-like geometry that prevents large space charges. Subsequent molecular dynamics simulations predict a pair distribution function agreeing with neutron scattering experiments. Analysis of dipolar structures in the Nb cluster sheds light on the unique dielectric property of PMN.

However, given the toxicity of lead, alternative lead-free perovskite semiconductors are needed. By fully replacing lead with rare-earth elements, one can simultaneously address toxicity concerns and achieve comparable optoelectronic performance. Here, we demonstrate the synthesis of two-dimensional europium halide perovskite nanoplatelets governed by the formula $\mathrm{L_{2}EuX_{4}}$ where L is an organic ligand and X is a halide anion. The structure, morphology, and composition of the nanoplatelets are confirmed by XRD, AFM, and XPS. Deep blue-emitting $\mathrm{PEA_{2}EuBr_{4}}$ perovskite nanoplatelets are synthesized in both the solution- and solid-states with photoluminescence emission centered at 446 nm and CIE color coordinates of (0.1515, 0.0327) and (0.1515, 0.0342), respectively. Additionally, near-ultraviolet $\mathrm{PEA_{2}EuCl_{4}}$ perovskite nanoplatelets are synthesized in both the solution- and solid-states with photoluminescence emission centered at 400 nm and 401 nm, respectively. Overall, europium halide perovskite nanoplatelets offer a lead-free alternative for deep blue, violet, and near-ultraviolet light emission $\unicode{x2013}$ charting new pathways for optoelectronics in this energy regime.

We examine the robustness of the S-shaped current-voltage characteristics associated with hot-carrier-induced electrical breakdown in perforated graphene metasurfaces (PGMs) as a function of doping. The perforation of the graphene layer forms interdigital arrays of graphene microribbons (GMRs) interconnected by graphene nanoribbon (GNR) bridges. These GNR constrictions act as energy barriers for electrons and holes emitted from the GMRs and govern the inter-GMR thermionic current under an applied bias voltage. The doping and the voltage bias establish distinct electron and hole populations in adjacent GMRs. Peltier heating of these carriers within the GMRs increases their effective temperatures, thereby enhancing the inter-GMR current. The resulting positive feedback between carrier heating and current amplification can trigger an electrothermal breakdown, transforming a superlinear current-voltage dependence into an S-shaped characteristic exhibiting negative differential resistance. The degree of electron-hole asymmetry significantly influences this positive feedback and strongly modifies the overall current-voltage response. These results provide a framework for optimizing PGM-based devices employing GMR/GNR architectures, including voltage-controlled fast switches, incandescent emitters, and terahertz bolometric detectors.

In this paper we attempt to construct the topological theory of superfluid helium $4$ in the framework of the (rigid) $U(1)$ model in which the initial $U(1)$ group is destroyed with appearance of (topologically nontrivial) domains separated by domain walls treated as step voltages between domains (e.g. with neighboring topological numbers). This can explain the superfluid properties in a helium $4$ specimen as well as the appearance of topologically nontrivial vortices therein.

We derive the full spectrum of decorated Cayley trees that constitute tree analogs of selected two-dimensional Euclidean lattices; namely of the Lieb, the double Lieb, the kagome, and the star lattice. The common feature of these Euclidean lattices is that their nearest-neighbor models give rise to flat energy bands interpretable through compact localized states. We find that the tree analogs exhibit similar flat or nearly flat energy bands at the corresponding energies. Interestingly, such flat bands in the decorated Cayley trees acquire an interpretation that is absent in their Euclidean counterparts: as edge states localized to the inner or the outer boundary of the tree branches. In particular, we establish an exact correspondence between the Lieb-Cayley tree and an ensemble of one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chains, which maps topological edge states on one side of the chains to flat-band states localized in the bulk of the tree, furnishing the flat energy band with a topological stability. Similar mapping to topological edge states or to states bound to edge defects in one-dimensional chains is shown for flat-band states in all the considered tree decorations. We finally show that the persistence of exact flat bands on infinite decorated trees (i.e., Bethe lattices) arises naturally from a covering interpretation of tree graphs. Our findings reveal a rich landscape of flat-band and topological phenomena in non-Euclidean systems, where geometry alone can generate and stabilize unconventional quantum states.

- **TL;DR**: 氮掺杂和空位缺陷对石墨烯力学性能影响的分子动力学模拟研究，发现氮原子团簇会显著降低力学性能，而同等尺寸的空位缺陷则表现出更高的刚度和更低的延展性。

Graphene's exceptional mechanical properties are crucial for its integration into advanced technological applications. However, real-world synthesis and functionalization processes introduce structural modifications that can compromise its mechanical integrity. Nitrogen doping, while beneficial for electronic property tuning, often results in atomic clustering rather than uniform distribution, while concurrent vacancy defect formation represents another common structural alteration during processing. This study systematically investigates the comparative effects of nitrogen atom clusters and equivalent sized vacancy defects on the mechanical behavior of graphene sheets through molecular dynamics simulations. The Nitrogen clustering significantly degraded mechanical performance almost similarly to random doping. In comparison, systems with equivalent-sized vacancy defects showed higher stiffness and lower ductility than those with clusters. The study revealed distinct failure mechanisms between doped and defective configurations, with nitrogen clusters showing modified crack propagation patterns while vacancies acted as pronounced stress concentrators, leading to premature failure. However, this study also showed that defect morphology critically influences mechanical properties. These findings provide important insights for optimizing graphene synthesis and processing protocols, highlighting the differential mechanical risks associated with dopant clustering versus vacancy formation. The results inform defect-tolerant design strategies for graphene-based nanoelectronics, composites, and sensors, where mechanical reliability is paramount for device performance and longevity.

Electric conductivities may reveal the topological and magnetic properties of band structures in solids, especially for two-dimensional unpaired Dirac fermions. In this work, we evaluate the longitudinal and Hall conductivity for unpaired Dirac fermions in the framework of the self-consistent Born approximation and find a nearly semi-elliptic relation between the minimal conductivity and Hall conductivities in the Dirac fermions. Near the charge neutrality point, disorder may drive a metal-insulator transition, and enhance the longitudinal conductivity. For the massless case, the minimal conductivity $σ_{xx}^*$ coexists with the half-quantized Hall conductivity $e^2/2h$, forming an indicator for the parity anomalous semimetal. The relation signals a disorder-induced metallic phase that bridges two topologically distinct insulating phases, and agrees with the recent experimental observation in magnetic topological insulators.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文表明，即使在名义上的单组分超导体中，在某些条件下也会表现出多个相干长度，导致重要的物理后果，包括可能形成1.5型超导性。

A fundamental characteristic of a superconducting state is the coherence length $ξ$. Multicomponent superconductors, particularly ones breaking multiple symmetries, are characterized by multiple coherence lengths. Here we show that even, nominally $single$-component superconductors under certain conditions are characterized by multiple coherence lengths. We consider nearest-neighbor pairing interactions on a square lattice that leads to $s$-wave and $d$-wave representations of link superconducting order parameter. We show that even if the subdominant order parameter is completely suppressed in the ground state, it results in multiple correlation lengths with nontrivial hierarchy, resulting in important physical consequences in inhomogeneous solutions. Under certain conditions, this leads to type-1.5 superconductivity, where magnetic field penetration length falls between two coherence lengths, leading to vortex clustering in an external magnetic field.

### Interpretable descriptors enable prediction of hydrogen-based superconductors at moderate pressures

- **TL;DR**: 开发了一个基于符号回归的可解释框架来预测氢基超导体的Tc，发现费米能级1eV内的积分态密度是关键描述符。该模型准确预测了Tc，并识别出4个氢基候选材料，其中Na2GaCuH6在常压下Tc达42.04K，超过MgB2。

Room temperature superconductivity remains elusive, and hydrogen-base compounds despite remarkable transition temperatures(Tc) typically require extreme pressures that hinder application. To accelerate discovery under moderate pressures, an interpretable framework based on symbolic regression is developed to predict Tc in hydrogen-based superconductors. A key descriptor is an integrated density of states (IDOS) within 1 eV of the Fermi level (EF), which exhibits greater robustness than conventional single-point DOS features. The resulting analytic model links electronic-structure characteristics to superconducting performance, achieves high accuracy (RMSEtrain = 20.15 K), and generalizes well to external datasets. By relying solely on electronic structure calculations, the approach greatly accelerates materials screening. Guided by this model, four hydrogen-based candidates are identified and validated via calculation: Na2GaCuH6 with Tc =42.04 K at ambient pressure (exceeding MgB2), and NaCaH12, NaSrH12, and KSrH12 with Tc up to 162.35 K, 86.32 K, and 55.13 K at 100 GPa, 25 GPa, and 25 GPa, respectively. Beyond rapid screening, the interpretable form clarifies how hydrogen-projected electronic weight near EF and related features govern Tc in hydrides, offering a mechanism-aware route to stabilize high-Tc phases at reduced pressures.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究实现了在室温下通过高度波纹石墨烯稳定吸附惰性气体（氙、氪、氩、氦），气体原子形成周期性排列晶体，可在350°C完全脱附而不损伤石墨烯结构。

Controllable gas adsorption is critical for both scientific and industrial fields, and high-capacity adsorption of gases on solid surfaces provides a significant promise due to its high-safety and low-energy consumption. However, the adsorption of nonpolar gases, particularly noble gases, poses a considerable challenge under atmospheric pressure and room temperature (RT). Here, we theoretically simulate and experimentally realize the stable adsorption of noble gases like xenon (Xe), krypton (Kr), argon (Ar), and helium (He) on highly rippled graphene at RT. The elemental characteristics of adsorbed Xe are confirmed by electron energy loss spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The adsorbed gas atoms are crystalized with periodic arrangements. These adsorbed noble gases on graphene exhibit high stability at RT and can be completely desorbed at approximately 350 °C without damaging the intrinsic lattice of graphene. The structural and physical properties of graphene are significantly influenced by the adsorbed gas, and they fully recover after desorption. Additionally, this controllable adsorption could be generalized to other layered adsorbents such as NbSe2, MoS2 and carbon nanotubes. We anticipate that this ripple-assisted adsorption will not only re-define the theoretical framework of gas adsorption, but also accelerate advancements in gas storage and separation technologies, as well as enhance the applications in catalysis, surface modification, and other related fields.

We theoretically investigate orbital accumulation driven by chiral phonons via orbital-dependent electron-lattice coupling. We derive a formula for the orbital accumulation induced by classical lattice dynamics or nonequilibrium phonons, using the Berry curvature, linear response theory, and the nonequilibrium Green's function method. We show that chiral phonons primarily couple to orbital quadrupole moments and that static orbital dipole accumulation can be generated in the second-order of lattice displacement. Our study provides a useful method for generating orbital accumulation without using spin-orbit interaction.

We report a comprehensive investigation of the quasi-one-dimensional spin-chain compound Ca3CoIrO6 (CCIO) using a combination of structural, magnetic, thermodynamic, transport, Raman, and dielectric measurements. Temperature-dependent neutron powder diffraction confirms the rhombohedral R-3c structure down to 5 K without any structural phase transition. DC magnetization, ac susceptibility, and relaxation measurements reveal a gradual evolution from a high-temperature paramagnetic-like state to a partially disordered antiferromagnetic (PDA) state below 100 K, accompanied by slow cluster-like spin dynamics followed by a freezing transition near 30 K. Isothermal magnetic hysteresis M(H) loops demonstrate partial chain freezing, while robust exchange bias is observed in field-cooled protocols, highlighting the interplay between PDA ordering and frozen spins. Resistivity and specific heat data indicate strong coupling between spin and charge degrees of freedom, accompanied by activated transport behavior. Raman spectroscopy identifies pronounced anomalies in phonon frequencies and linewidths across multiple magnetic regimes, reflecting strong spin-lattice coupling. Polarization-electric field (P-E) measurements reveal temperature-dependent crossovers from linear dielectric to weakly hysteretic behavior, consistent with short-range polar correlations driven by spin-lattice interactions. These findings establish CCIO as a prototypical quasi-one-dimensional frustrated spin-chain system where geometric frustration, spin-orbit coupling, and low-dimensionality generate field-tunable PDA order, glassy spin dynamics, exchange bias, and magnetodielectric coupling. These results provide new insights into frustration-driven phases in low-dimensional oxides and point towards potential multifunctional applications based on intrinsic magnetodielectric and exchange bias phenomena.

Multiple Andreev reflections in voltage-biased Josephson junctions give rise to the subharmonic gap structure in the conductance, which is widely used to characterize transport properties and estimate the induced gap in the junctions. Here we theoretically investigate the evolution of the subharmonic gap structure in spinful Josephson junctions. Spin mixing introduced by the spin-orbit coupling opens avoided crossings in the dispersion relation of the leads, which, as we demonstrate, subsequently results in pronounced multiple Andreev reflection features in the conductance traces. We analyze how these features evolve under an external magnetic field and explain that their visibility in conductance is governed by the spin polarization of the bands.

The electronic structure of semiconducting 2D materials such as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) is known to be tunable by its environment, from simple external fields applied with electrical contacts up to complex van der Waals heterostructure assemblies. However, conventional alloying from reference binary TMD compounds to composition-controlled ternary alloys also offers unexplored opportunities. In this work, we use nano-angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (nano-ARPES) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to study the structural and electronic properties of different alloy compositions of bulk WS2(1-x)Se2x. Our results demonstrate the continuous variation of the band structure and the progressive evolution of the valence band splitting at the K points from 420 to 520 meV in bulk WS2(1-x)Se2x. We also carried out scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) measurements and DFT to understand the possible S or Se substitutions variants in WS2(1-x)Se2x alloys, with different local atomic configurations. Our work opens up perspectives for the fine control of the band dispersion in van der Waals materials and demonstrate how the band structure can be tuned in bulk TMDs. The collected information can serve as a reference for future applications.

We develop a Fokker-Planck approach to describe the dynamics of staggered magnetization and thermal fluctuations in a two-dimensional antiferromagnetic system with uniaxial anisotropy. Beginning with a classical model for the antiferromagnetic system, we incorporate a Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation augmented by Langevin fields to account for thermal fluctuations, and we derive the Fokker-Planck equation governing the probability distribution function of the spin configuration. Employing the mean-field approximation, we derive the equations of motion for the spin polarization and the two-time spin-spin correlation functions. The methodology is applied to the study of spin-wave dynamics and to the formulation of a phenomenological model for resistance fluctuations in two-dimensional antiferromagnetic semiconductors.

The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), characterized by the extensive localization of bulk modes at the boundaries, has attracted significant attention as a hallmark feature of non-Hermitian topology. This localization invalidates the conventional Bloch band theory, necessitating an analysis under open boundary conditions even in the thermodynamic limit. The Amoeba formulation addresses this challenge by computing the spectral potential rather than the spectrum itself. Based on the (strong) Szegö limit theorem and its topological generalization, this approach reduces the evaluation of the potential to an optimization problem involving the Ronkin function. However, while the generalized Szegö limit theorem is formally applicable in arbitrary dimensions, its implementation is limited to single-band systems, and its applicability to multiband systems remains unclear. In this paper, we establish the Wiener-Hopf factorization (WHF) of the non-Bloch Hamiltonian as a powerful framework, providing a unified and rigorous foundation for Amoeba analysis in multiband systems. By combining the WHF with Hermitian doubling, we first elucidate the applicability criteria for the generalized Szegö limit theorem in multiband systems. We then show that the WHF provides the natural mathematical origin for the symmetry-decomposed Ronkin function in symmetry class AII$^\dagger$, leading to a rigorous proof of the generalized Szegö limit theorem for these systems and opening a path toward systematic generalizations to other symmetry classes.

This work presents electronic and magnetic properties of selected members in the cubic Laves phase series Nd1-xPrxCoNi and Ce0.25Pr0.75CoNi, together with the corresponding binary compositions (NdCo2, NdNi2, PrCo2, PrNi2, CeCo2, CeNi2), using soft x-ray absorption spectroscopy, x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD), density-functional theory, and crystal field multiplet calculations. All transition-metal moments saturate below 1 T, while the rare-earth moments do not saturate even at 5 T, consistent with van Vleck paramagnetic contributions and crystal field suppression. While the sum rules are widely used to extract element-specific magnetic moments from XMCD, we show that for 3d transition metals, their application requires accurate estimates of the number of unoccupied 3d states. We observe a finite magnetic moment on Ni, challenging the common assumption of its nonmagnetic character in Laves phases. The orbital magnetic moments were determined using the spin rules, while the spin moments were estimated from single-ion values from multiplet calculations, due to the invalidity of the spin sum rule for light rare-earth elements. The magnetic moments of Nd and Pr are found to be suppressed relative to their free-ion values, with multiplet theory indicating that this is due to crystal field effects. Our results confirm that Nd and Pr maintain localized 4f3 and 4f2 configurations, respectively, and that their element-specific magnetic moments are robust to rare-earth substitution. Ce, on the other hand, exhibits a tunable mixed-valent ground state with both magnetic 4f1 and nonmagnetic 4f0 components. The relative fraction of these states varies with the electronegativity of the surrounding 3d transition metals, revealing a pathway to tune Ce magnetism via composition. This work establishes a framework for accurately interpreting XMCD in light rare-earth-based intermetallics.

Nanoscale topologically non-trivial magnetization configurations generate significant interest due to both the fundamental properties of their knotted structures and their potential applications in ultra-efficient computing devices. While such textures have been widely studied in two dimensions, three-dimensional (3D) systems can yield more complex configurations, resulting in richer topologies and dynamic behaviors. However, reliably nucleating these 3D textures has proven challenging, and so far, 3D configurations such as vortex rings and hopfions can often only be observed forming spontaneously in relatively uncontrolled manners. Here, we demonstrate that through the 3D nanopatterning of chiral single crystal helimagnets into nano-tori, the controlled formation of a magnetic double helix can be achieved. This surface-localized topological state is stabilized by the interplay of intrinsic exchange interactions of the single crystal with the extrinsic emergent effects of the patterned geometry. These double helices host magnetic defects akin to supercoiling in circular DNA and climbing vines. We expect this study to serve as a foundation for future research combining single crystal systems with 3D nanopatterning, offering a new degree of control over emergent phenomena in nanoscale magnets and wider quantum material systems.

- **TL;DR**: 通过对比闪锌矿和亚价键岩盐结构BeO的热输运特性，发现亚价键增强晶格非谐性，显著抑制声子输运，导致极低热导率。提出了识别亚价键材料的三个关键指标。

The search for materials with intrinsically low thermal conductivity ($κ_L$) is critical for energy applications, yet conventional descriptors often fail to capture the complex interplay between bonding and lattice dynamics. Here, first-principles calculations are used to contrast the thermal transport in covalent zincblende (zb) and metavalent rocksalt (rs) BeO. We find that the metavalent bonding in rs-BeO enhances lattice anharmonicity, activating multi-phonon scattering channels and suppressing phonon transport. This results in an ultralow $κ_L$ of 24 W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$ at 300 K, starkly contrasting with the zb phase (357 W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$). Accurately modeling such strongly anharmonic systems requires explicit inclusion of temperature-dependent phonon renormalization and four-phonon scattering. These contributions, negligible in zb-BeO, are essential for high-precision calculations of the severely suppressed $κ_L$ in rs-BeO. Finally, we identify three key indicators to guide the discovery of metavalently bonded, incipient-metallic materials: (i) an NaCl-type crystal structure, (ii) large Grüneisen parameters ($\textgreater$2), and (iii) a breakdown of the Lyddane-Sachs-Teller relation. These findings provide microscopic insight into thermal transport suppression by metavalent bonding and offer a predictive framework for identifying promising thermoelectrics and phase-change materials.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种通过耦合玻色子浴使一般陈能带弛豫到理想陈能带的微观弱耦合机制，为稳定分数量子陈绝缘体提供了具体耗散路径。

We propose a microscopic, weak-coupling mechanism by which generic Chern bands relax toward ideal bands. We consider coupling interacting electrons to a Caldeira-Leggett like Ohmic bosonic bath. Using the Born-Markov approximation, Slater determinant states of a Chern band under Hartree-Fock approximation evolve toward Slater determinant states corresponding to an ideal Chern band. We validate our proposal by performing numerical simulation of a massive Dirac model, showing that the Berry curvature and quantum metric indeed co-evolve to saturate the trace condition. Our proposal provides a concrete dissipative route to realize ideal Chern bands, a fundamental building block for the stabilization of fractional Chern insulators.

- **TL;DR**: PdTe2单晶在可见光和太赫兹波段展现出强二阶和三阶非线性光学响应，拓扑表面态导致二次谐波产生共振增强，太赫兹激发的非线性响应可在反射几何中清晰观测，适合射频整流、频率混频和光束聚焦应用。

Nonlinear processes can offer pathways to next-generation sensors and frequency mixing devices to overcome modern imaging, detection, and communication challenges. In this article, we report on strong second and third-order nonlinear optical responses in visible and terahertz (THz) light in single crystals of the noble metal dichalcogenide PdTe2. We find that buried conduction and valence topological surface states of PdTe2 lead to resonant enhancement of optical second-harmonic generation. On the other hand, although the nonlinear responses obtained with THz excitation are not close to this resonance, they can be clearly observed in reflection geometry, even in the presence of broadband excitation, where optical filters are not necessary to observe the odd-order higher harmonic gain. By carefully considering the radiative photocurrent framework of stimulated THz emission, we are able to extract fingerprints of both second- and third-order processes in the THz regime, and show that PdTe2 is a promising material candidate for radio frequency rectification, frequency mixing, and beam focusing.

Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) has recently emerged as a direct probe of excitonic correlations in two-dimensional semiconductors, resolving their dispersion and dynamics in energy-momentum space, including dark exciton states inaccessible to optical techniques. However, the ARPES fingerprint of charged excitons (trions), which plays a key role in all doped and gated 2D material systems, has remained unknown so far. We present a first theoretical analysis of trion signatures in monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides, highlighting how the additional charge carrier modifies the spectral position and shape relative to neutral excitons in ARPES spectra. Interestingly, we further predict that mass-imbalanced trions yield a characteristic double-peak structure, clearly separated in energy and line shape from neutral excitons. The predicted temperature dependence of these features offers guidance for experimental investigations aimed at identifying trionic states, thereby establishing a framework for ARPES studies of many-body Coulomb complexes in doped two-dimensional semiconductors.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种用于计算材料发现的通用输入/输出标准，使不同DFT代码和工作流管理器能够互操作，并通过电池阴极材料开路电压计算案例验证了该标准。

Interoperability and cross-validation remains a significant challenge in the computational materials discovery community. In this context, we introduce a common input/output standard designed for internal translation by various workflow managers (AiiDA, PerQueue, Pipeline Pilot, and SimStack) to produce results in a unified schema. This standard aims to enable engine-agnostic workflow execution across multiple density functional theory (DFT) codes, including CASTEP, GPAW, Quantum ESPRESSO, and VASP. As a demonstration, we have implemented a workflow to calculate the open-circuit voltage across several battery cathode materials using the proposed universal input/output schema. We analyze and resolve the challenges of reconciling energetics computed by different DFT engines and document the code-specific idiosyncrasies that make straightforward comparisons difficult. Motivated by these challenges, we outline general design principles for robust automated DFT workflows. This work represents a practical step towards more reproducible and interoperable workflows for high-throughput materials screening, while highlighting challenges of aligning electronic properties, especially for non-pristine structures.

### Theoretical study of orbital torque: Dependence on ferromagnet species and nonmagnetic layer thickness

- **TL;DR**: 通过第一性原理紧束缚模型系统研究Ti/FM和Cu/FM双层结构中的轨道力矩，发现轨道力矩的磁性层依赖性随轨道电流源变化，且主要来源于非磁性层的体效应。

The manipulation of magnetization in ferromagnetic metals (FMs) through orbital torque (OT) has emerged as a promising route for energy-efficient magnetic devices without relying on heavy metals. While Ti and Cu are among the most extensively studied light nonmagnetic metals (NMs) for OT devices, theoretical calculations of the resulting torque have remained limited. Here, we present a systematic and quantitative theoretical study of current-induced torques in Ti/FM and Cu/FM (FM = Co, Ni) bilayers using semi-realistic tight-binding models derived from ab initio electronic structures. We find that the torque in Ti/FM is larger for Ni than for Co, but this trend does not necessarily hold in Cu/FM, revealing that the FM dependence of OT is not universal but varies with the orbital current source. Moreover, the dependence of OT on NM thickness clearly indicates its NM bulk origin in both Ti- and Cu-based systems. Notwithstanding, the quantitative characteristics of OT cannot be explained by a simplified picture based on the individual bulk properties of the NM or FM layers. These results provide microscopic insight and practical guidance for designing light-metal-based orbitronic devices.

- **TL;DR**: 开发了一种人机协作工作流，将大语言模型与自主实验相结合，用于BaTiO3/石墨烯的远程外延生长，通过协作策略更新加速科学发现。

Autonomous laboratories typically rely on data-driven decision-making, occasionally with human-in-the-loop oversight to inject domain expertise. Fully leveraging AI agents, however, requires tightly coupled, collaborative workflows spanning hypothesis generation, experimental planning, execution, and interpretation. To address this, we develop and deploy a human-AI collaborative (HAIC) workflow that integrates large language models for hypothesis generation and analysis, with collaborative policy updates driving autonomous pulsed laser deposition (PLD) experiments for remote epitaxy of BaTiO$_3$/graphene. HAIC accelerated the hypothesis formation and experimental design and efficiently mapped the growth space to graphene-damage. In situ Raman spectroscopy reveals that chemistry drives degradation while the highest energy plume components seed defects, identifying a low-O$_2$ pressure low-temperature synthesis window that preserves graphene but is incompatible with optimal BaTiO$_3$ growth. Thus, we show a two-step Ar/O$_2$ deposition is required to exfoliate ferroelectric BaTiO$_3$ while maintaining a monolayer graphene interlayer. HAIC stages human insight with AI reasoning between autonomous batches to drive rapid scientific progress, providing an evolution to many existing human-in-the-loop autonomous workflows.

- **TL;DR**: RF-Squad是一个基于物理的量子点阵列射频反射测量模拟器，能够超越恒定相互作用模型，模拟隧道耦合、隧穿速率和量子约束等物理现象，为自动调谐算法提供大规模训练数据集。

Spins in semiconductor quantum dots offer a scalable approach to quantum computing; however, precise control and efficient readout of large quantum dot arrays remain challenging, mainly due to the hyperdimensional voltage space required for tuning multiple gates per dot. To automate this process, large datasets are required for testing and training autotuning algorithms. To address the demand for such large datasets, we introduce RF-Squad, a physics-based simulator designed to realistically replicate radiofrequency (RF) reflectometry measurements of quantum dot arrays, with the ability to go beyond the Constant Interaction Model (CIM) and simulate physical phenomena such as tunnel coupling, tunnel rates, and quantum confinement. Implemented in JAX, an accelerated linear algebra library, RF-Squad achieves high computational speed, enabling the simulation of a 100x100 pixel charge stability diagram of a double quantum dot (DQD) in 52.1 $\pm$0.2 milliseconds at the CIM level. Using optimization algorithms, combined with it's layered architecture, RF-Squad allows users to balance physical accuracy with computational speed, scaling from simple to highly detailed models.

Electron beam-induced current (EBIC) imaging in the scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM), STEM-EBIC, provides direct access to carrier transport at the nanoscale. While well established in bulk SEM geometries, its application to thin TEM lamellae remains largely unexplored. Here, we present a systematic STEM-EBIC study of silicon photodiode lamellae prepared by gallium and xenon focused ion beam (FIB) milling. We directly visualize the p-n junctions in thin cross sections and extract effective diffusion lengths for electrons and holes as a function of local thickness. The values are orders of magnitude smaller than those obtained by SEM-EBIC on bulk silicon, reflecting pronounced surface recombination and FIB-induced surface modifications. Current-voltage measurements further reveal severe deviations from the expected diode-like behavior, which we attribute to ohmic metal-semiconductor contacts in the emasurement setup. Our analysis establishes STEM-EBIC as a quantitative probe of carrier transport in nanoscale devices.
