- **TL;DR**: 构建了一个包含电子自相互作用高阶耦合项的简单全息模型，能够展示Mott绝缘体的典型行为，包括金属-绝缘体转变和直流电导率随电荷密度增加而降低。交流电导率分析显示软间隙特征，当直流电导率接近零时出现多峰结构，对应实验观测的Mott和电荷转移间隙。

We construct a simple holographic model incorporating higher-order coupling terms for electron self-interactions. It can exhibit typical behavior of a Mott insulator, including a metal-insulator transition and a decrease in DC conductivity with the increase of charge density. In the analysis of AC conductivity, a soft gap is generally observed. Notably, when the DC conductivity approaches zero, the AC conductivity reveals a multi-peak structure, which can be attributed to the Mott and charge-transfer gaps observed experimentally in transition metals. With the increase of DC conductivity, the multi-peak structure gradually reverts to soft-gap behavior or even metallic conductivity. The numerical reliability is confirmed by the agreement between zero-frequency AC and DC conductivities.

- **TL;DR**: 研究了圆偏振光周期性驱动下方形晶格Hubbard模型中磁序与超导性的相互作用，发现通过Floquet工程可以实现从d+id波到p波拓扑超导的调控。

We study the interplay of magnetic order and superconductivity in the square-lattice Hubbard model under periodic driving with circularly polarized light. Formulating diagrammatic techniques based on the random-phase approximation in terms of Floquet Green's functions, allows us to analyze fluctuation-driven unconventional pairing for weak-to-moderate interactions. The interplay of repulsive interactions and photo-assisted hopping of electrons gives rise to a rich magnetic phase diagram featuring an antiferromagnetic-to-ferromagnetic crossover prior to a Floquet Lifshitz transition. Close to the antiferromagnetic transition, topological $d+id$-wave superconductivity prevails in the phase diagram for a wide range of drive parameters. At intermediate-to-high frequency driving near the Floquet Lifshitz transition, superconducting orders are tuned from spin-singlet $d$-wave to spin-triplet $p$-wave character, providing an effective protocol for Floquet engineering topological superconductivity.

- **TL;DR**: 通过原子级分辨的散粒噪声研究，在原子尺度的纳米机电系统中证明了通过振动耦合实现电子聚束的可能性。

Due to the Coulomb blockade effect, electrons rarely bunch during transport, a phenomenon observed only in a few specially engineered mesoscopic configurations. In this work, we introduce an atomically resolved shot-noise study to demonstrate the possibility of electron bunching through vibrational coupling which takes place in an atomically sized nano-electro-mechanical system. Using tunnelling spectroscopy, we observe signatures of vibron-assisted tunnelling on an Fe impurity in Bi$_2$Se$_3$. Notably, simultaneous shot-noise measurements at the centre of the vibrating impurity reveal super-Poissonian noise. In the absence of alternative sources of super-Poissonian noise, this implies vibronic-coupling-induced bunching of electrons during the tunnelling process through the impurity, as theoretically predicted decades ago. As a future outlook, if coherence between electrons can be implemented, vibron-mediated electron bunching at single atomic sites may be exploited as a local injection source of $N$-paired electrons.

- **TL;DR**: 研究了Tasaki方格晶格上S=1/2海森堡反铁磁体在饱和磁场附近的低温热力学性质，发现存在属于2D Ising普适类的有序-无序相变

We consider the $S=1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the Tasaki square lattice (flat-band spin system) and study its low-temperature thermodynamics around the saturation magnetic field. To this end, we construct a mapping of the ground states in the subspaces with total $S^z=N/2,\ldots,N/3$ ($N$ is the number of lattice sites) on the hard squares on an auxiliary square lattice and use classical Monte Carlo simulations to examine the latter classical system. The most prominent feature of the $S=1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the Tasaki square lattice is an order-disorder phase transition which occurs at a low temperature just below the saturation magnetic field and belongs to the 2D Ising universality class.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文提出了MOS结构中反型层非线性泊松方程的解析解，解决了1955年以来半导体理论中的基本挑战，为量子感知器件建模提供了新的分析基础。

An analytical solution to the nonlinear Poisson equation governing the inversion layer in metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) structures has recently been obtained, resolving a fundamental challenge in semiconductor theory first identified in 1955. This breakthrough enables the derivation of explicit expressions for relevant physical quantities, such as the inversion-layer width, electric potential, and charge distribution, as functions of gate voltage $V_G$, distance from oxide-semiconductor interface and impurity concentration. These quantities exhibit rapid variation during early-stage inversion but saturate once the gate voltage exceeds the threshold voltage by a few tenths of a volt signaling a transition in the MOS response to $V_G$. The onset of tunneling through the Esaki barrier leads to increased charge accumulation near the interface, reshaping the charge distribution into a two-dimensional profile and shifting the potential drop from the semiconductor to the oxide layer. This reconfiguration resembles the behavior of an ideal parallel-plate capacitor, with charge confined at the interface and the voltage drop localized across the oxide. We analyze this mechanism in detail and demonstrate, through explicit calculations, that the tunneling current through the Esaki-like barrier formed during inversion becomes dominant, effectively superseding classical inversion behavior. These results offer a new analytical foundation for quantum-aware device modeling and inform the design of next-generation MOSFET and tunneling FET architectures.

- **TL;DR**: 分析q=3的二维Potts模型，通过配分函数零点确定改变相变阶数的临界相互作用邻居数

Two dimensional Potts model is a classical example where the symmetry of the order parameter controls the order of a phase transition: on a square lattice with nearest-neighbours interaction, when the number of states $q$ is less than or equal to 4, the second-order phase transition is observed, while for $q&gt;4$ the first-order phase transition occurs. Recent research shows that even when the number of states is fixed, increasing the interaction range allows one to reach the point where the order of the phase transition changes. We focus on a $q=3$ 2D Potts model and, from the analysis of the partition function zeros, locate the number of interacting neighbours that change the order of the phase transition.

- **TL;DR**: 使用微扰理论研究Ge/Si核壳纳米线的电子结构，发现低对称性生长方向会出现轨道反转和准平带效应，可选择性调控有效质量。

We theoretically explore the electronic structure of holes in cylindrical Germanium/Silicon core/shell nanowires using a perturbation theory approach. The approach yields a set of interpretable and transferable effective low-energy models for the lowest few sub-bands up to fifth order for experimentally relevant growth directions. In particular, we are able to resolve higher order cross terms e.g., the dependency of the effective mass on the magnetic field. Our study reveals orbital inversions of the lowest sub-bands for low-symmetry growth directions, leading to significant changes of the lower order effective coefficients. We demonstrate a reduction of the direct Rashba spin-orbit interaction due to competing symmetry effects for low-symmetry growth directions. Finally, we find that the effective mass of the confined holes can diverge yielding quasi flat bands interesting for correlated states. We show how one can tune the effective mass of a single spin band allowing one to tune the effective mass selectively to its divergent points.

- **TL;DR**: 通过周期性调制二维XY模型中的刚度，研究发现即使平均耦合不变，驱动也能显著增强远高于平衡BKT温度时的长程时间平均关联，为增强XY类系统的相干性提供了一条非平衡路径。

Strong optical drives have been shown to induce transient superconducting-like response in materials above their equilibrium $T_c$. Many of these materials already exhibit short-range superconducting correlations in equilibrium. This motivates the question: can external driving enhance coherence in systems with superconducting correlations but no long-range order? We explore this scenario in the two-dimensional XY model with a periodically modulated stiffness using overdamped Langevin dynamics. We find that, even though the modulation leaves the average coupling unchanged, the drive can markedly increase long-range, time-averaged correlations in systems well above the equilibrium Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless temperature. The outcome depends on the ratio of the drive frequency to the intrinsic relaxation rate: faster drives primarily heat the system, suppressing correlations and conductivity. For slower drives, the optical conductivity is modified so that the real part exhibits a prolonged effective Drude scattering time, while the imaginary part has a strengthened low-frequency $1/ω$ behavior. We map out these regimes across temperature, frequency, and amplitude, and rationalize them via simple analytics and vortex-thermalization arguments. Overall, we identify a generic nonequilibrium route to enhance coherence in XY-like systems, with potential relevance to experiments reporting light-induced superconductivity.

- **TL;DR**: PolyOmics是一个通过自动化分子动力学模拟生成的大规模聚合物计算数据库，包含超过10^5种聚合物的多种物理性质，用于推动AI驱动的聚合物科学研究。

Developing large-scale foundational datasets is a critical milestone in advancing artificial intelligence (AI)-driven scientific innovation. However, unlike AI-mature fields such as natural language processing, materials science, particularly polymer research, has significantly lagged in developing extensive open datasets. This lag is primarily due to the high costs of polymer synthesis and property measurements, along with the vastness and complexity of the chemical space. This study presents PolyOmics, an omics-scale computational database generated through fully automated molecular dynamics simulation pipelines that provide diverse physical properties for over $10^5$ polymeric materials. The PolyOmics database is collaboratively developed by approximately 260 researchers from 48 institutions to bridge the gap between academia and industry. Machine learning models pretrained on PolyOmics can be efficiently fine-tuned for a wide range of real-world downstream tasks, even when only limited experimental data are available. Notably, the generalisation capability of these simulation-to-real transfer models improve significantly as the size of the PolyOmics database increases, exhibiting power-law scaling. The emergence of scaling laws supports the "more is better" principle, highlighting the significance of ultralarge-scale computational materials data for improving real-world prediction performance. This unprecedented omics-scale database reveals vast unexplored regions of polymer materials, providing a foundation for AI-driven polymer science.

### Spin-orbit coupled periodic Anderson model: Kondo-Dirac semimetal and orbital-selective antiferromagnetic semimetal

- **TL;DR**: 研究了具有自旋轨道耦合的周期性安德森模型，揭示了Kondo-Dirac半金属相和新型反铁磁半金属相，其中自旋轨道耦合导致狄拉克锥形成，结合对称性破缺可产生新的拓扑态。

We investigate the periodic Anderson model composed of an itinerant $c$-band and a strongly localized $f$-band, featuring on-site electron-electron interactions in the $f$-orbitals. The two bands interact via a hybridization term with spin-orbit coupling, which enables spin-flip processes. In the non-interacting limit, these profoundly alter the electronic structure, leading to the emergence of flat bands, van Hove singularities, and, most notably, Dirac cones within a single Kondo-Dirac semimetal order. The strongly interacting regime is explored via the determinant quantum Monte Carlo method, in the absence of the sign problem, where we unveil a complete ground-state phase diagram revealing two distinct phases, the Kondo-Dirac semimetal phase and a novel antiferromagnetic semimetal phase. Their characterization by the spectral functions establishes an orbital-selective Mott transition in the antiferromagnetic semimetal phase, marked by the opening of a gap exclusively in the $f$-orbital while Dirac cones persist in the $c$-orbital. Conversely, in the Kondo-Dirac semimetal phase, both $c$- and $f$-orbitals sustain robust Dirac cones. We establish that spin-orbit coupling in the hybridization term gives rise to Dirac cones, which, combined with additional symmetry-breaking conditions, can generate novel topological states.

- **TL;DR**: 研究量子随机力学中的局域化问题，通过Edwards模型分析粒子在散射中心浴中的基态波函数局域化，并讨论动力学行为和Lax模型的仿射量子化版本。

We study the localization problem in quantum stochastic mechanics. We start from the Edwards model for a particle in a bath of scattering centers and prove static localization of the ground state wavefunction of the particle in a one dimensional square well coupled to Dirac delta like scattering centers in arbitrary but fixed positions. We see how the localization increases for increasing coupling $g$. Then we choose the scattering centers positions as pseudo random numbers with a uniform probability distribution and observe an increase in the localization of the average of the ground state over the many positions realizations. We discuss how this averaging procedure is consistent with a picture of a particle in a Bose-Einstein condensate of of non interacting boson scattering centers interacting with the particle with Dirac delta functions pair potential. We then study the dynamics of the ground state wave function. We conclude with a discussion of the affine quantization version of the Lax model which reduces to a system of contiguous square wells with walls in arbitrary positions independently of the coupling constant $g$.

### The distribution of the moment of inertia for harmonically trapped noninteracting Bosons at finite temperature: large deviations

- **TL;DR**: 本文计算了在谐振势中非相互作用玻色气体转动惯量的完整概率分布，发现在热力学极限下该分布呈现大偏差形式，其速率函数在临界点出现奇异性，这与BEC相变直接相关。

We compute the full probability distribution of the moment of inertia $I \propto \sum_{i=1}^N \vec{r}_i^{\,2}$ of a gas of $N$ noninteracting bosons trapped in a harmonic potential $V(r) = (1/2)\, m\, ω^2 r^2$, in all dimensions and at all temperature. The appropriate thermodynamic limit in a trapped Bose gas consists in taking the limit $N\to \infty$ and $ω\to 0$ with their product $ρ= N ω^d$ fixed, where $ρ$ plays the role analogous to the density in a translationally invariant system. In this thermodynamic limit and in dimensions $d&gt;1$, the harmonically trapped Bose gas undergoes a Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) transition as the density $ρ$ crosses a critical value $ρ_c(β)$, where $β$ denotes the inverse temperature. We show that the probability distribution $P_β(I,N)$ of $I$ admits a large deviation form $P_β(I,N) \sim e^{-V Φ(I/V)}$ where $V = ω^{-d} \gg 1$. We compute explicitly the rate function $Φ(z)$ and show that it exhibits a singularity at a critical value $z=z_c$ where its second derivative undergoes a discontinuous jump. We show that the existence of such a singularity in the rate function is directly related to the existence of a BEC transition and it disappears when the system does not have a BEC transition as in $d \leq 1$. An interesting consequence of our results is that even if the actual system is in the fluid phase, i.e., when $ρ&lt; ρ_c(β)$, by measuring the distribution of $I$ and analysing the singularity in the associated rate function, one can get a signal of the BEC transition in $d&gt;1$. This provides a real space diagnostic for the BEC transition in the noninteracting Bose gas.

We describe two 3D-printing approaches for realizing tight-binding models in acoustic metamaterials using H-shaped resonators: a modular system with tunable interconnections and an integrated one-piece design for reducing dissipation. The platform supports both positive and negative coupling through geometric control, enabling accurate acoustic analogs of topological models. By tuning the coupling length (CL), we eliminate detuning effects and preserve particle-hole symmetry. We further quantify the influence of the Total Coupling Area (TCA) on band topology and derive conditions for constant-area coupling. The system was tested on SSH and Kitaev chains, revealing midgap edge and interface states, confirming topological behavior in both configurations.

- **TL;DR**: 在KTaO3氧化物界面中，通过0.8%铌掺杂使其接近铁电量子临界点，显著增强了超导性，超导转变温度几乎翻倍达到2.9K，并出现了圆顶形载流子密度依赖性。

Superconductivity at oxide interfaces has intrigued researchers for decades, yet the underlying pairing mechanism remains elusive. Here we demonstrate that proximity to a ferroelectric quantum critical point dramatically enhances interfacial superconductivity in KTaO3. By precisely tuning KTaO3 to its quantum critical composition through 0.8% niobium doping, we achieve a near-doubling of the superconducting transition temperature, reaching 2.9 K. Remarkably, a dome-shaped carrier density dependence emerges exclusively at the quantum critical point, contrasting sharply with the linear scaling observed in undoped interfaces. Our findings establish ferroelectric quantum criticality as a powerful mechanism for enhancing superconductivity and provide compelling evidence for soft-phonon-mediated pairing in these systems.

Despite the long history of electrochemistry, there is a lack of quantitative algorithms that rigorously correlate experiment with theory. Electrochemical modeling has had advanced across empirical, analytical, numerical, and data-driven paradigms. Data-driven machine learning and physics based electrochemical modeling, however, have not been explicitly linked. Here we introduce Differentiable Electrochemistry, a mew paradigm in electrochemical modeling that integrates thermodynamics, kinetics and mass transport with differentiable programming enabled by automatic differentiation. By making the entire electrochemical simulation end-to-end differentiable, this framework enables gradient-based optimization for mechanistic discovery from experimental and simulation data, achieving approximately one to two orders of improvement over gradient-free methods. We develop a rich repository of differentiable simulators across diverse mechanisms, and apply Differentiable Electrochemistry to bottleneck problems in kinetic analysis. Specifically, Differentiable Electrochemistry advances beyond Tafel and Nicholson method by removing several limitations including Tafel region selection, and identifies the electron transfer mechanism in Li metal electrodeposition/stripping by parameterizing the full Marcus-Hush-Chidsey formalism. In addition, Differentiable Electrochemistry interprets Operando X-ray measurements in concentrated electrolyte by coupling concentration and velocity theories. This framework resolves ambiguity when multiple electrochemical theories intertwine, and establishes a physics-consistent and data-efficient foundation for predictive electrochemical modeling.

- **TL;DR**: 验证量子-经典方法在多声子模式Holstein模型和Peierls模型中的可靠性，计算红荧烯有机半导体的频率依赖性电荷迁移率，并与最先进的层次运动方程方法结果一致。

Building on the recent success of a quantum-classical method for computing transport properties in the Holstein model with a single phonon mode [Phys. Rev. B ${\bf 111}$, L161105 (2025)], we now assess its reliability in more realistic scenarios involving multiple phonon modes in the Holstein model, as well as single- and multi-mode Peierls models. For parameters relevant to the prototypical organic semiconductor rubrene, we compute the frequency-dependent charge mobility and find excellent agreement with results from the state-of-the-art hierarchical equations of motion method. These results show that the method, previously validated only for the single-mode Holstein model, preserves quantitative accuracy in substantially more complex and material-relevant regimes. Our microscopic approach complements the phenomenological transient-localization theory and is readily applicable to realistic electron-phonon Hamiltonians.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究通过拉曼光谱观察了少层Cr₂Ge₂Te₆中的层呼吸模式，分析了层数与晶格动力学的关系，定量提取了层间力常数以衡量范德华耦合强度。

Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) magnetic materials have emerged as key materials for next-generation magneto-electric and spintronic devices, where understanding the relationship between layer number, lattice dynamics, and magnetic interactions is very important. In this work, we report the observation of the layer breathing mode (LBM) in few-layer $\mathrm{Cr_2Ge_2Te_6}$, a ferromagnetic semiconductor with thickness dependent electronic, magnetic and optical properties, using Raman spectroscopy, which serves as a direct fingerprint of interlayer coupling and lattice symmetry. Group-theoretical symmetry analysis confirms that the CGT falls under the non-polar category of layered material. The evolution of the LBM-frequency with increasing layer number (N) reveals a distinct softening trend, characteristic of weakening restoring forces in thicker flakes. By fitting the experimental Raman data using the Linear Chain Model (LCM), we quantitatively extract the interlayer force constant ($\mathrm{K_c}$), providing a measure of the vdW coupling strength between layers.

The study of spins and particles on graphs has many applications across different fields, from time dynamics on networks to the solution of combinatorial problems. Here, we study the large n limit of the $O(n)$ model on general graphs, which is considerably more difficult than on regular lattices. Indeed, the loss of translational invariance gives rise to an infinite set of saddle point constraints in the thermodynamic limit. We show that the free energy at low and high temperature $T$ is determined by the spectrum of two crucial objects from graph theory: the Laplacian matrix at low $T$ and the Adjacency matrix at high $T$. Their interplay is studied in several classes of graphs. For regular lattices the two coincide. We obtain an exact solution on trees, where the Lagrange multipliers interestingly depend solely on the number of nearest neighbors. For decorated lattices, the singular part of the free energy is governed by the Laplacian spectrum, whereas this is true for the full free energy only in the zero temperature limit. Finally, we discuss a bipartite fully connected graph to highlight the importance of a finite coordination number in these results. Results for quantum spin models on a loopless graph are also presented.

Understanding O2 bubble nucleation and growth during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial to comprehend their influences on catalytically active sites in the process. To achieve this goal, mapping the spatial variation of nanoscale dynamic individual steps at the electrocatalytic interfaces is vital, as it further enables a detailed understanding of the mechanism of the process. Here, we combined tapping mode AFM imaging with a Pt ultramicroelectrode to investigate oxygen bubble nucleation, growth, and detachment. Our AFM feedback error signal and topography data reveal that bubbles of O2 gas nucleate at the step edge sites and interact with the catalytically active sites. This interaction between primary catalytic sites and bubble nucleation sites is the primary reason for a decrease in the current density at a given high overpotential of the OER. Our findings advance the understanding of the complexity of phenomena involved in gas evolution on catalytic surfaces.

Starting from the purely microscopic model, we go beyond conventional mean-field theory and develop a self-consistent microscopic thermodynamic framework for disordered 2D superconductors. It incorporates the fermionic Bogoliubov quasiparticles, bosonic Nambu-Goldstone (NG) quantum and thermal phase fluctuations in the presence of long-range Coulomb interactions, and topological Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) vortex-antivortex fluctuations on an equal footing, to self-consistently treat the superconducting gap and superfluid density. This unified phase-fluctuating description naturally recovers the previously known limiting results: the superconducting gap in the 2D limit can remain robust against long-wavelength NG phase fluctuations at $T=0^+$ due to Coulomb-induced regularization, while the gradual proliferation of BKT fluctuations as the system approaches criticality drives a separation between the global superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ and the gap-closing temperature $T^*$. In contrast to mean-field theory, which predicts 2D superconductivity to be independent of carrier density and non-magnetic disorder (Anderson theorem), the incorporation of phase fluctuations generates a density- and disorder-dependent zero-point gap $Δ(0)$ and consequently $T_c$ and $T^*$. Remarkably, applications to bilayer MoS$_2$ [Nat. Nanotechnol. 14, 1123 (2019)] and disordered InO$_x$ thin films [Nat. Phys. 21, 104 (2025)] quantitatively reproduce key experimental observations in excellent agreement. The framework offers a useful theoretical tool for understanding phase-fluctuation-dominated superconductivity.

- **TL;DR**: Socrates-Mol是一个通过上下文工程将语言模型转化为经验贝叶斯推理器的框架，无需微调即可解决冷启动问题，在分子性质预测中显著降低部署成本。

Molecular property prediction is fundamental to chemical engineering applications such as solvent screening. We present Socrates-Mol, a framework that transforms language models into empirical Bayesian reasoners through context engineering, addressing cold start problems without model fine-tuning. The system implements a reflective-prediction cycle where initial outputs serve as priors, retrieved molecular cases provide evidence, and refined predictions form posteriors, extracting reusable chemical rules from sparse data. We introduce ranking tasks aligned with industrial screening priorities and employ cross-model self-consistency across five language models to reduce variance. Experiments on amine solvent LogP prediction reveal task-dependent patterns: regression achieves 72% MAE reduction and 112% R-squared improvement through self-consistency, while ranking tasks show limited gains due to systematic multi-model biases. The framework reduces deployment costs by over 70% compared to full fine-tuning, providing a scalable solution for molecular property prediction while elucidating the task-adaptive nature of self-consistency mechanisms.

Macroscopic dynamical descriptions of complex physical systems are crucial for understanding and controlling material behavior. With the growing availability of data and compute, machine learning has become a promising alternative to first-principles methods to build accurate macroscopic models from microscopic trajectory simulations. However, for spatially extended systems, direct simulations of sufficiently large microscopic systems that inform macroscopic behavior is prohibitive. In this work, we propose a framework that learns the macroscopic dynamics of large stochastic microscopic systems using only small-system simulations. Our framework employs a partial evolution scheme to generate training data pairs by evolving large-system snapshots within local patches. We subsequently identify the closure variables associated with the macroscopic observables and learn the macroscopic dynamics using a custom loss. Furthermore, we introduce a hierarchical upsampling scheme that enables efficient generation of large-system snapshots from small-system trajectory distributions. We empirically demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of our framework through a variety of stochastic spatially extended systems, including those described by stochastic partial differential equations, idealised lattice spin systems, and a more realistic NbMoTa alloy system.

CeRu$_2$Si$_2$ is a well-known heavy fermion paramagnet, and substituting Ge for Si induces antiferromagnetism. This antiferromagnetism is Ising-like and has a tricritical point in the magnetic field ($H$) -temperature ($T$) phase diagram. Since the temperature of the tricritical point is expected to decrease with increasing pressure ($P$), we investigated the pressure dependence of the magnetic phase transitions. We determined the $H$-$P$ phase diagram and revealed that a first-order phase-transition line changes to a quantum critical line, which implies the existence of the quantum tricritical point. A ferromagnetic quantum fluctuation arises in the vicinity of the possible quantum tricritical point.

- **TL;DR**: 研究了Y掺杂对BCFZY钙钛矿材料氧电导率的影响，发现Y掺杂会降低氧电导率，且微观结构特征如晶界会显著限制实际材料中的氧传输。

Proton ceramic fuel cells (PCFCs) achieve high efficiency at reduced operating temperatures, but their performance is often limited by slow oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics at the cathode. The BaCoFeZrY (BCFZY) perovskite family is a promising triple-conducting air-electrode material, yet the role of Y dopants in governing oxygen transport remains unclear. In this study, we examine the effect of Y content on oxygen conductivity in three compositions: BCFZ, BCFZY0.1, and BCFY. Oxygen conductivity was evaluated from the product of oxygen tracer diffusivity and oxygen defect concentration. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations were used to determine tracer diffusivity and migration energies, while defect concentrations were estimated from reference data. Y doping slightly decreases oxygen conductivity from BCFZ to BCFZY0.1, from 337 to 203 mS/cm at 500 C, with activation energies of 0.155 and 0.172 eV. BCFY shows much lower conductivity (99 mS/cm) and a higher activation energy of 0.261 eV. Computed conductivities are higher and more Arrhenius-like than experimental values, suggesting that microstructural features such as grain boundaries strongly limit oxygen transport in real materials. A series-circuit model combining bulk conductivity and fitted grain-boundary parameters provides semi-quantitative agreement with experiment. These results clarify the role of Y doping in oxygen transport and provide insight for optimizing cathode performance in PCFCs.

### Full counting statistics for boundary driven transport in presence of correlated gain and loss channels

One of the major advances of quantum technology is the engineering of complex quantum channels in lattice systems that paves the way for a variety of novel non-equilibrium phenomena. For a boundary driven lattice with such engineered quantum channels, the analysis of the full counting statistics of current across boundaries has received limited attention. In this work, we consider a boundary driven free fermionic lattice with carefully engineered correlated gain and loss channels and obtain the cumulant generating function of the steady-state particle current. We also discuss the limit for simplifying the correlated gain-loss channel to a local gain-loss channel and obtain the average current and its fluctuation in such cases. Generally, in the presence of gain-loss, the current statistics are different at the two ends of the lattice. Hence, for both local and correlated gain-loss, we devise the conditions for which the statistics can coincide, giving rise to a $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetric balanced gain-loss scenario. A striking difference between the correlated gain-loss and their local counterpart is the emergence of nonreciprocity in the system and we observe that it has a dramatic impact in the current as well as fluctuations. Our work therefore provides interesting insights about the importance of engineered dissipators in boundary driven systems.

Understanding charge transport in networks of two-dimensional crystals is essential for developing reliable applications such as chemiresistors or electromagnetic shields. For this purpose, intra- and inter-flake contributions to the network resistance must be disentangled. MXenes, such as Ti3C2Tx, are prime examples of 2D crystals often employed as thin networks of interconnected flakes deposited on substrates to realize functional devices. While a significant number of studies focused on transport in individual MXene flakes, inter-flake transport remains scarcely explored. Here, we demonstrate that charge transport in multi-flake conductive paths of Ti3C2Tx is dominated by interflake junctions and provide quantitative estimates of junction resistances. Scanning probe measurements reveal that in a MXene multi-flake conductive path, individual flakes behave as isopotential domains, since the voltage drop is localized precisely at the inter-flake junctions. We further investigate the chemiresistive response to humidity at the single flake, multi-flake and flake network scale, evidencing the leading impact of junctions on sensing kinetics. These findings underline the crucial role of junctions in charge transport and sensing capabilities of MXenes.

Materials with graphene-like layers attract tremendous attention due to their electronic structures and superconducting properties. In this study, we synthesized LaP2 polycrystalline and observed a superconducting transition around 30 GPa. The critical temperature Tc increases monotonically with pressure, which is nearing saturation and reaches 7.8 K at 78 GPa. The synchrotron X-ray diffraction experiments confirm the superconducting transition originates from a structure transition to the P6/mmm phase under high pressure, suggesting the observation of graphene-like phosphorus layers in transition metal phosphides. By first-principles calculations, we provide more evidence for the stability of the graphene-like phosphorus layers in LaP2. Our findings are helpful for the understanding of the LaP2 phase diagram under high pressure, and could shed light on the research of unique structures in transition metal phosphides under high pressure.

Coarse-graining (CG) reduces molecular details to extend the time and length scales of molecular dynamics simulations to microseconds and micrometers. However, the CG approaches have long been limited by the difficulty of constructing both accurate and transferable models efficiently, considering the large diversity of chemical structures of materials. Among CG force fields, Martini is the most widely used, as it retains essential chemical features while offering substantial computational efficiency. Its most recent version, Martini 3, expands chemical resolution through a much broader bead set, particularly for small molecules. Still, this flexibility also complicates the mapping of organic molecules because of context-dependent rules and the lack of standardized procedures. To address this issue, we present an automated framework that builds Martini 3 models directly from SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) strings by combining a curated bead dictionary with a hierarchical, rule-based algorithm. Our framework generated Martini 3 models for more than 5,000 molecules across four chemically diverse datasets. A curated subset of 1,081 mapped structures was benchmarked through octanol-water free-energy ($ΔG_{OW}$) and partition-coefficient ($\log P$) calculations, yielding strong agreement with experimental values. The workflow can also map large molecules containing up to 126 heavy atoms, exceeding the capabilities of existing automated approaches. The algorithm and the complete set of more than 5,000 mapped itp/top files are available at the \href{https://github.com/eliobaby/Martini_mapping}{Martini Mapper}. Our framework, therefore, enables systematic and scalable Martini 3 structures for high-throughput simulations relevant to drug discovery and materials design.

High-harmonic generation (HHG) in two-dimensional materials offers a compelling route toward compact extreme ultraviolet sources and probing electron dynamics on the attosecond scale. However, achieving precise control over the emission and disentangling the complex interplay between intraband and interband quantum pathways remains a central challenge. Here, we demonstrate through first-principles simulations that HHG in monolayer WS2 can be subjected to precise, complementary control by combining all-optical two-color laser fields with mechanical strain engineering. This dual-mode strategy provides unprecedented, orthogonal control over harmonic yield, polarization, and spectral features. We reveal that sculpting the two-color field's relative phase provides a sub-femtosecond switch for the quantum coherence of electron-hole pairs, thereby maximizing harmonic emission. Crucially, we uncover that tensile strain acts as a powerful amplifier through a dual mechanism - while strain-modified band dispersion enhances the intraband current, a profound reshaping of the Berry curvature (BC) dramatically boosts the anomalous velocity contribution to the interband response. This quantum geometric effect manifests as a robust, linear dependence of the harmonic yield on strain and a significant amplification of the perpendicularly polarized harmonics, providing a clear experimental signature for probing quantum geometric effects. Our findings establish a versatile framework for optimizing solid-state HHG and introduce a powerful all-optical method to map strain and quantum geometric properties of materials, positioning monolayer WS2 as a model system for exploring attosecond physics at the nexus of bulk and atomic scales.

### PT-Symmetric Magnon Lasing and Anti-Lasing

A mechanism for electrically tunable PT-symmetric magnonic lasing and anti-lasing is proposed along with a device consisting of a current-biased region in a magnetically ordered planar waveguide. Within the bias area, several heavy-metal wires carrying dc charge current are periodically attached to the waveguide and exert so spatially periodic spin-orbit torques, producing current-controllable modulated magnon gain and loss. It is demonstrated that this decorated waveguide can emit a strong, single frequency magnon mode at the Bragg point (lasing) and also absorb at the same frequency phase-matched incoming coherent magnons (anti-lasing). The underlying physics is captured by an analytical model and validated with full material and device-specific numerical simulations. The magnonic laser absorber response is tunable via the current density in the wires, the extent of the biased region, and the intrinsic damping, enabling the control of lasing frequency and emission power. The structure is shown to amplify thermal magnons, offering a route to low-noise on-chip microwave sources. The concept is compatible with planar waveguides, ring geometries, and antiferromagnets. The results establish an experimentally realistic platform where a single element functions simultaneously as both magnon laser and absorber, opening opportunities for reconfigurable non-Hermitian magnonics and integrated magnon signal processing.

Future lithium-based batteries are expected to use solid electrolytes to achieve higher energy density and fast charge capabilities. The majority of solid electrolytes are thermodynamically unstable against layered oxide cathodes. Here, the stability of LiCoO2 (LCO) cathode with Li10GeP2S12 (LGPS) solid electrolyte is investigated using ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) and machine learning molecular dynamics (MLMD). The propensity of ionic interdiffusion, formation of a passivation layer, and corresponding decay in cell performance is addressed using a continuum model. The large-scale MLMD simulations confirm that the LCO|LGPS interface permits interdiffusion of Co and other ionic species, leading to the formation and growth of a resistive interphase and dramatic capacity fade even in the first cycle. We then examine the literature evidence that incorporating a thin layer of LiNb0.5Ta0.5O3 (LNTO) between LCO and LGPS prevents the interdiffusion of ions. Atomistic simulations suggest that the substitution of Li in LNTO with Co is not thermodynamically favorable, which helps to minimize the ionic interdiffusion process. The stable Nb/Ta5+ states form a rigid metal-oxide framework, which consequently also prevents the substitution of Nb/Ta. However, continuum level analysis suggests that due to the higher mechanical stiffness of LNTO, interfacial delamination between the LCO and LNTO is possible, which can minimize the effectiveness of the protective layer. This paper suggests the need for the development of novel interlayers that balance low interdiffusion with low stiffness.

We present a symmetry-based formulation of nonlinear fluctuating hydrodynamics (NFH) for one-dimensional many-particle systems with generic homogeneous nearest-neighbor interactions. We derive the hydrodynamic equations solely from symmetry and conservation principles, ensuring full consistency with thermalization. Using the dynamic renormalization group, we show that both the sound and heat modes share the dynamical exponent $z=3/2$. Extensive numerical simulations of the derived NFH equations confirm this exponent and further reveal that both modes are close to the universal KPZ scaling function, namely the Prähofer-Spohn function. These findings establish a unified, symmetry-based framework for understanding universal transport and fluctuation phenomena in one-dimensional nonequilibrium systems, independent of microscopic details.

This work treats the dynamics of pairs of microelectromechanical ultrasound transducers (MUTs) that are immersed in water and acoustically coupled through the fluid medium. A series of these transducer pairs with varying diameters (and thus resonance frequency) and pitch separation (and thus coupling strength) are fabricated and measured. The work presented here models and quantifies the open-loop coupling between the MEMS transducer pairs and its dependence on pitch. Furthermore, a gain feedback loop is systematically applied to one of the device pair and the dynamics of the acoustically-coupled gain-loss system is investigated, and the formation of an exceptional-point or of an Hopf bifurcation is equally used to quantify the coupling coefficient. This work provides an experimental study of acoustic coupling in MUT transducers, as well as an exploration of the formation of exceptional points in acoustically-coupled MEMS transducers.

Two-dimensional superconductors undergo a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition driven by vortex-antivortex unbinding, yet experimental signatures beyond transport remain limited. Here, we show that the spin-lattice relaxation rate provides a direct probe of this transition. In a 2-dimensional $s$-wave superconductor, $1/T_1T$ develops a Hebel-Slichter-like peak around $T_{\rm{BKT}}$, originating from the emergence of coherence peaks in the density of states, while no peak appears at the pair formation scale $T_{\rm{BCS}}$. We further extend our analysis to the $d$-wave superconductor. Our results highlight spin-lattice relaxation rate as a sensitive tool to detect the superconducting BKT transition and open routes to exploring its manifestation in unconventional pairing states.

Obtaining 3D conformations of realistic polyatomic molecules at the quantum chemistry level remains challenging, and although recent machine learning advances offer promise, predicting large-molecule structures still requires substantial computational effort. Here, we introduce StoL, a diffusion model-based framework that enables rapid and knowledge-free generation of large molecular structures from small-molecule data. Remarkably, StoL assembles molecules in a LEGO-style fashion from scratch, without seeing the target molecules or any structures of comparable size during training. Given a SMILES input, it decomposes the molecule into chemically valid fragments, generates their 3D structures with a diffusion model trained on small molecules, and assembles them into diverse conformations. This fragment-based strategy eliminates the need for large-molecule training data while maintaining high scalability and transferability. By embedding chemical principles into key steps, StoL ensures faster convergence, chemically rational structures, and broad configurational coverage, as confirmed against DFT calculations.

This work presents a case study of a heterogeneous multiphysics solver from the nuclear fusion domain. At the macroscopic scale, an auto-differentiable ODE solver in JAX computes the evolution of the pulsed power circuit and bulk plasma parameters for a compressing Z Pinch. The ODE solver requires a closure for the impedance of the plasma load obtained via root-finding at every timestep, which we solve efficiently using gradient-based Newton iteration. However, incorporating non-differentiable production-grade plasma solvers like Gkeyll (a C/CUDA plasma simulation suite) into a gradient-based workflow is non-trivial. The ''Tesseract'' software addresses this challenge by providing a multi-physics differentiable abstraction layer made fully compatible with JAX (through the `tesseract_jax` adapter). This architecture ensures end-to-end differentiability while allowing seamless interchange between high-fidelity solvers (Gkeyll), neural surrogates, and analytical approximations for rapid, progressive prototyping.

- **TL;DR**: PrMgAl11O19在低温下表现出量子顺电性，其介电响应与磁化强度存在显著耦合，磁场的应用会改变介电异常的温度位置，揭示了强磁电耦合效应。

We report broadband dielectric spectra of the non-Kramers hexaaluminate PrMgAl(*{11})O(*{19}), revealing a pronounced interplay between permittivity and magnetization at cryogenic temperatures. The zero-field dielectric response follows a Barrett-type quantum-paraelectric form, while a broad dielectric anomaly near 5 K shifts systematically to higher temperatures under applied magnetic fields, evidencing robust magnetoelectric coupling. The inverse permittivity (\varepsilon'^{-1}(T,H)) scales linearly with (M^{2}), consistent with a biquadratic (P^{2}M^{2}) term in a Landau framework. Fits yield temperature-dependent coupling constants (λ(T)) that decrease with heating, reflecting the thermal population of low-lying energy levels of Pr(^{3+}).
  These results identify PrMgAl(*{11})O(*{19}) as a paradigmatic non-Kramers hexaaluminate where quantum paraelectricity and magnetoelectric interactions are intrinsically entangled, establishing hexaaluminates as a tunable platform for magnetoelectric physics in frustrated quantum materials.

The Iridium-based oxides are the subject of great recent interest due to the non-conventional physics that may emerge from the strong spin-orbit coupling present in 5d ions. Here, we explore the coupling between Ir and Co in the La2-xBaxCoIrO6 perovskites (x = 0, 0.5, 0.75 and 1.0), where the structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of the series are investigated by means of x-ray powder diffraction and magnetometry. The system's crystal structure evolves from the monoclinic P2_1/n to the triclinic I-1 space group as the Ba concentration increases. Measurements of magnetization revealed ferrimagnetic behavior in x = 0, 0.5 and 0.75 compounds, possibly resulting from antiferromagnetic coupling between Co2+/3+ and Ir4+. In contrast, for x = 1.0 a clear collinear antiferromagnetic character is observed for the Co2+ ions, resulting from the quenching of the Ir5+ magnetic moment. The evolution of the magnetic properties of the series is discussed in terms of the structural and electronic changes, as well as the spin-orbit coupling in Ir.

### Dissimilarity measures for generalized Lotka-Volterra systems on networks

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一个量化广义Lotka-Volterra动力学过程差异的通用框架，涵盖从经典捕食者-猎物系统到网络多物种群落，能够捕捉瞬态和稳态动态差异。

In this paper, we introduce a general framework to quantify dissimilarities between generalized Lotka-Volterra dynamical processes, ranging from classical predator-prey systems to multispecies communities interacting on networks. The proposed measures capture both transient and stationary dynamics, allowing systematic comparisons across systems with varying interaction parameters, network weights, or topologies. Our analysis shows that even subtle structural changes can lead to markedly distinct outcomes: in two-species systems, interaction strength and initial conditions strongly affect divergence, while in small directed networks, differences that are invisible at the adjacency-matrix level produce divergent dynamics. In modular networks, the fraction and distribution of negative interactions control the transition from stable to unstable dynamics, with localized perturbations within cliques yielding different global outcomes than distributed ones. Beyond structural variations, the framework also applies when modified processes follow distinct nonlinear equations, demonstrating its versatility. Taken together, these results highlight that dynamical dissimilarity measures provide a powerful tool to analyze robustness, detect structural sensitivity, and predict instabilities in nonlinear systems. More broadly, this approach supports the comparative analysis of biological systems, where complex interaction networks and nonlinear dynamics are central to stability and resilience.

### Fractional Chern Insulators Transition in Non-ideal Flat Bands of Twisted Mono-bilayer Graphene

- **TL;DR**: 在扭曲单层-双层石墨烯中，通过控制几何参数κ，观察到两种分数量子陈绝缘体之间的连续相变。当κ低于转变点时，系统形成非手性Halperin-(112)态；当κ高于转变点时，系统进入Laughlin-1/3相，展现出对量子几何指标退化的鲁棒性。

Fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) in ideal $|C|&gt;1$ flat bands can be viewed as color-entangled composites of $C$ lowest Landau levels, but in realistic moiré systems non-ideal quantum geometry complicates this picture, leaving their stabilization mechanism incompletely understood. Using twisted monolayer-bilayer graphene (tMBG) as a platform, we observe two FCIs joined by a continuous transition controlled by continuum model parameter $κ$, arising from a geometric instability of the Bloch wave functions. For $κ$ below the transition, the target $C=2$ conduction band is geometrically stable and effectively decomposes into two independent $C=1$ color sectors. Although the flat band is non-ideal, the resulting fractional phase is naturally accounted for by the non-chiral Halperin-(112) state with counterpropagating edge modes. Above the transition, the system enters a Laughlin-$1/3$ phase that persists despite further degradation of quantum-geometry indicators. To account for this robustness, we propose a color-separation mechanism beyond global geometric indicators: when the Bloch wave function is geometrically unstable, interactions dynamically split a non-ideal flat band into an ideal subcomponent that hosts the FCI and non-ideal remnants. We corroborate this picture by applying a weak perpendicular magnetic field that acts as a "color separator," explicitly visualizing the ideal subcomponent at the single-particle level. Together, these results establish two different routes by which non-ideal flat bands stabilize FCIs, expanding their viable parameter space and clarifying the interplay between geometry and topological order.

- **TL;DR**: 本文预测了在SQUID和Cooper对晶体管中分别存在Josephson二极管效应和Bloch二极管效应，表现为电流-电压特性的非互易性。

In a SQUID tuned away from half-integer flux (in units of the superconducting flux quantum), the concurrence of multiple Josephson harmonics and an asymmetry between the junctions leads to the Josephson diode effect -- a nonreciprocal current-voltage characteristic manifested as an asymmetry of critical currents at opposite polarities. We predict a dual version of this effect in a gate-tunable Cooper pair transistor placed in series with a highly resistive environment. When tuned away from half-integer gate charge (in units of the Cooper pair charge) it shows an asymmetry of critical voltages at opposite polarities -- a dual diode effect we refer to as the Bloch diode effect. It arises from an asymmetry in the dispersion of the transistor's Bloch bands. A highly resistive environment can be realized with a Josephson junction array, suggesting that such a diode could be implemented using conventional superconducting quantum circuits.

Light-atom chromophores can display properties often associated with heavy-atom compounds, such as intersystem crossing leading to phosphorescence and singlet oxygen generation, yet their use remains comparatively underexplored. Here, we report the synthesis of HM610, a derivative of the benzylidenehydrazinylthiazole light-atom chromophore backbone. Spin-orbit couplings (SOCs), computed with the sf-X2C-S-TDDFT method, follow Slater-Condon rules and predict moderate values. Trajectory surface hopping simulations further illustrate the role of dynamical effects in promoting ISC, yet these results together establish that HM610 has only limited potential as a triplet sensitizer without further structural modification, such as heavy atom substitution. Based on the benchmarked (TD)DFT protocol, a computational set studying six systematic analogues allowed us to study the influence of electron-donating (-OMe) and electron-withdrawing (-CF3) substituents on the common backbone, revealing the impact of substitution on the geometry and photophysics of light-atom analogues of HM610 and paving the way for future studies where the introduction of heavy atoms and their impact on triplet sensitization by this family of chromophores can be probed.

Climate change is one of the 21st centurys major challenges. However, the progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions is perceived as being too slow. Hence, more radical technologies such as stratospheric aerosol injection are entering discussions to limit climate change. This study presents a methodology for evaluating the effects of injecting 20Mt of SO$_2$ into the atmosphere annually on the global radiative balance, photovoltaic potentials, and renewable energy systems under a targeted temperature reduction of 2°C. Results show that the average annual reduction of PV potentials ranges from 0.25% to 4% up to 12% in Northern Europe during summer. The modeled renewable energy systems largely absorb these reductions resulting in minor capacity shifts with larger changes confined to a few systems. The results show that the inherent flexibility of large scale renewable energy systems helps mitigating changes in cost, but understanding this flexibility is crucial to avoid errors in design.

- **TL;DR**: 使用主成分分析(PCA)方法分析哈伯德模型中的关联层次结构，通过精确对角化数据识别电荷、自旋和配对主导的关联机制。

We present a data-driven analysis of correlation hierarchies in the quarter-filled simple and extended Hubbard models by applying principal component analysis (PCA) to exact-diagonalization (ED) data on 3x4 and 4x4 cylindrical clusters. While the non-interacting limit (U=0) provides a finite-size reference, increasing on-site repulsion U induces localization and reorganizes the low-energy spectrum. For the extended model, we examine moderate (U=4) and strong (U=10) coupling regimes, where conventional structure factors reveal familiar crossovers among charge, spin and local-pairing correlations. PCA of the corresponding correlation matrices captures these crossovers directly from the data, without assuming predefined order parameters by identifying charge-dominated, spin-dominated and pairing-dominated regimes through variance condensation into leading components. This establishes PCA as a transparent, model-agnostic framework for uncovering the hierarchy and competition of correlation channels in finite Hubbard lattice clusters, providing a bridge between exact diagonalization and modern machine-learning diagnostics in strongly correlated systems.

- **TL;DR**: 提出基于ResNet-18特征提取的深度学习框架MLRaman，结合XGBoost、SVM等分类器检测农药和染料的拉曼光谱，准确率达97.4%，并开发了实时预测的Streamlit应用。

The extensive use of pesticides and synthetic dyes poses critical threats to food safety, human health, and environmental sustainability, necessitating rapid and reliable detection methods. Raman spectroscopy offers molecularly specific fingerprints but suffers from spectral noise, fluorescence background, and band overlap, limiting its real-world applicability. Here, we propose a deep learning framework based on ResNet-18 feature extraction, combined with advanced classifiers, including XGBoost, SVM, and their hybrid integration, to detect pesticides and dyes from Raman spectroscopy, called MLRaman. The MLRaman with the CNN-XGBoost model achieved a predictive accuracy of 97.4% and a perfect AUC of 1.0, while it with the CNN-SVM model provided competitive results with robust class-wise discrimination. Dimensionality reduction analyses (PCA, t-SNE, UMAP) confirmed the separability of Raman embeddings across 10 analytes, including 7 pesticides and 3 dyes. Finally, we developed a user-friendly Streamlit application for real-time prediction, which successfully identified unseen Raman spectra from our independent experiments and also literature sources, underscoring strong generalization capacity. This study establishes a scalable, practical MLRaman model for multi-residue contaminant monitoring, with significant potential for deployment in food safety and environmental surveillance.

The excitability property of spiking neurons describes their capability to output an action potential as a real-time response to an input synaptic excitation current and is central to the event-based neuromorphic computing paradigm. The spiking mechanism is analysed in a representative ultra-low-power analog neuron from the circuit literature. Relying on conventional SPICE simulations compatible with industrial transistor compact models, we establish a excitation criterion, quantified either in terms of critical supplied charge or membrane potential threshold. Only the latter is found intrinsic to the neuron, i.e. independent of the input stimulus. Rigorous analysis of the nonlinear neuron dynamics provides insight but still needs to be explored further, as well as the effect of the intrinsic noise.

- **TL;DR**: 本文验证了有效温度概念在量子点固体中的适用性，通过结合直接和间接测量方法，证实场驱动电导率增加确实反映了电子温度的实际升高。

One of the characteristics of disordered semiconductors is the slow thermalization of charge carriers after excitation due to photoabsorption or high electric fields. An elegant way to capture the effects of the latter on the conductivity is through a field-dependent effective electronic temperature T_eff that can significantly exceed that of the lattice. Despite its elegance, its actual use has been limited, which, at least in part, can be attributed to the concept originating from computer simulations; experimental confirmations have largely been indirect (through scaling of conductivity) and did not establish that T_eff equals the real temperature of the electron distribution. Moreover, it has hardly been tested for important classes of disordered materials, including quantum dot solids. Here, we investigate whether the effective temperature concept is applicable to quantum dot solids, using zinc oxide as relevant model system. To verify that field-driven conductivity increases indeed reflect an actual increase of the electronic temperature, we combine direct and indirect measurements of T_eff: we convert conductivity changes at high fields to an effective temperature that we show to be consistent with a direct measurement of the electronic temperature using the Seebeck effect. These results not only confirm the relevance of the effective temperature concept to quantum dot solids but also confirm its general physical reality and open the way to systematic investigations into charge carrier (de)localization in disordered media.

- **TL;DR**: 这篇综述论文探讨了kagome晶格在量子材料中实现新电子态的关键作用，重点关注拓扑、阻挫和强关联这三个驱动因素在kagome结构中的协同作用。

Three important driving forces for creating qualitatively new phases in quantum materials are the topology of the materials' electronic band structures, frustration in the electrons' motion or magnetic interactions, and strong correlations between their charge, spin, and orbital degrees of freedom. In very few material systems do all of these aspects come together to contribute on an equal footing to stabilize new electronic states with unprecedented properties; however the search for such systems can be guided by models of configurational motifs or key sublattices that can host such physics. One of the most fascinating structural motifs for realizing this rich interplay of frustration, electronic topology, and electron correlation effects is the kagome lattice. In this review, we provide an overview of the theoretical underpinnings driving the physics of kagome lattices, and we then discuss experimental progress in realizing novel states enabled by kagome networks in crystalline materials. Different material classes are discussed with an emphasis on the phenomenologies of their electronic states and how they map to interactions arising from their kagome lattices.

### Breaking the Air-Water Paradigm: Ion Behavior at Hydrophobic Solid-Water Interfaces

- **TL;DR**: 本研究通过结合振动和频光谱与机器学习分子动力学模拟，挑战了传统认为疏水固体-水界面与空气-水界面行为相似的假设，揭示了石墨烯-NaCl溶液界面独特的离子吸附机制。

Hydrophobic solid-water interfaces underpin processes in nanofluidics, electrochemistry, and energy technologies. Microscopic insights into these systems are often inferred from our understanding of the air-water interface, which is assumed to exhibit similar behavior. Here, we challenge this paradigm by combining heterodyne-detected vibrational sum-frequency generation spectroscopy with machine-learning molecular dynamics simulations at first-principles accuracy to investigate the graphene-NaCl(aq) interface as a prototypical hydrophobic solid-water system. Spectroscopic results suggest that ions have a minimal effect on the structure of the interfacial water, while simulations reveal that Na$^{+}$ and Cl$^{-}$ accumulate densely at the surface. Together, these findings reveal a new adsorption mechanism that departs from the established air-water interface paradigm, where interfacial ion adsorption is typically associated with, and often detected through, pronounced alteration of the interfacial water alignment and orientation. This difference arises because ions cannot penetrate the solid boundary and reside at a similar depth as the interfacial water molecules. As a consequence, large ion populations can be accommodated within the extended two-dimensional hydrogen-bond network at the interface, causing only minor local distortions but significant changes to its longer-range connectivity. These results reveal a distinct mechanism of electrolyte organization at aqueous-carbon interfaces, relevant to energy applications, where performance is highly sensitive to the local organization of interfacial water.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究首次在碳纳米管/六方氮化硼一维莫尔超晶格中观察到1/4和1/2填充时的关联绝缘态，验证了Luttinger液体理论中Umklapp散射在特定填充下的关键作用。

Two-dimensional moiré superlattices have been extensively studied, and a variety of correlated phenomena have been observed. However, their lower-dimensional counterpart, one-dimensional (1D) moiré superlattices, remain largely unexplored. Electrons in 1D are generally described by Luttinger liquid theory, with universal scaling relations depending only on the Luttinger parameter g. In particular, at half-filling, Umklapp scattering plays a crucial role, as it can significantly change the conductance-temperature scaling relation and lead to Mott insulators. However, this prediction has never been observed since doping an empty band to half-filling was extremely difficult. Here, we show that the marriage of moiré superlattices and 1D electrons makes it possible to study the Luttinger liquid in an exceptionally wide filling region simply by electrical gating. We perform transport measurements on 1D moiré superlattices of carbon nanotubes on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) substrates, and observe correlated insulating states at 1/4 and 1/2 fillings of the superlattice mini-band, where Umklapp scattering becomes dominant. We also observe a T-linear conductance at these commensurate fillings over a range of temperatures. Strikingly, the T-linear conductance leads to a strongly suppressed Luttinger parameter, suggesting a state of extreme correlation.

- **TL;DR**: E3Relax是一个端到端的等变图神经网络，可直接将未松弛晶体映射到其松弛结构，统一处理原子位移和晶格变形，显著提高结构优化的效率和准确性。

Structure optimization, which yields the relaxed structure (minimum-energy state), is essential for reliable materials property calculations, yet traditional ab initio approaches such as density-functional theory (DFT) are computationally intensive. Machine learning (ML) has emerged to alleviate this bottleneck but suffers from two major limitations: (i) existing models operate mainly on atoms, leaving lattice vectors implicit despite their critical role in structural optimization; and (ii) they often rely on multi-stage, non-end-to-end workflows that are prone to error accumulation. Here, we present E3Relax, an end-to-end equivariant graph neural network that maps an unrelaxed crystal directly to its relaxed structure. E3Relax promotes both atoms and lattice vectors to graph nodes endowed with dual scalar-vector features, enabling unified and symmetry-preserving modeling of atomic displacements and lattice deformations. A layer-wise supervision strategy forces every network depth to make a physically meaningful refinement, mimicking the incremental convergence of DFT while preserving a fully end-to-end pipeline. We evaluate E3Relax on four benchmark datasets and demonstrate that it achieves remarkable accuracy and efficiency. Through DFT validations, we show that the structures predicted by E3Relax are energetically favorable, making them suitable as high-quality initial configurations to accelerate DFT calculations.

We reconsider real-space renormalization for the two-dimensional Ising model, following the path traced out by Wilson in Sect. VI of his 1975 Reviews of Modern Physics. In that reference, Wilson considerably extended the Kadanoff decimation procedure towards a possibly rigorous construction of a real-space scale-invariant hamiltonian. Wilson's construction has, to the best of our knowledge, never been fully understood and thus neither reproduced nor generalized. In the present work, we use Monte Carlo sampling in combination with thermodynamic integration in order to retrace Wilson's computation for a real-space renormalization with a number of terms in the hamiltonian. We elaborate on the connection of real-space renormalization with the fermion sign problem and discuss to which extent our Monte Carlo procedure actually implements Wilson's program from half a century ago.

Field-free deterministic switching of perpendicular ferromagnets is a central challenge for spintronics applications, typically requiring explicit symmetry breaking. Here we show that deterministic switching can instead be achieved through higher-order (in magnetization angles) spin-orbit torques, even in systems that preserve in-plane mirror symmetry. Using a vector spherical harmonics expansion, we demonstrate that higher-order torque terms naturally give rise to additional out-of-equator fixed points, enabling reliable magnetization reversal when their magnitude is comparable to conventional lowest-order torques. We illustrate this mechanism with first-principles calculations on the noncentrosymmetric Weyl ferromagnet PrAlGe, where the combination of Weyl-node band topology and strong spin-orbit coupling produces sizable higher-order torque components. Because the Fermi surface is small, the conventional lowest-order torques are relatively weak, allowing the higher-order harmonics to compete on equal footing and strongly reshape the magnetization dynamics. The resulting spin dynamics confirm deterministic switching without additional symmetry breaking. Our results establish higher-order spin-orbit torque as a key ingredient for understanding and controlling magnetization dynamics in topological and spintronic materials.

Multi-terminal Josephson junction with three or more superconductors is an attractive quantum system to emerge and tune exotic electronic states. In four terminal Josephson junctions, the Weyl physics, namely topologically protected zero energy state, emerges without assuming any exotic materials. In this study, we consider the four-terminal Josephson junction with the quantum point contact structures between the mesoscopic normal region and four superconducting terminals. The quantum point contacts can tune electrically the number of conduction channels. We theoretically investigate an effect of the increase of channels on the emergence of Weyl points. The increase of channels causes the increase of Andreev bound states in the system, which increase the emergence probability of Weyl points. When all terminals have two channels, the emergence probability is up to 17\%, which is about four times larger than that for all single channel junctions. We consider the balance of the number of conduction channels in the four terminals. When the number of channels is unbalanced, the increase of emergence probability is suppressed.

Electrolyte design plays an important role in the development of lithium-ion batteries and sodium-ion batteries. Battery electrolytes feature a large design space composed of different solvents, additives, and salts, which is difficult to explore experimentally. High-fidelity molecular simulation can accurately predict the bulk properties of electrolytes by employing accurate potential energy surfaces, thus guiding the molecule and formula engineering. At present, the overly simplified classic force fields rely heavily on experimental data for fine-tuning, thus its predictive power on microscopic level is under question. In contrast, the newly emerged machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) can accurately reproduce the ab initio data, demonstrating excellent fitting ability. However, it is still haunted by problems such as low transferrability, insufficient stability in the prediction of bulk properties, and poor training cost scaling. Therefore, it cannot yet be used as a robust and universal tool for the exploration of electrolyte design space. In this work, we introduce a highly scalable and fully bottom-up force field construction strategy called PhyNEO-Electrolyte. It adopts a hybrid physics-driven and data-driven method that relies only on monomer and dimer EDA (energy deomposition analysis) data. With a careful separation of long/short-range and non-bonding/bonding interactions, we rigorously restore the long-range asymptotic behavior, which is critical in the description of electrolyte systems. Through this approach, we significantly improve the data efficiency of MLIP training, allowing us to achieve much larger chemical space coverage using much less data while retaining reliable quantitative prediction power in bulk phase calculations. PhyNEO-electrolyte thus serves as an important tool for future electrolyte optimization.

- **TL;DR**: 使用强化学习优化双金属合金纳米颗粒的元素排序，通过几何图表示训练RL代理执行原子交换操作，发现已知基态结构，并能推广到未见尺寸的纳米颗粒。

We approach the search for optimal element ordering in bimetallic alloy nanoparticles (NPs) as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem, and have built an RL agent that learns to perform such global optimisation using the geometric graph representation of the NPs. To demonstrate the effectiveness, we train an RL agent to perform composition-conserving atomic swap actions on the icosahedral nanoparticle structure. Trained once on randomised $Ag_{X}Au_{309-X}$ compositions and orderings, the agent discovers previously established ground state structure. We show that this optimization is robust to differently ordered initialisations of the same NP compositions. We also demonstrate that a trained policy can extrapolate effectively to NPs of unseen size. However, the efficacy is limited when multiple alloying elements are involved. Our results demonstrate that RL with pre-trained equivariant graph encodings can navigate combinatorial ordering spaces at the nanoparticle scale, and offer a transferable optimisation strategy with the potential to generalise across composition and reduce repeated individual search cost.

- **TL;DR**: 本文通过实验测量液晶Freedericksz相变中的耗散，验证了Kibble-Zurek机制对耗散的标度律，并开发自动化优化方法将耗散减少三倍。

In a finite-time continuous phase transition, topological defects emerge as the system undergoes spontaneous symmetry breaking. The Kibble-Zurek mechanism predicts how the defect density scales with the quench rate. During such processes, dissipation also arises as the system fails to adiabatically follow the control protocol near the critical point. Quantifying and minimizing this dissipation is fundamentally relevant to nonequilibrium thermodynamics and practically important for energy-efficient computing and devices. However, there are no prior experimental measurements of dissipation, or the optimization of control protocols to reduce it in many-body systems. In addition, it is an open question to what extent dissipation is correlated with the formation of defects. Here, we directly measure the dissipation generated during the voltage-driven Freedericksz transition of a liquid crystal with a sensitivity equivalent to a ~10 nanokelvin temperature rise. We observe Kibble-Zurek scaling of dissipation and its breakdown, both in quantitative agreement with existing theoretical works. We further implement a fully automated in-situ optimization approach that discovers more optimal driving protocols, reducing dissipation by a factor of three relative to a simple linear protocol.

Interlayer sliding, together with twist angle, is a crucial parameter that defines the atomic registry and thus determines the properties of two-dimensional (2D) material homobilayers. Here, we theoretically demonstrate that controlled interlayer sliding in bilayer graphene induces Berry curvature reversals, leading to topological states confined within a one-dimensional moiré channel. We experimentally realize interlayer sliding by bending the bilayer graphene geometry across a nanoridge. Systematic electronic transport measurements reveal topological valley transport when the Fermi energy resides within the band gap, consistent with theoretical predictions of eight topological channels. Our findings establish interlayer sliding as a powerful tool for tuning the electronic properties of bilayer graphene and underscore its potential for broad application across 2D material systems.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了改进的DMRG-in-DFT嵌入方法，通过结合精确交换和多参考绝热连接方案来减少非加性交换相关误差，提高了强关联系统的计算精度。

The projection-based wave function (WF)-in-DFT embedding enables an efficient description of both the energetics and properties of large and complex chemical systems, with accuracy exceeding that of pure DFT. Recently, we have proposed using the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) as the WF method for molecules containing strongly correlated fragments [Beran, P. et al. J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2023, 14, 3, 716-722]. In this work, we demonstrate that the accuracy of the DMRG-in-DFT approach is primarily limited by the approximate treatment of the coupling between the active component and its environment through nonadditive exchange-correlation functionals. To address this issue, we combine exact exchange to reduce the nonadditive exchange error with a multireference adiabatic connection (AC) scheme to recover nonadditive correlation. The performance of the improved DMRG-in-DFT embedding is illustrated on two prototypical strongly correlated systems: the dissociation of the H20 chain and the cleavage of a triple CN bond in propionitrile.

### Giant number-parity effect and scalable spin squeezing in Luttinger liquids

- **TL;DR**: 该论文研究了奇数位点半整数自旋链在Luttinger液体相中的有限尺寸准自发对称性破缺现象，发现系统在对称性破坏场关闭后能保留亚扩展磁化，并产生可扩展的自旋压缩。

Finite-size quantum spin systems can be magnetized by the application of a symmetry-breaking field, but in general their symmetry is expected to be restored once the field is turned off adiabatically. Recently (F. Caleca et al., arXiv:2412.15493) we have shown that systems of half-integer spins with an odd number of sites and a parity-preserving Hamiltonian can retain a finite magnetization, hence exhibiting spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) at finite size. Here we generalize this phenomenon to spin chains whose low-energy physics (in zero field) realizes a Luttinger-liquid phase. We observe that odd-sized chains can exhibit a phenomenon of finite-size quasi-SSB, in which a net sub-extensive magnetization, $M \sim N^{1-1/(4K)}$ is retained, where $N$ is the number of sites and $K$ the Luttinger exponent. Interestingly, the states prepared by turning off the symmetry-breaking field quasi-adiabatically display scalable spin squeezing -- namely stronger the bigger the system -- regardless of the parity of $N$. The scaling of the squeezing parameter is dictated again by the Luttinger exponent, $ξ_R^2 \sim N^{-1+1/(2K)}$. This result shows that scalable quantum correlations with metrological significance, associated typically with high-dimensional systems, can be found as well in gapless one-dimensional ones; and they are a direct consequence of the critical nature of Luttinger liquids.

- **TL;DR**: 通过控制淬火温度，成功分离出三种不同钾缺陷程度的K1-xCrSe2相，并生长出单晶KCrSe2，揭示了其磁性的场依赖性和弱变磁转变。

Layered delafossite-type magnetic materials, such as KCrSe$_2$, are promising platforms for studying magnetic systems and potential frustration on triangular lattices. Synthesis, structure-type control, and off-stoichiometries remain major challenges in the investigation of these delafossite-type magnets. Starting from the same self-flux composition (K:Cr:Se = 8:1:8), we isolated three distinct K$_{1-x}$CrSe$_2$ phases with $x$ = 0, 0.13--0.17, and 0.32--0.35, each adopting a different structure type depending on the quenching temperature applied. The phase evolution indicates a sequence of transformations during synthesis between compounds with varying degrees of potassium deficiency. Building on these insights into phase stability and crystal growth, we successfully grew single crystals of full-stoichiometric KCrSe$_2$ -- enabling direction-dependent magnetization measurements. These measurements reveal a pronounced field dependence of the Néel temperature at low external fields, as well as a weak metamagnetic transition. Our findings demonstrate that even a simple parameter -- such as quenching temperature -- can be used to control stoichiometry, direct phase formation, and ultimately tune the magnetic properties of delafossite-type materials.

### Floquet Superheating

- **TL;DR**: 本文提出了一种Floquet超加热机制，其中快速加热从局部能量波动产生的"热点"处成核，导致长寿命预热化和非遍历双峰分布。

Periodically driven many-body systems generally heat towards a featureless 'infinite-temperature' state. As an alternative to uniform heating in a clean system, here we establish a Floquet superheating regime, where fast heating nucleates at ''hot spots" generated by rare fluctuations in the local energy with respect to an appropriate effective Hamiltonian. Striking macroscopic consequences include exceptionally long-lived prethermalization and non-ergodic bimodal distributions of macroscopic observables. Superheating is predicated on a heating rate depending strongly on the local fluctuation; in our example, this is supplied by a sharp state-selective spin-echo, where the energy absorption is strongly suppressed for low-energy states, while thermal fluctuations open up excessive heating channels. A simple phenomenological theory is developed to show the existence of a critical droplet size, which incorporates heating by the driving field as well as the heat current out of the droplet. Our results shine light on a new heating mechanism and suggest new routes towards stabilizing non-equilibrium phases of matter in driven systems.

The presence of interfaces in semiconductor devices substantially hinders thermal transport, contributing disproportionately to the overall thermal resistance. However, approaches to enhance interfacial thermal transport remain scarce without changing the interface structure, as the intrinsic electron and phonon properties of constituent materials set an upper limit. Here, we find a new thermal transport pathway, electronic heat tunneling, to enhance interfacial thermal conductance through metal-insulator-semiconductor junctions. By applying photoexcitation or bias voltage, we observe remarkable thermal conductance increases in operando, opening a new channel for efficient interfacial heat dissipation. The electron quantum tunneling pathway is parallel to conventional phonon-mediated interfacial thermal transport, and violates the Wiedemann-Franz law since this pathway deviates from the paradigm of diffusive transport. Moreover, we develop a tunneling mismatch model to describe the enhanced thermal conductance, originating from tunneling heat flux. Our Letter demonstrates a previously unexplored heat transport mechanism to enhance thermal conductance, bypassing the need for interface engineering. These findings emphasize the essential need to understand semiconductor thermal properties under realistic operating conditions.

A major challenge in nonadiabatic molecular dynamics is to automatically and objectively identify the key reaction coordinates that drive molecules toward distinct excited-state decay channels. Traditional manual analyses are inefficient and rely heavily on expert intuition, creating a bottleneck for interpreting complex photochemical processes. To overcome this, we introduce a fully automated machine-learning framework that directly extracts these coordinates from on-the-fly trajectory surface hopping data. By combining an Autoencoder for nonlinear dimensionality reduction with clustering and information entropy analysis, our method autonomously maps reaction channels and pinpoints their governing structural motions. When applied to keto isocytosine and the methaniminium cation, the framework objectively revealed invovled reaction channels and corresponding active coordinates with high efficiency and accuracy. This work establishes an effective paradigm for mechanistic insight in excited-state dynamics, transforming raw trajectory data into clear, interpretable reaction mechanisms.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种基于ZAPT2的开壳层冻结自然轨道方法，可有效缩减虚拟轨道空间大小，在保持精度的同时提高计算效率，特别适用于大基组下的开壳层体系计算。

We present an open-shell frozen natural orbital (FNO) approach, which utilizes the second-order Z-averaged perturbation theory (ZAPT2), to reduce the restricted opten-shell Hartree-Fock virtual space size with controllable accuracy. Our ZAPT2 frozen natural orbital (ZAPT-FNO) selection scheme significantly outperforms the canonical molecular orbital virtual space truncation scheme based on Hartree-Fock orbital energies, especially when using large multiple-polarized and augmented basis sets. We demonstrate that the ZAPT-FNO-selected virtual orbitals lead to a systematic convergence of the correlation energies, but more importantly to the singlet-triplet T$_1$-S$_ 0$ energy gaps with respect to the complete active space (CAS) [occupied + virtual] size. We confirm our findings by simulating T$_1$-S$_ 0$ gaps in H$_2$O$_2$ and O$_2$ molecules using the traditional complete active space configuration interaction (CASCI) approach, as well as in stretched CH$_2$, for which we also employed the iterative qubit coupled cluster (iQCC) method as a quantum eigensolver. Finally, we applied the iQCC method with ZAPT-FNO-selected active space to the phosphorescent Ir(ppy)$_3$ complex with 260 electrons, where extended basis sets are required to achieve chemical (ca. 1 m$E_h$) accuracy. In this case, CASCI results are not available; however, the iQCC-computed T$_1$-S$_ 0$ gaps show robust convergence with enlarging basis set and CAS size, approaching the experimental value. Thus, the ZAPT-FNO method is very promising for improving the accuracy of quantum chemical modelling in a resource-efficient manner, and opens the door to simulating open-shell states of large materials within realistic active space sizes and without compromising on basis-set quality.

We theoretically investigate the effects of time-dependent electromagnetic fields on frustrated magnets with the spatial inversion symmetry. Two types of external-field setups are considered: One is a circularly polarized electromagnetic field and the other is a combination of a circularly polarized electric field and a static magnetic field. The system is modeled by a classical frustrated Heisenberg model on a triangular lattice, whose ground state is a single-$Q$ spiral spin configuration. The effects of irradiated electric and magnetic fields are taken into account by the inverse Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction and the Zeeman coupling, respectively, without heating effects. By numerically solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, we find that the two field configurations lead to distinct skyrmion crystal (SkX) phases and their associated topological phase transitions: in the former setup, SkXs composed of skyrmions with skyrmion numbers of one and two with opposite signs emerge, whereas in the latter setup, SkXs with the same sign appear. The stabilization mechanisms of these SkXs are accounted for by the competition among electromagnetic-field-induced chiral DM interactions, electric-field-induced three-spin interactions, and the Zeeman coupling based on the high-frequency expansion within the Floquet formalism. Furthermore, for the latter setup, we find that the stability region of the SkX phase varies significantly depending on the timing of the application of the circularly polarized electric field and the static magnetic field. Our findings would broaden the possible routes to generate and control SkXs by time-dependent electromagnetic fields, advancing both the theoretical comprehension and experimental control of topological spin crystals.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种以化学系统为中心的晶体材料探索策略，结合生成模型和机器学习力场，通过生成-评估-微调的闭环循环实现数据高效的晶体材料发现。

The emergence of deep learning has brought the long-standing goal of comprehensively understanding and exploring crystalline materials closer to reality. Yet, universal exploration across all elements remains hindered by the combinatorial explosion of possible chemical environments, making it difficult to balance accuracy and efficiency. Crucially, within any finite set of elements, the diversity of short-range bonding types and local geometric motifs is inherently limited. Guided by this chemical intuition, we propose a chemical-system-centric strategy for crystalline materials exploration. In this framework, generative models are coupled with machine-learned force fields as fast energy evaluators, and both are iteratively refined in a closed-loop cycle of generation, evaluation, and fine-tuning. Using the Li-P-S ternary system as a case study, we show that this approach captures the diversity of local environments with minimal additional first-principles data while maintaining structural creativity, achieving closed-loop convergence toward chemical completeness within a bounded chemical space. We further demonstrate downstream applications, including phase-diagram construction, ionic-diffusivity screening, and electronic-structure prediction. Together, this strategy provides a systematic and data-efficient framework for modeling both atomistic and electronic structures within defined chemical spaces, bridging accuracy and efficiency, and paving the way toward scalable, AI-driven discovery of crystalline materials with human-level creativity and first-principles fidelity.

The results of numerical simulation using a modified Monte Carlo method with a thermostat algorithm for a pseudospin model of orthonickelates are presented. Temperature phase diagrams are constructed for various degrees of filling and for various parameters of the model, and the effect of local correlations on the critical temperatures of the model orthonickelate is investigated. The possibility of detecting phase inhomogeneous states is shown. The numerical simulation results show good qualitative agreement with the analytical results in the mean field approximation.

- **TL;DR**: 研究一维电子无序系统与光学腔强耦合下的量子逆问题，通过透射谱反演提取电子-光子耦合强度，在Aubry-André-Harper模型中表现出更高的精度。

We investigate quantum inverse problems in one-dimensional (1D) electronic disordered systems strongly coupled to optical cavities. More specifically, we consider the Anderson and the Aubry-Andre-Harper models connected to electronic reservoirs and embedded in a single-mode optical cavity. The light-matter interaction enables photon-assisted hopping processes that significantly modify the transmittance spectrum. Within the nonequilibrium Green's function formalism, we implement an inversion-based approach capable of accurately extracting the electron-photon coupling strength directly from transmittance spectra. While cavity coupling acts as a minor perturbation within the Anderson model, yielding broad yet precise parameter estimates, its influence is markedly different in the Aubry-André-Harper model. The latter exhibits a sharp metal-insulator transition in 1D, thus resulting in more pronounced cavity-induced spectral changes. This renders even more accurate inverse solutions, offering unparalleled precision in the characterization of low-dimensional disordered systems. Altogether, our results demonstrate that the quantum inverse problem provides a robust diagnostic tool for quantum materials, particularly effective for systems exhibiting metal-insulator transitions.

Mineral dust aerosols strongly influence Earth's climate by acting as ice-nucleating particles (INPs). Feldspar minerals, particularly K-feldspar, are recognized as dominant INPs, and a previous study attributed this behavior to (100) surfaces exposed at defects. Using machine-learning molecular dynamics simulations, we systematically investigate ice nucleation on all K-feldspar surfaces. We identify the (110) surface, exposed at defects such as steps, as the most active plane for ice formation. This surface uniquely structures interfacial water into an arrangement resembling that on the (110) surface of cubic ice, providing an optimal template for nucleation. Using advanced sampling, we directly observe the formation of clusters with cubic-ice structure and their orientation agrees with experiment. These results provide a microscopic explanation of how ice forms in our planet's atmosphere.

We present a hybrid lattice Hamiltonian truncation method that integrates the numerical renormalization group (NRG) with a truncated lattice integrable spectrum. The technique is tailored for generic deformations of integrable lattice models, where the NRG enables a controlled incorporation of high-energy states. The method extends the basis set more effectively and efficiently than brute-force truncation, meanwhile significantly reducing errors. We show its capability on two paradigmatic models: an Ising chain in a magnetic field and a quantum Ising ladder. The resulting dynamical structure factors accurately capture the essential low-energy physics, including the $E_8$ and $\mathcal{D}_8^{(1)}$ excitations of the former and later models, respectively, demonstrating the approach's computational efficiency and high performance.

High-entropy alloys (HEAs) exhibit exceptional properties arising from a combination of thermodynamic, kinetic and structural factors and have found applications in numerous fields such as aerospace, energy, chemical industries, hydrogen storage, and ocean engineering. However, a large compositional space remains to be explored. Unlike conventional approaches, computational methods have shown accelerated discovery of novel alloys in a short time. However, the lack of interatomic potentials have posed a challenge in discovering new alloy compositions and property measurements. In the present work, we have developed a Moment Tensor Potential (MTP) trained by Machine Learning based approach using the BFGS unconstrained optimization algorithm for the CoCrFeMnNi High-entropy alloy. Our training set consists of various defects induced configurations such as vacancies, dislocations and stacking-faults. An active learning scheme to re-train the potential was undertaken to dynamically to add training data upon encountering extrapolative configurations during non-equilibrium simulations. A thorough investigation of the error metrics, equation of state, uniaxial tensile deformation, nano-indentation and solid-liquid interface stability for this alloy was carried out, and it is seen that the MTP potential outperforms the popular Modified Embedded Atom Method (MEAM) potential on physical properties prediction. The accuracy and high computational speed are discussed using scaling performance. The potential is prepared for public use by embedding it into the Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator (LAMMPS) code.

We study the dynamics of inertial active particles in a one-dimensional chain with harmonic nearest-neighbor interactions, highlighting the interplay of persistence, interaction, and inertial timescales. Using a Green's function approach, we derive the mean-squared displacement (MSD) and mean-squared change in velocity (MSCV), revealing multiple crossovers between ballistic, diffusive, and subdiffusive regimes and providing analytic expressions for scaling coefficients and crossover times. Non-Gaussian deviations in active Brownian particles are captured through excess kurtosis, reflecting heavy-tailed, finite-support, or bimodal distributions that evolve systematically over time. Time-dependent probability distributions exhibit distinct data collapses within different temporal regimes, confirming the robustness of the scaling behavior. Overall, this framework connects multiparticle interactions to microscopic dynamics, revealing experimentally accessible signatures of inertia in active matter.

Gas phase ultrafast electron diffraction (GUED) has become a powerful technique to directly observe the structural dynamics of photoexcited molecules. GUED reveals information about the nuclear motions that is complementary to the information on the electronic states provided by spectroscopic measurements. GUED experiments so far have utilized a single laser pulse to excite the molecules and an electron pulse to probe the dynamics. This limits the excited states which can be studied to only those that can be reached by absorption of a photon from the ground state or in some cases simultaneous absorption of multiple photons. A broader class of experiments and dynamics can be accessed using two time-delayed laser pulses to access unexplored regions of the potential energy surfaces. As a proof-of-principle experiment using a double excitation, we studied the photodissociation of trifluoroiodomethane molecules that are pre-excited with an infrared (800 nm) femtosecond laser pulse before photo-dissociation is triggered with an ultraviolet (266 nm) femtosecond laser pulse. We have observed significant differences in the dissociation dynamics, with pre-excitation resulting in a slower dissociation process. This new capability can offer new insights on the evolution of nuclear wavepackets in regions of the excited potential energy surface which are inaccessible in single photon excitation. We present a methodology to carry out the measurement, analyze and interpret the data that could be applied to a broad class of experiments.

Recent theoretical and experimental advances have identified cobaltates with a high-spin $d^7$ electronic configuration as promising hosts for spin-orbit entangled $J_{eff} = 1/2$ magnetism that can support bond-dependent exchange interactions. In two-dimensional triangular lattices, the coexistence of such exchange frustration along with geometric frustration gives rise to a rich landscape of competing magnetic phases, establishing monolayer triangular $d^7$ cobaltates as a compelling platform for frustrated magnetism. Here we investigate a representative triangular-lattice monolayer cobaltate CoBr$_2$, where first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal a dominant nearest-neighbor $t_{2g}$-$e_g$ hopping channel that enhances the ferromagnetic Kitaev-type exchange interactions. In contrast, the nearest-neighbor Heisenberg term is highly sensitive to a direct $t_{2g}$-$t_{2g}$ hopping path and electronic correlations. The magnetic exchange parameters are evaluated using the hopping amplitudes obtained from DFT calculations within an exact diagonalization framework. We construct the first and third nearest neighbor Heisenberg exchange dependent $J_1$-$J_3$ magnetic phase diagram in the physically relevant regime and identify multiple competing ground states, including ferromagnetic, stripy, spiral, and $120^{\circ}$ antiferromagnetic orders. The Luttinger-Tisza analysis further predicts a Z$_2$ vortex crystal phase, while exact diagonalization reveals a bond-nematic phase stabilized by the longer-range couplings. Going beyond the conventional bond-independent XXZ picture typically applied to Co$^{2+}$ systems, our results on monolayer CoBr$_2$ establish d$^7$ cobalt dihalides as a promising platform to explore the interplay of long-range Heisenberg and bond-dependent exchange interactions that can stabilize diverse magnetic ground states on a triangular lattice.

The interplay between lattice distortions and charge carriers governs the properties of many functional oxides. In alkali-doped LiMgPO4, a significant enhancement in dosimetric response is observed, but its microscopic origin is not understood. Using non-adiabatic molecular dynamics, we reveal a fundamental mechanism of carrier decoupling driven by a hierarchy of lattice distortions. We show that electrons localize into stable small polarons on an ultrafast timescale, trapped by the strong local potential induced by the dopant, while holes form more delocalized polarons that migrate efficiently through a lattice smoothed by global strain. The stark contrast between the dynamics of trapped electrons and mobile holes explains the suppressed recombination and enhanced energy storage. These results present a clear physical picture of how multiscale lattice distortions can independently control electron and hole transport, offering new insights into the physics of polarons in complex materials.

Transport properties of the single- and two-site mesoscoipc quantum Hall (QH) circuits at high transparencies can be described in terms of the lowest-order backscattering perturbations, and mapping to the boundary sine-Gordon model can be exploited in full generality. While the higher-order backscattering processes are exactly marginal in the case of corresponding three-site circuits, they become crucial in a device with four or more sites. Here, we explore the transport properties of a multi-site QH circuit with special focus on that with four sites, and report their unique quantum critical behaviors that can be accessed via transport measurements. Tunneling phenomena in multichannel QH circuits based on multi-site geometry are also investigated, and a promising route to realizing different aspects of quantum critical phenomena is offered

- **TL;DR**: 首次在低温等离子体中检测并量化了HNC和HCN异构体，发现[HNC]/[HCN]丰度比约为10^-4，远低于星际介质中的比值，揭示了等离子体环境中不同的动力学机制。

Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) is a well-known product in combustion, astrophysical, and plasma environments, but its isomer, hydrogen isocyanide (HNC), remains unexplored in molecular plasmas. Here, we report on the detection and quantification of both HNC and HCN isomers in low-temperature plasmas generated from N$_2$/H$_2$/CH$_4$ mixtures using quantum cascade laser and frequency comb absorption spectroscopy. The identification of HNC is confirmed by comparison with molecular spectroscopic databases. The observed [HNC]/[HCN] abundance ratio of $\sim 10^{-4}$ is far lower than reported values in interstellar media, where ratios can reach unity. We attribute this stark difference to fundamentally different kinetics, dominated by an interplay between formation of vibrationally 'hot' intermediates (HCN* and HNC*) and their subsequent stabilization and destruction. This mechanism contrasts with cold interstellar environments, where dissociative recombination reactions dominate and the formed HNC persists and accumulates over astrochemical timescales. Our results highlight the overlooked role of HNC in plasma chemistry containing carbon, nitrogen and hydrogen, with implications for plasma-assisted HCN synthesis and nitrogen-carbon plasma processes in surface modification and material treatments.

The Hubbard model has attracted considerable interest due to its prototypical role in describing strongly interacting electronic systems, such as high-critical-temperature superconductors as well as many novel quantum materials. By introducing next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) hoppings to the Hubbard model, the phase diagram becomes richer, and fascinating phenomena arise in both, one-dimensional chains and square lattices, such as: antiferromagnetism (AFM), ferromagnetism (FM), superconductivity (SC), as well as charge orders, among others. Moreover, NNN hoppings play a fundamental role in understanding effects of doping on magnetism and pairing orders in strongly interacting regimes. In this article, we review the recent progress in understanding the different competing phases of this model in one and two dimensions from a computational perspective. We comment on the pressing technical challenges, illustrate the controversial results concerning the emergence of the SC phase, and conclude with our perspectives on future explorations.

- **TL;DR**: 本研究通过第一性原理计算和CINEB方法，首次系统地研究了O₂和H₂O分子在二维aza-triphenylene单层表面的吸附和解离行为，发现该材料对氧气和水暴露具有良好稳定性。

Environmental oxidation has a great impact in tuning the physical, chemical and electronic properties of two-dimensional (2D) monolayers which can affect their practical applications in nanoscale engineering devices under ambient conditions. aza-triphenylene is a recently synthesized 2D materials whose practcal applications have not been systematically studied yet. In this study, we report for the first time, the adsorption and dissociation of O$_2$ and H$_2$O molecules on the surface of 2D aza-triphenylene monolayer through first principles calculations in combination with climbing image nudged elastic band (CINEB) method. The results indicates that both the O$_2$ and H$_2$O molecules weakly interact over the monolayer surface with an adsorption energy -0.16 eV and -0.37 eV respectively. In contrast, both the molecules exhibit resistance for dissociation due to the formation of energy barriers. The transition path indicates that molecular oxygen experience two energy barriers (0.16 ev and 1.22 eV) before getting dissociated atomic oxygen. However, the dissociation of H$_2$O requires larger energy barrier (2.3 eV and 0.86 eV) due to breaking of covalent bonds and transfer of hydrogen. The strong chemical adsorption of atomic oxygen and H$^+$/OH$^-$ ions is due to the significant charge transfer from monolayer to the adsorbate as evidenced from the charge density difference and Bader charge analysis. Moreover, the dissociated configuration exhibit a larger band gap as compared to the pristine aza-triphenylene due to the strong hybridization between the p states of carbon and oxygen. our work predicts the robustness of azatriphylene monolayer against oxygen/water exposer thus ensuring their stability for device applications using these materials.

Zigzag edges of graphene have long been predicted to exhibit magnetic electronic state near the Fermi level, which can cause spin-related phenomena and offer unique potentials for graphene-based spintronics. However, the magnetic conduction channels along these edges have yet been reported experimentally. Here, we report the observation on signatures of magnetism in zigzag graphene nanoribbons (zGNRs) embedded in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN). The in-plane bonding with BN can stabilize the edges of zGNRs, and thus enable a direct probing of the intrinsic magnetism. Firstly, the presence of magnetism of a zGNR was confirmed by scanning NV center microscopy. And then, zGNR was fabricated into a transistor with a width of ~9 nm wide and a channel length of sub-50 nm. By performing magneto-transport measurements, Fabry-Pérot interference patterns were observed in the transistor at 4 Kelvin, which indicates a coherent transport through the channel. A large magnetoresistance of ~175 Ω, corresponding to a ratio of ~1.3 %, was observed at the same temperature. More importantly, such magneto-transport signal is highly anisotropic on the magnetic field direction, and its appearance extends well above room temperature. All these evidences corroborate the existence of robust magnetic ordering in the edge state of zGNR. The findings on zGNR embedded in h-BN provide an effective platform for the future exploration of graphene-based spintronic devices.

### Electron Correlation by Exchange Mapping in Electronic Structure Calculations

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种提高分子构型相互作用(CI)计算精度的方法，通过将能量缺陷与未生成构型的电子对起源关联，并将其映射到相应分子轨道对的交换相互作用上。

A method for increasing the accuracy of configuration interaction (CI) calculations of molecules and other electronic systems is proposed. The energy defect of a given calculation is associated with the electron pair origin of configurations not yet generated and this defect is mapped onto the exchange interaction for the corresponding pair of spatial molecular orbitals. The orbitals can be of opposite spin and thus the contribution includes the self-energy and differs from fermion exchange due to antisymmetry. A single parameter multiplying the exchange integral, is determined from the exact thermodynamic energy of a few reference molecules. The value of the parameter depends on the basis and level of configuration interaction but is the same for all molecules. Calculated energies are compared with experimental thermodynamic data for a set of forty mainly organic molecules representing a wide range of bonding environments. Results are reported for two types of multi- reference CI calculations: 1) a triple-zeta basis plus d-type functions for C, N, O and F and an s, p basis for H, and 2) a severely truncated virtual space in which higher spherical harmonic basis functions are removed. The error of the initial CI calculations is large, however, including the exchange-based contribution brings calculated CI energies into much closer agreement with exact values.

We derive the condition for the occurrence of the quantum Hall effect in two-dimensional lattice systems, expressed as $φν-ρ\in\mathbb{Z}$, where $φ$, $ν$, and $ρ$ denote the magnetic flux, the Chern number, and the electron density, respectively. By employing spiral boundary conditions, which treat the system as an extended one-dimensional chain, this condition is obtained directly through a Lieb-Schultz-Mattis-type and Laughlin-type argument. This approach improves upon the preceding work based on conventional periodic boundary conditions, where the condition was derived indirectly containing redundant system-size dependence. The key to this approach is that the spatial directions of the external force and the response can be manipulated by a factor of the system size.

### Lattice Thermal Transport Beyond the Quasiparticle Approximation: Nontrivial Spectral Competition between Three- and Four-Phonon Interactions

The breakdown of the quasiparticle approximation (QPA) for phonons in strongly anharmonic materials necessitates advanced first-principles frameworks for accurate lattice dynamics and thermal transport predictions. We develop a comprehensive beyond-quasiparticle approximation (BQPA) approach incorporating both three- (3ph) and four-phonon (4ph) interactions and apply it to investigate lattice thermal conductivity ($κ_{\rm L}$) in MgO, PbTe, and AgCl -- materials that span a broad spectrum of anharmonicity, from weak to severe anharmonic regimes with overdamped phonons. We reveal that while BQPA consistently increases $κ_{\rm L}$ relative to QPA due to phonon softening when considering only 3ph interactions, the inclusion of additional 4ph interactions hardens the phonon spectrum and suppresses this enhancement, bringing BQPA and QPA predictions into close agreement via subtle spectral competition effects across all three compounds. These findings highlight that accurate modeling of $κ_{\rm L}$ in strongly anharmonic materials requires treating both full phonon spectral function and higher-order anharmonicity on equal footing. Our work establishes a systematic framework for modeling thermal transport in systems with overdamped phonons and provides critical insights for materials design beyond the limits of conventional phonon transport theory.

We investigate exciton confinement to a quantum wire in monolayer $\text{MoSe}_2$ where the confinement is achieved by a p-i-n junction. We employ an effective-mass exciton model and solve the problem numerically, reflecting device geometries found in experimental state-of-the-art set up. Our method allows us to investigate the entire spectrum of confined states. We show the emergence of quantum confinement and study the dependence of the confined states as a function of electrical gate voltages, which are experimentally tunable parameters. We find that the confined states can be divided into bright and dark states with the dark states having small but finite oscillator strengths. Their oscillator strengths are low enough that they have not yet been detected in experiments, whereas the spectrum of the bright exciton states reproduces recent experimental measurements. Our results provide insight into the theoretical background of confined exciton states beyond the ground state and pave the way for the development of new confinement schemes as well as avenues to access the previously not detected dark states.

We investigate the behavior of the Schmidt gap, the von Neumann entanglement entropy, and the non-stabiliserness in proximity to the classical phase transition of the one-dimensional long-range transverse-field Ising model (LRTFIM). Leveraging the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) within a tensor-network formulation, we simulate thermal states through their purified tensor-network representations. Our results show that these observables, typically regarded as hallmarks of quantum criticality, exhibit pronounced and coherent signatures even at a classical thermal transition, highlighting the emergence of quantum complexity as the system nears thermal criticality.

ZBLAN glass is highly sensitive to thermal and mechanical stimuli, yet the associated surface chemical changes remain poorly understood. X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on multiple ZBLAN samples representing distinct structural states: fully amorphous, incipiently crystalline, and highly crystalline, produced through thermal treatments at 250C and 350C and vibration-assisted processing at 400C under low (L2) and high (H5) vibration levels. High-resolution F 1s, Zr 3d, Hf 4f, Ba 3d, La 3d, and Na 1s spectra show progressive peak sharpening and intensity enhancement with increasing temperature and vibration, indicating reduced surface disorder and greater local structural ordering. The most pronounced changes occur under high vibration at 400C. No binding-energy shifts were detected, confirming that all elements retain their expected oxidation states and that the observed evolution reflects structural rather than chemical changes. These results provide direct evidence that thermomechanical input enhances surface ordering in ZBLAN and clarify its role in crystallization behavior relevant to infrared optical applications.

Coexistence of nontrivial topology and flat electronic bands in low-energy lattices provides a fertile platform for correlated quantum states. The square-octagon lattice hosts Dirac nodes and flat bands at half-filling, yet the influence of intrinsic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and staggered magnetic flux on its topological and flat-band properties remains largely unexplored. Here, we examine this lattice using tight-binding models that include SOC and magnetic flux, uncovering a quantum spin Hall phase with spin Chern number $C_s=1$, crossovers to quantum anomalous Hall phases with $C=1$ and $C=2$, and higher-order topological insulator phases carrying quantized quadrupolar corner charges. The initially dispersionless flat bands evolve into quasi-flat, topologically nontrivial bands with uniform quantum geometry and large flatness ratios, conducive to fractional Chern insulator states. We further identify realistic material candidates, including octagraphene, transition-metal dichalcogenides, synthetic $\mathrm{MoSi_2N_4}$, and magnetic $α$-MnO$_2$, as potential candidates for realizing tunable topological phases intertwined with flat-band physics, opening new opportunities for correlated topological matter.

Lead (Pb) is a typical low-melting-point ductile metal and serves as an important model material in the study of dynamic responses. Under shock-wave loading, its dynamic mechanical behavior comprises two key phenomena: plastic deformation and shock induced phase transitions. The underlying mechanisms of these processes are still poorly understood. Revealing these mechanisms remains challenging for experimental approaches. Non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations are an alternative theoretical tool for studying dynamic responses, as they capture atomic-scale mechanisms such as defect evolution and deformation pathways. However, due to the limited accuracy of empirical interatomic potentials, the reliability of previous NEMD studies is questioned. Using our newly developed machine learning potential for Pb-Sn alloys, we revisited the microstructure evolution in response to shock loading under various shock orientations. The results reveal that shock loading along the [001] orientation of Pb exhibits a fast, reversible, and massive phase transition and stacking fault evolution. The behavior of Pb differs from previous studies by the absence of twinning during plastic deformation. Loading along the [011] orientation leads to slow, irreversible plastic deformation, and a localized FCC-BCC phase transition in the Pitsch orientation relationship. This study provides crucial theoretical insights into the dynamic mechanical response of Pb, offering a theoretical input for understanding the microstructure-performance relationship under extreme conditions.

Magnetic imaging techniques are widespread critical tools used in fields such as magnetism, spintronics or even superconductivity. Among them, one of the most versatile methods is the magneto-optical Kerr effect. However, as soon as light is blocked from interacting with the magnetic layer, such as in deeply buried layers, optical techniques become ineffective. In this work, we present a spin-accumulation based magneto-optical Kerr effect (SA-MOKE) microscopy technique that enables imaging of a magnetic thin-films covered by thick and opaque metallic layers. The technique is based on the generation and detection of transient spin-accumulations that propagate through the thick metallic layer. These spin-accumulation signals are directly triggered and detected optically on the same side, lifting any substrate transparency requirements. The spin-accumulation signals detected on a Cu layer decay with a characteristic length of 60 nm, much longer than the 12 nm optical penetration depth, allowing for detection of magnetic contrast with Cu capping layers up to hundreds of nm. This method should enable magnetic imaging in a wide-range of experiments where the surface of interest is covered by electrodes.

Lattice thermal conductivity ($κ_L$) is a key physical property governing heat transport in solids, with direct relevance to thermoelectrics, thermal barrier coatings, and heat management applications. However, while experimental determination of $κ_L$ is challenging, its theoretical calculation via ab initio methods particularly using density functional theory (DFT) is computationally intensive, often more demanding than electronic transport calculations by an order of magnitude. In this work, we present a machine learning (ML) approach to predict $κ_L$ with DFT-level accuracy over a wide temperature range (100-1000 K). Among various models trained on DFT-calculated data \textcolor{black}{obtained} from literature, the Extra Trees Regressor (ETR) yielded the best performance on log-scaled $κ_L$, achieving an average $R^2$ of 0.9994 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.0466 $W\,m^{-1}\,K^{-1}$. The ETR model also generalized well to twelve previously unseen (randomly chosen) low and high $κ_L$ compounds with diverse space group symmetries, reaching an $R^2$ of 0.961 against DFT benchmarks. Notably, the model excels in predicting $κ_L$ for both low- and high-symmetry compounds, enabling efficient high-throughput screening. We also demonstrate this capability by screening ultralow and ultrahigh $κ_L$ candidates among 960 half-Heusler \textcolor{black}{compounds} and 60,000 ICSD compounds from the AFLOW database. This result shows reliability of model developed for screening of potential thermoelectric materials. At the end, we have tested model's prediction ability on systems that have experimental $κ_L$ available that shows model's ability to search material that has desirable experimental $κ_L$ for thermoelectric applications.

Modeling microstructural evolution at large strains requires mechanical formulations that remain thermodynamically consistent while capturing significant lattice rotations and transformation-induced stresses. However, most existing finite-strain microelasticity and phase-field approaches apply macroscopic boundary conditions heuristically, preventing proper stress relaxation and violating the Hill-Mandel work equivalence required for homogenization. These limitations can misrepresent stress states and transformation pathways under finite strains. Here a variationally consistent finite-strain microelasticity framework is presented that couples microscopic and macroscopic mechanical equilibrium through a single energy functional. The resulting Euler-Lagrange conditions, periodic micro-equilibrium and macroscopic stress balance, are solved using a staggered FFT-Newton algorithm that combines a spectral fixed-point update for local fields with a Newton step for the homogenized deformation gradient. The formulation accommodates general hyperelastic constitutive laws and arbitrary transformation gradients. Benchmarks demonstrate accurate recovery of small-strain Eshelby solutions and systematic nonlinear deviations at large dilatations. Applied to deformation twinning in magnesium, the framework reproduces lenticular morphology, stress redistribution, and faster lateral growth consistent with experiments. This approach establishes a rigorous and scalable foundation for finite-strain phase-field simulations of coherent transformations under general stress or mixed boundary conditions.

We introduce a three-stroke quantum isochoric cycle that functions as a heat engine operating between two thermal reservoirs. Implemented for a particle confined in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, the cycle's performance is benchmarked against the classical three-stroke triangular and isochoric engines. We find that the quantum isochoric cycle achieves a higher efficiency than both classical counterparts and also surpasses the efficiency of the recently proposed three-stroke quantum isoenergetic cycle. Owing to its reduced number of strokes, the design substantially lowers control complexity in nanoscale thermodynamic devices, offering a more feasible route to experimental realization compared to conventional four-stroke architectures. We further evaluate the cycle in graphene-based systems under an external magnetic field, including monolayer graphene (MLG), AB-stacked bilayer graphene (BLG), and twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) at both magic and non-magic twist angles. Among these platforms, magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) attains the highest efficiency at fixed work output, highlighting its promise for quantum thermodynamic applications.

Ferroelastic twin walls in centrosymmetric perovskites can host emergent polar and magnetic properties forbidden in the bulk. We use density functional theory calculations to study the geometry and magnetic properties of ferroelastic domain walls in orthorhombic CaMnO$_3$, which belongs to the most common perovskite space group, $Pnma$. At the wall, the inherent inversion symmetry-breaking induces local polar distortions dependent on the wall geometry, which couple to the magnetic order through the octahedral distortions. Noncollinear calculations reveal enhanced out-of-plane magnetic moments on the Mn atoms and a local, finite magnetization confined to the wall. Strain fields across twin walls thus give rise to coexistence of polarization and magnetization as well as magnetoelectric response that is absent and symmetry-forbidden in bulk CaMnO$_3$. We propose that magnetoelectric coupling and coexisting polarization and magnetization can emerge at twin walls in bulk centrosymmetric antiferromagnets.

Light element based two dimensional (2D) materials are promising photocatalysts for hydrogen production via water splitting. Boron oxide (BO) is a recently synthesized 2D monolayer which has yet to be thoroughly explored for its potential applications. In this article, using first principles calculations, we report, for the first time, the visible-light photocatalytic activity of a BO monolayer for water splitting under mechanical strain and surface modification with single- and double-atom decorations (C, N, Si, Ge, P, As). The pristine BO monolayer exhibits an indirect band gap of 3.8 eV with band edges spanning the water redox potentials, but its optical absorption lies in the UV region (~ 4.5 eV). Strain engineering tunes the band gap and band alignment with a minimal shifting in the optical absorption (~0.5 eV). Single atom decoration produces a metallic state for elements like N, P, As, and an insulating state for single C, Si, Ge with a partial shifting in optical absorption. In contrast, double atom decoration produces substantial band gap reduction, improved band alignment, a pronounced red-shift in optical absorption into the visible range (1.6 to 3.2 eV) thus satisfying the criteria for water splitting. The stability of all the adsorbed configurations was confirmed by negative formation energy and ab-initio molecular dynamics simulations. These findings suggest BO monolayer functionalization can improve photocatalytic efficiency, providing hydrogen generation insights.
