- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种统一标准方法来分析验证各向同性不可压缩超弹性材料模型的稳定性，基于Hill条件检验材料模量的正定性，并可视化不稳定区域。

In this paper, we describe a uniform and standardized approach for analytically verifying the stability of isotropic, incompressible hyperelastic material models. Here, we address stability as fulfillment of the Hill's condition - i.e. the positive definiteness of the material modulus in the Kirchhoff stress - log-strain relation. For incompressible material behavior, all mathematically and mechanically possible deformations lie within a range bounded, on the one hand, by uniaxial states and, on the other hand, by biaxial states; shear {deformation} states lie in between. This becomes particularly clear when the possible states are represented in the invariant plane. This very representation is now also used to visualize the regions of unstable material behavior depending on the selected strain energy function and the respective data set of material parameters. This demonstrates how, for some constellations of energy functions, with appropriate selection or calibration of parameters, stable and unstable regions can be observed. If such cases occur, it is no longer legitimate to use them to initiate, for example, finite element simulations. This is particularly striking when, for example, a fit appears stable in uniaxial tension, but the same parameter set for shear states results in unstable behavior without this being specifically investigated. The presented approach can reveal simple indicators for this.

- **TL;DR**: 本文证明孪晶边界可以在原本禁止非相对论性自旋分裂的磁性材料中诱导产生类似d波交变磁体的自旋分裂，为自旋电子器件提供了新的实现途径。

Nonrelativistic spin splitting (NRSS) in compensated magnetic materials is drawing considerable attention due to its potential impact in next-generation spintronic devices. While NRSS is typically restricted to materials with particular symmetry constraints, here we demonstrate, using density functional theory (DFT) and tight-binding transport calculations, that twin boundaries can induce NRSS in magnetic systems where it is otherwise forbidden. We focus on two representative material systems: the tetragonal perovskite oxide BiCoO$_3$ with $90^{\circ}$ ferroelastic domain walls, and the rhombohedral layered delafossite-type oxide CoO$_2$, supporting $71^{\circ}$, $109^{\circ}$, and $135^{\circ}$ twin boundaries. Our results reveal that, if these boundaries coexist with ferromagnetic domain walls, they consistently produce NRSS similar to that of d-wave altermagnets, with nodal surfaces dictated by the underlying symmetry of the supercell containing the twin boundary. Tight-binding models further elucidate how the NRSS and derived transport properties scale with domain size and density. Our results put forward twin boundary engineering as a versatile route to realize and control spin splitting in a broader class of materials.

- **TL;DR**: ChargeDIFF是首个在无机材料生成过程中显式结合电子结构的生成模型，通过引入电荷密度作为额外模态，显著提升了材料生成性能，并实现了基于三维电荷密度的新型逆向设计方法。

Recent advances in generative models have introduced a new paradigm for the inverse design of inorganic materials, enabling the discovery of new crystalline structures with desired properties. However, existing generative models focus solely on structural aspects of materials during generation, while overlooking the underlying electronic behavior that fundamentally governs materials' stability and functionality. In this work, we present ChargeDIFF, the first generative model for inorganic materials that explicitly incorporates electronic structure into the generation process. Specifically, ChargeDIFF leverages charge density, a direct spatial representation of a material's electronic structure, as an additional modality for generation. ChargeDIFF demonstrates exceptional performance in both unconditional and conditional generation tasks compared to baseline models, with ablation studies revealing that this improvement is directly due to its ability to capture the material's electronic structure during generation. Moreover, the ability to control charge density during generation allows ChargeDIFF to introduce a novel inverse design method based on three-dimensional charge density, illustrating the potential to generate lithium-ion battery cathode materials with desired ion migration pathways, as validated by physics-based simulations. By highlighting the importance of accounting for electronic characteristics during material generation, ChargeDIFF offers new possibilities in the generative design of stable and functional materials.

- **TL;DR**: 研究了在不同斜切角度的蓝宝石衬底上生长的氮化铌薄膜的结构和电子特性，发现随着衬底斜切角度的增加，薄膜的结构质量改善，超导转变温度略有提高。

We report the structural and electronic properties of niobium nitride (NbN) thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy on c-plane sapphire with miscut angles of $0.5^\text{o}$, $2^\text{o}$, $4^\text{o}$, and $10^\text{o}$ towards m-axis. X-ray diffraction (XRD) scans reveal that the full width at half maximum of the rocking curves around the 1 1 1 reflection of these NbN films decreases with increasing miscut. Starting from 76 arcsecs on $0.5^\text{o}$ miscut, the FWHM reduces to almost 20 arcsecs on $10^\text{o}$ miscut sapphire indicating improved structural quality. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images indicate that NbN on c-sapphire has around 10 nm critical thickness, irrespective of the substrate miscut, above which it turns columnar. The improved structural property is correlated with a marginal increment in superconducting transition temperature $T_\text{c}$ from 12.1 K for NbN on $0.5^\text{o}$ miscut sapphire to 12.5 K for NbN on $10^\text{o}$ miscut sapphire.

- **TL;DR**: 本文提出并实验证明了电流切换自旋手性的概念，在Co1/3TaS2/Pt异质结构中实现了非易失可逆的手性切换，发现了内在自转矩诱导的手性切换机制。

Magnetic topology is central to modern quantum magnet, where spin chirality governs exotic spin winding, real-space Berry phase, and topological Hall effect. A key unresolved challenge is how to electrically switch topological spin chirality and its associated gauge flux, an essential requirement for manipulating its topological quantum properties. In this work, we propose and experimentally demonstrate the concept of current-switching spin chirality. We identify the new vdW antiferromagnet Co1/3TaS2 as an ideal platform, hosting a topological 3Q state with a minimum chirality cell, an ultrahigh skyrmion density, a non-centrosymmetric geometry, and a strong Berry curvature. Using a Co1/3TaS2/Pt heterostructure, we achieve the nonvolatile and reversible switching by current via current-driven spin-orbit torque based on Pts spin Hall effect. Beyond this conventional route, we further discover intrinsic self-torque-induced chirality switching within Co1/3TaS2, driven purely by current, without a magnetic field, and with high energy efficiency. These complementary pathways establish a unified framework for electrically creating and controlling spin chirality. Our results demonstrate a practical route toward chiral spintronics. They can be naturally generalised to other skyrmion systems, offering new opportunities in symmetry control, topological manipulation, and spin-chirality-based quantum functionalities.

- **TL;DR**: 提出一种基于驱动的非侵入式方法，用于提取超导结的完整电流-相位关系谐波内容，通过拟合驱动功率相关的临界电流来获取全谐波信息。

Extracting the current-phase relationship (CPR) of a single superconducting junction is challenging in practice and traditionally involves embedding the junction in a larger superconducting circuit containing SQUIDs and/or resonators. Applying ac driving to the junction has proven to be a viable and less invasive way to extract information about the few lowest harmonics of the CPR, by locating the integer and fractional Shapiro steps in the IV-curve of the driven junction. Here, we present an alternative driving-based method that allows to extract the full harmonic content of a CPR in a non-invasive way, by fitting the measured critical currents of the driven junction as a function of driving power. We test our method, both using numerical simulations and in experiments, and we show that it works very accurately, also in the presence of noise.

- **TL;DR**: 本文研究了在均匀扭转介质中的单个电子系统，该系统在垂直磁场和阿哈罗诺夫-玻姆通量作用下表现出可编程的光学特性和几何控制效应。

We study a single electron confined in a uniform-torsion medium, a continuum model of a screw dislocation density, in a perpendicular magnetic field, and in the presence of an Aharonov--Bohm flux. Torsion alone produces radial confinement without any \textit{ad hoc} potential, while the Aharonov--Bohm phase breaks the usual $m\leftrightarrow -m$ symmetry. From the exact spectrum and wave functions, we find: (i) a torsion-controlled optical transition whose energy blue-shifts from $\sim 6.8$ to $\sim 15.5$~meV and whose saturation intensity varies by an order of magnitude, enabling geometry-programmable optical switching; (ii) an Aharonov--Bohm-tunable ``angular pseudospin'' formed by the $m=\pm1$ states, with flux-controlled level splitting and asymmetric oscillator strengths that allow selective optical addressability; and (iii) an approximately linear torsion dependence of the transition energy that enables nanoscale torsion metrology with an estimated resolution of $\sim 10^{5}~\mathrm{m}^{-1}$. In this context, ``torsion'' refers to the experimentally relevant continuum limit of a uniform density of parallel screw dislocations, i.e., a crystal with finite torsion but vanishing curvature, which can, in practice, be engineered and probed in twisted nanowires and strained semiconductor heterostructures. We also show how torsion provides \textit{in situ} control of emitter--cavity detuning and light--matter coupling in cavity QED, in direct analogy with strain tuning of semiconductor quantum dots in nanocavities, but here arising from a purely geometric/topological parameter.

- **TL;DR**: 本文系统性地构建了Kramers-Wannier对偶缺陷，使用链复形框架和奇异关联器方法

Defects associated with non-invertible symmetries have attracted significant attention in recent years. Among them, Kramers-Wannier (KW) duality defects have been investigated in both classical statistical systems and quantum Hamiltonian models. Aasen et al. analyzed duality defects in the 2D Ising model and in statistical models built from fusion categories, while Koide et al. later constructed a duality defect in 4D lattice gauge theory. In this work, we extend these developments by providing a systematic construction of KW duality defects/KW defects for a broad class of models formulated within the chain complex framework. Our construction employs the strange correlator, an overlap between a topologically ordered state and a product state, to realize these KW defects.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究通过实验和理论计算分析了荧光微孔聚合物PIM-1与硝基芳香族爆炸物（DNT和TNT）的分子相互作用，揭示了其在薄膜爆炸物传感器中的应用潜力。

This work investigates the molecular-level interactions of a fluorescent microporous polymer (PIM-1) with nitroaromatic explosives, in the context of thin film explosive sensors. Thin films of the PIM-1 were exposed to 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT) and 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), and their steady-state absorption and emission spectra measured. For comparison, the response of PIM-1 to non-explosive molecules such as benzene (BN) was also explored. Complementary electronic-structure calculations were used to predict absorption and emission spectra and to determine binding energies for the PIM-1-analyte complexes. The calculations agree well with experiment and reveal that association of nitroaromatic analyte molecules with PIM-1 alters the energy levels and the arrangements of frontier orbitals, indicating significant molecular interactions. Calculations show that the electronic properties and photo-excited electron transfer can be described by interaction with a single repeat unit of the polymer. The molecular binding, however, involves interaction with at least three repeat units, with the DNT or TNT molecule binding into a pocket in the contorted structure of the microporous polymer. Together, the experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that PIM-1 is a promising platform for selective nitroaromatic detection and provide molecular design principles that could improve sensitivity and selectivity in future sensor materials.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种结合神经网络和切片Wasserstein度量的统计可控微观结构重建框架，能够在小样本下实现随机、可控、异质和大尺寸的3D微观结构重建。

Heterogeneous porous materials play a crucial role in various engineering systems. Microstructure characterization and reconstruction provide effective means for modeling these materials, which are critical for conducting physical property simulations, structure-property linkage studies, and enhancing their performance across different applications. To achieve superior controllability and applicability with small sample sizes, we propose a statistically controllable microstructure reconstruction framework that integrates neural networks with sliced-Wasserstein metric. Specifically, our approach leverages local pattern distribution for microstructure characterization and employs a controlled sampling strategy to generate target distributions that satisfy given conditional parameters. A neural network-based model establishes the mapping from the input distribution to the target local pattern distribution, enabling microstructure reconstruction. Combinations of sliced-Wasserstein metric and gradient optimization techniques minimize the distance between these distributions, leading to a stable and reliable model. Our method can perform stochastic and controllable reconstruction tasks even with small sample sizes. Additionally, it can generate large-size (e.g. 512 and 1024) 3D microstructures using a chunking strategy. By introducing spatial location masks, our method excels at generating spatially heterogeneous and complex microstructures. We conducted experiments on stochastic reconstruction, controllable reconstruction, heterogeneous reconstruction, and large-size microstructure reconstruction across various materials. Comparative analysis through visualization, statistical measures, and physical property simulations demonstrates the effectiveness, providing new insights and possibilities for research on structure-property linkage and material inverse design.

Numerical studies of some unidimensional systems provide evidence of finite thermal conductivity, where theory predicts a divergence with the system size. Some models are here reviewed under the working hypothesis that the energy flux across a nonequilibrium stationary state may be the sum of two contributions: the former responsible for normal conductivity, the latter accounting for the anomalous component. I conclude that in the thermodynamic limit, the diverging component is indeed present, although the crossover to a regime dominated by the anomalous component may occur at extremely long system sizes.
  Finally, I study a variant of the ding-a-ling model, previously claimed to satisfy Fourier law, showing that it too exhibits a diverging conductivity in the thermodynamic limit.

### Heat Capacity of Thermally Reduced Graphene Oxide: Compaction and Thermal Annealing Effects

We present a comprehensive investigation of the low-temperature heat capacity of thermally reduced graphene oxide (trGO) as a function of compaction pressure and annealing temperature. Graphene oxide was synthesized using a modified Hummers method and subsequently thermally reduced at 300\,°C, 500\,°C, and 700\,°C under vacuum to systematically vary the oxygen content and structural ordering. The specific heat data in the 2--300\,K range reveal that the thermal response is governed by phonons, including contributions from a Schottky-type anomaly, a defect-related linear term, a Debye term, and a dispersive term with a negative coefficient associated with out-of-plane flexural (ZA) phonons. Increasing compaction pressure alters interlayer coupling and leads to non-monotonic changes in heat capacity, while higher annealing temperatures enhance graphitization, reduce disorder, and modify phonon dispersion. The absence of a boson peak -- similar to that observed in carbon nanotubes -- supports the dominance of two-dimensional vibrational modes. These findings elucidate the relationship between dimensionality, structural disorder, and processing parameters in shaping the phonon dynamics of trGO, providing guidance for tailoring its thermal behavior in advanced carbon-based functional materials.

The discovery of two-dimensional magnetic materials has provided an ideal platform for exploring physical phenomena in the two-dimensional limit. However, intrinsic two-dimensional antiferromagnetic materials have been rarely reported, limiting systematic studies of their electronic properties. The discovery of novel intrinsic two-dimensional antiferromagnets and the development of robust synthesis strategies, therefore, remain significant challenges. Here, we report the chemical vapor deposition synthesis of CrOCl monolayer films and nanosheets that exhibit excellent air stability. The CrOCl morphology is tunable, ranging from two-dimensional nanosheets to three-dimensional flower-like structures, with lateral sizes ranging from several microns to continuous monolayer films. Structural characterization confirms the materials composition and high crystalline quality. Furthermore, magnetic measurements, supported by theoretical calculations, reveal a Néel temperature for CrOCl of ~14 K. This work provides a reliable route for preparing two-dimensional antiferromagnetic materials.

Quantum spin liquids can arise from Kitaev magnetic interactions, and exhibit fractionalized excitations with the potential for a topological form of quantum computation. This review surveys recent experimental and theoretical progress on the pursuit of phenomena related to Kitaev magnetism in layered and exfoliatable materials, which offer numerous opportunities to apply powerful techniques from the field of atomically thin materials. We primarily focus on the antiferromagnetic Mott insulator $α$-RuCl3, which exhibits Kitaev couplings and is readily exfoliated to single- or few-layer sheets, and thus serves as a test bed for developing probes of Kitaev phenomena in atomically thin materials and devices. We introduce the Kitaev model and how it is realized in $α$-RuCl3 and other material candidates; and cover $α$-RuCl3 synthesis and fabrication into van der Waals heterostructure devices. A key discovery is a work-function-mediated charge transfer that heavily dopes both the $α$-RuCl3 and proximate materials, and can enhance Kitaev interactions by up to 50%. We further discuss a wide range of recent results in electronic transport and optical and tunneling spectroscopies of $α$-RuCl3 devices. The experimental techniques and theoretical insights developed for $α$-RuCl3 establish a framework for discovering and engineering superior two-dimensional Kitaev materials that may ultimately realize elusive quantum spin liquid phases.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究通过N2Ar二聚体系统，利用同步辐射和符合测量技术，结合从头计算，揭示了分子间多重电荷转移的详细动力学过程，包括结构演化和非绝热转变。

The details of multiple charge transfer within or among molecules (including the accompanying molecular structure evolution and energy distribution) are typically not accessible on a single molecule level in experiments targeting complex condensed chemical or biological systems. In order to gather such detailed insight, small prototype systems that cover the essence of such processes need to be identified and investigated. Here, we employ a small system consisting of a combination of covalent and van der Waals bonds for our studies, namely N2Ar dimers. We use synchrotron radiation to site-selectively enable the charge transfer processes and perform a coincidence measurement of the resulting electrons and ions. In combination with ab initio calculations, this approach enables a step-by-step tracking of the charge transfer and fragmentation dynamics. We find that ultrafast structural evolution of the dimer can trigger a second CT, thereby opening complex reaction pathways, in which electrons transfer back and forth between Ar and N2, and nonadiabatic transitions occur twice through conical intersections. These results demonstrate that multiple CT-induced transitions, particularly in such a simple dimer system, provide benchmark insights into the mechanisms of nonadiabatic reactions in complex natural systems.

- **TL;DR**: 本文分析了动态断裂模拟中结合外聚区模型和罚函数接触方法时出现的严重不稳定性问题，识别了三种能量漂移机制，并评估了自适应罚函数策略的改进效果。

Dynamic fragmentation simulations are essential for predicting material response at high strain rates, yet explicit dynamic simulations that combine an extrinsic cohesive-zone model (CZM) with penalty-based contact often exhibit severe instabilities. In a two-dimensional benchmark, we observe exponential energy growth and resulting artificial fragmentation under standard contact penalty settings and time step choices, which motivates a systematic analysis of instability sources. Three mechanisms are isolated and quantified: (i) diverging initial cohesive stiffness, which constrains the stable time step; (ii) discontinuous stiffness jumps at the cohesive-contact interface; and (iii) discontinuity introduced by cohesive softening. Analytical error estimates, phase-space diagnostics, and energy growth metrics reveal that repeated cohesive-contact switching can accumulate small per-step energy errors into long-term energy drift. Within the explored parameter space, maintaining stability requires time steps well below the usual limit. To mitigate these energy artifacts, we assess an adaptive penalty strategy that ties the contact stiffness to the evolving cohesive stiffness. This modification eliminates the discontinuity and restores energy conservation, but it allows larger interpenetration, making it suitable as a diagnostic rather than a definitive remedy. Overall, our study identifies the root causes of unphysical energy drift and demonstrates that penalty-based contact is not a viable approach for long-term, energy-consistent fragmentation simulations with physically meaningful fragment statistics.

### Hybrid ab initio and empirical machine learning models for the potential energy surface

- **TL;DR**: 提出一种同时结合第一性原理计算数据和实验热力学/结构观测值的混合机器学习模型生成方法，通过包含实验观测值均方误差的损失函数和重加权程序来训练势能面模型。

We propose a methodology to generate hybrid machine learning models for the potential energy surface trained simultaneously on data from ab initio electronic structure calculations and on thermodynamic and/or structural observables from experiment. The approach is based on the use of a loss function that includes the mean square error of observables with respect to their experimental values, in addition to the usual terms involving the mean square error of the energies and forces with respect to ab initio data. We employ a reweighting procedure that allows for the calculation of ensemble averages of observables during training for arbitrary values of the model parameters and on the fly. The method is general and can be applied to any set of static observables. We illustrate the usefulness of this approach by applying it to the generation of hybrid models for liquid water that reproduce accurately the experimental density maximum, the density isobar at 1 bar, and the radial distribution function in molecular dynamics simulations.

- **TL;DR**: 研究了Fe4-xGexN薄膜的反常能斯特效应增强，发现Ge掺杂导致结构从立方相变为四方相，引起霍尔效应和能斯特效应的双分量行为，最大ANE在x=0时为0.9 μV/K，x=1时为-0.85 μV/K。

A series of thin films Fe$_{4-x}$Ge$_x$N (x=0-1) was fabricated onto MgO substrates by magnetron sputtering with the aim of studying the possible enhancement of the anomalous Nernst effect (ANE), envisaged based on Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. The Nernst and Hall effects of the series were systematically analyzed, complemented with resistivity, magnetic, electron microscopy and Mössbauer experiments, and DFT calculations including elastic properties. The Fe$_4$N phase crystallizes in the cubic symmetry with Pm3m space group, whereas a small tetragonal distortion is realized in for x&gt;0.35. From the comparison of the experimental isomer shift with DFT calculations, we conclude that Ge occupies the 4b site in the tetragonal I4/mcm tructure. Ferromagnetic T$_C$ decreases rapidly from 750 K for x=0 to 100 K for x=1. The tetragonal samples with x=0.8 and 1 display two-component behavior in the Hall and Nernst effects hysteresis loops, which can be analyzed as a sum of positive and negative loops with different saturation fields. This unusual behavior is a product of a combination of several factors. (1) Co-existence of two different crystallographic orientations in the tetragonal thin film, namely with the majority of c-axis and minority of a-axis normal to the film surface. (2) Opposite sign of the anomalous Hall and Nernst effects for the direction of magnetization along the a and c-axis revealed by DFT calculation. (3) The magnetocrystalline anisotropy characterized by an easy ab-plane, which is responsible for the different saturation fields for a and c-axis. The maximum ANE was determined to be 0.9 $μ$V/K for x=0 at room temperature, and -0.85 $μ$V/K for x=1 at T=50 K. The rapid increase of ANE of Fe$_3$GeN from low temperatures indicates that, were it not for its low T$_C$, it could surpass ANE of Fe$_4$N.

We theoretically investigate the shape dependence and microscopic mechanism of the magnetoelectric effect, including both nonmagnetic (Edelstein-type) and magnetic origins, in a V-shaped one-dimensional chain model. Numerical calculations based on the Kubo formula reveal that the magnitude of the nonmagnetic-driven magnetoelectric response reaches a maximum at an apex angle of $θ\approx 0.6π$. To clarify the microscopic origin of this behavior, we construct a low-energy effective Hamiltonian by projecting onto the $s$-orbital subspace and demonstrate that the polarity induced by the V-shaped geometry manifests as an effective spin--orbit interaction. An analytical derivation of the Green's function shows that the geometric effect appears as a $T$-matrix contribution, reflecting the local breaking of translational symmetry at the V-shaped edge. Furthermore, by employing a multipole-basis representation, we identify the selection rules that govern the magnetoelectric tensor and reveal that the coupling between the effective spin--orbit interaction and the orbital angular momentum generated across the apex plays an essential role. The resulting angular dependence, $\sinθ\sin{θ/2}$, peaks at $θ= 2\tan^{-1}\sqrt{2} \approx 0.608π$, in good agreement with the numerical results. We also analyze a ferromagnetic V-shaped model including the Zeeman interaction and show that the magnetic-driven magnetoelectric response originates from the spin magnetization induced by the coupling between the electric-field--driven charge-potential gradient and the Zeeman term. These findings demonstrate that the V-shaped geometry gives rise to distinct magnetoelectric mechanisms depending on the presence or absence of time-reversal symmetry and provide a microscopic framework for understanding shape-induced multipole phenomena in mesoscopic and bulk systems.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种理论机制来解释反铁磁金属中观察到的负磁阻现象，该机制基于T2对称性破缺，与场和电流方向几乎各向同性，不同于已知的巨磁阻和手性反常机制。

Layered van der Waals crystals of topologically non-trivial and trivial semimetals with antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering of magnetic sublattice are known to exhibit a negative magnetoresistance that is well correlated with AFM magnetization changes in a magnetic field. This effect is reported in several experimental studies with EuFe2As2, EuSn2As2, EuSn2P2, etc., where the resistance decreases quadratically with field by about 5% up to the spin-polarization field. Although this effect is well documented experimentally, its theoretical explanation is missing up to date. Here, we propose a theoretical mechanism describing the observed magnetoresistance that is inherent in AFM metals and is based on violation the binary T2 symmetry. It is almost isotropic to the field and current directions, contrary to the known mechanisms such as giant magnetoresistance and chiral anomaly. The proposed intrinsic mechanism of magnetoresistance is strong in a wide class of the layered AFM-ordered semimetals. The theoretically calculated magnetoresistance is qualitatively consistent with experimental data for crystals of various composition.

Nanoprecipitation, the rapid solvent-displacement route to nanoscale phase separation, has matured from a simple batch operation into a versatile platform for nanomaterial synthesis. This review synthesizes recent progress in stimulus-assisted nanoprecipitation, wherein externally applied triggers (ultrasonic, electrical, supergravity, thermal, chemical, and photonic/other stimuli) are integrated with contemporary mixing technologies (batch, flash, microfluidic, membrane and high-shear reactors) to decouple and selectively control over nucleation, growth kinetics, and assembly processes. These methods allow for the precise tuning of the size, morphology, stability and functionality of nanoparticles (NPs), thereby broadening their applications in drug delivery, catalysis and materials science. We distill mechanistic principles by which each stimulus alters local supersaturation, chain mobility, interfacial instabilities, or droplet/film microreactor dynamics, and compare advantages and limitations by surveying research works from recent years. We also explore the potential development trends of multiscale coupling models, design rules for stimulus-compatible continuous reactors, and adoption of data-driven optimization frameworks to expand the capabilities of nanoprecipitation for advanced nanomaterial design.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种统一的工作流程，通过高斯过程回归从分子动力学数据重建亥姆霍兹自由能表面，结合谐波/准谐波理论的零点能量校正，用于计算热力学性质。

Accurate free-energy calculations are essential for predicting thermodynamic properties and phase stability, but existing methods are limited: phonon-based approaches neglect anharmonicity and liquids, while molecular dynamics (MD) is computationally demanding, neglects low-temperature quantum effects, and often requires manual planning and post-processing of simulations. We present a unified workflow that reconstructs the Helmholtz free-energy surface from MD data using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), augmented with zero-point energy corrections from harmonic/quasi-harmonic theory. The framework propagates statistical uncertainties, mitigates finite-size effects, and employs active learning to optimize sampling in the volume-temperature space. It applies seamlessly to both crystalline and liquid phases. We demonstrate the methodology by computing heat capacities, thermal expansion, isothermal and adiabatic bulk moduli, and melting properties for nine elemental FCC and BCC metals using 20 classical and machine-learned interatomic potentials, with all predictions accompanied by quantified confidence intervals. Automated, general, and uncertainty-aware, the workflow advances high-throughput thermodynamics and provides a systematic benchmark for interatomic potentials.

We derive an explicit analytic expression for the first quantum correction to the second virial coefficient of a $d$-dimensional fluid whose particles interact via the generalized Lennard-Jones $(2n,n)$ potential. By introducing an appropriate change of variable, the correction term is reduced to a single integral that can be evaluated in closed form in terms of parabolic cylinder or generalized Hermite functions. The resulting expression compactly incorporates both dimensionality and stiffness, providing direct access to the low- and high-temperature asymptotic regimes. In the special case of the standard Lennard-Jones fluid ($d=3$, $n=6$), the formula obtained is considerably more compact than previously reported representations based on hypergeometric functions. The knowledge of this correction allows us to determine the first quantum contribution to the Boyle temperature, whose dependence on dimensionality and stiffness is explicitly analyzed. Moreover, the same methodology can be systematically extended to obtain higher-order quantum corrections.

This study investigates the synthesis and luminescence behavior of $\mathrm{Ce_{x}La_{0.95-x}Tb_{0.05}F_{3}}$ nanoparticles with varying $\mathrm{Ce^{3+}}$ content. The materials were prepared via a wet chemical route and thermally annealed to improve crystallinity and reduce defects. Phase composition and structural parameters were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD), while elemental composition was determined by X-ray fluorescence (XRF). Cathodoluminescence (CL) intensity mapping was used to evaluate emission uniformity and monitor the degradation of luminescence under electron beam exposure. Photoluminescence (PL) and radioluminescence (RL) spectroscopy confirmed energy transfer from $\mathrm{Ce^{3+}}$ to $\mathrm{Tb^{3+}}$ ions. Luminescence intensities were found to depend strongly on both Ce content and thermal treatment. The results contribute to the understanding of defect-related quenching mechanisms and are relevant for the design of rare-earth-based luminescent nanomaterials for biomedical applications.

The low-temperature isochoric heat capacity of cryocrystals was scaled using the universal scaling function. This universality links the magnitude of the anomaly and the characteristic temperature of the hump $T_{\mathrm{max}}$ in heat capacity, which is related to the first van Hove singularity in the phonon spectrum. For atomic, molecular, and quantum cryocrystals, $T_{\mathrm{max}}$ systematically shifts with molar volume, reflecting Brillouin zone scaling and revealing a common vibrational origin. These findings for the scaling function bridge thermodynamics with the vibrational density of states, highlighting fundamental universality in lattice dynamics.

We investigated the isotropic spin-1/2 Heisenberg model on an anisotropic square lattice with competing exchange interactions, motivated by the unconventional magnetic behavior observed in the verdazyl-based compound (o-MePy-V)PF6. Using a cluster mean-field approach, we explore a field-induced phase stabilized by the interplay between frustration and quantum fluctuations, focusing on the role of exchange interactions. We identify: (i) the formation of spin singlet pairs, signaled by enhanced spin-spin correlations in specific field regimes; and (ii) a one-half magnetization plateau, emerging from a subtle balance between competing exchange couplings and field-enhanced quantum fluctuations. Our results reveal that an enhancement of frustration, achieved by tuning small variations in the spatially anisotropic exchange interactions of the compound (o-MePy-V)PF6, can stabilize a field-induced quantum phase where ferromagnetism coexists with antiferromagnetic dimers. Our results provide microscopic insight into the mechanisms driving these nontrivial phases and offer theoretical support for interpreting experimental observations in this class of low-dimensional quantum magnets.

We investigate heat conduction in a one-dimensional chain of rigid rotors. The rotors are constrained to rotate in a plane about fixed pivot points and coupled by springs, such that in equilibrium, the neighboring rotors lie on opposite sides of the chain axis. The linearized limit of this model valid for small angular displacements, was first introduced by Kane and Lubensky (KL) as a topological mechanical insulator hosting zero-energy vibrational edge modes. We show that the linearized KL chain behaves as a thermal insulator at low temperature in both the topological phases with a finite band gap, and the heat current falls exponentially with the chain length. When the gap vanishes at the topological phase transition, the KL chain becomes a good thermal conductor and conducts heat ballistically. The chain of rotors for arbitrary angular displacements hosts nonlinear solitary waves and distinct topological mechanical phases. Our numerical analysis shows normal (diffusive) heat conduction in all topological phases of the nonlinear chain. Nevertheless, a finite thermal conductivity is achieved for different system sizes in different topological phases of this nonlinear chain.

We propose a precise and efficient physics-augmented neural network (PANN) to model strain-induced crystallization in natural rubber (NR). The approach is based on a two potential framework, similar to the concept of generalized standard materials (GSMs). To describe the material behavior, neural network-based free energy and dissipation potentials are employed. The evolution of crystallinity is derived from the two potentials and resembles a classical GSM-type equation. Two additional Lagrange multipliers together with the corresponding Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions are introduced to ensure boundedness of the crystallinity, such that it can be interpreted as a variable of concentration type. The neural network-based potentials ensure all physically desirable properties by construction. Most importantly, objectivity, material symmetry, and thermodynamic consistency are automatically fulfilled. In addition, an alternative derivation of the governing model equations in time-discrete form is presented based on an incremental variational framework, which also serves as the basis for a finite element implementation. We demonstrate the predictive capability of the PANN using three different experimental data sets from literature, considering both stress and crystallinity evolution at material point level as well as the corresponding field distributions in a notched specimen. Moreover, we demonstrate that our model can be flexibly employed for both unfilled and filled NR.

The occurrence of a finite mismatch between the up and down spin energy channels due to the application of an electric field, leading to the generation of a polarized spin current from an unpolarized beam in antiferromagnetic materials, has already been established. But, in this work, we report for the first time that even in the absence of any electric field, spin polarization can be achieved. We choose a tight-binding antiferromagnetic helix, where the strengths of magnetic moments at different lattice sites are non-uniform. The non-uniformity is introduced in two distinct forms, correlated and uncorrelated, and in each case we find a high degree of spin polarization. The Greens formalism is used to compute the results under various input conditions, and the results are valid for a broad range of physical parameters. Our analysis can open up a new direction of getting spin selectivity in different magnetic systems with zero net magnetization, in the absence of an electric field.

- **TL;DR**: 应用相关矩阵重整化理论(CMRT)研究CeN在压力下的行为，预测了B1到B2相的一级相变，伴随11%体积塌缩和4f电子从局域到巡游的转变。

We apply correlation matrix renormalization theory (CMRT) to cerium nitride (CeN) under pressure. For B1 (NaCl-type) phase, CMRT gives an equation of state consistent with ambient pressure experiments. It produces electronic density-of-state (DOS) characterized by a sharp 4f quasi-particle resonance peak pinned at the Fermi level and two subbands formed by strong hybridization between the localized Ce-4f electrons and the itinerant Ce-5d and N-2p electrons below the Fermi level, consistent with XPS experiments. Upon compression, CMRT predicts a first-order B1 to B2 (CsCl-type) transition with ~11% volume collapse. Across the transition, the 4f spectral weight broadens, the 4f orbital occupancy increases, and the hybridization with conduction states enhances, signaling a crossover from partially localized to more itinerant 4f behavior. These features are in excellent agreement with experimental observations, demonstrating that CMRT provides a parameter-free description and prediction of correlation-driven structural and electronic transitions in rare-earth compounds.

We study a class of stochastic resetting (SR) processes in which a diffusing particle alternates between free motion and confinement by an externally controlled potential. When the particle is recaptured, it undergoes a return trajectory that drives it toward a designated reset point. In standard SR, such returns are treated as instantaneous, but in realistic setups they have finite duration and introduce imprecision in the starting points of subsequent search attempts. We analyze a fluctuating harmonic potential in which return trajectories are forcibly terminated the moment the particle reaches the origin, ensuring that all outward (diffusive) trajectories begin from the same point. This is implemented through instantaneous positional information: a feedback signal that shortens the return phase without incurring additional mechanical energetic cost. We examine several search protocols built on this controlled return mechanism and determine their mean first-passage times (MFPTs). Of particular interest is a protocol in which outward diffusion is eliminated entirely and the return motion itself becomes the search mechanism. This "search by return" perspective reverses the conventional logic of SR and yields a closed-form MFPT that highlights the efficiency of using return dynamics as the primary search strategy.

We study the three-dimensional topological insulator (Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_{x}$)$_{2}$Te$_{3}$ in its ultrathin limit i.e. when the thickness is of the same order as the surface state penetration depth. It is expected that in this limit a hybridization gap opens at the Dirac point, which gives rise to a quantum spin Hall (QSH) or insulating phase, depending on the material thickness. We fabricate (Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_{x}$)$_{2}$Te$_{3}$ Hall bars with a thicknesses of 6 and 9 nm and measure an insulating phase around the Dirac point for low bias and at sub-Kelvin temperatures only in samples fabricated from the 6 nm films, which indicates the presence of a hybridization gap. The effect of a perpendicular magnetic field on the hybridization gap is studied but remains partially unresolved. The results form an important step towards experimentally realizing the quantum spin Hall state via hybridization in ultrathin films of (Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_{x}$)$_{2}$Te$_{3}$, yet, they also expose a knowledge gap regarding transport measurements in these systems.

Trained on high-quality MPS data from complex contour time evolution and incorporating derivative constraints with respect to the complex-time angle, our model achieves smooth generalization to the real-frequency axis. Benchmarking on the single-band Hubbard model for the Bethe lattice demonstrates quantitative accuracy across metallic, strongly correlated, and insulating regimes.

In Markov networks, measurement blackouts with unknown frequency compromise observations such that thermodynamic quantities can no longer be inferred reliably. In particular, the observed currents neither discern equilibrium from non-equilibrium nor can they be used in extant estimators of entropy production. Our strategy to eliminate these effects is based on formally attributing the blackouts to a second channel connecting states. The unknown frequency of blackouts and the true underlying transition rates can be determined from the short-time limit of observed waiting-time distributions. A post-modification of observed trajectory data yields a virtual effective dynamics from which the lower bound on entropy production based on thermodynamic uncertainty relations can be recovered fully. Moreover, the post-processed data can be used in waiting-time based estimators. Crucially, our strategy does neither require the blackouts to occur homogeneously nor symmetrically under time-reversal.

- **TL;DR**: 通过研究硅从晶态到非晶态相变过程中的高次谐波生成，发现非晶相中隧道电离产额显著增强，同时无序诱导的退相干效应抑制了高阶谐波生成。

High-harmonic generation (HHG) is a strong-field phenomenon that is sensitive to the attosecond dynamics of tunnel ionization and coherent transport of electron-hole pairs in solids. While the foundations of solid HHG have been established, a deep understanding into the nature of decoherence on sub-cycle timescales remains elusive. Furthermore, there is a growing need for tools to control ionization at the nanoscale. Here, we study HHG in silicon along a crystalline-to-amorphous (c-Si to a-Si) structural phase transition and observe a dramatic reshaping of the spectrum, with enhanced lower-order harmonic yield accompanied by quenching of the higher-order harmonics. Modelling the real-space quantum dynamics links our observations to a giant enhancement (&gt;250 times) of tunnel ionization yield in the amorphous phase and a disorder-induced decoherence that damps the electron-hole polarization over approximately six lattice sites. HHG spectroscopy also reveals remnant order that was not apparent with conventional probes. Finally, we observe a rapid and targeted non-resonant laser annealing of amorphous silicon islands. Our results offer a unique insight into attosecond decoherence in strong-field phenomena, establish HHG spectroscopy as a probe of structural disorder, and pave the way for new opportunities in lightwave nanoelectronics.

Nonequilibrium charge transport through a trimer molecular transistor composed of three quantum dots arranged in a triangular geometry, which is placed on a substrate, has been studied in the presence of electron electron and electron phonon interactions. The entire system is described by an extended Anderson Holstein Caldeira Leggett Hamiltonian, in which the Caldeira Leggett term accounts for phonon damping arising from the coupling between the molecular vibrations and the substrate phonon bath. The electron phonon interaction is treated nonperturbatively using the Lang Firsov canonical transformation, while the electron electron interaction is incorporated at the mean field level. Keldysh nonequilibrium Greens function framework is used to study the transport properties, allowing us to calculate the spectral function, tunneling current, ad differential conductance of the trimer molecular transistor. The formalism enables systematic evaluation of the effects of Coulomb interaction, electron phonon coupling, and dissipation on the devices electronic transport characteristics.

- **TL;DR**: 4Hb-TaS_2是一种范德华超晶格，由交替堆叠的Ising超导1H-TaS_2和团簇Mott绝缘1T-TaS_2组成，表现出超越其组成层的新兴性质。研究发现层间相互作用导致布里渊区中心的金属态折叠形成手性风车费米面，并与表面1T层的平带杂化产生类Kondo峰。

4Hb-TaS_2, a van der Waals superlattice comprising alternate stacked Ising superconducting 1H-TaS_2 and cluster Mott insulating 1T-TaS_2, exhibits emergent properties beyond those of its constituent layers. Notable phenomena include time-reversal-symmetry-breaking superconductivity and spontaneous vortex phases, which are driven by nontrivial interlayer interactions that remain debated. Using area-selective angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we provide direct spectroscopic evidence of such interaction by systematically probing the electronic structures of 1T- and 1H-terminted surfaces of 4Hb-TaS_2. The metallic states of subsurface 1H-layers are folded to the Brillouin zone center by the sqrt(13) by sqrt(13) modulation of the surface 1T-layer, forming chiral "windmill" Fermi surfaces via Umklapp scattering. These conducting states further hybridize with the incipient flat band of the surface 1T-layer, producing a Kondo-like peak at the Fermi level. Interlayer charge transfer induces distinct 3 by 3 and 2 by 2 charge orders on the surface and subsurface 1H-layers, respectively, which result in characteristic segmented Fermi surfaces and dichotomously shift the van Hove singularities. These findings reconcile the competing Kondo and Mott-Hubbard models in this material and emphasize the interplay of flat bands, van hove singularities, charge orders, and unconventional superconductivity in correlated superlattices.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文研究了Eguchi-Oki-Matsumura模型中同时发生的序-无序转变和相分离过程，通过引入对流-粘性Cahn-Hilliard方程，证明了该系统存在精确的行波解。

To describe the simultaneous order-disorder transformation and phase separation Eguchi, Oki and Matsumura [\doi{10.1557/proc-21-589}] introduced the system of two equations: one equation, governing the evolution of a conserved order parameter, and the second equation for the non-conserved order parameter. The key feature of their model is the free energy functional, which contains the square gradient terms of the both order parameters and a fourth power polynomial depending on both order parameters. According to the general Hohenberg-Halperin classification it is the type C model. We show that if the dynamics of the conserved order parameter is governed by the convective-viscous Cahn-Hilliard equation, this system allows exact traveling wave solution.

A thorough study of the wide-range (40-35000 cm-1) dynamic conductivity spectra of the rare-earth (RE) dodecaborides RB12 (R- Ho, Er and Tm) and Tm1-xYbxB12 substitutional solid solutions was carried out at room temperature. Both the Drude-type components and overdamped excitations have been separated and analyzed. An additional absorption band observed above 200 cm-1 in these RB12 with magnetic RE ions is attributed to the cooperative Jahn-Teller dynamics of the B12 complexes, which depends crucially on the RE-ion cage space and is compared with the same effect found in the non-magnetic LuB12 and ZrB12. It was shown that non-equilibrium (hot) electrons participating in the formation of the collective JT modes dominate in charge transport, and portion of Drude-type carriers changes by 20-40% in these compounds with unstable boron lattice. Strong renormalization of the infrared response is observed in Tm1-xYbxB12 solid solutions with metal-insulator transition (MIT) and is discussed in terms of localized collective modes caused by Yb-ion valence instability. We demonstrate that even at room temperature the MIT is accompanied with simultaneous decrease in concentration of Drude-type electrons and redistribution of carriers to localized JT collective modes.

- **TL;DR**: 在t'/t=-0.45的哈伯德模型中，通过D-TRILEX方法自洽考虑铁磁涨落导致电子谱函数在低温下分裂，但费米面保持不分裂且面积增大，反映了非费米液体电子激发。

We consider the electronic and magnetic properties of the Hubbard model on a square lattice with the ratio of the next-nearest-neighbor and nearest-neighbor hoppings $t'/t=-0.45$, which favours the ferromagnetic instability. We find, that a self-consistent consideration of the ferromagnetic fluctuations within the D-TRILEX approach results in the splitting of the electronic spectral function at low temperatures. This splitting exhibits only a weak momentum dependence, and only one of the split bands crosses the Fermi level. As a result, the Fermi surface itself remains unsplit, but its area increases, reflecting the presence of non-Fermi-liquid electronic excitations. We show that both the self-consistent account of the non-local contributions to the electronic self-energy and the proper treatment of electron interaction vertices in D-TRILEX are important to obtain this behaviour.
