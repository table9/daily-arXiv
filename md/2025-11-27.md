- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种混合物理-神经模型，能够比传统3D模拟快几个数量级地预测复杂域中的标量输运，从数小时缩短到不到1分钟。

Numerical simulations provide key insights into many physical, real-world problems. However, while these simulations are solved on a full 3D domain, most analysis only require a reduced set of metrics (e.g. plane-level concentrations). This work presents a hybrid physics-neural model that predicts scalar transport in a complex domain orders of magnitude faster than the 3D simulation (from hours to less than 1 min). This end-to-end differentiable framework jointly learns the physical model parameterization (i.e. orthotropic diffusivity) and a non-Markovian neural closure model to capture unresolved, 'coarse-grained' effects, thereby enabling stable, long time horizon rollouts. This proposed model is data-efficient (learning with 26 training data), and can be flexibly extended to an out-of-distribution scenario (with a moving source), achieving a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.96 at the final simulation time. Overall results show that this differentiable physics-neural framework enables fast, accurate, and generalizable coarse-grained surrogates for physical phenomena.

- **TL;DR**: 提出统一的键偶极理论解释金属-半导体界面的偶极子和费米能级钉扎，认为局域键合是主要机制，金属诱导带隙态、悬键表面态和价带中的键合态都是同一界面键合机制的不同表现。

We present a unified bond dipole theory for metal-semiconductor interfaces to explain the microscopic origin of interface dipoles and Fermi level pinning (FLP) in terms of Harrison's bond-orbital model. By combining first-principles calculations with tight-binding analysis, we show that localized bonding between semiconductor surface dangling bonds and metal orbitals is sufficient to generate a large interface dipole and induce strong FLP, even when only a single metal monolayer is present. Within this framework, metal-induced gap states (MIGS), dangling-bond-induced surface states (DBSS), and bonding states embedded in the valence band are all understood as different outcomes of the same underlying interface bonding mechanism, rather than as independent causes of FLP. We further establish that the key parameter governing FLP strength is the density of surface dangling bonds that can form new chemical bonds with the metal, which directly controls the magnitude of the bond-induced interface dipole. This picture naturally explains the weaker pinning observed in more ionic semiconductors than in covalent ones and provides practical guidance for engineering metal-semiconductor interfaces and tuning Schottky barrier heights.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究通过密度泛函理论分析扭曲铋双层的边缘电子特性和振动特性，发现边缘结构无序导致费米能级电子态密度显著增强，最高可达完美晶体的10倍，这为大幅提高超导临界温度提供了新机制。

Twisted bilayers offer a compelling and, at times, confounding platform for the engineering of new twistronic materials. Whereas standard studies almost exclusively focus on the explicit enigma that is presented by twist-angles, perhaps better epitomized by the related phenomena that have been observed in twisted bilayer graphene, functional devices necessarily face a fundamental concern: boundary heterogeneity in their structures. In this study, we address this concern by strictly investigating the electronic properties of twisted bismuth bilayers at the flake's edges and the vibrational properties of the flake. Twisted flakes exhibit continuous variations of these properties, away from the bulk, as we herein report using ab initio density functional theory, by systematically mapping the drastic evolution of band topology, electronic density of states, and possible superconductivity. Our work reveals a dramatic, non-fortuitous consequence of the structural disorder at the edges of the flakes: an enhanced electronic density of states at the Fermi level. This enhancement reaches a maximum of 10 times that of perfect-crystalline bismuth. Given that the superconducting critical temperature, Tc, is exponentially dependent on the electronic density of states at the Fermi level, this substantial structural variation immediately suggests a powerful mechanism for vastly increasing Tc. We also identify the twist-angle as a new critical parameter in designing novel engineering devices with topologically enhanced properties. Our results provide a necessary theoretical framework for interpreting new data for the upcoming generation of twistronic heterogeneous materials, and pave the way to search for atomic disordered metastable structures that could lead to enhanced superconducting transition temperatures.

To this day, high-temperature cuprate superconductors remain an unparalleled platform for studying the competition and coexistence of emergent, static and dynamic, quantum phases of matter exhibiting high transition temperature non-s-wave superconductivity, non-Fermi liquid transport and a still enigmatic pseudogap regime. However, how superconductivity emerges alongside and competes with the pseudogap regime remains an open question. Here, we present a high-resolution, time- and angle-resolved photoemission study of the near-antinodal region of optimally-doped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+δ}$. For a sufficiently high excitation fluence, we disrupt superconductivity and drive a transient change from a symmetric superconducting-like to an asymmetric pseudogap-like density of states, for electronic temperatures well below the equilibrium superconducting critical temperature. Conversely, when the superconductivity is fully restored, the pseudogap is suppressed, as signaled by a fully particle-hole symmetric density of states. A unique aspect of our experiments is that the pseudogap coexists with superconducting features at intermediate times or at intermediate fluence. Our findings challenge the paradigm that superconductivity emerges by establishing phase coherence in the pseudogap. Instead, our experimental results, supported by phenomenological theory, demonstrate that the two states compete, and that the low-temperature ground state of the cuprates originates from a competition between superconducting and pseudogap states.

### Bridging Atomistic and Mesoscale Lithium Transport via Machine-Learned Force Fields and Markov State Models

- **TL;DR**: 本文提出了一个从AIMD到MLFF再到MSM的多尺度工作流，用于准确描述固态电池阳极中的锂离子扩散过程，克服了传统AIMD模拟的时间尺度限制。

Lithium diffusion in solid-state battery anodes occurs through thermally activated hops between metastable sites often separated by large energy barriers, making such events rare on ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) timescales. Here, we present a bottom-up multiscale workflow that integrates AIMD, machine-learned force fields (MLFFs), and Markov state models (MSMs) to establish a quantitatively consistent link between atomistic hopping mechanisms and mesoscale transport. MLFFs fine-tuned on AIMD reference data retain near-DFT accuracy while enabling large-scale molecular dynamics simulations extending to tens of nanoseconds. These extended trajectories remove the strong finite-size bias present in AIMD and yield diffusion coefficients in excellent agreement with experiment. Furthermore, from these long MLFF trajectories, we obtain statistically converged lithium jump networks and construct MSMs that remain Markovian across more than two orders of magnitude in the lag times used for their construction. The resulting MSMs faithfully reproduce mean-square displacements and recover rare diffusion processes that do not occur on AIMD timescales. In addition to propagating lithium distributions, the MSM transition matrices provide mechanistic insight: their eigenvalues and eigenvectors encode characteristic relaxation timescales and dominant transport pathways. Although demonstrated for defect-free crystalline Li$_x$Si$_y$ phases, the AIMD$\rightarrow$MLFF$\rightarrow$MSM framework is general and provides a transferable approach for describing lithium transport in amorphous materials, defect-mediated diffusion, and next-generation solid-state anodes.

### A new Fractal Mean-Field analysis in phase transition

Understanding phase transitions requires not only identifying order parameters but also characterizing how their correlations behave across scales. By quantifying how fluctuations at distinct spatial or temporal points are related, correlation functions reveal the structural organization of complex systems. Here, we revisit the theoretical foundations of these correlations in systems undergoing second-order phase transitions, with emphasis on the Ising model extended to non-integer spatial dimensions. Starting from the classical framework introduced by Fisher, we discuss how the standard Euclidean treatment, restricted to integer dimensions, necessitates the introduction of the critical exponent $η$ to capture the spatial decay of correlations at $T=T_c$. We suppose that, at criticality, the equilibrium dynamics become effectively confined to the fractal edge of spin clusters. Within this framework, the fractal dimension that governs the correlations in that subspace is directly related to Fisher exponent, which quantifies the singular behavior of the correlation function near criticality. Importantly, this correlation fractal dimension is distinct from the fractal dimension associated with the order parameter. We further derive an explicit geometrical relation connecting the two fractal dimensions, thereby linking spatial self-similarity to the observed scaling behavior at criticality. This treatment naturally extends to non-integer spatial dimensions, which remain valid below the upper critical dimension and produce the correct value of Fisher exponent $η$ for a continuous space dimension. Our analysis also confirms that the Rushbrooke scaling relation, continues to hold when the spatial dimension is treated as a continuous parameter, reinforcing the universality of critical scaling and underscoring the role of fractal geometry in characterizing correlations at criticality.

- **TL;DR**: 研究了带隙双层石墨烯中的边缘态传导，发现特定边缘终止类型可在带隙内产生边缘态，产生非局域电阻，且边缘局域化可通过电子能量调控

We investigate electronic transport in gapped bilayer graphene (gBLG) devices. For certain edge terminations -typically a combination of zigzag, armchair, and bearded types - we observe edge state conduction within the band gap, which is opened by a potential bias between the two layers. The edge states can generate a non-local resistance, in line with recent experiments [1]. Band structure calculations of gBLG nanoribbons corroborate the existence of the edge states, whose edge localization can be switched by tuning the electron energy. Their existence strongly depends on the edge termination and does not originate from a topological bulk-boundary correspondence.

### Strong-coupling theory of bilayer plasmon excitations

- **TL;DR**: 本文提出了强耦合理论分析双层系统的电荷动力学，发现尽管理论框架与弱耦合方法不同，但得到的等离子体激发相似，关键区别在于强耦合框架下粒子-空穴激发明显抑制，使等离子体模式在更宽动量范围内保持良好定义。

Recently plasmon excitations in bilayer lattice systems were studied extensively in the weak-coupling regime. Unlike single-layer systems, these bilayers exhibit two distinct modes, $ω_{\pm}$, which show characteristic dependences upon the momentum and hopping integrals along the $z$ direction. To apply them to cuprates, strong correlation effects should be considered, but a comprehensive analysis has not yet been investigated. In this work, we present a strong-coupling theory to analyze the charge dynamics of a bilayer system, utilizing the $t$-$J$-$V$ model, which includes the long-range Coulomb interaction, $V$, on a lattice. Although our theoretical framework is fundamentally different from the weak-coupling approach, we find that resulting plasmon excitations are similar to those of a weak-coupling theory. A key distinction is that our strong-coupling framework reveals a noticeable suppression of particle-hole excitations, which allows the plasmon modes to remain well-defined over a wider region of momentum. We suggest that the experimentally reported plasmon excitations in Y-based cuprates can be described by the $ω_{-}$ mode, although we call for more systematic experiments to verify this.

- **TL;DR**: 空位工程通过控制金属和合金中的原子尺度空位，为优化微观结构和性能提供了强大但尚未充分探索的策略，可实现强度、延展性、疲劳寿命、耐腐蚀性和导电性的独特组合。

Vacancy engineering, the intentional control of atomic-scale vacancies in metals and alloys, is emerging as a powerful yet underexplored strategy for tailoring microstructures and optimizing performance across diverse applications. By enabling excess vacancy populations through quenching, severe deformation, thermomechanical treatments, or additive manufacturing, new microstructures can be obtained that achieve unique combinations of strength, ductility, fatigue life, corrosion resistance, and conductivity. Vacancies are distinct among lattice defects: they are non-conserved entities essential for solute diffusion, yet variably coupled to solutes, dislocations, and phase boundaries. They can accelerate transformations such as nucleation and precipitation or retard kinetics when trapped in clusters, and their transient trapping and release can drive microstructural evolution across time and length scales. This Review synthesizes recent advances in generating, modeling, and characterizing vacancies, highlighting their role in diffusion, precipitation, and phase stability. Case studies in lightweight, high-temperature, fatigue-resistant, electrical, and biomedical materials demonstrate the broad potential of vacancy control. We conclude by emphasizing the opportunity for the metallurgical community to fully exploit excess vacancies as controllable, design-relevant defects that enable new pathways for microstructure and property optimization in next-generation alloys.

Superconductivity can coexist or compete with other orders such as magnetism or density waves. Optimizing superconductivity requires identifying competing orders that may disrupt Cooper pair coherence. Here, we use the self-field critical current ($I_{\rm c,sf}$) to probe pressure-tuned superconductivity in the kagome superconductor RbV$_3$Sb$_5$. As pressure destabilizes the charge-density wave (CDW) state, $I_{\rm c,sf}$ drastically enhances, peaking near the critical pressure where the CDW state is completely suppressed at zero temperature. Surprisingly, a weaker $I_{\rm c,sf}$ peak emerges within the CDW phase. Near the pressure of the weaker peak, the superconducting phase transition temperature shifts from an increasing trend with pressure to a near plateau. Our analysis suggests the possibility of a sudden change in the CDW pattern or a Lifshitz transition, highlighting the need for microscopic examinations of the CDW state for understanding the pressure evolution of superconductivity in RbV$_3$Sb$_5$.

### Different Rise Times of Atomic Br M$_{4,5}$ 3d$_{3/2,5/2}$ Core Level Absorptions during Br$_{2}$ C $^{1}Π_{u}$ $1_{u}$ State Dissociation via Extreme Ultraviolet Transient Absorption Spectroscopy

- **TL;DR**: 本文通过阿秒XUV瞬态吸收光谱研究Br₂分子C态的离解动力学，发现不同探测跃迁测得的离解时间存在显著差异（38±1 fs和20±5 fs），揭示了探测跃迁本身对测量结果的影响。

The reported ''dissociation times'' for the Br$_{2}$ C ($^{1}Π_{u}$ $1_{u}$) state by various measurement methods differ widely across the literature (30 to 340 fs). We consider this issue by investigating attosecond extreme ultraviolet (XUV) transient absorption spectroscopy at the Br M4,5 3d$_{3/2,5/2}$ edges (66 to 80 eV), tracking core-to-valence (3d to 4p) and core-to-Rydberg (3d to ns, np, n $\geq$ 5) transitions from the molecular to atomic limit. The progress of dissociation can be ascertained by the buildup of the atomic absorption in time. Notably, the measured rise times of the 3d$_{3/2,5/2}$ to 4p transitions depend on the probed core level final state, 38 $\pm$ 1 and 20 $\pm$ 5 fs for $^{2}$D$_{5/2}$ and $^{2}$D$_{3/2}$ at 64.31 and 65.34 eV, respectively. Simulations by the nuclear time-dependent Schrödinger equation reproduce the rise-time difference of the 3d to 4p transitions, and the theory suggests several important factors. One is the transition dipole moments of each probe transition have different molecular and atomic values for $^{2}$D$_{5/2}$ versus $^{2}$D$_{3/2}$ that depend on the bond length. The other is the merger of multiple molecular absorptions into the same atomic absorption, creating multiple timescales even for a single probe transition. Unfortunately, the core-to-Rydberg absorptions did not allow accurate atomic Br buildup times to be extracted due to spectral overlaps with ground state bleaching, otherwise an even more comprehensive picture of the role of the probe state transition would be possible. This work shows that the measured probe signals accurately contain the dissociative wavepacket dynamics but also reveal how the specific probe transition affects the apparent progress toward dissociation with bond length. Such potential probe-transition-dependent effects need to be considered when interpreting measured signals and their timescales.

Geometric frustration gives rise to emergent quantum phenomena and exotic phases of matter. While Monte Carlo methods are traditionally used to simulate such systems, their sampling efficiency is limited by the complexity of interactions and ground-state properties. Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), a class of probabilistic neural networks, offer improved sampling by incorporating machine learning techniques. However, fully-connected bipartite RBMs are inefficient for representing physical lattices with sparse interactions. To address this, we implement Convolutional Restricted Boltzmann Machines (CRBMs) that leverage translational symmetry inherent to lattices. Using the classical Shastry-Sutherland (SS) Ising lattice, we demonstrate (i) CRBM formulation that captures SS interactions, and (ii) digital hardware accelerator to enhance sampling performance. We simulate lattices with up to 324 spins, recovering all known phases of the SS Ising model, including the long range ordered fractional plateau. Our hardware characterizes spin behavior at critical points and within spin liquid phases. This implementation achieves a speedup of 3 to 5 orders of magnitude (33 ns to 120 ms) over GPU-based implementations. Moreover, the time-to-solution is within two orders of magnitude of quantum annealers, while offering superior scalability, room-temperature operation and reprogrammability. This work paves a pathway for scalable digital hardware that embeds physical symmetries to enable large scale simulations of material systems.

Understanding nanoscale hotspot thermal transport is crucial in electronic devices. Contrary to common perception, recent experiments show that closely spaced nanoscale multiple hotspots can enhance heat dissipation. Here, the thermal transport in nanoscale multiple hotspot systems is investigated by solving the phonon Boltzmann transport equation. The local thermal conductivity is proposed to describe the non-uniform spatial distribution of heat transport capability in nanoscale multiple hotspot systems. The maximum value exceeds the uniform heating case by up to 27%, which is attributed to the spatially varying fraction of unscattered phonons emitted from hotspots. Moreover, the effects and mechanisms of hotspot spacing on thermal transport are investigated, showing that reducing the hotspot spacing can enhance the heat flux by up to 40%. This work challenges the conventional view that thermal transport capability is spatially uniform throughout the system and provides fundamental insights for thermal management in high-power-density integrated circuits.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文提出了Hund投影Kanamori模型，通过将多轨道Hubbard-Kanamori哈密顿量投影到Hund第一规则偏好的高自旋流形，为Hund金属提供了有效的低能描述。

Hund's coupling plays a decisive role in shaping electron correlations of multi-orbital systems, giving rise to a class of materials--Hund's metals--that combine local-moment physics with metallic transport. Here we derive an effective low-energy description of such a system near the Mott insulating regime, starting from the multi-orbital Hubbard-Kanamori Hamiltonian and projecting onto the high-spin manifold favored by Hund's first rule. The resulting Hund-projected Kanamori model captures the interplay between carrier motion and magnetic correlations in the presence of strong Hund's coupling. In the undoped limit, the model reduces to a spin-$N/2$ Heisenberg system with suppressed quantum fluctuations, approaching the classical limit for realistic five-band configurations. Upon doping, carrier motion couples strongly to the spin background and drives ferromagnetic correlations through a Hund-enhanced kinetic mechanism analogous to, but much stronger than, Nagaoka ferromagnetism. Owing to its reduced sign problem, the model can be addressed with advanced path-integral methods to determine quasiparticle structure and effective interactions between carriers-quantities that are challenging to obtain with other methods. This framework establishes a microscopic bridge between the Kanamori model and the emergent magnetic and transport phenomena characteristic of Hund's metals.

Ubiquitous van der Waals (vdW) interactions play a subtle yet crucial role in determining the precise atomic arrangements in solids, particularly in molecular crystals where these weak forces are the primary link between constituent building blocks. Within density functional (DF) theory, the most natural approach for addressing vdW forces is the use of vdW-inclusive density functionals. Through a detailed analysis of the underlying formalism, we have developed a computational scheme that combines vdW functionals of type DF1 and DF2 and serves as a well optimizable tool to improve the theoretical description and prediction of molecular crystals and other sparse materials. The proof of principle is demonstrated by our consideration of the molecular crystals from the X23 dataset.

- **TL;DR**: 通过铝掺杂和中等高压氧退火，成功在常压下稳定了Ruddlesden-Popper双层镍酸盐的四方相结构，但铝掺杂样品表现出半导体性质、局域磁矩和自旋玻璃行为，且即使低浓度铝掺杂也会完全抑制超导性。

Recent studies suggest that the tetragonal phase of the Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) bilayer nickelate, La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ or La$_2$PrNi$_2$O$_7$, which is stabilized under high pressures, is responsible for high-temperature superconductivity (HTSC). In this context, realization of the tetragonal phase at ambient pressure could be a rational step to achieve the goal of ambient-pressure HTSC in the nickelate system. By employing the concept of Goldschmidt tolerance factor, we succeed in stabilizing the tetragonal phase by aluminum doping together with post annealing under moderately high oxygen pressure. X-ray and neutron diffractions verify the tetragonal $I4/mmm$ structure for the post-annealed samples La$_3$Ni$_{2-x}$Al$_x$O$_{7-δ}$ (0.3 $\leq x \leq$ 0.5). The Al-doped samples, including the tetragonal ones, show semiconducting properties, carry localized magnetic moments, and exhibit spin-glass-like behaviors at low temperatures, all of which can be explained in terms of charge carrier localization. Furthermore, high-pressure resistance measurements on post-annealed samples reveal that even a low Al doping ($x$ = 0.05) suppresses superconductivity almost completely. This work gives information about the effect of nonmagnetic impurity on metallicity as well as superconductivity in bilayer nickelates, which would contribute to understanding the superconducting mechanism in RP nickelates.

This paper reports the first gas sensor based on the plastic inorganic semiconductor GaPS4, pioneering the application of plastic inorganic semiconductors in the field of gas sensing. Unlike traditional rigid sensors, this device leverages the unique layered structure and ultra-wide bandgap of GaPS4 to achieve high sensitivity and selectivity in detecting NO2. The intrinsic plastic deformability of the material enables it to conform tightly to complex curved pipelines like an "electronic bandage," completely eliminating monitoring blind spots. Nanoindentation tests reveal that its extremely low hardness (0.20 GPa) confers exceptional flexibility while maintaining stable electrical characteristics even under bent states. The device exhibits a linear response to NO2 concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 ppm at room temperature. Although the limited defects in the single-crystal material result in pA-level response currents, defect engineering offers a viable pathway for performance enhancement. This study breaks through the conventional boundaries of plastic inorganic semiconductors confined to photoelectric and thermoelectric applications, opening new avenues for their use in gas sensing and advancing gas monitoring technology toward "conformal integration."

We employ the derivative expansion of the nonperturbative renormalization group to address the phenomenon of anisotropic scale invariance and the associated functional fixed points, also known as Lifshitz points, in systems characterized by a scalar order parameter. We demonstrate the existence of the Lifshitz fixed point featuring a non-classical value of the anisotropy exponent $θ&lt;1/2$ and provide estimates for values of a set of critical exponents in the physically most relevant case of the three-dimensional uniaxial Lifshitz point $(d,m)=(3,1)$, $m$ denoting the anisotropy index. We compare our predictions with existing estimates from perturbative expansions around dimensionality $d=4+\frac{1}{2}$ as well as those from the $1/N$ expansion.

Artificial spin ice (ASI) systems exhibit fascinating phenomena, such as frustration and the formation of magnetic monopole states, and Dirac strings. However, exploring the wave phenomena in these systems is elusive due to the weak dipolar coupling that governs their interactions. In this study, we demonstrate coherent spin-wave propagation in an hybrid ASI system, which is based on a multilayered ferromagnetic thin film with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and in-plane magnetized nanoelements embedded within it. We show that this system enables spin-wave transmission over a one-micrometer distance via exchange-mediated coupling between subsystems and evanescent spin-wave tunneling through the out-of-plane magnetized parts. This system overcomes the limitations of purely dipolar interactions in standard ASIs while preserving their fundamental properties. Thus, it provides a platform for studying spin-wave phenomena in frustrated ASI systems and paves the way for exploiting them in analog signal processing with spin waves.

### Defect Bootstrap: Tight Ground State Bounds in Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking Phases

- **TL;DR**: 提出了缺陷自举框架，通过在辅助缺陷模型中嵌入系统来解决对称破缺相中自举方法边界松散的问题，显著改进了能量密度和自旋关联函数的边界估计。

The recent development of bootstrap methods based on semidefinite relaxations of positivity constraints has enabled rigorous two-sided bounds on local observables directly in the thermodynamic limit. However, these bounds inevitably become loose in symmetry broken phases, where local constraints are insufficient to capture long-range order. In this work, we identify the origin of this looseness as order parameter defects which are difficult to remove using local operators. We introduce a $\textit{defect bootstrap}$ framework that resolves this limitation by embedding the system into an auxiliary $\textit{defect model}$ equipped with ancilla degrees of freedom. This construction effectively enables local operators to remove order parameter defects, yielding tighter bounds in phases with spontaneous symmetry breaking. This approach can be applied broadly to pairwise-interacting local lattice models with discrete or continuous internal symmetries that satisfy a property we call $\textit{defect diamagnetism}$, which requires that the ground state energy does not decrease upon adding any finite number of symmetry defects. Applying the method to the transverse field Ising models in 1D and 2D, we obtain significantly improved bounds on energy densities and spin correlation functions throughout the symmetry broken phase in 1D and deep within the phase in 2D. Our results demonstrate that physically motivated constraint sets can dramatically enhance the power of bootstrap methods for quantum many-body systems.

As semiconductor technologies continue to scale down to the nanoscale, the efficient prediction of material properties becomes increasingly critical. The tight-binding (TB) method is a widely used semi-empirical approach that offers a computationally tractable alternative to Density Functional Theory (DFT) for large-scale electronic structure calculations. However, conventional TB models often suffer from limited transferability and lack standardized benchmarking protocols. In this study, we introduce a computational framework (CHIPS-TB) for evaluating and comparing tight-binding parameterizations across diverse material systems relevant to semiconductor design, focusing on properties such as electronic bandgaps, band structures, and bulk modulus. We assess model parameterizations including Density Functional Tight-Binding (DFTB)-based MatSci, PBC, PTBP, SlaKoNet and TB3PY against OptB88vdW, TBmBJ-DFT and experimental reference data from the JARVIS-DFT database for 50+ materials pertinent to semiconductor applications. The CHIPS-TB code will be made publicly available on GitHub and benchmarks will be available on JARVIS-Leaderboard.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究推广了Berg理论，通过双级数关系方法半解析和数值地求解了球形空腔内轴对称反应斑块对扩散粒子的捕获概率和反应速率，该方法收敛极快可视为精确解。

This study is due to various applications in physics, chemistry and especially in biology, where both bounded configuration domain and chemical anisotropy could play a great part. In fact we generalize the well-known Berg theory, which describes diffusion-controlled reactions occurring within a spherically symmetric absorber-cavity system. The trapping probability and the reaction rate at which a small diffusing particle is captured by an axially symmetric one reactive patch absorber inside a spherical cavity were found semi-analytically and numerically by means of the dual series relations method. This approach leads to such incredibly fast convergence, that it may rightly be referred to as exact one. The results obtained can be used to test numerical programmes that describe diffusion-controlled reactions in real physical systems for reactants with arbitrary anisotropic reactivity, which are located inside of various cavities as well as in the unbounded domains. Moreover, we managed to find a close connection between the dual series relations method and the generalized method of separation of variables.

It has been shown that in magnets possessing an inversion center in the absence of deformations, a torsion-induced Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction (tiDMI) can arise. A microscopic mechanism for this interaction is described, involving the transfer of angular momentum to the lattice upon electron reflection from the magnet's boundary. An estimate of the tiDMI constant is provided. It is demonstrated that tiDMI can lift the chiral degeneracy in helimagnets, and a way for experimentally observing this effect is proposed.

We investigate the anomalous Nernst effect in epitaxial SrRuO$_3$ thin films grown on c-cut Al$_2$O$_3$ substrates, and in a polycrystalline SrRuO$_3$ slab. Through comprehensive measurements of the transverse thermoelectric response as a function of temperature and magnetic field, we observe a pronounced Nernst signal near $T_c$ in the (111) oriented SrRuO$_3$ thin films. The strong temperature and nontrivial field dependence underscore the pivotal role of the magnetic anisotropy in tuning the Berry curvature and, consequently, the anomalous Nernst effect in SrRuO$_3$.

We report the fabrication of Cr2O3/\b{eta}-Ga2O3 heterojunction diodes using reactive magnetron sputtering of Cr2O3 on highly doped \b{eta}-Ga2O3 bulk substrates along (100), (010), (001), (110), and (011) orientation dependence of high electric field handling capability in \b{eta}-Ga2O3. Additional relative permittivity values in (110) and (011) orientations of \b{eta}-Ga2O3 were computed by using first-principles calculation methods for accurate apparent charge density (ND-NA) extraction and breakdown electric field analysis from capacitance-voltage measurements. The HJDs fabricated on n+ (110) exhibited breakdown electric fields &gt;10 MV/cm up to 12.9 MV/cm, showing the highest experimentally observed parallel-plane junction electric field among \b{eta}-Ga2O3-based junctions. Breakdown electric fields among (100), (010), (001), and (011) orientations showed distinct distribution in the range of 5.13-5.26 MV/cm, 5.10-7.05 MV/cm, 2.70-3.33 MV/cm, and 3.88-4.38 MV/cm, respectively, validating the orientational dependence of parallel-plane junction electric field at breakdown in low-symmetry monoclinic \b{eta}-Ga2O3. The parallel-plane breakdown electric fields (EBr,||) reported in this work were extracted when the device experienced catastrophic breakdown at 100 mA/cm^2 current density compliance, and should not be confused with critical electric field (Ec) as a function of drift layer doping concentration, which accounts for electric-field dependent impact ionization coefficients in Si, SiC and GaN. This study can guide the choice of crystal orientation for high performance gallium oxide-based devices that require high electric field handling capability.

We present an efficient relativistic implementation of the algebraic diagrammatic construction (ADC) theory up to third order, incorporating Cholesky decomposition (CD) and frozen natural spinor (FNS) techniques to address electronic ionization, attachment, and excitation problems in heavy-element systems. The exact two-component atomic mean-field (X2CAMF) Hamiltonian has been employed to balance accuracy with computational efficiency, and a state-specific frozen natural spinor (SS-FNS) extension has been developed to improve excited-state descriptions. The present implementation accurately reproduces canonical four-component third-order ADC results while significantly lowering computational demands. The efficiency and performance of the present implementation are demonstrated through calculations on larger systems, with the largest system successfully treated comprising more than 2600 basis functions.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种基于承诺概率的PCCANN-MACE工作流，用于发现复杂反应动力学，通过两个代表性应用展示了该方法在揭示反应机理多样性方面的能力。

As computational chemistry methods evolve, dynamic effects have been increasingly recognized to govern chemical reaction pathways in both organic and inorganic systems. Here, we introduce a committor-based workflow that integrates a path-committor-consistent artificial neural network (PCCANN) with an iteratively trained hybrid-DFT-level message passing atomic convolutional encoder (MACE) potential. Beginning with a static nudged elastic band path, PCCANN extracts a committor-consistent string to represent the reactive ensemble. We illustrate the power of this methodology through two representative applications. First, we investigate an SNAr reaction using MACE trained at hybrid DFT level with implicit solvent. The mechanism is found to be concerted, and the dynamic approach reveals a lower barrier than static treatments. Second, we apply the same protocol to the isomerization of protonated isobutanol to protonated 2-butanol, yielding a quantitatively accurate free-energy landscape. We uncover three competing channels: the established concerted mechanism and two asynchronous stepwise routes mediated by water and methyl transfer, all with comparable activation barriers. Notably, the stepwise pathways traverse metastable intermediates that, to the best of our knowledge, have not been described in prior mechanistic studies. Calculated barrier heights and intermediate stabilities are in close agreement with high-level DFT benchmarks, demonstrating the framework's accuracy. Together, these studies highlight mechanistic diversity across distinct systems and establish the synergistic PCCANN-MACE protocol as a proof-of-concept approach for committor-based discovery of complex reaction dynamics.

### Size optimization for observeing Majorana fermions

Majorana fermions (zero modes) are predicted to emerge in nanowire-superconductor heterostructures. This theoretical prediction typically relies on an oversimplified model, where both the nanowire and the superconductor are idealized as one-dimensional systems. In reality, heterostructures have finite sizes that deviate from this idealization-and as a result, smoking-gun evidence confirming the existence of these zero modes remains elusive. Here, we investigate the finite-size effects of both the nanowire and the superconductor, and optimize their sizes to ensure that only one Majorana fermion exists at each end of the heterostructure. It is discovered that the optimal transverse sizes of the nanowire are less than 100nm in width and approximately 1nm in thickness. For the superconductor layer, its optimal thickness (a key aspect of its size) must exceed its coherence length. We also present the optimal sizes of the two types of materials used in the experiment in a quantitative manner. Notably, the identified optimal thickness of the superconductor (Al films, $\sim$1000nm)--a critical size parameter--is two orders of magnitude larger than the thickness of Al films currently utilized in experimental devices (e.g., InSb-Al and InAs-Al heterostructures). Our findings could explain why Majorana fermions have not been observed in current experiments, and offer guidance for the size selection of heterostructures to implement Majorana fermions in future studies.

We performed field-angle-resolved magnetostriction and thermal-expansion measurements on PrIr$_2$Zn$_{20}$, a cubic non-Kramers compound exhibiting antiferroquadrupolar order below $T_{\rm Q}=0.125$ K. Thermal expansion exhibits two qualitatively different anomalies under magnetic fields applied along the $[001]$ direction, providing experimental support for the existence of an intermediate A phase previously reported. Furthermore, comparison between the experimental results and theoretical modeling indicates a strong anisotropic coupling of the $O_{20}$ quadrupolar moment, which plays a key role in stabilizing the A phase. These findings demonstrate that multipolar states in non-Kramers systems can be effectively tuned by magnetic-field orientation, providing insights into the anisotropic nature of quadrupolar interactions.

We report an optical pump - terahertz (THz) probe study of the photoinduced transient carrier dynamics in the low bandgap semiconductor Indium Antimonide (InSb). Using an organic N-benzyl-2-methyl-nitroaniline (BNA) crystal as a broadband THz source, we access the full spectral response over more than 5 THz, for varying pump-probe delay following the optical excitation. Using the Drude-Lorentz model accounting for differences between the excited length in material and the penetration depth of THz beam in pumped InSb, we extract the absolute carrier density as a function of the pump-probe delay, and provide insights on the diffusion length at given carrier densities, for different pump fluences. The mismatch between the THz penetration depth and the actual excited sample depth after carrier diffusion is discussed, since their evolutions with time and pump fluence are not intuitive as both quantities depend on carrier density.

- **TL;DR**: 开发了一种通过静电场调控二维半导体非线性光响应的实用方法，将外电场纳入Wannier插值哈密顿量中，用于预测层状材料中的非线性光电流。

We develop a practical approach to electrically tuning the nonlinear photoresponse of two-dimensional semiconductors by explicitly incorporating a static out-of-plane electric field into the electronic ground state prior to optical excitation, as a gate bias. The method is implemented by dressing a Wannier-interpolated Hamiltonian with the field through its position matrix elements, which allows the gate bias to modify orbital hybridization and band dispersion beyond perturbative treatments. Within the independent-particle approximation, the resulting second-order (shift) conductivity is evaluated for both centrosymmetric and non-centrosymmetric layered systems. Applied to MoS$_2$, the approach captures the emergence of a finite shift current in centrosymmetric bilayers and the tunability of intrinsic responses in polar structures. The shift conductivity rises linearly at small fields and saturates at higher intensities, reflecting the competition between the growing shift vector and the weakening interband coupling as resonant transitions move away from high-symmetry valleys. A Taylor expansion of the field-dressed conductivity connects this behavior to the third-order optical response, revealing a unified picture of field-induced nonlinearities. These results establish field dressing of Wannier Hamiltonians as a practical route to model and predict nonlinear photocurrents in layered materials.

We study relaxation spectra of a quadratic spinless--fermion helical chain with an Aubry--Andre--type quasiperiodic potential and a single N--th neighbor (helical) hopping. Dissipation and pumping are introduced via local linear Lindblad jump operators and treated exactly using the third--quantization / Majorana covariance formalism. Focusing on periodic boundary conditions (to avoid edge artefacts) we compute the Liouvillian rapidities and their smallest nonzero real part (the rapidity gap) for several spatial dissipation patterns: uniform (all), single--site (one--site) and two--site (two--site) placement, plus pairwise gain/loss on helical partner sites. We show that uniform dissipation yields large, weakly lambda--dependent gaps, while sparse local dissipation produces gaps that shrink rapidly as the quasiperiodic potential lambda induces localization. Increasing t_N enhances relaxation by improving mode overlap with dissipative channels. Finite--size scaling, rapidity level statistics (Poisson vs Wigner--Dyson), and spatial profiles of slow modes provide a consistent picture linking Liouvillian spectral structure to transport and localization. Our results highlight Liouvillian rapidities as compact, experimentally relevant diagnostics of relaxation and sensitivity in engineered open quantum lattices.

Recent advances in revealing intrinsic magnetism in two-dimensional (2D) materials have highlighted their potential for future spintronic applications, driven by their novel physical properties, promising for future spintronic devices. In order to explore layer dependent magnetic behavior, in general, mechanically exfoliated flakes from high-quality single crystals are used. It is crucial to determine the number of layers of these materials accurately. In the absence of an efficient and quick method, researchers often rely on atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging to identify their number of layers. In this work, we report an optical contrast study as a quick and cost-effective technique to determine the number of layers of Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ (FGT). Here, we observed a linear relationship between the optical contrast (derived from optical microscopic images) observed for mechanically exfoliated FGT nano-flakes and their thickness, as measured by the AFM imaging method. This technique requires no additional equipment; it relies solely on a conventional optical microscope. Additionally, our results reveal a thickness-dependent evolution of the intensity; in contrast, the Raman frequency demonstrates no significant dependence on layer thickness. Also, our studies reveal two additional Raman modes of FGT, at the frequency of 129\,cm$^-1$ \& 190\,cm$^-1$. Both modes show the intensity dependence on the thickness of FGT, same as out-of-plane (A$_{1g}$) Raman modes.

We describe the random motion of a particle immersed in a thermally fluctuating medium and harmonically trapped at a certain distance from a wall. The medium, modeled by a Gaussian field with a tunable correlation length $ξ$, is linearly coupled to the particle and evolves according to dissipative relaxational dynamics. Dirichlet boundary conditions imposed on the field at the wall give rise to a repulsive fluctuation-induced force acting on the particle, causing a shift in its average position and a renormalization of the strength of the harmonic trap. We describe the effective overdamped dynamics of the particle, which features a nonlinear memory term depending on the wall-particle separation. We show that the two-time correlation function of the particle position features a memory-induced term that depends on the distance of the particle from the wall. At the critical point, this term decays algebraically upon increasing time and it displays a crossover from the behavior observed in the bulk to that corresponding to having the particle at the wall.

Excitons, bound electron-hole pairs, are responsible for strong optical resonances near the bandgap in low-dimensional materials and wide-bandgap insulators. Although current ab initio methods can accurately determine exciton energies and eigenstates, their symmetries have been much less explored. In this work, we employ standard group-theory methods to analyse the transformation properties of excitonic states, obtained by solving the BSE, under crystal symmetry operations. We develop an approach to assign irreducible-representation labels to excitonic states, providing a state-of-the-art framework for analysing their symmetries and selection rules (including, for example, the case of exciton-phonon coupling). Complementary to the symmetry classification, we introduce the concept of total crystal angular momentum for excitons in the presence of rotational symmetries, allowing the derivation of conservation laws. Furthermore, we demonstrate how these symmetry properties can be exploited to greatly enhance the computational efficiency of exciton calculations with the BSE. We apply our methodology to three prototypical systems to understand the role of symmetries in different contexts: (i) For LiF, we present the symmetry analysis of the entire excitonic dispersion and examine the selection rules for optical absorption. (ii) In the calculation of resonant Raman spectra of monolayer MoSe2, we demonstrate how the conservation of total crystal angular momentum governs exciton-phonon interactions, leading to the observed resonant enhancement. (iii) In bulk hBN, we analyze the role of symmetries for the coupling of finite-momentum excitons to finite-momentum phonons and their manifestation in the phonon-assisted luminescence spectra. This work establishes a general and robust framework for understanding the symmetry properties of excitons in crystals, providing a foundation for future studies.

The precise role of e-ph coupling in graphene and related materials on a honeycomb lattice is not yet fully understood, despite extensive research on these systems. Here, we perform sign-problem-free determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) simulations of the optical Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (oSSH)-Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice, focusing on the parameters relevant to graphene. Performing finite-size scaling analyzes, we obtain the model's ground state phase diagram, which includes the semi-metal (SM), Kekulé Valence Bond Solid (KVBS), and anti-ferromagnetic (AFM) phases, as well as indications of a small KVBS/AFM coexistence region. We find that a weak to moderate Hubbard repulsion, tuned toward the SM-AFM critical value in the pure honeycomb Hubbard model, enhances KVBS correlations and can even stabilize the KVBS phase. Estimating the effective parameters for graphene places it in the SM region of the phase diagram, but near the SM-KVBS phase boundary. Notably, we predict that increasing either the on-site Hubbard repulsion or the e-ph coupling strength drives graphene toward the KVBS phase rather than the AFM phase, highlighting a synergistic effect that can be exploited to further control the remarkable properties of graphene and related materials.

The advancement of solid-state batteries depends on the development of lithium-ion conductors that exhibit both high ionic conductivity and stability across a wide range of electrochemical and chemical conditions. In this paper, we investigate the chemical factors that control the stability of Li-NASICONs and garnets in highly alkaline aqueous environment. While this is of general importance, it is particularly important for the operation of Li-air cells with humidified air. Humid air promotes the formation of LiOH as the discharge product, creating a highly alkaline environment on the surface of cathode and solid-state electrolyte. In this work, we combine machine learning and first-principles calculations to conduct a high-throughput computational screening of alkaline-stable oxide-based Li-ion conductors in order to better characterize the tradeoff between the various relevant properties. We evaluate the material stability in terms of pH, voltage, and species present in the environment (LiOH and H2O) across a vast range of chemical compositions with NASICON and garnet crystal structures. We utilize the CHGNet universal machine learning interatomic potential for pre-screening, followed by DFT calculations. Such a hierarchical screening procedure enables the evaluation of over 320,000 chemical compositions, encompassing nearly the entire periodic table. From this set 209 alkaline-stable NASICON and garnet compounds are selected as final candidates. We identify the specific cation substitutions that improve alkaline stability in NASICON and garnet compounds, and reveal the underlying mechanism. We also discover the trade-offs for designing alkaline-stable Li-ion conductors, highlighting the need to carefully optimize compositions so that it can simultaneously enhance all the material properties required for practical battery applications.

Thermodynamic response functions, including the isothermal compressibility, the thermal pressure coefficient, and the thermal expansion coefficient, isochoric and isobaric heat capacities are explicitly derived for a many-particle system interacting through a Curie-Weiss-type potential. These calculations are based on an exact equation of state previously obtained for a cell fluid model in the grand canonical ensemble. The resulting response functions are presented graphically as functions of temperature, density, and chemical potential within the supercritical region.

Optical memristors are innovative devices that enable the integration of electro-optical functionalities - such as light modulation, multilevel optical memory, and nonvolatile reprogramming - into neuromorphic networks. Recently, their capabilities have expanded with the development of light-emitting memristors, which operate through various emission mechanisms. One notable process involves the electroluminescence of defects generated within the switching matrix during device activation. In this study, we explore the early-stage formation and evolution of the species responsible for light emission in Ag-based in-plane memristors. Our approach combines electrical stimulation with correlated optical electroluminescence and photoluminescence measurements. The findings provide valuable insights into controlling emission processes in memristors, paving the way for their integration as essential components in neuromorphic circuits.

A generic question in the field of ultrafast dynamics is concerned with the relaxation dynamics and the subsequent thermalization of optically excited charge carriers. Among several possible relaxation channels available in a solid-state system, we focus on the coupling to magnetic excitations. In this paper, we study the real-time dynamics of a paradigmatic model, the Kondo lattice model in one dimension. We conduct a comprehensive study of the relaxation processes by evaluating the spin polarization of the conduction electron, the local spin-spin correlation between localized and conduction electrons, and the electronic momentum distribution. While in the well-studied cases of one or two charge carriers in a ferromagnetic background, no thermalization occurs, we demonstrate that the stationary state is compatible with thermalization if either the electronic filling is finite or the magnetic background is in the singlet sector. Our real-time simulations using the time-dependent Lanczos method are corroborated by a direct comparison with finite-temperature expectation values and an analysis of the spectrum in terms of the gap ratio.

It is shown by numerical simulations of muon spin relaxation ($μ$SR) spectra and analysis of these using the Kubo-Toyabe relaxation function $G_z^{\rm KT}(t)$ that the anomalous peak in the fluctuation rate $ν_{\rm KT}$ around a specific temperature $T^*$ and associated decrease of the linewidth $Δ_{\rm KT}$ above $T^*$, often observed in the previous $μ$SR studies on ion diffusion, originate from the sharp increase in the ion jump rate $ν_{\rm i}$ against that of the muon $ν_μ$ with increasing temperature. This indicates that a more detailed reanalysis of the vintage data using the "extended" Kubo-Toyabe relaxation function $G_z^{\rm EA}(t)$ incorporating the jump motion of both ions and implanted muon (which was also used to simulate the $μ$SR spectra) is useful for the proper evaluation of $ν_{\rm i}$ and $ν_μ$. Meanwhile, it also suggests that the $μ$SR results showing no such anomaly convey little information on ion diffusion.

### Giant enhancement of transport driven by active fluctuations: impact of inertia

- **TL;DR**: 惯性可以增强、减弱甚至破坏自由布朗粒子在周期性势场中的反常输运增强效应，该效应由主动波动驱动，在微观物理系统和生物系统中具有应用价值。

Recently, a paradoxical effect has been demonstrated in which transport of a free Brownian particle driven by active fluctuations in the form of white Poisson shot noise can be significantly enhanced when it is additionally subjected to a periodic potential. This phenomenon can emerge in an overdamped system, but it may also be inertia-induced. Here, we considerably extend previous studies and comprehensively investigate the impact of inertia on the effect of free transport enhancement observed in the overdamped system. We detect that inertia can not only induce this phenomenon, but depending on a parameter regime, it may also strengthen, weaken, or even destroy it. We exemplify these different scenarios and explore the parameter space to identify the corresponding regions where they emerge. The variance of the active fluctuations amplitude distribution is a key determinant of the inertia influence on the effect of free transport amplification. Our results are relevant not only for microscopic physical systems but also for biological ones, such as, e.g., living cells, where fluctuations generated by metabolic activities are active by default.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文展示了在BiFeO3多铁性薄膜中实现高效窄带太赫兹发射，通过耦合声子-极化子和超快应变波，可在0.4-0.8 THz范围内实现可调谐发射。

Collective excitations such as magnons and polar phonons provide natural access to the terahertz (THz) regime, but efficient generation and tunability remain elusive. Multiferroic BiFeO3 combines both orders at room temperature, offering a unique platform for narrowband THz emission. Here, we achieve efficient sub-bandgap optical rectification of coupled phonon-polaritons near 2 THz in bare epitaxial thin films. In Pt/BiFeO3 bilayers, we demonstrate that coupling the electromagnon branch with ultrafast strain waves, optically generated in Pt layers with various thicknesses, can produce tunable and narrowband emission between 0.4-0.8 THz. These results uncover the intertwined role of phonons, magnons, and magneto-acoustic dynamics in antiferromagnetic multiferroics, and establish these hybrid platforms as versatile engineered narrowband THz sources.

High magnetic fields provide a direct route to probe the anisotropies that govern spin dynamics in layered magnets. Using the SU(3) bond operator framework for spin 1 systems, we derive analytic expressions for the magnon spectrum and the critical fields delimiting the field induced ordered phase. We show that the upper critical field $h_{c2}$ carries a simple and quantitative fingerprint of both exchange anisotropy and single ion symmetry breaking, enabling high field experiments to serve as sensitive probes of microscopic anisotropy. We further map how these anisotropies, together with interlayer coupling, control the extent and location of the magnon Bose Einstein condensation dome. Our results provide experimentally accessible criteria for identifying symmetry breaking mechanisms in real spin 1 materials.

Ultralow glass-like lattice thermal conductivity in crystalline materials is crucial for enhancing energy conversion efficiency in thermoelectrics and thermal insulators. We introduce a universal descriptor for thermal conductivity that relies only on the atomic number in the primitive cell and the sound velocity, enabling fast and scalable materials screening. Coupled with high-throughput workflows and universal machine learning potentials, we identify the candidate materials with ultralow thermal conductivity from over 25, 000 materials. We further validate this approach by experimentally confirming record-low thermal conductivity values of 0.15-0.16 W/m/K from 170 to 400 K in the halide metal CsAg2I3. Combining inelastic neutron scattering with first-principles calculations, we attribute the ultralow thermal conductivity to the intrinsically small sound velocity, strong anharmonicity, and structural complexity. Our work illustrates how a universal descriptor, combined with high-throughput screening, machine-learning potential and experiment, enables the efficient discovery of materials with ultralow thermal conductivity.

Different analytical features of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction are related to different contribution to the Dzyaloshinskii constant in the microscopic Hamiltonian. Consequences appear in the macroscopic Landau--Lifshitz--Gilbert equation. It leads to various phenomena. Three contributions to the Dzyaloshinskii constant are reviewed and combined in the generalized Keffer form of the Dzyaloshinskii constant. Macroscopic consequences of these three mechanisms are well-known, but further possible generalizations of the Keffer form of the Dzyaloshinskii constant are suggested. Consequences for the spin evolution equations, the momentum balance equations, and polarization evolution equations are considered. Some analog of the Keffer form is suggested for the exchange integral in symmetric Heisenberg Hamiltonian demonstrating the nontrivial contribution of the ligands in this regime.

We introduce a unified framework that relates orbital and heat magnetizations to experimentally accessible excitation spectra, through thermoelectric probes and generalized sum rules. By analyzing zero-temperature transport coefficients and applying Kramers-Kronig relations, we derive spectral representations of magnetization densities from thermoelectric correlation functions. Excitation rates under thermoelectric chiral drives then naturally emerge as direct probes of these Kubo-type correlators, placing orbital and heat magnetizations on equal footing with the topological Chern number. As a direct consequence of our formalism, we introduce a hierarchical construction that organizes orbital and heat magnetizations into distinct physical contributions accessible through sum rules, and also derive real-space markers of these magnetizations. From an experimental standpoint, we propose concrete implementations of thermoelectric dichroic measurements in quantum-engineered platforms based on modulated strain fields. These results establish thermoelectric dichroic measurements as a versatile route to access and disentangle fundamental ground-state properties.

Motivated by the search for unconventional orders in frustrated quantum magnets, we present a multi-method investigation into the nature of the quantum phase diagram of the spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg model on the maple-leaf lattice with three symmetry-inequivalent nearest-neighbor interactions. It has been argued that the parameter regime with antiferromagnetic couplings on hexagons $J_h$ and ferromagnetic couplings on triangles $J_t$ and dimer $J_d$ bonds, is potentially host to a cornucopia of emergent phases with unconventional orders. Our analysis indeed identifies an extended region where any conventional dipolar magnetic order is absent. A hexagonal singlet state is found in the region around $J_{d}=J_{t}=0$, while a dimerized hexagonal singlet order of a lattice nematic character appears proximate to the phase boundary with the c$120^\circ$ antiferromagnetic order. Interestingly, upon traversing the bulk of the paramagnetic (PM) region, we find a variety of distinct correlation profiles, which are qualitatively different from those of the hexagonal singlet and dimerized hexagonal singlet orders but feature no appreciable spin-nematic response, while the boundary with the ferromagnetic phase shows evidence of spin-nematic order. This PM region is thus likely host to an ensemble of nonmagnetic phases which could putatively include quantum spin liquids. Our phase diagram is built from a complementary application of state-of-the-art implementations of the cluster mean-field and pseudo-fermion functional renormalization group approaches, together with an unconstrained Luttinger-Tisza treatment of the model providing insights from the semi-classical limit.

Thermoelectrics (TEs) are promising candidates for energy harvesting with performance quantified by figure of merit, $ZT$. To accelerate the discovery of high-$ZT$ materials, efforts have focused on identifying compounds with low thermal conductivity $κ$. Using a curated dataset of 71,913 entries, we show that high-$ZT$ materials reside not only in the low-$κ$ regime but also cluster near a lattice-to-total thermal conductivity ratio ($κ_\mathrm{L}/κ$) of approximately 0.5, consistent with the phonon-glass electron-crystal design concept. Building on this insight, we construct a framework consisting of two machine learning models for the lattice and electronic components of thermal conductivity that jointly provide both $κ$ and $κ_\mathrm{L}/κ$ for screening and guiding the optimization of TE materials. Among 104,567 compounds screened, our models identify 2,522 ultralow-$κ$ candidates. Follow-up case studies demonstrate that this framework can reliably provide optimization strategies by suggesting new dopants and alloys that shift pristine materials toward the $κ_\mathrm{L}/κ$ approaching 0.5 regime. Ultimately, by integrating rapid screening with PGEC-guided optimization, our data-driven framework effectively bridges the critical gap between materials discovery and performance enhancement.

We review the theoretical modelling of moiré materials, focusing on various aspects of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MA-TBG) viewed through the lens of Hartree-Fock mean-field theory. We first provide an elementary introduction to the continuum modelling of moiré bandstructures, and explain how interactions are incorporated to study correlated states. We then discuss how to implement mean-field simulations of ground state structure and collective excitations in this setting. With this background established, we rationalize the power of mean-field approximations in MA-TBG, by discussing the idealized "chiral-flat" strong-coupling limit, in which ground states at electron densities commensurate with the moiré superlattice are exactly captured by mean-field ansätze. We then illustrate the phenomenological shortcomings of this limit, leading us naturally into a discussion of the intermediate-coupling incommensurate Kekulé spiral (IKS) order and its origins in ever-present heterostrain. IKS and its placement within an expanded Hartree-Fock manifold form our first "case study". Our second case study involves time-dependence, and focuses on the collective modes of various broken-symmetry insulators in MA-TBG. As a third and final case study, we return to the strong-coupling picture, which can be stabilized by aligning MA-TBG to an hBN substrate. In this limit, we show how mean field theory can be adapted to the translationally non-invariant setting in order to quantitatively study the energetics of domain walls in orbital Chern insulating states. We close with a discussion of extensions and further applications. Used either as a standalone reference or alongside the accompanying open-source code, this review should enable readers with a basic knowledge of band theory and many-body physics to systematically build and analyze detailed models of generic moiré systems.

The power and energy consumption of resistive switching devices can be lowered by reducing their active layer dimensions. Efforts to push this low-energy switching property to its limits have led to the investigation of active regions made with two-dimensional layered materials (2DLM). Despite their small dimensions, 2DLM exhibit a rich variety of switching mechanisms, each involving different types of atomic structure reconfigurations. In this review, we highlight and classify the mechanisms of resistive switching in mono and bulk 2DLM, with a subsequent focus on those occurring in a monolayer and/or localized to point defects in the crystalline sheet. We discuss the complex energetics involved in these fundamentally defect-assisted processes, including the co-existence of multiple mechanisms and influence of the contacts used. Examining the highly localized 'atomristor'-type switching, we provide insights into the atomic motions and electronic transport across the metal-2D interfaces underlying their operation. Finally, we present the progress and our perspective on the challenges associated with the development of 2D resistive switching devices. Promising application areas and material systems are identified and suggested for further research.

- **TL;DR**: 本文确定了α-FASnI3可靠建模的结构和电子要求，包括需要4×4×4超胞去除宏观偶极子、PBE0杂化泛函与自旋轨道耦合处理Sn相对论效应、以及非局域色散校正。

Alpha-Formamidinium-tin-iodide (alpha-FASnI3) is a leading candidate for lead-free photovoltaic applications, adopting a nearly cubic structure at room temperature, but its stability remains limited by oxidation-driven degradation. Reliable first-principles modelling of the photovoltaic alpha-phase is further complicated by inconsistent structural models and levels of theory in the literature. Here, we identify the structural and electronic requirements needed for a physically sound description of alpha-FASnI3, whose behaviour is governed by a pseudo-Jahn-Teller (PJT) instability arising from the stereochemically active Sn(II) lone pair.
  Using 0 K relaxations, cross-code hybrid-functional benchmarks, and finite-temperature ab initio molecular dynamics, we show that a 4x4x4 supercell with randomly oriented FA+ cations is the smallest model that removes macroscopic dipoles, preserves cubic symmetry, recovers local octahedral tilts, and captures the characteristic PJT-driven Sn off-centering. Accurate band edges and a reliable band gap require a PBE0-level hybrid functional with spin-orbit coupling to treat Sn relativistic effects, together with nonlocal dispersion (rVV10) to capture the enhanced Sn-I covalency. Finite-temperature simulations reveal that Sn off-centering remains local, &lt;111&gt;-oriented, and robust against thermal fluctuations, and that reproducing the experimental 300 K band gap requires a 6x6x6 supercell. These results define the essential ingredients for reliable modelling of alpha-FASnI3 and provide a rigorous foundation for studying lone-pair-driven physics in tin halide perovskites.

- **TL;DR**: 使用主动学习框架结合贝叶斯优化策略，寻找具有焦绿石结构的高熵/多组分稀土氧化物热障涂层材料，通过两轮迭代成功识别出低热导率单相材料。

High-Entropy/multicomponent rare-earth oxides (HECs and MCCs) show promise as alternative materials for thermal barrier coatings (TBC) with the ability to tailor properties based on the combination of rare-earth elements present. By enabling the substitution of scarce or supply-risk rare-earths with more readily available alternatives while maintaining comparable material performance, HECs and MCCs offer a valuable path towards alternative TBC material design. However, navigating this search space of compositionally complex materials is both time and resource intensive. In this study, an active learning (AL) framework was employed to identify HEC/MCC materials with a pyrochlore structure, with acceptable thermal conductivity (TC) for TBC applications. The AL framework was applied through a Bayesian optimisation (BO) strategy, coupled with a random forest surrogate model. TC was selected as the optimisation criterion as that is the most basic requirement of TBC materials. Over two iterations of the AL cycle, four compositions were generated and synthesized in the lab for experimental evaluation. The first iteration yielded two single-phase pyrochlores, $(La_{0.29}Nd_{0.36}Gd_{0.36})_2Zr_2O_7$ and $(La_{0.333}Nd_{0.26}Gd_{0.15}Ho_{0.15}Yb_{0.111})_2Zr_2O_7$, with measured thermal conductivities of 2.03 and 1.90 $W/mK$, respectively. The surrogate model predicted a TC of 2.009 $W/mK$ for both compositions, demonstrating it's accuracy for completely new compositions. The second iteration compositions showed dual-phase when synthesized, highlighting the need to take into account phase formation in the AL framework.

- **TL;DR**: CrystaLLM-π是一个条件自回归框架，通过将连续属性表示直接集成到transformer注意力机制中，实现材料逆向设计，避免离散标记化问题并保留预训练知识。

Generative models have recently shown great promise for accelerating the design and discovery of new functional materials. Conditional generation enhances this capacity by allowing inverse design, where specific desired properties can be requested during the generation process. However, conditioning of transformer-based approaches, in particular, is constrained by discrete tokenisation schemes and the risk of catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning. This work introduces CrystaLLM-π (property injection), a conditional autoregressive framework that integrates continuous property representations directly into the transformer's attention mechanism. Two architectures, Property-Key-Value (PKV) Prefix attention and PKV Residual attention, are presented. These methods bypass inefficient sequence-level tokenisation and preserve foundational knowledge from unsupervised pre-training on Crystallographic Information Files (CIFs) as textual input. We establish the efficacy of these mechanisms through systematic robustness studies and evaluate the framework's versatility across two distinct tasks. First, for structure recovery, the model processes high-dimensional, heterogeneous X-ray diffraction patterns, achieving structural accuracy competitive with specialised models and demonstrating applications to experimental structure recovery and polymorph differentiation. Second, for materials discovery, the model is fine-tuned on a specialised photovoltaic dataset to generate novel, stable candidates validated by Density Functional Theory (DFT). It implicitly learns to target optimal band gap regions for high photovoltaic efficiency, demonstrating a capability to map complex structure-property relationships. CrystaLLM-π provides a unified, flexible, and computationally efficient framework for inverse materials design.

- **TL;DR**: 在Kagome反铁磁体FeGe中观测到显著的横向热电导率和反常能斯特效应，这些效应归因于非共线自旋结构产生的大贝里曲率，表明其在热电应用中的潜力。

Topological Kagome magnets, characterized by nontrivial electronic band structures featuring flat band, Dirac cone and van Hove singularities, provide a new avenue for the realization of thermoelectric devices. Unlike the conventional longitudinal Seebeck effect, transverse thermoelectric (TE) effects like the Nernst effect have attracted growing interest due to their unique transverse geometry and potential advantages. Here, we report the observation of a significant transverse thermoelectric conductivity alpha A_zx of 15 A K-1m-1 at low temperatures, together with a pronounced anomalous Nernst effect in the Kagome antiferromagnet FeGe, which exhibits a charge density wave inside the antiferromagnetic (AFM) state. This value is the highest record among known AFM materials. Furthermore, the thermopower at 14 T increases by 102-104% around the canted-AFM (CAFM) transition temperature, Tcant, comparable to that of the well-known AFM thermoelectric materials. These effects are attributed to large Berry curvature arising from the non-collinear spin texture in FeGe, highlighting its potential for enhancing thermoelectric performance and its candidacy for magneto-TE applications in Kagome antiferromagnetic materials.

Fast ionic conduction is a defining property of solid electrolytes for all-solid-state batteries. Previous studies have suggested that liquid-like cation motion associated with fast ionic transport can disrupt crystalline symmetry, thereby lifting Raman selection rules. Here, we exploit the resulting low-frequency, diffusive Raman scattering as a spectral signature of fast ionic conduction and develop a machine learning-accelerated computational pipeline to identify promising solid electrolytes based on this feature. By overcoming the steep computational barriers to calculating Raman spectra of strongly disordered materials at finite temperatures, we achieve near-ab initio accuracy and demonstrate the predictive power of our approach for sodium-ion conductors, revealing clear Raman signatures of liquid-like ion conduction. This work highlights how machine learning can bridge atomistic simulations and experimental observables, enabling data-efficient discovery of fast-ion conductors.

Large perovskite crystals with reduced defect density enable superior charge transport and stability. Therefore, controlling their nucleation and growth is key to advancing high-performance optoelectronic devices based on perovskite semiconductors. Millimeter-scale perovskite crystals can be synthesized as a continuous film through methylamine treatment, with nucleation sites directed by pre-patterned seeds. Nonetheless, certain configurations may lead to unwanted parasitic nucleation. To predict and mitigate this effect, we employ phase-field simulations alongside an analytical model. Their predictive capability is demonstrated across three distinct material-substrate systems, enabling precise control over nucleation and subsequent crystal growth. Notably, the only material-specific input required is the nucleation density (i.e., the number of crystals nucleated per unit area on an unpatterned substrate). This generality makes the models broadly applicable to diverse material systems for achieving controlled two-dimensional crystallization for improved optoelectronic device performance.

### Lattice-Distortion-Mediated Proton Pairing and Trapping in Solid State Oxides

Experiments have evidenced proton pairing in Y-doped BaZrO3. However, the nature of proton pairing and its impact on conduction remain insufficiently understood theoretically. Here, through quantitative computational analysis of proton-proton interactions in Y-doped BaZrO3, we identify lattice-distortion-mediated elastic interaction as the key factor determining whether two protons form a stable pair or exhibit net repulsion. When a proton resides at an inward-bending distortion site induced by another proton, the resulting net repulsive interaction leads to an unstable configuration. In contrast, the proton tends to be trapped at a nearby outward-bending site that favors the formation of a stable proton pair. Moreover, the site where the two protons form the lowest-energy configuration also corresponds to a proton trapping site. By calculating the long-range diffusion pathways accessible to protons under different local environments in both single- and two-proton cases, we find that the range of rate-limiting barriers is 0.24-0.45 eV for two-proton conduction and 0.19-0.39 eV for single-proton conduction. The higher and more experimentally consistent barriers in the two-proton pathways indicate that the proton trapping effect induced by pairing hinders proton conduction. Our study elucidates the multi-proton diffusion mechanism, providing a theoretical foundation for the experimental design of electrolytes with enhanced proton conductivity.

- **TL;DR**: 开发了一种基于tabGAP形式的α-Fe-H系统机器学习原子间势能，用于研究氢脆现象，在保持DFT精度水平的同时计算成本与经典EAM势能相当。

In this work, we present a machine-learned interatomic potential for the $α$-Fe-H system based on the tabulated Gaussian Approximation Potential (tabGAP) formalism. Trained on a Density Functional Theory (DFT) dataset of atomic configurations, energies, forces, and virials, the potential is designed to address the issue of H-induced acceleration of mechanical failure of metals, generally known as hydrogen embrittlement (HE). The proposed potential is shown to outperform the widely used classical and machine-learned interatomic potentials in fundamental properties of the $α$-Fe-H system. We show that the tabGAP model reproduces H-point defect properties, H-dislocation interaction, H-H interaction, and elastic constants with nearly DFT-level accuracy at a computational cost that is competitive with the efficient classical Embedded Atom Method (EAM) potentials. We further demonstrate the utility of the tabGAP model in molecular dynamics simulations of tensile tests of a perfect, and a $(111)[11\bar{2}]$-notched $α$-Fe structure with and without the load of H atoms. The simulations show evidence of HE via observation of accelerated decohesion of Fe atoms at the tip of the notch, and an increase in vacancy concentration driven by H-dislocation interactions. Hence, the results of the presented simulations support the hypotheses of hydrogen-enhanced decohesion (HEDE) alongside hydrogen-enhanced strain induced vacancies (HESIV) as important mechanisms for H-induced mechanical failure of iron systems.
