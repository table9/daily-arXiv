- **TL;DR**: 该论文在Eu掺杂无限层镍酸盐中发现了高温超导与磁场重入超导的量子竞争，通过化学方法成功生长了含不同稀土元素的镍酸盐，揭示了4f轨道相关的量子临界性。

Recently, a preliminary magnetic field-reentrant superconductivity manifested in high critical-temperature (Tc) Eu-doped infinite-layer (IL) nickelates, beyond analogous discoveries exclusively in low-Tc systems. This arises more intriguing fundamental issues about potential quantum-phase boundary and criticality between unconventional superconductivity and field-reentrant-one, which are inexplicable owing to formidable challenges in growing IL-nickelates towards later-series rare-earths. Herein, we demonstrate the 4f-orbital related quantum rivalries between high-Tc and reentrant superconductivity in (Nd1-yRE'y)1-xEuxNiO2 (RE': Pr, Nd, Sm, Gd and Dy) system, via opening up the chemical avenue for a quantum leap in their growths. Robust magnetic field-reentrant superconductivity with uniaxial anisotropy is validated to fringe at boundary of the superconducting dome with optimal-Tc near 40 K. Reinforced reentry is realized via introducing Gd3+ with half-filled deeper 4f-orbital energy-states, compared to Eu2+, that strengthens on-site magnetic-moment. Our findings largely enrich the superconducting phase-diagram for nickelates, establishing an ideal platform for studying 4f-related unconventional superconductivity and quantum criticality.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究通过实验和理论方法揭示了电子化合物La3In中填隙阴离子电子(IAEs)的双重性质及其在超导配对中的关键作用，解决了长期存在的IAEs电子性质模糊问题。

The discovery of superconducting electrides, characterized by interstitial anionic electrons (IAEs) residing in lattice cavities, has established a distinctive platform for investigating superconductors. Yet the superconducting origin and the fundamental role of IAEs in Cooper pairing formation remain poorly understood due to the challenges in directly observing IAEs. Here, combining angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), transport measurements, and first-principles calculations, we certify that the IAEs in electride La3In (Tc = 9.4 K) exhibit a dual nature as both anions and free electrons. With the finite-depth potential well model, we trace that IAEs originate from electronic states near the Fermi level located above potential barriers, forming a Fermi sea susceptible to scattering by La-derived phonons, triggering superconductivity. ARPES combined with high-resolution XRD measurements on oxygen-treated samples directly reveals IAEs' spatial distribution and energy dispersion from interstitial sites with the consistent energy value predicted by our theory model. The concomitant diminution of free electrons upon oxygen treatment, leading to a marked reduction in superconductivity, further provides compelling experimental evidence that IAEs actively participate in electron-phonon coupling. Our findings resolve the long-standing ambiguity regarding the electronic nature of IAEs, elucidate their enhancing superconductivity in the phonon-mediated mechanism, and provide a foundation for exploring advanced electride-based superconductors.

- **TL;DR**: 首次直接可视化NbTi块体超导体中的磁通雪崩传播动力学，发现其速度比薄膜慢3-4个数量级，由热传导而非电磁效应主导，揭示了新的热限制传播机制。

We report the first direct visualization of flux avalanche propagation dynamics in bulk superconducting NbTi, tracking individual events and measuring their velocities using high-speed magneto-optical imaging. Unlike thin films with electromagnetic avalanches at km/s speeds, we observe velocities of 15--25 m/s, which are orders of magnitude slower. Analysis of characteristic timescales reveals that these avalanches are governed by local heating and limited heat dissipation through the adhesive layer, establishing a fundamentally different, thermally limited propagation regime. The threshold field for avalanche nucleation decreases with temperature, contrary to the increasing trend in thin films with efficient cooling - a behavior consistent with slow heat removal and thermal runaway in our system. All observed avalanches exhibit universal normalized velocity-distance scaling despite varying morphologies, confirming the robustness of thermal control. These findings reveal that bulk superconductors with poor thermal coupling operate in a previously uncharacterized avalanche regime, with direct implications for flux stability and quench protection in NbTi-based magnets, as well as a broader understanding of thermomagnetic instabilities in technological superconductors.

We study the Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the maple-leaf lattice using several numerical approaches, focusing on the numerical linked-cluster expansion (NLCE), which exhibits an unconventional convergence extending to low and even zero temperatures. We evaluate thermodynamic properties as well as spin-spin correlations through the equal-time structure factor. Within NLCE the specific heat capacity reveals a two-peak structure at $T_1 \approx 0.479\,J$ and $T_2 \approx 0.131\,J$, reminiscent of the corresponding result for the triangular lattice. At intermediate temperatures, the spin-spin structure factor develops features that reflect the absence of reflection symmetry in the lattice. The zero-temperature convergence of NLCE enables reliable estimates of the ground-state energy and points to a short-range correlated paramagnetic ground state composed of resonating hexagonal motifs. The NLCE results are benchmarked against Pseudo-Majorana Functional Renormalization Group, finite-temperature Lanczos, and classical Monte Carlo simulations.

- **TL;DR**: 开发并评估了四种机器学习原子间势能模型（ACE、MACE、GAP、tabGAP）用于YBCO高温超导材料，这些模型基于DFT数据库训练，能够准确模拟辐射损伤过程，为大规模分子动力学模拟提供基础。

High-Temperature Superconductors (HTS) such as YBa2Cu3O7-delta (YBCO) are essential for next-generation Tokamak fusion reactors, where Rare-Earth Barium Copper Oxides (REBCO) form the functional layers in HTS magnets. Because YBCO's superconductivity depends strongly on oxygen stoichiometry and defect structure, atomistic simulations can provide crucial insight into radiation-damage mechanisms and pathways to maintain material performance.
  In this work, we develop and benchmark four Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials (MLPs) for YBCO: the Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE), the Message-Passing Atomic Cluster Expansion (MACE), the Gaussian Approximation Potential (GAP), and the Tabulated Gaussian Approximation Potential (tabGAP), trained on an extensive Density Functional Theory (DFT) database explicitly designed to include irradiation-damaged-like configurations. The resulting models achieve DFT-level accuracy across a wide range of atomic environments, faithfully capturing the interatomic forces relevant to radiation damage processes.
  Among the tested models, MACE delivers the highest accuracy, although at greater computational cost, while ACE and tabGAP provide an excellent balance between efficiency and fidelity. These machine-learned potentials establish a robust foundation for large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of radiation-induced defect evolution in complex superconducting materials

- **TL;DR**: 具有精确U(1)高阶对称性的二维格点系统必然表现出希尔伯特空间碎片化，导致指数级数量的Krylov子空间，破坏了量子热化。

We argue that the presence of \emph{any} exact $U(1)$ higher-form symmetry, under mild assumptions, presents a fundamental obstruction to ergodicity under unitary dynamics in lattice systems with local interactions and finite on-site Hilbert space dimension. Focusing on the two-dimensional case, we show that such systems necessarily exhibit Hilbert space fragmentation and explicitly construct Krylov sectors whose number scales exponentially with system size. While these sectors cannot be distinguished by symmetry quantum numbers, we identify the emergent integrals of motion which characterize them. Our symmetry-based approach is insensitive to details of the Hamiltonian and the lattice, providing a systematic explanation for ergodicity-breaking in a range of systems, including quantum link models.

### Shaping Causality: Emergence of Nonlocal Light Cones in Long-Range Quantum Systems

- **TL;DR**: 长程相互作用系统中信息传播的非局域性与局域性可控性研究

While for non-relativistic short-range interactions, the spread of information is local, remaining confined in an effective light cone, long-range interactions can generate either nonlocal (faster-than-ballistic) or local (ballistic) spread of correlations depending on the initial conditions. This makes long-range interactions a rich platform for controlling the spread of information. Here, we derive an effective Hamiltonian analytically and identify the specific interaction term that drives nonlocality in a wide class of long-range spin chains. This allows us to understand the conditions for the emergence of local behavior in the presence of nonlocal interactions and to identify a regime where the causal space-time landscape can be precisely designed. Indeed, we show that for large long-range interaction strength or large system size, initial conditions can be chosen in a way that allows a local perturbation to generate nonlocal signals at programmable distant positions, which then propagate within effective light cones. The possibility of engineering the emergence of nonlocal Lieb-Robinson-like light cones allows one to shape the causal landscape of long-range interacting systems, with direct applications to quantum information processing devices, quantum memories, error correction, and information transport in programmable quantum simulators.

### Exceptional points and spectral cusps from density-wave fluctuation

- **TL;DR**: 论文报告了电荷/自旋密度波形成过程中涨落引起的两类奇点：异常点（高阶极点）和谱尖点（三极值合并），两者均可通过光电子能谱观测。

We report two types of singularities that arise from fluctuations during the formation of charge- or spin-density waves. The first is the exceptional point (EP), corresponding to a higher-order pole of the retarded Green's function. Such EPs lead to algebraic corrections in the decay of quasiparticle occupations and are observable through time-resolved angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (Tr-ARPES). The second is a spectral cusp, defined by the coalescence of three extrema in the real-frequency spectral function $A(\mathbf{k}, ω)$. This cusp enforces the formation of Fermi arcs and induces a "threading" structure in the nearby band structure, both of which are directly observable in ARPES.

- **TL;DR**: IRSSG是一个用于研究自旋空间群磁系统的开源软件包，基于密度泛函理论框架，可识别自旋空间群操作、生成特征表并为磁能带分配不可约表示标签。

We present an open-source software package IRSSG for investigating magnetic systems with spin space groups (SSGs). The package works within the density functional theory (DFT) framework and requires wavefunctions from DFT codes, such as VASP, Quantum ESPRESSO, as well as any other code that has an interface to Wannier90. We introduce a set of compact SSG international symbols by combining non-crystallographic point groups with the 230 crystallographic space groups. The program first identifies all SSG operations and determines the SSG international symbol for a given magnetic system. It then generates the SSG character tables of little groups at any $k$ point. Finally, it computes the traces of matrix presentations of SSG operations and assigns irreducible corepresentation labels to magnetic energy bands. The program is not only timely but also essential for advancing research on the study of magnons, altermagnetism, magnetic topology, and novel high-degeneracy excitations in SSG systems.

- **TL;DR**: 提出一种非线性泊松-玻尔兹曼方程的自动优化求解方法，通过耦合有限元/边界元方案和自适应松弛参数，实现快速收敛，无需人工干预

The Poisson-Boltzmann equation is widely used to model molecular electrostatics; however, it is usually solved in linearised form because the sinh nonlinearity is challenging, limiting its applicability in highly charged systems such as nucleic acids. This work presents a solution method for the nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann equation based on a coupled finite/boundary element scheme that automatically finds an optimal relaxation parameter, ensuring fast and reliable convergence of the nonlinear solver without user intervention. We validated our solver against APBS for a spherical cavity, and used RNA-based structures to perform a thorough study of the different algorithmic choices, and to test our implementation. We found that the best alternative to solve the Poisson-Boltzmann equation was using a Newton-Raphson method where the nonlinearity was gradually introduced with a cubic approximation in the first iteration. Newton-Raphson was also the best method to find the optimal relaxation factor, reducing the number of iterations by 40%. Including other optimisation techniques, we were able to obtain a 1.37x speed-up with respect to the best hand-picked relaxation factor for 1HC8 (molecule with highest charge in our tests), avoiding any trial-and-error process to find the relaxation factor.

- **TL;DR**: 金属自由苯并卟啉可作为三态分子开关，电场可调控其互变异构体分布，不同异构体具有独特的输运特征，融合后可实现多态分子寄存器功能。

The capacity of many metal-free porphyrins (MFPs) to exhibit different H-bonded tautomers provides a platform for exploring the effects of reversible molecular changes on electronic transport. On-surface and molecular junction experiments have shown that tautomerism in single MFPs can be controlled by the magnitude of the current passing through them. Such conductance-based results confirm the potential for tautomeric switching but are not easily translated into device applications, where faster electric-field-gated switching is generally preferred. Previous work has focused on highly symmetric MFPs with four identical pyrrole rings, in which tautomers correspond to different H-N configurations of two protons. Here, we consider a synthesized metal-free benziporphyrin in which one pyrrole ring is replaced by a phenol moiety. This modification lowers the symmetry and increases the tautomer-dependence of the electronic state. The structural anisotropy of benziporphyrins also enhances their selective response to applied E-fields. Here, we use density functional theory and quantum electron-transport calculations to assess: (i) the statistical distribution of three distinct benziporphyrin tautomers under different applied E-fields, and (ii) the transport characteristics of each tautomer. We find that moderate E-fields can influence the tautomerism and that each tautomer exhibits distinct transport signatures, confirming that single metal-free benziporphyrins have potential to act as three-state molecular switches. By fusing two benziporphyrins, we show that the larger manifold of tautomeric states retains distinct transport signatures, opening the way to multistate molecular registers. Finally, we show that fused benziporphyrins can also act as molecular wires with enhanced conductance relative to a single unit.

### Correlations between superconducting and resistive anisotropies

There are multiple possible origins of transport anisotropies in metals and superconductors. For instance, rotational symmetry can be spontaneously broken in the normal state as a result of electronic nematic order inducing anisotropies in an otherwise $s$-wave superconducting phase. Another possibility is that the dominant source of rotational symmetry breaking is the superconductor itself and its vestiges that may survive in the normal state. We here theoretically analyze the correlations of transport anisotropies in the normal and the corresponding superconducting phase for different scenarios of broken symmetry, either coming solely from the normal state, solely from the superconductor and its vestiges in the metallic regimes, or from both simultaneously. We further include both zero-momentum and finite-momentum pairing; we develop a theory of vestigial order for the latter, characterized by broken rotational and translational symmetry. Our findings reveal that the relative transport anisotropies in the normal and superconducting phases sensitively depend on the scenario, including the form of vestigial order and, in some cases, the parity of the superconducting order parameter. As such, measuring the directional dependence of the critical current and resistivity can provide strong constraints on the origin of rotational symmetry breaking. We demonstrate our findings in minimal models relevant to twisted multilayer graphene, rhombohedral graphene, and twisted transition metal dichalcogenides.

### Pervasive electronic nematicity as the parent state of kagome superconductors

- **TL;DR**: Kagome超导体CsV₃Sb₅中，通过化学掺杂抑制电荷密度波后，发现电子结构旋转对称性破缺依然存在，表明电子向列性是这类材料的本征性质，而非电荷密度波的简单结果。

Kagome superconductors $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A$ = Cs, K, Rb) have developed into an exciting playground for realizing and exploring exotic solid state phenomena. Abundant experimental evidence suggests that electronic structure breaks rotational symmetry of the lattice, but whether this may be a simple consequence of the symmetry of the underlying 2 $\times$ 2 charge density wave phase or an entirely different mechanism remains intensely debated. We use spectroscopic imaging scanning tunneling microscopy to explore the phase diagram of the prototypical kagome superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ as a function of doping. We intentionally suppress the charge density wave phase with chemical substitutions selectively introduced at two distinct lattice sites, and investigate the resulting system. We discover that rotational symmetry breaking of the electronic structure -- now present in short-range nanoscale regions -- persists in all samples, in a wide doping range long after all charge density waves have been suppressed. As such, our experiments uncover ubiquitous electronic nematicity across the $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ phase diagram, unrelated to the 2 $\times$ 2 charge density wave. This further points towards electronic nematicity as the intrinsic nature of the parent state of kagome superconductors, under which other exotic low-temperature phenomena subsequently emerge.

We present a method of estimating the rate of entropy production in underdamped dynamics by decomposing it into contributions originating in different non-equilibrium effects. Specifically, a non-zero average velocity, a non-thermal width of the velocity distribution, correlations between position and velocity and non-Gaussian velocity statistics represent different ways in which the system can be out of equilibrium and each give rise to a positive contribution to the overall entropy production rate. We demonstrate that each contribution can be separately estimated from experimental trajectory data of levitated nano-particles subject to non-linear forces. We find that the majority of the entropy production rate can be attributed to the first three contributions which can be estimated from the first and second moments of the position and velocity and therefore result in a useful \enquote{Gaussian} estimate for the entropy production rate.

### Quantum Wigner solid in two-dimensional electron systems in semiconductors

We review recent transport experiments that reveal two-threshold voltage-current characteristics, marked by a significant increase in noise between the two threshold voltages, at low electron densities in the insulating regime in two-dimensional (2D) electron systems, specifically in silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) and SiGe/Si/SiGe heterostructures. The double-threshold voltage-current characteristics closely resemble those observed in the collective depinning of the vortex lattice in type-II superconductors. By adapting the model used for vortices to the case of an electron solid, good agreement with the experimental results is achieved, which supports a quantum electron solid forming in the low electron density state. When a perpendicular magnetic field is applied, the double-threshold behavior occurs at voltages an order of magnitude lower and at significantly higher electron densities than the zero-field case. This indicates the stabilization of the quantum electron solid, aligning with theoretical predictions. Interestingly, the double-threshold voltage-current curves, indicative of electron solid formation at low densities, are not observed in the quantum Hall regime. This lack of observation does not confirm the existence of a quasi-particle quantum Hall Wigner solid and indicates that quasi-particles near integer filling do not form an independent subsystem.

### Effect of Magneto-Mechanical Synergism in the Process-Structure Correlation in Fe-C Alloys: A Phase-Field Modeling Approach

Applied magnetic fields can alter phase equilibria and kinetics in steels; however, quantitatively resolving how magnetic, chemical, and elastic driving forces jointly influence the microstructure remains challenging. We develop a quantitative magneto-mechanically coupled phase-field model for the Fe-C system that couples a CALPHAD-based chemical free energy with demagnetization-field magnetostatics and microelasticity. The model reproduces single- and multi-particle evolution during the alpha to gamma inverse transformation at 1023 K under external fields up to 20 T, including ellipsoidal morphologies observed experimentally at 8 T. Chemically driven growth is isotropic; a magnetic interaction introduces an anisotropic driving force that elongates gamma precipitates along the field into ellipsoids, while elastic coherency promotes faceting, yielding elongated cuboidal or ``brick-like" particles under combined magneto-elastic coupling. Growth kinetics increase with C content, and decrease with field strength and misfit strain. Multi-particle simulations reveal dipolar interaction-mediated coalescence for field-parallel neighbors and ripening for field-perpendicular neighbors. Incorporating field-dependent diffusivity from experiment slows kinetics as expected; a first-principles-motivated anisotropic diffusivity correction is estimated to be small (&lt;2%). These results establish a process-structure link for magnetically assisted heat treatments of Fe-C alloys and provide guidance for microstructure control via chemo-magneto-mechanical synergism.

The auto differentiable simulation is a type of simulation that outputs of the simulation include not only the simulation result itself, but also their derivatives with respect to various input parameters. It provides an efficient method to study sensitivity of the simulation results with respect to the input parameters. Furthermore, it can be used in gradient based optimization methods for rapidly optimizing design parameters. In this paper, we present the development of a fast and transparent auto-differentiation module/class designed for easy integration into numerous simulation codes. As an application, this auto-differentiation module is integrated into a parallel particle-in-cell code with message passing interface (MPI) on distributed memory computers.

The discovery of next-generation photoinitiators for two-photon polymerization (TPP) is hindered by the absence of large, open datasets containing the quantum-chemical and photophysical properties required to model photodissociation and excited-state behavior. Existing molecular datasets typically provide only basic physicochemical descriptors and therefore cannot support data-driven screening or AI-assisted design of photoinitiators. To address this gap, we introduce QuantumChem-200K, a large-scale dataset of over 200,000 organic molecules annotated with eleven quantum-chemical properties, including two-photon absorption (TPA) cross sections, TPA spectral ranges, singlet-triplet intersystem crossing (ISC) energies, toxicity and synthetic accessibility scores, hydrophilicity, solubility, boiling point, molecular weight, and aromaticity. These values are computed using a hybrid workflow that integrates density function theory (DFT), semi-empirical excited-state methods, atomistic quantum solvers, and neural-network predictors. Using QuantumChem-200K, we fine tune the open-source Qwen2.5-32B large language model to create a chemistry AI assistant capable of forward property prediction from SMILES. Benchmarking on 3000 unseen molecules from VQM24 and ZINC20 demonstrates that domain-specific fine-tuning significantly improves accuracy over GPT-4o, Llama-3.1-70B, and the base Qwen2.5-32B model, particularly for TPA and ISC predictions central to photoinitiator design. QuantumChem-200K and the corresponding AI assistant together provide the first scalable platform for high-throughput, LLM-driven photoinitiator screening and accelerated discovery of photosensitive materials.

- **TL;DR**: La3In是一种在常压下具有超导性（TC~9.4K）的电子化物，通过ARPES和第一性原理计算揭示了其低能电子结构，包括鞍点、三维van Hove奇点和拓扑狄拉克表面态，为调控超导性和探索拓扑超导相提供了平台。

Superconducting electrides have attracted growing attention for their potential to achieve high superconducting transition temperatures (TC) under pressure. However, many known electrides are chemically reactive and unstable, making high-quality single-crystal growth, characterization, and measurements difficult, and most do not exhibit superconductivity at ambient pressure. In contrast, La3In stands out for its ambient-pressure superconductivity (TC ~ 9.4 K) and the availability of high-quality single crystals. Here, we investigate its low-energy electronic structure using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and first-principles calculations. The bands near the Fermi energy are mainly derived from La 5d and In 5p orbitals. A saddle point is directly observed at the Brillouin zone (BZ) boundary, while a three-dimensional van Hove singularity crosses EF at the BZ corner. First-principles calculations further reveal topological Dirac surface states within the bulk energy gap above EF. The coexistence of a high density of states and in-gap topological surface states near EF suggests that La3In offers a promising platform for tuning superconductivity and exploring possible topological superconducting phases through doping or external pressure.

The doped quantum spin liquid on the kagome lattice provides a fascinating platform to explore exotic quantum states, such as the reported holon Wigner crystal at low doping. By extending the doping range to $δ= 0.027$ - $0.36$, we study the kagome-lattice $t$-$J$ model using the state-of-the-art density matrix renormalization group calculation. On the $L_y=3$ cylinder ($L_y$ is the number of unit cells along the circumference direction), we establish a quantum phase diagram with increasing doping level. In addition to the charge density wave (CDW) states at lower doping, we find an emergent Fermi-liquid-like phase by melting the holon Wigner crystal at $δ\approx 0.15$, which is characterized by suppression of charge density oscillation and power-law decay of various correlation functions. On the wider $L_y = 4$ cylinder, the bond-dimension extrapolated correlation functions also support such a Fermi-liquid-like state, suggesting its stability with increasing system size. In a narrow doping range near $δ= 1/3$ on the $L_y = 3$ cylinder, we find a state with an exponential decay of single-particle correlation but the other correlation functions preserving the features in the Fermi-liquid-like phase, which may be a precursor of a superconducting state. Nevertheless, this peculiar state near $δ= 1/3$ disappears on the $L_y = 4$ cylinder, implying a possible lattice size dependence. Our results reveal a quantum melting from a holon Wigner crystal to a Fermi-liquid-like state with increasing hole density, and suggest a doping regime to explore superconductivity for future study.

For one-dimensional spin and pseudospin models that allow mapping to a Markov chain, the free energy of the system at a finite temperature can be expressed in terms of bond concentrations. Minimizing the free energy function makes it possible to obtain an exact solution of a statistical model. A dilute Ising chain with interacting impurities is considered as an example.

- **TL;DR**: 通过CMOS兼容的单轴应变大幅增强硅量子阱中的谷分裂，使其对界面无序免疫，从而提高量子比特的栅极均匀性。

Regardless of various material design strategies, experimentally achieving substantial and controllable valley splitting in Si/SiGe quantum wells remains a central challenge for ensuring high gate uniformity. This difficulty arises from unavoidable atomic-scale disorder at the interface, caused by alloy randomness, which suppresses valley splitting and, more critically, induces large variations. Here, we demonstrate that CMOS-compatible uniaxial strain can substantially enhance valley splitting, rendering it immune to interface disorder. Atomistic pseudopotential calculations show that uniaxial strain linearly restores the valley splitting suppressed by interfacial disorder, with a large enhancement rate, while keeping disorder-induced variations within a narrow distribution. We reveal that uniaxial strain introduces a new coupling channel between bulk valleys in adjacent Brillouin zones through a small momentum transfer, which markedly reduces the susceptibility of valley splitting to interfacial disorder. These findings establish a viable route to improve gate uniformity in silicon-based spin qubits, paving the way for scalable quantum processors.

The internal coupling of magnetic excitations (magnons) with themselves has created a new research sub-field in hybrid magnonics, i.e., magnon-magnon coupling, which focuses on materials discovery and engineering for probing and controlling magnons in a coherent manner. This is enabled by, one, the abundant mechanisms of introducing magnetic interactions, with examples of exchange coupling, dipolar coupling, RKKY coupling, and DMI coupling, and two, the vast knowledge of how to control magnon band structure, including field and wavelength dependences of frequencies, for determining the degeneracy of magnon modes with different symmetries. In particular, we discuss how magnon-magnon coupling is implemented in various materials systems, with examples of magnetic bilayers, synthetic antiferromagnets, nanomagnetic arrays, layered van der Waals magnets, and (DMI SOT materials) in magnetic multilayers. We then introduce new concept of applications for these hybrid magnonic materials systems, with examples of frequency up/down conversion and magnon-exciton coupling, and discuss what properties are desired for achieving those applications.

- **TL;DR**: 提出SPI-DNIO框架，结合数据驱动网络和深度图像先验网络的优势，通过梯度信息增强的残差块，在低采样率下实现高质量单像素成像重建。

Single-pixel imaging(SPI),especially when integrated with deep neural networks like deep image prior networks (DIP-Net) or data-driven networks (DD-Net), has gained considerable attention for its capability to generate high-quality reconstructed images, even in the presence of sub-sampling conditions. However, DIP-Net often requires thousands of iterations to achieve high-quality image reconstruction, and DD-Net performs optimally only when the target closely resembles the features present in its training set. To overcome these limitations, we propose a dual-network iterative optimization (SPI-DNIO) framework that combines the strengths of both DD-Net and DIP-Net. It has been demonstrated that this approach can recover high-quality images with fewer iteration steps. Furthermore, to address the challenge of SPI inputs having less effective information at low sampling rates, we have designed a residual block enriched with gradient information, which can convey details to deeper layers, thereby enhancing the deep network's learning capabilities. We have applied these techniques to both indoor experiments with active lighting and outdoor long-range experiments with passive lighting. Our experimental results confirm the exceptional reconstruction capabilities and generalization performance of the SPI-DNIO framework.

### A rigorous adiabatic approach to ultracold atom-molecule collisions in a magnetic field

- **TL;DR**: 将严格绝热耦合通道形式扩展到存在外磁场下的超冷非反应性原子-分子碰撞，提出R依赖基组截断协议，计算效率提升15-30倍

We extend the rigorous adiabatic coupled-channel formalism to ultracold nonreactive atom-molecule collisions in the presence of an external magnetic field. The wavefunction of the collision complex is expanded in adiabatic basis states obtained by solving the eigenvalue problem for the adiabatic Hamiltonian (the total Hamiltonian of the collision complex minus the radial kinetic energy) on a grid of atom-molecule distances $R$. The resulting coupled-channel equations are solved using the diabatic-by-sector method. We show that the adiabatic approach provides accurate cross sections for cold and ultracold Mg ($^1$S) + NH ($^3Σ^-$) collisions in a magnetic field with ~2 times fewer channels than the standard diabatic basis. We further develop an efficient $R$-dependent basis truncation protocol (RBT), in which the elements of the log-derivative matrix are sampled and discarded as it is propagated from small to large $R$. While RBT can be applied in both the adiabatic and diabatic bases, we show that the adiabatic basis can be reduced to just the open channels at long range, leading to an overall computational gain of ~15-30 for the propagation part of the calculation. The gain is particularly significant in situations where substantial errors in the calculated cross sections ($&lt;$50\%) can be tolerated or long-range interactions are involved, making the adiabatic basis formulation a promising approach to strongly anisotropic collisions and chemical reactions in the presence of an external magnetic field.

The response of a MoRe-based superconducting resonator operating near 5 K to pulsed infrared irradiation is investigated, and the underlying physical mechanisms are analyzed. The device exhibits a pronounced nonlinear response dominated by nonequilibrium quasiparticle dynamics rather than uniform thermal heating. Infrared pulses produce strong distortions of the resonance curve and a transient decrease in the resonance frequency, consistent with increased kinetic inductance caused by quasiparticle generation. The frequency shift scales approximately linearly with absorbed power, whereas the dissipation response saturates at higher powers, indicating the formation of a nonequilibrium steady-state quasiparticle population. These observations demonstrate a transition from a linear pair-breaking regime to a saturated dissipation regime, likely associated with a quasiparticle relaxation bottleneck or partial suppression of the smaller superconducting gap in MoRe. The results highlight the relevance of nonequilibrium processes in MoRe and confirm its potential for microwave kinetic-inductance detector applications.

Magnetism is a fundamental research area in which the recently proposed altermagnetism (AM) has become an emergent frontier. Very recently, the quasicrystal (QC) was proposed as a possible platform to realize AM. However, the existence of AM in QCs still lacks vigorous evidence. In this work, we adopt the sign-problem-free projector quantum Monte Carlo (PQMC) algorithm to investigate the magnetic phases in the half-filled Hubbard models in various 2D bipartite QCs, and always obtain Néel ordered states. While the Néel states in bipartite crystals are usually antiferromagnetism (AFM), we find it common that those in bipartite QCs can also be AM or ferromagnetism (FM). Based on symmetry analysis, combined with our comprehensive PQMC results, we propose a general criterion for determining the magnetism classes of the Néel states in a bipartite QC: According to whether the two sublattices are related by the inversion, the other point-group operation, or no operation about the unique symmetry center in the QC, the corresponding Néel state is AFM, AM or FM, respectively. For example, our results yield AM for the two $D_4$-symmetric Thue-Morse QCs and FM for the $D_5$-symmetric Penrose QC at half-filling. Our results provide a solid foundation for experimental investigations and potential applications of different classes of magnetism in QCs.

Tracking the movement of tracer particles has long been a strategy for uncovering complex structures. Here, we study discrete-time random walks on finite Cayley trees to infer key parameters such as tree depth and geometric bias toward the root or leaves. By analyzing first passage properties, we show that the first two first-passage-time factorial moments (FPTFMs) uniquely determine the tree structure. However, if the random walker experiences waiting phases -- due to sticky branch walls or presence of traps -- this identification becomes nontrivial. We demonstrate that the generating function of the first passage time (FPT) distribution decomposes into contributions from the waiting time distribution and the random walk without waiting, leading to a nonlinear system of equations relating the factorial moments of the waiting time distribution and the FPTFMs of random walks with and without waiting. For geometrically distributed waiting times, additional moment measurements do not suffice, but unique determination of the structure is achieved by varying initial conditions or fitting the Fourier transform of the FPT distribution to measured data. The latter method remains effective also for power-law waiting time distributions, where higher-order FPTFMs are undefined. These results provide a framework for reconstructing tree-like networks from FPT data, with applications in biological transport and spatial networks.

### Evidence for electron localisation in a moiré-of-moiré superlattice

The localisation of electrons in a lattice potential is an quantum-mechanical phenomenon and is often associated with remarkable physical properties of solids involving electron spins, electric polarisations and topological effects. In particular, even a small amount of distortion of the lattice potential can localise otherwise-delocalised quantum states in low-dimensional electron systems, dramatically influencing their thermodynamic properties and charge-transport behaviour. Study of such electron localisation induced by an aperiodic lattice potential remains exceptionally challenging in solid-state systems, since extrinsic disorders can trivially trap electrons in potential minima near disorders, obscuring the underlying quantum-mechanical origin of localisation phenomena. Van der Waals heterostructures can provide an alternative route for explorations of the phenomena via the emergence of superlattice potentials generated by rotating and stacking individual layers. Here, we report strong signatures of electron localisation in helical trilayer graphene, where the interplay of two moiré patterns gives rise to a moiré-of-moiré superlattice with distinct regions of moiré-periodic and moiré-aperiodic potentials. Remarkably, our measurements reveal the presence of double moiré-induced bands and high-order Brown-Zak oscillations, which are direct reflections of the periodic region with two constituent moiré patterns, and a superimposed anomalous hysteretic signal attributable to the aperiodic region. The data strongly suggest that electron wave functions are partially localised driven by the loss of a periodic lattice potential. Our work provides insight into the effects of spatially inhomogeneous lattice potentials on the low-dimensional electronic states and introduces a promising approach to control electron localisation for practical applications in solid-state devices.

We present an interface between the Vienna \textit{Ab initio} Simulation Package (VASP) and the EPW software for calculating materials properties governed by electron-phonon (e-ph) interactions. Computation of the e-ph matrix elements with the finite-difference supercell approach in VASP and their fine-grid interpolation in EPW enable accurate modeling of temperature-dependent materials properties and phonon-assisted quantum processes with VASP's extensive library of exchange-correlation functionals and pseudopotentials. We demonstrate the functionality of the EPW-VASP interface by examining the superconducting gap and critical temperature in MgB$_2$ using the anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg equations, and the carrier mobility in cubic BN using the \textit{ab initio} Boltzmann transport equation.

We present stochastic variants of the exponential time differencing schemes for stiff stochastic differential equations.

To illustrate the effectiveness of this approach, we study several systems in and out of equilibrium, including Model A, Model B, the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation, and the Complex Ginzburg-Landau equation. We outline procedures for computing physical observables such as the critical exponents, correlation functions, and dynamic linear response, and provide our implementation as open source code.

Entangled photons have attracted increasing interest as resources for developing time-resolved spectroscopic techniques. Theoretical studies suggest that their non-classical correlations enable time-resolved spectroscopy with monochromatic pumping and can selectively isolate specific Liouville pathways in nonlinear optical signals. In an earlier study, we proposed a fluorescence detection scheme that could, in principle, be implemented using existing single-photon detectors [Y. Fujihashi et al., arXiv:2502.02073 (2025)]. In that design, the time origin was defined by detecting the arrival of the pulsed laser used to pump the nonlinear crystal for spontaneous parametric down-conversion, a requirement that made the overall experiment cumbersome. This study theoretically examines an alternative protocol that defines the reference time based on the arrival of idler photons. We demonstrate that this idler-referenced scheme functions effectively when the entangled photons exhibit either negative or negligible frequency correlations. Eliminating the pump-timing channel simplifies the optical layout and lowers the experimental barrier to realizing time-resolved two-dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy with entangled photons. Although the photons may exhibit frequency correlations in isolation, their frequency-time degrees of freedom can behave as effectively uncorrelated when considered over the full measurement timescale. Therefore, fully exploiting non-classical correlations requires an entangled photon source whose temporal characteristics are carefully matched to the overall timescale of the experiment.

We report the first experimental observation of subgap transport in ferromagnetic insulator/superconductor/insulator/superconductor junctions realized in EuS/Al/AlOx/Al vertical stacks. Differential conductance measurements reveal multiple Andreev reflection peaks, with odd-order peaks split by the spin-splitting induced in the superconductor adjacent to EuS, while even-order peaks remain unaffected. Combining experiments with quasiclassical transport modeling, we extract the spin-splitting and the distribution of transmission channels, finding that a significant fraction ($\sim 23\%$) of highly transparent channels ($τ\approx 0.9$) dominates transport. The observation of a Josephson current further confirms strong superconducting coupling through these channels. Our results demonstrate that a single spin-split superconductor is sufficient to observe the even-odd MAR effect. Our work establishes EuS/Al junctions as a versatile platform to study subgap transport, Josephson coupling, and spin-polarized superconducting phenomena.

We explore the magnetic properties of Nd$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ and Pr$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ single crystals subjected to pulsed magnetic fields up to 60 T using magnetization and magnetocaloric-effect (MCE) measurements, with initial temperatures ranging from 2 to 31K. The MCE data exhibit pronounced and unconventional hysteresis loops, in which the sample temperature increases during both the up-sweep and down-sweep of the field. In Nd$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$, the MCE further displays a striking plateau as a function of time, followed by a rapid temperature rise that begins at the maximum applied field, across pulses with differing peak-field strengths. Our magnetization measurements reveal an inferred temperature of the magnetic subsystem that differs significantly from the directly measured sample temperature and exhibits opposite hysteresis: the temperature is higher on the up-sweep than the down-sweep, unlike the direct measurements. These observations indicate a breakdown of thermal equilibrium between magnetic and lattice degrees of freedom on the timescale of the pulse ($\sim 10^{-1}$s). We interpret the results using a phenomenological model involving two thermally coupled subsystems - the magnetic ions and phonons, and a thermal reservoir, which accounts well for the behavior of Pr$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$. However, it fails to reproduce the plateau seen in Nd$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$. Agreement with Nd$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ data is improved substantially if we allow the thermal coupling between the magnetic and the lattice subsystems to depend on the product $\frac{HdH}{dt}$. Our results reveal anomalously slow heat transfer between magnetic and lattice subsystems and point toward a novel mechanism for dynamically controlling the heat flow in Nd$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ via the rate of magnetic field variation.

- **TL;DR**: 研究膨胀相对论活塞中的非平衡四矢量功，验证Jarzynski等式的协变形式，发现功分布集中在原点及曲线上而非平滑分布。

We investigate the non-equilibrium four-vector work in an expanding relativistic piston. By deriving the exact work distribution in this pedagogical model, we verify the covariant form of Jarzynski's equality. We find that the joint distribution of four-vector work $(W^0, W^1)$ concentrates on the origin and some curves in the $(W^0, W^1)$ space, rather than being smoothly distributed. In the non-relativistic limit, our model consistently recovers the non-relativistic dynamics. We further demonstrate that the momentum component of four-vector work remains significant in both the Lorentz-relativistic and Galilean-relativistic frameworks. In addition, we introduce a novel geometrical technique for analyzing the dynamics of relativistic collision processes, which can be straightforwardly extended to three-dimensional piston models.

Miniaturization is an essential element in the development of information processing technologies and is also one of the main determinants of the usability of the tested artificial neural networks. It is also a key element and one of the main challenges in the development of magnonic neuromorphic systems. In this work, we propose a new platform for the development of these new spin-wave-based technologies. Using micromagnetic simulations, we demonstrate that magnetic molecules regularly arranged on the surface of a thin ferromagnetic layer enable resonant coupling of propagating spin waves with the dynamics of the molecules' magnetic moments, opening a gap in the transmission spectrum up to 150 MHz. The gap, its width, and frequency can be controlled by an external magnetic field or the arrangement of molecules on the ferromagnetic surface. Furthermore, the antiferromagnetic arrangement of the magnetic moments of molecules or clusters of molecules allows for control of the gap's position and width. Thus, the proposed hybrid structure offers reprogrammability and miniaturization down to the deep nanoscale, operating frequencies in the range of several GHz, key properties for the implementation of artificial neural networks.

Recently, density functional theory-based high-throughput screening of point defects in 4H-SiC revealed the positively charged chlorine-vacancy (ClV) defect to be a promising quantum bit candidate emitting at telecom wavelengths, with an electronic structure analogous to the well-known NV center in diamond. Furthermore, recent infrared photoluminescence (PL) measurements on chlorine-implanted 4H-SiC have revealed new PL lines associated with the ClV defect. While the defect possesses a high-spin ground state, there is a lack of evidence of optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR), a key ingredient for optical spin initialization and readout. In this Letter, we employ a multireference wavefunction-based quantum chemistry method, specifically, second-order perturbation theory (NEVPT2) on top of a defect-localized many-body wavefunction (CASSCF), to explore the many-body electronic structure of the ClV center. We estimate photoluminescence, internal conversion, and intersystem crossing rates to investigate the possibility of spin polarization and ODMR activity. Our findings establish the ClV center in 4H-SiC as an optically addressable spin qubit with fiber optics compatibility in the technologically mature 4H-SiC host material, enabling the development of large-scale quantum networks.

### Robust Indexing for Challenging Serial X-ray Diffraction Patterns

- **TL;DR**: 提出一种针对少量可靠衍射峰的稳健晶体学索引算法，通过对称感知晶格解码和异常值修剪，在蛋白质数据集上优于现有方法

Serial crystallography experiments routinely produce thousands of diffraction patterns from crystals in random orientations. To turn this stream of images into a usable dataset, each pattern must be indexed before integration and merging can proceed. In practice, diffraction patterns may contain only a small number of reliable peaks, be contaminated by background or spuriously detected reflections, or arise from crystals with highly skewed unit cells. These factors make indexing unstable in the small-N regime. We introduce a robust indexing algorithm tailored to this setting. We formulate indexing as a symmetry-aware lattice decoding problem and design a loss that explicitly incorporates lattice symmetries while trimming outlier peaks that are inconsistent with any plausible orientation. We combine this objective with a reciprocal-space basis reparameterization that stabilizes decoding for skewed or poorly conditioned lattices, and we develop a dedicated small-N objective mode that couples refined peak scoring with a method to recover orientations from very few reflections. The resulting method is memory-efficient and suitable for robust indexing. We evaluate our approach on three protein datasets from the Coherent X-ray Imaging Data Bank collected at XFEL facilities, using identical preprocessing and unit-cell information across methods. Across all datasets, our algorithm matches or outperforms established indexers such as XGANDALF and TORO, with particularly large gains for patterns with few indexed peaks and for crystals with skewed unit cells. While slower, our method is extremely memory-efficient, and its structure allows high-parallelism on CPUs or larger batch sizes on GPUs. These results show that exploiting lattice structure, symmetry, and small-N-aware search yields substantial improvements in indexing robustness.

### Predicting complete basis set limit quasiparticle energies from triple-$ζ$ calculations

- **TL;DR**: 提出一个基于轨道动能估计GW方法基组不完备误差的简单线性模型，参数化后可将TZ基组计算的准粒子能量外推到CBS极限，误差仅20-30 meV。

We present a simple linear model to estimate the basis set incompleteness errors (BSIE) of (vertex-corrected) $GW$ QP energies based on the kinetic energy of the corresponding orbital only. We parametrise the model for $G_0W_0$, quasi-particle self-consistent $GW$ (qs$GW$), and vertex-corrected ($Σ^{BSE}@L^{BSE}$) QP energies on a large set of molecules containing 10 different elements for which we calculate complete basis set (CBS) limit extrapolated reference values with correlation-consistent basis sets ranging from triple- to hextuple-$ζ$ (TZ/6Z). Based on these accurate reference values, we obtain model parameters for Gaussian-type and Slater-type orbital (GTO/STO) basis sets which allow for the extrapolation of QP energies calculated with TZ basis sets to the CBS limit with errors of 20 to 30 meV. Analysing extrapolation errors, we show the commonly used extrapolation method which assumes an inverse linear dependence of the BSIE on the inverse number of basis functions to be valid, but to produce larger errors, even when a quadruple-$ζ$ calculation is used in the extrapolation.

We develop a theory for the plasmon spectrum in dirty superconductors across the entire temperature range. Starting with the microscopic Keldysh sigma model description, we link the plasmon dispersion $ω(q)$ to the optical conductivity $σ(ω,T)$ of a superconductor, which requires analytical continuation to the lower half-plane of complex frequency. This approach reveals a discontinuity at the superconducting transition: a jump in both the real and imaginary parts of $ω(q)$ at $T_c$. For any temperature below $T_c$, the plasmon dispersion terminates at a critical wave vector $q_c(T)$ where plasmons remains undamped, with $ω[q_c(T)] \approx 2Δ(0)$. Plasmons significantly attenuate only within a narrow 5% temperature window near $T_c$, with the propagating mode recovering at large $q$.

Recent progress in generalized symmetry and topological holography has shown that, in conformal field theory (CFT), topological data from one dimensional higher can play a key role in determining local dynamics. Based on this insight, a fixed-point (FP) tensor complex (TC) for CFT has recently been constructed. In this work, we develop a TC renormalization (TCR) algorithm adapted to this CFT-based structure, forming a renormalization-group (RG) framework with generalized symmetry. We show that the full FP tensor can emerge from the RG flow starting with only the three-point function of the primary fields. Remarkably, even when starting solely from topological data, the RG process can still reconstruct the full FP tensor--a method we call as topological bootstrap. This approach deepens the connection between the topological and dynamical aspects of CFT and suggests pathways toward a fully algebraic description of gapless quantum states, with potential extensions to higher dimensions.

### Equivalence of residual entropy of hexagonal and cubic ices from tensor network methods

The long-standing question of whether the residual entropy of hexagonal ice ($S_h$) equals that of cubic ice ($S_c$) remains unresolved despite decades of research on ice-type models. While analytical studies have established the inequality $S_h \geq S_c$, numerical investigations suggest that the two values are very close. In this work, we revisit this problem using high-precision tensor-network methods. In Monte Carlo approaches the residual entropy cannot be directly obtained by sampling the ground-state degeneracy space, however, the tensor-network framework enables an explicit encoding of the "ice rule'' into local tensors, and then the residual entropy is transformed into finding the largest eigenvalue of a transfer operator in the form of a projected entangled-pair operator, which allows high-accuracy numerical evaluation. Meanwhile, we propose a new perspective based on analyzing the normality of the transfer operator, and demonstrate that if the operator is normal, the equality $S_h = S_c$ follows directly. Then the variational tensor network methods are employed to numerically verify this normality. Finally both residual entropies are directly computed by using our recently developed split corner transfer matrix renormalization group algorithm, providing a rigorous evidence supporting the equality between $S_h$ and $S_c$.

- **TL;DR**: 扩展宏观多温度模型以包含非扩散和非局域现象，用于描述低维材料中的超快热输运，通过耦合电子、光学声子和声学声子子系统来更准确地模拟热流。

Ultrafast thermal transport in low-dimensional materials challenges traditional diffusive models due to reduced scattering, strong electron-phonon coupling, and pronounced non-equilibrium effects. To address these complexities, we extend the macroscopic multi-temperature model by incorporating non-diffusive and non-local phenomena, treating electrons, optical phonons, and acoustic phonons as coupled but thermally distinct subsystems. We benchmark this enhanced framework against the multi-temperature Boltzmann transport equation, enabling detailed resolution of branch-dependent energy relaxation and identifying bottlenecks in thermalization. This approach provides a more accurate and comprehensive description of heat flow in emerging materials, offering novel insights into phonon dynamics and electron-phonon interactions. These theoretical advances pave the way for the improved design and optimization of next-generation nanoelectronic and photothermal devices.

Magnetic order in van der Waals magnets can strongly influence their lattice dynamics, yet how this interaction manifests across different phonon length scales remains unclear. Optical phonons probe bond-scale exchange modulation and short-range spin correlations, whereas long-wavelength acoustic modes couple to uniform strain fields and are sensitive to the renormalization of the macroscopic elastic tensor associated with long-range magnetic order. Experimentally accessing these low-energy acoustic excitations in low-dimensional crystals is challenging due to their low energies and the small lateral dimensions of exfoliated samples. Here, we employ angle-resolved Brillouin-Mandelstam scattering spectroscopy to investigate the surface acoustic phonon spectrum of exfoliated NiPS3 thin films across their antiferromagnetic transition temperature. Our results show a single Rayleigh surface mode whose phase velocity exhibits a pronounced 5.5% softening upon cooling through the Neel temperature. This anomaly reflects a giant magnetoelastic renormalization of the long-wavelength elastic constants triggered by the onset of zigzag antiferromagnetic order. First-principles calculations of the full elastic tensor, combined with continuum finite-element modelling of the NiPS3/SiO2/Si heterostructure, reproduce both the Rayleigh-wave dispersion and its magnetic-order-induced shift. The obtained results reveal how microscopic exchange interactions shape macroscopic mechanical properties in two-dimensional antiferromagnetic semiconductors, providing a basis for lattice-controlled magnetism and magnetically tunable phononic, magnonic, and strain-mediated spintronic device concepts.

Molecular dynamics is widely used to study various phenomena, such as diffusion, shock wave propagation, and plasma dynamics. A wide range of software packages supports the expanding scope of molecular dynamics applications. However, the quality of simulations depends on force field approximations, ranging from simple models to direct quantum solutions. Recently, machine learning approaches for constructing accurate interatomic potentials have received significant attention. In MDcraft, we integrate these advances into a scalable, physically accurate framework. MDcraft is a comprehensive, modern molecular dynamics platform. It offers a high-level Python API with a user-friendly, script-based interface. The core simulation algorithms are implemented in C++ to ensure robustness and computational efficiency. MDcraft is built for high-performance computing on modern clusters and supports dynamic domain decomposition and load balancing via the Message Passing Interface (MPI) for scalable parallelization. Additionally, MDcraft leverages multithreading within nodes through standard C++ parallelism, enabling efficient use of heterogeneous architectures. We demonstrate the code's capabilities through several examples, including the shock response in aluminum, the shock Hugoniot in argon, and the cold curve of copper.

The structure and thickness of the electrical double layer (EDL) at carbon electrodes strongly influence electrochemical performance, yet remain poorly understood in super-concentrated aqueous electrolytes. Here we combine classical and quantum-mechanical molecular dynamics simulations to resolve the interfacial organisation of aqueous LiCl from dilute to water-in-salt (WiS) (1--$20~\mathrm{mol~kg^{-1}}$) concentrations at graphitic electrodes, and compare with electrochemical differential-capacitance measurements from which the potential of zero charge (PZC) is obtained. We uncover a concentration-driven restructuring of the EDL: below $6~\mathrm{mol~kg^{-1}}$, solvated Li$^+$ dominates the outer Helmholtz plane (OHP), but at higher concentrations co-adsorption of Cl$^-$ through solvent-separated ion pairs enforces a near 1:1 Li:Cl ratio at the interface. This transition expands the effective EDL thickness, redistributes the interfacial potential drop, and drives a decrease in the PZC, matching the trend inferred from differential-capacitance measurements on electrolyte-graphite interfaces. Capacitance calculations reveal that while both EDL and quantum contributions vary strongly with concentration, their opposing trends make the total capacitance appear nearly constant for pristine few-layer graphite; for electrodes with smaller quantum capacitance, however, the concentration dependence of the EDL capacitance would be directly reflected in the total capacitance. Solvent-separated ion pairing is identified as the key driver of anomalous EDL behaviour in LiCl WiS electrolytes, establishing design considerations for tuning interfacial capacitance and stability in next-generation aqueous energy-storage systems.

Infinite projected entangled-pair states (iPEPS) provide a powerful tensor network ansatz for two-dimensional quantum many-body systems in the thermodynamic limit. In this paper we introduce an approach to accurately compute the energy variance of an iPEPS, enabling systematic extrapolations of the ground-state energy to the exact zero-variance limit. It is based on the contraction of a large cell of tensors using the corner transfer matrix renormalization group (CTRMG) method, to evaluate the correlator between pairs of local Hamiltonian terms. We show that the accuracy of this approach is substantially higher than that of previous methods, and we demonstrate the usefulness of variance extrapolation for the Heisenberg model, for a free fermionic model, and for the Shastry-Sutherland model. Finally, we apply the approach to compute $\langle \langle \mathcal{L}^\dagger \mathcal{L} \rangle \rangle$ for an open quantum system described by the Liouvillian $\mathcal{L}$, in order to assess the quality of the steady-state solution and to locate first-order phase transitions, using the dissipative quantum Ising model as an example.

The Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) successfully predicts the density of topological defects deposited by the phase transitions, but it is not clear why. Its key conjecture is that, near the critical point of the second-order phase transition, critical slowing down will result in a period when the system is too sluggish to follow the potential that is changing faster than its reaction time. The correlation length at the freeze-out instant $\hat t$ when the order parameter catches up with the post-transition broken symmetry configuration is then decisive, determining when the mosaic of broken symmetry domains locks in topological defects. To understand why the KZM works so well we analyze Landau-Ginzburg model and show why temporal evolution of the order parameter plays such a key role. The analytical solutions we obtain suggest novel, hitherto unexplored, experimentally accessible observables that can shed light on symmetry breaking dynamics while testing the conjecture on which the KZM is based.

The modeling flow is based on DC measurements to extract static parameters including variability and RF measurements to extract dynamic parameters. Modifications to the mobility equations are introduced to enable the modeling of intersubband scattering effect. The extracted models are used to enable deep-cryogenic simulations of a digital-to-analog converter (DAC), showing close agreement with measurement results.

Polyhydrides have been shown to form novel structures at high pressure, which may be found in the interiors of giant planets. With density functional molecular dynamics simulations we studied the behavior of ammonium polyhydride compounds with stoichiometries of NH$_7$, NH$_9$, NH$_{10}$, NH$_{11}$, NH$_{14}$, NH$_{20}$, and NH$_{24}$ which were predicted with crystal structure search methods to be metastable at 100-300~GPa. For every compound, we performed simulations at a range of temperatures (and for several compounds, pressures) covering the solid, superionic and liquid phases. We show that when heated, high pressure ammonium polyhydride compounds exhibit hydrogen superionic diffusion. We demonstrate a number of metrics by which the solid-to-superionic and superionic-to-liquid transitions can be detected from simulation data, including changes in the internal energy and pressure, formation of new chemical species, and atomic diffusion rates. We find that both the solid-to-superionic and the superionic-to-liquid transitions decrease in temperature as proton fraction increases. These trends indicate that above a proton fraction of $\sim$0.97, ammonium hydride structures are likely to directly melt instead of first exhibiting a superionic phase. Our observed melting trend further indicates that at the extreme conditions of ice giant interiors, hydrogen rich ammonium hydrides such as those studied in this work would exist predominantly as liquids rather than exhibiting a superionic phase.

Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have proved to be a promising method for modeling multiphase flows. However, due to the gradient-direction conflict during the optimization of the coupled strongly nonlinear Allen-Cahn, Cahn-Hilliard, and Navier-Stokes equations, phase-field-based PINNs have not been extended to three-phase flows with phase change. Furthermore, the interface thickness is known to be artificially magnified, whether in numerical or artificial intelligence-based simulations, reducing accuracy. To mitigate these limitations, this study presents a discontinuity-aware physics-informed neural network (DPINN) that solves an energy-stable phase-field model for three-phase flows. It incorporates a discontinuity-aware residual-adaptive architecture to mitigate spectral bias and to automatically detect and model sharp interfaces, and a learnable local artificial-viscosity term to stabilize the algorithm near steep gradients. During optimization, adaptive time-marching and loss-balancing strategies are introduced to reduce long-term error accumulation and to mitigate gradient conflicts in multi-objective training, respectively. In numerical experiments on the two-phase reversed single-vortex and bubble-rising problems, the proposed method accurately resolves sharp interfacial dynamics that conventional PINNs fail to converge. It also extends to a three-phase droplet-icing case with viscosity and density ratios exceeding 7 and 3 orders of magnitude, accurately capturing the phase-change dynamics and the formation of the pointy tip.

Reliable dynamical properties from molecular dynamics simulations require careful control of thermostatting artifacts. We systematically assess how NVE, deterministic thermostats, velocity-rescale dynamics, and stochastic Langevin-type thermostats affect time-correlation functions across liquids of varying complexity. The analysis spans vibrational spectra, velocity and pressure autocorrelations, diffusion coefficients, shear viscosities, and Markov state models. Deterministic thermostats and velocity-rescale dynamics closely reproduce NVE reference data over all observables. In contrast, strongly coupled stochastic thermostats (tau less 1 ps) systematically distort dynamical properties. By constrast, moderate stochastic coupling (tau eq. 1 ps) restores near-NVE behavior while maintaining canonical sampling. Our results provide practical guidelines for selecting thermostat schemes when accurate dynamical properties or Markov models are required.

We reveal the emergence of a robust tetrahedral magnetic ground state in monolayer graphene doped to the van Hove singularity (vHS). This noncoplanar, gapped spin configuration -- featuring four orthogonal moments -- has been previously identified as a candidate instability. Here, not only do we confirm its stability across all finite interactions using fully self-consistent, real-space-resolved calculations, but we also go beyond earlier work by charting the full surrounding phase diagram. In doing so, we unravel a cascade of symmetry-broken magnetic states -- pseudo-tetrahedral, planar, collinear, and modulated textures -- which we classify using spin structure factors and vector order parameters. These results stem from unrestricted Hartree-Fock simulations on large supercells with dense k-point sampling, enabling us to resolve interaction-driven magnetic and charge inhomogeneities. Our findings connect directly with recent ARPES and doping experiments near the vHS in graphene, and establish the tetrahedral state as the central correlated instability in this regime, offering predictive insight into emergent magnetism in correlated Dirac materials.

- **TL;DR**: 研究高斯过程动态观测值的大偏差行为，发现短相关和长相关过程都表现出反常标度和一阶动态相变，但长相关过程的指数还依赖于协方差的长时衰减幂律。

We study large deviations, over a long time window $T \to \infty$, of the dynamical observables $A_n = \int_{0}^{T} x^n(t) dt$, $n=3,4,\dots$, where $x(t)$ is a centered stationary Gaussian process in continuous time. We show that, for short-correlated processes the probability density of $A_n$ exhibits an anomalous scaling $P(A_n,T) \sim \exp[-T^μ f_n(ΔA_n T^{-ν})]$ at $T\to \infty$ while keeping $ΔA_n T^{-ν}$ constant. Here $ΔA_n$ is the deviation of $A_n$ from its ensemble average. The anomalous exponents $μ$ and $ν$ depend on $n$ and are smaller than $1$, whereas the rate function $f_n(z)$ exhibits a first-order dynamical phase transition (DPT) which resembles condensation transitions observed in many systems. The same type of anomaly and DPT, with the same $μ$ and $ν$, was previously uncovered for the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process - the only stationary Gaussian process which is also Markovian. We also uncover an anomalous behavior and a similar DPT in the long-correlated Gaussian processes. However, the anomalous exponents $μ$ and $ν$ are determined in this case not only by $n$ but also by the power-law long-time decay $\sim |t|^{-α}$ of the covariance. The different anomalous scaling behavior is a consequence of a faster-than-linear scaling with $T$ of the variance of $A_n$. Finally, for sufficiently long-ranged correlations, $α&lt;2/n$, the DPT disappears, giving way to a smooth crossover between the regions of typical, Gaussian fluctuations and large deviations. The basic mechanism behind the DPT is the existence of strongly localized optimal paths of the process conditioned on very large $A_n$ and coexistence between the localized and delocalized paths of the conditioned process. Our theoretical predictions are corroborated by replica-exchange Wang-Landau simulations where we could probe probability densities down to $10^{-200}$.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文从拓扑角度解释了非可定向布里渊区中Weyl半金属的拓扑分类，发现了物理上重要的Z₂电荷抵消现象，并扩展到非厄米拓扑物理领域。

The quasi-particle excitations in Weyl semimetals, known as Weyl fermions, are usually forced to emerge in charge-conjugate pairs by the Nielsen--Ninomiya theorem. When the Brillouin zone is non-orientable, this constraint is replaced by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ charge cancellation, as a result of the chirality becoming ill-defined on such manifolds; this results in configurations with seemingly non-zero total chirality. Here, we set out to explain this behaviour from a purely topological perspective, and provide a classification of non-orientable Weyl semimetal topology in terms of exact sequences of twisted (co)homology groups. This leads to several discoveries of direct physical importance: in particular, we recover the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ charge cancellation in a coordinate-independent way, allowing meaningful limits to be set on its physical interpretation. A detailed discussion is provided on a specific Klein bottle-like topology induced by a momentum-space glide symmetry, including a full review of the insulating and semimetallic invariants of the system and a classification of the surface states on the non-orientable boundary. Beyond this, we provide a complete survey of all possible non-orientable Brillouin zones and their associated invariants, and extend our formalism into the realm of non-Hermitian topological physics and inversion-symmetric Weyl semimetals. Our work exemplifies the vast potential of fundamental mathematical descriptions to not only aid the corresponding physical intuition, but also predict novel and hitherto overlooked phenomena of great relevance throughout the physics research forefront.

In this paper, we study the domain wall dynamics under electric current in the helimagnet MnAu$_2$. We have found that the threshold electric current of the transition from a multidomain state to a single-chiral domain state in a magnetic field is much lower than that of chirality reversal from a single-chiral domain within certain ranges of temperature and magnetic field. The chirality after the transition depends on whether the magnetic field and electric current were parallel or antiparallel. Numerical calculations based on the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation reproduced the experimental observations. These results indicate that the domain walls are highly mobile in the helimagnet.

In molecular simulations, machine-learning force fields can achieve ab initio accuracy at a lower cost but remain limited in the explicit modeling of electrons. In this work, we develop an electron-aware machine-learning force field, in which an excess electron of interest is modeled quantum mechanically, while the remaining short-range interactions and long-range Coulombic forces are machine-learned to reproduce a density functional theory calculation. We demonstrate the method on the solvated electron in bulk water and its reaction with a hydronium ion. We identify a proton transfer mechanism by which the excess proton recombines with the electron. We determine the forward reaction rates between 350 K and 450 K from first-passage survival functions, which yield an Arrhenius relationship with an activation energy of 3.2 kcal$\cdot$mol$^{-1}$, in good agreement with experiment. From an enhanced sampling simulation, we determine the equilibrium constant, and thus the reaction free energy, which is also consistent with experimental measurements.

Non-trivial topological phases often emerge in narrow-gap semiconductors with a delicate blend of spin-orbit coupling and electron correlation. The diamond-lattice allotrope of Sn ($α$-Sn) exemplifies this behavior, hosting multiple topological phases that can be tuned by small distortions in the lattice. Despite rapid experimental progress, theoretical descriptions of $α$-Sn lack predictive power and rely mainly on tight-binding models and density functional theory with uncontrolled approximations. We employ first-principles fully self-consistent, relativistic GW (scGW) to overcome these limitations. The scGW recovers the experimentally observed zero-gap semiconductor and the strain-induced topological insulator and Dirac semimetal phases, while also predicting new trivial and topological insulators and a Dirac semimetal phase, further demonstrating the versatility of $α$-Sn for band engineering. Additionally, we propose a robust diagnostic of topological behavior based on a combined analysis of band and orbital-occupation dispersions, tailored for correlated methods where standard mean-field-based topological invariants fall short. Our findings pave the way for studying a broad class of topological materials using accurate first-principles methods beyond density functional theory.

We present a historical review of anyon and exclusion statistics, introduced in the 1980s and 1990s respectively, and then turn to developments in the recently introduced inclusion statistics. In contrast to exclusion statistics, where particles tend to be more exclusive than usual fermions, inclusion statistics particles tend to be more gregarious than usual bosons and manifest an enhanced propensity to form condensates. Inclusion and exclusion statistics are related through a duality transformation, generalizing the well-known Bose-Fermi duality. We conclude with a review of the Calogero model realization of exclusion statistics and its extension to inclusion statistics.

- **TL;DR**: 利用交替扭转三层石墨烯的本征非公度性稳定分数量子陈绝缘体，通过抑制竞争电荷密度波相，发现FCI能隙随量子几何指标恶化而增大的反直觉现象。

Fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) typically emerge in topological flat bands and are regarded as lattice analogs of fractional quantum Hall states. Conventionally, the flat-band wavefunctions that support FCIs are expected to mimic the lowest Landau level, a condition that can be quantified by the quantum-geometric indicators. In realistic systems, however, FCIs often compete with lattice symmetry-breaking orders, especially when the hosting flat bands not ideal. In this work, we propose stabilizing FCIs by exploiting the intrinsic incommensurability of alternating twisted trilayer graphene, which naturally suppresses competing charge-density-wave (CDW) phase while FCIs are less effected. Within an adiabatic approximation at the supermoiré scale, the effect of incommensuration on local physics can be quantified as phase shifts of interlayer coupling. Using exact diagonalization, we compute ground states in different local patches and uncover a strikingly counterintuitive result: the FCI gap increases as the quantum-geometric indicators worsen. Within certain parameter ranges, we further identify mixed phases where FCIs coexist with CDWs, but with CDWs confined only to patches of weak incommensurability. Finally, we provide experimental protocols and discuss how incommensuration enrich the system's topology and quantum geometry. Not only do our results establish incommensuration as a robust stabilizer of FCIs, but also provide a general paradigm for exploring strong-correlation physics in incommensurate systems.

Characterizing the spin and charge degrees of freedom in high-temperature superconducting cuprates under non-equilibrium conditions provides new insights into their electronic correlations. However, their collective dynamics have been largely unexplored due to experimental challenges. Here, we use time-resolved resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (trRIXS) at the Cu $L_3$-edge to simultaneously track the collective spin (paramagnon) and charge (acoustic plasmon) dynamics in an optimally electron-doped cuprate driven out-of-equilibrium by a femtosecond pump laser pulse. Upon pumping, we observed an anti-Stokes signal associated with paramagnon generation, which modifies the paramagnon dispersion near the zone center, though the bandwidth remained unchanged, suggesting no significant alteration to spin exchange interactions. Simultaneously, in the charge sector, the acoustic plasmon's energy and spectral weight decreased, suggesting a light-induced redistribution of charge carriers. The variations of both the paramagnon and the plasmon were locked in time, demonstrating a robust intertwining between the spin and charge degrees of freedom on a femtosecond timescale, even in this non-equilibrium state.

The development of next-generation electrochemical energy storage requires devices that combine the high energy density of batteries with the power capability and long cycle life of supercapacitors. However, the interfacial phenomena governing performance in these systems remain poorly unified. The solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI), a nanoscale film formed by electrolyte decomposition, is well studied in batteries but its counterpart in supercapacitors has received limited systematic investigation despite growing experimental evidence. This review argues that SEI formation is a universal electrochemical process that occurs whenever electrode potentials drive electron transfer into electrolyte orbitals beyond their stability limits, independent of whether charge storage is Faradaic or non-Faradaic. Differences between battery SEIs and supercapacitor interphases arise mainly from operating conditions, not fundamental chemistry. Engineered interphases created through electrolyte additives, protective coatings, or surface functionalization suppress leakage currents, improve capacitance retention, and enable stable high-voltage operation. By identifying shared mechanisms and establishing transferable design rules, this unified framework provides a foundation for predictive interphase engineering that supports long-lived, high-performance energy-storage technologies.

Condensed matter physics continues to seek new frustrated quantum materials that not only deepen our understanding of fundamental physical phenomena but also hold promise for transformative technologies. In this review article, we highlight the unique features of chiral spin topology and review the topological phenomena recently identified in trillium lattice compounds. Based on the unique spin states realized in these systems, we explore the potential for realizing various theoretically proposed chiral quantum phases. We examine representative materials including the magnetic insulating compound K2Ni2(SO4)3 and and the intermetallic EuPtSi discussing both experimental findings and theoretical predictions, while outlining several key questions. Finally, we offer a perspective on promising research directions aimed at uncovering novel emergent behavior in chiral trillium lattice-based materials.

### Generation of concurrence in a generalized central spin model with a three-spin interacting environment

We consider the three-spin Ising model to study the effect of three-spin interacting term on bi-partitie entanglement between adjacent spins. The three-dominated disordered region has tri-partite entanglement causing a vanishingly small concurrence, while it acquires maximum value around the critical points. Considering the above model as an environment, we construct a generalized central spin model where two central spins, initially in an unentangled pure state, are coupled locally to two distinct sites of the environmental spin chain. We study the generation of mixed state entanglement between the central spins when the transverse field of the environment is kept fixed, and suddenly quenched, referring to equilibrium and non-equilibrium dynamics of the central spins, respectively. For the critical environment in the equilibrium, the concurrence shows a dip-revival structure governed by quasi-particle movement. In the non-equilibrium study, we find an initial growth of concurrence followed by a two-stage fall for the inter-phase quench which is governed by dynamic decoherence channels. The central spins are maximally entangled for a quench in the vicinity of a multicritical point, which arises due to three-spin interaction only. The concurrence becomes long-lived for an intra-phase quench, and this sustainability depends on the strength of the three-spin interaction. Therefore, the three-spin interaction indeed helps in generating bi-partite entanglement in the central spins.

It is generally assumed that the carbon atoms of graphitic samples and their finite analogs have sizable quadrupole moments, with the out-of-plane component ($Q^{\rm C}_{20}$ in traceless spherical coordinates) being the dominate contribution.
  However, there is no consensus on what the quantity is for such carbon-based systems and values reported in the literature range from $Q^{\rm C}_{20} \sim -1.14$ to $+0.79$ a.u.
  In this work we propose a theoretical framework in which well-defined statements can be made about properties of atoms-in-a-molecule (AIMs) even when these properties are not experimentally observable.
  Using this framework and the distributed multipole method basis-space iterated Stockholder atoms (BS-ISA), we show that the atomic quadrupole moment of a carbon atom in graphene is essentially zero within the limits of precision of the numerical method used.
  We explain how the experimentally measured atomic quadrupole moment of a graphite sample determined by Whitehouse \& Buckingham likely originated almost entirely from edge dipoles, and we propose a more realistic electrostatic model for finite graphene nanoflakes.

Two-dimensional tungsten disulfide (WS2) is a promising semiconductor for next-generation optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices, but scalable routes to uniform, large-area films remain challenging. In this study, a systematic thermal chemical vapor deposition (T-CVD) strategy is presented to synthesize centimeter-scale WS2 thin films by sulfurizing tungsten (W) precursors in a controlled sulfur vapor environment. High-purity sputtered W thin films on SiO2/Si and W foils were sulfurized at temperatures between 400 and 1000 C, with Raman spectroscopy identifying 800 C as the optimal growth temperature. Under these conditions, the films exhibit the characteristic E12g (349.7 cm-1) and A1g (416.8 cm-1) modes with narrow full-width at half-maximum values, indicative of high crystallinity and controlled thickness. Optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy collectively validate the creation of stoichiometric, layered WS2 with significantly enhanced uniformity and diminished roughness when utilizing sputtered W thin films in contrast to W foils. Leveraging this optimized process, WS2 films grown on W foils were transferred onto target substrates, including indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass, using a PMMA-assisted wet-transfer method that preserves structural integrity over large areas. Schottky-barrier solar cells with an Au/WS2/ITO architecture fabricated from these films deliver a short-circuit current density of 7.91 mA cm-2, an open-circuit voltage of 0.495 V, and a power conversion efficiency of 1.45 percent. These results demonstrate that sulfurization of W thin films and foils via T-CVD provides a scalable, substrate-compatible platform for integrating WS2 into practical optoelectronic and low-cost photovoltaic technologies.

This work presents a finite element method for simulating dynamic processes that involve the coupled evolution of dislocation motion and crack propagation. The method numerically solves the Concurrent Atomistic-Continuum (CAC) formulation of the conservation of linear momentum. A crystalline material is discretized at the unit-cell level using 6-node prism elements whose geometry allows dislocations and cracks to nucleate and propagate along element facets. Nanoscale simulations of single-crystal Cu, Fe, and Si demonstrate the initiation and propagation of dislocations and cracks, and these results are reproduced by the finite element method in excellent agreement with fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. Mesoscale simulations of single-crystal Cu further demonstrate the ability of the method to capture size-dependent brittle and ductile behavior. Under plane-strain conditions the Cu model fractures in a brittle manner, while a fully three-dimensional model exhibits curved and intersecting dislocations that blunt the crack tip and prevent crack propagation, resulting in ductile behavior. The accuracy, efficiency, and applicability of the method are discussed.

Reactive dopant atoms embedded in inert host metal surfaces define the active sites in single-atom alloys (SAAs), yet SAA synthesis remains challenging. To address this, we elucidate how dopant adatoms deposited on Cu and Ag surfaces become incorporated into the metal and identify periodic trends from early to late transition metals (TMs) using density functional theory. Adatoms diffuse nearly freely across terraces, as diffusion barriers are small, whereas direct incorporation into terraces is unfavourable. In line with conventional wisdom, step edges and kink sites strongly facilitate dopant incorporation, confirming their critical role in alloy formation. Attachment of adatoms to steps and kinks from the lower terrace is favoured. Incorporation then proceeds either from this attached state or when adatoms approach a step edge from above, where reactions often proceed without barrier. Incorporation barriers are generally lower for early and central TMs, increase towards late TMs, and are slightly higher on Cu than on Ag surfaces. Repulsive interactions between Pd adatoms and dopants explain the experimental observation that a dopant-rich brim on the upper terrace of Cu surfaces inhibits incorporation from above. In contrast, attractive interactions, as found for Ru, anchor diffusing adatoms (even on terraces) and promote the formation of adatom islands, yet hinder incorporation next to the dopant and may impede the growth of embedded dopant clusters. By rationalising periodic trends and experimental observations, we show how specific surface sites and adatom--dopant interactions shape dopant incorporation, offering guidance on the surface environments most conducive to SAA synthesis for different dopant elements.

Beyond conventional electric and magnetic monopoles, electric and magnetic toroidal monopoles, which are rank-0 multipoles distinguished by opposite parities under spatial inversion and time reversal, can exist in nature. The recent observation of electric-field-induced directional dichroism in antiferromagnetic olivine Co$_2$SiO$_4$ has provided the first concrete example of a magnetic toroidal monopole; however, its microscopic origin remains elusive. Here, we propose a minimal spin model that incorporates magnetoelectric coupling via the $d$-$p$ hybridization mechanism and analyze it within the mean-field approximation. The model qualitatively reproduces the experimentally observed temperature dependence of the dielectric constant and its pronounced sensitivity to the direction of the applied electric field. Furthermore, it elucidates the temperature evolution of the magnetic toroidal monopole and the strong electric-field-direction dependence of the magnetic toroidal moment. Our calculations also predict a second-order nonlinear magnetoelectric response, consistent with the symmetry classification of Co$_2$SiO$_4$ as an altermagnet. Additionally, we demonstrate that the same framework is applicable to other antiferromagnetic olivines with analogous magnetic order, indicating the robustness and generality of the toroidal-type magnetoelectric response in this material family.

- **TL;DR**: 本文开发了数值稳定的LNS方法，研究了一维非厄米系统中安德森局域化相变的普适性，发现不同无序模型在对称性破缺后属于同一普适类，临界指数为ν=1.50±0.00，β~0.65。

We investigate the universality of Anderson localization transitions in one-dimensional non-Hermitian systems exhibiting the skin effect. By developing a numerically stable Log-Space Non-Hermitian Scaling (LNS) method, we overcome the severe floating-point overflow issues associated with the exponential growth of transmittance (T ~ exp(2 gamma L)), enabling precision finite-size scaling analysis up to system sizes of L = 1200. We probe the critical behavior across three distinct disorder landscapes: uniform diagonal, binary diagonal, and off-diagonal (random hopping) disorder. While the uniform model exhibits a standard mobility edge, the off-diagonal model reveals a Dyson-like singularity at the band center (E = 0), where the system resists localization even at strong disorder due to sublattice symmetry protection. However, upon symmetry breaking (E != 0), we demonstrate that all considered models, regardless of the disorder distribution (continuous vs. discrete) or Hamiltonian structure (site vs. bond randomness), belong to the same robust universality class. The critical exponents are determined as nu = 1.50 +/- 0.00 and beta ~ 0.65 through unambiguous data collapse, establishing a model-independent description of non-Hermitian localization transitions.

- **TL;DR**: 石墨烯/InSe异质结中量子输运呈现纵向电阻不对称性及高磁场下电阻峰消失现象，可通过密度梯度与完全平衡机制解释

We investigate quantum transport in graphene/InSe heterostructures and find major asymmetries in the longitudinal resistance ($R_{xx}$) and vanishing $R_{xx}$ peaks at high magnetic fields, particularly at the charge-neutrality point. Our Landauer-Buttiker analysis and numerical simulations show that a monotonically varying density gradient combined with a full equilibration mechanism can explain these phenomena. Our results also suggest the presence of trivial long-range chiral edge current and offer a broadly applicable way to engineer transport properties in quantum Hall systems.

Understanding the mechanisms of UV-induced degradation is crucial for enhancing the UV stability of perovskite solar cells. The UV-driven structural dynamics of CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) are investigated using real-time TDDFT simulations, revealing that under the electron and hole excitation, the distortion of the inorganic framework (PbI) is primarily driven by the electron occupation of Pb-p and I-p antibonding states, whereas in the hole case, it is mainly governed by the direct cooling induced distortion. We also find that UV accelerates the rotation of MA+ molecules. Further, a BDO molecule is introduced as a passivant, which suppresses structural distortions and provides multi-phonon channels to dissipate carrier cooling energy. Experimental results confirm the UV-protective role of BDO, with suppressed PbI2 formation and improved device stability. These results clarify the mechanism of the UV-induced degradation in the MAPbI3 perovskite and further elucidate how passivation molecules enhance UV stability.

We propose geometrically nonlinear (finite) continuum models of flexomagnetism based on the Cosserat micropolar and its descendent couple-stress theory. These models introduce the magneto-mechanical interaction by coupling the micro-dislocation tensor of the micropolar model with the magnetisation vector using a Lifshitz invariant. In contrast to conventional formulations that couple strain-gradients to the magnetisation using fourth-order tensors, our approach relies on third-order tensor couplings by virtue of the micro-dislocation being a second-order tensor. Consequently, the models permit centrosymmetric materials with a single new flexomagnetic constant, and more generally allow cubic-symmetric materials with two such constants. We postulate the flexomagnetic action-functionals and derive the corresponding governing equations using both scalar and vectorial magnetic potential formulations, and present numerical results for a nano-beam geometry, confirming the physical plausibility and computational feasibility of the models.

- **TL;DR**: 开发了基于深度先验方法的噪声去除系统，集成到μSX-ARPES中，能在约30秒内有效消除ARPES数据中的网格和尖峰噪声，显著降低SX-ARPES的时间负担。

Soft X-ray angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (SX-ARPES) is one of the most powerful spectroscopic techniques to visualize the three-dimensional bulk electronic structure in reciprocal lattice space. Compared with ARPES employing low-energy photon sources, the time burden imposed by a lower photoelectron yield, stemming from the photoionization cross-section, has been a persistent technical challenge. To address this challenge, we have developed a noise removal system by using the deep prior-based method and integrated it into the micro focused SX-ARPES (μSX-ARPES) system at BL25SU in SPring-8. Our implemented system effectively eliminates the grid and spike noise typically present in ARPES data acquired using the voltage Fixed-mode, within about 30 seconds. We demonstrate, through the μSX-ARPES measurements on a single crystal of CeRu2Si2, that data with sufficient statistical accuracy can be obtained in approximately 40 seconds. In addition, we present the potential of high signal-to-noise ratio ARPES measurement, achieving an energy resolution of 51.6 meV at an excitation energy of 708 eV in μSX-ARPES measurements on polycrystalline gold. Our developed system successfully reduces the time burden in SX-ARPES and paves the way for advancements in lower photoelectron yield measurements, such as those requiring higher energy resolution and three-dimensional nonequilibrium measurements.

- **TL;DR**: 研究随机弹性流形基态能量的非典型涨落，获得大偏差速率函数的精确描述，发现基态能量满足中心极限定理，并计算了重标方差

We describe the atypical fluctuations of the ground state energy of the random elastic manifold, a disordered model defined on a lattice of linear size $L$ with internal dimension $0\leq d&lt;4$ embedded in a medium of dimension $N\gg 1$. The ground-state energy results from a competition between confinement, elasticity and disorder. We obtain an exact description of the large deviation rate function with speed $NL^d$ and its different phases, corresponding to different patterns of replica symmetry breaking (RSB). Our results show that the ground-state energy satisfies a central limit theorem and we obtain an explicit expression for the rescaled variance. In the (massless) limit of zero confinement, this variance vanishes for short-range disorder and the ground-state energy displays super-concentration. From our results on the large deviation function, we characterise explicitly the left tail of the distribution of the typical fluctuations of the ground state energy. It displays an exponential tail for a one step RSB pattern while for a full RSB pattern it decays super-exponentially with a non trivial exponent $ξ$ that we compute explicitly.

Defect charge-state dynamics are central to both spin-photon interfaces and photoelectrical spin readout. Despite the significance of silicon vacancies (V1/V2) in silicon carbide (4H-SiC) for both applications, their ionization behavior has remained unclear because their lack of optical blinking prevents conventional charge-state analysis. Here, we employ photocurrent spectroscopy of individual defects to measure the wavelength dependence of their excitation and ionization cross-sections. We reveal that V1 and V2 exhibit similar ionization cross-sections that increase toward shorter wavelengths, while carbon vacancies dominate the more steeply increasing background photocurrent. These results indicate that V2 and its surrounding environment appear more robust than V1 under resonant excitation. We also identify wavelength regimes that optimize defect-origin photocurrent for photoelectrical spin readout relative to background contributions, which differ between single-defect and ensemble measurements. Our results establish photocurrent spectroscopy as a powerful complement to optical methods, advancing the development of defect-based quantum devices.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文展示了钙钛矿材料在高分辨率AR/VR微显示器中的颜色转换应用，通过三种图案化方法实现高效色彩转换像素

Colour conversion offers the clearest path to achieve RGB colours in high resolution microdisplays for AR/VR. With resolutions beyond 5000 ppi (i.e. RGB pitch of 5 um), the thickness of the conversion layers is critical for efficiency and manufacturing. Perovskites outperform other conversion materials (quantum dots or phosphors) with their high absorption coefficients for blue light. In this contribution, we show how perovskite materials, engineered for high optical density and colour purity, can be patterned to produce colour converting pixels. We demonstrate patterning using three approaches (lift-off, negative photoresist and dry etch), and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. The results consolidate the choice of perovskites for AR/VR applications by demonstrating their robustness and compatibility with multiple patterning strategies suitable for high resolution microdisplays.

We present high-precision ab initio calculations of the four-point vertex function for the three-dimensional uniform electron gas using variational diagrammatic Monte Carlo. From these results, we extract Landau parameters that demonstrate a density-driven crossover from underscreening to overscreening. Guided by our numerical data, we propose a charge-based Kukkonen--Overhauser effective interaction within the local-density approximation, supplemented by a small s-wave correction (sKO$^+$), which accurately captures the electron--electron scattering amplitude. Using our numerically determined scattering amplitude, together with the sKO$^+$ ansatz, we compute the electron-electron contribution to the thermal resistivity, demonstrating excellent agreement with experimental measurements in simple metals.

- **TL;DR**: 提出一个热力学框架，通过推广晶格上的跃迁速率方法到连续空间的守恒量，推导出简单流体热导率与稀薄气体极限值的比值表达式，该表达式仅依赖于平衡热力学性质。

A thermodynamic framework that predicts the thermal conductivity $λ$ of simple fluids beyond the dilute-gas limit is introduced. By generalizing the transition-rate approach of particles on a lattice to conserved quantities in continuous space, an expression for the ratio $λ/λ_{\rm id}$, with $λ_{\rm id}$ the dilute-gas-limit value, is derived; it depends solely on equilibrium thermodynamic properties and is therefore directly computable from any equation of state. The resulting formula quantitatively reproduces molecular-dynamics data for hard spheres throughout almost the entire fluid range, and captures the behavior of Lennard-Jones fluids in the supercritical region where thermodynamic fluctuations remain moderate. Comparison with experimental data for argon, reported by other authors, also shows very good agreement. These results provide evidence that transport coefficients of dense fluids can be expressed as their dilute-gas values multiplied by a universal thermodynamic factor.

Magnetic skyrmions stabilized by interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions (DMI) are promising candidates for applications in memory, logic, and neuromorphic computing. Beyond planar films, theoretical studies predict that curvature can influence skyrmion stability by introducing effective chiral interactions. Here, we investigate skyrmion formation on self-assembled polystyrene particles coated with Pt/Co/Ta multilayers by magnetron sputtering. Vibrating sample magnetometry reveals clear differences in the magnetic reversal behavior of the curvilinear film compared to that of the planar counterpart. Using non-invasive imaging methods such as scanning transmission X-ray microscopy and high-sensitivity in-vacuum magnetic force microscopy (MFM) with low moment magnetic tipcs, we observe a maze domain pattern for the planar films while the curvilinear film reveals three-dimensional spiraling stripe states. By employing a conventional MFM operating under ambient conditions requiring a tip with a higher magnetic moment, we demonstrate that these stripe states can rupture into metastable skyrmions located at the top of the spherical particles by applying consecutive scans. Our results demonstrate that curvilinear films offer an accessible platform for stabilizing single skyrmions using local magnetic field stimuli, opening pathways to study the interplay between interfacial and curvature-induced DMIs and enabling controlled skyrmion writing on three-dimensional magnetic architectures.

We explore symmetry-breaking phenomena in MnPS3/TMDC (MoS2, WS2, MoSe2, WSe2) heterostructures using first-principles calculations, considering two high-symmetry stacking configurations, S1 and S2, which differ not only by their interfacial registry but also by a 30° twist between the layers. Depending on the stacking geometry, the systems exhibit two distinct types of nonrelativistic spin splitting (NRSS): S2 hosts altermagnetic-like band crossings, while S1 shows global spin splitting characteristic of symmetry-breaking NRSS. Magnetic exchange and anisotropy parameters indicate that the intrinsic magnetic properties of MnPS3 are largely preserved upon interfacing. Including spin-orbit coupling, we find tunable conduction-valley splitting controlled by the MnPS3 spin orientation. Our results identify MnPS3 as a symmetry-tunable antiferromagnetic substrate capable of inducing and controlling spin and valley effects in 2D heterostructures without relying on net magnetization or strong SOC, offering a route toward nonvolatile valleytronic functionalities.

ABCB-stacked tetralayer graphene, with intrinsic spontaneous polarization, offers a unique platform to explore electron correlation effects, whose interplay with spin-orbit coupling may engender topological phases. Here, employing a $\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}$ model with self-consistent Hartree-Fock calculations, we investigate its electronic ground states. Remarkably, we find that the intrinsic polarization, in conjunction with strong interactions ($U=8 \text{ eV}$) and SOC, is sufficient to drive a $C=3$ quantum anomalous Hall state, obviating the need for an external electric field typical in ABCA stacks. Conversely, at moderate interactions ($U=6 \text{ eV}$), a minimal electric field is necessary. Furthermore, calculations predict other correlation-driven metallic phases such as quarter- and three-quarter-filled states. These results establish that the synergy of intrinsic polarization, correlations, and SOC governs the rich topological phenomena, suggesting ABCB-stacked graphene as a highly tunable platform for exploring emergent topological phenomena.

Trions, three-body bound states composed of an exciton and an additional charge, are typically fragile and require external excitation to form. Here, we report the spontaneous emergence of a stable trion gas at the surface of the layered semiconductor Ta2NiS5, revealed through angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. We observe a sharp, highly localized in-gap feature that cannot be explained by conventional band-theory. Instead, we argue that it arises from the formation of negative trions, stabilized by surface-induced band bending and the material's quasi-one-dimensional geometry. Unlike excitons, these trions form without optical pumping and persist at equilibrium, marking a rare example of an interaction-driven surface state in a nominally conventional semiconductor. Our findings establish Ta2NiS5 as a unique platform for exploring many-body physics at surfaces and open new avenues for studying and controlling collective excitations in low-dimensional systems.

The Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) was developed as a framework for understanding how the principles of statistical mechanics emerge in the long-time limit of isolated quantum many-body systems. Since then, ETH has shifted the attention towards the study of matrix elements of physical observables in the energy eigenbasis. In this work, we revisit recent developments leading to the formulation of full ETH, a generalization of the original ETH ansatz that accounts for multi-point correlation functions. Using tools from free probability, we explore the implications of local rotational invariance, a property that emerges from the statistical invariance of observables under random basis transformations induced by small perturbations of the Hamiltonian. This approach allows us to make quantitative predictions and derive an analytical characterization of subleading corrections to matrix-element correlations, thereby refining the ETH ansatz. Moreover, our analysis links the statistical properties of matrix elements under random basis changes to the empirical averages over energy windows that are usually considered when dealing with a single instance of the ensemble. We validate our analytical predictions through comparison with numerical simulations in non-integrable Floquet systems.

Charge Kondo circuits consist of metallic islands connected by single-mode quantum point contacts (QPCs). The island's charging energy makes these circuits tunable quantum simulators of various strongly interacting models. Here we propose a circuit that realizes the Kondo effect with effective Luttinger-liquid interactions, and show that it undergoes a localization transition in which the QPC transmission is fully suppressed below a critical value. Experimental signatures include a diverging charge susceptibility and an entropy step. Our findings open a path toward realizing localization transitions in more exotic settings.

We present a comprehensive optical characterization of 200-nm-thick CrN(111) films grown simultaneously on Al$_2$O$_3$(0001) and AlN/Al$_2$O$_3$(0001) using plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy. Spectroscopic ellipsometry, spanning the far-infrared to ultraviolet range (0.04 - 5.5 eV), is conducted at room temperature to determine the optical constants $n$ and $k$ of the films. Spectral fits reveal two interband transitions at approximately 0.35 and 0.60 eV. In the infrared range, the ellipsometry data also reveals a pronounced Reststrahlen band stemming from transversal and longitudinal optical phonons at approximately 403 and 629 cm$^{-1}$, respectively. The relative static and high-frequency permittivities are estimated to be about 39 and 15, respectively. A Born effective charge of approximately 2.7, extracted from the far-infrared region, indicates that CrN is partially ionic.

We study the electronic structure and dynamical correlations in antiferromagnetic BiFeO$_3$, a prototypical room-temperature multiferroic, using a variety of static and dynamical first-principles methods. Conventional static Hubbard corrections (DFT+$U$, DFT+$U$+$V$) incorrectly predict a deep-valence Fe $3d$ peak (around $-7\,\text{eV}$) in antiferromagnetic BiFeO$_3$, in contradiction with hard-X-ray photoemission. We resolve this failure by using a recent generalization of DFT+$U$ to include a frequency-dependent screening -- DFT+$U(ω)$ -- or using a dynamical Hubbard functional (dynH). The screened Coulomb interaction $U(ω)$, computed with spin-polarized RPA and projected onto maximally localized Fe $3d$ Wannier orbitals, is expressed as a sum-over-poles, yielding a self-energy that augments the Kohn--Sham Hamiltonian. This DFT+$U(ω)$ approach predicts a fundamental band gap of $1.53\,\text{eV}$, consistent with experiments, and completely eliminates the unphysical deep-valence peak. The resulting simulated HAXPES spectrum reproduces the experimental lineshape with an accuracy matching or exceeding that of far more demanding DFT+DMFT calculations. Our work demonstrates the critical nature of dynamical screening in complex oxides and establishes DFT+$U(ω)$ as a predictive, computationally efficient method for correlated materials.

We investigate the phonon magnetochiral effect (PMCE) in chiral Weyl semimetals by deriving the nonreciprocal dispersion relations of both acoustic and non-polar optical phonons in the presence of a magnetic field. Using a semiclassical Boltzmann kinetic framework that incorporates Berry curvature, orbital magnetic moment, and node-dependent electronic structure, we obtain analytic expressions for the magnetic-field-induced corrections to the phonon dynamical matrix. Inequivalent Weyl nodes with distinct Fermi velocities, Fermi energies, and relaxation times generate a dynamical chiral imbalance that alters the phonon dispersion. For acoustic phonons, the formalism yields the magnetic-field-dependent corrections to the longitudinal mode, while for optical phonons we identify an optical analogue of the PMCE that produces a corresponding shift in the optical branch. Together, these results provide a unified theoretical description of how band-geometric properties of Weyl fermions influence both acoustic and optical phonon dispersions in chiral Weyl semimetals.

The development of new battery materials, particularly novel cathode chemistries, is essential for enabling next generation energy storage technologies. In this work, we set up a screening procedure on the Energy-GNoME database for identifying novel cathode candidates. We use MACE foundational models as a first layer of screening, we assess dynamical stability and estimate the average voltage and gravimetric energy density. Following that, we apply physically motivated reasoning to identify the most promising candidates. Furthermore, we refine the average voltage prediction of selected promising candidates using DFT+U and provide the list of selected materials using this protocol. This work delivers two key outcomes: validation of the foundational MACE models high-throughput screening approach and suggestions for cathode candidates for the development of next-generation batteries. Finally, a fair comparison between the MACE predictions and the readily available figures of merit reported in the Energy GNoME database is demonstrated on the examined materials.

We uncover a class of nonlinear odd viscoelastic effects in three spatial dimensions. We show that these dissipationless effects arise upon combining strains in two orthogonal directions, yielding momentum flow in the third direction. We demonstrate that the effect arises from nontrivial geometric tensors in quantum states, and can be scaled up with integer topological invariants. We further demonstrate that the effect fingerprints the multiband Hilbert-space geometry of underlying quantum states, as encoded in three-state geometric tensors. Our findings unravel the role of multistate geometry in viscoelastic phenomena, paving a path for experimental observation of uncharted nonlinear odd viscoelastic responses in quantum systems.

- **TL;DR**: 研究发现在同一YIG/Pt异质结构中，自旋霍尔磁阻(SMR)呈高斯分布且变化较小(~10%)，但不同样品间的SMR均值差异可达~30%，表明空间变化不可忽视，主要源于界面质量的局部差异。

The spin Hall magnetoresistance (SMR) is widely used to study the interplay between charge and spin currents in bilayers of a magnetic insulator and a normal metal. However, not much is known about the spatial variation of the SMR across the surface of one and the same sample. In this work, we investigate the statistical distribution of the SMR in hundreds of nominally identical Hall bar structures patterned into prototypical yttrium iron garnet (YIG)/Pt heterostructures. We find a Gaussian-distributed SMR with a narrow standard deviation of approximately 10$\,$% of the mean value in each YIG/Pt bilayer studied. However, the variation of the mean SMR between different YIG/Pt samples can be as large as ~30$\,$%, despite nominally identical fabrication conditions. This demonstrates that spatial variations of the SMR amplitude must not be neglected, in particular when comparing different heterostructures. On a microscopic level, local variations of the interface quality captured by the spin mixing conductance are the most likely origin for the observed SMR amplitude variations.

### A Functional Field Theorem: An Explicit Proof of Axioms and Equations for Applying iSAFT in Polymer Field Theory

- **TL;DR**: 该论文建立了聚合物自洽场理论(SCFT)与界面SAFT经典密度泛函理论(iSAFT CDFT)之间的数学等价性，证明SCFT是iSAFT CDFT的勒让德对偶形式的平均场极限。

Our work establishes the mathematical equivalence between polymer Self Consistent Field Theory and interfacial SAFT based classical Density Functional Theory by providing an explicit proof that SCFT is the mean field (MF) or saddle point limit of a Legendre dual formulation of iSAFT CDFT. The polymer CDFT ideal chain term is the Legendre conjugate of the single chain generating functional built from standard SCFT propagators, so the Legendre transform converts the iSAFT CDFT Euler Lagrange equations into SCFT fixed point relations. Within this Functional Field Theory, Wertheim TPT1 association free energy can be incorporated into the excess functional, with the mass action variables providing additive SCFT fields yet leaving the propagators unchanged. Linearization about the MF solution produces a reversible mapping for fluctuation corrections, suggesting a universal response that couples the single chain correlation kernel to the iSAFT direct correlation operator, allowing the inclusion of short range structure and association cooperatively beyond mean field. Long range interactions map similarly, showing how functional derivatives can yield SCFT field contributions, while second derivatives yield the long range blocks of the iSAFT correlation operator, providing a unified treatment of polymers. Mathematically, this framework aims to clarify that SCFT and polymer DFT solvers share similar diffusion based propagators, and how iSAFT hard sphere, attraction, and association modules contribute additional field and hessian terms. Specifically, this work provides a Legendre duality proof that places SAFT CDFTs and SCFT on the same MF foundation, and a reversible theoretical framework that transfers iSAFT correlation information into SCFT, enabling modular, quantitative modeling of associating, structured polymer systems.

Topologically protected Majorana zero modes (MZMs) have attracted intense interest due to their potential application in fault-tolerant quantum computation (TQC). Graphene nanoribbons, with tunable edge terminations and compatibility with planar device architectures, offer a promising alternative to semiconductor nanowires. Here we present a comprehensive theoretical study of finite graphene strips with armchair, zigzag, and nearly square geometries, proximitized by an s-wave superconductor and subject to Rashba spin-orbit coupling, Zeeman fields, and disorder. Using exact diagonalization of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes tight-binding Hamiltonian, we analyze Majorana polarization, low-energy spectra, and real-space wavefunctions to identify the non-trivial topological phases supporting MZMs and distinguish them from from partially separated Andreev bound states (psABS) or the quasi-Majoranas. We systematically chart the robustness of these modes across geometries and disorder regimes, finding that armchair strips with short zigzag edges provide the most stable platform. Our results unify polarization diagnostics with spatial wavefunction analysis and disorder effects, yielding concrete design guidelines for graphene-based topological superconductors.

Understanding structure-property relationships in materials is fundamental in condensed matter physics and materials science. Over the past few years, machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool for advancing this understanding and accelerating materials discovery. Early ML approaches primarily focused on constructing and screening large material spaces to identify promising candidates for various applications. More recently, research efforts have increasingly shifted toward generating crystal structures using end-to-end generative models. This review analyzes the current state of generative modeling for crystal structure prediction and \textit{de novo} generation. It examines crystal representations, outlines the generative models used to design crystal structures, and evaluates their respective strengths and limitations. Furthermore, the review highlights experimental considerations for evaluating generated structures and provides recommendations for suitable existing software tools. Emerging topics, such as modeling disorder and defects, integration in advanced characterization, and incorporating synthetic feasibility constraints, are explored. Ultimately, this work aims to inform both experimental scientists looking to adapt suitable ML models to their specific circumstances and ML specialists seeking to understand the unique challenges related to inverse materials design and discovery.

Topological particle-like excitations such as skyrmions and hopfions offer rich opportunities for spintronic and photonic applications. While skyrmions have been extensively studied, the stabilization mechanisms and phase behavior of three-dimensional hopfions remain largely unexplored. Here, we investigate the formation, stability, and interactions of hopfions in thin chiral magnetic films with surface anchoring, using three-dimensional micromagnetic simulations within a material-independent framework applicable to both magnetic and liquid crystalline systems. We identify four distinct types of isolated hopfions, generated by rotating bimeron and finger-like solitons around a central axis. The metastability regions of these precursor textures closely follow the boundaries of modulated finger phases, enabling their size to be continuously tuned through anisotropydriven inflation and collapse. Remarkably, we demonstrate that hopfions near their inflation threshold possess energies comparable with the homogeneous state, allowing them to enclose regions of modulated phases or other solitons, forming higher-order, bag-like domains. In contrast, periodic hopfion lattices remain intrinsically unstable under confinement, spontaneously relaxing into finger phases. These findings establish general principles for stabilizing, tuning, and assembling three-dimensional topological solitons in confined chiral systems, suggesting experimentally accessible routes for texture engineering in liquid crystals via electric-field control.

### Generation of Ultra-Broadband Frequency Comb in Strongly Bistable Nonlinear Magnonic Resonator

Magnonic frequency combs (MFCs) offer a promising route to compact, energy-efficient platforms for on-chip coherent microwave signal generation and processing. Conventional on-chip comb generation typically relies on nonlinear resonators supporting a series of equidistant, low-loss resonances driven by a strong monochromatic signal, resulting in fixed comb spacing defined by the resonator's free spectral range (FSR). Here we introduce and experimentally demonstrate a fundamentally different mechanism for ultrabroadband MFC generation using a highly nonlinear miniaturized magnonic resonator. The small resonator volume, combined with a slow-wave transducer, yields high intra-resonator power density, driving the system deep into the bistable regime where parametric excitation of propagating spin waves facilitates comb formation. Our approach yields more than 350 comb lines spanning a 450 MHz bandwidth, with spacing continuously tunable via a two-tone external drive, representing an order-of-magnitude enhancement over prior reports while operating at relatively low power. The platform is ultra-compact (4-6 orders of magnitude smaller in size than conventional YIG sphere resonators), fully scalable, and highly tunable, enabling precise control of comb properties through magnetic bias and pump manipulation. These results establish a new paradigm for frequency comb technology, unlocking transformative opportunities in microwave signal processing, neuromorphic computing, and precision sensing.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文提出了一种光学读出方法，能够实时成像二维过渡金属硫族化合物半导体中的太赫兹频率集体模式，包括等离子体和回旋振荡。

Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) semiconductors exhibit a wide range of novel phenomena at millielectronvolt (terahertz-frequency) energy scales, including superconducting and correlation-induced insulating gaps that are frequently accompanied by symmetry breaking. However, due to the subwavelength dimensions and the often low conductivities of these systems, their intrinsic THz plasmons and meV-scale excitation gaps are difficult to access experimentally. Here we report an optical readout method that can image propagating THz-frequency collective modes in real time. The method relies on a strong coupling between the optical polarons of monolayer TMD semiconductors and the local THz fields in a waveguide, which enables us to image THz plasmons with micron scale spatial resolution and determine their propagation group velocities. Moreover, at finite magnetic fields, we observe coherent cyclotron oscillations resulting from Landau level repopulation induced by the THz field. Our findings provide a new near-field platform for probing collective excitations in strongly correlated two-dimensional semiconductors and enable "all-photonic" TMD-based architectures for time-domain THz plasmonics and optoelectronics.

Pb-based perovskites with multiple cations are fascinating materials showing various phenomena such as high piezoelectric, electromechanical, and relaxor properties. While chemical disordering accompanied by polar nanoregions and nanosized domains is commonly believed to cause the relaxor nature, little is known about ferroelectric microstructures of chemically ordered Pb-based perovskites. In this study, we discovered intriguing meandering ferroelectric domains in chemically ordered ferroelectric Pb(Sc$_{1/2}$Nb$_{1/2}$)O$_{3}$ using in-situ transmission electron microscopy with dark-field imaging. Observation results demonstrate that electric polarization can fluctuate around the [111] direction despite the formation of long-range ordered rhombohedral domains, which results in unique weak relaxor properties. In-situ imaging upon heating successfully reveals the dynamic behavior of domain-wall movements with lattice distortion and paraelectric-ferroelectric phase coexistence in the vicinity of the Curie temperature, indicating a discontinuous phase transition. Our research provides new insights into the effect of chemical ordering on ferroelectric nanodomains.

- **TL;DR**: 提出一种结合通用机器学习原子间势能（uMLIP）与时间依赖键增强方案的新模拟框架，用于高效模拟聚合和固化反应，无需系统特定参数调优。

Although polymerization and curing reactions govern the performance of advanced materials, their simulation remains challenging owing to the need for accurate, transferable potentials and rarity of chemical events. Conventional reactive force fields such as ReaxFF require system-specific parametrization, while universal machine learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs) exhibit limited sampling efficiency. This paper introduces a novel simulation framework integrating a uMLIP with a time-dependent bond-boost scheme. The bias potential increases monotonically with time, and the use of a unified parameter set across reaction classes enables consistent acceleration without system-specific tuning. For radical polymerization of vinyl monomers, the proposed framework reproduces characteristic trends, such as linear molecular-weight growth with conversion, initiator-concentration scaling, and relative monomer reactivity trends. For step-growth polycondensation of nylon-6,6, it captures the characteristic sharp increase in molecular weight at high conversion rates, consistent with experimental behavior. For epoxy curing at a copper substrate, it reveals interfacial ring-opening and cross-linking events, consistent with spectroscopic evidence of Cu-O-C bond formation. Overall, coupling uMLIPs with time-dependent bond boost enables practical and transferable simulations of polymerization and curing processes. The proposed framework reliably resolves mechanistic pathways and relative reactivity, offering molecular-level insights into polymer growth and interfacial adhesion.

We realize strongly confined quantum dots (QDs) in InAs nanowires (NWs) by combining epitaxial crystal-phase control with chemical wet etching. A strong axial confinement is first introduced by growing closely spaced wurtzite (WZ) tunnel barriers in NWs to enclose a zinc blende (ZB) QD. The NW cross-section is then reduced by isotropic etching to obtain very small QDs, with a maximum observed charging energy &gt; 30 meV. Using low-temperature electrical characterization and finite-element method simulations, we study how charging energies and the onset of electron filling scale with QD diameter. For extremely small diameters, we identify a regime where stray capacitances become non-negligible, limiting further increase in charging energy by diameter reduction alone. This approach to increasing confinement is particularly relevant for understanding the strong spin-orbit interaction observed in crystal-phase QDs, possibly linked to polarization charges at the WZ/ZB interfaces. Small diameter QDs allow considerably weaker interfering electric fields when studied, but the QDs cannot be realized with epitaxial growth alone due to a loss of crystal phase control.

We assess the accuracy of six universal machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) for predicting the temperature and pressure response of materials by molecular dynamics simulations. Accuracy is evaluated across 13 diverse materials (nine metal-organic frameworks and four inorganic compounds), computing bulk modulus, thermal expansion, and thermal decomposition. These MLIPs employ three different architectures (graph neural networks, graph network simulators, and graph transformers) with varying training datasets. We observe qualitative accuracy across these predictions but systematic underestimation of bulk modulus and overestimation of thermal expansion across all models, consistent with potential energy surface softening. From all tested models, three top performers arise; `MACE-MP-0a', `fairchem_OMAT', and `Orb-v3', with average error across metrics and materials of 41%, 44%, and 47%, respectively. Despite strong overall performance, questions arise about the limits of model transferability: dataset homogeneity and structural representation dominate model accuracy. Our results show that certain architectures can compensate for biases, a step closer to truly universal MLIPs.

Knots, characterized by topological invariants called the Hopf number $H$, arise from the intertwining of strings and exhibit diverse configurations. The knot structures have recently been observed in condensed matters, as examplified by a magnetic hopfion, sparking interest in controlling their topology. Here, we show that spin-orbit torque (SOT) enables dynamic manipulation of the Hopf number of magnetic hopfions. We investigate the SOT-driven evolution of hopfions, revealing the splitting of a high-$H$ hopfion into multiple lower-$H$ ones, a process that can be quantified by an effective tension picture. Comparative analysis across different $H$ uncovers a hierarchy of instabilities that dictates these dynamical topological transitions. These findings establish SOT as a powerful tool for controlling hopfion topology, paving the way for potential applications in topological memory devices.

Understanding the structure and dynamics of Earth's inner core is essential for constraining its composition, thermal evolution, and seismic properties. Silicon is a probable major component of Earth's core. Using first-principles molecular dynamics and thermodynamic modeling, we investigate the structural, elastic, and transport properties of Fe-Si alloys at high pressures and temperatures. By computing the Gibbs free energies of B2, hcp, fcc, and bcc solid solutions, we construct the Fe-Si phase diagram applicable to the Earth's inner core. Our results reveal a pronounced miscibility gap between hcp and B2 Fe-Si, with the two phases coexisting over the compositional range of 6-11 wt% Si at 6000 K. The B2 Fe-Si alloy exhibits strong single-crystal shear anisotropy (22.9% at 6000 K) compared to the nearly isotropic hcp phase (0.6%), and yields a shear wave velocity (3.73 km/s) and Poisson's ratio consistent with seismological observations. Moreover, the computed transport properties reveal substantially lower thermal conductivity of B2 Fe-Si relative to pure iron or hcp Fe-Si under inner-core conditions. These results imply that Earth's inner core likely comprises multiple phases, whose distribution and crystallographic texture critically influence its seismic and thermal properties.

Hopfions--three-dimensional topological solitons with knotted spin texture--have recently garnered attention in topological magnetism due to their unique topology characterized by the Hopf number $H$, a topological invariant derived from knot theory. In contrast to two-dimensional skyrmions, which are typically limited to small topological invariants, i.e., skyrmion numbers, hopfions can, in principle, be stabilized with arbitrary Hopf numbers. However, the nonequilibrium dynamics, especially interconversion between different Hopf numbers, remain poorly understood. Here, we theoretically investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of hopfions with various Hopf numbers by numerically solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation with spin-orbit torque (SOT). For $H=1$, we show that SOT induces both translational and precessional motion, with dynamics sensitive to the initial orientation. For $H=2$, we find that intermediate SOT strengths can forcibly split the hopfion into two $H = 1$ hopfions. This behavior is explained by an effective tension picture, derived from the dynamics observed in the $H=1$ case. By comparing the splitting dynamics across different $H$, we identify a hierarchical structure governing SOT-driven behavior and use it to predict the dynamics of hopfions with general $H$. Furthermore, we show that by appropriately scheduling the time dependence of the SOT, it is possible to repeatedly induce both splitting and recombination of hopfions. These results demonstrate the controllability of hopfion topology via SOT and suggest a pathway toward multilevel spintronic devices based on topology switching.

Excitons, the correlated electron-hole pairs governing optical and transport properties in organic semiconductors, have long resisted direct experimental access to their full quantum-mechanical wave functions. Here, we use femtosecond time-resolved photoemission orbital tomography (trPOT), combining high-harmonic probe pulses with time- and momentum-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy, to directly image the momentum-space distribution and ultrafast dynamics of excitons in $α$-sexithiophene thin films. We introduce a quantitative model that enables reconstruction of the exciton wave function in real space, including both its spatial extent and its internal phase structure. The reconstructed wave function reveals coherent delocalization across approximately three molecular units and exhibits a characteristic phase modulation, consistent with ab initio calculations within the framework of many-body perturbation theory. Time-resolved measurements further show a $\sim 20$\% contraction of the exciton radius within 400 fs, providing direct evidence of self-trapping driven by exciton-phonon coupling. These results establish trPOT as a general and experimentally accessible approach for resolving exciton wave functions -- with spatial, phase, and temporal sensitivity -- in a broad class of molecular and low-dimensional materials.

Topology, as a mathematical concept, has been introduced into condensed matter physics since the discovery of quantum Hall effect, which characterizes new physical scenario beyond the Landau theory. The topologically protected physical quantities, such as the dissipationless quantum transport of edge/surface states as well as magnetic/dipole quasi-particles like skyrmions/bimerons, have attracted great research enthusiasms in the past decades. In recent years, another kind of topology in condensed matter was revealed in the magnetoelectric parameter space of multiferroics, which deepens our understanding of magnetoelectric physics. This topical review summarizes recent advances in this area, involving three type-II multiferroics. With magnetism-induced ferroelectricity, topological behaviors can be manifested during the magnetoelectric switching processes driven by magnetic/electric fields, such as Roman-surface/Riemann-surface magnetoelectricity and magnetic crankshaft. These exotic topological magnetoelectric behaviors may be helpful to pursuit energy-efficient and precise-control devices for spintronics and quantum computing.

Ready-to-use numerical toolbox for nanodiamond Raman spectra calculation and fit is presented. The developed theoretical approach allows accounting for arbitrary nanoparticle size-distribution and the microscopic line broadening mechanisms for the optical phonons. The two tools for solving the inverse problem of the nanodiamond properties reconstruction using a known Raman spectrum are provided. The first one utilizes a dense neural network trained on a vast array of synthetic Raman spectra. The second approach is based on the stochastic Metropolis algorithm, which updates the ensemble parameters by small quantities, tending to the state with minimal error. Both methods are available thanks to the computationally instant elasticity theory-like model for optical phonon modes in diamond nanocrystals that accurately reproduces the results of the atomistic approaches. Using experimental Raman spectra for nanodiamonds prepared by various techniques, we tested our tools and observed a faithful agreement with the data as well as between the two methods. The open and documented software is accessible online (nanoraman.pythonanywhere.com) and as a Python module (github.com/KoniakhinSV/Nanoparticle_Raman).

- **TL;DR**: 通过CsCl种子层改善共蒸发钙钛矿在MeO-2PACz上的生长，消除界面PbI2，实现30.3%效率的钙钛矿-硅叠层太阳能电池

Monolithic perovskite-silicon tandem solar cells experienced a significant increase in efficiency, making them viable for industrial applications. Among the various scalable and industry-compatible metal halide perovskite deposition techniques, co-evaporation stands out as particularly well-suited for perovskite-silicon tandem solar cells due to its ability to conformally cover textured silicon bottom cells. Solution-processed [2-(3,6-Dimethoxy-9H-carbazol-9-yl)ethyl]phosphonic acid (MeO-2PACz) is commonly used as a hole-transporting material for co-evaporated metal halide perovskites. However, we show that it covers the textured surface of silicon bottom cells unevenly, impacting the film growth and leading to the formation of residual PbI2 at the buried interface. The present study reveals via X-ray photoemission electron microscopy (XPEEM) and infrared scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscope (IR s-SNOM) that a CsCl seed layer fosters organic precursor incorporation across the MeO-2PACz/perovskite interface, even in the areas with a thin MeO-2PACz layer, thereby preventing the formation of interfacial PbI2 and leading to larger apparent grains. The improvement of the metal halide perovskite film quality on the MeO-2PACz/perovskite interface and the bulk perovskite film led to 30.3% (29.7% certified) efficient perovskite-silicon tandem solar cell. The present work highlights the importance of a seed layer for a robust growth of co-evaporated metal halide perovskite and represents an important milestone for the transfer of perovskite-silicon tandem solar cells from laboratory to industry.

Transition metal dichalcogenides provide a platform for exploring spin-valley physics, offering a promising approach to electric-field-driven spin control for low-power spintronic and quantum devices. Here, we demonstrate electric-field-induced spin splitting in the Q and Q' valleys of multilayer n-type WSe2 using quantum-point-contact spectroscopy. Systematic modulations in four distinct conductance quantization steps, providing direct evidence of spin-valley-layer coupling-driven spin-resolved density of states, were achieved by tuning the out-of-plane gate voltage. Notably, the electric-field-induced spin splitting significantly dominated the magnetic-field-induced Zeeman effect (e.g., ~ 6 meV for a displacement field change of ~ 0.04 V/nm vs. ~ 1 meV for a magnetic field of 9 T), demonstrating a powerful, non-magnetic manipulation of spin states. This ability to manipulate spin states by gate voltage is crucial for advancing next-generation low-power spintronic and quantum information technologies.

Hybrid organic--inorganic perovskites with broken inversion symmetry provide a fertile ground for uncovering coupled spin-orbit and ferroelectric phenomena. Here, we investigate the layered family (PA)$_2$CsY$_2$X$_7$ (Y = Pb, Sn; X = I, Br) using density functional theory, Berry-phase polarization analysis, and effective $\boldsymbol{k \cdot p}$ modeling. Across all four members, we find indirect bandgaps with extrema near $Γ$, sizable spin splittings at both band edges, and robust in-plane ferroelectric polarization that stabilizes out-of-plane persistent spin textures (PSTs). Crucially, polarization reversal switches the spin orientation, enabling electrical control of PSTs and thereby non-volatile manipulation of spin states. These results establish (PA)$_2$CsY$_2$X$_7$ as a versatile materials platform where compositional design and ferroelectric switching jointly enable spintronic functionality.

Spin qubits have proven to be a feasible candidate for quantum computation, and some realizations of spin qubits already benefit from advanced device manufacturing in the semiconductor industry. Compared to superconducting platforms, spin qubits can operate at higher temperatures from tens of millikelvin up to a few kelvin. However, recent experiments show a non-trivial and often non-monotonic dependence of the spin qubit frequency on the temperature, featuring a region of decreased sensitivity to temperature fluctuations. In this work, we aim to gain insight into the physics behind such temperature shifts in the low-temperature limit. Investigating the spin qubits' interaction with phonon modes of the host material, we can explain some of the key features of the observed behavior and estimate the temperature sweet spot for the qubit frequency shift.

Neuromorphic computing is at the basis of the recent progress in artificial intelligence. But the progress is accompanied with increasing demands in computational resources and power supply. Reservoir neuromorphic computing uses a non-linear physical system to replace a part of a large neural network. The advantages can include reduced power consumption and faster learning. We show that the interference in an organic crystal waveguide resonator leads to efficient separation of optical patterns, allowing a significant reduction of the size of the neural network and an acceleration of the learning process. For more complex symbols, extending the reservoir output dimension thanks to spin-orbit coupling, we achieve a 10-times reduction of the network size and a 3-fold speedup. Our work suggests a general path for the performance improvement of photonic reservoir computing systems.

- **TL;DR**: 通过电化学刻蚀制备多孔GaN分布式布拉格反射镜，首次利用FIB-SEM断层扫描进行三维表征，提出"级联"模型解释刻蚀机制，发现高电压下更易形成连续结构。

Fabrication of porous GaN distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs) via the selective electrochemical etching (ECE) of conductive Si-doped layers, separated by non-intentionally doped (NID) layers, provides a straightforward methodology for producing highly reflective DBRs suitable for device overgrowth and integration, which has otherwise proven difficult in the III-nitride epitaxial system via conventional alloying. Such photonic materials can be fabricated by a lithography-free defect-driven etching process, where threading dislocations intrinsic to heteroepitaxy form nanoscale channels that facilitate etchant transport through NID layers. Here, we report the first three-dimensional characterisation of porous GaN-on-Si DBRs fabricated in this methodology with different ECE voltages, using serial-section tomography in a focused ion beam scanning electron microscope (FIB-SEM). These datasets reconstruct the pore morphology as etching proliferates through the alternating Si-doped/NID layer stack. Volumetric reconstruction enabled us to enhance the established `kebab' model for defect-driven etching by proposing a `cascade' model where etchant cascades through the material via vertical etching down nanopipes and horizontal etching across pores, forming complex networks directly related to the pathways taken. This accounts for premature nanopipe termination and discontinuities in nanopipe formation, where dislocations are observed to activate and deactivate individually. Statistical analysis of individual etching behaviour, across all dislocations for each tomograph, revealed a greater tendency to form continuous structures that follow conventional kebab behaviour at higher ECE voltages. We propose that higher ECE voltages alter the probability of dislocation etching relative to doped layer etching, thereby empowering morphological optimization through improved mechanistic understanding of ECE.

We consider a quantum ring placed in a gyrotropic cavity characterized by the energy splitting between the left and right circularly polarized modes. We show that despite the absence of constant magnetic field penetrating through the ring, in the regime of the ultrastrong light matter coupling, the total current in the ground state changes discontinuously with the light matter coupling in the direct analogy with the Aharonov-Bohm ring. We consider the driven-dissipative of the system and show that the discontinuous change of the total angular momentum can be directly probed via the spectral and statical properties of the radiation emitted by the system under weak coherent drive.

- **TL;DR**: 研究通过原子探针层析技术分析了Pt和PtPd合金催化剂在NO氧化反应中的动态氧化态变化，发现其可逆氧化还原行为与NO转化率的逆滞后现象相关。

In this study, the dynamic oxidation state changes of pure Pt and 50at% PtPd alloy catalysts were investigated during a temperature ramp from 80 to 450 C under a reactive gas mixture of 500 ppm NO and 3 % Oxygen in Nitrogen atmosphere. These changes are closely correlated with variations in NO conversion efficiency. Sharp tip specimens were prepared from Pt and PtPd alloy wires by electrochemical polishing and Focused Ion Beam annular milling, with the hemispherical apex serving as a model for nanoscale catalyst surfaces. The samples were exposed to the reactive atmosphere in a dedicated reaction chamber and subsequently analyzed using atom probe tomography. Effective oxide thicknesses and three-dimensional surface morphology were quantitatively evaluated. A pronounced decrease in oxide thickness was observed during the first cooling and second heating cycles, particularly below 200 C, indicating reversible redox behavior on both Pt and PtPd alloy surfaces. This behavior correlates with the inverse hysteresis of NO conversion measured for both systems, suggesting that the redox reversibility is driven primarily by reaction kinetics rather than thermodynamic stability.

### Electric-circuit analog of Landau-Zener tunneling using time-varying elements

- **TL;DR**: 该论文提出了一种时变电路来模拟量子Landau-Zener隧穿现象，发现尽管运动方程不同且系统不守恒，电路LZT概率仍遵循量子LZT规律，为在经典系统中模拟时间依赖量子模型提供了新方法。

Landau-Zener tunneling (LZT) is a fundamental dynamical phenomenon, ubiquitous in various quantum systems. Here, we propose a time-varying electric circuit to address the question of whether the quantum LZT can occur in classical systems. Although the underlying differential equation of motion is quite different from the Schrödinger equation and the instantaneous frequency spectrum of the proposed circuit is not linear, the probability of the LZT in circuits (circuit LZT for short), based on our new definition for norm-unconserved systems, still follows the laws of the LZT in quantum systems, co-determined by the linear sweeping rate $α'$ and the frequency gap $Δ$, i.e., approaching the analytical value $\exp(-πΔ^2/2α')$, regardless of whether the coupling is reciprocal or nonreciprocal. The deep relationship between the circuit LZT and its quantum counterpart can be established through a linearization and block-diagonalization process. Our proposal provides a general method for simulating time-dependent quantum models using time-varying electric circuits, which has been lacking in previous studies, and paves the way for studying more complicated LZT and other dynamical phenomena in circuits and other classical systems.

We demonstrate that moving edge dislocations can induce the reversal of magnetization in a ferromagnetic film due to the Barnett effect. The dynamics of magnetization is studied numerically within a discretized Landau-Lifshitz equation on a hexagonal lattice containing over $10^5$ sites. Local coordinate frames coupled to the crystallographic axes for each spin are used together with the laboratory coordinate frame. The parameters of a hexagonal close-packed cobalt lattice have been chosen for illustration. The magnetization reversal from a metastable initial state created by the external magnetic field occurs on a time scale of a few picoseconds. Our results imply that fast local elastic twists generated by moving dislocations serve as an important mechanism of magnetization dynamics in solids subjected to a mechanical stress.

We develop a systematic framework for constructing all-bands-flat (ABF) lattice Hamiltonians that explicitly break time-reversal symmetry (TRS). By threading magnetic flux through disconnected polygonal plaquettes and applying local entangling unitary transformations, we map plaquettes onto families of ABF models in one, two, and three dimensions. This procedure preserves the flux configuration while converting semi-detangled geometries into ABF lattices with nontrivial hopping structure. The resulting flat bands admit compact localized states (CLSs) whose support includes both the flux-threaded plaquettes and auxiliary sites introduced by the unitary transformations. In these TRS-broken constructions, the CLSs host localized circulatory currents whose magnitude depends on the applied flux. We further extend the framework to lattices with coexisting flat and dispersive bands, illustrating cases with both orthogonal and non-orthogonal CLSs. Our results provide a controlled route for generating dispersionless lattices supporting flux-induced local currents.

### Non-local Chemistry Driven by Cation-Anion Size Disparity in Helium Inserted Compounds under High Pressure

Opposing the theory that Helium (He) cannot be inserted into AB-type ionic compounds due to the Madelung energy increase, our crystal structure search and first-principles calculations found that He can form stable compounds with sodium halides (NaX, X=Cl, Br, I) under high-pressure. These reactions are driven by the non-local chemistry arising from the cation-anion size disparity, distinctly different from the He insertion reaction with A2B-type compounds. The large size differences between Na+ and X- enable structures that can effectively host He insertions through volume and inter-atomic distance disproportionation. Furthermore, the insertion of He atoms can significantly relieve the elevated Madelung energy that builds up in NaX under high pressure. This energy increase arises from structural transitions driven by cation-anion size disparity, which are necessary for reducing volume under pressure. The insertion of He allows the reduction of the total volume under high pressure without increasing the Madelung energy. Our predicted compounds and stability analysis reveal a new example of He reactivity governed not by local chemical bond formation, but by long-range electrostatic interactions.

Engineering dissipative dynamics in open quantum systems is under active focus, especially in topological settings where resilient edge modes are expected to exhibit decay rates distinct from the bulk. In this letter, we propose an efficient dynamical scheme to discern such long-lived excitations. Employing a Floquet-Lindblad framework, we explore how periodic driving reshapes the key features of a paradigmatic topological model, namely a Creutz ladder. Our results bear testimony to a drive-induced unipolar-bipolar transition in the Liouvillian skin effect, which gets dynamically manifested as a chiral-helical damping crossover. Such a transition effectively rescales the bulk localization length, giving rise to a polarization drift that we identify as a new invariant for efficient diagnosis of the nontrivial phases. As the transition becomes more gradual via tuning drive-rescaled parameters, we uncover signatures of a scale-free localization where skin and extended modes co-exist with distinct decay rates. The emergent hierarchy of the decay rates yields two disparate timescales: a chiral wavefront that rapidly empties the bulk followed by a long-lived regime dominated by robust edge modes. Overall, our results provide convincing evidence that periodic driving serves as a powerful handle to manipulate dissipative topological phases and dynamically isolate the boundary modes.

A quantitative description of the exchange interaction in quantum dots is relevant for modeling gate operations of spin qubits. By measuring the amplitude and frequency of exchange-driven qubit state oscillations, we measure the detuning dependence of the exchange coupling in a GaAs double quantum dot over three orders of magnitude. Both 1D and 3D full configuration interaction simulations can replicate the observed behavior. Extending a Hubbard model by including excited states increases the range of detuning where it provides a good fit, thus elucidating the underlying physics.

We formulate the tight-binding model for cubic $α$-Sn based on the DFT calculations. In the model, we incorporate a variable bond angle, which allows us to simulate the effect of the in-plane strain. In the bulk, we demonstrate the presence of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant and a non-zero mirror Chern number, making $α$-Sn one of the rare cases where dual topology can be observed. We calculate the topological phase diagram of multi-layer $α$-Sn as a function of strain and number of layers. We find that a non-trivial quantum spin Hall state appears only for compressive strain above five layers of thickness. Quite surprisingly, both in the trivial and non-trivial phases, we find a plethora of edge-states with energies inside the bulk gap of the system. Some of these states are localized at the side surfaces of the slab, some of them prefer top/bottom surfaces and some are localized in the hinges. We trace the microscopic origin of these states back to a minimal model that supports chiral symmetry and multiple one-dimensional winding numbers that take different values in different directions in the Brillouin zone.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文研究了片上太赫兹光谱中二维材料的有限尺寸和环境效应，识别了真正的Drude响应条件，并发现了一种可能被误判为Drude响应的"幻影Drude"响应机制。

On-chip THz spectroscopy enables quantitative measurements of the optical conductivity of sub-wavelength 2D materials by tightly confining THz fields in metallic transmission line structures interfaced to the material. However, because the probed structures are smaller than the THz wavelength, finite-size and environmental effects can strongly influence the measured response. Here, we identify the conditions under which a metallic sample exhibits a genuine Drude response and when finite-size and environmental effects must be considered. We further introduce and characterize an additional regime, the Phantom-Drude response, which mimics Drude behavior but instead originates from the superposition of multiple finite-momentum plasmonic resonances. If unrecognized, this regime can lead to misinterpretation of intrinsic material properties. We systematically show how the Phantom-Drude response can emerge and demonstrate its sensitivity to sample dimensions, transmission line geometry, material shape, and gate properties, providing practical guidelines to avoid this regime in future on-chip THz measurements.

### Wilson loops, symmetries, and selective bulk-boundary correspondence in higher-order topological insulators

- **TL;DR**: 该研究探讨了手性对称Bloch哈密顿量中的高阶体边对应关系，提出了新的动量空间诊断工具来表征Wannier能带拓扑，并揭示了镜像对称破缺对边界能隙的选择性关闭机制。

We investigate the higher-order bulk-boundary correspondence in a family of chiral-symmetric Bloch Hamiltonians. These models generalize the $π$-flux square lattice, the prototypical topological quadrupole insulator, and include both separable and nonseparable models with extended and diagonal hopping. For separable systems, the product of subsystem chiral winding numbers correctly predicts the number of zero-energy corner states. However, this invariant fails in nonseparable models, motivating the development of new momentum-space diagnostics. We introduce gauge-independent mirror-filtered winding numbers for Wannier Hamiltonians, constructed by projecting mirror eigenstates onto the occupied subspace. Furthermore, by adapting periodicized Wilson lines from chiral Floquet theory to the case with momentum-dependent chiral operator, we define new invariants associated directly with Wannier gaps. These invariants provide a detailed characterization of Wannier band topology. Beyond symmetric models, we show that certain patterns of mirror-symmetry breaking induce selective boundary gap closings confined to a single boundary orientation while the bulk and other boundaries remain gapped. This mechanism extends to three dimensions, yielding hinge- and corner-selective transitions. Our results clarify the interplay between chiral symmetry, mirror symmetry, and Wilson loops in higher-order topological phases and point to open challenges in formulating momentum-space invariants for general nonseparable models.
