This paper presents a Physics-\textit{Explainable AI} (XAI) framework to validate and interpret neural networks for the constitutive modeling of solid materials. The study bridges the gap between data-driven models and continuum mechanics by applying a suite of explainability methods to neural networks trained on three distinct material behaviors: hyperelasticity (\textit{Mooney-Rivlin}), elastoplasticity (\textit{Chaboche}), and viscoelasticity (\textit{Fractional Zener}). First, high-fidelity surrogate models, including dense feed-forward networks, LSTMs, and GRUs, are trained on synthetically generated data to accurately capture complex material responses. The core of the work then employs XAI techniques to "open the black box" and confirm that the networks learn physically meaningful principles. For hyperelasticity, gradient-based attributions (\textit{Grad Input} (GI)) successfully match the analytical tangent modulus, proving the network learned material stiffness. For elastoplasticity, \textit{SHapley Additive exPlanations} (SHAP) and \textit{Principal Component Analysis} (PCA) demonstrate the \textit{Recurrent Neural Network} (RNN) internalizes path-dependent memory, with SHAP identifying \textit{plastic strain} as the dominant feature governing the stress prediction. For viscoelasticity, latent-space and wavelet analyses of the \textit{Gated Recurrent Unit. } GRU layers reveal a clear temporal hierarchy, with different layers encoding instantaneous elastic response, intermediate relaxation, and long-term fractional memory. Ultimately, the study demonstrates that the XAI framework can verify that the neural networks are not merely curve-fitting but are, in fact, learning the underlying physical mechanisms of stiffness, history-dependence, and temporal damping.

- **TL;DR**: 研究混合脉冲激光沉积中碳污染机制，发现生长温度和有机硫前驱体压力对硫化物薄膜碳掺入和织构的影响规律

Vapor-pressure-mismatched materials, such as transition metal chalcogenides, have emerged as key electronic, photonic, and quantum materials. Hybrid pulsed laser deposition (hPLD) has become a preferred method for epitaxial or textured growth of these materials; however, unintentional carbon (C) incorporation remains a persistent concern, particularly when using organic chalcogen precursors as safer alternatives to toxic hydrides. The mechanisms governing C incorporation and its impact on film growth and properties in hPLD remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate the influence of C-containing side products generated from organosulfur precursor pyrolysis on ZnS, BaTiS$_3$, and TiS$_2$ thin films grown by hPLD using tert-butyl disulfide (TBDS). Structural characterization via X-ray diffraction and atomic force microscopy, combined with secondary ion mass spectrometry, is used to systematically examine the effects of growth temperature and TBDS partial pressure on film morphology, crystallinity, and C incorporation. Optimal growth temperatures of 400°C, 500°C, and 700°C are identified for ZnS, TiS$_2$, and BaTiS$_3$, respectively. Growth above or below these temperatures leads to increased C incorporation at both the interface and within the film, correlating with degraded texture. In contrast, highly textured films exhibit minimal C content, comparable to films grown without TBDS. For TiS$_2$, C incorporation depends strongly on TBDS pressure, with 10$^{-1}$ Pa identified as the optimal pressure for minimizing contamination. At higher pressures, loss of preferential texture is observed, likely due to C graphitization poisoning the interface and bulk. These results provide new insight into process-induced C impurities in hPLD-grown chalcogenide thin films and have important implications for sulfide-based thin film technologies.

- **TL;DR**: 通过G₀W₀和Bethe-Salpeter方程计算研究PbTiO₃从立方顺电相到四方铁电相转变过程中激子光谱的演化，发现铁电极化畸变导致吸收峰分裂和面内/面外各向异性，为电场调控光学吸收提供了理论基础。

PbTiO$_3$ is a ferroelectric perovskite semiconductor with favourable electronic and optical properties, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, including photo-catalysis and (opto)electronic devices. Despite its relevance, an accurate ab-initio description of the optical absorption spectrum and of the impact of ferroelectric distortion on the excitonic properties is still lacking. We combine $G_0W_0$ and Bethe-Salpeter Equation calculations to investigate the electronic and optical properties of PbTiO$_3$, tracking the evolution of its excitonic spectrum along the transition from the cubic paraelectric to the tetragonal ferroelectric phase. As the polar distortion increases, the first absorption peak of the cubic phase splits into two distinct features due to symmetry breaking, which partially lifts the degeneracy of the underlying excitonic state. Crucially, the distortion further introduces an in-plane/out-of-plane anisotropy in the spectra and controls the energy separation between the resulting excitonic branches. These findings highlight the potential for tuning the optical absorption properties of PbTiO$_3$ via the application of an external electric field.

- **TL;DR**: 开发了用于复杂金属硅酸盐的端到端机器学习势函数工作流，包含两种专门训练的MTP势函数，实现了实验验证的准确模拟

The structural hierarchy and chemical flexibility of metallosilicates enable broad technological applications, yet they also make it challenging to uncover structure--property relations. Previous large-scale atomistic simulations have provided mechanistic insight, but their accuracy and achievable model complexity remain constrained by the available interatomic potentials. Here, we present an end-to-end workflow for developing accurate and efficient machine-learning potentials, specifically moment tensor potentials (MTPs), tailored for structurally and chemically complex systems such as metallosilicates. The workflow integrates de novo structure generation, surface functionalization, and property evaluation. A domain-specific training strategy is employed: Configurations associated with melt--quench generation and subsequent functionalization train the syn-MTP, whereas configurations near equilibrium train the eq-MTP. We apply the workflow to prototypical metallosilicates, i.e., aluminosilicates, which we also experimentally synthesize and characterize for benchmarking the simulations. The syn-MTP reliably generates amorphous aluminosilicates that match experimental density and pair distribution functions measured with synchrotron X-ray diffraction. The eq-MTP reproduces experimental infrared spectra and surface hydroxyl densities, along with density-functional-theory-derived dehydrogenation energies, demonstrating meta-GGA-level accuracy and validating the end-to-end workflow. Finally, we showcase the applicability of the developed potentials by predicting infrared spectra of functionalized porous aluminosilicates. This study establishes a robust path toward accurate modeling of realistic metallosilicates under operando-relevant conditions.

We develop a rigorous topological theory of anomalies on the lattice, which are obstructions to gauging global symmetries and the existence of trivial symmetric states. We also construct $Ω$-spectra of a class of invertible states and quantum cellular automata, which allows us to classify both anomalies and symmetry protected topological phases up to blend equivalence.

We demonstrate that the recent observations of spatial oscillations in the energy position of the superconducting coherence peaks in the cuprate, transition metal dichalcogenide, iron-based and heavy-fermion superconductors are consistent with the possible presence of a pair-, charge- or spin-density-wave phase. We show that for all three cases, the spatial oscillations of the superconducting order parameter, $Δ({\bf r})$ can be imaged via the critical Josephson current, $I_c({\bf r})$ measured in Josephson scanning tunneling spectroscopy experiments. Finally, we show that the spatial oscillations of the density waves and of $Δ({\bf r})$ exhibit relative phase shifts of $Δφ= 0$ or $π$ for a charge-density wave, and $Δφ=π/2$ for the spin-density wave.

### Efficient Quantum Simulation of Non-Adiabatic Molecular Dynamics with Precise Electronic Structure

- **TL;DR**: 该研究开发了量子计算适应的非绝热分子动力学方法，结合曲率驱动跳跃修正和亚微哈特里精度势能面计算协议，为量子计算在化学动力学模拟中的实际应用铺平道路。

In the study of non-adiabatic chemical processes such as photocatalysis and photosynthesis, non-adiabatic molecular dynamics (NAMD) is an indispensable theoretical tool, which requires precise potential energy surfaces (PESs) of ground and excited states. Quantum computing offers promising potential for calculating PESs that are intractable for classical computers. However, its realistic application poses significant challenges to the development of quantum algorithms that are sufficiently general to enable efficient and precise PES calculations across chemical systems with diverse properties, as well as to seamlessly adapt existing NAMD theories to quantum computing. In this work, we introduce a quantum-adapted extension to the Landau-Zener-Surface-Hopping (LZSH) NAMD. This extension incorporates curvature-driven hopping corrections that protect the population evolution while maintaining the efficiency gained from avoiding the computation of non-adiabatic couplings (NACs), as well as preserving the trajectory independence that enables parallelization. Furthermore, to ensure the high-precision PESs required for surface hopping dynamics, we develop a sub-microhartree-accurate PES calculation protocol. This protocol supports active space selection, enables parallel acceleration either on quantum or classical clusters, and demonstrates adaptability to diverse chemical systems - including the charged H3+ ion and the C2H4 molecule, a prototypical multi-reference benchmark. This work paves the way for practical application of quantum computing in NAMD, showcasing the potential of parallel simulation on quantum-classical heterogeneous clusters for ab-initio computational chemistry.

Development of spintronic and quantum computing devices increases demand for efficient, energy saving method of spin manipulation at molecular scale. Polyoxovanadate molecular magnets being susceptible to both electric and magnetic fields may serve here as a good base material. In this paper two isostructural anions [V$_{12}$As$_8$O$_{40}$(HCO$_2$)]$^{n-}$ (with $n=3,5$) featuring two different mixed-valence states with itinerant and localized valence electrons are studied. The impact of the electric field on their magnetic properties is investigated by means of two complementary methods informed by magnetic measurements: effective Hamiltonian calculations and density functional theory. It is demonstrated that the magnetoelectric effect in theses molecules is induced mostly by relocation of itinerant electrons, is highly anisotropic, depends on the valence state and can be detected even at room temperature. These findings can pave the way to practical applications in which an electric field control over spin state is required.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究证明了香农信息熵与玻尔兹曼/吉布斯热力学熵在真实凝聚态系统中是定量等价的，通过将原子构型视为信息源，直接从分子动力学轨迹的可压缩性计算熵值。

We demonstrate that Shannon's information entropy and the thermodynamic entropy of Boltzmann and Gibbs are quantitatively equivalent for real condensed-matter systems. By interpreting atomic configurations as information sources, we compute entropy directly from the compressibility of molecular-dynamics trajectories, without physical partitioning or empirical modeling. A custom lossy-compression algorithm measures the minimum number of bits required to describe a microstate at finite precision, and this bit count maps exactly to thermodynamic entropy through the Shannon-Boltzmann relation. The method reproduces benchmark entropies for metals, semiconductors, oxides, and refractory ceramics in both solid and liquid phases, establishing information as the fundamental quantity underlying thermodynamic disorder. This equivalence unifies information theory and statistical mechanics, providing a general and computationally efficient framework for determining entropies and free energies directly from atomic data.

- **TL;DR**: Sol(Di)$^2$T是一个可微分的数字孪生框架，用于太阳能电池的端到端优化，从材料特性到气候条件，实现能量产出的最大化预测和优化。

Maximizing energy yield (EY) - the total electric energy generated by a solar cell within a year at a specific location - is crucial in photovoltaics (PV), especially for emerging technologies. Computational methods provide the necessary insights and guidance for future research. However, existing simulations typically focus on only isolated aspects of solar cells. This lack of consistency highlights the need for a framework unifying all computational levels, from material to cell properties, for accurate prediction and optimization of EY prediction. To address this challenge, a differentiable digital twin, Sol(Di)$^2$T, is introduced to enable comprehensive end-to-end optimization of solar cells. The workflow starts with material properties and morphological processing parameters, followed by optical and electrical simulations. Finally, climatic conditions and geographic location are incorporated to predict the EY. Each step is either intrinsically differentiable or replaced with a machine-learned surrogate model, enabling not only accurate EY prediction but also gradient-based optimization with respect to input parameters. Consequently, Sol(Di)$^2$T extends EY predictions to previously unexplored conditions. Demonstrated for an organic solar cell, the proposed framework marks a significant step towards tailoring solar cells for specific applications while ensuring maximal performance.

### Effective Mass of a Migrating Interface

- **TL;DR**: 研究发现晶界在高频振荡加载下表现出惯性行为，并提出了测量其有效质量的方法，挑战了传统将界面视为无质量几何边界的观点。

Interfaces in materials are often treated as massless geometric boundaries, and many kinetic models adopt an overdamped assumption. In this Letter, we show that grain boundaries exhibit inertial behavior under high-frequency oscillatory loading and introduce a quantitative method to determine their effective mass from the phase lag between the applied force and interface velocity. The measured effective mass correlates with the mass of atoms participating in interface migration. Using this advance, we reassess prevailing theories and identify regimes where the inertial term materially affects interfacial kinetics, particularly at high frequencies relevant to thermal fluctuations. These results motivate incorporating an effective mass into kinetic descriptions, providing a clearer basis for modeling and interpreting interface migration.

### $J_1-J_2$ Triangular Lattice Antiferromagnet in a Magnetic Field

We investigate the spin-1/2 $J_1-J_2$ triangular-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet in a magnetic field by combining large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations with self-consistent spin-wave theory. The resulting field-coupling phase diagram reveals that quantum fluctuations stabilize coplanar order across the entire parameter range, giving rise to a characteristic sequence of magnetization plateaux. Near the quantum-spin-liquid window $0.06 \lesssim J_2/J_1 \lesssim 0.14$, which extends to magnetic field $B \sim J_1$, we identify overlapping $m = 1/3$ and $m = 1/2$ plateaux - a distinctive hallmark of the system's proximity to the low-field spin-liquid regime. The excellent quantitative agreement between DMRG and self-consistent one-loop spin-wave calculations demonstrates that semiclassical approaches can reliably capture and parameterize the plateau phases of triangular quantum antiferromagnets.

Inferring microscopic couplings in multi-component superconductors directly from vortex configurations is a challenging inverse problem. In Type-1.5 systems, Time-Dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) dynamics generate complex, glassy vortex patterns with high metastability. We explicitly quantify this intractability by analyzing the Hessian spectrum of the energy landscape, revealing a proliferation of soft modes that hinders traditional sampling. We address this challenge by combining a differentiable TDGL solver with Simulation-Based Inference (SBI). Our approach treats the solver as a stochastic forward model mapping physical parameters (θ = (η, B, ν)) to vortex density fields. Using Neural Ratio Estimation (NRE), we train a classifier to approximate the likelihood-to-evidence ratio and perform Bayesian inference for the interband Josephson coupling from vortex density fields. On synthetic data, the proposed method reliably recovers the coupling with calibrated uncertainty.

### Enhanced particle diffusion in fluctuating binary environments

We investigate single-particle diffusion in a two-state Langevin model where the friction coefficient randomly switches between low-friction (liquid-like) and high-friction (glassy-like) states. The dynamics are governed by the ratio between the friction switching time $τ$ and the intrinsic velocity relaxation time $τ_0$. For fast switching ($τ/τ_0 \lesssim 1$) the motion is homogeneous and Brownian, whereas for slow switching ($τ/τ_0 \gg 1$) the particle exhibits intermittent dynamics and an enhanced diffusion coefficient. Analysis of the single-particle overlap function $Q(t)$ and the dynamic susceptibility $χ_4(t)$ reveals decoupling of the diffusion coefficient from the average friction upon cooling, which coincides with increasing temporal dynamic heterogeneity. This minimal model provides a transparent framework for understanding single-particle transport in media with fluctuating local mobility, including supercooled liquids and phase-separated soft materials.

### Chemical potential of magnon polarons

Using a rotationally invariant formulation of spin-lattice coupling, we derive a rigorous definition of the chemical potential for magnon-polaron quasiparticles in collinear ferromagnets (FMs) and antiferromagnets (AFMs), valid when magnetoelastic scattering equilibrates magnons and acoustic phonons on timescales much shorter than those associated with quasiparticle-nonconserving relaxation processes. While our microscopic framework applies to generic magnon-phonon interactions, here we focus on high-symmetry crystals where the two transverse acoustic modes form a degenerate doublet. This doublet can combine into circularly polarized phonons, making the chiral selectivity of the coupling manifest: the FM magnon mode hybridizes only with the co-rotating phonon, whereas in collinear AFMs each magnon branch of opposite handedness couples to the phonon of the same chirality. We show that, in both FM and AFM systems, the nonequilibrium magnon-polaron gas is governed by a single chemical potential conjugate to the conserved axial angular momentum. In FMs, the two hybrid branches in the co-rotating sector share this chemical potential, weighted by their magnonic fractions; in AFMs, the four magnon-polaron branches split into two chiral sectors that carry opposite angular momenta and couple with opposite sign to the same chemical potential. Building on this microscopic thermodynamic framework, we formulate a Boltzmann transport theory for magnon-polarons and derive compact expressions for angular-momentum and heat currents that interpolate continuously to the decoupled regime and reproduce the phenomenological magnon-polaron transport framework underlying previous spin Seebeck analyses.

### High-Precision Simulations of the Parity Conserving Directed Percolation Universality Class in 1+1 Dimensions

Next to the directed percolation (DP) universality class, parity conserving directed percolation (pcDP; also called parity
  conserving branching annihilating random walks, pcBARW) is the second-most important model with an absorbing state
  transition. Its distinction from ordinary DP is that particle number is conserved modulo 2, which means in 1 dimension of
  space that there are two degenerate vacuum (absorbing) states. Particles can be interpreted as domain walls between
  them, and there are two distinct sectors in systems with a finite initial number of particles: Realizations with even and
  odd particle numbers show different scaling behaviors. An intriguing feature of pcDP it is that some of its critical
  exponents seem to be very simple rational numbers. The most prominent is the one describing the average number of
  particles (or active sites) in the even sector, which is asymptotically constant. In contrast, the dynamical critical
  exponent (which is the same in both sectors) seems not close to any simple rational. Finally, the order parameter exponent
  (which is also the same in both sectors) is, according to the most precise previous simulations, $β= 1.020(5)$,
  and thus very close but not really compatible with a simple rational. We present high statistics simulations which
  clarifies this situation, and which indicate several other intriguing properties of pcPD clusters. In particular, we find
  $β= 1.000$ with the error in the next digit.

As a class of electron-rich materials, electrides demonstrate promising applications in many fields. However, the required high pressure restricts the practical applications to some extent. This study reveals that the unique feature of electride, i.e., the localization of interstitial electrons, can be greatly enhanced and tuned by self-defective doping, applying tensile/compressive stress, or shear stress. Moreover, the requirement of orbital orthogonality between the valence and core electron wave functions, as well as the Pauli exclusion principle, should be the driven force for the electron interstitial localization; and the exertion of external pressure modifies the available space to accommodate the electronic wave functions, thus enhances the interstitial localization. These discoveries lay down the ground for searching for promising electrides that are practicable at ambient conditions.

- **TL;DR**: 首次在动态旋转金刚石压砧中研究Fe-Mn合金的剧烈塑性变形和BCC-HCP相变，发现塑性应变导致独特的相变动力学，挑战了传统认知。

The first experiments in dynamic rotational diamond anvil cell (dRDAC) on severe plastic deformation (SPD) and BCC&lt;-&gt;HCP phase transformation (PT) at pressure up to 27.6 GPa, rotation rates up to 1,500 RPM, and strain rates up to 2,094 /s are performed considering Fe-%7Mn alloy as an example. The BCC-HCP PT initiates at 11.4 GPa under hydrostatic loading while it is 3.2 GPa under plastic compression. Strong effect of plastic straining leads to unique kinetics with simultaneous direct and reverse PTs, not studied for any material. For quasi-static loading, parameters in the kinetics for the strain-induced direct-reverse PTs and stationary volume fraction versus pressure are found. During torsion with 1,000 and 1,500 RPM, volume fraction of the HCP phase does not change. After torsion stops, it increases by 30% within a few minutes after 1,000 RPM and HCP phase disappears after 1,500 RPM. These findings contradict general wisdom that strain-induced PTs occur only during straining, time is not a governing parameter, and kinetics is determined by plastic strain instead of time. Thus, nuclei of the HCP phase are generated during straining at high strain rate, but growth/disappearance occur under stresses at much longer time scales. Consequently, a new theory of combined strain- and stress-induced PTs is required. The following important rule is revealed: crystallite size of 30 nm, microstrain ~0.004, and dislocation density ~1.1 x $10^{15}$/$m^2$ in the HCP phase are steady during static compression and dynamic torsion, during and after the PT and after torsion. These parameters are independent of pressure, plastic strain tensor, its path, strain rates, and volume fraction of the HCP phase. Obtained results open fundamental research on combined strain- and stress-induced PTs and microstructure evolution under dynamic SPD and high pressure.

Vanadium dioxide (VO$_2$) exhibits hysteresis in resistance while undergoing a thermally driven insulator-metal transition (IMT). Understanding the nonequilibrium effects in resistance is of great interest, as VO$_2$ is a strong candidate for brain-inspired computing, which is more energy efficient for AI tasks compared to traditional computing. Accurate models of the connection between microscopic and macroscopic transport properties and microscopic imaging of VO$_2$ will allow us to better utilize VO$_2$ in future applications. However, predictions of macroscopic resistance of VO$_2$ that quantitatively match observations using spatially resolved data have not yet been achieved. Here, we demonstrate an accurate prediction of the macroscopic resistance of VO$_2$ throughout the entire temperature range of interest, by developing a multiscale resistor network model incorporating the assumption of fractal sub-pixel structure of the optical data, where the configuration of insulating and metallic domains within each pixel are drawn from the random field Ising model near criticality. This strongly indicates that the observed fractal, power law structure of metallic and insulating domains extends down to much smaller length scales than the current record for experimental resolution of this system, and that the two-dimensional random field Ising model near criticality is a suitable model for describing the metal and insulator patches of VO$_2$ down to scales that approach the unit cell.

- **TL;DR**: 在铁基超导体中，狄拉克锥特征从反铁磁正交相持续到向列相，表明向列相中存在与反铁磁正交相同周期的反铁序，支持轨道有序作为向列性的微观起源。

The microscopic origin of the nematicity, namely, four-fold rotational symmetry breaking in iron-based superconductors has been controversial since its discovery. In particular, its relationship with the stripe-type spin-density-wave order and the orthorhombic lattice distortion in the antiferromagnetic orthorhombic (AFO) phase, which exists at temperatures below the electronic nematic phase, has been highly debated. Here, we report on the temperature evolution of angle-resolved photoemission spectra of the parent compound BaFe2As2, ranging from the AFO to nematic to paramagnetic phases. The Dirac cone feature, which is formed in the AFO phase, is found to persist in the nematic phase, suggesting that an antiferroic order of the same periodicity as the AFO phase persists in the nematic phase. Considering the relatively shallow d_xy orbital in BaFe2As2, we propose that an antiferro-orbital order involving the d_xy and other orbitals takes place in the nematic phase.

- **TL;DR**: 在二维材料量子点器件中，通过集成SrTiO3变容二极管实现阻抗匹配，解决了高阻值器件射频反射测量难题，为高速量子比特读出奠定基础。

Two-dimensional (2D) materials are attractive platforms for realizing high-performance quantum bits (qubits). However, radio-frequency (RF) charge detection, which is a key technique for qubits readout, remains challenging in such systems. We demonstrate RF reflectometry with impedance matching for high-resistance quantum dot devices based on bilayer graphene and molybdenum disulfide. By integrating a tunable strontium titanate (SrTiO3) varactor into a resonant circuit, we achieve nearly perfect impedance matching, enabling sensitive charge detection. The demodulated RF signal clearly shows Coulomb oscillations, and the SrTiO3 varactor exhibits robustness against both magnetic fields and voltage noise on the varactor. Our results establish SrTiO3 varactors as effective tunable matching components for RF reflectometry in high-resistance 2D material quantum devices, providing a foundation for high-speed qubits readout.

We show that thermodynamics can be formulated naturally from the intrinsic geometry of phase space alone-without postulating an ensemble, which instead emerges from the geometric structure itself. Within this formulation, phase transitions are encoded in the geometry of constant-energy manifold: entropy and its derivatives follow from a deterministic equation whose source is built from curvature invariants. As energy increases, geometric transformations in energy-manifold structure drive thermodynamic responses and characterize criticality. We validate this framework through explicit analysis of paradigmatic systems-the 1D XY mean-field model and 2D $φ^4$ theory-showing that geometric transformations in energy-manifold structure characterize criticality quantitatively. The framework applies universally to long-range interacting systems and in ensemble-inequivalence regimes.

Vanadium oxide thin films exhibit temperature-driven electronic transitions desirable for sensing and microelectronic applications, yet their performance is often limited by thermal hysteresis. This study demonstrates that electronic stability is governed not simply by roughness or crystallinity but by a unique combination of surface morphological complexity and thermal hysteresis, revealed across films deposited with varying working pressure using Direct Current/Radio Frequency magnetron sputtering. Specifically, the film grown at 15 mTorr shows a distinct convergence of highest morphological vertical complexity and lowest thermal hysteresis, exhibiting nearly reversible transport with activation energies ranging from 0.26 to 0.28 eV and negative temperature coefficients of resistance between -0.0337 and -0.035 K-1. While conventional roughness metrics and mono-fractal parameters do not capture this behavior, multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis uncovers a pronounced peak in multifractality strength, which correlates inversely with thermal hysteresis. This highlights multifractality strength as a predictive descriptor of electronic stability, identifying a multiscale structural signature that enhances stress accommodation during thermal cycling. These results define an optimal deposition window and provide a morphology-guided pathway for developing thermally robust mixed-phase vanadium oxide films.

The metallic kagome compound Sc$_3$Mn$_3$Al$_7$Si$_5$ has attracted attention as a candidate platform where geometric frustration and itinerant electrons may cooperate to stabilize a quantum-disordered magnetic ground state. Here, we combine bulk thermodynamic probes, low-noise FIB-device transport, and comprehensive $^{55}$Mn Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) measurements to elucidate the low-temperature spin dynamics of this system. The bulk data reveal strongly reduced magnetic entropy, a negative magnetoresistance arising from spin scattering, and field-dependent transport indicates the spin fluctuations, while showing no signatures of long-range magnetic order. NMR provides a direct local view of the correlated Mn moments: the nuclear spin-spin relaxation $T_2$ exhibits a pronounced low-temperature enhancement driven by an indirect internuclear coupling through electronic spin fluctuations, whose temperature and distance dependence point to partially gapped low-energy spin excitations. The spin-lattice relaxation rate $T_1^{-1}$ displays a Hebel-Slichter-like coherence peak near \SI{10}{K}, coincident with the resistivity crossover and a subtle heat-capacity anomaly, indicating the formation of short-range spin-singlet correlations. Together, our results demonstrate that Sc$_3$Mn$_3$Al$_7$Si$_5$ hosts an unconventional correlated state dominated by frustrated, gapped spin dynamics, placing it among the rare metallic kagome systems proximate to a quantum spin liquid.

Nonreciprocal dissipationless transport has long been sought for applications in superconducting technologies. Recently, it has been implemented by the so called superconducting diode effect. Such effect arises from an imbalance in critical supercurrents flowing in opposite directions. In this work, we theoretically demonstrate how the superconducting diode effect emerges in the quantum spin Hall phase when brought into full proximity with a superconductor. We explore two regimes: large and narrow quantum wells. In the former geometry, we show that the superconducting diode effect can be externally controlled using both magnetic and electric fields, achieving unit efficiency. In the latter regime, where tunneling between opposite edges may occur, we propose a mechanism for an intrinsic superconducting diode effect driven by edge reconstruction, which does not require external magnetic fields.

- **TL;DR**: β相锌酞菁单晶在80K以下出现从宽泛非偏振Frenkel激子发光到窄带高度偏振超辐射荧光的突然转变，但无结构相变证据，表明激子耦合变化和热分布可模拟结构相变特征。

The optical properties of molecular crystals are largely determined by the excitonic coupling of neighboring molecules. This coupling is extremely sensitive to the arrangement of adjacent molecular units, as their electronic interaction is defined by the relative orientation of the individual transition dipole moments and their wave function overlap. Hence, the optical properties, such as fluorescence, are usually highly anisotropic and good indicators of structural changes during the variation of intensive thermodynamic parameters like temperature or pressure. Here, we discuss the peculiar though archetypical case of $β$-phase zinc-phthalocyanine: In single crystals, we report a sudden change of spectral emission with temperature from a broad, unpolarized Frenkel-exciton type luminescence to a narrow, highly polarized superradiance-like fluorescence below 80 K. Surprisingly, we find that there is no sign of a discrete structural phase transition in this temperature regime. To understand this apparent contradiction, we perform polarization-, temperature- and time-dependent photoluminescence measurements along different crystallographic directions to fully map the emission characteristics of the crystal-exciton. By means of ab-initio calculations on a density functional theory level we conclude that our observations are consistent with a dimer exciton model when considering thermalized electronic states. As such, our study presents a representative case study on a well-established molecular material class demonstrating that caution is advised when attributing discrete changes in electronic observables to a structural phase transition. As we show for zinc-phthalocyanine in its $β$-phase modification, slowly varying excitonic couplings and thermal redistribution of excitations can mimic the same signatures attributed to a structural phase transition.

### Anharmonic interaction as random field for thermal transport in FPU-$β$ lattice

- **TL;DR**: 该论文提出了FPU-β晶格热输运的开放量子理论，引入局域玻色子作为输运载体，通过随机微分方程研究非谐相互作用对热传导的影响。

We present an open quantum theory for the thermal transport in the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-$β$(FPU-$β$) lattice. In the theory, local bosons(LBs) are introduced as carriers for the transport. The LBs are stimulated by individual atoms in the lattice, which are different from the phonons that are collective motions of the atoms. The LBs move in the FPU chain and are governed by a set of stochastic differential equations(SDEs). The anharmonic interaction between the atoms in the lattice is transformed to a random field by the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation, and has been implemented in the set of SDEs. By solving the set of SDEs at the steady state, we study the influence of the anharmonic interaction on the thermal transport. Results show that the anharmonic interaction decreases the thermal current by trapping the LBs on the lattice sites, as well as increase the thermal current by enhancing the amount of the LBs for the transport. The competition between these two mechanisms makes the thermal conductivity of the lattice dependent on the anharmonic interaction non-monotonically. The finite size effect of the thermal conductivity has also been captured by the theory.

Models of imitation and herding behavior often underestimate the role of individualistic actions and assume symmetric boundary conditions. However, real-world systems (e.g., electoral processes) frequently involve asymmetric boundaries. In this study, we explore how arbitrarily placed boundary conditions influence the mean first passage time in the symmetric noisy voter model, and how individualistic behavior amplifies this asymmetry. We derive exact analytical expressions for mean first passage time that accommodate any initial condition and two types of boundary configurations: (i) both boundaries absorbing, and (ii) one absorbing and one reflective. In both scenarios, mean first passage time exhibits a clear asymmetry with respect to the initial condition, shaped by the boundary placement and the rate of independent transitions. Symmetry in mean first passage time emerges only when absorbing boundaries are equidistant from the midpoint. Additionally, we show that Kramers' law holds in both configurations when the rate of independent transitions is large. Our analytical results are in excellent agreement with numerical simulations, reinforcing the robustness of our findings.

We present thermal conductivity data on single crystals of YAlO3 and YbAlO3 for temperatures between 2 K and 300 K and the heat current along b and c. Both materials are very good thermal conductors in the investigated temperature range. The thermal conductivity in these electrical insulators is due to phonons. The effect of Y-Yb exchange is found to be rather small despite the considerable difference in density and average atomic mass. For YAlO3 we find a moderate thermal conductivity anisotropy with weak temperature dependence and a ratio of c to b direction between at most 1 and 2.2. It is discussed with regard to the velocities of sound and relevant scattering processes. For YbAlO3 the small crystal size limits the precision of absolute thermal conductivity values and does not allow drawing conclusions on the anisotropy. Our results on YAlO3 confirm that the material is suitable for applications requiring a good thermal conductivity at temperatures down to liquid helium, such as lasers, substrates, and detectors.

The fuzzy-sphere regularization is an emerging numerical and theoretical technique for studying conformal field theories (CFTs). In this paper, we apply it to the $O(N)$ vector model, one of the most prominent theories for critical behavior in three space-time dimensions.

For $N=2,3,4$, we present numerical evidence including the operator spectra and correlation functions in agreement with conformal symmetry and conformal bootstrap results.

As pointed out by Nambu-Goldstone, continuous symmetry breaking gives rise to gapless bosonic excitation. In superconductors, continuous local U(1) gauge symmetry is broken. The gapless excitation thus created is the collective phase mode of a superconductor. In 1962, Anderson pointed out that Coulomb interaction lifts this gapless mode to the superconducting plasma frequency. Therefore, in a superconducting fluid there are no bosonic excitations below the Cooper pair binding energy. Anderson mechanism also implies that the massless photon becomes massive in a superconductor. It provides a microscopic theory for dissipationless charge transport (with Landau criterion for superfluidity) and the Meissner effect in a superconductor. Jumping to particle physics, to explain why the gauge bosons for electroweak interaction are massive, Higgs, Englert, Kibble et al. proposed the existence of the Higgs field. This matter field couples to the massless W, Z bosons and generates mass via the Higgs mechanism. Due to their conceptual similarities, these two mechanisms are referred to as the Anderson-Higgs mechanism. In 2013, the detection of the Higgs boson provided the final proof for the Higgs hypothesis decades after its conception. The amplitude mode of a superconductor, which corresponds to the Higgs boson in the above analogy, is referred to as the Higgs mode. Its spectroscopic detection has also remained elusive for decades. In recent years, the development of ultrafast techniques enabled an effective approach for studying the mode. Here, we introduce the Higgs mode from a perspective of why superconductors superconduct and review the recent development in Higgs spectroscopy, particularly in the field of nonlinear terahertz spectroscopy. We discuss the novel insights that may be learnt from these studies for future high-Tc superconductivity and correlated materials research in general.

Majorana bound states (MBSs), with their non-Abelian statistics and topological protection, are key candidates for fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, their unambiguous identification in solid-state systems remains a fundamental challenge. Here, we present a theoretical study demonstrating that drag transport in a capacitively coupled double quantum dot system offers a robust and nonlocal probe of weakly coupled MBSs. Using the master equation approach, we investigate both steady-state and transient dynamics and uncover a distinctive signature of MBSs, i.e., the emergence of pronounced split peaks in the drag transconductance, directly linked to inter-MBS coupling. We further show that the dynamics of quantum coherence exhibit an inverse correlation with the emergence and enhancement of MBS-induced split peaks in the drag transconductance as the inter-MBS coupling increases. A comparative analysis with Andreev bound states (ABSs) reveals key differences, that is, MBS-induced transconductance peaks are symmetric and robust, while ABS features are asymmetric and sensitive to perturbations. These findings establish clear experimental criteria for distinguishing MBSs and provide a practical framework for probing Majorana physics through nonlocal transport.

We show that the Heider model with an external field is equivalent, in the limit of structural balance, to the Ising model with nearest-neighbor interactions without an external field. More precisely, we claim that the signs of the Heider relations that maintain structural equilibrium in the system can be represented as nearest neighbor Ising spin products. We demonstrate this explicitly for a complete graph and provide a general argument for an arbitrary graph. A consequence of the equivalence is that the system of balanced Heider states undergoes a phase transition, inherited from the Ising model, at a critical value of the social field at which the fluctuations of edge magnetization are maximal.

Several electrochemical and electrical energy storage devices are reported every day, with the claim of outperforming the established ones. The use of newer materials and recent advanced techniques to synthesize and/or assemble them into a device leads to improved performance. Cyclic stability of a device is the most effective way of assessing the performance of the device. A wide variety of parameters can influence the cyclic stability of a cell, and there is no single fundamental parameter that reliably captures or assesses its overall performance. Therefore, we developed a multi-dimensional assessment framework that could account for various parameters like various types of materials used, selected fabrication techniques, current density, operating voltage window, temperature, environment, and other conditions, and can effectively rank cell performance based on essential assessment metrics like specific capacity and energy density that are substantial for a well-founded comparison.
  The framework is designed with 45+ fields that capture various details related to i) materials used to fabricate cells, ii) processing techniques associated with electrode preparation and cell assembly, iii) cell information like weights and volumes, iv) electrochemical testing parameters, and v) cyclic charge-discharge performance details of a cell. The framework also accommodates charge-discharge gravimetric specific capacity, which is believed to be a key asset in accurately extracting lots of useful information, such as specific capacity, energy density, quantum efficiency, and other efficiencies. A distinctive feature of the framework is its ability to store data from both experimental and theoretical/computational sources (such as DFT and ML predictions) and facilitate effective comparison between them.

We present a novel pairing mechanism for superconductivity in strongly correlated electron systems, which often have both localised and itinerant charge carriers. An effective anisotropic interaction between the itinerant particles originates from the fluctuations in the crystal field associated with virtual hopping of the localised particles, a process that is also responsible for the Kondo exchange. Interestingly, this interaction is \emph{attractive} for charge transfer insulators such as cuprates. Considering a simple toy model for cuprates, without the antiferromagnetic exchange, this interaction leads to the correct d-wave superconducting gap, thus demonstrating its relevance.

Asymmetric interface coupling breaks inversion symmetry and induces a spontaneous Pi/2 phase difference, thereby breaking time-reversal symmetry without a magnetic field. In this TRS-broken state, the SDE emerges when single-Cooper-pair tunneling is enabled at the s-d interfaces, with its polarity and efficiency controllable by rotating the d-wave crystallographic orientation or perturbing its intrinsic C4 symmetry. Our results reveal a robust link between nonreciprocal Josephson transport and pairing symmetry, establishing the SDE as a powerful diagnostic tool for high-Tc superconductors and a tunable element for superconducting electronics.

- **TL;DR**: 研究纯镍中氢致晶间开裂的晶界敏感性随Σ值（CSL值）和氢浓度（4-14 wppm）的变化规律，发现Σ-3晶界在所有氢浓度下最具抗裂性，与镍合金文献结果相反。

We characterize the grain boundary (GB) susceptibility to hydrogen-assisted intergranular cracking in pure nickel as a function of coincident site lattice value ($Σ$-n), over a wide range of hydrogen concentrations (4 to 14 wppm). Cracks on the surface and within the bulk material were identified across the entire gauge region of the specimens. The susceptibility of GBs to crack initiation and propagation was evaluated by separating cracks containing single GB or multiple GBs. A larger loss in fracture strain, a smaller reduction in area, and an increase in the percentage of intergranular fracture indicated a higher degree of embrittlement at elevated hydrogen concentrations. The number of cracks was significantly higher on the surface than in the bulk for the most severe hydrogen charging conditions ($\geq$ 8 wppm), while a similar number was observed for lower concentrations. The propensity for hydrogen-assisted intergranular cracking at different types of GBs on the surface and in the bulk material was consistent, indicating that while cathodic charging can promote surface cracks, it does not significantly impact the GBs relative susceptibility. The $Σ$-3 boundaries were the most resistant to cracking, as evidenced by the considerably lower fraction of these GBs exhibiting intergranular cracking at all hydrogen concentrations considered. This contrasts literature findings for Ni alloys and can be explained by the segregation energies and reductions in the cohesive strength with hydrogen, with less favorable trapping at the $Σ$-3 boundaries. No evidence of plasticity-mediated cracking initiation was observed.

- **TL;DR**: 研究了SSH模型在不同驱动协议（周期、准周期、随机）下的动力学行为，重点关注Loschmidt回波的振荡和衰减特性，以及拓扑边界模与绕数不匹配的现象。

We study the effect of driving the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model using two unitary operators $U_1$ and $U_2$ in different combinations; the unitaries differ in the values of the inter-cell hopping amplitudes. Specifically, we study the cases where the unitaries are applied periodically, quasiperiodically and randomly. For a periodic protocol, when $U_1$ and $U_2$ are applied alternately, we find that end modes may appear, but the number of end modes does not always agree with the winding number which is a $Z$-valued topological invariant. We then study the Loschmidt echo ($LE$) starting with a random initial state. We find that the $LE$ exhibits pronounced oscillations whose Fourier transform has peaks at frequencies which agree with the most prominent gaps between pairs of quasienergies. Next, when $U_1$ and $U_2$ are applied in a quasiperiodic way (we consider Fibonacci and Thue-Morse protocols), we study the $LE$ starting with an initial state which is an end mode of one of the unitaries. When the inter-cell hoppings differ by a small amount denoted by $ε$, and the time period $T$ of each unitary is also small, the distance between the unitaries is found to be proportional to $εT$. We then find that the $LE$ oscillates around a particular value for a very long time before decaying to zero. The deviation of the value of the $LE$ from 1 scales as $ε^2$ for a fixed value of $T$, while the time after which the $LE$ starts decaying to zero has an interesting dependence on $ε$ and $T$. Finally, when $U_1$ and $U_2$ are applied in a random order, the $LE$ rapidly decays to zero with increasing time. We have presented a qualitative understanding of the above results.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文提出了一个增强版热力学不确定性关系，通过结合正向和反向跳跃的循环时间统计，为稳态熵产生率提供了更紧的下界。

For continuous-time Markov jump processes on irreducible networks and time-independent rate constants, we employ a transition-based formalism to express the long-time precision of a single integrated current over an observable channel in terms of precisions of the recurrence times of the forward and backward jumps, and of an effective affinity that captures the thermodynamic driving on that channel. This leads to a general lower bound for the stationary entropy production rate that extends the well-known Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relation (TUR). Such an augmented TUR, which incorporates the statistics of the recurrences, proves to be tighter than the standard one far from equilibrium, and potentially offers new opportunities for the optimization and design of biological and chemical out-of-equilibrium systems at the nanoscale.

- **TL;DR**: 开发了一个结合应变梯度晶体塑性和相场损伤模型的耦合框架，用于分析异质结构层压材料的力学行为，能够准确预测其强度-延展性协同效应和损伤演化。

Heterostructured (HS) materials exhibit excellent mechanical properties, combining high strength and significant ductility. Hetero-deformation-induced (HDI) hardening and strain de-localization are key to their strength-ductility synergy. However, existing models often fall short in addressing these aspects. In this work, a coupled framework integrating strain gradient crystal plasticity and phase field damage models is developed. The interface dominated HDI hardening in HS laminates is handled by introducing a heterogeneity coefficient into the back stress. The phase field model accounts for defect energy-driven damage and accurately represents the materials ductile damage behavior by accounting for effects of microstructure on crack initiation and propagation. Simulation results on HS laminates align well with experimental results and reflect the distribution of geometrically necessary dislocations and back stresses at interfaces between regions with dissimilar microstructure. Crack initiation and propagation are accurately described, providing valuable insights into fracture behavior. The model can predict how strength and ductility change upon variations of the HS laminate microstructure, thus providing an essential tool for microstructure optimization. This work enhances the understanding of deformation mechanisms in HS laminates and provides valuable insights for design and optimization of this class of materials.

- **TL;DR**: 从投影截断近似推导出自洽随机相位近似，应用于任意温度，在无序基态参数下计算一维无自旋费米子模型，结果与现有研究吻合良好。

We derive the self-consistent random phase approximations (sc-RPA) from the projective truncation approximation (PTA) for the equation of motion of two-time Green's function. The obtained sc-RPA applies to arbitrary temperature and recovers the Rowe's formalism at zero temperature. The PTA formalism not only rationalize Rowe's formula, but also provides a general framework to extend sc-RPA. We implement the sc-RPA calculation for the one-dimensional spinless fermion model in the parameter regime of disordered ground state, with the N-representability constraints enforced. The obtained ground state energy, correlation function, and density spectral function agree well with existing results. The features of the Luttinger liquid ground state and the continuum/bound state in the spectral function are well captured. We discuss several issues concerning the approximations made in RPAs, difficulties of RPA for symmetric state, and the static component problem of PTA.

- **TL;DR**: 在二维非对称狄拉克半金属中，通过平均场理论发现d_{x²-y²}波配对会产生二阶拓扑超导态，其边界会出现可控的马约拉纳零模。

Dirac semimetals, with their protected Dirac points, present an ideal platform for realizing intrinsic topological superconductivity. In this work, we investigate superconductivity in a two-dimensional, square-lattice nonsymmorphic Dirac semimetal. In the normal state near half-filling, the Fermi surface consists of two distinct pockets, each enclosing a Dirac point at a time-reversal invariant momentum ($\textbf{X}=(π,0)$ and $\textbf{Y}=(0,π)$). Considering an on-site repulsive and nearest-neighbor attractive interaction, we use self-consistent mean-field theory to determine the ground-state pairing symmetry. We find that an even-parity, spin-singlet $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave pairing is favored as it gives rise to a fully gapped superconducting state. Since the pairing amplitude has opposite signs on the two Dirac Fermi pockets, the superconducting state is identified as a second-order topological superconductor. The hallmark of this topological phase is the emergence of Majorana zero modes at the system's boundaries. Notably, the positions of these Majorana modes are highly controllable and can be manipulated simply by tailoring the boundary sublattice terminations. Our results highlight the promise of nonsymmorphic Dirac semimetals for realizing and manipulating Majorana modes.

- **TL;DR**: 实验证实了石墨烯/WSe₂异质结中邻近诱导的自旋轨道耦合（SOC）对扭转角有强烈依赖性，并通过机械压力实现可调谐性。

Recently, proximity-induced spin-orbit coupling (SOC) has been observed in heterostructures consisting of monolayer graphene (ML-G) and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) such as WSe$_{2}$. Successful tuning of SOC in graphene/WSe$_{2}$ heterostructures by applying mechanical pressure and electric fields was also demonstrated in previous studies. In addition, theoretical calculations predicted a strong dependence of the proximity-induced SOC on the twist angle between graphene and TMDC. Here, we put these predictions to experimental test in ML-G/ML-WSe$_{2}$/hBN-heterostructures, where the twist angle is determined by aligning fractured edges, and by crystallographic etching of graphene. By performing weak anti-localization measurements, we determine the strength of the Rasbha-type SOC ($λ_\mathrm{R}$) and the valley-Zeeman-type SOC ($λ_\mathrm{VZ}$). Our experiments confirm a strong twist angle dependence of the proximity-induced SOC in agreement with theoretical predictions. Finally, we demonstrate the tunability of the SOC strength via mechanical pressure, which is in agreement with earlier findings.

- **TL;DR**: 提出一种无需量子态层析即可检测量子Mpemba效应的新方法，通过测量特定可观测量来显著降低实验复杂度

The Mpemba effect refers to the anomalous relaxation of a quantum state that, despite being initially farther from equilibrium, relaxes faster than a closer counterpart. Detecting such a quantum Mpemba effect typically requires full knowledge of the quantum state during its time evolution, which is an experimentally challenging task since state tomography becomes exponentially difficult as system size increases. This poses a significant obstacle in studying Mpemba effect in complex many-body systems. In this work, we demonstrate that this limitation can be overcome by identifying suitable observables that signal rapid relaxation. Moreover, as long as the system equilibrates to a known unique steady-state, it is possible to fully detect the occurrence of quantum Mpemba effect just by measuring the observable for known state preparations. Our approach thus significantly reduces experimental complexity and offers a practical route for observing the quantum Mpemba effect in complex and extended multi-qubit setups.

- **TL;DR**: 开发了一个自洽的物理模拟框架，用于分析SiC MOSFET中的栅极漏电流机制，揭示了氧化物中的碰撞电离和空穴俘获对漏电流的增强作用。

Silicon carbide (SiC) metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect-transistors (MOSFETs) enable high-voltage and high-temperature power conversion. Compared to Si devices, they suffer from pronounced gate leakage due to the reduced electron tunneling barrier at the interface between SiC and amorphous silicon dioxide (a-SiO$_2$). We develop a self-consistent, physics-based simulation framework that couples electrostatics, quantum tunneling, carrier transport, impact ionization, and charge trapping for both electrons and holes. The model quantitatively reproduces measured gate-current-voltage characteristics of SiC MOS capacitors over a wide temperature (80-573 K) range and a wide bias range without empirical fitting. Simulations reveal that conduction electrons in a-SiO$_2$ can trigger impact ionization, which generates electron-hole pairs, and leads to capture of holes in the oxide bulk, thereby enhancing gate leakage current. The framework captures these coupled processes across multiple orders of magnitude in time and field, providing predictive capability for oxide reliability. Although demonstrated for SiC devices, the methodology also applies to Si technologies that uses the same gate dielectric.

Excitons and their complexes govern optical-related behaviors in semiconductors. Here, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we have elucidated the light-matter interaction mediated by quasi-steady excitonic complexes within a monolayer of the prototypical two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor WSe2. Under continuous incident light, we have observed the generation of quasi-steady excitons and their complexes, encompassing ground and excited state excitons, trions, as well as their intricate interplay. We further show spectral evidence of electronic excitation states within the background of quasi-steady excitonic complexes, characterized by valence band (VB) effective mass renormalization, the enhanced spin-orbit coupling (SOC), the formation of an excitonic gap near the Fermi level (EF ) of the conduction band (CB), and intervalley excitonic band folding. Our findings not only unveil a quasi-steady excitonic complex background for the creation of diverse electronic excitations in 2D semiconductors but also offer new insights into the role of excitons in the charge density wave (CDW) formation mechanism and facilitate the advancement of correlated electronic state engineering based on the coupling between electrons and excitonic complexes in a quasi-equilibrium state.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究发现金属接触通过逆邻近效应在超导体中产生弱点，导致临界电流大幅下降并产生异常金属相，这一现象源于接触诱导的超导性减弱和焦耳加热，而非材料本征特性。

Superconductor-to-metal transitions (SMTs) are key probes of mesoscopic superconductivity, but their interpretation can be complicated by device geometry and measurement conditions. Here, we study epitaxial InAs-Al nanowires and show that metallic contacts induce an inverse proximity effect (IPE), creating weak spots in the superconductor that strongly suppress the critical current and give rise to an anomalous metallic phase. Using transport measurements supported by Usadel theory, we demonstrate that this phase originates from the contact-induced weakening of superconductivity together with Joule heating, rather than intrinsic material properties. Our findings reveal an overlooked observer effect in mesoscopic superconductors and provide essential guidance for interpreting SMTs and for designing devices based on these systems.

Nonequilibrium self-assembly is the root of all emergent complexity, including life. In quantum materials emergent metastable states have become a very fashionable topic of research, but the study of resulting mesoscopic state dynamics is hindered by the absence of appropriate methods. Here we pioneer the use of fast-scanning tunnelling microscope (FSTM) techniques to investigate the internal dynamics of mesoscopic metastable topologically non-trivial defects in an electronic Wigner crystal superlattice created by a local electromagnetic perturbation. This allows us to record unprecedented individual electron motion trajectories in real-time on the millisecond timescale. Such dynamics is understood to arise from coupling of hybridised Goldstone-Higgs bound states localised at the Y junction with microscopic electronic degrees of freedom that lead to the formation of localised quasiparticles with slow internal dynamics. Their unprecedented robustness against external perturbations comes from non-local constraints and non-trivial broken symmetries. Two-level system telegraph noise maps at the junction show phase and amplitude that is correlated with the observed electron motion trajectories. Such observation of single-particle dynamics in real time fundamentally transforms our understanding of metastable quantum states in electronic crystals and paves the way for technological advancements that make use of engineered topologically non-trivial defects.

- **TL;DR**: 一维三态Potts模型加入平均场相互作用，在正则系综下得到相图，包含一级相变线、两个三相点和临界点，无二级相变线。

We derive the phase diagram of the one-dimensional three-state Potts model with an additional mean-field interaction in the canonical ensemble. The free energy is obtained by mapping the model onto the spin-$1$ Blume-Emery-Griffiths model and solving it by using an Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation combined with the transfer matrix method. A complex structure with lines of first-order transitions, two triple points and a critical point appears at finite temperature. The phase diagram is two-dimensional, since there are two adjustable parameters, the nearest-neighbour coupling $K$ and the temperature $T$. We show that the phase diagram does not present second-order phase transition lines, due to the fact that the order parameter is not a symmetry-breaking one. Quite remarkably, we are able to determine analytically one of the first-order phase-transition lines. We also prove that, when the nearest-neighbour coupling $K$ is large and negative, the first-order transition temperature becomes asymptotically independent of $K$.

Twisted bilayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC) form moiré superlattices resulting in moiré minibands in momentum space and hosting localized excitons in real space. While moiré superlattices provide access to Mott-Hubbard physics, their energy potential landscape and electronic correlations are highly sensitive to fluctuations of the twist angle, disorder and lattice reconstructions. However, fast and non-invasive experimental access to local twist angle and its spatial variations is challenging. Here, we systematically correlate twist angle variations of twisted WSe2 bilayers across micrometer length scales using a combined lateral force microscopy (LFM) and a micro- Raman spectroscopy approach. These measurements uncover lateral variations in the twist angle by more than 1° across length scales relevant to optical and transport measurements. We demonstrate that twist angles in the range of 3° &lt; $α$ &lt; 12° show distinct Raman response from scattering on optical moiré phonons allowing twist angle determination with high precision and sub-micrometer spatial resolution under ambient conditions. These modes are particularly sensitive in the low-angle twist regime, predicted to host emergent quantum phases. Our results establish micro-Raman spectroscopy of optical moiré phonons as a rapid, non-invasive probe to determine twist angle and to screen local twist angle variations with a precision better than $\pm$ 0.3° and a lateral resolution below one micrometer. This methodology is also applicable to fully hBN-encapsulated heterostructures.

Perovskite ruthenates are fascinating playgrounds for exploring topological spin textures, but generally rely on extrinsic mechanisms to trigger the noncoplanar states. Here we report the discovery of an emergent chiral spin crystal phase in (111) SrRuO3 epitaxial films, characterized by a significant topological Hall effect and noncoplanar spin arrangements with different propagation vectors along two orthogonal directions. Instead of driven by the enhanced Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction due to broken inversion symmetry at heterointerfaces, this emergent state arises intrinsically from the interplay of dipolar interactions and magnetic frustration, leading to the stabilization of topological phases in much thicker films. These findings open a new pathway for creating and controlling the topological spin states in perovskites, with broad implications for spintronic device design.

This review discusses the multifaceted electronic properties of spinel oxides with a particular focus on Lithium Vanadate (LiV2O4), Lithium Titanate (LiTi2O4), and Magnesium Titanate (MgTi2O4). We selected LiTi2O4, LiV2O4, and MgTi2O4 because they serve as quintessential examples of spinel oxides' diverse and intriguing electronic phenomena. LiV2O4 heavy fermion behaviour challenges traditional theories in d-electron systems, LiTi2O4 being the first oxide superconductor provides critical insights into unconventional superconductivity driven by strong electron-phonon interactions, and MgTi2O4 pronounced orbital ordering and metalinsulator transition offers a clear model for exploring electron-lattice coupling. This shows how the inherent structural versatility of the spinel lattice, characterised by its cubic close-packed oxygen network and variable cation distributions, enables a rich interplay of electron-electron correlations, electron-lattice coupling, and orbital degrees of freedom. In LiV2O4, the combination of mixed-valence vanadium ions and a geometrically frustrated pyrochlore lattice gives rise to heavy fermion behaviour, whereas LiTi2O4 exhibits unconventional superconductivity driven by a high density of states at the Fermi level and strong electronphonon interactions. MgTi2O4 undergoes a pronounced metal-insulator transition, where orbital ordering triggers a Peierls-like distortion that stabilises a low-temperature insulating state through Ti-Ti dimerization. How the composition of these compounds affects their properties, based on both theoretical research and experimental findings, is illustrated by this review. It illustrates the promise of Spinels in practical technologies such as energy storage, electrocatalysis, and high-temperature lubrication.

We explore the emergence of topological phases in moiré MoTe$_2$/WSe$_2$ bilayer, highlighting the crucial role of spin-orbit coupling and Coulomb interactions at two holes per moiré unit cell $v = 2$. Our analysis uncovers robust Quantum Valley Hall Insulating (QVHI) phase and reveals that long-range interactions alone can mediate the interlayer electron tunneling, generating topologically nontrivial bands even in the absence of the corresponding single-particle hopping. Additionally, we show that in the case of band mixing terms originating both from the interaction and single particle physics a competition between topological states realizing $s$-$wave$ and $p\pm ip$-$wave$ symmetries can appear. Moreover, within the considered theoretical framework, we present that by introducing a small Zeeman field, one can lift the band inversion in one of the valleys. This leads to a Quantum Anomalous Hall Insulating (QAHI) state with the topological gap opening in a single valley and the other being topologically trivial.

The percolation, Ising, and O($n$) models constitute fundamental systems in statistical and condensed matter physics. For short-range-interacting cases, the nature of their phase transitions is well established by renormalization-group theory. However, the universality of the transitions in these models remains elusive when algebraically decaying long-range interactions $\sim 1/r^{d+σ}$ are introduced, where $d$ is the dimensionality and $σ$ is the decay exponent. Building upon insights from Lévy flight, i.e., long-range simple random walk, we propose three universality diagrams in the $(d,σ)$ plane for the percolation model, the O($n$) model, and the Fortuin-Kasteleyn Ising model, respectively. The conjectured universality diagrams are consistent with recent high-precision numerical studies and rigorous mathematical results, offering a unified perspective on critical phenomena in systems with long-range interactions.

Two-dimensional (2D) silicides are an emerging class of materials whose magnetic and relativistic properties remain largely unexplored. Using first-principles calculations, we investigate how electric-field modulation and transition-metal doping influence the magnetic exchange, magnetocrystalline anisotropy, and antisymmetric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in monolayer Ti2Si. Pristine Ti2Si is a dynamically stable ferromagnetic metal with in-plane anisotropy and centrosymmetric bonding, which suppresses DMI even under strong perpendicular electric fields. To overcome this symmetry constraint, we introduce Pt and Co substitution at Ti sites. Co enhances the magnetic exchange, whereas Pt provides strong spin orbit coupling (SOC), and the combined chemical asymmetry breaks inversion symmetry sufficiently to induce a sizable DMI. A Wannier-based tight-binding model captures the orbital-resolved superexchange pathways and reveals a clear hierarchy between a weak Si-mediated channel and a dominant Pt-mediated interlayer channel. First-principles calculations confirm that the Pt-assisted pathway governs the magnitude and sign of the total DMI. Among all configurations, Pt0.5CoTi0.5Si exhibits the strongest chiral interaction, with its intralayer and interlayer contributions favoring opposite rotation senses, namely counterclockwise (CCW) and clockwise (CW). Our results establish chemically engineered Ti2Si monolayers as a promising platform for realizing and tuning chiral magnetic textures in 2D silicides.

Quantized Thouless pumps in periodic systems, set by Chern numbers or Wannier-center winding, is by now fairly well established, whereas its quasi-periodic extensions still require further clarification. Here, we develop a general quantitative paradigm for bulk Thouless pumps in continuous models with spacetime quasi-periodicity, applicable to arbitrary spatial dimensions. Within this framework, the bulk pumping turns out to be governed by an emergent long wave-length effective potential. Based on this mechanism, we obtain our main result a universal relation between topological drifting and the geometry of quasi Brillouin zone. Reduced to periodic systems, our result gives an explicit and compact formula which enables us to directly calculate Chern numbers by microscopic data. These proposals are corroborated by simulations of one- and two-dimensional continuous moiré-type spacetime quasi-periodic lattices, which exhibit stable, localized, directional drift in excellent agreement with the theory.

Topological phases and modes, including pseudospin-Hall-selective edge transport and corner states, provide robust control of wave propagation and modal confinement in classical wave platforms. Under a tight-binding framework, we theoretically investigate two lattice designs derived from the kagome lattice. These extended kagome lattices support a series of localized modes, including pseudospin-Hall-like topological edge states and corner modes in different bandgaps and frequencies, which were not only achieved under lower lattice symmetries than Wu-Hu lattices, but also enable more degrees of freedom in topological and localized modes. By introducing two types of extended kagome lattices with different topological properties, multiple interesting phenomena, including newly emerged multiple groups of corner states, parametric tunable pseudospin Hall effect, and type-II corner states without long-range interactions, are found in theoretical models, which are possible and viable to achieve in artificial classical systems such as photonic, acoustic, or electrical circuits.

### Entanglement evolution from entangled multipodal states

- **TL;DR**: 论文研究了费米子系统中的纠缠多足态，这是交叉帽态的推广，具有多站点关联特性，并分析了其平衡和非平衡下的纠缠熵行为。

In a periodic lattice system an entangled antipodal pair state, otherwise known as a crosscap state, is a simple two site product state in which spins at antipodal sites are prepared in Bell pairs. Such states have maximal bipartite entanglement and serve as a useful platform for studying the quench dynamics of systems which have large initial entanglement. In this paper, we study a generalization of these states which we dub entangled mutipodal states. These states, which are defined for fermionic systems, generalize the crosscap states by having correlations among more than two sites, specifically, those which sit at the vertices of regular polygons. By construction, the states are Gaussian and translationally invariant allowing many of their properties to be understood. We study the bipartite entanglement entropy of these states both in and out of equilibrium. In equilibrium, the entanglement profile as a function of subsystem size exhibits two distinct regimes, a volume-law growth followed by a saturation to a constant value, thus generalizing the Page-curve profile of the crosscap state. In the non-equilibrium setting, we study quenches from these initial states to the free-fermion chain, whose ensuing dynamics displays a far richer structure compared to the crosscap case. We interpret our results in terms of the quasiparticle picture, which requires multiplets of quasiparticles to be excited non-locally around the system. This scenario is confirmed by the appearance of a post-quench, negative tripartite information.

We use ultrafast optical spectroscopy to investigate the electronic and lattice dynamics of the charge-density wave (CDW) material 1$T$-TiSe$_2$ across various temperatures and pump fluences. We reveal a close relationship between the observed ultrafast dynamical processes and two characteristic temperatures: $T_{\rm CDW}$ ($\sim$202 K) and $T^*$ ($\sim$165 K). Two coherent phonon modes are identified: a high-frequency $A_{1g}$ mode ($ω_{1}$) and a lower-frequency $A_{1g}$ CDW amplitude mode ($ω_{2}$). In stark contrast to thermal melting, where phonons soften, the CDW amplitude mode exhibits anomalous hardening (frequency upshift) with increasing pump fluence. We establish this hardening as the direct signature of an ultrafast restoration of the bare lattice potential. The photoexcited carrier plasma screens the long-range electron-phonon interactions that drive the Peierls-like instability, effectively ``undressing" the soft phonon and driving its frequency toward the stiffer value of the unrenormalized lattice. Furthermore, an abrupt increase in the excited state buildup time above a critical pump fluence marks a sharp boundary to a photoinduced metastable metallic state. These findings demonstrate that the CDW order in 1$T$-TiSe$_2$ is governed by a fragile, fluence-tunable competition between excitonic correlations and lattice dynamics.

Single-photon sources based on neutral or charged excitons in a semiconductor quantum dot are attractive resources for photonic quantum computers and simulators. To obtain indistinguishable photons, the source is pumped on resonance with polarized laser pulses, and the output is collected in orthogonal polarization. However, for sources featuring vertical emission of light, 50% of the emitted photons are unavoidably lost in this way. Here, we theoretically study the quantum dynamics of an exciton embedded in an asymmetric vertical cavity that favors emission in a specific polarization. We identify the configuration for optimal state initialization and demonstrate a path toward near-unity polarized efficiency. We also derive simple analytical formulas for the photon output in each polarization as a function of the Purcell-enhanced emission rates, which shed light on the physical mechanism behind our results.

### The exchange coupling of a Wigner dimer

We study the exchange coupling in small Wigner crystals confined to one-dimensional space. In particular we concentrate on the simplest nontrivial case of two electrons in a box potential and calculate analytically the energy splitting between the lowest spatially symmetric and antisymmetric states, which is a relevant energy scale for the magnetic properties of the system. In the approximation of a fixed center of mass coordinate, the splitting decays exponentially with the square root of the distance between the electrons at the leading order. We show that the subleading exponential correction significantly increases the splitting and thus becomes crucial in order to describe correctly the exact numerical data for system sizes that are not astronomically large. Two methods of calculation of the energy splitting are developed. The first is based on the analysis of the exact solution that can be expressed in terms of the Whittaker functions. It applies at all values of the short-distance cutoff played by the width of one-dimensional wire that regularizes the Coulomb potential. The second method is based on the quasiclassical (or Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin) approximation, which applies only for sufficiently large values of the cutoff. The two methods give identical result in the overlapping region. As a side result, our study gives the energy splitting in a triangular double well potential of inverse ``M'' shape.

Accurate temperature mapping at the nanoscale is a critical challenge in modern science and technology, as conventional methods fail at these dimensions. To address this challenge, we demonstrate a highly sensitive nanothermometer using anti-Stokes photoluminescence, also known as photoluminescence upconversion (UPL), in monolayer tungsten disulfide ($\mathrm{WS_2}$). Leveraging the direct band gap and strong exciton-phonon coupling in the two-dimensional monolayers, we achieve an exceptional relative sensitivity above $4\%\,\mathrm{K}^{-1}$ across the 300 K to 425 K range, ranking it among the best-performing materials reported. A strong resonantly enhanced UPL is observed, confirming the central role of optical phonons in the upconversion mechanism. Furthermore, we introduce a new analytical model to quantitatively describe the UPL process, taking into account the interplay of phonon populations, bandgap narrowing, and substrate effects, which predicts resonant temperatures and provides a framework with broad applicability to any material exhibiting an anti-Stokes photoluminescence response. To demonstrate its use as a high-resolution optical thermometer, we map a $20\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ thermal gradient across a $20\,μ\mathrm{m}$ long monolayer with a spatial resolution of $1\,μ\mathrm{m}$. With its high sensitivity, strong signal, and excellent reproducibility, our work establishes monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide as a leading platform for non-invasive thermal sensing in advanced microelectronic and biological systems.

- **TL;DR**: 倾斜狄拉克锥材料中非平衡电子弛豫具有各向异性，导致布里渊区特定方向产生瞬态热梯度，可诱导瞬态塞贝克效应

We point out that in the tilted Dirac cone materials the non-equilibrium (hot) electron relaxation with phonons is anisotropic in the Brillouin zone. It means that there is a preferential heating of the lattice degrees of freedom in the specific directions of the Brillouin zone, in particular, in the direction opposite to the tilt velocity in the model considered by us. This observation will have novel consequences: (1) With pump-probe spectroscopy applied to a given tilted Dirac cone material an anisotropic relaxation would lead to a transient anisotropic heating which can further lead to a transient Seebeck effect as transient thermal gradients would exist in the specific directions of the BZ, and (2) this direction of anisotropic heating can be controlled by controlling the direction of the tilt velocity which can be externally tuned by the application of an external pressure. We foresee novel applications of this effect in ultrafast sensor applications involving transient heating effects. This is equivalent to inducing a transient Seebeck effect by just shinning light on a tilted Dirac cone material!

We numerically and analytically study the transient dynamics of magnetic skyrmions in synthetic antiferromagnets under a magnetic field gradient. We consider skyrmions in a bilayer with antiferromagnetic coupling between the layers. The skyrmions in the two layers move almost perpendicular to the field gradient and the motion is eventually halted with the two skyrmions at a distance from each other. We find that the skyrmion displacement is proportional to the field gradient, while the time it takes to reach their final position is almost independent of it. Below a critical magnetic field gradient strength, the system displays an unusual 'remembering' dynamics: when the magnetic field gradient is removed, the skyrmions return to their original positions to a high degree of accuracy. We explain this observation and other quantitative features using a moduli space dynamics approximation. We further provide an exact treatment of the dynamics that indicates that deviations from exact memory of the skyrmion position can arise.

Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) host multiple competing structural and electronic phases, making them an ideal platform for constructing polytype heterostructures with emergent quantum properties. However, controlling phase transitions to form diverse heterostructures inside a single crystal remains challenging. Here, we realize vertical/lateral polytype heterostructures in a hole-doped Mott insulator via thermal-annealing-induced structural transitions. Raman spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning Kelvin probe force microscopy (SKPM) confirm the coexistence of T-H polytype heterostructures. Atomic-scale scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) measurements reveal the transparent effect in 1H/1T vertical heterostructures, where the charge density wave (CDW) of the underlying 1T-layer superposes on the top 1H-layer under positive bias. By systematically comparing 1T/1H and 1T/1T interfaces, we demonstrate that the metallic 1H-layer imposes a Coulomb screening effect on the 1T-layer, suppressing the formation of CDW domain walls and forming more ordered electronic states. These results clarify the interfacial coupling between distinct quantum many-body phases and establish a controllable pathway for constructing two-dimensional polytype heterostructures with tunable electronic properties.

Lattice degrees of freedom (DoF) play a central role in correlated electron systems, strongly influencing the dynamics of the underlying charge carriers and spin excitations. In nickelates, understanding the role of lattice is essential to unravel the interplay between charge, orbital, and spin degree of freedom in giving rise to various emergent phenomena reported recently. Here, we investigate the phononic DoF in a series of trilayer nickelates, namely Pr4-xLaxNi3O10 (where x = 0, 0.4, 1, 2, 3.6, and 4) using temperature and polarization dependent Raman scattering measurements. Our in-depth analysis of the phonon evolution with temperature and doping, gives interesting insights into the behaviour of these materials. All these systems undergo a metal-to-metal transition (TMMT), characterized by the development of intertwined spin and charge density waves, with the spin density wave preceding the charge density wave. These transitions manifest as pronounced anomalies in phonon self-energy parameters i.e. peak frequency and linewidth in the vicinity of the metal-to-metal transition. Several phonon modes show dramatic change (nearly an order of magnitude for some modes) in their softening rates across the TMMT, highlighting the sensitivity of the lattice dynamics to spin and charge order. These findings emphasize the crucial role of lattice DoF in mediating correlated ground states in layered nickelates.

Inspired by the remarkable ability of plasmons to boost radiative emission rates, we propose leveraging acoustic graphene plasmons (AGPs) to realize tunable, giant Purcell enhancements for single-photon, entangled-photon, and multipolar quantum emitters. These AGPs are localized inside a cavity defined by a graphene sheet and a metallic nanocube and filled with a dielectric of thickness of a few nanometers and consisting of stacked layers of 2D materials, containing impurities or defects that act as quantum light emitters. Through finite-difference time domain (FDTD) calculations, we show that this geometry can achieve giant Purcell enhancement factors over a large portion of the infrared (IR) spectrum, up to 6 orders of magnitude in the mid-IR and up to 4 orders of magnitude at telecommunications wavelengths, reaching quantum efficiencies of 95\% and 89\%, respectively, with high-mobility graphene. We obtain Purcell enhancement factors for single-photon electric dipole (E1), electric quadrupole (E2), and electric octupole (E3) transitions and two-photon spontaneous emission (2PSE) transitions, of the orders of $10^{4}$, $10^{7}$, $10^{9}$, and $10^9$, respectively, and a quantum efficiency of 79\% for entangled-photon emission with high-mobility graphene at a wavelength of $λ=1.55$ $μ$m. Importantly, AGP mode frequencies depend on the graphene Fermi energy, which can be tuned via electrostatic gating to modulate fluorescence enhancement in real time. As an example, we consider the Purcell enhancement of spontaneous single- and two-photon emissions from an erbium atom inside single-layer (SL) WS$_2$. Our results could be useful for electrically tunable quantum emitter devices with applications in quantum communication and quantum information processing.

Using quantum Monte Carlo and numerical analytic continuation methods, we study the dynamic spin structure factor and the single-hole spectral function of a two-dimensional quantum magnet ($J$-$Q$ model) at its quantum phase transition separating Néel antiferromagnetic and spontaneously dimerized ground states. At this putative deconfined quantum-critical point, we find a broad continuum of spinon excitations that can be accounted for by the fermionic $π$-flux state; a known mean-field model for deconfined quantum criticality. We find that the best description of the two-spinon continuum is with a version of the model with a $2\times 2$ unit cell, reflecting non-trivial mutual statistics of spinons and anti-spinons. The single-hole spectral function can be described by the same spinon dispersion relation and an independently propagating holon. Thus, the system exhibits spin-charge separation and will likely evolve into an extended holon metal phase at finite doping.

Bistability-two distinct stable states under identical parameter-is not only a fundamental physical concept but also of importance in practical applications. While plasmon-polaritonic bistability representing history-dependent stable states within plasmonic systems has been theoretically predicted, it has yet to be demonstrated experimentally due to challenges in realizing suitable nonlinearity at feasible electric-field strengths. Here, we report the experimental observation of electrically driven plasmon-polaritonic bistability in graphene/hexagonal-boron-nitride/graphene tunneling transistors, achieved through momentum-conserving resonant tunneling of Dirac electrons. Using a small twist angle between graphene layers, we engineered devices exhibiting both electronic and plasmon-polaritonic bistability. This bistable plasmonic behavior can be precisely tuned through load resistance and electrostatic gating. Our findings open new pathways for exploring nonlinear optical and electronic phenomena in van der Waals heterostructures and mark a significant advance in nanoplasmonics, with potential applications in optical memory, sensing, and optoelectronic switching.

The potential of hybrid improper ferroelectrics (HIFs) in electronic and spintronic devices hinges on their ability to switch polarization. Although the coupling between octahedral rotation and tilt is well established, the factors that govern switching barriers remain elusive. In this study, we explore this area to demonstrate the critical role of causal reasoning in uncovering the mechanisms to control the ferroelectric switching barrier in HIFs. By combining causal discovery, causal interventions, and first-principles simulations, we identify tolerance factor, A-site cation radii mismatch, epitaxial strain, and octahedral rotation/tilt as key parameters and quantify how their interplay directly influences switching barrier. Three key insights emerge from our work: (a) the analysis identifies the structural descriptors controlling polarization reversal across a broad family of A-site-layered double perovskites and superlattices, (b) it uncovers non-trivial, material-specific rotation-tilt mechanisms, including a counterintuitive cooperative pathway where both rotation and tilt change while lowering the barrier, an effect mostly inaccessible to conventional Landau or first-principles-based approaches and (c) it maps these material-specific mechanisms to experimentally realizable parameters, showing that epitaxial strain from orthorhombic substrates (e.g., NdScO$_3$, NdGaO$_3$) selectively tunes octahedral distortions to achieve barrier reduction across varied compositions. These results establish actionable, materials-by-design principles linking composition, structure, and strain to polarization switching, while highlighting the potential of causal reasoning to guide intelligent, mechanism-driven strategies for engineering complex functional oxides.

An excitonic insulator (EI) is a charge-neutral bosonic condensate of spontaneously formed electron-hole pairs. Exotic quantum phenomena such as dissipationless charge neutral transport and huge potential for optoelectronic applications have led to an extensive search for intrinsic bulk materials that are EIs at ambient pressure without sophisticated device fabrication. The narrow gap semimetal Ta2NiSe5 has been proposed as a rare example of an intrinsic EI, but its ground state has remained controversial since the EI phase transition is accompanied by a structural distortion. Here, we use scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy to present microscopic evidence that supports an excitonic origin of the insulating phase in Ta2NiSe5. First, we find that the insulating gap persists at structural domain boundaries where the bulk structural distortion is absent suggesting that the structural distortion is not the primary origin of insulating ground state. Second, the insulating gap is suppressed at localized charge puddles which indicates that charge correlations are important in producing the insulating gap. Finally, the decay length of the in-gap states at the puddles shows similar value to the estimated size of the exciton wavefunction from previous photoemission studies. Taken together, these findings suggest that Ta2NiSe5 is an EI and may be a versatile platform to study the physics of bosonic condensates in solid-state system at ambient conditions.

We advocate for a deeper theoretical understanding of the many-body aspects of these systems to gain insights into helical liquids and the potential stabilization of topological zero modes.

- **TL;DR**: MBE生长的WSe2单层在弱磁场下缺陷束缚激子的光学取向效率显著增强，与剥离样品相比具有相似性但存在定量差异，赝自旋弛豫时间更短。

We report an experimental study of the magnetic-field dependence of the optically pumped valley polarization in an epitaxial tungsten diselenide (WSe$_2$) monolayer grown by molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE) on a hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) substrate. Circularly polarized photoluminescence (PL) measurements reveal that applying a weak out-of-plane magnetic field, on the order of 0.1 T, dramatically increases the effectiveness of the optical orientation of the emission associated with defect-bound localized excitons. We compare the obtained results with the earlier studies on the reference exfoliated monolayers, discussing both qualitative similarity as well as quantitative differences. Our observations are further supplemented by the results of time-resolved PL measurements, which confirm the pseudospin relaxation time of approximately 25 ps, a value significantly shorter than the $\approx$100 ps previously reported for mechanically exfoliated samples.

While machine learning has enabled the rapid prediction of inorganic materials with novel properties, the challenge of determining how to synthesize these materials remains largely unsolved. Previous work has largely focused on predicting precursors or reaction conditions, but only rarely on full synthesis pathways. We introduce the ActionGraph, a directed acyclic graph framework that encodes both the chemical and procedural structure, in terms of synthesis operations, of inorganic synthesis reactions. Using 13,017 text-mined solid-state synthesis reactions from the Materials Project, we show that incorporating PCA-reduced ActionGraph adjacency matrices into a $k$-nearest neighbors retrieval model significantly improves synthesis pathway prediction. While the ActionGraph framework only results in a 1.34% and 2.76% increase in precursor and operation F1 scores (average over varying numbers of PCA components) respectively, the operation length matching accuracy rises 3.4 times (from 15.8% to 53.3%). We observe an interesting trade-off where precursor prediction performance peaks at 10-11 PCA components while operation prediction continues improving up to 30 components. This suggests composition information dominates precursor selection while structural information is critical for operation sequencing. Overall, the ActionGraph framework demonstrates strong potential, and with further adoption, its full range of benefits can be effectively realized.

Spin field-effect transistors (SFETs) are promising candidates for low-power spin-based electronics, yet existing realizations that rely on spin-orbit coupling are constrained by limited material choices and short spin-coherence lengths. Here we propose a different operating principle based on multiferroic altermagnets, in which spin splitting is tuned by an electric field through symmetry control rather than conventional spin-orbit physics. Using an effective model combined with quantum transport simulations, we show that the conductance is determined by the degree of matching between the electrically controlled spin texture of the channel and the fixed spin polarization of ferromagnetic contacts, enabling clear ON and OFF states. Remarkably, we also address a long-standing challenge in multiferroic device design: spintronic channels require metallic carriers, whereas ferroelectricity is usually suppressed in metals. We resolve this conflict by imprinting multiferroic altermagnetism into highly conductive materials via the proximity effect. First-principles calculations for graphene on multiferroic vanadium sulfide halides confirm that graphene acquires a ferroelectrically switchable spin splitting while retaining its metallic character. These results establish a practical route to SFET implementation and identify multiferroic altermagnets as a versatile platform for next-generation spintronic devices.

### Learning interpretable surface elasticity properties from bulk properties

Surface elasticity is central to understanding the mechanics and stability of surfaces and interfaces. It is characterized by quantities such as surface tension, residual surface stress, and surface stiffness, however their analytical expressions are typically difficult to derive from atomistic data, and depend strongly on modeling choices. This work presents a neural network-based equation learner which combines customized activation functions and connection-based pruning to discover parsimonious, closed-form equations for surface elasticity from atomistic simulations. Applying the method to seven face centered cubic (FCC) metals, our equation learner uncovers interpretable equations that describe both low-Miller index and high-Miller index surface properties, capturing long-tail property distributions accurately. The discovered expressions are decoupled into two components: a universal, geometry-driven orientation function, and material-specific baseline coefficients. We find that lower-order properties such as surface tension are fundamentally geometry dependent, while higher-order properties such as surface stress and elasticity show more complex geometry and material dependence. We also relate material dependent coefficients to bulk properties, forming a clear map from bulk material properties to surface elasticity. Overall, this approach demonstrates that interpretable neurosymbolic machine learning can bridge the gap between atomistic simulations and physical laws, enabling the discovery of generalizable structure-property relationships for materials science phenomena such as surface elasticity.
