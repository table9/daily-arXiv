- **TL;DR**: 开发了描述高温超导铜氧化物的金兹堡-朗道理论框架，其中短程电荷密度调制与d波超导凝聚耦合，形成调制电子晶格态，能增强超流刚度并产生可验证的实验预测。

We develop a phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau (GL) framework for high-$T_c$ cuprates in which a short-range modulation of the electronic charge density couples to a $d$-wave superconducting condensate. The resulting modulated electron lattice (MEL) state is distinct from long-range static charge density wave order: it is short range, partially phase coherent, and linked to superconducting coherence. A preferred wave vector $q^{\ast} \approx 0.3$ reciprocal lattice units along the Cu-O bond direction emerges from the interplay between a momentum-dependent susceptibility and bond-stretching phonons, consistent with neutron and x-ray data on YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-δ}$ and related cuprates. The GL free energy contains coupled $d$-wave superconducting and charge sectors with parameters constrained by optimally doped YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-δ}$. We identify an MEL enhancement window in doping, temperature, MEL correlation length, and disorder where a coherence linked modulation enhances the superfluid stiffness. Classical Monte Carlo simulations yield an in-plane stiffness enhancement of order ten percent, which we treat as a qualitative prediction to be tested by self-consistent Bogoliubov de Gennes calculations. The MEL framework yields falsifiable experimental signatures. For scanning tunneling spectroscopy in Bi-based cuprates we highlight two predictions: the Fourier-transformed local density of states should exhibit a $q^{\ast} \approx 0.3$ peak whose spectral weight sharpens as superconducting phase coherence develops below $T_c$, in contrast to static charge scenarios, and the local gap magnitude $Δ(r)$ should correlate positively with the local MEL amplitude. The framework implies correlations between MEL correlation length, superfluid stiffness, disorder, and vortex pinning, and organizes cuprate observations into testable STM/STS predictions.

- **TL;DR**: 论文提出双桥机制解释高温超导：通过氧/金属原子桥接的电子-空穴强耦合配对（桥-I）形成库珀对，桥-II原子诱导库珀对间吸引作用，促进所有库珀对凝聚进入超导态。

The cuprate Hg0.8Tl0.2Ba2Ca2Cu3O8.33 exhibits the highest superconducting transition temperature Tc of 138K. Achieving superconductivity at even higher temperatures, up to room temperature, represents the ultimate dream of humanity. As temperature increases, Cooper pairs formed through weak electron-phonon coupling will be disintegrated by the thermal motion of electrons, severely limiting the enhancement of Tc. It is imperative to explore new strong-coupling pairing pictures and establish novel condensation mechanism of Cooper pairs at higher temperature. Based on our recently proposed groundbreaking idea of electron e- (hole h+) pairing bridged by oxygen O (metal M) atoms, namely, the eV-scale ionic-bond-driven atom-bridge (bridge-I) e--O-e- (h+-M-h+) strong-coupling itinerant Cooper pairing formed at pseudogap temperature T*&gt;Tc in ionic oxide superconductors, we further discover that there is an attractive interaction between two Cooper pairs induced by the bridge atom (bridge-II) located between them. It is this attraction mediated by the bridge-II atoms that promotes all the Cooper pairs within the CuO2 plane to hold together and enter the superconducting state at Tc finally. Moreover, according to the Bose-Einstein condensation theory, we find that Tc is inversely proportional to the effective mass m* of Cooper pairs, directly proportional to n2/3s (ns: the density of Cooper pairs), and linearly increases with the scattering length a&lt;0 due to attraction between two Cooper pairs. Therefore, according to our double-bridge mechanism of high-Tc superconductivity, increasing the attraction between Cooper pair and bridge-II atom, ensuring that ns takes the optimal value, and minimizing the effective mass of the Cooper pairs are the main approaches to enhancing Tc of ionic-bonded superconductors, which opens up a new avenue with clear direction for designing higher Tc superconductors.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究结合理论与实验，构建了Ca-H体系的精确温压相图，发现考虑非谐效应后，I型笼状结构Ca8H46-δ在0K下热力学稳定，而先前预测的CaH6相需在500K以上才稳定，揭示了温度和非谐效应对高压氢化物相稳定的重要作用。

The prediction of superconductivity above 200 K in CaH6 revolutionized research on hydrogen-rich superconductors, and subsequent experiments have verified this prediction, while unidentified peaks in XRD and the decrease in superconducting temperature upon decompression indicate that unresolved issues remain. In this work, we combine theory and experiment to construct an accurate temperature-pressure phase diagram of the Ca-H system and identify the stability ranges of the candidate superconducting phases by considering anharmonic effects. Our results demonstrate that type-I clathrate Ca8H46-delta structures become thermodynamically stable at 0 K when anharmonic effects are considered. Notably, we found that the previously predicted CaH6 phase achieves stability above 500 K, underscoring the significant role of temperature and anharmonic effects in stabilizing this intriguing high-pressure phase. Experimentally, we have successfully synthesized Ca8H46-delta phases at low temperatures, thereby validating our theoretical predictions. Our findings offer insights into the structure and superconducting mechanisms of hydrides.

- **TL;DR**: KMn6Bi5在低温下表现出各向同性双能带行为和大磁阻，随温度升高转变为单能带，磁阻受自旋涨落抑制，低温电阻上升与磁阻标度行为相关。

Quasi-one-dimensional materials $A$Mn$_6$Bi$_5$ ($A$ = Na, K, Rb, Cs) exhibit unique electronic behaviors such as antiferromagnetism, charge density waves, and pressure-induced superconductivity. Thus, they serve as a suitable model system to investigate emergent quantum phenomena produced by the interactions among spin, charge, and lattice. Here we report the magnetotransport properties of KMn$_6$Bi$_5$, revealing a cascade of temperature-dependent carrier dynamics. Below 5 K, the system, despite its anisotropic electronic structure, could be effectively described by an isotropic two-band model and exhibits a large, non-saturating magnetoresistance ($\propto B^{1.8}$). Upon warming, a crossover to a single-band regime occurs around 20 K, driven by the suppression of a hole pocket. Electron density recovers as antiferromagnetic gap openings gradually close from 25 to 70 K which is just below the N$\mathrm{\acute{e}}$el temperature. Within this temperature range, field-quenched spin fluctuations suppress magnetoresistance. Furthermore, we attribute the low-temperature resistivity upturn to the scaling behavior of magnetoresistance. These findings provide crucial insights into the interplay of dimensionality, magnetism, and electron correlations in quasi-one-dimensional magnetic semimetals.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文提出了一种激子方法，用于研究受限半导体在莫特转变以下高密度条件下的超快光学响应，涵盖从相干激子跃迁和双激子主导的相干区到激子占据主导的非相干区。

An excitonic approach to the ultrafast optical response of confined semiconductors at elevated densities below the Mott transition is presented. The theory is valid from the coherent regime, where coherent excitonic transitions and biexcitons dominate, to the incoherent regime, where excitonic occupations dominate. Numerical simulations of the $1s$ exciton dynamics during intense circularly polarized pump pulses in two different Coulomb-interaction regimes are performed for two-dimensional semiconductors: Moderate Coulomb interaction is compared with dominating Coulomb interaction with respect to the light-matter interaction strength. The different many-body contributions are disentangled and it is found, that excitonic Rabi oscillations in the Coulomb-dominated regime are considerably less strong. By also comparing circular and linear excitation in a MoSe$_2$ monolayer, it is found, that linear excitation creates a regime, where excitonic Rabi oscillations are almost completely suppressed.

### Nonanalytic Fermi-liquid correction to the specific heat of RuO$_2$

- **TL;DR**: RuO₂作为反铁磁候选材料，其磁性本质存在争议。高质量单晶表现为顺磁金属，但低温比热偏离传统费米液体行为，出现非解析修正项，表明存在弱关联3D费米液体态。

The magnetic nature of the altermagnet candidate RuO$_2$ remains under debate. It has been recently shown from quantum oscillations and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) that the high-quality RuO$_2$ bulk single crystal is a paramagnetic metal. However, the low-temperature specific heat exhibits a clear deviation from the conventional $C(T)$=$γT$ + $βT^3$ dependence; it is well described with nonanalytic Fermi-liquid correction for a clean paramagnetic metal: $C(T)$ = $γT$ + $βT^3$ + $δT^3 \textrm{ln}(T/T^*)$. Correspondingly, the magnetic susceptibility is well fitted with the inclusion of $T^2\textrm{ln}T$ term as well as $H^2\mathrm{ln}H$ term. In contrast to the spin fluctuation mechanism applicable to some heavy-electron compounds with positive $δ$, RuO$_2$ shows negative $δ$ suggesting a different origin. The observation of such nonanalytic Fermi liquid corrections is attributable to the availability of an ultra-clean sample. The electronic specific heat, the magnetic susceptibility, and the $T^2$ coefficient in resistivity point to a weakly-correlated 3D Fermi-liquid state with a modest electron correlation, as supported by the Wilson and Kadowaki-Woods ratios.

- **TL;DR**: 提出利用晶格应变作为探测量子自旋液体中分数化激发的有效方法，通过机械形变产生赝磁场，诱导赝朗道能级作为特征光谱信号。

Quantum spin liquids (QSLs) host emergent, fractionalized fermionic excitations that are charge-neutral. Identifying clear experimental signatures of these excitations remains a central challenge in the field of strongly correlated systems, as they do not couple to conventional electromagnetic probes. Here, we propose lattice strain as a powerful and tunable probe: Mechanical deformation of the lattice generates large pseudomagnetic fields, inducing pseudo-Landau levels that serve as distinctive spectroscopic signatures of these excitations. Using the Kitaev model on the honeycomb lattice, we show that distinct QSL phases exhibit strikingly different strain responses. The semimetallic Kitaev spin liquid and the gapped chiral spin liquid display pronounced Landau quantization and a diamagnetic-like response to strain, whereas the Majorana metal phase shows a paramagnetic-like response without forming Landau levels. These contrasting behaviors provide a direct route to experimentally identifying and distinguishing QSL phases hosting fractionalized excitations. We further outline how local resonant ultrasound spectroscopy can detect the strain-induced resonances associated with these responses, offering a practical pathway towards identifying fractionalized excitations in candidate materials.

### AtomDisc: An Atom-level Tokenizer that Boosts Molecular LLMs and Reveals Structure--Property Associations

- **TL;DR**: AtomDisc是一个将原子级局部环境量化为结构感知token的新框架，直接嵌入LLM的token空间，在分子性质预测和生成任务上达到SOTA性能。

Advances in large language models (LLMs) are accelerating discovery in molecular science. However, adapting molecular information to the serialized, token-based processing of LLMs remains a key challenge. Compared to other representations, molecular graphs explicitly encode atomic connectivity and local topological environments, which are key determinants of atomic behavior and molecular properties. Despite recent efforts to tokenize overall molecular topology, there still lacks effective fine-grained tokenization of local atomic environments, which are critical for determining sophisticated chemical properties and reactivity. To address these issues, we introduce AtomDisc, a novel framework that quantizes atom-level local environments into structure-aware tokens embedded directly in LLM's token space. Our experiments show that AtomDisc, in a data-driven way, can distinguish chemically meaningful structural features that reveal structure-property associations. Equipping LLMs with AtomDisc tokens injects an interpretable inductive bias that delivers state-of-the-art performance on property prediction and molecular generation. Our methodology and findings can pave the way for constructing more powerful molecular LLMs aimed at mechanistic insight and complex chemical reasoning.

### Kappa Entropy and its Thermodynamic Connection

Adopting a bottom-up perspective, we propose a novel two-parametric nonadditive entropy, $S_{κ\ell}$, associated with a Kappa-type power-law velocity distribution, $F_{κ\ell}(v)$, recently derived in the literature. By formulating an extended Neo-Boltzmannian microstate counting procedure and employing standard averaging techniques, we demonstrate that the fundamental laws of thermodynamics are preserved within this generalized power-law framework only whether $\ell=-5/2$, regardless of the values assumed by the $κ$-parameter.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种用于计算谱密度的高阶delta-Chebyshev方法，特别适用于稀疏哈密顿量的局域态密度计算，相比传统KPM方法能更快收敛到热力学极限。

We introduce a numerical method for computing spectral densities, and apply it to the evaluation of the local density of states (LDOS) of sparse Hamiltonians derived from tight-binding models. The approach, which we call the high-order delta-Chebyshev method, can be viewed as a variant of the popular regularized Chebyshev kernel polynomial method (KPM), but it uses a high-order accurate approximation of the $δ$-function to achieve rapid convergence to the thermodynamic limit for smooth spectral densities. The costly computational steps are identical to those for KPM, with high-order accuracy achieved by an inexpensive post-processing procedure. We apply the algorithm to tight-binding models of graphene and twisted bilayer graphene, demonstrating high-order convergence to the LDOS at non-singular points.

### Proximity-induced superconductivity in magnetic topological insulator films

- **TL;DR**: 该论文开发了一个分析模型，研究普通s波超导体在磁性拓扑绝缘体薄膜上诱导邻近效应的机制，揭示了拓扑、磁性和超导性之间的相互作用。

Inducing superconducting correlations in magnetic topological insulators (MTIs) is emerging as a promising route toward the realization of topological superconductivity and Majorana modes. Here, we develop an analytical model for the proximity effect induced by an ordinary s-wave superconductor (SC) placed on top of a MTI thin film with finite thickness. Using a perturbative approach with respect to the electron tunneling between MTI and SC, we derive the leading-order correction to the anomalous Green's function and evaluate the position-dependent induced pairing as a function of all the system parameters. This framework allows us to resolve the spatial, spin, and momentum structure of the induced superconducting order parameter. In particular, we derive an explicit expression for the decay length of the pairing amplitude at the $k_x=k_y=0$ point, and show that increasing magnetization enhances the spin-polarized triplet components and the p-wave contributions of the anomalous Green's function. These findings highlight the interplay between topology, magnetism, and superconductivity in MTI films, providing analytical insight into the emergence of unconventional pairing symmetries relevant for the realization of Majorana modes in finite geometries.

The fluorescence of triplet excitons and color-centers is strongly dependent on magnetic field that mixes the zero field spin eigenstates that determine the radiative recombination rates back into the singlet ground state through spin-orbit coupling. For films of molecules, and polycristaline color-centers samples an average over molecular orientations has to be performed to model the magneto-fluorescence lineshapes. This limits our analytical understanding of the lineshapes and complicates the analysis of the fluorescence dependence on magnetic field. Here, we present a framework that allows to average over triplet molecular orientations analytically. Our approach achieves provides very accurate numerical routines computing precisely the averages matrix elements that appear in magneto-fluorescence and semi-analytical approximations that can be used to model experimental traces.

Materials utilized by novel energy systems are often studied using weakly correlated mean-field theories. However, if these systems incorporate heavy elements or strongly correlated topological materials, relativistic effects must be included. Therefore, we present an unrestricted coupled-cluster with single and double excitation formalism (CCSD) within a molecular mean-field exact-two component framework (X2Cmmf) using a restricted Dirac-Hartree-Fock (DHF) reference state. Our mean-field transformation utilizes the one-electron, Dirac-Coulomb, Dirac-Coulomb-Gaunt and Dirac-Coulomb-Breit Hamiltonian. The code was bench-marked against DIRAC which also uses DHF-X2Cmmf accounting for the Dirac-Coulomb and Dirac-Coulomb-Gaunt Hamiltonian. The dipole moments of Li-H, and Cl-F were calculated using an approximate molecular to atomic basis transformation and compared to experiment. The CCSD energy showed agreement with DIRAC to around ten to the power of minus four Hartree and exhibited a small variation of the dipole moment with the introduction of higher order electron-electron interactions. This paper allows for study of relativistic processes within this mean-field approach and lays the foundation for future theoretical development of relativistic Coupled-Cluster Theory using a DHF reference state within this framework.

Multilayer graphene with different stacking sequences has emerged as a powerful setting for correlated and topological phases. In parallel, progress in graphene heterostructures with magnetic or correlated materials-most notably the Kitaev candidate $α$-RuCl$_3$-has demonstrated charge transfer, magnetic proximity effects, and interfacial reconstruction, creating new opportunities for engineered quantum systems. Motivated by these developments, we explore a three-dimensional analogue in which $α$-RuCl$_3$ layers are inserted directly into the van der Waals gaps of graphite, forming an intercalated system. Here, we report the successful synthesis and comprehensive characterization of graphite intercalated with $α$-RuCl$_3$. Using a combination of X-ray diffraction, quantum oscillation measurements, and first-principles electronic structure calculations, we study the structural and electronic properties of these intercalated crystals. Our results demonstrate that graphite intercalated with $α$-RuCl$_3$ offers a robust route to develop three-dimensional materials with access to novel correlated and topological states.

Surfactants play an important role in determining the cleaning performance and stability of detergents. However, the design of new surfactants using traditional methods is often time-consuming, complex, and largely based on trial and error. Recent studies have incorporated data-driven and computational approaches to generate new surfactants and predict properties of surfactants, but most of these approaches either optimize on a single property or train on a small number of surfactants. In this work, we investigate the generative capabilities of an existing graph diffusion based inverse design model and a transformer based molecule optimization model, for non-ionic surfactants. We train both models to generate non-ionic surfactants based on single- and multi-property values, predict the same properties o using trained property predictor models for generated molecules, and validate a few them using molecular dynamics simulations. Our results reveal that the inverse design model is better at generating a diverse set of molecules, while the transformer is better at generating molecules which satisfy input property constraints better. We also observe that molecules generated using single property condition, on average, satisfy the input property condition better when compared to molecules generated using multiple property conditions. From molecular dynamics simulations, we observe that the predicted properties of the selected molecules are close to the simulated results concluding that both methods are capable of generating surfactants that actually satisfy input property condtions.

### Symmetry Breaking of Current Response in Disordered Exclusion Processes

The bias-reversal symmetry -- where reversing an external bias inverts the current without changing its magnitude -- is a hallmark of nonequilibrium transport. While this property holds in homogeneous systems such as the asymmetric simple exclusion process, how disorder and its interplay with particle interactions affect this symmetry has remained unclear. Here, we establish a general criterion showing that the bias-reversal symmetry holds if and only if the local left-right bond-bias ratio is spatially uniform. Analytical and numerical analyses reveal that bond disorder preserves the symmetry beyond linear response, whereas site disorder breaks it through an interplay between heterogeneity and particle interactions. Our results demonstrate how environmental disorder and interparticle interactions cooperate to generate asymmetric transport, thereby providing a unified theoretical framework relevant to transport through biological and artificial nanochannels.

Coarse graining (CG) is an important task for efficient modeling and simulation of complex multi-scale systems, such as the conformational dynamics of biomolecules. This work presents a projection-based coarse-graining formalism for general underdamped Langevin dynamics. Following the Zwanzig projection approach, we derive a closed-form expression for the coarse grained dynamics. In addition, we show how the generator Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (gEDMD) method, which was developed in the context of Koopman operator methods, can be used to model the CG dynamics and evaluate its kinetic properties, such as transition timescales. Finally, we combine our approach with thermodynamic interpolation (TI), a generative approach to transform samples between thermodynamic conditions, to extend the scope of the approach across thermodynamic states without repeated numerical simulations. Using a two-dimensional model system, we demonstrate that the proposed method allows to accurately capture the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of the full-space model.

We study the $ab$-plane and $c$-axis charge dynamics of La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10}$ using optical spectroscopy. While a pronounced Drude profile, i.e. metallic response, is observed in the $ab$-plane optical conductivity $σ_{1}^{ab}(ω)$, the $c$-axis optical spectra $σ_{1}^{c}(ω)$ exhibit semiconducting behavior. The zero-frequency extrapolation of the optical conductivity $σ_{1}(ω\rightarrow 0) \equiv 1/ρ_{\text{dc}}$ gives a resistivity anisotropy of $ρ_{c}/ρ_{ab} \simeq 366$ at 300 K for La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10}$, which is much larger than the values in iron-based superconductors but comparable to those in high-$T_{c}$ cuprates. The interband response is also highly anisotropic, showing salient orbital selectivity for light polarized in the $ab$ plane and along the $c$ axis. The interband-transition peaks in both $σ_{1}^{ab}(ω)$ and $σ_{1}^{c}(ω)$ are located at lower energies compared to density-functional-theory predictions, signifying considerable electronic correlations. By investigating the spectral weight transfer, we find that in the pristine phase, Coulomb correlations have a marked impact on the charge dynamics of \LNO, whereas in the density-wave state, a gap opens with the Ni-$d_{z^{2}}$ orbital being involved.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究在二维反铁磁半导体CrSBr中实现了一种结合垂直和横向传输的自旋晶体管，展示了门电压可调的巨磁阻效应和可训练的层共享效应，为逻辑存算一体架构提供了新途径。

Integrating semiconducting and magnetic materials could combine transistor-like operation with nonvolatility and enable architectures such as logic-in-memory. Here, we employ correlated electrical transport and scanning nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center magnetic imaging to elucidate a spin transistor concept that amalgamates both vertical and lateral transport in a 2D antiferromagnetic semiconductor, distinct from purely vertical tunneling devices. Our device, based on a monolayer-bilayer junction in CrSBr, displays giant, gate-tunable magnetoresistance driven by the dual action of electrostatic doping on space-charge-limited lateral conduction and interlayer exchange coupling. Moreover, we visualize a field-trainable, layer-sharing effect that selects between coherent or domain-wall reversal at the spin-flip transition, enabling multilevel, memristive conductance states. These findings open opportunities for 2D magnetic semiconductors to address limitations in contemporary computing.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究通过计算机模拟首次揭示了ZIF-8 MOF的生长机制，发现非经典生长机制涉及寡聚体附着，且在高浓度条件下更显著。生长层保留种子晶体孔结构但含有缺陷位点，这些缺陷随浓度和温度增加而增多。

Designing metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) synthesis protocols is currently largely driven by trial-and-error, since we lack fundamental understanding of the molecular level mechanisms that underlie their self-assembly processes. Previous works have studied the nucleation of MOFs, but their growth has never been studied by means of computer simulations, which provide molecular level detail. In this work, we combine constant chemical potential simulations with a particle insertion method to model the growth of the ZIF-8 MOF at varying synthesis temperatures and concentrations of the reactants. Non-classical growth mechanisms triggered by oligomer attachments were detected, with a higher predominance in the most concentrated setups. The newly formed layers preserve the pore-like density profile of the seed crystal but contain defective sites characterized by the presence of 3, 5 and 7 membered rings, typical of amorphous phases. Compared to the amorphous intermediate species obtained at the nucleation part of the self-assembly process previously investigated in our group [Chem. Mater., doi: 10.1021/acs.chemmater.5c02028, 2025], larger-sized rings are more common in the grown layer. Moreover, these are favored by increasing reactant concentration and temperature, as is the degree of deviation with respect to the original crystal structure. We computed growth rates for the steady-state regime, and the non-linear tendency with respect to concentration leads us to hypothesize that in these conditions the growth is controlled by the adsorption rather than by the diffusion processes.

We prove formally that the momentum-mixing Hatsugai-Kohmoto model (MMHK) is the Hubbard model with a twist. With this result in tow, we rely on the proof of Watanabe's that two models which differ by a twist must have the same bulk physics. Consequently, we have proven that MMHK=Hubbard in the charge sector.

In this work, we combine the density functional tight-binding (DFTB) approach with a light-matter Hamiltonian beyond the long-wavelength approximation to propagate the dynamics of vibrational polaritons formed by coupling molecular vibrations to confined radiation inside a Fabry-Pérot optical cavity. Here, we develop a parallelized propagation scheme with lightweight inter-CPU communication by exploiting the sparse nature of the light-matter interactions in the real space representation. We find that the computationally expensive Born charges required for our propagation can be replaced with the computationally inexpensive Mulliken charges to obtain qualitatively accurate linear spectra especially when the nonlinearity (arising from molecular vibrations) of the light-matter interaction term is not substantial. However, the same approach may not be suitable to be used for studying cavity modification of energy transport or chemical dynamics as this approximation leads to spurious heating of the light-matter hybrid system. We demonstrate the utility of this on-the-fly approach to compute angle resolved polaritonic spectra of water. We implement our approach as an open-source computational package, CavOTF, which is available on GitHub.

The behavior of dimensionless quantities defined as ratios of partition functions is analyzed to investigate phase transitions and critical phenomena. At criticality, the universal values of these ratios can be predicted from conformal field theory (CFT) through the modular-invariant partition functions on a torus. We perform numerical calculations using the bond-weighted tensor renormalization group for three two-dimensional models belonging to different universality classes: the Ising model, the three-state Potts model, and the four-state Potts model. The partition-function ratios obey the same finite-size scaling form as the Binder parameter, and their critical values agree well with the universal values predicted by CFT. In the four-state Potts model, we observe logarithmic corrections in the system-size dependence of these ratios.

The Born-Rytov approximation estimates effective refractive index of biological cells from measurements of scattered light intensity, polarization and phase. Effective refractive index is useful for estimating a biological cell's dry mass, volume, and internal morphology directly from its elastic light scattering pattern. This work compares the Born-Rytov approximation with analytical, Yee-lattice finite-difference time-domain, and discrete-dipole approximations to Maxwell's equations in the cases of electromagnetic scattering from a sphere and a tomographic reconstruction of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Practical advantages and limitations of each numerical method are compared for modeling electromagnetic scattering of both near-field intensity and the far-field projected intensity, in terms of accuracy, memory, and compute time. When compared with a commercial software implementation of the Yee-lattice finite-difference time domain method, the Born-Rytov scattering approximation and discrete dipole approximation show better agreement with the far-field light scattering pattern from Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

The binary metal borides provide a promising platform for searching unique materials with superconductivity and super-hardness under high pressure, owing to the distinctive bonding characters of boron. In this work, combined the first-principles calculations and crystal structure predictions, we predicted 4 exotic stoichiometries and 8 unique U-B compounds under high pressure. The predicted compounds have layered or caged structure units and 4 of them host high hardness under ambient pressure. By removal of the U atoms, we predicted three meta-stable boron clathrates at ambient pressure. Remarkably, the Vickers hardness of the predicted C2/m-B6 is estimated to be 49-53 GPa, and the C2/m-B12 is superconducting with the Tc value of 16.12 K. Our calculations enrich the phase diagram of binary metal borides and boron allotropes, providing insights for the future theoretical and experimental studies on unique materials.

### Current switching behaviour mediated via hinge modes in higher order topological phase using altermagnets

We propose a theoretical framework to engineer hybrid-order and higher-order topological phases in three-dimensional topological insulators by coupling to $d$-wave altermagnets (AMs). Presence of only $d_{x^2-y^2}$-type AM drives the system into a hybrid-order topological phase where both first-order and second-order topological phases coexist. This phase is characterized by spectral analysis, low-energy surface theory, dipolar and quadrupolar winding numbers, and it's signature is further confirmed by two-terminal differential conductance calculations. Incorporation of the $d_{x^2-z^2}$-type AM drives the system into two second-order topological insulator phases hosting distinct type of hinge modes. They are also topologically characterized by spectral analysis, topological invariants, low-energy surface thoery, and transport calculations. Importantly, the localization and direction of propagation of these one-dimensional hinge modes are controllable by tuning the relative strengths of the alermagnetic exchange orders. We utilize this feature to propose a tunable current-switching behaviour mediated via the hinge modes. Our results establish AMs based hybrid structure as a versatile platform for controllable higher-order topology and hinge-mediated device applications.

- **TL;DR**: 使用GaAs/AlAs超晶格替代AlGaAs的分布式布拉格反射镜设计，显著降低界面粗糙度，实现高质量微腔制备

We present an approach to the molecular-beam epitaxy of high-Q planar GaAs-based microcavities in which the AlGaAs high-index layers of the distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs) are replaced by short-period GaAs/AlAs superlattices (digital alloys) with similar optical properties. This design enables a significant reduction of interface roughness, precise control of the quarter-wavelength optical thickness and the effective Al content, suppression of the propagation of structural defects, and efficient tuning of intrinsic absorption at the polariton emission wavelength via optimization of the superlattice parameters.
  Using this approach, we fabricate a microcavity with a low polariton-lasing threshold of approximately 200 W/cm$^2$ and a high experimental quality factor of about 5.4 x $10^4$. This value exceeds by almost a factor of two the theoretical estimate obtained within an equivalent ternary-alloy model. We demonstrate that accurate modeling of the stop-band characteristics and the Q factor requires incorporating the modified electronic density of states in the superlattice, including quantum-confinement and excitonic effects.

Results of combined thermal and electrical transport measurements through the magnetic field-induced quantum critical point in the heavy-fermion compound YbRh2Si2 are revisited to explore the relationship between the strange-metal behavior, observed in both the electrical and electronic thermal resistivity, and the violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law in the zero-temperature limit. A new type of inelastic scattering center for the charge and heat carriers has been detected and ascribed to the small-to-large Fermi-surface fluctuations. These are operating in the vicinity of and at the Kondo-destroying quantum critical point as fermionic quantum critical fluctuations and are considered the primary driver of the strange-metal behavior and the violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law.

### Structural and Dynamical Crossovers in Dense Electrolytes

Electrostatic interactions fundamentally govern the structure and transport of electrolytes. In concentrated electrolytes, however, electrostatic and steric correlations, together with ion-solvent coupling, give rise to complex behavior, such as underscreening, that remains challenging to explain despite extensive theoretical effort. Using molecular dynamics simulations of primitive electrolytes with and without space-filling solvent particles, we elucidate the structural and dynamical crossovers and their connection that emerge with increasing salt concentration. Explicit-solvent electrolytes exhibit a screening transition from a charge-dominated dilute regime to a density-dominated concentrated regime, accompanied by dynamical crossovers in ion self-diffusion and ion-pair lifetimes. These dynamical crossovers display a marked discontinuity, unlike the smoother variation of the screening crossover, which originates from short-range ion-counterion structures. Despite the pronounced growth of ionic clusters, their percolation transition does not appear to be directly coupled to the onset of these crossovers. Both structural and dynamical behaviors are found to depend sensitively on ion-solvent coupling: implicit-solvent electrolytes exhibit a screening transition between two charge-dominated regimes, accompanied by qualitatively distinct dynamical behavior. Finally, we demonstrate that the diffusion-corrected ion-pair lifetime provides a consistent descriptor linking ionic structure and dynamics across electrolyte systems.

### Classification of diffusion processes in dimension $d$ via the Carleman approach with applications to models involving additive, multiplicative or square-root noises

- **TL;DR**: Carleman方法应用于多项式随机微分方程，将矩的动力学转化为无限维线性系统，分析不同噪声模型下的谱分解结构

The Carleman approach is well-known in the field of deterministic classical dynamics as a method to replace a finite number $d$ of non-linear differential equations by an infinite-dimensional linear system. Here this approach is applied to a system of $d$ stochastic differential equations for $[x_1(t),..,x_d(t)]$ when the forces and the diffusion-matrix elements are polynomials, in order to write the linear system governing the dynamics of the averaged values ${\mathbb E} ( x_1^{n_1}(t) x_2^{n_2}(t) ... x_d^{n_d}(t) )$ labelled by the $d$ integers $(n_1,..,n_d)$. The natural decomposition of the Carleman matrix into blocks associated to the global degree $n=n_1+n_2+..+n_d$ is useful to identify the models that have the simplest spectral decompositions in the bi-orthogonal basis of right and left eigenvectors. This analysis is then applied to models with a single noise per coordinate, that can be either additive or multiplicative or square-root, or with two types of noises per coordinate, with many examples in dimensions $d=1,2$. In $d=1$, the Carleman matrix governing the dynamics of the moments ${\mathbb E} ( x^{n}(t) )$ is diagonal for the Geometric Brownian motion, while it is lower-triangular for the family of Pearson diffusions containing the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck and the Square-Root processes, as well as the Kesten, the Fisher-Snedecor and the Student processes that converge towards steady states with power-law-tails. In dimension $d=2$, the Carleman matrix governing the dynamics of the correlations ${\mathbb E} ( x_1^{n_1}(t) x_2^{n_2}(t) )$ has a natural decomposition into blocks associated to the global degree $n=n_1+n_2$, and we discuss the simplest models where the Carleman matrix is either block-diagonal or block-lower-triangular or block-upper-triangular.

Foundational Machine Learning Potentials can resolve the accuracy and transferability limitations of classical force fields. They enable microscopic insights into material behavior through Molecular Dynamics simulations, which can crucially expedite material design and discovery. However, insufficiently broad and systematically biased reference data affect the predictive quality of the learned models. Often, these models exhibit significant deviations from experimentally observed phase transition temperatures, in the order of several hundred kelvins. Thus, fine-tuning is necessary to achieve adequate accuracy in many practical problems. This work proposes a fine-tuning strategy via top-down learning, directly correcting the wrongly predicted transition temperatures to match the experimental reference data. Our approach leverages the Differentiable Trajectory Reweighting algorithm to minimize the free energy differences between phases at the experimental target pressures and temperatures. We demonstrate that our approach can accurately correct the phase diagram of pure Titanium in a pressure range of up to 5 GPa, matching the experimental reference within tenths of kelvins and improving the liquid-state diffusion constant. Our approach is model-agnostic, applicable to multi-component systems with solid-solid and solid-liquid transitions, and compliant with top-down training on other experimental properties. Therefore, our approach can serve as an essential step towards highly accurate application-specific and foundational machine learning potentials.

Superconductivity is characterized by vanishing electrical resistance and magnetic flux expulsion. For conventional type II superconductors, the magnetic flux expulsion is incomplete in an applied magnetic field above a critical value and magnetic flux penetrates the bulk of the superconductor in discrete quantized magnetic flux tubes (vortices), each carrying a single quantum of flux (h/2e). Investigating the unconventional superconductor UPt$_{3}$ with a scanning superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) microscope, we observed mobile half-quantum vortices together with one quantum vortices. Cooling the material under a higher magnetic field revealed the presence of lines of magnetic contrast resembling domain walls. These observations agree with theoretical predictions for chiral superconductivity with a two dimensional complex order-parameter with sheets of half-quantum vortices separating domains of opposite order-parameter chirality.

Recent advances in coherent conveyor-mode spin qubit shuttling are paving the way for large-scale quantum computing platforms with qubit connectivity achieved by spin qubit shuttles. We developed a simulation tool to investigate numerically the impact of device imperfections on the spin-coherence of conveyor-mode shuttling in Si/SiGe. We simulate the quantum evolution of a mobile electron spin-qubit under the influence of sparse and singly charged point defects placed in the Si/SiGe heterostructure in close proximity to the shuttle lane. We consider different locations of a single charge defect with respect to the center of the shuttle lane, multiple orbital states of the electron in the shuttle with $g$-factor differences between the orbital levels, and orbital relaxation induced by electron-phonon interaction. With this simulation framework, we identify the critical defect density of charged point defects in the heterostructure for conveyor-mode spin qubit shuttle devices and quantify the impact of a single defect on the coherence of a qubit.

- **TL;DR**: 在超地球地幔特征性的TPa压力下，Fe-Si-O三元系统中发现了三种稳定的金属性三元化合物，这些相的形成改变了铁在高压硅酸盐中的掺入模式。

The Fe-Si-O ternary system, central to modeling the interiors of terrestrial planets, remains poorly constrained at Terapascal (TPa) pressures characteristic of super-Earth mantles. Using a combination of crystal-structure prediction and ab initio calculations, we identify three ternary compounds stable near 1 TPa: P3 FeSiO4, P3 Fe4Si5O18, and P-3 FeSi2O6. The first two phases are thermodynamically stable at low temperatures, whereas P-3 FeSi2O6 becomes favored above approximately 2000 K. All three are metallic, paramagnetic, and adopt pseudo-binary arrangements derived from the FeO2 and SiO2 end-member structures. Their crystal structures emerge through substitutions of Fe for Si in Fe2P-type SiO2 or of Si for Fe in Pnma-type FeO2, the stable elemental oxides at ~1 TPa. This structural continuity suggests that Fe preferentially substitutes for Si in the canonical Mg-silicates expected at TPa pressures. Notably, these new pseudo-binaries accommodate Fe in six- and nine-fold coordination, in contrast to the eight-fold cubic coordination found in FeO at similar pressures. The thermodynamic conditions under which these phases form from FeO2 and SiO2 mixtures are clarified through quasi-harmonic free energy calculations. Their prevalence in super-Earth's mantles is found to depend on the abundance of FeO2, which may be generated by the dehydrogenation of FeOOH goethite as in the Earth's deep mantle. The existence of these phases implies a markedly different pattern of Fe incorporation in high-pressure Mg-silicates at TPa pressures, compared with the behavior inferred at the GPa pressures of the Earth's mantle.

Cold-atom experiments based on alkali-like atoms provide us with a tool to experimentally realize Hubbard models with a large number $N$ of components. The value of $N$ can be seen as a new handle to tune the properties of the system, leading to new physics both in the case of fully SU($N$) symmetric systems, or in the presence of controlled symmetry breaking.
  We focus on the Mott transition at global half filling and we characterize local correlations between particles complementing conventional estimates with the inter-flavor mutual information. We prove that these correlations have classical nature and, using Dynamical Mean-Field Theory, we show that the SU(4) system has significantly smaller correlations than the SU(2) counterpart. In the atomic limit we prove that increasing $N$ further decreases the strength of the correlations. This suggests that a controlled reduction of the symmetry, reducing the number of effective components, can be used to enhance the degree of correlation.
  We confirm this scenario solving the model for $N=4$ and gradually breaking the symmetry via a Raman field, revealing an evolution from the SU(4) to the SU(2) Mott transition as the symmetry-breaking term increases, with a sudden recovery of the large correlations of the SU(2) model at weak Raman coupling in the Mott state. By further exploring the interplay between energy repulsion and the Raman field, we obtain a rich phase diagram with three different phases -- a metal, a band insulator, and a Mott insulator -- all coexisting at a single tricritical point.

This study presents a closed-loop biorefinery strategy that thermochemically upcycles fermentation residues (FRs) from photo-fermentative biohydrogen production (PFHP) into functional biochar catalysts, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the initial PFHP process. Four FRs derived from hydrothermal and ethylene glycol-pretreated corn stover were pyrolyzed at 700°C. Multi-model kinetic analyses revealed diffusion-controlled mechanisms with activation energies ranging from 157 to 278 kJ/mol, while thermodynamic profiling highlighted the influence of feedstock composition on reaction spontaneity and entropy. Pyrolysis effectively restored porosity compromised during fermentation, yielding biochar with tailored properties: microporous BC3 (185 m2/g) from oxygen-rich precursors and mesoporous BC4 (76.58 m2/g) from graphitized residues. When reintroduced into PFHP, BC3 maximized cumulative hydrogen yield (570 mL) via pH buffering, and BC4 achieved the highest production rate (14.91 mL/h) through electron shuttle mechanisms. The integrated process concurrently generated syngas, bio-oil, and catalytic biochar, enabling waste valorization, renewable energy output, and process enhancement within a circular bioeconomy framework.

Trail interactions occur when past particle trajectories bias future motion, rendering the system out of thermodynamic equilibrium. While such systems are abundant in nature, their understanding is limited to the single-particle level or phenomenological mean-field theories. Here, we introduce a minimal model of many trail-interacting particles that extends this paradigm to the fluctuating collective level. Particles diffuse while depositing long-lasting repelling/attracting trails that act as a shared memory field, coupling their dynamics across time and space. Using stochastic density functional theory, we derive fluctuating hydrodynamic equations and analyze analytically and numerically the resulting behaviors. We show that memory, coupled with fluctuations, fundamentally reshapes collective dynamics; In the repulsive case, the particle density displays superdiffusive spreading characterized by transient clustering and ballistic motion; In the attractive case, the system condensates in finite time into frozen, localized states. Our results establish general principles for trail-interacting systems and reveal how persistent fields generate novel instabilities and self-organization.

- **TL;DR**: 使用深度学习（特别是U-Net架构）解决铜氧化物超导体模型哈密顿量的逆问题，从相图预测模型参数，验证了机器学习在凝聚态物理复杂模型分析中的应用潜力。

The computational complexity of calculating phase diagrams for multi-parameter models significantly limits the ability to select parameters that correspond to experimental data. This work presents a machine learning method for solving the inverse problem - forecasting the parameters of a model Hamiltonian for a cuprate superconductor based on its phase diagram. A comparative study of three deep learning architectures was conducted: VGG, ResNet, and U-Net. The latter was adapted for regression tasks and demonstrated the best performance. Training the U-Net model was performed on an extensive dataset of phase diagrams calculated within the mean-field approximation, followed by validation on data obtained using a semi-classical heat bath algorithm for Monte Carlo simulations. It is shown that the model accurately predicts all considered Hamiltonian parameters, and areas of low prediction accuracy correspond to regions of parametric insensitivity in the phase diagrams. This allows for the extraction of physically interpretable patterns and validation of the significance of parameters for the system. The results confirm the promising potential of applying machine learning to analyze complex physical models in condensed matter physics.

- **TL;DR**: 实验展示了通过调控量子几何在扭曲MoTe2中实现分数量子反常霍尔态与拓扑电子晶体态之间的相变

The quantum geometry of Bloch wavefunctions,encoded in the Berry curvature and quantum metric, is believed to be a decisive ingredient in stabilizing fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) effect(i.e., fractional Chern insulator, FCI, at zero magnetic field), against competing symmetry-breaking phases.A direct experimental demonstration of quantum geometry-driven switching between distinct correlated topological phases, however, has been lacking. Here, we report experimental evidence of such a switch in a high-quality 3.7 twisted MoTe2 (tMoTe2) device consisting of both A-A bilayer and A-AB trilayer regions. While composite Fermi liquid CFL/FQAH phases are established in A-A tMoTe2,the A-AB region-effectively an A-A moire bilayer proximitized by a remote B layer-develops a series of topological electronic crystal (TEC, also referred to as generalized QAH crystal, QAHC) states with integer quantized Hall conductance at commensurate fractional fillings v=1/2, 2/3, and an incommensurate filling factor v=0.53.The electrostatic phase diagram is mapped out by combined transport and optical measurements, showing that these TEC states emerge within the first moir'e valence band prior to any charge transfer to the B layer. Exact diagonalization (ED) incorporating the remote-layer-induced intralayer potential demonstrates a transition from a CFL-like manifold in the A-A limit to a Chern number C=1 ground-state consistent with a TEC at v=1/2 , accompanied by the further breakdown of ideal band geometry. Our results provide experimental evidence of quantum geometry-tuned competition between FQAH/CFL and TEC phases in a moiré Chern band and pave the way for further exploring correlation-driven topological phenomena by tuning quantum geometry.

Stemming from antiferromagnetic coupling, exchange bias allows inverted hysteresis in a magnetic system. Such room temperature magnetic reversal has yet to be observed in an amorphous antiferromagnet. Furthermore, the impact of this exchange bias effect on its magnetoelectric transport behavior remains a mystery. Here we discovered a zero-field magnetization switching effect in an exchange-biased amorphous antiferromagnet with inverted magnetic hysteresis. This zero-field magnetic reversal was further evidenced by its inverted large anomalous Hall effect. Notably, this collective spin flipping at zero field can occur at room temperature or above room temperature, which may be associated with quantum interference effect due to thermal fluctuation enhanced disorder. Our experimental results offer a way to design room-temperature exchange-biased amorphous antiferromagnets with zero-field multi magnetic-states and large anomalous Hall effect, holding potential for low-power and high-density memory applications.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文提出了一种新方法来诊断量子蒙特卡罗中的符号问题，通过分析符号分辨的测量统计来理解忽略符号如何导致测量偏差，特别是在掺杂哈伯德模型中d波配对敏感性的原因。

Quantum simulations are a powerful tool for exploring strongly correlated many-body phenomena. Yet, their reach is limited by the fermion sign problem, which causes configuration weights to become negative, compromising statistical sampling. In auxiliary-field Quantum Monte Carlo calculations of the doped Hubbard model, neglecting the sign ${\cal S}$ of the weight leads to qualitatively wrong results -- most notably, an apparent suppression rather than enhancement of $d$-wave pairing at low temperature. Here we approach the problem from a different perspective: instead of identifying negative-weight paths, we examine the statistics of measured observables in a sign-resolved manner. By analyzing histograms of key quantities (kinetic energy, antiferromagnetic structure factor, and pair susceptibilities) for configurations with ${\cal S}=\pm1$, we derive an exact relation linking the bias from ignoring the sign to the difference between sign-resolved means, $Δμ$, and the average sign, $\langle {\cal S}\rangle$. Our framework provides a precise diagnostic of the origin of measurement bias in Quantum Monte Carlo and clarifies why observables such as the $d$-wave susceptibility are especially sensitive to the sign problem.

### Real-Time Coupled Electron-Nuclear Dynamics of Chemical Bond Formation: Hydrogen Scattering from a Semiconductor Surface

A first-principles coupled electron-nuclear dynamics simulation based on real-time, time-dependent density functional theory and Ehrenfest dynamics quantitatively repro-duces bimodal translational energy loss and angular distributions observed in experiment for hydrogen atom scattering from Ge(111)-c(2*8). The theory elucidates a site-selective mechanism of electronically nonadiabatic energy transfer associated with the formation of different Ge-H bonds. When a hydrogen atom approaches a Ge rest-atom, it is strongly accelerated toward the potential minimum forming a transient Ge-H bond and then re-flected by the repulsive wall. This transient bond formation triggers an ultrafast electron transfer event from the rest-atom to an adjacent Ge-adatom, involving several crossings between valence and conduction bands of the substrate. Electronic equilibration is impos-sible within such a short time (Born-Oppenheimer failure) allowing the H-atom kinetic energy to be converted to inter-band electronic excitation of the substrate. H-atom colli-sions at other Ge atoms also form a transient bond but exhibit no electronic excitation, resulting in distinctly less efficient energy loss in scattered H-atoms. The nucle-ar-to-electronic energy transfer observed in this system reflects the electronic dynamics of covalent bond formation at a semiconductor surface, a mechanism that is quite distinct from previously identified nonadiabatic energy transfer mechanisms at metal surfaces mediated by electronic friction or transient negative ions.

- **TL;DR**: RefrActor是一个端到端的深度学习框架，可直接从HKL数据自动确定晶体结构，无需初始结构猜测或人工干预，实现了晶体结构测定的自动化。

Single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SC-XRD) is the gold standard technique to characterize crystal structures in solid state. Despite significant advances in automation for structure solution, the refinement stage still depends heavily on expert intervention and subjective judgment, limiting accessibility and scalability. Herein, we introduce RefrActor, an end-to-end deep learning framework that enables crystal structure determination directly from HKL data. By coupling a physics-informed reciprocal-space encoder (ReciEncoder) with a symmetry-aware diffusion-based generator (StruDiffuser), RefrActor produces fully refined atomic models without requiring initial structural guesses or manual input. Comprehensive evaluations on the GenRef-10k benchmark demonstrates that RefrActor achieves low R1-factors across diverse systems, including low-symmetry, light-atom, and heavy-atom crystals. Case studies further confirm that RefrActor can correctly resolve hydrogen positions, elemental assignments, and moderate disorder. This work establishes a new data-driven paradigm for autonomous crystallographic analysis, offering a foundation for fully automated, high-throughput crystal structure determination.

In recent years, the concept of multipoles has been widely used to describe and classify various magnetic and electric responses in solids, providing a systematic way to identify symmetry-allowed or -forbidden physical responses. Conventionally, multipole classifications rely on the magnetic point group of a system, which inherently incorporates the effects of relativistic spin-orbit coupling because the spin orientation is supposed to follow the point-group transformation of the lattice. However, this approach becomes insufficient in situations where relativistic spin-orbit coupling is negligibly weak or where the spin and orbital (lattice) degrees of freedom are decoupled, thereby requiring a more comprehensive symmetry description. In this work, we introduce a multipole description on the basis of spin-point-group symmetries, enabling a systematic exploration of nonrelativistic phenomena that persist even without spin-orbit coupling in a collinear antiferromagnet. As an application, we theoretically demonstrate spin-current generation driven by elastic waves in a specific collinear antiferromagnet, fully independent of spin-orbit coupling.

The utilization of two-dimensional (2D) materials in magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) has shown excellent performance and rich physics. As for 2D antiferromagnets, the magnetic moments in different layers respond asynchronously and can be configured at various states under different magnetic fields, showing the possibility of efficient magnetic and electrical tunability. In this report, A-type antiferromagnetic (AFM) material (Fe0.5Co0.5)5GeTe2 (FCGT) works as electrodes to realize full van der Waals magnetic tunnel junctions. Owing to the interfacial effect, the even-layer FCGT, although with zero net magnetization, exhibits spin selectivity in MTJ architecture contributing to a tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) reaching about 25% at a low operating current 1 nA at 100 K and persists near room temperature. Due to the surface spin-flop (SSF) effect in antiferromagnetic FCGT, the alternation flexibility between the volatile and nonvolatile memory behavior is achieved. The interfacial TMR can be tuned efficiently in amplitude and even sign under different bias currents and temperatures. These findings show precise magnetoelectric manipulation in MTJs based on 2D antiferromagnets and highlight the promise of 2D antiferromagnets for spintronic devices.

The use of differential phase contrast (DPC) in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) has shown much promise for directly investigating the functional properties of a material system, leveraging the natural coupling between the electron probe and atomic-scale electric fields to map the electrostatic configuration within a sample. However, the high sensitivity of these measurements makes them particularly vulnerable to variations in both sample properties and the configuration of the instrument, stressing the need for robust methodologies to ensure more accurate analyses. In this work, the influence of key instrumental parameters - probe convergence angle, defocus and two-fold astigmatism - on atomic-resolution segmented-detector DPC-STEM measurements is evaluated through extensive image simulations. Results show that the limit of interpretability for a 21 mrad defocused probe is found at a magnitude of 4 nm, where electrostatic field magnitude can be underestimated by about 16 % in overfocus and just above 10 % in underfocus. Equivalent results for a 30 mrad probe demonstrate underestimated values around 30 % at overfocus and 20 % for underfocus, at a lower interpretability limit of 3 nm. Two-fold astigmatism introduces orientation dependent variations that surpass 40 % for magnitudes below 3 nm, but a reduction in sensitivity to the aberration is observed when oriented along detector-segment edges. Overall, the analysis confirms the sensitivity and usefulness of the scattergram-based method and underscores the importance of optimized instrumental alignment for accurate CoM based STEM imaging.

While liquid crystals (LCs) have been extensively studied, obtaining a comprehensive nanoscale picture of their molecular organization remains challenging, as conventional techniques face an intrinsic trade-off between spatial and chemical resolution. Here, cryogenic atom probe tomography (cryo-APT) is introduced as a new analytical approach for LC materials, using 4'-Pentyl-4-cyanobiphenyl (5CB) and 4'-Octyl-4-cyanobiphenyl (8CB) as representative model compounds. This was enabled by a tailored cryogenic focused ion beam (cryo-FIB) protocol optimized for small organic molecules. The method enables controlled field evaporation of both intact molecules and diagnostic fragments, achieving over 90% molecular retention while preserving four characteristic dissociation patterns. By spatially correlating these fragmentation profiles with the local electric field derived from the tip geometry, we reveal field-directed dissociation pathways of CB molecules. In parallel, the distribution of intact molecular ions enables nanoscale visualization of material structure: we resolve homogeneous mixing of 5CB and 8CB in the nematic phase and directly observe the sub-nanometer crystalline layering in a supercooled 8CB sample, with contrast to the surrounding amorphous matrix suggesting the presence of a solid-liquid interface. This work establishes cryo-APT as a new powerful analytical platform for LC research and reveals its broad potential for application in soft matter systems.

Nonlinear and nonreciprocal transport phenomena provide a direct probe of band quantum geometry in noncentrosymmetric magnetic materials, such as the nonlinear Hall effect induced by the quantum metric dipole. In altermagnets, a recently discovered class of even-parity collinear magnets with $C_n\mathcal{T}$ symmetry, conventional second-order responses are prohibited by an emergent $C_{2z}$ symmetry. In this work, we demonstrate that an in-plane magnetic field lifts this prohibition, inducing a planar magnetotransport that directly probes the intrinsic quantum geometry and the distinctive $C_n\mathcal{T}$ nature of altermagnetic orders. We show that the field-dependent quantum geometric susceptibility generates versatile planar magnetotransport, including the planar Hall effects and nonreciprocal responses. Our work establishes distinctive signatures of altermagnetism in linear and nonlinear magnetotransport, providing a general framework for measuring quantum geometric responses and probing altermagnetic order.

The Fe-O system is fundamental to understanding the composition and properties of the Earth's core. Recent studies have suggested the possible existence of stable, iron-rich FenO compounds at around 215 GPa. Here, we performed crystal-structure searches and fully anharmonic free-energy calculations to investigate the Fe-FeO system under inner-core conditions. We identified Fe2O as a stable phase and constructed its high P-T phase diagram. Fe2O undergoes a hexagonal-to-tetragonal transition with increasing pressure and temperature. It remains thermodynamically stable against decomposition into Fe and FeO from 200 to 400 GPa and at high temperatures. Although oxygen has been considered nearly absent in the inner core due to its limited solubility, these results suggest that oxygen can, in fact, be incorporated into the solid inner core in the form of an Fe+Fe2O mixture, and can match PREM densities for 53 mol% Fe2O. Our work has the potential to lead to a significant revision of the current understanding of the core's structure and composition.

- **TL;DR**: 研究石墨烯中电子在双磁势垒和中间激光驱动区域构成的混合系统中的输运特性，发现激光区域作为Floquet腔体开启新的光子辅助输运通道，产生Fano共振和角度依赖的传输零点。

We study how electrons move across a graphene sheet when it encounters two magnetic barriers with a region in between that is continuously driven by laser light. Rather than acting as a static obstacle, this illuminated middle section becomes a Floquet cavity that opens new transport channels through controlled photon absorption and emission. By combining Floquet theory with the transfer matrix method, we track electron transmission through both the main energy band and the emerging photon-assisted sidebands. We find that the laser does more than modify the potential--it reshapes how electrons interact between the magnetic barriers, enabling a switch from ordinary transmission to transport dominated by photon exchange. Because the magnetic field and the optical drive are applied to separate sections of the device, the system supports interference between cyclotron-filtered motion and discrete photon-pumping channels, producing Fano resonances and angle-dependent transmission zeros that cannot appear in double magnetic or double laser barrier systems alone. Under well-defined conditions, the distance between the magnetic barriers controls the coupling between Floquet channels, allowing highly tunable resonances and even perfect transmission, despite strong magnetic confinement. We also observe that low-energy carriers are efficiently blocked by the magnetic regions, while conductance steadily rises with energy until it reaches a clear saturation plateau. This hybrid design provides a versatile way to steer graphene electrons by balancing optical pumping and magnetic momentum filtering.

Achieving efficient n-type doping in AlN, a representative ultrawide bandgap (UWBG) semiconductor, remains a longstanding challenge that limits its application in high-power electronics and deep-ultraviolet optoelectronics. Conventional dopants in AlN often introduce deep levels or form compensating complexes, leading to low free-carrier concentrations. In this work, we combine first-principles defect calculations with a structural search method tailored to explore metastable configurations to systematically investigate donor-type defects in AlN. Our results reveal that the aluminum interstitial ($Al_i$) can exhibit shallow-donor behavior in specific metastable configurations that were previously overlooked. This discovery expands the understanding of n-type dopability in AlN, and highlights the critical role of metastable defects in modulating electronic properties.

Two-component fractional quantum Hall (2C-FQH) states in electron bilayers have been known for decades, yet their experimental realization remained limited to low-order fractions. Here we report on several families of high-order 2C-FQH states that emerge when an in-plane magnetic field drives a controlled monolayer-to-bilayer transition in an ultra-high-mobility GaAs quantum well. These families of states proliferate symmetrically toward the filling factor $ν= 1$, from both $ν= 2/3$ and $ν= 4/3$, thereby respecting particle-hole symmetry. Surprisingly, many unbalanced states (with unequal layer fillings) are more robust than their parent balanced states, defying the expected hierarchy of Jain sequences. Our findings substantially expand the known landscape of 2C-FQH states, highlighting the unexpected richness of the bilayer quantum Hall regime and opening new routes for probing the interplay of symmetry, topology, and interactions in quantum Hall systems.

The ideal altermagnets are a class of collinear, crystal-symmetry-enforced fully compensated magnets with nonrelativistic spin-split bands, in which contributions from Berry curvature to magneto-optical effects (MOEs) are strictly forbidden by an effective time-reversal symmetry. Here we show that, in such systems, MOEs are exclusively induced by the quantum metric and, in realistic altermagnets, are typically dominated by it. We refer to Berry-curvature-induced MOEs as conventional MOEs and to quantum-metric-dominated MOEs as unconventional MOEs. We derive general formulas that incorporate both Berry curvature and quantum metric for unconventional MOEs in altermagnets, enabling a quantitative evaluation of their respective contributions. Through symmetry analysis, we prove that ideal altermagnets are constrained to exhibit only unconventional MOEs. Using the three-dimensional canonical altermagnet MnTe and the emerging two-dimensional bilayer twisted altermagnet CrSBr as illustrative examples, we demonstrate that unconventional MOEs are prevalent in altermagnets. Our results establish altermagnets as a natural platform for quantum-metric-driven optical phenomena, substantially broadening the scope of MOEs and providing concrete predictions that can be tested in future experimental studies.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究展示了在层状反铁磁体CrPS₄中通过层内交换耦合实现界面控制，利用NV磁力显微镜可视化AFM-FM界面，实现了可调谐的多级交换偏置。

Interfacial exchange coupling between antiferromagnets (AFMs) and ferromagnets (FMs) crucially makes it possible to shift the FM hysteresis, known as exchange bias, and to switch AFM states. Two-dimensional magnets unlock opportunities to combine AFM and FM materials; however, the buried AFM-FM interfaces obtained by stacking remains challenging to understand. Here we demonstrate interfacial control via intralayer exchange coupling in the layered AFM CrPS$_4$, where connected even and odd layers realize pristine lateral interfaces between AFM-like and FM-like regions. We distinguish antiphase even-layer states by scanning nitrogen-vacancy centre (NV) magnetometry due to a weak surface magnetization. This surface magnetization enables control over the even-layer state, with different regions switching at distinct fields due to their own lateral couplings. We toggle three AFM domains adjacent to a FM-like region and demonstrate a tunable multilevel exchange bias. Our nanoscale visualization unveils the microscopic origins of exchange bias and advances single two-dimensional crystals for hybrid AFM-FM technologies.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究通过第一性原理计算和玻尔兹曼方程，分析了层状Zintl化合物XZnBi（X=Rb, Cs）的堆叠顺序对热电性能的影响，发现这些材料具有优异的热电潜力，在900K时最大ZT值可达2.42。

Layered Zintl compounds exhibit significant tunability of thermoelectric (TE) parameters facilitated by their multiple elemental combinations and flexibility in stacking order within the layers. In this work, the effect of stacking order on TE properties of theoretically predicted layered Zintl compounds XZnBi (X = Rb, Cs) is studied using 1st-principles calculations and Boltzmann equations. The materials are semiconductors having moderate band gaps ranging from 0.44 to 0.52 eV. There exist six identical hole pockets for valence band maxima due to the crystal symmetry. This leads to high band degeneracy but simultaneously promotes intervalley scatterings. While as for conduction bands, the Fermi surface consists of a single but highly anisotropic, quasi-two dimensional electron pockets with cylindrical shape along z-axis. This kind of Fermi surface is a characteristic of a pudding mold band shape. It facilitates a unique combination of heavy and light electron masses, simultaneously optimizing Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity. At first, electronic transport coefficients are calculated using constant relaxation time approximation (CRTA) or electron-phonon coupling matrix elements (el-ph). The calculated relaxation times are then integrated with transport results to get the realistic values of TE parameters. The analysis of three-phonon scattering reveals low thermal conductivity ($k_{l}$) below 2 W/m/K in these compounds. The $k_{l}$ also depends on stacking order with the values of nearly half in AB stacking as compared to that of AA stacking. These combined factors lead to a high ZT at 900 K, reaching to a maximum of 2.42 using CRTA and 0.52 when el-ph are included. The study highlights the potential of XZnBi systems as promising TE materials as well as the critical roles of stacking and el-ph in accurately evaluating TE properties.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文利用高达55T的强磁场磁输运测量，在MnBi2Te4纳米结构中观测到Shubnikov-de-Haas振荡，证实了拓扑表面态的二维特性，为磁性拓扑绝缘体研究提供了除光电子能谱外的替代方法。

Magnetic topological insulators can host chiral 1D edge channels at zero magnetic field, when a magnetic gap opens at the Dirac point in the band structure of 2D topological surface states, lead- ing to the quantum anomalous Hall effect in ultra-thin nanostructures. For thicker nanostructures, quantization is severely reduced by the co-existence of edge states with other quasi-particles, usually considered as bulk states. Yet, surface states also exist above the magnetic gap, but it remains difficult to identify electronic subbands by electrical measurements due to strong disorder. Here we unveil surface states in MnBi2Te4 nanostructures, using magneto-transport in very-high magnetic fields up to 55 T, giving evidence of Shubnikov-de-Haas oscillations above 40 T. A detailed analysis confirms the 2D nature of these quantum oscillations, thus establishing an alternative method to photoemission spectroscopy for the study of topological surface states in magnetic topological insulators, using Landau level spectroscopy.

The structural and magnetic properties of the two-dimensional spin-$1/2$ depleted-kagome compound Cu$_7$(TeO$_3$)$_2$(SO$_4$)$_2$(OH)$_6$ are investigated using x-ray diffraction, magnetization, heat capacity, and $^1$H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) measurements. From the analysis of magnetic susceptibility, we found a large Curie-Weiss temperature [$θ_{\rm CW} = -50(2)$ K] and the co-existence of antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic interactions. The value of $θ_{\rm CW}$ gives an estimate of the average nearest-neighbour antiferromagnetic interaction of $J/k_{\rm B} \simeq 66$ K. The NMR relaxation rates ($1/T_1$ and $1/T_2$) exhibit a peak, providing evidence for a magnetic long-range order at $T^*\simeq 4$ K which appears to be canted antiferromagnetic type. Heat capacity also features a broad maximum at $T^*$ that moves towards higher temperatures with increasing magnetic field, reflecting defect induced Schottky anomaly. The frustration parameter $f_r = \lvert θ_{\rm CW} \lvert/{T^{*}}\simeq 12.5$ renders the compound a highly frustrated low-dimensional magnet.

### High Pressure and Compositionally Directed Route to a Hexagonal GeSn Alloy Class

- **TL;DR**: 通过高压高温方法成功制备了环境压力下稳定的六方结构Ge-Sn固溶体，突破了传统Ge和Sn在常温下不反应且Sn无六方对称性的限制，为光电应用开辟了新途径。

Despite their electronic dominance, cubic diamond structured Si and Ge, are optoelectronically deficient. Recent work indicates, however, that a volume-expanded hexagonal Ge modification can exhibit intensely sought, superior optoelectronic characteristics. If larger Sn could form a hexagonal solid solution with Ge, this would achieve this expansion. But this was not expected because Ge and Sn are unreactive at ambient conditions, Sn does not have an ambient hexagonal symmetry, and only cubic or tetragonal binary modifications could be prepared under any conditions including thin film processing. This state of affairs is categorically changed here by subjecting Ge and Sn to pressures of 9 and 10 GPa and temperatures up to 1500 K using large-volume press methods. Synchrotron angle-dispersive X-ray diffraction, precession electron diffraction and chemical analysis using electron microscopy reveal ambient pressure recovery of hexagonal 2H, 4H and 6H Ge-Sn solid solutions (P63/mmc). Formation of this new binary materials landscape is correlated with Sn uptake, with the hexagonal symmetry being accessible below 21 atom % Sn and the cubic diamond symmetry at or above this value. The findings form fertile routes to advanced materials, by in tandem creating reactivity with pressure and directing production of needed crystal symmetries with composition, as well as opportunity to tune properties based on crystal symmetry, composition, and stacking sequence for optoelectronic applications.

- **TL;DR**: 本文评估了五种机器学习原子间势（MLIPs）在预测电池材料离子迁移势垒（Em）方面的准确性和实用性，发现MACE-MP-0和Orb-v3表现最佳，可用于高通量筛选和加速DFT计算。

Fast, and accurate prediction of ionic migration barriers ($E_m$) is crucial for designing next-generation battery materials that combine high energy density with facile ion transport. Given the computational costs associated with estimating $E_m$ using conventional density functional theory (DFT) based nudged elastic band (NEB) calculations, we benchmark the accuracy in $E_m$ and geometry predictions of five foundational machine learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs), which can potentially accelerate predictions of ionic transport. Specifically, we assess the accuracy of MACE-MP-0, Orb-v3, SevenNet, CHGNet, and M3GNet models, coupled with the NEB framework, against DFT-NEB-calculated $E_m$ across a diverse set of battery-relevant chemistries and structures. Notably, MACE-MP-0 and Orb-v3 exhibit the lowest mean absolute errors in $E_m$ predictions across the entire dataset and over data points that are not outliers, respectively. Importantly, Orb-v3 and SevenNet classify `good' versus `bad' ionic conductors with an accuracy of $&gt;$82\%, based on a threshold $E_m$ of 500~meV, indicating their utility in high-throughput screening approaches. Notably, intermediate images generated by MACE-MP-0 and SevenNet provide better initial guesses relative to conventional interpolation techniques in $&gt;$71\% of structures, offering a practical route to accelerate subsequent DFT-NEB relaxations. Finally, we observe that accurate $E_m$ predictions by MLIPs are not correlated with accurate (local) geometry predictions. Our work establishes the use-cases, accuracies, and limitations of foundational MLIPs in estimating $E_m$ and should serve as a base for accelerating the discovery of novel ionic conductors for batteries and beyond.

- **TL;DR**: 研究通过DMSO溶解真黑素薄膜改善其光电性能，将光伏电池效率从0.023%提升至4.4%，揭示了有机层形态对异质结光生载流子的关键影响。

This work studies photosensitivity and current-voltage characteristics under illumination of water-soluble eumelanin films based on DHICA tetramers and hybrid eumelanin/porous Si photovoltaic cells aimed at optimizing their characteristics. By using DMSO to dissolve melanin containing protonated carboxyl groups and to remove ammonium cations, it became possible to significantly reduce the ionic component of conductivity, thus improved the electron transport. It was found out that dissolution in DMSO provides a denser π-π stacking of DHICA tetramers, which led to a significant improvement in the photovoltaic cell parameters. In particular, the efficiency increased from 0.023 % to 4.4 % and the series resistance decreased from 119 Ω to 42.6 Ω. Modeling demonstrated that high-temperature annealing, which causes decarboxylation, leads to a structural rearrangement of tetramers from a Christmas tree-like configuration to a "toothed helix". At this, one of the planes partially straightens. This emphasizes the critical importance of the morphology of the organic layer for photogeneration of carriers in a heterojunction.

### Tuning spin currents in collinear antiferromagnets and altermagnets

Spin current generation through non-relativistic spin splittings, found in uncompensated magnets and d-wave altermagnets, is desirable for low-power spintronics. Such spin currents, however, are symmetry forbidden in conventional collinear antiferromagnets and higher-order altermagnets. Using spin point group analysis, we demonstrate that finite spin currents can be induced in these materials via magnetoelectric, piezomagnetic, and piezomagnetoelectric-like couplings. We utilize electric fields, strain, and their combinations to drive symmetry-lowering phase transitions into uncompensated magnetic or d-wave altermagnetic states, thereby enabling finite spin conductivity in a broader class of magnetic materials. We further substantiate this framework using density functional theory and Boltzmann transport calculations on representative magnetic materials - KV2Se2O, RuF4 , Cr2O3 , FeS2 , and MnPSe3 - spanning these different cases. The charge-to-spin conversion ratio reaches up to almost 100% via uncompensated magnetism and about 40% via d-wave altermagnetism under realistic conditions, highlighting the effectiveness of this approach for efficient spin current generation.

We investigate the out-of-equilibrium lattice dynamics in the spin-ladder system $α'$-NaV$_2$O$_5$ using intense terahertz (THz) pump and near-infrared (NIR) probe spectroscopy. When quasi-single-cycle THz pulses interact with $α'$-NaV$_2$O$_5$ in its low-temperature, dimerized charge-ordered phase, they induce coherent oscillations in the time domain at the zone-folded Raman-active phonon frequency of 1.85 THz. By combining pump-probe measurements with lattice dynamics modeling based on equation-of-motion approach, we propose that these oscillations arise from a nonlinear coupling between Raman-active and infrared (IR)-active phonon modes, with the latter being resonantly excited by the THz pulses. In contrast, excitation with NIR femtosecond laser pulses does not produce measurable vibrational dynamics, highlighting the unique potential of THz-driven, nonlinear light-matter interactions for the coherent and selective control of structural dynamics in quantum materials.

- **TL;DR**: 研究硼空位缺陷在六方氮化硼中的荧光淬灭机制，发现当hBN传感层厚度超过3nm时，与石墨烯或二维半导体的非辐射福斯特共振能量转移可忽略不计。

Boron vacancies ($V_B^-$) in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have emerged as a promising platform for two-dimensional quantum sensors capable of operating at atomic-scale proximity. However, the mechanisms responsible for photoluminescence quenching in thin hBN sensing layers when placed in contact with absorptive materials remain largely unexplored. In this Letter, we investigate non-radiative Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between $V_B^-$ centers and either monolayer graphene or 2D semiconductors. Strikingly, we find that the FRET rate is negligible for hBN sensing layers thicker than 3 nm, highlighting the potential of $V_B^-$ centers for integration into ultra-thin quantum sensors within van der Waals heterostructures. Furthermore, we experimentally extract the intrinsic radiative decay rate of $V_B^-$ defects.

This work presents a detailed investigation of the discharge behavior of spherical granular materials through a conical--cylindrical hopper using \emph{Discrete Element Method (DEM)} simulations. The aim is to assess the applicability limits of the empirical \emph{Beverloo law}. The system was modeled with a monodisperse particles whose mechanical properties correspond to the $Al_{95}Fe_2Cr_2Ti_1$ alloy, and interparticle contacts were described using the Hertz--Mindlin (no slip) model. The simulations systematically explored the influence of particle diameter ($d$) and bed height ($h$) on the resulting mass flow rate ($Q$).
  The results reveal the coexistence of transient and steady-state discharge regimes. Good agreement with the Beverloo scaling was observed for relatively small diameter ratios ($D/d = 10$) and sufficiently large bed heights, where the flow stabilizes rapidly. For larger $D/d$ ratios, the discharge rate decays exponentially, indicating a breakdown of the constant-hydrostatic-pressure assumption underlying the Beverloo model. A dimensionless criterion for the validity of the Beverloo law is proposed as $Π_h = h/D &gt; 2$, or equivalently $N = h/d &gt; 20$. The quantitative agreement between DEM simulations and experimental measurements for polydisperse particle size distributions further validates the computational model and demonstrates its predictive capability for granular discharge in confined geometries.

Research on diamond has intensified due to its exceptional thermal, optical, and mechanical properties, making it a key material in quantum technologies and high-power applications. Diamonds with engineered nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers represent a very sensitive platform for quantum sensing, while high-optical quality diamond windows represent a fundamental safety component inside Electron Cyclotron Resonance Heating (ECRH) systems in nuclear fusion reactors. A major challenge is the development of ultra-low-loss, high-optical-quality single-crystal diamond substrates to meet growing demands for quantum coherence and power handling. Traditionally, dielectric losses ($\tan δ$) in diamonds are evaluated using Fabry-Perot microwave resonators, in which the resonance quality factors Q of the cavity with and without the sample are compared. These devices are limited to resolutions around 10$^{-5}$ by the need to keep the resonator dimensions within a reasonable range. In contrast, superconducting thin-film micro-strip resonators, with Q factors exceeding 10$^6$, are stated to provide higher sensitivity for assessing ultra-low-loss materials. This study examines four diamond samples grown through different processes, analyzing their dielectric losses at extreme low temperatures (sub-Kelvin) within the Two-Level System (TLS) framework. Complementary Raman spectroscopy measurements allowed us not only to associate higher nitrogen content with increased losses, but also to investigate how the different growth process influence the way these defects are incorporated in the crystal lattice.

Transition metal oxides exhibit a wide range of tunable electronic properties arising from the complex interplay of charge, spin, and lattice degrees of freedom, governed by their $d$ orbital configurations, making them particularly interesting for oxide electronics and (electro)catalysis. Perovskite oxide heterointerfaces offer a promising route to engineer these orbital states. In this work, we tune the Co $3d$ orbital occupancy in LaCoO$_3$ from a partial $d^7$ to a partial $d^5$ state through interfacial engineering with LaTiO$_3$, LaMnO$_3$, LaAlO$_3$ and LaNiO$_3$. Using X-ray absorption spectroscopy combined with charge transfer multiplet calculations, we identify differences in the Co valence and spin state for the series of oxide heterostructures. LaTiO$_3$ and LaMnO$_3$ interfaces result in interfacial charge transfer towards LaCoO$_3$, resulting in a partial $d^7$ orbital occupancy, while a LaNiO$_3$ interface results in a partial Co $d^5$ occupancy. Strikingly, a LaAlO$_3$ spacer layer between LaNiO$_3$ and LaCoO$_3$ results in a Co $d^6$ low spin state. These results indicate that the Co spin state, like the valence state, is governed by the interfacial environment. High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy imaging reveals a clear connection between strain and spin configuration, emphasizing the importance of structural control at oxide interfaces. Overall, this work demonstrates that interfacial engineering simultaneously governs orbital occupancy and spin state in correlated oxides, advancing spin-engineering strategies in correlated oxides and offering new insights for the rational design of functional oxide heterostructures.

We report a temperature-composition phase diagram for the chemically disordered and CeO2-LA2O3 high entropy oxides (HEOs), where LA denotes equimolar Y, La, Sm, and Pr, delineating stability regions for bixbyite, disordered fluorite, and intermediate vacancy-ordered fluorite phases. The diagram is constructed from a characterization package applied to bulk ceramics including X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) electron diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, energy-dispersive spectroscopy, X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy, and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, to quantify crystal structure at multiple length-scales, local coordination environments, and electronic structures across the formulation space. This comprehensive measurement suite is critical to identify boundaries between the closely related phases. For example, Raman scattering reveals local structural and defect environments unique to bixbyite local order that persist to ~50% Ce under equilibrium synthesis conditions but are invisible to XRD and TEM. We also report a companion thin film study to demonstrate that quenched kinetic energy from a physical deposition process can metastabilize the high symmetry, and thus high entropy, fluorite phase with only 20% Ce. This is noteworthy because electroneutrality constraints demand an exceptionally vacated oxygen sublattice; we estimate 16.7%, approaching that of delta-Bi2O3. Together, our equilibrium ceramics and far-from-equilibrium thin films show that when synthesis is coupled with rigorously chosen, multi-length-scale characterization, now one can identify the phase stability thermodynamic drivers and simultaneously derive practical guidelines for experimentally realizing targeted phases and structures - and thereby deliberately engineer properties in CeO2-LA2O3 HEOs, whose broad defect chemistries demand such an approach.

A topological interlocking assembly is an arrangement of blocks, where all blocks are kinematically constrained by their neighboring blocks and a fixed frame. This concept has been known for a long time, attracting recent interest due to its advantageous mechanical properties, such as reusability, redundancy and limited crack propagation. New mathematical methods enable the generation of vast numbers of new topologically interlocking blocks. A natural next question is the quantification of the mechanical performance of these new blocks. We conduct a numerical study of topological interlocking assemblies whose blocks are constructed based on the hexagonal grid. By varying a design parameter used in the generation of these blocks, we study its influence on the structural performance of the entire assembly. The results improve our understanding of the link between the block parameters and the mechanical performance. This enhances the ability to custom design blocks for certain mechanical requirements of the topological interlocking assemblies.

We present a straightforward analytical-numerical methodology for determining polynomially complete and irreducible scalar-valued invariant sets for anisotropic hyperelasticity. By applying the proposed technique, we obtain irreducible integrity bases for all common anisotropies in hyperelasticity via the structural tensor concept, i.e., invariants are formed from a measure of deformation (symmetric 2nd order tensor) and a set of structural tensors describing the material's symmetry. Our work covers results for the 11 types of anisotropy that arise from the classical 7 crystal systems, as well as findings for 4 additional non-crystal anisotropies derived from the cylindrical, spherical, and icosahedral symmetry systems. Polynomial completeness and irreducibility of the proposed integrity bases are proven using the Molien series and, in addition, with established results for scalar-valued invariant sets from the literature. Furthermore, we derive relationships between a set of multiple structural tensors that specify a symmetry group and a description using only a single structural tensor. Both can be used to construct irreducible integrity bases by applying the proposed analytical-numerical method. The provided invariant sets are of great importance for modeling anisotropic materials via the structural tensor concept using both classical models as well as modern approaches based on machine learning. Alongside the results presented, this article also aims to provide an introductory overview of the complex field of modeling anisotropic materials.

Direction-dependent charge transport and optical responses are characteristic of van der Waals (vdW) materials with strong in-plane anisotropy. While transition-metal trichalcogenides (TMTCs) exemplify this behavior, heavier analogs remain largely unexplored. In this study we examine USe$_3$ as an anisotropic vdW material and a heavier analog of the well-studied TMTCs. We reveal strong in-plane anisotropy using polarization-resolved Raman spectroscopy, investigate strain-induced shifts of phonon modes, and quantify direction-dependent charge-carrier mobility through transport measurements on field-effect devices. First-principles calculations based on density-functional theory corroborate our findings, providing a theoretical basis for our experimental observations. Casting USe$_3$ as an actinide analog of a TMTC establishes a platform for exploring low-dimensional semiconductors that combine strong in-plane anisotropy with f-electron physics.

- **TL;DR**: 研究粉末XRD到晶体结构的映射问题，通过梯度下降优化从适度失真的初始状态恢复正确结构，发现常用XRD相似度度量导致高度非凸优化景观，约束到真实晶体家族可显著改善恢复效果。

Solving crystal structures from powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) is a central challenge in materials characterization. In this work, we study the powder XRD-to-structure mapping using gradient descent optimization, with the goal of recovering the correct structure from moderately distorted initial states based solely on XRD similarity. We show that commonly used XRD similarity metrics result in a highly non-convex landscape, complicating direct optimization. Constraining the optimization to the ground-truth crystal family significantly improves recovery, yielding higher match rates and increased mutual information and correlation scores between structural similarity and XRD similarity. Nevertheless, the landscape may remain non-convex along certain symmetry axes. These findings suggest that symmetry-aware inductive biases could play a meaningful role in helping learning models navigate the inverse mapping from diffraction to structure.

The recent capability to use THz pulses to control the nuclear quantum degrees of freedom in crystals has opened promising avenues for the advanced manipulation of material properties. While numerical approaches exist for studying the time evolution of the quantum nuclear density matrix, an interpretable analytical framework to explicitly analyze the influence of quantum fluctuations on nuclear dynamics remains lacking. In this work, we present an analytical quantum theory of nonlinear phononics. This framework is a basis for deriving models of realistic materials, allowing for exact solutions of the nuclear time evolution with full consideration of quantum fluctuations. This is accomplished by treating for all possible third- and fourth-order phonon couplings and expressing forces as analytic functions of such fluctuations. We provide an analytic proof that, in general, a strong pulse displacing a phonon mode from equilibrium induces the quenching, or squeezing, of its quantum lattice fluctuations. This finding, which establishes a systematization of the mechanism observed in Ref. 1, introduces a new paradigm in nonlinear phononics, harnessing this cooling effect to drive symmetry breaking in quantum paraelectric materials.

High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) is crucial for observing material's structural and morphological evolution at Angstrom scales, but the electron beam can alter these processes. Devices such as CMOS-based direct-electron detectors operating in electron-counting mode can be utilized to substantially reduce the electron dosage. However, the resulting images often lead to low signal-to-noise ratio, which requires frame integration that sacrifices temporal resolution. Several machine learning (ML) models have been recently developed to successfully denoise HRTEM images. Yet, these models are often computationally expensive and their inference speeds on GPUs are outpaced by the imaging speed of advanced detectors, precluding in situ analysis. Furthermore, the performance of these denoising models on datasets with imaging conditions that deviate from the training datasets have not been evaluated. To mitigate these gaps, we propose a new self-supervised ML denoising pipeline specifically designed for time-series HRTEM images. This pipeline integrates a blind-spot convolution neural network with pre-processing and post-processing steps including drift correction and low-pass filtering. Results demonstrate that our model outperforms various other ML and non-ML denoising methods in noise reduction and contrast enhancement, leading to improved visual clarity of atomic features. Additionally, the model is drastically faster than U-Net-based ML models and demonstrates excellent out-of-distribution generalization. The model's computational inference speed is in the order of milliseconds per image, rendering it suitable for application in in-situ HRTEM experiments.
