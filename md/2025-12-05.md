Recently, coexisting ferroelectricity and superconductivity were reported in bilayer T$_{\textrm{d}}$-MoTe$_2$ and twisted bilayer graphene. Importantly, it was observed that an applied displacement field switches the superconductivity with a ferroelectric hysteresis. Such direct coupling between the ferroelectricity and superconductivity offers promising pathways for developing low-power, non-volatile memory devices. However, the coupling mechanism between the ferroelectricity and superconductivity remains poorly understood. In this work, we demonstrate that in a superconducting bilayer, the hysteretic switching of superconductivity can arise from an interlayer pairing. By deriving the Landau Ginzburg free energy expansion for the interlayer pairing, we show that along the ferroelectric hysteresis loop, the hysteretic exceeding of the critical polarization $P_{\textrm{c}}$ that destroys the interlayer pairing leads to the hysteretic switching of superconductivity. The condition to have a ferroelectric hysteretic superconducting state is established to be $P_{\textrm{r}}&lt;P_{\textrm{c}}&lt;P_{\textrm{s}}$, where $P_{\textrm{r}}$ and $P_{\textrm{s}}$ denote the remanent and saturated polarization, respectively. Crucially, our scenario of interlayer pairing yields two predictions: (1) an enhancement of the upper critical displacement field with stronger interlayer coupling and (2) a pronounced, gate-tunable interlayer crossed Andreev reflection, both of which provide clear pathways for experimental verification.

- **TL;DR**: 镍酸盐薄膜在常压下实现63K超导转变温度，通过极端非平衡生长方法突破先前40K限制，表现出奇异金属行为

Ambient-pressure superconductivity in nickelates has been capped at an onset transition temperature (Tc) of ~40 K, a value that remains lower than the cuprate (~133 K) and iron-based (~55 K) counterparts, despite the promise shown under high pressure. Here, we report ambient-pressure superconductivity onset at ~63 K in epitaxial (La,Pr)3Ni2O7 thin films grown under compressive strain on SrLaAlO4 substrates. This Tc leap is enabled by pushing our gigantic-oxidative atomic-layer-by-layer epitaxy (GAE) method into an extreme non-equilibrium growth regime. It leverages powerful in situ oxidation to simultaneously enhance kinetics via higher temperatures and achieve full oxygenation without post-annealing. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction and scanning transmission electron microscopy confirm that this approach yields films of large-scale crystalline purity, overcoming the inherent metastability of the strained superconducting phase. These films exhibit a systematic evolution in their normal-state resistivity-temperature curve: the power-law exponent $α$ evolves from Fermi-liquid-like ($α$ ~2) at lower Tc to strange-metal-like ($α$ ~1) in higher Tc samples, directly linking the enhanced superconductivity to non-Fermi liquid behavior. Mapping the vortex melting phase diagram by the mutual inductance technique further reveals 2D melting limit suppressed to near zero, which demonstrates significantly stronger interlayer coupling than that of cuprates. These results identify the nickelates as an anisotropic-3D high-Tc system exhibiting strange-metal behavior, presenting an alternative framework to the quasi-2D cuprate paradigm.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究提出使用超薄金覆盖层作为钝化策略，实现350°C低温、0.495MPa低压的铌-铌热压键合，为可扩展3D超导量子计算架构提供可靠途径。

Scalable quantum computing currently requires a large array of qubit integration, but present two-dimensional interconnects face challenges such as wiring congestion, electromagnetic interference, and limited cryogenic space. To overcome this challenge, implementing three-dimensional (3D) vertical architectures becomes crucial. Niobium (Nb), due to its excellent superconducting characteristics and strong fabrication process compatibility, stands out as a prime material choice. The main challenge in Nb-Nb bonding is the presence of an oxide layer at the interface, even after post-bonding annealing across various bonding methods. The native Nb oxide forms rapidly in air, creating a resistive barrier to supercurrent flow and introducing two-level system losses that degrade qubit coherence while increasing the overall thermal budget. These issues show the need for effective surface engineering to suppress oxidation during bonding. This study introduces an ultrathin gold (Au) capping layer as a passivation strategy to prevent oxygen incorporation at the Nb surface. This approach enables low-temperature Nb-Nb thermocompression bonding at 350 °C under a reduced bonding pressure of 0.495 MPa. Detailed microstructural and interfacial analyses confirm that Au passivation effectively suppresses oxide formation and hence enhances bonding uniformity and strength with keeping the superconductivity, establishing a robust route toward low-temperature, low-pressure Nb-Nb bonding for scalable 3D superconducting quantum computing architectures.

- **TL;DR**: 使用CDMFT研究La₃Ni₂O₇中双计数修正对关联电子结构的影响，发现双计数参数可调控轨道选择性态密度变化，d_z²轨道对费米能级附近电子结构敏感，d_x²-y²轨道则基本不变，并确定了与实验值一致的最佳双计数窗口。

We employ cluster extension of dynamical mean-field theory (CDMFT) to systematically investigate the impact of double counting corrections on the correlated electronic structure of ${\rm La_3Ni_2O_7}$ under ambient pressure. By adjusting double-counting parameters, while maintaining a fixed Fermi surface, we observe a pronounced orbital-selective density of states change: the $d_{z^2}$ orbital undergoes significant variation near the Fermi level with increasing $E_{dc}^z$, while the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital remains essentially unchanged throughout the entire range. Analysis of renormalization factor show the monotonic dependence with double counting in both $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital, and it also identifies an optimal double counting window in $d_{z^2}$ orbital aligns with experimental values. We also find the interlayer Matsubara self energy exhibits non-monotonic dependence on $E_{dc}^z$, deviating from theoretical predictions. This anomaly is attributed to the metallization of oxygen-bridged pathways, which disrupts the prerequisite for charge transfer via apical oxygen. Our results establish $E_{dc}$ as a critical control parameter for correlated electronic structure in ${\rm La_3Ni_2O_7}$ and provide a computational framework for resolving orbital-dependent correlation effects in layered materials.

This paper presents the execution and analysis of a comprehensive quantum chemistry pipeline for gathering actionable insight into asphalt aging mechanisms through the study of dibenzothiophene (DBT), a key sulfur-containing compound in asphalt binders. Using advanced quantum algorithms, specifically Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) with k-UpCCGSD and ADAPT-VQE ansatze, we achieved ground state energy calculations with accuracies reaching -864.69 Ha. Our implementation demonstrates quantum advantages in handling strongly correlated electron systems while providing actionable insights for designing oxidation-resistant asphalt formulations. The work also establishes a scalable framework for quantum-enhanced materials design.

### Symmetry-enforced Fermi surfaces

We identify a symmetry that enforces every symmetric model to have a Fermi surface. These symmetry-enforced Fermi surfaces are realizations of a powerful form of symmetry-enforced gaplessness. The symmetry we construct exists in quantum lattice fermion models on a $d$-dimensional Bravais lattice, and is generated by the onsite U(1) fermion number symmetry and non-onsite Majorana translation symmetry. The resulting symmetry group is a non-compact Lie group closely related to the Onsager algebra. For a symmetry-enforced Fermi surface $\cal{F}$, we show that this UV symmetry group always includes the subgroup of the ersatz Fermi liquid L$_{\cal{F}}$U(1) symmetry group formed by even functions ${f(\mathbf{k})\in\mathrm{U}(1)}$ with ${\mathbf{k}\in \cal{F}}$. Furthermore, we comment on the topology of these symmetry-enforced Fermi surfaces, proving they generically exhibit at least two non-contractible components (i.e., open orbits).

We develop a unified framework to compute band-geometric quantities in multiband systems whose low-energy Hamiltonians realize arbitrary $SU(2)$ representations. Exploiting the presence of a quantization axis, we use the Wigner--Eckart theorem to identify the allowed interband matrix elements and obtain compact analytic expressions for the quantum geometric tensor, the orbital magnetic moment, and the resulting orbital transport coefficients. The formalism applies to both multifold fermions and gapped $SU(2)$ models. Its versatility is demonstrated through explicit calculations in representative $SU(3)$ and $SU(4)$ settings, where orbital Edelstein and orbital Hall responses arise naturally from the antisymmetric components of the band geometry. Our results reveal a universal link between the algebraic structure of the Hamiltonian and emergent orbitronic phenomena.

Thermal compositional multiphase flow in porous media with phase transitions involves complex nonlinear interactions among flow, transport, and phase equilibrium. This paper presents a persistent-variable formulation for thermal compositional flow using enthalpy to formulate the energy balance and the local equilibrium problem. Equilibrium conditions are derived from a thermodynamically consistent minimization problem using a persistent set of variables, allowing for seamless integration of equilibrium calculations into a fully coupled flow and transport model. This formulation does not require phase stability tests and provides a continuous and full mathematical description of the multiphysics system, suitable for challenging non-isothermal scenarios. To tackle the nonlinearities arising from phase transitions, we embed a local solver for the thermodynamic subproblem within a global Newton solver for the fully implicit system. The local solver exploits the locality of the subproblem for parallelization and leverages the modularity of the persistent-variable formulation for both isothermal and isenthalpic equilibrium conditions locally. We demonstrate the capability of our approach to simulate complex high-enthalpy systems, including narrow-boiling phenomena. The impact of the embedded local solver is analyzed through numerical experiments, demonstrating a reduction in global nonlinear iterations of up to 23 \% with increased use of the local solver. The number of local iterations is controlled with a local solver tolerance and no significant impact on the global iteration number was observed for local residual tolerances as high as $1e-3$. The persistent-variable approach using enthalpy and the modularity of the embedded local solver advance the usage of equilibrium calculations in multiphase flow simulations and are suitable for high-enthalpy applications.

We investigate the monitored dynamics of many-body quantum systems in which projective measurements of extensive operators are alternated with unitary evolution. Focusing on mean-field models characterized by all-to-all interactions, we develop a general framework that captures the thermodynamic limit, where a semiclassical description naturally emerges. Remarkably, we uncover novel stationary states, distinct from the conventional infinite-temperature state, that arise upon taking the infinite-volume limit. Counterintuitively, this phenomenon is not linked to the closing of the Lindbladian gap in that limit. We provide analytical explanation for this unexpected behavior.

The structural flexibility and multifunctional nature of double perovskite oxides make them attractive for applications requiring coupled optical, mechanical, and thermal performance. Using first-principles computations, this study examines the structural, electronic, elastic, optical, and thermoelectric stability of K2NbTaO6 and Rb2NbTaO6. The two compounds combine to form a cubic double perovskite structure with ordered Nb$^{5+}$ and Ta$^{5+}$ cations. The calculated elastic constants satisfy the Born stability criteria, confirming mechanical stability; however, both K2NbTaO6 and Rb2NbTaO6 exhibit brittle behavior according to Pugh's ratio, reflecting limited ductility. Semiconducting behavior is revealed by band structure analysis with energy gaps of 2.79 eV for K2NbTaO6 and 2.63 eV for Rb2NbTaO6. Optical spectra show noticeable absorption in the high-energy region near the UV, indicating relevance for theoretical studies of optoelectronic and photocatalytic processes, without implying practical device efficiency.

### Interplay between Superconductivity and Altermagnetism in Disordered Materials and Heterostructures

We study the interplay between superconductivity and altermagnetism in disordered systems using recently derived quantum kinetic transport equations. Starting from this framework, we derive the Ginzburg-Landau free energy and identify, in addition to the conventional pair-breaking term, a coupling between the spin and the spatial variation of the superconducting order parameter. Two distinct effects emerge from this coupling. The first is a magnetoelectric effect, in which a supercurrent (i.e., a phase gradient) induces a spin texture; this contribution is quadratic in the phase gradient. The second effect arises when the magnitude, rather than the phase, of the superconducting order parameter varies in space, likewise leading to a finite magnetization. We show that these two contributions compete in the case of an Abrikosov vortex, where both the amplitude and phase of the order parameter vary spatially. The effect associated with amplitude variations also gives rise to a proximity-induced magnetization (PIM) in hybrid structures composed of a superconductor (S) and an altermagnet (AM). Using quasiclassical theory, we analyze the PIM in diffusive S/AM bilayers and S/AM/S Josephson junctions, and determine the induced magnetization profiles. In Josephson junctions, where both the PIM and the magnetoelectric effect coexist, we further predict the occurrence of $0$-$π$ transitions.

- **TL;DR**: 提出一种迭代算法，用于从低动量转移缺失数据的电子衍射测量中恢复真实空间信息，类似于相位恢复算法，但目标是恢复缺失数据而非相位。

We report an iterative algorithm to retrieve accurate real space information from gas electron diffraction measurements with missing data at low momentum transfer. The algorithm is similar to phase retrieval algorithms which transform signals back and forth between the signal domain and the Fourier domain and apply constraints to retrieve the missing phase. The difference in our case is that the goal is not retrieval of the phase of the diffraction signal but the missing data at low momentum transfer, which is necessary for generating the real-space pair distribution function. The missing data is a common problem in static and ultrafast gas phase electron diffraction experiments due to experimental constraints. We demonstrated successful restoration of the missing data in simulated data and in experimentally measured diffraction signals of static and photo-dissociated trifluoroiodomethane and iodobenzene molecules.

### Deformed LDPC codes with spontaneously broken non-invertible duality symmetries

- **TL;DR**: 该论文提出了一种对LDPC码哈密顿量的对称性保持变形方法，在横向场存在下识别出具有特殊性质的关键点，这些点实现了平凡相与非平凡相之间的相变。

Low-density parity check (LDPC) codes are a well known class of Pauli stabiliser Hamiltonians that furnish fixed-point realisations of nontrivial gapped phases such as symmetry breaking and topologically ordered (including fracton) phases. In this work, we propose symmetry-preserving deformations of these models, in the presence of a transverse field, and identify special points along the deformations with interesting features: (i) the special point is frustration-free, (ii) its ground states include a product state and the code space of the underlying code, and (iii) it remains gapped in the thermodynamic (infinite volume) limit. So the special point realises a first-order transition between (or the coexistence of) the trivial gapped phase and the nontrivial gapped phase associated with the code. In addition, if the original model has a non-invertible duality symmetry, then so does the deformed model. In this case, the duality symmetry is spontaneously broken at the special point, consistent with the associated anomaly.
  A key step in proving the gap is a coarse-graining/blocking procedure on the Tanner graph of the code that allows us to apply the martingale method successfully. Our model, therefore, provides the first application of the martingale method to a frustration-free model, that is not commuting projector, defined on an arbitrary Tanner graph.
  We also discuss several familiar examples on Euclidean spatial lattice. Of particular interest is the 2+1d transverse field Ising model: while there is no non-invertible duality symmetry in this case, our results, together with known numerical results, suggest the existence of a tricritical point in the phase diagram.

Superconducting weak-link junctions host electron--hole hybridized excitations called Andreev bound states. These have attracted significant interest for the role they play in the device microelectronic operation and for quantum information applications. Andreev physics has so far been synonymous with the microwave range. However, the maturation of superconductor--semiconductor hybrid junctions opens the door to the characterization, and manipulation, of Andreev states by light. Here we introduce a model for light--Andreev interaction, with distinct features: Electrons transitioning into Andreev levels can sidestep Pauli exclusion, resulting in two optical absorption resonances separated by twice the bound state energy. One resonance populates the Andreev state and the other empties it; pumping both resets the junction and prevents saturation. Given their natural microwave coupling, we show how Andreev bound states can operate as optical--to--microwave transducers. We illustrate these effects with realistic device parameters. Our results highlight the possibilities in the new field of Andreev optoelectronics.

The paper is devoted to the study of circularly coiled optical slab waveguides, which is also applicable to acoustical waveguides. We use a change of variables and the classical Frobenius method to compute Bessel functions of complex order and complex argument, and combine it with a perfectly matched layer technique to solve the relevant Bessel eigenvalue problem and deliver accurate loss factors for eigensolutions to the three-layer optical slab waveguide problem. The solutions provide a benchmark for verifying model implementations of this problem and allow for a numerical verification of the Glazman criterion that provides a foundation for the well-posedness and stability analysis of homogeneous circular waveguides with impedance boundary conditions.

- **TL;DR**: 提出统一平均场框架，连接非正式金融市场和受限价订单簿（LOB）管理的正式市场，通过偏好交互参数Ψ调节交易概率，从随机交易（Ψ=0）到最优交易（Ψ→∞）连续过渡。

We propose a unified mean-field framework that bridges the dynamics of informal financial markets and formal markets governed by Limit Order Books (LOBs). Both settings are modeled as interacting particle systems on a 1D price lattice, with temporal evolution described by master equations that account for new entries, cancellations, and executions. The key insight is the introduction of a preferential interaction parameter $Ψ$, which modulates the likelihood of transactions based on price compatibility: when $Ψ=0$, interactions are random and uncoordinated, reproducing the structure of informal markets; as $Ψ\to \infty$, only optimal (most mutually attractive) trades occur, recovering LOB-like dynamics. A grand-canonical interpretation is used to identify effective thermodynamic quantities -such as interaction energy and price-dependent chemical potentials -that underlie both systems. Most results are validated through numerical integration and simulations, although an analytical solution is shown to exist at least for the symmetric stationary case of the informal market.

Silicon carbide (SiC) divacancies are attractive candidates for spin defect qubits possessing long coherence times and optical addressability. The high activation barriers associated with SiC defect formation and motion pose challenges for their study by first-principles molecular dynamics. In this work, we develop and deploy machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) to accelerate defect dynamics simulations while retaining ab initio accuracy. We employ an active learning strategy comprising symmetry-adapted collective variable discovery and enhanced sampling to compile configurationally diverse training data, calculation of energies and forces using density functional theory (DFT), and training of an E(3)-equivariant MLIP based on the Allegro model. The trained MLIP reproduces DFT-level accuracy in defect transition activation free energy barriers, enables the efficient and stable simulation of multi-defect 216-atom supercells, and permits an analysis of the temperature dependence of defect thermodynamic stability and formation/annihilation kinetics to propose an optimal annealing temperature to maximally stabilize VV divacancies.

In the search for small organoselenium-based mimics of the glutathione peroxidase (GPx) enzyme, it has been observed that selenenyl sulfides (RSeSG) derived from amine-based GPx mimics have the potential to be reduced at the catalytic site of glutathione reductase (GR), thereby enhancing the catalytic efficiency of these mimics in biological systems. However, molecular insights into these interactions are lacking due to the absence of force field parameters for Se-S containing compounds. In this study, we present force field parameters for selenenyl sulfides with a phenyl selenide backbone developed using the General Amber Force Field (GAFF). Employing these parameters, a 200 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of RSeSG was performed. The results indicate that both the amino nitrogen and its substituent significantly influence the interaction of RSeSG at the catalytic site of GR.

We analyze a series of interacting Majorana Fermion chains with finite range pair interactions with coupling strength $g$ that all exhibit a tri-critical point that separates an Ising critical phase from a supersymmetric gapped phase. We first notice that the interacting models exhibit an even-odd asymmetry depending on the number of sites, $δ$, over which the interaction ranges. The even case exhibits competing order, thereby making it numerically untractable while the odd case exhibits an exactly solvable point at $g=-0.5$ where the entanglement entropy vanishes. By introducing a swirling geometrical twist, we map our 1D $δ$-range chains to a series of 2D $δ/2$-width models. Our new 2D models possess a unique helical boundary condition, constructed from 1D chains with the end of one connected to the start of another. We propose that the phase transition in the 1D system can be understood as a finite-system size transition in 2D. That is, the $g_c-δ$ behavior is controlled by a 2D tri-critical universality class at $δ\to\infty$ limit and is predicted by finite-size scaling theory.

- **TL;DR**: 在3D外尔半金属的量子霍尔体系中施加面内磁场，发现了新的量子振荡、非量子化磁阻、负纵向电阻等独特输运现象，突破了传统拓扑输运的表征。

Studies of the 3D quantum Hall effect (QHE) have primarily emphasized transport features that mimic the well-established 2D QHE. In this work, we show that qualitatively new features arise when an in-plane magnetic field is applied to a 3D Weyl semimetal in the quantum Hall regime. An unexpected Hall quantum oscillation, distinct from the Weyl-orbit oscillation, coexists with the QHE, along with an unquantized two-terminal magnetoresistance. Moreover, unconventional antichiral transmission enables a peculiar disorder-robust negative longitudinal resistance. Quantization tunable by the lead configuration is further found in this transport geometry. A unique type of nonlocal quantum backscattering channels underlies these phenomena. Our work demonstrates a breakdown of the topological characterization of transport even with 3D Chern numbers and reveals hidden 3D QHE transport properties. It opens a new class of transport measurements and phenomena.

- **TL;DR**: QUMASUN是一个GPU可移植的实空间密度泛函理论代码，在Intel Xeon 6980P CPU、AMD MI300A GPU和NVIDIA GH200 GPU上进行基准测试，实现了2-2.8倍加速。

We present a GPU-portable implementation of a real-space density functional theory (DFT) code ``QUMASUN'' and benchmark it on the new Plasma Simulator featuring Intel Xeon 6980P CPUs, and AMD MI300A GPUs. Additional tests were performed on an NVIDIA GH200 GPU. In particular MI300A supports unified memory and GH200 supports coherent memory interconnect, simplifying GPU porting. A lightweight C++ lambda-based layer enables CPU, CUDA, and HIP execution without OpenMP/OpenACC preprocessor directives. For diamond (216 atoms) and tungsten (128 atoms) systems, MI300A and GH200 achieve 2.0-2.8 $\times$ and 2.3-2.4 $\times$ speedups over a 256-core Xeon node. The compute-bound kernels, which are fast Fourier transforms (FFT), dense matrix-matrix multiplications (GEMM) and eigenvalue solver, show substantial acceleration on both GPUs, indicating that the present GPU-portable approach can benefit a wide range of plasma-fusion simulation codes beyond DFT.

- **TL;DR**: 本文为Persson粗糙表面接触理论提供详细教程，基于随机过程理论给出新推导，澄清原推导中的简化问题，帮助研究人员理解该理论。

Persson's theory of purely normal rough surface contact was developed two decades ago during the study of tire-road interaction, and gradually became one of the dominant approaches to study the solid-solid interaction between rough surfaces. Contrary to its popular applications in various cross-disciplinary fields, the fundamental study of Persson's theory of contact attracted little attention from the tribology and contact mechanics communities. As far as the authors know, many researchers struggle to understand the derivation of the theory. Few attempts have been made to clarify the oversimplified derivation provided by Persson (Persson, 2001). The present work provides a detailed tutorial on Persson's theory, which does not simply follow the commonly adopted derivation initiated by Persson. A new derivation is given based on stochastic process theory, assuming that the variation of the random contact pressure with respect to scale is a Markov process. We revisit the essential assumptions utilized to derive the diffusion equation, boundary conditions, drift and diffusion coefficients, and closed-form results. This tutorial can serve as a self-consistent introduction for solid mechanicians, tribologists, and postgraduate students who are not familiar with Persson's theory, or who struggle to understand it.

- **TL;DR**: 优化非晶硅缓冲层可提升AlInN/Si异质结太阳能电池性能，最佳铝含量为22%时转换效率达4.1%

This study explores the impact of an optimized amorphous silicon (a-Si) buffer layer on AlxIn1-xN-on-Si(100) heterojunction solar cells, with Al content varying from 0% (InN) to 55%. The buffer layer improves the structural quality of the AlInN layer, as evidenced by reduced full width at half maximum values in X-ray diffraction rocking curves around the AlInN (0002) peak. Atomic force microscopy reveals that the buffer layer does not alter surface roughness. The effectiveness of the a-Si buffer is demonstrated by an enhancement of the conversion efficiency under AM1.5G illumination from 3.3 % to 3.9 % for devices with 35 % Al. Looking at the effect of the Al content in devices with the a-Si buffer, the device with 22% Al shows the best photovoltaic performance, with a conversion efficiency of 4.1 % and a VOC of 0.42 V, JSC of 15.4 mA/cm2, and FF of 63.3%. However, performance declines for Al contents above 36% due to increased resistivity and reduced carrier concentration. These findings highlight the critical role of the novel a-Si buffer layer developed by RF-sputtering and the Al content in optimizing AlInN/Si heterojunction solar cell performance.

Atomically precise metal nanoclusters bridge the molecular and bulk regimes, but designing bimetallic motifs with targeted stability and reactivity remains challenging. Here we combine density functional theory (DFT) and physics-grounded predictive artificial intelligence to map the configurational landscape of 13-atom icosahedral nanoclusters X$_{12}$TM, with hosts X = (Ti, Zr, Hf), and Fe and a single transition--metal dopant spanning the 3$d$-5$d$ series. Spin-polarized DFT calculations on 240 bimetallic clusters reveal systematic trends in binding and formation energies, distortion penalties, effective coordination number, d-band centre, and HOMO-LUMO gap that govern the competition between core-shell (in) and surface-segregated (out) arrangements. We then pretrain a transformer architecture on a curated set of 2968 unary clusters from the Quantum Cluster Database and fine-tune it on bimetallic data to predict formation energies and in/out preference, achieving mean absolute errors of about $0.6-0.7$eV and calibrated uncertainty intervals. The resulting model rapidly adapts to an unseen Fe-host domain with only a handful of labelled examples. At the same time, attention patterns and Shapley attributions highlight size mismatch, $d$-electron count, and coordination environment as key descriptors. All data, code, and workflows follow FAIR/TRUE principles, enabling reproducible, interpretable screening of unexplored nanocluster chemistries for catalysis and energy conversion.

We report proof-of-concept measurements of the magnetocaloric effect (MCE) in ultrahigh magnetic fields up to 120 T for the classical spin-ice compound Ho$_{2}$Ti$_{2}$O$_{7}$. Radio-frequency resistivity measurements using an Au$_{16}$Ge$_{84}$ thin-film thermometer enable us to detect a rapid change in the sample temperature associated with a crystal-field level crossing in the high-field region in addition to a giant MCE at low fields. We discuss a possible delay in the temperature response and outline prospects for more precise MCE measurements in destructive pulsed fields.

Despite the decades that have passed since the discovery of ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy and its apparent simplicity, this method is still often subject to experimental errors and misinterpretations when applied to 2D semiconductors. The reason for this lies not only in the unique nature of these extremely thin samples, but also in the different experimental configurations and data processing methods used. Moreover, since this type of spectroscopy was originally used to characterize the ultrafast relaxation dynamics of photoexcited carriers in chemical compounds, colloidal nanostructures and gas molecules, a purely 'molecular' approach to interpreting transient absorption spectra of 2D semiconductors is often proposed. However, this approach is fundamentally inapplicable to thin-film semiconductors grown or mechanically exfoliated on transparent substrates. This review considers the recent experimental results of ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy of 2D semiconductors in a wide spectral range from several THz to UV (~1000 THz) based on the 'solid-state' approach to their interpretation. We also highlight typical errors that arise in measuring, processing and interpreting transient absorption spectra of 2D semiconductors.

- **TL;DR**: 提出两种完全守恒的压力平衡保持方法，用于解决多组分欧拉方程中由于热力学关系非线性引起的虚假压力振荡问题。

Typical fully conservative discretizations of the Euler compressible single or multi-component fluid equations governed by a real-fluid equation of state exhibit spurious pressure oscillations due to the nonlinearity of the thermodynamic relation between pressure, density, and internal energy. A fully conservative, pressure-equilibrium preserving method and a high-order, fully conservative, approximate pressure-equilibrium preserving method are presented. Both methods are general and can handle an arbitrary equation of state and arbitrary number of species. Unlike existing approaches to discretize the multi-component Euler equations, we do not introduce non conservative updates, overspecified equations, or design for a specific equation of state. The proposed methods are demonstrated on inviscid smooth interface advection problems governed by three equations of state: ideal-gas, stiffened-gas, and van der Waals where we show orders of magnitude reductions in spurious pressure oscillations compared to existing schemes.

We study the effects of dissipation in the phase diagram of the random quantum Ashkin-Teller model by means of a generalization of the strong-disorder renormalization group combined with adiabatic renormalization. This model has three phases and three quantum phase transitions. We demonstrate that the combined effect of Ohmic dissipation and quenched disorder smears two out of the three quantum phase transitions. Our analytical theory allows us to understand why one of the phase transitions remains sharp. This is due to a cancellation of the dissipation effects on the nontrivial nature of the intertwined order parameter of one of the phases.

- **TL;DR**: 研究四种复杂氧化物家族中高熵氧化物（HEO）的相形成与稳定性，发现仅钙钛矿型Ba(Ti,Zr,Hf,Sn)O₃成功合成，其他体系因竞争相、缺陷结构或前驱体熔融而未能形成目标HEO。

Tailoring the chemical composition of a high entropy oxide (HEO) is a powerful approach to enhancing desirable material properties. However, the targeted synthesis of HEO materials is often hindered by competing stabilizing and destabilizing factors, which are difficult to predict. This work examines the effects of increased configurational entropy on the phase formation and stability of four notable complex oxide families: perovskite ($AB$O$_3$}), pyrochlore ($A_2B_2$O$_7$), Ruddlesden-Popper ($A_2B$O$_4$), and zirconium tungstate ($AB_2$O$_8$). Each of these structures has a tetravalent cation site, which we attempt to substitute with an entropic mixture of four cations, benchmarked by the parallel synthesis of a non-disordered reference compound. While all four target high entropy materials can be expected to form based on ionic radii criteria, only the high entropy perovskite Ba(Ti,Zr,Hf,Sn)O$_3$ is successfully synthesized. In the case of the pyrochlore, an entropy-stabilized defect fluorite is formed instead, while the Ruddlesden-Popper phase co-exists with multiple competing phases. For the tungstate, an unexpected deep eutectic point between the precursors results in melting that precedes the formation of a high entropy phase. Our case studies therefore illustrate that the stability of HEOs cannot be straightforwardly predicted based on ionic radii, lattice geometry, and charge-balancing considerations alone due to the underlying complexity of the interactions between the many chemical constituents.

### Phase transitions on the dark side of the Gross-Neveu model

Gross-Neveu model in 2+1 dimensions exhibits a continuous transition from gapless Dirac semimetal to the gapped quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulator at a finite (attractive) coupling, at which the inversion and time-reversal symmetry become spontaneously broken, and the flavor O($M$) symmetry remains preserved. A unification of leading order parameters of 2+1 dimensional $N$ four-component Dirac fermions collects all Lorentz-singlet mass-like fermion bilinears, except the one condensing in the QAH state, into an irreducible representation of the O($M=4N$), and predicts another phase transition in the Gross-Neveu model to occur at a strong (repulsive) coupling. Here, a fermionic auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo algorithm is employed in order to study a lattice realization of the Gross-Neveu field theory in the repulsive regime, where the sign problem is absent. We indeed find the O($4N$) symmetry breaking transition out of Dirac semimetal to occur and to be weakly first-order for $N=2$, relevant to graphene. The size of the discontinuity and the magnitude of the critical coupling, however, both grow with $N$. Adding a finite chemical potential is found to break the symmetry and cause superconductivity. These results are in broad agreement with the predictions of the unified field theory. Our lattice model also displays an interesting exact O($2N$) symmetry, a subgroup of the low-energy O($4N$), and has the ordered ground state with the order parameter that belongs to its $N(2N-1)$-dimensional representation. Other order parameters are also examined, and a certain hierarchy among those that belong to different representations of the exact $O(2N)$ is observed.

In this work we look into how the contact material influences the local charge properties of a p-type CdTe-based quantum well. We study five metals deposited as 10 nm layers on the sample surface: Au, Ag, Cr, Ni and Ti. We use magneto-spectroscopy to discriminate their charge states through monitoring the Zeeman shifts at singlet-triplet transitions. Most tested metals retain the original p-type of the QW, while gold and nickel coverage flips the local doping to n-type. This is attributed to a robust bonding of these two metals to the semiconductor, efficiently passivating its surface and thus improving electron diffusion from the metal to the quantum well.

The stochastic density functional theory (sDFT) has exhibited advantages over the standard Kohn-Sham DFT method and has become an attractive approach for large-scale electronic structure calculations. The sDFT method avoids the expensive matrix diagonalization by introducing a set of random orbitals and approximating the density matrix via Chebyshev expansion of a matrix-valued function. In this work, we study the sDFT with a plane-wave discretization, and discuss variance reduction algorithms in the framework of multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) methods. In particular, we show that the density matrix evaluation in sDFT can be decomposed into many levels by increasing the plane-wave cutoffs or the Chebyshev polynomial orders. This decomposition renders the computational cost independent of the discretization size or temperature. To demonstrate the efficiency of the algorithm, we provide rigorous analysis of the statistical errors and present numerical experiments on some material systems.

Determining the threshold value $σ_*$ that separates the short-range (SR) and long-range (LR) universality classes in phase transitions remains a controversial issue. While Sak's criterion, $σ_* = 2 - η_{\mathrm{SR}}$, has been widely accepted, recent studies of two-dimensional (2D) models with long-range interactions have challenged it. In this work, we focus on the crossover between LR and SR criticality in several classical 2D statistical models, including the XY, Heisenberg, percolation, and Ising models, whose interactions decay as $1/r^{2+σ}$. Our previous simulations for the XY, Heisenberg, and percolation models consistently indicate a universal boundary at $σ_* = 2$. Here, we complete the picture by performing large-scale Monte Carlo simulations of the 2D LR-Ising model, reaching lattice sizes up to $L = 8192$. By analyzing the Fortuin-Kasteleyn critical polynomial $R_p$, the Binder ratio $Q_m$, and the anomalous dimension $η$, we obtain convergent and self-consistent evidence that the universality class already changes sharply at $σ= 2$. Taken together, these results establish a unified scenario for LR interacting systems: across all studied models, the crossover from LR to SR universality occurs at $σ_* = 2$.

- **TL;DR**: 铜-石墨烯复合导体通过优化石墨烯质量和铜基体几何结构，可实现高达17.1%的电导率提升，关键因素包括石墨烯连续性、比表面积和铜基体曲率。

Copper-graphene composite (CGC) conductors are widely considered as a potential alternative to pure copper (Cu). Yet, the effect of graphene (Gr) on the electrical conductivity of CGCs remains elusive, and their electrical performance is still controversial. This work addresses these unresolved questions by unambiguously quantifying how the electrical properties of CGCs depend on the characteristics of Gr and Cu. Gr is synthesized on Cu foils, foams, and wires by utilizing a wide range of chemical vapor deposition conditions to independently control their characteristics. Then the Gr-enhanced electrical conductivity (Δσ) is characterized for CGCs with different Cu geometries and Gr qualities. This study confirms that unprecedented electrical conductivity (Δσ = 17.1%) can be achieved only when both Gr and Cu are carefully optimized. Specifically, the study reveals three key factors: (1) Δσ is positively correlated with continuity of Gr; (2) CGCs with a continuous monolayer Gr exhibit a strong Δσ-A_s linear relation where A_s is the specific surface area of a CGC; and (3) Δσ becomes more pronounced when a Cu matrix has a curved cross-section. This work reveals the fundamental mechanisms of how Gr influences the overall electrical conductivity of CGCs and, therefore, is a crucial step toward designing and manufacturing high-performance CGC conductors for emerging applications.

We observe anomalous charge modulations induced by ionized indium impurities on the surface of the semiconductor black phosphorus by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). When the im- purities are switched into a negatively charged state by the STM tip, periodic charge modulations emerge around the impurity center, but strictly confined by the nanoscale impurity potential. These modulations form a distorted triangular pattern, whose periodicity remains unchanged in a wide range of positive bias. Furthermore, these local charge orders exhibit an anisotropy opposite to that expected based on the anisotropy of the Fermi surface, challenging a simple band-structure inter- pretation. Our experiment demonstrates the possibility of creating and manipulating macroscopic charge orders through impurity engineering.

We investigate circular current in both ordered and disordered Hubbard quantum rings threaded by magnetic flux, employing exact diagonalization and the Hartree-Fock mean-field approach within the tight-binding framework. The influence of on-site and extended Hubbard interactions, disorder, and electron filling on the persistent current is systematically analyzed. To construct the full many-body Hamiltonian, we introduce a linear table formalism, which, to our knowledge, has been rarely used in this context. In ordered rings, the current decreases monotonically with increasing on-site repulsion, while the impact of the extended interaction depends strongly on the filling factor. At low filling, stronger extended interaction suppresses the current, whereas near half-filling, it enhances the current up to a critical ratio, half of the on-site strength, before reducing it. Disorder significantly modifies these behaviors, notably enhancing the current at less than quarter-filling with increasing extended interaction. The localization properties of eigenstates, examined via the inverse participation ratio, further support the crucial roles of filling and the interplay between on-site and extended interactions in governing persistent current.

Accurate and efficient solutions of spatio-temporal partial differential equations (PDEs), such as phase-field models, are fundamental for understanding interfacial dynamics and microstructural evolution in materials science and fluid mechanics. Neural Operators (NOs) have recently emerged as powerful data-driven alternatives to traditional solvers; however, existing architectures often accumulate temporal errors, struggle to generalize in long-horizon simulations, and require large training datasets. To overcome these limitations, we propose PENCO (Physics-Energy-Numerical-Consistent Operator), a hybrid operator-learning framework that integrates physical laws and numerical structure within a data-driven architecture. The formulation introduces an enhanced L^2 Gauss-Lobatto collocation residual around the temporal midpoint that robustly enforces the governing dynamics and significantly improves accuracy, a Fourier-space numerical consistency term that captures the balanced behavior of semi-implicit discretizations, and an energy-dissipation constraint that ensures thermodynamic consistency. Additional low-frequency spectral anchoring and teacher-consistency mechanisms further stabilize learning and suppress long-term error growth. This hybrid design enables PENCO to preserve governing physics while mitigating long-term error growth. Through extensive three-dimensional phase-field benchmarks covering phase ordering, crystallization, epitaxial growth, and complex pattern formation, PENCO demonstrates superior accuracy, stability, and data efficiency compared to state-of-the-art neural operators, including Multi-Head Neural Operator (MHNO) and Fourier Neural Operator (FNO-4D), while maintaining physically consistent evolution. The associated dataset and implementation are available at github.com/MBamdad/PENCO.

Turbulence of weakly interacting waves displays a great deal of universality: independence of the details of the interaction and of the pumping and dissipation scales. Here we study how inverse turbulent cascades (from small to large scales) transition from weak to strong. We find that while one-loop corrections can be dependent on excitation and dissipation scales, new types of universality appear in strong turbulence. We contrast turbulence of spin waves in ferromagnets with turbulent cascades in the Nonlinear Schrödinger Equation (NSE) and in an MMT-like model in higher dimensions having a multiplicative interaction vertex: vertex renormalization gives rise to dependence on the pumping (UV scale) in the former but not in the latter. As a result of this spectral nonlocality, spin-wave turbulence stops being weak if one is sufficiently far from the pumping scale, even when the interaction of waves with comparable wavenumbers is weak. We paraphrase this as: nonlocality enhances nonlinearity.
  We then describe strong turbulence in a multi-component version of these models with a large number of components. We argue that strong spin-wave turbulence is similar to turbulence of the focusing NSE, as it realizes a critical-balance state. However, UV nonlocality causes the level of spin-wave turbulence at large scales to decrease with increasing pumping level, culminating in a state that is independent of the level of pumping.

In obstructed atomic insulators, fractional charges appear at the corners of the crystals in the shapes of vertex-transitive polyhedra, and are given by the filling anomaly divided by the number of corners. Recent studies reveal that the filling anomaly for the cases with genus $0$ is universally given by the total charge at the Wyckoff position $1a$. In this study, we rewrite the formula in terms of the degree of sharpness of the corner, and show that the corner charge formula also holds for cases with arbitrary genus. We also extend our formula to vertex-transitive shell polyhedra, which are closed or open polyhedra without the bulk region, with all the vertices related by symmetry. Then, we show that the corner charges of such shell polyhedra are equal to the two-dimensional disclination charges of the corresponding disclinations. By identifying it with the disclination charge under the Wen-Zee action, we show that the coupling constant of the Wen-Zee action for a crystalline insulator is given by the total charge at the Wyckoff position at the disclination core.

- **TL;DR**: 加压镍酸盐La4Ni3O10在压力-温度相图中表现出直接四方-单斜相变，无中间正交相，且密度波有序可能对应第三结构相

The crux of understanding the superconducting mechanism in pressurized Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates hinges on elucidating their structural phases. Under ambient conditions, the trilayer nickelate La4Ni3O10 stabilizes in a twinned monoclinic structure with space group P21/c. Upon heating, it undergoes a structural transition to the tetragonal I4/mmm phase at Ts ~ 1030 K, while a second transition associated with the onset of density-weave (DW) ordering emerges upon cooling below TDW ~ 135 K. Here from pressure-temperature x-ray diffraction on high quality flux-grown single crystals we unequivocally demonstrate a direct tetragonal-to-monoclinic transition with no trace of intermediate orthorhombic Bmab phase. Ab initio density-functional theory calculations as a function of pressure fully corroborate the experimental observations. The transition unfolds as a 2-fold superstructure due to the emergence of commensurate superlattice reflections and can be progressively suppressed from 1030 K down to 20 K under 14 GPa. No discernible structural distortions associated with DW ordering are detected down to 20 K at ambient pressure. This is in contrast to Raman measurements that reveal the appearance of additional phonon modes below 130 K, implying a further reduction in symmetry from monoclinic P21/c and thus indicating the presence of a third structural phase associated with the DW ordering in La4Ni3O10.

- **TL;DR**: 提出d波交变磁体中的边缘自旋电效应，这是一种由载流子自旋取向驱动的沿样品边缘流动的电流，可通过改变非平衡自旋方向或奈尔矢量来反转电流方向。

The edge spin galvanic effect (ESGE) in $d$-wave altermagnets is proposed. ESGE is a creation of an electrical current flowing along the edge of the sample, which is driven by the spin orientation of charge carriers. The ESGE current is formed owing to the altermagnetic spin splitting and the scattering of carriers by the edge of the sample. The current is sensitive to the orientation of the edge in respect to the main axes of the altermagnet. The edge spin galvanic current reverses its direction upon a reversal of the non-equilibrium spin direction or the Néel vector. We also propose the pure spin edge photocurrent excited by polarized radiation and formed at the edges of a sample. Its dependence on the radiation polarization and frequency is analyzed. The application of an external magnetic field converts this pure spin photocurrent into an electric current along the edge.

The Volumetric Neutron Source (VNS) tokamak is a proposed fusion reactor for testing and qualification of reactor components for future use in a fusion power facility, and has potential use for radioisotope production. The VNS geometry is modeled in the Serpent and OpenMC neutronics codes. Analog neutron-photon coupled simulations are carried out to compare the model's vacuum vessel and blanket components across codes. In the vacuum vessel, neutron and photon flux maps are calculated, while in the blanket region, neutron and photon spectra, (n,T), and (n,2n) reaction rates are calculated and compared between models. The detector response comparisons found the following: neutron flux and (n,T) reactions achieved excellent agreement, the (n,2n) detector response had good agreement, and photon flux had regional discrepancies depending on Serpent tracking used. Hybrid tracking lead to a relative difference of about 20% in the outboard side blanket, where as employment of delta tracking resulted in less than 1% relative difference. On an HPC cluster, Serpent was found to have shorter computation time than OpenMC in neutron photon coupled simulations using both hybrid tracking and delta tracking, but longer in neutron only simulations. An exemplary radioisotope production case is presented for the demonstration of additional VNS capabilities.

Biological systems sense and extract information from fluctuating signals while operating under energetic constraints and limited resolution. We introduce a general chemical model in which a sensor, coupled to a signaling pathway activated by hidden signals, can allosterically tune the production of a readout molecule. We propose viable strategies for the sensor to estimate, and eventually balance, information gathering on the hidden process and the associated dissipative cost relying solely on counting statistics of observed trajectories. We show that these strategies can be successfully implemented to adapt the readout production even with finite-time measurements and limited dynamic resolution, and remain effective in the presence of inhibitory regulatory mechanisms. Our study provides a plausible mechanism to actively balance information and dissipation, paving the way for an implementable design principle underpinning biological and biochemical adaptation.

- **TL;DR**: 实验首次在银表面通过离子束辅助外延合成了氮烯（nitrogene），证实其具有褶皱蜂窝晶格结构，带隙高达7.5 eV，有望用于紫外光电器件和高k介电应用。

Nitrogen, the most abundant element in Earth's atmosphere, exists as a diatomic gas under standard temperature and pressure. In the two-dimensional (2D) limit, atomically thin nitrogen, termed nitrogene, has been theoretically predicted to form crystalline materials with various polymorphic configurations, exhibiting diverse chemical and physical properties. However, the synthesis of nitrogene has remained elusive due to the strong nitrogen-nitrogen triple bonds. Here, we report experimental evidence of the formation of nitrogen-based crystalline structures compatible with nitrogene on silver surfaces via ion-beam-assisted epitaxy. Through a combination of scanning tunneling microscopy, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, and first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that the nitrogene-like structure adopts a puckered honeycomb lattice. Notably, our calculations predict a nitrogene band gap of up to 7.5 eV, positioning it as a promising candidate for ultraviolet optoelectronic devices and high-k dielectric applications.

- **TL;DR**: CrSBr作为智能物质原型，通过可重构磁多层域结构实现信息编码、处理和存储，其磁光耦合特性为光信息读取提供机制，适用于神经形态计算架构。

The emergence of intelligent matter has sparked significant interest in next generation technologies. We report on the discovery of a reconfigurable magnetic multilayer domain structure in the van der Waals magnet CrSBr, exhibiting a unique combination of magnetic and optical properties. Applying an external magnetic field along the easy axis drives the hysteretic antiferromagnetic-to-ferromagnetic transition that is not universally binary, but instead develops through a cascade of intermediate magnetic configurations whose multiplicity and stability scale systematically with thickness. This material can be considered as a prototypical intelligent matter, capable of encoding, processing, and storing information through its tunable magnetic structure. The directly linked optical properties of CrSBr, modulated by the magnetic structure, provide a readout mechanism for the stored information compatible with modern information distribution using light. With its adaptive properties, CrSBr is an attractive candidate for neuromorphic circuitries, enabling the design of brain-inspired computing architectures that can learn and evolve in response to changing environments.

Algorithmic formulations of GPU programs provide a high-level alternative to device-specific code by expressing computations as compositions of well-defined parallel primitives (e.g., map, sort, reduce), rather than through handcrafted GPU kernels. In this work, we demonstrate that this paradigm can be extended to complex and challenging problems in computational physics: the simulation of granular flows and fluid-particle interactions.
  LEDDS, our open-source framework, performs fully coupled Lattice Boltzmann -- Discrete Element Method (LBM-DEM) simulations using only algorithmic primitives, and runs efficiently on single-GPU platforms. The entire workflow, including neighbor search, collision detection, and fluid-particle coupling, is expressed as a sequence of portable primitives. While the current implementation illustrates these principles primarily through algorithms from the C++ Standard Library, with selective use of Thrust primitives for performance, the underlying concept is compatible with any HPC environment offering a rich set of parallel algorithms and is therefore applicable across a wide range of modern GPU systems and future accelerators.
  LEDDS is validated through benchmarks spanning both DEM and LBM-DEM configurations, including sphere and ellipsoid collisions, wall friction tests, single-particle settling, Jeffery's orbits, and particle-laden shear flows. Despite its high level of abstraction, LEDDS achieves performances comparable to those of hand-tuned CUDA solvers, while maintaining portability and code clarity. These results show that high-performance LBM-DEM coupling can be achieved without sacrificing generality or readability, establishing LEDDS as a blueprint for portable multiphysics frameworks based on algorithmic primitives.

Within the framework of the canonical nearest-neighbor tight-binding model for spinless fermions, a family of two-dimensional bipartite hyperbolic lattices hosts massless Diraclike excitations near half-filling with the iconic vanishing density of states (DOS) near zero energy. We show that a collection of such ballistic quasiparticles remains stable against sufficiently weak pointlike charge impurities, a feature captured by the vanishing average [$ρ_{a}(0)$] and typical [$ρ_{t}(0)$] DOS at zero energy, computed by employing the kernel polynomial method in sufficiently large $\{ 10, 3\}$ hyperbolic lattices (Schläfli symbol) with more than $10^8$ and $10^5$ sites, respectively, with open boundary conditions. However, at moderate disorder the system enters a metallic state via a continuous quantum phase transition where both $ρ_{a}(0)$ and $ρ_{t}(0)$ become finite. With increasing strength of disorder, ultimately an Anderson insulator sets in, where only $ρ_{t}(0) \to 0$. The resulting phase diagram for dirty Dirac fermions living on a hyperbolic space solely stems from the background negative spatial curvature, as confirmed from the vanishing $ρ_{t}(0)$ for arbitrarily weak disorder on honeycomb lattices, fostering relativistic fermions on a flatland, as the thermodynamic limit is approached.

Equimolar ratio high-entropy perovskite ceramics (HEPCs) have attracted much attention due to their excellent magnetization intensity. To further enhance their magnetization intensities, (Ln0.2La0.2Nd0.2Sm0.2Eu0.2)MnO3 (Ln = Dy, Ho and Er, labeled as Ln-LNSEMO) HEPCs are designed based on the configuration entropy Sconfig, tolerance factor t, and mismatch degree. Single-phase HEPCs are synthesized by the solid-phase method in this work, in which the effects of the heavy rare-earth elements Dy, Ho and Er on the structure and magnetic properties of Ln-LNSEMO are systematically studied. The results show that all Ln-LNSEMO HEPCs exhibit high crystallinity and maintain excellent structural stability after sintering at 1250 degree centigrade for 16 h. Ln-LNSEMO HEPCs exhibit significant lattice distortion effects, with smooth surface morphology, clearly distinguishable grain boundaries, and irregular polygonal shapes. The three high-entropy ceramic samples exhibit hysteresis behavior at T = 5 K, with the Curie temperature TC decreasing as the radius of the introduced rare-earth ions decreases, while the saturation magnetization and coercivity increase accordingly. When the average ionic radius of A-site decreases, the interaction between their valence electrons and local electrons in the crystal increases, thereby enhancing the conversion of electrons to oriented magnetic moments under an external magnetic field. Thus, Er-LNSEMO HEPC shows a higher saturation magnetization strength (42.8 emu/g) and coercivity (2.09 kOe) than the other samples, which is attributed to the strong magnetic crystal anisotropy, larger lattice distortion (0.00652), smaller average grain size (440.49 plus or minus 22.02 nm), unit cell volume (229.432 A3) and A-site average ion radius (1.24 A) of its magnet. The Er-LNSEMO HEPC has potential applications in magnetic recording materials.

Porphyrins are organic molecules that exhibit excellent opto-electronics properties, making them suitable for a variety of applications. Nevertheless, their functionality strongly depends on the surface onto which they are deposited, and on the interaction between the molecules and the substrate itself, which often leads to an undesired alteration in their electronic properties. In this study, we use a phosphorus interlayer on a Cu(110) surface as a buffer layer for the electronic decoupling of Zinc-TetraPhenylPorphyrin (ZnTPP) molecules. Using a combination of complementary techniques, such as Near Edge X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (NEXAFS), X-ray and Ultraviolet Photoemission Spectroscopy (XPS, UPS) as well as Scanning Tunneling Spectroscopy (STS) techniques, it is shown how the charge transfer from the metal, responsible for quenching the ZnTPP lowest unoccupied molecular level (LUMO) levels, is effectively prevented by the presence of a phosphorus reconstruction in between.

Spintronic-based brain-inspired neuromorphic computing has recently attracted significant attention due to the exceptional properties of magnetic microstructures, including nanoscale dimensions, high stability, and low energy consumption. Despite these advantages, the practical integration of such microstructures into functional devices remains challenging. Fabrication processes are often complex and prone to stochastic effects, such as unwanted pinning and thermal-induced instabilities, which limit device reliability and scalability. Addressing these challenges is crucial for advancing spintronic neuromorphic architectures toward real-world applications. Thus, to reduce these effects we have proposed a design which is experimentally feasible and require less energy as compared to existing one. By engineering the system anisotropy into a sawtooth-type energy landscape, we have achieved free flow of these microstructures and successfully emulated integrate and fire (IF) function of biological neuron. Thus, proposed design presents an experimentally reliable and energy efficient external stimuli approach for tailoring magnetic microstructures dynamic behaviours, resulting in low energy consumption of 23.66 fJ per spike paving the way for the development of skyrmion-based futuristic neuromorphic computing device applications.

- **TL;DR**: 提出基于自旋团簇展开与自旋密度泛函理论的数据高效框架，通过拟合磁矩而非总能来构建经典自旋哈密顿量，显著减少所需DFT计算量。

We present a data-efficient framework for constructing general classical spin Hamiltonians from the spin-cluster expansion (SCE) combined with fully self-consistent noncollinear spin density functional theory (DFT). The key idea is to fit an SCE model to magnetic torques rather than to total energies. Because torques are site-resolved vectors, each configuration supplies many independent constraints, which makes the regression well conditioned and sharply reduces the number of DFT calculations needed, especially in large supercells. Applied to the B20-type chiral magnets ${\rm Mn}_{1-x}{\rm Fe}_{x}{\rm Ge}$ and ${\rm Fe}_{1-y}{\rm Co}_{y}{\rm Ge}$, the resulting models nonperturbatively extract the full pairwise exchange tensor (isotropic exchange, anisotropic symmetric exchange, and the Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya interaction) and predict helical spin period via a micromagnetic mapping. The composition trends and the divergence of the period near the chirality sign change are reproduced in line with experiments. Because the SCE framework is systematic, it also enables systematic analysis of interaction order; training on increasingly disordered spin configurations shows that the lowest-order model loses torque accuracy, whereas including higher-order interactions restores predictive power. These advances enable near-DFT-accurate spin models for finite-temperature magnetism and complex textures at modest data cost, while providing a systematic, extensible, and nonperturbative route to quantitative first-principles parameterization and predictive materials design. An open-source implementation is available as the Julia package, \textit{Magesty.jl}.

### Hall-like response from anisotropic Fermi surfaces

We demonstrate that an anisotropic and rotated Fermi surface can generate a finite Hall-like transverse response in electron transport, even in the absence of a magnetic field or Berry curvature. Using a two-dimensional continuum model, we show that broken $k_y \to -k_y$ symmetry inherent to anistropic band structures leads to a nonzero transverse conductivity. We construct a lattice model with direction-dependent nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor hoppings that faithfully reproduces the continuum dispersion and allows controlled rotation of the Fermi contour. Employing a multiterminal geometry and the Büttiker-probe method, we compute the resulting Hall voltage and establish its direct correspondence with the continuum transverse response. The effect increases with the degree of anisotropy and vanishes at rotation angles where mirror symmetry is restored. Unlike the quantum Hall effect, the Hall response predicted here is not quantized but varies continuously with the band-structure parameters. Our results provide a symmetry-based route to engineer Hall-like signals in low-symmetry materials without magnetic fields or topological effects.

Motivated by the notion that a preponderance of Coulomb interactions might lead to hydrodynamics, we carry out an ab initio calculation of the charge carrier transport properties of the electron-hole plasma of doped graphene. We include both the phonon and Coulomb interactions within a momentum and band resolved Boltzmann transport formalism. We find that, under suitable conditions, the strong Coulomb drag effect induces effects like negative conductivity and joint electron-hole hydrodynamics (bifluidity) in the plasma. We also identify the exclusive electron or hole hydrodynamics. We find that there is a strong violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law in the low doped regimes. Our work elucidates the roles of the microscopic scattering mechanisms that drive these hydrodynamic phenomena.

This work provides a theoretical exploration of the thermodynamic stability and magnetic behaviour of previously unknown ternary Li AgII F compounds. Convex-hull analysis shows that all predicted structures lie slightly above the LiF plus AgF2 decomposition line, indicating a natural tendency toward phase separation; nevertheless, their negative formation energies relative to AgF, LiF, and F2 or F suggest that alternative synthetic pathways may be feasible for these compounds. All studied structures show preference for antiferromagnetic ground state. Notably, the triclinic LiAgF3 type2 is predicted to exhibit an exceptionally large superexchange constant, J equal to minus 358 meV, within Ag2F7 dimers, placing it above the strongest known magnetic exchange interactions reported to date.

- **TL;DR**: 在工业300mm SOI晶圆上制造的天然Si-MOS量子点中，通过电子自旋共振实现了99.5%保真度的单量子比特控制，利用快速拉比频率和反馈协议克服低频噪声。

We demonstrate high-fidelity single qubit control in a natural Si-MOS quantum dot fabricated in an industrial 300 mm wafer process on a silicon on insulator (SOI) wafer using electron spin resonance. A relatively high optimal Rabi frequency of 5 MHz is achieved, dynamically decoupling the electron spin from its 29-Si environment. Tracking the qubit frequency reduces the impact of low frequency noise in the qubit frequency and improves the $T^{Rabi}$ from 7 to 11 $μ$s at a Rabi frequency of 5 MHz, resulting in Q-factors exceeding 50. Randomized benchmarking returns an average single gate control fidelity of 99.5 $\pm$ 0.3%. As a result of pulse-area calibration, this fidelity is limited by the Rabi Q-factor. These results show that a fast Rabi frequency, low charge noise, and a feedback protocol enable high fidelity in these Si-MOS devices, despite the low-frequency magnetic noise.

- **TL;DR**: 通过在忆阻器界面引入高离子迁移率材料（SrCoO3），显著扩展了可访问的电阻状态数量（从8到22），降低了操作电压，提高了耐久性，但牺牲了状态保持时间。该方法在MNIST数据集上实现了低于7%的分类错误率，并成功应用于HfOx基器件。

The great potential of memristive devices for real-world applications still relies on overcoming key technical challenges, including the need for a larger number of stable resistance states, faster switching speeds, lower SET/RESET voltages, improved endurance, and reduced variability. One material optimization strategy that has still been quite overlooked is interface engineering, specifically, tailoring the electrode/dielectric interface to modulate oxygen exchange. Here, we demonstrate that introducing materials with high ionic mobility can significantly expand the accessible oxygen concentration range within the dielectric layer, significantly broadening the memory window. Using SrTiO3-based memristive stacks, we integrated an ion-conducting SrCoO3 interfacial layer to facilitate oxygen transfer, increasing the number of distinguishable resistance states from 8 to 22. This modification also reduced the SET/RESET voltage by 50% and markedly improved device endurance, albeit with a trade-off of reduced state retention. To assess the practical implications of this trade-off, we trained a two-layer fully connected neural network using the experimental SrTiO3/SrCoO3 memristor characteristics on the MNIST handwritten digit dataset. Networks with hidden-layer sizes between 64 and 256 memristive elements achieved classification errors below 7%. The observed temporal drift means the functional state must be updated at intervals of less than 1 h to maintain reliable operation. Finally, we confirmed the transferability of this interface-engineering approach by applying it to HfOx-based devices, achieving a similarly enhanced memory window.

Discoveries over the past two decades have revealed the remarkable ability of quantum materials to emulate relativistic properties of the vacuum, from Dirac cones in graphene to the Weyl surface states of topological insulators. Yet the most elusive consequence of topology in quantum matter is the axionic $E\cdot B$ term in the electromagnetic response. Here we report a direct signature of axionic physics obtained through scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Although recent STM experiments using SmB$_6$ nanowires have been interpreted as evidence for spin-polarized currents arising from topological surface states, we show that the observed spin polarization instead originates from axionic electrodynamics. Our analysis reveals a striking voltage-induced magnetization: extremely small voltages ($\sim$ 30 meV) generate tip moments of order 0.1 $μ_B$ that reverse sign with the applied bias. The magnitude, tunability, and reversibility of this signal are consistent with an axionic $E \cdot B$ coupling, and fully account for the magnetic component of the tip density of states, ruling out static magnetism. Millivolt-scale control of spin polarization in a tunnel junction provides a new route for probing axionic electrodynamics and opens avenues for future STM and spintronics applications.

Discovering nonlinear optical (NLO) materials with strong shift current response, particularly in the infrared (IR) regime, is essential for next-generation optoelectronics yet remains highly challenging in both experiments and theory, which still largely relies on case by case studies. Here, we employ a high-throughput screening strategy, applying a multi-step filter to the Materials Project database (&gt;154,000 materials), which yielded 2,519 candidate materials for detailed first-principle evaluation. From these calculations, we identify 32 NLO materials with strong shift current response ($σ$ &gt; 100 $μA/V^2$). Our work reveals that layered structures with $C_{3v}$ symmetry and heavy $p$-block elements (e.g. Te, Sb) exhibit apparent superiority in enhancing shift current. More importantly, 9 of these compounds show shift current response peaks in the IR region, with the strongest reaching 616 $μA/V^2$, holding significant application potential in fields such as IR photodetection, sensing, and energy harvesting. Beyond identifying promising candidates, this work establishes a comprehensive and high-quality first-principles dataset for NLO response, providing a solid foundation for future AI-driven screening and accelerated discovery of high-performance NLO materials, as demonstrated by a prototype machine-learning application.

- **TL;DR**: 提出多模超导电感架构，支持高达2GHz的多频段射频反射测量，用于量子点隧穿率提取和自旋单次读取，实现98%保真度

We introduce a multimode superconducting inductor architecture that enables radio-frequency reflectometry at multiple discrete frequencies up to 2 GHz, addressing limitations of conventional single-mode designs. The spiral inductor's distributed inter-turn capacitance yields distinct resonant modes with varied impedance-matching conditions. By probing a quantum dot across several modes, we extract tunneling rates over a broad frequency range and identify signatures of nearby charge defects. Using one of the higher-order modes, we demonstrate single-shot spin readout via a radio-frequency single-electron transistor (RF-SET), achieving singlet-triplet readout with an integration time of 8 us and a readout fidelity of 98%. These results establish multimode inductance as a scalable and flexible component for fast spin-qubit readout and device-quality characterization.

Precise modeling and understanding of heat transport in the superionic phase are of great interest. Although simulations combining Green-Kubo (GK) molecular dynamics with machine-learned potentials (MLPs) stand as a promising approach, substantial challenges remain due to the crucial impact of atomic diffusion. Here, we first show that the thermal conductivity ($κ$) of superionic materials calculated via conventional GK integral of the energy flux varies notably with the MLP model. Subsequently, we highlight that reliable, model-independent $κ$ values can be obtained by applying Onsager's reciprocal relations to correctly capture the coupled heat and mass transport. Remarkably, an anomalously invariant $κ$ is observed over a wide temperature range, distinct from the characteristic trends in traditional crystals and glasses. Finally, we illustrate that conventional $κ$ decompositions into kinetic, potential, and cross terms suffer from ambiguities in the physical interpretation, despite their mathematical rigor.

We present a first-principles study of the nonlinear optical properties of sliding ferroelectric bilayers based on MoSe$_2$ and Janus MoSSe. Two Janus configurations are considered: i) one bilayer where the two intralayer polarizations caused by Janus chemical asymmetry cancel each other out, yielding photocurrent spectra comparable to pristine MoSe$_2$ bilayers; ii) another bilayer where the intralayer polarizations add up, for which the photoresponses are strongly enhanced. Our results show that photocurrent generation in the polar Janus structures is predominantly governed by vertical chemical asymmetry, with limited dependence on the sliding direction. These findings highlight complementary design strategies: interlayer sliding enables sensitivity to external tuning, while the Janus intralayer polarization enhances photoresponses in the visible range. The interplay between composition and stacking therefore provides a versatile platform for tailoring light-matter interactions in 2D ferroelectric materials.

- **TL;DR**: 设计Ag掺杂CuO-AgCl-g-C3N4异质结构，通过低功率UV驱动的协同光-Fenton机制实现快速亚甲基蓝降解

An Ag-doped CuO-AgCl-g-C3N4 heterostructure has been designed to achieve rapid Methylene Blue (MB) degradation through a synergistic photo-Fenton mechanism driven by low-power UV illumination. The composite integrates narrow-bandgap CuO, plasmonic Ag/AgCl, and visible-responsive g-C3N4 into a dual Z-scheme configuration that promotes efficient interfacial charge transfer while preserving strong redox potentials. Diffuse reflectance UV-Vis spectra ascertained the bandgap positions of the composite corresponding to those of its constituents: 2.9 eV (g-C3N4) and 1.42 eV (Ag-doped CuO-AgCl), indicating enhanced absorption and efficient charge carrier generation. BET analysis confirmed the presence of mesoporosity and revealed an effective surface area, ensuring the availability of abundant adsorption and reaction sites. A commercial 11 W UV irradiation was used for the photocatalytic test. Almost complete degradation of MB occurred within 10 min, following pseudo-first-order kinetics with a high apparent rate constant of 0.45/min. The remarkable activity arises from the synergistic interplay of Fenton-like redox cycling and efficient photoinduced charge carrier generation and separation. In addition, it has been demonstrated that intentionally incorporated AgCl plays an active role as a plasmonic-semiconducting interface, strengthening charge separation and catalyst stability under neutral conditions, rather than acting as a passive chloride byproduct. Overall, by linking defect engineering, heterojunction design, and photo-Fenton synergy, this study establishes a low-power, catalytic platform offering a viable pathway towards sustainable dye wastewater remediation.

### Interband and kinetic corrections to the electronic Boltzmann transport equation

Interband effects such as coherence/tunneling have recently been shown to give an important contribution to the charge and heat transport properties under certain conditions. These can be captured by adding corrective terms to the semiclassical Boltzmann transport equation. In recent derivations of this type of transport equations that are based on the density matrix formalism, there remain, however, certain omissions. These derivations also rely on a particular type of relaxation time approximation and a band-diagonal form of the interaction self-energies. In this work we derive the interband terms of the electronic Boltzmann transport equation starting from the Keldysh formulation of the quantum kinetic equation and considering the band non-diagonality of the electron-impurity and electron-phonon self-energies. We introduce a minimally modified Kadanoff-Baym Ansatz, and find a quantum-corrected, matrix Boltzmann transport equation that is well beyond the current state of the art theory. We show that the occupations and coherences are interdependent, and that the kinetic corrections due to the included interactions cannot, in general, be ignored. This work clarifies the various approximations that must be introduced in an ab initio derivation of Boltzmann-like equations and finds a new matrix Boltzmann transport equation that is suitable for parameters-free numerical implementations.

- **TL;DR**: 钠硼硅化物笼形化合物在高压下表现出独特的等结构相变，仅I型材料在13GPa时发生体积塌缩，这是由硅原子向阳离子位点扩散引起的，首次实验验证了理论预测。

Electronic properties of silicon-based clathrates can be tuned by boron incorporation into the silicon cage network. Sodium borosilicides clathrate outstands with uncommon stoichiometry and expected metallic properties, in contrast to other alcali metal semiconductive Zintl borosilicides. In this study, we report an experimental investigation of the high-pressure behavior of type-I and type-VIII sodium borosilicide clathrates. An isostructural phase transition, marked by an abrupt volume collapse at 13 GPa, is observed exclusively in type-I sodium borosilicide clathrates. This transition is attributed to the pressure-induced diffusion of silicon atoms into cationic sites. This mechanism provides the first experimental validation of a transition predicted theoretically for this class of materials. Isostructural phase transitions were only observed in type-I borosilicide. In contrast, the type-VIII borosilicide phase exhibits conventional elastic compression. The metallic character was established using reflectance spectroscopy over a wide energy range, in good agreement with crystallographic data on the boron content.

We compute valley splittings in Si/SiGe superlattices using ab initio density functional theory (DFT). This first-principle approach is expected to provide an excellent description of interfaces, strains, and atomistic disorder without empirically fitted parameters. We benchmark atomistic tight- binding (TB) and the ``$2k_0$'' theory within the effective mass (EM) approximation against DFT. We show that DFT supports the main conclusions of the 2$k_0$ theory, but reveals some limitations of semi-empirical methods such as the EM and TB, in particular about the description of atomistic disorder. The DFT calculations also highlight the effects of strong valley-orbit mixing at large valley splittings. Nevertheless, TB and the 2$k_0$ theory shall provide reasonable valley splitting statistics in many heterostructures of interest for spin qubit devices.

Thermal plasma has emerged as an effective approach for producing carbon nanostructures without the need for specific catalysts nor substrates. While efforts have focused on the effect of process parameters such as reaction pressure, input power or carbon source, the intricate role and relationship with plasma characteristics like density and temperature are often overlooked due to the complexity of the environment. This study addresses this gap by establishing a correlation between process parameters, plasma characteristics, and product morphology, essential for controlling the growth of carbon nanostructures. We explored the impact of carbon precursor type (CH4 and C2H2), hydrogen, pressure, and flow rate on nanostructure formation. Using in situ optical emission spectroscopy (OES), we mapped the distribution of both temperature and dicarbon molecule (C2) density within the plasma jet. We demonstrate that the growth of low-density nanostructures, such as carbon nanohorns (CNHs), is favoured at dilute C2 local densities and high temperatures, while denser nanostructures, such as onion-like polyhedral graphitic nanocapsules (GNCs), are favoured at higher C2 densities and lower temperatures. The carbon density can be controlled by the flow rate and the pressure, which in turn significantly influence the nanostructure morphology, evolving from graphene nanoflakes (GNFs) to GNCs as either parameter increases. Increasing the H/C ratio from 1 to 8 resulted in a morphological transition from CNHs to GNFs. During the synthesis, the plasma jet temperature surpassed 3,000 K, with crystalline growth occurring 50 to 100 mm below the nozzle.

### In search of the electron-phonon contribution to total energy

The total energy is a fundamental characteristic of solids, molecules, and nanostructures. In most first-principles calculations of the total energy, the nuclear kinetic operator is decoupled from the many-body electronic Hamiltonian and the dynamics of the nuclei is reintroduced afterwards. This two-step procedure introduced by Born and Oppenheimer (BO) is approximate. Energies beyond the electronic and vibrational (or phononic) main contributions might be relevant when small energy differences are important, such as when predicting stable polymorphs or describing magnetic energy landscape. We clarify the different flavors of BO decoupling and give an exact formulation for the total energy in the basis of BO electronic wavefunctions. Then, we list contributions, beyond the main ones, that appear in a perturbative expansion in powers of $M_0^{-1/4}$, where $M_0$ is a typical nuclear mass, up to sixth order. Some of these might be grouped and denoted the electron-phonon contribution to total energy, $E^{\textrm{elph}}$, that first appears at fourth order. The electronic inertial mass contributes at sixth order. We clarify that the sum of the Allen-Heine-Cardona zero-point renormalization of eigenvalues over occupied states is not the electron-phonon contribution to the total energy but a part of the phononic contribution. The computation of the lowest-order $E^{\textrm{elph}}$ is implemented and shown to be small but non-negligible (3.8 meV per atom) in the case of diamond and its hexagonal polymorph. We also estimate the electronic inertial mass contribution and confirm the size-consistency of all computed terms.

An electric bias can shift the Fermi level along the Dirac cone of a topological insulator and modify its charge transport, but tuning the electronic states and spin-orbit interaction (SOI) without destroying the surface topology is challenging. Here, we show that thin film Bi2Se3/n-p (p-n) molecular diodes form ordered interfaces where charge transfer and orbital re-hybridisation result in a decrease (increase) of the carrier density and improved mobility. In Bi2Se3 the spin-orbit lifetime, t_so, is 0.13 ps, which is comparable to the strongest spin-orbit materials. This lifetime drops further to 0.06 ps (0.09 ps) with the addition of p-n (n-p) molecular diodes, at the limit of measurable values. This strengthened spin-orbit interaction occurs even though molecules are made of light elements and increase the mean free path of the charge carriers by almost 50%, indicating changes to the Berry curvature and/or Rashba splitting around the hybridisation points. Raman spectroscopy gives evidence that the coupling effect may be controlled by optical irradiation, opening a pathway towards the design of heavy-light element hybrids with optically tunable quantum transport.

### A meta-GGA perspective on the altermagnetism of RuO2

The metallic oxide RuO$_2$ hosts a fascinating edge case of magnetism: while nonmagnetic in ideal bulk material, density functional theory (DFT) predicts an altermagnetic ground state within the DFT$+U$ method. The magnetic state of strained or doped thin films remains controversial, but evidence for a nontrivial magnetic state is ample. Here, I study the altermagnetic ground state of RuO$_2$ on a higher rung of Jacob's ladder of density functional approximations, the meta-GGA level including the kinetic energy density and the density Laplacian. While the workhorse functional of solid-state physics is a generalized gradient approximation (GGA), the modern r$^2$SCAN-L functional has been established as a general-purpose functional which can replace GGA, while systematically improving solid-state properties without introducing spurious errors like erroneous magnetic ground states. Comparison of LSDA+U, GGA+U, and meta-GGA+U results on RuO$_2$ shows systematic enhancement of the exchange interaction, leading to a reduction of the onset value of the Hubbard $U$ parameter at different levels of density functional approximation. However, the magnetic ground state, studied at the experimental lattice constants, remains nonmagnetic with r$^2$SCAN-L. I demonstrate that altermagnetism is easily formed upon lattice expansion, hole doping, and uniaxial strain on the c-axis. The r$^2$SCAN-L calculations set conservative thresholds for distortions and doping levels for the onset of altermagnetism in a parameter-free framework.
