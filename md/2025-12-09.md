### Chern Dartboard Superconductors

- **TL;DR**: 研究粒子-空穴对称性与子布里渊区拓扑的相互作用，通过将Chern dartboard绝缘体与超导体耦合，构建Chern dartboard超导体，探索不同镜像对称性下的拓扑相分类。

We investigate the interplay of particle-hole symmetry and sub-Brillouin zone (sBZ) topology by coupling a so-called Chern dartboard insulator (CDI) to a superconductor (SC) via the proximity effect. We dub the hybrid system, and equivalent intrinsically superconducting phases, a \emph{Chern dartboard superconductor} (CDSC). We show that a CDSC can have nontrivial sBZ topology if it arises from a CDI that has an even number of mirror symmetries $n$. On the other hand, particle-hole symmetry constrains a CDSC that arises from an odd-$n$ CDI to have trivial sBZ topology. However, we can circumvent this constraint for $n=1$ by inducing an FFLO-type pairing or shifting the CDI in momentum space, converting the mirror symmetry to a momentum-space nonsymmorphic mirror symmetry. With a superconducting pairing that preserves the (nonsymmorphic) mirror symmetries, even-$n$ CDIs and the shifted $n=1$ CDI can realize the minimal spinless phase that has a trivial total Chern number and nontrivial reduced Chern numbers. With a pairing that breaks the mirror symmetries, the hybrid system can realize phases that have nontrivial total and reduced Chern numbers, expanding the classification of phases that have sub-Brillouin zone (sBZ) topology. We also predict that some types of $n=2$ CDSCs inherit the quantized crystalline response of the $n=2$ CDI, providing experimentalists with a well-defined way to probe the CDSC. Our work motivates further exploration of sBZ topology, bulk topology, and quantized response.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文提出在多带超导体中，通过相反色散能带间的带间库珀配对，可以自然地形成配对密度波（PDW）态，无需额外调制机制。

Pair density waves (PDW) are novel forms of superconducting states that exhibit periodically modulated pairing. A remaining challenge is to elucidate how intrinsic PDW order can emerge robustly in strongly correlated electrons. Here we propose that PDW is prone to form in strongly coupled multiband superconductors simply with interband Cooper pairing between electrons from oppositely dispersing bands. This scenario is heuristically motivated by the observation that uniform interband pairing in such systems would exhibit negative superfluid weight -- a signature of an instability towards pairing modulation, implying that PDW emerges naturally in the true ground state. Using large-scale density-matrix-renormalization-group calculations with finite-size scaling analysis, we demonstrate this PDW mechanism in a minimal model with strong interband attractions. Our simulations reveal power-law superconducting correlations characterized by incommensurate modulations. The exponent $K_{sc}$ of the power-law PDW correlation decreases systematically with increasing ladder width, confirming a genuine long-range PDW order in the 2D limit. Our study therefore demonstrates a promising route to robust PDW states in multiband systems.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文开发了朗道理论来解释FeTe₀.₅₅Se₀.₄₅中观察到的对密度调制现象，认为这是由表面缺乏滑移对称性导致的混合序参量态。

Motivated by recent scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) experiments reporting a pair-density modulation (PDM) in FeTe$_{0.55}$Se$_{0.45}$, we develop a Landau theory to elucidate the physical origin of this phenomenon. We analyze the PDM in terms of the screw symmetry of the single layer, interpreting it as a hybridized state of two order parameters of opposite glide and screw parity. Discussing the absence of PDM in the bulk where both glide and screw symmetry are present, we argue that the absence of glide symmetry on the surface allows nematic order to selectively stabilize the PDM in thin flakes. Finally, we discuss the symmetry constraints on the microscopic pairing mechanism, pointing out the opposite glide and screw parities of the order parameters favor a site, rather than a bond-based paring mechanism. This suggests that pairing in iron-based superconductors may be local to the iron atoms, possibly driven by Hunds coupling.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文报道了化学计量比W2N薄膜的超导特性，展示了8.5T的极高上临界磁场，这在二元过渡金属氮化物中不常见，具有重要的技术应用价值。

Transition Metal Nitrides are a versatile class of materials, combining chemical robustness, high hardness, and superconducting behaviour with critical temperatures between 2 to 10 K. While several binary TMNs have been explored, superconductivity in stoichiometric W2N has remained largely unexplored. Here, we report on superconducting thin films of stoichiometric W2N, demonstrating a distinctly high upper critical field of 8.5 T, uncommon among binary TMNs. This robust superconducting response under high magnetic fields highlights the technological relevance of W2N for integrated quantum and cryogenic electronic platforms. Overall, these results position stoichiometric W2N as a promising addition to the TMN superconducting landscape, opening new avenues for functional materials design based on chemically stable and mechanically resilient nitrides.

### Comparative Analysis of Autonomous and Systematic Control Strategies for Hole-Doped Hubbard Clusters: Reinforcement Learning versus Physics-Guided Design

- **TL;DR**: 该论文比较了两种控制量子点阵列中电子关联的方法：物理引导的系统设计与自主深度强化学习，后者在优化复杂量子系统方面表现出显著优势。

Engineering electron correlations in quantum dot arrays demands navigation of high-dimensional, non-convex parameter spaces where hole doping fundamentally alters the physics. We present a comparative study of two control paradigms for the one-hole, half-filled Hubbard model: (i) systematic physics-guided design and (ii) autonomous deep reinforcement learning with geometry-aware neural architectures. While systematic analysis reveals key design principles, such as field-induced localization for trapping the mobile hole, it becomes computationally intractable for optimization. We show that an autonomous RL agent, benchmarked across five 3D lattices from tetrahedron to FCC, achieves human-competitive accuracy (R^2 &gt; 0.97) and 95.5 percent success on held-out tasks. The agent is 3-4 orders of magnitude more sample-efficient than grid search and outperforms other black-box optimization methods. Transfer learning yields 91 percent few-shot generalization to unseen geometries. This work establishes autonomous RL as a viable and highly efficient framework for rapid optimization and non-obvious strategy discovery in complex quantum systems.

- **TL;DR**: 提出通用有向树过程图表示法，将非结构化文本、分子结构和数值测量统一为机器可读格式，通过多模态图神经网络学习，实现跨领域知识迁移

Experimental validation of chemical processes is slow and costly, limiting exploration in materials discovery. Machine learning can prioritize promising candidates, but existing data in patents and literature is heterogeneous and difficult to use. We introduce a universal directed-tree process-graph representation that unifies unstructured text, molecular structures, and numeric measurements into a single machine-readable format. To learn from this structured data, we developed a multi-modal graph neural network with a property-conditioned attention mechanism. Trained on approximately 700,000 process graphs from nearly 9,000 diverse documents, our model learns semantically rich embeddings that generalize across domains. When fine-tuned on compact, domain-specific datasets, the pretrained model achieves strong performance, demonstrating that universal process representations learned at scale transfer effectively to specialized prediction tasks with minimal additional data.

### Physics Enhanced Deep Surrogates for the Phonon Boltzmann Transport Equation

- **TL;DR**: 提出PEDS方法，结合可微分傅里叶求解器和神经网络，通过物理增强的深度学习代理模型，大幅降低纳米尺度热材料设计所需的高保真模拟数据量。

Designing materials with controlled heat flow at the nano-scale is central to advances in microelectronics, thermoelectrics, and energy-conversion technologies. At these scales, phonon transport follows the Boltzmann Transport Equation (BTE), which captures non-diffusive (ballistic) effects but is too costly to solve repeatedly in inverse-design loops. Existing surrogate approaches trade speed for accuracy: fast macroscopic solvers can overestimate conductivities by hundreds of percent, while recent data-driven operator learners often require thousands of high-fidelity simulations. This creates a need for a fast, data-efficient surrogate that remains reliable across ballistic and diffusive regimes. We introduce a Physics-Enhanced Deep Surrogate (PEDS) that combines a differentiable Fourier solver with a neural generator and couples it with uncertainty-driven active learning. The Fourier solver acts as a physical inductive bias, while the network learns geometry-dependent corrections and a mixing coefficient that interpolates between macroscopic and nano-scale behavior. PEDS reduces training-data requirements by up to 70% compared with purely data-driven baselines, achieves roughly 5% fractional error with only 300 high-fidelity BTE simulations, and enables efficient design of porous geometries spanning 12-85 W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$ with average design errors of 4%. The learned mixing parameter recovers the ballistic-diffusive transition and improves out of distribution robustness. These results show that embedding simple, differentiable low-fidelity physics can dramatically increase surrogate data-efficiency and interpretability, making repeated PDE-constrained optimization practical for nano-scale thermal-materials design.

### Nonequilibrium Exchange Nonlinear Hall Effect

- **TL;DR**: 该论文提出非平衡交换相互作用能产生不同于平衡基态的集体量子几何，表现为具有竞争力的交换诱导非线性霍尔效应。

Quantum geometric electronic responses are often viewed through a non-interacting lens: independent quasiparticles accumulate Berry phases as they move through a static crystal and background potential. Here we argue that the combined action of electron-electron interactions and an out-of-equilibrium many-body state can produce striking departures from this familiar picture. We demonstrate how nonequilibrium exchange interactions produce a nonequilibrium collective quantum geometry distinct from that of its equilibrium ground state. We find this manifests as an exchange induced nonlinear Hall effect with nonlinear Hall current signals competitive with that of well-known non-interacting mechanisms. This highlights the critical role electron interactions and nonequilibrium states can play in the nonlinear response of quantum matter.

### Thermodynamic description of world GDP distribution over countries

- **TL;DR**: 该研究将经典场的瑞利-金斯热化概念应用于世界各国GDP分布分析，发现GDP分布中存在类似光学纤维中的凝聚现象，这解释了贫困和寡头阶段的出现。

We apply the concept of Rayleigh-Jeans thermalization of classical fields for a description of the world Gross Domestic Product (GDP) distribution over countries. The thermalization appears due to a variety of interactions between countries with conservation of two integrals being total GDP and probability (norm). In such a case there is an emergence of Rayleigh-Jeans condensation at states with low GDP. This phenomenon has been studied theoretically and experimentally in multimode optical fibers and we argue that it is at the origin of emergence of poverty and oligarchic phases for GDP of countries. A similar phenomenon has been discussed recently in the framework of the Wealth Thermalization Hypothesis to explain the high inequality of wealth distribution in human society and companies at Stock Exchange markets. We show that the Rayleigh-Jeans thermalization well describes the GDP distribution during the last 50 years.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究使用LAMMPS进行碳原子在铜(111)晶面上的沉积模拟，优化了建模方法，分析了不同温度下的沉积速率和质量，修正了先前研究中系统压力过高导致模拟崩溃的问题，并提供了势函数选择参考表。

We learned the atomic deposition simulation of LAMMPS independently, referenced and optimized the modeling ideas of several papers, used the (1 1 1) crystalline surface of Cu atoms as a substrate, deposited C atoms produced by methane cleavage to obtain graphene flakes, and analyzed the deposition rate and deposition quality at three temperatures, obtaining conclusions consistent with the process flow. We found that there were obvious problems in previous papers. After a certain period, the overall system pressure became excessively high, causing simulation crashes and preventing analysis of subsequent results. In addition, understanding of potential function selection was incomplete. Therefore, after correcting these issues, a simulation system with relatively stable pressure was constructed. In addition to the result analysis, a potential-function selection table is provided, with some parameters taken from prior experimental calculations and others obtained via DFT calculations.

### Optical conductivity of a dirty current-carrying superconductor

- **TL;DR**: 本文建立了含直流超电流的脏超导体光学电导率的微观理论，揭示了超电流如何改变光学响应并直接观测Schmid-Higgs模式。

We develop a full microscopic theory for the optical conductivity, $σ(ω)$, of a dirty current-carrying superconductor. Within the Keldysh sigma model formalism, we obtain the general analytical expression for $σ(ω)$, applicable for arbitrary frequency $ω$, temperature $T$, and dc supercurrent $I$. In addition to altering the usual Mattis-Bardeen conductivity, $σ_1(ω)$, a finite supercurrent introduces two new contributions: $σ_2^\text{qp}(ω)$ from quasiparticle redistribution and $σ_2^\text{SH}(ω)$ from the amplitude (Schmid-Higgs) mode excitation by the ac field. We investigate, both analytically and numerically, the main features of the optical conductivity in the presence of a dc supercurrent. They include a peak in $\text{Re}\,σ(ω)$ above the optical gap and a sign change of $\text{Im}\,σ(ω)$, with both effects becoming more pronounced at higher $I$ and lower $T$. We also elucidate the role of inelastic relaxation, which governs the low-frequency response, leading to a giant microwave absorption and a suppression of the apparent superfluid density at the critical current. The optical conductivity measurement of a superconductor biased by a finite dc supercurrent enables the direct observation of the Schmid-Higgs mode via transport measurements.

- **TL;DR**: 通过高场超声测量发现LaTIn5系列化合物中存在隐藏的小费米面，其形成与过渡金属的3d电子有关

We performed high-field ultrasonic measurements on La$T$In$_5$ ($T$ = Co, Rh, Ir) to reveal the origin of the small Fermi surface that was recently observed in LaRhIn$_5$ with an oscillation frequency of 6.8 T. We observed quantum oscillations originating from this Fermi surface in LaRhIn$_5$. In addition, we revealed that LaCoIn$_5$ and LaIrIn$_5$ exhibit quantum osciilations with frequencies below 100 T, indicating hidden Fermi surfaces in these compounds. Furthermore, Co-substituted LaRhIn$_5$ exhibited quantum oscillations with a frequency of 10 T. Our results suggest that the small Fermi surface originates from bulk properties and that $3d$ electrons of the transition metal contribute to its formation.

- **TL;DR**: 提出混合量子-经典框架，结合量子力学精修配体电荷和量子变分求解器，实现高效准确的蛋白质-配体结合自由能预测

Accurately predicting protein-ligand binding free energies (BFEs) remains a central challenge in drug discovery, particularly because the most reliable methods, such as free energy perturbation (FEP), are computationally intensive and difficult to scale. Here, we introduce a hybrid quantum-classical framework that combines Mining Minima sampling with quantum mechanically refined ligand partial charges, QM/MM interaction evaluation, and variational quantum eigensolver (VQE)-based electronic energy correction. This design enables explicit treatment of polarization, charge redistribution, and electronic correlation effects that are often underestimated in purely classical scoring schemes, while retaining computational efficiency. Across 23 protein targets and 543 ligands, the method achieves a mean absolute error of about 1.10 kcal/mol with strong rank-order fidelity (Pearson R = 0.75, Spearman rho = 0.76, Kendall tau = 0.57), consistent with the performance of contemporary FEP protocols. Notably, the workflow requires only about 25 minutes per ligand on standard compute resources, resulting in an approximate 20-fold reduction in computational cost relative to alchemical free energy approaches. This level of accuracy and efficiency makes the method well-suited for high-throughput lead optimization and iterative design cycles in pharmaceutical discovery. The framework also provides a natural foundation for future integration with machine learning models to enable predictive, large-scale, and adaptive screening strategies.

### MaxwellLink: A unified framework for self-consistent light-matter simulations

- **TL;DR**: MaxwellLink是一个开源Python框架，用于大规模并行、自洽地模拟电磁场与异质分子系统的相互作用，通过TCP/UNIX套接字接口耦合电磁求解器和分子动力学驱动程序。

A major challenge in light-matter simulations is bridging the disparate time and length scales of electrodynamics and molecular dynamics. Current computational approaches often rely on heuristic approximations of either the electromagnetic (EM) or material component, hindering the exploration of complex light-matter systems. Herein, MaxwellLink -- a modular, open-source Python framework -- is developed for the massively parallel, self-consistent propagation of classical EM fields interacting with a large heterogeneous molecular ensemble. The package utilizes a robust TCP/UNIX socket interface to couple EM solvers with a wide range of external molecular drivers. This decoupled architecture allows users to seamlessly switch between levels of theory of either the EM solver or molecules without modifying the counterpart. Crucially, MaxwellLink supports EM solvers spanning from single-mode cavities to full-feature three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) engines, and molecules described by multilevel open quantum systems, force-field and first-principles molecular dynamics, and nonadiabatic real-time Ehrenfest dynamics. Benefiting from the socket-based design, the EM engine and molecular drivers scale independently across multiple high-performance computing (HPC) nodes, facilitating large-scale simulations previously inaccessible to existing numerical schemes. The versatility and accuracy of this code are demonstrated through applications including superradiance, radiative energy transfer, vibrational strong coupling in Bragg resonators, and plasmonic heating of molecular gases. By providing a unified, extensible engine, MaxwellLink potentially offers a powerful platform for exploring emerging phenomena across the research fronts of spectroscopy, quantum optics, plasmonics, and polaritonics.

### Modeling and Optimization of Two-Terminal Spin-Orbit-Torque MRAM

- **TL;DR**: 该论文对两端自旋轨道转矩磁随机存取存储器（2T-SOT-MRAM）进行物理建模和基准测试，发现具有面外转矩的新型SOT材料可显著降低写入能耗，特别是器件尺寸缩小至30或20nm时。

This paper presents physical modeling and benchmarking for two-terminal spin-orbit torque magnetic random-access memory (2T-SOT-MRAM). The results indicate that the common SOT materials that provide only in-plane torque can provide little to no improvement over spin-transfer-torque (STT) MRAM in terms of write energy. However, emerging SOT materials that provide out-of-plane torques with efficiencies as small as 0.1 can result in significant improvements in the write energy for such 2-terminal devices, especially when the magnet lateral dimensions are scaled down to 30 or 20 nm. Additionally, a novel 2T-SOT MRAM device is proposed that can increase the path electrons pass through the SOT layer; hence, increasing the generated spin current and the energy efficiency of the device. Our benchmarking results indicate that an out-of-plane SOT efficiency of 0.051 for 20nm wide devices can result in write energies approaching SRAM at the 7nm technology node.

Exact solutions are obtained and the combined action of the applied field, dissipation and memory are discussed.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究开发了一种基于机器学习的方法，使用半经验计算和电荷转移描述符来准确预测TADF发射体的单重态-三重态能隙，并通过主动学习减少数据需求，应用于近红外探针、光催化敏化剂和光电检测材料。

Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence (TADF) emitters must satisfy two competing requirements: small singlet-triplet energy gaps for thermal upconversion and sufficient spin-orbit coupling for fast reverse intersystem crossing. Predicting these properties accurately demands expensive calculations. We address this using a validated semi-empirical protocol (GFN2-xTB geometries, sTDA/sTD-DFT-xTB excited states) on 747 molecules, combined with charge-transfer descriptors from Natural Transition Orbital analysis. The hole-electron spatial overlap She emerges as a key predictor, accounting for 21% of feature importance for the triplet state alone. Our best model (Support Vector Regression) reaches MAE = 0.024 eV and R2 = 0.96 for $ΔE_{ST}$. Active learning reduces the data needed to reach target accuracy by approximately 25% compared to random sampling. Three application domains are explored: NIR-emitting probes for bioimaging, photocatalytic sensitizers, and fast-response materials for photodetection.

- **TL;DR**: 开发了一种使用ECR氮等离子体源制备Nb/Al-AlN/Nb超导隧道结的新工艺，能够生长均匀的隧道势垒，实现低至约3 Ω·μm²的RnA值，并保持优异的质量

We report a Nb/Al-AlN /Nb superconducting tunnel junction process in which the AlN barrier is formed by plasma nitridation using a compact microwave electron-cyclotron-resonance (ECR) nitrogen plasma source integrated into a standard sputter cluster. This enables growth of uniform tunnel barriers across a broad range of specific resistances, with $R_n A$ down to $\approx 3,Ω,μ\mathrm{m}^2$. Junctions maintain excellent quality, exhibiting $R_j/R_n \ge 25$ at the highest barrier transparencies. We characterize resistivity, specific capacitance, and the evolution of junction parameters under room-temperature aging and thermal annealing. A consistent calibration of the junction specific capacitance $C_s$ versus $R_n A$ is established and independently validated by the performance of demonstrator SIS mixers designed using the extracted $C_s$.

Cr$_{1+x}$Te$_2$ is a self-intercalated vdW system that is of current interest for its room-temperature FM phases and tunable topological properties. Early NPD measurements on the monoclinic phase Cr$_3$Te$_4$ ($x=0.5$) presented evidence for competing FM and AFM phases. Here we apply neutron diffraction to a single crystal of Cr$_{3+δ}$Te$_4$ with $δ=-0.10$ and discover that it consists of two distinct monoclinic phases, one with FM order below $T_{\rm C} \approx 321$ K and another that develops AFM order below $T_{\rm N} \approx 86$ K. In contrast, we find that a crystal with $δ=-0.26$ exhibits only FM order. The single-crystal analysis is complemented by results obtained with NPD, XPD, and TEM measurements on the $δ=-0.10$ composition. From observations of spontaneous magnetostriction of opposite sign at $T_{\rm C}$ and $T_{\rm N}$, along with the TEM evidence for both monoclinic phases in a single thin ($\approx$ 100 nm) grain, we conclude that the two phases must have a fine-grained ($\lesssim$ 100 nm) intergrowth character, as might occur from high-temperature spinodal decomposition during the growth process. Calculations of the relaxed lattice structures for the FM and AFM phases with DFT provide a rationalization of the observed spontaneous magnetostrictions. Correlations between the magnitude and orientation of the magnetic moments with lattice parameter variation demonstrate that the magnetic orders are sensitive to strain, thus explaining why magnetic ordering temperatures and anisotropies can be different between bulk and thin-film samples, when the latter are subject to epitaxial strain. Our results point to the need to investigate the supposed coexistence FM and AFM phases reported elsewhere in the Cr$_{1+x}$Te$_2$ system, such as in the Cr$_5$Te$_8$ phase ($x=0.25$).

- **TL;DR**: 论文重新审视了F12方法中需要弥散基函数的原因，开发了双基组CCSD方法，发现弥散基函数对传统相关能描述至关重要，而在F12计算中由于F12项大幅降低基组误差，使得缺乏弥散基函数的误差变得显著。

An accurate description of electron correlation energies in molecules requires either basis set extrapolation or the use of explicitly-correlated wave functions that address the deficiencies of standard determinantal expansions at short interelectronic distances. Practical and robust explicitly-correlated F12 methods require the use of standard or specialized atomic orbital (AO) basis sets that include diffuse AOs, even for neutral species. Although modern reduced-scaling formulations of explicitly-correlated many-body methods have become routinely applicable to molecules with hundreds of atoms, application of F12 methods to large molecular systems can be severely hampered due to the onset of ill-conditioning spurred by the presence of diffuse AOs in the F12-appropriate orbital basis sets. Here we re-examine why diffuse AOs are necessary for application of F12 methods. To help such an investigation, we developed a dual-basis formulation of traditional and F12 coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) methods in which the reference (occupied) and correlating (virtual) orbitals are expanded in separate AO basis sets. Our conclusion is that diffuse AOs are fundamentally important for the traditional (non-F12) description of dynamical correlation; the necessity of diffuse AOs in F12 calculations arises indirectly due to the dramatic reduction of the basis set error by the F12 terms such that the error due to the lack of diffuse AOs becomes comparable to the residual basis set incompleteness. The dual-basis CC methods are suggested as an important candidate formalism for accurate (in particular, F12) reduced-scaling many-body methods in extended systems.

This paper presents a systematic study of the application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as an efficient and versatile tool for the analysis of critical and low-temperature phase states in spin system models. The problem of calculating the dependence of the average energy on the spatial distribution of exchange integrals for the Edwards-Anderson model on a square lattice with frustrated interactions is considered. We further construct a single convolutional classifier of phase states of the ferromagnetic Ising model on square, triangular, honeycomb, and kagome lattices, trained on configurations generated by the Swendsen-Wang cluster algorithm. Computed temperature profiles of the averaged posterior probability of the high-temperature phase form clear S-shaped curves that intersect in the vicinity of the theoretical critical temperatures and allow one to determine the critical temperature for the kagome lattice without additional retraining. It is shown that convolutional models substantially reduce the root-mean-square error (RMSE) compared with fully connected architectures and efficiently capture complex correlations between thermodynamic characteristics and the structure of magnetic correlated systems.

We consider the interaction between exciton-polaritons in a semiconductor quantum well, embedded in a microcavity, in the presence of disorder. The disorder acts on the excitons in the semiconductor quantum well. We have calculated the exciton and polariton self-energies and the exciton and polariton energy dispersion relations in the presence of disorder. Our results demonstrate that disorder increases the polariton-polariton interaction.

We analyze the thermodynamic structure of jump diffusions combining Brownian and Poisson noise, a class of stochastic dynamics relevant to nonequilibrium statistical physics. For such nonlocal dynamics, the free energy admits a full dissipation formula that decomposes into entropy production and housekeeping heat. A central result is a decomposition of the generator into symmetric and anti-symmetric parts with respect to the invariant measure $ρ_{ss}$. The symmetric sector corresponds to a reversible dynamics and yields a nonlocal Fisher information governing free-energy decay, whereas the anti-symmetric sector generates a canonical conservative flow that produces circulation but no dissipation. Several numerical examples demonstrate how this decomposition clarifies the structure of nonequilibrium stationary states in jump-driven systems.

### Ferromagnetic Phase Transition of DPPH Induced by a Magic Angle Helical Magnetic Field

We report the results and unique instrument configuration of a novel experiment in which we successfully transitioned a DPPH sample from its natural paramagnetic state and essentially a non-magnetic material to a ferromagnetic state at room temperature. This was achieved using a specifically applied helical flux magnetic field. The DPPH sample (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) remained ferromagnetic for at least one hour after the experiment, indicating that a transformation in the material was induced by the external field rather than being merely a temporary magnetic phase transition observed only during the experiment. The external magnetic field used had a helical pitch angle of approximately $54.7°$, known mathematically as the Magic Angle, relative to the +z-axis, which is aligned with the normal S to N external field's magnetic moment vector. Based on the phenomenology of the experiment, we infer that this specific magic angle corresponding to the known quantization precession spin angle of free electrons under a homogeneous straight flux magnetic field potentially enhances the percentage of unpaired valence electrons within the DPPH material, allowing them to align in parallel with the applied external field. Typically, in paramagnetic materials, the distribution of unpaired electrons' quantum spins relative to an external field is nearly random, showing roughly a 50% chance of either parallel or antiparallel alignment. Only a slight majority preference exists in one alignment direction due to the Boltzmann thermal distribution, which contributes to the paramagnetic nature of these materials. In our measurements, we found that the induced ferromagnetism of the DPPH sample resulted in an abnormal thousand-fold decimal value increase in relative magnetic permeability at $μ{\approx}1.4$, compared to its typical paramagnetic value of $1.0001$ for this material.

### Novel coupling between charge order and time-reversal-symmetry-breaking superconductivity

The interplay between charge-density waves (CDWs), which break translational symmetry, and spatially homogeneous superconductivity, which breaks global U(1) gauge symmetry, can give rise to an intriguing phenomenon: the pair-density wave, characterized by a spatial modulation of the superconducting order parameter. Yet how CDWs couple to unconventional superconducting states-particularly those with time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB)-remains largely unexplored. Here, using scanning tunneling microscopy on heavily hole-doped Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$, which hosts an s $\pm$ is superconducting state, we reveal a previously unobserved coupling between a surface CDW and TRSB superconductivity. Experimentally, the TRSB superconductivity imparts "chirality" to the CDW, which manifests as commensurate domains separated by domain walls with $π$-phase slips-forming what we term a bipolar CDW. The domain walls delineate TRSB domains of opposite chirality, consistent with spontaneous breaking of U(1) $\times$ Z2. Supported by theoretical modelling, we construct a framework in which a hidden interfacial pair-density modulation (PDM) mediates a linear coupling between the surface CDW and interband Josephson currents of TRSB superconductivity. Crucially, the theory shows that realizing this linear coupling requires a controlled global phase difference $δ$ $φ$ = $π$/2 between the PDM and CDW states. Our results uncover a previously overlooked connection between charge ordering and TRSB superconductivity, opening a pathway to explore intertwined quantum orders in iron-based superconductors and other strongly correlated systems.

We investigate an S=3/2 quantum spin model on a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice that continuously interpolates between two paradigmatic quantum disordered states with distinct entanglement structures: the Kitaev quantum spin liquid and the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) valence bond solid. Combining classical, semi-classical, and exact diagonalization approaches, we map out the ground-state phase diagram and elucidate the role of quantum fluctuations across the entire parameter range. While classical and semi-classical frameworks predict noncoplanar orders competing with a collinear Néel state, we find these phases to be fragile: once full quantum fluctuations are included, they melt into a quantum-entangled state characterized by suppressed spin correlations and enhanced entanglement entropy. Our findings highlight how competition between qualitatively different quantum disordered phases provides a fertile playground for unconventional phases emerging from their interplay and quantum fluctuations.

### Synchronous Differential Hot-charge Emission Spectroscopy: The Principle

- **TL;DR**: 提出同步差分热电荷发射光谱(sd-HotES)方法，通过消除隧道背景噪声，实现埋入界面能级对齐的精确测量。

Energy-level alignment (ELA) at buried interfaces between electrode and molecular materials sets charge injection barriers, carrier selectivity, and ultimately device efficiency, yet it is challenging to quantify under operating conditions. Hot-charge emission spectroscopy (HotES) probes ELA by injecting ballistic carriers across a tunneling oxide. Yet, the technique inherently convolutes the molecular response with a strong, energy-dependent tunneling background, complicating the isolation of the true ELA. We introduce synchronous differential HotES (sd-HotES), defined as the ratio of the differential conductance of the hot-charge and tunneling channels of the HotES. Physical modeling and numerical simulations validate that this ratio directly reconstructs the intrinsic molecular charge transmission, enabling the threshold-free and probe-bias-insensitive extraction of ELA. By effectively eliminating the masking tunneling background, sd-HotES substantially boosts detection sensitivity; weak spectral features previously hidden in conventional HotES become clearly resolvable, as demonstrated in lock-in simulations including realistic noise. This study establishes the fundamental operating principles of sd-HotES and highlights it as a powerful, broadly applicable strategy for accessing buried interface properties for the study of molecular and hybrid devices.

Adaptive precision molecular dynamics simulations have developed along energy- and force-coupling approaches, which allow for a continuous transition between different particle descriptions or interaction potentials. Most approaches consider different (fixed) spatial regions, which control the transition between the descriptions and consequently avoid a consistent momentum-conserving Hamiltonian description. We present here a new approach to fully integrate the coupling into a Hamiltonian, therefore allowing for a conservative description, which, by design, guarantees both energy and momentum conservation. By coupling a fast EAM potential to a highly accurate ACE potential, we verify numerically the conservation properties and show that one can achieve - dependent on both the potential and the atomistic system - a speedup of one or two orders of magnitude compared to a pure ACE simulation.

Recent observations of superconductivity in twisted bilayer WSe$_2$ have extended the family of moiré superconductors beyond twisted graphene. In WSe$_2$ two different twist angles were studied, 3.65° and 5.0°, and two seemingly distinct superconducting phase diagrams were reported, raising the question of whether the superconducting phases in the two devices share a similar origin. Here we address the question by experimentally mapping the evolution of the phase diagram across devices with twist angles spanning the range defined by the initial reports, and comparing the results to twist angle-dependent theory. We find that the superconducting state evolves smoothly with twist angle and at all twist angles is proximal to a Fermi surface reconstruction with, presumably, antiferromagnetic ordering, but is neither necessarily tied to the Van Hove singularity, nor to the half band insulator. Our results connect the previously distinct phase diagrams at 3.65° and 5°, and offer new insight into the origin of the superconductivity in this system and its evolution as the correlation strength increases. More broadly, the smooth phase diagram evolution, repeatability between different devices, and dynamic gate tunability within each device, establish twisted transition metal dichalcogenides as a unique platform for the study of correlated phases as the ratio of interaction strength to bandwidth is varied.

Insomuch as statistical mechanics circumvents the formidable task of addressing many-body dynamics, it remains a challenge to derive macroscopic properties from a solution to Hamiltonian equations for microscopic motion of an isolated system. Launching new attacks on this long-standing problem -- part of Hilbert's sixth problem -- is urgently important, for focus of statistical phenomena is shifting from a fictitious ensemble to an individual member, i.e. a mechanically isolated system. Here we uncover a common probabilistic structure, the concentration of measure, in Hamiltonian dynamics of two families of systems, the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT) model which is finite-dimensional and (almost) ergodic, and the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) which is infinite-dimensional and suffers strong ergodicity breaking. That structure is protected by the geometry of phase space and immune to ergodicity breaking, leading to counterintuitive phenomena. Notably, an isolated FPUT behaves as a thermal ideal gas even for strong modal interaction, with the thermalization time analogous to the Ehrenfest time in quantum chaos, while an isolated GPE system, without any quantum inputs, escapes the celebrated ultraviolet catastrophe through nonlinear wave localization in the mode space, and the Rayleigh-Jeans equilibrium sets in the localization volume. Our findings may have applications in nonlinear optics and cold-atom dynamics.

Materials with broken fundamental symmetries, such as chiral crystals, provide a rich playground for exploring unconventional spin-dependent transport phenomena. The interplay between a material's chirality, strong spin-orbit coupling, and charge currents can lead to complex non-reciprocal effects, where electrical resistance depends on the direction of current and magnetic fields. In this study, we systematically investigate the angular dependencies of magnetoresistance in single-crystalline chiral Tellurium (Te). We observe distinct non-reciprocal magnetoresistances for magnetic fields applied along three orthogonal directions: parallel to the current along the chiral axis (z), in the sample plane but perpendicular to the current (y), and out of the sample plane (x). Through detailed analysis of the chirality- and thickness-dependence of the signals, we successfully disentangle multiple coexisting mechanisms. We conclude that the Edelstein effect, arising from the chiral structure's radial spin texture, is responsible for the non-reciprocity along the z-axis. In contrast, the chirality-independent signal along the y-axis is attributed to the Nernst effect, and the non-reciprocity along the x-axis may originate from intrinsic orbital magnetizations. These findings elucidate the complex interplay of spin, orbital, and thermal effects in Te, providing a complete picture of its non-reciprocal transport properties.

We report two types of dressed fermions in a triplet superconductor with an in-situ disorder effective field. They are obtained numerically by analyzing with the Pauli Master Equation, the self-consistent imaginary part data of the elastic-scattering cross-section. We use a two-component irreducible representation of the order parameter with quasi-point nodes and study the quasi-classical effective probabilistic density distribution as function of disorder. We find a stable coherent quantum state of dressed fermions, and slow characteristic decay time for dilute disorder. Also, we find an incoherent quantum state with diffused dressed fermions and enriched disorder with self-consistency increasing decoherence, a fast characteristic decay time, and a diffuse unitary resonance. We conclude that the most stable dressed fermion states are those in which the field has dilute disorder, the threshold zero gap, and some dressed fermions behave like an s-wave superconductor, showing a tiny gap.

Research on strongly correlated electron systems faces a fundamental challenge due to the complex nature of intrinsic many-body correlations. A key strategy to address this challenge lies in advancing experimental methods that can directly probe and elucidate the underlying many-body correlations. In this perspective article, we discuss the theoretically proposed coincidence detection techniques, which are designed to directly measure two-body correlations in various particle-particle and particle-hole channels, with momentum, energy, and/or spatial resolution. We also explore the prospects of these coincidence detection techniques for future theoretical and experimental developments. The successful implementation and refinement of these coincidence detection techniques promise to deliver powerful new approaches for unraveling long-standing puzzles in strongly correlated electron systems, such as the enigmatic mechanism of unconventional superconductivity and the long-sought quantum spin liquids. Furthermore, these coincidence detection techniques will offer powerful new methods to investigate novel phenomena like itinerant magnetism and electronic nematicity in quantum materials.

Accurate prediction of liquid viscosity is essential for process design and simulation, yet remains challenging for novel molecules. Conventional group-contribution models struggle with isomer discrimination, large molecules, and parameter availability, while purely data-driven graph neural networks (GNNs) demand large datasets and offer limited interpretability. Even when feasible to be applied, purely data-driven models lack thermodynamic consistency in their predictions and are not a reliable solution. This work introduces ExPUFFIN, an extended version of the Path-unifying Feed-Forward Interfaced Network, consisting of a hybrid GNN-based framework that directly predicts temperature-dependent viscosities of pure hydrocarbons from molecular graphs, while enforcing mechanistic inductive biases in the output layer to ensure thermodynamic consistency. Molecular information is given as graph structures, encoded as a graph convolutional network, and mapped to an inductive bias neuron based on two thermophysical correlations:a three-parameter Andrade-type equation and a four-parameter empirical viscosity-temperature relation. The accuracy of these models is compared with a solely data-driven prediction. The Andrade-based ExPUFFIN variant reduces RMSE compared to the purely data-driven baseline of 37 percent and yields smooth, physically consistent interpolation and extrapolation of viscosity-temperature curves, properties that are not observed in purely data-driven models. The empirical ExPUFFIN model provides comparable accuracy while retaining robust trends. Overall, embedding physics-based structure in GNN outputs improves accuracy, robustness, and transferability, enabling reliable viscosity predictions for complex hydrocarbon molecules. The approach is readily extendable to other properties and significantly broader chemical domains.

This article reviews recent theoretical developments in the ab initio study of polarons in materials. The polaron is an emergent quasiparticle that arises from the interaction between electrons and phonons in solids, and consists of an electron or a hole accompanied by a distortion of the crystal lattice. Recent advances in experiments, theory, and computation have made it possible to investigate these quasiparticles with unprecedented detail, reigniting the interest in this classic problem of condensed matter physics. Recent theoretical and computational advances include ab initio calculations of polaron spectral functions, wavefunctions, lattice distortions, and transport and optical properties. These developments provide new insight into polaron physics, but they have evolved somewhat independently from the earlier effective Hamiltonian approaches that laid the foundation of the field. This article aims to bridge these complementary perspectives by placing them within a single unified conceptual framework. To this end, we start by reviewing effective Hamiltonians of historical significance in polaron theory, ab initio techniques based on density functional theory, and many-body first-principles approaches to polarons. After this survey, we outline a general field-theoretic framework that bridges between these diverse approaches to polaron physics. For completeness, we also review recent progress in the study of exciton polarons and self-trapped excitons and their relations to polarons. Beyond the methodology, we discuss recent applications to several classes of materials that attracted attention in the context of polaron physics.

Quantum sensors based on electronic spins have emerged as powerful probes of microwave-frequency fields. Among other solid-state platforms, spins in molecular crystals offer a range of advantages, from high spin density to functionalization via chemical tunability. Here, we demonstrate microwave vector magnetometry using the photoexcited spin triplet of pentacene molecules, operating at zero external magnetic field and room temperature. We achieve full three-dimensional microwave field reconstruction by detecting the Rabi frequencies of anisotropic spin-triplet transitions associated with two crystallographic orientations of pentacene in deuterated naphthalene crystals. We further introduce a phase alternated protocol that extends the rotating-frame coherence time by an order of magnitude and enables sensitivities of approximately $1~μ\mathrm{T}/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ with sub-micrometer spatial resolution. These results establish pentacene-based molecular spins as a practical and high-performance platform for microwave quantum sensing in addition to demonstrating control techniques broadly applicable to other molecular and solid-state spin systems.

- **TL;DR**: 空间扩展的多物种种群动力学模型（如Lotka-Volterra随机相互作用模型）在物种数量无限时，种群规模的相关函数呈现无标度特征，由接近灭绝的物种驱动。

We show that spatial extensions of many-species population dynamics models, such as the Lotka-Volterra model with random interactions we focus on in this work, generically exhibit scale-free correlation functions of population sizes in the limit of an infinite number of species. Using dynamical mean-field theory, we describe the many-species system in terms of single-species dynamics with demographic and environmental noises. We show that the single-species model features a random mass term, or equivalently a random space-time averaged growth rate, poising some species very close to extinction. This introduces a hierarchy of ever larger correlation times and lengths as the extinction threshold is approached. In turn, every species, even those far from extinction, are coupled to these near-critical fields which combine to make fluctuations of population sizes generically scale-free. We argue that these correlations are described by exponents derived from those of directed percolation in spatial dimension $d=3$, but not in lower dimensions.

Toward measuring the thermal properties of exfoliated atomically thin materials, we demonstrate simultaneous measurements of the thermal conductivity and specific heat in suspended membranes. We use the 3ω technique applied to quasi-two-dimensional silicon nitride membranes having a metal line heater patterned on the surface to both deliver heat and directly measure the thermal impedance of the membrane at the heating frequency, Z(2ω). We derive an expression for the complex thermal impedance as a function of frequency, approximating the actual rectangular membranes with a one dimensional model. The derivation accounts for potential parasitic heat loss mechanisms including conduction along the heater line, and by the gas load in an imperfect vacuum. Qualitatively, the thermal impedance response resembles a low-pass filter, owing to the combination of the total thermal resistance and total specific heat. Fitting Z(2ω) to measurements across a few decades in frequency, we extract values of the thermal conductivity and specific heat of silicon nitride in agreement with literature values. We also study the dependence on the heating current, and compare to measurements of the thermal conductivity at zero frequency.

Trilayer Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate superconductor $\mathrm{La}_4 \mathrm{Ni}_3 \mathrm{O}_{10}$ has generated considerable interest due to its unconventional superconductivity and complex electronic structure. Notably, $\mathrm{La}_4 \mathrm{Ni}_3 \mathrm{O}_{10}$ features a mixed Ni valence state and an asymmetric trilayer configuration, leading to distinct quasiparticle distributions and local density of states (LDOS) between the inner and outer NiO$_2$ planes. In this work, we investigate impurity-induced states in $\mathrm{La}_4 \mathrm{Ni}_3 \mathrm{O}_{10}$ using a two-orbital model combined with $T$-matrix formalism, focusing on the contrasting roles of intra- and interlayer pairing channels. Our self-consistent mean-field analysis reveals that interlayer pairing results in partially gapless Fermi surfaces, with unpaired quasiparticles concentrated in the outer layers and a pronounced low-energy LDOS. We demonstrate that impurity effects vary significantly depending on both the pairing symmetry and impurity location: interlayer-dominant pairing produces sharp resonance states when impurities are in the inner layer, whereas impurities in the outer layer lead to in-gap enhancements without sharp resonances; in contrast, intralayer-dominant pairing generally yields increased in-gap LDOS without sharp impurity resonances, regardless of impurity position. These findings suggest that single-impurity spectroscopy can serve as a powerful probe to distinguish between competing superconducting pairing mechanisms in trilayer nickelates and highlight the rich physics arising from their multilayer structure.

- **TL;DR**: 奇异关联器是检测对称性保护拓扑相的有力工具，但参考态选择不当会在平凡SPT相中产生虚假长程奇异关联，导致误判。

Strange correlator is a powerful tool widely used in detecting symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. However, the result of strange correlator crucially relies on the adoption of the reference state. In this work, we report that an ill-chosen reference state can induce spurious long-range strange correlators in trivial SPT phases, leading to false positives in SPT diagnosis. Using matrix product state (MPS) representation, we trace the origin of these spurious signals in trivial SPT phases to the magnitude-degeneracy of the transfer matrix. We systematically classify three distinct mechanisms responsible for such degeneracy, each substantiated by concrete examples: (1) the presence of high-dimensional irreducible representations in the entanglement space; (2) a phase mismatch in symmetry representations between the target and reference states; and (3) long-range order arising from symmetry breaking. Our findings clarify the importance of the choice of proper reference states, providing a guideline to avoid pitfalls and correctly identify SPT order using strange correlators.

A unitary coupled-cluster (UCC)-based self-consistent electron propagator theory (EPT) is proposed for the description of electron-detached and electron-attached states. Two practical schemes, termed IP/EA-UCC3 and IP/EA-qUCCSD, are developed and implemented within the UCC singles and doubles (UCCSD) framework using the perturbative and commutator-based truncation strategy for the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian $\bar{H}$. The numerical performance of these UCC-based EPT methods is extensively evaluated against full configuration interaction (FCI) reference data and compared with established approaches, including IP/EA-ADC(3), IP/EA-ADC(4) and IP/EA-EOM-CCSD. Benchmark calculations demonstrate that IP-qUCCSD achieves the highest overall accuracy among Hermitian ionized-state methods for one-hole (1h)-dominated IPs of closed-shell systems, with a mean absolute deviation (MAD) of 0.19 eV and standard deviation (SD) of 0.13 eV. Remarkably, despite the absence of triple-excitation contributions, IP-qUCCSD outperforms the higher-order ADC(4) method. For one-particle (1p)-dominated EA calculations, all tested methods exhibit comparable accuracy.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究结合实验与理论方法，系统研究了LiYTiO₄的晶格动力学与热输运性质，预测了其超低热导率，并建立了可靠的电池材料热性质计算框架。

Layered perovskite lithium yttrium titanate ($\rm LiYTiO_4$) has recently emerged as a promising low-potential, ultrahigh-rate intercalation-type anode material for lithium-ion batteries; however, its lattice dynamics and thermal transport properties remain poorly understood, limiting a complete evaluation of its practical potential. Here, we combine experimental measurements with theoretical modeling to systematically investigate the anharmonic lattice dynamics and heat transport in $\rm LiYTiO_4$. We employ a neural evolution potential (NEP)-based framework that integrates the temperature-dependent effective potential method with the Wigner thermal transport (WTT) formalism, explicitly including both diagonal and off-diagonal terms of the heat-flux operator. Zero-temperature phonon calculations reveal dynamical instabilities associated with $\rm TiO_6$ octahedral rotation, which are stabilized at finite temperatures through anharmonic renormalization. Using the WTT approach with contributions from phonon propagation and coherence contributions, we predict a room-temperature lattice thermal conductivity ($κ_{\rm L}$) of 3.8 $\rm Wm^{-1}K^{-1}$ averaged over all crystal orientations, in close agreement with the measured value of 3.2 \pm 0.08 $\rm Wm^{-1}K^{-1}$ for polycrystalline samples. To further examine the possible influence of ionic motion on high-temperature thermal transport, we compute $κ_{\rm L}$ using a Green-Kubo equilibrium molecular dynamics approach based on the same NEP, which yields consistent results with both experiment and WTT predictions, confirming the negligible role of Li-ion mobility in heat conduction. Our study not only identifies the ultralow thermal conductivity of $\rm LiYTiO_4$ as a key limitation for its practical application but also establishes a reliable computational framework for studying thermal properties in battery materials.

Moiré superlattices with long-range periodicity exhibit Hofstadter energy spectra under accessible magnetic fields, enabling the exploration of emergent quantum phenomena through a hierarchy of fractal states. However, higher-order features, located at elevated energies with narrow bandwidths, typically require high carrier densities and remain difficult to resolve using conventional electrical transport due to limited sensitivity and strong background conductivity. Here, we utilize acoustoelectric (AE) transport to probe high-order fractal states and the Hofstadter spectrum in graphene/hBN moiré superlattices. Surface acoustic waves on a ferroelectric LiNbO$_3$ substrate generate an AE voltage proportional to the derivative of electrical conductivity, significantly enhancing sensitivity to weak spectral features. Combined with substrate-induced high electron doping, this technique resolves fractal Brown-Zak oscillations up to the fifth-order and provides the first AE observation of the Hofstadter butterfly, revealing high-order fractal magnetic Bloch states and symmetry-broken Landau levels over a wide carrier density range. Our results establish AE transport as a powerful derivative-sensitive probe for emergent fractal quantum states in moiré-engineered 2D systems.

In this paper, we employ a semiperturbative theory to study the statistical structural properties of energy eigenfunctions (EFs) in many-body quantum chaotic systems consisting of a central system coupled to an environment. Under certain assumptions, we derive both the average shape and the statistical fluctuations of EFs on the basis formed by the direct product of the energy eigenbases of the system and the environment. Furthermore, we apply our results to two fundamental questions: (i) the properties of the reduced density matrix of the central system in an eigenstate, and (ii) the structure of the off-diagonal smooth function within the framework of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. Numerical results are also presented in support of our main findings.

We present a comprehensive first-principles investigation of carbon self-interstitial defects in diamond, ranging from mono- to hexa-interstitial complexes. By quantum mechanical density functional theory, empowered by interatomic potential models, we efficiently sample the complex configurational landscape and identify both known and previously unreported defect geometries. Our results reveal a pronounced energetic driving force for aggregation: the formation energy per interstitial decreases systematically from isolated split interstitials to compact multi-interstitial clusters, with the tetra-interstitial platelet emerging as a particularly stable structural motif. Additionally, charge analysis indicates that the predominantly covalent bonding in diamond becomes more polar within the defect centers. Analysis of defect energy levels shows that only the investigated mono-, di-, penta-, and hexa-interstitial complexes introduce in-gap electronic states, whereas the tri- and tetra-interstitial clusters are electronically inert. Vibrational spectroscopies further reveal that self-interstitials generate characteristic signatures. Short carbon-carbon bonds inside the defect cores give rise to high-frequency vibrational modes between 1375 and 1925 cm$^{-1}$, which are strongly IR-active but exhibit weak Raman activity. Taken together, these findings provide a coherent picture of the structural, electronic, and vibrational characteristics of carbon self-interstitials and establish a robust framework for their experimental identification.

Recently, the possibility of high-temperature superconductivity (SC) in flat-band (FB) systems has been the focus of a great deal of activity. This study reveals that unlike conventional intra-band SC for which disorder has a dramatic impact, that associated with FBs is surprisingly robust to disorder-induced fluctuations and quasi-particle localization. In particular, for weak off-diagonal disorder, the critical temperature decreases linearly with disorder amplitude for conventional SC, whereas it is only quadratic in the case of SC in FBs. Our findings could have a major impact on the research and development of new compounds whose high purity will no longer be a critical barrier to their synthesis.

We investigate the quantum dynamics of the electron spin resonance of topological defects (edge state) in dimerized chains. These objects are discontinuities of the spin chain protected by the properties of the global system leading to a quantum many-body multiplet protected from the environment decoherence. Despite recent achievements in the realization of isolated and finite spin chains, the potential implementation in quantum devices needs the knowledge of the relaxation and decoherence sources. Our study reveals that electron spin lattice relaxation is governed at lowest temperatures by phonon-bottlenecked process and at high temperature by the chain dimerization gap. We show that the inter edge-state effective dipolar field is reduced by the intrachain exchange coupling leading to a longer coherence time than isolated ions at equivalent concentration. Ultimately, we demonstrate that the homogeneous broadening is governed by the intra-chain dipolar field, and we establish design principles for optimizing coherence in future materials.

Transition state or minimum energy path finding methods constitute a routine component of the computational chemistry toolkit. Standard analysis involves trajectories conventionally plotted in terms of the relative energy to the initial state against a cumulative displacement variable, or the image number. These dimensional reductions obscure structural rearrangements in high dimensions and may often be trajectory dependent. This precludes the ability to compare optimization trajectories of different methods beyond the number of calculations, time taken, and final saddle geometry. We present a method mapping trajectories onto a two-dimension surface defined by a permutation corrected root mean square deviation from the reactant and product configurations. Energy is represented as an interpolated color-mapped surface constructed from all optimization steps using radial basis functions. This representation highlights optimization trajectories, identifies endpoint basins, and diagnoses convergence concerns invisible in one-dimensional profiles. We validate the framework on a cycloaddition reaction, showing that a machine-learned potential saddle and density functional theory reference lie on comparable energy contours despite geometric displacements.

- **TL;DR**: SOC对InAs/GaSb量子阱中反常量子振荡具有双重效应：在干净情况下抑制振荡，在无序情况下增强振荡，并可诱导相移。

We theoretically study the effect of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) on anomalous quantum oscillations in InAs/GaSb quantum wells. By comparing different cases, we show that SOC induces two opposing effects on anomalous quantum oscillations: it suppresses the oscillations in the clean case, while enhancing them in the disordered case. Using an effective model, we analyze in detail the origins of anomalous oscillations in both clean and disordered cases. Based on these origins, we explain why SOC suppresses or enhances the anomalous oscillations in different cases, thereby extending the understanding of the conventional theory. Moreover, in the disordered case, SOC can induce a phase shift of the anomalous oscillations. We further identify a parameter window where the anomalous oscillations are significantly enhanced in the presence of both disorder and SOC. These results provide a theoretical basis for understanding the role of SOC in anomalous quantum oscillations.

Recent progress in open many-body quantum systems has highlighted the importance of the Markov length, the characteristic scale over which conditional correlations decay. It has been proposed that non-equilibrium phases of matter can be defined as equivalence classes of states connected by short-time evolution while maintaining a finite Markov length, a notion called local reversibility. A natural question is whether well-known classical models of non-equilibrium criticality fit within this framework. Here we investigate the Domany--Kinzel model -- which exhibits an active phase and an absorbing phase separated by a 1+1-D directed-percolation transition -- from this information-theoretic perspective. Using tensor network simulations, we provide evidence for local reversibility within the active phase. Notably, the Markov length diverges upon approaching the critical point, unlike classical equilibrium transitions where Markov length is zero due to their Gibbs character. Correspondingly, the conditional mutual information exhibits scaling consistent with directed percolation universality. Further, we analytically study the case of 1+1-D compact directed percolation, where the Markov length diverges throughout the phase diagram due to spontaneous breaking of domain-wall parity symmetry from strong to weak. Nevertheless, the conditional mutual information continues to faithfully detect the corresponding phase transition.

Reliably simulating two-dimensional many-body quantum dynamics with projected entangled pair states (PEPS) has long been a difficult challenge. In this work, we overcome this barrier for low-energy quantum dynamics by developing a stable and efficient time-dependent variational Monte Carlo (tVMC) framework for PEPS. By analytically removing all gauge redundancies of the PEPS manifold and exploiting tensor locality, we obtain a numerically well-conditioned stochastic reconfiguration (SR) equation amenable to robust solution using the efficient Cholesky decomposition, enabling long-time evolution in previously inaccessible regimes. We demonstrate the power and generality of the method through four representative real-time problems in two dimensions: (I) chiral edge propagation in a free-fermion Chern insulator; (II) fractionalized charge transport in a fractional Chern insulator; (III) vison confinement dynamics in the Higgs phase of a Z2 lattice gauge theory; and (IV) superfluidity and critical velocity in interacting bosons. All simulations are performed on 12x12 or 13x13 lattices with evolution times T = 10 to 12 using modest computational resources (1 to 5 days on a single GPU card). Where exact benchmarks exist (case I), PEPS-tVMC matches free-fermion dynamics with high accuracy up to T = 12. These results establish PEPS-tVMC as a practical and versatile tool for real-time quantum dynamics in two dimensions. The method extends the reach of classical tensor-network simulations for studying elementary excitations in quantum many-body systems and provides a valuable computational counterpart to emerging quantum simulators.

When a molecule contains more than a few atoms, its full-dimensional dynamics becomes untractable, especially when introducing temperature effects. In such a case, it can be interesting to focus only on a few degrees of freedom and to model the rest of the molecule as a finite-dimensional bath. In this prospect, we extend the effective bath state (EBS) method that we had first developed and benchmarked in [J. Chem. Phys. \textbf{160}, 044107 (2024)] to describe the spectroscopy and intramolecular dynamics of complex isolated molecules. The EBS method is a system-bath approach based on the coarse-graining of the bath into a reduced set of effective energy states. It allows for a significant reduction of the bath dimension and makes finite-temperature calculations more accessible. In order to treat a realistic molecule, the method is extended to include polynomial couplings in the bath coordinates. The ability of the method to model temperature-resolved infrared spectra and to follow population transfers between the vibrational modes of the molecule is first tested on a 10-mode model system. The extended method is then applied to the realistic case of phenylacetylene.

Two-dimensional carbon nitride materials have been the center of attention for their diverse usage in energy harvesting, environmental remediation and nanoelectronic applications. A broad range of utilities with decent synthetic plausibility have made this family a sweet spot to dive into, whereas the underlying analytical aspects are yet to have prominence. Recently, using the machinaries of first principles, we reported a family of six different structures C3NX with a unique dumbbell-shaped morphology, functionalizing the recently synthesized monolayer of C3N. Here we have critically explored the non-trivial topological phases of the semimetallic Dumbbell C3NX sheets and nanoribbons. Spin-orbit coupling induced gap across the Fermi level, its subsequent tuning via an external electric field, portrayal of band inversion from the Berry curvature distribution and the evaluation of topological index using the Wannier charge center (WCC) firmly establishes the traces of topological footprint. The real space decimation scheme and Green function technique evaluate the underlying spectral information with corresponding transport characteristics. Fascinating features of these quasi-1D systems are observed utilizing the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model where different twisted phases reveal distinct topological signatures even in a low atomic mass system like DB C4N.

- **TL;DR**: 首次实现晶圆级非晶拓扑半金属TaP，通过低温原子层沉积在SiO2上生长，薄膜电阻随厚度减小而降低，适用于后端互连集成。

As data-centric computing advances, energy-efficient interconnects are increasingly critical for AI-driven systems. Traditional metal conductors face severe limitations at nanoscale due to increased resistivity from surface scattering. In response, this study demonstrates the first wafer-scale realization of an amorphous topological semimetal, tantalum phosphide (TaP), grown directly on amorphous SiO2 substrates (without any seed layers) using low-temperature atomic layer deposition (ALD). The resulting TaP films exhibit unconventional resistivity scaling: decreasing resistivity with decreasing thickness, reaching 227 micro-ohm cm at ~2.3 nm film thickness. This behavior, observed without crystalline order or seed layers, indicates dominant surface conduction and establishes ALD-TaP as a promising candidate for back-end-of-line integration. The films also show excellent conformality, stoichiometry control, and thermal stability up to 600 degree C. A two-channel conduction model confirms surface-dominated transport in ultrathin regimes, further supported by enhanced conductivity in multi-stacked configurations. These findings highlight the potential of amorphous topological semimetals for future high-density, low-power electronic interconnects and expand the applicability of ALD for integrating novel quantum materials at scale.

Moiré superlattices in two-dimensional materials provide a versatile platform to explore strongly correlated and topological phases. This work presents a practical theoretical workflow for studying the correlated and topological states in moiré systems, combining continuum modeling, Hartree-Fock mean-field approximations, many-body perturbation theory, and exact diagonalizations. We focus on the numerical implementation of these methods, emphasizing subtleties such as remote band effects, inhomogeneous and dynamical screening, double counting problem, etc., which are often swept under the rug in theoretical works. The workflow enables a systematic investigation of symmetry-breaking ground state properties, quasiparticle excitation properties and fractional Chern insulator phases emerging from moiré superlattices, providing insights that are directly relevant to experimental observations. By bridging technical details and physical interpretations, this work aims to guide both theorists and experimentalists in understanding and predicting correlated phenomena in moiré materials.

In this work, we explore the reuse of terms in the Jastrow factor between systems for use in the transcorrelated method, to reduce the number of optimisable parameters for a given system. In particular, we propose a workflow in which atom-specific parts of Jastrow factors, optimised in atoms, may be reused in the molecule, with only a few parameters in the electron-electron part of the Jastrow left to optimise, while maintaining performance. We find that the modified workflow not only reduces the number of terms needing to be optimised, but also improves the accuracy of xTC-CCSD(T) energies.

- **TL;DR**: 通过非微扰方法解析计算了t2g态轨道偶极和四极矩的弛豫率，发现轨道弛豫源于动量散射与晶体场效应的竞争，弱无序时弛豫时间正比于动量散射时间，强无序时反比于动量散射时间，且偶极和四极矩通过晶体场耦合

Using a nonperturbative approach, the relaxation rate of orbital dipolar and quadrupolar moments is computed analytically for the t2g states. In the presence of short-range impurities and in the absence of spin-orbit coupling, the orbital relaxation emerges from the competition between momentum scattering and the effect of the crystal field. In the case of weak disorder, the orbital relaxation time is proportional to the momentum scattering time: each scattering event contributes to destroying the orbital moment. In the case of strong disorder, the effect of the crystal field is averaged out, and the orbital relaxation time is inversely proportional to the momentum scattering. We finally find that the dipolar and quadrupolar orbital moments are coupled by the crystal field, resulting in a complex dynamical behavior upon orbital injection.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文提出了一个密度泛函理论框架，将自由能泛函的函数导数与量子多体系统中的非线性静态密度响应函数联系起来，推导了高阶响应函数的显式表达式，并首次理论计算了立方响应函数χ₀^(1,3)(q)。

A density functional theory (DFT) framework is presented that links functional derivatives of free-energy functionals to non-linear static density response functions in quantum many-body systems. Within this framework, explicit expressions are derived for various higher-order response functions of systems that are homogeneous on average, including the first theoretical result for the cubic response at the first harmonic $χ_0^{(1,3)}(\vec{q})$. Specifically, our framework includes hitherto neglected mode-coupling effects that are important for the non-linear density response even in the presence of a single harmonic perturbation. We compare these predictions for $χ_0^{(1,3)}(\vec{q})$ to new Kohn-Sham DFT simulations, leading to excellent agreement between theory and numerical results. Exact analytical expressions are also obtained for the long-wavelength limits of the ideal quadratic and cubic response functions. Particular emphasis is placed on the connections between the third- and fourth-order functional derivatives of the non-interacting free-energy functional $F_s[n]$ and the ideal quadratic and cubic response functions of the uniform electron gas, respectively. These relations provide exact constraints that may prove useful for the future construction of improved approximations to $F_s[n]$, in particular for warm dense matter applications at finite temperatures. Here, we use this framework to assess several commonly employed approximations to $F_s[n]$ through orbital-free DFT simulations of the harmonically perturbed ideal electron gas. The results are compared with Kohn-Sham DFT calculations across temperatures ranging from the ground state to the warm dense regime. Additionally, we analyze in detail the temperature- and wavenumber-dependent non-monotonic behavior of the ideal quadratic and cubic response functions.

Response of refractory high-entropy alloys MoNbTaVW and HfNbTaTiZr to ultrafast radiation is modelled with the hybrid code XTANT-3, combining tight-binding molecular dynamics with the transport Monte Carlo and Boltzmann equation. A two-temperature state with elevated electronic temperature and a cold atomic lattice is studied. The parameters of the electronic system in such a state are studied: electronic heat capacity, thermal conductivity, and electron-phonon coupling parameter with the electronic temperatures up to ~25,000 K. It is also demonstrated that the two refractory alloys do not show signs of nonthermal melting up to the deposited doses of ~10 eV/atom, making them more radiation resistant than the Cantor alloy or stainless steel. These results suggest that heavy-element high-entropy alloys are more radiation resistant than those containing only lighter elements. Damage in irradiated HfNbTaTiZr starts with the selective diffusion of Ti atoms, forming a transient superionic-like state.

Freestanding thin films, a class of low-dimensional materials capable of maintaining structural integrity without substrates, have emerged as a forefront research focus. Their unique advantages-circumventing substrate clamping, liberating intrinsic material properties, and enabling cross-platform heterogeneous integration-underpin this prominence. This review systematically summarizes core fabrication techniques, including physical delamination (e.g., laser lift-off, mechanical exfoliation) and chemical etching, alongside associated transfer strategies. It further explores the induced strain modulation mechanisms, extreme mechanical properties and interface decoupling effects enabled by these films. Representative case studies demonstrate breakthrough applications in flexible/ultrathin electronics, ultrahigh-sensitivity sensors and the exploration of novel quantum states. Critical challenges regarding scalable fabrication, precise interface control, and long-term stability are analyzed, concluding with prospects for emerging applications in bio-inspired intelligent devices, quantum precision sensing, and brain-inspired neural networks.

The interplay of the excitoniclike polariton, polariton, and photoniclike polariton coherent states in mass-imbalanced electron-hole systems within optical microcavities is theoretically examined. Utilizing the unrestricted Hartree-Fock approximation, we derive a set of self-consistent equations that evaluate the excitonic and photonic order parameters in a two-band electronic model, accounting equally for both electron-hole Coulomb attraction and light-matter coupling. Analyzing the competition among these condensate order parameters reveals a complex phase structure of coherent states in the ground state. As the mass imbalance is reduced, we observe a transition from a normal disordered electron-hole-photon system to excitoniclike, polariton, and ultimately photoniclike polariton condensation states. The distinct features of these robust condensates can be identified in the momentum distribution of the electron-hole pair amplitude and the photonic density, as well as in the wave-number-resolved photoemission spectra of electrons, holes, and photons. Increasing the excitation density further expands the range of condensation states. Additionally, lowering the mass imbalance leads to the emergence of quantum coherent bound states prior to the formation of robust condensates, which are evidenced by the static and dynamical excitonic and photonic susceptibility functions.

A central pursuit in theoretical chemistry is the accurate simulation of photochemical reactions, which are governed by nonadiabatic transitions through conical intersections. Machine learning has emerged as a transformative tool for constructing the necessary potential energy surfaces, but applying it to excited states faces a fundamental barrier: the cost of generating high-level quantum chemistry data. We overcome this challenge by developing machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) that achieve multi-state multi-reference perturbation theory accuracy through various techniques, such as transfer, multi-state, and $Δ$-learning. Applied to the methaniminium cation, our highest-fidelity transfer-learning model uncovers its complete photodissociation landscape following S$_2$ photoexcitation. The comprehensive XMCQDPT2/SA(3)-CASSCF(12,12) electronic structure description captures all competing decay channels, including S$_1$ branching into photoisomerization and direct H$_2$-loss pathways. Our results show that the population dynamics generally depends on the MLIP model, correlating with its performance. At the same time, the introduction of MLIP-uncertainty corrections based on the predictions of an ensemble of models brings different approaches into agreement, validating this metric as essential for reliable dynamics. To interpret the population dynamics, we introduce a wavepacket oscillation model - a mechanistically transparent, power-law kinetics framework that extracts state-specific lifetimes directly from first-principles simulations. The model quantitatively reproduces the ultrafast decay, creating a direct link between quantum transition probabilities and classical rate constants. The kinetic fits yield channel-specific lifetimes, supporting the recently discovered photochemical pathway mediated by a novel $σπ^*/S_0$ conical intersection.

- **TL;DR**: 提出使用反铁磁-拓扑绝缘体双层结构，通过界面缓冲层调控Berry相位驱动的自旋-电荷响应，重点研究自旋翻转隧穿在电子和输运性质中的关键作用。

We propose an altermagnet-topological insulator bilayer as a platform to engineer Berry phase driven spin-charge responses using an interfacial buffer layer. Using a momentum-space lattice model and linear-response theory, we investigate a $d$-wave altermagnet coupled to a topological insulator and highlight the crucial role of spin-flip tunneling in shaping its electronic and transport properties. Interfacial hybridization strongly modifies the band structure, leading to anisotropic Rashba-Edelstein and Hall responses. The spin-flip component of the coupling induces an inverse $d$-wave spin texture in the altermagnetic bands, signaling the onset of an altermagnetic topological phase. This coupling also renders the Rashba-Edelstein effect strongly in-plane anisotropic, enhancing the transverse response relative to ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic analogues. These results establish interfacial spin-flip tunneling as a practical control knob for direction-sensitive, stray-field-free spin-charge conversion in correlated topological heterostructures.

Conformal fields with boundaries give rise to rich critical phenomena that can reveal information about the underlying conformality. While most existing studies focus on Hermitian systems, here we explore boundary critical phenomena in a non-Hermitian quantum 5-state Potts model which exhibits complex conformality in the bulk. We identify free, fixed and mixed conformal boundary conditions and observe the conformal tower structure of energy spectra, supporting the emergence of conformal boundary criticality. We also studied the duality relation between different conformal boundary conditions under the Kramers-Wannier transformation. These findings should facilitate a comprehensive understanding for complex CFTs and stimulate further exploration on the boundary critical phenomena within non-Hermitian strongly-correlated systems.

The ability to reversibly and site-selectively tune ambipolar doping in a single semiconductor is crucial for reconfigurable electronics beyond silicon, but remains highly challenging. Here, we present a rewritable architecture based on electron-beam programmable field-effect transistors (FETs). Using WSe$_2$ as a model system, we demonstrate electron-beam-induced doping that enables reversible, precisely controlled carrier modulation exceeding $10^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$. The in-situ writing, erasing, and rewriting of ambipolar doping of nanoscale patterns was directly visualized by scanning microwave impedance microscopy. This mask-free, lithography-compatible approach can achieve precise band engineering within individual channels, yielding near-ideal subthreshold swings (~ 60 mV/dec) and finely tunable threshold voltages for both carrier types without specialized contact engineering. These capabilities allow on-demand realization of high performance logic, including CMOS inverters with high voltage gains and low power consumption, as well as NAND-to-NOR transitions on the same device via direct polarity rewriting. Our platform offers a scalable and versatile route for rapid prototyping of complementary electronics.

### Critical Density-Wave Vestigial Phases of Commensurate Pair Density Wave

The pair-density-wave (PDW) is an exotic pairing state hosting a spatially modulated pairing order parameter, which has attracted great interest. Due to its simultaneously breaking U(1)-gauge and translational symmetries, intriguing vestigial phases which restore only one broken symmetry can emerge at an intermediate temperature regime. Previously, investigations on the vestigial phases of PDW were mainly focused on incommensurate PDW. However, the experimentally observed PDW is usually commensurate, whose vestigial phases have not been systematically investigated. Here we study the vestigial phases of 2D commensurate PDW with $n$-times expanded unit vectors, hosting different numbers of wave vectors. Based on the Ginzburg-Landau theory, we get the low energy effective model Hamiltonian. Subsequent renormalization group (RG) and Monte-Carlo (MC) studies are conducted to obtain the phase diagram and spatial dependent correlation functions. Our RG and MC calculations consistently yield the following result. For $n\le 4$, besides the charge-4e/2e superconductivity, there exists the translational symmetry broken charge-density-wave (CDW) vetigial phase. Intriguingly, for $n\ge 5$, the restore of the translational symmetry with increasing temperature is realized through two successive Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions. Such a two-step process leads into two critical vestigial phases, i.e. the critical-PDW and the critical-CDW phases, in which the discrete translational symmetry is quasily broken, leading into a power-law decaying density-density correlation even at 2D. Our work appeals for experimental verifications.

Coarse-grained (CG) modeling enables molecular simulations to reach time and length scales inaccessible to fully atomistic methods. For classical CG models, the choice of mapping, that is, how atoms are grouped into CG sites, is a major determinant of accuracy and transferability. At the same time, the emergence of machine learning potentials (MLPs) offers new opportunities to build CG models that can in principle learn the true potential of the mean force for any mapping. In this work, we systematically investigate how the choice of mapping influences the representations learned by equivariant MLPs by studying liquid hexane, amino acids, and polyalanine. We find that when the length scales of bonded and nonbonded interactions overlap, unphysical bond permutations can occur. We also demonstrate that correctly encoding species and maintaining stereochemistry are crucial, as neglecting either introduces unphysical symmetries. Our findings provide practical guidance for selecting CG mappings compatible with modern architectures and guide the development of transferable CG models.

A microscopic theory of odd viscosity in two-dimensional electron systems with smooth disorder and spin-orbit interaction is developed. It is shown that spin-orbit scattering gives rise to an off-diagonal component of the viscosity tensor. Hydrodynamic equations for spin and electric currents are derived for electrons interacting with smooth disorder. The contribution of odd viscosity to the anomalous Hall effect is calculated.

Characterizing anisotropic correlations in quantum and statistical systems requires a coordinate-invariant framework. We introduce a geometric map based on the local informational line element, calibrated by the Euclidean benchmark scale $C_{\mathrm{vac}}$: $ds^{2} = C_{\mathrm{vac}}/I(x,x+ε)$. We prove that this map yields a smooth Riemannian structure $g_{ij}$ if and only if the short-distance mutual information (MI) follows the anisotropic inverse-quadratic law (local exponent $X_{\text{loc}}=2$). A key insight is that anisotropy is necessary to activate tensor geometry; isotropic MI forces conformal flatness $g_{ij} \propto δ_{ij}$, suppressing shear degrees of freedom. We employ a parameterization-invariant unimodular split $g_{ij} = V^{2/D}γ_{ij}$, which rigorously separates local density fluctuations (volume $V$) from directional anisotropy (shape/shear $γ_{ij}$). We introduce ``MI Tomography,'' an operational protocol to reconstruct these geometric components from finite directional measurements. The protocol is validated using the equal-time ground state of an anisotropic 2D quantum harmonic lattice (massless relativistic scalar) on a torus, where the reconstructed shape tensor $γ_{ij}$ quantitatively recovers the physical coupling anisotropy. We work strictly in the local, fixed-coarse-graining $X_{\text{loc}}=2$ branch; the line element is used solely to extract the local kinematic structure (the local metric tensor), deferring global distance claims.

Interfaces are the key to next generation high energy batteries including solid state Li metal batteries. In solid state batteries, the buried nature of solid solid electrolyte electrode interfaces makes studying them difficult. Neutrons have significant potential to non destructively probe these buried solid solid interfaces. This work presents a comparative study using both neutron depth profiling (NDP) and neutron reflectometry (NR) to study a model lithium metal-lithium phosphorus oxynitride (LiPON) solid electrolyte system. In the NDP data, no distinct interphase is observed at the interface. NR shows a difference between electrodeposited, and vapor deposited LiPON -Li interfaces but finds both are gradient interphases that are less than 30 nm thick. Additional simulations of the LiPON-Li2O-Li system demonstrate that NDP has an excellent resolution in the 50 nm-1 mm regime while NR has an ideal resolution from 0.1 - 200 nm with different sample requirements.

We demonstrate that the subgap Andreev bound states in a transparent Josephson junction, comprising of either chiral or non-chiral superconductors, can be viewed as a consequence of the index theorem in supersymmetric quantum mechanics. We provide an exact solution for these states starting from the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) equations describing quasiparticles in such junctions. We demonstrate that the dispersion of these subgap states depends only on the asymptotic properties of the pair-potential and not on its local spatial variation. Our study reveals the crucial distinction between junctions of non-chiral $p$-wave superconductors and those of $s$-wave or chiral superconductors by analyzing the wavefunction of their subgap bound states. We find a stable topological response leading to the well-known $4π$ periodic Josephson effect protected against weak disorder potential for the non-chiral $p$-wave junctions; no such protection is found for junctions of $s$-wave or chiral superconductors. We supplement our analytic results with numerical computation of the Josephson currents in such junctions using exact numerical Green functions and starting from a lattice model of an itinerant altermagnet which is expected to host triplet $p$-wave superconductivity with equal-spin-pairing. We also discuss the implications of our results for Josephson junctions away from the transparent limit.

This pedagogical work presents the significant role that canonical transformation plays in the interpretation of the Abelian bosonized single-channel SU(2) Kondo model, emphasizing its effect on the scaling dimension $Δ$. The transformation shifts the longitudinal exchange coupling and modifies the scaling dimension of the spin-flip vertex $τ_{\pm} e^{\pm iβφ}$. Rather than fixing $Δ$ to the fermionic value $\tfrac{1}{2}$, we keep $α$ explicit, which allows us to identify how different choices lead to marginal or relevant regimes through $(1-Δ(α))J_\perp$. This approach offers a direct way to trace the scaling behavior from the bosonized Hamiltonian and shows how the RG flow connects to the definition of the Kondo temperature, where the resistance diverges, without switching to other methods.

We derived and implemented analytic first derivatives for Aufbau suppressed coupled cluster theory to calculate the one-body reduced density matrix, from which excited state natural orbitals and one-body properties, like atomic populations and dipole moments, are obtained. We utilized the natural orbitals to refine the ASCC solution for simple valence and Rydberg systems, exploring the process of repeatedly solving the ASCC equations in successive natural orbital bases to achieve independence from the starting molecular orbitals. For dipole moments in small molecules where high-level comparison data is available, we find that the accuracy of ASCC essentially matches that of linear response and equation-of-motion coupled cluster as long as care is taken to preserve the response's perturbative completeness.

In chiral magnets, the magnetic textures surrounding domain walls exhibit a rich variety of structures, offering insights into fundamental physics and potential applications in spintronic devices. Conical spirals and related structures possess intrinsic in-plane directionalities governed by phase factors $φ_0$, which are often obscured in long spirals due to cylindrical symmetry but become prominent in short spirals or thin films. Using micromagnetic simulations, we systematically studied magnetic textures at ferromagnetic-conical interfaces (FCI), including 1D and 2D FCIs with various shapes. Surface spirals (SS) emerge adjacent to these FCIs, closely linked to the cone's in-plane reorientation. In 1D FCIs, reorientation controls the presence, shape, and topological charge of the SS, with a discontinuity point observed where spirals with opposite charges form on opposite sides. In 2D FCIs, eyebrow-like SS are evident. The reorientation angle between top and bottom SS is controlled by the film thickness, similar to stacked spirals reported previously. We further demonstrate that SSs form at the facets of skyrmion clusters within the conical phase, as confirmed by both simulations and Lorentz transmission electron microscopy observations in Co$_8$Zn$_{10}$Mn$_2$ thin films. The experiments specifically reveal two distinct formation pathways: thermally activated co-growth and field-driven transformation from residual helices. These findings establish $φ_0$ as a fundamental control parameter for magnetic states, enabling promising spintronic functionalities such as multi-state memory through SS polymorphism and energy-efficient neuromorphic computing via controlled topological transitions.

### Strong zero modes in integrable spin-S chains

We derive exact strong zero mode (ESZM) operators for integrable spin-S chains with open boundary conditions and a boundary field. Their locality properties are generally weaker than in the previously known cases, but they still imply infinite coherence times in the vicinity of the edges. We explain how such integrable chains possess multiple ground states describing a first-order quantum phase transition, and that the odd number of such states for integer S makes the weaker locality properties necessary. We make contact with more traditional approaches by showing how the ESZM for S=1/2 acts on energy eigenstates given by solutions of the Bethe equations.

Arranging the stacking orders of A-type antiferromagnetic (A-AFM) bilayers offers an accessible pathway to two-dimensional altermagnets, but requires strict symmetry conditions such as layer groups, sliding positions, and twisting angles. Here, we find that circularly polarized light (CPL) irradiation breaks time-reversal symmetry, enabling the development of altermagnets beyond these constraints. Based on symmetrical analysis, our revealments indicate that A-AFM bilayer building-blocks with inversion symmetry exhibit altermagnetism robust to stacking sliding and variations of illumination directions. These bilayers can be constructed from arbitrary ferromagnetic monolayers and guided by the $d$-electron counting rule. Adopting bilayer MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ as a template, out-of-plane illumination with CPL reveals an $f$-wave altermagnetic feature at sliding positions $\left\{E|\left(0,0\right)\right\}$, $\left\{E|\left(\frac{1}{3},\frac{2}{3}\right)\right\}$ and $\left\{E|\left(\frac{2}{3},\frac{1}{3}\right)\right\}$, while a $p$-wave feature is predicted at other sliding positions. Our unveilings popularize the applicability of altermagnets in A-AFM bilayers with inversion symmetry, igniting a new wave of research in this field.

Understanding the interplay between charge order and lattice instability in quantum materials remains a central challenge, as their coexistence often obscures causal relationships. This work introduces $\mathrm{C}_6\mathrm{Li}$ as a novel platform to investigate charge order mediated by two distinct mechanisms. We show that the hybridization between carbon $π$ and lithium $s$ orbitals generates an effective long-range hopping within Li-centered hexagons. This hopping drives a Kekulé bond order, whose structure varies with charge density and the sign of the hopping. This bond order induces a Kekulé lattice distortion via electron-phonon coupling. In the limit where lithium atoms are distant from the graphene layer, a Fermi surface nesting-driven Kekulé bond order emerges, stabilized by the electron-phonon interaction. Our results establish $\mathrm{C}_6\mathrm{Li}$ as a tunable platform for elucidating the causal hierarchy between electronic and structural orders in quantum materials.

### Bidirectional Photoinduced Carrier Transfer in Fluorinated Quasi-2D Perovskites Governing Enhanced Photocurrent Generation

Quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) metal halide perovskites exhibit rich phase heterogeneity that profoundly influences light-matter interactions and charge transport. However, the fundamental mechanisms governing carrier transfer across distinct phases remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate effective electron-hole separation in fluorinated multilayered quasi-2D perovskite films nominally prepared for three layers, using femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. The films are revealed to comprise a heterogeneous phase distribution (with 1, 2, 3 layers and bulk) naturally stacked along the growth direction. Our ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements, show the type-two band alignment between the small-n (layer number) phases and the bulk. This alignment drives charge separation via both direct and sequential carrier transfer mechanisms, whereby electrons preferentially migrate into the bulk domains while holes accumulate in the small-n layers, extending even to single layer phase-a process only rarely observed in previous studies. The nearly symmetric transfer times of electrons and holes yield an efficient and balanced spatial separation of carriers. Global target analysis employing a carrier transfer model quantitatively reproduces the spectral evolution, providing a rigorous validation of the mechanism. Nonetheless, we found photocurrent enhancement in the diode devices of this quasi-2D perovskite as a consequence of the efficient transfer of photocarriers in the opposite directions. This work delivers a comprehensive picture of interphase charge transfer in fluorinated quasi-2D perovskites and highlights strategies to engineer directional separation pathways for high-performance photovoltaic, optoelectronic, and quantum devices.

Strain engineering enables precise, energy-efficient control of nanoscale magnetism. However, unlike well-studied strain-dislocation interactions in mechanical deformation, the spatial evolution of strain-induced spin rearrangement remains poorly understood. Using \emph{in situ} Lorentz transmission electron microscopy, we manipulate and observe helical domain reorientation under quantitatively applied uniaxial tensile stress. Our findings reveal striking similarity to plastic deformation in metals, where the critical stress for propagation vector (\emph{\textbf{Q}}) reorientation depends on its angle with the stress direction. Magnetic defects mediate reorientation via "break-and-reconnect" or "dislocation gliding-annihilation" processes. Simulations confirm that strain-induced anisotropic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction may play a key role. These insights advance strain-driven magnetism and offer a promising route for energy-efficient magnetic nanophase control in next-generation information technology.

We study the phase-ordering dynamics of a quasi-classical Holstein model. At half-filling, the zero-temperature ground state is a commensurate charge-density-wave (CDW) with alternating occupied and empty sites. This quasi-classical formulation enables us to isolate the role of electrons in coarsening dynamics. Following a thermal quench, CDW domains grow through the diffusion and annihilation of kinks -- topological defects separating the two symmetry-related CDW orders. While standard diffusive dynamics predicts domain sizes scaling as the square root of time, our large-scale simulations reveal a slower power-law growth with a temperature-dependent exponent. We trace this anomalous behavior to a cooperative kink hopping arising from Fermi-Dirac statistics of electrons and quasi-conservation of electron numbers. The correlated-hopping of kinks in turn gives rise to an effective diffusion coefficient that depends on the kink density. These results uncover a new mechanism for slow coarsening and carry implications for phase-ordering in the full Holstein model and related electron-phonon systems.

Antiperovskite nitrides with the general formula M$_3$N have attracted significant attention due to their tunable electronic and magnetic properties. Among them are many cobalt-based compounds predicted to exhibit high thermodynamic stability and intriguing magnetic behavior. Here, we report the synthesis and magnetic characterization of epitaxial Co$_3$ZnN thin films grown by radio frequency sputtering on SrTiO$_3$ (STO) and MgO substrates. X-ray diffraction confirms phase-pure (00l)-oriented films with cube-on-cube epitaxy on STO, with a c-lattice parameter of 3.752 angstroms. Magnetic measurements reveal clear hysteresis at 2 K with a coercive field of ~ 0.12 T and a small net moment of 0.11 $μ_B$/f.u., suggesting either a canted antiferromagnetic (AFM) or ferrimagnetic (FiM) configuration. Temperature-dependent magnetization measurements show a transition near 25 K, with strong AFM interactions (Curie-Weiss $Θ$ = -80.6 K) at high temperatures and short-range ferromagnetic correlations ($Θ$ = +9.7 K) emerging near the transition. Complementary density functional theory (DFT) and Monte Carlo simulations indicate a ferromagnetic (FM) ground state, with the FM-AFM energy difference decreasing systematically with increasing supercell size, consistent with competition between FM and AFM/FiM interactions. These results highlight Co$_3$ZnN as a magnetically complex antiperovskite nitride with competing exchange interactions.

We investigate the influence of correlations and plasmonic excitation on valence band-satellite of $α$-Fe, along with magnetic and spectral properties as function of temperature. Coulomb interaction parameters are obtained by systematically employing various schemes in constrained random phase approximation (cRPA). This study identifies the presence of valence band satellite in Fe at $\sim$6 eV binding energy supported by (i) substantial incoherent spectral weight in the valence band spectra obtained from Density Functional Theory plus Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DFT+DMFT) and (ii) plasmonic excitations in the frequency range $\sim$6-8 eV suggested by $G_0W_0$ calculations. We note presence of significant contribution of temperature-dependent Pauli-spin susceptibility indicating competing degree of itinerancy. $e_g$ state shows a strong temperature driven non-Fermi-liquid behavior emerging near $T_c$. Our results reveal a high-temperature orbital-selective loss of coherence eventually leads to a orbital selective collapse of magnetization at $T_c$, suggesting a ferromagnetic phase characterized by strong correlation- and temperature- dependent spectral features.

We address that a single-band tight-binding Hamiltonian defined on a self-similar corral substrate can give rise to a set of non-diffusive localized modes that follow the same hierarchical distribution. As the lattice, the spatial extent of quantum prison containing a cluster of atomic sites is dependent on the generation of fractal structure. Apart from the quantum imprisonment of the excitation, a magnetic flux threading each elementary plaquette is shown to destroy the boundedness and generate an absolutely continuous sub-band populated by resonant eigen functions. Flux induced engineering of quantum states is corroborated through the evaluation of inverse participation ratio and quantum transport. Moreover, the robustness of the extended states has been checked in presence of diagonal disorder and off-diagonal anisotropy. Flux modulated single-particle mobility edge is characterized through mutlifractal analysis. Quantum interference is the essential issue, reported here, that manipulates the kinematics of the excitation and this is manifested by the workout of persistent current.

Entropy production is arguably the most universally applicable measure of non-equilibrium behavior, particularly for systems coupled to a heat bath. This setting encompasses driven soft matter as well as biomolecular, biochemical, and biophysical systems. Despite its central role, direct measurements of entropy production remain challenging - especially in small systems dominated by fluctuations. The main difficulty arises because not all degrees of freedom contributing to entropy production are experimentally accessible. A key question, therefore, is how to infer entropy production from coarse-grained observations, such as time series of experimentally measurable variables. Over the past decade, stochastic thermodynamics has provided several inequalities that yield model-free lower bounds on entropy production from such coarse-grained data. The major approaches rely on observations of coarse-grained states, fluctuating currents or ticks, correlation functions of coarse-grained observables, and waiting-time distributions between so-called Markovian events, which correspond to transitions between mesoscopic states. Here, we systematically review these techniques valid under the sole assumption of a Markovian, i.e., memoryless, dynamics on an underlying, not necessarily observable, network of states or following a possibly high-dimensional Langevin equation. We discuss in detail the large class of non-equilibrium steady states and highlight extensions of these methods to time-dependent and relaxing systems. While our focus is on mean entropy production, we also summarize recent progress in quantifying entropy production along individual coarse-grained trajectories.

- **TL;DR**: 使用无碳溴化镓/铝前驱体替代传统含碳三甲基前驱体，在工业CVD系统中生长GaN和AlN层，显著降低了碳相关缺陷。

The epitaxial growth of group 13-nitride semiconductors (GaN, AlN, and AlGaN alloys) for the mass production and fabrication of high-frequency and high-power devices relies on metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) using metal-organic molecules, also called precursors. While this growth method ensures high productivity and low operation costs compared to other methods, its most significant disadvantage lies in the presence of carbon atoms in the precursors, which are unavoidably incorporated into the epitaxial layers and hamper the performance of most types of fabricated devices. Carbon-free precursors for the CVD process could enhance the performance of high-frequency and high-power nitride-based devices while maintaining growth capability in industrial equipment. In this work, we implement gallium- and aluminum-brominated precursors, which contain no carbon atoms, to grow GaN and AlN layers in an industrial CVD system. We compare the results of this alternative CVD process with the conventional method using trimethyl precursors through several characterization techniques, indicating a clear reduction in optically active carbon-related defects.

Understanding how microscopic interactions control macroscopic phase transitions is central to quantum materials, where charge density waves (CDWs), Mott states, and superconductivity often compete. In $1T$-TaS$_2$, this competition is tied to a sequence of CDW phases and a hysteretic metal-insulator transition, but details of the transition, especially the role of interlayer coupling, remain unresolved. In this work, spectroscopic ellipsometry is used to determine the uniaxial dielectric response of bulk $1T$-TaS$_2$ from room temperature down to the commensurate insulating state. The room-temperature data reveal natural type-II hyperbolic behavior in the visible range, with negative in-plane and positive out-of-plane permittivity. Temperature-dependent ellipsometry combined with anisotropic Bruggeman effective medium analysis shows that the metallic domains responsible for percolation evolve from disc-like to needle-like shapes, and that, upon heating, an additional intermediate phase emerges. These results identify the transition in $1T$-TaS$_2$ as a three-dimensional, interlayer-driven percolation process and establish this material as a natural, tunable hyperbolic medium.

Flexible electronics and neuromorphic computing face key challenges in material integration and function retention. In particular, freestanding membranes suffer from slow sacrificial layer removal and interfacial strain, while neuromorphic hardware often relies on area-intensive dual-device schemes for bipolar synaptic weights. Here, we present a universal strategy based on water-soluble Sr4Al2O7 sacrificial layers, enabling the rapid release of freestanding ferrimagnetic metal membranes, which exhibit deterministic spin-orbit torque switching characteristics with well-preserved perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and are potential for next-generation ultrafast information technology. Extending this approach, we realize single-device ferrimagnetic synapses exhibiting intrinsic bipolar resistive switching. When implemented in a ResNet-18 architecture, these devices achieve 92% accuracy on CIFAR-10 - comparable to floating-point software models - while halving device counts relative to differential-pair implementations. These results establish a scalable platform linking flexible spintronics with compact, high-performance neuromorphic systems, offering foundational advances for next-generation electronics and brain-inspired hardware.

The discrete nonlinear Schrödinger equation (DNLSE) exhibits a transition from ergodic, delocalized dynamics to a weakly nonergodic regime characterized by breather formation; yet, a precise characterization of this transition has remained elusive. By sampling many microcanonically equivalent initial conditions, we identify the asymptotic ensemble variance of the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy as a dynamical order parameter that vanishes in the ergodic phase and becomes finite once ergodicity is broken. The relaxation time governing the ensemble convergence of the KS entropy displays an essential singularity at the transition, yielding a sharp boundary between the two dynamical regimes. This framework provides a trajectory-independent method for detecting ergodicity breaking that is broadly applicable to nonlinear lattice systems with conserved quantities.

Two-dimensional (2D) quartic dispersion materials are known to develop magnetization upon doping. Here we conduct a systematic investigation of magnetization in hole-doped quartic dispersion materials (GaS, InSe, TiO$_{2}$), focusing on the effects of structural confinement from 2D monolayers to quasi-one-dimensional nanoribbons (NRs). Upon hole doping, these NRs develop itinerant magnetization across a broad range of carrier densities and display half-metallic behavior. The spin-polarization energies ($E_{sp}$) of these NRs enhance remarkably relative to their 2D counterparts, with maximum increase being in the case of TiO$_{2}$ from 31 to 103 meV/carrier. The $E_{sp}$ strongly depends on the degree of localization of the magnetic moments along the width of NRs, which is determined by edge passivation and ribbon width. Strong deformation of the topmost valence bands at higher dopings indicates deviation from the Stoner mechanism.

- **TL;DR**: 合成了CsPbCl3和PbS纳米晶异质结构，通过Mn2+离子和特定硫源抑制副产物，实现I型能带对齐，并可进一步通过选择性离子交换制备第二代异质结构。

We report the synthesis of nanocrystal heterostructures composed of CsPbCl3 and PbS domains sharing an epitaxial interface. We were able to promote the growth of a PbS domain (in competition with the more commonly observed Pb4S3Cl2 one) on top of the CsPbCl3 domain by employing Mn2$^+$ ions, the latter acting most likely as scavengers of Cl$^-$ ions. Complete suppression of the Pb4S3Cl2 domain growth was then achieved by additionally selecting an appropriate sulfur source (bis(trimethylsilyl)sulfide, which also acted as scavenger of Cl$^-$ ions), and reaction temperature. In the heterostructures, emission from the perovskite domain was quenched, while emission from the PbS domain was observed, pointing to a type-I band alignment, as confirmed by calculations. These heterostructures in turn could be exploited to prepare second-generation heterostructures through selective ion exchange on the individual domains (halide ion exchange on CsPbCl3, cation exchange on PbS). We demonstrate the cases of Cl$^-$ to Br$^-$ and Pb2$^+$ to Cu$^+$ exchanges, which deliver CsPbBr3@PbS and CsPbCl3@Cu2-xS epitaxial heterostructures, respectively.

Rydberg excitons in two-dimensional semiconductors provide sensitive and non-destructive probes of physics in proximal sample layers that host correlated electronic states. In particular, electron or hole doping of the sample layer is heralded by a strong frequency shift and loss of transition strength of 2s excitons in the sensor layer; these features have been attributed to the formation of a bound state of a 2s exciton and a remote electron. Through a theoretical analysis of exciton-electron scattering, we show that the experimental spectra can only be explained by electron-mediated hybridization of 2s, 2p and interlayer excitons, leading to a new type of many-body state which we term Rydberg attractive polaron. We anticipate that this new understanding will ensure a more accurate assessment of the signatures of correlated electrons in two dimensional materials.

- **TL;DR**: 通过极端拉伸应变在反铁磁体CrSb中同时实现平带物理和轨道选择性自旋织构，建立了应变-对称性-关联性相图

Correlated flat bands and altermagnetism are two important directions in quantum materials, centred respectively on interaction-dominated phases and symmetry-enforced spin-textured states, yet both derive from lattice symmetry and orbital hybridization. This common origin implies that extreme crystal distortion, by narrowing bandwidths, enhancing correlations and reshaping the symmetries of altermagnetic spin splittings, could unify flat-band and altermagnetic physics in a single material; in practice, however, achieving such large distortions in a crystalline altermagnet is a formidable challenge. Here we combine a dedicated strain device with a tailored single-crystal mounting scheme to impose a highly tensile strain gradient in bulk CrSb, a prototypical altermagnet, creating a near-surface layer in which the in-plane lattice is strongly distorted relative to the weakly strained bulk, while the average bulk distortion remains small. Angle-resolved photoemission reveals a reversible regime at moderate strain, where a deeper flat-band feature, attributed to a strain-gradient-driven suppression of Cr-Sb hybridization, coexists with a correlation-enhanced Cr 3d flat band, and an irreversible regime at larger strain where partial bond decoupling drives a predominantly insulating spectral response. Density-functional calculations show that an orbital-selective altermagnetic spin texture persists across this correlated regime despite strong bandwidth renormalisation. These results define a strain-symmetry-correlation map for CrSb and establish extreme tensile strain as a route to co-engineer flat-band tendencies and spin-textured, zero-net-moment correlated states in altermagnets, pointing toward strain-adaptive, spin-selective Mott filtering and related device concepts.

- **TL;DR**: 二维Ruddlesden-Popper混合相钙钛矿中观察到自旋极化，源于Rashba效应，极化子保护自旋极化激子实现高效自旋保持能量传输

Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) exhibit pronounced spin-orbit coupling (SOC) as a result of their heavy metal constituents, leading to distinctive electronic properties such as Rashba type band splitting which make them promising candidates for next generation spintronic applications. Here, using circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) and polarization dependent pump-probe spectroscopy, we found that spin polarization is present across all phases of our two-dimensional (2D) Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) mixed-phase perovskites, (C6H7SNH3)2 (CH3NH3)n-1PbnI3n+1 (n=1-4), irrespective of the number of inorganic layers. The origin of these spin polarized bands is attributed to the Rashba effect. Interestingly, the highly disordered nature of this system facilitates remarkably efficient ultrafast funneling of photoexcited spin-polarized excitons from the pure 2D phase (n=1) to higher-n phases at room temperature. We demonstrate that significant polaron formation due to the inherent soft crystal lattice and higher exciton-phonon interaction is responsible for the observed spin funneling effect in mixed-phase 2D RP perovskites. Polaron act as a protective mechanism for spin-polarized excitons, preserving their spin information through the screening of omnipresent phonon-induced momentum scattering. These findings not only offer valuable guidance for the design of 2D RP perovskites with pronounced Rashba effects but also unveil a compelling class of solution-processed perovskites capable of efficient spin-preserving energy transport at room temperature.

Nonlinear transport has emerged as a powerful approach to probe the quantum geometry of electronic wavefunctions, such as Berry curvature and quantum metric, in topological materials. While nonlinear responses governed by bulk quantum geometry and band topology are well understood, the role of boundary modes (e.g., edge, surface, and hinge states) in nonlinear transport of topological materials remains largely unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate boundary-bulk interplay in nonlinear transport, including second-harmonic Hall and nonreciprocal longitudinal responses, in molecular beam epitaxy-grown magnetic topological insulator heterostructures. We find that the nonlinear transport is maximized when the sample is tuned slightly away from the well-quantized states, including the quantum anomalous Hall and axion insulator states. The sign and amplitude of the nonlinear transport depend on electrode configuration, magnetic order, and carrier type, establishing boundary mode transport as the dominant contributor. These findings, supported by symmetry analysis and nonlinear Landauer-Büttiker formalism, demonstrate that nonlinear transport in topological materials is governed by the interplay between boundary and bulk states. We further derive a universal relation between different lead voltages from electrode geometry symmetry, which allows us to distinguish nonlinear boundary transport from bulk contributions. Our work highlights the critical role of electrodes in nonlinear transport, which is absent in nonlinear optics, and establishes boundary modes as a key origin of the giant nonlinear response in nearly bulk-insulating topological materials. This insight opens new opportunities for engineering nonlinear transport through boundary-bulk interplay in future device applications of topological materials.

Graph neural networks (GNNs) are designed to extract latent patterns from graph-structured data, making them particularly well suited for crystal representation learning. Here, we propose a GNN model tailored for estimating electronic transport coefficients in inorganic thermoelectric crystals. The model encodes crystal structures and physicochemical properties in a multiscale manner, encompassing global, atomic, bond, and angular levels. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets with remarkable extrapolative capability. By combining the proposed GNN with \textit{ab initio} calculations, we successfully identify compounds exhibiting outstanding electronic transport properties and further perform interpretability analyses from both global and atomic perspectives, tracing the origins of their distinct transport behaviors. Interestingly, the decision process of the model naturally reveals underlying physical patterns, offering new insights into computer-assisted materials design.

- **TL;DR**: 开发了磷基配体TTP-Br用于CsPbBr3纳米晶表面处理，显著提升了光致发光量子效率和空气稳定性，并实现了高效发光二极管

In this study, we synthesised a phosphonium-based ligand, trimethyl(tetradecyl)phosphonium bromide (TTP-Br), and employed it in the post-synthesis surface treatment of Cs-oleate-capped CsPbBr3 NCs. The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of the NCs increased from 60% to more than 90%, as a consequence of replacing Cs-oleate with TTP-Br ligand pairs. Density functional theory calculations revealed that TTP+ ions bind to the NC surface by occupying Cs+ surface sites and orienting one of their P-CH3 bonds perpendicular to the surface, akin to quaternary ammonium passivation. Importantly, TTP-Br-capped NCs exhibited higher stability in air compared to didodecyldimethylammonium bromide-capped CsPbBr3 NCs (which is considered a benchmark system), retaining 90% of their PLQY after six weeks of air exposure. Light-emitting diodes fabricated with TTP-Br-capped NCs achieved a maximum external quantum efficiency of 17.2 %, demonstrating the potential of phosphonium-based molecules as surface ligands for CsPbBr3 NCs in optoelectronic applications.

The structure and transport of electrolytes in nanoscale channels are known to be affected by the electronic properties of the confining walls. This influence is particularly pronounced in quasi-one-dimensional nanotubes, where the high surface-to-volume ratio makes the wall the dominant source of electrostatic screening. For instance, ideal metallic tubes suppress long-range Coulomb interactions between ions exponentially. Yet, there exists no generic framework for evaluating electrostatic interactions in tubular confinement. Here, we introduce tubular response functions - a generalisation of surface response functions that captures how nanotubes with arbitrary electronic properties screen Coulomb interactions. Using this framework, we evaluate the interaction potential of ions confined in a metallic carbon nanotube, treating its electronic properties exactly within a Luttinger liquid model. We demonstrate that the long-range exponential screening characteristic of ideal metals persists in realistic metallic nanotubes, regardless of their electron density. We trace the origin of this perfect screening property to the quantum confinement of electrons along the tube circumference. Our framework opens the way for quantitative descriptions of ionic correlations and charge storage in nanotube-based electrodes, and can be further extended to address confined ion dynamics.

Understanding energy level alignment at organic interfaces is crucial for optimizing the performance of organic devices. Interface dipole and band bending significantly influence carrier recombination and generation mechanisms. A method of simulating energy level alignment at metal/organic and organic/organic interfaces by assuming a thermal equilibrium model has been proposed, but its validation against experimental methods is still limited. In this study, the work function change in the $α$-NPD/HAT-CN/Au interface was measured as a typical donor/acceptor system using a rotary Kelvin probe (RKP). Our findings demonstrate good agreement with simulations only at metal/organic interfaces which have "active" charge transfer. It is suggested that thermal equilibrium is not achieved simply by depositing the film under dark condition, and some treatment to supply carriers, such as exposure to UV light, is necessary for accurate evaluation. At the organic/organic interface, the the experimental results did not agree with thermal equilibrium model, highlighting the need to consider substrate-driven carrier supply and polarization effects when evaluating energy level alignment.

### Evidence for strong localization of orbital polarization

Whether orbital polarization propagates has become the most essential question of the blooming orbitronics that aims to generate non-local orbital torque and orbital pumping. Recent theories have suggested a strong orbital Hall effect within the light metal Al and a strong orbital Rashba effect at Co/Al interfaces, providing ideal platforms for experimental verification of possible orbital transport effects. Here, we report robust experimental evidence for the strong localization of orbital polarization. We demonstrate that neither the bulk nor the interface of the Al contributes a detectable orbital torque on adjacent magnetic layer with strong bulk and interfacial spin-orbit coupling necessary for potential orbital-spin conversion. These results have clarified that orbital polarization undergoes much faster relaxation than spin polarization and hardly participates in non-local accumulation, transport, or torque generation. The experimental evidence for strong localization of orbital polarization represents a groundbreaking advance towards solving the essential orbital torque debate.

III-V colloidal quantum dots are widely studied for their applications as detectors and emitters from visible to short-wave infrared. They might also be used in the mid-infrared if they can be stably n-doped to access their intraband transitions. Mid-infrared intraband transitions are therefore studied for InAs, InAs/InP, and InAs/ZnSe colloidal quantum dots with an energy gap at 1.4 micron. Using electrochemistry, the quantum dot films show state-resolved mobility, state-resolved electron filling, and intraband absorption in the 3-8 micron range. The InAs/ZnSe films need a more reducing potential than InAs, but the InAs/InP films need a lower reduction potential. As a result, we found that dry films of InAs/InP dots show stable n-doping of the 1Se state, with a steady-state intraband absorption in the 3-5 micron range, and intraband luminescence at 5 micron. low-toxicity, high thermal stability, and stable n-doping, InAs quantum dots become an interesting material for mid-infrared applications.

- **TL;DR**: 首次在陨石六方金刚石中发现新型光致发光色心缺陷RU1，具有明亮稳定的550-800nm发射光谱，为量子技术提供了新的晶体平台。

Lonsdaleite -- hexagonal diamond -- has only recently been proposed as a wide-bandgap host capable of supporting optically active point defects, but no such centres have yet been observed. Here we provide the first experimental evidence that lonsdaleite does in fact host photoluminescent color centres. In meteoritic lonsdaleite grains from the ureilite NWA7983, we identify a new defect, RU1, which exhibits bright and stable emission across 550-800 nm, with optimal blue excitation (~455 nm) and a peak at ~700 nm. Time-resolved photoluminescence reveals an excited-state lifetime of 14 ns with no detectable blinking, bleaching, or charge conversion. From the excitation-emission energetics we infer an unresolved zero-phonon line near 550 nm. Correlative electron microscopy confirms the lonsdaleite host lattice, and compositional analysis suggests N, Si, or Ni as plausible defect constituents. These results suggest lonsdaleite could become a new quantum-grade crystalline platform and indicate that hexagonal-diamond color centres may form a new and unexplored family of solid-state quantum emitters.

- **TL;DR**: 利用CsPbCl3-Pb4S3Cl2异质结构研究Cl-I交换，获得分段CsPbI3-CsPbCl3-Pb4S3Cl2异质结构，实现晶格渐变和界面应变调节

Halide exchange in lead-based halide perovskites has been studied extensively. While mixed Cl-Br or Br-I alloy compositions can be formed with no miscibility gaps, this is precluded for mixed Cl-I compositions, due to the large difference in Cl and I ionic radii. Here, we exploit perovskite-chalcohalide CsPbCl3-Pb4S3Cl2 heterostructures to study the Cl-I exchange and isolate new types of intermediate structures. The epitaxial interface between the Pb4S3Cl2 chalcohalide and the CsPbCl3 perovskite domain significantly influences the intermediate stages of halide exchange in the perovskite domain, leading to coexisting CsPbCl3 and CsPbI3 domains, thereby delivering segmented CsPbI3-CsPbCl3-Pb4S3Cl2 energetically favorable heterostructures, with partial iodide alloying of the CsPbCl3 domain and at the perovskite-chalcohalide interface. The I:CsPbCl3 domain between CsPbI3 and Pb4S3Cl2 enables a gradual lattice expansion across the heterostructure. This design accommodates interfacial strain, with a 5.6% mismatch at the CsPbCl3-CsPbI3 interface and a 3.4% mismatch at the perovskite-chalcohalide interface. Full halide exchange leads to CsPbI3-Pb4S3Cl2 heterostructures. Both in intermediate and fully exchanged heterostructures, the CsPbI3 domain is emissive. In the intermediate structures, the band alignment between the two perovskite domains is type-I, with carriers photogenerated in the CsPbCl3 domain quickly transferring to the CsPbI3 domain, where they can recombine radiatively.

The discovery of quantized Chern numbers in twisted transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) homobilayers,including 3.7{deg} twisted MoTe2 and 1.23{deg} twisted WSe2,has emerged as a defining breakthrough in physics. A striking and unresolved puzzle from these studies is the unexpected opposite sign of the observed Chern numbers between the two systems. Recent theory has proposed a twist-angle-dependent Chern number sign reversal in both twisted MoTe2 and WSe2, offering a potential explanation for the disparate experimental observations6. However, a direct experimental verification of the twist-angle-dependent Chern number sign reversal in a specific twisted TMD homobilayer is still elusive. Here, we report the first experimental demonstration that the Chern numbers of the moire frontier bands undergo sign reversal at a critical twist angle 1.42{deg} in twisted WSe2 bilayers (tWSe2). Using scanning tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopy, we direct measure layer-pseudospin skyrmion textures of tWSe2 and our results reveal that tWSe2 in the vicinity of the 1.42{deg} exhibits a twist-angle-dependent layer-pseudospin polarization, an effect that serves as the fundamental origin of the observed Chern number sigh reversal6-12.

Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) based on halide perovskite nanocrystals have attracted extensive attention due to their considerable luminescence efficiency, wide color gamut, high color purity, and facile material synthesis. Since the first demonstration of LEDs based on MAPbBr3 nanocrystals were reported in 2014, the community has witnessed a rapid development in their performances.

We then review the basic characteristics and emission mechanisms of lead-free perovskite and perovskite-related nanocrystals emitters in environmentally friendly LEDs, from the standpoint of different emission colors. Finally, we cover the progress in LED applications and provide an outlook of the opportunities and challenges for future developments in this field.

Van der Waals heterostructures are a core tool in quantum material design. The recent addition of monolayer ferroelectrics expands the possibilities of designer materials. Ferroelectric domains can be manipulated using electric fields, thus opening a route for external control over material properties. In this paper we explore the possibility of engineering magneto-electric coupling in ferroelectric heterostructures by studying the interface of bilayer SnTe with iron phthalocyanine molecules as a model system. The molecules act as sensor spins, allowing us to sample the magneto-electric coupling with nanometer precision through scanning tunneling microscopy. Our measurements uncover a structural, and therefore material-independent and intrinsic, mechanism to couple electric and magnetic degrees of freedom at the nanoscale.

All-electrical methods for nucleating, detecting, and manipulating spin textures in two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) magnets can serve as fundamental building blocks for multi-state spintronic memory, logic, and neuromorphic computing applications. Unlike conventional ferromagnets, vdW ferromagnets such as Fe5GeTe2 with strong Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions stabilize nanoscale chiral spin textures, including skyrmions and stripe domains. However, the sub-100 nm size of these spin textures has limited their study to sophisticated microscopy techniques. Here, we demonstrate all-electrical detection of spin textures in vdW itinerant ferromagnet Fe5GeTe2 using pure spin transport in a lateral graphene spin-valve device at room temperature. By engineering nanoscale constrictions or notches in Fe5GeTe2, we create spin textures that inject distinct spin polarizations into the graphene channel, where they are nonlocally sensed by a reference conventional ferromagnetic detector at room temperature. This enables the observation of anomalous multi-level spin-valve switching and Hanle spin precession signals, which are due to unique spin textures in Fe5GeTe2 and in sharp contrast to single-domains and conventional magnet-based devices. This all-electrical approach can provide direct access to the spin textures on an integrated 2D spintronic circuit without the need for ex-situ microscopic characterizations.

Near-Infrared (NIR) light emitting metal halides are emerging as a new generation of optical materials owing to their appealing features, which include low-cost synthesis, solution processability and adjustable optical properties. NIR emitting perovskite-based light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have reached an external quantum efficiency (EQE) over 20% and a device stability of over 10,000 h. Such results have sparked an interest in exploring new NIR metal halide emitters. In this review, we summarize several different types of NIR-emitting metal halides, including lead/tin bromide/iodide perovskites, lanthanide ions doped/based metal halides, double perovskites, low dimensional hybrid and Bi3+/Sb3+/Cr3+ doped metal halides, and assess their recent advancements. The characteristics and mechanisms of narrow-band or broadband NIR luminescence in all these materials are discussed in detail. We also highlight the various applications of NIR-emitting metal halides and provide an outlook for the field.

Spectrum tomography for the energy ($E$) of a ring-shaped Bose-Hubbard circuit is illustrated. There is an inter-particle interaction $U$ that controls superfluidity (SF) and the transition to the Mott Insulator (MI) regime. The circuit is coupled to an electromagnetic cavity mode of frequency $ω_0$, and the coupling is characterized by a generalized fine-structure-constant $α$ that controls the emergence of superconductivity (SC). The ${(U,α,ω_0,E)}$ diagram features SF and SC regions, a vast region of fragmented possibly chaotic states, and an MI regime for large $U$. The mesoscopic version of the Meissner effect and the Anderson-Higgs mechanism are discussed.

- **TL;DR**: 合成了乙铵铅碘化物(EAPbI3)胶体纳米晶，这是铅卤化物钙钛矿家族的新成员。尽管含有超大A位阳离子(274pm)，但仍能形成钙钛矿结构，但稳定性极差，一天内即转变为非钙钛矿相。其光致发光量子产率低(约1%)，但可通过尺寸调控发射波长(664-690nm)，通过A位合金化可改善性能。

We report the synthesis of ethylammonium lead iodide (EAPbI3) colloidal nanocrystals as another member of the lead halide perovskites family. The insertion of an unusually large A-cation (274 pm in diameter) in the perovskite structure, hitherto considered unlikely due to the unfavorable Goldschmidt tolerance factor, results in a significantly larger lattice parameter compared to the Cs-, methylammonium- and formamidinium-based lead halide perovskite homologues. As a consequence, EAPbI3 nanocrystals are highly unstable, evolving to a non-perovskite delta-EAPbI3 polymorph within one day. Also, EAPbI3 nanocrystals are very sensitive to electron irradiation and quickly degrade to PbI2 upon exposure to the electron beam, following a mechanism similar to that of other hybrid lead iodide perovskites (although degradation can be reduced by partially replacing the EA+ ions with Cs+ ions). Interestingly, in some cases during this degradation the formation of an epitaxial interface between (EAxCs1-x)PbI3 and PbI2 is observed. The photoluminescence emission of the EAPbI3 perovskite nanocrystals, albeit being characterized by a low quantum yield (around 1%), can be tuned in the 664-690 nm range by regulating their size during the synthesis. The emission efficiency can be improved upon partial alloying at the A site with Cs+ or formamidinium cations. Furthermore, the morphology of the EAPbI3 nanocrystals can be chosen to be either nanocube or nanoplatelet, depending on the synthesis conditions.

Harvesting low-grade heat to electricity is attractive for powering wearable electronic devices. Here, we demonstrate nW-scale thermoelectric power generation in devices from thin film assemblies of microwave-synthesized p-Sb2Te3 nanoplates and n-Ag2Te nanowires on polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. While microwave cycling is crucial for Ag2Te nanocrystal shaping, Sb2Te3 formation is sensitive to precursors and surfactant concentrations. Introducing S doping in Sb2Te3 in the 1 - 1.5 atomic percent range via thioglycolic acid during synthesis yields an up to eightfold higher power-factor, due to a fivefold increase in electrical conductivity and 25% increase in Seebeck coefficient. Our microfilm devices generate up to 33.6 mV from 5 deg C to 50 deg C thermal gradients, with 120 nW maximum power output at Delta T 30 deg C, which is sixtyfold higher than Sb2Te3 paper devices. Mechanical bending can increase device resistance by up to 125% due to diminished inter-nanostructure electronic transport. These findings provide insights for integrating synthesis, morphology engineering and device design for next-generation wearable thermoelectric systems.

Gilbert damping-the primary obstacle limiting spin-wave propagation in magnonic devices-can be transformed from an adversary into an asset. Here we demonstrate 175-fold spin-wave amplitude amplification in ultrathin films with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy at temporal interfaces associated with a field-driven transition between a uniform in-plane state and a stripe-domain state, exceeding existing parametric and spin-torque schemes (10-50-fold) without a continuous power supply. When the in-plane bias field is swept through a critical value in the presence of finite Gilbert damping, the spin-wave dispersion undergoes dramatic softening, and the eigenfrequency crosses zero and acquires a positive imaginary part that drives exponential growth. We identify this as a damping-induced instability operating near an exceptional point-a non-Hermitian degeneracy where, counterintuitively, increased Gilbert damping enhances amplification. This mechanism exploits ingredients specific to these magnetic films: the interplay of Gilbert damping, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya-interaction-induced nonreciprocity, and field-driven phase transitions-a combination that, to our knowledge, has no direct counterpart in photonic or acoustic time-varying platforms. Our analytical framework provides explicit design rules, while micromagnetic simulations capture the full nonlinear dynamics, including stripe-domain formation. This work establishes temporal magnonics as a new paradigm for reconfigurable, lithography-free spin-wave control.

Quadruple perovskites ACu$_3$Fe$_2$Re$_2$O$_{12}$ attract considerable interest due to their high Curie temperatures (up to $710$K), which strongly depend on the A-site cation. In this work, we employ first-principles calculations to investigate their electronic structure and magnetic exchange interactions. A band mechanism of magnetism that explains the antiferromagnetic character of the exchange interactions and their strong dependence on the filling of the Re $t_{2g}$ states is proposed. These antiferromagnetic interactions stabilize ferrimagnetic ground state. The calculated Curie temperatures, obtained within the Onsager reaction field theory, are in a good agreement with experimental data.

We study the interplay between a Coulomb impurity and quasiholes in a fractional quantum Hall (FQH) state at finite temperatures. While a repulsive impurity can pin a quasihole and stabilize the FQH state, an attractive impurity cannot bind quasiholes. We demonstrate that at finite temperatures, a quasihole can be thermally ionized from a repulsive impurity, resulting in an ionization phase transition. We propose an experimental setup using exciton sensing to detect such a thermal ionization of quasiholes.

Topological quasiparticles, such as merons and bimerons, are characterized by non-trivial textures that exhibit remarkably robust transport against deformation, offering significant potential for information processing. While these phenomena have been explored in various systems, acoustic realizations remain challenging. Here, we report that acoustic meron topological textures were successfully realized using designed Archimedeanlike square spiral metastructures via the excitation of spoof surface acoustic waves (SSAWs). By applying mirror-symmetric combinatorial operations to the unit structures, we further construct composite chiral metastructures that enable both one-dimensional and two-dimensional stable transport of acoustic bimerons. It is further revealed that bimeron transport originates from the locked opposite phase differences of SSAWs, induced by the handedness of the cavity resonant modes. The intrinsic robustness of the meron textures against structural defects is confirmed through the calculation of their topological charge. Our findings establish stable acoustic bimeron transport as a topologically resilient foundation for future acoustic information processing and storage technologies.

- **TL;DR**: Fe3GeTe2纳米薄片中观察到反常霍尔效应的阶跃式切换，揭示了铁磁与反铁磁耦合共存，源于Fe+3与Fe+2离子间的复杂相互作用

For the van der Waals magnet Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$, although a ferromagnetic ground state has been reported, there are also reports of complex magnetic behavior suggesting coexistence of ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism due to the intricate interaction between Fe$^{+3}$ and Fe$^{+2}$ ions in this system. The exact nature of the interactions and the origin of antiferromagnetism are still under debate. Here, we report the observation of signature of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic couplings between different Fe-ions in the anomalous Hall effect measured for devices of mechanically exfoliated Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ nano-flakes of thicknesses ranging from\,$\sim$\,15-20 layers. The temperature-dependent anomalous Hall effect data reveal two sharp step-like switchings at low temperature ($T\lesssim150\,$K). Our detailed analyses suggest the step-like sharp switchings in anomalous Hall resistance are due to the magnetization reversal behavior of different Fe-ions in individual layers of Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$. The experimental results can be explained by considering an intra-layer antiferromagnetic coupling between Fe$^{+3}$ and Fe$^{+3}$ ions, whereas intra-layer ferromagnetic coupling between Fe$^{+3}$ and Fe$^{+2}$ in the system. Our experimental results and the analyses are supported by the first-principles calculations for energetics and intralayer as well as interlayer exchange coupling constants.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究发现了在Ge纳米线衬底上气相生长过程中自发形成的亚30纳米超薄GeSn鳍结构，揭示了GeSn合金中从典型共形壳层到鳍状结构的转变机制。

GeSn semiconductors are group-IV isovalent alloys that offer remarkable tunability of optoelectronic properties across the entire infrared spectrum, while remaining fully compatible with silicon processing standards. These attributes make GeSn a promising platform for scalable sensing, imaging, and communication technologies. Yet, the influence of dimensionality on GeSn crystal growth remains poorly understood, limiting the development of integrated nanoscale infrared devices. Here, we reveal the spontaneous formation of hitherto unreported ultra-thin GeSn fins with sub-30 nm thickness during vapor-phase growth on Ge nanowire substrates. A transition from the typical conformal GeSn shell to distinct fin-like structures occurs along the nanowire growth axis and is accompanied by ordered twin defects extending longitudinally and laterally, inducing a transition from diamond to hexagonal-like crystal structure. The fins exhibit uniform Sn incorporation of approximately 16 at.% throughout their volume, indicating high compositional homogeneity. These findings uncover an anisotropic growth regime in metastable GeSn alloys, enriching the fundamental understanding of nanoscale epitaxy.

Understanding how dielectric anisotropy governs excitonic behavior in two-dimensional (2D) halide perovskites is critical for predicting and engineering their optoelectronic properties. In this work, we investigate Cs(n+1)PbnBr3n+1 nanoplatelets (n = 2-5) experimentally and theoretically and show that the interplay between dielectric confinement and anisotropic screening critically determines both their electronic structure and excitonic landscape. To incorporate the dielectric screening effects, the Coulomb kernel in the Fock exchange term is refined using a model dielectric function together with a model Bethe-Salpeter Equation approach. The exciton binding energies show a monotonic decrease from 0.26 eV to 0.21 eV from n = 2 to 5, with 20 meV decrease per layer up to n = 4, and thereafter less change. The relatively small change per layer is a consequence of the strong spatial localization of excitons. By analyzing directionally resolved dielectric tensors, we demonstrate that the in-plane dielectric constant predominantly dictates optical transitions and is close to converging to the bulk value already at n = 5, while the out-of-plane dielectric response reflects the confined nature of excitonic wave functions as expected. Our calculated absorption spectra capture experimental results within 0.02 eV throughout the confinement regime (n = 2-5). The effects of lattice dynamics on the dimensionally dependent dielectric response and subsequent exciton screening occurring on longer time-scales than the optical response are also analyzed, important for analysis and interpretation of exciton lifetime, diffusion, and band alignments. The results establish a clear correlation between dielectric anisotropy, electronic structure, and exciton binding energy at different timescales in layered perovskites, providing essential insight for the design of 2D optoelectronic materials and devices.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究通过GdAuGe在石墨烯/SiC上的生长实验，发现了远程外延的两个独特特征：界面处的无序层和30°旋转外延关系，这些无法用传统机制解释，证明了真正的远程外延机制。

Remote epitaxy relaxes the constraints of conventional epitaxy, to enable low defect density, chemically abrupt heterostructures and exfoliation of single crystalline membranes. However, definitive evidence for a true remote mechanism remains elusive because most experiments can be explained by alternative mechanism that are macroscopically indistinguishable from true remote epitaxy. Using GdAuGe films grown on graphene/SiC (0001), we present two signatures that cannot be explained by the leading alternatives to the remote mechanism: (1) a few atomic layer thick disordered interlayer at the GdAuGe/graphene interface and (2) a $30\degree$ rotated epitaxial relationship between the GdAuGe film and the SiC substrate. Density functional theory calculations indicate these signatures arise from remote epitaxial \textit{frustration}, a competition amongst epitaxy to the remotely screened substrate, to graphene, and to the graphene-induced interfacial reconstruction. Tuning the amplitudes and periodicities of these competing potentials provides new opportunities to intentionally disrupt long-range order.

Quantum emitters in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) that exhibit optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) signatures have recently garnered significant attention as an emerging solid-state platform for quantum technologies. However, the underlying spin dynamics, and the mechanisms determining the spin-dependent fluorescence in these defects are still poorly understood. In this work we perform detailed photodynamical studies of the spin complexes in hBN. In particular, we show that spin transitions are located within the metastable manifold which can be explained by the rate model, populating in a cascading manner. In addition, we perform temperature dependent measurements on these defects and show that the spin-lattice relaxation and coherence times increase as the temperature reduces. Furthermore, we find that the ODMR frequencies of the S=1 transition show only a marginal frequency shift as a function of temperature, which makes them a robust sensor at cryogenic temperatures. These insights are crucial for further understanding of the spin dynamics of quantum emitters in hBN and their practical implementation in quantum sensing.

### Revisiting the theory of crystal polarization: The downside of employing the periodic boundary conditions

- **TL;DR**: 周期性边界条件(PBC)在计算晶体材料性质时存在局限性，特别是对于极化这种非局域性质，必须同时考虑体相和表面的贡献才能正确描述宏观晶体的极化和对称性。

Periodic boundary condition (PBC) is a standard approximation for calculating crystalline materials properties. However, a PBC crystal is not the same as the real macroscopic crystal, therefore, if applied indiscriminately, it can lead to erroneous conclusions. For example, unlike other extensive observables such as total energy, the polarization of a macroscopic crystal cannot always be described by a PBC model, because polarization is inherently nonlocal and strongly dependent on surface terminations, irrespective of crystal size, and moreover, the symmetry of the macroscopic crystal can be altered when the PBC is applied to a macroscopic crystal. We demonstrate in this paper that the polarization of a macroscopic crystal receives contributions from both the repeating bulk units and the crystal surfaces, which must be treated on an equal footing. When the combined system of the bulk and its surfaces are taken into account, materials traditionally classified as nonpolar can, in fact, admit polar symmetry, thus explaining why experimentalists have observed polarization in some nominally ``nonpolar'' systems. Our study, thus, clarifies that polarization can only exist in polar group systems and that apparent violations of Neumann's principle reported in some recent works originate from misinterpreting bulk PBC crystal as intrinsic macroscopic crystal, ignoring the contribution from the surfaces. We demonstrate that when the full bulk-plus-surface system is considered, the crystal polarization and symmetry is fully consistent with Neumann's principle.

The breaking of spatial inversion symmetry in condensed matter gives rise to intriguing physical properties, such as ferroelectricity, piezoelectricity, spin-momentum locking, and nonreciprocal responses. Here we propose that a concentration gradient, which often persists as a quasi-stable nonequilibrium state with long relaxation times in solids, can serve as a general platform for inversion symmetry breaking. We demonstrate this concept in an epitaxial thin film of the hydrogen-doped SmFeAsO (Sm1111:H) superconductor with a depthwise hydrogen-concentration gradient introduced via an optimized topotactic reaction. This film exhibits nonreciprocal charge transport, meaning that the electrical resistance depends on the direction of the applied current, which serves as a key signature of broken inversion symmetry. A pronounced nonreciprocal signal emerges in the vicinity of the superconducting transition, which we attribute to vortex-motion nonreciprocity arising from an asymmetric pinning landscape created by the hydrogen-concentration gradient. Owing to the high critical temperature of Sm1111:H, vortex-origin nonreciprocity is observed above 40 K, representing the highest temperature reported to date among single bulk materials without an artificially hetero-layered structure. Our findings establish concentration-gradient engineering as a versatile and broadly applicable route for realizing inversion-broken states in otherwise centrosymmetric hosts, opening pathways toward a broader landscape of odd-parity-driven functionalities.

Uranium dihydride UH2 is a metastable phase unknown in bulk form but accessible through thin-film synthesis. We prepared UH2 films by reactive dc sputtering on CaF2(001) or Si(001) substrates, the latter equipped with a Mo buffer layer to suppress a U-Si interdiffusion. On CaF2, UH2 adopts the fluorite-type structure with a near-[1 1 1] out-of-plane texture, four rotational domains, and a lattice parameter a = 539 +- 3 pm without measurable strain, whereas the Mo-buffered film is polycrystalline. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed complete hydrogenation and minimal oxidation. Magnetization and XMCD measurements show ferromagnetic ordering with Curie temperatures of 120-130 K and a uranium 5f moment of 0.9 μB/U, dominated by the orbital contribution (μL ~ 1.4 μB, μS ~ -0.5 μB), in a good agreement with GGA+U computations, which otherwise overestimate absolute values of the spin and orbital components. The slightly reduced moment in thinner CaF2-supported films is attributed to surface U(IV) species. These results demonstrate that thin-film synthesis enables stabilization of UH2 and direct probing of 5f magnetism, opening pathways toward higher uranium hydrides and interface-engineered actinide systems.

- **TL;DR**: Nd₂Fe₁₄B永磁体在晶界处存在高达25%的压缩应变，导致磁晶各向异性常数Ku从正值变为负值，严重影响磁性能。

Nd$_{2}$Fe$_{14}$B -- a widely used permanent magnet -- has magnetocrystalline anisotropy constants that differ between the bulk and interface regions. This study explores the effects of lattice distortion on the magnetocrystalline anisotropy ($K_{\rm u}$) and magnetization of (Nd$_{1-x}$Pr$_x$)$_2$Fe$_{14}$B. Nd$_2$Fe$_{14}$B alloys were fabricated; scanning transmission electron microscopy revealed a compressive strain of up to 25% near grain boundaries. Using the full-potential Korringa--Kohn--Rostoker method, we calculated the strain dependence of $K_{\rm u}$, showing that although $K_{\rm u}$ is 4.2 MJ/m$^3$ under strain-free conditions at 0 K, it becomes negative in regions with 25% compressive strain. Additionally, Pr$_{2}$Fe$_{14}$B exhibits a larger $K_{\rm u}$ than Pr$_{2}$Fe$_{14}$B under undistorted conditions, whereas Pr-rich alloys exhibit a more pronounced reduction in $K_{\rm u}$ under strain. These findings highlight the critical influence of lattice distortions on magnetic properties. The calculated strain-dependent magnetic anisotropy parameters provide valuable inputs for future micromagnetic simulations, aiding the design of advanced magnetic materials.

- **TL;DR**: EquiCSP：一种新型的等变扩散生成模型，用于晶体结构预测，解决了现有模型中晶格排列等变性和周期性平移等变性的问题，在生成准确结构和训练收敛速度方面优于现有模型。

In addressing the challenge of Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP), symmetry-aware deep learning models, particularly diffusion models, have been extensively studied, which treat CSP as a conditional generation task. However, ensuring permutation, rotation, and periodic translation equivariance during diffusion process remains incompletely addressed. In this work, we propose EquiCSP, a novel equivariant diffusion-based generative model. We not only address the overlooked issue of lattice permutation equivariance in existing models, but also develop a unique noising algorithm that rigorously maintains periodic translation equivariance throughout both training and inference processes. Our experiments indicate that EquiCSP significantly surpasses existing models in terms of generating accurate structures and demonstrates faster convergence during the training process.

Transition metal doping is commonly used for altering the properties of solid-state materials to suit applications in science and technology. Partially filled $d$-shells of transition metal atoms lead to electronic states with diverse spatial and spin symmetries. Chromium(III) cations have shown great potential for designing laser materials and, more recently, for developing spin qubits in quantum applications. They also represent an intriguing class of chemical systems with strongly correlated multi-reference excited states, due to the $d^3$ electron configuration. These states are difficult to describe accurately using single-reference quantum chemical methods such as density functional theory (DFT), the most commonly used method to study the electronic structures of solid-state systems. Recently, the periodic effective Hamiltonian of crystal field (pEHCF) method has been shown to overcome some limitations arising in the calculations of excited $d$-states. In this work, we assess the suitability of DFT and pEHCF to calculate the electronic structure and $d$-$d$ excitations of chromium(III) dopants in wide band gap host materials. The results will aid computational development of novel transition metal-doped materials and provide a deeper understanding of the complex nature of transition metal dopants in solids.

In this study, theoretical investigation on structural, electronic, magnetic, elastic and thermoelectric properties of the full Heusler Co$_2$YPb (Y = Tc, Ti, Zr and Hf) alloys have been performed within density functional theory (DFT). The exchange and correlation potential is addressed using two approximations: the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) and the GGA augmented by the Tran--Blaha-modified Becke-Johnson (mBj-GGA) approximation, which provides a more accurate description of the energy band gap. The electronic and magnetic properties reveal that the full-Heusler alloys Co$_2$YPb (with Y = Tc, Ti, Zr, and Hf) display half-metallic ferromagnetic behavior. Furthermore, the elastic properties suggest that Co$_2$YPb are mechanically stable, with ductile characteristics. Full Heusler alloys P-type exhibit positive Seebeck coefficients and high ZT values, indicating good thermoelectric performance in terms of electrical and thermal conductivity. This leads us to the conclusions that these compounds are very interesting in improving the performance of embedded automotive systems and can also be used in spintronic devices.

### Alteraxial Phonons in Collinear Magnets

Circularly polarized or axial phonons possessing nonzero angular momentum have attracted considerable interest. These phonons have finite magnetic moment and can couple to internal magnetic order. The rich magnetic structures enable phonon angular momentum (PAM) to acquire momentum-space textures analogous to electronic spin structures. However, a systematic framework for classifying these textures, especially their potential higher-order multipolar patterns, has remained elusive. Here, by employing magnetic point group analysis, we develop a complete classification of long-wavelength phonons in collinear magnets. Our theory distinguishes four fundamental types, including three families of magneto-axial phonons differentiated by symmetry and the parity (odd or even) of the PAM wave pattern. Strikingly, we reveal a full sequence of axial phonons exhibiting higher-order-wave (from p- to j-wave) PAM patterns covering both odd and even parities, which we term magneto-alteraxial phonons. Our high-throughput calculations predict hundreds of magnetic candidates hosting such magneto-alteraxial phonons. We have also performed ab initio calculations on representative materials to validate the proposed magneto-alteraxial phonon spectra and PAM patterns. Our work establishes a symmetry-guided design principle for axial phonons and related phenomena in magnetic materials.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究揭示了卤化物钙钛矿中离子迁移通过Hoke效应和Schottky效应两种方式影响太阳能电池稳定性，通过增加传输层厚度可显著提升器件寿命。

Ion migration in halide perovskites is a key factor limiting the operational stability of solar cells due to formation of halogen ion enriched domains and accumulation layers. The present work demonstrates the manifestation of ion migration in two ways via Hoke and Schottky effects. Both effects are induced by external exposure but have its peculiar way of solar cell performance degradation. We demonstrate the effects of ion migration on the device performance by measuring time dependent short-circuit current and different impedance characteristics that allow to see how charge-carrier separation property degrades. The Schottky effect leads to the rapid decrease of charge-carrier separation characteristic of solar cell while Hoke effect leads to the slow defect accumulation in the perovskite layer leading to the enhanced Shockley-Read-Hall recombination. Separation of these two effects can be realized by simple increase of transport layer thickness. A thick transport layer blocks losses of charge-carrier selectivity in a solar cell and leads to an enormous increase of T80 time, from 15 seconds up to 60 minutes.

### Dynamic Screening Effects on Auger Recombination in Metal-Halide Perovskites

The performance of modern light-emitting technologies, from lasers to LEDs, is limited by nonradiative losses, with Auger recombination being the dominant channel at device-relevant carrier densities. Reliable modeling of this process is essential, yet conventional treatments neglect dynamic dielectric effects, limiting the predictive reliability at operating conditions. We develop a general framework that incorporates the frequency-dependent screened Coulomb interaction $W_{00}(\mathbf{q},ω)$, computed from low-scaling \textit{GW}, into both direct and phonon-assisted Auger amplitudes. Demonstrated on orthorhombic $γ$-CsPbI$_3$ (band gap $E_g\approx1.73$ eV) and $γ$-CsSnI$_3$ ($E_g\approx1.30$ eV), the approach shows that dynamic screening enhances the dielectric response, lowering the room-temperature Auger coefficient by $\sim$50-60 %. This renormalization shifts the crossover between radiative and nonradiative recombination by nearly a factor of two in carrier density. Dynamic dielectric screening thus emerges as a quantitative determinant of Auger recombination, offering a transferable framework for predictive modeling across polar semiconductors where frequency-independent screening models are inadequate.

Sodium-ion batteries have gained much interest over the past years and especially layered oxides are highly considered as cathodes for the next generation of batteries. However, there are still significant challenges to overcome in these materials for practical applications mainly related to capacity degradation and voltage fading. A key influence factor for these challenges are phase transitions that occur by gliding of layers during operation of these materials. Until now there is limited atomistic-level understanding on such transitions as simulations of these processes are computationally demanding. In this work, we trained a classical pairwise Coulomb-Buckingham potential versus extensive \textit{ab initio} data using a genetic algorithm to study O2-P2 phase transitions in Na\textsubscript{\textit{x}}CoO\textsubscript{2}. Our density functional theory~(DFT) and classical potential calculations show that phase transition barriers decrease upon desodiation and are further lowered if dynamic conditions are considered through molecular dynamics simulations. Our developed classical potential is able to capture phase transitions and its related increase in the Na-ion diffusivity under standard lab conditions at the $\upmu$s timescale of molecular dynamics simulation. Furthermore, it is found that the phase transition occurs gradually \textit{via} various OP\textit{n} phases.

- **TL;DR**: 提出一个计算框架，通过系统识别一阶鞍点来采样磁性系统的能量表面，这些鞍点决定了亚稳态之间的连接性和转变机制。

A computational framework is presented for the sampling of the energy surface of magnetic systems via the systematic identification of first-order saddle points that determine connectivity of metastable states and define the mechanisms of transitions between them. The framework combines four stages: first, the symmetry of a given minimum-energy configuration is identified and used to define subsystems whose eigenmodes provide relevant deformation directions; the subsystem eigenmodes are then used to guide the system toward the vicinity of different saddle points surrounding the energy minimum; next, the geodesic minimum mode following method is employed to efficiently converge onto the saddle points; and finally, the identified saddle points are embedded into the state network. Applied to metastable textures in two-dimensional chiral magnets described by a lattice Hamiltonian, the method reveals a hierarchy of transition mechanisms governing the nucleation, annihilation, and rearrangement of the fundamental components of localized magnetic textures. The identified saddle points enable the construction of the network of metastable states, where saddle points define the connectivity between them, providing a comprehensive map of accessible transitions and their associated energy barriers. Transitions corresponding to both homotopies that preserve the topological charge and transformations that change it are identified. By scaling the interaction parameters, the distinct behavior of these two classes is obtained as the continuum limit is approached. Finally, it is shown that textures with the same topological charge are not always connected by a homotopy corresponding to a minimum-energy path: in specific parameter regimes, the total topological charge necessarily increases and then decreases (or vice versa) during the transition, returning to its initial value at the final state.

Piezoelectric micromachined ultrasonic transducers (PMUTs) are widely used in applications that demand mechanical resilience, thermal stability, and compact form factors. Lead zirconate titanate (PZT) and aluminum nitride (AlN) active layers are used in PMUTs to enable acoustic actuation, sensing, or bidirectional operation. These platforms rely on bimorph films to maximize electromechanical coupling ($k^2$) through thin-film deposition, which uses intermediate electrode layers to establish opposing electric fields. Consequently, incumbent PMUT platforms are limited in achievable film thickness and feature material interfaces that compromise mechanical integrity and thermal performance. Combined with the intrinsic limitations of PZT and AlN, these factors motivate exploration of alternative PMUT material platforms. Recent efforts have sought to demonstrate that single-crystal lithium niobate (LN) is a promising candidate, offering substantially higher $k^2$ and bidirectional performance. Advances in LN film transfer technology have enabled the formation of periodically poled piezoelectric (P3F) LN, facilitating a bimorph stack without intermediate electrodes. In this work, we showcase bimorph PMUTs incorporating a mechanically robust, 20 micron thick P3F LN active layer. We establish the motivation for LN PMUTs through a material comparison, followed by extensive membrane geometry optimization and subsequent enhancement of the PMUT's $k^2$. We demonstrate a 775 kHz flexural mode device with a quality factor (Q) of 200 and an extracted $k^2$ of 6.4%, yielding a high transmit efficiency of 65 nm/V with a mechanically robust active layer. We leverage the high performance to demonstrate extreme-temperature resilience, showcasing stable device operation up to 600 degrees C and survival up to 900 degrees C, highlighting LN's potential as a resilient PMUT platform.

Recent advances in high-resolution CT-imaging technology are creating a new class of ultra-high resolved micro-structural datasets that challenge the limits of traditional homogenization approaches. While state-of-the-art FFT-based homogenization techniques remain effective for moderate datasets, their memory footprint and computational cost grow rapidly with increasing resolution, making them increasingly inefficient for industrial-scale problems. To address these challenges, the recently developed Superfast-Fourier Transform (SFFT)-based homogenization algorithm leverages the memory-efficient low-rank representations of Tensor Trains (TTs), which reduce the storage and computational requirements of large-scale homogenization problems. Developed for CPU usage, SFFT-based Homogenization efficiently handles high-resolution datasets, assuming the underlying data is well-behaved. In this work, we investigate the performance of fundamental TT operations on modern hardware accelerators using the JAX framework. This benchmarking study, comparing CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs, evaluates execution times and computational efficiency. Building on these insights, we adapt the SFFT-based homogenization algorithm for usage on accelerators, achieving speed-ups of up to 10x relative to the CPU implementation, thus paving the road for the treatment of previously infeasible dataset sizes. Our results show that GPUs and TPUs achieve comparable performance in realistic scenarios, despite the relative immaturity of the TPU ecosystem, demonstrating the potential of both architectures to accelerate quantum-inspired techniques for industrial-scale simulations, particularly for homogenization problems.
