- **TL;DR**: 研究HgTe/Nb三端约瑟夫森结的临界电流轮廓，发现偏置电流和磁场共同调控约瑟夫森行为，实现SQUID-like和Fraunhofer-like干涉模式的可调交叉，并观察到高达0.8的约瑟夫森二极管效率增强。

We investigate HgTe/Nb-based three-terminal Josephson junctions in T-shaped and X-shaped geometries and their critical current contours (CCCs). By decomposing the CCCs into the contributions from individual junctions, we uncover how bias current and magnetic field jointly determine the collective Josephson behavior. A perpendicular magnetic field induces a tunable crossover between SQUID-like and Fraunhofer-like interference patterns, controlled by the applied bias. Moreover, magnetic flux produces pronounced deformations of the CCC, enabling symmetry control in the $(I_1,I_2)$ plane. Remarkably, we identify a regime of strongly enhanced Josephson diode efficiency, reaching values up to $η\approx 0.8$ at low bias and magnetic field. The experimental results are quantitatively reproduced by resistively shunted junction (RSJ) simulations, which capture the coupled dynamics of current and flux in these multi-terminal superconducting systems.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究通过分析La1-xSrxMnO3中的电荷有序态，提出了一种双极化子模型来解释铜氧化物高温超导机制，特别是x≈1/8掺杂下的Tc下降现象。

The compound La1-xSrxMnO3 exhibits a charge order (CO) state at $x\approx 1/8$ and $T&lt;T_{co}$, which recalls the CO state with a decrease in the temperature of the superconducting transition, $T_c$, observed in all cuprates at this doping value. Local excitations of lattice and magnetic origins measured in the two-dimensional metallic state of La7/8Sr1/8MnO3 reveal the existence of bipolarons of size $4a$ resulting from structural and antiferromagnetic pairings of hole-rich orbital polarons of size $2a$. They are intertwined with hole-poor domains in a disordered state at $T&gt;T_{co}$ which become ordered on a chessboard organized in a 3D-order state of ferromagnetically paired polarons at $T&lt;T_{co}$. Applied to the CuO$_2$ planes of the cuprates of the "214" family, this model produces stripes of bipolarons intertwined with stripes of antiferromagnetically arranged spins, hole-poor, both of size $4a$, leading to a spin density wave with a wave vector $δ=1/8$, a charge density wave with $q=1/4$, the Yamada laws $δ(x)=x$ and $T_c\propto δ$ and a decrease of $T_c$ at x=1/8. This work invokes relevance of a bipolaronic origin of high $T_c$ superconductivity, in which bipolarons of size $4a$ can play a major role.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文通过计算多种实验可观测物理量，为确定La₃Ni₂O₇镍酸盐超导体的配对对称性提供了具体实验验证路径。

The discovery of high-T$_c$ superconductor in Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate materials represented by La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has opened new directions in the quest for unconventional superconductivity. A central unresolved issue concerns the pairing symmetry of the superconducting order. In this paper, we model the superconducting order of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using the established Fermi surface structure together with phenomenological pairing functions belonging to $s_\pm$ and $d$-wave symmetry classes, which are the leading possibilities in the current debate. We compute several experimentally accessible observables-including tunneling density of states, point contact spectroscopy, superfluid density, and Raman spectroscopy-each of which exhibits distinct characteristics for different gap symmetries. These quantities provide a concrete and experimentally testable route for identifying the pairing symmetry of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and for clarifying the microscopic nature of nickelate superconductivity.

Hyperuniform patterns present enhanced physical properties that make them the new generation of cutting-edge technological devices. Synthesizing devices with tens of thousands of components arranged in a hyperuniform fashion has thus become a breakthrough to achieve in order to implement these technologies. Here we provide evidence that extended two-dimensional hyperuniform patterns spanning tens of thousands of components can be nucleated using as a template the low-temperature vortex structure obtained in pristine Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 samples after following a field-cooling protocol.

- **TL;DR**: PRAPs是一个用于训练和使用矩张量势能的软件包，提供自动化工作流训练MTPs，并包含mliputils库辅助处理MLIP软件的结构文件。

We present the Plan for Robust and Accurate Potentials (PRAPs), a software package for training and using moment tensor potentials (MTPs) in concert with the Machine Learned Interatomic Potentials (MLIP) software package. PRAPs provides an automated workflow to train MTPs using active learning procedures, and a variety of utilities to ease and improve workflows when utilizing the MLIP software. PRAPs was originally developed in the context of crystal structure prediction, in which one calculates convex hulls and predicts low energy metastable and thermodynamically stable structures, but the potentials PRAPs develops are not limited to such applications. PRAPs produces two potentials, one capable of rough estimates of the energies, forces and stresses of almost any chemical structure in the specified compositional space -- the Robust Potential -- and a second potential intended to provide more accurate descriptions of ground state and metastable structures -- the Accurate Potential. We also present a Python library, mliputils, designed to assist users in working with the chemical structural files used by the MLIP package.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种利用范德华堆叠作为纳米化学反应器合成单晶的新方法，可制备高质量量子材料单晶

Advancing the chemical synthesis of crystals is important for both fundamental research and practical applications of quantum materials. While established bulk-phase and thin-film growth methods have enabled enormous progress, synthesizing single crystals suitable for quantum electronic discoveries remains challenging for many emerging materials. Here, we introduce van der Waals (vdW) stacks as nanochemical reactors for single-crystal synthesis and demonstrate their broad applicability in growing both elemental and compound crystals at the micrometer scale. By encapsulating atomically thin reactants that are stacked compactly with inert vdW layers such as hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), we achieve nanoconfined synthesis with the resulting crystals remaining encapsulated. As proof of concept, we synthesized isolated single crystals of elemental tellurium and distinct types of Pd-Te compounds. Structural characterization, including atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy, confirms the high crystalline quality of the products. We confirm the intrinsic semiconducting gap of tellurium and observe that non-stoichiometric PdTe1-x with a significantly reduced Te content (x ~ 0.18, a regime not previously achieved) retains uniform crystallinity and exhibits superconductivity below a critical temperature of 3.8 K. This nanochemical synthesis is broadly generalizable, chip-integrable, well-suited to a wide range of processing conditions, and compatible with nanofabrication routines for constructing devices. The concept of vdW nanoreactors offers a powerful and versatile pathway to expand the accessible landscape of quantum materials.

### Coarse-Graining via Lumping: Exact Calculations and Fundamental Limitations

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种构建有效半马尔可夫模型的聚合方法，能够精确再现微观动力学的完整熵产生统计，即使在隐藏载流循环被合并时，平均熵产生仍保持准确。

Detecting broken time-reversibility at micro- and nanoscale is often difficult when experiments offer limited state resolution. We introduce a lumping method that builds an effective semi-Markov model able to reproduce exactly the full entropy-production statistics of the microscopic dynamics. The mean entropy production stays accurate even when hidden current-carrying cycles are merged, though higher-order information can be unavoidably lost. In these cases, we capture violations of fluctuation theorems consistent with experiments, opening a path to novel inference strategies out of equilibrium.

In this article, we attempt to understand various aspects of turbulent flows in electron hydrodynamics. We analyze a rectangular channel geometry in the presence of an electric field and a Corbino geometry in the presence of a magnetic field. In the former geometry, we analyze the conductivity of the fluid as well as the frequency spectrum of perturbations about the Poiseuille flow. While the normal Poiseuille flow has an associated conductivity which scales as $W^2$, we find a correction which scales as $W^4$ in the case of non-linear flows, where $W$ is the characteristic length of the system. In the Corbino geometry, we analyze the velocity, vorticity and magnetic fields. We find that the vorticity can span across a wide range near the edge of the geometry, a behavior that can be reflected in the velocity and magnetic fields.

### HWF-PIKAN: A Multi-Resolution Hybrid Wavelet-Fourier Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Network for solving Collisionless Boltzmann Equation

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种新颖的多分辨率混合小波-傅里叶增强物理信息Kolmogorov-Arnold网络(HWF-PIKAN)，用于求解具有连续和不连续初始条件的无碰撞玻尔兹曼方程的对流问题，在时空和相空间中都表现出优越性能。

Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and more recently Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (PIKANs) have emerged as promising approaches for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) without reliance on extensive labeled data. In this work, we propose a novel multi-resolution Hybrid Wavelet-Fourier-Enhanced Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (HWF-PIKAN) for solving advection problems based on collisionless Boltzmann equation (CBE) with both continuous and discontinuous initial conditions. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, we conduct systematic benchmarks on classical advection equations in one and two dimensions. These tests demonstrate the model's ability to accurately capture smooth and abrupt features. We then extend the application of HWF-PIKAN to the high-dimensional phase-space setting by solving the CBE in a continuous-velocity manner. This leverages the Hamiltonian concept of phase-space dynamics to model the statistical behavior of particles in a collisionless system, where advection governs the evolution of a probability distribution function or number density. Comparative analysis against Vanilla PINN, Vanilla PIKAN, as well as Fourier-enhanced and Wavelet-enhanced PIKAN variants, shows that the proposed hybrid model significantly improves solution accuracy and convergence speed. This study highlights the power of multi-resolution spectral feature embeddings in advancing physics-informed deep learning frameworks for complex kinetic equations in both space-time and phase-space.

We present an attention-based foundation model architecture for learning and predicting quantum states across Hamiltonian parameters, system sizes, and physical systems. Using only basis configurations and physical parameters as inputs, our trained neural network is able to produce highly accurate ground state wavefunctions. For example, we build the phase diagram for the 2D square-lattice $t-V$ model with $N$ particles, from only 18 parameters $(V/t,N)$. Thus, our architecture provides a basis for building a universal foundation model for quantum matter.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究提出了一种仅存在于非平衡稳态中的新型配对机制，通过将Eliashberg理论推广到非平衡态，发现了不同于传统热平衡的超导增强途径。

The study of mechanisms for enhancing superconductivity has been a central topic in condensed matter physics due to the combination of fundamental and technological interests. One promising route is to exploit non-equilibrium effects in the steady state. Efforts in this direction have so far focused on enhancing the pairing mechanism known from thermal equilibrium through modified distributions for the electrons or the bosons mediating the electron-electron interaction. In this work, we identify an additional pairing mechanism that is active only outside thermal equilibrium. By generalizing Eliashberg theory to non-equilibrium steady states using the Keldysh formalism, we derive a set of Eliashberg equations that capture the effect of this genuinely non-thermal pairing glue even in the weak-coupling regime. We discuss two examples where this mechanism has a major impact. First, in a temperature-bias setup, we find that superconductivity is enhanced when the boson mediator is colder than the electrons. Second, we find that an incoherent drive of the boson mediator at energies much greater than the temperature pushes the system far from thermal equilibrium but leaves the critical coupling essentially unchanged, owing to a competition between electron heating and the enhancement of pairing by the non-thermal glue.

- **TL;DR**: 开发了一个名为LibppRPA的开源Python库，用于高效灵活的粒子-粒子随机相位近似计算，包括激发能、基态相关能及其解析梯度。

The accurate description of electron correlation and excitation energies remains a fundamental challenge in quantum chemistry. The particle-particle random phase approximation (ppRPA) has emerged as a promising method for capturing a broad range of excited-state properties. However, the implementation of ppRPA has been largely limited to in-house software, restricting its accessibility and usability. In this work, we present LibppRPA, an open-source and lightweight Python library designed for efficient and flexible ppRPA calculations of (1) electronic excitation energy and its associated analytical gradients and (2) the ground state correlation energy, and its associated analytical gradients. LibppRPA enables seamless integration with existing quantum chemistry packages, such as PySCF, by utilizing occupation numbers, molecular orbital coefficients, and three-center electron repulsion integrals. We implement both direct diagonalization and the iterative Davidson algorithm for solving the ppRPA equations, as well as active-space approximations, allowing users to balance accuracy and computational efficiency. We demonstrate the performance of LibppRPA through benchmark calculations on singlet-triplet gaps, double excitations, charge-transfer excitations, and valence/Rydberg excitations, showcasing its reliability across diverse molecular systems. The library provides a robust platform for studying electronic excitations and offers new opportunities for future developments in electronic structure theory.

- **TL;DR**: 通过原位高温XRD研究NiO薄膜在30-1100°C下的结构演化，发现相变、结晶度与电阻率变化密切相关

NiO is a promising p-type material for photovoltaics and power electronics, but its temperature limits remain unclear. Using in situ high-temperature X-ray diffraction (HT-XRD) from 30 to 1100 C, we track the structural evolution of NiO thin films in air. The film crystallizes from an amorphous phase to cubic NiO between 300 and 400 C, where the emergence and growth of the (111) diffraction peak correlate with an increase in electrical resistivity. Further increases in temperature lead to improved crystallinity and higher resistivity. At 1100 C, the formation of Ni2O3 is observed, resulting in a highly resistive film. This study establishes a clear correlation between phase evolution, crystallinity, and resistive behavior in NiO thin films.

### From Frequency Dependent Specific Heat to Fictive Temperature of a Glassy Liquid

- **TL;DR**: 该研究使用线性响应理论将玻璃形成液体中虚构温度的时间演化与记忆函数联系起来，通过自洽计算捕获弛豫速率与结构响应函数之间的相互依赖关系。

Upon rapid quenching of temperature of a glass forming liquid, the system falls out of equilibrium due its finite relaxation time. Additionally, the relaxation becomes progressively slower with time. The created nonequilibrium state of the glassy system is conveniently described by introducing a fictive temperature which provides the instantaneous state of the nonequilibrium system. The fictive temperature $T_{f} (t)$ is time dependent. During cooling, the fictive temperature is higher than the actual temperature. After the cooling or quenching has ceased, the fictive temperature approaches the final temperature at a rate that depends on the relaxation properties of the liquid. In this work we use linear response theory to connect the time dependence of the fictive temperature to memory function which is shown to be related to the frequency dependent specific heat which itself depends on the fictive temperature $T_{f} (t)$. Thus, one requires { \it a self-consistent calculation} to capture the interdependence of relaxation rate and structural response function. We present a numerical calculation where we apply our relations to silica where the relaxation function that describes the frequency dependent specific heat and is modeled as a stretched exponential William-Watts (WW) function, while the relaxation time is modeled as a Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann (VFT). We calculate the fictive temperature self-consistently. $T_{f}(t)$ exhibits the fall out from actual temperature as time (t) progresses.

Randomly self-assembled nanowire networks (NWNs) are dynamical systems in which junctions between two nanowires can be modelled as memristive units viewed as adaptive resistors with memory. Various memristive models have been proposed to capture the complex mechanics of these junctions. Here, we showcase a novel computational framework named Memristive Nanowire Network Simulator (MemNNetSim) to simulate and analyze random memristive NWNs in a unified approach. Implemented using the Python programming language, MemNNetSim allows for the analysis of static and dynamic scenarios of NWNs under arbitrary memristive models. This provides a versatile foundation to build upon in further work, such as reservoir dynamics with NWNs, which has seen increased interest due to the interconnected architecture of NWNs. In this work, we introduce the package, demonstrate its utility in simulating NWNs, and then test advanced scenarios in which it can aid in the exploratory analysis of these systems, particularly in learning how to use NWNs as a physical reservoir in reservoir computing applications.

- **TL;DR**: 结合机器学习神经进化势与非谐晶格动力学-玻尔兹曼输运方程，定量研究碳纳米管及其束的热输运，揭示束中热导率急剧降低的双重机制

We combine machine learning (ML)-based neuroevolution potentials (NEP) with anharmonic lattice dynamics and the Boltzmann transport equation (ALD-BTE) to achieve a quantitative and mode-resolved description of thermal transport in individual (10, 0) zigzag single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and their bundles. Our analysis reveals a dual mechanism behind the drastic suppression of thermal conductivity in bundles: first, the breaking of rotational symmetry in isolated SWCNTs dramatically enhances the scattering rates of symmetry-sensitive phonon modes, such as the twist (TW) mode. Second, the emergence of new inter-tube phonon modes introduces abundant additional scattering channels across the entire frequency spectrum. Crucially, the incorporation of quantum Bose-Einstein (BE) statistics is essential to accurately capture these phenomena, enabling our approach to quantitatively reproduce experimental observations. This work establishes the combination of ML-driven interatomic potentials and ALD-BTE as a predictive framework for nanoscale thermal transport, effectively bridging the gap between theoretical models and experimental measurements.

### Multichannel Kondo Effect in Superconducting Leads

- **TL;DR**: 论文展示了在强关联、有能隙的电子系统中也能实现多通道近藤效应，通过自旋1/2杂质与n个自旋单重态超导通道耦合，发现了四种不同的边界相。

The traditional multichannel Kondo effect takes place when several gapless metallic electronic channels interact with a localized spin-$S$ impurity, with the number of channels $n$ exceeding the size of the impurity spin, $n&gt;2S$, leading to the emergence of non-Fermi liquid impurity behavior at low temperatures. Here, we show that the effect can be realized even when the electronic degrees of freedom are strongly correlated and gapped. The system under consideration consists of a single spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ impurity coupled isotropically to $n$ spin singlet superconducting channels realized by one-dimensional leads with quasi-long-range superconducting order. The competition between the Kondo and superconducting fluctuations induces multiple distinct ground states and boundary phases depending on the relative strengths of the bulk and boundary interactions. Using the Bethe Ansatz technique, we identify four regimes: an overscreened Kondo phase, a zero-mode phase, a Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) phase, and a local-moment phase with an unscreened impurity, each with its own experimental characteristic. We describe the renormalization-group flow, the excitation spectrum, and the full impurity thermodynamics in each phase. Remarkably, even in the presence of a bulk mass gap, the boundary critical behavior in the Kondo phase is governed by the same exponents as in the gapless theory with the low-energy impurity sector flowing to the $SU(2)_n$ Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) fixed point, and the impurity entropy monotonically decreasing as a function of temperature. In both the overscreened Kondo and zero-mode phases, the residual impurity entropy is $S_{\mathrm{imp}}(T \to 0) = \ln[2\cos(π/(n+2))]$. In the YSR and unscreened phases on the other hand the impurity entropy exhibits non-monotonic temperature dependence and is effectively free at low temperatures with $S_{\mathrm{imp}}(T \to 0) = \ln 2$.

- **TL;DR**: 使用ScN缓冲层可显著提升NbN薄膜的超导性能：临界温度从9K升至12.5K，20K电阻率从330 mkΩ·cm降至210 mkΩ·cm。

This work investigates the effect of a scandium nitride buffer layer on the superconducting properties of niobium nitride thin films. The use of a ScN buffer layer significantly improves the characteristics of 29 nm thick NbN films: the critical temperature Tc increases from 9 K to 12.5 K, while the resistivity at 20 K decreases from 330 mkOhm*cm to 210 mkOhm*cm compared to films without a buffer layer. These enhancements are attributed to the better lattice matching between NbN and ScN, which results in a higher quality crystal lattice of the NbN film, as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction data.

Consideration is given to inductively coupled BCl3-plasma (ICP) treatment of the GaN surface, which is a promising technique to get the low resistance ohmic contacts in GaN-based transistors. In some cases, BCl3 plasma treatment results in ohmic contact degradation because BClx radicals tend to form a polymer thin film BxCly on the surface. In the present work, the mechanisms of BCl3 plasma interaction with the GaN surface are considered. Threshold ion energies of reactive ion etching for polymer BxCly and semiconductor GaN, respectively, are estimated using numerical plasma modeling. It has been demonstrated that a plasma treatment regime without polymer deposition and reactive etching is possible when an ion energy is in the range ~32-60 eV.

- **TL;DR**: 提出基于数值赝原子轨道(PAOs)和速度规范微扰理论计算半导体二阶光学极化率χ(2)的方法，通过对称性识别PAOs间的动量算符双中心积分计算。

The second-order optical susceptibility of semiconductors $χ_{ijk}^{(2)}(-2ω;ω,ω)$ finds application in metrology, spectroscopy, telecommunications, material characterization, and quantum information. Pioneering calculations of $χ_{ijk}^{(2)}(-2ω;ω,ω)$ utilized non-orthogonal Gaussian orbitals centered at atoms. That formulation transitioned into plane-wave-based algorithms as time went by. As of late, nevertheless, multiple tools for calculating optical susceptibilities have recast the problem using Wannier ({\em i.e.}, {\em localized}) orbitals, making a comeback onto frameworks based on localized basis sets. Here, we present an approach for calculating $χ_{ijk}^{(2)}(-2ω;ω,ω)$ reliant on numerical pseudoatomic orbitals (PAOs) within perturbation theory in the velocity gauge. Its salient feature is a calculation of `Slater-Koster-like' two-center integrals of the momentum operator in between PAOs identified by symmetry. The approach was successfully tested on paradigmatic cubic silicon carbide (3C-SiC) and gallium arsenide, for which linear responses are contributed as well.

Spontaneous symmetry breaking is a hallmark of equilibrium systems, typically characterized by a single critical point separating ordered and disordered phases. Recently, a novel class of non-equilibrium phase transitions was uncovered [Phys. Rev. Res. {\bf 7}, L032049 (2025)], showing that the combined effects of simultaneous contact with thermal baths at different temperatures and external driving forces can split the conventional order-disorder transition into two distinct critical points, determined by which ordered state initially dominates. We show the robustness of this phenomenon by extending a minimal interacting-spin model from the idealized case of simultaneous bath coupling to a finite-time coupling protocol. In particular, we introduce two protocols in which the system interacts with a single bath at a time: a stochastic protocol, where the system randomly switches between the baths at different temperatures, and a deterministic protocol where the coupling alternates periodically. Our analysis reveals two key results: (i) the splitting of phase transitions persists across all coupling schemes -- simultaneous, stochastic, and deterministic -- and (ii) different optimizations of power and efficiency in a collectively operating heat engine reveal that both the stochastic and deterministic protocols exhibit superior global performance at intermediate switching rates and periods when compared to simultaneous coupling. The global trade-off between power and efficiency is described by an expression solely depending on the temperatures of thermal reservoirs as the efficiency approaches to the ideal limit.

We develop a perturbative input-output formalism to compute the reflectance and transmittance spectra of cavity magnonics systems subject to a Floquet modulation. The method exploits the strong hierarchy between the magnetic-dipole couplings transverse (drive field) and parallel (modulation field) to the static bias field, which naturally introduces the small parameter $ε= (2Ns)^{-1/2}$ associated with the total spin $Ns$ of the ferromagnet. By organizing the cavity and magnon fields in a systematic expansion in $ε$, we obtain compact analytic expressions for the spectra up to second order. Using these results, we reproduce the characteristic sideband structure observed in recent Floquet cavity electromagnonics experiments. Furthermore, accounting for the Zeeman interaction between the modulation field and the fully polarized ground state - a contribution typically neglected in previous treatments - we predict an additional magnon detuning of approximately $0.8\,\mathrm{GHz}$, independent of both modulation frequency and sample size and determined solely by the spatial volume occupied by the modulation field. This identifies a measurable and previously overlooked shift relevant for the interpretation and design of cavity magnonics experiments.

- **TL;DR**: 基于蒙特卡洛方法的三维晶格模型研究非化学计量SiOx薄膜相分离过程中Si相形态演化的动力学，分析初始化学计量比x和薄膜厚度对Si纳米颗粒形成的影响。

In this paper, a three-dimensional lattice model based on the Monte Carlo approach is presented. This model is developed to investigate the kinetics of morphology change during phase separation in nonstoichiometric Si oxide (SiOx, x &lt; 2) films. The model takes into account the SiOx local atomic structure and probabilistic migration of oxygen atoms driven by the tendency of free energy minimization. The influence of the initial SiOx stoichiometry index x and film thickness on the morphology of the precipitated Si phase in the Si oxide matrix is analyzed. The morphology of the Si phase is shown to critically depend on the initial SiOx stoichiometry. Namely, isolated Si nanoparticles form at low excess Si content (x &gt;= 1.4), while interconnected Si networks always appear at x &lt;= 0.8. A dimensional effect on the morphology of the Si phase is revealed. Namely, reducing the film thickness imposes geometric constraints on the Si network formation. The percolation threshold is found to shift from xp ~= 1.35 for the bulk-like SiOx layers to xp ~= 0.85 for the quasi-two-dimensional films. The transition to the bulk material behavior is observed at a SiOx thickness of approximately 4.2 nm.

- **TL;DR**: 费米液体中的余维二缺陷通过边际相关耦合改变重整化群流，其机制与Kondo问题不同，源于缺陷产生的空间各向异性导致的粒子-空穴不对称性。

We show that codimension-two defects in Fermi liquids deform the renormalization group flow via a marginally relevant coupling. The mechanism for generating the flow is distinct from the case of the Kondo problem (codimension-three defects) in that the effective particle-hole asymmetry that leads to the log running is due to the spatial anisotropy generated by the defect. The mechanism for the log generation has a simple geometric explanation which shows that hole fluctuations are suppressed as the incoming momentum is taken to be along the direction of the defect. The RG flow time is shown to scale with the length of the defect. We also show that the dislon, the Goldstone mode localized to the defect, couples in a non-derivative fashion to the bulk fermions and becomes relevant above the dislons' Debye frequency which depends upon the defect tension.

We show that twisted interfaces between superconductors can serve as a phase-sensitive platform for the detection and characterization of pair density waves (PDW). In the presence of an in-plane magnetic field, the critical Josephson current of a twisted PDW interface is maximal at a finite field value, determined by the twist angle and the PDW period -- an explicit signature of the PDW. The results are robust to variations in junction geometry and can be adapted to certain cases with strong disorder or fluctuations. Their temperature dependence allows to distinguish pure PDW from byproducts of coexistence of superconductivity and charge- or spin- density waves.

In this work, we develop an extended dissipaton theory that generalizes the environmental couplings beyond the conventional linear and quadratic forms, enabling the treatment of arbitrary order of bath couplings. Applying this theoretical framework to the condensed-phase non-Condon spectroscopy, we demonstrate the interplay of anharmonicity, non-Condon and solvent effects on optical spectra. Precise simulations are carried out with high efficiency on linear absorption spectra involving the above mentioned correlated effects. We exhibit how an anharmonic potential modulates the vibronic feature, offering insights into the role of nonlinear environmental couplings in spectroscopic signatures and exemplifying the success of the extended dissipaton formalism as an exact and efficient method for higher-order bath couplings.

- **TL;DR**: 半导体敏化热电池（STC）能在等温条件下将环境热能转化为电能，同时降低自身温度，实现热管理与能量收集的耦合。

This manuscript reports a semiconductor-sensitized thermal cell (STC) that converts ambient heat into electrical power while simultaneously reducing its own temperature under isothermal conditions. Using a printable semiconductor--electrolyte architecture, we fabricate $4\,\mathrm{cm} \times 4\,\mathrm{cm}$ devices that generate up to approximately $0.2\,\mathrm{mW}$ at temperatures of $40$--$55\,^\circ\mathrm{C}$. During continuous discharge, the STC exhibits a transient temperature decrease followed by thermal equilibration with the environment. In contrast, periodic on--off discharge produces sustained cooling of approximately $1\,^\circ\mathrm{C}$ relative to a non-discharging reference. Notably, parallel integration of four STCs yields a nonlinear enhancement of cooling (approximately $5\,^\circ\mathrm{C}$) without a corresponding increase in electrical output. The observed behavior can be understood within a macroscopic energy-balance framework, in which time modulation of electrochemical heat consumption prevents the establishment of thermal steady state. These results demonstrate sustained isothermal cooling induced by heat-to-electricity conversion at practical device scales, and highlight semiconductor-sensitized thermal cells as a platform for coupled energy harvesting and thermal management.

- **TL;DR**: 扩展模式耦合理论以包含临界动力学涨落，证明涨落恢复遍历性并将平均场转变替换为平滑交叉

We develop a systematic extension of mode-coupling theory (MCT) that incorporates critical dynamical fluctuations. Starting from a microscopic diagrammatic theory, we identify dominant classes of divergent diagrams near the mode-coupling transition and show that the corresponding asymptotic series dominates the mean-field below an upper critical dimension $d_c=8$. To resum these divergences, we construct a mapping to a stochastic dynamical process in which the order parameter evolves under random spatiotemporal fields. This reformulation provides a controlled, fully dynamical derivation of an effective theory for the $β$-relaxation which remarkably coincides with stochastic beta-relaxation theory [T. Rizzo, EPL 106, 56003 (2014)]. All coupling constants of the latter theory are expressed microscopically in terms of the liquid static structure factor and are computed for the paradigmatic hard-sphere system. The analysis demonstrates that fluctuations alone restore ergodicity and replace the putative mean-field transition by a smooth crossover. Our results establish a predictive framework for structural relaxation beyond mean-field.

Spin-transfer torque magnetic random-access memory (STT-MRAM) relies on nanoscale magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) as its fundamental building blocks. Next-generation STT-MRAM requires strategies that simultaneously improve switching energy efficiency and device endurance. Here, we present the first study of perpendicular STT-MRAM writing assisted by radio-frequency (RF) spin torque. We show that applying a small-amplitude RF pulse prior to a direct-current (DC) writing pulse enhances the MTJ switching probability, with the efficiency gain increasing at lower RF frequencies. This RF+DC writing scheme enables shorter DC pulses, thereby improving device endurance. Analytical and numerical modeling qualitatively reproduces the experimental trends, while quantitative discrepancies indicate that realistic MTJ properties beyond idealized models play an important role in RF-assisted switching.

We investigate finite-temperature magnetic and topological phase transitions in two-dimensional honeycomb ferromagnets using an extended self-consistent renormalized spin-wave theory (SRSWT) that incorporates higher-order corrections from the Holstein--Primakoff expansion. Focusing on the combined effects of single-ion anisotropy, Zeeman field, next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) exchange, and Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya interaction, we analyze how these parameters influence the magnetization curves and magnon spectra. This work serves two main goals. First, we critically examine the limitations of SRSWT, showing that in the absence of external or interaction tuning, the theory tends to overestimate magnon self-energy corrections, often predicting first-order magnetic transitions with multivalued magnetization and metastable solution branches (i.e., self-consistent but thermodynamically unstable states). Second, we demonstrate that topological transitions -- signaled by magnon gap closings at the Dirac points -- can be tuned to occur below the magnetic transition temperature and within the thermodynamically stable regime. In particular, we identify two practical tuning strategies: applying an external Zeeman field of appropriate sign depending on the anisotropy strength, and introducing a small antiferromagnetic NNN exchange coupling. These findings not only clarify the predictive scope and limitations of SRSWT but also provide experimentally relevant guidance for realizing thermally driven topological transitions in two-dimensional honeycomb magnetic insulators.

Understanding how superconductivity competes with other electronic phases in cuprates requires direct access to the hidden non-superconducting low temperature phase, for which Abrikosov vortices provide a unique local probe. We map the doping- and field-dependent evolution of vortex-core states in Bi$_{2}$Sr$_{2}$CaCu$_{2}$O$_{8+δ}$ across a broad doping range spanning the Fermi-surface Lifshitz transition. High-resolution scanning tunneling spectroscopy reveals a striking transformation of the vortex-core spectrum from unconventional, pseudogap-like signatures at moderate doping to more BCS-like behavior beyond a critical doping $p^* \approx 0.21$. This crossover aligns with the pseudogap endpoint and the onset of Fermi-surface reconstruction, indicating a direct link between pseudogap physics and vortex electronic structure. Our findings highlight the vortex core as a sensitive local probe of the cuprate ground state.

Traditional x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) relies upon a direct mapping between the photoelectron binding energies and the local chemical environment, which is well-characterized by an electrostatic partial charges model for systems in equilibrium. However, the extension of this technique to out-of-equilibrium systems has been hampered by the lack of x-ray sources capable of accessing multiple atomic sites with high spectral and temporal resolution, as well as the lack of simple theoretical procedures to interpret the observed signals. In this work we employ multi-site XPS with a narrowband femtosecond x-ray probe to unravel different ultrafast dissociation processes of a polyatomic molecule, fluoromethane (CH$_{3}$F). We show that XPS can follow the cleavage of both the C-F and C-H bonds in real time, despite these channels lying close in binding energy. Additionally, we apply the partial charges model to describe these dynamics, and verify this extension with both advanced ab-initio calculations and experimental data. These results enable the application of this technique to out-of-equilibrium systems of higher complexity, by correlating real-time information from multiple atomic sites and interpreting the measurements through a viable theoretical modelling.

As an ultrawide bandgap semiconductor, beta-Ga2O3 has been attractive for its strong tolerance to irradiation damage and high n-type conductivity through ion implantation. Homoepitaxial (010) \b{eta}-Ga2O3 films grown by MOCVD were implanted with Ge to study the post-implantation damage and lattice recovery after thermal annealing. Box profiles of 100 or 50 nm at concentration of 5*10^19 or 3*10^19 cm^-3 were formed, with maximum displacement per atom (DPA) of 1.2 or 2.0. Lattice recovery was investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD) for anneals from 100 C to 1050 C. A gamma-phase related peak was observed for all implant conditions. All samples showed strain relaxation of beta-phase peak at temperature below 500 C, with no significant change for the gamma-phase related peak. For lower damage implants, films recovered fully to epitaxial beta-phase after sequential annealing to 900 C. For the higher damage implant, the gamma-phase associated peak annealed out with increasing temperature, but a new diffraction peak formed at slightly smaller lattice spacing; full recovery of the lattice was not observed until annealing at 1050 C. The newly formed diffraction peak is identified as beta-(20-4), beta-(512), or beta-(71-2), each potentially arising from the conversion of gamma-phase to beta-phase via a common oxygen sub-lattice.

Hydrodynamics provides a universal description of the emergent collective dynamics of vastly different many-body systems, based solely on their symmetries and conservation laws. Here we harness this universality, encoded in the Navier-Stokes-Fourier (NSF) equations, to find general scaling laws for the stationary uniaxial solutions of the compressible NSF problem far from equilibrium. We show for general transport coefficients that the steady density and temperature fields are functions of the pressure and a kinetic field that quantifies the quadratic excess velocity relative to the ratio of heat flux and shear stress. This kinetic field obeys in turn a spatial scaling law controlled by pressure and stress, which is inherited by the stationary density and temperature fields. We develop a scaling approach to measure the associated master curves, and confirm our predictions through compelling data collapses in large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of paradigmatic model fluids. Interestingly, the robustness of the scaling laws in the face of significant finite-size effects reveals the surprising accuracy of NSF equations in describing molecular-scale stationary flows. Overall, these scaling laws provide a novel characterization of stationary states in driven fluids.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文提出了一种基于埋入式应力层位点控制量子点的确定性集成策略，实现了量子点与环形布拉格光栅谐振器的精确空间对准，获得了高光子提取效率和优异单光子特性。

The scalable integration of solid-state quantum emitters into photonic nanostructures remains a central challenge for quantum photonic technologies. Here, we demonstrate a robust and streamlined integration strategy that tackles the long-standing issue of deterministic fabrication on randomly positioned self-assembled quantum dots (QDs), leveraging a buried-stressor-based site-controlled InGaAs QD platform. We show that this deterministic growth approach enables precise spatial alignment with circular Bragg grating (CBG) resonators for enhanced emission, eliminating the need for complex and time-consuming deterministic lithography techniques. We fabricated a $6\times6$ SCQD-CBG array with 100\% device yield, with 35 devices falling within the radial-offset range where the simulated photon-extraction efficiency (PEE) exceeds 20\%, underscoring the spatial precision and scalability of our fabrication concept. A systematically selected subset of five devices with varying radial displacements reveals clear offset-dependent trends in extraction efficiency, spectral linewidth, and photon indistinguishability, thereby establishing quantitative bounds on spatial alignment tolerances. In the best-aligned QD-CBG device, we achieve a PEE of $(47.1\pm3.8)\%$, a linewidth of $(1.41\pm0.22)$ GHz, a radiative decay lifetime of $(0.80\pm0.02)$~ns, a single-photon purity of $(99.58\pm0.18)\%$, and a Hong-Ou-Mandel two-photon interference visibility of $(81\pm5)\%$ under quasi-resonant excitation at saturation power. We confirm our conceptual understanding of the effect of emitter-position dependent charge-noise fluctuations in terms of a quantum-optical model for the (quantum-)emission properties.

We present a detailed study of common intrinsic defects in CuInS$_2$ and CuGaS$_2$ using the Heyd, Scuseria and Ernzerhof (HSE) hybrid functional scheme. The impact of the two HSE parameters, $α$ and $ω$ on the band gap and compliance with the generalized Koopmans' theorem is investigated. Using the formation energy formalism and calculated thermodynamic charge-transition levels, we assess the electronic properties of the defects and explore the connection of charge-transition levels with optical-transition levels. Calculated Franck-Condon shifts for emission highlight the importance of lattice relaxation for the attribution of defects to luminescence peaks. Our results show that once these effects are included, predictions become closer to photoluminescence measurements available in literature.

We report a spin-(1/2, 5/2) three-leg ladder realized in a radical-Mn polymer, exhibiting an antiferromagnetic transition and magnetization curves accurately described by classical mean-field theory. Although the underlying spin model intrinsically supports strong quantum fluctuations, as confirmed by quantum Monte Carlo simulations, the real system shows an anomalously complete suppression of quantum behavior. These findings provide a key experimental benchmark for the quantum-classical crossover and suggest that lattice topology can play a crucial role in tuning the balance between quantum and classical physics in strongly correlated systems.

We investigate nonreciprocal electrical transport in bulk single-crystalline Mo3Al2C, a material known to host crystallographic chirality, a polar charge-density-wave instability, and a superconducting transition near 8 K. Using AC transport measurements to analyze the first-harmonic and second-harmonic resistance responses, we observe a distinct nonreciprocal second-harmonic signal that is significantly enhanced near the boundary of the normal and superconducting phases. Phenomenologically, this response arises from direction-dependent coupling between the external magnetic field and the current-induced intrinsic magnetization within the chiral lattice. Furthermore, a persistent nonreciprocal response observed under perpendicular magnetic fields suggests a toroidal-induced effect linked to the electric polarization emerging from the charge-density-wave phase. These results demonstrate that bulk Mo3Al2C serves as an intrinsic platform for tunable nonreciprocal transport rooted in the interplay of chirality, polarity, and superconductivity.

Modelling the ionic transport in battery cells requires precise parametrization of the involved electrolytes. For carbonate-based electrolytes, however, the evaluation of their parameters suffers from interphase effects between the bulk electrolyte and the Li metal electrode, commonly present in the usual electrochemical polarization experiments. In this work, we combine measurements on conductivity and concentration cells with molecular dynamic simulations, avoiding these difficulties and thus, allowing for a more accurate determination of the parameters. We determine the conductivity, the transference number, the thermodynamic factor and the salt diffusion coefficient for three different electrolytes, i.e mixtures of ethylene carbonate (EC), ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC), methyl propionate (MP), dimethyl carbonate (DMC) and propylene carbonate (PC), containing LiPF$_6$ at various concentrations and temperatures. In order to validate the simulated transference numbers, we employ electrophoretic Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy (eNMR).

Accelerating the discovery of structural materials is essential for applications in hard and refractory alloys, hypersonic platforms, nuclear systems, and other extreme environment technologies. Progress is often constrained by slow synthesis and characterization cycles and the need for extensive mechanical testing across large compositional spaces. Here, we propose a rapid screening strategy based on random material libraries, in which thousands of distinct compositions are embedded within a single specimen, mapped by EDS, and subsequently characterized. Using nanoindentation as a representative case, we show that such libraries enable dense composition property mapping while reducing the number of samples required to explore high dimensional composition spaces compared to traditional synthesis and test workflows. An experimentally calibrated Monte Carlo framework is developed to quantify practical limits, including particle size, EDS noise and resolution, positional accuracy, and nanoindenter motion costs. The simulations identify regimes where random libraries provide orders of magnitude acceleration over classical workflows. Finally, we demonstrate experimental navigation of these libraries using automated indentation. Together, these results establish random libraries as a general route to high throughput characterization in structurally critical material systems.

### Zipfian universality of interaction laws: A statistical-mechanics framework for inverse power scaling

- **TL;DR**: 该论文提出了一个统计力学框架，将逆幂律相互作用解释为强异质性微观贡献聚合过程的宏观固定点，而非特定微观机制的结果。

Inverse power-law interaction forms, such as the inverse-square law, recur across a wide range of physical, social, and spatial systems. While traditionally derived from specific microscopic mechanisms, the ubiquity of these laws suggests a more general organizing principle. This article proposes a statistical-mechanics framework in which such interaction laws emerge as macroscopic fixed points of aggregation processes involving strongly heterogeneous microscopic contributions.
  We consider systems where individual interaction sources exhibit heavy-tailed heterogeneity consistent with Zipf-Pareto statistics and where aggregation proceeds without intrinsic length scales. Under minimal assumptions of heterogeneity, multiplicativity, scale invariance, and stability under coarse-graining, we show that the resulting macroscopic interaction field must adopt a scale-free, power-law form. The associated exponent is not imposed a priori but emerges from effective dimensionality, symmetry, and aggregation structure.
  Within this framework, the inverse-square law is interpreted as a stable statistical fixed point corresponding to isotropic aggregation in an effective three-dimensional space, while deviations from this regime naturally arise from anisotropy, constrained geometries, or nontrivial effective dimensions. This perspective provides a unified interpretation of interaction laws observed in physics, spatial economics, and human geography, without invoking domain-specific microscopic mechanisms.
  The proposed framework reframes inverse power-law interactions as robust emergent features of Zipfian aggregation rather than as unique consequences of particular physical forces, thereby offering a common statistical explanation for their cross-disciplinary recurrence.

### Theory of local orbital magnetization: local Berry curvature

We present a microscopic theory for the local (single site) orbital magnetization in tight-binding systems. Each occupied state of energy $\varepsilon_n$ contributes with a local orbital magnetic moment term ${\mathbf{ m}}_n({\mathbf{ r}})$ and a local Berry-curvature term ${\mathbf{ Ω}}_n({\mathbf{ r}})$. For Bloch electrons (${\mathbf{ k}}$-space), we go beyond the modern theory by revealing the sublattice texture. We identify a topological contribution ${\mathbf{ Ω}}^{\text{topo}}_{n\mathbf{ k}}({\mathbf{ r}})$ and a geometric contribution ${\mathbfΩ}^{\text{geom}}_{n\mathbf{ k}}({\mathbf{ r}})$ to the sublattice Berry curvature. For systems with open boundaries (${\mathbf{ r}}$-space), we derive an explicit expression of an effective onsite Berry curvature ${\mathbf{ Ω}}_n({\mathbf{ r}})$. Considering two band models, the $\mathbf{ k}$-space and $\mathbf{ r}$-space onsite magnetizations coincide numerically but differ from the Bianco-Resta approach. They reveal orbital ferromagnetism in topological insulators, and orbital antiferro- and ferrimagnetism in trivial insulators. This theory can be used to investigate orbital magnetic textures and their topological properties in many systems of current interest (Moiré, amorphous, quasicrystals, defects, molecules).

Accurately describing many-body effects in multi-orbital systems remains a major challenge in theoretical condensed matter physics. At present, there is a significant methodological gap between the numerical tools used in ab initio computational materials science and those developed to study strong electronic correlations. The former can treat realistic, large-scale systems but typically neglect many-body effects, while the latter focus on simplified models with only a few degrees of freedom, as only such models can be solved accurately in the presence of strong interactions. The purpose of this thesis is to bridge these two approaches and establish a systematic theoretical framework for realistic correlated electronic materials. This involves a full-cycle methodology that begins with constructing ab initio interacting models from density-functional theory, solving them using dynamical mean-field theory to capture local correlations, and extending beyond to incorporate non-local collective electronic fluctuations. To this end, we introduce the "dual" approach to strong correlations, which includes the dual fermion, dual boson, and dual triply irreducible local expansion methods. The central idea of the dual theories is to shift the reference point of the conventional Feynman diagrammatic expansion from a non-interacting electronic system to an interacting but exactly solvable one. Integrating out this reference system recasts the expansion in an effective dual space, where all diagrammatic building blocks are renormalized by the corresponding impurity quantities. This procedure transforms a non-perturbative expansion in the original variables into a perturbative expansion in terms of dual fermionic and bosonic fields, exact in both the weak- and strong-coupling limits. In this thesis, we collect and systematize the major developments of dual techniques achieved to date.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文提出一种相空间理论方法，通过将电子哈密顿量参数化为核位置和核动量的函数，能够定量描述NO分子的Λ-分裂现象，超越了玻恩-奥本海默近似。

$Λ$-doubling of diatomic molecules is a subtle microscopic phenomenon that has long attracted the attention of experimental groups, insofar as rotation of molecular $\textit{nuclei}$ induces small energetic changes in the (degenerate) $\textit{electronic}$ state. A direct description of such a phenomenon clearly requires going beyond the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. Here we show that a phase space theory previously developed to capture electronic momentum and model vibrational circular dichroism -- and which we have postulated should also describe the Einstein-de Haas effect, a macroscopic manifestation of angular momentum conservation -- is also able to recover the $Λ$-doubling energy splitting (or $Λ$-splitting) of the NO molecule nearly quantitatively. The key observation is that, by parameterizing the electronic Hamiltonian in terms of both nuclear position ($\mathbf{X}$) and nuclear momentum ($\mathbf{P}$), a phase space method yields potential energy surfaces that explicitly include the electron-rotation coupling and correctly conserve angular momentum (which we show is essential to capture $Λ-$doubling). The data presented in this manuscript offers another small glimpse into the rich physics that one can learn from investigating phase space potential energy surfaces $E_{PS}(\mathbf{X},\mathbf{P})$ as a function of both nuclear position and momentum, all at a computational cost comparable to standard Born-Oppenheimer electronic structure calculations.

- **TL;DR**: 非相对论自旋劈裂在部分有序的FeOF中受局域短程有序影响，即使没有长程有序也能产生显著的自旋劈裂，且具有独特的磁光克尔效应特征。

Many studies of non-relativistic spin-splitting (NRSS), or altermagnetism, have focused on idealized, perfectly ordered crystals, relying on symmetry-based approaches to identify candidate materials. Here, we theoretically investigate how local short-range ordering (SRO) influences NRSS of energy bands in partially ordered collinear antiferromagnetic iron oxyfluoride (FeOF). Using the cluster expansion method, we identify four nearly degenerate structures (energy difference $\leq 8$ meV per formula unit) that represent distinct snapshots of local plane-to-plane O/F correlations. Our density functional theory (DFT) results show robust NRSS along the $Γ$-M direction in all four structures, despite the absence of long-range order. The magnitude and character of the splitting depend sensitively on the specific direction of anion correlations, effects that are not fully captured in high-symmetry average structures. Notably, two configurations ($Pmc2_1$ and $Pm$) exhibit $Γ$-point spin splitting absent in ordered FeF$_2$ and a virtual crystal approximation model of FeOF. We further predict distinct magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) signatures, enabling experimental detection of SRO-driven electronic structure changes. These results highlight heteroanionic compounds as a promising design space for NRSS antiferromagnets, with experimentally synthesized FeOF already exhibiting a substantially higher Néel temperature (315\,K) than FeF$_2$ (79\,K).

This identity enables estimation of partition functions, energies, and the Von Neumann entropy by Wilson sampling of forests, avoiding costly Laplacian eigendecompositions. We validate inverse-Laplace reconstructions stabilized by a Stieltjes spectral-density regularization on synthetic networks. The approach is scalable and yields local node and edge thermodynamic descriptors.

We demonstrate tuning of the phononic thermal conductance in single molecules with carbon-chain backbones through modifications of terminal groups and halogen substitution of hydrogen atoms. Our simulations focus on intrinsic molecular properties, and we employ a workflow based on {\it ab initio} molecular dynamics, enabling the training and development of machine-learned interatomic potentials. These potentials are subsequently used in classical nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations to extract thermal conductance coefficients. Replacing terminal methyl groups with amine, sulfur, or halogen substituents leads to pronounced changes in thermal conductance: bromine-terminated chains exhibit the lowest conductance, whereas amine and methyl-terminated chains show the highest. Additionally, single-atom substitution of hydrogen by fluorine or other halogens along the alkane backbone significantly reduces thermal transport. Finally, our simulations of the length dependence of thermal conductance in alkane chains containing 3-12 carbon atoms reveal its saturation beyond eight carbon atoms. Together, our findings show that simple chemical modifications offer a versatile route to controlling phononic heat flow in single molecules.

Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ continues to draw interest for its 326 K phase transition, whose dual electronic and structural nature reflects a complex interplay of electron-hole (excitonic) and electron-lattice interactions. Most studies that have attempted to decipher the relative importance of these interactions, particularly through charge transfer, have been limited to bulk samples. We utilized a thin-flake approach to modify the excitonic interactions in Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ via an underlying film of Au. Using polarized Raman spectroscopy, we found that four layers of Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ supported on conducting Au show a transition temperature that is both reduced by over 100 K and broadened due to an interfacial charge gradient effect, manifesting the presence of excitonic interactions. In contrast, four layers of Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ supported on insulating Al$_2$O$_3$ show nearly bulk-like properties. We also report the development of an all-dry exfoliation and transfer protocol that generalizes substrate engineering for strongly correlated van der Waals materials.

The paper presents resutls of investigation of a natural Ib-IaA diamond containing Y-defects. Analysis of spatial distribution of nitrogen-related A and C centers and intensity of Infra-red absorption at Raman frequency (1332 cm-1) reveals anticorrelation between these defects. Transmission electron microscopy of a zone with abundant Y-defects shows presence of dislocations in various configurations and numerous clusters of point defects generated by non-conservative dislocation motion. Extended defects with shape resembling thin (1-3 nm) rhombic plates with the largest dimension up to 20 nm are observed. Analysis of contrast of these defects shows that they represent nanosized voids (vacancy clusters). It is suggested that the defects were formed by annihilation of dislocation dipoles with subsequent growth by consumption of vacancies produced by non-conservative motion of dislocations. Upon excitation by 787 nm laser, numerous narrow photoluminescecne lines are observed between 800-900 nm; their intensity and position show irregular temporal variations. Such behaviour (blinking) was earlier noted for hydrogenated nanodiamonds. It is suggested that unusual behaviour of the luminescence lines may be explained by recombination processes at internal walls of the discovered nanovoids.

The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) provides a powerful framework for understanding thermalization in isolated quantum many-body systems, yet its physical foundations and minimal underlying assumptions remain actively debated. In this work, we develop a unified framework that clarifies the origin of ETH by separating kinematic typicality from dynamical input. We show that the characteristic ETH structure of local operator matrix elements follows from four ingredients: the maximum entropy principle, the geometry of high-dimensional Hilbert space, the locality of physical observables, and a minimal dynamical principle, which we term the eigenstate typicality principle (ETP). ETP asserts that in quantum-chaotic systems, energy eigenstates are statistically indistinguishable from typical states within a narrow microcanonical shell with respect to local measurements. Within this framework, diagonal ETH emerges from measure concentration, while the universal exponential suppression and smooth energy-frequency dependence of off-diagonal matrix elements arise from entropic scaling and local dynamical correlations, without invoking random-matrix assumptions. Our results establish ETH as a consequence of entropy, geometry, and chaos-induced typicality, and clarify its scope, thereby deepening our understanding of quantum thermalization and the emergence of statistical mechanics from unitary many-body dynamics.

Hole spin qubits in planar germanium heterostructures are frontrunners for scalable semiconductor quantum computing. However, their current performance is mostly limited by large dot-to-dot variability that leads to uncontrolled qubit energies and random tilts in the spin quantization axis. Here, we propose a systematic and local method to engineer the spin qubit response by imprinting a controlled anisotropy in the quantum dot confinement, enabling on-demand electric g-tensor control. In particular, we find that both the quantum-dot size and asymmetry allow electrical tuning of the g-tensor and significantly suppress magnitude and angular variability of the spin response for selected magnetic field directions. We confirm this behavior by analyzing single-disorder realizations and statistical ensembles in state-of-the-art strained and unstrained germanium channels, showing that the latter provides an optimal path for $g$-tensor engineering. Our results provide practical design principles for on-demand control of the spin response and mitigating variability, paving the way towards large-scale germanium-based quantum computers.

We theoretically study Landau quantization of itinerant Majorana quasiparticles induced by lattice strain in a Kitaev spin liquid with Majorana Fermi surfaces. We consider the isotropic spin-1/2 Kitaev model on the honeycomb lattice with a perturbation such as a staggered Zeeman field and an electromagnetic field, which generates small Majorana Fermi surfaces near the Dirac points. By introducing triaxial strain, we create an effective vector potential that couples to Majorana fermions and leads to Landau quantization. Our calculations show that the low-energy spectrum forms discrete pseudo-Landau levels of the Majorana Fermi surface. We further demonstrate that the strain-induced effective vector potential gives rise to pronounced quantum oscillations of the density of states and the specific heat at very low temperatures, in close analogy to the de Haas-van Alphen effect for charged electrons in metals. These results indicate that Landau-quantization-driven "Majorana quantum oscillations" can serve as a probe of the charge-neutral Majorana Fermi surface in Kitaev materials.

The Fermi-Hubbard model and its rich phase diagram naturally emerges as a description for a wide range of electronic systems. Recent advances in semiconductor-superconductor hybrid quantum dot arrays have allowed to realize degenerate quantum systems in a controllable way, e.g., allowing to observe robust zero-bias peaks in Kitaev chains, indicative for Majorana bound states. In this work, we connect these two domains. Noting the strong on-site Coulomb repulsion within quantum dots, we study small arrays of spinful hybrid quantum dots implemented in a two-dimensional electron gas. This system constitutes a Fermi-Hubbard model with inter-site superconducting correlations. For two electronic sites, we find robust zero-bias peaks indicative of a strongly degenerate spectrum hosting emergent Majorana Kramers pairs or $\mathbb{Z}_3$-parafermions. Extending to three sites, we find that these spinful systems scale very differently compared to spinless Kitaev chains. When the sweet-spot conditions are satisfied pairwise, we find that the ground state degeneracy of the full three-site system is lifted. This degeneracy can be restored by tuning the superconducting phase difference between the hybrid segments. However, these states are not robust to quantum dot detuning. Our observations are a first step towards studying degeneracies in strongly interacting Fermi-Hubbard systems with superconducting correlations.

- **TL;DR**: 提出基于XGBoost的电荷预测模型，结合Boltzmann Percentile方法改进自由能计算精度

Free energy calculations are widely used tools in computational chemistry, but their dependence on the assignment of partial charges during force field parametrization reduces their accuracy and reproducibility. In this work, we highlight the direct connection between the low accuracy of AM1-BCC charges on polar species and the poor accuracy of corresponding hydration free energy calculations. We then propose an XGBoost regressor trained on atomic descriptors to rapidly predict charges obtained with high-fidelity density functional theory calculations at PBE0-D3(BJ)/def2-TZVP level. The more accurate electrostatic description results in more reliable free energy calculations than those obtained with semi-empirical AM1-BCC charges. Finally, we leverage this predictive model in combination with a 1 ns gas-phase molecular dynamics simulation to propose the Boltzmann Percentile method for assigning charges representative of the conformational ensemble of a molecule. Charges obtained with this method are robust to different input conformations, and the resulting free energies, calculated on a subset of the FreeSolv dataset, show a root mean squared error of 1.69 kcal/mol against the 3.05 kcal/mol obtained with semi-empirical charges as well as a significantly better ranking. Our method is easily integrable in the traditional workflow and requires the same computational resources. These two aspects make it a realistic tool for enhancing already expensive free energy calculations, and more in general, molecular dynamics simulations in condensed phase.

- **TL;DR**: 提出基于副本交换嵌套采样(RENS)的主动学习策略，用于自动生成训练数据和计算完整相图，在硅、锗、钛等材料上验证了有效性。

Accurate prediction of materials phase diagrams from first principles remains a central challenge in computational materials science. Machine-learning interatomic potentials can provide near-DFT accuracy at a fraction of the cost, but their reliability crucially depends on the availability of representative training data that span all relevant regions of the potential-energy surface. Here, we present a fully automated active-learning (AL) strategy based on replica-exchange nested sampling (RENS) for the generation of training data and the computation of complete pressure-temperature phase diagrams. In our framework, RENS acts as both the exploration engine and the acquisition mechanism: its intrinsic diversity and likelihood-constrained sampling ensure that the configurations selected for DFT labeling are both informative and thermodynamically representative. We apply the approach to silicon, germanium, and titanium using potentials trained at the r2SCAN level of theory. For all systems, the AL process converges within 10-15 iterations, yielding transferable potentials that reproduce known phase transitions and thermodynamic trends. These results demonstrate that RENS-based AL provides a general and autonomous route to constructing machine-learning interatomic potentials and predicting first-principles phase diagrams across broad thermodynamic conditions.

We present a theoretical investigation of wave dynamics in two-dimensional non-Hermitian $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric lattices, where onsite, as well as inter-site control couplings are employed. Our analysis shows that these couplings can be tuned to achieve a direction-sensitive group velocity enhancement beyond what is possible in the uncontrolled (Hermitian) counterpart, while ensuring that the wave packet evolution remains bounded and dynamically stable. We derive a dedicated relation between the control parameters, providing a systematic condition under which stability is guaranteed. We then study the topological properties of the non-Hermitian system at hand, and use an experimental-ready topoelecric metamaterial platform to demonstrate the non-Hermitian couplings realization, and the resulting wave dynamics. This framework paves the way to designing stable and fast wave transport in planar non-Hermitian media.

- **TL;DR**: 提出一种新的基自适应算法，通过浅层Trotter电路进行短时演化，结合对称性滤波和经典对角化，在量子-经典混合平台上高效寻找量子多体系统的基态性质。

A new basis adaptive algorithm for hybrid quantum-classical platforms is introduced to efficiently find the ground-state (gs) properties of quantum many-body systems. The method addresses limitations of many algorithms, such as Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) etc by using shallow Trotterized circuits for short real-time evolution on a quantum processor. The sampled basis is then symmetry-filtered by using various symmetries of the Hamiltonian which is then classically diagonalized in the reduced Hilbert space. We benchmark this approach on the spin-1/2 XXZ chain up to 24 qubits using the IBM Heron processor. The algorithm achieves sub-percent accuracy in ground-state energies across various anisotropy regimes. Crucially, it outperforms the Sampling Krylov Quantum Diagonalization (SKQD) method, demonstrating a substantially lower energy error for comparable reduced-space dimensions. This work validates symmetry-filtered, real-time sampling as a robust and efficient path for studying correlated quantum systems on current near-term hardware.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文通过经典计算模拟量子算法iQCC，在过渡金属配合物激发态计算中达到0.05 eV误差，确定了量子优势可能出现在约200逻辑量子比特的阈值。

Molecular simulations are widely regarded as leading candidates to demonstrate quantum advantage--defined as the point at which quantum methods surpass classical approaches in either accuracy or scale. Yet the qubit counts and error rates required to realize such an advantage remain uncertain; resource estimates for ground-state electronic structure span orders of magnitude, and no quantum-native method has been validated at a commercially relevant scale. Here we address this uncertainty by executing the iterative qubit coupled-cluster (iQCC) algorithm, designed for fault-tolerant quantum hardware, at unprecedented scale using a quantum solver on classical processors, enabling simulations of transition organo-metallic complexes requiring hundreds of logical qubits and millions of entangling gates. Using this approach, we compute the lowest triplet excited state (T$_1$) energies of Ir(III) and Pt(II) phosphorescent organometallic compounds and show that iQCC achieves the lowest mean absolute error (0.05 eV) and highest R$^2$ (0.94) relative to experiment, outperforming leading classical methods. We find these systems remain classically tractable up to $\sim$200 logical qubits, establishing the threshold at which quantum advantage in computational chemistry may emerge and clarifying resource requirements for future quantum computers.

We analyze the equilibrium states of quantum lattice model with local multi-well potentials for Sn$_2$P$_2$S$_6$ ferroelectric crystals using the mean and Gaussian curvatures ($H$, $K$), curvedness ($C$) and shape index ($S$). From the energy gap, pressure and temperature variations of $H$, $K$, $C$ and $S$, we have reported the geometric construction of the free energy surfaces for the ferroelectric and paraelectric phases. Their behaviors are explicitly observed near the ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transitions. It is found that $H$, $C$ and $S$ display a cusp singularity at the criticality while $K$ converges to zero on both sides of the critical and tricritical points.

The observed robustly quantized Hall conductance in quantum Hall systems and Chern insulators (CI) have so far been understood in terms of the topology of isolated systems, which are not coupled to leads. It is assumed that the leads act as inert reservoirs that simply supply/absorb electrons to/from the sample. Within a model of a CI coupled to leads with a cylindrical geometry, we show that this is not true. In the proximity of the CI, the edge current leaks into the leads, with the Hall conductance quantized only if this novel proximity effect is taken into account. For a special choice of leads, we identify the conductance with a topological invariant of the system, in terms of the winding number of the phase of the reflection coefficients of the scattering states.

### Hund's coupling driven nature of magnetism in negative charge transfer material, $\mathrm{SrCoO_3}$

In this work, we investigate the microscopic origin of magnetism in $\mathrm{SrCoO_3}$ by incorporating electronic correlations within the dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) framework. We note a remarkable agreement of the calculated magnetic observables ( saturation magnetization $\sim$2.4 $μ_B$; magnetic transition temperature, $T_c$$\sim$350 K) with the experimental results. The system exhibits Hund's coupling-induced strong quasiparticle mass enhancements of upto $m^*/m$ $\sim$7 for Co 3$d$ states, with the largest renormalization occurring in the majority spin $t_{2g}$ orbitals, marking the onset of orbital-selectivity. Our results reveal a Stoner-$like$ collapse of exchange splitting that drives the loss of long-range ferromagnetic order at $T_c$. The breakdown of Fermi-liquid behavior down to $T$$\sim$100 K suggests a suppressed coherence scale. Local magnetic moment originates from a mixed-spin configuration formed through dynamical fluctuation between intermediate-spin and high-spin states. Large charge fluctuations ($\langle$$Δ$N$^2$$\rangle$$\sim$0.6) together with heavy quasiparticles establish the correlation effects regime, governed predominantly by Hund's physics in $\mathrm{SrCoO_3}$.

Graphite, the standard commercial anode for Li-ion batteries, is thermodynamically incompatible with Na-ion batteries, leading researchers to search for alternative C-based structures (e.g., hard carbon, expanded graphite). In a simplified picture, the main idea of such search relies on identifying disordered C structures with a large interlayer spacing and distribution of local structural motifs (e.g., pores) with target electrochemical properties. Such exploration is typically done via trial-and-error experimentation, which often does not allow precise understanding of the role of interlayer distance and even Na/Li-ion intercalation in the electrochemical performance. Motivated by this, using density-functional theory and cluster expansion, we establish a structure-property relationship for Li- and Na-intercalation across a range of graphite interlayer spacings and stacking arrangements. We show that Na intercalation becomes thermodynamically possible in large concentrations above 4.21 Å even without a change in interlayer spacing. Conversely, Li intercalation has a narrow optimal window, with maximum capacity (close to the commercial limit) at approximately 3.75 Å, while larger spacings (e.g., 4.58 Å) quickly reduce Li storage capacity. We also find that AA-stacked domains consistently offer stronger ion bonding and higher voltages than AB-stacked domains for both ions. Our results, thus, not only explain the role of metal ion intercalation in the electrochemical performance, but also clarify the fundamental design trade-offs for expanded C anodes, offering practical targets and interlayer distance ranges for the independent optimization of the next generation of negative electrodes for metal-ion batteries.

Topological magnetic textures confined to two-dimensional (2D) non-orientable manifolds exhibit behaviors absent in planar systems. We investigate bimerons on Möbius surfaces and show that the lack of global orientation alters conservation laws, yielding geometry-dependent topology and dynamics. Micromagnetic simulations reveal that the helical twist and non-orientable geometry reshape the effective topological charge and stabilize chiral configurations imposed by the surface. Under spin-polarized currents, bimerons display unconventional transport: the transverse response is locally reversed or globally suppressed due to charge inversion along the manifold. Moreover, we establish an Aharonov-Bohm effect associated with the magnonic modes of the texture; in particular, the translational Goldstone mode implies that a bimeron on a Möbius strip should exhibit path-dependent quantum interference. These results identify a geometry-driven regime of magnetization dynamics and provide a route to curvature-engineered spintronic functionalities.

Graphite exhibits multi-stage phase transitions in the quantum-limit states realized by magnetic fields applied along the c-axis. Despite extensive studies on this phenomenon, the origin remains a matter of debate to this day. We performed high-field magnetotransport measurements on single crystals of graphite, focusing on the non-linear conductivity in pulsed-magnetic fields of up to 75 T. The longitudinal magnetoresistance exhibits distinct non-linearity not only in the first but also in the second field-induced phases.

In compound semiconductors and insulators, the polar electron-phonon coupling diverges at long range, known as the Fröhlich interaction. Modern first-principles electron-phonon calculations treat the Fröhlich interaction in a semiclassical electrostatic formalism based on density-functional perturbation theory. Here, using many-body $GW$ perturbation theory, we reveal important electron correlation effects in the Fröhlich-type electron-phonon coupling, which are missed by the prevailing approaches. Going beyond the electrostatic treatment, we derive and implement the $GW$ self-energy contribution to the long-range polar electron-phonon coupling, and demonstrate its critical role and nontrivial behaviors in properties such as electron linewidth and polaron formation. Our work establishes the many-body generalization of the Fröhlich interaction that is essential for accurate electron-phonon calculations at the full $GW$ level combined with Wannier interpolation techniques.

- **TL;DR**: 在最低朗道能级（N=0）的ν=5/8填充因子处意外发现了条纹/向列相，这是复合费米子的新型相态，由复合费米子之间的剩余长程相互作用驱动。

Electronic stripe/nematic phases are fascinating strongly-correlated states characterized by spontaneous rotational symmetry breaking. In the quantum Hall regime, such phases typically emerge at half-filled, high-orbital-index ($N\geq2$) Landau levels (LLs) where the short-range Coulomb interaction is softened by the nodes of electron wave functions. In the lowest ($N=0$) LLs, these phases are not expected. Instead, composite fermion (CF) liquids and fractional quantum Hall states, which are well explained in the picture of weakly interacting CF quasiparticles, are favored. Here we report the observation of an unexpected stripe/nematic phase in the \textit{lowest} LL at filling factor $ν=5/8$ in ultrahigh-quality GaAs two-dimensional \textit{hole} systems, evinced by a pronounced in-plane transport anisotropy. Remarkably, $ν=5/8$ can be mapped to a half-filled, high-index CF LL ($N_{\text{CF}}=2$), analogous to the $N=2$ hole LL. Our finding signals a novel stripe/nematic phase of CFs, driven by the residual long-range interaction among these emergent quasiparticles. This phase is surprisingly robust, surviving up to $\sim$100 mK. Its absence in electron-type systems suggests that severe LL mixing stemming from the large hole effective mass and non-linear LL fan diagram plays a crucial role in modifying the CF-CF interaction.

The interplay between magnetic order, charge dynamics, and crystal field excitations underpins the emergent ground states of rare-earth intermetallics. Using time-domain terahertz spectroscopy, we probe this coupling in PrSi, a metallic ferromagnet. The optical response exhibits pronounced Drude-Smith behavior over a broad temperature range, indicating persistent carrier scattering. A classical Kondo-lattice model (CKLM) attributes this non-Drude conductivity to scattering of itinerant electrons by localized magnetic moments, persisting down to temperatures well below the magnetic ordering scale. At lower temperatures, beyond the scope of CKLM, our experiment reveals that the response is dominated by crystal-field excitations, with sharp transitions at 0.6 THz and 1.54 THz. The mode at 1.54 THz shows a dynamic correlation with the onset of ferromagnetic order, marking the onset of a crystal-field-governed low temperature regime.

(Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$)$_2$Te$_3$ alloys are non-degenerate topological insulators (TIs) whose Dirac point (DP) can be tuned within the bulk bandgap by varying the composition, effectively reducing bulk conduction while allowing surface carrier conduction. Magnetotransport measurements of a series of (Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$)$_2$Te$_3$ thin films indicate electron-dominated conduction, with weak anti-localization attributed to topological surface states (TSSs). Due to the similarity of phase coherence lengths and twin boundary spacings ($\sim$100 nm), we consider the role of twin boundaries as additional conducting paths. Density functional theory calculations reveal an enhanced density of states near the Fermi level at $60^\circ$ twin boundaries, with 2D carrier concentration in excess of $3 \times 10^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$. Furthermore, an analysis of the longitudinal magnetoconductivity yields an upper bound of $7.3 \times 10^{-4}$ S for twin boundary conductivity, resulting in a carrier mobility as high as $142$ cm$^2$/(V$\cdot$s). We discuss the role of twin boundaries in facilitating a transition from a massive Dirac cone dispersion to gapless, topologically protected surface states. Understanding the role of twin boundaries on carrier conduction in non-degenerate TIs is critical for the development of novel TI-based electronic devices.

Understanding the dynamical response of quantum materials is central to revealing their microscopic properties, yet access to long-time and large-scale dynamics remains severely limited by rapidly growing computational costs and entanglement, particularly in gapless systems. Here we introduce an autoregressive machine-learning framework that enables the extrapolation of dynamical spin correlations in both time and space beyond the reach of conventional numerical methods. Trained on time-dependent density matrix renormalization group simulations of the gapless XXZ model, our approach is benchmarked against exact solutions available for this analytically solvable system. Combined with physics-informed spatial extension, multi-layer perceptron model using ReLU activation functions has been shown to be superior than convolutional neural networks and linear regressions for longer time extrapolation. Perturbation study of error accumulation further demonstrates that our autoregressive neural network extrapolations are highly robust to perturbations, suggesting stable and reliable predictions. This work establishes a new paradigm for studying the dynamics of gapless quantum many-body systems, in which machine learning extends and complements the capabilities of state-of-the-art numerical approaches.

Perovskite oxides ($AB$O$_3$) have long been central to the advancement of modern condensed matter physics, owing to their rich and tunable electronic and magnetic properties. The quest to understand their various entangled phases has spurred the development of both cutting-edge experimental tools and innovative theoretical frameworks. In recent times, the emergence of high entropy oxides - materials in which five or more elements share a single crystallographic site - has introduced a powerful new paradigm in materials design. Embedding such extreme chemical disorder within the perovskite framework has opened vast opportunities for realizing novel physical phenomena inaccessible in conventional oxides. This review surveys the rapid advances in the synthesis, characterization, and exploration of the electronic and magnetic properties of compositionally complex perovskite oxides, offering key insights and highlighting promising avenues for future research.

We present the sign-problem-free quantum Monte Carlo study of the half-filled Hubbard model on two-dimensional quasicrystals, revealing how specific aperiodic geometries fundamentally dictate quantum criticality. By comparing the Penrose and Thue-Morse quasicrystals, we demonstrate that the nature of the magnetic phase transition is controlled by the electronic density of states (DOS): while the singular DOS of the Penrose tiling induces magnetic order at infinitesimal interaction strengths, the Thue-Morse lattice requires a finite critical interaction to drive the transition. Crucially, through a novel boundary construction strategy and rigorous finite-size scaling, we identify a quantum critical point on the Thue-Morse quasicrystal with critical exponents ($ν\approx 0.94$, $β\approx 0.72$ and $z\approx 1.51$) that deviate significantly from the conventional $(2+1)$D Heisenberg $O(3)$ class. These findings establish the existence of a novel universality class driven by the interplay between electronic correlations and aperiodic geometry, challenging standard paradigms of magnetic criticality in two dimensions.

Monolayer 1{\it T}$^{\prime}$-$\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$ exhibits spin- and valley-dependent massive tilted Dirac cones with two velocity correction terms in low-energy effective Hamiltonian. We theoretically investigate the longitudinal diffusive magneto-conductivity of monolayer 1{\it T}$^{\prime}$-$\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$ by using the linear response theory. It is shown that the Weiss oscillations are polarized in spin and valley degrees of freedom, under uniform electric fields and a weak one-dimensional spatially-periodic electrostatic potential modulation. The spin polarization, the valley polarization and the spin-valley polarization can be switched by flipping the external electric fields. The polarization is found not only in the amplitudes but also in the periods of the Weiss oscillations. It is found that the period polarization in Weiss oscillations originates from the polarized effective Fermi energies or the polarized Landau level spacing scales. In Weiss oscillations, polarization in amplitude does not imply the presence of polarization in period, whereas polarization in period is accompanied by polarization in amplitude. The superposition of polarization in amplitude and polarization in period enables the appearance of considerable polarization in Weiss oscillations under relatively weak external electric fields.

- **TL;DR**: 在有机金属κ-(BEDT-TTF)₂Hg(SCN)₂Br中，在约3 kbar压力区间内观察到具有巨大磁滞回线的巨磁阻效应，该效应与磁场方向无关，表明源于自旋玻璃态与强电子关联的电荷-自旋纠缠。

The giant magnetoresistance with a huge hysteresis is observed in the organic metal k-(BEDTTTF)2Hg(SCN)2Br at low temperature in a pressure interval around 3 kbar of a width ~1 kbar. The hysteretic magnetoresistance is isotropic with respect to the direction of magnetic field, which excludes the orbital effect of magnetic field as its origin. The observed temperature and magnetic-field dependence of this hysteresis and of its relaxation time indicates the strong influence of spin-glass state on magnetoresistance. Although a quantitative theory of this effect, originating from strong electronic correlations, requires complex numerical calculations, we suggest its explanation and a simple model which qualitatively describes the observed magnetoresistance behavior and shows a strong charge-spin entanglement. The proposed effect suggests a new class of extreme magnetoresistance mechanisms.

- **TL;DR**: 通过第一性原理计算研究SbXY（X=Se,Te; Y=Br,I）Janus层的热电性能，发现SbSeBr在1000K时ZT值达0.6，具有优异的高温热电应用潜力。

We report a comprehensive investigation of the thermoelectric properties of SbXY (X = Se, Te; Y = Br, I) Janus layers (JL) using spin-polarized first-principles calculations. Ab initio molecular dynamics confirm that the 1T phase ($Pm31$) remains stable up to 1000 K, excluding any phase transitions. The calculated mean-square displacement further evidences the structural robustness. The thermal conductivity is strongly suppressed in Br-containing layers due to enhanced Froehlich interactions between optical and acoustic phonons. Electronic structure calculations reveal indirect band gaps of 1.1 to 1.3 eV, with valence and conduction bands dominated by the $p$-orbitals of halogen/chalcogen and of Sb, respectively. The carrier effective mass highlights anisotropic transport with lighter electrons being more mobile, while holes dominate the power factor, which attains values on the order of mW/mK$^2$. Direction-dependent transport indicates superior thermoelectric performance along the $xx$ direction, with negligible contribution along $yy$. The Figure of Merit reaches 0.6 at 1000 K in hole-doped SbSeBr, demonstrating strong potential for high-temperature applications. Our results reveal that the SbXY JLs, particularly SbSeBr, emerge as promising candidates for next-generation thermoelectric devices at elevated temperatures.

The dynamics of a cycloidal spin structure driven by an AC magnetic field is theoretically studied in the weak-field limit. A specific model Hamiltonian describing the cycloidal spin structure in a ferromagnetic thin film is constructed, and its dynamics is analyzed using the collective-coordinate approach within the Lagrangian formalism. We demonstrate that the cycloidal spin structure exhibits a unidirectional gliding motion under an AC magnetic field, and an expression for the average velocity is derived as a function of the magnitude, the direction, and the frequency of the AC magnetic field. We compare our theoretical predictions with the results of micromagnetic simulations and identify two resonance frequencies determined by the eigenenergies of the excitation modes. Furthermore, evaluating spin motive forces induced by the dynamics reveals a substantial DC voltage, which may be exploited in energy-harvesting devices utilizing ambient electromagnetic radiation.

- **TL;DR**: BiCrTeO6是一种新型自旋驱动多铁性材料，在11K和16K处有两个连续反铁磁转变，11K时出现铁电序，表现出磁介电耦合和弛豫特性。

Low-dimensional magnetic systems based on honeycomb lattices provide a promising platform for exploring exotic quantum phenomena that emerge from the intricate interplay of competing spin, orbital, lattice, and dipolar degrees of freedom. Here, we present a comprehensive study of the layered honeycomb lattice antiferromagnet BiCrTeO$_6$ using magnetization, specific heat, muon spin--relaxation ($μ$SR) spectroscopy, dielectric, pyrocurrent, and high-resolution synchrotron X-ray diffraction (SXRD) measurements. Our results reveal an array of intriguing and strongly correlated phenomena, including two successive antiferromagnetic transitions at $T_{\rm N1}\approx16$ K and $T_{\rm N2}\approx11$ K, a pronounced magnetodielectric coupling effect, and ferroelectric order at $T_{\rm N2}$. Consequently, this compound emerges as a new spin-driven multiferroic system. The SXRD analysis reveals a magnetoelastic-coupling-induced structural phase transition at $T_{\rm N2}$, characterized by a symmetry lowering from P$\bar{3}$1c (163) to P31c (159), which likely triggers the onset of ferroelectricity. In addition to its low-temperature multiferroic behavior, the system exhibits dielectric relaxor characteristics at higher temperatures within the paramagnetic region ($T&lt;50$ K), which is intrinsically linked to the antisite disorder of Cr and Te atoms.

- **TL;DR**: 通过等离子体辅助合成调控NiO薄膜中的缺陷化学，利用O₂和H₂O控制空位形成和羟基化，从而调节晶格氧反应性和OER催化性能。

Controlling lattice oxygen reactivity in earth abundant OER catalysts requires precise tuning of defect chemistry in the oxide lattice. Here, we combine DFT+U calculations with plasma assisted synthesis to show how O2 and H2O in the discharge govern vacancy formation, electronic structure, and catalytic predisposition in NiO thin films. Oxygen rich plasmas generate isolated and clustered Ni vacancies that stabilize oxygen ligand hole states and produce shallow O 2p Ni 3d hybrid levels, enhancing Ni O covalency. In contrast, introducing H2O during growth drives local hydroxylation that compensates vacancy induced Ni3+ centers, restoring Ni2+ like coordination, suppressing deep divacancy derived in gap states, and introducing shallow Ni O H derived valence-band tails. EXAFS confirms that hydroxylation perturbs only the local environment while preserving the medium-range NiO lattice, and Ni L-edge spectroscopy shows a persistent but redistributed ligand-hole population. These complementary vacancy and hydroxylation driven pathways provide a plasma controlled route to pre define electronic defect landscapes in NiO and to tune its activation toward OER relevant NiOOH formation.

- **TL;DR**: 氢化石墨烯的量子霍尔效应测量显示，氢化使能带结构从线性狄拉克-外尔色散转变为二次色散，有效电子质量变为0.24倍电子质量

We have measured the quantum Hall effect in monolayer graphene samples that were exposed to a cold hydrogen plasma leading to a hydrogenation level of a few percent. Compared to pristine graphene, the Landau level distance significantly decreases in the hydrogenated structures, and its field dependence changes from square root type to linear. From this observation we conclude that the band structure in hydrogenated graphene changes from a linear Dirac-Weyl type dispersion to a quadratic one with an effective electron mass $m_e^* = 0.24~m_e$. This is in good agreement with ab-initio band structure calculations of hydrogen decorated graphene monolayer.

In this work we extend our study of the effect of certain crystallographic defects on the spin-1/2 Kitaev honeycomb spin liquid (arXiv:2511.19409), focusing on its gapless phase and contrasting with the gapped phase. We identify a Stone-Wales (SW) local defect consisting of a 90$^\circ$ bond rotation that preserves Kitaev bond labels for edge-sharing octahedra and thereby enables exact solvability. These SW-type defects involve odd-sided plaquettes with $\pm π/2$ fluxes, but can be created locally. An isolated defect hosts a time-reversal pair of ground-state flux configurations with large net chirality. Certain excitations are also chiral. The chirality manifests in Majorana local Chern marker and in scalar spin chirality, producing electronic orbital magnetization. T-matrix analysis and numerics at finite defect density $n_d$ show that defect chiralities generate a topological gap of $11 n_d$ protecting a Chern number $C=\pm 1$. Emergent ferromagnetic long range Ising interactions $r^{-γ}$ with $2&lt;γ&lt; 3$ between defect chiralities lead to a finite temperature $T_c$ phase transition into the chiral spin liquid. The $T_c$ is proportional to $n_d$ and diverges when $γ\rightarrow 2$. We also consider additional solvable impurity potentials and find that $γ$ can be reduced to below $2.3$ and correspondingly enhance $T_c$. Our results offer applications to 2D Dirac cone systems with a finite density of fluctuating Ising magnetic impurities and to identifying spin liquids with lattice defects.

### Observation of magnetically coupled electro-optic effect in LiNbO3/LiTaO3 at room temperature

The magnetoelectric coupling effect serves as a crucial bridge between electrical and magnetic order parameters in condensed matter physics, forming the physical basis for the development of next-generation low-power information storage and sensing technologies. However, material systems exhibiting this effect at room temperature are extremely rare, and the coupling strength is typically very weak, which has long hindered the practical application of such phenomena despite their rich tunability. Here, we break this by reporting a pronounced magnetoelectric phenomenon,the magnetically coupled EO effect in the classic ferroelectric optical materials LiNbO3 and LiTaO3. We trace its origin to an unexpected source,the problematic direct current drift,a major reliability issue in photonic integrated circuits. We unambiguously demonstrate that this drift stems not from mobile ions but from defect-bound unpaired electrons, whose slow polarization relaxation is quenched upon the magnetic-field-induced formation of a room-temperature skyrmion states, as directly visualized by Lorentz transmission electron microscopy. This collective spin ordering not only solves the decades-old drift problem but also transforms the defect states into a magnetically responsive platform, exhibiting an efficiency up to 34 pm/V in LiNbO3 and 15 pm/V in LiTaO3-an orders-of-magnitude enhancement over conventional room-temperature magnetoelectric responses and even surpassing the materials' intrinsic Pockels coefficients. We also measured the magnetic response of this additional electro-optical effect and found that under the condition of applying a magnetic field of 0.1 T, an electro-optical coefficient adjustment of about 8 pm/V can be achieved (0.008 pm/V/Oe), which is equivalent to 30% of the electro-optical coefficient of LiNbO3 itself.

The insulator-quasi-metal (bad metal) transition observed in Jahn-Teller (JT) magnets orthonickelates RNiO$_3$ (R = rare earth, or yttrium Y) is considered a canonical example of the Mott transition, traditionally described in the framework of Hubbard's $U-t$ model. However, in reality, the insulating phase of nickelates is the result of charge disproportionation (CD) with the formation of a system of spin-triplet ($S = 1$) electron [NiO$_6$]$^{10-}$ and spinless ($S = 0$) hole [NiO$_6$]$^{8-}$ centers, equivalent to a system of effective spin-triplet composite bosons moving in a nonmagnetic lattice. The effective CD-phase Hamiltonian takes into account local ($U$) and nonlocal ($V$) correlations, and the transfer of composite bosons ($t_b$). Within the framework of the effective field approximation, we have shown the existence of two types of CD phases: the high-temperature classical paramagnetic CO-phase of charge ordering of electron and hole centers, and the low-temperature magnetic quantum CDq phase with charge and spin density transfer between electron and hole centers, with ''uncertain valence'' [NiO$_{6}$]$^{(9\pmδ)-}$ ($0 \le δ\le 1$) and spin density $(1 \pm δ)/2$ NiO$_6$-centers. In the classical CO phase, spin-triplet electron centers are surrounded by the nearest nonmagnetic hole centers, which ''turns off'' the strong superexchange interaction of the nearest neighbors. The magnetic ordering in the quantum CDq phase is determined by a strong traditional superexchange and an unusual bosonic double exchange mechanism.

Steel is a key structural material because of its considerable strength and ductility. However, when exposed to hydrogen, it is prone to embrittlement. Mechanistic understanding of the origin of hydrogen embrittlement is hampered by the lack of reliable interatomic potentials. Here, we perform large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of crack propagation after having developed and validated an efficient yet density-functional-theory-accurate machine-learning potential for hydrogen in iron. Simulations based on our potential reveal that in the absence of H, iron is intrinsically ductile at finite temperatures with crack-tip blunting assisted by dislocation emission. By contrast, minute (part-per-million) hydrogen concentrations can switch the crack-tip behavior from ductile blunting to brittle propagation. Detailed analysis of our molecular dynamics results reveals that the combination of fast hydrogen diffusion and diminished surface energy is at the origin of embrittlement. Our results set the stage for a modified Griffith's criterion for hydrogen-induced brittle fracture, which closely captures the simulations and that can be used to assess embrittlement in iron-based alloys.

Reproducibility and quantization in quantum spin Hall platforms is a persisting challenge, limiting their use in hybrid realizations of topological superconductivity. We report robust and reproducible quantized transport in a graphene quantum Hall topological insulator, stabilized at low magnetic fields by screening long-range Coulomb interactions with a metallic Bi$_2$Se$_3$ back gate. Beyond quantized resistance plateaus, we demonstrate mode-resolved control via gate-defined chiral-helical junctions that selectively transmit or backscatter a single helical channel, a capability inaccessible in time-reversal symmetric quantum spin Hall systems. Targeted experiments and simulations identify contact-induced doping, effectively creating unintended chiral-helical interfaces, as a generic mechanism for quantization breakdown, which is mitigated by large area contacts that enhance edge-channel equilibration. Our findings establish metal screened graphene as a gate-tunable, interaction-driven helical system with quantized transport, spatially separable helical channels, and compatibility with superconducting proximity for topological devices.

Ionic diffusion in solids is central to energy storage, electronics, and catalysis, yet its chemical origins are difficult to resolve because conventional diffusion models struggle with effects of confinement, crystallographic disorder, lattice distortions, and coupling to electronic or phononic carriers. These challenges are especially pronounced in battery materials, where ionic and electronic motion occur together, complicating interpretation of electrochemical measurements. Here we use tracer exchange as a direct, non-electrochemical probe to reveal distinct ion-transport regimes in the one-dimensional conductor olivine Li_xFePO4 (0 &lt;= x &lt;= 1). Lithium isotope exchange validates single-file diffusion governed by strong ion-ion correlations, where 1D confinement suppresses bypassing and preserves spatial order. Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations and chronoamperometry quantify both Faradaic and non-Faradaic surface exchange, identifying electron transport, rather than Li+ mobility, as the rate-limiting step for electrochemical reaction. In addition, Li-Na exchange exhibits apparent superdiffusion, with rates that increase with Na content. Simulations attribute this behavior to surface-exchange limitations and Na-induced lattice strain that enhances cross-channel Li+ hopping and drives a crossover from 1D to quasi-2D transport. Four-dimensional STEM, in situ synchrotron XRD, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and Mossbauer spectroscopy confirm that lattice softening and concerted polaron motion contribute to the observed dynamics. These results establish tracer exchange as a powerful tool for probing coupled ion-electron transport and provide chemical insight into how lattice mechanics and multicomponent exchange shape ionic diffusion in solids.

Three-dimensional (3D) magnetic nanostructures offer unprecedented opportunities for engineering emergent spin textures, but controlling their configuration remains a central challenge. Here we show that conformally coated Ni Nanotubes arranged in a woodpile geometry with lattice spacings ranging from 800 to 1200 nm, realised by two-photon lithography and atomic layer deposition, exhibit a geometry-tuneable balance between chiral and axial states. Magnetic force microscopy on the top layer of the 3D woodpile reveals that few-layer systems exhibit a chiral contrast whilst increasing the number of stacked layers drives a transition to an axial configuration with the change in state populations depending strongly on lattice spacing. Micromagnetic simulations demonstrate that chirality is not intrinsic to isolated tubes but is imprinted by spin textures formed in the substrate sheet film, which couple into the 3D network. As the sheet-film influence diminishes with increasing layer number, dipolar interactions dominate and stabilise the axial state. This two-stage mechanism of chirality imprinting followed by increasingly dominant dipolar interactions, provides clear control parameters for tailoring spin-texture populations. Our results establish conformally coated woodpiles as a reconfigurable 3D ferromagnetic metamaterial platform that can be exploited for data storage, magnonics, and neuromorphic computing.

We successfully synthesized a novel intermetallic compound $\rm CrFe_2Ge_2$ with the $\rm Fe_{13}Ge_{8}$-type crystal structure. A structural study is presented combining single-crystal X-ray diffraction and Mössbauer spectroscopy analysis, confirming the presence of two distinct Fe sublattices. $\rm CrFe_2Ge_2$ exhibits a metallic ferromagnetic state with $T_C \approx \rm 200~K$. This material does not follow the usual $M^2 \propto H/M$ Arrott law, rather a modified Arrott law is obeyed in this material. The critical exponents determined from detailed analysis of modified Arrott plots were found to be $β= 0.392$, $γ= 1.309$ and $δ= 4.26$ obtained from the critical isotherm at $ T_{\rm C} =\rm 200~K$. Self-consistency and reliability of the critical exponent analysis were verified by the Widom scaling law and scaling equations. Using the results from renormalization group calculation, the critical behavior of $\rm CrFe_2Ge_2$ is akin to that of a $d=3, n=3$ ferromagnet in which the magnetic exhange distance is found to decay as $J(r) \approx r^{-4.86}$ with long-range magnetic coupling. The evaluated Rhodes-Wohlfarth ratio of $\sim 3$ points to an itinerant ferromagnetic ground state. Low-temperature measurements of resistivity, $p(T)$, and specific heat, $C_P(T)$, reveal a pronounced contribution from electron-magnon scattering.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究建立了磁性手性波波（CBs）的解析模型，预测其半径与磁场、DMI、各向异性及交换作用的函数关系，并通过微磁模拟验证。研究发现了两种CBs湮灭机制：液滴状不稳定性和布洛赫点脱钉扎机制，并揭示了一种新的碎片化路径。

Magnetic chiral bobbers (CBs) are three-dimensional (3D) topological spin textures that consist of a tapered skyrmion tube terminating in a Bloch point, promising applications in high-density spintronics. However, the mechanisms controlling their size and the dynamics of their annihilation are still not fully understood. In this study, we present an analytical model that predicts the radius $R$ of the CB as a function of the external magnetic field, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), the magnetic anisotropy, and the exchange interaction. The micromagnetic simulations validate this model across a broad range of parameters. We also identify two mechanisms of annihilation of CBs: (i) a droplet-like instability that occurs under rapid changes in the magnetic field, which we describe using a proposed magnetic Weber number $We$ and its critical field step scaling; and (ii) Bloch point depinning mechanism at interfaces, for which we determine the threshold magnetic field $B_{\text{th}}$ for annihilation. Importantly, we uncover a novel fragmentation pathway in which CBs transform into skyrmion tubes, then into half-CBs, and finally into ferromagnetic states. These findings lay the groundwork for understanding and manipulating 3D CBs as next-generation devices.

We introduce theoretical methods for describing the optical response of two-dimensional (2D) materials patterned at the nanoscale into both arrays of ribbons along a planar surface and spherical particles. Fourier-Floquet decompositions of the electromagnetic fields are used in order to obtain the reflectance, transmittance and absorbance of the nanoribbon array. The spherical particles consist of a vacuum or dielectric core, coated by single 2D material layers. A Mie theory, with boundary conditions modified to accommodate a 2D material at the interface, is applied to theoretically examine these spherical particles. As examples of 2D materials, we consider the excitonic response of hexagonal boron nitride in the ultraviolet, and of the transition-metal dichalcogenide WS2 in the visible. The most important steps and equations for implementing the various methods are provided as a means to an easy introduction to the theory of patterned 2D materials. This renders the article a toolset for investigating the patterning of any 2D material with the intention to tune their optical response and/or introduce hybridization schemes with their excitons. The methods are not restricted to exciton polaritons in 2D semiconductors, but can be applied, by simple replacement of the optical conductivity, to 2D materials exhibiting any polaritonic response.

Two-dimensional (2D) diamond has aroused tremendous interest in nanoelectronics and optoelectronics, owing to its superior properties and flexible characteristics compared to bulk diamond. Despite significant efforts, great challenges lie in the experimental synthesis and transformation conditions of 2D diamond. Herein, we have demonstrated the experimental preparation of high quality 2D diamond with controlled thickness and distinguished properties, realized by laser-heating few-layer graphene in diamond anvil cell. The quenched 2D diamond exhibited narrow T2g Raman peak (linewidth ~3.6 cm-1) and intense photoluminescence of SiV- (linewidth ~6.1 nm) and NV0 centers. In terms of transformation mechanism, atomic structures of hybrid phase interfaces suggested that the intermediate rhombohedral phase subtly mediate hexagonal graphite to cubic diamond transition. Furthermore, the tunable optical bandgap and thermal stability of 2D diamond sensitively depend on its sp3 concentration. We believe our results can shed light on the structural design and preparation of many carbon allotropes and further uncover the underlying transition mechanism.

We present a unified quantum field theory for Dirac magnons coupled to emergent gauge fields. At zero temperature, any space- and time-dependent gauge perturbation drives magnons out of equilibrium, generating spin currents and magnon accumulation without conventional thermal or chemical potential gradients. For a honeycomb ferromagnet, we derive closed-form expressions for the induced density and current. In the DC limit, the transverse spin conductivity quantizes to $σ^{xy}=α^2\text{sgn}(m)\hbar/4π$, a magnonic analog of the quantum Hall effect, where $m$ is the topological magnon mass and $α$ a dimensionless coupling constant. In the AC regime, the conductivity exhibits a sharp resonance when the drive frequency matches the topological gap $Δ$, signaling interband transitions. Our work establishes gauge fields as a versatile tool for controlling magnon transport and reveals topologically protected quantized responses.

Flexible ferroelectrics possess significant potential for wearable electronics and bio-inspired devices, yet their electromechanical coupling mechanisms under dynamic bending remain elusive. This study employs phase-field simulations to investigate the effects of bending deformation on domain structures and macroscopic ferroelectric responses in (SrTiO3)10/(PbTiO3)10/(SrTiO3)10 trilayer films. By constructing computational models for upward-concave (U-shaped) and downward-concave (N-shaped) configurations, we analyze the regulation of polarization patterns by strain distributions under varying curvature radii. The results demonstrate that the two bending modes generate opposite through-thickness strain gradients: U-shaped bending produces compressive strain in the upper layer and tensile strain in the lower, while N-shaped bending yields the reverse. These inhomogeneous strains drive distinct polarization reconfigurations within the PTO layer. While stable vortex-antivortex pairs persist at moderate curvatures, reducing the bending radius triggers divergent topological transitions -- U-shaped bending transforms vortex pairs into zigzag-like domains, whereas N-shaped bending promotes out-of-plane c-domain evolution. Crucially, bending-induced strain gradients generate transverse flexoelectric fields that markedly modulate hysteresis loops. U-shaped bending introduces a negative flexoelectric field, shifting loops rightward and suppressing maximum polarization Pmax. In contrast, N-shaped bending generates a positive field, shifting loops leftward and enhancing Pmax. Furthermore, analysis of polarization switching reveals that bending mediates domain-evolution pathways and reversal dynamics.

- **TL;DR**: 在n型碲烯薄膜中发现了创纪录的-90%巨负磁阻效应，该效应源于量子几何增强的扩散机制和磁电自旋相互作用。

Negative magnetoresistance in conventional two-dimensional electron gases is a well-known phenomenon, but its origin in complex and topological materials, especially those endowed with quantum geometry, remains largely elusive. Here, we report the discovery of a giant negative magnetoresistance, reaching a remarkable $- 90\%$ of the resistance at zero magnetic field, $R_0$, in $n$-type tellurene films. This record-breaking effect persists over a wide magnetic field range (measured up to $35$ T) at cryogenic temperatures and is suppressed when the chemical potential shifts away from the Weyl node in the conduction band, strongly suggesting a quantum geometric origin. We propose two novel mechanisms for this phenomenon: a quantum geometric enhancement of diffusion and a magnetoelectric spin interaction that locks the spin of a Weyl fermion, in cyclotron motion under crossed electric $\boldsymbol{\cal E}$ and magnetic ${\bf B}$ fields, to its guiding-center drift, $(\boldsymbol{\cal E}\times{\bf B})\cdotσ$. We show that the time integral of the velocity auto-correlations promoted by the quantum metric between the spin-split conduction bands enhance diffusion, thereby reducing the resistance. This mechanism is experimentally confirmed by its unique magnetoelectric dependence, $ΔR_{zz}(\boldsymbol{\cal E},{\bf B})/R_0=-β_{g}(\boldsymbol{\cal E}\times{\bf B})^2$, with $β_{g}$ determined by the quantum metric. Our findings establish a new, quantum geometric and non-Markovian memory effect in magnetotransport, paving the way for controlling electronic transport in complex and topological matter.

For designing an efficient terahertz (THz) emitter, the defect density of the semiconductors is smartly increased to reduce carrier lifetime, which subsequently lowers the overall power output of the semiconductor. To overcome this fundamental trade-off, this study presents a novel approach, by integrating a direct band gap 2D semiconductor such as monolayer MoS2 (1L-MoS2) with a well-known THz emitter, low-temperature-grown gallium arsenide (GaAs). The fabricated hybrid 2D/3D vertical van der Waals heterostructure showed a 15% higher THz emission compared to bare GaAs due to phase-coherent addition of second-order non-linear susceptibility, and overall enhancement in the electric field of laser. The photoluminescence (PL) enhancement factor of 2.38 in heterostructures at GaAs emission energy of 1.42 eV. However, the substantial quenching of PL emission for 1L-MoS2 at the energy of 1.84 eV, is attributed to the Dexter-type exciton transfer mechanism at type-I band alignment. THz time-domain spectroscopy reveals a significant increase in optoelectronic properties, such as optical conductivity becoming doubled, and a 50% reduction in absorption coefficients. The study introduces a new route for fabricating large-area and compact mixed-dimensional van der Waals heterostructures, which can be used to enhance the efficiency of conventional semiconductor technologies and THz-based optoelectronic devices.

Linear magnetoresistance is a hallmark of 3D Weyl metals in the quantum limit. Recently, a pronounced linear magnetoresistance has also been observed in 2D graphene [Xin et al., Nature 616, 270 (2023)]. However, a comprehensive theoretical understanding remains elusive. By employing the self-consistent Born approximation, we derive the analytical expressions for the magnetoresistivity of 2D massless Dirac fermions in the quantum limit. Notably, our result recovers the minimum conductivity in the clean limit and reveals a linear dependence of resistivity on the magnetic field for Gaussian impurity potentials, in quantitative agreement with experiments. These findings shed light on the magnetoresistance behavior of 2D Dirac fermions under ultra-high magnetic fields.

Recent topological tools offer a powerful way to classify how phases of nonlinear bosonic resonators are organized. Yet, they remain incomplete. In particular, self-sustained oscillations in the form of limit cycles act as robust organizing centers in phase space that are not captured by existing fixed-point-based approaches. In this work, we extend the flow topology framework for nonlinear resonators to include limit cycles as fundamental topological elements. Using a graph-based construction, we show how periodic attractors impact the global connectivity of phase-space flows. We illustrate the approach with a minimal nonlinear Van der Pol resonator model, where limit cycles coexist with stationary points. Our results provide a unified topological description of stationary and time-periodic phases in nonlinear bosonic systems, with direct relevance to photonic, superconducting, and optomechanical platforms, and raise new questions on synchronization and the extension of flow topology to the quantum regime.

Understanding and predicting thermal transport in disordered materials remains a significant challenge due to the absence of periodicity and the complex nature of medium-range structural motifs. In this work, we investigate amorphous graphene and demonstrate that persistent homology, a topological data analysis technique, can serve as a physically interpretable structural descriptor for predicting thermal conductivity. We first show that ridge regression using persistent homology descriptors achieves high prediction accuracy. To gain physical insight into the prediction process, we perform inverse analysis by mapping the regression coefficients back onto the persistence diagrams. This reveals that distorted hexagonal and triangular motifs are strongly correlated with reduced thermal conductivity. A further comparison with the spatial distribution of localized vibrational modes supports the physical interpretation that these motifs suppress thermal transport. Our findings highlight that persistent homology not only enables accurate prediction of physical properties but also uncovers meaningful structure-property relationships in two-dimensional amorphous materials. This approach offers a promising framework for interpretable machine-learning models in materials science.

Topological materials exhibit unique electronic structures that underpin both fundamental quantum phenomena and next-generation technologies, yet their discovery remains constrained by the high computational cost of first-principles calculations and the slow, resource-intensive nature of experimental synthesis. Recent machine-learning approaches, such as the heuristic topogivity rule, offer data-driven alternatives by quantifying each element's intrinsic tendency toward topological behavior. Here, we develop a quantum-classical hybrid artificial neural network (QANN) that extends this rule into a quantum-inspired formulation. Within this framework, the QANN maps compositional descriptors to quantum probability amplitudes, naturally introducing pairwise inter-element correlations inaccessible to classical heuristics. The physical validity of these correlations is substantiated by constructing an equivalent complex-valued neural network (CVNN), confirming both the consistency and interpretability of the formulation. Retaining the simplicity of chemical reasoning while embedding quantum-native features, our quantum-inspired rule enables efficient and generalizable topological classification. High-throughput screening combined with first-principles (DFT) validation reveals five previously unreported topological compounds, demonstrating the enhanced predictive power and physical insight afforded by quantum-inspired heuristics.

Three distinct samples were proceed through synthesis utilizing the hydrothermal method to develop tin dioxide (SnO2) nanoparticles. Consistency in all other parameters was ensured by maintaining a constant temperature and time throughout the synthesis. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to examine how the surfactant affected the structural, morphological, and crystallographic characteristics. A tetragonal rutile SnO2 phase was confirmed to have formed by XRD investigation, with high crystallinity indicated by strong diffraction peaks. Higher precursor concentration samples showed aggregation, indicating that the smaller size of the nanoparticles caused them to interact. These findings show that changing the surfactant has a major impact on the crystallinity, size, and shape of SnO2 nanoparticles, which makes this technique establish for certain uses, including energy storage, gas sensors, and photocatalysis. Additionally, we examined the photocatalytic activity of the aforementioned samples, indicating from the UV-vis characterization results that the sample containing PEG as a surfactant performs better than others.

### Developing a valence force field model for wurtzite semiconductors by exploiting similarities with [111]-oriented zinc blende systems: The case of wurtzite boron nitride, III-N materials and (B,In,Ga)N alloys

Controlling the crystal phase and lattice mismatch of semiconductors offers a powerful route to engineer electronic and optical properties of heterostructures. As a consequence, semiconductors in the wurtzite phase are increasingly sought after, superseding the thermodynamically favored cubic zinc blende phase. Empirical atomistic modeling, required for large scale simulations of heterostructures and their properties, relies heavily on valence force field (VFF) methods to find the equilibrium atomic positions in an alloy. For zinc blende crystals, VFF models are well-established. In the case of wurtzite, such parameters are frequently adopted without rigorous analysis, despite subtle but consequential differences from the zinc blende structure. Such an approach can compromise accuracy in describing material properties, since the structural differences between zinc blende and wurtzite directly influence electronic and optical characteristics. Based on the analytical VFF model by Tanner et al., and using structural similarities between wurtzite and [111]-oriented zinc blende, we construct a wurtzite VFF without introducing additional parameters. Our framework relies on analytic expressions and minimization routines to project zinc blende models onto wurtzite systems. Beyond elastic tensors, we train the model to reproduce bond length asymmetries and band gaps by using output of the VFF model in density functional theory calculations. Applied to wurtzite III-N compounds and BN, the model accurately reproduces targeted observables but also properties it has not been trained on, including the internal parameter u. We further validate the model on highly mismatched alloys such as (B,Ga)N and (B,In,Ga)N, exhibiting good agreement between VFF and density functional theory results when using identical supercells in these calculations.

Ultra-high temperature ceramics (UHTCs) represent a class of crystalline materials for extreme environments. They can withstand extremely high temperatures but are mechanically difficult to work with due to their inherent brittleness. Mixture compounds, in particular high-entropy mixtures, offer a pathway to tune the physical properties of UHTCs such as their elastic constants. Here we fine-tune the MACE-MPA-0 universal machine-learning potential on rocksalt carbide UHTCs containing group IV-V metals and demonstrate that not only do the elastic constants deviate from the rule of mixtures approximation in the high-entropy limit, but also in the low-entropy limit of binary and ternary mixtures. We find that this is caused by distortion imposed by the lattice mismatch, enabling the tuning of the physical properties of UHTC mixtures in both low- and high-entropy compounds. We identify a three-component mixture compound, HfCVCZrC, as the best balance between synthesizability and toughness, and apply our developed MACE-UHTC model to identify a range of non-equimolar candidate compositions of this compound which may enable the synthesis of a mixture UHTC with a Young's modulus up to 40 GPa below that of ZrC.

Low-dimensional metal halide perovskites provide exciting opportunities to fabricate new semiconductor materials. Semiconductor technology relies on electronic heterojunctions, and cost-efficient and flexible approaches to realize functional heterostructures are of fundamental importance. Lateral heterostructures define the energy landscape in the plane of the semiconducting lattice in such 2D materials, representing an ideal platform to tailor energy barriers and to control charge carrier flow. Here, we demonstrate a versatile one-pot synthesis to fabricate a large variety of 2D perovskite heterostructures based on different halides and/or metal cations. Exploiting sequential crystallization of different 2D perovskites, and playing with the composition and injection events of the materials, enables the design of diverse heterostructure architectures including multiple heterojunctions. We obtain crystalline quality of the heterojunctions, multicolor emission, and optical coupling between the different heterostructure regions. We foresee that the design freedom of our method will stimulate the development of novel optoelectronic devices where electronic band engineering is crucial.

Deviations from diffusive heat transport in high thermal conductivity crystalline insulators are generally understood within the framework of the phonon Boltzmann Transport Equation. However, for low thermal conductivity materials with large primitive cells or strong anharmonicity, the recently developed Wigner Transport Equation is more appropriate as it includes tunnelling between overlapping phonon bands. In this work, via solutions to the Wigner Transport Equation, we develop a scheme to obtain the dynamics of the phonon populations and coherences as a function of an arbitrary heat source. The approach is applied to predict size effects and dynamical thermal conductivities in CsPbBr3 and La2Zr2O7 using first-principles data as input. We predict significant deviations from the bulk thermal conductivity in these materials at length scales on the order of hundreds of nanometers to a few microns at room temperature, well within the reach of direct observation using current experimental techniques.

We present a systematic high-throughput density-functional-theory investigation of the structural and magnetic stability of 312 substitutional compounds in the magnetic kagome AT6X6 family. Our screening confirms the stability of many previously reported structures and predicts several additional stable candidates. Within collinear spin configurations, we find that Fe-based systems predominantly adopt antiferromagnetic ground states, whereas Mn-based analogues exhibit a more balanced distribution between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic order. For compounds exhibiting several nearly degenerate collinear configurations, we analyze the nature of their magnetic ground states, assess the possible emergence of non-collinear order, and discuss the limitations and uncertainties inherent to standard density-functional approaches. Our electronic-structure analysis further reveals that newly predicted ferromagnetic kagome systems display characteristic features of topological metals, with rich magnetic configurations that can be tuned by chemical substitution. Overall, these ferromagnetic kagome compounds constitute a broad and still largely unexplored materials platform for the emergence of exciting magneto-transport phenomena.

The strong Coulomb interaction in 2D materials facilitates the formation of tightly bound excitons and charge-ordered phases of matter. A prominent example is the formation of a crystalline phase from free charges due to mutual Coulomb repulsion, known as the Wigner crystal. While exciton-electron interactions have been used as a sensor for Wigner crystallization, its impact on exciton properties has been poorly understood so far. Here, we show that the weak potential induced by periodically ordered Wigner crystal electrons has a major impact on exciton propagation, albeit having only a minor influence on exciton energy. The effect is tunable with carrier density determining the Wigner crystal confinement and temperature via thermal occupation of higher subbands. Our work provides microscopic insights into the interplay between excitons and charge-ordered states identifying key signatures in exciton transport, and establishes a theoretical framework for understanding exciton propagation in the presence of strong electronic correlations.

- **TL;DR**: 在EuSn₂As₂单晶中，ESR测量发现低于反铁磁转变温度时出现两个共振峰：一个是传统的声学AFM共振模式，另一个是源于层状AFM晶体中约3%平面纳米缺陷的FM共振，表明该材料是天然磁性超材料。

We report results of electron spin resonance (ESR) measurements in single crystals of EuSn$_2$As$_2$. In the temperature range of antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering of Eu atoms, $T \leq T_N\approx 24$\,K, the ESR signal splits into two resonance lines, one of which, at high-field (or low-frequency), is the conventional acoustic AFM resonance mode that occurs at temperatures below $T_N$. The lower-field (high-frequency) line, as we have proven here, is the ferromagnetic resonance associated with the presence in the layered AFM crystal of a small amount ($\sim 3\%$) of planar nanodefects with a non-zero ferromagnetic (FM) moment. The existence of ferromagnetic nano-inclusions in the bulk of the antiferromagnetic compound makes EuSn$_2$As$_2$ a peculiar example of a natural magnetic metamaterial. We believe that the planar FM nanodefects are also inherent in other layered AFM compounds, which explains often observed increase in their magnetic susceptibility upon cooling at $T&lt; T_N\rightarrow 0$.

- **TL;DR**: 开发快速反应气相传输技术，利用有限的同位素纯前驱体（特别是气态18O2），在几分钟内合成毫米级高质量晶体，实现98Mo和18O同位素的高均匀富集。

In this work, we develop a rapid reactive vapor transport technique to efficiently utilize limited isotopically pure precursors, particularly gaseous 18O2, and synthesize mm-scale, high-quality crystals within few-minute growth durations. We unlock this capability by using metallic molybdenum precursors with high source temperatures (900 C) and total pressures (1 atm) to maximize precursor efficiency and yield. Subsequently, we grow MoO3 single crystals with high and uniform enrichment levels of 98Mo and 18O isotopes in several different permutations. As probed by Raman spectroscopy, modest and significant phonon energy redshifts occur following 98Mo and 18O enrichment, respectively. By demonstrating control over both molybdenum and oxygen isotopic fractions, we establish a powerful tool to advance nanophotonics and thermal management goals using MoO3. This work is motivated by the possibility to enhance and engineer lattice vibrational mode phenomena including thermal conduction and hyperbolic phonon polariton (HPhP) dispersion, with particular interest in comparing the effects of light and heavy element enrichment.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究揭示了层状杂化钙钛矿(PEA)2PbI4中量子几何效应对层间自发光电流的起源，通过紧束缚模型识别位移电流为微观机制，这种效应由离子位移和多带跃迁高密度能带增强。

Quantum geometry quantifies how the electron wavefunction evolves distinctly from conventional transport theory. In noncentrosymmetric materials, nonreciprocal transport with quantum geometric origin remains prominent with localized charge independent of vanished group velocity. The discovery of such nonreciprocal and nonlinear responses was realized by recent advances in two-dimensional materials. As a promising candidate, the electronic structure and symmetry of layered hybrid perovskites can be deliberately designed and manipulated by incorporating selected organic ligands. Despite the observation of exotic photogalvanic effects and chiral optical effects, the underlying mechanism how these nonlinear responses are enabled in the multi-quantum well structures remained unclear. Here we demonstrated the quantum geometric origin for interlayer spontaneous photocurrent in (PEA)2PbI4. Contrary to assumptions that charge transport across the 2D planes is limited, we observed a spontaneous photocurrent along this crystalline orientation. Theoretical analysis using a tight-binding model identifies shift current as the microscopic origin. This quantum geometric effect is enabled by ionic displacements from centrosymmetric coordinates and enhanced by multiband transition high-density bands of the layered hybrid crystal. We anticipate that such unique low-dimensional systems with structure can provide fertile ground for discovering novel optoelectronic functionalities.
