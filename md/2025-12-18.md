- **TL;DR**: 该论文展示了一种通过双环SQUID中多个谐波分量干涉实现超过50%效率的超导二极管效应，通过门控可调约瑟夫森结独立控制谐波内容和振幅。

In superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs), the superconducting diode effect may be generated by interference of multiple harmonic components in the current-phase relationships (CPRs) of different branches forming SQUID loops. Through the inclusion of two gate-tunable Josephson junctions in series in each interference branch of a double-loop SQUID, we demonstrate independent control over both the harmonic content and the amplitude of three interfering CPRs, facilitating significant improvement in the maximum diode efficiency. Through optimized gate-controlled tuning of individual Josephson energies, diode efficiency exceeding 50% is demonstrated. Flux-dependent oscillations show quantitative agreement with a simple model of SQUID operation.

We study impacts of spin-orbit interactions on the spin susceptibility in quasicrystal superconductors, motivated by the anomolous superconducting properties in the van der Waals quasicrystal Ta$_{1.6}$Te under magnetic fields. We consider the Penrose tiling model with $s$-wave pairing as a representative system and include anisotropic spin-orbit interactions allowed for the quasicrystal structure. It is shown that the spin-momentum locking locally takes place in the quasicrystal, and electron motion and spin directions are tightly connected at each spatial position in the real space. As a result, the spin susceptibility is enhanced for both in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic fields in the presence of a Rashba-type spin-orbit interaction. For an Ising-type spin-orbit interaction, the spin susceptibility only for in-plane magnetic fields is increased, while the out-of-plane spin susceptibility is almost unchanged. When there are both kinds of the spin-orbit interactions, temperature dependence of the spin susceptibility for any field directions is suppressed.

- **TL;DR**: LaRh₂As₂表现出传统s波超导性，而CeRh₂As₂中的4f电子不仅增强了轨道极限场，还促进了非常规超导多相的形成

Superconductor LaRh$_2$As$_2$ has the same crystal structures as CeRh$_2$As$_2$, which exhibits superconducting (SC) multiphase in the $c$-axis magnetic field. Although the SC transition temperatures $T_c$ are similar, around 0.3 K, LaRh$_2$As$_2$ shows conventional type-II superconductivity with a small upper critical field $H_{c2}\sim$ 10 mT. At present, the SC properties of LaRh$_2$As$_2$ have not been clarified yet. We performed $^{75}$As-nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) measurements on LaRh$_2$As$_2$ to investigate the SC properties and gap structure. $1/T_1$ shows a clear coherence peak just below $T_c$ and an exponential decrease at lower temperatures, suggesting full-gap $s$-wave superconductivity. The numerical calculations based on an $s$-wave SC model reveal an SC gap size of $Δ(0)/k_{B}T_{c} \sim 1.48$, consistent with the weak-coupling $s$-wave superconductivity. These results suggest that the 4$f$ electrons in CeRh$_2$As$_2$ not only enhance the orbital limiting field but also contribute to the formation of unconventional superconductivity with SC multiphase.

The superconducting diode effect (SDE) is a key nonreciprocal phenomenon with broad relevance for superconducting electronics. Using time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau simulations, we predict and quantify a superconducting diode effect arising solely from geometric chirality imposed to a conventional superconductor. The helical geometry and magnetic-field-induced screening currents produce inequivalent critical currents for opposite polarities. The diode efficiency reaches a maximum when one current direction first nucleates vortices, revealing a chirality-controlled crossover between screening- and vortex-dominated nonreciprocity. These results establish mesoscopic geometric chirality as a robust mechanism for supercurrent rectification in an achiral superconductor. They suggest an experimentally accessible route towards 3D superconducting diodes for multi-level integrated quantum circuits.

Multiply charged actinide molecules provide a unique platform to study fundamental physics and the chemical bond under extreme conditions. Beyond the inherently large relativistic effects associated with a high proton number $Z$, an increased molecular charge can further enhance the electronic sensitivity to symmetry-violating nuclear effects, including nuclear Schiff moments. Experimental investigations of multiply charged actinide molecules are challenging because the high charges severely destabilize chemical bonds, leading to spontaneous Coulomb explosion. We demonstrate a method to systematically generate and detect molecular ions at the edge of chemical stability. By applying high-fluence laser ablation to a depleted uranium metal foil, we produce atomic uranium ions U$^{z+}$ and uranium monoxide cations UO$^{z+}$ with $z = 1$--4. Among them, we observe UO$^{3+}$ and UO$^{4+}$, which exhibit comparatively simple electronic structures and are therefore promising for precision spectroscopy. The experiments are supported by relativistic density functional theory calculations of equilibrium bond lengths, charge distributions, and binding energies of all observed molecules. Calculations of symmetry-violating properties suggest a pronounced sensitivity of UO$^{3+}$ to hadronic $CP$ violation. This approach opens a pathway for high-precision investigations of fundamental symmetries and the exploration of relativistic actinide chemistry in previously inaccessible regimes.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文揭示了多带狄拉克系统中Zitterbewegung振荡与自旋相关性质（如光学自旋电导率和内禀自旋霍尔电导率）之间的直接联系，并建立了通过自旋织构分析检测Zitterbewegung振荡的方法。

The Zitterbewegung phenomenon in multiband electronic systems is known to be subtly related to the charge conductivity, Berry curvature and the Chern number. Here we show that some spin-dependent properties as the optical spin conductivity, and intrinsic spin Hall conductivity are also entangled with the Zitterbewegung amplitudes. We also show that in multiband Dirac-type Hamiltonians, a direct link between the Zitterbewegung and the spin textures and spin transition amplitudes can be established. The later allow us to discern the presence or not of the Zitterbewegung oscillations by simply analyzing the spin or pseudo-spin textures. We provide examples of the applicability of our approach for Hamiltonian models that show the suppression of specific Zitterbewegung oscillations.

A simple theoretical model is developed to describe spin reorientation (SR) transitions in rare-earth orthoferrites and orthochromites RFeO3 and RCrO3. Within a ``single-doublet'' approach, the free energy includes anisotropy contributions from the 3d-sublattice and the splitting of the lower doublet of 4f-ions. The model predicts various types of SR transitions - first-order, second-order, and mixed - depending on anisotropy parameters. Effects of non-magnetic dilution, heat capacity anomalies, and behavior of the rare-earth magnetic moment in the SR region are analyzed.

### Design of a specimen to train path-dependent deep learning material models from a single uniaxial test: eliciting strain diversity via automatically differentiable elastoplastic topology optimization

- **TL;DR**: 利用拓扑优化设计特殊试样，通过简单单轴加载产生多样化应力-应变状态，从而用单个试样训练神经网络材料模型，大幅减少实验数据需求。

Artificial neural networks accurately learn nonlinear, path-dependent material behavior. However, training them typically requires large, diverse datasets, often created via synthetic unit cell simulations. This hinders practical adoption because physical experiments on standardized specimens with simple geometries fail to generate sufficiently diverse stress-strain trajectories. Consequently, an unreasonably large number of experiments or complex multi-axial tests would be needed. This work shows that such networks can be trained from a single specimen subjected to simple uniaxial loading, by designing the specimen using a novel automatically differentiable elastoplastic topology optimization method. Our strategy diversifies the stress-strain states observed in a single test involving plastic deformation. We then employ the automatically differentiable model updating (ADiMU) method to train the neural network surrogates. This work demonstrates that topology-optimized specimens under simple loading can train large neural networks, thereby substantially reducing the experimental burden associated with data-driven material modeling.

### On the relation between microstructure and impact toughness of 17-4__PH stainless steel produced by powder bed fusion laser beam (PBF-LB)

- **TL;DR**: 研究PBF-LB制造的17-4 PH不锈钢，发现热处理后虽拉伸强度与传统制造相当或更高，但冲击韧性显著较低，存在明显的强度-韧性权衡。

This work investigated the effects of aging heat treatments on the microstructure and, consequently, the quasi-static (tensile properties) and dynamic (impact toughness) mechanical behaviour of a 17-4 PH stainless steel produced by powder bed fusion laser beam (PBF-LB). Multiscale microstructural characterization, using X-ray diffraction, scanning and transmission electron microscopy and electron backscatter diffraction, was conducted to establish quantitative correlations between microstructural evolution and mechanical performance, providing insight into the mechanisms governing plasticity and fracture. The PBF-LB specimens exhibited tensile strengths comparable to or exceeding those of conventionally manufactured counterparts but consistently showed significantly lower impact toughness, regardless of heat treatment conditions. Within the complex microstructure, strain-induced transformation of reversed austenite was found to enhance ductility and impact toughness. SiO2 inclusions, originating from the starting powder, were identified as nucleation sites for micro-cavities and proved detrimental to impact toughness. Meanwhile, the distribution of Cu-rich nanoprecipitates could be tailored to favour either tensile strength through Orowan strengthening or impact toughness by enhancing local plasticity, but not both simultaneously. This work highlights the pronounced strength-toughness trade-off inherent in PBF-LB-produced 17-4 PH alloys and reveals the interplay between strength, ductility, and toughness. These findings underscore the need for further research into dynamic loading mechanical properties, especially for demanding applications such as those in the nuclear sector.

- **TL;DR**: 研究长程量子O(n)模型在大n极限下的动力学，重点关注强长程区域α&lt;d，发现介观时间尺度t∼ln N上存在由参数共振激活引起的非平凡动力学特征。

We study the the large-$n$ dynamics of the long-range quantum $O(n)$ model, focusing on the strong long-range regime $α&lt;d$. The dynamics of the model exhibits non-trivial features on mesoscopic timescales $t\sim\ln N$, due to the activation of parametric resonances of the nearly degenerate quantum modes. By using recent results establishing the integrability of the large-$n$ limit, we derive the resonance conditions, and construct the reduced multi-mode Hamiltonian that captures the finite-size dynamics. This framework yields the resonance phase diagram and clarifies when and how deviations from mean-field behavior arise. In particular, the presence of multiple resonant modes enhances the logarithmic growth of entanglement and leads to spatially modulated correlations.

### Multiple Quasiparticle Bound States in a Trap Created by a Local Superconducting Gap Variation

At low temperature, the concentration of quasiparticles observed in superconducting circuits far exceeds the predictions of microscopic BCS theory at equilibrium. As a source of dissipation, these excess quasiparticles degrade the performance of various devices. Therefore, understanding their dynamics, especially their recombination into Cooper pairs, is an active topic of current research. In disordered superconductors, spatial fluctuations in the superconducting gap can trap quasiparticles and modify their eigenspectrum. Since this spectrum plays a key role in quasiparticle dynamics, it must be carefully investigated. To this end, we introduce a toy model of a single trap. Specifically, we consider a shallow disk-shaped gap variation in a clean superconductor. Using a semiclassical approximation, we demonstrate the existence of multiple bound states and give the dependence of their number on the size and depth of the gap suppression. Extending our analysis beyond the semiclassical regime, in dimensions larger than one, we observe an infinite number of bound states very close to the gap edge, even for an arbitrarily small trap. These results deepen our understanding of trapped quasiparticles and may have important implications for their recombination in disordered superconductors.

- **TL;DR**: LASSCF方法使用片段活性空间的乘积作为变分空间，但精确求解片段薛定谔方程计算成本高。本文提出LASSQD方法，用量子计算机采样和经典计算机误差缓解近似求解片段方程，显著扩展了可处理的片段尺寸。

Accurately and efficiently describing strongly correlated electronic systems is a central challenge in quantum computational chemistry, with classical and quantum computers. The localized active space self-consistent field method (LASSCF) uses a product of fragment active spaces as a variational space, with the Schrödinger equation solved exactly in each fragment and the fragment active-space orbitals defined in a self-consistent manner. LASSCF is accurate for systems with strong intra-fragment and weak inter-fragment correlation, and its computational cost is combinatorial with respect to the size of the individual fragment active spaces, rather than their product. However, exactly solving the Schrödinger equation in each fragment remains a substantial bottleneck. Here, we address the possibility of solving the fragment active space Schrödinger equation with approximate methods, particularly sample-based quantum diagonalization (SQD). SQD is a technique that uses a quantum computer to sample configurations from a chemically motivated quantum circuit and a classical computer to mitigate errors and solve the Schrödinger equation in a subspace of the configuration space. We apply the proposed method, LASSQD, to the [Fe(H$_2$O)$_4$]$_2$bpym$^{4+}$ compound and the [Fe$^{\mathrm{III}}$Fe$^{\mathrm{III}}$Fe$^{\mathrm{II}}$($μ$$_3$-O)-(HCOO)$_6$] complex for calculating the intermediate-spin ground state energies. We observe that LASSQD can tackle fragment sizes intractable by LASSCF, achieves within 1kcal/mol agreement to LASSCF, and delivers results that are competitive with alternative classical methods to solve the Schrödinger equation, and thus can be used as a starting point for a perturbative treatment (LASSQD-PDFT) to recover correlation external to the active space.

### Fractional quantization by interaction of arbitrary strength in gapless flat bands with divergent quantum geometry

Fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) effect, a lattice analogue of fractional quantum Hall effect, offers a unique pathway toward fault-tolerant quantum computation and deep insights into the interplay of topology and strong correlations. The exploration has been successfully guided by the paradigm of ideal flat Chern bands, which mimic Landau levels in both band topology and local quantum geometry. Yet, given the near-infinite possibilities for Bloch bands in lattices, it remains a major open question whether FQAH states can emerge in scenarios fundamentally different from this paradigm. Here we turn to a class of gapless flat bands, featuring divergent quantum geometry at singular band touching, non-integer Berry flux threading the Brillouin zone (BZ), and ill-defined band topology. Our exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group calculations unambiguously demonstrate FQAH phase that is virtually independent of the interaction strength, persisting from the weak-interaction to the strong-interaction limit. We find the stability of the FQAH states does not uniquely correlate with the singularity strength or the BZ-averaged quantum geometric fluctuations. Instead, the many-body topological order can adapt to the singular and fluctuating quantum geometric landscape by spontaneously developing an inhomogeneous carrier distribution, while its quenching accompanies the drop in the occupation-weighted Berry flux. Our work reveals a profound interplay between quantum geometry and many-body correlation, and significantly expands the design space for exploring FQAH effect and flat-band correlation phenomena in general.

Decisive experimental confirmation of the $U(1)$ quantum spin liquid phase in quantum spin ice remains an outstanding challenge. In this work, we propose stray-field magnetometry as a direct probe of the emergent photons -- the gapless excitation of the emergent electrodynamics in quantum spin ice. The emergent photons are transverse magnetization waves, which, in a finite sample, form discrete modes governed by one of two sets of natural boundary conditions: ``insulating'' or ``superconducting''. Considering cavity and thin film geometries, we find that the spectrum and spatial structure of the stray magnetic noise provide a sharp qualitative signature of the underlying electrodynamics. The predicted stray-field noise power lies comfortably within the detection range of present-day solid-state defect magnetometry.

### UGKS and UGKWP Methods for Multiscale Simulation of Electrostatic Plasma in Quasineutral and Hydrodynamic Limits

This study extends the Unified Gas-Kinetic Scheme (UGKS) and the Unified Gas-Kinetic Wave-Particle (UGKWP) method for electrostatic plasma modeling, ensuring the correct asymptotic limits with respect to both the Debye length and the mean free path. By coupling collision and transport processes within the numerical flux, the proposed approach effectively removes the hydrodynamic-limit constraint associated with the mean free path. In addition, a reformulated Poisson equation, coupled with the macroscopic moment equations, is introduced to overcome the inefficiency of the standard Poisson formulation in the quasineutral regime. The accuracy and asymptotic consistency of the proposed schemes are verified through several benchmark tests, including linear and nonlinear Landau damping and the bump-on-tail instability. The results demonstrate that the methods robustly capture plasma dynamics across hydrodynamic and quasineutral regimes, without resolution constraints imposed by either the Debye length or the mean free path.

### Be and Be-related impurities in diamond: density functional theory study

First-principles density functional simulations were employed to investigate the geometries, electrical properties, and hyperfine structures of various beryllium-doped diamond configurations, including interstitial (Be$_i$), substitutional (Be$_s$), and beryllium-nitrogen (Be-N) complexes. The incorporation of Be into the diamond lattice is more favorable as a substitutional dopant than as an interstitial dopant, although both processes are endothermic. Interstitial Be could potentially exhibit motional averaging from planar to axial symmetry with an activation energy of 0.1 eV. The most stable Be$_s$ configuration has $T_{d}$ symmetry with a spin state of $S=1$. Co-doping with nitrogen reduces the formation energy of Be$_s$-N$_{n}$ $(n=1-4)$ complexes, which further decreases as the number of nitrogen atoms increases. This is attributed to the smaller covalent radius of nitrogen compared to carbon, resulting in reduced lattice distortion. Be$_s$-N$_3$ and Be$_s$-N$_4$ co-doping introduces shallow donors, while Be$_s$ exhibits $n$-type semiconductivity, but the deep donor level renders it impractical for room-temperature applications. These findings provide valuable insights into the behavior of beryllium as a dopant in diamond and highlight the potential of beryllium-nitrogen co-doping for achieving $n$-type diamond semiconductors.

The Kittel--Shore Hamiltonian characterizes $N$ spins with identical long-range interactions, and the $\mathfrak{su}(2)$ coalgebra has been proven to be a symmetry of this model, which can be exactly solved. By using quantum groups and, in particular, $\mathfrak{su}_{q}(2)$, this Hamiltonian was deformed. In this work, we study the thermodynamic properties of this deformed model for spin-$1/2$ particles. In particular, we discuss how this deformation affects the specific heat, magnetic susceptibility, magnetisation, and phase transitions as a function of the parameter $q$ of the deformation and compare them with those of the undeformed model. Deformation was found to shift the thermodynamic behaviours to higher temperatures and alter the phase transitions. The potential applications of this $q$-deformed model for describing few-spin quantum systems with non-identical couplings are discussed.

We report a comprehensive study of pressure-induced evolution of the magnetism and development of superconductivity (SC) in MnBi8Te13, a promising ambient pressure, ferromagnetic (FM) topological insulator candidate. By employing high-pressure electrical transport, magnetoresistance, DC magnetic susceptibility, and X-ray diffraction measurements, we construct a detailed temperature-pressure phase diagram. At ambient pressure, MnBi8Te13 exhibits FM ordering with an easy-axis along the c-axis which is progressively suppressed under pressure and replaced by an antiferromagnetic (AFM) order. Density functional theory calculations predicted an evolution from FM to a G-type AFMg2 phase near 5 GPa. Above 16.6 GPa, a bulk SC state emerges with a maximum transition temperature ~6.8 K, as confirmed by resistance and magnetic susceptibility measurements. This pressure-induced SC may co-exist with another AFM dome that shows a weak anomaly in the transport data. In contrast, our work on MnBi6Te10 shows no SC up to 40 GPa. Indeed, in contrast to MnBi8Te13, the MnBi2Te4(Bi2Te3)n compounds with n &lt; 3, didn't exhibit SC, highlighting the crucial role of Mn concentration in stabilizing SC. The observation of pressure-induced FM-AFM-SC transitions in MnBi8Te13 not only establishes it as a rare Mn-based SC but also provides a platform to study the interplay between magnetism, SC, and potentially nontrivial band topology in correlated magnetic materials.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究通过TDDFT模拟探索了在飞秒激光脉冲高场强下银纳米壳上H₂解离的机制，发现即使在强场效应存在时，等离子体激发仍能在特定条件下主导解离过程，为连接理论模拟与实验条件提供了桥梁。

Modeling plasmonic catalysis by applying femtosecond laser pulses of high intensity ($10^{13}-10^{15}$ W cm$^{-2}$), although justified by the time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) time-scale limitations, can lead to a dissociation mechanism that is completely unrelated to the plasmon excitation created under low-intensity continuous light in experiments (on the order of 1 W cm$^{-2}$). In this study, we examine the dissociation of H$_2$ on a large octahedral Ag nanoshell under varying field intensity, frequency, and duration, and we explore the possibility of identifying optimal modeling conditions accessible with current TDDFT simulations. We show that using this large nanoshell that consists in the outer layer of the Ag$_{231}$ cluster, it is still possible to disentangle the role of the plasmon from strong-field effects at applied field intensities as high as $(2-8) \times 10^{13}$ W cm$^{-2}$. In particular, although strong-field effects are always present at these intensities, we find that the excited plasmon dominates the dissociation process at the lowest applied intensity of $2 \times 10^{13}$ W cm$^{-2}$. Furthermore, at the highest intensity, at which strong-field effects become dominant, the plasmon contributes to accelerating the dissociation of the molecule. Overall, our simulations pave the way to bridge the intensity gap between TDDFT modeling and experiments in plasmonic catalysis.

All-optical switching in a ferromagnetic spin valve is studied here using atomistic spin drift-diffusion dynamics, which includes contributions from spin pumping and superdiffusive transport. The switching is governed by two main sources of current transients: i) spin currents pumped by the reference layer, and ii) spin-polarized currents due to non-equilibrium hot electrons excited by the laser pulse. In particular, an initial superdiffusive forward flow of electrons, polarized by the free layer, is generated. This drives parallel to antiparallel switching of the free layer through accumulation of minority spins at the reference layer. A diffusive backward flow of electrons, repolarized by the reference layer, follows the initial superdiffusive flow as the charge distribution re-equilibrates. Due to the pulse width-dependent asymmetric amplitudes of the forward and backward transients, the latter can drive antiparallel to parallel switching, and create multi-domain structures at higher laser fluences and longer pulses. The results obtained here are in agreement with experimental observations, providing a framework for self-consistent modelling of all-optical switching in metallic heterostructures.

- **TL;DR**: 评估累积展开法结合独立粒子近似在电子-声子系统中计算电荷迁移率的准确性，使用Peierls和Fröhlich模型作为测试基准，与玻尔兹曼形式、Migdal近似等方法比较。

We assess the accuracy of the cumulant expansion (CE) method, combined with the independent-particle approximation (IPA), for calculating charge mobility in electron-phonon systems. As representative testbeds, we consider the Peierls and Fröhlich models, which serve as simplified frameworks where accurate or numerically exact benchmarks are available. These are used to compare the CE results with those obtained using the Boltzmann formalism, the Migdal approximation, and its self consistent extension-approaches that are presently the most commonly employed alternatives for transport calculations. Supported by analytical arguments based on spectral sum rules and by our previous results for the Holstein model, we argue that, for weak to moderate coupling strengths and not-too-low temperatures, the CE within the IPA framework yields accurate results. In the case of the Peierls model, the role of vertex corrections is also discussed.

Point defects introduce localized electronic states that critically affect carrier trapping, recombination, and transport in functional materials. The associated charge transition levels (CTLs) can depend on temperature, requiring accurate treatment of vibrational and electronic free-energy contributions. In this work, we use machine-learned interatomic potentials to efficiently compute temperature-dependent CTLs for vacancies in MgO, LiF, and CsSnBr3. Using thermodynamic integration, we quantify free-energy differences between charge states and calculate the vibrational entropy contributions at finite temperatures. We find that CTLs shift with temperature in MgO, LiF and CsSnBr3 from both entropy and electronic contributions. Notably, in CsSnBr3 a neutral charge state becomes thermodynamically stable above 60 K, introducing a temperature-dependent Fermi-level window absent at 0 K. We show that the widely used static, zero-kelvin defect formalism can miss both quantitative CTL shifts and the qualitative emergence of new stable charge states.

The present study examines the electronic transport characteristics of amorphous semiconductors through TOF measurements and numerical simulations. The primary objective is to determine the DOS in amorphous selenium (a-Se) and to assess the temperature and electric field dependence of the hole mobility. A comprehensive investigation of localized states within the mobility gap is performed using Laplace transform analysis of ToF photocurrent transients, combined with the multiple trapping model. This approach enables accurate reconstruction of the DOS across a wide temperature range, allowing clear identification of shallow and deep trap levels and revealing thermally activated transport mechanisms. Simulated ToF currents are also used to evaluate the hole drift mobility under various thermal and field conditions. Activation energies are extracted from Arrhenius plots of the mobility data. The results support a physically consistent description of the electronic structure in a-Se and validate the applicability of Laplace-based techniques for probing charge transport in disordered semiconductors.

We have simulated an automaton version of the quenched Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (qKPZ) equation in one and two dimensions in order to study the scaling properties of the interface at the depinning transition. Specifically, the $α$, $β$, $θ$, and $δ$ critical exponents characterizing the surface kinetic roughening and depinning behaviors have been directly computed from the simulations. In addition, by studying the height-difference correlation function in real space, we have also been able to directly compute the dynamic correlation length and its associated dynamic critical exponent $z$. The full sets of scaling exponents are largely compatible with those of the Directed Percolation Depinning universality class for one and two dimensional interfaces. Furthermore, we have computed numerically the probability density function (PDF) of the front fluctuations in the growth regime, finding its asymptotic form in one and two dimensions. While the PDF features strongly non-Gaussian skewness and kurtosis values, it also differs from the PDF of the KPZ equation with time-dependent noise for physical substrate dimensions, both in the central part and at the tails of the distribution.

- **TL;DR**: 双层镍酸盐中，通过施加位移场打破层间镜面对称性可以稳定零磁场下的对密度波超导态，类似于FFLO态但无需磁场。

The recent experimental observations of high temperature superconductivity in bilayer nickelate have attracted lots of attentions. Previous studies have assumed a mirror symmetry $\mathcal M$ between the two layers and focused on uniform and clean superconducting states. Here, we show that breaking this mirror symmetry via an applied displacement field can stabilize a pair-density-wave (PDW) superconductor, which is similar to the Fulde--Ferrell--Larkin--Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state, but at zero magnetic field. Based on a mean-field analysis of a model of $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital with an effective inter-layer attraction, we demonstrate that the PDW phase is robust over a wide range of displacement field, interlayer hopping strengths, and electron fillings. Finally, we analyze disorder effects on interlayer superconductivity within the first Born approximation. Based on symmetry considerations, we show that pairing is weaken by disorders which break the mirror symmetry, even with unbroken time reversal symmetry. Our results establish bilayer nickelate as a tunable platform for realizing finite-momentum pairing and for exploring generalized disorder effects.

- **TL;DR**: 使用KA-CRNN框架学习锂离子电池SOC依赖的连续放热反应动力学参数，实现更准确的热失控预测

Thermal runaway in lithium-ion batteries is strongly influenced by the state of charge (SOC). Existing predictive models typically infer scalar kinetic parameters at a full SOC or a few discrete SOC levels, preventing them from capturing the continuous SOC dependence that governs exothermic behavior during abuse conditions. To address this, we apply the Kolmogorov-Arnold Chemical Reaction Neural Network (KA-CRNN) framework to learn continuous and realistic SOC-dependent exothermic cathode-electrolyte interactions. We apply a physics-encoded KA-CRNN to learn SOC-dependent kinetic parameters for cathode-electrolyte decomposition directly from differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) data. A mechanistically informed reaction pathway is embedded into the network architecture, enabling the activation energies, pre-exponential factors, enthalpies, and related parameters to be represented as continuous and fully interpretable functions of the SOC. The framework is demonstrated for NCA, NM, and NMA cathodes, yielding models that reproduce DSC heat-release features across all SOCs and provide interpretable insight into SOC-dependent oxygen-release and phase-transformation mechanisms. This approach establishes a foundation for extending kinetic parameter dependencies to additional environmental and electrochemical variables, supporting more accurate and interpretable thermal-runaway prediction and monitoring.

- **TL;DR**: 提出包含交换相互作用的量子动力学理论，用于二维电子气系统，推导出Hartree-Fock-Wigner方程，建立包含交换修正的流体模型，预测多种经典模型无法解释的物理现象。

We develop a quantum kinetic theory of two-dimensional electron gases in which exchange is treated self-consistently at the Hartree-Fock level and enters as a nonlocal, momentum-dependent field in phase space. By starting from the Coulomb Hamiltonian, we derive a Hartree-Fock-Wigner equation for the electronic Wigner function and obtain a closed fluid model with exchange-corrected pressure, force, and current. For a single layer, we show that exchange renormalizes the Fermi velocity and can drive a long-wavelength plasmonic instability at low densities. In coupled layers, the same framework predicts acoustic-optical mode coupling, and an instability forming long-lived charge-imbalance patterns that are not predicted by classical Vlasov and Boltzmann models. Finally, we apply the kinetic model to the Coulomb drag problem and show how exchange substantially enhances the drag resistivity in dilute GaAs double wells, quantitatively matching experimental observations.

The present theoretical study focuses on the structural, electronic and thermoelectric properties of PbTe, PbSe and their ternary alloys PbSe$_{x}$Te$_{1-x}$, using the density functional theory (DFT) by the full potential linearised augmented plane wave (FP-LAPW) method implemented in Wien2k code. Structural properties were performed by using the generalized gradient approximation of Perdew Burke and Ernzenhof (GGA-PBE) scheme. The results show that the calculated lattice parameters are in good agreement with theoretical data previously obtained. For electronic properties, we noticed that for all the compounds of PbSe$_{x}$Te$_{1-x}$, we have a direct band gap in L point. For thermoelectric properties, we used BoltzTraP2 code and Gibbs2 code. Our results show that the PbSe$_{x}$Te$_{1-x}$ compounds have reached a value of 2.55 for the figure of merit, which indicates that our material is a good thermoelectric candidate.

Out-of-time ordered correlators are a probe of how the information of an initial perturbation is effectively scrambled under unitary time evolution, widely used to study quantum chaos. They have also been used to demonstrate that information is trapped in the zero dimensional edge modes of topological insulators and superconductors, and does not become scrambled. Here we study scrambling in two dimensional topological models. In the bulk the butterfly velocity, the speed at which the out-of-time ordered correlator spreads, gains a directional dependence from the underlying lattice. Furthermore when there are chiral or helical edge modes present these cause a form of dynamical scarring. The information about an initial perturbation on the boundary of the system travels around the edge, carried by the edge modes, but is not scrambled over very long time scales. The direction and speed of the scars are given by the velocities of the linearly dispersing edge modes. We further show that these scars do not interact, passing through each other. We back up these results with analytical and numerical calculations on exemplary models.

- **TL;DR**: 二维金属kagome晶格在应变调控下可实现稳定性，其中Au体系稳定性最佳，Cu最不稳定

Two-dimensional (2D) metallic lattices with kagome topology provide a unique platform for exploring the interplay between geometric frustration, reduced coordination, and lattice stability in elemental systems. Motivated by the recent experimental realization of atomically thin gold layers and kagome goldene, we present a first-principles investigation of free-standing kagome monolayers of Cu, Ag, and Au. Using density functional theory combined with lattice dynamics and ab initio molecular dynamics, we systematically assess their structural, mechanical, dynamical, and thermal stability. All kagome monolayers satisfy the 2D Born criteria and exhibit relatively low in-plane stiffness compared to graphene and hexagonal goldene, reflecting the porous nature of the kagome lattice and its metallic bonding. Among the three systems, the Au-based lattice displays the highest in-plane Young's modulus. Phonon calculations reveal that the unstrained kagome phase is dynamically unstable for all metals. However, a moderate biaxial tensile strain of 5% stabilizes the Ag and Au monolayers, while Cu retains residual unstable modes. Finite-temperature simulations further show that Cu rapidly reconstructs toward a trigonal lattice, Ag remains metastable at low temperature but collapses at room temperature, and Au exhibits competing kagome and trigonal motifs at 300 K, indicating near-degeneracy between these phases. These results establish that strain engineering and atomic size are key determinants of the stability of metallic kagome monolayers and provide guidance for future substrate-supported realizations.

Triangular-lattice cobaltates with glaserite-type $X_2Y$Co($T$O$_4)_2$ structure provide an ideal platform to investigate intriguing quantum magnetism. Here we report a comprehensive study of the structural and magnetic properties of a triangular-lattice cobalt vanadate $\rm Na_2SrCo(VO_4)_2$. Room-temperature x-ray and neutron powder diffraction confirm that $\rm Na_2SrCo(VO_4)_2$ crystallizes in the monoclinic $P2_1/c$ space group with slightly distorted triangular layers of $\rm Co^{2+}$ ions. Magnetization measurements reveal a ferromagnetic transition at $T\rm_C \approx 3.4~{\rm K}$, where a sharp $λ$-type anomaly is observed in the specific heat. The magnetic entropy recovered up to 55 K approaches 90$\%$ of $R{\rm ln}2$, supporting an effective spin-1/2 state of Co$^{2+}$ ions at low temperature. Neutron diffraction at 2.3 K (below $T_{\rm C}$) further confirms a long-range canted ferromagnetic order with the Co$^{2+}$ moments aligned in the $ac$ plane and the ordered moment size of $\sim$ 2.6 $μ\rm_{B}$. Comparing with its sister compounds with a trigonal symmetry, $\rm Na_2BaCo(VO_4)_2$ with a collinear ferromagnetic structure and the recently discovered spin supersolid candidate $\rm Na_2BaCo(PO_4)_2$ with a distinct Y-like antiferromagnetic ground state, this study indicates the decisive role of the $T{\rm O_4}$ tetrahedra in tuning exchange interactions and contrasting magnetic behaviors of these glaserite-structure compounds.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文分析了长期记忆对罕见事件动力学的影响，挑战了传统的阿伦尼乌斯范式，揭示了极端事件之间的强相关性。

Rare events refer to qualitatively unlikely events whose realization can nevertheless have important consequences. Typically, the prediction of the kinetics of these events relies on Arrhenius laws, with exponentially distributed waiting times, and no correlations between successive occurrences. However, this description breaks down in the presence of long-term memory, as has been observed in the contexts of geophysical time series or protein dynamics. So far, existing analytical approaches do not quantify the correlations between rare events due to long-term memory. Here, for non-Markovian Gaussian processes, we determine analytically the impact of long-term memory on the distribution of first and second passage times to a rarely reached threshold. This distribution is non-exponential, thus going beyond the Arrhenius paradigm. We obtain an explicit expression for the covariance between the first and second passage times, and we predict how the mean time to the next extreme event depends on the previous passage time, illustrating the phenomenon of clustering of extreme events. These analytical results, validated through extensive stochastic simulations, shed lights on the strong correlation between successive occurrences of extreme events due to long-term memory.

Designing lithium-ion batteries for long service life remains a challenge, as most cells are optimized for beginning-of-life metrics such as energy density, often overlooking how design and operating conditions shape degradation. This work introduces a degradation-aware design framework built around finite, interacting reservoirs (lithium, porosity, and electrolyte) that are depleted over time by coupled degradation processes.
  We extend a physics-based Doyle-Fuller-Newman model to include validated mechanisms such as SEI growth, lithium plating, cracking, and solvent dry-out, and simulate how small design changes impact lifetime. Across more than 1,000 cycles, we find that increasing electrolyte volume by just 1% or porosity by 5% can extend service life by over 30% without significantly affecting cell energy density. However, lithium excess, while boosting initial capacity, can accelerate failure if not supported by sufficient structural or ionic buffers.
  Importantly, we show that interaction between reservoirs is crucial to optimal design: multi-reservoir tuning yields either synergistic benefits or compound failures, depending on operating conditions. We also quantify how C-rate and operating temperature influence degradation pathways, emphasizing the need for co-optimized design and usage profiles.
  By reframing degradation as a problem of managing finite internal reservoirs, this work offers a predictive and mechanistic foundation for designing lithium-ion batteries that balance energy, durability, and application-specific needs.

We present a comprehensive first-principles investigation of a novel carbon allotrope characterized by quasi-tetragonal atomic motifs and quasi-two-dimensional structural behavior. Structural analysis reveals an open framework composed of alternating diamond-like and square units, while thermodynamic assessments indicate a negative formation energy, suggesting high intrinsic stability. Phonon spectra confirm dynamical robustness, and \textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics simulations at 1000~K validate its thermal resilience. Furthermore, the system exhibits an indirect bandgap of 1.58 eV at the HSE06 level, anisotropic mechanical behavior, and a broadband optical response, reinforcing its potential for nanoelectronic and optoelectronic applications. The highly anisotropic mechanical behavior is characterized by an in-plane Young's modulus ranging from 80 to 550 GPa, depending on crystallographic direction. Additionally, the electronic transport properties exhibit pronounced anisotropy, with hole mobilities reaching up to 5.83 x 10^6 cm^2/V . s and electron mobilities up to 6.40 x 10^6 cm^2/V . s along different crystallographic directions, highlighting the material's potential for directionally selective nanoelectronic device applications.

We investigate the impact of several quasiperiodic disorders and their continuous interpolation with the Aubry-Andre (AA) potential on the Hofstadter butterfly using mean field approximation at zero temperature for a two-dimensional square lattice. Weak disorder mildly smears the fractal spectrum, while strong quasiperiodic potentials destroy the butterfly and generate multiple energy gaps. The AA potential produces the strongest spectral restructuring, creating prominent gaps near half-filling. Interpolating AA with other quasiperiodic potentials reveals competing gap-opening mechanisms, ranging from AA-dominated gaps at small interpolation parameters to a robust half-filling gap generated by the competing disorders at large parameters. Entanglement entropy follows the area law at low and high magnetic fields but shows pronounced deviations at intermediate fields, with opposite trends for strong AA versus other quasiperiodic potentials. Localization analysis using IPR and NPR confirms enhanced localization with increasing disorder; the AA potential yields the largest IPR, with notable field dependence. Interpolation produces smooth crossovers between distinct localization regimes.

We apply the macroscopic fluctuation theory (MFT) to study the large-scale dynamical properties of Brownian particles with arbitrary pairwise interaction. By combining it with standard results of equilibrium statistical mechanics for the collective diffusion coefficient, the MFT gives access to the exact large-scale dynamical properties of the system, both in- and out-of-equilibrium. In particular, we obtain exact results for dynamical correlations between the density and the current of particles. For one-dimensional systems, this allows us to obtain a precise description of these correlations for emblematic models, such as the Calogero and Riesz gases, and for systems with nearest-neighbor interactions such as the Rouse chain of hardcore particles or the recently introduced model of tethered particles. Tracer diffusion with the single-file constraint (but for arbitrary pairwise interaction) is also studied. For higher-dimensional systems, we quantitatively characterize these dynamical correlations by relying on standard methods such as the virial expansion.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文展示了spinDMFT方法在描述静态样品中核自旋扩散和模拟零量子线形方面的应用，通过两个测试物质验证了与实验数据的优异匹配。

The dynamics of disordered nuclear spin ensembles are the subject of nuclear magnetic resonance studies. Due to the through-space long-range dipolar interaction generically many spins are involved in the time evolution, so that exact brute force calculations are impossible. The recently established spin dynamic mean-field theory (spinDMFT) represents an efficient and unbiased alternative to overcome this challenge. The approach only requires the dipolar couplings as input and the only prerequisite for its applicability is that each spin interacts with a large number of other spins. In this article, we show that spinDMFT can be used to describe spectral spin diffusion in static samples and to simulate zero-quantum line shapes which eluded an efficient quantitative simulation so far to the best of our knowledge. We perform benchmarks for two test substances that establish an excellent match with published experimental data. As spinDMFT combines low computational effort with high accuracy, we strongly suggest to use it for large-scale simulations of spin diffusion, which are important in various areas of magnetic resonance.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究通过理论计算和实验验证，在Co5TeO8中发现了窄带隙Mott绝缘体特性，实现了电压可调的亚10纳米磁性纹理，为低功耗自旋电子学提供了新平台。

Narrow-gap Mott insulators promise exceptional opportunities for voltage-controlled magnetic textures in low-dissipation spintronics, although their prediction remains challenging. Here we employ a density functional theory-guided approach to predict a narrow charge-transfer gap (127 meV) in the chiral cubic frustrated oxide Co$_5$TeO$_8$. Comprehensive neutron scattering and magnetometry reveal proper-screw Bloch-type helices with field- and temperature-tunable pitch of 5.7-10 nm embedded in a complex phase diagram with eight distinct phases. Ab initio wavefunction calculations demonstrate site-dependent single-ion anisotropy exceeding Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions by an order of magnitude, establishing the anisotropy-frustration interplay as the stabilization mechanism, contrasting starkly with DM-dominated cubic helimagnets. Sharp capacitance anomalies at phase boundaries confirm intrinsic magnetoelectric coupling throughout the phase diagram. Co$_5$TeO$_8$ thus provides a platform for voltage-tunable sub-10 nm magnetic textures, demonstrating effective theory-guided discovery of functional magnetic materials in correlated oxides.

- **TL;DR**: NN-BAX框架通过联合学习能量面和最小能量路径，将NEB算法的计算成本降低1-2个数量级，使复杂系统的MEP发现从数周缩短到数小时/天

The discovery of a minimum energy pathway (MEP) between metastable states is crucial for scientific tasks including catalyst and biomolecular design. However, the standard nudged elastic band (NEB) algorithm requires hundreds to tens of thousands of compute-intensive simulations, making applications to complex systems prohibitively expensive. We introduce Neural Network Bayesian Algorithm Execution (NN-BAX), a framework that jointly learns the energy landscape and the MEP. NN-BAX sequentially fine-tunes a foundation model by actively selecting samples targeted at improving the MEP. Tested on Lennard-Jones and Embedded Atom Method systems, our approach achieves a one to two order of magnitude reduction in energy and force evaluations with negligible loss in MEP accuracy and demonstrates scalability to &gt;100-dimensional systems. This work is therefore a promising step towards removing the computational barrier for MEP discovery in scientifically relevant systems, suggesting that weeks-long calculations may be achieved in hours or days with minimal loss in accuracy.

We study the subsampling of the avalanches in the fiber bundle model of fracture. In cases where only a part of the system is observed for the micro-failure events, the recorded avalanche statistics gets distorted compared to the actual fracture events. We show that, particularly in the cases where the load redistribution is localized, this distortion is significant. Surprisingly, however, near an elastic failure regime, the distortion is minimized, suggesting a much reduced observational capacity could still represent the actual failure dynamics in the case of fracture of elastic solids.

Cavity quantum electrodynamics offers a powerful route to manipulate material properties. However, it is unclear whether and how quantized fields affect crystals periodicity. Here, we extend Bloch's theorem to crystals under the strong light-matter coupling, showing that polariton quasiparticles preserve lattice periodicity. We formulate a general framework to incorporate the effect of multimode cavity fields in a simple and tractable way. We find that the additional modes contribute to the system's energy by small modifications that become noticeable only at low frequencies. Within the single-photon approximation the multimode contribution manifests as a spatially uniform effective field in the crystal's plane. This provides a formal justification for the single-mode and long-wavelength approximations commonly used in molecular polaritonics. This work establishes a rigorous theoretical framework that clarifies how polaritonic states in crystalline solids should be described.

- **TL;DR**: 论文提出将任意子之间的纠缠视为一种涌现的AdS几何，并以石墨烯纳米带中的分数化任意子为例，展示了量子纠缠如何产生涌现几何。

Intrinsically topologically ordered phases can host anyons. Here, we take the view that entanglement between anyons can give rise to an emergent geometry resembling Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space. We analyze the entanglement structure of fractionalized anyons using mutual information and interpret the results within this emergent geometric framework. As a concrete example, we consider pairs of $e/2$-charged semions that arise from instanton configurations in a disordered zigzag graphene nanoribbon. These fractional charges, located on opposite zigzag edges, show long-range quantum entanglement despite being spatially separated. We analyze the scale dependence of their entanglement and embed the ribbon into an AdS-like bulk geometry. In this setup, the entanglement structure defines minimal surfaces in the bulk, providing a geometric view of the edge correlations. This gives a holographic picture of fractionalized degrees of freedom in quasi-one-dimensional systems and shows how quantum entanglement can generate emergent geometry even without conformal symmetry.

Radiation-induced segregation (RIS) and chemical redistribution in structural alloys can significantly degrade material performance, ultimately leading to failure. In this study, building on previous work by the authors [1], we investigate how the dimensional characteristics of sinks influence solute concentration distributions and segregation behavior. Specifically, we utilize a kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) model to simulate atomic-scale diffusion and analyze segregation processes in an Fe-3Cr alloy. Our analysis includes three representative sink geometries: one-dimensional (1D), two-dimensional (2D), and three-dimensional (3D) planar sinks to capture the effects of sink dimensionality on Cr segregation at grain boundaries (GBs). We also found solutions of concentration and segregation profiles in these cases as well as for a 3D spherical sink. KMC simulations are performed over a range of temperatures to assess thermal effects on Cr redistribution. The results reveal distinct segregation profiles and concentration gradients, although the dependence with sink density seems to remain linear in all cases with planar sinks. The analytical results show that this is not the case in spherical domains, with a more complex dependence of segregation on sink density. Our finite difference solutions for domains including 2D and 3D planer sinks show agreement with corresponding KMC results.

- **TL;DR**: 拓扑量子临界点处的非平衡驱动动力学表现出异常普适标度行为，边界动力学与传统Kibble-Zurek机制不同，揭示了拓扑与动力学相互作用的新现象。

We study the nonequilibrium driven dynamics at topologically nontrivial quantum critical points (QCPs),and find that topological edge modes at criticality give rise to anomalous universal dynamical scaling behavior. By analyzing the driven dynamics of bulk and boundary order parameters at topologically distinct Ising QCPs, we demonstrate that, while the bulk dynamics remain indistinguishable and follow standard Kibble Zurek (KZ) scaling, the anomalous boundary dynamics is unique to topological criticality, and its explanation goes beyond the traditional KZ mechanism. To elucidate the unified origin of this anomaly, we further study the dynamics of defect production at topologically distinct QCPs in free-fermion models and demonstrate similar anomalous universal scaling exclusive to topological criticality. These findings establish the existence of anomalous dynamical scaling arising from the interplay between topology and driven dynamics, challenging standard paradigms of quantum critical dynamics.

### Functional renormalization group for extremely correlated electrons

- **TL;DR**: 在强关联极限下，Hubbard模型表现出极端关联电子行为，带宽和准粒子权重随电子密度增加而显著减小，形成坏金属和磁有序相。

At strong on-site repulsion $ U $, the fermionic Hubbard model realizes an extremely correlated electron system. In this regime, it is natural to derive the low-energy physics with the help of non-canonical operators acting on a projected Hilbert space without double occupancies. Using a strong-coupling functional renormalization group technique, we study the physics of such extreme correlations in the strict $ U = \infty $ limit, where only kinematic interactions due to the Hilbert space projection remain. For nearest-neighbor hopping on a square lattice, we find that the electronic spectrum is significantly renormalized, with bandwidth and quasi-particle residue strongly decreasing with increasing electron density. On the other hand, damping and particle-hole asymmetry increase, while a polaronic continuum forms in the hole sector, below the single-particle band. Fermi liquid phenomenology applies only at low densities, where the system remains paramagnetic. At higher densities, we find a bad metal with strong magnetic correlations, indicating that the ground state is the Nagaoka ferromagnet at high densities and a stripe antiferromagnet at intermediate densities. Both in the paramagnetic and the ferromagnetic regimes, we observe a violation of Luttinger's theorem.

- **TL;DR**: 通过δ掺杂结构选择性增强GaN:Eu中主要Eu位点的发光，实现高效能量转移和窄谱发射

Europium-doped gallium nitride (GaN:Eu) is a promising platform for classical and quantum optoelectronic applications. When grown using organometallic vapor-phase epitaxy, the dominant red emission from Eu exhibits an inhomogeneous photoluminescence (PL) spectrum due to contributions from several non-equivalent incorporation sites that can be distinguished with combined excitation emission spectroscopy. Energy transfer from the GaN bandgap to the majority site is inefficient, limiting the performance of GaN:Eu LEDs and resulting in an inhomogeneous emission spectrum dominated by disproportionate contributions from minority sites. In this work, we use site-selective spectroscopy to characterize the photoluminescence properties of delta-doped structures with alternating doped and undoped layers of varying thicknesses and demonstrate that they selectively enhance emission from the majority site when compared to uniformly-doped samples. Samples with 2-nm and 10-nm doped layers show much greater PL intensity per Eu concentration as well as more efficient energy transfer to the majority site, which are both highly desirable for creating power-efficient LEDs. Meanwhile, a sample with 1-nm doped layers shows emission only from the majority site, resulting in a narrow, homogeneous emission spectrum that is desirable for quantum technologies. This utilization of delta-doping has the potential to be broadly applicable for engineering desirable defect properties in rare-earth doped semiconductors.

X-ray detected ferromagnetic resonance (XFMR) spectroscopy is an experimental technique for element-specific spin dynamics in the GHz regime and has been utilized to study spintronic materials. The XFMR signal is usually obtained by detecting X-ray excited optical luminescence (XEOL) emitted from a sample substrate. Here, we report the development of an XFMR spectrometer that is designed to place a photodetector for XEOL detection outside an ultra-high-vacuum chamber. This configuration allows for the easy replacement of detectors, such as photodiodes, CCD cameras, and spectrometers, depending on the experimental requirements. We demonstrated the measurement of XEOL spectra from MgO using a visible light spectrometer as well as the detection of XFMR signals originating from the spin precession of a permalloy (Ni80Fe20) thin film using a photodiode detector. The XFMR spectrometer with an out-of-vacuum photodetector expands possibilities for advanced measurements such as XFMR microscopy.

Magnetic octupole (MO) currents have recently attracted significant attention as a driving force for the Neel vector dynamics in d-wave altermagnets, a new class of antiferromagnets that exhibit nonrelativistic spin-split band structures. From a symmetry perspective, the MO includes an axial-dipole component analogous to that of the spin, making it essential to clarify how MO currents differ from spin currents. We here investigate the correspondence between MO conductivities and electronic multipoles, which provide a unified and powerful framework for symmetry analysis. We derive the multipole representation of the rank-five MO conductivity tensor and classify its symmetry-allowed components for all crystallographic point groups, in direct comparison with spin conductivity. We show that time-reversal-even electric-type multipoles give rise to the dissipationless MO current, whereas time-reversal-odd magnetic-type multipoles generate dissipative MO current under an applied electric field. Complementing this macroscopic analysis, the linear-response calculations for a microscopic tight-binding model demonstrate how MO conductivities are activated by symmetry lowering, exemplified by the symmetry reduction from Oh to Th. Our results elucidate the symmetry distinctions between MO currents and spin currents, and provide insights into their experimental identification.

Tungsten is a leading candidate material for plasma-facing components in future fusion reactors. Extensive studies have been performed to better understand its behavior under irradiation. Recent experiments of Rutherford backscattering spectrometry in channeling mode indicated a marked reduction in radiation damage in single-crystal tungsten samples irradiated by self-ions when the irradiation temperature was increased from room temperature to 800 K. However, the underlying mechanism for this damage reduction remains unclear. In this work, by combining Rutherford backscattering spectrometry in channeling mode and molecular dynamics simulations, we identify a pronounced surface effect at elevated temperatures, characterized by a significant reduction of dislocation density near the surface. We demonstrate how our unique analysis method can clearly resolve a dislocation-free zone and a transition region with suppressed defect density before reaching the bulk value. The strong surface effect at elevated temperatures is explained by considering the coherent drift motion of dislocation loops towards the surface, highlighting alternative perspectives on mitigating radiation damage by increasing dislocation mobility.

Spin-charge stripes belong to the most prominent low-temperature orders besides superconductivity in high-temperature superconductors. This phase is particularly challenging to study numerically due to finite-size effects. By investigating the formation of long, isolated stripes, we offer a perspective complementary to typical finite-doping phase diagrams. We use the density-matrix renormalization group algorithm to extract the ground states of an 18-leg cylindrical strip geometry, making the diameter significantly wider than in previous works. This approach allows us to map out the range of possible stripe filling fractions on the electron versus hole-doped side. We find good agreement with established results, suggesting that the spread of filling fractions observed in the literature is governed by the physics of a single stripe. Taking a microscopic look at stripe formation, we reveal two separate regimes - a high-filling regime captured by a simplified squeezed-space model and a low-filling regime characterized by the structure of individual pairs of dopants. Thereby, we trace back the phenomenology of the striped phase to its microscopic constituents and highlight the different challenges for observing the two regimes in quantum simulation experiments.

Aqueous zinc (Zn) batteries provide many benefits, including high theoretical capacity, a low redox potential, and the abundance of Zn in Earth's crust. However, the benefits are often compromised by severe side reactions and dendrite growth, limiting their practical application. To mitigate these drawbacks, many studies have focused on high-concentration electrolytes to desolvate the Zn2+ solvation shell from water and to reduce the amount of free water. In this study, a methodology is proposed to achieve the benefits of highly concentrated electrolytes while using low salt concentrations. 5-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (5MP) was introduced as a safe and polar cosolvent capable of anchoring free water molecules through hydrogen bonding, enabled by its carbonyl and secondary amine groups. Additionally, by adding a co-salt containing a chaotropic ion, it is possible to disrupt the water network, enabling the development of high-performance aqueous Zn batteries. The synergy between anchoring water molecules and disrupting the overall water network proved to be an effective strategy for enhancing the overall Zn battery performance in a symmetric Zn cell, with lifetimes exceeding 2000 hours and 1400 hours at 1 C and 5 C, respectively. Analysis of the recovered Zn anode confirmed that the combination of 5MP and chaotropic ions enabled Zn deposition along the energetically favorable (002) plane, with no signs of surface dehydration observed by in situ Raman spectroscopy. Furthermore, long-term stability tests using a carbonyl-rich COF- and NaVO-based cathodes at various current densities further demonstrated the benefits of this approach. This work showcases the universality of a diluted electrolyte in combination with 5MP and chaotropic ions, bridging the gap between laboratory research and real-world applications.

Quad-helicoid surface states (QHSSs) are unique surface states with two pairs of helicoid surface states in topological semimetals such as Dirac semimetals. So far, topologically protected QHSSs are shown to appear in spinless systems with two $\mathcal{GT}$ symmetries and $\mathcal{T}$ symmetry ($\mathcal{G}$: glide, $\mathcal{T}$: time-reversal). In this paper, we show that topologically protected QHSSs also appear in spinful/spinless systems with only two $\mathcal{GT}$ symmetries by defining new topological charges and establishing the bulk-surface correspondence. We first define a local $Z_2\times Z_2$ monopole charge for gapless nodes at $\mathcal{GT}$-invariant high-symmetry points and a global $Z_2$ charge reflecting the global topological feature of $\mathcal{GT}$-symmetric topological semimetals. Next, we show that the latter $Z_2$ classification corresponds to the presence or absence of QHSSs on the surface with two $\mathcal{GT}$ symmetries. In addition, we provide simplified formulas of the $Z_2$ charge under additional symmetries, and clarify some symmetry conditions where QHSSs are filling-enforced.

We report the design and implementation of a high-flux, high-efficiency magneto-infrared spectroscopy system optimized for broadband measurements in high magnetic fields. The setup integrates a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer, a 12 T cryogen-free superconducting magnet, precision-polished and gold-plated light tubes, custom-designed reflective focusing modules for Faraday and Voigt geometries, and an external multi-detector chamber with motorized selection. Optical throughput is maximized by reducing light tube loss from 65.5%/m to 22.0%/m via abrasive flow and mechanical polishing followed by gold electroplating, and by adopting a single-on-axis parabolic-mirror Faraday module that increases the effective numerical aperture from 0.14 to 0.36, enhancing collection efficiency by nearly an order of magnitude. An eight-position motorized sample stage and fully automated control over magnetic field, temperature, optical path, and detector choice enable high-throughput measurements without repeated warm-ups. The optimized configuration achieves a root-mean-square noise level of 0.0061% in a 2-minute integration for a 40% reflectivity sample, corresponding to a signal-to-noise ratio exceeding 16000. System capabilities are demonstrated by resolving weak replica bands in EuCd2As2 and faint Landau level transitions in LaAlSi.

We investigate the evolution of electronic transport across the topological-trivial phase transition in ${\rm In}_{x}({\rm Bi}_{0.3}{\rm Sb}_{0.7})_{2-x}{\rm Te}_3$ thin films by systematically tuning the indium concentration $x$. Increasing $x$ reduces the effective spin-orbit coupling, driving a topological quantum phase transition near $x \approx 7\%$, and at higher disorder a crossover from diffusive to strongly localized transport around $x \approx 15\%$. In the diffusive regime, the magnetoconductance is well described by the Hikami-Larkin-Nagaoka formalism, with the evolution of the WAL prefactor $α$ correlating with the band-inversion transition. Beyond the diffusive limit, transport crosses into variable-range hopping, accompanied by a striking reversal of magnetoconductance from negative to positive. The observed positive low-field magnetoconductance, its pronounced anisotropy, and its temperature evolution point to an orbital origin of the response. These features are naturally captured by incorporating the incoherent hopping mechanism of Raikh \textit{et al.} together with wavefunction shrinkage, rather than by conventional quantum-correction frameworks. Our results provide a unified picture of how topology, spin-orbit coupling, and disorder collectively determine the full field-temperature magnetotransport landscape in this material class, establishing a clear experimental link between the topological phase transition and the onset of incoherent hopping-dominated conduction.

- **TL;DR**: 使用优化红外反射吸收光谱研究Rh/Fe3O4(001)单原子催化剂上CO吸附，识别三种羰基物种，揭示UHV与高压条件下形成机制差异，建立光谱指纹用于识别Rh配位环境。

Infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRAS) offers a powerful route to bridging the materials and pressure gaps between surface science and powder catalysis. Using a newly developed IRAS setup optimised for dielectric single crystals, we investigate CO adsorption on the model single-atom catalyst Rh/Fe3O4(001). IRAS resolves three species: monocarbonyls at twofold coordinated Rh1 sites, monocarbonyls at fivefold coordinated Rh sites, and gem-dicarbonyls at twofold coordinated Rh1 sites. Under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions, Rh1CO monocarbonyl species dominate. Rh1(CO)2 gem-dicarbonyl formation is kinetically hindered and occurs predominantly through CO-induced dissociation of Rh2 dimers rather than sequential CO adsorption. The sequential-adsorption pathway to Rh1(CO)2 becomes accessible at millibar CO pressures as evidenced by near-ambient-pressure scanning tunnelling microscopy (NAP-STM). These findings validate the kinetic picture inferred from UHV measurements and computational modelling and link the UHV behaviour to that expected under realistic reaction conditions. Assignments of the vibrational frequencies to individual species rely on isotopic labelling, thermal treatments, and a review of previous SPM, XPS, and TPD data, supported by density functional theory (DFT)-based calculations. While theory provides qualitative insight, such as the instability of dicarbonyls on fivefold coordinated Rh atoms, it does not yet reproduce experimental frequencies quantitatively and is sensitive to the computational parameters, highlighting the need for robust experimental benchmarks. The spectroscopic fingerprints established here provide a reliable foundation for identifying Rh coordination environments in oxide-supported single-atom catalysts.

- **TL;DR**: 单晶尖晶石CoFe₂O₄具有最大的室温饱和磁致伸缩效应，其机制源于结构畴切换而非全局自旋重定向

Single crystal spinel CoFe$_2$O$_4$ exhibits the largest room-temperature saturation magnetostriction among non-rare-earth compounds and a high Curie temperature ($T_c \sim 780$ K), properties that are critical to a wide range of industrial and medical applications. Neutron spectroscopy reveals a large band splitting ($\sim$ 60 meV) between two ferrimagnetic magnon branches, which is driven by site mixing between Co$^{2+}$ and Fe$^{3+}$ cations, and a significantly weaker magnetocrystalline anisotropy ($\sim$ 3 meV). Central to this behavior is the competition between extremely large mismatched molecular fields on the tetrahedral $A$-site and octahedral $B$-site sublattices and the single-ion anisotropy on the $B$-site. This creates a strong energetic anisotropy that locks the magnetic moment within each structural domain in place. As a result of these differing energy scales, switching structural domains is energetically favored over a global spin reorientation under applied magnetic fields, and this is what amplifies the magnetostrictive nature of CoFe$_2$O$_4$.

- **TL;DR**: 系统研究CsPbI3中3d过渡金属取代缺陷，发现大多数TM掺杂不会产生深能级陷阱，而是引入与带边杂化的共振态，保持了材料的缺陷容忍特性。

We present a systematic first-principles study of substitutional 3d transition-metal (TM) defects in CsPbI3 using the spin-polarized GGA+U framework. TM incorporation is generally energetically favorable and induces lattice distortions that are strongly localized around the defect site, preserving the overall structural integrity of the host. Analysis of defect formation energies and electronic structure shows that, with the exception of Sc and Ti, CsPbI3 exhibits a strong resistance to deep trap formation. Most TM substitutions instead introduce resonant states that hybridize with the band edges, consistent with the defect-tolerant nature of the material. While these states can modify the band gap, they do not generate isolated mid-gap traps. The observed distortions arise from strain-driven Van Vleck modes governed by ionic-radius mismatch, electronegativity differences, and TM-I orbital overlap, with amplitudes that decay rapidly away from the defect. Spin-polarized calculations reveal significant TM-induced spin polarization on the ligands and, in some cases, on neighboring Pb atoms, reflecting variations in covalency and hybridization across the 3d series. Together, these results establish a unified picture in which local structural response, electronic hybridization, and spin polarization jointly control the stability and electronic impact of TM defects in CsPbI3 , identifying dopants that are electronically benign or detrimental.

- **TL;DR**: 开发机器学习模型预测DFT计算中的k点采样，生成Quantum Espresso输入文件，确保85-95%化合物的预测k点距离在收敛区域内

Performing density functional theory (DFT) calculations requires a careful choice of computational parameters to ensure convergence and obtain meaningful results. This represents a particularly important problem for high-throughput and agentic workflows, where due to computational cost, any additional convergence studies are preferably to be avoided. So, there is a need for tools and models which are able to predict DFT parameters from basic input information, such as a structure. In this work, we develop a machine learning approach to predict the appropriate k-point sampling in DFT calculations and generate the input files for Quantum Espresso self-consistent field calculations. To achieve this, we first generated a training dataset comprising over 20,000 materials, each with an energy convergence threshold of 1 meV/atom. Several ML models were evaluated for their ability to predict k-points distance, and uncertainty estimation was incorporated to guarantee that, for at least 85-95% of compounds, the predicted k-distance lies within the convergence region. The best-performing models are made publicly available through an open-access web application.

Valleytronics aims to control electrons in a valley-specific manner for quantum information manipulation. Due to their strong in-plane anisotropy, which enables polarization-controlled optical transitions to distinct nondegenerate valleys, group-IV monochalcogenides have been recently proposed as promising candidates for next-generation valleytronic materials. However, ultrafast nonequilibrium dynamics following optical preparation of valley-polarized states remain completely unexplored in these systems. Combining time- and angle-resolved extreme-ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy with time-dependent Boltzmann equation simulations, we investigate ultrafast valley polarization dynamics following polarization-controlled photoexcitation in SnSe. We show that selective excitation to valleys at global conduction minima yields nearly unity and time-independent valley polarization. In contrast, photoexcitation to the other valley channel leads to ultrafast decay and reversal of valley polarization on sub-picosecond timescales due to intervalley scattering mediated by strong electron-phonon coupling with an optical phonon mode. Our findings reveal strongly anisotropic and radically different nonequilibrium valley physics than in most common two-dimensional valleytronics materials.

We analyze the electromechanical response of the 180 degree ferroelectric domain wall in tetragonal PbTiO3 by combining first-principles calculations with a Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire (LGD) description. Using regular multidomain structures with varying domain-wall density, we extract polarization profiles and lattice distortions and map them onto the continuum model to determine conventional (homogeneous) and gradient (inhomogeneous) electrostriction. Conventional electrostriction yields only a small negative length change of the sample, whereas gradient electrostriction--arising from the coupling between strain and polarization gradients--produces a positive contribution nearly an order of magnitude larger and localized at the wall core. Our results demonstrate that gradient electrostriction dominates the electromechanical response of 180 degree walls in PbTiO3, supporting its inclusion in LGD models that stabilize Bloch-type domain wall structures.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究通过数据驱动方法揭示了NiCoCrAl高熵合金的氧化行为温度依赖性，发现了氧化保护机制从氧化铝主导到氧化铬主导的转变，挑战了高铝含量普遍必要的假设。

The development of oxidation-resistant high-entropy alloy (HEA) bond coats is restricted by the limited understanding of how multi-principal element interactions govern scale formation across temperatures. This study uncovers new oxidation trends in NiCoCrAl HEAs using a data-driven analysis of high-fidelity experimental oxidation data. The results reveal a clear temperature-dependent transition between alumina- and chromia-dominated protection, identifying the compositional regimes where alloys rich in Al dominate at $\ge1150$ °C, mixed Al-Cr chemistries are optimal at intermediate temperatures, and, unexpectedly, Cr-rich low-Al alloys perform best at 850 °C-challenging the assumption that high Al is universally required. The effects of Hf and Y are shown to be strongly composition-dependent with Hf producing the largest global reduction in oxidation rate, while Y becomes effective primarily in NiCo-lean alloys. Y-Hf co-doping offers consistent improvement but exhibits site-saturation behavior. These insights identify new high-performing HEA bond-coat families, including $\mathrm{Ni_{17}Co_{23}Cr_{30}Al_{30}}$ as a substitute for conventional mutlilayer thermal barrier coatings.

- **TL;DR**: 利用石墨烯或hBN作为范德华覆盖层，创建纳米受限环境引导二维TMDs生长，实现精确控制形貌和超清洁界面的合成方法

Two-dimensional (2D) materials, such as graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), and hBN, exhibit intriguing properties that are sensitive to their atomic-scale structures and can be further enriched through van der Waals (vdW) integration. However, the precise synthesis and clean integration of 2D materials remain challenging. Here, using graphene or hBN as a vdW capping layer, we create a nano-confined environment that directs the growth kinetics of 2D TMDs (e.g., NbSe2 and MoS2), enabling precise formation of TMD monolayers with tailored morphologies, from isolated monolayer domains to large-scale continuous films and intrinsically-patterned rings. Moreover, Janus S-Mo-Se monolayers are synthesized with atomic precision via vdW-protected bottom-plane chalcogen substitution. Importantly, our approach simultaneously produces ultraclean vdW interfaces. This in situ encapsulation reliably preserves air-sensitive materials, as evidenced by the enhanced superconductivity of nano-confined NbSe2 monolayers. Altogether, our study establishes a versatile platform for the controlled synthesis and integration of 2D TMDs for advanced applications.

Recent reports of strong room-temperature photoluminescence in hexagonal diamond (2H) germanium stand in marked contrast to theoretical predictions of very weak band-edge optical transitions. Here we address radiative emission in 2H-Ge and related materials through a comprehensive investigation of their excitonic properties and radiative lifetimes, performing Bethe-Salpeter calculations on pristine and uniaxially strained 2H-Ge, 2H-Si$_x$Ge$_{1-x}$ alloys with $x=\frac{1}{6},\,\frac{1}{4},\,\frac{1}{2}$, and wurtzite GaN as a reference. Pristine 2H-Ge features sizable exciton binding energies ($\sim\!30$ meV) but extremely small dipole moments, yielding radiative lifetimes above $10^{-4}$ s. Alloying with Si reduces the lifetime by nearly two orders of magnitude, whereas a 2% uniaxial strain along the $c$ axis induces a band crossover that strongly enhances the in-plane dipole moment of the lowest-energy exciton and drives the lifetime down to the nanosecond scale. Although strained 2H-Ge approaches the radiative efficiency of GaN, its much lower exciton energy prevents a full match. These results provide the missing excitonic description of 2H-Ge and 2H-Si$_x$Ge$_{1-x}$, demonstrating that, even when excitonic effects are fully accounted for, the strong photoluminescence reported experimentally cannot originate from the ideal crystal.

We fabricate (In,Ga)N pseudo-substrates with a total thickness of ~1 um grown on GaN templates using plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy. In a three-step process, we change growth conditions from N-rich to metal-rich in order to sequentially form a roughened GaN layer, relaxed (In,Ga)N nanostructures, and a coalesced, smooth (In,Ga)N layer. Samples are analyzed by scanning electron and atomic force microscopy, X-ray diffraction, as well as photo- and cathodoluminescence spectroscopy. Compared to a reference layer grown directly on GaN, the pseudo-substrate exhibits a higher In content (~0.3), strain relaxation degree (~80%), narrower photoluminescence linewidth, and larger area fraction of bright regions in cathodoluminescence maps, showing the benefits of the three-step growth protocol. This straightforward approach does not necessitate any ex-situ processing and could enable the scalable fabrication of (In,Ga)N pseudo-substrates for high-efficiency red-emitting (In,Ga)N devices.

R2In (R = rare earth) intermetallics exhibit unusual magnetic and magnetocaloric properties, driven by subtle electronic effects, lattice distortions, and spin-lattice coupling. Most of these binary compounds adopt the hexagonal Ni2In-type structure at room temperature, with Eu2In and Yb2In stabilizing in the orthorhombic Co2Si-type lattice. Lighter lanthanide compounds Eu2In, Nd2In, and Pr2In undergo first-order magnetic transitions with negligible hysteresis and minimal lattice volume change and exhibit giant cryogenic magnetocaloric effects, while heavy lanthanide R2In compounds including Gd2In show second-order transitions with moderate magnetocaloric effect. No lanthanide-based R2In compound exhibits symmetry-breaking structural transition, while Y2In transforms from hexagonal to orthorhombic structure near 250 K. Secondary low-temperature transitions, including spin reorientation or antiferromagnetic ordering, further enrich the magnetic phase landscape in these compounds. Integrating theoretical descriptors such as charge-induced strain and electronic structure provides predictive insight into phase stability and magnetocaloric performance, guiding the design of rare-earth intermetallics with tunable magnetic properties for cryogenic applications

- **TL;DR**: 通过气体淬火技术控制溶剂干燥速率，可优化有机太阳能电池活性层纳米形貌，提升电荷生成和开路电压，从而提高器件性能。

Making solution-cast organic solar cells industrially available generally comes at the cost of significant performance losses compared to device prototypes manufactured under laboratory conditions. Adjusting solvent evaporation kinetics is postulated to recover efficiency. Yet, a comprehensive characterization of their effect, independently of other property-defining parameters, is lacking. Thus, the present objective is to isolate the influence of the solvent drying rate on solution-deposited organic active layer nanomorphologies and performances. To this end, a specially designed gas quenching technique is employed to fabricate PM6:Y6 donor-acceptor films under systematic variations of evaporation conditions. Using an extensive investigation protocol that combines insights from numerical simulations and experimental measurements, process-structure-performance relationships are unraveled. It is found that higher drying rates imply finer and more dispersed nanomorphologies with increased fractions of amorphous material. This enhances electric charge generation, thereby improving short-circuit current density and overall cell performance. The open-circuit voltage is also boosted under accelerated evaporation due to changes in the aggregation mode of the Y6 small molecule that induce higher effective bandgaps. The results demonstrate that the developed gas-quenching technique is a valuable tool for optimizing the performance of upscaled organic photovoltaics, as it is readily compatible with high-throughput equipment, such as roll-to-roll coating machines.
