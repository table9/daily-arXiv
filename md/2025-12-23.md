- **TL;DR**: 该论文开发了一个理论框架，将拓扑绝缘体表面输运和自旋电子界面物理整合到MRI射频线圈电动力学中，旨在降低射频耗散、修改噪声机制，并实现无需传统铁氧体的线圈级非互易性。

MRI radiofrequency (RF) coils are ultimately limited by conductor loss, thermal noise, and reciprocity constraints associated with conventional metallic boundary conditions. These limitations become more severe at higher static fields, where operating frequencies increase and current distributions are governed by surface impedance and electromagnetic coupling in the near field. In this work we develop a theoretical framework that incorporates topological-insulator (TI) surface transport and spintronic interface physics into RF coil electrodynamics. Starting from the Dirac surface Hamiltonian and linear-response (Kubo/Drude) transport, we derive an effective complex surface impedance for TI-coated conductors and establish modified boundary conditions for tangential fields in the presence of spin--momentum locking and spin--charge coupling. We then analyze time-reversal-symmetry-breaking TI/ferromagnet interfaces, where an anomalous Hall surface conductivity produces antisymmetric admittance and enables nonreciprocal RF response. Finally, we connect these results to MRI metrics including coil quality factor, thermal noise, and receive sensitivity through reciprocity-based formulations. The framework identifies parameter regimes in which topological and spintronic surface transport could reduce RF dissipation, modify noise mechanisms, and enable coil-level nonreciprocity without conventional ferrites.

Gaining insight into the interaction between flexible piezoelectric structures and ocean waves can inform the development of compact, high-efficiency wave-energy converters that harvest renewable energy from the marine environment. In this paper, the problem of wave energy absorption by floating and submerged piezoelectric plates is investigated. The equations of motion for a plate consisting of two piezoelectric layers separated by an elastic substrate are derived in dimensional form from the full piezoelectric constitutive laws. A novel solution method based on conversion of hypersingular equations to a matrix operator is presented, which is general and can solve the equations of motion for submerged rigid, flexible elastic or flexible piezoelectric plates. Extensive numerical results are given for a range of parameters, including different piezoelectric materials: polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and lead zirconate titanate (PZT-5H). Importantly, greater energy absorption is obtained for submerged plates when compared to plates floating on the surface. Furthermore, clamped boundary conditions give slightly larger energy absorption compared to the simply supported case.

- **TL;DR**: 研究一维压电准晶体中III型界面裂纹在反平面声子和相位子载荷以及面内电场下的行为，考虑裂纹面的电绝缘和有限渗透条件，获得解析解和数值结果。

The present study provides the consideration of a mode III interface crack in one-dimentional (1D) piezoelectric quasicrystal under antiplane phonon and phason loading and inplane electric field. Due to complex function approach all required electromechanical parameters are presented through vector-functions analytic in the whole complex plane except the crack region. The cases of electrically impermeable (insulated) and electrically limited permeable conditions on the crack faces are considered. In the first case a vector Hilbert problem in the complex plane is formulated and solved exactly and in the second one the quadratic equation with respect to the electric flux through the crack region is obtained additionally. Its solution permits to find phonon and phason stresses, displacement jumps (sliding) and also electric characteristics along the material interface. Analytical formulas are also obtained for the corresponding stress intensity factors related to each field. The numerical computations for three selected variants of the loading conditions was conducted and the resulting field distributions are visualised on the crack continuation beyond the crack and also inside of the crack region.

- **TL;DR**: 本文提出一个理论框架，解释分数陈绝缘体在带宽调控下可直接转变为超导体而非传统费米液体，揭示了超导与分数化之间的交织关系。

Fractional Chern insulators (FCI) are exotic phases of matter realized at partial filling of a Chern band that host fractionally charged anyon excitations. Recent numerical studies in several microscopic models reveal that increasing the bandwidth in an FCI can drive a direct transition into a charge-2e superconductor rather than a conventional Fermi liquid. Motivated by this surprising observation, we propose a theoretical framework that captures the intertwinement between superconductivity and fractionalization in a lattice setting. Leveraging the duality between three field-theoretic descriptions of the Jain topological order, we find that bandwidth tuning can drive a single parent FCI at $ν= 2/3$ into five different superconductors, some of which are intrinsically non-Abelian and support Majorana zero modes. Our results reveal a rich landscape of exotic superconductors with no normal state Fermi surface and predict novel higher-charge superconductors coexisting with neutral non-Abelian topological order at more general filling fractions $ν= p/(2p+1)$.

- **TL;DR**: BattMo是一个基于MATLAB的灵活有限体积连续介质建模框架，用于模拟电化学电池性能，支持多种电池化学和3D设计，采用JSON模式输入参数，遵循BattINFO标准，包含热耦合和降解机制，使用计算图结构和自动微分进行高效参数优化。

This paper presents the Battery Modelling Toolbox (BattMo), a flexible finite volume continuum modelling framework in MATLAB\textsuperscript{\textregistered} (\citeproc{ref-MATLAB}{The MathWorks Inc., 2025}) for simulating the performance of electro-chemical cells. BattMo can quickly setup and solve models for a variety of battery chemistries, even considering 3D designs such as cylindrical and prismatic cells. The simulation input parameters, including the material parameters and geometric descriptions, are specified through JSON schemas. In this respect, we follow the guidelines of the Battery Interface Ontology (BattINFO) to support semantic interoperability in accordance with the FAIR principles (\citeproc{ref-fair}{Wilkinson et al., 2016}). The Doyle-Fuller-Newman (DFN) (\citeproc{ref-Doyle1993ModelingCell}{Doyle et al., 1993}) approach is used as a base model. We include fully coupled thermal simulations. It is possible to include degradation mechanisms such as SEI layer growth, and the use of composite material, such as a mixture of Silicon and graphite. The models are setup in a hierarchical way, for clarity and modularity. Each model corresponds to a computational graph, which introduces a set of variables (the nodes) and functional relationship (the edges). This design enables the flexibility for changing and designing new models. The solver in BattMo uses automatic differentiation and support adjoint computation. We can therefore compute the derivative of objective functions with respect to all parameters efficiently. Gradient-based optimization routines can be used to calibrate parameters from experimental data.

High-temperature and high-magnetic-field-induced re-entrant superconductivity has been discovered in the infinite-layer nickelate $\mathrm{Sm_{1-x-y} Eu_x Ca_y Ni O_2}$ (SECNO). Infinite-layer nickelates are the closest known analogues of high-$\mathrm{T}_c$ cuprate superconductors, yet they host distinct magnetic ground states. Using low-energy muon spin relaxation and polarized neutron reflectometry, we reveal the magnetic order in SECNO. We find that magnetic freezing occurs at a higher-temperature than in other nickelate compounds, and that a substantial net magnetization of 55 $\,\mathrm{kA}\,\mathrm{m}^{-1}$ $\pm10 \,\mathrm{kA}\,\mathrm{m}^{-1}$ emerges and remains largely unchanged across the superconducting transition. The magnetism in SECNO is disordered and nonuniform.

- **TL;DR**: 利用反射超快电子衍射技术，首次在原子尺度观测到分子结界面能量传输的时空动态过程，揭示了金表面与烷基硫醇自组装单层之间的序列能量转移机制。

Interfaces play a crucial role in energy transport at the nanoscale. However, direct experimental observations of interfacial thermal conductance across molecular junctions have remained challenging due to the high spatiotemporal resolution required for probing. Here, we report dynamic energy transport processes across multi-component molecular junctions observed at the atomic level by employing reflection ultrafast electron diffraction. A clear temporal sequence of energy transfer is revealed at early times following photoexcitation of Au(111) surfaces chemically bonded with self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of alkanethiols: from the gold surface layer (SL) to the head groups of a SAM and then to the CH2-CH2 methylene lattice. Remarkably, the structural dynamics of the gold SL differ significantly from those of clean gold. Furthermore, the methylene lattice dynamics exhibit chain-length insensitivity but with a length-dependent retention time to reach full thermalization. Quantitatively, we find an agreement in the increased out-of-plane atomic motions between the surface gold atoms and the SAM methylene units, signifying the nature of motion-based coupling for interfacial energy transport. High interfacial thermal conductance (~300 MW/m^2/K) and high thermal conductivity for the methylene lattice (~60 W/m/K) are obtained under the condition of impulsive heating, which provide strong support for previous room-temperature theoretical predictions and also the ballistic nature of intrachain heat transfer. This time- and spatially-resolved experimental approach will enable future quantitative assessment of interfacial energy transport across solid-molecule junctions.

- **TL;DR**: 基于归一化流的计算框架，通过直接映射不同大小溶质间的溶剂构型，提高溶剂化自由能计算效率

Accurate calculations of solvation free energies remain a central challenge in molecular simulations, often requiring extensive sampling and numerous alchemical intermediates to ensure sufficient overlap between phase-space distributions of a solute in the gas phase and in solution. Here, we introduce a computational framework based on normalizing flows that directly maps solvent configurations between solutes of different sizes, and compare the accuracy and efficiency to conventional free energy estimates. For a Lennard-Jones solvent, we demonstrate that this approach yields acceptable accuracy in estimating free energy differences for challenging transformations, such as solute growth or increased solute-solute separation, which typically demand multiple intermediate simulation steps along the transformation. Analysis of radial distribution functions indicates that the flow generates physically meaningful solvent rearrangements, substantially enhancing configurational overlap between states in configuration space. These results suggest flow-based models as a promising alternative to traditional free energy estimation methods.

We investigate dynamic crack propagation and fragmentation with the phase-field fracture approach. The method was chosen for its ability to yield crack paths that are independent of the underlying mesh, thanks to the damage regularization zone. In dynamics, we observe a progressive widening of this regularization zone and attribute it to an unphysical trapping of elastic waves. We show that the damage zones do not represent free boundaries accurately and that wave interactions induce additional damage. We reveal how mass erosion, by conserving the elastic wave speed in the damaged regions, can be used to efficiently reduce the spurious diffusion of damage. Furthermore, we provide numerical evidence that dynamically propagating cracks in the phase-field formulation, both with and without mass erosion, converge to the predictions of linear elastic fracture mechanics. For vanishing regularization length, the crack speed and energy release rate become independent of the phase-field regularization length, provided that this length scale is small enough and the mesh fine enough to resolve the process zone.

Engineering unconventional superconductors is a central challenge in condensed matter physics. Molecule-intercalated TaS2 superlattices have recently been reported to host such states, yet their origin remains debated, underscoring the urgent need for controlled, device-integrated studies. Here, we report that nanometer-thick TaS2 and NbSe2 intercalated with chiral and achiral organic cations instead exhibit robust monolayer-like Ising superconductivity, with no evidence of unconventional pairing. Using high-quality superlattices integrated into devices, we disentangle the roles of interlayer coupling and charge transfer in shaping their superconducting behavior. In TaS2, intercalation induces interlayer decoupling regardless of molecular size or symmetry, yielding monolayer-like Ising superconductivity. NbSe2 instead retains quasi-three-dimensional transport, with a gradual Ising enhancement and near-monolayer behavior only at the largest interlayer spacing. Transport remains reciprocal across all superlattices, consistent with preserved inversion symmetry and incompatible with parity-breaking superconductivity and noncentrosymmetric monolayers. We attribute the behavior to electronically detached monolayers with opposite spin-split bands, coupled through thermal and tunneling processes, which overall preserve inversion symmetry. These findings establish molecular intercalation compounds as a robust, device-ready, platform for engineering advanced superconducting superlattices.

- **TL;DR**: 线性惊奇分析应用于H+HI→H₂+I反应的态-态实验数据，考虑运动学能量约束后，该反应产物分布可用线性惊奇参数准确描述，这与先前认为不适用线性惊奇的结果相反。

Linear surprisal analysis is applied to state-to-state experimental results for the H-atom abstraction reaction, H + HI -&gt; H2 + I. Contrary to previously reported results that indicated that the products from this reaction were not well fit by a linear surprisal, the reaction can be accurately described by linear surprisal parameters when kinematic energy constraints are taken into account. This is further evidence of the important role mass effects play in the energy disposal of state-to-state reactions and of the quantitative value of a very simple model to predict the maximum energy available to the internal states of the products.

### Electronic Phonons in a Moiré Electron Crystal

Collective quantum phenomena, such as the excitation of composite fermions1, spin waves2, and exciton condensation3,4, can emerge in strongly correlated systems like the fractional quantum Hall states5, spin liquids6, or excitonic insulators7. Two-dimensional (2D) moiré superlattices have emerged as a powerful platform for exploring such correlated phases and their associated collective excitations8,9. Specifically, electron crystals stabilized by longrange Coulomb interactions may host collective vibrational excitations emerging from electron correlations10, termed electronic phonons, which are fundamentally distinct from atomic lattice phonons. Despite theoretical prediction of their existence in moiré electron crystals11, direct experimental evidence has remained elusive. Here we report the observation of electronic phonons in the Mott insulating and stripe phases of a WS2/WSe2 moiré superlattice, achieved through light scattering measurements. The phonon energies, temperature and filling factor dependencies, along with theoretical modeling, corroborate their origin as collective vibrations of a correlated electron crystal. Polarization-resolved measurements further indicate rotational symmetry breaking in the Mott state. Notably, these electronic phonons exhibit strong tunability in energy, intensity, and polarization under external electric or magnetic fields, highlighting rich and controllable lattice dynamics of the electron crystal. These findings provide direct spectroscopic evidence for the electronic crystalline nature of correlated phases, opening avenues for probing and manipulating collective excitations in correlated electron systems.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种系统变分优化方法，用于设计硅锗异质结构中的锗浓度分布，以增强谷分裂并抑制无序波动，开发出新型"调制摆动阱"设计。

The notoriously low and fluctuating valley splitting is one of the key challenges for electron spin qubits in silicon (Si), limiting the scalability of Si-based quantum processors. In silicon-germanium (SiGe) heterostructures, the problem can be addressed by the design of the epitaxial layer stack. Several heuristic strategies have been proposed to enhance the energy gap between the two nearly degenerate valley states in strained Si/SiGe quantum wells (QWs), e.g., sharp Si/SiGe interfaces, Ge spikes or oscillating Ge concentrations within the QW. In this work, we develop a systematic variational optimization approach to compute optimal Ge concentration profiles that boost selected properties of the intervalley coupling matrix element. Our free-shape optimization approach is augmented by a number of technological constraints to ensure feasibility of the resulting epitaxial profiles. The method is based on an effective-mass-type envelope-function theory accounting for the effects of strain and compositional alloy disorder. Various previously proposed heterostructure designs are recovered as special cases of the constrained optimization problem. Our main result is a novel heterostructure design we refer to as the "modulated wiggle well," which provides a large deterministic enhancement of the valley splitting along with a reliable suppression of the disorder-induced volatility. In addition, our new design offers a wide-range tunability of the valley splitting ranging from about 200 $μ$eV to above 1 meV controlled by the vertical electric field, which offers new perspectives to engineer switchable qubits with on-demand adjustable valley splitting.

Particle currents flowing against an external driving are a fascinating phenomenon in both single-particle and interacting many-particle systems. Underlying physical mechanisms of such current reversals are not fully understood yet. Predicting their appearance is difficult, in particular for interaction-induced ones that emerge upon changes of the particle density. We here derive conditions on external time-dependent drivings, under which current reversals occur in lattice gases with arbitrary pair interactions. Our derivation is based on particle-hole symmetry and shows that current reversals must emerge if the time-varying driving potential changes sign after a translation in time and/or space. Our treatment includes nonstationary dynamics and time-dependent spatially averaged currents in nonequilibrium steady states. It gives insight also into possible occurrences of current reversals in continuous-space dynamics, which we demonstrate for hardcore interacting particles driven across a periodic potential by a traveling wave.

We review recent advances in Klein and anti-Klein tunneling in one- and two-dimensional materials. Using a general tight-binding framework applied to multiple periodic systems, we establish the criteria for the emergence of Klein tunneling based on the conservation of an effective reduced pseudospin. The inclusion of higher-order terms in the wave vector leads to nontrivial matching conditions for wave scattering at interfaces. We further examine the emergence of multiple types of Klein tunneling in two-dimensional materials beyond graphene, including phosphorene and borophene, as well as in one-dimensional systems such as Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattices. Finally, we discuss how these tunneling phenomena can be tested in both synthesized and artificial lattices, including elastic metamaterials, optical, photonic, phononic, and superconducting platforms, demonstrating the universality of Klein tunneling across different wave natures and length scales.

- **TL;DR**: LES框架通过两个设计原则为MLIPs添加长程静电作用：使用环境依赖电荷的库仑函数形式，避免显式训练模糊的DFT部分电荷。

The lack of long-range electrostatics is a key limitation of modern machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs), hindering reliable applications to interfaces, charge-transfer reactions, polar and ionic materials, and biomolecules. In this Perspective, we distill two design principles behind the Latent Ewald Summation (LES) framework, which can capture long-range interactions, charges, and electrical response just by learning from standard energy and force training data: (i) use a Coulomb functional form with environment-dependent charges to capture electrostatic interactions, and (ii) avoid explicit training on ambiguous density functional theory (DFT) partial charges. When both principles are satisfied, substantial flexibility remains: essentially any short-range MLIP can be augmented; charge equilibration schemes can be added when desired; dipoles and Born effective charges can be inferred or finetuned; and charge/spin-state embeddings or tensorial targets can be further incorporated. We also discuss current limitations and open challenges. Together, these minimal, physics-guided design rules suggest that incorporating long-range electrostatics into MLIPs is simpler and perhaps more broadly applicable than is commonly assumed.

In quantum materials, charge orders typically stabilize in specific crystallographic orientations, though their formation mechanisms may vary. Here, using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), we discover a lattice-decoupled rotatable stripe-like charge order coexisting with superconductivity in 2M-WS2. The charge order manifests five distinct orientations across different sample regions, yet maintains an identical wavelength. This directional decoupling from host lattice challenges existing paradigms. First-principles calculations of phonon spectra and nesting function fail to explain the ordering mechanism. Intriguingly, the transition temperature of the charge orders exhibits spatial variations (21-46 K), coinciding with the temperature range of the recently reported strange metal phase in this material. This correlation suggests that the interplay between strong electronic correlations and electron-phonon coupling must be critically evaluated to elucidate the emergence of this unconventional charge order.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文提出了首个用于活性空间驱动VQE的系统性基准测试，评估了药物分子在量子计算中的适用性及活性空间选择对VQE流程的影响。

Quantum computers promise scalable treatments of electronic structure, yet applying variational quantum eigensolvers (VQE) on realistic drug-like molecules remains constrained by the performance limitations of near-term quantum hardwares. A key strategy for addressing this challenge which effectively leverages current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardwares yet remains under-benchmarked is active space selection. We introduce a benchmark that heuristically proposes criteria based on chemically grounded metrics to classify the suitability of a molecule for using quantum computing and then quantifies the impact of active space choices across the VQE pipeline for quantum drug discovery. The suite covers several representative drug-like molecules (e.g., lovastatin, oseltamivir, morphine) and uses chemically motivated active spaces. Our VQE evaluations employ both simulation and quantum processing unit (QPU) execution using unitary coupled-cluster with singles and doubles (UCCSD) and hardware-efficient ansatz (HEA). We adopt a more comprehensive evaluation, including chemistry metrics and architecture-centric metrics. For accuracy, we compare them with classical quantum chemistry methods. This work establishes the first systematic benchmark for active space driven VQE and lays the groundwork for future hardware-algorithm co-design studies in quantum drug discovery.

Computing spectral functions in large, non-periodic super-moiré systems remains an open problem due to the exceptionally large system size that must be considered. Here, we establish a tensor network methodology that allows computing momentum-resolved spectral functions of non-interacting and interacting super-moiré systems at an atomistic level. Our methodology relies on encoding an exponentially large tight-binding problem as an auxiliary quantum many-body problem, solved with a many-body kernel polynomial tensor network algorithm combined with a quantum Fourier transform tensor network. We demonstrate the method for one and two-dimensional super-moiré systems, including super-moiré with non-uniform strain, interactions treated at the mean-field level, and quasicrystalline super-moiré patterns. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our methodology allows us to compute momentum-resolved spectral functions restricted to selected regions of a super-moiré, enabling direct imaging of position-dependent electronic structure and minigaps in super-moiré systems with non-uniform strain. Our results establish a powerful methodology to compute momentum-resolved spectral functions in exceptionally large super-moiré systems, providing a tool to directly model scanning twisting microscope tunneling experiments in twisted van der Waals heterostructures.

In this article, we explain the reason of the apparent contradiction between recent experiments [1] and [2] and earlier theoretical predictions [3] of strongly asymmetric condensate resulting in attractive interaction between the condensate magnons. We show that the relaxation time for equilibrium between two condensates at two minima of energy exceeds the time of experiment. Therefore, it should be described by Boltzmann kinetic equation. We develop the proper kinetic theory and find the relation between the critical pumping power and the effective temperature of over-condensate magnons.

We establish a 2-to-1 correspondence between the configurations of trimers on the kagome lattice to the covering by dimers of a related hexagonal lattice to show that entropy of coverings per trimer $s_{\text{tri,kag}}$ equals the entropy per dimer $ s_{\text{dim,hex}} $, and is given by $ s_{\text{tri,kag}} = s_{\text{dim,hex}} = \frac{1}{2 π} \int_0^{ 2 π/3} \log( 2 + 2 \cos k) dk \approx 0.323065947\ldots$.

- **TL;DR**: 论文提出了一种最小连续时间公式的家庭静态调节再入网络(FHRN)，通过一维径向流简化揭示了持续反射活动的动态固定阈值，并完成了再入-稳态相互作用的完整重整化群分析。

Reentrant computation-recursive self-coupling in which a network continuously reinjects and reinterprets its own internal state-plays a central role in biological cognition but remains poorly characterized in neural network architectures. We introduce a minimal continuous-time formulation of a homeostatically regulated reentrant network (FHRN) and show that its population dynamics admit an exact reduction to a one-dimensional radial flow. This reduction reveals a dynamically fixed threshold for sustained reflective activity and enables a complete renormalization-group (RG) analysis of the reentry-homeostasis interaction. We derive a closed RG system for the parameters governing structural gain, homeostatic stiffness, and reentrant amplification, and show that all trajectories are attracted to a critical surface defined by $γρ=1$, where intrinsic leak and reentrant drive exactly balance. The resulting phase structure comprises quenched, reactive, and reflective regimes and exhibits a mean-field critical onset with universal scaling. Our results provide an RG-theoretic characterization of reflective computation and demonstrate how homeostatic fields stabilize deep reentrant transformations through scale-dependent self-regulation.

We study the surface density of states in $p$-wave unconventional magnet-spin-singlet $s$-wave superconductor hybrid systems ($p$-wave unconventional magnetic superconductors), by using the effective model [B. Brekke, et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 236703 (2024)]. Owing to the noncollinear spin structure along the $x$-direction, the quasiparticle energy dispersion has the spin-triplet $p_x$-wave energy gap structure, and then zero-energy flat bands emerge at the [100] edge. Analyzing the pair amplitude at the [100] edge, odd-frequency spin-triplet even-parity pairing is induced in the presence of zero-energy flat bands, while even-frequency spin-singlet even-parity remains. We also demonstrate the Josephson current in superconducting junctions with $p$-wave unconventional magnet-conventional $s$-wave superconductor hybrid systems. By the cooperation of spin-singlet $s$-wave pair potential and the $p$-wave unconventional magnetic order, the current phase relation shows the $\varphi$-junction in the high-transparency but also the temperature dependence of the Josephson current caused by the coupling of the spin-singlet even-parity pairings in the low-transparency limit, even though $p$-wave superconductivity is mainly realized both in the bulk and at the edge. Our calculations provide the possible superconducting phenomena and transport properties in $p$-wave unconventional magnet-$s$-wave SC hybrid systems.

Strong light-matter coupling enables hybrid states in which photonic and electronic degrees of freedom become correlated even in the ground state. While many-body effects in long-range dispersion interactions are known to reshape electronic properties under such conditions, their impact on quantum-optical observables remains largely unexplored. Here, we address this problem using quantum electrodynamical density-functional theory (QEDFT) combined with the recently developed photon-many-body dispersion (pMBD) functional, which can capture higher-order electron-photon correlations and multi-photon processes. We compute ground-state photonic observables including photon number fluctuations, second-order correlations, and quadrature variances, and find squeezing and super-Poissonian photon statistics emerging from light-matter interactions in the strong coupling regime. Our results demonstrate that capturing the full hierarchy of many-body, electron-photon and multi-photon correlations is essential for a consistent description of quantum-optical properties in strongly coupled molecular systems, establishing QEDFT as a first-principles framework for predicting nonclassical photonic features in the ground state of complex systems.

- **TL;DR**: 构建了一个二维玻色对称保护拓扑（SPT）顺磁体，具有Z4×3对称性，边界呈现中心荷c≈11/5的共形场论特征

We construct a two-dimensional bosonic symmetry-protected topological (SPT) paramagnet protected by an on-site $G=\mathbb{Z}_4^{\times 3}$ symmetry, starting from a three-component $\mathbb{Z}_4$ Potts paramagnet on a triangular lattice. Within the group-cohomology framework, $H^{3}(G,U(1))\cong \mathbb{Z}_4^{\times 7}$, we focus on a "colorless" cocycle representative obtained by antisymmetrizing the basic $\mathbb{Z}_4$ three-cocycle, and generate the corresponding SPT Hamiltonian via a cocycle-induced nonlocal unitary transformation followed by symmetry averaging. For open geometry, we derive the boundary theory explicitly: one color sector decouples, while the nontrivial edge reduces to an interacting $\mathbb{Z}_4$ chain with next-to-nearest-neighbor constraints that admits a compact dressed-Potts form. Using DMRG we show that the boundary model is gapless, with the lowest gap scaling as $1/L$ and an entanglement-entropy scaling consistent with a conformal field theory of central charge $c=2.191(4)\simeq 11/5$. The rational value $c=11/5$ matches the coset $SU(3)_3/SU(2)_3$, making it a candidate for the continuum description of the $\mathbb{Z}_4^{\times 3}$ edge; we outline spectral and symmetry-resolved diagnostics needed to test this identification at the level of conformal towers beyond the central charge.

The time evolution of initially localized wavepackets in the discrete Hatano-Nelson lattice displays a rich dynamical structure shaped by the interplay between dispersion and nonreciprocity. Our analysis reveals a characteristic evolution of the wave-packet center of mass, which undergoes an initial acceleration, subsequently slows down, and ultimately enters a regime of uniform motion, accompanied throughout by exponential amplification of the wave-packet amplitude. To capture this behavior, we develop a continuum approximation that incorporates higher-order dispersive and nonreciprocal effects and provides accurate analytical predictions across all relevant time scales. Building on this framework, we then demonstrate the existence of a non-Hermiticity-induced jump - an abrupt spatial shift of the wave-packet center even in the absence of disorder - and derive its underlying analytical foundation. The analytical predictions are in excellent agreement with direct numerical simulations of the Hatano-Nelson chain. Our results elucidate the interplay between dispersion and nonreciprocity in generating unconventional transport phenomena, and pave the way for controlling wave dynamics in nonreciprocal and non-Hermitian metamaterials.

The partition functions of ferromagnetic Ising models of square lattices in a finite magnetic field is deduced using topological considerations within a heuristic graph-theoretical approach. These equations are derived separately for low and high temperature regimes while the exact solution of Onsager is obtained therefrom when the magnetic field is zero. The derived partition function equations here are almost similar to those given by Onsager, thus indicating a straight-forward protocol, even when the magnetic field is present. The spontaneous magnetization derived here using the Helmholtz free energy is identical with that arising from the exact solution. The partition functions lead to the known series expansions of the magnetization and zero-field susceptibility.

- **TL;DR**: 通过使用柠檬酸盐配体添加剂调控化学浴沉积生长机制，降低Sb2S3薄膜缺陷密度，实现824 mV开路电压记录，突破自陷效应限制

Sb2S3 is a promising material for low-toxicity, high-stability next-generation photovoltaics. Despite high optical limits in efficiency, progress in improving its device performance has been limited by severe voltage losses. Recent spectroscopic investigations suggest that self-trapping occurs in Sb2S3, limiting the open-circuit voltage (Voc) to a maximum of approximately 800 mV, which is the level the field has asymptotically approached. In this work, we surpass this voltage barrier through reductions in the defect density in Sb2S3 thin films by modulating the growth mechanism in chemical bath deposition using citrate ligand additives. Deep level transient spectroscopy identifies two deep traps 0.4-0.7 eV above the valence band maximum, and, through first-principles calculations, we identify these to likely be S vacancies, or Sb on S anti-sites. The concentrations of these traps are lowered by decreasing the grain boundary density from 1114+/-52 nm/um2 to 585+/-10 nm/um2, and we achieve a Voc of 824 mV, the record for Sb2S3 solar cells. This work addresses the debate in the field around whether Sb2S3 is limited by defects or self-trapping, showing that it is possible to improve the performance towards the radiative limit through careful defect engineering.

### Self-Consistent Probability Flow for High-Dimensional Fokker-Planck Equations

- **TL;DR**: 提出SCPF方法解决高维Fokker-Planck方程计算难题，通过转化为一阶概率流ODE约束，结合CNF和HTE将复杂度降至O(D)，实现高效高维求解。

Solving high-dimensional Fokker-Planck (FP) equations is a challenge in computational physics and stochastic dynamics, due to the curse of dimensionality (CoD) and the bottleneck of evaluating second-order diffusion terms. Existing deep learning approaches, such as Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), face computational challenges as dimensionality increases, driven by the $O(D^2)$ complexity of automatic differentiation for second-order derivatives. While recent probability flow approaches bypass this by learning score functions or matching velocity fields, they often involve serial computational operations or depend on sampling efficiency in complex distributions. To address these issues, we propose the Self-Consistent Probability Flow (SCPF) method. We reformulate the second-order FP equation into an equivalent first-order deterministic Probability Flow ODE (PF-ODE) constraint. Unlike score matching or velocity matching, SCPF solves this problem by minimizing the residual of the PF-ODE continuity equation, which avoids explicit Hessian computation. We leverage Continuous Normalizing Flows (CNF) combined with the Hutchinson Trace Estimator (HTE) to reduce the training complexity to linear scale $O(D)$, achieving an effective $O(1)$ wall-clock time on GPUs. To address data sparsity in high dimensions, we apply a generative adaptive sampling strategy and theoretically prove that dynamically aligning collocation points with the evolving probability mass is a necessary condition to bound the approximation error. Experiments on diverse benchmarks -- ranging from anisotropic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) processes and high-dimensional Brownian motions with time-varying diffusion terms, to Geometric OU processes featuring non-Gaussian solutions -- demonstrate that SCPF effectively mitigates the CoD, maintaining high accuracy and constant computational cost for problems up to 100 dimensions.

Niobium and its alloys with early transition metals have been extensively studied for their excellent superconducting properties. They have high transition temperatures, strong upper critical fields, and high critical current densities, making them ideal for superconducting applications such as SQUIDs, MRI, NMR, particle accelerators, and Qubits. Here we report a systematic investigation of as-cast Nb-rich alloys, Nb$_{0.85}$X$_{0.15}$ (X = Ti, Zr, Hf), using magnetization, electrical transport, and specific heat measurements. They exhibit strong type-II bulk superconductivity with moderate superconducting transition temperatures and upper critical fields. The estimated magnetic field-dependent critical current density lies in the range of 10$^5$--10$^6$~A/cm$^2$ across various temperatures, while the corresponding flux-pinning force density is on the order of GNm$^{-3}$, suggesting the potential of these materials for practical applications. Electronic-specific heat data reveal a strongly coupled, single, isotropic, nodeless superconducting gap. These Nb-rich alloys, characterized by robust superconducting properties, hold significant potential for applications in superconducting device technologies.

- **TL;DR**: 基于深度学习的NMR谱图解析框架，仅使用一维¹H和¹³C NMR谱图即可预测含40个非氢原子的有机分子结构，准确率达55.2%（前15个预测中）

One-dimensional NMR spectroscopy is one of the most widely used techniques for the characterization of organic compounds and natural products. For molecules with up to 36 non-hydrogen atoms, the number of possible structures has been estimated to range from $10^{20} - 10^{60}$. The task of determining the structure (formula and connectivity) of a molecule of this size using only its one-dimensional $^1$H and/or $^{13}$C NMR spectrum, i.e. de novo structure generation, thus appears completely intractable. Here we show how it is possible to achieve this task for systems with up to 40 non-hydrogen atoms across the full elemental coverage typically encountered in organic chemistry (C, N, O, H, P, S, Si, B, and the halogens) using a deep learning framework, thus covering a vast portion of the drug-like chemical space. Leveraging insights from natural language processing, we show that our transformer-based architecture predicts the correct molecule with 55.2% accuracy within the first 15 predictions using only the $^1$H and $^{13}$C NMR spectra, thus overcoming the combinatorial growth of the chemical space while also being extensible to experimental data via fine-tuning.

We investigated the lattice dynamics of quasi-two-dimensional Pd-intercalated $\mathrm{ErTe}_3$ in relation to its charge-density-wave (CDW) transitions by means of x-ray diffuse and meV-resolution inelastic x-ray scattering. In pristine $\mathrm{ErTe}_3$, CDW order develops at orthogonal in-plane wave vectors $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{q}}_{1}^{c} = (0, 0, 0.29)$ (the $c\text{-}\mathrm{CDW}$) and $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{q}}_{2}^{a} = (0.31, 0, 0)$ (the $a\text{-}\mathrm{CDW}$), with transition temperatures $T_{1}^{c} = 270$~K and $T_{2}^{a} = 160$~K, respectively. Remarkably, we observe diffuse x-ray scattering already near the higher transition temperature $T_{1}^{c}$ along $a\text{-}\mathrm{CDW}$ but at a slightly different wave vector $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{q}}_{1}^{a} = (0.29, 0, 0)$. Inelastic x-ray scattering for $\mathrm{Pd}_{0.01}\mathrm{ErTe}_3$ shows that a partial phonon softening at $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{q}}_{1}^{a}$, underscoring the strong competition between ordering tendencies along the nearly equivalent in-plane axes of the orthorhombic lattice. For intercalation levels $x \geq 0.02$, the $a\text{-}\mathrm{CDW}$ state is suppressed. Nevertheless, a similar correlation between phonon softening and diffuse scattering persists along the $[100]$ direction, again observed at $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{q}}_{1}^{a} = (0.29, 0, 0)$ and $T_{1}^{c}$. These findings confirm that the $a\text{-}\mathrm{CDW}$ is fully suppressed for $x \geq 0.02$, and that the residual diffuse scattering at $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{q}}_{1}^{a}$ originates from the partial phonon softening associated with the $c\text{-}\mathrm{CDW}$, reflected by the near equality of the absolute size of $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{q}}_{1}^{c}$ and $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{q}}_{1}^{a}$. In highly intercalated $\mathrm{Pd}_{0.023}\mathrm{ErTe}_3$, the phonon softening remains incomplete, possibly linked to the recently reported CDW Bragg glass state.

Plasmons in atomically thin materials offer a compelling route to trigger nonlinear light-matter interactions through extreme optical confinement in the two-dimensional (2D) limit. However, optical nonlocality in plasmons is typically associated with losses in the linear response regime. Here, we show that nonlocal effects mediate strong plasmon-assisted optical nonlinearity in electrically reconfigurable 2D heterostructures. Using atomistic simulations that capture quantum finite-size and nonlocal effects in the nonlinear plasmonic response of graphene and phosphorene nanoribbon dimers, we reveal how symmetry and inter-ribbon coupling shape harmonic generation processes in perturbative and high-harmonic regimes. Independent tuning of geometry and carrier density in nanoribbon heterostructures is shown to induce inter-ribbon plasmon hybridization, impacting inversion symmetry governing even-ordered nonlinear processes like second-harmonic generation. These results reveal design principles for active and passive tuning of nonlinear plasmonic effects and enable selective enhancement of specific harmonic processes, establishing 2D heterostructures as a versatile platform for nonlinear nanophotonics.

Changing environmental conditions can significantly affect the dynamics of disease spread. These changes may arise naturally or result from human interventions; in the latter case, lockdown measures that lead to abrupt but temporary reductions in transmission rates are used to combat disease spread. However, the impact of these measures on rare events in realistic populations has not been studied so far. Here, we analyze the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model in a stochastic setting where disease extinction -- a sudden clearance of the infection -- occurs via a rare, large fluctuation. We use a semiclassical approximation and extensive numerical simulations to show how the extinction risk of the disease depends on both the duration and magnitude of the lockdown, in heterogeneous assortative networks, with degree-degree correlations between neighboring nodes.

The Coulomb potential at an interior ion in a finite crystal of size $p$ is given by a linear superposition of contributions from displacement vectors ${\mathbf r}=(x,y,z)$ to its neighbors. This additive structure underlies universal relationships among Madelung constants and applies to both standard periodic boundary conditions and alternative Clifford supercells. Each pairwise contribution decomposes into three physically distinct components: a periodic bulk term, a quadratic boundary term, and a finite-size correction whose leading order term is $[24r^4-40(x^4+y^4+z^4)]/[9\sqrt{3} (2p+1)^2]$ for cubic crystals with unit lattice constant. Combining this decomposition with linear superposition yields a rapidly convergent direct-summation scheme, accurate even at $p=1$ ($3^3$ unit cells), enabling hands-on calculations of Madelung constants for a wide range of ionic crystals.

- **TL;DR**: 提出基于子域截断矩约束的最优不确定性量化框架，用于系统安全认证的概率失效边界计算，通过逆变换采样降低高维计算成本，并与证据理论建立等价关系。

We present an optimal uncertainty quantification (OUQ) framework for systems whose uncertain inputs are characterized by truncated moment constraints defined over subdomains. Based on this partial information, rigorous optimal upper and lower bounds on the probability of failure (PoF) are derived over the admissible set of probability measures, providing a principled basis for system safety certification. We formulate the OUQ problem under general subdomain moment constraints and develop a high-performance computational framework to compute the optimal bounds. This approach transforms the original infinite-dimensional optimization problems into finite-dimensional unconstrained ones parameterized solely by free canonical moments. To address the prohibitive cost of PoF evaluation in high-dimensional settings, we incorporate inverse transform sampling (ITS), enabling efficient and accurate PoF estimation within the OUQ optimization. We also demonstrate that constraining inputs only by zeroth-order moments over subdomains yields a formulation equivalent to evidence theory. Three groups of numerical examples demonstrate the framework's effectiveness and scalability. Results show that increasing the number of subdomains or the moment order systematically tightens the bound interval. For high-dimensional problems, the ITS strategy reduces computational costs by up to two orders of magnitude while maintaining relative error below 1%. Furthermore, we identify regimes where optimal bounds are sensitive to subdomain partitioning or higher-order moments, guiding uncertainty reduction efforts for safety certification.

- **TL;DR**: 本文提出了一种通过Mg诱导表面还原在KTaO3(111)上生成超导二维电子气的简单方法，该方法允许直接光谱测量而无需厚覆盖层。

Two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) at the surfaces of KTaO3 have become an exciting platform for exploring strong spin-orbit coupling, Rashba physics, and low-carrier-density superconductivity. Yet, a large fraction of reported KTaO3-based 2DEGs has been realized through chemically complex overlayers that both generate carriers and can obscure the native electronic structure, making spectroscopic access to the underlying 2DEG challenging. Here, we demonstrate a simple and direct method to generate a superconducting 2DEG on KTaO3(111) using Mg-induced surface reduction in molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE). Mg has an extremely low sticking coefficient at elevated temperatures, enabling the formation of an ultrathin (less than 1-2 monolayers) MgO layer that is transparent to soft x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). This allows direct measurement of the surface chemistry and low-energy electronic structure of the pristine reduced surface without the need for a several-nanometer-thick capping layer. XPS shows clear reduction of Ta5+ to lower oxidation states, while ARPES reveals a parabolic Ta 5d conduction band with an approximately 150 meV bandwidth and additional subband features arising from quantum confinement. Transport measurements confirm a superconducting transition below 0.6 K. Together, these results demonstrate a chemically straightforward and controllable pathway for fabricating spectroscopically accessible superconducting 2DEGs on KTaO3(111), and provide a powerful new platform for investigating the mechanisms underlying orientation-dependent superconductivity in KTaO3-based oxide interfaces.

Gibbs-ensemble Monte Carlo (GEMC) is a powerful method for calculating the gas-liquid binodals of simple models and small molecules, but is too demanding computationally for realistic models of proteins. Here we discover that the main reason for long simulations is that volume exchange is very slow to achieve, and develop a variant GEMC without volume exchange. The key is to determine an appropriate initial density. Test of this fixed-volume GEMC method on Lennard-Jones and patchy particles shows enormous speedup without any loss of accuracy in predicted binodals. The fast speed of fixed-volume GEMC promises many applications.

Amorphous oxide tunneling barriers, primarily formed from aluminum, represent one of the most widely adopted platforms for superconducting quantum bits (qubits). To overcome challenges associated with defects and sample variance among the tunneling barriers, the methodology of alternating bias assisted annealing (ABAA) was introduced in Pappas et. al[1]. The process of applying alternating bias to the barrier and subsequently aging before use was shown to reduce defects in the barrier. Namely, defects that give rise to two-level systems, coupling to the qubit and expediting decoherence. In this work we replicate an expedited ABAA process through a combination of ab-initio molecular dynamics and machine-learned potentials, illuminating how ABAA effects the energy landscape of the barrier.

### Time transport correlations in abelian sandpile models

Sandpiles form one of the largest class of models displaying a critical stationary state. Despite a few decades of research, a comprehensive and systematic rigorous characterisation of their spatial and, even more, time dependent properties has remained elusive. Among the obstacles, we can mention their out of equilibrium and non-linear dynamics features which prevent, in general, the access to the stationary properties explicitly. In fact, even the knowledge of the stationary state is quite exceptional in sandpiles. In that respect, it has become standard to develop a model to model strategy and, so to say, general results or tools applicable to these systems are missing. In this paper, we unveil general and simple properties of time transport correlations in certain classes of abelian sandpile models. We proceed gradually, starting from results applicable in a broad context, to more and more specific ones, consequently valid to smaller and smaller classes. For instance, we show, under a few hypothesis, that the number of particles dissipated displays mostly anticorrelation in time. Besides, on a more integrable point of view, the approach followed might culminate with the proof of a link between 2-points time transport correlations and the second moment of the integrated transport over time. To be clear, these two quantities are related through a linear system of equations which is explicitly solved and applies to at least three 1D sandpile models, namely the Directed Stochastic Sandpile, the Oslo and the Activated Random Walk (in a peculiar setup) models.

High-entropy materials have emerged as a promising class of catalysts, driven by their high configurational entropy originating from structural disorder in single-phase multicomponent systems. Despite their potential, the catalytic performance of high-entropy oxides (HEOs) remains relatively underexplored. In this study, we present a simple solution-based combustion route to synthesize two low-cost, transition metal-rich multicationic oxides positioned in the medium-entropy (HEO-4) and high-entropy (HEO-5) regimes. Rietveld refinement of powder X-ray diffraction data confirmed single-phase formation with a face-centered cubic (fcc) crystal structure for both nanostructures.
  The morphology, particle size, and multicationic elemental distribution were investigated using scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The catalytic performance of the synthesized HEOs was evaluated in the hydrogenation of a series of nitrophenol derivatives. Notably, HEO-5 exhibited significantly enhanced catalytic activity ($k_{\mathrm{app}} \approx 0.5~\mathrm{min^{-1}}$, TOF $= 2.1 \times 10^{-3}~\mathrm{mol\,g^{-1}\,s^{-1}}$), achieving rapid conversion of \emph{p}-nitrophenol compared to the medium-entropy oxide nanostructures ($k_{\mathrm{app}} \approx 0.02~\mathrm{min^{-1}}$, TOF $= 7.2 \times 10^{-4}~\mathrm{mol\,g^{-1}\,s^{-1}}$). Furthermore, the kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of the reaction, including the activation energy ($E_a$), enthalpy of activation ($ΔH^{\ddagger}$), Gibbs free energy of activation ($ΔG^{\ddagger}$), and entropy of activation ($ΔS^{\ddagger}$), were determined to gain mechanistic insight into the reduction process. This study opens new avenues for the rational design and facile synthesis of high-entropy oxide catalysts, highlighting their potential for efficient and sustainable large-scale amine production.

In this work, we explore the possible emergence of superconducting phases in a multi-Weyl semimetal. In particular, we show that the presence of a pair of Weyl nodes with chirality $|ν| \ge 1$ leads to an effective description of the intra-nodal pairings in terms of monopole harmonics, in contrast to inter-nodal pairings that preserve the angular dependence of conventional spherical harmonics. Therefore, we explore the conditions for the competition and/or coexistence between both types of superconducting phases, and we identify the presence of the so-called "topological repulsion" mechanism, which was previously reported in the context of simple Weyl semimetals. We identified the critical temperatures corresponding to the monopole and conventional superconducting phases, and calculated the specific heat as a function of temperature, thus showing that this thermodynamical parameter may provide an experimental probe to determine the chirality index $ν$ in the material.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文发现了一种新型手性光学信号：具有手性敏感性但不具有圆二色性的光电子动量分布不对称性，打破了传统手性光学效应的范式。

Chiroptical effects using circularly polarized light produce signals that change sign when switching either molecular handedness (enantiosensitivity) or the light helicity (circular dichroism). Here, we break this enantiosensitive-and-dichroic paradigm by measuring a new type of chiroptical signal which is enantiosensitive but not dichroic. We photoionize chiral molecules using a strong laser field and detect the three-dimensional photoelectron momentum distribution. The non-dichroic, enantiosensitive asymmetry is encoded in octupolar and higher multipolar terms in the photoelectron angular distribution, which appear in multiphoton ionization with elliptically polarized fields or cross polarized two-color fields. The robustness of the enantiosensitivity with respect to the relative phase between the vectorial components of the ionizing field represents an example of symmetry protection, and opens unexplored opportunities for imaging ultrafast dynamics in chiral molecules, such as enantiosensitive photoelectron spectroscopy with bright squeezed vacuum states.

- **TL;DR**: 提出一种基于插值方法（如两点Padé展开）从微扰结果构造强相互作用量子场论关联函数全局近似的方法，并在φ⁴理论和2D Hubbard模型上验证其有效性。

We introduce a method for constructing global approximations to correlation functions of strongly interacting quantum field theories, starting from perturbative results. The key idea is to employ interpolation method, such as the two-point Padé expansion, to interpolate the weak and strong coupling expansions of correlation function. We benchmark this many-body interpolation approach on two prototypical models: the lattice $φ^4$ field theory and the 2D Hubbard model. For the $φ^4$ theory, the resulting two point Padé approximants exhibit uniform and global convergence to the exact correlation function. For the Hubbard model, we show that even at second order, the Padé appproximant already provides reasonable characterization of the Matsubara Green's function for a wide range of parameters. Finally, we offer a heuristic explanation for these convergence properties based on analytic function theory.

We develop a general multipolar theory of strong spin-orbit coupling for large total angular momentum $j$ in time-reversal-symmetric, noncentrosymmetric crystals. Using a $j\in\{1/2,3/2,5/2\}$ multiplet basis appropriate for heavy-element \textit{p}- and \textit{d}-bands, we systematically construct all symmetry-allowed spin-orbit coupling terms up to fifth order in momentum and generalize the usual spin texture to a total-angular-momentum texture. For $j&gt;1/2$, multipolar spin-orbit coupling qualitatively reshapes Fermi surfaces and makes the topology of Bloch states band dependent. This leads to anisotropic high-$j$ textures that go beyond a single Rashba helix. We classify these textures by their total-angular-momentum vorticity $W_{n}$ for every energy band and identify distinct $|W_{n}|=1,2,5$ phases. We show that their crossovers generate enhanced and nonmonotonic current-induced spin-polarization responses, namely the Edelstein effect, upon tuning the chemical potential. Our results provide a symmetry-based framework for analyzing and predicting multipolar spin-orbit coupling, total-angular-momentum textures, and spintronic responses in heavy-element materials without an inversion center.

Nonreciprocal active matter systems typically feature an asymmetric role among interacting agents, such as a pursuer-evader relationship. We propose a multi-species nonreciprocal active matter model that is invariant under permutations of the particle species. The nonreciprocal, yet symmetric, interactions emerge from a constant phase shift in the velocity alignment interactions, rather than from an asymmetric coupling matrix. This system possessing permutation symmetry displays rich collective behaviors, including a species-mixed chiral phase with quasi-long-range polar order and a species separation phase characterized by vortex cells. The system also displays a coexistence phase of the chiral and the species separation phases, in which intriguing dynamic patterns emerge. These rich collective behaviors are a consequence of the interplay between nonreciprocity and permutation symmetry.

Twistronics, which exploits moire modulation of lattice and electronic structures in twisted bilayers, has emerged as a powerful approach to engineer novel quantum states. Recent efforts have expanded beyond two dimensional van der Waals (vdWs) crystals to more complex, strongly correlated materials, where interfacial moire effects can dominate physical properties. Here we demonstrate a generalizable route to fabricate twisted bilayers of transition metal nitrides with vdWs like interfaces, using freestanding CrN membranes as a model system. Twisted bilayer CrN (tCrN) is realized by employing cubic alkaline earth metal monoxides as sacrificial layers, enabling the assembly of clean, controllable interfaces. Electron ptychography reveals well defined, periodic square moire superlattices in tCrN. For a twist angle of 16.3 degree, we identify a nearly commensurate moire lattice with coincident Cr columns, whereas at 45 degree we uncover localized octagonal quasicrystalline order with clear self-similarity. These results establish a practical platform for twisted TMNs and open avenues to explore moire-induced atomic configurations and emergent correlated phenomena in nitride based heterostructures.

Material scientists and condensed matter physicists have long been divided on the issue of choosing the conceptual framework for explaining why open-shell transition-metal oxides tend to be insulators, whereas otherwise successful theories such as DFT often predict them to be (false) metals. Strong correlation becomes the recommended medicine. We point out that strong correlation can be mitigated by allowing DFT to lower the energy by breaking structural, magnetic or dipolar symmetries. Such local motifs are observed experimentally by local probes beyond the 'average structure' determined by X-Ray diffraction. Observed broken symmetries can arise from slow fluctuations that persist over the observation time or longer. The surprising fact is that when symmetry breaking motifs are used as input to electronic structure calculations, false metals are converted into real insulators without the recommended medicine of strong correlation. Consistently, DFT calculations that show energy lowering symmetry breaking correct most cases where DFT, even with advanced exchange-correlation functionals, previously missed the correct metal vs insulator designation. Total energy calculations distinguish systems that support energy-lowering symmetry breaking from those that do not. This approach distinguishes between paramagnetic insulating and metallic phases and shows mass enhancement in Mott metals. The reason is that symmetry breaking removes many of the degeneracies that exist in a symmetry-unbroken system, reducing significantly the need for strong correlation. If one chooses to ignore symmetry breaking, the persistent degeneracies often call for strong correlation treatment. Thus, symmetry breaking transforms strong to normal correlation and false metals to true insulators. This view sheds light on the historic controversy between Mott and Slater that still reverberates today.

- **TL;DR**: 在铜基超导体上生长的单层WSe2形成特殊能带结构，这归因于界面小极化子的形成，由CuO2平面与WSe2之间的电荷转移驱动。

Understanding the electronic properties of doped copper-oxygen planes remains a significant challenge in condensed matter physics and is crucial to unraveling the mechanisms behind high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates. Recently, the observation of charge transfer and interfacial polarons in superconducting interface has aroused extensive research interest. However, experimental data to investigate charge transfer on the CuO2 plane and the presence of polarons are still missing. Here we conduct extensive research on the optical and electronic properties of two-dimensional material supported on copper-based superconductors. Unlike monolayer-WSe2 on other substrates, monolayer-WSe2 on La1.85Sr0.15CuO4 (WSe2/LSCO) produces a special band structure. Using high-resolution spectroscopic ellipsometry and density functional theory calculation methods, the special electronic structure can be attributed to the formation of the interfacial small polaron at the WSe2/LSCO interface which is driven by charge transfer between the CuO2 plane of the cuprate superconductor and WSe2. In addition, the structural phase transition of the LSCO substrate was observed to reduce the electron-hole (e-h) interaction of WSe2. These findings may spur future investigations on the effect of the interfacial polaron on the superconductivity of cuprates, and highlight the significant influence of interface effects on the electronic structure of WSe2 films. It provides an effective method to further explore the intrinsic relationship between interfacial polarons and superconductivity.

Nonadiabatic molecular dynamics is a key technique for investigating a broad range of photochemical and photophysical processes. Among the established approaches, surface hopping schemes are widely used and can be easily integrated with various quantum chemistry programs or machine learning models. We present a flexible framework in MLatom that includes a newly implemented Tully's fewest-switches surface hopping algorithm and its time-dependent Baeck--An variant. The capabilities of this framework are demonstrated through three representative examples corresponding to typical stages of a surface hopping study. First, we focus on methods providing energy, energy gradients and nonadiabatic couplings. We show that the flexibility of user-defined custom models can save computational time and that it is useful for benchmarking machine learning models. Next, we compare curvature-driven surface hopping schemes and show that Landau--Zener approach outperforms the time-dependent Baeck--An scheme. Finally, we showcase easy-to-use analysis tools for both individual trajectories and trajectory ensembles. This framework enables accelerated development of machine learning models and provides deeper insight into nonadiabatic dynamics. It is available as a part of the open-source MLatom package.

The classical $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$ Ising model on the honeycomb lattice is important for understanding frustrated magnetic phenomena in materials such as $FePS_3$ and $Ba_2CoTeO_6$, where diverse phases (e.g., striped, zigzag, armchair) and magnetization plateaus have been experimentally observed. To explain the experimental results, previous mean-field studies have explored its thermal phase transitions, identifying armchair phases and striped phases, but their limitations call for more reliable numerical investigations. In this work, we systematically revisit the classical $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$ Ising model using the Wang-Landau algorithm. We find that the armchair (AC) phase, previously reported in mean-field and experimental studies, actually coexists with the spiral (SP) phase, with their combined degeneracy reaching 20-fold (4-fold for the AC states and 16-fold for the spiral states). The phase transitions and critical exponents are studied at different interaction values. We observe first-order phase transitions, continuous phase transitions, and even the multipeak phenomenon, i.e., Schottky-like specific-heat anomalies in frustrated systems. These results clarify the nature of phases and phase transitions in frustrated Ising systems and their exponents, and additionally provide inspiration for experimental efforts to search for the spiral state and Schottky-like anomalies.

- **TL;DR**: Fe₄GeTe₂是一种准二维范德华铁磁体，具有高居里温度(~270K)和自旋重取向转变(~110K)。通过拉曼光谱研究，发现自旋-声子耦合在自旋重取向转变时显著增强，DFT+DMFT计算揭示了磁振子-声子相互作用的机制。

Quasi-2D van der Waals ferromagnet Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$, featuring the simultaneous presence of high Curie temperature ($T_\mathrm{C}$ $\sim 270$ K) and a spin-reorientation transition at $T_\mathrm{SR}$ $\sim 110$ K, is a rare system where strong interplay of spin dynamics, lattice vibrations, and electronic structure leads to a wide range of interesting phenomena. Here, we investigate the lattice response of exfoliated Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$ nanoflakes using temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy. Polarization-resolved measurements reveal that, while one Raman mode exhibits a purely out-of-plane character, the rest display mixed symmetry, reflecting interlayer vibrational nonuniformity and symmetry-driven mode degeneracies. Below $T_\mathrm{C}$, phonons harden, and the linewidth narrows, consistent with reduced anharmonicity, while across the spin reorientation transition at $T_\mathrm{SR}$ they display anomalous softening, linewidth broadening, and a peak in lifetime, which are signatures of strengthened spin-phonon coupling. Complementary DFT+DMFT calculations and atomistic spin dynamical simulations reveal temperature-dependent spin excitations whose energies overlap with the Raman-active phonons, providing a natural route for the observed magnon-phonon interaction. Together, these insights establish Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$ as a versatile platform for exploring intertwined spin, lattice, and electronic degrees of freedom, with relevance for dynamic spintronic and magneto-optic functionalities near technologically meaningful temperatures.

We investigate collective behavior in a $Q$-species Vicsek model with a nonreciprocal velocity alignment interaction. This system is characterized by a constant phase shift $α$ in the inter-species velocity alignment rule. While the phase shift renders the interaction nonreciprocal, the system is globally invariant under any permutations of particle species, possessing Potts symmetry. The combination of Potts symmetry and nonreciprocity gives rise to a rich phase diagram. The nonreciprocal phase shift generates either counter-clockwise or clockwise chirality. Potts symmetry can be broken spontaneously. Consequently, the system exhibits four distinct phases: A species-mixed chiral phase where particles perform counter-clockwise chiral motion with quasi-long-range order, a species separation phase where Potts symmetry is broken and species-separated particles form vortex cells with clockwise chirality, a coexistence phase, and a disordered phase. We derive a Boltzmann equation and a hydrodynamic equation describing the system in the continuum limit, and present analytic arguments for the emergence of chirality and species separation.

- **TL;DR**: 成功合成了Ni3InN反钙钛矿氮化物薄膜，揭示了其应变调控的费米液体行为和奇异金属输运特性，为研究过掺杂相关金属提供了新平台。

Antiperovskite nitrides (X3AN) are the structural analogues to perovskite oxides, while their epitaxial growth and electronic properties remain largely unexplored. We report the successful synthesis of Ni3InN thin films on substrates with different lattice constants. First-principles phonon calculations confirm the dynamical stability of cubic phase Ni3InN, providing the basis for epitaxial synthesis. High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy reveals coherent (001)-oriented interfaces when Ni3InN is grown on LaAlO3 and SrTiO3, while an unexpected (011)-orientation forms on DyScO3, aligning with surface-energy predictions. Transport measurements highlight a strain-controlled Fermi-liquid behavior, correlated with variations in the Ni-3d bandwidth and hybridization. Band structure calculations reveal a dual character near the Fermi level: a high-mobility Dirac-like band and a Ni-3d manifold that drives strange-metal transport with a reduced slope compared to oxide perovskites. The formal Ni valence (+2/3) places Ni3InN in an overdoped correlated-metal regime, distinguishing from most perovskite oxides. This positions antiperovskite nitrides as a promising platform for investigating overdoped Fermi liquids and strange-metal behavior.

Realizing non-volatile control of superconductivity is a key step toward integrating memory and quantum functionality in future information technologies. KTaO_3-based heterostructures uniquely host both interfacial two-dimensional superconductivity and a quantum paraelectric lattice background. The coupling between these two degrees of freedom potentially provides a promising route to encode memory directly into the superconducting state. Here, we reveal two intertwined phenomena in AlO_x/KTaO_3 heterostructures: a gate-history memory in which progressive electrostatic cycling enhances the superconducting transition temperature, and its complete erasure by light illumination at cryogenic temperatures. These phenomena arise from a previously unrecognized interplay between the superconducting interface and emergent lattice excitations - including polar-nanoregion reorientation and oxygen-vacancy ionization. These results demonstrate reconfigurable and non-volatile superconductivity at correlated oxide interfaces, opening a pathway to combine dissipationless transport with non-volatility for superconducting neuromorphic elements.

A DFT benchmark on water including more than 50 functionals from GGA to double-hybrid levels is reported. The main metric is the accuracy of forces, allowing better structural coverage, higher statistical confidence, and fewer error sources compared to conventional benchmarks. The input structures include water clusters of 4~128 molecules, with highly varied yet realistic configurations of water, ice, and their mixtures. The B97M-V, ωB97M-V, and revDOD-PBEP86-D4 functionals are found to be best on the mGGA, hybrid, and double-hybrid levels, respectively. No satisfying GGA functionals are found, but it can be obtained by combining BLYP-D4 with a simple correction to O-H bonds, achieving accuracy comparable to B97M-V.

### A Systematic Convergent Sequence of Approximations (of Integral Equation Form) to the Solutions of the Hedin Equations

In many ways the solution to the Hedin equations represents an exact solution to the many body problem. However, for most systems of practical interest, the solution to the Hedin equations is rendered nearly numerically intractable because the Hedin equations are of functional derivative form. Integral equations are much more numerically tractable, than functional derivative equations, as they can often be solved iteratively. In this work we present a systematic set of integral equations (with no functional derivatives) - Hedin approximations I, II, III, IV etc. - whose solutions converge to the solutions of the exact Hedin equations. The Hedin approximations are well suited to iterative numerical solutions (which we also describe). Furthermore Hedin approximation I is just the GW approximation (as such this work may be viewed as a systematic improvement of the GW approximation). We present a systematic study of the Hedin equations for zero dimensional field theory (which, in particular, is a method to enumerate Feynman diagrams for field theories in arbitrary dimensions) and show better and better convergence to the solutions of the Hedin equations for higher and higher Hedin approximations, with Hedin approximations I, II and III being explicitly studied. We, in particular, show that the higher Hedin approximations capture more and and more Feynman diagrams for the self energy. We also show that already Hedin approximation II captures more diagrams than the state of the art diagrammatic vertex corrections approach. Furthermore Hedin approximation III is a near perfect match to the exact solutions of the Hedin equations, at least in the zero dimensional case, and enumerates a large number of Feynman diagrams.

### Gyrotropic Fingerprints of Magnetic Topological Insulator-Unconventional Magnet Interfaces

- **TL;DR**: 提出基于Zeeman量子几何的框架，通过测量磁拓扑绝缘体与非常规磁绝缘体界面处的线性本征回旋磁响应，来识别非常规磁序的对称性指纹。

Unambiguously identifying unconventional magnetic orders requires probes that are directly sensitive to their momentum-dependent spin-split band structures. Here, we employ a framework based on Zeeman quantum geometry to study magnetotransport at the interface between a magnetic topological insulator and an unconventional magnetic insulator. By choosing the magnetic layer to be insulating, we ensure that the transport response originates solely from the proximity-induced magnetic exchange field, eliminating contributions from itinerant magnetic carriers. We focus on the linear intrinsic gyrotropic magnetic (IGM) response, which naturally decomposes into conduction and displacement current components governed by the Zeeman Berry curvature and the Zeeman quantum metric, respectively. We uncover a universal hierarchy in which the transverse displacement IGM response exhibits characteristic even-fold angular harmonics for magnetic orders ranging from $p$- to $i$-wave, while the longitudinal IGM response distinguishes the parity of the magnetic order through robust sign-reversal patterns. In contrast, the conduction IGM component remains largely insensitive to the underlying magnetic symmetry. Consequently, the displacement IGM current emerges as a high-fidelity symmetry fingerprint of unconventional magnetic order. Using realistic parameter estimates for experimentally accessible heterostructures, we demonstrate that these signatures are well within measurable ranges, establishing Zeeman quantum geometry as a powerful and general framework for characterizing unconventional magnetic insulators via their gyrotropic transport responses.

We investigate the interplay between nonreciprocal interactions and chemical-potential imbalance in a two-species nonreciprocal Blume-Capel model. Combining a systematic mean-field bifurcation analysis with large-scale Monte Carlo simulations in two and three dimensions, we map the model's dynamical regimes and transitions. Mean-field theory predicts a rich phase structure -- disorder, a time-dependent 'swap' (limit-cycle) phase, and static ordered states -- separated by Hopf, saddle-node on invariant circle, saddle-node of limit cycles, pitchfork and saddle-node bifurcations. In two dimensions, Monte Carlo simulations reveal that spiral defects destabilise global swapping and, unless vacancies are strongly favoured, destroy long-range order. Crucially, a finite single-ion anisotropy $Δ_α= - Δ_β$ promotes vacancy occupation in the $α$ species and suppresses nonreciprocal dynamics, thereby restoring a robust static ordered phase. Finite-size scaling of susceptibility and Binder cumulants places the disorder to static transition firmly in the 2D Ising universality class. Moreover, within the static ordered phase, we observe a crossover that sharpens into a line of first-order phase transitions; these two regimes are separated by a critical point, analogous to the termination of the liquid-gas coexistence curve. In three dimensions, simulations largely mirror mean-field expectations, though swap to static ordering occurs indirectly via a disordered regime. Our results demonstrate that vacancy energetics provide a simple, experimentally relevant control knob that stabilises equilibrium-like order in nonreciprocal systems and that defects can generate novel critical behaviour.

Crystal structure prediction is a fundamental problem in materials science. We present CrystalFormer-CSP, an efficient framework that unifies data-driven heuristic and physics-driven optimization approaches to predict stable crystal structures for given chemical compositions. The approach combines pretrained generative models for space-group-informed structure generation and a universal machine learning force field for energy minimization. Reinforcement fine-tuning can be employed to further boost the accuracy of the framework. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CrystalFormer-CSP on benchmark problems and showcase its usage via web interface and language model integration.

More than a century after discovery, the theory of conventional superconductivity remains incomplete. While the importance of electron-phonon coupling is understood, a controlled first-principles treatment of Coulomb interaction is lacking. Current ab initio calculations of superconductivity rely on a phenomenological downfolding approximation, replacing Coulomb interaction with a repulsive pseudopotential μ*, and leaving ambiguities in electron-phonon coupling with dynamical Coulomb interactions unresolved. We address this via an effective field theory approach, integrating out high-energy electronic degrees of freedom using variational Diagrammatic Monte Carlo. Applied to the uniform electron gas, this establishes a microscopic procedure to implement downfolding, define the pseudopotential, and express dynamical Coulomb effects on electron-phonon coupling via the electron vertex function. We find the bare pseudopotential significantly larger than conventional values. This yields improved pseudopotential estimates in simple metals and tests density functional perturbation theory accuracy for effective electron-phonon coupling. We present an ab initio workflow computing superconducting Tc from the anomalous vertex's precursory Cooper flow. This infers Tc from normal state calculations, enabling reliable estimates of very low Tc (including near quantum phase transitions) beyond conventional reach. Validating our approach on simple metals without empirical tuning, we resolve long-standing discrepancies and predict a pressure-induced transition in Al from superconducting to non-superconducting above ~60GPa. We propose ambient-pressure Mg and Na are proximal to a similar critical point. Our work establishes a controlled ab initio framework for electron-phonon superconductivity beyond the weak-correlation limit, paving the way for reliable Tc calculations and novel material design.

Quantum spin liquids (QSLs) host exotic fractionalized magnetic and gauge-field excitations whose microscopic origins and experimental verification remain frustratingly elusive. In the absence of static magnetic order, the spin excitation spectrum constitutes the crucial probe of QSL behavior, but its theoretical computation remains a serious challenge. Here we employ state-of-the-art tensor-network methods to obtain the full dynamical spectral function of the $J_1$-$J_2$ kagome Heisenberg model and benchmark our results by tracking their evolution across the magnetically ordered and QSL phases. Reducing $|J_2|/J_1$ causes increasingly strong spin-wave renormalization, flattening these modes then merging them into a continuum characteristic of deconfined spinons at all finite energies in the QSL. The low-energy continuum and the occurrence of gap closure at multiple high-symmetry points identify this gapless QSL as the U(1) Dirac spin liquid. These results establish a unified understanding of spin excitations in highly frustrated quantum magnets and provide clear spectral fingerprints for experimental detection in candidate kagome QSL materials.

Open-shell nanographenes offer a controlled setting to study correlated magnetism emerging from $π$-electron systems. We analyze oligo(indenoindene) molecules, non-bipartite carbon ladders whose tight-binding spectra feature a gapped, weakly dispersing manifold of quasi-zero modes, and show that their low-energy properties can be effectively mapped onto an interacting set of spin-1/2 degrees of freedom. Using Density Matrix Renormalization Group simulations of the full Fermi-Hubbard model, we obtain their excitation spectra, entanglement profiles, and spin-spin correlations. We then construct optimized delocalized fermionic modes that act as emergent spins and show that their interactions are well described by a frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg chain. This effective description clarifies how spin degrees of freedom arise and interact in non-bipartite nanographene ladders, providing a compact and accurate representation of their correlated behavior.

We introduce replica Markov processes to derive thermodynamic trade-off relations for nonlinear functions of probability distributions. In conventional thermodynamic trade-off relations, the quantities of interest are linear in the underlying probability distribution. Some important information-theoretic quantities, such as Rényi entropies, are nonlinear; however, such nonlinearities are generally more difficult to handle. Inspired by replica techniques used in quantum information and spin-glass theory, we construct Markovian dynamics of identical replicas and derive a lower bound on relative moments in terms of the dynamical activity. We apply our general result to two scenarios. First, for a random walker on a network, we derive an upper bound on the Rényi entropy of the position distribution of the walker, which quantifies the extent of diffusion on the network. Remarkably, the bound is expressed solely in terms of escape rate from the initial node, and thus depends only on local information. Second, we consider trajectory observables in Markov processes and obtain an upper bound on the Rényi entropy of the distribution of these observables, again in terms of the dynamical activity. This provides an entropic characterization of uncertainty that generalizes existing variance-based thermodynamic uncertainty relations.

Magnetic refrigeration presents an energy-efficient and environmentally benign alternative to traditional vapour-compression cooling technologies. It relies on the magnetocaloric effect, in which the temperature of a magnetic material changes in response to variations in an applied magnetic field. Optimal magnetocaloric materials are characterized by a significant change in magnetic entropy under moderate magnetic field. In this study, we systematically investigated the inter-atomic exchange interactions, magnetic anisotropy energy and magnetocaloric properties of MnX (X = N, P, As, Sb, Bi) using a combination of density functional theory and Monte-Carlo simulations. Additionally, the magneto-optical Kerr and Faraday spectra were computed using the all-electron, fully relativistic, full-potential linearized muffin-tin orbital method. The largest Kerr effect observed in MnBi can be inferred as a combined effect of maximal exchange splitting of Mn 3d states and the large spin-orbit coupling of Bi. To extract site-projected spin and orbital moments, spin-orbit coupling and orbital polarization correction are accounted in the present calculation, which shows good agreement between the moment obtained from the X-ray magnetic circular dichroism sum rule analysis, spin-polarized calculation, and experimental studies. The magnetic transition temperatures predicted through Monte-Carlo simulations were in good agreement with the corresponding experimental values. Our results provide a unified microscopic understanding of magnetocaloric performance and magneto-optical activity in Mn-based pnictides and establish a reliable computational framework for designing next-generation magnetic refrigeration materials.

Motivated by recent reports of ambient-pressure superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ films grown on LaSrAlO$_4$, we investigate the superconducting instability in a one-unit cell thin film using {\it ab initio} and random-phase approximation techniques. Compared to the high-pressure bulk system, the ratio of inter-layer $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ hopping to intra-layer $d_{x^2-y^2}$ hopping is suppressed in the 1UC thin film, and the crystal-field splitting of the $e_g$ orbitals is increased. Our calculation indicates that spin-fluctuation-driven pairing correlations are weak for the stoichiometric case at ambient pressure, but increase significantly under hole doping. The leading pairing symmetry is also found to change by hole doping. Specifically, we obtain a leading $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairing state at moderate hole doping, followed by a $d_{xy}$ state at higher doping. These states are driven by intra-band spin-fluctuation scattering {\it within} the $γ$ hole pocket centered around the M point, and arise primarily from states in the Ni layer {\it farther} from the substrate. These results strongly suggest that the thin-film superconducting samples are hole-doped and that pairing in this system predominantly arises in the layer, as opposed to the inter-layer pairing in the pressurized bulk system.

Water's ability to self-dissociate into H$_3$O$^+$ and OH$^-$ ions is central to acid-base chemistry and bioenergetics. Recent experimental advances have enabled the confinement of water down to the nanometre scale, even to the single-molecule limit, yet how this process is altered at the extreme nanoconfinement remains unclear. Using \emph{ab-initio} calculations and enhanced-sampling machine-learning potential molecular dynamics, we show that monolayer-confined water exhibits a markedly lower barrier to auto-dissociation than bulk water. Confinement restructures both intramolecular bonding and the intermolecular hydrogen-bond network, while enforcing quasi-2D dipolar correlations that amplify dielectric fluctuations. Our results imply that two-dimensional confined water could act as a \emph{superdielectric} medium and may exhibit \emph{superionic} behavior, as observed in recent experiments. These findings reveal confinement as a powerful route to enhanced proton activity, shedding light on geochemical niches, biomolecular environments, and nanofluidic systems where water's chemistry is fundamentally reshaped.

However, with increasing field, this non-Fermi-liquid (NFL) behavior of $χ(T) $ at low temperatures is suppressed. Moreover, a susceptibility maximum occurs below 4 T, whereas Fermi-liquid coherence is recovered above 8 T. In addition, thermodynamic anomalies ($T_{\rm A}$ and $H_{\rm A}$) occur in both magnetic susceptibility and specific heat at intermediate fields (6--10 T) along the [111] direction. Furthermore, a nontrivial fifth-order nonlinear susceptibility is observed in the normal-state magnetization of UBe$_{13}$. These results suggest a close relationship between the field-induced multipolar correlations of $5f$-electron degrees of freedom and the Fermi-surface reconstruction accompanying the crossover from the NFL state to the Fermi-liquid state in UBe$_{13}$.

We study a system of self-propelled particles whose alignment with neighbors depends on the degree of local alignment. We show that such a local conformity interaction naturally yields a Vicsek-type model with pairwise and three-body interactions. Through numerical and approximate theoretical investigation of its deterministic and stochastic collective dynamics, we identify a novel bidirectionally ordered phase in which the particles move in opposite directions. Moreover, both continuous and discontinuous order-disorder transitions are observed, suggesting that the system belongs to a different universality class from previous models.

We investigate the influence of magnetic order on the proximity-induced superconducting state in the Mn layers of a Mn-Nb(110) heterostructure by using a first-principles method. For this study, we use the recently developed Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) solver for superconducting heterostructures [Csire et al., Phys. Rev. B 97, 024514 (2018)] within the first-principles calculations based on multiple scattering theory and the screened Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker (SKKR) Green's function method. In our calculations, we first study the normal-state density of states (DOS) in the single- and double-Mn-layer heterostructures, and calculate the induced magnetic moments in the Nb layers. Next, we compute the momentum-resolved spectral functions in the superconducting state for the heterostructure with a single Mn layer, and find bands crossing the Fermi level within the superconducting (SC) gap. We also study the SC state DOS in the single- and double-Mn-layer heterostructures and compare some of our results with experimental findings, revealing secondary gaps, plateau-like regions, and central V-shaped in-gap states within the bulk SC Nb gap that are magnetic-order-dependent. Finally, we compute the singlet and internally antisymmetric triplet (IAT) order parameters for each layer for both heterostructures, and find an order of magnitude difference in the induced singlet part of the SC order parameter in the Mn layer/s between the FM and AFM cases in favor of the AFM pairing with the maximum still being only 4.44% of the bulk Nb singlet order parameter value. We also find a negligible induced triplet part, yet comparable to the induced singlet values, indicating some singlet-triplet mixing in the Mn layer/s.

In this work, diopside (CaMgSi2O6) was doped with fluoride at a level of 1 mol.%, without the formation of any second phase, by a wet chemical precipitation method. The sintered structure of the synthesized nanopowders was studied by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and field-emission scanning electron microscopy. Also, the samples' in vitro apatite-forming ability in a simulated body fluid was comparatively evaluated by electron microscopy, inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. According to the results, the material's sinterability was improved by fluoride doping, as realized from the further development of sintering necks. It was also found that compared to the undoped bioceramic, a higher amount of apatite was deposited on the surface of the doped sample. It is concluded that fluoride can be considered as a doping agent in magnesium-containing silicates to improve biological, particularly bioactivity, behaviors.

We investigate the physical properties of elementary magnon excitations of the ordered antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the honeycomb lattice using quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations, series expansions (SE), and continuous similarity transformations (CST). The stochastic analytic continuation method is used to determine the dynamic structure factor from correlation functions in imaginary time obtained by QMC. In contrast to the "roton minimum" of the square lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet, we find that magnons on the honeycomb lattice completely decay in the corner of the Brillouin zone ($K$-point); the entire weight is shifted into the continuum. These findings are fully supported by SE and CST in momentum space. The extrapolated one-magnon dispersion obtained from SE about the Ising limit quantitatively agrees with the extracted QMC excitation energies except around the $K$-point, where large uncertainties in the extrapolation indicate the magnon decay. This quantum decay is further confirmed and understood by the CST, which yields a divergent flow when enforcing a magnon quasi-particle picture. The divergence originates from strong attractive magnon-magnon interactions leading to a bound state and thereby to a three-magnon continuum overlapping with the one-magnon state. This has the magnon quasi-particle picture break down at high energies on the honeycomb lattice.

### Migration of gold atoms into a thiol-bonded molecular self-assembled monolayer, forming a cluster exhibiting a Coulomb staircase

- **TL;DR**: 研究发现金表面硫醇自组装单分子层在光照下会自发形成金纳米颗粒，导致单电子隧穿现象，而胺基锚定剂可避免此问题，为分子电子器件可靠性提供新思路。

Thiol-based self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) on gold surfaces are one of the fundamental building blocks of molecular electronics. The strong chemical affinity of the gold and sulfur (Au-S) enables the formation of close-packed SAMs, but it also has recently been found to create a dynamic interface where surface reconstruction can occur under illumination, even with ambient light. This reconstruction may facilitate migration of gold atoms, potentially leading to in-situ formation of gold clusters. However, research on this mechanism often centers on Au(111) crystalline surfaces and flicker-noise measurements. Electron transport in ensembles of molecules in lithographically defined junctions has remained largely unexplored at cryogenic temperatures. In this study, we observe single-electron phenomena characterized by reproducible Coulomb staircases across various long-chain alkanethiol SAMs, which fit the Coulomb-blockade theory of nm-sized metallic nanoparticles. We find no such current steps in samples with amine, rather than thiol, anchors. Additionally, we find that by adding a bipyridyl functional group, these phenomena can be harnessed for memristive switching and negative differential resistance. These findings indicate that the generally observed lack of reliability and reproducibility of molecular devices may be alleviated by using amine anchors instead of thiols to avoid nanoparticle effects. Conversely, the spontaneous formation of the nanoparticles could potentially be controlled and used to achieve useful functionalities, offering new pathways for designing multifunctional nanoelectronic components.

The theoretical understanding of pattern formation in active systems remains a central problem of interest. Heterogeneous flocks made up of multiple species can exhibit a remarkable diversity of collective states that cannot be obtained from single-species models. In this paper, we derive a kinetic theory for multi-species systems of self-propelled particles with (anti-)alignment interactions. We summarize the numerical results for the binary system before employing linear stability analysis on the coarse-grained system. We find good agreement between theoretical predictions and particle simulations, and our kinetic theory is able to capture the correct lengthscale in the emergent coexistence phases through a Turing-Hopf instability. Extending the kinetic framework to multi-species systems with cyclic alignment interactions, we recover precisely the same emergent ordering as corresponding simulations of the microscopic model. More generally, our kinetic theory provides an extensible framework for analyzing pattern formation and collective order in multi-species active matter systems.

The foundations of irradiation damage theory were laid in the 1950s and 60s within the framework of chemical reaction kinetics. While helpful to analyze qualitative aspects of irradiation damage, the theory contained gaps that delayed its implementation and applicability as a predictive tool. The advent of computer simulations with atomistic resolution in the 80s and 90s revealed a series of mechanisms that have proved essential to understand key aspects of irradiation damage in crystalline solids. However, we still lack a comprehensive model that can connect atomic-level defect physics with experimental measurements of quantitative features of the irradiated microstructure. In this work we present a mesoscale model that draws from our improved understanding of irradiation damage processes collected over the last few decades, bridging knowledge gained from our most sophisticated atomistic simulations with defect kinetics taking place over time scales many orders of magnitude larger than atomic interaction times. Importantly, the model contains no adjustable parameters, and combines several essential pieces of irradiation damage physics, each playing an irreplaceable role in the context of the full model, but of limited utility if considered in isolation. Crucially, we carry out a set of experiments carefully designed to isolate the key irradiation damage variables and facilitate validation. Using tungsten as a model material, we find exceptionally good agreement between our numerical predictions and experimental measurements of defect densities and defect cluster sizes.

### Quantum Altermagnetic Instability in Disordered Metals

The possibility of a zero temperature, altermagnetic instability in anisotropic two dimensional electron systems in the diffusive regime is analyzed, in the presence and absence of spin-orbit coupling. Allowing for ferromagnetism, a phase diagram is built as a function of the parameter that controls anisotropy and the strength of the interactions. It is found that, at zero spin orbit coupling, ferromagnetism only dominates at small values of anisotropy and coupling constant. Larger values of these parameters favour the formation of altermagnetism. At finite spin-orbit coupling, a paramagnetic phase competes with the other two, and a quantum critical point appears. The phase transition from the paramagnetic to the magnetically ordered phases is of second order, while the phase transition between ferromagnet and altermagnet states is first order. The altermagnetic phase is robust under small magnetic fields, displaying a coexistence with a field-induced magnetization.

The superconducting diode effect (SDE) has recently been observed in various systems, sparking interest in novel superconducting devices and offering a new platform to probe intrinsic material properties. Josephson junctions with strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling have exhibited nonreciprocal critical currents under applied magnetic fields. In this work, we investigate the SDE in Josephson junctions incorporating periodic hole arrays patterned into the superconducting leads on InAs heterostructures with epitaxial aluminum. We observe an enhanced diode effect when a top gate depletes the 2DEG in the region of the hole arrays, while preserving the overall supercurrent. Theoretical analysis shows that the physics behind this phenomenon is the increased difference of transparency between different bands in the junction. These results highlight a new pathway for engineering and controlling nonreciprocal superconducting transport in hybrid systems.

We study boundary critical behavior at the Nishimori multicritical point of the two-dimensional (2D) random-bond Ising model. Using tensor-network methods, we realize a one-parameter family of microscopic boundary conditions by continuously rotating the boundary-spin orientation and find two conformal boundary fixed points that correspond to the free and fixed boundaries. We extract conformal data, including the boundary entropies and the scaling dimensions of boundary primary operators, which characterize the boundary universality class. We further demonstrate that the free boundary fixed point exhibits multifractal scaling of boundary spin fields. Finally, we complement our numerical results with a renormalization group analysis and discuss a systematic bridge between the controlled $6-ε$ expansion and the 2D tensor network numerics.

### First-principles study of magnetic and spin-dependent transport properties of Mn2VZ (Z = Al, Ga) with negative spin polarization using a disordered local moment approach at finite temperatures

First-principles studies were performed on two Mn-based ferrimagnetic Heusler compounds with L21 and B2 structures, that is, Mn2VZ (Z = Al or Ga). The aim was to investigate their magnetic properties, electronic structures, and spin-resolved longitudinal conductivity at finite temperatures. Density functional theory (DFT) and functional integral theory were used. This approach incorporates transverse spin fluctuations through a disordered local moment method and the coherent potential approximation. In all cases, the calculated theoretical Curie temperatures were lower than the experimental values. Alloys with a B2 structures exhibit higher Curie temperatures compared to compounds with an L21 structures. Calculations of the temperature dependence of the density of states (DOS) indicate that the half-metallic electronic structure collapses owing to the renormalization of transverse spin fluctuations at a finite temperatures. However, the spin-resolved longitudinal conductivities demonstrated an improved spin polarization, particularly for Mn2VGa with an L21 structure. This result contradicts predictions based on the temperature-dependent DOS. The competition between the metallic transitions, which are caused by a modification of the DOS, and scattering coming from spin-disorder explains this phenomenon. Both of these effects are induced by transverse spin fluctuations. Additionally, the results show that half-metallicity, as defined by the DOS or conductivity, is inconsistent at finite temperatures. Finally, the total energy landscape of the paramagnetic state was calculated using the fixed spin moment method to investigate the strength of the longitudinal spin fluctuations. These results suggest that the alloys may exhibit strong longitudinal spin fluctuations.

This study aims to evaluate the optoelectronic properties of metal free porphyrin-based D-$π$-A dyes via in-silico performance investigation notifying energy informatics and decision support. To develop novel organic dyes, three acceptor/anchoring groups and five donating groups were introduced to strategic positions of the base porphyrin structure, resulting in a total of fifteen dyes. The singlet ground state geometries of the dyes were optimized utilizing density functional theory (DFT) with B3LYP and the excited state optical properties were explored through time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) using the PCM model with tetrahydrofuran (THF) as solvent. Both DFT and TD-DFT calculations were carried out using the 6-311G(d,p) basis set. The HOMO energy levels of almost all the modified dyes are lower than the redox potential of I$^-$/I$3^-$ and LUMO energy levels are higher than the conduction band of TiO$2$. The absorption maxima values ranged from 690.64 to 975.55 nm. The dye N1 using triphenylamine group as donor and p-ethynylbenzoic acid group as acceptor, showed optimum optoelectronic properties ($ΔG{reg}=-9.73$ eV, $ΔG{inj}=7.18$ eV, $V_{OC}=1.47$ V and $J_{SC}=15.03$ mA/cm$^2$) with highest PCE 14.37%, making it the best studied dye. This newly modified organic dye with enhanced PCE is remarkably effective for the dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC) industry. Beyond materials discovery, this study highlights the role of high-performance computing in enabling predictive screening of dye candidates and generating performance indicators (HOMO-LUMO gaps, absorption spectra, charge transfer free energies, photovoltaic metrics). These outputs can serve as key parameters for energy informatics and system modelling.

### Measuring the Hall effect in hysteretic materials

- **TL;DR**: 该论文提出了在磁滞材料中正确提取霍尔响应的两种方法，解决了传统反对称化处理在不可逆系统中产生伪信号的问题。

Measurement of the Hall effect is a ubiquitous probe for materials discovery, characterization, and metrology. Inherent to the Hall measurement geometry, the measured signal is often contaminated by unwanted contributions, so the data must be processed to isolate the Hall response. The standard approach invokes Onsager-Casimir reciprocity and antisymmetrizes the raw signal about zero applied magnetic field. In hysteretic materials this becomes nontrivial, since Onsager-Casimir relations apply only to microscopically reversible states. Incorrect antisymmetrization can lead to artifacts that mimic anomalous or topological Hall signatures. The situation is especially subtle when hysteresis loops are not centered at zero applied field, as in exchange-biased systems. A practical reference for generically extracting the Hall response in hysteretic materials is lacking. Here, using Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ as a bulk single-crystal model that can be prepared with or without exchange-biased hysteresis, we demonstrate two procedures that can be used to extract the Hall effect: (1) reverse-magnetic-field reciprocity and (2) antisymmetrization with respect to applied field. We then measure the Hall effect on CeCoGe$_3$, a noncentrosymmetric antiferromagnet which can be prepared to have asymmetric magnetization and magnetoresistance, and demonstrate how improper processing can generate artificial anomalous Hall signals. These methods are generic and can be applied to any conductor.

- **TL;DR**: 硅中通过近红外圆偏振光在室温下诱导出异常霍尔电导，其机制被证明是逆轨道霍尔效应而非自旋极化，为硅基轨道电子学开辟道路

We investigated the anomalous Hall conductivity induced in silicon by circularly polarized light at room temperature using near-infrared (NIR) pump-terahertz (THz) probe spectroscopy. The time-resolved detection scheme eliminates the large nonlinear current generated by the field-induced circular photogalvanic effect, allowing exclusive observation of a long-lived anomalous Hall conductivity of photocarriers that depends on the helicity of NIR light. The magnitude of this conductivity is comparable to that of GaAs despite silicon's much weaker spin-orbit coupling, and its robustness against NIR photon energy rules out a spin-polarization-based origin, which occurs only in the vicinity of the bandgap. These results suggest the emergence of the inverse orbital Hall effect, paving the way for silicon-based orbitronics.

Chemical and biological networks can describe a wide variety of processes, from gene regulatory networks to biochemical oscillations. Modeled by chemical master equations, these processes are inherently stochastic, as fluctuations dominate deterministic order at mesoscopic scales. These classic many-body processes suffer from the so-called curse of high dimensionality, which makes exact mathematical descriptions exponentially expensive to compute. The exponential cost renders the study of the thermodynamic properties of such systems out of equilibrium intractable and forces approximations of system noise or assumptions of continuous particle numbers. Here, we use tensor networks to numerically explore the thermodynamics of chemical processes by directly solving the ensemble solution of the chemical master equation with efficient (sub-exponential) computational cost. We provide accurate estimates of the entropy production rate, heat flux, chemical work, and nonequilibrium thermodynamic potentials, free from sampling errors or mean-field approximations. We illustrate our results through a dissipative self-assembly model. In this way, we show how tensor networks can inform the design of efficient chemical processes in previously unattainable regimes.

Thin amorphous-CoFeB (a-CFB) is deposited by rf-magnetron sputtering on a self-oxidized Si (100) substrate with different film thicknesses ranging from 0.7 nm to 20 nm. The 5-nm-thick a-CFB film is capped with a W layer for comparison. The surface morphology is investigated by using the atomic force microscopy technique. The low roughness of all the surface of the film indicates uniformity, moderate corrosion resistance, and good structural quality. The X-ray diffraction spectra reveal the amorphous nature of the CFB layer, while the W capping is of mixed phase in the experimental thickness regime. In-plane and out-of-plane hysteresis loops obtained from the vibrating sample magnetometry technique show a transition from an upright S to nearly rectangular shape via a completely inverted profile. A self-sustained tilted magnetic anisotropy is stabilized in a seed-free environment based on the direct substrate-to-magnet interaction. The interface anisotropy is estimated to be 0.06 erg/cm2. The complex anisotropic behavior originates from the interplay between interface anisotropy, conventional shape anisotropy, growth-induced anisotropies, and inhomogeneity-induced anisotropies. In essence, effective anisotropy is responsible for the anomalous hysteresis behavior observed in these films, and this work might provide valuable insights to improve the functionalities of amorphous soft magnetic alloys.

In planar chiral magnets, the competition of the positive definite Heisenberg exchange and Zeeman energies with the indefinite Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) energy allows for the possibility of negative energy ground states, and leads to an intricate dependence of the ground states on the parameters of the theory. In this paper, we consider arbitrary spiralization tensors for the DMI interaction and arbitrary directions for the external magnetic field, and study the nature of the ground states in this parameter space, using a combination of analytical and numerical methods. Classifying ground states by their symmetry into ferromagnetic (invariant under under arbitrary translations in the plane), spiral (invariant under arbitrary translations in one direction) and skyrmion lattice ground states (invariant under a two dimensional lattice group), we give a complete description of the phase diagram of this class of theories.

Skyrmions are highly stable chiral magnetic spin textures with non-trivial topology. They can act as quasi-particles that can be generated, manipulated and annihilated, and hold promise for future memory and logic devices. As of now, all-optical stochastic nucleation of skyrmion ensembles, mostly in small applied magnetic fields, has been shown. However, to research their true potential, the ability to selectively toggle switch individual single skyrmions would be highly beneficial. In this paper, we demonstrate the field-free optical control of single stable skyrmions via single femtosecond laser pulses with diameters down to 175 nm, containing a fixed chirality. By engineering ferrimagnetic Co/Gd-based multilayers, we resolve the competition between deterministic and stochastic processes, and thereby overcome the challenge of optically writing and annihilating sub-micron skyrmions on demand. Our work is envisioned to fuel applications of skyrmion-based applications and opens up further endeavors in research related to the behaviour of more complicated skyrmion-based textures.

Many physical processes depend on the time it takes a diffusing particle to find a target. Though this classical quantity is now well-understood in various scenarios, little is known if the diffusivity depends on the location of the particle. For such heterogeneous diffusion, an ambiguity arises in interpreting the stochastic process, which reflects the well-known Itô versus Stratonovich controversy. Here we analytically determine the mean escape time and splitting probabilities for an arbitrary heterogeneous diffusion in an arbitrary three-dimensional domain with small targets that can be perfectly or imperfectly absorbing. Our analysis reveals general principles for how search depends on heterogeneous diffusion and its interpretation (e.g. Itô, Stratonovich, or kinetic). An intricate picture emerges in which, for instance, increasing the diffusivity can decrease, not affect, or even increase the escape time. Our results could be used to determine the appropriate interpretation for specific physical systems.

Quasicrystals, structures that are ordered yet aperiodic, defy conventional band theory, confining most studies to finite-size real-space numerics. We overcome this limitation with a configuration-space framework that predicts and explains the positions and origins of energy gaps in quasicrystalline potentials. We find that a hierarchy of gaps stems from resonant hybridization between increasingly distant neighboring sites, pinning the integrated density of states below these gaps to specific irrational areas in configuration space. Large-scale simulations of a lowest-band tight-binding model built from localized Wannier functions show excellent agreement with these predictions. By moving beyond finite-size numerics, this study advances the understanding of quasicrystalline potentials, paving the way for new explorations of their quantum properties in the infinite-size limit.

- **TL;DR**: 二维相干光谱（2DCS）可区分激子与晶格驱动的有序相，在Ta₂NiSe₅模型中，激子区2DCS信号被凝聚体的振幅模和相位模显著增强，而单粒子贡献可忽略；随着电声耦合增强，振幅模贡献先保持稳定后急剧下降。

We show that the nonlinear optical response probed by two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS) can discriminate between excitonic and lattice driven order. In the excitonic regime of a realistic model of Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$, the third order 2DCS signals are strongly enhanced by the condensate's amplitude and phase modes, with negligible contributions from single-particle excitations. In the linear optical response, in contrast, single-particle and collective-mode contributions overlap. With increasing electron-phonon coupling, the amplitude mode contribution to 2DCS initially remains robust, but then drops rapidly and remains small in the phonon-dominated regime -- even in systems with large order parameter. 2DCS also aids the detection of the massive relative phase mode, which is analogous to the Leggett mode in superconductors. Our analysis, based on the time-dependent Hartree-Fock approach, demonstrates that 2DCS can track the emergence of the symmetry-broken state and the crossover from Coulomb-driven to phonon-driven order.

Uranium dioxide, UO$_2$, is a canonical example of a magnetic material with strong spin-orbit coupling. Here, we present a study of the magnetic diffuse scattering measured on a polycrystalline sample of UO$_2$, which we interpret in terms of its magnetic interactions between U$^{4+}$ magnetic moments. By refining values of the magnetic interaction parameters to magnetic diffuse-scattering data measured above the magnetic ordering transition temperature, we show that the dominant magnetic coupling in UO$_2$ is a bond-dependent interaction analogous to the Kitaev model of honeycomb magnets. We compare our experimental results with published theoretical predictions and experimental measurements of the magnetic excitation spectrum. Our results suggest that magnetic materials with $f$-electron magnetic ions, particularly actinides, may be promising candidates for realising Kitaev magnetism, and highlight the role that magnetic diffuse-scattering data can play in identifying such materials.

We present a theory of resonance fluorescence (RF) of a solid-state quantum emitter in the regime of weak optical excitation. The emitter is coupled to phonon modes of the surrounding bulk semiconductor, described by a super-Ohmic spectral density. We show that the RF spectrum of this system consists of a central elastic line, a broad phonon sideband known from other linear and nonlinear spectra of such systems, as well as a narrow inelastic contribution, which is characteristic of scattering spectra and stems from noise-induced transient dynamics. At moderate phonon couplings or low temperatures, the interplay between the broad sideband and the inelastic feature leads to a Fano-like profile near the resonant energy with the Fano parameter determined by laser detuning. In the weak-coupling limit (where only single-phonon processes are included), the spectrum becomes an exact Fano shape and resonant light scattering is entirely suppressed. The amplitude of this spectral feature grows linearly with temperature, while its width depends solely on the spontaneous emission rate of the emitter. We relate the quantum character of the reservoir to the non-commutativity of noise observables and show that Fano resonance persists in the classical limit. We also discuss how the redistribution of optical coupling efficiency between the central line and the sidebands affects the total scattering rate under various excitation conditions.

The emergence of the orbital degree of freedom in modern orbitronics offers a promising alternative to heavy metals for the efficient control of magnetization. In this context, identifying interfaces that exhibit orbital-momentum locking and an orbital Rashba-Edelstein response to an external electric field is of primary importance. In this work, we experimentally investigate the Co/Al system and extend the study to Co/Pt/Al structures. We show that inserting ultrathin Pt layers between Co and Al can significantly modify the orbital properties, highlighting the critical role of Co/Al orbital bonding in generating orbital polarization. We further model the orbital response of these systems using semi-phenomenological approaches and linear-response theory within the framework of density-functional theory.

- **TL;DR**: 研究人员通过在硅鳍式场效应晶体管中向不同栅极施加微波信号，实现了对空穴自旋量子比特主要EDSR驱动机制的原位控制，可以在g因子调制和波函数位移两种机制之间切换。

Hole-spin qubits enable fast, all-electrical spin manipulation through electric-dipole spin resonance (EDSR), arising from two microscopic mechanisms rooted in their intrinsically strong spin-orbit interaction. Depending on how the electric field acts on the quantum dot, the spin can be driven either by a modulation of its g-factor or by a displacement of the wavefunction. Here, we demonstrate in-situ control over the dominant EDSR driving mechanism of a hole-spin qubit in a silicon fin field-effect transistor by applying microwave signals to two different gate electrodes, thereby tuning the orientation of the local electric field. We measure the effective g-factor, its electrical tunability, and the Rabi frequency as functions of magnetic-field orientation. Their distinct angular dependencies, analyzed using a g-matrix formalism, allow us to identify the underlying driving processes and track their relative contributions for different drive configurations. By selecting the drive electrode, we can switch from a regime dominated by g-factor modulation to one with a strong contribution from wavefunction displacement. This in-situ tunability provides direct experimental access to both spin-driving mechanisms and offers a route toward optimized spin-qubit performance.

We synthezised an AlZnMgCu alloy through mechanical alloying and, using Xray diffraction (XRD), identified the formation of the eta prime phase after 40 hours of grinding. Using reaction-free isoconversion theory, we determined that this phase exhibits two different behaviours depending on the heating rate (beta): the eta prime phase at low beta and the eta phase at high beta.The activation energy values at low beta are consistent with the diffusion energies of copper, zinc and magnesium in aluminium. Significant qualitative and quantitative differences in the thermodynamic barriers (Delta H, Delta G and Delta S) are observed for beta values above or below 20 deg C min minus 1.

Here, we elaborate on and develop the geometrical approach introduced in K. Le Hur, Physics Reports 1104 1-42 (2025) between the magnetic monopole created from a radial field, quantum physics and topological lattice models through quantum phase transitions. We introduce an effective magnetic moment for a monopole when applying an additional source field along z-direction which also mediates the quantum phase transition. We present its relation with the transverse pumped quantum Hall current. The magnetic susceptibility can be introduced as a measure of the topological invariant i.e. remains quantized within the topological phase until the transition. We show the relation with two-dimensional topological lattice models such as a honeycomb Haldane model in real space. We develop the theory and present a numerical analysis between local invariants in momentum space introduced from Dirac points, correlation functions and the responses to circularly polarized light. We develop the formalism for coupled-planes materials including the possibility of quantum spin Hall effect and address a relation between the Ramanujan infinite alternating series and an interface in real space with a topological number one-half.

Using a combination of band representation analysis, inelastic neutron scattering (INS), magneto-Raman spectroscopy measurements, and linear spin wave theory, we establish that the non-coplanar antiferromagnet MnTe$_2$ hosts symmetry-protected topological nodal lines, Weyl points, and a three-fold degeneracy in its magnon band structure. The non-coplanar nature of the antiferromagnetic ordering protects the topological magnon nodal lines that transition into Weyl magnons upon the application of specific symmetry-breaking perturbations using an external magnetic field. Zero-field INS measurements confirm the existence of the topological magnon nodal lines through the pseudo-spin winding of the scattering intensity in angular scans near the nodal lines, indicating the non-trivial topology of the magnon wavefunctions. This work establishes a clear magnonic analog to Weyl electrons, allowing further exploration of topological behavior in bosonic systems, and highlighting the rich interplay between magnetic order and band topology in non-coplanar antiferromagnets.

In Si quantum dot systems, large magnetic field gradients are needed to implement spin rotations via electric dipole spin resonance (EDSR). By increasing the effective electron dipole, flopping mode qubits can provide faster gates with smaller field gradients. Moreover, operating in the strong-driving limit can reduce their sensitivity to charge noise. However, alloy disorder in Si/SiGe heterostructures randomizes the valley energy splitting and the valley phase difference between dots, enhancing the probably of valley excitations while tunneling between the dots, and opening a leakage channel. In this work, we analyze the performance of flopping mode spin qubits in the presence of charge noise and alloy disorder, and we optimize these qubits for a variety of valley configurations, in both weak and strong charge-noise regimes. When the charge noise is weak, high fidelity qubits can be implemented across a wide range of valley parameters, provided the electronic pulse is fine-tuned for a given valley configuration. When the charge noise is strong, high-fidelity pulses can still be engineered, provided the valley splittings in each dot are relatively large and the valley phase difference is relatively small. We analyze how charge noise-induced fluctuations of the inter-dot detuning, as well as small shifts in other qubit parameters, impact qubit fidelities. We find that strongly driven pulses are less sensitive to detuning fluctuations but more sensitive to small shifts in the valley parameters, which can actually dominate the qubit infidelities in some regimes. Finally, we discuss schemes to tune devices away from poor-performing configurations, enhancing the scalability of flopping-mode-based qubit architectures.

Barocaloric (BC) effects at liquid-vapor transitions in hydrofluorocarbons drive most commercial technologies used for heating and cooling in the heating, ventilation and air-conditioning sector. However, these fluids suffer from huge global warming potential and alternative gases are less efficient, toxic or flammable. Solid-solid and solid-liquid BC materials have zero global warming potential and could even improve on current device efficiencies. Whilst solid-liquid BCs typically outperform solid-solid BCs, the latter are advantageous as they avoid leaks and present easier handling and recyclability thus facilitating waste management. Here we confine the solid-liquid BC stearic acid inside the nanopores of a functionalised metal-organic framework (MOF) and demonstrate that the colossal BC properties are retained in a solid-state material. Moreover, the enhanced interactions between the pore surface and the BC material allow a level of active control over the thermal response, as opposed to passive encapsulation. Our results open novel avenues to exploit and tune colossal BC effects in a wide range of combinations of solid-liquid BC materials embedded within functionalized MOFs, without the associated engineering drawbacks.

We demonstrate that nontrivial multiband topological invariants of electronic wavefunctions can be revealed through diamagnetic orbital magnetization responses to external magnetic fields. We find that decomposing orbital magnetization into energetic and quantum-geometric contributions allows one to deduce nontrivial multiband topology, provided knowledge of the energy spectrum. We showcase our findings in general effective models with multiband Euler topology. We moreover identify such multiband topological invariants in effective models of strontium ruthenide ($\text{Sr}_2 \text{Ru} \text{O}_4$), which may in principle be verified in the state-of-the-art doping-dependent magnetization measurements. Our reconstruction scheme for multiband invariants sheds a topological perspective on the multiorbital effects in materials realizing unconventional phenomenologies of orbital currents or multiband superconductivity.

Machine Learning (ML) driven discovery of novel and efficient thermoelectric (TE) materials warrants experimental TE datasets of high volume, diversity, and quality. While the largest publicly available dataset, Starrydata2, has a high data volume, it contains inaccurate data due to the inherent limitations of Large Language Model (LLM)-assisted data curation, ambiguous nomenclature and complex formulas of materials in the literature. Another unaddressed issue is the inclusion of multi-source experimental data, with high standard deviations and without synthesis information. Using half-Heusler (hH) materials as an example, this work is aimed at first highlighting these errors and inconsistencies which cannot be filtered with conventional dataset curation workflows. We then propose a statistical round-robin error-based data filtering method to address these issues, a method that can be applied to filter any other material property. Lastly, a hybrid dataset creation workflow, involving data from Starrydata2 and manual extraction, is proposed and the resulting dataset is analyzed and compared against Starrydata2.

Real-time time-dependent density functional theory (RT-TDDFT) is a powerful approach for investigating various ultrafast phenomena in materials. However, most existing RT-TDDFT studies rely on adiabatic local or semi-local approximations, which suffer from several shortcomings, including the inability to accurately capture excitonic effects in periodic systems. Combining RT-TDDFT with range-separated hybrid (RSH) functionals has emerged as an effective strategy to overcome these limitations. The RT-TDDFT-RSH implementation for periodic systems requires careful treatment of the Coulomb singularity and choosing proper gauges for the incorporation of external fields. We benchmark two schemes for treating the Coulomb singularity - the truncated Coulomb potential and the auxiliary-function correction - and find that the latter shows better convergence behavior and numerical stability for long-range corrected hybrid functions. Additionally, we assess the impact of gauge choice in simulations using numerical atomic orbitals and show that the recently proposed hybrid gauge incorporating position-dependent phases provides a more accurate description of excitonic absorption than the conventional velocity gauge. Our implementation significantly improves the accuracy of RT-TDDFT-RSH for modeling ultrafast excitonic dynamics in periodic systems.

While phonon topology in crystalline solids has been extensively studied, its influence on thermal transport-especially in nanostructures-remains elusive. Here, by combining first-principles-based machine learning potentials with the phonon Boltzmann transport equation and molecular dynamics simulations, we systematically investigate the role of topological surface phonons in the in-plane thermal transport of semiconductor thin films (Si, 4H -SiC, and c-BN). These topological surface phonons, originating from nontrivial acoustic phonon nodal lines, not only serve as key scattering channels for dominant acoustic phonons but also contribute substantially to the overall thermal conductivity. Remarkably, for these thin semiconductor films below 10 nm this contribution can be as large as over 30% of the in-plane thermal conductivity at 300 K, and the largest absolute contribution can reach 82 W/m-K, highlighting their significant role in nanoscale thermal transport in semiconductors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that both temperature and biaxial strain provide effective means to modulate this contribution. Our work establishes a direct link between topological surface phonons and nanoscale thermal transport, offering the first quantitative assessment of their role and paving the way for topology-enabled thermal management in semiconductors.

The molecular mechanisms by which organic additives such as saccharin control microstructure in nickel electrodeposition remain inadequately understood, particularly the role of the intense interfacial electric field. This study employs density functional theory (DFT) calculations to elucidate the field dependent adsorption behavior of neutral saccharin and its deprotonated anion (saccharinate) on nickel. By employing the B3LYP functional and implicit solvent models, the field dependent adsorption energetics, frontier orbitals and electrostatic potentials are calculated on a nickel surface. Key findings reveal that while saccharinate dominates in bulk plating baths, its strong solvation shell impedes surface adsorption. In contrast, neutral saccharin exhibits energetically favorable adsorption via sulfonyl oxygen or aromatic $π$-face interactions, with specific orientations further stabilized by the interfacial field.This selective adsorption at growth sites rationalizes saccharin's role in inhibiting rapid crystallization, promoting grain refinement, and producing bright, level deposits.The results directly link field-modulated molecular stereochemistry to macroscopic coating properties, providing a mechanistic foundation for the rational design of electroplating additives beyond empirical approaches.

X-ray diffraction, magnetic, and transport measurements reveal an intrinsic correlation between Fe content, structural ordering, and magnetic ground states. With increasing $x$, the system undergoes a successive transition from paramagnetism to a spin-glass state, then to long-range antiferromagnetism (AFM), and ultimately to a reentrant spin-glass phase, with the transition temperatures exhibiting a non-monotonic dependence on Fe content. The maximum Néel temperature ($T_{\mathrm{N}}$ = $\mathrm{175K}$) and strongest AFM coupling occur at $x=0.25$, where Fe atoms form a well-ordered $2a_0 \times 2a_0 $ superlattice within van der Waals gaps. Beyond $x = 0.25$, the superlattice transforms or disorders, weakening Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interactions and reducing $T_{\mathrm{N}}$ significantly. Electrical transport exhibits distinct anomalies at magnetic transition temperatures, corroborating the magnetic state evolution. Our work extends the compositional boundary of Fe-intercalated $\mathrm{NbSe_2}$, establishes precise stoichiometry-structure-magnetism correlations, and identifies structural ordering as a key tuning parameter for AFM. These findings provide a quantitative framework for engineering altermagnetic or switchable antiferromagnetic states in van der Waals materials.

The strain-relaxation mechanism of a set of Si$_{0.6}$Ge$_{0.4}$ linearly graded buffers (LGBs), grown following different temperature profiles, has been investigated by means of defect-etching and variable-temperature high-resolution X-ray diffraction (VT-HRXRD). Defect-etching experiments demonstrate that a sharp increase of threading dislocation density (TDD) from $3 \times 10^{5}$\,cm$^{-2}$ to $1.2 \times 10^{6}$\,cm$^{-2}$ takes place when the final growth temperature exceeds a critical value T$_c\approx 530^\circ$C. VT-HRXRD measurements show that in low TDD samples extra relaxation takes place for annealing temperatures larger than T$_c$, thanks to the nucleation of new dislocations. These results indicate that, below T$_c$, strain relaxation is driven by the gliding of existing dislocations while above T$_c$ new dislocations are nucleated, suggesting a link with our results and the brittle-to-ductile transition in Si$_{1-x}$Ge$_x$ alloys.

- **TL;DR**: 四重钙钛矿ACu₃Fe₂Re₂O₁₂ (A = Mn, Cu, La, Ce, Dy)的比热测量显示异常行为，可用rattling现象解释，并通过DFT+U计算在Mn系统中直接证实。

Experimental data on the specific heat $C_p$ of quadruple perovskites ACu$_3$Fe$_2$Re$_2$O$_{12}$ (A = Mn, Cu, La, Ce, Dy) are presented, demonstrating an anomalous concave-down $C_p/T$ vs. $T^2$ curve and a bell-shaped feature in $β(T) = (C_p - γT)/T^3$ plotted against $T$ on a logarithmic scale. This feature is most pronounced for A = Cu and Mn. These findings can be explained by the rattling phenomenon, previously identified in other systems such as filled skutterudites and $β$-pyrochlores. Using first-principles DFT+U calculations, the presence of a rattling mode in A = Mn system is directly confirmed. A qualitative interpretation of the rattling mechanism in terms of a pseudo-Jahn-Teller effect is proposed.

Defects in atomically thin van der Waals materials have recently been investigated as sources of spin-photon entanglement with sensitivity to strain tuning. Unlike many two-dimensional materials, quasi-one-dimensional materials such as transition metal trichalcogenides exhibit in-plane anisotropy resulting in axis-dependent responses to compressive and tensile strains. Herein, we characterize the tunable spin and optical properties of intrinsic vacancy defects in titanium trisulfide (TiS3) and niobium trisulfide (NbS3) nanowires. Within our ab initio approach, we show that sulfur vacancies and divacancies (VS and VD , respectively) in TiS3 and NbS3 adopt strain-dependent defect geometries between in-plane strains of -3 % and 3 %. The calculated electronic structures indicate that both VS and VD possess in-gap defect states with optically bright electronic transitions whose position relative to the conduction and valence bands varies with in-plane strain. Further, our calculations predict that VS in TiS3 and VD in NbS3 exhibit transitions in their ground state spins; specifically, a compressive strain of 0.4 % along the direction of nanowire growth causes a shift from a triplet state to a singlet state for the VS defect in TiS3, whereas a tensile strain of 2.9 % along the same direction in NbS3 induces a triplet ground state with a zero-phonon line of 0.83 eV in the VD defect. Our work shows that the anisotropic geometry of TiS3 and NbS3 nanowires offers exceptional tunability of optically active spin defects that can be used in quantum applications.

- **TL;DR**: 研究单轴和双轴拉伸应变对1T-TaS₂电阻率张量分量及CCDW-NCCDW相变温度的影响，发现应变会改变相变行为并产生新相

The effects of uniaxial and biaxial tensile strain on the $ρ_{xx}$ and $ρ_{yy}$ components of the resistivity tensor, and the commensurable-nearly commensurate CDW (CCDW-NCCDW) transition temperature in 1T-TaS$_2$ are studied. At room temperature, uniaxial tensile strain increases the resistivity tensor components by a comparable magnitude both parallel and perpendicular to the strain axis. In the case of biaxial strain, up to 20~K decrease in the CCDW-NCCDW phase transition temperature is observed. In the case of uniaxial strain, a new phase with two different CCDW-NCCDW phase transition temperatures is observed, the splitting exceeds 10 K. The occurrence of such a phase is associated with the transition of the CDW into the commensurate state along the tensile strain direction while maintaining nearly commensurability along the perpendicular one. The results allow to justify various models widely used in analysis of transport properties of 1T-TaS$_2$ in commensurate and nearly commensurate states.

### Quenching the Non-Collinear Spin Order in High-Tc Layered Ferromagnet Fe5GeTe2

- **TL;DR**: Fe5GeTe2在160K附近发生从共线到非共线磁序的相变，Ni掺杂可淬灭非共线序

The realization of long-range spin order in two-dimensions (2D) has catapulted the search for layered materials with magnetic ordering above room temperature. These efforts aim to understand and enhance the spin spin interactions in 2D. An emergent class of such magnets is the layered FeNGeTe2 (N = 3, 4, and 5). Here, we investigate the magnetic states over a wide field temperature phase space in the high-Tc ferromagnet Fe5GeTe2 using magnetization, ferromagnetic resonance (FMR), and magneto-transport measurements. Our findings reveal a magnetic phase transition from a collinear to a complex non-collinear magnetic order near the temperature T* = 160 K, below which magnetic susceptibility is reduced, FMR linewidth broadened, and anomalous Hall resistivity suppressed. Such non-collinearity results from the competition between magnetocrystalline anisotropy and Dzyaloshinskii Moriya interaction arising from the unusual Fe1 ordering in two possible split sites. Our study focuses on the strategy to quench the non-collinear spin order. Substituting 40% Ni in Fe5GeTe2 is found to be one such quenching strategy. This provides deeper insights into the magnetism of a high-Tc layered-ferromagnet, offering opportunities to develop 2D magnet-based devices.

Magnetic two-dimensional (2D) crystals were isolated about a decade ago, triggering a tremendous research activity worldwide. This colloquium raises a stiff question: what is really new about them? At first sight, they seem to be purer implementations of 2D spin models than traditional systems such as ultra-thin films. Yet, they partly realized their promises so far, and whether they give fresh perspectives on long-standing predictions in statistical physics is still an open question. Undoubtedly, they are uniquely amenable to electric-field effect, susceptible to mechanical deformation, and sensitive to moirés, for example. They represent interesting platforms for exploring, challenging, or simply revisiting a wide range of phenomena in condensed matter magnetism. This colloquium intends to offer a critical, yet not necessarily skeptical, overview of the field, clarifying what we believe could be unique with 2D magnets, related quasi-2D van der Waals magnets, and their heterostructures.

Aqueous zinc (Zn) batteries (AZBs) face significant challenges due to the limited compatibility of Zn anodes with conventional separators, leading to dendrite growth, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and poor cycling stability. While separator design is crucial for optimizing battery performance, its potential remains underexplored. The commonly used glass fiber (GF) filters were not originally designed as battery separators. To address their limitations, nanochitin derived from waste shrimp shells was used to fabricate separators with varying concentrations of amine and carboxylic functional groups. This study investigates how the type and concentration of these groups influence the separator's properties and performance. In a mild acidic electrolyte that protonates the amine groups, the results showed that the density of both ammonium and carboxylic groups in the separators significantly affected water structure and ionic conductivity. Quasi-Elastic Neutron Scattering (QENS) revealed that low-functionalized chitin, particularly with only ammonium groups, promotes strongly bound water with restricted mobility, thereby enhancing Zn plating and stripping kinetics. These separators exhibit exceptional Zn stability over 2000 hours at low current densities (0.5 mA/cm2), maintaining low overpotentials and stable polarization. Additionally, the full cell consisting of Zn||NaV3O8.1.5H2O showed a cycle life of over 2000 cycles at 2 A/g, demonstrating the compatibility of the nanochitin-based separators with low concentrations of functional surface groups. These results demonstrate the importance of a simple separator design for improving the overall performance of AZBs.

- **TL;DR**: AZ31B镁合金中能量转换取决于主导变形机制：滑移主导时约50%塑性功转化为热，孪生主导时大部分塑性功被储存，热耗散极少

Energy conversion in AZ31B magnesium alloy depends strongly on the dominant deformation mechanism. In slip-dominated specimen, strained parallel to extrusion direction $\parallel$ ED, approximately 50$\%$ of plastic work is converted into heat, with Taylor-Quinney coefficient $β_{int}$ rising rapidly then gradually with strain. Twinning-dominated specimen ($\perp$ ED) initially stores most plastic work, showing minimal heat dissipation, reflecting the dislocation-mediated nature of twinning in HCP metals, and $β_{int}$ increasing to $\approx$ 0.4 at failure. The final microstructure tracks stored energy evolution: the $\parallel$ ED specimen, predominantly slip-dominated, exhibits fragmented grains and strong dislocation activity, with twinning appearing at the final stages, driving energy accumulation and lattice rotation. In contrast, the $\perp$ ED specimen shows limited refinement, early localization, and twinning-driven premature fracture.

- **TL;DR**: ScAlN薄膜中存在纳米级Sc富集团簇，这些团簇影响材料的介电、压电和铁电性能，MBE生长的薄膜比溅射薄膜具有更强的团簇效应和更高的介电常数。

ScN alloyed AlN (ScxAl1-xN, ScAlN) is a wurtzite semiconductor with attractive ferroelectric, dielectric, piezoelectric, and optical properties. Here, we show that ScAlN films (with x spanning 0.18 to 0.36) contain nanoscale Sc-rich clusters which maintain the wurtzite crystal structure. While both molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and sputter deposited Sc0.3Al0.7N films show Sc clustering, the degree of clustering is significantly stronger for the MBE-grown film, offering an explanation for some of the discrepancies between MBE-grown and sputtered films reported in the literature. Moreover, the MBE-grown Sc0.3Al0.7N film exhibits a dispersive and anomalously large dielectric permittivity, roughly double that of sputtered Sc0.3Al0.7N. We attribute this result to the Sc-rich clusters locally reaching x ~ 0.5 and approaching the predicted ferroelectric-to-paraelectric phase transition, resulting in a giant (local) enhancement in permittivity. The Sc-rich clusters should similarly affect the piezoelectric, optical, and ferroelectric responses, suggesting cluster-engineering as a means to tailor ScAlNs functional properties.
