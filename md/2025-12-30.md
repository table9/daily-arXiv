- **TL;DR**: 研究交替单层-三层La₃Ni₂O₇的磁性性质，发现其在150K以下形成非公度磁有序，压力抑制磁有序温度，表明电子关联强度从双层到单层-三层再到三层逐渐减弱。

Understanding the magnetic ground state of Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates is crucial, as these materials exhibit superconductivity under high pressure and host competing electronic orders that may play a key role in the pairing mechanism. In this work, we investigate the magnetic properties of the alternating monolayer-trilayer phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (1313-La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$) using muon-spin rotation/relaxation ($μ$SR) under both ambient and hydrostatic pressure conditions. The monolayer-trilayer phase develops incommensurate magnetic order below approximately 150 K, with a mean ordering temperature of $T_{SDW} \simeq 123$ K and a transition width of $ΔT_{SDW} \simeq 15$ K. The abrupt onset of the internal magnetic field indicates a first-order-like transition. Hydrostatic pressure ($p$) suppresses the magnetic ordering temperature at a rate of $dT_{SDW}/d p \simeq -3.9$ K/GPa, demonstrating a progressive destabilization of the ordered state. By comparison with the bilayer 2222-La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and the trilayer 3333-La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ systems, and within a unified phenomenological framework, systematic trends are identified linking the pressure dependence of $T_{SDW}$, the (in)commensurability of the magnetic order, and the character of the magnetic transition. These trends consistently indicate a gradual reduction of electronic correlation strength from the bilayer to the monolayer-trilayer and trilayer nickelates. This hierarchy suggests that the higher superconducting transition temperature observed in the 2222 phase may be closely connected to its more strongly correlated electronic nature. These results position the alternating monolayer-trilayer 1313-La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ as an intermediate member linking the magnetic behavior of the bilayer 2222-La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and the trilayer 3333-La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ Ruddlesden-Popper compounds.

- **TL;DR**: 发现新型Kagome超导体CaMxPd5-x（M=Nb和V），其中CaNb5具有强电子-声子耦合和最高Tc（10.1K，压力下可达12.8K），并通过对称性指标分类其拓扑特性。

Materials featuring kagome lattices have attracted significant research interest due to their unique geometric frustration, which gives rise to rich physical phenomena such as non-trivial topology, spin fluctuations, and superconductivity. In this work, using CaPd5 as the prototype structure, we discover and systematically investigate a new class of kagome superconductors, CaMxPd5-x (M = Nb and V) alloys. First-principles calculations confirm that these compounds are non-magnetic metals, among which four are dynamically stable: CaNb5, CaV5, CaNb2Pd3, and CaV2Pd3. CaNb5 is identified as a strong electron-phonon coupling (EPC) superconductor with the highest superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of 10.1 K, which can be further increased to 12.8 K under external pressure. In contrast, CaV5, CaNb2Pd3, and CaV2Pd3 exhibit weaker EPC and correspondingly lower Tc values. Furthermore, by applying the method of symmetry indicators, we systematically classify the topological and nodal characteristics of CaNb5, providing valuable insights for determining its superconducting pairing symmetry. Our findings demonstrate that Nb and V substitution in kagome CaPd5 provides an effective route for designing a new type of kagome superconductor with relatively high Tc. This study also offers new perspectives on topological superconductivity in kagome systems and establishes a useful guideline for discovering other superconducting materials with unique properties.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文分析了自旋三重态超导体的自旋磁化率，从零场到有限场区域，重点研究其对奈特位移测量的影响，并应用于UTe₂材料。

We analyze the spin susceptibility of spin-triplet superconductors from the zero-field to finite-field regimes, with emphasis on its implications for Knight-shift measurements. In the zero-field limit, we review the general expression for the static spin susceptibility and highlight the universal zero-temperature sum rule, $\sum_i χ_{ii}(T=0)=2χ^N$, which constrains the residual susceptibility components for any triplet state. Using representative isotropic, helical, and chiral $\vec{d}$-vectors, we illustrate how the Knight shift encodes the spin configuration of the order parameter and show that the sum rule remains robust even for anisotropic Fermi surfaces. We then incorporate magnetic field effects through a semiclassical Doppler shift of quasiparticle energies in the vortex state. The resulting field dependence of the susceptibility - including both longitudinal (Knight-shift) and transverse magnetic susceptibility components - provides a sensitive probe of nodal directions and the momentum dependence of the $\vec{d}$-vector. Applying this framework to UTe$_2$, we demonstrate how the distinct irreducible representations allowed by orthorhombic symmetry can be differentiated by their field-dependent susceptibility.

- **TL;DR**: 研究两种环形移位寄存器中约瑟夫森涡旋的能量耗散和信息传播：均匀寄存器可实现低于朗道尔热力学极限的每比特移位能量耗散，非均匀寄存器的最小能量耗散约为16倍朗道尔极限。

We study energy dissipation and propagation of information encoded by Josephson vortices in two types of circular shift register: a) a uniform register composed of sections of discrete Josephson transmission lines (JTL) forming a closed loop with a flux pump allowing to change the number of moving fluxon; b) a nonuniform register composed of sections of the regular JTL and sections of JTLs utilizing nSQUIDs - dc-SQUIDs with negative inductance between their arms - instead of single Josephson junctions. nSQUIDs are parametric devices with a flexible double-well potential that were proposed as components for reversible computing. For the uniform register, we demonstrate the energy dissipation per bit-shift operation below the Landauer's thermodynamic limit $E_T=k_BTln2$ up to propagation delays of ~0.7 ns, corresponding to the circular information motion with frequencies up to ~1.4 GHz. This does not contradict Landauer's minimum energy requirement for computations since information is not destroyed. For the nonuniform register, we find the minimum energy dissipation per bit-shift of about 16$E_T$ and attribute this to a nonuniform movement of vortices and energy barriers between the regular JTL and nSQUID sections. Differences of Josephson vortex propagation in both types of circular registers are discussed based on the measured current-voltage characteristics, extracted effective resistance and the terminal speed of Josephson vortices, and their dependences on the number of moving vorticies. nSQUID inductance connecting JJs to the ground leads to an unusual type of lossless discrete transmission line with frequency-dependent impedance and propagation speed, both different from the regular JTLs.

Water adopts many different crystal structures in its solid form. These provide insight into potential structures of water even in its liquid phase, and they can be used to calibrate pair potentials used for simulation of water. In crowded biological environments, water may behave more like ice than bulk water. The different ice structures have different dielectric properties. This brief primer is intended to facilitate further research.

- **TL;DR**: 对TbAgAl化合物进行了高磁场（12T）下的磁化测量和电输运测量，发现其表现出反铁磁态向铁磁态的亚磁转变，具有大矫顽力和非饱和磁化，表明存在竞争性交换相互作用导致的磁无序态。

In order to further investigate the magnetic state of the RAgAl series, the magnetization measurements on the TbAgAl compound from this series have been extended to higher fields of 12 Tesla in the temperature range 2K-300K. The electrical resistivity in the temperature range 2-300K has been measured up to fields of 9 Tesla. The field dependence of magnetization at low temperatures suggests an antiferromagnetic state undergoing a metamagnetic transition to a ferromagnetic state above the critical field. The observation of large coercivity (unlike other compounds in the RAgAl series) and non-saturation of magnetization indicates a disordered magnetic state having both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic exchange interaction. The presence of competing interactions leading to a disordered state is also supported by transport measurements and is attributed presumably to the layered structure of the compound.

- **TL;DR**: 扭曲三层石墨烯中的准周期性和拓扑相互作用产生临界金属态，使超导性在宽角度范围内稳定存在，而非需要精细调控。

Twisted multilayer moiré materials are generically quasiperiodic on the moiré scale due to the interference of different misaligned moiré periodicities. Spatial inhomogeneities such as these can be detrimental to superconductivity; nonetheless, superconductivity has been observed in quasiperiodic twisted trilayer graphene (TTG). Here, we systematically study the superconducting properties of TTG. We reveal that an interplay between quasiperiodicity and topology drives TTG into a critical regime, enabling it to host superconductivity with rigid phase stiffness for a wide range of twist angles, rather than at a fine-tuned value. The criticality in the normal state is due to the Dirac fermions coupled by quasiperiodic tunneling simulating 3D topological superconductor surface states. This critical-metal regime is marked by multifractal wave functions across the spectrum and scale-invariant transport reminiscent of the integer quantum Hall plateau transition. We demonstrate this with large-scale wave function and Kubo conductivity calculations. These observations lead to a clear experimental implication: stronger interlayer coupling in TTG further stabilizes both the criticality and superconductivity, allowing superconductivity to be seen across a wider range of angles with experimentally accessible pressures.

- **TL;DR**: 提出一种利用网络分区解决大规模管网非线性方程组的算法，通过局部求解子系统实现全局解，特别适用于多运营商网络场景

The solution of potential-driven steady-state flow in large networks is required in various engineering applications, such as transport of natural gas or water through pipeline networks. The resultant system of nonlinear equations depends on the network topology, and its solution grows more challenging as the network size increases. We present an algorithm that utilizes a given partition of a network into tractable sizes to compute a global solution for the full nonlinear system through local solution of smaller subsystems induced by the partitions. When the partitions are induced by interconnects or transfer points corresponding to networks owned by different operators, the method ensures data is shared solely at the interconnects, leaving network operators free to solve the network flow system corresponding to their own domain in any manner of their choosing. The proposed method is shown to be connected to the Schur complement and the method's viability demonstrated on some challenging test cases.

### Structural changes in the Lennard-Jones supercooled liquid and ideal glass: an improved integral equation for the replica method

- **TL;DR**: 该论文通过改进的复制HMSA理论研究了Lennard-Jones流体在极低温下的结构特性，发现了一个密度依赖的温度点，在该温度下径向分布函数出现新的峰，表明理想玻璃具有fcc类短程有序但无长程有序的结构特征。

Framing the glass formation within standard statistical mechanics is an outstanding problem of condensed matter theory. To provide new insight, we investigate the structural properties of the Lennard-Jones fluid in the very-low temperature regime, by using a replicated version of the refined HMSA theory of the liquid state, combined with an appropriate split of the pair potential [Bomont and Bretonnet, J. Chem. Phys. 114, 4141 (2001)]. Our scheme allows one to reach an unprecedented low-temperature domain within both the supercooled liquid and the ideal-glass phase. Therein, a density-dependent temperature is identified, whereupon the radial distribution function experiences clear-cut structural changes, insofar as an additional peak develops in between the main and the second peaks. Such a structural feature points to a local structure of the Lennard-Jones ideal glass with an fcc-like short-range order, in the absence of any long-range order.

### Representations of the symmetry groups of infinite crystals

We investigate the representations of the symmetry groups of infinite crystals. Crystal symmetries are usually described as the finite symmetry group of a finite crystal with periodic boundary conditions, for which the Brillouin zone is a finite set of points. However, to deal with the continuous crystal momentum $\mathbf{k}$ required to discuss the continuity, singularity or analyticity of band energies $ε_n(\mathbf{k})$ and Bloch states $ψ_{\mathbf{k}}$, we need to consider infinite crystals. The symmetry groups of infinite crystals belong to the category of infinite non-compact groups, for which many standard tools of group theory break down. For example, character theory is no longer available for these groups and we use harmonic analysis to build the group algebra, the regular representation, the induction of irreducible representations of the crystallographic group from projective representations of the point groups and the decomposition of a representation into its irreducible parts. We deal with magnetic and non-magnetic groups in arbitrary dimensions. In the last part of the paper, we discuss Mackey's restriction of an induced representation to a subgroup, the tensor product of induced representations and the symmetric and antisymmetric squares of induced representations.

In this paper we review the recent progress in theoretical understanding of the peculiarities of photogalvanic phenomena, photon drag and inverse Faraday effects in superconductors and hybrid superconducting structures. Our study is based on the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) theory with a complex relaxation constant which provides the simplest description of the mechanisms of the second-order nonlinear effects in the electrodynamic response and related mechanisms of generation of dc photocurrents, magnetic moment and switching between different current states under the influence of electromagnetic radiation of various polarization.

Understanding the intricate interplay between soot dynamics and chemical reactions within catalytic diesel particulate filters (CDPF) is crucial for enhancing both filtration efficiency and regeneration performance. In this paper, we establish a unified pore-scale multiphysics model based on the Eulerian-Lagrangian framework to comprehensively resolve the transport, deposition, and oxidation of soot. Distinguishing itself from conventional empirical correlations and stochastic-based approximations, the system models soot deposition through fundamental physical principles, integrating elastic deformation and surface adhesion mechanics at the particle-wall interface. Simultaneously, it incorporates a robust oxidation model that accounts for the competitive kinetics of both $\textrm{O}_2$ and $\textrm{NO}_2$ pathways, enabling comprehensive coverage of all CDPF operating regimes. Validated against three classical benchmark cases, the model demonstrates superior accuracy in capturing interfacial mass transfer and particle-wall interactions. Simulation under a typical CDPF low-temperature operating condition emphasizes the pivotal role of $\textrm{NO}_2$ and catalyst in promoting regeneration and reveals complex synergistic and competitive effects between distinct reaction pathways. Notably, the reaction rate of direct $\textrm{O}_2$ pathway is accelerated by a factor of 87 in the presence of the catalyst. For ultra-fine soot particles ($50~\mathrm{nm}$), the Brownian motion and thermophoretic forces directly dictate the deposition efficiency. Their strong thermal sensitivity also underscores the necessity for an integrated soot transport-deposition-oxidation framework.

- **TL;DR**: 在未掺杂的准一维半导体Ta2NiS5中，通过光学激发可以动态产生长寿命的三子态，这不同于传统半导体中三子通常仅作为掺杂稳定的激发态存在。

Strong Coulomb interactions in low-dimensional quantum materials give rise to emergent bound states such as excitons and trions, which play a central role in correlated electronic phases. In quasi-one-dimensional systems, equilibrium photoemission studies have reported signatures of trions, suggesting an unusually robust state, as opposed to conventional semiconductors where trions typically appear only as excited states stabilized by carrier doping. Here, we show that optical excitation of undoped Ta2NiS5 - a correlated quasi-one-dimensional semiconductor - generates a pronounced and long-lived trion population, demonstrating that such states can be dynamically induced even in the absence of doping. Using time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy we track the dynamics of a bright, localized in-gap state that emerges following photoexcitation and identify it as a transient trion population. We uncover an unconventional trion formation pathway and a fluence-dependent competition between trions and excitons. These findings extend ultrafast quasiparticle photoemission spectroscopy to complex bound states in bulk quantum materials, enabling the dynamical control of charged and neutral excitations.

### A scanning probe microscopy approach for identifying defects in aluminum oxide

The coherence of quantum dot qubits fabricated in semiconductors is often limited by charge noise from defects in gate dielectrics, which are material- and process-dependent. Characterizing these defects is an important step towards reducing their impact and improving qubit coherence. The identification of individual defects requires atomic-scale spatial resolution, however, and sufficient spectral sensitivity to determine their electronic structure. Electrostatic force microscopy (EFM) provides highly resolved maps of the surface potential of dielectrics, and importantly, is also sensitive to single-electron charging processes that reflect the spectral structure of underlying defects. In this work, we use cryogenic EFM to characterize aluminum oxide grown by atomic layer deposition (ALD) on bulk silicon. These measurements reveal defects close to the surface that exchange electrons with the EFM tip as they transition through different charge states. Detailed electrostatic modeling opens the door to powerful techniques for mapping tip-backgate charging voltages onto defect transition energies, allowing defects such as aluminum vacancies, and carbon, oxygen, or hydrogen impurities to be identified, by comparing to density functional theory (DFT). These results point towards EFM as a powerful tool for exploring defect structures in solid-state qubits.

- **TL;DR**: 提出一种基于矩阵的交换因子变换方法，用于求解一般域上耦合混合边界条件的辐射传输问题，通过Neumann级数解析追踪所有反射-散射路径，确保收敛性、非负辐射和精确能量守恒。

This paper presents a matrix-based exchange factor transformation for solving coupled mixed boundary condition radiative transfer problems on general domains. The method applies to participating media ranging from transparent to absorbing, emitting, and scattering, with boundaries ranging from absorbing to reflecting. Given a first-interaction exchange factor matrix $\mathbf{F}$, the transformation produces an absorption matrix $\mathbf{A}$ and a multiple reflection-scattering matrix $\mathbf{R}$ through a Neumann series that analytically traces all reflection-scattering paths to steady state. The paper establishes rigorous conditions under which the method guarantees convergence, non-negative radiation, and exact energy conservation to machine precision. A comparison with Noble's matrix formulation of Hottel's zonal method reveals a previously unidentified discrepancy in that classical approach; the proposed transformation eliminates this discrepancy. The method is validated against the diffusion approximation in the high-extinction limit and against results of Crosbie and Schrenker for pure and partial scattering cases. The method is applicable to medium-scale general reflecting-scattering problems and scales to large problems when negligible reflection-scattering and high extinction ensure matrix sparsity.

The Parallel Minority Game (PMG) is a synchronous adaptive multi-agent model that exhibits active-absorbing transitions characteristic of non-equilibrium statistical systems. We perform a comprehensive numerical study of the PMG under two families of microscopic decision rules: (i) agents update their choices based on instantaneous population in their alternative choices, and (ii) threshold-based activation that activates agents movement only after overcrowding density crossing a threshold. We measure time-dependent and steady state limits of activity $A(t)$, overcrowding fraction $F(t)$ as functions of the control parameter $g=N/D$, where $N$ is the number of agents and $D$ is the total number of sites. Instantaneous rules display mean-field directed-percolation (MF-DP) scaling with $β\approx1.00$, $δ\approx0.5$, and $ν_{\parallel}\approx2.0$. Threshold rules, however, produce a distinct non-mean-field universality class with $β\approx0.75$ and a systematic failure of MF-DP dynamical scaling. We show that thresholding acts as a relevant perturbation to DP. The results highlight how minimal cognitive features at the agent level fundamentally alter large-scale critical behaviour in socio-economic and active systems.

### Toward reducing the formation temperature of diopside via wet-chemical synthesis routes using chloride precursors

Reducing the formation temperature of single-phase multioxides is one of the classic challenges in ceramic processing, including wet-chemical synthesis routes. Toward pursuing this aim for diopside (MgCaSi2O6), the merit of different sol-gel and coprecipitation processes using the related chloride precursors followed by calcination was compared from the viewpoints of crystallinity and homogeneity. In accordance to the results, the use of the sol-gel techniques, directed with/without an alkaline catalyst, gave rise to the unfavorable creation of multiphase and low-crystallinity structures. Regarding the coprecipitation methods, the one-step addition of a precipitant agent is accompanied by an indirect low-temperature formation of nano-diopside, while a direct crystallization into this phase was explored in the dropwise condition, albeit with a lower crystallinity. Thus, by employing a suitable synthesis processing, it is feasible to take control of a wide range of nanoparticulate diopside-based structures achieved after a low-temperature calcination.

We show that nonequilibrium spin injection into a superconductor can generate an anomalous supercurrent or induce a phase gradient, even for spin voltages below the superconducting gap. Our mechanism does not require breaking time-reversal symmetry in the effective superconducting Hamiltonian, but instead relies on nonequilibrium spin injection. We further demonstrate that superconductivity enhances spin injection due to the large quasiparticle density of states near the pairing gap, an effect that persists well below the gap. This contrasts with earlier works predicting the absence of spin injection at zero temperature and small spin voltages. Our results provide a natural explanation for long-standing experimental observations of spin injection in superconductors and predict novel effects arising from spin-charge coupling, including the electrical control of anomalous phase gradients in superconducting systems with spin-orbit coupling. These effects are broadly testable in a variety of materials and hybrid superconducting structures.

How quantum electron and nuclei motions affect biomolecular chemical reactions remains a central challengeable question at the interface of quantum chemistry and biology. Ultrafast charge migration in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) has long been hypothesized to play a critical role in photochemistry, genome stability, and long-range biomolecular signaling, however, direct real-time observation of these electronic processes has remained elusive. Here, we present a theoretical investigation and propose the concept of future experimental measurements of laser-driven charge dynamics in the canonical DNA nucleobase pairs thymine_adenine and cytosine_guanine. Attosecond-resolved simulations employing high-level ab initio methods reveal base-dependent ionization mechanisms, directional charge migration pathways, and electronic coherences that govern sub-femtosecond redistribution of electron density across hydrogen-bonded nucleobase interfaces. Accordingly, we propose the concept of a quantum attosecond scanning electron microscope, termed the quantum attomicroscope (Q-attomicroscope), a capable of imaging photoinduced quantum chemistry reactions in attosecond temporal resolution and sub-nanometer spatial precision. As a proof of principle, we propose to image the charge migrations dynamics in DNA which we studied theoretically. Together, our preceptive bridges theory, instrumentation, and control, outlining a pathway toward laser mediated manipulation of DNA structure with implications for repair processes, chemical reactivity, and future personalized medicine.

- **TL;DR**: CePdIn重费米子化合物在压力下表现出两个不同的反铁磁相，压力约2.6 GPa处发生相变，可能与压力增强的Kondo杂化导致的电子结构演化有关。

Frustrated Kondo lattices are ideal platforms for studying how both the Kondo effect and quantum fluctuations compete with the magnetic exchange interactions that drive magnetic ordering. Here, we investigate the effect of tuning the heavy-fermion compound CePdIn, which crystallizes in the geometrically frustrated ZrNiAl-type structure, using applied magnetic fields and hydrostatic pressure. At ambient pressure, CePdIn exhibits two magnetic transitions, one at $T_{\rm{N}} \approx 1.65$ K and another at $T_{\rm{M}} \approx 1.15$ K, which are both suppressed by applied $c$-axis fields. Upon applying pressure in zero magnetic field, there is a non-monotonic evolution of $T_{\rm{N}}$, which decreases to 0.8 K at 2.3 GPa, before abruptly increasing to 1.5 K at 2.6 GPa. At higher pressures, $T_{\rm{N}}$ has a weak pressure dependence, and vanishes near 5 GPa. Together with the high-pressure phase being more robust to applied fields, these results suggest two distinct antiferromagnetic phases in CePdIn, which are separated near 2.6 GPa, and this change may be driven by the evolution of the underlying electronic structure due to enhanced Kondo hybridization under pressure.

Anisotropic intensity distributions on nanostructured surfaces and polarization-sensitive spectra have been observed in a number of nanoscale infrared spectroscopic imaging methods, including nano-FTIR [Bakir et al., Molecules, 2020, 25, 4295], photothermal induced resonance (PTIR) [Waeytens et al., Analyst, 2021, 146], tapping AFM-IR [Hondl et al., ACS Meas. Sci. Au, 2025, 5, 469; Luo et al., APL, 2022, 121, 23330], infrared photoinduced force microscopy (PiF-IR) [Anindo et al., JPCC, 2025, 129, 4517; Shcherbakov et al., Rev Methods Primers, 2025, 5, 1; Ali et al., Anal. Chem., 2025, 97, 23914] and peak force infrared microscopy (PFIR) [Xie et al., JPCC, 2022, 126, 8393; Anindo, JPCC, 2025]. A recent work combining modeling and experiment demonstrated that the hybrid field coupling of the IR illumination E0 with a polymer nanosphere and a metallic AFM probe is nearly as strong as the plasmonic coupling in case of a gold nanosphere [Anindo, JPCC, 2025]. For p-polarized illumination, this results in enhanced IR absorption on the surface perpendicular to the propagation of E0 which can explain the observed anisotropic intensity distribution. An additional anisotropy may be introduced by aligned surface molecules with oriented vibrational transition moments [Bakir et al., Molecules, 2020, 25, 4295; Luo, APL, 2022]. PiF-IR is strongly surface sensitive combining an unprecedented spatial resolution &lt; 5 nm with high spectral resolution [Shcherbakov, Rev Methods Primers, 2025; Ali, Anal. Chem., 2025], which allows, for example, to visualize nanoscale chemical variation on the surface of bacteria cells affected by antimicrobial interaction [Ali, Anal. Chem., 2025]. We compare PiF-IR hyperspectra of aligned perylene Langmuir Blodgett monolayers on nanostructured and planar gold substrates and use quantum chemical calculations of the oriented vibrational oscillators to interpret the observations.

Continuous fiber-reinforced composite manufactured by additive manufacturing (CFRC-AM) offers opportunities for printing lightweight materials with high specific strength. However, their performance is sensitive to the interaction of process and material parameters, making exhaustive experimental testing impractical. In this study, we introduce a data-efficient, multi-input, multi-target learning approach that integrates Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS)-guided experimentation with a squeeze-and-excitation wide and deep neural network (SE-WDNN) to jointly predict multiple mechanical and manufacturing properties of CFRC-AMs based on different manufacturing parameters. We printed and tested 155 specimens selected from a design space of 4,320 combinations using a Markforged Mark Two 3D printer. The processed data formed the input-output set for our proposed model. We compared the results with those from commonly used machine learning models, including feedforward neural networks, Kolmogorov-Arnold networks, XGBoost, CatBoost, and random forests. Our model achieved the lowest overall test error (MAPE = 12.33%) and showed statistically significant improvements over the baseline wide and deep neural network for several target variables (paired t-tests, p &lt;= 0.05). SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis revealed that reinforcement strategy was the major influence on mechanical performance. Overall, this study demonstrates that the integration of LHS and SE-WDNN enables interpretable and sample-efficient multi-target predictions, guiding parameter selection in CFRC-AM with a balance between mechanical behavior and manufacturing metrics.

Based on a cocycle structure, we identify a new derivation of the Boltzmann distribution for finite energy-level systems from the maximal entropy principle (MEP). Our approach does not rely on the method of the Lagrange multiplier, and it provides a more transparent way to understand the dependence on the energy levels of the temperature $T = 1/β$ for the equilibrium distribution. Finally, we make two curious observations associated with our derivations.

- **TL;DR**: 通过第一性原理研究AlSb立方相和六方相的结构、热力学、电子、光学和热电性质，发现立方相更稳定，六方相热电性能更优，为光电和能量转换应用提供指导。

This study presents a first principles investigation of the structural, thermodynamic, electronic, optical and thermoelectric properties of aluminum antimonide (AlSb) in its cubic (F-43m) and hexagonal (P63mc) phases. Both structures are dynamically and mechanically stable, as confirmed by phonon calculations and the Born Huang criteria. The lattice constants obtained using the SCAN and PBEsol functionals show good agreement with experimental data. The cubic phase exhibits a direct band gap of 1.66 to 1.78 eV, while the hexagonal phase shows a band gap of 1.48 to 1.59 eV, as confirmed by mBJ and HSE06 calculations. Under external pressure, the band gap decreases in the cubic phase and increases in the hexagonal phase due to different s p orbital hybridization mechanisms. The optical absorption coefficient reaches 1e6 cm-1, which is comparable to or higher than values reported for other III V semiconductors. The Seebeck coefficient exceeds 1500 microV per K under intrinsic conditions, and the thermoelectric performance improves above 600 K due to enhanced phonon scattering and lattice anharmonicity. The calculated formation energies (-1.316 eV for F-43m and -1.258 eV for P63mc) confirm that the cubic phase is thermodynamically more stable. The hexagonal phase exhibits higher anisotropy and lower lattice stiffness, which is favorable for thermoelectric applications. These results demonstrate the strong interplay between crystal symmetry, phonon behavior and charge transport, and provide useful guidance for the design of AlSb based materials for optoelectronic and energy conversion technologies.

The recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under ambient-pressure in strained thin films raises the question of how superconductivity can be optimized through strain. In this work, we investigate the strain-dependent electronic structure and superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using density functional theory combined with random phase approximation spin-fluctuation calculations. We find that biaxial strain acts as a tuning parameter for Fermi surface topology and magnetic correlations. Large tensile strain drives a Lifshitz transition characterized by a $d_{z^2}$ band crossing, leading to a sharp increase in the density of states and theoretical pairing strength. However, this is accompanied by a large increase in magnetic proximity, suggesting strong competition with spin-density-wave order. Conversely, under compressive strain, we identify a structurally selective $T_c$ enhancement restricted to the high-symmetry $I4/mmm$ phase. This effect is driven by the straightening of Ni--O--Ni bonds and the emergence of a $Γ$-centered hole pocket, yielding $T_c$ values consistent with recent thin-film experiments. Our results highlight the balance between structural symmetry, electronic topology, and magnetic instability in nickelates, and provides a theoretical framework for optimizing superconductivity via strain engineering.

Studies of quantum thermal effects on molecular excitation dynamics have often relied on oversimplified models, such as energy eigenstates or low-dimensional potentials, which fail to capture the complexity of real chemical systems. In reality, molecules are spatially extended and embedded in anisotropic environments, where molecular orbitals (MOs) play a central role in determining quantum behavior. To advance beyond these limitations, we propose a three-dimensional rotationally invariant system-bath (3D-RISB) model within the MO framework, with explicit inclusion of intramolecular vibrational motion. From this MO foundation, we derive numerically ``exact'' hierarchical equations of motion (MO-HEOM). As a demonstration, we analyze hydrogen molecules and hydrogen molecular ions with vibrational degrees of freedom, revealing their linear absorption spectra.

Kagome metals exhibit rich correlated-electron physics, yet a systematic understanding of the degree of correlation across transition-metal species remains elusive. Using density-functional theory plus multi-orbital slave-spin mean-field theory, we investigate electronic correlations in the Ti-, V-, and Cr-based 135 compounds with Sb and Bi pnictogens. We find that the significantly stronger degree of correlation of the Cr-based materials compared to Ti and V can only be explained through the synergy of two effects: the larger electron filling of the $d$-shell and the reduced characteristic kinetic energy. We put forward that the substitution of Sb with Bi strengthens correlations in all compounds and make the prediction that the-yet-to-be-synthesized CsCr$_3$Bi$_5$ must be the most strongly correlated member of the entire family. These findings provide a quantitative, band-structure-based framework for understanding and predicting correlation strength in Kagome metals.

- **TL;DR**: Hf/Zr基栅堆叠（HZHA）实现了亚纳米等效氧化层厚度（7.3Å），同时满足高温处理兼容性、阈值电压可调性和高可靠性要求，突破了传统高k材料的限制。

Advanced logic transistors require gate dielectrics that achieve sub-nanometer equivalent oxide thickness (EOT), suppress leakage, and satisfy three key requirements: (i) compatibility with RMG-like high-temperature processing, (ii) sufficient Vth tunability for multi-Vth design, and (iii) high device reliability. However, meeting all of these requirements simultaneously has been difficult with conventional high-k systems. In this work, we demonstrate that Hf/Zr-based gate stacks quantitatively satisfy these conditions. After a 700 C N2 anneal, the HZH superlattice achieves an EOT of 7.3 A, lower than conventional HfO2-only stacks (8.5 A) while maintaining comparable leakage. Embedding a 3 A Al2O3 dipole within an HfO2/ZrO2/HfO2 superlattice (HZHA) breaks the conventional dipole trade-off, achieving an EOT of 8.4 A, lower than the 9.0 A of a standard HfO2/Al2O3 stack, while providing a flatband voltage shift greater than 200 mV, thereby enabling multi-Vth tuning without compromising scaling. Furthermore, under -2 V negative-bias temperature stress at 125 C for 100 s, HZHA and HA exhibit comparable flatband voltage drifts of 87 mV and 97 mV, respectively, confirming that strong Vth tunability and sub-nanometer EOT can be achieved without compromising stability. In addition to these quantitative advances, this study reveals previously unreported physical insights into dipole behavior and interfacial diffusion in ultrathin Hf/Zr multilayers. These results establish HZHA as an RMG-compatible, Vth-tunable, low-EOT dielectric platform capable of supporting logic scaling beyond the 1 nm frontier.

This work presents a survey of mechanical models describing van der Waals interactions between 2D materials, encompassing both continuous elastomer-like materials and discrete (crystalline) 2D materials such as graphene. These interactions give rise to a range of physical phenomena, including contact instabilities, Moiré patterns, surface reconstructions, and superlubricity. The underlying contact forces follow from the variation of an interfacial interaction potential. The presentation first discusses normal contact models, and then tangential contact models. Both atomistic and continuum approaches are considered. In addition, the influence of external loading and changes in length scale on the ground state configuration and frictional contact behavior are analyzed. A particular emphasis is placed on discussing strategies that reduce computational cost in multiscale modeling.

Information flow between subsystems is a central concept in information thermodynamics, which provides the second-law-like inequalities for subsystems. This paper discusses the geometric decomposition of information flow, which was introduced for Markov jump systems [Y Maekawa, R Nagayama, K Yoshimura and S Ito, arXiv:2509.21985 (2025)], and applies it to overdamped Langevin systems. For overdamped Langevin systems, the geometric decomposition of information flow into excess and housekeeping contributions is related to the conventional definition of the $2$-Wasserstein distance between marginal distributions in optimal transport theory. This formulation offers an optimal-transport interpretation of subsystem dynamics, and this optimal-transport formulation is simpler for overdamped Langevin systems than for general Markov jump systems. It is also possible to handle features that are specific to overdamped Langevin systems, such as representations based on the Koopman mode decomposition, as well as their relationship with the Fisher information matrix. As with the results for Markov jump systems, we generalize the second law of information thermodynamics using housekeeping and excess information flow, leading to the concept of excess and housekeeping demons. We also derive a thermodynamic uncertainty relation and an information-thermodynamic speed limit incorporating excess information flow. These results are illustrated for the Gaussian case, and we discuss the conditions under which the excess and housekeeping demons emerge.

- **TL;DR**: DFT研究显示MAPbI3钙钛矿表面终止方式（MAI vs PbI）显著影响其与P3HT空穴传输层界面的电子结构和电荷传输性能，PbI终止界面表现出更强的轨道杂化和电荷转移。

Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) exhibit remarkable photovoltaic performance, where interface engineering with hole transport layers (HTLs) is crucial for optimizing charge transfer and device efficiency. In this work, we present a density functional theory (DFT) study of the MAPbI3/poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) hybrid interface, focusing on the role of perovskite surface termination in determining interfacial stability and electronic structure. We model MAI- and PbI-terminated MAPbI3 surfaces interfaced with P3HT and compare their interfacial electronic properties. Electronic structure calculations reveal distinct differences in orbital hybridization and band alignment: the MAI/m-P3HT interface exhibits weak coupling, whereas the PbI/m-P3HT interface shows stronger hybridization and enhanced charge transfer. Band alignment confirms type-II, hole-selective character in both cases, with more pronounced valence band maximum adjustment for PbI. Charge difference maps, Bader analysis, and local density of states consistently indicate higher charge transfer and stronger electronic coupling for PbI termination. Electrostatic potential offsets and transport parameters further highlight termination-dependent differences, with lighter effective masses at PbI/m-P3HT and higher hole velocity at MAI/m-P3HT. These findings provide theoretical insight into interfacial charge transport mechanisms and offer guidelines for optimizing perovskite-organic hybrid solar cells.

The discovery of novel odorant molecules is key for the fragrance and flavor industries, yet efficiently navigating the vast chemical space to identify structures with desirable olfactory properties remains a significant challenge. Generative artificial intelligence offers a promising approach for \textit{de novo} molecular design but typically requires large sets of molecules to learn from. To address this problem, we present a framework combining a variational autoencoder (VAE) with a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model to generate novel odorants from limited training sets of odor molecules. The self-supervised learning capabilities of the VAE allow it to learn SMILES grammar from ChemBL database, while its training objective is augmented with a loss term derived from an external QSAR model to structure the latent representation according to odor probability. While the VAE demonstrated high internal consistency in learning the QSAR supervision signal, validation against an external, unseen ground truth dataset (Unique Good Scents) confirms the model generates syntactically valid structures (100\% validity achieved via rejection sampling) and 94.8\% unique structures. The latent space is effectively structured by odor likelihood, evidenced by a Fréchet ChemNet Distance (FCD) of $\approx$ 6.96 between generated molecules and known odorants, compared to $\approx$ 21.6 for the ChemBL baseline. Structural analysis via Bemis-Murcko scaffolds reveals that 74.4\% of candidates possess novel core frameworks distinct from the training data, indicating the model performs extensive chemical space exploration beyond simple derivatization of known odorants. Generated candidates display physicochemical properties ....

- **TL;DR**: 该论文提出p轨道与t2g轨道之间存在同源性，建立了从最小模型哈密顿量到真实量子材料复杂行为的对应关系，为理解拓扑、铁磁性和超导等涌现现象提供了统一框架。

The nominal divide between $p$- and $d$-electron systems often obscures a deep underlying unity in condensed matter physics. This review elucidates the orbital homology between the $p$ and $t_{2g}$ orbital manifolds, establishing the correspondence that extends from minimal model Hamiltonians to the complex behaviors of real quantum materials. We demonstrate that despite their distinct atomic origins, these orbitals host nearly identical hopping physics and spin-orbit coupling, formalized through an effective ${l=1}$ angular momentum algebra for the $t_{2g}$ case. This equivalence allows one to transpose physical intuition and theoretical models developed for $p$-orbital systems directly onto the more complex $t_{2g}$ materials, and vice versa. We showcase how this paradigm provides a unified understanding of emergent phenomena, including non-trivial band topology, itinerant ferromagnetism, and unconventional superconductivity, across a wide range of platforms, from transition metal compounds, two-dimensional oxide heterostructures, and iron-based superconductors, to $p$-orbital ultracold gases. Ultimately, this $p$-$t_{2g}$ homology serves not only as a tool for interpretation but also as a robust design principle for engineering novel quantum states.

The optical response of two-dimensional (2D) materials has been customarily calculated ab initio using plane waves and without separating the most important orbitals contributions. In the family of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC) monolayers lacking inversion symmetry, we take advantage of the mostly d-orbital content of the Bloch bands around the semiconductor gap to reduce the calculation of the linear and quadratic optical susceptibilities to a very minimal model. Such a simple approach reproduces well first principles calculations and could be the starting point for the inclusion of many-body effects and spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in TMDCs with only a few energy bands in a numerically inexpensive way.

- **TL;DR**: 提出一种基于体积积分方程(VIE)的方法，用于高效计算自洽流体动力学模型(SC-HDM)的光学响应，克服了传统微分方程方法的计算瓶颈

Mesoscopic models of the optical response of metals have emerged as fundamental building blocks in quantum plasmonics, in principle overcoming the computational bottlenecks of ab initio techniques by implementing aspects of the atomistic description of the metal in otherwise classical calculations. Nonetheless, even these approaches are eventually hindered by demanding computations due to sophisticated material response. Here, this issue is addressed for the advanced Self-Consistent Hydrodynamic Drude Model (SC-HDM), which captures both nonlocal electron dynamics and electron spill-out, through a Volume Integral Equation (VIE) method. Adopting an IE-based method shifts perspective from the commonly employed Differential Equation (DE)-based ones, demonstrating significant computational efficiency. The VIE approach is a valuable methodological scaffold: It addresses SC-HDM and simpler models, but can also be adapted to more advanced ones. For spherical nanoparticles (NPs), using the inherent symmetries, similar performance for three increasingly complicated material models is achieved, breaking the taboo that increased sophistication in material response requires taxing simulations. Mesoscopic material-response functions can be readily extracted from the VIE implementation, thus circumventing the need for lengthy microscopic calculations. This method opens a new way of modeling quantum hydrodynamic NPs and will serve as essential benchmarking tool for recipes addressing more complicated geometries.

Inspired by previous works on epidemic-like processes in open quantum systems, we derive an elementary quantum epidemic model that is simple enough to be studied via Quantum Jump Monte Carlo simulations at reasonably large system sizes. We show how some weak symmetries of the Lindblad equation allow us to map the dynamics onto a classical Kinetic Monte Carlo; this simplified, effective dynamics can be described via local stochastic jumps coupled with a local deterministic component. Simulations are then used to reconstruct a phase diagram which displays stationary features completely equivalent to those of completely classical epidemic processes, but richer dynamics with multiple, recurrent waves of infection.

The equilibrium vacancy concentration in multi-principal element alloys remains a controversial and nontrivial subject, primarily because of chemical complexity and chemical short-range order (CSRO). Here we derive an exact expression that is amenable to atomistic calculations, using multiple perspectives. We applied this expression to equiatomic CrCoNi alloys in the face-centered cubic structure. The derived equilibrium vacancy concentration is used in our recent work, which predicts the chemical short-range order formation timescale consistent with experimental observation. The results demonstrate the practical utility of the approach for predicting equilibrium vacancy concentrations in compositionally complex alloys.

Polymers-macromolecular systems composed of repeating chemical units-constitute the molecular foundation of living organisms, while their synthetic counterparts drive transformative advances across medicine, consumer products, and energy technologies. While machine learning (ML) models have been trained on millions of quantum chemical atomistic simulations for materials and/or small molecular structures to enable efficient, accurate, and transferable predictions of chemical properties, polymers have largely not been included in prior datasets due to the computational expense of high quality electronic structure calculations on representative polymeric structures. Here, we address this shortcoming with the creation of the Open Polymers 2026 (OPoly26) dataset, which contains more than 6.57 million density functional theory (DFT) calculations on up to 360 atom clusters derived from polymeric systems, comprising over 1.2 billion total atoms. OPoly26 captures the chemical diversity that makes polymers intrinsically tunable and versatile materials, encompassing variations in monomer composition, degree of polymerization, chain architectures, and solvation environments. We show that augmenting ML model training with the OPoly26 dataset improves model performance for polymer prediction tasks. We also publicly release the OPoly26 dataset to help further the development of ML models for polymers, and more broadly, strive towards universal atomistic models.

The recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in pressurized nickelates has renewed interest in the broken-symmetry states of their ambient-pressure parent phases, where a density-wave (DW) order emerges and competes with superconductivity, but its microscopic origin remains unresolved. Using ultrafast optical spectroscopy, we track quasiparticle relaxation dynamics across the DW transition at $T_{\rm DW} \approx$ 136 K in trilayer nickelate La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ single crystals, revealing the opening of an energy gap of $\sim$ 52 meV. Multiple coherent phonons, including $A_g$ modes near 3.88, 5.28, and 2.09 THz, display pronounced mode-selective anomalies across the transition, demonstrating that the DW is coupled with lattice degree of freedom stabilized through electron-phonon coupling. At higher excitation densities, the DW is nonthermally suppressed, producing a temperature-fluence phase diagram that parallels pressure-tuned behavior. These results establish the DW in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ as a lattice-entangled instability involving multiple phonon modes, and highlight ultrafast optical excitation as a powerful tool to manipulate competing orders in nickelates.

We present a theory of the graphene nanoslide, a fundamental device for graphene straintronics that realizes a single pseudogauge barrier. We solve the scattering problem in closed form and demonstrate that the nanoslide gives rise to a hybrid pseudogauge and electrostatic cavity in the bipolar regime, and hosts one-dimensional transverse channels. The latter can be tuned using a bottom gate between valley chiral or counterpropagating modes, as well as one-dimensional flatbands. Hence, the local density of states near the barrier depends strongly on the gate voltage with a tunable sublattice and electron-hole asymmetry. In the presence of electron-electron interactions, the nanoslide allows for in-situ tuning between a chiral and ordinary Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid.

- **TL;DR**: Masgent是一个AI辅助的材料模拟代理平台，通过自然语言交互统一了结构操作、VASP输入生成、DFT工作流构建与分析、快速MLP模拟和轻量级机器学习工具，将设置时间从小时级缩短到秒级。

Density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning potentials (MLPs) are essential for predicting and understanding materials properties, yet preparing, executing, and analyzing these simulations typically requires extensive scripting, multi-step procedures, and significant high-performance computing (HPC) expertise. These challenges hinder reproducibility and slow down discovery. Here, we introduce Masgent, an AI-assisted materials simulation agent that unifies structure manipulation, automated VASP input generation, DFT workflow construction and analysis, fast MLP-based simulations, and lightweight machine learning (ML) utilities within a single platform. Powered by large language models (LLMs), Masgent enables researchers to perform complex simulation tasks through natural-language interaction, eliminating most manual scripting and reducing setup time from hours to seconds. By standardizing protocols and integrating advanced simulation and data-driven tools, Masgent democratizes access to state-of-the-art computational methodologies, accelerating hypothesis testing, pre-screening, and exploratory research for both new and experienced practitioners.

- **TL;DR**: 论文提出了一种新的复杂性度量——本征微观态熵（S_EM），该熵基于统计独立的本征微观态的概率计算。研究验证了其在平衡系统临界现象中的标度行为，并发现其在非平衡复杂系统中可作为相变的前兆信号：S_EM的显著增加预示着主要相变的发生。

We introduce the eigen microstate entropy ($S_{\text{EM}}$), a novel metric of complexity derived from the probabilities of statistically independent eigen microstates. After establishing its scaling behavior in equilibrium systems and demonstrating its utility in critical phenomena (mean spherical, Ising, and Potts models), we apply $S_{\text{EM}}$ to non-equilibrium complex systems. Our analysis reveals a consistent precursor signal: a significant increase in $S_{\text{EM}}$ precedes major phase transitions. Specifically, we observe this entropy rise before biomolecular condensate formation in liquid-liquid phase separation in living cells and months ahead of El Niño events. These findings position $S_{\text{EM}}$ as a general framework for detecting and interpreting phase transitions in non-equilibrium systems.

This work explores how phonon perturbations can induce the breaking of electronic degeneracies near the Fermi level and how this response can be interpreted from a chemical perspective through the SSAdNDP method. We apply this approach to a family of structurally similar yet electronically distinct hexagonal materials-MgB2, graphene, and hBN-to analyze how a single phonon mode simultaneously modifies the electronic structure (band dispersion) and the nature of chemical bonding (natural occupations and nodal patterns) in real space. Our results show that band splitting becomes physically relevant only when it is accompanied by an electronic redistribution, reflected in changes of the occupation numbers or bonding topology. Thus, SSAdNDP provides a direct bridge between reciprocal- and real-space representations, translating phenomena such as electron-phonon coupling into chemically intuitive reorganizations of multicenter bonds, and offering a unified framework to interpret vibrationally driven electronic effects in solids.

### Isotope Effects and the Negative Thermal Expansion Phenomena in Ice and Water

H2O is a unique substance with exceptional thermal properties arising from the subtle interplay between its electronic, phononic, and structural degrees of freedom. Of particular interest in H2O are the negative thermal expansion (NTE) phenomena, observed in its solid phase (ice) at low temperature, and in its liquid phase (water) near the freezing temperature. Furthermore, ice and water exhibit the abnormal volume isotope effect (VIE), where volume expansions occur when replacing H with its heavier isotope, deuterium (D). In order to capture more conceptual and intuitive understanding of intriguing NTE and VIE phenomena in ice and water, we have explored isotope effects in their NTE and melting properties by employing a type of Born-Oppenheimer-approximation approach and the Lindemann criterion. Our findings demonstrate that unusual isotope effects in these phenomena stem from competition between zero-point-energy phonons, thermal phonons, and the hydrogen bonding in H2O. All these components originate from nuclear quantum mechanical (QM) processes, revealing that QM physics plays a crucial role in the seemingly classical ice/water systems.

We present the combination of a complex-time tensor-network impurity solver with an analytic continuation scheme based on exponential fitting as an efficient framework for single and multi-orbital dynamical mean-field calculations. By performing time-evolution along a complex-time contour, the approach balances computational cost with the difficulty of spectral recovery, offering greater flexibility than methods confined to the real or imaginary axis. By complementing the complex-time evolution with an exponential fitting scheme, we faithfully extract real-time information at negligible cost. The resulting method obtains high-resolution spectra at a significantly lower computational cost than real-time evolution, offering a promising tool for ab initio studies of strongly correlated materials.

### Effects of electron-electron interaction and spin-orbit coupling on Andreev pair qubits in quantum dot Josephson junctions

We investigate the superconducting Anderson impurity model for interacting quantum dot Josephson junctions with spin-orbit coupling and a term accounting for tunnelling through higher-energy orbitals. These elements establish the conditions required for spin polarization in the absence of external magnetic field at finite superconducting phase bias. This Hamiltonian has been previously used to model the Andreev spin qubit, where quantum information is encoded in spinful odd-parity subgap states. Here we instead analyse the even-parity sector, i.e., the Andreev pair qubit based on Andreev bound states (ABS). The model is solved using the zero-bandwidth approximation and the numerical renormalization group, with further insight from variational calculations. Electron-electron interaction admixes single-occupancy Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) components into the ABS states, thereby strongly enhancing spin transitions in the presence of spin-orbit coupling. The ABS states can thus become sensitive to local magnetic field fluctuations, which has implications for decoherence in Andreev pair qubits. For strong interaction $U$, especially in the cross-over region between the ABS and YSR regimes for $U \sim 2Δ$, charge, spin, and inductive transitions can all become strong, offering avenues for spin control and quantum transduction.

We construct the first physics-informed neural-network (PINN) surrogates for relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) using a hybrid PDE and data-driven workflow. Instead of training for the conservative form of the equations, we work with Jacobians or PDE characteristics directly in terms of primitive variables. We further add to the trainable system the divergence-free condition, without the need of cleaning modes. Using a novel MUON optimizer implementation, we show that a baseline PINN trained on early-time snapshots can extrapolate RMHD dynamics in one and two spatial dimensions, and that posterior residual-guided networks can systematically reduce PDE violations.

### The Geometric Foundations of Microcanonical Thermodynamics: Entropy Flow Equation and Thermodynamic Equivalence

We develop a geometric foundation of microcanonical thermodynamics in which entropy and its derivatives are determined from the geometry of phase space, rather than being introduced through an a priori ensemble postulate. Once the minimal structure needed to measure constant -- energy manifolds is made explicit, the microcanonical measure emerges as the natural hypersurface measure on each energy shell. Thermodynamics becomes the study of how these shells deform with energy: the entropy is the logarithm of a geometric area, and its derivatives satisfy a deterministic hierarchy of entropy flow equations driven by microcanonical averages of curvature invariants (built from the shape/Weingarten operator and related geometric data). Within this framework, phase transitions correspond to qualitative reorganizations of the geometry of energy manifolds, leaving systematic signatures in the derivatives of the entropy.
  Two general structural consequences follow. First, we reveal a thermodynamic covariance: the reconstructed thermodynamics is invariant under arbitrary descriptive choices such as reparametrizations and equivalent representations of the same conserved dynamics. Second, a geometric microcanonical equivalence is found: microscopic realizations that share the same geometric content of their energy manifolds (in the sense of entering the curvature sources of the flow) necessarily yield the same microcanonical thermodynamics. We demonstrate the full practical power of the formalism by reconstructing microcanonical response and identifying criticality across paradigmatic systems, from exactly solvable mean-field models to genuinely nontrivial short-range lattice field theories and the 1D long-range XY model with $1/r^α$ interactions.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究使用激光驱动超快阻抗谱技术，通过THz场共振激发声子，探究声子对LLZO固态电解质中锂离子传导的动态作用机制。

Superionic conduction in solid-state materials is governed not only by static factors, such as structure and composition, but also by dynamic interactions between the mobile ion and the crystal lattice. Specifically, the dynamics of lattice vibrations, or phonons, have attracted interest because of their hypothesized ability to facilitate superionic conduction. However, direct experimental measurement of the role of phonons in ionic conduction is challenging due to the fast intrinsic timescales of ion hopping and the difficulty of driving relevant phonon modes, which often lie in the low-energy THz regime. To overcome these limitations, we use laser-driven ultrafast impedance spectroscopy (LUIS). LUIS resonantly excites phonons using a THz field and probes ion hopping with picosecond time resolution. We apply LUIS to understand the dynamical role of phonons in $Li_7La_3Zr_2O_{12}$ (LLZO). When in its cubic phase (c-LLZO), this garnet-type solid electrolyte has an ionic conductivity two orders of magnitude greater than its tetragonal phase (t-LLZO). T-LLZO is characterized by an ordered and filled $Li^+$ sublattice necessitating synchronous ion hopping. In contrast, c-LLZO is characterized by a disordered and vacancy-rich $Li^+$ sublattice, and has a conduction mechanism dominated by single hops. We find that, upon excitation of phonons in the 0.5-7.5 THz range, the impedance of t-LLZO experiences a longer ion hopping decay signal in comparison to c-LLZO. The results suggest that phonon-mediated ionic conduction by THz modes may lead to larger ion displacements in ordered and fully occupied mobile ion sublattices as opposed to those that are disordered and vacancy-rich. Overall, this work highlights the interplay between static and dynamic factors that enables improved ionic conductivity in otherwise poorly conducting inorganic solids.

Hybrid semiconductor-superconductor qubits have recently emerged as a promising alternative to traditional platforms, combining material advantages with device-level tunability. A defining feature is their gate-tunable Josephson coupling, enabling superconducting qubit architectures with full electric-field control and offering a path toward scalable, low-crosstalk quantum processors. This approach seeks to merge benefits of superconducting and semiconductor qubits, for instance by encoding quantum information in the spin of a quasiparticle occupying an Andreev bound state, thus combining long coherence times with fast, flexible control. Progress has accelerated through bottom-up engineering of Andreev states in coupled quantum dot arrays, leading to architectures such as minimal Kitaev chains hosting Majorana zero modes. In parallel, Hamiltonian-protected designs aim to enhance resilience against local noise and decoherence by exploiting superconducting phase dynamics and discrete charge or flux degrees of freedom. This article reviews recent theoretical and experimental advances in hybrid qubits, providing an overview of physical mechanisms, device implementations, and emerging architectures, with emphasis on their potential for (topologically) protected quantum information processing. While many designs remain at proof-of-concept stage, rapid progress suggests practical demonstrations may soon be achievable.

- **TL;DR**: 电子系统在强磁场中表现出Pomeranchuk效应，即费米液体态固化为电子固体，与常规电子系统相反，并在超高磁场中出现再入液体态。

The Pomeranchuk effect is a counterintuitive phenomenon where liquid helium-3 (3He) solidifies under specific pressures, not when cooled, but when heated. This behaviour originates from the magnetic entropy of nuclear spins, suggesting a magnetic field should influence it. However, its detailed response to magnetic fields remains elusive due to the small nuclear magneton of 3He and lack of analogous fermion systems. Here, we show that an electron system also exhibit the Pomeranchuk effect, where the Fermi liquid state solidifies in a high magnetic field, unlike conventional electron systems where a field melts an electron solid into a metal. Remarkably, the electron system displays a reentrant liquid state in ultrahigh fields. These responses are explained by changes in magnetic entropy and magnetisation, extending the underlying physics to 3He. Our findings clarify magnetic-field impact on the Pomeranchuk effect and open avenues for magnetic control of chemical interactions.

### Efficient population transfer in a quantum dot exciton under phonon-induced decoherence via shortcuts to adiabaticity

In the present study, we apply shortcut to adiabaticity pulses (time-dependent Rabi frequency and detuning) for the efficient population transfer from the ground to the exciton state in a GaAs/InGaAs quantum dot with phonon-induced dephasing. We use the time-evolving matrix product operator (TEMPO) method to propagate system in time and find that, for temperatures below $ 20 \ \text{K} $ and pulse duration up to $ 10 \ \text{ps} $, a very good transfer efficiency is obtained in general. We explain these results using a Bloch-like equation derived from a generalized Lindblad equation, which adequately describes system dynamics at lower temperatures. For higher temperatures, the transfer efficiency is significantly reduced except for subpicosecond pulses, where the shortcut Rabi frequency reduces to a delta pulse attaining a fast population inversion. The present work is expected to find application in quantum technologies which exploit quantum dots for single-photon generation on demand.

- **TL;DR**: 提出基于切比雪夫多项式的算法，高效稳定地计算高阶指数差分，支持动态节点集更新，时间复杂度为O(qN)。

Exponential divided differences arise in numerical linear algebra, matrix-function evaluation, and quantum Monte Carlo simulations, where they serve as kernel weights for time evolution and observable estimation. Efficient and numerically stable evaluation of high-order exponential divided differences for dynamically evolving node sets remains a significant computational challenge. We present a Chebyshev-polynomial-based algorithm that addresses this problem by combining the Chebyshev-Bessel expansion of the exponential function with a direct recurrence for Chebyshev divided differences. The method achieves a computational cost of ${\cal O}(qN)$, where $q$ is the divided-difference order and $N$ is the Chebyshev truncation length. We show that $N$ scales linearly with the spectral width through the decay of modified Bessel coefficients, while the dependence on $q$ enters only through structural polynomial constraints. We further develop an incremental update scheme for dynamic node sets that enables the insertion or removal of a single node in ${\cal O}(N)$ time when the affine mapping interval is held fixed. A full \texttt{C++} reference implementation of the algorithms described in this work is publicly available.

Lorentz lattice gases (LLGs) are discrete-time transport models in which a point particle moves ballistically between lattice sites and is scattered by randomly placed, quenched local scatterers such as ``rotators'' or ``mirrors.'' Despite the elementary update rules, LLGs exhibit rich dynamical regimes: typically, trajectories close quickly and the distribution of loop lengths has exponential tails, but at special concentrations of scatterers one observes critical behavior with scale-free statistics and fractal geometry. This survey focuses on the critical behavior of closed trajectories in two-dimensional LLGs, starting from the numerical study of Cao and Cohen, and its relation to percolation-hull scaling and kinetic hull-generating walks. We highlight the scaling hypothesis for loop-length distributions, the emergence of critical exponents $τ=15/7$, $d_f=7/4$, and $σ=3/7$ in several universality classes, and the appearance of alternative exponents in partially occupied models.

- **TL;DR**: CoI₂作为Kitaev材料候选者，具有强键依赖挫败和弱几何挫败特性，通过Mg部分替代Co可抑制几何挫败，使Co₂/₃Mg₁/₃I₂更接近量子自旋液体态。

Kitaev materials are of great interest due to their potential in realizing quantum spin liquid (QSL) states and applications in topological quantum computing. In the pursuit of realizing Kitaev QSL, a Mott insulator with strong bond-dependent frustration and weak geometric frustration is highly desirable. Here we explore Kitaev physics in the van der Waals triangular antiferromagnet (AF) CoI$_2$, through the spin-orbital states and Wannier function analyses, exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group study of the electronic structure and magnetic properties. We find that the high-spin Co$^{2+}$ ion is in the $J_\mathrm{eff}=1/2$ state because of strong spin-orbit coupling, and the weak trigonal elongation and crystal field contribute to the observed weak in-plane magnetic anisotropy. The strong $t_{2g}$-$e_g$ hopping via the strong Co 3$d$-I 5$p$ hybridization gives rise to a strong Kitaev interaction ($K_1$) at the first nearest neighbors (1NN), and the long Co-Co distance and the weak $t_{2g}$-$t_{2g}$ hoppings determine a weak Heisenberg interaction $J_1$. The resultant $|K_1/J_1|$ = 6.63 confirms a strong bond-dependent frustration, while the geometric frustration due to the 3NN Heisenberg interaction $J_3$ gets involved, and they all together result in the experimental helical AF order in CoI$_2$. We then propose to suppress the $J_3$ using a partial Mg substitution for Co, and indeed we find that Co$_{2/3}$Mg$_{1/3}$I$_2$ has the much reduced geometric frustration but hosts the robust bond-dependent frustration, and thus it would be a promising Kitaev material being so far closest to the QSL state.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文发现了一种新的非平衡标度律：在虚时间演化中，角纠缠熵随虚时间对数线性增长，仅由量子临界点的普适类决定，为高效提取普适纠缠信息提供了新方法。

Characterizing universal entanglement features in higher-dimensional quantum matter is a central goal of quantum information science and condensed matter physics. While the subleading corner terms in two-dimensional quantum systems encapsulate essential universal information of the underlying conformal field theory, our understanding of these features remains remarkably limited compared to their one-dimensional counterparts. We address this challenge by investigating the entanglement dynamics of fermionic systems along the imaginary-time evolution. We uncover a pioneering non-equilibrium scaling law where the corner entanglement entropy grows linearly with the logarithm of imaginary time, dictated solely by the universality class of the quantum critical point. Through unbiased Quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we verify this scaling in the interacting Gross-Neveu-Yukawa model, demonstrating that universal data can be accurately recovered from the early stages of relaxation. Our findings significantly circumvent the computational bottlenecks inherent in reaching full equilibrium convergence. This work establishes a direct link between the fundamental theory of non-equilibrium critical phenomena and the high-precision determination of universal entanglement properties on both classical and quantum platforms, paving the way for probing the rich entanglement structure of quantum critical systems.

We systematically investigate the emergence of electronic crystal phases in rhombohedral multilayer graphene using comprehensive self-consistent Hartree Fock calculations combined with \textit{ab initio} tight binding model. As the carrier density increases, we uncover an isospin cascade sequence of phase transitions that gives rise to a rich variety of ordered states, including electronic crystal phases with non-zero Chern numbers. We further show the nearly degeneracy of these topological electronic crystals hosting extended quantum anomalous Hall effect (EQAH) in the mean field regime and characterize pressure driven phase transitions. Finally, we discuss the thermodynamic signatures, particularly the behavior of the inverse compressibility, in light of recent experimental observations.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种用于两相扩散问题的时空扩展保守笛卡尔切割单元有限体积法，适用于规定运动几何体中的多相输运问题。

We present a space-time extension of a conservative Cartesian cut-cell finite-volume method for two-phase diffusion in prescribed-motion geometries. The formulation follows a two-fluid approach: one scalar field is solved in each phase with discontinuous material properties, coupled by sharp interface conditions enforcing flux continuity and jump laws. To handle moving boundaries on a fixed Cartesian grid, the discrete balance is written over phase-restricted space-time control volumes, whose geometric moments (swept volumes and apertures) are used as weights in the finite-volume operators. This construction naturally accounts for the creation and destruction of cut cells (fresh/dead-cell events) and yields strict discrete conservation. The resulting scheme retains the algebraic structure of the static cut-cell formulation while incorporating motion through local geometric weights and interface coupling operators. A series of verification and validation tests in two and three dimensions demonstrate super-linear accuracy in space, robust behavior under repeated topology changes and conservation across strong coefficient jumps and moving interfaces. The proposed space-time cut-cell framework provides a conservative building block for multiphase transport in evolving geometries and a foundation for future free-boundary extensions such as Stefan-type phase change.

### Renormalization group approach to graphene bilayers

- **TL;DR**: 使用非微扰重整化群方法研究双层石墨烯的热涨落效应，发现有效弯曲刚度在重整化群流中存在从双层耦合主导到单层独立主导的交叉行为。

We investigate the effects of thermal fluctuations in graphene bilayers by means of a nonperturbative renormalization group (NPRG) approach, following the pioneering work of Mauri et al. [Phys. Rev. B 102, 165421 (2020)] based on a self-consistent screening approximation (SCSA). We consider a model of two continuum polymerized membranes, separated by a distance $\ell$, in their flat phase, coupled by interlayer shear, compression/dilatation and elastic terms. Within a controlled truncation of the effective average action, we retain only the contributions that generate a pronounced crossover of the effective bending rigidity along the renormalization group flow between two regimes: at high running scale $k$, the rigidity is dominated by the in-plane elastic properties, with $κ_{\mathrm{eff}}\sim \ell^{2}(λ+2μ)/2$, whereas at low $k$ it is controlled by the bending rigidity of two independent monolayers, $κ_{\mathrm{eff}}\sim 2κ$. This crossover is reminiscent of that observed by Mauri et al. as a function of the wavevector scale $q$, but here it is obtained within a renormalization group framework. This has several advantages. First, although approximations are performed, the NPRG approach allows one, in principle, to take into account all nonlinearities present in the elastic theory, in contrast to the SCSA treatment which requires, already at the formal level, significant simplifications. Second, it demonstrates that the bilayer problem can be treated as a straightforward extension of the monolayer case, with flow equations that keep the same structure and differ only by bilayer-specific adjustments. Third, unlike the SCSA, the NPRG framework admits a controlled, systematically improvable, hierarchy of approximations.

Understanding and controlling the chemical states both in the bulk and at the interfaces of complex oxide thin films is essential for engineering a wide range of electronic, optical, and magnetic functionalities, which arise through emergent phenomena such as two-dimensional electron gases, interfacial magnetism, and associated phase transitions. Here, we demonstrate the use of in situ Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) as a powerful tool for probing oxidation states and dynamic chemical processes during the growth of complex oxide heterostructures. By leveraging the chemical sensitivity of AES to subtle changes in valence electron populations, we show that this technique can distinguish distinct oxidation states in multivalent perovskite manganate and vanadate systems with high fidelity during deposition. Furthermore, we show evidence for dynamic chemical phenomena, specifically charge transfer processes at the polar-nonpolar LaMnO3/SrTiO3 interface. Our results establish in situ AES as a powerful diagnostic tool for monitoring and controlling interfacial chemistry during thin film growth, offering a pathway toward the atomic-scale engineering of chemical states in functional oxide heterostructures.

### Detuning the Floquet anomalous chiral spin liquid

At high-frequency a periodically-driven quantum spin-1/2 system can emulate a chiral spin liquid (CSL) described by an effective static local chiral hamiltonian. In contrast, at low-frequency {\it anomalous} CSL can be realized in Swap Models, in which one-way spin transport occurs at the edge although the bulk time-evolution operator over one period is trivial. In this work we explicitly construct a family of Floquet quantum spin-1/2 models on the square lattice implementing Swap Models to investigate the stability of the anomalous CSL under frequency detuning and the transition to the high-frequency regime. We have used the average-energy spectrum on finite-size torus and cylinders to unfold the Floquet quasi-energy spectrum over the whole frequency range and obtain the geometrical Berry phases. This enabled us to identify three regimes upon increasing detuning: i) a finite-size regime (with no folding of the Floquet spectrum), ii) an intermediate (narrow) regime with folding and very few resonances and iii) a regime with an increased density of resonances suggesting heating. At small detuning, edge modes are revealed by spectroscopic tools and from the diamagnetic response of the system giving access to the anomalous winding number. The analysis of all the data suggests that the anomalous CSL is not continuously connected to the high-frequency CSL. We also discuss the possible occurrence of a long-lived prethermal anomalous CSL.

We predict a new class of topological electronic crystals in bilayer graphene-Mott insulator heterostructures. Interlayer charge transfer creates a charge neutral electron hole bilayer, in which itinerant carriers in graphene interact attractively with localized carriers from a flat Hubbard band. In the heavy fermion limit and dilute limit, this interplay leads to symmetry breaking crystalline phases stabilized not only by pure repulsion, but also by interlayer Coulomb attraction shaped by band topology. Using comprehensive Hartree Fock calculations, we uncover triangular, honeycomb, and kagome charge orders hosting different quantized anomalous Hall effects at moderate interlayer attraction.

### PINNs for Electromagnetic Wave Propagation

- **TL;DR**: 该研究提出了一种混合训练策略，使物理信息神经网络在电磁波传播问题中达到与FDTD相当的精度和能量守恒性。

Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are a methodology that aims to solve physical systems by directly embedding PDE constraints into the neural network training process. In electromagnetism, where well-established methodologies such as FDTD and FEM already exist, new methodologies are expected to provide clear advantages to be accepted. Despite their mesh-free nature and applicability to inverse problems, PINNs can exhibit deficiencies in terms of accuracy and energy metrics when compared to FDTD solutions. This study demonstrates hybrid training strategies can bring PINNs closer to FDTD-level accuracy and energy consistency.
  This study presents a hybrid methodology addressing common challenges in wave propagation scenarios. The causality collapse problem in time-dependent PINN training is addressed via time marching and causality-aware weighting. In order to mitigate the discontinuities that are introduced by time marching, a two-stage interface continuity loss is applied. In order to suppress loss accumulation, which is manifested as cumulative energy drift in electromagnetic waves, a local Poynting-based regularizer has been developed.
  In the developed PINN model, high field accuracy is achieved with an average 0.09\% $NRMSE$ and 1.01\% $L^2$ error over time. Energy conservation is achieved on the PINN side with only a 0.024\% relative energy mismatch in the 2D PEC cavity scenario. Training is performed without labeled field data, using only physics-based residual losses; FDTD is used solely for post-training evaluation. The results demonstrate that PINNs can achieve competitive results with FDTD in canonical electromagnetic examples and are a viable alternative.

We establish universal scaling laws and quantify aging in three-dimensional uniformly heated hard sphere granular gases through large-scale event-driven molecular dynamics ($N=500{,}000$). We report three primary quantitative discoveries: (i) The characteristic energy decay time exhibits a universal inverse scaling $τ_0 \propto ε^{-1.03 \pm 0.02}$ with the dissipation parameter $ε= 1 - e^2$. (ii) The steady-state temperature follows a precise power-law $T_{\mathrm{steady}} \propto ε^{-1.51 \pm 0.03}$, reflecting the non-linear balance between thermostat heating and collisional dissipation. (iii) The velocity autocorrelation function $\bar{A}(τ_w, τ)$ demonstrates pronounced aging, with decay rates $λ$ following a power-law slowing down $λ(τ_w) \propto τ_w^{-0.82 \pm 0.05}$. These results establish the first 3D quantitative benchmarks for aging in driven dissipative gases, where near-Gaussian statistics persist despite extreme structural clustering.

We report a molecular dynamics investigation of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) adsorption at the aqueous-biochar interface using experimentally constrained woody biochar models representative of softwood-derived biochars produced at 400, 600 and 800 $°$C. The models reproduce experimental descriptors (H/C, O/C, aromaticity, true density, and surface functionality) of their experimental counterparts, and simulations enable calculation of adsorption isotherms that align with available experimental measurements. Our results reveal that 2,4-D$^{-}$ uptake is governed by a synergy of three interaction classes: (i) $π$-$π$ and $π$-Cl contacts with graphitic domains with either parallel or perpendicular alignments, (ii) polar interactions including H-bonding to surface -OH and other oxygen-containing groups, and (iii) Na$^{+}$-mediated cation bridging that links 2,4-D$^{-}$ anion to surface oxygens, that would have an increasing relevance for biochars near or above the pH at point of zero charge. Notably, we found that low-temperature produced biochars, which retain higher densities of surface O functionalities, exhibit higher adsorption per unit surface area due to cooperative polar interactions alongside $π$-$π$ binding, whereas medium-to-high temperature biochars rely more on $π$-$π$ and cation-bridging mechanisms. The distinct adsorption distances measured emphasize surface heterogeneity and porosity. Taken together, these atomistic insights corroborate experimental observations and yield actionable guidance for the rational design of biochars for remediation of anionic herbicides, highlighting how surface functionality and solution chemistry can be tuned to optimize sorption. Our approach provides a general framework to interrogate pollutant-biochar interactions and to inform remediation strategies.

The experimental discovery of fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) states in tunable moiré superlattices has sparked intense interest in exploring the interplay between topological order and symmetry breaking phases. In this paper, we present a comprehensive numerical study of this interplay through large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations on a minimal two-band lattice model of twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ at filling $ν=-2/3$. We find robust FQAH ground states and provide clear numerical evidences for anyon excitations with fractional charge and pronounced real-space density modulations, directly supporting the recently proposed anyon density-wave halo picture. We also map out the displacement field dependent phase diagram, uncovering a rich landscape of charge ordered states emerging from the FQAH, including a quantum anomalous Hall crystal (QAHC) with an integer quantized Hall conductance. We expect our work to inspire further research interest of intertwined correlated topological phases in moiré systems.

Topologically protected edge channels show prospects for quantum devices. They have been found experimentally in two-dimensional (2D) quantum spin Hall insulators (QSHIs), weak topological insulators and higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs), but the number of materials realizing these topologies is still quite limited. Here, we provide evidence for topological edge states within a novel topology named three-dimensional (3D) QSHIs. Its topology originates solely from a nonzero $S_z$ spin Chern number for each $k_z$ plane of the crystal and is realized in bulk $α$-Bi$_4$I$_4$ with trivial symmetry indicators, as we show by density functional theory calculations. We experimentally observe the related edge states at each type of monolayer and bilayer step of this material by scanning tunneling microscopy. Consistently, the edge states are neither interrupted, nor backscattered by defects at the step edges corroborating their helical character as expected from the nontrivial topology. Furthermore, two individual edge channels are directly observed at bilayer steps without visible interaction gap opening, demonstrating the robustness of these edge modes against vertical stacking. Our results establish $α$-Bi$_4$I$_4$ as the first material realization of a 3D QSHI whose definition goes beyond the scope of topological symmetry indicators, and provide a pathway for realizing nearly-quantized spin Hall conductivity per unit cell in a bulk crystal.

MulAtoLEG (Multi-Atom Liouville Equation Generator) is an open-source Mathematica package for generating Liouville superoperators and Liouville equations, specialized for multilevel atomic systems comprising an arbitrary number of atoms. This scheme is based on an extension to multilevel atomic systems, originally developed by Lehmberg [R. H. Lehmberg, Phys. Rev. A 2, 883 (1970)] as an adjoint master equation for ensembles of two-level emitters and later reformulated by Genes [M. Reitz, C. Sommer and C. Genes, PRX Quantum 3, 010201 (2022)] as a master equation. The package facilitates the generation of equations for complex transition configurations in alkali atoms. Although primarily designed for atomic systems, it can also generate the master and adjoint master equations for general Hamiltonians and Lindbladians. In addition, it includes functionalities to construct the differential equations in the dressed-state basis, where, in many cases, the non-unitary evolution operator can be determined explicitly. To maximize computational efficiency, the package leverages Mathematica's vectorization and sparse linear algebra capabilities. Since MulAtoLEG produces exact equations without approximations, the feasible system size is naturally limited by the available computational resources.

We investigate the dynamics of a run-and-tumble particle in a double-well potential and demonstrate that, in stark contrast to Brownian particles, active dynamics can lead to strong ergodicity breaking. When the barrier height exceeds a critical threshold, the long-time position distribution depends crucially on the initial condition: if the particle starts within the basin of attraction of one well, it remains trapped there, while if it begins between the two basins, it can reach either well with a finite probability, which we compute exactly via hitting probabilities. Below the critical barrier height, ergodicity is restored and the system converges to a unique stationary distribution, which we derive analytically. Using this result, we also estimate the characteristic barrier crossing time and show that it violates Kramer's-Arrhenius law, and displays a divergence near the critical height following a Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann-like form with an anomalous exponent $1/2$.

- **TL;DR**: 研究了Fe65Co35薄膜各向异性磁电阻的温度依赖性，发现AMR比值随电流方向变化，室温下硬轴方向达0.16%，通过Stoner-Wohlfarth模型提取磁各向异性常数，证明可通过调控晶体取向和温度设计可调灵敏度磁传感器。

In this work, we study the anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) behavior of [001] epitaxial Fe65Co35 thin films along different crystallographic directions as a function of temperature. The AMR ratio is found to strongly depend on the current orientation relative to the crystal axes, reaching 0.16 % and 0.10 % at room temperature when the current is applied along the magnetic hard and easy axes, respectively. Moreover, the AMR ratio decreases at different rates as the temperature is reduced to 80 K. The longitudinal and transverse magnetoresistance curves were fitted using the Stoner-Wohlfarth formalism to describe the magnetization reversal path and to extract the magnetic anisotropy constants. The fitted cubic and uniaxial anisotropy constants are Kc = -2.36 kJ/m3 and Ku = 2.18 kJ/m3, verifying the change in the cubic anisotropy compared to Fe-richer Fe100-xCox compositions. These results demonstrate that by tailoring the crystalline orientation and temperature dependence of AMR, epitaxial Fe65Co35 thin films can enable the design of magnetic sensors with tunable sensitivity.

We present a diffuse neutron and x-ray scattering study of structural, spin- and charge-density-wave fluctuations in the electrical insulator La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_4$. This lamellar nickelate is an isostructural analogue of the high-temperature cuprate superconductor La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$, for which recent experiments uncovered evidence for unusual structural and superconducting fluctuations indicative of rare-region physics due to inherent inhomogeneity unrelated to common point disorder effects. We find closely analogous nanoscale orthorhombic fluctuation behavior in La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_4$, including exponential scaling of the diffuse scattering intensity and power-law scaling of the characteristic length with relative temperature. Moreover, our neutron and x-ray scattering data reveal similar behavior for short-range magnetic and charge fluctuations above the respective ordering temperatures. These observations indicate that rare-region effects are a generic feature of perovskite-related structures and lead to universal fluctuations of both structural and electronic degrees of freedom over extended temperature ranges.

Altermagnetism simultaneously possesses nonrelativistic spin responses and zero net magnetization, thus combining advantages of ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. This superiority originates from its unique dual feature, i.e., opposite-magnetic sublattices in real space and alternating spin polarization in momentum space enforced by the same crystal symmetry. Therefore, the determination of an altermagnetic order and its unique spin response inherently necessitates atomic-scale spin-resolved measurements in real and momentum spaces, an experimental milestone yet to be achieved. Here, via utilizing the helical edge (hinge) modes of a higher order topological insulator as the spin sensor, we realize spin-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy which enables us to pin down the dual-space feature of a layered $d$-wave altermagnet, KV$_2$Se$_2$O. In real space, atomic-registered mapping demonstrates the checkerboard antiferromagnetic order together with density-wave lattice modulation, and in momentum space, spin-resolved spectroscopic imaging provides a direct visualization of d-wave spin splitting of the band structure. Critically, using this new topology-guaranteed spin filter we directly reveal the unidirectional, spin-polarized quasiparticle excitations originating from the crystal symmetry-paired X and Y valleys around opposite magnetic sublattices simultaneously --the unique spin response for $d$-wave altermagnetism. Our experiments establish a solid basis for the exploration and utilization of altermagnetism in layered materials and further facilitate access to atomic-scale spin sensing and manipulating of 2D quantum materials.

- **TL;DR**: 通过添加1纳米Cu种子层，在≤2纳米自由层厚度下实现5-7%的高GMR比，为自旋轨道力矩器件提供高信号读取方案

Emerging spin-orbit-torque devices based on spin valves require an ultrathin (e.g., $\lesssim$2 nm) magnetic free layer to maximize the torque per moment. However, reducing the free-layer thickness deteriorates the giant magnetoresistance (GMR) signal for electrical readout. Here, we demonstrate that the addition of a 1-nm Cu seed layer enables high GMR ratios of 5-7% at free-layer thicknesses of $\lesssim$2 nm by promoting high-quality, textured growth of spin valves. Our work offers a pathway for engineering high-signal GMR readout in spin-orbit-torque digital memories and neuromorphic computers.

We present a symbolic implementation of recursion method for the dynamics of strongly correlated fermions on one-, two- and three-dimensional lattices. Focusing on two paradigmatic models, interacting spinless fermions and the Hubbard model, we first directly confirm that the universal operator growth hypothesis holds for interacting fermionic systems, manifested by the linear growth of Lanczos coefficients. Equipped with symbolically computed Lanczos coefficients and knowledge of their asymptotics, we are able to compute infinite-temperature autocorrelation functions up to times long enough for thermalization to occur. In turn, the knowledge of autocorrelation functions unlocks transport properties. We compute with high precision the charge diffusion constant over a broad range of interaction strengths, $V$. Surprisingly, we observe that these results are well described by a simple functional dependence $\sim 1/V^2$ universally valid both for small and large $V$. All results are obtained directly in the thermodynamic limit. Our results highlight the promise of symbolic computational paradigm where the most costly step is performed once and outputs symbolic results that can further be used multiple times to easily compute physical quantities for specific values of model parameters.

Deformable and flexible electronics have garnered significant attention due to their distinctive properties; however, their current applications are primarily limited to the thermoelectric domain. Expanding the range of these electronics and their application scope represents a pivotal trend in their development. In this work, a plastic inorganic semiconductor material, Sn2BiS2I3, with a band gap of 1.2 eV was synthesized and fabricated into a three-electrode flexible and portable electronic tongue capable of detecting heavy metal elements. The electronic tongue device exhibits exceptional linearity and demonstrates resistance against interference from impurity ions. The linear regression equation is expressed as Y=0.24+19.06X, yielding a linear coefficient of approximately 0.96, and the detectable limit stands at around 1.1 ppb, surpassing the 2.0 ppb limit of the ICP-AES instrument. Furthermore, mechanical testing reveals the favorable plasticity of Sn2BiS2I3, as evidenced by the absence of cracks during nanoindentation. The indentation hardness of Sn2BiS2I3 is approximately 1.67 GPa, slightly exceeding the hardness of Cu, which is 1.25 GPa. This study expands the repertoire of deformable and flexible electronics, offering a new and exceptional choice for biomimetic tongue sensor materials.

### Non-Invertible Interfaces Between Symmetry-Enriched Critical Phases

- **TL;DR**: 该论文提出通过空间界面而非边界来区分不同的无能隙量子相，证明了当两个1+1维共形场论在对称性荷分配上不同时，它们之间的对称性保持界面必然流向不可逆缺陷，并以Ising CFT为例进行了完整分类。

Gapless quantum phases can become distinct when internal symmetries are enforced, in analogy with gapped symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. However, this distinction does not always lead to protected edge modes, raising the question of how the bulk-boundary correspondence is generalized to gapless cases. We propose that the spatial interface between gapless phases -- rather than their boundaries -- provides a more robust fingerprint. We show that whenever two 1+1d conformal field theories (CFTs) differ in symmetry charge assignments of local operators or twisted sectors, any symmetry-preserving spatial interface between the theories must flow to a non-invertible defect. We illustrate this general result for different versions of the Ising CFT with $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2^T$ symmetry, obtaining a complete classification of allowed conformal interfaces. When the Ising CFTs differ by nonlocal operator charges, the interface hosts 0+1d symmetry-breaking phases with finite-size splittings scaling as $1/L^3$, as well as continuous phase transitions between them. For general gapless phases differing by an SPT entangler, the interfaces between them can be mapped to conformal defects with a certain defect 't Hooft anomaly. This classification also gives implications for higher-dimensional examples, including symmetry-enriched variants of the 2+1d Ising CFT. Our results establish a physical indicator for symmetry-enriched criticality through symmetry-protected interfaces, giving a new handle on the interplay between topology and gapless phases.

- **TL;DR**: 在GaN波导中观察到极化激元连续谱束缚态(BIC)，通过增加泵浦功率实现极化激元激光，并在BIC处形成亮孤子

We study polaritonic bound states in the continuum (BIC) created in GaN waveguides. The existence of symmetry-protected BICs is confirmed by the suppression of light emission and the observation of a polarization vortex in momentum space. Upon increasing the pumping, polariton population accumulates at the BIC and we observe polariton lasing from the blueshifted BIC states. The assessment of the polariton BIC emission energy and of its momentum broadening as a function of pumping power, i.e. of polariton density, indicates the formation of a bright soliton above the lasing threshold. Soliton formation at the BIC is induced by the combination of negative mass BIC and of repulsive polariton-polariton interactions.

We demonstrate anisotropic photostriction in two-dimensional orthorhombic semiconductors using time-dependent density functional theory. By tracing the dynamics of photoexcited carriers, we establish a quantitative link between carrier density and lattice deformation in layered black phosphorus and germanium selenides. The structural response exhibits significant anisotropy, featuring lattice expansion along the armchair direction and contraction along the zigzag direction, which is attributed to the interplay between charge redistribution and intrinsic lattice anisotropy. Both the magnitude and orientation of the photostrictive strains can be tuned by photodoping densities, enabling precise control over the photoinduced response. Notably, the photoinduced strains significantly increase carrier recombination lifetimes by suppressing nonradiative recombination, primarily due to the enlarged bandgap and weakened nonadiabatic coupling. These results provide microscopic insight into the origin of anisotropic photostriction in low-dimensional systems and lay the groundwork for light-controllable, directionally sensitive optomechanical devices at the atomic scale.

### Real-time Observation of Thermal Surface Recovery in $SrVO_3$

$SrVO_3$ (SVO), a model correlated metal and a promising transparent conducting oxide, develops a several-nanometer-thick near-surface region (NSR), rich in $V^{5+}$ species under ambient conditions. This oxidized layer obscures the intrinsic correlated-metallic $V^{4+}$ character and limits both fundamental studies of the physics and the material's integration into electronic devices. Here, we demonstrate a direct and controllable approach for recovering the metallic SVO surface by thermally reducing the NSR under ultra-high vacuum. Real-time in-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) reveals a sharp transformation from a $V^{5+}$-dominated surface to mixed valence states, dominated by $V^{4+}$, and a recovery of its metallic character. Ex-situ X-ray diffraction (XRD), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (HR-SEM) suggest that this transformation is accompanied by mass redistribution and partial oxygen loss, leading to nanoscale surface reorganization and modest lattice expansion. While thermodynamic considerations motivate evaluation of a $V_2O_5$ volatilization pathway, the combined experimental evidence instead points toward a predominantly structural surface reorganization. These findings establish a practical method for obtaining predominantly $V^{4+}$ SVO surfaces without protective capping layers, a capability that expands the utility of SVO for advanced spectroscopies, interface engineering, and oxide-electronics device integration.

### Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect in Ferromagnetic Metals

The quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect holds fundamental importance in topological physics and technological promise for electronics. It is generally believed that the QAH effect can only be realized in insulators. In this Letter, we theoretically demonstrate that the QAH effect can also be realized in metallic systems, representing a phase distinct from the conventional QAH phase in insulators. This phase is characterized by the coexistence of chiral edge channels and isotropic bulk conduction channels without a bulk energy gap. Notably, in a six-terminal Hall bar, our calculations show that, the quantized Hall conductivity and nonzero longitudinal conductivity can emerge due to dephasing, despite the Hall resistivity itself never becoming quantized. Furthermore, the quantized Hall conductivity exhibits remarkable robustness against disorder. Our findings not only extend the range of materials capable of hosting the QAH effect from insulators to metals, but also provide insights that may pave the way for the experimental realization of the QAH effect at elevated temperatures.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了Altermagnetism的基本引理(FLAM)，基于位点对称群和半子群推导了磁性材料中altermagnetic相存在的精确条件，并提出了新的Alterferrimagnets(AFiMs)概念。

Recent years have seen a proliferation in investigations on Altermagnetism due to its exciting prospects both from an applications perspective and theoretical standpoint. Traditionally, altermagnets are distinguished from collinear antiferromagnets using the central concept of halving subgroups within the spin space group formalism. In this work, we propose the Fundamental Lemma of Altermagnetism (FLAM) deriving the exact conditions required for the existence of altermagnetic phase in a magnetic material on the basis of site-symmetry groups and halving subgroups for a given crystallographic space group. The spin group formalism further clubs ferrimagnetism with ferromagnetism since the same-spin and opposite-spin sublattices lose their meaning in the presence of multiple magnetic species. As a consequence of FLAM, we further propose a class of fully compensated ferrimagnets, termed as Alterferrimagnets (AFiMs), which can show alternating momentum-dependent spin-polarized non-relativistic electronic bands within the first Brillouin zone. We show that alterferrimagnetism is a generalization of traditional collinear altermagnetism where multiple magnetic species are allowed to coexist forming fully compensated magnetic-sublattices, each with individual up-spin and down-spin sublattices.

We investigate the effect of Ce$^{3+}$ substitution on the magnetic ordering and phonon dynamics of the GdCrO$_3$ orthorhombic perovskite. The Ce doped compound exhibits long-range canted antiferromagnetism with Neel transitions, T$_N$ at $\sim$ 173 K, accompanied by spin-flip, T$_{SF}$ at $\sim$ 10 K. Ce$^{3+}$ incorporation drives a modification of the spin-flip transition from the $Γ{(G_x,A_y,F_z)}$ configuration to $Γ$ inducing a reorientation of the spin axis between the (001) and (001) crystallographic planes. This spin reorientation is governed by Zeeman energy and produces pronounced field-induced irreversibility between FCC and FCW magnetization processes. The substituted compound Gd$_{0.9}$Ce$_{0.1}$CrO$_3$ (GCCO) exhibits a remarkably large magnetic entropy change, $Δ$ S $\sim$ 45-40 J/kg-K for $Δ$ H = 90-70 kOe at 3 K among the highest reported for rare-earth orthochromites. The interplay of spin-only magnetocrystalline anisotropy from Cr$^{3+}$ and spin-orbit-driven magnetic moments of Gd$^{3+}$ and Ce$^{3+}$ results in pronounced spin-phonon coupling, manifested through the A$_{1g}$(6) vibrational mode. The observed temperature-dependent spectral evolution is consistent with behaviour reported in isostructural magnetic perovskites.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文实现了在室温下使用太赫兹电流脉冲对Mn₂Au反铁磁体进行非热、方向可控的奈尔矢量±90°旋转，切换时间小于15皮秒，比铁磁体快一个数量级。

Ultrafast electric manipulation of magnetic order in solids is critical for the development of future terahertz data processing. A fascinating concept for such high-speed operation is offered in metallic antiferromagnets by Néel spin-orbit torque. It should allow one to coherently rotate the ordered spins by simply applying an electric current of suitable amplitude and polarity. However, such switching has been severely hampered by competing heat-induced effects, and it has not yet been achieved on the intrinsically ultrafast time scales of antiferromagnets. Here, we report robust, direction-controlled and non-thermal rotation of the Néel vector $\mathbf{L}$ by $\pm$90° at room temperature in the antiferromagnet Mn$_2$Au driven by phase-locked terahertz current pulses. All observed features are consistent with ultrafast Néel spin-orbit torque: First, nonlinear optical imaging reveals that the terahertz current direction sets the final orientation of $\mathbf{L}$ in the absence of any bias field for at least two months. Second, transient optical birefringence shows that the switching proceeds ultrafast in less than 15 picoseconds. Finally, atomistic spin-dynamics simulations reproduce the observed dynamics and confirm the minor role of thermal effects. While the switching is already one order of magnitude faster than in ferromagnets at comparable dissipated energy, our simulations predict routes toward switching times and energies which are another order of magnitude lower. Our approach can be transferred to electric-field-driven switching in many more antiferromagnets, including magnetoelectric insulators. The engineering of spin torques, resonance frequencies and read-out mechanisms provides an exciting pathway toward on-chip applications of terahertz antiferromagnetic spin-orbitronics.

We report the influence of Ce$^{3+}$ substitution on the magnetic structures and phonon dynamics in SmCrO$_3$ perovskites. Magnetic landscapes are spanned by long-range canted anti-ferromagnetism, AFM with Neel temperatures $\sim$196 K accompanied by spin-reorientation transitions, T$_{SRPT}$ at 42 K. In Sm$_{0.9}$Ce$_{0.1}$CrO$_3$ (SCCO), Ce$^{3+}$ substitution at Sm$^{3+}$ sites transform the weak ferromagnetic (FM) $Γ_4$ state into robust AFM $Γ_1$ configuration through a gradual crossover. Such coexistence of magnetic spin configurations $Γ_1$(AFM) to $Γ_4$ (WFM) results in the enhanced high coercive field and a pronounced exchange bias-field, $H_{\mathrm{EB}}$ $\sim$ 2 kOe. Spin-only driven magneto-crystalline anisotropy of Cr$^{3+}$ and spin-orbit driven magnetic moment in Sm$^{3+}$, and Ce$^{3+}$ exhibits spin-phonon coupling through $A_{1g}(6)$ mode in SCCO are consistent with the temperature dependent spectral features of the isostructural magnetic systems and quite significant in SCCO which is in accordance with the higher structural distortion in SCCO. These results demonstrate that site-specific R$^{3+}$ substitution modulates lattice distortions, spin-phonon coupling, and spin-orbit interactions, offering pathways to optimize perovskites for diverse spintronic applications.

Controllable quasiparticle radiation in two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors is essential for efficient carrier recombination, tunable emission, and modulation of valley polarization which are strongly determined by both the density and nature of underlying excitonic species. Conventional chemical doping techniques, however, often hinder the reversibility and density of excitonic charge states (exciton and trion) due to unfavorable interactions between dopant and 2D materials. In this work, efficient excitonic charge state conversion is achieved by doping monolayer WS$_2$ using water rinsed PVA and the quasiparticle densities are further enhanced by applying high periodic biaxial strain (up to 2.3%) through a 2D silica microsphere array. The method presented here enables nearly 100% reversible trion-to-exciton conversion without the need of electrostatic gating, while delivering thermally stable trions with a large binding energy of ~56 meV and a high free electron density of ~3$\times$10$^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$ at room temperature. Strain-induced funneling of the PVA-injected free electrons substantially increases the excitonic quasiparticle densities and boosts the trion emission by 41%. Overall, this approach establishes a versatile platform for excitonic charge state conversion and enhanced quasiparticle density in 2D materials, offering promising opportunities for future optical data storage, quantum-light and display technologies.

Understanding the mechanisms of hydrogen embrittlement (HE) is essential for advancing next-generation high-strength steels, thereby motivating the development of highly accurate machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) for the Fe-H binary system. However, the substantial computational expense associated with existing MLIPs has limited their applicability in practical, large-scale simulations. In this study, we construct a new MLIP within the Performant Implementation of the Atomic Cluster Expansion (PACE) framework, trained on a comprehensive HE-related dataset generated through a concurrent-learning strategy. The resulting potential achieves density functional theory-level accuracy in reproducing a wide range of lattice defects in alpha-Fe and their interactions with hydrogen, including both screw and edge dislocations. More importantly, it accurately captures the deformation and fracture behavior of nanopolycrystals containing hydrogen-segregated general grain boundaries-phenomena not explicitly represented in the training data. Despite its high fidelity, the developed potential requires computational resources only several tens of times greater than empirical potentials and is more than an order of magnitude faster than previously reported MLIPs. By delivering both a high-precision and computationally efficient potential, as well as a generalizable methodology for constructing such models, this study significantly advances the atomic-scale understanding of HE across a broad range of metallic materials.

Germanium hole spin qubits based on strained Ge/SiGe quantum well have attracted much research attention due to the strong spin-orbit coupling. In particular, the strain dependence of the heavy-hole--light-hole mixing and thus the $g$-tensor anisotropy offer unique opportunities for acoustic driving and spin-phonon coupling. In this work we numerically simulate the coherent control of a Ge hole spin using surface acoustic waves. The periodic strain dynamically modulates the $g$-tensor matrix and causes fast spin rotation under a small acoustic amplitude. Moreover, we show a strong anisotropy and confinement dependence of the Rabi frequency coming from the phase-shifted longitudinal and shear strain components. Our work lays the foundations for acoustic-driven spin control and spin-phonon coupling using Ge hole spin qubits.

Topological magnetic textures are particle-like spin configurations stabilized by competing interactions. Their formation is commonly attributed to fluctuation-driven, first-order nucleation processes requiring activation over a topological energy barrier. Here, we demonstrate an alternative barrier- and fluctuation-free pathway for nucleating topological magnetic textures, triggered in our experiments by an excitation-induced spin reorientation transition. By combining x-ray imaging, scattering and micromagnetic simulations, we show that the system follows a deterministic cascade of symmetry-breaking phase transitions after excitation. First, the system undergoes a second-order phase transition from a homogeneous state to weak stripe domains, then a first-order transition to topologically trivial bubbles, and finally a topological switching event into skyrmionic textures. Through simulations, we generalize our findings and demonstrate that this pathway is active in a vast range of low-anisotropy materials. This previously unrecognized, spontaneous transition pathway suggests strategies for rapid, low-energy generation of topological spin textures and points to a general role of intrinsic modulational instabilities in phase transitions beyond magnetism.

Ba$_2$IrO$_4$ has been refined in the tetragonal $I4/mmm$ phase without octahedral rotations, and its physical properties have been interpreted in this high-symmetry structure. However, the dynamical stability of this undistorted phase has not previously been questioned. It is important to establish whether other lower-symmetry structures are energetically more favorable because octahedral rotations control electronic bandwidths and constrain which magnetic interactions are allowed by symmetry. Here I compute first-principles phonon dispersions of $I4/mmm$ Ba$_2$IrO$_4$ including spin-orbit interaction. I find a nearly-flat nondegenerate unstable branch along the Brillouin-zone boundary segment $XP$ associated with inplane rotations of the IrO$_6$ octahedra. Using group-theoretical analysis, I enumerate the symmetry-allowed distortions associated with the $X_2^+$ and $P_4$ instabilities and fully relax the resulting structures. Only five of the twelve possible distortions can be stabilized, and the energy gain scales with the number of layers that exhibit octahedral rotations: phases with rotations in every IrO$_6$ layer are lower by $-5.8$ meV/atom and are nearly degenerate with respect to the stacking phase. Electronic structure calculations show that these rotated phases host a narrow and well-separated half-filled $J_{\textrm{eff}} = 1/2$ manifold, whereas structures with rotations only in alternate layers have broader and more entangled bands. This motivates a reinvestigation of the crystal structure of Ba$_2$IrO$_4$ and indicates that octahedral rotations should be considered in modeling its correlated electronic and magnetic properties.

We report an emergent ac Josephson-like effect arising without external bias, driven by the interplay between nonreciprocity and nonlinearity in coupled condensates. Using a minimal model of three mutually nonreciprocally coupled condensates, we uncover a rich landscape of dynamical phases governed by generalized Josephson equations. This goes beyond the Kuramoto framework owing to inherent nonreciprocity and dynamically evolving effective couplings, leading to static and dynamical ferromagnetic and (anti)vortex states with nontrivial phase winding. Most strikingly, we identify an ac phase characterized by the emergence of two distinct frequencies, which spontaneously break the time-translation symmetry: one associated with the precession of the global U(1) Goldstone mode and the other with a stabilized limit cycle in a five-dimensional phase space. This phase features bias-free autonomous oscillatory currents beyond conventional Josephson dynamics. We further examine how instabilities develop in the ferromagnetic and vortex states, and how they drive transitions into the ac regime. Interestingly, the transition is hysteretic: phases with different winding numbers destabilize under distinct conditions, reflecting their inherently different nonlinear structures. Our work lays the foundation for exploring nonreciprocity-driven novel dynamical phases in a broad class of condensate platforms.

Titanium MXenes are two-dimensional inorganic structures composed of titanium and carbon or nitrogen elements, with distinctive electronic, thermal and mechanical properties. Despite the extensive experimental investigation, there is a paucity of computational studies at the level of classical molecular dynamics (MD). As demonstrated in a preceding study, known MD potentials are not capable of fully reproducing the structure and elastic properties of every titanium MXene. In this study, we present a simply trained, but yet efficient, non-density functional theory-based machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) capable of simulating the structure and elastic properties of titanium MXenes and bulk titanium carbide and nitride with precision comparable to DFT calculations. The training process for the MLIP is delineated herein, in conjunction with a series of dynamical tests. Limitations of the MLIP and steps towards improving its efficacy to simulate titanium MXenes are discussed.

Two-band Hamiltonians provide a typical description of topological band structures, in which the eigenfunctions can be characterized by a %Bloch vector field whose winding number that defines an integer topological invariant. This winding number is quantized and protected against continuous deformations of the Hamiltonian. Here we show that the Bloch vector and its winding number can be directly related to the gradient of the energy dispersion. Since the energy gradient is proportional to the group velocity, our result establishes an experimentally accessible correspondence between the Bloch vector field and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements. We discuss a mapping between the gradient of the energy dispersion and the Bloch vector. This implies a direct and measurable relation between two-band Hamiltonians and their underlying topological structures.

Cerium-based lanthanide high-entropy oxides (LN-HEOs) are promising candidates for solid-state electrolyte (mass transport) applications due to their ability to accommodate high concentrations of oxygen vacancies while retaining a fluorite-derived structure. However, synthesis often yields undesired ordered oxygen-deficient phases, such as bixbyite, depending on composition and processing conditions. We utilize first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations to systematically investigate phase stability in the model system Ce$_x$(YLaPrSm)$_{1-x}$O$_{2-δ}$, with the aim of elucidating the thermodynamic factors governing fluorite-bixbyite competition and identifying structure-property relationships to oxygen transport. By independently varying cerium concentration and oxygen vacancy content, we predict that the transition from disordered fluorite to ordered bixbyite is driven primarily by compositional and vacancy-ordering effects, rather than through changes in cation valence. Free-energy analysis reveals that at high vacancy concentrations, bixbyite is enthalpically favored due to ordered oxygen vacancies, while fluorite is stabilized at lower vacancy concentrations and higher cerium content through configurational entropy of the anion sublattice. These DFT results clarify the competing energetic contributions that control phase stability and structure-valence relationships in LN-HEOs and establishes a mechanistic framework for designing vacancy-tolerant oxide electrolytes with tunable phase behavior.

- **TL;DR**: 双层Cr₂SeO中实现了电场可调的spin-momentum locking，设计了双栅极反铁磁隧道结，无需翻转Néel矢量即可实现高低阻态切换，TMR比高达10⁷。

Altermagnets demonstrate significant potential in spintronics due to their unique non-relativistic spin-splitting properties, yet altermagnetic devices still face challenges in efficiently switching logic states. Here, we report electrostatically controllable spin-momentum locking in bilayer Cr$_{2}$SeO and design a dual-gate altermagnetic tunnel junction (AMTJ), which can switch between high and low resistance states without switching the Néel vector. First-principles calculations demonstrate that vertical electric field can induce significant spin splitting in bilayer Cr$_{2}$SeO. Reversing the electric field direction can alter the spin-momentum locking in bilayer Cr$_{2}$SeO. Leveraging this electric-field-tunable spin splitting, the dual-gate AMTJ exhibits an ultrahigh tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) ratio of $10^{7}$. This work provides theoretical support for the design of fully electrically controlled AMTJs and demonstrates their great potential for applications in spintronic devices.

The interplay between laser parameters and liquid environments dictates the outcome of femtosecond laser-induced nanoparticle modification. We present a study of gold and iron oxide nanoparticles in water and a water-acetone mixture, irradiated with femtosecond lasers at 808 nm and 404 nm. While aggregation was observed in pure water at both wavelengths, the results revealed a strong stability and a rather unexpected wavelength-dependency in the acetone-water mixture. In this case, 808 nm irradiation produced some decrease in nanoparticle sizes, while 404 nm led to some nanoparticle growth. As a result, the acetone effect is found to be twofold: (i) on one hand, it helps to prevent aggregation; (ii) on the other hand, it acts as a reactive medium allowing to tune the nanoparticle size and composition simply by changing laser wavelength. So, this work emphasizes that solvent physical properties as well as laser-induced chemical processes in the solvent are not merely secondary effects but can dominate the final morphological outcome, providing a predictive framework for nanoparticle synthesis.

Graphene, a two-dimensional monolayer of sp2-bonded carbon atoms in a honeycomb lattice, possesses exceptional electronic, mechanical, and quantum properties, making it highly attractive for energy storage, spintronics, and microelectronics. Functionalizing graphene with platinum (Pt) adatoms can further enhance its properties, particularly for hydrogen storage applications. In this study, we experimentally investigate hydrogen adsorption on Pt-decorated graphene using Elastic Recoil Detection Analysis (ERDA). By irradiating the Pt/graphene film with a 4.1 MeV C2+ ion beam and detecting recoiled hydrogen atoms at a 30 degree scattering angle, we obtain the hydrogen depth profile, providing critical insights into its storage behavior.

Two-dimensional (2D) materials provide unique opportunities to realize emergent phenomena by reducing dimensionality. Using scanning tunneling microscopy combined with first-principles calculations, we determine an intriguing case of a metal-insulator transition (MIT) in a bulk compound, (TBA)$_{0.3}$VSe$_2$. Atomic-scale imaging reveals that the initial $4a_0 \times 4a_0$ charge density wave (CDW) order in 1T-VSe$_2$ transforms to $\sqrt{7}a_0 \times \sqrt{3}a_0$ ordering upon intercalation, which is associated with an insulating gap with a magnitude of up to approximately 115 meV. Our calculations reveal that this energy gap is highly tunable through electron doping introduced by the intercalant. Moreover, the robustness of the $\sqrt{7}a_0 \times \sqrt{3}a_0$ CDW order against the Lifshitz transition points to the key role of electron-phonon interactions in stabilizing the CDW state. Our work clarifies a rare example of a CDW-driven MIT in quasi-2D materials and establishes cation intercalation as an effective pathway for tuning both the dimensionality and the carrier concentration without inducing strain or disorder.

The recent synthesis of Goldene, a 2D sheet of gold exfoliated from $Ti_3AuC_2$, offers high specific surface area (~260 $m^2g^{-1}$), roughly twice that of fine nanodots (~100 $m^2g^{-1}$), and unique electronic properties due to its dense d-orbital. In this work, we investigate the adsorption of single atom catalyst (SAC) of hydrogen atom on pristine goldene (pG), monovacant goldene (vG), and sulfur-functionalized variants (thiol-pG and thiol-vG) using ab initio calculations. The adsorption energy of a single H atom and $ΔG_H$, determines the efficiency of the Volmer step of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and is a key descriptor for HER activity. We explore various potential sites for H adsorption and its impact on descriptors such as Bader charges, d-band shift and the exchange current density.

Order versus disorder in the structure of materials plays a key role in the theoretical prediction of their properties. However, this structural description appears to be ineffective for new families of materials such as high entropy alloys (HEAs), which combine crystallographic order with chemical disorder. Here, we demonstrate for five-element HEAs as pure solid solutions that the chemical disorder of the elements decorating their cubic structure underlies the generation of second optical harmonics, overcoming the theoretical limit imposed on centrosymmetric crystals. Moreover, we discover that this disorder, inherent to HEAs, sets a threshold for non-linear light emission from the 4th to the 26th order. As a consequence of the 0.5 eV broadening of the energy levels of the five elements of the HEA, the emission spectrum covers broad visible (400-650 nm) and infrared (800-1600 nm) ranges. In addition to the challenge of theoretically predicting non-linear effects in unconventional materials, the duality of structural order and chemical disorder in HEAs offers the opportunity to design sustainable alternatives to urgently needed optical materials.

Theoretical simulation is helpful for accurate interpretation of experimental X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra that contain rich atomic and electronic structure information of materials. However, current simulation methods are usually too complex to give the needed accuracy and timeliness when a large amount of data need to be analyzed, such as for in-situ characterization of battery materials. To address these problems, artificial intelligence (AI) models have been developed for XANES prediction. However, instead of using experimental XANES data, the existing models are trained using simulated data, resulting in significant discrepancies between the predicted and experimental spectra. Also, the universality across different elements has not been well studied for such models. In this work, we firstly establish a crystal graph neural network, pre-trained on simulated XANES data covering 48 elements, to achieve universal XANES prediction with a low average relative square error of 0.020223; and then utilize transfer learning to calibrate the model using a small experimental XANES dataset. After calibration, the edge energy misalignment error of the predicted S, Ti and Fe K edge XANES is significantly reduced by about 55%. The method demonstrated in this work opens up a new way to achieve fast, universal, and experiment-calibrated XANES prediction.

Using quasi-simultaneous synchrotron X-ray diffraction and tomography techniques, we have studied in-situ and in real-time the nucleation and co-growth dynamics of the peritectic structures in an Al-Mn alloy during solidification. We collected ~30 TB 4D datasets which allow us to elucidate the phases' co-growth dynamics and their spatial, crystallographic and compositional relationship. The primary Al4Mn hexagonal prisms nucleate and grow with high kinetic anisotropy -70 times faster in the axial direction than the radial direction. In all cases, a ~5 um Mn-rich diffusion layer forms at the liquid-solid interface, creating a sharp local solute gradient that governs subsequent phase transformation. The peritectic Al6Mn phases nucleate epitaxially within this diffusion zone, initially forming a thin shell surrounding the Al4Mn with an orientation relationship of {10-10}HCP // {110}O, [0001]HCP // [001]O. Such ~5 um Mn-rich diffusion layers also cause solute depletion at the liquid side of the liquid-solid interface, limiting further epitaxial phase growth, but prompting phase re-nucleation and branching at crystal edges, resulting tetragonal prism structures that no longer follow the initial orientation relationship. The anisotropic diffusion also led to the formation of core defects at the centre of both phases. Furthermore, increasing cooling rate from 0.17 to 20 °C/s can disrupt the stability of the solute diffusion zone, effectively suppressing the formation of the core defects and forcing a transition from faceted to non-faceted morphologies. Our work establishes a new theoretical framework for how to tailor and control the peritectic structures in metallic alloys through solidification processes.

Phosphorus-based lubricant additives are used for protecting metallic contacts under boundary lubrication by forming surface films that reduce wear and friction. Despite their importance, the molecular mechanisms driving their friction-reducing effects remain unclear, especially for phosphate esters, whose molecular structure critically impact tribological behavior. In this study, we use machine learning-based molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the tribological performance of three representative phosphorus-based additives, Dibutyl Hydrogen Phosphite (DBHP), Octyl Acid Phosphate (OAP), and Methyl Polyethylene Glycol Phosphate (mPEG-P), on iron surfaces. The mPEG-P family is further analyzed by varying esterification degree and chain length. DBHP exhibits the lowest friction and largest interfacial separation, resulting from steric hindrance and tribochemical reactivity, as indicated by P-O bond cleavage and enhanced O-Fe interactions. In contrast, OAP and mPEG-P monoesters produce higher friction due to limited steric protection and reduced resistance to shear, leading to partial loss of surface coverage under extreme conditions. Within the mPEG-P family, multi-ester and longer-chain molecules significantly lower friction by maintaining larger separations, demonstrating that steric effects can outweigh surface reactivity under severe confinement. Overall, these results provide atomistic insights into how molecular architecture controls additive performance and support the design of phosphorus-based lubricants combining reactive anchoring with optimized steric structures for durable, low-friction interfaces.
