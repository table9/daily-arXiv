- **TL;DR**: 通过结合分子动力学模拟、实验测量和密度泛函理论计算，揭示了LGPS纳米颗粒在PEO聚合物电解质中的负载量对锂离子传输的影响机制，发现10%以下由聚合物链段动力学和界面效应主导，10%以上存在新的传输机制。

Polymer electrolytes incorporating Li$_{10}$GeP$_{2}$S$_{12}$ (LGPS) nanoparticles show promise for solid-state lithium batteries owing to their enhanced ionic conductivity, though the governing mechanisms remain unclear. We combine molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, experimental ionic conductivity measurements, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to elucidate the effect of LGPS loading on polyethylene oxide (PEO) structure and Li-ion transport. MD and experimental results agree up to 10\% LGPS, showing a volcano-shaped conductivity trend driven by polymer segmental dynamics and interfacial effects. Beyond 10\%, experiments reveal additional conductivity enhancement unexplained by MD, suggesting a distinct transport regime. DFT calculations indicate that Li-ion migration at the PEO|LGPS interface proceeds via vacancy-mediated hopping, with low barriers favored by S-rich interfacial sites and hindered by Ge. These findings link interfacial chemistry and microstructure to Li-ion dynamics, offering guidelines for designing high-performance composite polymer electrolytes.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究提出光谱采样框架，量化镍中硼扩散活化能，揭示Cr和Mo溶质在体相和晶界中如何重塑间隙点缺陷传输机制。

Understanding how light interstitials migrate in chemically complex alloys is essential for predicting defect dynamics and long-term stability. Here, we introduce a spectral sampling framework to quantify boron diffusion activation energies in Ni and demonstrate how substitutional solutes (Cr, Mo) reshape interstitial point defect transport in both the bulk and along crystallographic defects. In the bulk, boron migration energy distributions exhibit distinct modality tied to solute identity and spatial arrangement: both Cr and Mo raise barriers in symmetric cages but induce directional asymmetry in partially decorated environments. Extending this framework to a $\Sigma5\langle100\rangle{210}$ symmetric tilt grain boundary reveals solute-specific confinement effects. Cr preserves low-barrier in-plane mobility while suppressing out-of-plane transport, guiding boron into favorable midplane voids. Mo, by contrast, imposes an across-the-board reduction in boron mobility, suppressing average diffusivity by two additional orders of magnitude at 800 $^\circ$C and reducing out-of-plane transport by five orders of magnitude relative to Cr. Both elements promote segregation by producing negative segregation energies, but their roles diverge: Cr facilitates rapid redistribution and stabilization at interfacial sites, consistent with Cr-rich boride formation, while Mo creates deeper and more uniform segregation wells that strongly anchor boron. Together, these complementary behaviors explain the experimental prevalence of Cr- and Mo-rich borides at grain boundaries and carbide interfaces in Ni-based superalloys. More broadly, we establish spectral sampling as a transferable framework for interpreting diffusion in disordered alloys and for designing dopant strategies that control transport across complex interfaces.

- **TL;DR**: 提出ICL-FM框架，结合组成和结构表征，用于材料性能预测，在MatBench基准测试中达到或超越SOTA模型，且训练成本显著降低。

Foundation models (FMs) have recently shown remarkable in-context learning (ICL) capabilities across diverse scientific domains. In this work, we introduce a unified in-context learning foundation model (ICL-FM) framework for materials property prediction that integrates both composition-based and structure-aware representations. The proposed approach couples the pretrained TabPFN transformer with graph neural network (GNN)-derived embeddings and our novel MagpieEX descriptors. MagpieEX augments traditional features with cation-anion interaction data to explicitly measure bond ionicity and charge-transfer asymmetry, capturing interatomic bonding characteristics that influence vibrational and thermal transport properties. Comprehensive experiments on the MatBench benchmark suite and a standalone lattice thermal conductivity (LTC) dataset demonstrate that ICL-FM achieves competitive or superior performance to state-of-the-art (SOTA) models with significantly reduced training costs. Remarkably, the training-free ICL-FM outperformed sophisticated SOTA GNN models in five out of six representative composition-based tasks, including a significant 9.93\% improvement in phonon frequency prediction. On the LTC dataset, the FM effectively models complex phenomena such as phonon-phonon scattering and atomic mass contrast. t-SNE analysis reveals that the FM acts as a physics-aware feature refiner, transforming raw, disjoint feature clusters into continuous manifolds with gradual property transitions. This restructured latent space enhances interpolative prediction accuracy while aligning learned representations with underlying physical laws. This study establishes ICL-FM as a generalizable, data-efficient paradigm for materials informatics.

- **TL;DR**: 开发了ITO和In2O3的机器学习势函数，使分子动力学模拟速度比从头算方法快3-4个数量级，解决了设备尺度建模的瓶颈。

Machine-learned potential-driven molecular dynamics (MLMD) simulations are of great value in guiding the design and optimization of memory devices. Amorphous indium-tin-oxide (ITO) is widely used as transparent conducting oxide for flat-panel display and solar cell applications, and also as a capping layer in phase-change-materials-based reconfigurable color display devices. However, atomistic simulations of ITO using ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) are limited to systems of a few hundred atoms due to expensive computational costs, which prevents the device-scale modelling of real-world applications. In this work, we develop a machine-learned potential for ITO and its parent phase In2O3 based on the Gaussian approximation potential (GAP) framework. We generate a comprehensive training dataset using an iterative training protocol. Our MLMD simulations of crystalline, liquid and melt-quenched amorphous ITO models are in great agreement with the AIMD reference. In particular, the ML potential well captures the minority atomic interaction, such as Sn-Sn bonds, which have poor statistics in small-scale AIMD simulations. We demonstrate that the MLMD simulations are 3-4 orders of magnitude faster than AIMD. The training dataset and the fitted GAP potentials for ITO and In2O3 are openly accessible.

### New RVE concept in thermoelasticity of periodic composites subjected to compact support loading

- **TL;DR**: 本文提出了一个基于精确新加性广义积分方程(AGIE)的计算分析微力学(CAM)框架，用于分析具有周期性微结构的线性热弹性复合材料，该框架通过广义代表性体积元(RVE)概念将无限周期介质分析简化为有限数据驱动域。

This paper introduces an advanced Computational Analytical Micromechanics (CAM) framework for linear thermoelastic composites (CMs) with periodic microstructures. The approach is based on an exact new Additive General Integral Equation (AGIE), formulated for compactly supported loading conditions, such as body forces and localized thermal effects (for example laser heating). In addition, new general integral equations (GIEs) are established for arbitrary mechanical and thermal loading. A unified iterative scheme is developed for solving the static AGIEs, where the compact support of loading serves as a new fundamental training parameter. At the core of the methodology lies a generalized Representative Volume Element (RVE) concept that extends Hill classical definition of the RVE. Unlike conventional RVEs, this generalized RVE is not fixed geometrically but emerges naturally from the characteristic scale of localized loading, thereby reducing the analysis of an infinite periodic medium to a finite, data-driven domain. This formulation automatically filters out nonrepresentative subsets of effective parameters while eliminating boundary effects, edge artifacts, and finite-size sample dependencies. Furthermore, the AGIE-based CAM framework integrates seamlessly with machine learning (ML) and neural network (NN) architectures, supporting the development of accurate, physics-informed surrogate nonlocal operators.

- **TL;DR**: 开发自动化协议从电荷稳定性图中提取量子点器件的电容特性，结合机器学习、图像处理和对象检测技术，无需人工标注即可分析大规模数据集。

As quantum dot (QD)-based spin qubits advance toward larger, more complex device architectures, rapid, automated device characterization and data analysis tools become critical. The orientation and spacing of transition lines in a charge stability diagram (CSD) contain a fingerprint of a QD device's capacitive environment, making these measurements useful tools for device characterization. However, manually interpreting these features is time-consuming, error-prone, and impractical at scale. Here, we present an automated protocol for extracting underlying capacitive properties from CSDs. Our method integrates machine learning, image processing, and object detection to identify and track charge transitions across large datasets without manual labeling. We demonstrate this method using experimentally measured data from a strained-germanium single-quantum-well (planar) and a strained-germanium double-quantum-well (bilayer) QD device. Unlike for planar QD devices, CSDs in bilayer germanium heterostructure exhibit a larger set of transitions, including interlayer tunneling and distinct loading lines for the vertically stacked QDs, making them a powerful testbed for automation methods. By analyzing the properties of many CSDs, we can statistically estimate physically relevant quantities, like relative lever arms and capacitive couplings. Thus, our protocol enables rapid extraction of useful, nontrivial information about QD devices.

- **TL;DR**: 研究kagome晶格上吸引Hubbard模型中的无序平带超导性，对比保持平带的无序和破坏平带简并的随机跳跃无序对超导性的影响。

We investigate the disordered flat-band superconductivity within the attractive Hubbard model on the kagome lattice by contrasting the flat-band-preserving disorder [Phys. Rev. B 98, 235109 (2018)] with the random hopping disorder that breaks the flat-band degeneracy. Through Bogoliubov-de Gennes mean-field calculations, we find that the superfluid weight is much more robust under the flat-band-preserving disorder, while the system eventually undergoes a transition to an insulator as disorder becomes strong enough. The almost linear interaction-dependence of the superfluid weight in the weak coupling limit found with the flat-band-preserving disorder confirms the persistent flat-band signature, whereas the exponential behavior of a dispersive-band character arises with the random hopping counterpart. In addition, in the exact diagonalization of the one-particle density matrix, we identify an occupation spectrum structure attributed to the flat-band states, demonstrating the connection between the resilient flat band and the enhanced robustness of superconductivity.

- **TL;DR**: Ca2ScRuO6双钙钛矿钌酸盐表现出不寻常的磁性基态：低温下为弱I型反铁磁长程有序，同时存在小磁簇，高温表现出类亚铁磁行为。

Ruthenates, materials with a single magnetic Ruthenium (Ru) atom, often display an exotic array of ground states ranging from superconductivity to altermagnetism. In this work, we investigated the magnetic ground state of a least explored member of the 4d3 double perovskite ruthenate series A2ScRuO6 (A = Ca, Sr, Ba): Ca2ScRuO6. Interestingly, temperature-dependent bulk susceptibility curve shows ferrimagnetic-like behaviour above the magnetic ordering at around 40 K, which were corroborated by the identification of the mixed valence states, Ru5+ and Ru4+ via X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Structural analysis further revealed atomic-site exchange between the Ru and Sc sites, which results in the Ru mixed valence states. Neutron powder diffraction measurements detected the presence of magnetic Bragg peaks at a low temperature near 4 K and a moderate magnetoelastic coupling near the ordering temperature of 40 K. However, the corresponding symmetry analysis shows a weak Type I antiferromagnetic ground state with a reduced magnetic moment of 1.1μB/Ru atom. Our findings establish an unusual magnetic ground state in the Mott insulating Ca2ScRuO6, where a long range ordered antiferromagnet coexists with small magnetic clusters, which manifests a ferrimagnetic-like high temperature inverse magnetic susceptibility. This system presents a unique platform to study long-range magnetic order in the presence of antisite disorder.

- **TL;DR**: RPA作为MP2的替代低阶理论，在局部自然轨道耦合簇框架中表现出色，特别适用于金属体系

Practical applications of fragment embedding and closely related local correlation methods critically depend on a judicious choice of a low-level theory to define the local embedding subspace and to capture long-range electrostatic and correlation effects outside the embedding region. Second-order Møller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) is by far the most widely used correlated low-level theory; however, its applicability becomes questionable in systems where MP2 is known to fail either quantitatively or qualitatively. In this work, we present the random phase approximation (RPA) as a promising alternative low-level theory to MP2 within the local natural orbital-based coupled-cluster (LNO-CC) framework. We demonstrate that RPA-based LNO-CC closely matches the performance of its MP2-based counterpart for systems with sizable energy gaps, while delivering significantly faster convergence toward the canonical coupled-cluster limit for metallic systems, particularly as the thermodynamic limit is approached. These results highlight the critical role of the low-level theory in fragment embedding and local correlation methods and identify RPA as a compelling alternative to the commonly used MP2.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文提出了一种新方法，通过随机化幺正演化在封闭有限系统中计算热力学可观测量，无需外部浴环境，为量子计算机上的热态制备提供了新途径。

The emergence of statistical mechanics from quantum dynamics is a central problem in quantum many-body physics. Deriving observables aligned with the prediction of the canonical ensemble for a quantum system relies on the presence of a bath provided either as an external environment or as a larger part of a closed system. We demonstrate that thermal (canonical) observables for a whole closed quantum system of finite size can arise in the absence of a bath. These thermal observables stem from classical averaging over randomized unitary evolutions for a few-body system. The temperature in the canonical ensemble appears as a global constraint on the total energy of the system, determined by the choice of the initial state. From averaging randomized evolutions, we derive spin-spin correlation functions for a finite spin chain and show that they exhibit a temperature-dependent finite correlation length, in agreement with the prediction of the canonical ensemble. This establishes a method for computing thermal observables in a closed, finite-size system from real-time propagation without a bath. An implementation of this thermalization approach on a quantum computer can be utilized for thermal state preparation.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文首次在毫米级石墨接触中实现了宏观结构超润滑，将这一现象从微纳尺度扩展到宏观尺度，摩擦系数低至10^-6，甚至出现负摩擦系数。

Structural superlubricity (SSL) promises nearly frictionless and wearless sliding, but has until now been considered a special and extreme interfacial phenomenon limited to micro- and nanoscale contacts. Here, we demonstrate robust macroscale SSL within a single sub-millimeter graphite contact. Previously reported near-zero friction coefficients, where friction is nearly independent of normal load, have only been observed at microscale contacts under low loads. Our system expands both contact size and load into the macroscopic regime, exhibiting friction coefficients that fluctuate around zero and reach values as low as $10^{-6}$ across a broad load range from 1 mN to 0.5 N. Negative friction coefficients are also observed. Similar behavior is observed at graphite/MoS$_2$ interfaces, indicating that macroscale SSL is a generalizable phenomenon across flat layered materials. These findings overturn long-standing scaling limitations and establish macroscale SSL as a paradigm-shifting platform for next-generation mechanical and electromechanical systems.

### Additive general integral equations in thermoelastic micromechanics of composites

This work presents an enhanced Computational Analytical Micromechanics (CAM) framework for the analysis of linear thermoelastic composite materials (CMs) with random microstructure. The proposed approach is grounded in an exact Additive General Integral Equation (AGIE), specifically formulated for compactly supported loading, including both body forces and localized thermal changes (such as those from laser heating). New general integral equations (GIEs) for arbitrary mechanical and thermal loading are proposed. A unified iterative solution strategy is developed for the static AGIE, applicable to CMs with both perfectly and imperfectly bonded interfaces, where the compact support of loading is introduced as a new fundamental training parameter. Central to this methodology is a generalized Representative Volume Element (RVE) concept, which extends Hill classical definition. The resulting RVE is not predefined geometrically, but rather emerges from the characteristic scale of the localized loading, effectively reducing the analysis of an infinite, randomly heterogeneous medium to a finite, data-driven domain. This generalized RVE approach enables automatic exclusion of unrepresentative subsets of effective parameters, while inherently eliminating boundary effects, edge artifacts, and finite size limitations. Moreover, the AGIE-based CAM framework is naturally compatible with machine learning (ML) and neural network (NN) architectures, facilitating the construction of accurate and physically informed surrogate nonlocal operators.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究通过经典成核理论结合球体堆积模型，建立了外磁场下银纳米颗粒尺寸减小的理论框架，预测并验证了磁场强度与纳米颗粒半径的关系。

We examine the reduction of silver nanoparticle (AgNP) size under an external magnetic field within a classical nucleation theory framework combined with a sphere-packing description of atomic assembly. The model incorporates magnetic free-energy contributions arising from the coupling between the applied field and the magnetic susceptibility of the nucleating material, yielding a closed-form relation between nanoparticle radius and field strength. Our approach reproduces the experimentally observed decrease in the most-probable particle radius from approximately 170 nm at 49.27 mT when the magnetic field is oriented parallel to the stirring plane, and to 155 nm at 180.78 mT in the perpendicular configuration. Across the investigated field range, the theoretical predictions remain consistent with experimental measurements obtained under continuous mechanical stirring, supporting the interpretation that the observed size reduction originates from a magnetic-field-induced modification of the nucleation free-energy landscape. Within the limits of classical capillarity and spherical demagnetization, the results provide a physically transparent and computationally efficient framework for understanding magnetic-field-controlled nanoparticle size selection.

- **TL;DR**: 在TiSe2单晶中发现向列涨落，通过Cu插层调控向列涨落温度T*，当T*趋近零时超导性最优，表明向列涨落可能增强CuxTiSe2中的超导性

The interplay among electronic nematicity, charge density wave, and superconductivity in correlated electronic systems has induced extensive research interest. Here, we discover the existence of nematic fluctuations in TiSe2 single crystal and investigate its evolution with Cu intercalation. It is observed that the elastoresistivity coefficient mEg exhibits a divergent temperature dependence following a Curie-Weiss law at high temperature. Upon Cu intercalation, the characteristic temperature T* of nematic fluctuation is progressively suppressed and becomes near zero when the superconductivity is optimized. Further intercalation of Cu leads to the sign change of T* and the suppression of superconductivity. These results strongly indicate that nematic phase transition may play a vital role in enhancing superconductivity in CuxTiSe2. Therefore, CuxTiSe2 provides a unique material platform to explore the nematic-fluctuation-mediated superconductivity.

- **TL;DR**: NbFe2中通过调节Fe浓度研究铁磁量子临界点，发现纵向自旋密度波掩盖了铁磁量子临界点，这是首次完全解析的此类调制磁序案例。

In the metallic magnet NbFe2, the low temperature threshold of ferromagnetism can be investigated by varying the Fe concentration within a narrow homogeneity range. NbFe2 is one of a number of compounds where modulated order is found to mask the ferromagnetic quantum critical point. However, here we report the rare case where the masking modulated magnetic order has been fully refined. Spherical neutron polarimetry and high-intensity single-crystal neutron diffraction reveal the first case of a longitudinal spin-density wave masking the ferromagnetic quantum critical point. The spin-density wave is characterised by a large-wavelength incommensurate modulation of its low average moment. It is formed from ferrimagnetic building blocks with antiparallel ferromagnetic sheets. The existence of ferromagnetic sheets and cancellation of the magnetisation only over mesoscopic length scales show local similarity between the spin-density wave and the ferromagnetic parent phase and indicate the spin-density wave's unconventional nature as emerging from underlying ferromagnetic quantum criticality.

Carotenoid molecules are critical in photosynthesis, performing functions at the heart of both light-harvesting and photoprotection. As both these processes involve excitation energy transfer, fully understanding them requires a precise description of the electronic states involved. The excited state manifold of carotenoids is not yet fully characterised, however, and includes several dark electronic states that remain elusive. Using femtosecond stimulated resonance Raman spectroscopy, where the vibrational contributions of each excited state can be observed selectively as a function of the Raman excitation, we reveal the nature and symmetry of no less than four different dark states. These results end long-standing controversies in carotenoid research, shining new light on the photophysics of these essential molecules and establishing a spectroscopic framework for characterising their multiple roles.

A quantum model exhibits Hilbert space fragmentation (HSF) if its Hilbert space decomposes into exponentially many dynamically disconnected subspaces, known as Krylov subspaces. A model may however have different HSFs depending on the method for identifying them. Here we establish a connection between two vastly distinct methods recently proposed for identifying HSF: the commutant algebra (CA) method and integer characteristic polynomial factorization (ICPF) method. For a Hamiltonian consisting of operators admitting rational number matrix representations, we prove a theorem that, if its center of commutant algebra have all eigenvalues being rational, the HSF from the ICPF method must be equal to or finer than that from the CA method. We show that this condition is satisfied by most known models exhibiting HSF, for which we demonstrate the validity of our theorem. We further discuss representative models for which ICPF and CA methods yield different HSFs. Our results may facilitate the exploration of a unified definition of HSF.

In high quality samples, a complete structural transition from room-temperature C2/m to low-temperature R$\bar{3}$ is consistently observed, with a single magnetic transition to antiferromagnetic ordering at $\sim$7K. However, magnetic and physical properties have been shown to depend heavily on both sample size and sample quality, with small and damaged samples exhibiting incomplete structural transitions and multiple magnetic anomalies. Although large high quality samples have been well studied, an understanding of the features attributed to low quality or small sample size is limited. Here, we probe the structural and magnetic transitions of $α$-RuCl$_3$ single crystal samples via magnetic susceptibility through a range of thickness, manipulated through careful mechanical exfoliation. We present a non-destructive protocol for exfoliating crystals and show success to 30 $μ$m, where sample quality is observed to improve with successive cleaving. Higher temperature magnetic features at 10 K/12 K are found to emerge through cleaving, both with and without induced sample damage. In both cases, we link these additional magnetic features to a persistence of C2/m structure to the low-temperature regime.

This perspective explores the evolution of materials informatics, from its foundational roots in physics and information theory to its maturation through artificial intelligence (AI). We trace the field's trajectory from early milestones to the transformative impact of the Materials Genome Initiative and the recent advent of large language models (LLMs). Rather than a mere toolkit, we present materials informatics as an evolving ecosystem, reviewing key methodologies such as Bayesian Optimization, Reinforcement Learning, and Transformers that drive inverse design and autonomous self-driving laboratories. We specifically address the practical challenges of LLM integration, comparing specialist versus generalist models and discussing solutions for uncertainty quantification. Looking forward, we assess the transition of AI from a predictive tool to a collaborative research partner. By leveraging active learning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), the field is moving toward a new era of autonomous materials science, increasingly characterized by "human-out-of-the-loop" discovery processes.

Pathways and structural dynamics of phase transformations impact performance of materials in energy and information storage technologies. Palladium hydride ($\mathrm{PdH}_x$) nanocrystals are an ideal model system for studying solute-induced phase transformations, where elastic energy from lattice mismatch between $α$-$\mathrm{PdH}_x$ and $β$-$\mathrm{PdH}_x$ phases is often considered a key to determining the transformation pathways. $α/β$-$\mathrm{PdH}_x$ interfacial elastic energy is affected by the confined geometry of a nanocrystal. However, how nanocrystal geometry influences phase transformation pathways is largely unknown. Using in situ liquid phase transmission electron microscopy, we directly visualize hydrogenation in Pd nanocrystals with two geometries -- a nanocube and a hexagonal nanoplate. Both follow similar sequences of an initially curved nucleus, interface flattening, and reverse-stage nucleation; however, their evolving $α/β$-$\mathrm{PdH}_x$ interfaces exhibit geometry-dependent crystallographic alignments. In nanocubes, $\{100\}$-aligned configurations conform to static elastic energy ordering, representing a pathway that maintains a local mechanical equilibrium, whereas nanoplates display both $\{110\}$- and $\{211\}$-aligned interfaces. Theoretical simulations show that geometry determines the accessibility of alternative phase transformation pathways as the system is driven far from equilibrium during hydrogenation. These findings identify geometry as a fundamental parameter for directing phase transformation pathways, offering design principles for accessing atypical configurations and improving properties of intercalation-based devices.

We present the global topological phase diagram of a two-dimensional electron gas placed in a quantizing magnetic field and proximitized by a superconducting vortex lattice. Our theory allows for arbitrary ratios of the pairing amplitude, magnetic field, and chemical potential. By analyzing the Bogoliubov--de Gennes Hamiltonian, we show that the resulting phase diagram is highly nontrivial, featuring a plethora of topological superconducting phases with chiral edge modes of quasiparticles. Landau-level mixing plays an essential role in our theory: even in the weak-pairing limit, it generically splits the integer quantum Hall transition lines into a sequence of transitions with larger Chern number jumps of both signs protected by the symmetries of the superconducting vortex lattice. Interestingly, we find that weak pairing induces trivial or topological superconductivity when chemical potential is tuned to a Landau level energy, depending on the Landau level index.

Topology forms a cornerstone in modern condensed matter and statistical physics, offering a new framework to classify the phases and phase transitions beyond the traditional Landau paradigm. However, it is widely believed that topological properties are destroyed when the bulk energy gap closes, making it highly nontrivial to consider topology in gapless quantum critical systems. To address these challenges, recent advancements have sought to generalize the notion of topology to systems without a bulk energy gap, including quantum critical points and critical phases, collectively referred to as gapless symmetry-protected topological states. Extending topology to gapless quantum critical systems challenges the traditional belief in condensed matter physics that topological edge states are typically tied to the presence of a bulk energy gap. Furthermore, it suggests that topology plays a crucial role in classifying quantum phase transitions even if they belong to the same universality class, fundamentally enriching the textbook understanding of phase transitions. Given its importance, here we give a pedagogical review of the current progress of topological physics in quantum critical systems. We introduce the topological properties of quantum critical points and generalize them to stable critical phases, both for noninteracting and interacting systems. Additionally, we discuss further generalizations and future directions, including higher dimensions, nonequilibrium phase transitions, and realizations in modern experiments.

Digital sensing faces challenges in developing sustainable methods to extend the applicability of customized e-noses to complex body odor volatilome (BOV). To address this challenge, we developed MORE-ML, a computational framework that integrates quantum-mechanical (QM) property data of e-nose molecular building blocks with machine learning (ML) methods to predict sensing-relevant properties. Within this framework, we expanded our previous dataset, MORE-Q, to MORE-QX by sampling a larger conformational space of interactions between BOV molecules and mucin-derived receptors. This dataset provides extensive electronic binding features (BFs) computed upon BOV adsorption. Analysis of MORE-QX property space revealed weak correlations between QM properties of building blocks and resulting BFs. Leveraging this observation, we defined electronic descriptors of building blocks as inputs for tree-based ML models to predict BFs. Benchmarking showed CatBoost models outperform alternatives, especially in transferability to unseen compounds. Explainable AI methods further highlighted which QM properties most influence BF predictions. Collectively, MORE-ML combines QM insights with ML to provide mechanistic understanding and rational design principles for molecular receptors in BOV sensing. This approach establishes a foundation for advancing artificial sensing materials capable of analyzing complex odor mixtures, bridging the gap between molecular-level computations and practical e-nose applications.

Dense ultrafine-grained (UFG) refractory MoW, MoWNb, and MoWNbTa alloys were fabricated by combining high-energy ball milling (HEBM) and spark plasma sintering (SPS), achieving ~92-96% relative densities and ~70-180 nm grain sizes. The effects of 2 at.% cobalt (Co) addition on sintering behavior and high-temperature grain growth resistance were investigated as a function of compositional complexity. Activated sintering was observed, with 2 at.% Co addition increasing relative densities from ~92-96% to ~96-98%. Isothermal grain growth experiments at 1200 °C and 1300 °C showed that Co doping suppressed the relative grain growth rate, despite a modest initial grain size increase due to Co-activated sintering, with the effect becoming more pronounced in compositionally complex alloys. The observed trend is consistent with the recently proposed high-entropy grain boundary (HEGB) effect. Notably, Mo24.5W24.5Nb24.5Ta24.5Co2 achieved a 96.4% relative density and maintained an ultrafine grain size, increasing only slightly from ~122 nm to ~127 nm after 5 h annealing at 1200 °C. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) confirmed strong Co segregation at grain boundaries, accompanied by minor depletion of Ta and W, supporting a recently proposed grain boundary segregation model for high-entropy alloys and HEGBs.

The approach is based on the Multistate Bennett Acceptance Ratio (MBAR) methodology applied to entire trajectories. Illustrating the technique with simple 2D potential models and a more complex host-guest system, we show that the statistics can significantly improve compared to a straightforward combination.

Magnetic-rare-earth pyrochlore iridates exhibit a rich variety of unconventional phases, driven by the complex interactions within and between the rare-earth and the iridium sublattices. In this study, we investigate the peculiar magnetic state of Tb$_{2}$Ir$_{2}$O$_{7}$, where a component of the Tb$^{3+}$ moment orders perpendicular to its local Ising anisotropy axis. By means of neutron diffraction and inelastic neutron scattering down to dilution temperatures, complemented by specific heat measurements, we show that this intriguing magnetic state is fully established at 1.5 K and we characterize its excitation spectrum across a broad range of energies. Our calculations reveal that bilinear interactions between Tb$^{3+}$ ions subjected to the Ir molecular field capture several key features of the experiments, but need to be supplemented to fully reproduce the observed behavior.

We introduce AceFF, a pre-trained machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) optimized for small molecule drug discovery. While MLIPs have emerged as efficient alternatives to Density Functional Theory (DFT), generalizability across diverse chemical spaces remains difficult. AceFF addresses this via a refined TensorNet2 architecture trained on a comprehensive dataset of drug-like compounds. This approach yields a force field that balances high-throughput inference speed with DFT-level accuracy. AceFF fully supports the essential medicinal chemistry elements (H, B, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, I) and is explicitly trained to handle charged states. Validation against rigorous benchmarks, including complex torsional energy scans, molecular dynamics trajectories, batched minimizations, and forces and anergy accuracy demonstrates that AceFF establishes a new state-of-the-art for organic molecules.

Dislocations are fundamental crystal defects whose stress fields govern a wide range of material properties. The analytical form of the stress tensor around single dislocation was established by elasticity theory more than 80 years ago and has provided a theoretical basis for evaluating essential characteristics of dislocations. However, direct experimental verification has long remained out of reach because it has been difficult to measure the components of the stress tensor with conventional methods. Here, we present the experimental visualization of the stress tensor around single dislocation in diamond. Using quantum sensors based on nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers, we mapped the shear components ($σ_{xy}$, $σ_{yz}$, $σ_{zx}$) together with the trace of the stress tensor ($σ_{xx}+σ_{yy}+σ_{zz}$) around single 45° dislocation. The observed distributions exhibited good agreement with predictions from elasticity theory, thus providing experimental validation of this theoretical framework.

- **TL;DR**: 研究无钴高熵合金CrMnFeNi的塑性变形行为，通过实验和计算揭示其温度依赖的力学性能变化、位错活动、层错形成和孪晶机制。

Cobalt-free high-entropy alloys (HEAs) have garnered interest for nuclear structural applications due to their good mechanical performance, thermal stability, and resistance to radiation-induced degradation, while avoiding long-lived Co radioisotopes. This study presents an experimental and computational investigation of the plastic deformation behavior of a non-equatomic CrMnFeNi alloy, designed to maintain a stability of fcc phase in a large domain of temperatures and to balance stacking fault (SF) energies for enhanced strain hardening and ductility. Tensile tests reveal a temperature-dependent reduction in mechanical strength, attributed to thermally activated deformation mechanisms and microstructural evolution. Molecular dynamics simulations of single- and polycrystals capture dislocation activity, SF formation, and twin nucleation as a function of strain and temperature. Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) confirms twin formation and grain boundary activity. The Schmid factor mapping is drawn to interpret local slip activity and anisotropic deformation behavior. The absence of Co leads to enhanced high-temperature strength compared to the Cantor alloy.

### Evidence for the suppression of the hybrid skin-topological effect by fragile topology

Topological insulators are well-known for their topological edge states, which are protected by the non-trivial bulk topology and characterized by gapless Wannier bands, a phenomenon known as the bulk-boundary correspondence. However, fragile topology challenged this concept, the Wannier bands are gapped, but the edge states still exist with similar protection. Previous studies on fragile topology have primarily focused on the spectral flow under twisted boundary conditions, but the discussion on the physical interpretation of the Wannier gap is limited. In this study, we introduce a bilayer breathing honeycomb lattice with spiral interlayer couplings inside the unit cell. As we increase the interlayer coupling strength, the Wannier gap increases monotonically and the bandgap first increases then decreases. After introducing a gain-loss domain wall, the hybrid skin-topological effect (HSTE) emerges, and the topological edge states under the periodic boundary condition (PBC) change into corner states under the open boundary condition (OBC) associated with the significant spectral difference. HSTE is suppressed as the interlayer coupling strength increases, the spectral difference between the two boundary conditions has an overall decreasing trend, which more closely mirrors the evolution of the inverse of the Wannier gap. Moreover, some of the corner states transform into edge states. Our work first provides evidence for the relation between fragile topology and HSTE, shedding new insights into the underlying mechanism of Non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE).

The spontaneous emergence of coherent structures from chaotic backgrounds is a hallmark of active biological swarms. We investigate this self-organization by simulating an ensemble of polar chiral active agents that couple locally via a Kuramoto interaction. We demonstrate that the system's transition from chaos to active turbulence is characterized by quantized loop phase currents and coherent clustering, and that this transition is strictly governed by a kinetic Turing instability. By deriving the continuum kinetic theory for the model, we identify that the competition between local phase-locking and active agent motility selects a critical structural wavenumber. The instability then drives the system into a state of developed, active turbulence that exhibits stable, robust power-laws in spectral density, suggestive of universality and consistent with observations from a broad range of turbulent phenomena. Our results bridge the gap between discrete chimera states and continuous fluid turbulence, suggesting that the statistical scaling laws of active turbulence can arise from fundamental kinetic instability criteria.

- **TL;DR**: 通过高压XRD和拉曼光谱研究3YSZ和8YSZ的结构演化，发现压力促进高对称性结构转变，所有相变可逆，为消除单斜相实现"结构纯化"提供途径。

The structural evolution of two selected compositions of Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia (YSZ), with 3mol% (3YSZ) and 8mol% (8YSZ) of Y2O3, have been investigated under pressure using in-situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy in a diamond anvil cell up to 40 GPa (at room temperature).The close crystallographic relation between the observed structures and the relatively large difference in the atomic numbers of Y/Zr and O, imposes the simultaneous study using both techniques, aiming to fully elucidate the structural evolution under pressure. The results, by combining both techniques, reveal that for both 3YSZ and 8YSZ, pressure promotes higher-symmetry structures. Under initial compression, the minority at ambient conditions monoclinic phase (m-phase) gradually transforms towards t-phase, a transition that is concluded for both 3YSZ/8YSZ at ~10 GPa. At higher pressures, the solely remaining t-phase of 3YSZ transforms to the t'', that in turns transforms to the c-phase above 28 GPa. Likewise, for 8YSZ the coexistence of t- and t''-phases continue up to 31 GPa, where both transforms towards c-phase, that remains stable up to the highest pressure of this study. Upon pressure release, all observed transitions are fully reversible with negligible hysteresis, with the exception of the practical disappearance of the monoclinic phase at ambient conditions. Our study underscores the significance of simultaneously performing and analyzing the results of both XRD and Raman spectroscopy studies in relevant crystallographic systems. Moreover, it provides a route towards a ``structural purification'' of YSZ through the elimination of the m-phase aiming to improve material properties.

We compute the thermodynamic phase diagram of seventeen elemental metals with hexagonal close-packed (hcp), face-centered cubic (fcc), and body-centered cubic (bcc) crystal structures using finite-temperature density functional theory. Helmholtz free-energy differences between competing hcp, fcc, and bcc phases are evaluated as functions of electronic temperature up to 7 eV, allowing us to identify solid-solid phase transitions driven by electronic entropy. The systems studied include Zr, Ti, Cd, Zn, Co, and Mg (hcp), Ni, Cu, Ag, Al, Pt, and Pb (fcc), and Cr, W, V, Nb, and Mo (bcc) in their ground-state structures. From the free-energy crossings, we extract the transition electronic temperatures and analyze systematic trends across the metallic systems. We found that all the studied systems go through one or two solid-solid phase transition caused purely by electronic entropy except Mg and Pb. Our results establish electronic entropy as a key factor governing structural stability in metals under strong electronic excitation.

Dynamic and stable magnetic textures offer a powerful platform for controlling magnon states in the broader context of spin electronics. In this work, we uncover a novel class of dynamical, crystal-like localization patterns in real space, arising from the hybridization of magnons with topologically non-trivial spin textures that possess helicity as an internal degree of freedom. By tuning the magnon wavelength to match the size of these textures, specifically, atomic-scale skyrmions in centrosymmetric frustrated magnets, we achieve strong interference effects. This leads to the emergence of magnon superlattices, shaped by the internal skyrmion structure and the underlying Mexican-hat magnon dispersion. Furthermore, helicity-driven nonlinear dynamics give rise to dispersive magnon bands with nontrivial Chern numbers within the first magnon gap. These findings provide fundamental insights into magnon behavior in complex spin environments and establish frustrated magnets as a versatile platform for manipulating spin excitations at the atomic scale.

Moiré patterns of twisted and scaled bilayers have recently emerged as a fertile source of quasiperiodic order in two-dimensional materials. Inspired by these systems, we introduce the \emph{near-coincidence method} for generating quasiperiodic tilings of the plane. The method is intuitive -- admitting pairs of nearly coincident points from superimposed layers -- yet rigorous, as it maps naturally to the well-established cut-and-project formalism. It reproduces classical tilings, including the Ammann--Beenker, the Niizeki--Gähler, and the square and hexagonal Fibonacci tilings. It also uncovers new tilings not likely to arise in conventional constructions, with relative frequencies of local configurations that may take transcendental values. The near-coincidence method is algorithmically simple and already realized in an application that generates tilings from specified layer parameters and coincidence conditions. Future extensions include trilayer systems, where preliminary results yield dodecagonal order with square layers, and very small twist angles, where the method may capture the giant moiré patterns of bilayer and trilayer graphene.

This work examines $Δ_T$ noise in two-terminal hybrid nanostructures featuring a quantum point contact (QPC), realized either between two normal metals (NQN) or between a normal metal and a superconductor (NQS). The inclusion of a QPC breaks electron-hole (e-h) symmetry, leading to a finite thermovoltage. In contrast, earlier studies on hybrid junctions incorporating insulating barriers, as e-h symmetry is preserved, have vanishing thermovoltage, and consequently, $Δ_T$ noise is calculated at zero thermovoltage. In our setup, the broken e-h symmetry allows for a finite thermovoltage, at which we compute the corresponding $Δ_T$ noise. Unlike earlier studies restricted by e-h symmetry and vanishing thermovoltage, our work establishes a self-consistent framework in mesoscopic hybrid junctions, revealing how Andreev reflection fundamentally reshapes $Δ_T$ noise once e-h symmetry is broken. This broad access to charge fluctuation signatures provides a more comprehensive understanding of non-equilibrium transport in linear response. To our knowledge, this work provides the first self-consistent analysis of $Δ_T$ noise in superconducting hybrid junctions where e-h symmetry is broken, explicitly revealing how Andreev reflection modifies $Δ_T$ noise beyond the symmetry-protected zero-thermovoltage regime.

Two-dimensional type-II topological semimetals (TSMs), characterized by strongly tilted Dirac cones, have attracted intense interest for their unconventional electronic properties and exotic transport behaviors. However, rational design remains challenging due to the sensitivity of band tilting to lattice geometry, atomic coordination, and symmetry constraints. Here, we present a bottom-up approach to engineer ideal type-II nodal line semimetals (NLSMs) in van der Waals bilayers via atomic intercalation. Using monolayer $h$-AlN as a prototype, we show that fluorine-intercalated bilayer AlN (F@BL-AlN) hosts a symmetry-protected type-II nodal loop precisely at the Fermi level, enabled by preserved mirror symmetry ($\mathcal{M}_z$) and tailored interlayer hybridization. First-principles calculations reveal that fluorine not only tunes interlayer coupling but also aligns the Fermi energy with the nodal line, stabilizing the type-II NLSM phase. The system exhibits tunable electronic properties under external electric and strain fields and features a van Hove singularity that induces spontaneous ferromagnetism, realizing a ferromagnetic topological semimetal state. This work provides a versatile platform for designing type-II NLSMs and offers practical guidance for their experimental realization.

We investigate far-field radiation of energy, linear momentum, and angular momentum from two-dimensional electron systems, focusing on metallic thin films described by the Drude conductivity. Using the Keldysh formalism within the non-equilibrium Green's function framework, we derive analytical expressions for radiative power, force, and torque. To enable angular momentum radiation, an out-of-plane magnetic field is applied to break reciprocity, resulting in gyrotropic terms in the permittivity tensor. By approximating the emitter as a thin film, the photon Green's functions can be solved analytically. Expressions for the Poynting vector and Maxwell's stress tensor can subsequently be extracted from the lesser Green's function, which governs the field correlations. The final radiation formulas can be expressed in terms of Fresnel coefficients, revealing an insightful connection to energy conservation via Kirchhoff's law. Using the Wigner transform, the analytical expression for the radiative torque can also be related to the generalized Fresnel coefficients. Numerical calculations based on the optical conductivity of bismuth are presented to corroborate the analytical results. These results provide a unified framework for energy, momentum, and angular momentum radiation in gyrotropic thin films.

Aluminum-Copper (Al-Cu) alloys are essential materials for weight reduction critical structures in the aerospace and automotive industries, yet achieving their maximum ultrahigh-strength potential remains limited by nanoscale defect control during powder metallurgy processing. We employ large-scale molecular dynamics simulations on Al-6.8%Cu nanoparticles to explore atomic-scale mechanisms governing the full thermal sintering cycle. We demonstrate that while the sintering temperature primarily initiates neck formation, the subsequent cooling rate is the dominant kinetic parameter dictating the final microstructure. Fast cooling rates trap a significantly higher density of stacking faults and can unexpectedly lead to the formation of an amorphous phase at the interparticle interfaces, a feature critically dependent on the rate of thermal dissipation. We confirm a clear shift in the coalescence mechanism from plastic deformation (dislocation slip) at low temperatures (300 K and 450 K) to mass transport via atomic diffusion at high temperatures (600 K). These findings provide essential, atomic-scale guidelines for controlling thermal processing, particularly cooling rates, to design defect-stabilized, high-performance Al-Cu components.

A defining quantity of a physical system is its energy which is represented by the Hamiltonian. In closed quantum mechanical or/and coherent wave-based systems the Hamiltonian is introduced as a Hermitian operator which ensures real energy spectrum and secures the decomposition of any state over a complete basis set spanning the space where the states live. Pseudo-Hermitian, or PT symmetric, systems are a special class of non-Hermitian ones. They describe open systems but may still have real energy spectrum. The eigenmodes are however not orthogonal in general. This qualitative difference to Hermitian physics has a range of consequences for the physical behaviour of the system in the steady state or when it is subjected to external perturbations. This overview reviews the recent progress in the field of pseudo-Hermitian physics as it unfolds when applied to low-energy excitations of magnetically ordered materials. The focus is mainly on long wave length spin excitations (spin waves) with magnons being the energy quanta of these excitations. Various setups including ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, magnonic crystals, and hybride structures with different types of coupling to the environments as well as spatio-temporally engineered systems will be discussed with a focus on the particular aspects that are brought about by the pseudo-Hermiticity such as mode amplifications, non-reciprocal propagation, magnon cloaking, non-Hermitian skin effect, PT-symmetric assisted Floquet engineering, topological energy transfer, and field-induced enhanced sensitivity.

The microscopic coexistence of ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism in solids remains a fundamental challenge in condensed matter physics, with far-reaching implications for multifunctional materials and next-generation electronic devices. Using first-principles calculations, we predict emergent sliding ferroelectricity and doping-mediated ferromagnetism in bilayer (BL) InSe. The energetically favored AB stacked BL-InSe spontaneously breaks the out-of-plane mirror symmetry, resulting in a switchable polarization with a saturated component of 0.089 pC/m and a low transition barrier of 28.8 meV per unit cell. Strikingly, low-concentration electrostatic doping enhances rather than suppresses the ferroelectric polarization due to the abnormal layer-dependent electronic occupation in BL-InSe, in contrast to the conventional screening paradigm. In addition, the characteristic Mexican-hat-shaped valence band enables doping-induced itinerant half-metallic ferromagnetism, where the interlayer spin density difference scales linearly with doping concentration and can be reversed by switching the polarization direction. These results demonstrate the coexistence of ferroelectric and ferromagnetic orders in BL-InSe and establish a viable platform for realizing voltage-tunable multiferroicity through stacking and carrier doping in otherwise nonpolar and nonmagnetic semiconductors.

The standard approach to characterizing topological matter, computing topological invariants, fails when the symmetry protecting the topological phase is preserved only on average in a disordered system. Because topological invariants rely on enforcing the symmetry exactly, they can overcount phases by incorrectly identifying certain non-robust features as robust. Moreover, in intrinsic statistical topological insulators, enforcing the symmetry exactly is guaranteed to destroy the topological phase. We define a mapping that addresses both issues and provides a unified framework for describing disordered topological matter.
