- **TL;DR**: 提出一种结合物理约束变分自编码器(pcVAE)与贝叶斯优化(BO)的混合机器学习框架，用于加速和改进晶体结构精修，特别针对缺陷敏感系统

Physical properties and functionalities of materials are dictated by global crystal structures as well as local defects. To establish a structure-property relationship, not only the crystallographic symmetry but also quantitative knowledge about defects are required. Here we present a hybrid Machine Learning framework that integrates a physically-constrained variational-autoencoder (pcVAE) with different Bayesian Optimization (BO) methods to systematically accelerate and improve crystal structure refinement with resolution of defects. We chose the pyrochlore structured Ho2Ti2O7 as a model system and employed the GSAS2 package for benchmarking crystallographic parameters from Rietveld refinement. However, the function space of these material systems is highly nonlinear, which limits optimizers like traditional Rietveld refinement, into trapping at local minima. Also, these naive methods don't provide an extensive learning about the overall function space, which is essential for large space, large time consuming explorations to identify various potential regions of interest. Thus, we present the approach of exploring the high Dimensional structure parameters of defect sensitive systems via pretrained pcVAE assisted BO and Sparse Axis Aligned BO. The pcVAE projects high-Dimensional diffraction data consisting of thousands of independently measured diffraction orders into a lowD latent space while enforcing scaling invariance and physical relevance. Then via BO methods, we aim to minimize the L2 norm based chisq errors in the real and latent spaces separately between experimental and simulated diffraction patterns, thereby steering the refinement towards potential optimum crystal structure parameters. We investigated and compared the results among different pcVAE assisted BO, non pcVAE assisted BO, and Rietveld refinement.

- **TL;DR**: 论文提出一个结合DFT稳定性分析和机器学习指标的材料生成模型评估框架，发现传统ML指标可能误导化学可行性判断，强调需要基于模拟的评估方法。

Generative models hold great promise for accelerating materials discovery, but their evaluation often overlooks the chemical validity and stability requirements crucial to real-world applications. Density Functional Theory (DFT) simulations are the gold standard for evaluating such properties but are computationally intensive and inaccessible to non-experts. We propose a chemically grounded, user-friendly evaluation framework that integrates DFT-based stability analysis with commonly used machine learning (ML) metrics. Through systematic experiments using both perturbative and generative methods, we demonstrate that conventional ML metrics can misrepresent chemical feasibility. To address this, we propose new insights on robust metrics and highlight the importance of simulation-informed evaluation for developing reliable generative models in materials science.

- **TL;DR**: AI发现新型二维超晶格Grokene，预测具有室温超导性，但二维特性导致相涨落限制实际转变温度，需通过多层堆叠等策略提升

We introduce Grokene, a novel two-dimensional superlattice derived from graphene, which was identified through an AI-guided materials discovery workflow utilizing a large language model. Grokene is predicted to exhibit ambient-pressure, room-temperature superconductivity, with computational simulations revealing a high electron-phonon coupling constant and a substantial logarithmic-averaged phonon frequency (~1650 K), leading to a mean-field critical temperature of approximately 325 K. Full isotropic Eliashberg solutions further support a critical temperature around 310 K, underscoring its strong potential for room-temperature superconductivity. However, the strict two-dimensional nature of Grokene introduces phase fluctuations, limiting the observable superconducting transition to a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) temperature of about 120 K in monolayers. To elevate TBKT toward room temperature, strategies such as few-layer stacking, substrate or gate engineering, and optimization of superlattice structure and doping levels are proposed. Our integrated workflow, combining AI-driven materials discovery with advanced many-body theories (DFPT/EPW, Eliashberg, and RPA), provides a systematic and reproducible framework for exploring novel superconductors. We suggest that experimental synthesis and comprehensive characterization of Grokene will be essential to assess these computational predictions and to explore routes toward practical superconductivity under ambient pressure.

- **TL;DR**: 在魔角附近，扭曲双层石墨烯中的扰动会在耦合的狄拉克锥之间传递并达到平衡，这种平衡行为在莫尔势本身被扰动时依然稳健。

Perturbations in moiré materials, such as due to substrates or strain, are common in many experiments and can significantly modify the electronic properties of the system. Here, we show that perturbations in twisted bilayer graphene tend to be transferred between the coupled Dirac cones, eventually reaching an equilibrium near the magic angle. We connect our results to experiments and show that this equilibrium behavior remains robust even when the moiré potential itself is perturbed. Our findings extend the notion of the magic angle to a more general regime governed by moiré-driven equilibrium.

### High-Level Ab Initio Investigation of the NH2 + O Reaction: Insights into the Potential Energy Surface and Kinetics

- **TL;DR**: 本文通过高精度理论方法构建了NH2O势能面，计算了NH2与O反应的热速率系数和分支比，为含氮燃料燃烧模型提供了准确动力学数据。

The reaction between NH2 and O represents a critical oxidation pathway in the combustion of ammonia and hydrazine. However, significant discrepancies persist among previous experimental and theoretical studies regarding its kinetics. In this work, we present a high-level theoretical characterization of the NH2O potential energy surface (PES) using the internally contracted multi-reference configuration interaction (ic-MRCI) method with the cc-pVTZ-F12 basis set. The full-dimensional PES was constructed via the permutation invariant polynomial-neural network (PIP-NN) approach, encompassing all energetically accessible channels, including HNO + H, NH + OH, NO + H2, and HON + H. Stationary points were characterized with particular attention to the intricate multi-reference nature of the system. Based on the refined PES, we computed thermal rate coefficients and branching ratios over a wide temperature range. Our results provide accurate, first-principles kinetic data that are essential for refining combustion models of nitrogen-containing fuels.

- **TL;DR**: 提出一种基于紧凑支撑体力场的新型RVE概念，通过FFT求解器和机器学习构建非局部替代算子，用于复杂材料均匀化

We consider static linear elastic composite materials (CMs) with periodic structure. The core of the proposed methodology is the generation of a novel dataset using specially designed body force fields with compact support (BFCS), enabling a new RVE concept that reduces the infinite periodic medium to a finite domain without boundary artifacts. This functionally reduced RVE is used for translated averaging of direct numerical simulations (DNS) results, efficiently computed via a newly developed FFT-based solver for BFCS loading. The resulting dataset captures localized field responses and is used to train machine learning (ML) and neural networks (NN) models to learn effective nonlocal surrogate operators. These operators accurately predict macroscopic responses while reflecting microstructural features and nonlocal interactions. By accounting for field localization while simultaneously eliminating influences from finite sample size and boundary effects, it provides a physically grounded and data-driven framework for constructing accurate surrogate models for the homogenization of complex materials.

Magnetic skyrmions are nanometric swirling spin textures that exhibit remarkable stability at finite temperatures, making them promising candidates for spintronic applications. Achieving controllable stability and transitions between distinct topological structures is crucial for practical implementations. In this work, we investigate the effect of uniaxial mechanical strain on a magnetic model on the kagome lattice, focusing on skyrmion stability and emergent topological phases. To this end, we consider a Heisenberg model that includes exchange interactions and both in-plane and out-of-plane Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. Using a combination of Spin-Lattice Dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations, we explore uniaxial strain variations in the range of $-10\%$ to $10\%$, showing important effects on the phase diagram. For compressive strain, we find that the density of skyrmions in the skyrmion gas (SkG) phase can be tuned and that the stability of this phase extends to higher temperatures. Tensile strain, in contrast, reduces the number of skyrmions and promotes transitions to other magnetic states. Within this regime, strain levels of about ($\sim4-6\%$) lead to a change in topological charge, turning skyrmions ($Q=-1$) into antiskyrmions ($Q=+1$). We also examine how strain affects other phases commonly appearing in skyrmion-hosting systems, such as the helical and fully polarized states, showing that mechanical deformation alters their stability and characteristic properties. Finally, we compare these results with the strain response of a more conventional skyrmion model, in order to clarify the role of the different interactions involved. Our results identify strain as an experimentally accessible route for engineering topological spin textures.

- **TL;DR**: 本文研究了稠密联想记忆网络的热力学熵产生，在中等记忆负载下分析了熵产生、记忆检索准确性和操作速度之间的权衡关系。

Dense Associative Memory networks (DenseAMs) unify several popular paradigms in Artificial Intelligence (AI), such as Hopfield Networks, transformers, and diffusion models - while casting their computational properties into the language of dynamical systems and energy landscapes. This formulation provides a natural setting for studying thermodynamics and computation in neural systems, because DenseAMs are simultaneously simple enough to admit analytic treatment and rich enough to implement nontrivial computational function. Aspects of these networks have been studied at equilibrium and at zero temperature, but the thermodynamic costs associated with their operation out of equilibrium are largely unexplored. Here, we define the thermodynamic entropy production associated with the operation of such networks, and study polynomial DenseAMs at intermediate memory load. At large system sizes, we use dynamical mean field theory to characterize work requirements and memory transition times when driving the system with corrupted memories. We find tradeoffs between entropy production, memory retrieval accuracy, and operation speed.

### Symmetry and Topology in the Non-Hermitian Kitaev chain

- **TL;DR**: 非厄米Kitaev链中粒子-空穴对称性保持，拓扑相变点与周期系统一致，零能Majorana模成对出现抵消非厄米趋肤效应，激发态则显示趋肤效应。

We investigate the non-Hermitian Kitaev chain with non-reciprocal hopping amplitudes and asymmetric superconducting pairing. We work out the symmetry structure of the model and show that particle-hole symmetry (PHS) is preserved throughout the entire parameter regime. As a consequence of PHS, the topological phase transition point of a finite open chain coincides with that of the periodic (infinite) system. By explicitly constructing the zero-energy wave functions (Majorana modes), we show that Majorana modes necessarily occur as reciprocal localization pairs accumulating on opposite boundaries, whose combined probability density exhibits an exact cancellation of the non-Hermitian skin effect for the zero energy modes. Excited states, by contrast, generically display skin-effect localization, with particle and hole components accumulating at opposite ends of the system. At the level of bulk topology, we further construct a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant in restricted parameter regimes that correctly distinguishes the topological and trivial phases. Finally, we present the topological phase diagram of the non-Hermitian Kitaev chain across a broad range of complex parameters and delineate the associated phase boundaries.

### Ion Clustering Regulated by Extreme Nanoconfinement Enables Mechanosensitive Nanochannels

- **TL;DR**: 该论文提出了一种受晶体管启发的"力-离子晶体管"机制，通过调节纳米通道内的电荷载流子密度来控制离子传输，而非依赖传统的构象变化。

Mechanosensitive ion nanochannels regulate transport by undergoing conformational changes within nanopores. However, achieving precise control over these conformational states remains a major challenge for both artificial soft or solid pores. Here, we propose an alternative mechanism that modulates the charge carrier density inside nanopores, inspired by transistors in solid-state electronics. This strategy leverages a novel phenomenon of confinement-regulated ion clustering in two-dimensional extremely confined nanochannels, revealed by extensive $μ$s-scale enhanced-sampling molecular simulations based on an \emph{ab initio}-refined force field and nucleation theory. The resulting \emph{force-ion transistor} enables mechanically gated control of ion transport and provides a conceptual foundation for designing ionic mechanical logic gates. Our findings offer new insights into piezochannel mechanosensing and electromechanical coupling in biosystems beyond conformational signaling, opening pathways to integrate artificial ion channels with neuromorphic devices for processing mechanical stimuli.

### AutoPot: Automated and massively parallelized construction of Machine-Learning Potentials

- **TL;DR**: AutoPot：基于BlackDynamite和Motoko的自动化机器学习势构建软件，支持从候选训练集中选择配置、分子动力学模拟中的在线选择，使用MLIP-2中的MTP势和VASP进行单点计算。

Machine-learning potentials (MLIPs) have been a breakthrough for computational physics in bringing the accuracy of quantum mechanics to atomistic modeling. To achieve near-quantum accuracy, it is necessary that neighborhoods contained in the training set are rather close to the ones encountered during a simulation. Yet, constructing a single training set that works well for all applications is, and likely will remain, infeasible, so, one strategy is to supplement training protocols for MLIPs with additional learning methods, such as active learning, or fine-tuning. This strategy, however, yields very complex training protocols that are difficult to implement efficiently, and cumbersome to interpret, analyze, and reproduce.
  To address the above difficulties, we propose AutoPot, a software for automating the construction and archiving of MLIPs. AutoPot is based on BlackDynamite, a software operating parametric tasks, e.g., running simulations, or single-point ab initio calculations, in a highly-parallelized fashion, and Motoko, an event-based workflow manager for orchestrating interactions between the tasks. The initial version of AutoPot supports selection of training configurations from large training candidate sets, and on-the-fly selection from molecular dynamics simulations, using Moment Tensor Potentials as implemented in MLIP-2, and single-point calculations of the selected training configurations using VASP. Another strength of AutoPot is its flexibility: BlackDynamite tasks and orchestrators are Python functions to which own existing code can be easily added and manipulated without writing complex parsers. Therefore, it will be straightforward to add other MLIP and ab initio codes, and manipulate the Motoko orchestrators to implement other training protocols.

### Strain-triggered high-temperature superconducting transition in two-dimensional carbon allotrope

- **TL;DR**: 通过双轴拉伸应变可在二维碳同素异形体THO-石墨烯中诱导超导转变，最高超导转变温度达45K

Driving non-superconducting materials into a superconducting state through specific modulation is a key focus in the field of superconductivity. Pressure is a powerful method that can switch a three-dimensional (3D) material between non-superconducting and superconducting states. In the two-dimensional (2D) case, strain engineering plays a similar role to pressure. However, purely strain-induced superconductivity in 2D systems remains exceedingly scarce. Using first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that a superconducting transition can be induced solely by applying biaxial tensile strain in a 2D carbon allotrope, THO-graphene, which is composed of triangles, hexagons, and octagons. Free-standing THO-graphene is non-superconducting. Surprisingly, the electron-phonon coupling in strained THO-graphene is enhanced strong enough to pair electrons and realize superconductivity, with the highest superconducting transition temperature reaching 45 K. This work not only provides a notable example of controlling metal-superconductor transition in 2D system just via strain, but also sets a new record of superconducting transition temperature for 2D elemental superconductors.

Excitonic insulators host the condensates of bound electron-hole pairs, offering a platform for studying correlated bosonic quantum states. Yet, how macroscopic coherence emerges from locally collapsed pairing remains elusive. Here, using scanning tunnelling spectroscopy, we report the impurity-induced pair breaking in an excitonic insulator Ta2Pd3Te5. Individual Te vacancies are found to generate a pair of spectral peaks within the excitonic gap. Their energies depend sensitively on the defect configurations and are continuously tunable by tip electric field, indicating controllable impurity scatterings. Spectral mapping shows spatially anisotropic and electronically coupled electron-hole components of the subgap states. These observations, together with mean-field modelling, suggest an excitonic pair-breaking origin. In the strongly electron-hole imbalanced region, a secondary pair-breaking effect, manifesting as an additional pair of subgap states with distinctly lower energies, can emerge, presenting the interplay of pairing breakings with different excitonic order parameters. Our findings demonstrate the spectroscopic 'fingerprint' of local excitonic depairing at the atomic level, offering a crucial clue to the critical behavior across excitonic condensation.

### Thermodynamic geometry of friction on graphs: Resistance, commute times, and optimal transport

- **TL;DR**: 该论文证明了可逆马尔可夫链的耗散热力学摩擦度量等价于通勤时间几何和电阻距离两种图论几何，揭示了线性响应耗散是概率在状态空间网络固有几何中传输的能量成本。

We demonstrate that for slowly driven reversible Markov chains, the thermodynamic friction metric governing dissipation is equivalent to two independently developed graph-theoretic geometries: commute-time geometry and resistance distance. This equivalence yields complementary physical insights: the commute-time metric provides the local Euclidean description of the thermodynamic manifold, while the resistance distance maps dissipation to power loss in an electrical network. We further show that this metric arises from a discrete $L^2$-Wasserstein transport cost evaluated along paths of equilibrium distributions, extending a correspondence previously shown for continuous-state processes. These results unify linear-response, electrical-resistance, random-walk, and optimal-transport frameworks, revealing linear-response dissipation as the energetic cost of transporting probability through the intrinsic geometry of the state-space network.

Rigorous quantum dynamics calculations provide essential insights into complex scattering phenomena across atomic and molecular physics, chemical reaction dynamics, and astrochemistry. However, the application of the gold-standard quantum coupled-channel (CC) method has been fundamentally constrained by a steep cubic scaling of computational cost [${O}(N^3)$]. Here, we develop a general, rigorous, and robust method for solving the time-independent Schrödinger equation for a single column of the scattering S-matrix with quadratic scaling [${O}(N^2)$] in the number of channels. The Weinberg-regularized Iterative Series Expansion (WISE) algorithm resolves the divergence issues affecting iterative techniques by applying a regularization procedure to the kernel of the multichannel Lippmann-Schwinger integral equation. The method also explicitly incorporates closed-channel effects, including those responsible for multichannel Feshbach resonances. We demonstrate the power of this approach by performing rigorous calculations on He + CO and CO + N$_2$ collisions, achieving exact quantum results with demonstrably quadratic scaling. Our results establish a new computational paradigm, enabling state-to-state quantum scattering computations for complex molecular systems and providing a novel window onto the intricate multichannel molecular collision dynamics.

Variational principles are a unifying mathematical framework across many areas of physics, yet their instruction at the undergraduate level remains primarily analytical. This work presents a pedagogically oriented and computationally enhanced approach to variational modeling that integrates contemporary tools including gradient descent, automatic differentiation, and Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). Classical variational problems are reformulated as optimization tasks and implemented using open-source Python libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, PyTorch, and JAX. The proposed approach is demonstrated through a progression of problems drawn from standard undergraduate curricula, including the derivation of Snell's law from Fermat's principle, projectile motion with and without viscous drag, simple harmonic motion, nonlinear pendulum with damping, steady-state heat conduction governed by the Laplace and Poisson equations with nonlinear temperature-dependent internal heat generation, the double pendulum via the principle of least action, and variational treatments of vibrating strings. In addition, quantum mechanical applications are presented through variational solutions of the hydrogen atom, helium atom, and a schematic nuclear model of the silicon nucleus, illustrating the breadth of the framework across classical, quantum, and nuclear physics. The approach aims to enhance conceptual understanding while simultaneously introducing students to modern computational research methodologies.

LaRh2X2 (X = Al, Ga, In) compounds crystallize in a tetragonal layered ThCr2Si2-type structure and belong to a family of low critical temperature superconductors. Using first-principles density functional theory calculations implemented in the CASTEP code, we systematically investigated their structural, mechanical, elastic, electronic, vibrational, thermophysical, and optical properties for the first time. The optimized structural parameters show good agreement with available experimental data. The Born stability criteria and negative formation energies confirm the mechanical and thermodynamic stability of these materials. Poisson and Pugh ratios indicate a ductile nature, while low Debye and melting temperatures together with low Vickers hardness suggest that the compounds are relatively soft. The electronic band structures and density of states reveal metallic behavior. Charge density distribution and Mulliken population analysis indicate mixed covalent, ionic, and metallic bonding. The calculated Fermi surfaces contain both hole-like and electron-like sheets, suggesting possible multiband characteristics. Phonon dispersion analysis confirms the dynamical stability of LaRh2Al2 and LaRh2Ga2, while LaRh2In2 shows dynamical instability associated with a possible structural phase transition. Optical property analysis indicates that these superconductors may be promising candidates for high-density optical data storage applications. The estimated electron-phonon coupling constant of about 0.56 indicates that LaRh2X2 compounds are weakly coupled low critical temperature superconductors.

We study ultrafast magneto-photocurrents in a three-dimensional topological insulator. For this purpose, we excite (In$_r$Bi$_{1-r}$)$_2$Se$_3$ thin films with a femtosecond laser pulse in the presence of an external magnetic field $B_{\text{ext}}$ up to 0.3 T parallel to the film plane. The resulting in-plane photocurrent is measured by detecting the emitted terahertz (THz) electromagnetic pulse. It scales linearly with $B_{\text{ext}}$ and is perpendicular to $B_{\text{ext}}$. Strikingly, for $r\ge$4%, we observe an abrupt photocurrent reduction, which is strongly correlated with the Indium-induced quenching of the topological surface states. The rise time, decay time and amplitude of the THz magneto-photocurrent can consistently be explained by a scenario in which optically excited spin-polarized electrons propagate toward the film surface where the accumulated spin is converted into an in-plane charge current due to spin-velocity locking. Our results are highly relevant for contact-free probing of spin-charge conversion in systems with paramagnetic rather than spontaneous magnetic order.

..In this work, we investigate generalized symmetries, with particular emphasis on non-invertible ones, in three-dimensional non-Abelian topological orders hosting both particle- and loop-like excitations. We adopt a continuum topological field theory description, focusing on twisted $BF$ theories with gauge group $G=\prod_i \mathbb{Z}_{N_i}$ and an $a \wedge a \wedge b$ twisted term. This field theory supports Borromean-Rings braiding and realizes non-Abelian topological order, which for $G=(\mathbb{Z}_2)^3$ admits a microscopic realization via the $\mathbb{D}_4$ Kitaev quantum double lattice model. We systematically identify all generalized symmetry operators by extracting conserved currents from the equations of motion. Two distinct classes of currents emerge: type-I currents, which generate invertible higher-form symmetries, and type-II currents, which give rise to non-invertible higher-form symmetries. The non-invertibility originates from projectors accompanying the symmetry operators, which restrict admissible gauge-field configurations. We further analyze the fusion rules of these symmetries, showing that invertible symmetries admit inverses, while non-invertible symmetries fuse through multiple channels. Finally, we study mixed anomalies among these generalized symmetries by simultaneously coupling multiple currents to proper types of background gauge fields and examining their gaugeability. We identify two types of mixed anomalies: one cancellable by topological field theories in one higher dimension, and another representing an intrinsic gauging obstruction encoded in the $(3+1)$D continuum topological field theory...

Cellular automata (CA) are discrete-time dynamical systems with local update rules on a lattice. Despite their elementary definition, CA support a wide spectrum of macroscopic phenomena central to statistical physics: equilibrium and nonequilibrium phase transitions, transport and hydrodynamic limits, kinetic roughening, self-organized criticality, and complex spatiotemporal correlations. This survey focuses on three tightly connected themes. \emph{(i)} We present a structural view of CA as shift-commuting maps on configuration spaces, emphasizing rule complexity, reversibility, and conservation laws (including discrete continuity equations). \emph{(ii)} We organize transport in CA into ballistic, diffusive, and anomalous regimes, and connect microscopic currents to macroscopic laws through Green--Kubo formulas, scaling theory, and universality classes. \emph{(iii)} We develop correlation-based methods -- from structure factors and response formulas to computational mechanics and data-driven inference -- that diagnose regimes and enable coarse-graining.

The photogalvanic effect is the generation of a second-order direct current by illumination of a non-centrosymmetric material. In this work, we develop a fully first-principles quantum kinetic theory based on density matrix formalism to calculate the photogalvanic current in all time regimes: transient and steady. Unlike past \textit{ab-initio} studies which focused only on the photo-excitation process, our first-principles theory framework encodes all quantum scatterings (intra/interband relaxation and electron-hole recombination) mediated by bosons (photons and phonons), and is thus predictive of photogalvanic currents in realistic materials. In particular, for the linear photogalvanic effect, we find electron scatterings mediated by phonons contribute significantly to the shift current for prototypical piezoelectrics like BaTiO$_3$. This explains the theoretical underestimation of the experimental photogalvanic current in previous \textit{ab-initio} work. For the circular photogalvanic effect, we present the first self-consistent theory of a steady injection current that incorporates realistic scattering mediated by phonons. New formulas for the photogalvanic currents are presented which elucidate their connection with fundamental quantum-geometric quantities such as the Berry curvature and the quantum metric. A phonon-based explanation is proposed for the bipolar transient photogalvanic current observed by the THz emission spectroscopy.

- **TL;DR**: 硫化锌纳米颗粒的表面能决定其结构、性质与存在形式。研究表明纤锌矿比闪锌矿表面能更低，导致纳米尺度下相稳定性反转，10nm以下纤锌矿更稳定。

Surface energetics of zinc sulfide nanoparticles determines their structure, properties, and occurrence. Using a combination of experimental techniques, we investigated the thermodynamics of the two polymorphs, sphalerite and wurtzite at bulk and nanoscale to understand their occurrence. Calorimetric measurements confirmed that wurtzite has a lower surface energy than sphalerite, which causes a reversal in phase stability at the nanoscale, with wurtzite energetically stable for particle size below 10 nm. Taking these surface energies into account, a simple model of the thermodynamics of the sphalerite - wurtzite transformation as a function of particle size and temperature can explain the occurrence of the zinc sulfide polymorphs in environments as diverse as ore bodies and planetary atmospheres.

- **TL;DR**: 提出一种针对刚性动力系统的神经算子学习方法，通过刚度感知缩放、快速方向激发和雅可比诊断来保持谱保真度，显著提高刚性算子的学习精度。

Stiff dynamical systems represent a central challenge in multi scale modeling across combustion, chemical kinetics, and nonlinear dynamical systems. Neural operator learning has recently emerged as a promising approach to approximate dynamical generators from data, yet stiffness imposes severe obstacles: training errors concentrate on slow manifold states, collapse of fast dynamics occurs, and the learned operator may fail to reproduce the true eigenstructure.
  We demonstrate three key advances enabling accurate learning of stiff operators and preserving spectral fidelity: (i) stiffness aware scaling of time derivatives, (ii) fast direction excitation via local trajectory cloud bursts, and (iii) autograd-based Jacobian diagnostics ensuring eigenstructure fidelity. Applied to the Davis-Skodje system, the approach recovers both slow and fast modes across stiffness regimes, reducing fast eigenvalue error by an order of magnitude while improving rollout fidelity. These results argue that spectral fidelity - not trajectory accuracy alone - should be a first-class target in data driven learning of stiff operators.

### Tripling of the Superconducting Critical Current Density in BaFe$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$ Retained After Pressure Release

Superconducting performance is tunable not only via chemical modification or defect engineering, but also through external parameters such as pressure, though this method remains less readily accessible. In this work, we study how compression influences vortex dynamics and critical currents in an iron-based superconductor. Specifically, we perform magnetization measurements using an off-the-shelf pressure cell to investigate the effects of hydrostatic pressures up to 1.08 GPa on the magnetic properties of BaFe$_2$(As$_{0.62}$P$_{0.38}$)$_2$ crystals across a range of temperatures $T$ and magnetic fields $H$. Although these pressures minimally affect the superconducting critical temperature, they produce a clear increase in the critical current density $J_c(T,H)$, a pronounced reduction in the rate of thermally activated vortex motion $S(T,H)$, and can change the dominant vortex pinning mechanism. Furthermore, the effects of pressure are irreversible: after pressurization and subsequent release at room temperature, the crystals retain their enhanced critical current densities. The second magnetization peak vanishes at 22 K after the pressure cycle, which we attribute to a transition from predominantly $δκ$ pinning to a mixed mechanism of $δT_c$ and surface pinning. Lastly, a threefold increase in $J_c$ and more than 40\% reduction in $S$ at 8~K and 0.5~T was achieved after $1-2$ pressure cycles. These findings demonstrate the potential utility of pressure cycling for improving $J_c$, which may offer a simpler alternative to approaches such as chemical doping or the introduction of artificial pinning centers.

- **TL;DR**: 将扫描隧道显微镜（STM）与微机电系统（MEMS）结合，在低温下以皮米级空间精度测量高深宽比MEMS谐振器的声学模式，无需激光或电容耦合，实现微扰检测。

Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) have traditionally addressed vastly different length scales - one resolving atoms, the other engineering macroscopic motion. Here we unite these two fields to perform minimally invasive-measurements of high aspect-ratio MEMS resonators using the STM tip as both actuator and detector. Operating at cryogenic temperatures, we resolve acoustic modes of millimeter-scale, high-Q membranes with picometer spatial precision, without making use of lasers or capacitive coupling. The tunneling junction introduces negligible back-action or heating, enabling direct access to the intrinsic dynamics of microgram-mass oscillators. In this work we explore three different measurement modalities, each offering unique advantages. Combined, they provide a pathway to quantum-level readout and exquisite high-precision measurements of forces, displacements, and pressures at cryogenic conditions. This technique provides a general platform for minimally-perturbative detection across a wide range of nanomechanical and quantum devices.

The competition between Coulomb repulsion and kinetic energy in correlated systems can allow electrons to crystallize into Wigner solids. Despite researches across diverse two-dimensional Wigner platforms, the microscopic melting processes through possible intermediate phases remains largely unknown. Here, we present the visualization of electron-lattice melting in monolayer VCl3 on graphite, where two Wigner crystals coexist with markedly different critical temperatures Tc and lattice periods as stabilized by high magnetic field. One Wigner crystal possesses both record-high Tc and electron density, and undergoes melting through an intermediate nematic phase upon decreasing magnetic field. In contrast, the other Wigner crystal with a lower Tc yields a different intermediate phase during melting, exhibiting an anomalous electron liquid with an energy-independent modulation period. First-principles calculations corroborate the band-selective occupations of interface-transferred electrons in the formation of dual Wigner crystals. Our atomically resolved intermediate phases provide crucial insights into the microscopic melting pathways of Wigner crystals, enabling a phase diagram parameterized by both quantum and thermal fluctuations.

- **TL;DR**: 研究发现滑翔飞行遵循普遍运输定律：超过短弹道时间后，水平运动持续呈亚弹道性，赫斯特指数约0.88，与飞行器类型无关，源于热气流搜索的间歇性和方向相关性。

Cross-country soaring flights rely on intermittent atmospheric updrafts to cover long distances, producing trajectories that alternate between rapid relocation and local exploration. From a large dataset of paraglider, hang glider, and sailplane flights, we uncover a universal transport law: beyond short ballistic times, horizontal motion is persistently sub-ballistic, with a Hurst exponent $\approx 0.88$ largely independent of aircraft type. Phase-resolved analysis using a probabilistic segmentation method shows that this scaling arises from the fundamentally intermittent, two-dimensional, and directionally correlated nature of soaring transport, in which successive ballistic segments do not add coherently. We find that learning, in the sense of experience-driven improvements in exploration and decision-making, manifests primarily in the search phase, enhancing the ability to efficiently probe the air mass and locate the next thermal. Overall, our results suggest that atmospheric structure and the generic organization of the transition-search-climb cycle dominate transport properties, placing human soaring alongside biological and physical systems where anomalous transport emerges from intermittency and persistence.

### Landscape of grain boundary migration in polycrystals

Grain boundary (GB) migration is a pivotal process that significantly impacts the development of microstructures, thereby influencing the practical performance of polycrystalline materials. Recent advances in 3D experimental techniques have revealed conflicts between observed GB migration behaviors and classical theoretical models. These contradictions raise two fundamental questions, namely, whether GB migration is linearly related to curvature, and how GB energy affect GB migration? Here, we provide a comprehensive analysis of GB migration dynamics in polycrystals and resolve these conflicts within a theoretical framework. Unexpectedly, in a polycrystalline system, the range of GB migration velocities shows little correlation with the magnitude of its curvature. The extent of the influence of GB energy on GB migration is revealed to mostly depend on GB step energy. Finally, a more general GB migration formula is derived to incorporate various driving forces beyond curvature.

The amorphous structure of nanoporous carbon electrodes in supercapacitors complicates the establishment of clear links between electrode geometry and capacitance. In this work, we examine how specific structural features govern charge storage and explain capacitance variations among carbide-derived carbon (CDC) electrodes. Two key methodological and mechanistic advances are introduced. First, we propose a physically motivated, electric-field-based definition of the ion sphere of influence, which avoids the ambiguity of radial distribution function-based cutoffs and enables a more reliable characterization of local ion--electrode interactions. Second, we introduce an ion-resolved channel-width descriptor that quantifies pore accessibility by identifying the narrowest passage a counter-ion must traverse to enter a pore, directly linking accessibility to ion decoordination. Using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of supercapacitors comprising realistic CDC electrodes and a room-temperature ionic liquid electrolyte under applied potentials, we show that carbon atoms located at the edges of graphitic sheets consistently accumulate higher charge than basal-plane atoms across all electrode types. The fraction of edge atoms increases with structural disorder and correlates with enhanced capacitance, in agreement with recent experimental findings linking disorder to charge storage. Furthermore, analysis of pore size and channel width reveals that ion decoordination is governed primarily by channel width rather than pore size alone. Together, these results establish edge atom concentration and pore channel width as decisive structural descriptors controlling charge accumulation in nanoporous carbon supercapacitors, providing clear design guidelines for optimizing electrode architectures.

We present a finite-temperature extension of density matrix embedding theory (FT-DMET) for realistic crystalline systems. We describe a practical framework for constructing extended bath orbitals, solving the embedding problem, and performing DMET self-consistency at finite temperature. To reduce computational cost, we introduce strategies based on mutual-information-guided bath truncation, controlled treatment of the thermal electron number without explicit optimization, and the use of low-temperature impurity solvers and one-shot FT-DMET in the low-temperature regime. We apply this approach to periodic hydrogen chains and square lattices to characterize their finite-temperature phases. We observe the Pomeranchuk-like effect in one dimension and enhanced stability of long-range order in two dimensions.

The discovery of LaSc$_{2}$H$_{24}$ represents a milestone in the quest for room-temperature superconductivity, yet the microscopic mechanism underlying its superior performance remains unclear. Through a comprehensive revisit of theoretical calculations, we uncover a pivotal transition from the anisotropic two-gap superconductivity of LaH$_{10}$ to the isotropic single-gap superconductivity in LaSc$_{2}$H$_{24}$ upon the introduction of scandium, thereby enhancing the superconducting critical temperature ($T_\mathrm{c}$). This enhancement is rooted in a critical dual role of Sc $3d$ electrons: i) the Sc-derived Jahn-Teller effect promotes hydrogen metallization via the elongation of specific interlayer H-H bonds and enhances electron-phonon coupling (EPC) through the softening of associated phonon modes; ii) Sc $3d$ electrons reconstruct the electronic structure into an MgB$_{2}$-like configuration, generating novel Sc-H-Sc $σ$- and $π$-bonding states with EPC strengths comparable to LaH$_{10}$. Crucially, the pronounced hybridization between Sc and the hydrogen cages effectively unifies these two contributions on the Fermi surface. This Sc-induced gap unification bridges the high-EPC H-H states with widespread Sc-H states, establishing an isotropic single-gap nature with a large overall EPC strength. Our findings identify this Sc-induced gap unification as the fundamental mechanism for achieving room-temperature superconductivity in LaSc$_{2}$H$_{24}$, offering a theoretical blueprint for the future design of superior superconducting hydrides.

Realizing Chern insulators with Chern numbers greater than one remains a major goal in quantum materials research. Such platforms promise multichannel dissipationless chiral transport and access to correlated phases beyond the conventional C = 1 paradigm. Here, we discover a family of high-Chern-number orbital magnets in twisted monolayer-multilayer rhombohedral graphene, denoted (1+n) with n = 3, 4, and 5. Magnetotransport measurements show pronounced anomalous Hall effects at one and three electrons per moiré unit cell when they are polarized away from the moiré interface. Across the (1+n) systems, we observe a clear topological hierarchy C = n, revealed by the Středa trajectories and the quantized Hall resistance. Our experimental observations are supported by self-consistent mean-field calculations. Moreover, we realize both electrical and magnetic switching of the high-Chern-number states by flipping the valley polarization. Together, these results establish a tunable hierarchy of orbital Chern magnets in twisted rhombohedral graphene, offering systematic control of Chern number and topology through layer engineering in pristine graphene moiré systems.

The $m$=2 member of the monophosphate tungsten bronze family has been considered the only one in the family without an electronic instability at low temperature. In this paper, we report the discovery of a charge density wave phase in this compound, with a transition temperature of 290 K and an incommensurate modulation vector \textbf{q}=0.245\textbf{b*}+ $\upxi$\textbf{c*}. The presence of this new phase is confirmed by diffraction and resistivity measurements. Pre-transitional dynamics are investigated using diffuse and inelastic x-ray scattering, revealing a clear Kohn anomaly. We analyze both structural and electronic contributions to the phase transition, providing a comprehensive picture of the mechanism driving this newly identified instability.

- **TL;DR**: 本文开发了随机门控首次通过时间问题的更新理论，将样本路径分解为体扩散和瞬时吸附/解吸事件的交替序列，为在FTP问题中纳入随机门控提供了通用数学框架。

There are a wide range of first passage time (FTP) problems in the physical and life sciences that can be modelled in terms of a Brownian particle binding to a reactive surface (absorption). However, prior to absorption, the particle may undergo several rounds of surface attachment (adsorption), detachment (desorption) and diffusion. Alternatively, the surface may be stochastically gated so that absorption can only occur when the gate is open. In both cases one can view each return to the surface as a renewal event. In this paper we develop a renewal theory for stochastically gated FTP problems along analogous lines to previous work on adsorption/desorption processes. We proceed by constructing a renewal equation that relates the joint probability density for particle position and the state of a gate (or multiple gates) to the probability density and FPT density for a totally absorbing (non-gated) boundary. This essentially decomposes sample paths into an alternating sequence of bulk diffusion and instantaneous adsorption/desorption events, which is terminated when adsorption coincides with an open gate. Through a variety of examples, we show how renewal theory provides a general mathematical framework for incorporating stochastic gating into FTP problems.

The orbital Hall effect (OHE) in light transition metals offers a promising route to generate orbital torques for efficient magnetization control, providing an alternative to conventional spin Hall effect approaches that rely on heavy metals. We demonstrate perpendicular magnetization switching in [Co/Pt]3 multilayers driven by the OHE in a light 3d transition metal nitride, VN, with 111-texture of face-center cubic structure. Second harmonic Hall measurement reveals a large torque efficiency of -0.41 in the VN(7.5 nm)/[Co(0.35nm)/Pt(0.3 nm)]3, which significantly surpasses that in the control samples with Co, Py, and CoFeB ferromagnets, suggesting strong conversion of orbital current originating from VN to spin current by [Co/Pt]3 ferromagnet. Full switching by in-plane current is achieved with an in-plane magnetic field, while partial field-free switching occurs without it. The critical current density for the switching is found to be comparable to that of the W-based spin-orbit torque device. First-principles calculations confirm a large orbital Hall conductivity in VN, with a small spin Hall conductivity around the Fermi energy. Our results highlight the potential in the combination of light 3d transition metal nitrides and Co/Pt ferromagnetic multilayer with 111-texture to maximize the magnetization switching efficiency of orbitronic devices.

- **TL;DR**: 使用DFT方法研究C36和O@C36富勒烯异构体的理论分析，发现不同异构体具有显著不同的性质，氧封装影响电子性质和光谱特征。

In this study, we conducted a theoretical analysis of specific C36 and O@C36 Fullerene isomers, namely those with (D3h, C1, Cs, C2, D2) symmetries, in the gaseous phase using the DFT method at B3LYP/6-31G* level. We studied geometry optimizations, relative stability, atomization energies, Fermi energy, energy gap, electronic properties, electric dipole moment, polarizabilities, and thermodynamic analysis, along with IR and NMR spectra. Consistently, our findings revealed distinct properties and characteristics among different C36 fullerene isomers. The energetic order of C36 fullerene isomers was established as C36-D3h &lt; C36-C1 &lt; C36-Cs &lt; C36-C2 &lt; C36-D2, a trend unaffected by the encapsulation of oxygen. Notably, the D2 isomer displayed the smallest energy gap, indicating higher electrical conductivity compared to other isomers, while it exhibited the largest gap after encapsulation. Furthermore, we observed that the C1 (D2) isomer exhibited the largest (smallest) Electric dipole moment among the studied C36 isomers, whereas the C2 (D2) isomer demonstrated the largest Electric dipole moment among the O@C36 isomers studied. The encapsulation of oxygen in C36 isomers influenced their properties, including alterations in electronic properties, IR, and NMR chemical shifts. A detailed analysis of BSSE corrections showed the tininess of their impact on the analyzed observables, such that uncorrected and BSSE-corrected calculations led to nearly identical results, confirming the robustness and reliability of the B3LYP/6-31G* approach used in this work and, eventually, in other large and rigid fullerenes systems.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究通过高分辨率角分辨光电子能谱揭示了AV₃Sb₅系列kagome超导体中普遍存在的电子结构，发现了多个亚晶格纯的van Hove奇异点，这些奇异点由强V-d/Sb-p杂化驱动，并与电荷密度波序密切相关。

Kagome materials offer a versatile platform for exploring correlated and topological quantum states, where van Hove singularities (VHSs) play a pivotal role in driving electronic instabilities, exhibiting distinct behaviors depending on electron filling and interaction settings. In the recently discovered kagome superconductors $\textit{A}$V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ ($\textit{A}$ = K, Rb, Cs), unconventional charge density wave order, superconductivity, and electronic chirality emerge, yet the nature of VHSs near the Fermi level ($\textit{E}$$_{F}$) and their connection to these exotic orders remain elusive. Here, using high-resolution polarization-dependent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we uncover a universal electronic structure across $\textit{A}$V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ that is distinct from density-functional theory predictions that show noticeable discrepancies. We identify multiple common sublattice-pure VHSs near $\textit{E}$$_{F}$, arising from strong V-$\textit{d}$/Sb-$\textit{p}$ hybridization, which significantly promote bond-order fluctuations and likely drive the observed charge density wave order. These findings provide direct spectroscopic evidence for hybridization-driven VHS formation in kagome metals and establish a unified framework for understanding the intertwined electronic instabilities in $\textit{A}$V$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$.

Bound states in the continuum, originally proposed within the framework of quantum mechanics, have since been observed in a variety of physical contexts, including electromagnetism, acoustics, and optics. Of particular interest are those bound states in the continuum that are protected by continuous symmetries, as their stability makes them resistant to structural imperfections and material disorder. In this study, we demonstrate the existence of topologically protected bound states in the continuum by coupling a finite Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain to a metallic lead. These states are characterized by distinct features in the electrical response of the system, serving as a direct indication of their topological origin. The inherent robustness of such topologically protected states highlights their potential applications in fault-tolerant quantum information processing as well as in the design of advanced electronic and photonic devices.

We present a pseudospin formulation for the post-quench dynamics of charge-density-wave (CDW) order in the half-filled spinless Holstein model on a square lattice, assuming spatially homogeneous evolution. This Anderson pseudospin description captures the coherent nonequilibrium dynamics of the coupled electron-lattice system. Numerical simulations reveal three distinct dynamical regimes of the CDW order parameter following a quench-locked oscillations, Landau-damped dynamics, and overdamped relaxation-closely paralleling quench dynamics in BCS superconductors and other electronically driven symmetry-breaking phases. Crucially, however, the presence of dynamical lattice degrees of freedom leads to qualitatively different long-time behavior. In particular, while the oscillation amplitude is reduced in the damped regimes, CDW oscillations do not fully decay but instead persist indefinitely due to feedback from the lattice field. We further show that these persistent oscillations are characterized by a nonequilibrium electronic distribution, which provides an intuitive understanding of both their amplitude and the renormalization of the oscillation frequency relative to the bare Holstein phonon frequency. Our results highlight the essential role of lattice dynamics in nonequilibrium ordered phases and establish a clear distinction between electron-lattice-driven CDW dynamics and their purely electronic counterparts.

The Jarzynski equality, which relates equilibrium free-energy difference to an average of non-equilibrium work, plays a central role in modern non-equilibrium statistical thermodynamics. In this paper, we study a weaker consequence of this relation, known as Jarzynski's inequality, which can be formally obtained from the Jarzynski equality via Jensen's inequality. We identify and analyze several extensions of Jarzynski's inequality that go beyond its direct derivation from the Jarzynski equality. In particular, we consider chemical systems both in the linear-response regime and away from linear thermodynamics. Furthermore, by employing functional-integral techniques, we extend Jarzynski's inequality to many-body statistical systems described by quantum field theory. Salient issues, such as connections of the Jarzynski inequality with the maximum work theorem and the Landau--Lifshitz theory of fluctuations, are also discussed.

We present STENSOR, a new computational tool integrated into the Bilbao Crystallographic Server, designed for the automatic calculation of symmetry-adapted tensors under spin group symmetry. The program requires either a file containing the structural data of the magnetic compound or the generators of the oriented spin point group, together with the so-called generalized Jahn symbol associated to the tensor of interest. The user can propose any arbitrary tensor type or select a particular one from a predefined list. The program output returns the symmetry-adapted tensor under the spin point group and also under the magnetic point group, which is also calculated. The comparison of these two tensor forms allows to distinguish the coefficients that are due to spin-orbit coupling effects from those that have a non-relativistic origin and thus are usually more important. A couple of examples are given to illustrate the operation of the program.

The liquid-vapor critical behavior of water is strongly influenced by both ionic solutes and confinement. Molecular dynamics simulations of aqueous NaCl solutions using the TIP4P/2005 water model and the Madrid-2019 ion parameters reveal a systematic increase in the liquid-vapor critical temperature and pressure with salt concentration, consistent with experimental trends. In contrast, confinement between parallel hydrophobic plates leads to a depression of the critical point. The critical temperature was determined from the Binder cumulant crossing in the NVT ensemble, using a recently developed method originally applied to an active Brownian particle system. The reliability of this approach was verified through complementary NPT simulations. We further demonstrate the pronounced sensitivity of the estimated critical point to the van der Waals cutoff distance, underscoring the importance of properly accounting for long-range interactions. Our framework, which employs and tests an adjusted subbox method, can be readily extended to other critical phenomena, including the liquid-liquid critical point of water.

### Fast and Slow Sound Excitations in Nematic Aerogel in superfluid 3He

Nematic aerogel (nAG) supports so-called polar phase in liquid 3He. The experiments by [Dmitriev et al, JETP Lett. 112, 780 (2020)] showed that the onset of polar phase inside the nAG is accompanied by emergence of a sound wave with frequency quickly growing with cooling down from transition temperature and reaching a plateau. To describe this behavior, we start by calculating the elastic properties of the dry nematic AG that appear to depend only on Young's modulus of the parent material (e.g. mullite), the volume fraction of the solid phase and the aspect ratio of the representative volume of nAG. The elastic constants are then used to solve elasto-hydrodynamic equations for various sound vibrations of nAG filled with 3He. The (isotropic) first sound and anisotropic second sound in the polar phase are strongly hybridized with fourth sound and standard elastic modes in nAG. The hybrid second and the transverse fourth sound start with zero velocity at the transition, similar to pure 3He, and quickly grow with lowering temperature until they hit the sample finite size cutoff.

Ohm's law provides a fundamental framework for understanding charge transport in conductors and underpins the concept of electrical scaling that has enabled the continuous advancement of modern CMOS technologies. As transistors are scaled to even smaller dimensions, device channels inevitably enter low-dimensional regimes to achieve higher performance. Low-dimensional materials such as atomically thin oxide semiconductors, 2D van der Waals semiconductors, and 1D carbon nanotubes, have thus emerged as key candidates for extending Moore's law. Here, we reveal the fundamental distinction between three-dimensional and low-dimensional conductors arising from disorder-induced electron localization, which leads to the breakdown of Ohm's law and lateral linear scaling. We develop a quantitative model that captures the role of the disordered region, a unique characteristic intrinsically to low-dimensional transistors. Furthermore, the disorder-induced localization framework consistently explains experimental observations in atomically thin In2O3 field-effect transistors across variations in channel length, temperature, thickness, and post-annealing conditions. This work establishes a unified physical picture for understanding and optimizing disorder-driven electronic transport in low-dimensional transistors.

We report a polarized ultrafast pump-probe study of the normal-state electronic dynamics in bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ single crystals at ambient pressure. While both nickelates exhibit density-wave (DW) transitions accompanied by the opening of a quasiparticle relaxation bottleneck, their electronic responses display strikingly different symmetry properties. La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ maintains an isotropic optical response across the entire temperature range. In contrast, La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ exhibits a pronounced twofold ($C_2$) anisotropy in its low-temperature electronic dynamics. This electronic nematicity, evident in both the relaxation dynamics and the effective gap scales, competes with a secondary isotropic order emerging below 115 K. The presence of macroscopic electronic anisotropy in the bilayer system, and its absence in the trilayer system, suggests an intimate relation between electronic nematic fluctuations and superconducting pairing in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ that worth for deeper explorations.

The energetics and stability of dislocations, vacancies and, interstitials in the one-component plasma (OCP), where the charges interact with a log potential and move on the curved surface of a cylinder have been investigated numerically. For vacancy-interstitial pairs, the log term of the direct Coulomb attraction and the elastic displacement energy cancel exactly at long distances, resulting in a defect energy of O(1). The numerical results confirm the predicted asymptotic behavior but also identify critical distances below which pairs evolve to different forms. We have found that bound pairs of dislocations - created by adding or removing 120 degree zig-zags of particles - have a dependence on their preparation history which is not accounted for in the usual starting point of the KTHNY theory. Furthermore, isolated dislocations, whose presence disrupts crystalline order, have energies of O(1) at some values of N, the number of particles in the system, and therefore will be thermally excited, raising questions about the applicability of standard KTHNY theory to the OCP, and supporting older suggestions that there are no phase transitions at all in the two-dimensional OCP.

The structural and electronic properties of the doubly calcium-doped boron cluster B$_{18}$Ca$_2$ have been systematically investigated using density functional theory calculations. Basin-hopping searches reveal that B$_{18}$Ca$_2$ adopts a double-ring geometry as its global minimum, consisting of two fused B$_9$ rings symmetrically stabilized by calcium atoms located above and below the boron framework. Vibrational frequency calculations verify the dynamical stability of the low-lying structures, while infrared and UV-Vis spectra highlight strong Ca--B coupling and pronounced electronic delocalization within the boron scaffold. Atomic dipole-corrected Hirshfeld charge analysis indicates substantial charge transfer from Ca to the electron-deficient boron framework, with the donated electrons uniformly delocalized over the B$_{18}$ skeleton. Real-space bonding analyses based on the electron localization function (ELF), Interaction Region Indicator (IRI), and the Laplacian of the electron density reveal an extended multicenter bonding network characterized by global $σ$-delocalization and Ca-induced polarization effects rather than localized two-center Ca--B bonds. Together, these results establish B$_{18}$Ca$_2$ as a prototypical boron toroidal cluster and provide fundamental insights into the role of alkaline-earth doping in stabilizing complex boron nanostructures.

Understanding the spatio-temporal evolution of radiolytic species created by high-energy electrons in water underpins key applications from radiotherapy and nuclear safety to environmental processing and electron microscopy. Here, using the Manchester Inhomogeneous Radiation Chemistry by Linear Expansions (MIRaCLE) toolkit, we introduce and benchmark a novel approach to simulating these processes. Although the initial conditions are determined stochastically, the subsequent time evolution is calculated deterministically using a continuum representation, derived from those initial conditions. This hybrid approach essentially averages over many chemistry ``trajectories'' simultaneously, often converging to the 1% level in one shot, not requiring multiple runs. We demonstrate this new approach through the calculation of time-dependent G-values for e_{aq}^-$, \dot{\mathrm{OH}} and other radiolytic products, including at unprecedented dose rates where calculations which would take years with a conventional Monte Carlo approach can be performed in mere hours on a commercial laptop. We demonstrate that the main artifact of continuum modelling can be mitigated by a correction term. These results establish MIRaCLE as a flexible and efficient platform for modelling long-timescale radiolysis, providing a bridge between Monte Carlo approaches and macroscopic reaction--diffusion schemes, with broad implications for radiation chemistry in medicine, energy, and materials science.

We report a combined x-ray absorption (XAS) and oxygen $K$-edge resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) study of charge order in underdoped La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ ($x=0.125$) under uniaxial $c$-axis pressure. We find that compressive $c$-axis strain modifies the charge order only within the superconducting state, with a striking polarization dependence: suppression in the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ channel and enhancement in the $d_{z^2}$ channel. X-ray absorption spectra reveal concomitant strain-induced modifications of the oxygen pre-edge and upper Hubbard band, consistent with increased $d_{z^2}$ orbital admixture. Our results suggest that $c$-axis pressure drives an orbital separation between superconductivity, rooted in $d_{x^2-y^2}$ states, and charge order, which gradually shifts to the $d_{z^2}$ channel. This orbital separation reveals a way for superconductivity and charge order to coexist in the cuprates with minimal competition. Furthermore, it suggests that the multi-order phase diagram of La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_4$ cannot be realistically described within single band models usually used to describe cuprate physics.

Altermagnets, an emerging class of magnetic materials, exhibit exotic chiral split magnons that are of great interest for both fundamental physics and spintronic applications. However, detecting and manipulating these magnons is challenging due to their THz frequency response. Here, we report the discovery of gapless chiral split magnons confined within altermagnetic domain walls. Unlike in conventional ferromagnets or antiferromagnets, their spectrum is highly sensitive to the domain wall orientation relative to the crystal axis. These magnons inherit the chiral splitting of their bulk counterparts and are detectable in the microwave regime, offering a distinctive signature for identifying altermagnets. We further show that the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction drives hybridization of magnons with opposite chiralities, enabling unidirectional strong magnon-magnon coupling. Moreover, we demonstrate that spin-orbit torque can control the domain wall orientation, providing a practical means to manipulate these chiral magnons. Our findings open pathways for novel magnonic nanocircuitry based on altermagnetic domain walls.

The centrosymmetric cubic compound EuTi$_2$Al$_{20}$, in which magnetic Eu ions form a diamond network, undergoes an antiferromagnetic transition at T$_N$ = 3.3 K and exhibits metamagnetic transitions at H$_{m1}$ = 1.7 T and H$_{m2}$ = 2.8 T for H || [100] at 1.9 K. Between these fields, the magnetization shows a step-like behavior, defining an intermediate field-induced phase (Phase~II). We investigated the electronic transport in Phase~II and found that both the resistivity and Hall resistivity are markedly enhanced, while remaining nearly field independent within the phase. Phase~II appears for all field directions, although its transport response shows moderate directional dependence. These features differ from the strongly orientation-selective behavior often observed in skyrmion-lattice phases of several 4f-electron compounds, suggesting that Phase II may host a field-induced spin texture with a topological character distinct from that of a conventional skyrmion lattice.

The square-lattice $J_1$-$J_2$ transverse-field (TF) Ising model was investigated with the exact diagonalization (ED) method. In order to analyze the TF-driven phase transition, we applied the longitudinal-field fidelity susceptibility $χ^{(h)}_F$, which is readily evaluated via the ED scheme. Here, the longitudinal field couples with the absolute value of the magnetic moment $|M|$ rather than the raw $M$ so that the remedied fidelity susceptibility exhibits a peak around the critical point; note that the spontaneous magnetization does not appear for the finite-size systems. As a preliminary survey, the modified fidelity susceptibility $χ^{(h)}_F$ is applied to the analysis of criticality for $J_2=0$, where a number of preceding results are available. Thereby, properly scaling the distance from the multi-criticality, $η=0.5-J_2$, the $χ^{(h)}_F$ data were cast into the crossover-scaling formula, and the multi-critical exponent for $χ_F^{(h)}$ is estimated. The result is cross-checked by the numerically evaluated $β$-function behavior.

Surface thermodynamics of minerals influence their properties and occurrence in both terrestrial and planetary systems. Using high-temperature oxide melt solution calorimetry, we report the first direct measurement of the surface energy of enstatite, MgSiO$_3$. Enstatite nanoparticles of different sizes were synthesized using the sol-gel method, characterized with X-ray diffraction, thermal analysis, infrared spectroscopy, surface area measurements, and electron microscopy. The materials consist of crystallites with sizes of $\sim $10 - 20 nm, which are agglomerated into larger nanoparticles. Thus, both surface and interface terms contribute to the measured enthalpies. Analysis based on calorimetry and calculated surface and interface areas gives the surface enthalpy of enstatite as 4.79 $\pm$ 0.45 J m$^{-2}$. This value is comparable to that of forsterite (Mg$_2$SiO$_4$) and larger than those of many nonsilicate oxide materials. This large surface energy may present a barrier to the nucleation of enstatite in planetary atmospheres and other geochemical and planetary environments. The interfacial energy of enstatite appears to be close to zero. The transition enthalpy from bulk orthoenstatite to bulk clinoenstatite is 0.34 $\pm$ 0.93 kJ mol$^{-1}$, which is in agreement with earlier reports. The methodology developed here can be extended to other materials having complex structures and morphologies to separate surface and interfacial contributions to energetics.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究通过多层级量子化学计算构建了氦-苯复合物的高精度势能面，并应用于路径积分蒙特卡洛模拟，揭示了与经验势能模型不同的氦原子在苯上的溶剂化行为。

The accurate modeling of non-covalent interactions between helium and graphitic materials is important for understanding quantum phenomena in reduced dimensions, with the helium-benzene complex serving as the fundamental prototype. However, creating a quantitatively reliable potential energy surface (PES) for this weakly bound system remains a significant computational challenge. In this work, we present a comprehensive, multi-level investigation of the He-Bz interaction, establishing benchmark energies using high-level coupled-cluster singles-and-doubles with perturbative triples (CCSD(T)) methods extrapolated to the complete basis set limit and assessing higher-order (CCSDT(Q)) contributions. We use symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) to benchmark it against CCSD(T) and to decompose the interaction into its physical components-confirming it is dominated by a balance between dispersion and exchange-repulsion. A continuous, three-dimensional PES is constructed from discrete ab initio points using multifidelity Gaussian process regression that combines density functional theory results with sparse coupled-cluster energies. The result is a highly accurate PES with sub-cm-1 accuracy that obeys physical laws. This new PES is applied to path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations to study the solvation of 4He atoms on benzene at low temperatures. Our PIMC results reveal qualitatively different solvation behavior, particularly in the filling of adsorption layers, when compared to simulations using commonly employed empirical Lennard-Jones potentials. This work provides a benchmark PES essential for accurate many-body simulations of helium on larger polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons towards graphene.

- **TL;DR**: 通过dHvA振荡测量和能带计算，揭示了YNi2B2C中电子-声子耦合的费米面依赖性，特别是发现band-28轨道耦合极弱，为理解高温超导机制提供关键数据。

We performed de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) oscillation measurements and band-structure calculations for YNi$_2$B$_2$C. Our improved band structure successfully explained the origins of the large dHvA frequencies $β$ and $ζ$, which were inexplicable in previous works. By comparing experimental effective masses with band masses, we determined the electron-phonon coupling for each orbit. The results showed a clear Fermi-surface-sheet dependence of the electron-phonon coupling strength, especially highlighting that the coupling for the band-28 sheet is very weak, almost absent for the orbit with $B \parallel c$. This finding is consistent with previous observations of dHvA oscillations from this orbit in the mixed state down to very low fields. Amidst growing interest in high-temperature superconductivity driven by electron-phonon coupling in hydrides under high pressure, this study provides foundational data pivotal to precisely understanding electron-phonon coupling.

A key aim in spintronics is to achieve current-induced magnetization switching via spin-orbit torques without external magnetic fields. For this, the focus of recent work has been on introducing controlled lateral gradients across ferromagnet/heavy-metal devices, giving variations in thickness, composition, or interface quality. However, the small gradients achievable with common growth techniques limit both the impact of this approach and understanding of the underlying physical mechanisms. Here, spin-orbit torques are patterned on a mesoscopic length scale in tungsten thin films using direct-write laser annealing. Through transmission electron microscopy, resistivity, and second harmonic measurements, the continuous transformation of the crystalline phase of W films from the highly spin-orbit coupled, high resistivity $β$ phase to the minimally spin-orbit coupled, low resistivity $α$ phase is tracked with increasing laser fluence. Gradients with different steepness are patterned in the tungsten phase to create spin-orbit torque channels and, when interfaced with CoFeB, tungsten wires with a sufficiently strong gradient can switch the magnetization without an applied magnetic field. Therefore, exploiting the unique microstructure of mixed-phase W allows precise control of the local electronic current density and direction, as well as local spin-orbit torque efficiency, providing a new avenue for the design of efficient spintronic devices.

- **TL;DR**: 通过点接触谱测量发现UTe₂超导序参数包含p_z分量，压力调控下存在多个超导相，可由p_z波与p_{x(y)}波配对相对权重区分。

Spin-triplet superconductivity (SC) offers a unique avenue for realizing non-Abelian Majorana zero modes and thus the fault-tolerant topological quantum computation, and has attracted a broad audience for both fundamental research and potential applications. The recently discovered heavy-fermion spin-triplet superconductor candidate UTe$_2$ has sparked great interest for its ultrahigh upper critical field and reentrant SC phases in the proximity to a field-polarized magnetic state. Despite extensive studies on the phase diagrams and competing orders induced by pressure and magnetic field, limited has been known about its SC order parameters and their evolution with these control parameters, largely due to the lack of appropriate symmetry-sensitive detections. Here, we report comprehensive point-contact spectroscopy measurements of pressurized UTe$_2$ on the (0~0~1) surface. The observation of Andreev bound state strongly suggests the presence of a $p_z$ component in the SC order parameters. Quantitative analysis based on an extended Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk model unveils $B_{2u}$ or $B_{3u}$ as the most likely representation for both ambient and pressurized UTe$_2$, and remarkably, the multiple SC phases can be distinguished by a single parameter $\langle Δ_{z}\rangle/\langleΔ_{x(y)}\rangle$, the relative weight between the $p_z$-wave and $p_{x(y)}$-wave pairings. These findings not only impose stringent constraints on the superconducting order parameter in UTe$_2$, but also provide key spectroscopic evidence for the existence of multiple SC phases tuned through pressure.

We consider the barycentric version of the Bak-Sneppen model, a one-dimensional self-organized critical model that describes generalized Keynesian beauty contests with a local interaction rule. We numerically investigate the power spectral density of the fitness variable and correlation time. Through data collapse for both variables, we estimate the critical exponents. For global and local fitness variables, the power spectral density exhibits $1/f^α$ with $0&lt; α&lt; 2$, indicative of long-range correlations. We also investigate the cover time, defined as the duration required for the extinction or mutation of species across the entire system in the critical state of the barycentric BS model. Using finite-size scaling and extreme value theory, we analyze the statistical properties of the cover time. Our results show power-law scaling with system size for the mean, variance, mode, and peak probability. Furthermore, the cumulative probability distribution exhibits data collapse, and the associated scaling function is well described by the generalized extreme value density, closely approximating the Gumbel family.

Ruthenium-based B2 intermetallics are promising for refractory superalloys but are limited by the trade-off between high thermodynamic stability and elastic precipitation strain. We present a physics-guided machine learning framework integrating high-throughput Density Functional Theory (DFT), Random Forest screening, and Symbolic Regression to navigate this design space. This approach resolves the paradox where stoichiometric compounds like RuHf fail to achieve theoretical solvus temperatures. By deriving a closed-form physical law, we quantify the strain penalty: a 1% lattice misfit reduces the solvus temperature by approximately 200 degrees C. This finding confirms that maximizing thermodynamic driving force alone is insufficient. We demonstrate that multi-component alloying is structurally necessary, identifying ternary additions such as Al and Ti as essential lattice-tuning agents that zero out the elastic penalty. This framework establishes a rigorous, constraint-based protocol for alloy design, enabling the precise engineering of zero-misfit, high-stability microstructures.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文开发了循环荧光(RF)的统计模型，应用于多环芳烃(PAHs)的星际介质冷却机制研究，发现对称禁阻的低能激发态对冷却效率有重要贡献。

Recurrent fluorescence (RF) is an important relaxation mechanism in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which could stabilize them and contribute to the production of aromatic infrared bands that are observed in the infrared spectra of the interstellar medium (ISM). In this theoretical work, a statistical model of relaxation by recurrent fluorescence is formally developed, including Herzberg-Teller and Duschinsky rotation effects as well as a full account of vibrational progressions. Using canonical and harmonic approximations, the RF rate constants can be determined from the transition dipole moment time autocorrelation functions. Application to the naphthalene, anthracene, and pyrene cations is presented based on quantum chemical inputs obtained from time-dependent density-functional theory. For these highly symmetric molecules, the low-lying, symmetry-forbidden electronic excited states are predicted to contribute possibly even more than higher energy, non-forbidden states. Such an unexpected contribution could increase the cooling efficiency of PAHs and, in turn, stabilize them further under the highly ionized environments of the ISM.

Transition-metal trichalcogenides distinguish themselves from other two-dimensional materials in nanoscience and materials science due to their remarkable range of intrinsic properties, including various electronic, optical, and magnetic behaviors. Here, we report a comprehensive study of superconductivity in disordered ZrTe$_{3-x}$ ($x$ = 0.2) with suppressed charge density wave. We observe a type-II bulk anisotropic superconductivity with a superconducting transition at $T_c$ = 3.59(4) \si{K}. Angle-dependent upper critical field measurements and Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition confirm the inherent quasi-two-dimensional nature of superconductivity in this disordered system.

- **TL;DR**: 研究发现WSe₂单层的光致发光寿命与强度呈线性相关，这种相关性源于光诱导带边载流子陷阱，它们引入了与激子发射竞争的非辐射衰变路径。

Monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) exhibit bright photoluminescence, a desirable property for light-emitting diodes and single-photon emitters. Because the emission intensity is heavily influenced by factors such as defect density and oxidation, it is critical to understand how they affect photoluminescence efficiency. However, due to the time-consuming process of identifying individual monolayers, studies of high-quality exfoliated TMDs have been limited to only a few samples. Here, we present an investigation of excited-state lifetimes and spectra for over 200 WSe$_2$ exfoliated monolayers at room temperature. We find a linear correlation between photoluminescence lifetime and intensity across hundreds of monolayers and within individual monolayers. Results from intentional photooxidation experiments indicate that this correlation is due to photoinduced band-edge carrier traps, which introduce a nonradiative decay pathway that competes with exciton emission. Our work highlights the importance of controlling such traps, as they are the primary limitation of bright photoluminescence.

Recent years have witnessed the emergence of spin supersolids in frustrated quantum magnets, establishing a material-based platform for supersolidity beyond its original context in solid helium. A spin supersolid is characterized by the coexistence of longitudinal spin order that breaks lattice translational symmetry and transverse spin order associated with the spontaneous breaking of a spin U(1) symmetry. Extensive experimental investigations, together with advanced numerical studies, have now revealed a coherent and internally consistent picture of these phases, substantially deepening our understanding of supersolidity in quantum magnetic materials. Beyond their fundamental interest as exotic quantum states, potential applications in highly efficient demagnetization cooling have been supported by a giant magnetocaloric effect observed in candidate materials. Moreover, the possible dissipationless spin supercurrents could open promising perspectives for spin transport and spintronic applications. In this Review, we summarize recent progress on emergent spin supersolids in frustrated triangular-lattice quantum antiferromagnets. We survey experimental evidence from thermodynamic and spectroscopic measurements and compare these results with theoretical studies of minimal models addressing global phase diagrams, ground state properties, and collective excitations. In addition, we discuss characteristic spin-transport phenomena and outline future directions for exploring spin supersolids as functional quantum materials.

Fluctuating hydrodynamics provides a quantitative, large-scale description of many-body systems in terms of smooth variables, with microscopic details entering only through a small set of transport coefficients. Although this framework has been highly successful in characterizing macroscopic fluctuations and correlations, a systematic derivation of fluctuating hydrodynamics from underlying stochastic microscopic dynamics remains obscure for broad classes of interacting systems. For stochastic lattice gas models with gradient dynamics and a single conserved density, we develop a path-integral based coarse-graining procedure that recovers fluctuating hydrodynamics in a controlled manner. Our analysis highlights the essential role of local-equilibrium averages, which go beyond naïve mean-field-type gradient expansions. We further extend this approach to interacting Brownian particles by coarse-graining the Dean-Kawasaki equation, revealing a mobility proportional to the density and a diffusivity determined by the thermodynamic pressure.

The growth of a methane hydrate seed within a silica slit pore of fixed width has been studied using AllAtom Molecular Dynamics (AA-MD). An AA force field has been used to describe the molecules of the solid silica substrate, with a-quartz crystalline structure. The crystallisation of hydrates in confined geometries is not well understood yet, and the objective of this work is to study the hydrate growth inside a silica pore using molecular simulation. Both NVT and NpT ensembles were used in the AA-MD simulations to analyse the hydrate growth from an initial seed. Results showed that the boundary conditions imposed by the nanometric slit pore yielded a hydrate with structural defects, filling the accessible space between the silica walls. The water molecules which were not incorporated to the initial seed hydrate formed a high density water layer trapped between the silica walls and the crystallised hydrate. These results provide an interesting insight into the hydrate crystallisation process in confined geometries, resembling those found in natural hydrate deposits.

- **TL;DR**: 研究后CCSD(T)方法对第一、二周期分子总原子化能(TAE)的热化学影响，特别关注其与亚价层相关作用的耦合，提出W5理论协议并与W4-08基准比较

We consider the thermochemical impact of post-CCSD(T) contributions to the total atomization energy (TAE, the sum of all bond energies) of first- and second-row molecules, and specifically their coupling with the subvalence correlation contribution. In particular, we find large contributions from (Q) when there are several neighboring second-row atoms. Otherwise, both higher-order triples $T_3$--(T) and connected quadruples (Q) are important in systems with strong static correlation. Reoptimization of the reference geometry for core-valence correlation increases the calculated TAE across the board, most pronouncedly so for second-row compounds with neighboring second-row atoms. %just slightly increases the calculated TAE for all species, but more pronouncedly so if strong static correlation is present, as well as for second-row compounds, again especially with neighboring second-row atoms. We present a first proposal for a `W5 theory' protocol and compare computed TAEs for the W4-08 benchmark with prior reference values. For some key second-row species, the new values represent nontrivial revisions. Our predicted TAE$_0$ values (TAE at 0 K) agree well with the ATcT (active thermochemical tables) values, including for the very recent expansion of the ATcT network to boron, silicon, and sulfur compounds.

We develop a fractional-order Ginzburg-Landau (GL) framework for nonreciprocal superconducting transport in Josephson junctions formed by fractal superconductors or superconducting media with nonlocal correlations, separated by a noncentrosymmetric normal layer. We show that nonreciprocity and the superconducting diode effect arise from the interplay between the Lifshitz invariant and fractional kinetics, with the latter serving as an effective, symmetry-consistent representation of fractal geometry and finite-range memory. Two complementary approaches are pursued. In a fractional integral GL formulation, spatial integration on a fractal space yields analytic solutions and reveals how rectification scales with the dimensionality of the fractal media and the strength of the Lifshitz-like drift. In a fractional derivative-based formulation derived via the Agrawal variational principle with left/right Caputo operators, we obtain a gauge-invariant free energy, the corresponding GL equations, and a current density. We use fractional orders as effective parameters that represent nonlocal and memory effects induced by fractal microstructure. Within a two-mode plane-wave approximation we derive a compact current-phase relation and an expression for the diode efficiency, and we map the rectification amplitude across the fractional kinetic and the Lifshitz/memory order. An exact single-sided solution in terms of Prabhakar functions further confirms robust, tunable nonreciprocity, including a near-ideal diode response. This identifies a pathway to near-perfect superconducting diodes by engineering fractal (fractional-kinetic) transport achieved by tuning the fractional orders and Lifshitz strength without invoking magnetic fields or geometric ratchets. In the integer limit of local kinetics and Lifshitz-like drift, both constructions reduce to the standard $\varphi_0$ Josephson junction.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一个通用的自洽理论模型，用于预测任意浓度梯度、扩散系数和离子价态下的零电流静息电压，统一了所有先前模型。

The resting voltage, $V$, which is the potential drop required to nullify the electrical current ($i=0$), is a key characteristic of water desalination and energy harvesting systems that utilize macroscopically large nanoporous membranes, as well as for physiological ion channels subjected to asymmetric salt concentrations. To date, existing analytical expressions for $V_{i=0}$ have been limited to simple scenarios. In this work, we derive a universal, self-consistent theoretical model, devoid of unnecessary oversimplifying assumptions, that unifies all previous models within a single framework. This new model, verified by non-approximated numerical simulations, predicts the behavior of $V_{i=0}$ for arbitrary concentration gradients and for arbitrary diffusion coefficients and ionic valences. We show how the interplay between diffusion coefficients and ionic valencies significantly varies the system response and why it is essential to account for all system parameters. Ultimately, this model can be used to improve experimental interpretation of ion transport measurements.

Here we have experimentally demonstrated spin-correlation-driven ferroelectric quantum criticality in a prototype quantum spin-liquid system, Ba3CuSb2O9, a quantum phenomenon rarely observed. The dielectric constant follows a clear T2 scaling, showing that the material behaves as a quantum paraelectric without developing ferroelectric order. Magnetically, the system avoids long-range order down to 1.8 K and instead displays a T3/2 dependence in its inverse susceptibility, a hallmark of antiferromagnetic quantum critical fluctuations. Together with known spin-orbital-lattice entanglement in this compound, these signatures point to a strong interplay between spin dynamics and the polar lattice. Our results place this perovskite spin-liquid family at the forefront of this domain and suggest the flexibility of this family in a suitable environment by tuning chemical/ external pressure.

X-ray absorption spectroscopy and X-ray magnetic circular dichroism have long served as indispensable tools for probing the electronic and magnetic properties of transition-metal compounds with elemental selectivity. In recent years, the emergence of femtosecond lasers has opened a new avenue for studying nonequilibrium dynamics in condensed matter. However, conventional optical techniques lack elemental and orbital specificity, making it difficult to disentangle the coupled charge, spin, and lattice responses in complex materials. The development of X-ray free-electron lasers (XFEL) and laboratory high-harmonic generation (HHG) sources has enabled the extension of X-ray absorption and scattering techniques into the femtosecond time domain. Time-resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy, X-ray magnetic circular dichroism, and resonant soft X-ray scattering now provide direct, complementary access to element- and momentum-resolved ultrafast dynamics. This review summarizes recent progress in these techniques, focusing on pump-probe measurements of laser-induced demagnetization, spin-state transitions, and valence and structural changes in transition-metal compounds. We also discuss advances in tabletop HHG-based X-ray spectroscopy and its integration with large-scale XFEL facilities. These developments provide powerful routes for visualizing the nonequilibrium evolution of charge, spin, orbital, and lattice degrees of freedom, offering new insights into the ultrafast control of quantum materials.

- **TL;DR**: 将origin-invariant长度规范方法扩展到振动圆二色性计算，避免了传统长度规范对坐标原点选择的依赖，无需使用规范包含原子轨道

We have extended the origin-invariant length gauge (LG(OI)) approach -- originally developed by Caricato and co-workers for optical rotation (OR) and electronic circular dichroism (ECD) -- to vibrational circular dichroism (VCD). This approach avoids the need for gauge-including atomic orbitals (GIAOs), which are typically required to circumvent the unphysical dependence of the CD rotatory strengths on the arbitrary choice of coordinate origin for length gauge (LG) computations. Benchmark VCD spectra are presented for (P)-hydrogen peroxide, (S)-methyloxirane, (1R, 5R)-α-pinene, and (1R, 4R)-camphor using Hartree-Fock (HF) theory and density functional theory (DFT) methods across a range of basis sets and compared to those obtained from LG, velocity-gauge (VG), and GIAO computations. These analyses show that for VCD the LG(OI) approach does not converge to the basis-set limit as rapidly as the GIAO approach, but does yield similar quality spectra as GIAO for all major VCD peaks for quadruple-zeta-quality basis sets. The LG(OI) and VG VCD spectra are less reliable compared to GIAOs for smaller basis sets.

- **TL;DR**: 通过低温谱学成像揭示UTe2费米面，发现铀带散射在CDW和PDW相形成中起主要作用，磁场抑制CDW后出现小圆形费米口袋

The identification, control and theoretical modelling of spin-triplet superconductors (STC) remain a central theme in quantum materials research. Intrinsic STC are rare but offer rich condensate properties and unique surface properties allowing insights into the nature of the spin-triplet order, and promising applications in quantum technologies. Owing to interactions, the order parameter in STCs can often be intertwined with other symmetry breaking orders like charge/spin density waves (CDW/SDW) or pair density waves (PDW) complicating their phase diagrams. UTe2 stands out as the only known odd-parity, STC that harbors such intertwined orders on the surface and possible topological surface states composed of Majorana fermions. While the (0-11) facet is the most heavily studied, the fermiology of this surface that gives rise to such exotic phenomena is still lacking and continues to be an area of active interest. Here, we employ low-temperature spectroscopic imaging to reveal the Fermi surface of UTe2 through quasiparticle interference. We find scattering originating from the uranium-derived bands that play a major role in the formation of the CDW and the PDW phases. Tunneling spectroscopy further reveals spectral signatures of the CDW gap, corroborating its onset temperature. Suppressing the CDW with a magnetic field, highlights the presence of small, circular Fermi pockets that disperse strongly near the Fermi energy. We discuss the nature of the interference patterns and the origin of the small Fermi pockets in the context of the calculated band structure and the unconventional CDW phase.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文提出通过晶体对称性工程调控二维反铁磁系统中的反常输运，实现了无需反转磁化即可控制反常霍尔效应和反常能斯特效应的符号反转。

Anomalous transports, including the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) and anomalous Nernst effect (ANE), are typical manifestations of time-reversal-symmetry-breaking responses in materials. In general, the two Hall states with opposite Hall conductivities can be regarded as time-reversal pairs coupled to magnetic order, and switching between them relies on reversing the magnetization via an external magnetic field or electric current. Here, we introduce a approach for manipulating anomalous transport through crystal symmetry engineering in two-dimensional (2D) altermagnetic systems. Based on symmetry analysis, we demonstrate that 2D altermagnets (AM) with out-of-plane Néel vectors will not host any anomalous Hall transport. Remarkably, breaking the symmetry connecting the two magnetic sublattices, an anomalous Hall response can emerge immediately, and the signs of the anomalous Hall and anomalous Nernst conductivities can be flexibly controlled by the symmetry-breaking term, thereby realizing tunable sign-reversible anomalous transport. Furthermore, the feasibility of the theoretical scheme is further verified by explicit lattice-model construction. Using first-principles calculations, we investigate the realization of crystal symmetry-controlled anomalous transport in a 2D AM material Cr$_{2}$O$_{2}$. The results indicate that Cr$_{2}$O$_{2}$ with out-of-plane Néel vectors can sequentially exhibit the AHE and quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) under continuous uniaxial strain. Interestingly, the sign reversal between these two effects can be achieved by simply rotating the strain direction by C$_{4z}$ symmetry. The corresponding ANE and its sign reversal are also revealed. Our findings provide a new strategy to manipulate anomalous transport, and should have significant potential applications.

We investigated the magnetoelastic properties of a GdRu$_2$Si$_2$ single crystal under a magnetic field applied along the crystallographic [001] and [110] directions. We report a series of strong anomalies in the sound velocity that is consistent with the complex phase diagram reported previously for this compound. In particular, in our study we focus on the recently identified magnetic phase in the high-temperature region. We show that while this phase is easily destroyed for magnetic fields applied along [001], it is rather stable for fields along [110]. Furthermore, we introduce a Landau theory and a microscopic toy model describing the elastic response at zero field. We reproduce qualitatively the observed anomalies for different acoustic modes, which allows us to propose a magnetic structure for this new high-temperature phase.

Accurate description of crystal structures is a prerequisite for predicting the physicochemical properties of materials. However, conventional X-ray diffraction (XRD) characterization often encounters intrinsic bottlenecks when applied to complex multiphase systems, necessitating the integration of complementary optical measurement. In this study, we developed a multi-descriptor framework by integrating key parameters including space groups, Pearson symbols, and Wyckoff sequences, to categorize the dataset of over 19,000 crystals into several dozen structural prototypes. Then, an accuracy-adaptive ensemble network based on residual architectures was implemented to capture structural ``fingerprints" within phonon vibration modes and Raman spectra. The ensemble algorithm demonstrates exceptional robustness when processing various crystals of varying lengths and quality. This data-driven classification strategy not only overcomes the reliance of traditional characterization on ideal data but also provides a high-throughput tool for the automated analysis of material structures in large-scale experimental workflows.

- **TL;DR**: 通过125Te NMR测量研究UTe2中磁涨落与两个超导相的关系，发现压力增强反铁磁涨落，铁磁涨落有利于SC1相，反铁磁涨落对SC2相至关重要。

Characterizing magnetic fluctuations is one of the keys to understanding the origin of superconductivity in the spin-triplet superconductor UTe$_2$ which exhibits two superconducting (SC) phases (SC1 and SC2) under pressure: SC1 where a superconducting transition temperature of $T_{\rm c}$ decreases with pressure while $T_{\rm c}$ of SC2 rises with pressure. Previously, D. Ambika et al. [Phys. Rev. B 105, L220403 (2022)] have reported the possible coexistence of ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin fluctuations in UTe$_2$ under pressure from their nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements. To delve the relationship between the magnetic fluctuations and the two SC phases, we have carried out detailed $^{125}$Te NMR measurements on a single crystal of UTe$_2$ with $T_{\rm c}$ = 1.6 K at various pressures ranging from 0 to 2.05 GPa. By comparing the temperature $T$ dependence of nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rates divided by temperature 1/$T_1T$ with that of the Knight shift $K$ for magnetic fields along the $a$, $b$, and $c$ directions, we evidence the enhancement of AFM spin fluctuations with increasing pressure. Based on the results, we suggest that FM spin fluctuations are more favorable for SC1 and AFM spin fluctuations are crucial for SC2. Our findings will inspire further study on this material to understand the peculiar SC phases in detail.

Single molecule junctions exhibit dynamic structural configurations that strongly influence their electronic and thermoelectric properties. Here, we combine conductance (G) and Seebeck coefficient (S) measurements using the novel AC based scanning tunnelling microscope break junction technique to probe the real-time evolution of oligo(phenylene ethynylene) molecular junctions. We show that most junctions undergo configuration changes that lead to notable changes in S while G remains nearly constant. Density functional theory and quantum transport simulations link these observations to variations in contact geometry and charge transfer at the molecule electrode interface. Our results demonstrate that simultaneous G and S measurements enable direct access to the dynamic reconfiguration of single molecule junctions and offer design insights for thermoelectric molecular devices and new routes for increasing single molecule junction stability.

We study a honeycomb Kondo lattice model in which Dirac conduction electrons are coupled to a spin-1/2 Kitaev quantum spin liquid. For weak Kondo coupling, the spins fractionalize into Majorana fermions comprising a gapless Dirac mode and three gapped visons. Integrating out the visions to second order in the Kondo coupling yields effective electron-electron interactions, including a local Hubbard repulsion, a spin-spin interaction whose sign depends on the Kitaev exchange, and a vertex coupling electrons to Majorana fermions. We analyze the resulting low-energy field theory using a perturbative renormalization group (RG) scheme, accounting for additional density-density interactions generated under RG. At criticality, electrons decouple from Majorana fermions but all three electron interactions acquire positive values. An analysis of susceptibility exponents reveals that the fractionalized Fermi liquid becomes unstable towards antiferromagnetic order and that superconductivity is disfavored.

### Spontaneous growth of perfectly circular domains of MoS2 monolayers using chemical vapour deposition technique

- **TL;DR**: 通过CVD方法在SiO2/Si衬底上自然生长出直径达数百微米的圆形单层MoS2岛，无需种子层，内部缺陷少、光电性能优于边缘区域。

Very large-scale integration of devices in a circular pattern has several advantages over the commonly used rectangular grid layout. For the development of such integrated circuits on a 2D semiconductor platform, spontaneous growth of the material in the form of circular islands is desirable. Here, we report the natural formation of 1L-MoS2 circular islands of diameter as large as a few hundreds of micrometer on SiO2/Si substrates by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technique without the use of any seeding layer. The size of the circles is found to increase with the amount of sulphur used during growth. The study reveals that these circular islands are formed with a less-defective interior and a more-defective outer part that is dominated by a large density of grain boundaries and twists. Due to the lower defect density, the interior region yields much higher photoluminescence than the peripheral part. Field effect transistors (FETs) are fabricated on inner and outer portions of a circle to estimate the mobility and concentration of the background carriers in the two regions. The study shows that the maximum mobility is more than double in the interior than the outer part. While the carrier concentration remains practically unchanged in the two regions. The natural tendency to minimize the strain energy resulting from the mismatch between the thermal expansion coefficients of the monolayer and the substrate as well as the edge energy that originates from the boundary tension are thought to be the driving forces behind the formation of these circular domains.

We present a device-level design for a two-qubit module based on phonon-coupled germanium (Ge) hole-spin qubits operating at $1$-$4~\mathrm{K}$. Building on prior work on phonon-engineered Ge qubits and phononic-crystal (PnC) cavities, we specify a lithography-ready layout that integrates two gate-defined hole-spin qubits in a strained Ge quantum well with a GHz PnC defect mode that mediates a coherent phonon-based interaction. We detail the SiGe/Ge heterostructure, PnC cavity design, and a compatible nanofabrication process flow, including the gate stack, membrane patterning and release, and RF/DC wiring. We further develop a readout architecture combining spin-to-charge conversion with RF reflectometry on a proximal charge sensor, supported by a cryogenic RF chain optimized for operation at $1$-$4~\mathrm{K}$. Finally, we outline the cryogenic measurement environment, tuning procedures, and a stepwise benchmarking program targeting single-qubit control, phonon-bandgap suppression of relaxation channels, and resolvable phonon-mediated two-qubit coupling. The resulting module provides a scalable template for medium-range coupling of Ge hole-spin qubits and connects materials and phonon engineering with circuit-level readout, enabling future experimental demonstrations of entangling gates, Bell-state generation, and phonon-enabled quantum sensing.

Utilizing a combination of dynamical mean field theory and density functional theory (DMFT/DFT), it has been theoretically proposed that PuB$_6$ is a strongly correlated topological insulator characterized by nontrivial $\mathbf{Z}_{2}$ topological invariants and metallic surface states (\textit{X. Deng et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 111, 176404 (2013)}). Here, we demonstrate through low-temperature magneto-transport measurements and first-principles calculations that PuB$6$ exhibits characteristics of a topological Kondo insulating state. These features include a transition in electrical resistivity from high-temperature, thermally activated behavior with a narrow gap at the Fermi level ($Δρ \sim$ 20 meV) to a distinctive low-temperature plateau, as well as a surface-to-volume dependence of electrical resistivity at low temperatures. The topological nature of PuB$_6$ is further supported by the theoretical calculations, which show that GGA+$U$ is capable of capturing electronic, topological, and lattice properties of PuB$_6$ with much lower computational cost than DMFT.

NiO/ZnO-based thin films, including single-layer and heterostructure configurations, were synthesized to investigate the influence of stacking order on their electrochemical performance for supercapacitor applications. To improve the relatively low capacitive performance of ZnO compared to NiO, NaCl was introduced as a dopant. All films were deposited using a non-vacuum spin-coating method on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates, chosen for their excellent electrical conductivity and stability as electrode materials. The surface morphology and structural parameters were examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), respectively. Optical properties were analyzed via UV-Vis spectroscopy, revealing direct band gaps in the range of 3.17-3.31 eV for ZnO and Na-ZnO, and wider gaps up to 3.81 eV for NiO. Electrochemical performance was evaluated using cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in a three-electrode configuration with 1 M KOH as the electrolyte. Among the electrodes, the single-layer NiO film exhibited the highest specific capacitance of 1.391 Fg^{-1}. In contrast, the NiO/ZnO heterostructure demonstrated a synergistic effect, resulting in enhanced charge storage and achieving a maximum specific capacitance of 1.627 Fg^{-1} at a current density of 2.0 mA cm^{-2}. Furthermore, sodium doping significantly improved the capacitance of ZnO. Overall, the results highlight the potential of sol-gel-derived oxide heterostructures and doped thin films as cost-effective and scalable electrode materials for supercapacitors in portable electronics and energy storage systems.

This work presents a computational study of charge hopping dynamics along a one dimensional chain with Gaussian site energy disorder and linearly coupled quantum bath. Time dependent square displacements are calculated directly from numerical solutions of Pauli master equations, for five different rate kernels: exact Fermi golden rule (FGR) rate expression, stationary phase interpolation (SPI) approximation, semiclassical (SC) approximation, classical Marcus rate expression, and Miller-Abrahams expression. All results demonstrate diffusive behavior in the steady state limit. The results based on the FGR rate expression show that the charge transport in quantum bath can be much more sensitive to the disorder than the prediction from the classical Marcus expression. While the SPI approximation captures this general trend reasonably well, the SC approximation tends to be unreliable at both quantitative and qualitative levels, and becomes even worse than the classical Marcus expression under certain conditions. These results offer useful guidance in the choice of approximate rate kernels for larger scale simulations, and also demonstrate significant but fragile positive effects of quantum environments on the charge hopping dynamics.

We propose a neural network-based model capable of learning the broad landscape of working regimes in quantum dot simulators, and using this knowledge to autotune these devices - based on transport measurements - toward obtaining Majorana modes in the structure. The model is trained in an unsupervised manner on synthetic data in the form of conductance maps, using a physics-informed loss that incorporates key properties of Majorana zero modes. We show that, with appropriate training, a deep vision-transformer network can efficiently memorize relation between Hamiltonian parameters and structures on conductance maps and use it to propose parameters update for a quantum dot chain that drive the system toward topological phase. Starting from a broad range of initial detunings in parameter space, a single update step is sufficient to generate nontrivial zero modes. Moreover, by enabling an iterative tuning procedure - where the system acquires updated conductance maps at each step - we demonstrate that the method can address a much larger region of the parameter space.

We identify hexagonal YMnO$_3$ as a material realization of the elusive $β$-phase of unconventional magnetism, a noncollinear, noncoplanar antiferromagnetic state defined by intrinsic spin-momentum locking and a topological spin texture. First-principle calculations reveal that this unique electronic structure enables a perpendicular electric field to generate a transverse pure spin current, a response that occurs without requiring relativistic spin-orbit coupling. Symmetry analysis demonstrates that this spin current is intimately related to the material's ferroelectric polarization that breaks the inversion symmetry and is rigorously forbidden at domain walls where electrical polarization vanishes. This provides a blueprint for a non-volatile transistor where a gate voltage switches the spin current conductivity by controlling domain wall density, enabling all-electrical control for energy-efficient antiferromagnetic spintronics.

The exploration of topological and transport properties of collinear antiferromagnets and the role of Kitaev interactions in realising topological states therein have rarely been systematically addressed in literature. In this context, we consider a zigzag-ordered antiferromagnet with both extended Kitaev and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions (DMI) in presence of an external magnetic field to focus on the topological phases demonstrated by the magnon band structure and validated by the transport properties. The hybridization between the up- and down-spin sectors carries evidences of opening bulk gaps in the magnon band structure, giving rise to nontrivial topological phases characterized by finite Chern numbers, chiral edge modes, and a nonzero thermal Hall conductivity. Furthermore, generally speaking, a finite magnon orbital moment can exist and contribute to the Nernst response even when the net spin moment vanishes owing to the fundamental independence of the spin and orbital magnetizations. This motivates us to investigate the magnon orbital moment, orbital Berry curvature, and the resulting orbital Nernst conductivity associated with the magnon bands. We find that a giant orbital Nernst conductivity emerges even in the absence of an external magnetic field. Moreover, the distinction between different topological phases is more lucidly manifested via the orbital Nernst conductivity, thereby highlighting an enhanced sensitivity of the orbital transport to the underlying band topology. For completeness, we briefly discuss the scenario corresponding to a Néel-ordered spin alignment, which leads to a vanishing Chern number and consequently suppressed thermal Hall and orbital Nernst conductivities compared to the zigzag-ordered case, even in the presence of DMI and Kitaev interactions.

Magnetic structures encode the underlying symmetries of magnetic materials and play a central role in determining their physical properties. However, reliable magnetic structures are known for only limited compounds. Traditional methods based on first-principles calculations are fundamentally limited by the need to calculate a large space of input magnetic configurations. Here we introduce a symmetry-aided strategy based on Landau's phase transition theory. By utilizing the crystallographic space group and the Wyckoff positions of magnetic ions, we narrow down the initial magnetic configurations to a limited number of candidates via the analysis of irreducible representations. The magnetic ground state is subsequently determined by the lowest energy of those well-seleted magnetic configurations via first-principles calculations. Benchmarking calculations are performed on a subset of the MAGNDATA database with q=0 and fewer than 40 atoms per unit cell, comprising 260 materials. Our method correctly identifies the magnetic structure for 207 of these materials, corresponding to an accuracy of 80%. We further apply our highly efficient method to the compounds with fewer than 20 atoms per unit cell in the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD), and establish a database containing 2,800 magnetic materials. As a demonstration of its utility, we apply our magnetic structure database to the systematic identification of 1,070 magnetic topological phases and 389 altermagnets.

Van der Waals magnets are attracting a lot of attention for their potential integration in spintronic and magnonic technologies. CrSBr is an A-type antiferromagnet that shows a coupling between its electronic band structure and magnetic properties. This property is appealing for applications and it also offers the possibility to investigate magnetic ground states and GHz magnons using visible optics techniques. Using Raman scattering and (magneto)-optical experiments, we describe the magnetic and optical properties of alloys of CrSBr$_{(1-x)}$Cl$_x$ with $x&lt;0.46$. Similar to CrSBr, these alloys are direct band gap semiconductors with a coupling of their electronic and magnetic properties. Exciton energies evolve weakly with composition and we describe the large changes in the saturation magnetic fields and their implications on the magnetic properties. We show that both the interlayer magnetic exchange and electronic interactions are modified by the halogen mixing, offering the possibility to tune magnon energies with alloy composition.

Indium iodides, which adopt layered or molecular-crystal-like arrangements depending on composition, are expected to exhibit low lattice thermal conductivity because of their heavy constituent atoms and weak In-I bonding. In this work, we employed first-principles anharmonic lattice dynamics calculations to systematically investigate phonon transport in indium iodides from particle- and wave-like perspectives. The calculated lattice thermal conductivities of both materials remained below 1 W/m-K over a broad temperature range. Notably, the influence of wave-like phonon transport differed by composition: in InI3, the wave-like contribution became comparable to the particle-like Peierls contribution, whereas it remained negligible in InI. We also investigated the thermal transport properties of the experimentally reported high-pressure phase of InI3. Motivated by experimental indications of stacking faults and partial disorder in indium site occupancy within the rhombohedral phase, we constructed several ordered structural models with different stacking sequences. These stacking sequences exhibited no significant energetic preference and had similar lattice thermal conductivities, suggesting that in-plane thermal transport is largely governed by the vibrational properties of the In2I6 layers themselves rather than by the specific stacking sequence. These findings provide insight into phonon transport in layered and molecular-crystal systems with structural complexity and contribute to a broader understanding of thermal transport mechanisms in layered and molecular-crystal-like materials.

- **TL;DR**: 基于扩散模型的生成式AI用于晶体结构中氢原子位置预测，通过计算机视觉中的图像修复技术实现结构补全，相比传统方法更快速准确。

Generative AI models, such as score-based diffusion models, have recently advanced the field of computational materials science by enabling the generation of new materials with desired properties. In addition, these models could also be leveraged to reconstruct crystal structures for which partial information is available. One relevant example is the reliable determination of atomic positions occupied by hydrogen atoms in hydrogen-containing crystalline materials. While crucial to the analysis and prediction of many materials properties, the identification of hydrogen positions can however be difficult and expensive, as it is challenging in X-ray scattering experiments and often requires dedicated neutron scattering measurements. As a consequence, inorganic crystallographic databases frequently report lattice structures where hydrogen atoms have been either omitted or inserted with heuristics or by chemical intuition. Here, we combine diffusion models from the field of materials science with techniques originally developed in computer vision for image inpainting. We present how this knowledge transfer across domains enables a much faster and more accurate completion of host structures, compared to unconditioned diffusion models or previous approaches solely based on DFT. Overall, our approach exceeds a success rate of 97% in terms of finding a structural match or predicting a more stable configuration than the initial reference, when starting both from structures that were already relaxed with DFT, or directly from the experimentally determined host structures.

Polar antiferromagnetic metals have recently garnered increasing interests due to their combined traits of both ferromagnets and antiferromagnets for spintronic applications. However, the inherently incompatible nature of antiferromagnet, metallicity and polarity pose a significant challenge. We propose that charge disproportionation can lead to this novel state in negative charge transfer gap regime in molecular orbital crystal by molecular orbital analyses of first-principles DFT+$U$ electronic band structure for representative Ruddlesden-Popper bilayer perovskite oxides Sr$_3$Co$_2$O$_7$, corroborated by Density Matrix Renormalization Group calculation. Due to the negative charge transfer nature of Co$^{4+}$ and imposed by strong interlayer coupling, localized molecular orbitals stemming from the hybridization of Co $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{xz/yz}$ orbitals through the apical oxygen $p$ orbitals are preferably emergent within each bilayer unit, which develop antiferromagnetic ordering by invoking Hubbard repulsion. Charge disproportionation driven by Hund's physics, makes an occupation imbalance with broken inversion symmetry in the remaining $d_{xy}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals from distinct Co atoms within the bilayer unit, resulting in the polar metallicity. Meanwhile, this charge disproportionation scenario allows consequent conducting carriers to couple with interlayer local spins via Hund's coupling, giving rise to in-plane double-exchange ferromagnetism. Our molecular orbital formulation further provides a guide towards an effective Hamiltonian for modelling the unconventional synergy of metallicity, polarity and antiferromagnetism in Sr$_3$Co$_2$O$_7$, which may be a unified framework widely applicable to double-layer Ruddlesden-Popper perovskite oxides.

X-ray crystallography rarely captures chemical bonding between atoms of a structure in question. Most of the time distance-based heuristics are applied to establish the pairs of bonded atoms. One class of such heuristics depends on a set of bonding radii that estimate the idealised size of each chemical element in a bond. This publication describes an unsupervised workflow for deriving a bonding radii set from crystal structure data in the Crystallography Open Database.

### Photo-induced non-thermal lattice disorder in aluminium thin-film

- **TL;DR**: 利用95-keV超快电子衍射研究铝薄膜中光诱导非热晶格无序的超快动力学，揭示了q依赖的多时间尺度晶格弛豫和相干声子振荡。

We investigate the ultrafast dynamics of photo-induced non-thermal lattice disorder in a polycrystalline aluminium thin film to elucidate transient short- and long-range lattice distortions, their thermalization and electron-phonon coupling timescales. Using a high-repetition-rate 95-keV ultrafast electron diffraction setup (UED), we measured the transient dynamics for the differential scattering signal in a momentum transfer, $q$, range longer than in conventional keV UED setups. Analysis of ten Bragg and six diffuse scattering revealed a prompt increase in the mean-square displacement (MSD), indicating rapid energy transfer from the excited electronic system to the lattice. The subsequent relaxation dynamics of the elastic scattering intensities exhibit a pronounced dependence on diffraction order. Lower-order reflections relax more rapidly, whereas higher-order reflections show significantly slower relaxation or near-plateau behaviour, indicating that lattice equilibration proceeds on multiple $q$-dependent timescales. Exponential fits to the MSD dynamics reveal oscillatory residuals, indicative of coherent non-thermal lattice motion. Power spectral density analysis of these residuals uncovers coherent lattice oscillations with a fundamental frequency of $ω_0 = 0.192$ THz, corresponding to the acoustic breathing (A$_{1g}$) mode of aluminium. Higher frequency components are also observed, consistent with coherent phonon oscillations originating from a single zero-wavevector mode populated by multiple coherent phonons. While individual phonon branches are not directly resolved, the observed dependence on the lattice plane of the relaxation behaviour and oscillatory signatures are consistent with a mode-selective lattice response and non-thermal energy redistribution as described by non-thermal lattice models.

### FIR transmission and resistively detected cyclotron resonances in InSb

We have developed an experimental setup to simultaneously acquire magneto-transmission spectra and measure the photoconductive response. The low-temperature ($T$=4.2 K) magneto-transmission data for weakly doped InSb in the frequency range 3-15 THz and magnetic fields up to 25 T, shows that the AC conductivity is governed by the classical Drude response. Moreover, the resulting light-induced voltage in this system, consisting of thermoelectric and resistive contributions, both contain features that are related to cyclotron resonances. The frequency dependence of this resonance is in good agreement with $\mathbf{k\cdot p}$ perturbation theory and corresponds to transitions between the first and second Landau level with spin-up electrons. The obtained effective mass $m^{*}(B=0)=0.014m_{e}$, is in line with the value extracted from magneto-transmission experiments. Additionally, we can observe evidence of a fluence-dependent metal-insulator transition in the thermoelectric signal, which suggest that the electronic system becomes less sensitive to the light at higher frequencies.

Defect-based single-photon emitters (SPEs) in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) are promising platforms for integrated quantum photonics; however, the absence of identified emitters operating at telecom wavelengths remains a critical limitation for fiber-based quantum communication. Here, we investigate previously unexplored carbon- and silicon-based point defects in monolayer h-BN as SPE candidates using hybrid density functional theory, constrained excited-state relaxations, and a generating-function approach to photoluminescence. We compute zero-phonon-line (ZPL) energies, radiative lifetimes, Huang-Rhys (HR) factors, and photoluminescence lineshapes to screen optical performance. All defects are thermodynamically stable with negative formation energies, and five candidates exhibit moderate electron-phonon coupling (HR &lt; 5), indicating narrow emission linewidths. These emitters span a broad spectral range from the visible to the telecom regime, including near-infrared C-based centers and, most notably, the Si2BVN defect, which is identified as the first point defect in monolayer h-BN predicted to support single-photon emission in the telecom C band (1554 nm). Vacancy-containing complexes possess spin-1/2 ground states, enabling spin-photon interfaces compatible with integrated photonic and cavity-based platforms. The combined analysis of ZPL energies, electron-phonon coupling, and radiative lifetimes provides concrete targets for experimental realization of spin-active single-photon emitters in h-BN from the visible to telecom wavelengths.

- **TL;DR**: (110)取向应变工程可调控铁电薄膜的相和畴稳定性，相比传统(100)取向能产生更多亚稳态纳米结构，具有更高的功能可调性。

Strain and domain engineering offer powerful routes to control phase and domain stability in ferroelectric thin films. While most studies have focused on (100)-oriented growth, the impact of lower-symmetry orientations remains underexplored. We address this gap in knowledge with first-principles based molecular dynamics simulation for the example of prototypical ferroelectric perovskites under (110) strain. Epitaxial (110) strains may indeed outperform the widely studied (100) orientation, as even modest strain values stabilize a diverse set of metastable nanoscale states with potential high functional tunability. In this regime, the films exhibit multidomain configurations with domain wall normal oriented along the clamped in-plane or the relaxed out-of-plane directions and heterophases in BaTiO$_3$ and KNbO$_3$. Besides, complex superdomain patterns and antiferroelectric-like domains are observed in PbTiO$_3$. These metastable nanoscale configurations may allow for large reversible responses.

### Dynamic stress response kernels for dislocations and cracks: unified anisotropic Lagrangian formulation

Elastodynamic cohesive-zone models for defects such as cracks or dislocations (such as the Geubelle-Rice model for cracks, or the Dynamic Peierls Equation for flat-core dislocations), feature the same stress-response convolution kernel in space and time. It accounts for in-plane elastic wave propagation, while its associated instantaneous radiative term accounts for radiative losses in the surrounding medium. These objects are well-known for isotropic elasticity, with their space-time representations involving generalized functions. For anisotropic elasticity they were unknown. The paper presents a derivation using the Stroh formalism. Their Fourier representation rests exclusively on the so-called prelogarithmic Lagrangian factor $L(v)$, while their space-time form involves its derivative $p(v)=L'(v)$, the prelogarithmic impulsion function. A straightforward consequence is the reformulation of the stress in the Weertman model of steadily-moving dislocations in terms of $L(v)$. Special care being paid to the causality constraint, the theory covers indifferently subsonic, intersonic and supersonic regimes of motion. The theory proposed is suitable to phase-field-type Fourier-based numerical codes for planar systems of defects in anisotropic elastodynamics.

Electrochemical creatinine sensors offer great promise towards rapid, reagent-free and point-of-care (POC) kidney-function monitoring. However, challenges related to analyte binding, data reproducibility, sensitivity, fouling and device degradation deter its widespread implementation. Here, we show how a carbon electrode modified with a combination of poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene): poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and copper nanoparticles (CuNPs) can rapidly and accurately detect creatinine (CT) in artificial urine media employing electrochemical techniques. Applying redox potential sweeps (vs Ag/AgCl) using copper sulfate (CuSO4) solution on such sensor facilitates the CuNP embedding process inside the conjugated polymer matrix which has been further validated by supporting techniques. We predicted and validated the formation and contribution of two Cu-CT coordination complexes corresponding to Cu(I) and Cu(II) states, which are responsible for CT detection. The fabricated CT sensor exhibits high selectivity against major artificial urine interferents and is stable for a month showing minimal degradation (0.53%) in peak current value. Such sensors can be utilized to detect and monitor different stages of renal failure in real-time patient samples.

### Morphology dependent decomposition and pore evolution during oxidation of Cr$_2$AlC coatings revealed by correlative tomography

Quantitative 3D characterization of materials degradation in oxidizing environments remains limited. Here, we apply a correlative tomography-based mass balance framework to Cr$_2$AlC, a coating candidate for accident tolerant nuclear fuel claddings and turbine blades, and show that decomposition and pore evolution during oxidation, quantified by integrating volumetric, structural and compositional data, are strongly governed by grain morphology. The oxidation of sputtered Cr$_2$AlC coatings with equiaxed and columnar grain morphologies was analyzed. While Cr$_7$C$_3$ formed in both coating morphologies, pores formed exclusively in columnar coatings. The expected Cr$_7$C$_3$ volume was estimated by mass-balance calculations assuming that Al-deintercalation enables oxide scale and Al-O-C-N precipitate formation, leading to complete transformation of the Al-deintercalated Cr$_2$AlC into Cr$_7$C$_3$. In equiaxed coatings, the predicted carbide volume agreed with tomography within 3 $\pm$ 3 %, confirming Al-deintercalation-driven Cr$_7$C$_3$ formation. Despite the smaller molar volume of Cr$_7$C$_3$ relative to Cr$_2$AlC, absence of pores imply that transformation shrinkage is likely accommodated by coating thickness reduction. In columnar coatings, the predicted Cr$_7$C$_3$ volume exceeds the measured value by 22 $\pm$ 4 %, and the pore volume expected from transformation shrinkage alone is 13-16 % lower than measured, indicating partial Al deintercalation and clustering of pre-existing defects. This combined methodology provides a general route to quantitatively resolve degradation mechanisms.

Mapping microstructure to properties is central to materials science. Perhaps most famously, the Hall-Petch relationship relates average grain size to strength. More challenging has been deriving relationships for properties that depend on subtle microstructural features and not average properties. One such example is the initiation of energetic materials under dynamical loading, dominated by energy localization on microstructural features such as pores, cracks, and interfaces. We propose a conditional convolutional neural network to predict the shock-induced temperature field as a function of shock strength, for a wide range of microstructures, and obtained via two different simulation methods. The proposed model, denoted MISTnet2, significantly extends prior work that was limited to a single shock strength, model, and type of microstructure. MISTnet2 can contribute to bridging atomistics with coarse-grain simulations and enable first principles predictions of detonation initiation and safety of this class of materials.

Quantum geometry in centrosymmetric systems has motivated the search for photocurrent responses beyond second order. In particular, electric field-induced nonlinear responses may also enable intrinsic polarization-sensitive optical detectors. Despite numerous efforts, clear methods are still needed to remove experimental artifacts, separating intrinsic from extrinsic effects, and disentangling linear responses from their higher-order counterparts. Here, we provide a systematic study of fabrication and measurement techniques to remove external artifacts in photoelectronic responses. This reveals a previously hidden photothermoelectric response in the transverse photoresistivity of symmetric thin films of simple metals. We identify its origin in thermal gradients producing current deflection and determine the device design and measurement parameters to minimize extrinsic effects that arise in photoinduced electronic responses.
