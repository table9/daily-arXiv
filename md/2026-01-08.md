Signatures of unconventional superconductivity have been reported in a wide range of van der Waals (vdW) materials. However, their microscopic origin remains unclear due to competing electronic orders, strong spin-orbit coupling, and structural instabilities in the normal state. Here we investigate the role of interlayer breathing and shear modes in superconducting vdW heterostructures. Contrary to conventional wisdom -- which assumes that weak interlayer bonding and large layer separation suppress electronic coupling to these modes -- we show that the associated charge transfer can generate a substantial pairing interaction. We develop a theory of superconductivity mediated by such interlayer modes and demonstrate that proximity to a ferroelectric or antiferroelectric quantum critical point provides a strong-coupling pairing channel. Within a two-dimensional model with SU(2) symmetry and in-plane isotropy, we find an accidental degeneracy between interlayer triplet states, which can occur even for an $s$-wave in-plane gap. We further show that Josephson coupling between layers, arising from either static magnetism or induced by paramagnetic correlations, can stabilize a time-reversal-symmetry-breaking superconducting state of the $s+i\,s$ type, which couples to magnetization when at least two mirror symmetries are absent. Our results are directly applicable to candidate chiral vdW superconductors such as 4Hb-TaS$_2$ and to sliding ferroelectric metals, exemplified by bilayer MoTe$_2$. More broadly, our work identifies ferroelectric fluctuations as a promising route to unconventional pairing in vdW systems and motivates experimental searches for chiral multicomponent superconductivity.

- **TL;DR**: 在面内铁磁体与传统超导体异质结中发现拓扑节点超导相的证据

The potential application of topological superconductivity in quantum transport and quantum information has fueled an intense investigation of hybrid materials with emergent electronic properties, including magnet-superconductor heterostructures. Here, we report evidence of a topological nodal-point superconducting phase in a one-atom-thick in-plane ferromagnet in direct proximity to a conventional $s$-wave superconductor. Low-temperature scanning tunneling spectroscopy data reveal the presence of a double-peak low-energy feature in the local density of states of the hybrid system, which is rationalized via model calculations to be an emergent topological nodal-point superconducting phase with tilted Weyl cones. Our results further establish the combination of in-plane ferromagnetism and conventional superconductivity as a route to design two-dimensional topological quantum phases.

Circuits based on superconducting nanostructures are among the most promising platforms for quantum computing. Understanding how device geometry governs nonlinear electrodynamics is crucial for implementing superconducting quantum technologies. However, to date, research has largely been limited to superconducting nanostructures with collinearly aligned static and dynamic applied magnetic fields. Here, we analyze the dynamics of Meissner currents and Abrikosov vortices in a superconducting nanocube exposed to combined static and microwave magnetic fields, extending the analysis to a more general excitation geometry. We demonstrate that, in a noncollinear configuration,the magnetization component parallel to the static field develops a dominant second-harmonic response under the microwave driving. This effect is strongly enhanced when Meissner currents saturate at static fields just below the thresholds for successive vortex nucleation. By numerically solving the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations, we show that the response originates from Meissner-current saturation combined with the nonlinear oscillations of normal-phase indentations, yielding an anisotropic second-harmonic signal that is directionally separated from, and not overshadowed by, the first-harmonic component of the dynamic magnetization. These findings are relevant for superconducting devices that require controllable high-frequency nonlinearity.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文研究了Mn₃Pt-超导体异质结构中的超导二极管效应，揭示了反铁磁材料如何通过无净磁化的自旋分裂产生时间反演对称性破缺的超导现象。

Altermagnets have recently emerged as a distinct class of magnetic systems that exhibit spin splitting of electronic bands while retaining zero net magnetization. This unique combination makes them a promising platform for time-reversal symmetry-breaking superconducting phenomena, although identifying concrete material platforms remains an important open challenge. Here, we develop a theory for the superconducting diode effect observed experimentally in a Mn$_3$Pt-superconductor heterostructure. Using both a symmetry analysis and model calculations on the breathing kagome lattice, we show how the altermagnetic spin textures in Mn$_3$Pt generate a spin splitting of the electronic bands that remains magnetization-free even in the presence of spin-orbit coupling and, upon taking into account the proximity coupling across the interface, produces a superconducting diode effect. We also demonstrate that the angular dependence of the critical current provides a probe of the magnetic order. We hope that our work will contribute to the understanding and further discovery of candidate materials for novel altermagnet-superconductor hybrid devices.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文重新评估了亚铁氰化铁铵（Giese盐）的多功能性质，不仅作为铯放射性核素的解毒剂，还展示了其在纳米结构化学、铁磁性和生物医学应用中的潜力。

Ammonium ferric hexacyanoferrate is a veterinary-medical milestone and antidote against radiocesium, well-known as Giese-salt after the Chernobyl disaster fed to domestic and wild animals, which shows even a rich interplay of properties in nanostructural chemistry and ferromagnetism. Among the broad analytical techniques, the ambivalence of macroscopic micrometer-sized agglomerates and nanoparticle sizes, a suggested enlarged Fe(II)$-$C$\equiv$N$-$Fe(III) bond length by Fe K-edge XAFS results and multi-level spin relaxation in $^{57}$Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy are highlighted. This sets this underestimated compound in a new light, e.g., for modern biomedicine and biofunctionality, extending its essential importance in addition to hypothetical future nuclear incidents

- **TL;DR**: UGe₂薄膜的电子结构对化学计量偏差具有鲁棒性，U-5f态在费米能级占主导，DFT+U计算与实验光谱吻合良好。

Uranium digermanide UGe$_2$, the first ferromagnetic superconductor, represents a key composition in the U-Ge system dominated by U-5$f$ states. To examine the impact of controlled stoichiometric deviations on the electronic structure, UGe$_{2\pm x}$ thin films ($0 \le x \le 1$) were prepared by triode sputtering and studied on pristine surfaces by X-ray (XPS) and Ultraviolet (UPS) photoelectron spectroscopy. XPS and UPS reveal a robust metallic valence band with a dominant U-5$f$ contribution at the Fermi level and a broad incoherent feature at higher binding energies, without qualitative changes in spectral line shape across the composition range. The experimental spectrum of UGe$_2$ thin films is well reproduced by DFT+U(ED) valence-band calculations combining density functional theory with exact diagonalization of the multiconfigurational U-5$f$ shell. These results demonstrate that the overall U-Ge electronic framework of UGe$_2$ thin films remains resilient to moderate stoichiometric deviations, providing a reliable electronic baseline for future studies of interface- and heterostructure-driven phenomena in uranium-based systems.

- **TL;DR**: 提出基于曲率的谱图同构新算法，能正确解决所有测试实例，包括经典谱方法难以处理的图

Determining whether two graphs are structurally identical is a fundamental problem with applications spanning mathematics, computer science, chemistry, and network science. Despite decades of study, graph isomorphism remains a challenging algorithmic task, particularly for highly symmetric structures. Here we introduce a new algorithmic approach based on ideas from spectral graph theory and geometry that constructs candidate correspondences between vertices using their curvatures. Any correspondence produced by the algorithm is explicitly verified, ensuring that non-isomorphic graphs are never incorrectly identified as isomorphic. Although the method does not yet guarantee success on all isomorphic inputs, we find that it correctly resolves every instance tested in deterministic polynomial time, including a broad collection of graphs known to be difficult for classical spectral techniques. These results demonstrate that enriched spectral methods can be far more powerful than previously understood, and suggest a promising direction for the practical resolution of the complexity of the graph isomorphism problem.

- **TL;DR**: 使用功能重整化群方法研究长程O(N)模型在淬火到临界温度后的动力学标度行为，分析短时老化和长时弛豫，并证明长程系统能提升临界热机性能

We study the dynamical scaling of long-range $\mathrm{O}(N)$ models after a sudden quench to the critical temperature, using the functional renormalization group approach. We characterize both short-time aging and long-time relaxation as a function of the symmetry index $N$, the interaction range decay exponent $σ$ and the dimension $d$. Our results substantially improve on perturbative predictions, as demonstrated by benchmarks against Monte Carlo simulations and the large-$N$ limit. Finally, we demonstrate that long-range systems increase the performance of critical heat engines with respect to a local active medium.

A discrete binomial random-walk description of molecular collisions is used to quantify the variance of coarse-grained velocity fields arising solely from collision-induced momentum exchange. Closed-form expressions for the growth of velocity variance as functions of coarse-graining scale and time are derived and shown to imply a power-law decay of variance with averaging scale. Particle-based ensemble simulations validate the predicted scaling and temporal behaviour; surrogate ensemble tests demonstrate that phase/temporal coherence is required for the observed integrated transfer diagnostics. The analysis is intentionally restricted to collision-generated fluctuations in quiescent fluids and does not model cascade dynamics; implications for possible amplification under inertial dynamics are discussed cautiously. All data and the minimal verification instructions required to reproduce the summary tables are embedded in Appendix A.

### Altermagnetic Superconducting Diode Effect in Mn$_{3}$Pt/Nb Heterostructures

Compensated magnetic orders that can split the spin-degeneracy of electronic bands have become a very active field of research. As opposed to spin-orbit coupling, the splitting resulting from these "altermagnets" is not a small relativistic correction and, in contrast to ferromagnets, not accompanied by a net magnetization and large stray fields. In particular, the theoretical analysis of the interplay of altermagnetism and superconductivity has taken center stage, while experimental investigations of their coexistence remain in their infancy. We here study heterostructures consisting of Nb thins films interfaced with the $T_1$ and $T_2$ phases of Mn$_3$Pt. These non-collinear magnetic states can be thought of as descendants from the same altermagnetic order in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. We demonstrate the non-trivial impact on the superconducting state of Nb, which exhibits a zero-field superconducting diode effect, despite the compensated ($T_2$) and nearly-compensated ($T_1$) magnetic order; the diode efficiencies can reach large values (up to 50$\%$). The diode effect is found to be highly sensitive to the form of the magnetic order, illustrating its potential as a symmetry probe. The complex magnetic field and temperature dependence hint at a rich interplay of multiple contributing mechanisms. Our results define a new materials paradigm for dissipationless spintronics and magnetization-free diode functionality, while motivating further exploration of non-collinear altermagnetic superconductors.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究通过近场动力学方法模拟脆性材料动态断裂实验，发现应力强度因子在恒定裂纹扩展速度下显著变化，高速时微分支导致更大散射

This study investigates one of the central problems of dynamic fracture mechanics, namely the dependence of the instantaneous stress intensity factor (SIF) on the crack propagation velocity. For this purpose, the well-known experiments by Ravi-Chandar and Knauss on brittle, amorphous Homalite-100 polymer plates are modeled using a peridynamic approach. The numerical model integrates the previously proposed remote stress fracture criterion into an incubation time fracture criterion. Results of numerical modeling indicate a significant variation in SIF values at an almost constant crack propagation velocity. Moreover, for higher crack propagation velocities, micro-branching is obtained numerically, leading to a larger scatter of SIF values. These effects were also observed in the experiments of Ravi-Chandar and Knauss, which provides new insights into the nature of the crack-velocity dependence of the Mode-I SIF.

### Superconductivity, Kondo physics and magnetic order: Tuning the groundstate in the La$_{1-x}$Ce$_x$FeSiH solid solution through the interplay between $3d$ and $4f$ correlated electrons

We report a study of the La$_{1-x}$Ce$_x$FeSiH solid solution ($0 \leq x \leq 1$), a family of intermetallic hydrides of ZrCuSiAs-type structure, with space group $P4/nmm$. For low cerium concentrations $x \leq 0.20$, we observe the presence of superconductivity, which originates from the correlated $3d$ electrons of iron. The superconducting regime is progressively suppressed by the cerium substitution. For moderate cerium concentration $0.07 \leq x \leq 0.50$, we observe evidence of the single-ion Kondo effect and no magnetic phase transition down to 2 K. For $0.07 \leq x \leq 0.20$, the single-ion Kondo effect coexists with a superconducting ground state at low temperatures. From $x &gt; 0.50$, we observe signatures of Kondo coherence and a heavy Fermi liquid regime at low temperature. Finally, at high cerium concentration $x \geq 0.85$, we observe signatures of magnetic ordering at low temperatures. We discuss our results by introducing temperature scales related to superconductivity, the Kondo effect, and magnetic order, which permits building a rich phase diagram temperature versus cerium content $x$. This shows that using the cerium concentration $x$ as a unique control parameter, we can explore the Kondo entanglement between correlated $3d$ and $4f$ electrons, which suggests an unusual change between the superconducting state related to the $3d$ electrons and the Kondo coherent state involving both $3d$ and $4f$ electrons.

### Accelerated simulation of multiscale gas-radiation coupling flows via a general synthetic iterative scheme

- **TL;DR**: 提出基于GSIS的玻尔兹曼型辐射气体流动动力学模型，在宽泛流动和辐射输运体系中实现高效准确模拟，特别针对高超声速再入流动中的非平衡气体和辐射热输运问题。

Gas-radiation coupling critically influences hypersonic reentry flows, where extreme temperatures induce pronounced non-equilibrium gas and radiative heat transport. Accurate and efficient simulation of radiative gas dynamics is therefore indispensable for reliable design of thermal protection systems for atmospheric entry vehicles. In this study, a Boltzmann-type kinetic model for radiative gas flows is solved across a broad spectrum of flow and radiation transport regimes using the general synthetic iterative scheme (GSIS). The approach integrates an unstructured finite-volume discrete velocity method with a set of macroscopic synthetic equations. Within this framework, the kinetic model provides high-order closures for the constitutive relations in the synthetic equations. Simultaneously, the macroscopic synthetic equations drive the evolution of the mesoscopic kinetic system, significantly accelerating steady-state convergence in near-continuum regimes, as substantiated by linear Fourier stability analysis. Crucially, the algorithm is proven to be asymptotic-preserving, correctly recovering the continuum and optically thick limits, represented by the radiative Navier-Stokes-Fourier equations governing distinct translational, rotational, vibrational, and radiative temperatures, on coarse meshes independent of the mean free path. Numerical simulations of challenging benchmarks, including three-dimensional hypersonic flow over an Apollo reentry capsule, demonstrate that GSIS achieves orders-of-magnitude speedup over conventional iterative schemes in multiscale simulations of radiative gas flows while accurately capturing non-equilibrium effects and radiative heat transfer in hypersonic environments.

These lecture notes present a comprehensive and powerful many-body technique pioneered in 1960 by D. N. Zubarev. The technique, known as the Zubarev Double Time Greens Function method, was used extensively by leading solid state physicists such as John Hubbard and Laura Roth in the 1960s. We present the technique and apply it to the non-interacting electron and boson gas. We next consider the (many-body) Hubbard model and show how it yields the Stoner criterion for ferromagnetism. It is easily extendable to superconductivity and related problems. Our treatment is pedagogical and understandable to those with just an elementary understanding of second quantization.

- **TL;DR**: AI驱动的离子液体发现方法，用于从烟气中捕获CO2，识别出36个可行候选物，可降低运营和资本支出5-10%

We present an AI-driven approach to discover compounds with optimal properties for CO2 capture from flue gas-refinery emissions' primary source. Focusing on ionic liquids (ILs) as alternatives to traditional amine-based solvents, we successfully identify new IL candidates with high working capacity, manageable viscosity, favorable regeneration energy, and viable synthetic routes. Our approach follows a five-stage pipeline. First, we generate IL candidates by pairing available cation and anion molecules, then predict temperature- and pressure-dependent CO2 solubility and viscosity using a GNN-based molecular property prediction model. Next, we convert solubility to working capacity and regeneration energy via Van't Hoff modeling, and then find the best set of candidates using Pareto optimization, before finally filtering those based on feasible synthesis routes. We identify 36 feasible candidates that could enable 5-10% OPEX savings and up to 10% CAPEX reductions through lower regeneration energy requirements and reduced corrosivity-offering a novel carbon-capture strategy for refineries moving forward.

- **TL;DR**: 通过圆偏振光照射平面反铁磁体，可以动态生成偶宇称单向自旋劈裂，产生类似d波交变磁体的动量空间自旋纹理。

When a coplanar antiferromagnet (AFM) with $xy$-plane magnetic moments exhibits a spin-split band structure and unidirectional spin polarization along $z$, the spin polarization is forced to be an odd function of momentum by the fundamental symmetry $[\bar{C}_{2z}\|\mathcal{T}]$. Coplanar AFMs displaying such odd-parity unidirectional spin splittings are known as odd-parity magnets. In this work, we propose the realization of their missing even-parity counterparts. We begin by deriving the symmetry conditions required for an even-parity, out-of-plane spin splitting. We then show that irradiating a spin-degenerate coplanar AFM with circularly polarized light lifts the $[\bar{C}_{2z}|\mathcal{T}]$ constraint, dynamically generating this even-parity state. Specifically, the light-induced unidirectional spin splitting exhibits a $d$-wave texture in momentum space, akin to that of a $d$-wave altermagnet. We prove this texture's robustness against spin canting and show it yields a unique clover-like angular dependence in the Drude spin conductivity. Our work demonstrates that optical driving can generate novel spin-split phases in coplanar AFMs, thereby diversifying the landscape of materials exhibiting distinct spin splittings.

- **TL;DR**: 提出基于等变神经网络(ENN)的对称保持框架，用于晶格哈密顿量中的机器学习力场，能够嵌入离散点群和内部对称性，应用于Holstein哈密顿量的绝热动力学模拟。

Machine-learning (ML) force fields enable large-scale simulations with near-first-principles accuracy at substantially reduced computational cost. Recent work has extended ML force-field approaches to adiabatic dynamical simulations of condensed-matter lattice models with coupled electronic and structural or magnetic degrees of freedom. However, most existing formulations rely on hand-crafted, symmetry-aware descriptors, whose construction is often system-specific and can hinder generality and transferability across different lattice Hamiltonians. Here we introduce a symmetry-preserving framework based on equivariant neural networks (ENNs) that provides a general, data-driven mapping from local configurations of dynamical variables to the associated on-site forces in a lattice Hamiltonian. In contrast to ENN architectures developed for molecular systems -- where continuous Euclidean symmetries dominate -- our approach aims to embed the discrete point-group and internal symmetries intrinsic to lattice models directly into the neural-network representation of the force field. As a proof of principle, we construct an ENN-based force-field model for the adiabatic dynamics of the Holstein Hamiltonian on a square lattice, a canonical system for electron-lattice physics. The resulting ML-enabled large-scale dynamical simulations faithfully capture mesoscale evolution of the symmetry-breaking phase, illustrating the utility of lattice-equivariant architectures for linking microscopic electronic processes to emergent dynamical behavior in condensed-matter lattice systems.

- **TL;DR**: 提出一种在笛卡尔网格上实现任意形状嵌入边界的方法，用于求解可压缩电阻磁流体动力学方程，避免切割单元的时间步长问题，并扩展到移动界面建模。

Motivated by the increased interest in pulsed-power magneto-inertial fusion devices in recent years, we present a method for implementing an arbitrarily shaped embedded boundary on a Cartesian mesh while solving the equations of compressible resistive magnetohydrodynamics. The method is built around a finite volume formulation of the equations in which a Riemann solver is used to compute fluxes on the faces between grid cells, and a face-centered constrained transport formulation of the induction equation. The small time step problem associated with the cut cells is avoided by always computing fluxes on the faces and edges of the Cartesian mesh. We extend the method to model a moving interface between two materials with different properties using a ghost-fluid approach, and show some preliminary results including shock-wave-driven and magnetically-driven dynamical compressions of magnetohydrostatic equilibria. We present a thorough verification of the method and show that it converges at second order in the absence of discontinuities, and at first order with a discontinuity in material properties.

Non-reciprocal interactions play a key role in shaping transport in active and passive systems, giving rise to striking nonequilibrium behavior. Here, we study the dynamics of a tracer -- active or passive -- embedded in a bath of active or passive particles, coupled through non-reciprocal interactions. Starting from the microscopic stochastic dynamics of the full system, we derive an overdamped generalized Langevin equation for the tracer, incorporating a non-Markovian memory kernel that captures bath-mediated correlations. This framework enables us to compute the tracer's velocity and displacement response, derive a generalized nonequilibrium fluctuation-dissipation relation that quantifies deviations from equilibrium behavior, and determine the mean-squared displacement (MSD). We find that while the MSD becomes asymptotically diffusive, the effective diffusivity depends non-monotonically on the degree of non-reciprocity and diverges at an intermediate value. This regime of giant diffusivity provides a generic mechanism for enhanced transport in active soft matter and has direct implications for biological systems exhibiting chase-and-run or predator-prey interactions. Our analytical predictions are supported by numerical simulations of active Brownian particles, highlighting experimentally accessible signatures of non-reciprocal interactions in soft matter.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文认为实验观察到的低密度"固体"相实际上是安德森固体而非维格纳晶体，即电子被杂质随机局域化而非相互作用导致的自发对称性破缺

Critically analyzing recent STM and transport experiments [Z. Ge, et al, arXiv:2510.12009] on 2D electron systems in the presence of random quenched impurities, we argue that the resulting low-density putative "solid" phase reported experimentally is better described as an Anderson solid with the carriers randomly spatially localized by impurities than as a Wigner solid where the carriers form a crystal due to an interaction-induced spontaneous breaking of the translational symmetry. In strongly disordered systems, the resulting solid is amorphous, which is adiabatically connected to the infinite disorder Anderson fixed point rather than the zero disorder Wigner crystal fixed point.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究通过广义主方程分析紫色细菌光合单元中LH2复合物B850单元间的激子转移，揭示了距离、角度和能量差异对转移速率的影响机制。

Aggregates of light harvesting 2 (LH2) complexes form the major exciton-relaying domain in the photosynthetic unit of purple bacteria. Application of a generalized master equation to pairs of the B850 units of LH2 complexes, where excitons predominantly reside, provide quantitative information on how the inter-LH2 exciton transfer depends on the distance, relative rotational angle, and the relative energies of the two LH2s. The distance dependence demonstrates significant enhancement of the rate due to quantum delocalization of excitons, the qualitative nature of which remains robust against the disorder. The angle dependence reflects isotropic nature of exciton transfer, which remains similar for the ensemble of disorder. The variation of the rate on relative excitation energies of LH2 exhibits resonance peaks, which however is fragile as the disorder becomes significant. Overall, the average transfer times between two LH2s are estimated to be in the range of 4 - 25 ps for physically plausible inter-LH2 distances.

In 1T-TaS2, the nearly-commensurate charge density wave (NC-CDW) exhibits emergent chirality, a property of interest for technological applications such as memory. We study the relationship between chirality and topological defects using holographic analysis of scanning tunneling microscopy data. By characterizing the CDW order parameter, we uncover distinct topological defects and define a chiral order parameter that connects directly to them. Our analysis distinguishes between vortex pairs in high-strain areas and glass-like soliton or discommensurations networks. We propose that perturbations, such as strain, drive vortex nucleation and annihilation, leaving solitons or discommensurations pinned by disorder. Electric fields induce soliton and discommensurations movement, causing chiral switching via localized order parameter melting, enabling controllable room-temperature chirality

Two widely used model-free lower bounds on the steady-state entropy production rate of a continuous-time Markov jump process are the thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR) bound $σ_\text{TUR}$, derived from the mean and variance of a current, and the waiting-time distribution (WTD) bound $σ_\mathcal{L}$, derived from the irreversibility of partially observed transition sequences together with their waiting times. It has been conjectured that $σ_{\mathcal L}$ is always at least as tight as $σ_{\mathrm{TUR}}$ when both are constructed from the same partially observed link. Here we provide four-state counterexamples in a nonequilibrium steady state where $σ_{\mathcal L}&lt;σ_{\mathrm{TUR}}$. This result shows that no universal ordering exists between these two inference bounds under partial observation.

In two-dimensional lattice systems, massless Dirac fermions undergo doubling, leading to the cancellation of net chirality. We demonstrate that the recently discovered altermagnetism can induce a unique mass term, the altermagnetic mass term, which gaps out Dirac cones with one chirality while maintaining the other gapless, leading to the emergence of net chirality. The surviving gapless Dirac cones retain identical winding numbers and exhibit the quantum anomalous Hall effect in the presence of the trivial constant mass term. When subjected to an external magnetic field, the altermagnetic mass induces Landau level asymmetry in Dirac fermions, resulting in fully valley-polarized quantum Hall edge states. Our findings reveal that Dirac fermions with the altermagnetic mass harbor rich physical phenomena warranting further exploration.

Scalable hydrogen production using proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers depends on overcoming efficiency losses arising from coupled multiphase, multicomponent transport and interfacial phenomena across the membrane electrode assembly. Here, we demonstrate a multiscale computational framework that combines pore network modeling with finite-element-based reactive transport simulations to accurately and efficiently resolve structure-performance trade-offs in porous transport layers (PTLs). We perform experiments for both commercial single-layer PTLs and microporous layer (MPL)-integrated configurations to benchmark the electrochemical model, achieving excellent agreement between modeling and measurements. We show that in single-layer PTLs, open porous networks facilitate mass transport but incur large voltage penalties from PTL-anode catalyst layer (ACL) contact resistance. Bilayer architectures with dense MPLs reduce these losses by simultaneously improving transport, contact, and structural stability. Finally, in stratified multilayer stacks, combining fine pores near the ACL with highly porous backing layers delivers superior performance at high current densities. Altogether, these results establish mechanistic guidelines for porosity-informed PTL design that minimize interfacial resistance and enable high-efficiency PEMWE operation.

We present an optical study of near-surface Er$^{3+}$ ensembles in waveguide-integrated CaWO$_4$ and YVO$_4$, investigating how nanophotonic coupling modifies rare-earth spectroscopy. In particular, we compare bulk excitation with evanescently coupled TE and TM waveguide modes. In Er$^{3+}$:CaWO$_4$, we observe a pronounced polarization-dependent surface effect. TE-coupled spectra closely reproduce bulk behavior. In contrast, TM coupling induces strong inhomogeneous broadening and an asymmetric low-energy shoulder of the site S1 Y1Z1 transition, with linewidths exceeding those of the bulk by more than a factor of four. Temperature-dependent measurements and surface termination studies indicate that surface charges are the dominant mechanism. Er$^{3+}$:YVO$_4$ remains largely unaffected by mode polarization, and surface termination leads only to minor spectral shifts. These observations suggest that non-charge-neutral rare-earth systems are more susceptible to surface-induced decoherence sources than charge-neutral hosts.

### Stochastic Path Compression for Spectral Tensor Networks on Cyclic Graphs

- **TL;DR**: 提出随机路径压缩(SPC)方法压缩循环张量网络，通过重要性采样定位大键维边，结合积分消去算法处理连续自由度系统

We develop a new approach to compress cyclic tensor networks called stochastic path compression (SPC) that uses an iterative importance sampling procedure to target edges with large bond-dimensions. Closed random walks in SPC form compression pathways that spatially localize large bond-dimensions in the tensor network. Analogous to the phase separation of two immiscible liquids, SPC separates the graph of bond-dimensions into spatially distinct high and low density regions. When combined with our integral decimation algorithm, SPC facilitates the accurate compression of cyclic tensor networks with continuous degrees of freedom. To benchmark and illustrate the methods, we compute the absolute thermodynamics of $q$-state clock models on two-dimensional square lattices and an XY model on a Watts-Strogatz graph, which is a small-world network with random connectivity between spins.

We present experimental results on knotting in off-lattice self-avoiding polygons in the bead-chain model. Using Clisby's tree data structure and the scale-free pivot algorithm, for each $k$ between $10$ and $27$ we generated $2^{43-k}$ polygons of size $n=2^k$. Using a new knot diagram simplification and invariant-free knot classification code, we were able to determine the precise knot type of each polygon. The results show that the number of prime summands of knot type $K$ in a random $n$-gon is very well described by a Poisson distribution. We estimate the characteristic length of knotting as $656500 \pm 2500$. We use the count of summands for large $n$ to measure knotting rates and amplitude ratios of knot probabilities more accurately than previous experiments. Our calculations agree quite well with previous on-lattice computations, and support both knot localization and the knot entropy conjecture.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文揭示了Rashba、Dresselhaus和Weyl哈密顿量之间的隐藏对应关系，通过特定幺正变换相互映射，建立了自旋轨道相互作用的统一理论框架。

The Rashba, Dresselhaus, and Weyl Hamiltonians form a foundational framework for modeling spin-orbit interactions across condensed matter systems. Although they describe distinct material classes and produce seemingly different spin textures, they are conventionally treated as separate, unrelated theoretical frameworks. Here, this work demonstrates that the linear 2D Rashba and Weyl models are connected by a specific unitary transformation that maps one Hamiltonian exactly onto the other. The same unitary can be applied to map the linear Dresselhaus-1 model onto the Dresselhaus-2 models and vice versa. Such hidden correspondence establishes a unified theoretical foundation for spin-orbit interactions, deepening our conceptual understanding of spin-orbit coupling and opening new avenues for exploring complex spin textures. To illustrate the application, this work introduces a unique, improved, and more realistic model Hamiltonian H_MKM combining all known foundational spintronic models, where the stringent condition of equal spin-orbit coupling strength of Rashba and Dresselhaus may not be required to observe persistent spin texture under MKM transformation.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究比较了两种用于有机染料TDDFT计算的参数调谐策略，发现简化的ω_eff方法在预测BN掺杂有机分子的电离势方面比复杂的ω_IP方法更准确，且与波函数理论相当。

The strategic incorporation of heteroatoms (N, O, and B) into organic dyes is a versatile and effective approach to enhance molecular properties. This approach is highly attractive for tailoring organic solar cells, as it allows for precise control over the HOMO and LUMO energy levels, enabling the design and customization of organic molecules with desired optical and electronic properties. In this work, we aim to contribute to this pursuit by exploring novel charge transfer materials with Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TDDFT), specifically using the Tamm-Dancoff Approximation (TDA). This study evaluates two distinct parameter-tuning strategies for the range-separated hybrid (RSH) functional. The first uses a simplified scheme $ω_{eff}$, while the second implements a more intricate protocol $ω_{IP}$ designed to reproduce the exact ionization potential. The accuracy of the effective-tuning ($ω_{eff}$) method was tested against experimental values of ionization potentials for BN-doped organic molecules. A comparative analysis of our data reveals that the accuracy of the ($ω_{eff}$) approach is superior to that of the more complicated ($ω_{IP}$) method and comparable to wave function theory (WFT).

Group 14 Zintl clusters are promising molecular building blocks for nanoscale architecture. Endohedral variants, which encapsulate d/f-block metals within p-block semimetal cages, provide insights into intermetallic bonding and compound formation. In this study, experimental photoelectron spectroscopy and first-principles calculations were used to investigate the Ir-doped germanium cluster species. A new C2v symmetric building block, IrGe12, was identified, serving as the basis for designing the supercluster Ir3Ge20 with a cloverleaf-shaped, D3h symmetric architecture. This structure consists of three interconnected aromatic IrGe12 units linked by Ge-Ge sigma bonds, forming shielding cones. Ir3Ge20 follows the 5n rule with 100 valence electrons, featuring a core-Ir3 unit with a d10 closed-shell configuration sharing electrons with the Ge20 skeleton. The stability, chemical bonding, and aromaticity of Ir3Ge20 were confirmed, demonstrating a novel approach to precise atom manipulation in cluster-based materials and devices.

We report bulk magnetic properties of ytterbium tantalate in its monoclinic fergusonite modification, M-YbTaO4. The spin-1/2 Yb3+ ions in this phase are arranged on a geometrically frustrated "stretched diamond" lattice. M-YbTaO4 cannot be prepared at ambient pressure and was instead prepared in a belt-type apparatus at 6 GPa and 1800 C. Susceptibility and specific heat data show no long-range ordering down to 1.8 K and are consistent with a Jeff = 1/2 Kramers doublet which splits in an applied field. Furthermore, under high-pressure synthesis the entire solid solution YbNbxTa1-xO4 (0 &lt; x &lt; 1) can be stabilised in the M phase, in contrast to ambient-pressure synthesis which favours the competing M' phase for Ta-rich compositions. Subsequent annealing of the Nb-Ta mixed samples resulted in colour changes, suggesting oxygen deficiency in some of the as-prepared high pressure samples. There was little variation in the bulk magnetic properties upon varying either the Nb/Ta ratio or the annealing conditions.

We present a simple relativistic exact 2-component (X2C) Hamiltonian that models two-electron picture-change effects using Lehtola's superposition of atomic potentials (SAP) [S. Lehtola, J. Chem. Theory Comput. 15, 1593-1604 (2019)]. The SAP-X2C approach keeps the low-cost and technical simplicity of the popular 1-electron X2C (1eX2C) predecessor, but is significantly more accurate and has a well-defined thermodynamic limit, making it applicable to extended systems (such as periodic crystals). The assessment of the SAP-X2C-based Hartree-Fock total and spinor energies, spin-orbit splittings, equilibrium bond distances, and harmonic vibrational frequencies suggests that SAP-X2C is similar to the more complex atomic mean-field (AMF) X2C counterparts in the ability to approximate the 4-component Dirac-Hartree-Fock reference.

We investigate a driven particle system, a multilane asymmetric exclusion process, where the particle number in every lane is conserved, and stationary state is fully uncorrelated. The phase space has, starting from three lanes and more, an umbilic manifold where characteristic velocities of all the modes but one coincide, thus allowing us to study a weakly hyperbolic system with arbitrarily large degeneracy. We then study space-time fluctuations in the steady state, at the umbilic manifold, which are expected to exhibit universal scaling features. We formulate an effective mode-coupling theory (MCT) for the multilane model within the umbilic subspace and test its predictions. Unlike in the bidirectional two-lane model with an umbilic point studied earlier, here we find a robust $z=3/2$ dynamical exponent for the umbilic mode. The umbilic scaling function, obtained from Monte-Carlo simulations, for the simplest 3-lane scenario, appears to have an universal shape for a range of interaction parameters. Remarkably, the shape and dynamic exponent of the non-degenerate mode can be analytically predicted on the base of effective MCT, up to non-universal scaling factor. Our findings suggest the existence of novel universality classes with dynamical exponent $3/2$, appearing in long-lived hydrodynamic modes with equal characteristic velocities.

We examine the formulas commonly used to estimate current-induced spin-orbit torques from harmonic Hall voltage measurements. In particular, we focus on the factor of two discrepancy among expressions employed to fit harmonic Hall signals measured under an in-plane rotating magnetic field. By explicitly deriving the relevant relations, we clarify the origin of this discrepancy and present the correct form of the fitting formula. We further discuss the determination of the sign of the field-like torque from harmonic Hall voltage measurements, which depends on the assumed form of the current-induced torques.

Long-range interactions and electric response are essential for accurate modeling of condensed-phase systems, but capturing them efficiently remains a challenge for atomistic machine learning. Traditionally, these two phenomena can be represented by static charges, that participate in Coulomb interactions between atoms, and dynamic charges such as atomic polar tensors - aka Born effective charges - describing the response to an external electric field. We critically compare different approaches to learn both types of charges, taking bulk water and water clusters as paradigmatic examples: (1) Learning them independently; (2) Coupling static and dynamic charges based on their physical relationship with a single global coupling constant to account for dielectric screening; (3) Coupled learning with a local, environment-dependent screening factor. In the coupled case, correcting for dielectric screening is essential, yet the common assumption of homogeneous, isotropic screening breaks down in heterogeneous systems such as water clusters. A learned, environment-dependent screening restores high accuracy for the dynamical charges. However, the accuracy gain over independent dynamic predictions is negligible, while the computational cost increases compared to using separate models for static and dynamical charges. This suggests that, despite the formal connection between the two charge types, modeling them independently is the more practical choice for both condensed-phase and isolated cluster systems.

Functionally graded materials (FGMs) exhibit continuous property variations that enable unique functionalities and provide efficient platforms for systematic property optimization. Here, we report the fabrication of FGMs with graded structural heterogeneity by annealing an amorphous metal under a one-dimensional temperature gradient. Using lock-in thermography (LIT), we spatially mapped transverse thermoelectric conversion with high spatial and temperature resolution. A pronounced non-monotonic response was observed, with the maximum anomalous Ettingshausen effect, transverse charge-to-heat conversion in magnetic materials, appearing in the atomic-heterogeneity regime well before crystallization. This enhancement was not captured by conventional structural or longitudinal transport measurements, highlighting the exceptional sensitivity of transverse thermoelectric phenomena to subtle structural heterogeneity. Structural analyses using scanning transmission electron microscopy and atom probe tomography revealed Fe-based crystalline alloys and Cu nanoclusters embedded in the amorphous matrix, whose heterogeneity accounts for the enhanced response. These findings establish temperature-gradient-annealed FGMs, combined with LIT, as a powerful methodology for probing structural-heterogeneity-driven transverse electron transport and designing high-performance flexible materials.

Non-Hermitian skin effects are conventionally manifested as boundary localization of eigenstates in linear systems. In nonlinear settings, however, where eigenstates are no longer well defined, it becomes unclear how skin effects should be faithfully characterized. Here, we propose a Koopman-based characterization of nonlinear skin effects, in which localization is defined in terms of Koopman eigenfunctions in a lifted observable space, rather than physical states. Using a minimal nonlinear extension of the Hatano-Nelson model, we show that dominant Koopman eigenfunctions localize sharply on higher-order observables, in stark contrast to linear skin effects confined to linear observables. This lifted-space localization governs the sensitivity to boundary amplitude perturbations, providing a distinct dynamical signature of the nonlinear skin effect. Our results establish the Koopman framework as a natural setting in which skin effects unique to nonlinear non-Hermitian systems can be identified.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究通过SABRE技术结合NMR、交换模型拟合和DFT计算，揭示了氢化物分子内交换、新型稳定复合物发现以及Na+在铱-丙酮酸结合中的关键作用，重塑了对SABRE机制的理解。

Signal amplification by reversible exchange (SABRE) is a nuclear spin hyperpolarization technique in which the transient interaction of parahydrogen (pH2) and a target substrate with an iridium complex leads to polarization transfer to the substrate. Here, we use a parahydrogen-enhanced, spin-selective NMR method to investigate pyruvate binding, which is combined with exchange-model fitting and DFT calculations. Our study reveals several key findings that reshape the current understanding of SABRE: (a) intramolecular hydrogen exchange of the hydrides, occurring faster than pyruvate or H2 loss; (b) the discovery of a novel stable H2-IrImes-DMSO2-pyruvate complex; and (c) the crucial role of counterions, here Na+, in Ir-pyruvate binding. Previously unknown insights into complex kinetics and distributions as a function of temperature, [DMSO], [pyruvate], and hydrogen pressure are presented. The methods demonstrated here, exemplified by SABRE, provide a framework that is expected to guide future research in the field.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文提出了一种多尺度方法，结合第一性原理计算和宏观器件模型来评估钙钛矿太阳能电池性能，重点关注MAPbI3相变对光电性能的影响。

This paper presents a first step toward a pragmatic phenomenological multiscale approach to evaluate perovskite solar cell performance which determines material properties at the atomistic scale with first-principles calculations, and applies them in macro-scale device models. This work focuses on the MAPbI3 (MA = CH3NH3) perovskite and how its phase transitions impact on its optical, electronic, and structural properties which are investigated at the first-principles level. The obtained data are coupled to a numerical drift-diffusion device model enabling evaluation of the performance of corresponding single junction devices. The first-principles simulation applies a hybrid exchange-correlation functional adapted to the studied family of compounds. Validation by available experimental data is presented from materials properties to device performance, justifying the use of the approach for predictive evaluation of existing and novel perovskites. The coupling between atomistic and device models is described in terms of a framework for exchange of optical and electronic parameters between the two scales. The obtained results are systematically discussed in terms of first-principles levels of approximation performances.

- **TL;DR**: 通过WTe2/FGT异质结中的Berry曲率偶极子效应，实现了电流对反常霍尔效应的可逆调控，调制幅度超过180%

We demonstrate robust and reversible electric-current control of the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in a two-dimensional WTe2/Fe3GeTe2 (FGT) stack. Applying a current through Td-WTe2 leads to a giant modulation of the AHE of the adjacent FGT layer, with the relative change of the AHE conductivity exceeding 180%. Control experiments show that i) the observed effect is absent in pure FGT, ii) the modulation weakens in thicker FGT films, confirming its interfacial origin, and iii) the modulation peaks for bilayer WTe2, indicating that the Berry-curvature dipole (BCD) plays the dominant role in the modulation. We propose that the charge current I generates an out-of-plane magnetization Mz via BCD in WTe2 and Mz modifies the exchange splitting of FGT via the inverse magnetic proximity effect, thereby altering its Berry curvature and nontrivially influencing the AHE. The demonstrated method of AHE control offers new possibilities for magnetism control, i.e., for the study of AHE-transistors as well as electric-current control of quantum magnets, especially magnetic insulators.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文针对传统机器学习力场在长程相互作用系统中的应用限制，提出了包含长程注意力机制的E2Former-LSR模型，并在MolLR25基准上验证了其优越性能。

Machine learning force fields (MLFFs) have revolutionized molecular simulations by providing quantum mechanical accuracy at the speed of molecular mechanical computations. However, a fundamental reliance of these models on fixed-cutoff architectures limits their applicability to macromolecular systems where long-range interactions dominate. We demonstrate that this locality constraint causes force prediction errors to scale monotonically with system size, revealing a critical architectural bottleneck. To overcome this, we establish the systematically designed MolLR25 ({Mol}ecules with {L}ong-{R}ange effect) benchmark up to 1200 atoms, generated using high-fidelity DFT, and introduce E2Former-LSR, an equivariant transformer that explicitly integrates long-range attention blocks. E2Former-LSR exhibits stable error scaling, achieves superior fidelity in capturing non-covalent decay, and maintains precision on complex protein conformations. Crucially, its efficient design provides up to 30% speedup compared to purely local models. This work validates the necessity of non-local architectures for generalizable MLFFs, enabling high-fidelity molecular dynamics for large-scale chemical and biological systems.

- **TL;DR**: 开发基于XGBoost的机器学习模型预测多组分和高熵合金的熔点，通过物理特征工程避免数据泄漏，模型在验证集上达到R²=0.948，并成功捕捉BCC-FCC相变规律。

Predicting the melting temperature (Tm) of multi-component and high-entropy alloys (HEAs) is critical for high-temperature applications but computationally expensive using traditional CALPHAD or DFT methods. In this work, we develop a gradient-boosted decision tree (XGBoost) model to predict Tm for complex alloys based on elemental properties. To ensure physical consistency, we address the issue of data leakage by excluding temperature-dependent thermodynamic descriptors (such as Gibbs free energy of mixing) and instead rely on physically motivated elemental features. The optimized model achieves a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.948 and a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 9928 which is about 5% relative error for HEAs on a validation set of approximately 1300 compositions. Crucially, we validate the model using the Valence Electron Concentration (VEC) rule. Without explicit constraints during training, the model successfully captures the known stability transition between BCC and FCC phases at a VEC of approximately 6.87. These results demonstrate that data-driven models, when properly feature-engineered, can capture fundamental metallurgical principles for rapid alloy screening.

We study the performance of Kitaev-Heisenberg (KH) clusters as working media realizing a quantum Otto engine (QOE). An external Zeeman field with linear time dependency is used as the driving mechanism. The efficiency strongly depends on Kitaev ($κ$) and Heisenberg ($J$) exchange interaction. Interestingly, efficiency is comparable when the relative magnitude of $κ$ and $J$ is the same but of opposite signs. The above results are explained due to a subtle interplay of frustration, quantum fluctuation, and duality of eigen-spectra for the KH system when both the signs of $κ$ and $J$ are reversed. The maximum efficiency is shown to be dynamically related to eigen-spectra forming discrete narrow bands, where total spin angular momentum becomes a good quantum number. We relate this optimum efficiency to the realization of weakly interacting magnons, where the system reduces to an approximate eigen-system of the external drive. Finally, we extend our study to the large spin Kitaev model and find a quantum advantage in efficiency for $S=1/2$. The results could be of practical interest for materials with KH interactions as a platform for QOE.

Two-frequency (two-color) laser fields provide a powerful and flexible means for steering molecular dynamics. However, quantitatively reliable and scalable theoretical tools for simulating laser-driven nonadiabatic processes under such fields remain limited. Here, we develop a two-mode Floquet fewest switches surface hopping (two-mode F-FSSH) approach for two-frequency driving within a mixed quantum-classical framework. We validate the algorithm on three driven one-dimensional two-state models: a Rabi model and two avoided-crossing scattering models. The electronic and nuclear dynamics are benchmarked against numerically exact results from split-operator calculations, showing good agreement across a broad range of field parameters and initial conditions. These results establish two-mode F-FSSH as a practical framework for simulating and designing two-frequency control protocols and motivate extensions to more realistic experimental settings.

- **TL;DR**: 基于工业级300mm硅MOS工艺的单电子源实现了0.008 ppm的超低错误率，满足SI安培标准，为可扩展的电流标准提供了新途径。

Although the measurement of current is now defined with respect to the electronic charge, producing a current standard based on a single-electron source remains challenging. The error rate of a source must be below 0.01 ppm, and many such sources must be operated in parallel to provide practically useful values of current in the nanoampere range. Achieving a single electron source using an industrial grade 300 mm wafer silicon metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) process could offer a powerful route for scaling, combined with the ability for integration with control and measurement electronics. Here, we present measurements of such a single-electron source indicating an error rate of 0.008 ppm, below the error threshold to satisfy the SI Ampere, and one of the lowest error rates reported, implemented using a gate-defined quantum dot device fabricated on an industry-grade silicon MOS process. Further evidence supporting the accuracy of the device is obtained by comparing the device performance to established models of quantum tunnelling, which reveal the mechanism of operation of our source at the single particle level. The low error rate observed in this device motivates the development of scaled arrays of parallel sources utilising Si MOS devices to realise a new generation of metrologically accurate current standards.

Accurately modeling quantum dissipative dynamics remains challenging due to environmental complexity and non-Markovian memory effects. Although machine learning provides a promising alternative to conventional simulation techniques, most existing models employ real-valued neural networks (RVNNs) that inherently mismatch the complex-valued nature of quantum mechanics. By decoupling the real and imaginary parts of the density matrix, RVNNs can obscure essential amplitude-phase correlations, compromising physical consistency. Here, we introduce complex-valued neural networks (CVNNs) as a physics-consistent framework for learning quantum dissipative dynamics. CVNNs operate directly on complex-valued inputs, preserve the algebraic structure of quantum states, and naturally encode quantum coherences. Through numerical benchmarks on the spin-boson model and several variants of the Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex, we demonstrate that CVNNs outperform RVNNs in convergence speed, training stability, and physical fidelity -- including significantly improved trace conservation and Hermiticity. These advantages increase with system size and coherence complexity, establishing CVNNs as a robust, scalable, quantum-aware classical approach for simulating open quantum systems in the pre-fault-tolerant quantum era.

Microscopic and dynamic control over quantum states is essential for bridging fundamental studies of material properties to device function. Realizing such control at combined high spatial resolution and ultrafast temporal precision remains a major challenge. Here, we demonstrate femtosecond laser-driven patterning of topological quantum states in the Weyl semimetal WTe2. By engineering the excitation field into a transient optical grating, we spatially selectively and reversibly drive phase transitions between the topological Td and topologically trivial 1T* phases. Using ultrafast transmission electron microscopy, we directly visualize the formation of a periodic Td/1T* heterostructure, observe the propagation of a phase front, and analyze nanoscale confinement of coherently excited optical phonon modes. Our findings establish a platform for all-optical, spatially programmable, and reconfigurable control of quantum states, paving the way for optically addressable topological devices.

In this work, we propose a scheme to realize the layer Hall effect in the ferromagnetic topological insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$ via proximity to $d$-wave altermagnets. We show that an altermagnet and an in-plane magnetic field applied near one surface gap the corresponding Dirac cone, yielding an altermagnet-induced half-quantized Hall effect. When altermagnets with antiparallel Néel vectors are placed near the top and bottom surfaces, giving rise to the layer Hall effect with vanishing net Hall conductance, i.e., the altermagnet-induced layer Hall effect. In contrast, altermagnets with parallel Néel vectors lead to a quantized Chern insulating state, i.e., the altermagnet-induced anomalous Hall effect. We further analyze the dependence of the Hall conductance on the orientation of the in-plane magnetic field and demonstrate that the layer Hall effect becomes observable under a perpendicular electric field. Our results establish a route to engineer altermagnet-induced topological phases in ferromagnetic topological insulators.

Fromager and Lasorne [Electron. Struct. 6 025002 (2024)] have recently derived an in-principle exact Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KS-DFT) of electrons and nuclei, where the nuclear density and the (so-called conditional) electronic density are mapped onto a fictitious electronically non-interacting KS molecule. In this work, we apply the exact factorization formalism to the molecular KS wavefunction, thus leading to disentangled (but coupled) marginal and conditional KS equations. We show that, while being equivalent to the original theory, these equations open new perspectives in the practical extension of regular (electronic) KS-DFT beyond the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. The importance and treatment of correlations induced in this context by second-order geometrical derivatives is also discussed.

Griffith thermodynamic energy balance is employed to analyze cleavage phenomenon from atomic level. Results show that the cleavage toughness, the strain energy release rate, and the surface energy can be defined by the bond strength (the appropriate elastic modulus ) and the bond density. Such simple definition of fracture parameters is different from Irwin ones. This appropriate elastic modulus of single crystals is obtained using the complex variable function method. The calculated results of cleavage toughness and surface energy of typical ionic and covalent crystals by the present formulae are in excellent agreement with the experimental values. It demonstrates that our method offers a concise tool for predicting the cleavage toughness, the energy release rate and the surface energy of crystal cleavage planes.

- **TL;DR**: 在硅/硅锗量子点器件中实现T型交叉结构，实现电子在二维网格中的可控路由传输，为可扩展量子计算架构奠定基础

Conveyor-mode shuttling in gated Si/SiGe devices enables adiabatic transfer of single electrons, electron patterns and spin qubits confined in quantum dots across several microns with a scalable number of signal lines. To realize their full potential, linear shuttle lanes must connect into a two-dimensional grid with controllable routing. We introduce a T-junction device linking two independently driven shuttle lanes. Electron routing across the junction requires no extra control lines beyond the four channels per conveyor belt. We measure an inter-lane charge transfer fidelity of $F = 100.0000000^{+0}_{-9\times 10^{-7}}\,\%$ at an instantaneous electron velocity of $270\,\mathrm{mm}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. The filling of 54 quantum dots is controlled by simple atomic pulses, allowing us to swap electron patterns, laying the groundwork for a native spin-qubit SWAP gate. This T-junction establishes a path towards scalable, two-dimensional quantum computing architectures with flexible spin qubit routing for quantum error correction.

We employ molecular dynamics simulations and quantum rate theories to elucidate the complex condensed-phase dynamics underpinning triplet-state formation in organic photosensitizers. Using models informed by first-principles calculations complete with a molecular representation of solvents of different polarities, we elucidate the interplay of the internal and environmental interactions underlying triplet yield. We find that triplet yields depend sensitively on the dielectric stabilization of the charge transfer intermediate that facilitates a transition into the triplet manifold. Our results illustrate the importance of molecularly detailed models in understanding the excited-state internal charge-transfer dynamics of small organic molecules.

The discovery and design of new materials are paramount in the development of green technologies. High entropy oxides represent one such group that has only been tentatively explored, mainly due to the inherent problem of navigating vast compositional spaces. Thanks to the emergence of machine learning, however, suitable tools are now readily available. Here, the task of finding oxygen carriers for chemical looping processes has been tackled by leveraging active learning-based strategies combined with first-principles calculations. High efficiency and efficacy have, moreover, been achieved by exploiting the power of recently developed machine learning interatomic potentials. Firstly, the proposed approaches were validated based on an established computational framework for identifying high entropy perovskites that can be used in chemical looping air separation and dry reforming. Chief among the insights thus gained was the identification of the best performing strategies, in the form of greedy or Thompson-based sampling based on uncertainty estimates obtained from Gaussian processes. Building on this newfound knowledge, the concept was applied to a more complex problem, namely the discovery of high entropy oxygen carriers for chemical looping oxygen uncoupling. This resulted in both qualitative as well as quantitative outcomes, including lists of specific materials with high oxygen transfer capacities and configurational entropies. Specifically, the best candidates were based on the known oxygen carrier CaMnO3 but also contained a variety of additional species, of which some, e.g., Ti; Co; Cu; and Ti, were expected while others were not, e.g., Y and Sm. The results suggest that adopting active learning approaches is critical in materials discovery, given that these methods are already shifting research practice and soon will be the norm.

Coupled networks of mass-spring resonators have attracted growing attention across multiple fundamental and applied research directions, including reservoir computing for artificial intelligence. This has led to the exploration of platforms capable of tasks such as acoustic-wave classification, smart sensing, predictive maintenance, and adaptive vibration control. This work introduces a multiphysics reservoir based on a two-dimensional network of coupled nonlinear mass-spring resonators. Each mass has a magnetic tunnel junction on top of it, working as spin diode, used as a spintronic read-out. As a proof-of-concept, we have benchmarked this reservoir with the task of vowel-recognition reaching accuracy above 95$\%$. Because the device accepts elastic excitations directly, signal injections are simplified, making it well-suited for realtime sensing and edge computation. We also studied the effect of nonlinearity, demonstrating how it influences the reservoir dynamics, and assessed its robustness under node-to-node variation of the elastic constants.

Controlling the chirality and yield of carbon nanotubes is essential for their diverse applications from macroscopic composites to nanoelectronics. Floating-catalyst chemical vapor deposition is widely employed as a scalable synthesis route, where catalysts inevitably traverse spatially varying environments. However, prevailing interpretations of nanotube growth largely rely on ensemble monitoring or static, post-growth snapshots. Here, we combine digital isotope labeling with programmed temperature modulation to reconstruct the dynamic growth histories of supported individual nanotubes. Growth rates exhibit hysteresis and extraordinary sensitivity to temperature changes, indicating irreversible catalyst coarsening; nevertheless, the nanotube chirality remains robustly preserved across lengths exceeding 300 um. This sharp contrast between kinetic adaptability and structural memory in nanotube growth indicates that chirality control can be established at the nucleation stage, while allowing independent optimization of subsequent elongation. Our findings further call for a re-examination of static interpretations of diameter-determination mechanisms derived from post-growth snapshots.

To facilitate rational molecular and materials design, this research proposes an integrated computational framework that combines stochastic simulation, ab initio quantum chemistry, and molecular docking. The suggested workflow allows systematic investigation of structural stability, binding affinity, and electronic properties across biological and materials science domains by utilizing complementary tools like Avogadro for molecular construction and visualization, AutoDock for docking and interaction analysis, and ORCA for high-level electronic structure computations. Uncertainty, configurational sampling, and optimization in high-dimensional chemical spaces are addressed by combining Monte Carlo-based and annealing-inspired techniques. The work shows how materials science ideas such as polymer design, thin films, crystalline lattices, and bioelectronic systems can be applied to drug development. On-device, open-source computational methods are viable, scalable, and economical, as demonstrated by comparative platform analysis. All things considered, the findings highlight the need of an integrated, repeatable computational pipeline for speeding up de novo molecule assembly and materials architecture while lowering experimental risk and expense.

The magneto-optical properties of a Zn$_{0.99}$Mn$_{0.01}$Se/Be$_{0.93}$Mn$_{0.07} $Te diluted magnetic semiconductor heterostructure with type-II band alignment are investigated at cryogenic temperatures down to 16 mK. The temperature of the Mn spin system, which at the lowest possible laser power reaches 270 mK, is evaluated from the giant Zeeman splitting of the direct exciton in the Zn$_{0.99}$Mn$_{0.01}$Se layers subject to an external magnetic field. The degree of circular polarization of the direct and indirect optical transitions, induced by the magnetic field, is a sensitive indicator for the laser heating of the Mn spin system. Evidence of spin glass formation in the Mn spin system of the Be$_{0.93}$Mn$_{0.07}$Te layers with the critical temperature of $T_{SG}=400$ mK is found.
