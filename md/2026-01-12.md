- **TL;DR**: 提出基于物理启发的自适应强化学习框架，用于自主识别伊辛模型的临界温度和临界指数，性能优于传统方法

Traditional methods for determining critical parameters are often influenced by human factors. This research introduces a physics-inspired adaptive reinforcement learning framework that enables agents to autonomously interact with physical environments, simultaneously identifying both the critical temperature and various types of critical exponents in the Ising model with precision. Interestingly, our algorithm exhibits search behavior reminiscent of phase transitions, efficiently converging to target parameters regardless of initial conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that this method significantly outperforms traditional approaches, particularly in environments with strong perturbations. This study not only incorporates physical concepts into machine learning to enhance algorithm interpretability but also establishes a new paradigm for scientific exploration, transitioning from manual analysis to autonomous AI discovery.

- **TL;DR**: Verdazyl自由基通常不发光，研究发现这是由于D1和D0态之间存在低能锥形交叉，导致超快非辐射衰变，解释了所有verdazyl衍生物不发光的普遍现象。

Verdazyl radicals are a versatile class of air-stable organic radicals used in various applications, especially for their magnetic properties. Despite the development of a wide range of verdazyl derivatives, however, they are all non-emissive. To investigate the reasons behind this and to understand the excited-state dynamics of verdazyls, we combine steady-state and femtosecond pump-probe spectroscopy with quantum chemical calculations. In the carbazole-substituted 2,4,6-triphenylverdazyl (TPV-Cz) , we observe ultrafast internal conversion of the first excited state on a timescale of 0.5 $\pm$ 0.1 ps, followed by vibrational relaxation with a lifetime of 3.7 $\pm$ 0.4 ps. Spin-flip time-dependent density functional theory calculations reveal that the sub-picosecond non-radiative decay comes from a low-energy conical intersection between the D1 and D0 states, driven by an out-of-plane distortion of the verdazyl ring. This distortion is observed and remains energetically accessible in the isolated verdazyl ring in 2,4,6-triphenylverdazyl and in TPV-Cz. This shows that the conical intersection geometry is a recurring feature across different types of verdazyl derivatives and explains why all verdazyls are non-emissive despite different functionalization. Our results provide a mechanistic understanding of the photophysical properties of verdazyl radicals and offers a pathway for the future design of emissive verdazyl derivatives.

- **TL;DR**: 将路径测度动态重加权方法集成到CP2K软件中，为增强采样模拟提供准确的重加权工具，支持元动力学、不确定性量化和力场优化。

Dynamical reweighting of path measures is a powerful approach for accurately evaluating slow molecular processes using modified potential energy surfaces used in enhanced sampling methods. Integrating this reweighting framework into the CP2K electronic-structure and molecular-dynamics (MD) software package delivers a robust and widely applicable tool for metadynamics, uncertainty quantification, and force-field optimisation based on both \textit{ab initio} and classical MD simulations. Based on the Girsanov theorem for stochastic dynamical systems, the method is adapted to the Bussi-Donadio-Parrinello velocity-rescaling scheme. This scheme is accessible through the CSVR thermostat and can be interpreted as a Langevin OVRVO/OBABO update scheme requiring two random numbers per integration step. Comprehensive implementation details are provided, including a complete overview of the modified CP2K modules involved in the MD cycle and the computation of reweighting factors. The framework supports multiple sources of bias potentials, enabling reweighting via the PLUMED interface or CP2K-native external potentials and restraints. The feasibility of the implementation is demonstrated through rerun benchmarks, dynamical reweighting of Markov state models (MSMs) and computation of transport properties based on CP2K trajectories, showing excellent agreement with reference simulations.

- **TL;DR**: 合成并表征了新型层状材料CrGe1-xSe3+y，其具有双Kagome铬原子层结构，表现出50K以下的反铁磁有序，而非类似CrGeTe3的铁磁性

We report the synthesis and properties of a new layered material, CrGe1-xSe3+y. The crystal structure was determined by using single crystal x-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. CrGe1-xSe3+y crystallizes with a space group R-3m, featuring a double Kagome layer of chromium atoms, sandwiched between disordered Ge-Se layers. This compound displays antiferromagnetic order below 50 K, unlike the ferromagnetic behavior in CrGeTe3. Chromium displays an effective moment of ~3.9 μB/Cr, consistent with Cr3+ oxidation. The presence of this phase limits the possibility of a ferromagnetic CrGeSe3 analogous to CrGeTe3.

### Giant and Oscillatory Junction Magnetoresistance via RKKY-like Spin Coupling in Spin-Gapless Mn$_2$CoAl/SiO$_2$/p-Si Heterostructures

- **TL;DR**: 该论文报道了在Mn₂CoAl/天然SiO₂/p-Si异质结构中实现了自旋选择性输运和异常大的正结磁阻，展示了室温下自旋选择性输运的稳健平台。

Here, we report spin-selective transport and exceptionally large positive junction magnetoresistance (JMR) in sputter-deposited Mn$_2$CoAl/native-SiO$_2$/p-Si heterostructures. Highly ordered inverse-Heusler Mn$_2$CoAl thin films with near-ideal XA chemical ordering ($S \approx 0.97$) and a Curie temperature of $\sim \SI{590}{\kelvin}$ are realized using a magnetron sputtering process. The spin-gapless semiconducting nature of Mn$_2$CoAl is experimentally supported by a weakly temperature-dependent resistivity with a very small negative temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR $\approx -4.2 \times 10^{-9}$~$\si{\ohm\meter\per\kelvin}$) and a nonsaturating linear magnetoresistance over a wide range of magnetic fields and temperatures.
  A giant positive JMR of $\sim \SI{825}{\percent}$ at \SI{10}{\kelvin} and $\sim \SI{134}{\percent}$ at room temperature is observed despite the presence of only a single ferromagnetic electrode. Systematic variation of the SiO$_2$ tunnel barrier thickness reveals a reproducible oscillatory sign reversal of the JMR accompanied by a monotonic decay in magnitude. This behavior reflects thickness-dependent modulation of spin-selective tunneling mediated by phase-coherent interfacial carriers and can be described phenomenologically by an RKKY-like functional form without invoking conventional metallic exchange interactions. These results identify Mn$_2$CoAl/native-SiO$_2$/p-Si heterostructures as robust and scalable platforms for room-temperature spin-selective transport, with potential applications in semiconductor-compatible spin filters, magnetic field sensors, and reconfigurable spintronic logic elements.

We establish a remarkably rich ground state phase diagram in the maple-leaf lattice spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet as a function of the three symmetry-inequivalent nearest-neighbor bonds using exact diagonalization and tower-of-states analysis on clusters up to $N=36$ sites. Besides a hexagonal plaquette state, a star-shaped valence bond solid state is discovered in close vicinity to the (canted) $120^\circ$ magnetic phase, strongly reminiscent of a de-confined critical point or Dirac spin liquid scenario on the triangular lattice antiferromagnets. Moreover, an exact dimer product-state is observed next to a collinear Néel-state, similar to the Shastry-Sutherland model. All identified phases compete in a parameter regime close to the isotropic point, providing a promising region for spin liquids to emerge. By analyzing Gutzwiller-projected wave-functions we identify a sliver of parameter regime where a gapped $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ spin liquid Ansatz is in astonishing agreement with the exact $N=36$ ground state. This rich competition of paramagnetic phases demonstrates that the maple-leaf antiferromagnet is a promising platform for exotic states of matter and quantum critical phenomena.

- **TL;DR**: 利用原子探针层析和透射电镜分析超导量子比特用Nb和Ta/Nb薄膜中氧在晶界的分布与偏析，发现晶粒内部氧浓度越高，晶界氧偏析越严重，且氧浓度升高会抑制超导临界温度。

We report on atomic-scale analyses of oxygen distribution and segregation at grain boundaries (GBs) of Nb and Ta-encapsulated Nb (Ta/Nb) thin films for superconducting qubits using atom-probe tomography (APT) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). We observe oxygen segregation at grain boundaries (GBs) relative to the oxygen concentration within the grains for both Nb and Ta-capped Nb thin films for superconducting qubits and find that higher oxygen concentration in the interior of Nb grains lead to greater oxygen segregation levels at GBs. This finding emphasizes that controlling oxygen impurities in Nb during film deposition and fabrication processing is important to reduce the level of oxygen segregation at GBs in Nb. The enrichment factor (Cgb/Cgrain) for oxygen segregation at GBs in Nb is 2.7 (error bar: 0.3) for Nb films, and Ta-capped Nb thin films exhibit slightly reduced Nb GB enrichment factors of 2.3 (error bar: 0.3) while GBs in the Ta capping layer itself possess higher enrichment factors of 3.0 (error bar: 0.3). We hypothesize that the Ta capping layer can trap oxygen and thereby affect oxygen in-diffusion and segregation at GBs in the underlying Nb thin films. Finally, we find that increases in the oxygen concentration in both Nb grains and GBs correlate with a suppression in the critical temperature for superconductivity (Tc). Together, our comparative chemical and charge transport property analyses provide atomic-scale insights into a potential mechanism contributing to decoherence in superconducting qubits.

### Stray Field NMR: a powerful method to measure dynamics at the millisecond scale

- **TL;DR**: 该论文提出了一种基于STRAFI（永久磁场梯度）的稳健扩散NMR方法，用于测量从微秒到秒级时间尺度的自扩散系数，解决了传统PFG-NMR时间窗口受限的问题。

Transport properties in fluids and confined systems play a central role across a wide range of natural and technological contexts, from geology and environmental sciences to biology, energy storage, and membrane-based separation processes. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) provides a unique, non-destructive means to probe these properties through species-selective measurements of self-diffusion coefficients. While pulsed field gradient NMR (PFG-NMR) is routinely used, its access to diffusion times is typically limited to values no shorter than about 10 ms, restricting its applicability to systems with fast dynamics and long relaxation times. Diffusion NMR in a permanent magnetic field gradient (STRAFI) offers a complementary, multiscale approach, enabling diffusion measurements over an extended temporal window, from a few hundred microseconds to several tens of seconds. Despite its strong potential, this technique remains rarely implemented due to experimental and methodological challenges. In this work, we present a robust and versatile STRAFI-based methodology, including a specifically designed experimental setup, optimized pulse sequences, and rigorous data analysis, allowing accurate extraction of self-diffusion coefficients for a broad range of nuclei. The capabilities of the approach are illustrated through diverse applications, including the study of concentrated electrolytes using "NMR-exotic" nuclei ($^{35}$Cl, $^{79}$Br/$^{81}$Br, $^{127}$I, $^{17}$O) and the characterization of micrometre-scale porosity in membranes.

- **TL;DR**: 通过DFT计算研究六种FCC金属中堆垛层错能量对法向应力的敏感性，发现压缩增加层错能而拉伸降低层错能，多数经典势函数无法正确预测这一效应。

Plastic deformation and fracture of FCC metals involve the formation of stable or unstable stacking faults (SFs) on (111) plane. Examples include dislocation cross-slip and dislocation nucleation at interfaces and near crack tips. The stress component normal to (111) plane can strongly affect the SF energy when the stress magnitude reaches several to tens of GPa. We conduct a series of DFT calculations of SF energies in six FCC metals: Al, Ni, Cu, Ag, Au, and Pt. The results show that normal compression significantly increases the stable and unstable SF energies in all six metals, while normal tension decreases them. The SF formation is accompanied by inelastic expansion in the normal direction. The DFT calculations are compared with predictions of several representative classical and machine-learning interatomic potentials. Many potentials fail to capture the correct stress effect on the SF energy, often predicting trends opposite to the DFT calculations. Possible ways to improve the ability of potentials to represent the stress effect on SF energy are discussed.

- **TL;DR**: 硅量子点互连中的一维电子通道表现出强库仑相互作用，实现Luttinger液体物理，存在Wigner-Friedel交叉现象，可用于长距离量子纠缠。

Coherent interconnects between gate-defined silicon quantum processing units are essential for scalable quantum computation and long-range entanglement. We argue that one-dimensional electron channels formed in the silicon quantum well of a Si/SiGe heterostructure exhibit strong Coulomb interactions and realize strongly interacting Luttinger liquid physics. At low electron densities, the system enters a Wigner regime characterized by dominant 4kF correlations; increasing the electron density leads to a crossover from the Wigner regime to a Friedel regime with dominant 2kF correlations. We support these results through large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations of the interacting ground state under both screened and unscreened Coulomb potentials. We propose experimental signatures of the Wigner-Friedel crossover via charge transport and charge sensing in both zero- and high-magnetic field limits. We also analyze the impact of short-range correlated disorder - including random alloy fluctuations and valley splitting variations - and identify that the Wigner-Friedel crossover remains robust until disorder levels of about 400 micro eV. Finally, we show that the Wigner regime enables long-range capacitive coupling between quantum dots across the interconnect, suggesting a route to create long-range entanglement between solid-state qubits. Our results position silicon interconnects as a platform for studying Luttinger liquid physics and for enabling architectures supporting nonlocal quantum error correction and quantum simulation.

- **TL;DR**: 通过变分态分析带几何对二维维格纳晶体的影响，发现低电子密度下增加贝里曲率会驱动向自旋三重态配对晶体的转变，该配对具有相对轨道角动量m=-1。

We have used variational states to analyze the effects of band geometry on the two-dimensional Wigner crystal with one and two electrons per unit cell. At sufficiently low electron densities, we find that increasing Berry curvature drives a transition into a crystalline state composed of spin-triplet pairs carrying relative orbital angular momentum $m=-1$. The essential features of this transition are captured by an effective two-electron quantum dot problem in the presence of Berry curvature. Our results point to a purely electronic, strong-coupling mechanism for local spin-triplet pairing in correlated two-dimensional electron systems with quantum geometry.

### Phase-space networks and connectivity of the kagome antiferromagnet

- **TL;DR**: 研究kagome海森堡反铁磁体的共面基态流形，通过相空间网络分析天气风向标环旋转如何影响相空间几何结构

We study the coplanar ground-state manifold of the kagome Heisenberg antiferromagnet using a phase-space network representation, in which nodes correspond to coplanar ground states and edges represent transitions generated by weathervane loop rotations. In the coplanar manifold, each configuration can be mapped to a three-coloring problem on the dual honeycomb lattice, where a weathervane mode corresponds to a closed loop of two alternating colors. By comparing networks that include all weathervane loops with networks restricted to elementary six-spin loops, we examine how energetic constraints shape phase-space structure. We find that connectivity distributions are sharply peaked in large systems, while restrictions to short loops reduce typical connectivity. Spectral properties further distinguish the two cases, with short-loop networks exhibiting Gaussian spectra and full networks displaying non-Gaussian features associated with correlated loop updates. Finally, a box-counting analysis reveals distinct fractal properties of the two networks, demonstrating how energetic constraints control the global geometry of configuration space. These results show that the hierarchy of weathervane loop rotations provides a direct link between microscopic constraints and emergent phase-space geometry in a frustrated magnet.

### Topological Superconductivity in Altermagnetic Heterostructures on a Honeycomb Lattice

Altermagnet-superconductor heterostructures have been shown, in principle, to provide a route towards realising topological superconductivity, and therefore host topologically protected boundary states. In this work we demonstrate that the topological states observed are dependent on the structure of the underlying lattice. By deriving and analysing a model on a honeycomb lattice, we demonstrate that the topological phase diagram has a rich structure containing both chiral edge modes and Majorana corner modes, the latter of which are an indication of higher-order topology. We analyse the effect of disorder on these states and find that whilst the edge modes are robust to a disordered system, any potential observation of the corner modes may be sensitive to the microscopic details. In particular, we show that vacancies can lead to other low energy bound states that may be difficult to distinguish from the corner modes.

### Characterization of Strongly Hyperfine-split Protons by DNP

Dynamic nuclear polarization experiments use microwave irradiation to transfer the larger electron polarization to nuclear spins of interest, and thus enhance the NMR transitions above thermal equilibrium. How the polarization transfer from the electron spin to the nuclear spins in such experiments proceeds and which nuclear spins close to an unpaired electron get polarized and contribute through spin diffusion to the observable bulk nuclear magnetization is not fully understood. We address these questions by combining reverse DNP and band-selective inversion pulses on nuclear spins. We report the electron-detected NMR spectrum of proton spins involved in the direct DNP process in Ox063 trityl samples with protonated and deuterated solvents and variable radical concentrations. We also determine the spin-diffusion barrier surrounding trityl and find that proton spin diffusion is quenched for hyperfine coulings exceding ~250 kHz. This corresponds to a radius of the spin diffusion barrier in the range from 5.4 to 6.8 Å. Burning a hole into the NMR spectrum of proton spins involved in the direct DNP step reveals an electron-electron spin diffusion process imprinted on the proton spectrum. We explain this diffusion process using a three-spin system consisting of two electron spins and one proton and quantify the electron spin diffusion rate constant.

First-order magnetostructural phase transitions underpin giant magnetocaloric effects, yet the microscopic role of lattice dynamics in these transitions remains controversial. Here we use first-principles spin-lattice dynamics simulations to investigate the coupled evolution of magnetization and phonon dispersions across the magnetostructural transition in MnAs. Our simulations quantitatively reproduce the experimentally observed Curie temperature, lattice contraction, and free-energy crossing between hexagonal and orthorhombic phases. We show that below the Curie temperature, magnetic-field-induced hardening of soft phonon modes gives rise to a sizable lattice entropy contribution that enhances the total isothermal entropy change by approximately 23% under a 5 T field. In contrast, the lattice entropy change associated with the structural phase transition itself has an opposite sign and partially compensates the lattice contribution due to field-induced phonon hardening. This competition reconciles long-standing discrepancies in the interpretation of magnetocaloric entropy measurements across first-order transitions. In addition, we demonstrate that the strong magnetic-field dependence of the phonon spectrum near the transition enables large tunability of lattice thermal conductivity, highlighting MnAs as a promising platform for magnetic-field-controlled thermal switching. Our results establish a unified microscopic picture of spin-lattice coupling in first-order magnetocaloric materials and provide design principles for engineering enhanced caloric and thermal transport functionalities.

- **TL;DR**: CrSBr磁性半导体中激子寿命在反铁磁到铁磁相变时从11ps降至7ps，这种磁开关效应源于铁磁相中激子局域化体积增大导致的振子强度增强

Exciton dynamics in layered magnetic semiconductors provide a sensitive probe of the interplay between spin order and light-matter interaction. Here, we study thin CrSBr layers using time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy in an external magnetic field, revealing a step-like reduction in the exciton lifetime from 11 to 7 ps, during the magnetization flip from the antiferromagnetic to the ferromagnetic phase. The reduction of the exciton lifetime in the ferromagnetic phase persists below the Néel temperature, as evidenced by its strong magnetic-field dependence that disappears in the paramagnetic phase. Ab initio calculations reveal a one-dimensional nature of free excitons accompanied by a pronounced change in the oscillator strength across the magnetic phase transition predicting a shorter radiative lifetime of free excitons in the antiferromagnetic phase of CrSBr contradicting the experimental observations. This discrepancy is explained by strong localization of excitons at low tempature. We show both experimentally and theoretically that the observed magnetic switching of the exciton lifetime is attributed to a larger exciton localization volume leading to a larger oscillator strength in the ferromagnetic phase. The results show that disorder-induced localization effects play a key role in exciton dynamics in CrSBr.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究开发了一种基于CaRuO3/La2/3Ca1/3MnO3/CaRuO3异质结构的对称性工程平台，实现了对平面内反常霍尔效应（IP-AHE）的确定性可逆控制。

The family of Hall effects has long served as a premier probe of how symmetry, magnetic order, and topology intertwine in solids. Recently, the in-plane anomalous Hall effect (IP-AHE), a transverse Hall response driven by in-plane magnetization, has emerged as a distinct member of this family, offering innovative spintronic functionalities and illuminating intricate interplay between mirror-symmetry breaking and in-plane magnetic order. However, practical routes to deterministically and reversibly control IP-AHE remain limited. Here, we establish a symmetry-engineered IP-AHE platform, CaRuO3/La2/3Ca1/3MnO3/CaRuO3 heterostructure on NdGaO3(110), that turns strict mirror-symmetry breaking constraints into effective tuning knobs. IP-AHE in these epitaxial trilayers unambiguously couples to the CaRuO3-buffer-induced mirror-symmetry breaking and faithfully reproduces the ferromagnetic hysteresis. Ionic liquid gating further enables reversible reconfigurations of the symmetry breaking, thereby achieving electrical modulation and ON/OFF switching of IP-AHE.

We derive an exact Volterra series expansion for a mean field of an interacting particle system subject to a potential perturbation, expressing the Volterra expansion kernels in terms of the field's response functions, to any order. Applying this formalism to the mean particle density of a simple fluid, we identify a form reminiscent of dynamical density functional theory, with, however, fundamental differences: A nonlocal mobility kernel appears, and forces derive from a functional of the {\it history} of mean density. The equilibrium density functional is shown to be recovered in the limit of slowly varying perturbation. We identify a freedom in deriving this expansion, which allows different forms of mobility kernels. These developments allow for a systematic improvement of established mean field formalisms.

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are a central tool in science and engineering enabling the study of dynamical behavior and the link between microscopic structure and macroscopic function. Their high computational cost, however, has motivated extensive efforts to develop accelerated alternatives. A promising approach is the use of machine-learning-based simulators that allow for substantially larger time steps than conventional MD. Among these, graph neural network (GNN)-based methods have been found to be especially attractive given that they naturally encode the inductive bias of interacting particle systems, however current architectures remain limited in accuracy and stability. In particular, standard message-passing schemes struggle to efficiently propagate long-range information. Here, we investigate whether spectral-GNN simulators can overcome these limitations by explicitly representing a simulated system in a global eigenmode basis, and therefore better capture long-range and collective behavior. Focusing on disordered elastic networks, model systems for complex materials and biological structures such as proteins, we compare spatial, linear spectral, and nonlinear spectral GNN architectures. We find that while spectral representations alone are not sufficient, nonlinear spectral models substantially outperform alternatives. By learning both the time-dependent dynamics and the mixing of eigenmodes, these models more accurately capture the system's slow, global modes, which dominate macroscopic behavior. This leads to a marked reduction in systematic particle-position error and significantly improved prediction of global physical properties.

Controlling mesoscale and nanoscale material structures and properties through self-organized atomic behavior is essential for atomic-scale manufacturing. However, direct and visual studies on the cross-scale effects of such atomic self-organization on mesoscopic structures remain scarce. Here, we report the intertwined atomic-nanoscale-mesoscale structures via the intralayer Fe-chains in the sandwich-like layered FePd2Te2 crystal by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The hierarchical orthogonal corrugated morphologies are directly revealed and attributed to its chain-orientation-determined twinning-domain effect. Both Fe-chains of middle-sublayer and two kinds of Te atoms of top-sublayer are further atomically resolved at the sub-Å level, indicating the critical effects of Pd-atoms/voids on the intra-layer anisotropic Fe-chains and the interlayer structural alignment. The thermal-induced and strain-related structural transitions of surface layer are further investigated and discussed based on the proposed filling model of Pd-voids by the intralayer Pd-atoms. Our work not only provides deep understanding of this exotic layered magnetic material, and will inspire more perspectives for tailoring its anisotropic atomic-to-mesoscale structures and properties.

- **TL;DR**: 提出一种无滤波器的NDIR气体传感方法，采用逆设计的多峰热发射器，打破传统传感器中灵敏度与选择性的权衡。

In applications such as atmospheric monitoring of greenhouse gases and pollutants, the detection and identification of trace concentrations of harmful gases is commonly achieved using non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) sensors. These devices employ a broadband infrared emitter, thermopile detector, and a spectrally selective bandpass filter tuned to the vibrational resonance of the target analyte. However, the fabrication of these filters is costly and limited to a single frequency. This limitation introduces a fundamental tradeoff, as broadening the optical passband width enhances sensitivity but compromises selectivity, whereas narrowing improves selectivity at the expense of sensitivity. In this work, we validate a filterless NDIR approach using a multi-peak thermal emitter developed through inverse design. This emitter enhances detection sensitivity by targeting multiple absorption bands, demonstrated through the creation of a sensor designed for the C-H vibrational modes of propane. Additionally, a set of single-peak emitters were developed to showcase the capability of designing highly selective sensors operating within close spectral proximity. These emitters, targeting the stretching modes of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, exhibit Q-factors above 50 and minimal crosstalk, enabling accurate detection of the target gas without interference from gases with spectrally adjacent absorption bands. This is enabled by the implementation of an aperiodic distributed Bragg reflectors, which allows for higher Q-factors with fewer layers than a periodic Bragg reflector using the same materials and number of layers, thereby reducing fabrication complexity and cost. Experimental results validate that this approach breaks the tradeoff between sensitivity and selectivity. This work highlights the potential of optimized thermal emitters for more efficient and compact gas sensing applications.

In thermodynamics, volume is an essential extensive variable. Strain-line, area, or volume change-therefore offers a direct window into correlated quantum matter: tiny length changes ΔL track how the lattice responds when state variables such as magnetic field H and/or temperature T are varied, revealing phases, transitions, and dynamics. Direct, high-precision strain measurements are already difficult; their susceptibilities are harder still. Very recently, several direct techniques have made vital progress on two key quantities: the magnetostrictive coefficient dλ/dH (often denoted qijk or dij in the magnetostriction literatures), and the linear thermal-expansion coefficient α= dλ/dT. Considering these two strain susceptibilities together-they are fundamental and complementary-clarifies why these thermodynamic properties merit renewed attention.

- **TL;DR**: 三维经典Z₂晶格规范理论在解禁闭相中具有指数级缓慢的弛豫动力学，源于熵效应而非能量势垒，形成鲁棒的有限温度经典存储器

Symmetry-breaking order at low temperatures is often accompanied by slow relaxation dynamics, due to diverging free-energy barriers arising from interfaces between different ordered states. Here, we extend this correspondence to classical topological order, where the ordered states are locally indistinguishable, so there is no notion of interfaces between them. We study the relaxation dynamics of the three-dimensional (3D) classical $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory (LGT) as a canonical example. We prove a lower bound on the mixing time in the deconfined phase, $t_{\text{mix}} = \exp [Ω(L)]$, where L is the linear system size. This bound applies even in the presence of perturbations that explicitly break the one-form symmetry between different long-lived states. This perturbation destroys the energy barriers between ordered states, but we show that entropic effects nevertheless lead to diverging free-energy barriers at nonzero temperature. Our proof establishes the LGT as a robust finite-temperature classical memory. We further prove that entropic effects lead to an emergent one-form symmetry, via a notion that we make precise. We argue that the exponential mixing time follows from universal properties of the deconfined phase, and numerically corroborate this expectation by exploring mixing time scales at the Higgs and confinement transitions out of the deconfined phase. These transitions are found to exhibit markedly different dynamic scaling, even though both have the static critical exponents of the 3D Ising model. We expect this novel entropic mechanism for memory and emergent symmetry to also bring insight into self-correcting quantum memories.

### Rotational Coherence Dominates Early-Time Dynamics and Produces Long-Time Revivals in the S2 State of Azulene

The ultrafast dynamics of azulene have been debated for decades, with reported picosecond decay constants variously attributed to intramolecular vibrational redistribution (IVR), internal conversion, or rotational dephasing. Using polarization and femtosecond time-resolved Resonance Enhanced Multi-photon Ionization Spectroscopy with a nanosecond delay window, we disentangle this long-standing inconsistency and show that the early 2-5 ps decay component arises entirely from rotational dephasing of an excited-state wavepacket. Identical time constants extracted from the decay of the parallel signal and rise of the perpendicular signal across multiple vibronic origins provide an unambiguous rotational anisotropy signature, eliminating the need for IVR-based interpretations. Extending the measurement window to 1.3 ns reveals well-structured J-type and C-type rotational coherence revivals in S2 azulene on top of the well-documented fluorescence decay, demonstrating that both the short- and long-time dynamics contain information about the coherent rotational dynamics. These results show that azulene, and by extension polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), can sustain structured rotational coherence deep into the nanosecond regime, positioning PAHs as model systems for quantum-coherent wavepacket dynamics and providing a framework for probing coherence, decoherence, and rotational control in electronically rich molecular systems.

- **TL;DR**: 在Weyl半金属TaAs和TaP中发现声子主导的热输运机制，其声子热导率远超电子贡献，打破了传统金属热输运的认知。

In conventional metals, thermal transport is governed by electrons, with phonon contributions often considered negligible. Here, through rigorous first-principles calculations, we uncover a phonon-dominated thermal transport regime in the Weyl semimetals TaAs and TaP. Remarkably, although TaP is metallic, its phonon thermal conductivity ($κ_{\text{ph}}$) reaches as high as 171 Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ at room temperature, surpassing its electronic counterpart by more than a factor of five. This anomalously high $κ_{\text{ph}}$ is enabled by the unique electronic and phononic band structures, characterized by the Weyl nodes near the Fermi level, together with acoustic phonon bunching and a wide frequency gap in the phonon spectrum, which collectively suppress phonon-electron and phonon-phonon scattering processes. Due to the substantial phonon contribution, the derived Lorenz number deviates strongly from the conventional Wiedemann-Franz law. We further show that the significance of phonon thermal transport is universal across topological semimetals. Our work provides deeper insight into thermal transport mechanisms in topological semimetals and extends the scope for discovering materials with high thermal conductivity.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文提出了一种在石墨烯-hBN范德华异质结中通过hBN边界和线缺陷界面工程实现非常规铁电性的新方法，无需石墨烯-hBN或hBN-hBN对齐。

Interfacial interactions in two parallel-stacked hexagonal boron-nitride (hBN) layers facilitate sliding ferroelectricity, enabling novel device functionalities. Additionally, when Bernal or twisted bilayer graphene is aligned with an hBN layer, unconventional ferroelectric behavior was observed, though its precise origin remains unclear. Here, we propose an alternative approach to engineering such an unconventional ferroelectricity in graphene-hBN van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures by creating specific types of hBN boundaries and interfaces. We found that the unconventional ferroelectricity can occur--without the alignments at graphene-hBN or hBN-hBN interfaces--when there are hBN edges or interfaces with line defects. By systematically analyzing the gate dependence of mobile and localized charges, we identified key characteristics of localized states that underlie the observed unconventional ferroelectricity, informing future studies. These findings highlight the complexity of the interfacial interactions in graphene/hBN systems, and demonstrate the potential for defect engineering in vdW heterostructures.

### Molecular Orbital Degeneracy Lifting in a Tetrahedral Cluster System NbSeI

The lifting of degenerate electronic states, in which multiple electronic states share the same energy, is a fundamental issue in the physics of crystalline solids. In real materials, this problem has been extensively studied in transition metal compounds, where various quantum phenomena arise from the spin and orbital degeneracy of the d electrons on individual transition-metal atoms. In contrast, materials containing high-symmetry clusters composed of multiple transition-metal atoms are expected to exhibit more emergent phenomena due to the entanglement of the electronic degrees of freedom across multiple atoms. Here, we report the discovery of two distinct mechanisms of orbital-degeneracy lifting in NbSeI, which comprises Nb4 tetrahedral clusters with molecular orbital degrees of freedom and whose average crystal structure is predicted to host a flat-band metal. Below 106 K, NbSeI is found to be a nonmagnetic molecular orbital-ordered insulator. Above this temperature, the average structure becomes face-centered cubic without any superlattice, while the orbital degeneracy remains lifted by significant local distortions of Nb4 tetrahedra, which may be associated with a molecular orbital-liquid or orbital-frozen state. This noncooperative Jahn-Teller distortion stabilizes a nonmagnetic insulating state above 106 K, in stark contrast to the flat-band metal predicted from the average structure.

### Heterogeneous ice nucleation on model substrates

Ice nucleation is greatly important in areas as diverse as climate change, cryobiology, geology or food industry. Predicting the ability of a substrate to induce the nucleation of ice from supercooled water is a difficult problem. Here, we use molecular simulations to analyse how the ice nucleating ability is affected by the substrate lattice structure and orientation. We focus on different model lattices: simple cubic, body centred cubic and face centred cubic, and assess their ability to induce ice nucleation by calculating nucleation rates. Several orientations are studied for the case of the face centred cubic lattice. Curiously, a hexagonal symmetry does not guarantee a better ice nucleating ability. By comparing the body centred cubic and the cubic lattices we determined that there is a significant role of the underlying crystal plane(s) on ice nucleation. The structure of the liquid layer adjacent to the substrate reveals that more efficient nucleants induce a more structured liquid. The most efficient substrates present a strong sensitivity of their ice nucleating ability to the lattice parameters. Introducing a novel methodological approach, we use Classical Nucleation Theory to estimate the contact angle of the ice nucleus on the studied substrates from the calculated nucleation rates. The method also provides the nucleation free energy barrier height, the kinetic pre-factor and the critical cluster size. The latter is in agreement with the nucleus size obtained through a microscopic analysis of the nucleation trajectories, which supports the validity of Classical Nucleation Theory down to small critical clusters.

- **TL;DR**: 开发自主扫描探针显微镜框架，结合自动AFM/MFM和多目标贝叶斯优化，实现组合材料库的高效探索和结构-性能关系提取

Combinatorial materials libraries are an efficient route to generate large families of candidate compositions, but their impact is often limited by the speed and depth of characterization and by the difficulty of extracting actionable structure-property relations from complex characterization data. Here we develop an autonomous scanning probe microscopy (SPM) framework that integrates automated atomic force and magnetic force microscopy (AFM/MFM) to rapidly explore magnetic and structural properties across combinatorial spread libraries. To enable automated exploration of systems without a clear optimization target, we introduce a combination of a static physics-informed bag-of-features (BoF) representation of measured surface morphology and magnetic structure with multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) to discover the relative significance and robustness of features. The resulting closed-loop workflow selectively samples the compositional gradient and reconstructs feature landscapes consistent with dense grid "ground truth" measurements. The resulting Pareto structure reveals where multiple nanoscale objectives are simultaneously optimized, where trade-offs between roughness, coherence, and magnetic contrast are unavoidable, and how families of compositions cluster into distinct functional regimes, thereby turning multi-feature imaging data into interpretable maps of competing structure-property trends. While demonstrated for Au-Co-Ni and AFM/MFM, the approach is general and can be extended to other combinatorial systems, imaging modalities, and feature sets, illustrating how feature-based MOBO and autonomous SPM can transform microscopy images from static data products into active feedback for real-time, multi-objective materials discovery.

We investigate the Yb valence instabilities in the strongly correlated YbPd compound using resonant X-ray emission spectroscopy under pressure across the charge-ordering (CO) transition. At a low temperature (T = 30 K) in the CO ordered phase, the Yb $4f$ valence remains nearly constant up to a pressure P$_K$ = 1.5 GPa, and then increases gradually at higher pressures. In contrast, at room temperature in the normal phase, an anomalous decrease of the Yb $4f$ valence is observed, without any accompanying structural phase transition. This behavior is corroborated by a systematic pressure dependent decrease of the unit-cell volume. Based on a Birch-Murnaghan analysis, the compressibility indicates hardening of the lattice with applied pressure up to a distinct kink seen at P$_K$ = 1.5 GPa. In contrast, for P $&gt;$ P$_K$, the Yb $4f$ valency saturates and the compressibility reveals a counterintuitive pressure-induced softening. The results show a minimum in the compressibility of YbPd (with $f^{13}$-$f^{14}$ hole-type mixed-valence) and is reminiscent of the maximum in compressibility seen in the $γ$-$α$ first-order isostructural phase transition in cerium (with $f^{0}$-$f^{1}$ electron-type mixed-valence).

SiGe heterostructures integrated with Si via virtual substrate (VS) growth are promising hosts for spin qubits. While VS growth targets plastic relaxation, residual cross-hatch strain inhomogeneity propagates into heterostructure overgrowth. To quantify strain inhomogeneity's influence on interface structure and qubit properties, we measure strained-silicon (s-Si)/Si$_{0.7}$Ge$_{0.3}$ heterostructures on 25 wafers processed via standard commercial chemical vapor deposition. Spatially-aligned images of strain (Raman microscopy) and interface structure (atomic force microscopy and cross-sectional scanning transmission electron microscopy) reveal strain-roughness interplay. A strain-driven surface diffusion model predicts the roughness and its temperature dependence. Measured strains suggest spurious double-dot qubit detunings of 0.1 meV over 100 nm distances may result. Modeling shows that interface roughness (atomic steps), when convolved with alloy disorder, only modestly reduces valley splitting (70$\pm$13 vs. 77$\pm$14 $μ$eV on average). Our findings point to thicker VS buffer layers beneath heterostructures and lower-temperature growth (T $\le$ 700 $^{\circ}$C) to limit roughening.

When subjected to a strong magnetic field, electrons on a two-dimensional lattice acquire a fractal energy spectrum called Hofstadter's butterfly. In addition to its unique recursive structure, the Hofstadter butterfly is intimately linked to non-trivial topological orders, hosting a cascade of ground states characterized by non-zero topological invariants. These states, called Chern insulators, are usually understood as replicas of the ground states of the quantum Hall effect, with electrical and thermal conductances that should be quantized, reflecting their topological order. The Hofstadter butterfly is now commonly observed in van-der-Waals heterostructures-based moiré superlattices. However, its thermal properties, particularly the quantized heat flow expected in the Chern insulators, have not been investigated, potentially questioning their similarity with standard quantum Hall states. Here we probe the heat transport properties of the Hofstadter butterfly, obtained in a graphene~/~hexagonal boron nitride moiré superlattice. We observe a quantized heat flow, uniquely set by the topological invariant, for all investigated states of the Hofstadter butterfly: quantum Hall states, Chern insulators, and even symmetry-broken Chern insulators emerging from strong electronic interactions. Our work firmly establishes the universality of the quantization of heat transport and its intimate link with topology.

Layered honeycomb magnets have garnered significant attention recently for their exotic quantum phenomena due to the potential anisotropic, bond-dependent Kitaev interactions. However, distinguishing the roles of Kitaev interactions and the symmetry-allowed Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) remains challenging, since both mechanisms may lead to similar magnetic excitations and thermal transport properties. To tackle this challenge, using a ferromagnetic honeycomb insulator VI3 as a model system, we systematically study the angular-dependent thermal Hall conductivity Kxy(θ, Φ) with both out-of-plane (θ) and in-plane (Φ) magnetic field rotations. Our results reveal a persistent thermal Hall response for both out-of-plane and in-plane rotating magnetic fields, devoid of the sign-reversal patterns characteristic of Kitaev physics. Instead, quantitative analysis shows that the angular dependent Kxy(θ, Φ) is governed by the projection between the magnetic moment and a tilted DM vector containing both out-of-plane and in-plane components. These results not only establish the DMI-driven topological magnetic excitations as the origin of the thermal Hall response in VI3 but also highlight the angular-dependent thermal Hall effect measurements as an effective approach for distinguishing competing interactions in quantum magnets.

The emergence of altermagnets establishes a new paradigm for multiferroics. Unlike conventional multiferroics relying on direct magnetoelectric coupling, multiferroic altermagnets host a crystal-symmetry-mediated magnetoelectric interaction that is intrinsically more efficient and robust. Among candidate material platforms, layered perovskites are particularly appealing owing to their structural diversity and synthetic versatility. However, magnetoelectric properties at the two-dimensional scale remain largely unexplored, hindering their applicability in miniaturized, highly integrated devices. Here, we systematically investigate the dimensional evolution of ferroelectric polarization and magnetism in perovskite systems through symmetry analysis. We demonstrate that altermagnetism can persist in the two-dimensional limit, yet is strongly constrained by the magnetic configuration-with only C-type antiferromagnetic order supporting it. Based on mode-decomposition calculations, we further reveal that symmetry-restricted multimode couplings simultaneously govern ferroelectric polarization and altermagnetic spin splitting. Finally, combined with first-principles calculations, we propose several strategies to lift the magnetic-configuration constraint, extending the range of viable altermagnetic systems. These results underscore the critical role of dimensionality in symmetry-driven magnetoelectric coupling in perovskite altermagnets and pave the way toward next-generation electrically controlled spintronic and multiferroic devices.

We investigate the scattering of a three-dimensional massless Dirac particle through a domain wall separating two regions with identical energy spectra but distinct Berry curvature dipoles. We demonstrate that the quantum geometric mismatch induces partial reflection and transmission despite identical incident and refracted momenta. These results highlight the role of engineered quantum geometric interfaces as key tools to control Dirac particle scattering.

- **TL;DR**: YbCr6Ge6材料中同时存在Cr-笼目晶格和Yb-4f电子两种平带，它们共存并相互作用，导致重费米子行为和增强的反铁磁性。

Flat-band (FB) systems originating from special lattice geometry like in kagome metals as well as localized orbitals in the materials such as heavy-fermion (HF) compounds have induced intensive interest due to their band topology and strong electron correlation effects, leading to emergent quantum states of matter. However, the question of how these two distinct FBs coexist and interact remains unsettled. Here, we report that YbCr6Ge6 hosting both Cr-kagome lattice and Yb-4f electrons exhibits HF behaviors and a robust antiferromagnetic ground state with transition temperature TN = 3 K, significantly higher than other similar kagome metals with Yb ions. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements reveal the coexistence of FBs originating from both Cr-kagome lattice and localized Yb-4f electrons near Fermi energy level EF. More importantly, the clear spectroscopic signatures of a hybridization of Yb-4f FB with kagome-lattice-derived conduction bands and the high density of states of Cr-kagome FB near EF provide the underlying microscopic mechanisms of HF behaviors and enhanced antiferromagnetism in YbCr6Ge6. Our findings demonstrate that the novel kagome HF metals can not only host the cooperative coexistence of two different types of FBs, but also provide a paradigm material platform to explore the exotic correlated topological quantum phenomena.

Precipitate size evolution during room temperature high-pressure torsion (HPT) of a Mg-1.35wt.%Mn alloy was studied using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and Small-/Wide-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS/WAXS). The volume fraction of the nm-scale $α$-Mn particles increased with applied strain, however small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) indicated that the majority of manganese remained in solution even after 10 HPT rotations, indicating that the reaction progress is still limited by the diffusivity of Mn. Analysis of the precipitate size distribution determined that the mean particle size did not increase over the course of HPT. This, in combination with the precipitate size distribution suggested that precipitate growth was subject to interfacial rather than diffusional control.

We present an extensive theoretical analysis of transport and circular currents and the associated induced magnetic fields in Fibonacci rings, explored in both Hermitian and non-Hermitian descriptions, with particular attention to configurations preserving or breaking PT symmetry. By engineering physically balanced gain and loss following a Fibonacci sequence, we realize two distinct geometrical configurations in which the ring either preserve or explicitly break PT symmetry, and further explore complementary realizations obtained by reversing the signs of the on site potentials. Using the non equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism, we analyze transmission properties and bond current densities to quantify both transport and circulating currents. A comparison with the Hermitian limit establishes a clear baseline, where the ring supports only weak responses upon introducing disorder. In sharp contrast, non-Hermiticity leads to a pronounced amplification of transport and circular currents, and hence of the induced magnetic field. We further demonstrate that non-Hermitian transport is highly sensitive to gain and loss sign reversal and, in the non-PT-symmetric case, exhibits an unconventional dependence on system size governed by the parity of the Fibonacci sequence and hopping correlations. Remarkably, the current does not decay monotonically with increasing system size, revealing a distinct scaling behavior absent in conventional Hermitian systems. Our results highlight non-Hermitian quasiperiodic rings as versatile platforms for engineering and amplifying current driven magnetic responses through symmetry, topology, and gain-loss design.

- **TL;DR**: 使用微下拉法（μPD）制备NiTi单晶，并通过多种表征技术分析其相变特性

Nickel-titanium that has an austenite to martensite phase transition has been studied extensively in the past as a shape memory alloy, but a lot remains to be learned from such phase transitions. However, single crystals are needed for a detailed characterization of the emerging phase transition. In order to produce NiTi single crystals for research purposes, we have set up a micro-pulling-down ($μ$PD) apparatus. The $μ$PD process is a fast and flexible method for the fabrication of small single crystals. The apparatus is operated in vacuum. By pulling the crystal down through a hole in the crucible bottom, it is possible to reduce oxygen contamination, since oxides float on top of the melt due to their low density. Here we present a detailed characterization of as-grown NiTi crystals by electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), hot gas extraction method and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The characteristics of the phase transition in NiTi are very sensitive to dopants and alloying. The $μ$PD method facilitates the introduction of different doping elements into the crystal.

- **TL;DR**: 该理论研究揭示了扭曲双层过渡金属硫族化合物中莫尔激子-声子耦合随扭曲角度的变化规律，发现从小角度到较大角度存在两种不同的物理机制，影响吸收光谱特性。

The properties of moiré excitons in twisted bilayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) vary significantly with the twist angle, ranging from quasi localized excitons with flat dispersions for small twist angles to delocalized excitons for larger ones. This twist angle dependence directly impacts the exciton-phonon coupling, which plays a significant role for the optical properties of these materials. In this work we theoretically investigate the twist angle dependent influence of phonons on absorption spectra of intralayer moiré excitons in a twisted TMDC hetero-bilayer. For the lowest-lying intralayer moiré exciton we find that the exciton-phonon coupling interpolates between two physically distinct regimes when tuning the twist angle. At small twist angles non-Markovian polarization dynamics and phonon sidebands dominate the properties of absorption spectra for localized excitons. For larger twist angles Markovian processes become more important leading to additional line broadening. Furthermore, the absorption spectra here show a characteristic asymmetric peak similar to monolayer TMDCs. When taking into account multiple bright moiré exciton bands we find that intraband scattering due to optical phonons has a significant impact on absorption spectra, effectively suppressing absorption peaks of higher lying bands when their bandwidth surpasses the optical phonon energy.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种精确计算金属界面Fukui函数的新方法，通过有限电场利用电子导体的屏蔽特性，实现了费米能级位移的二次误差缩放，达到亚meV精度。

The response of the Fermi energy to external perturbations governs key physical observables at metallic interfaces. Although this response admits a local formulation in terms of the Fukui function, its evaluation has traditionally been limited by inherent approximations, fundamentally rooted in the difficulty of adding a finite charge in a periodic system. We present an exact resolution to this problem that leverages the screening properties of electronic conductors to compute Fukui functions via a finite electric field. The resulting linear-response theory yields strictly quadratic error scaling of Fermi-level shifts across representative platinum surfaces, achieving sub-meV accuracy up to fields of 0.1 V/Å. The approach is further validated by reproducing work-function changes under molecular perturbations, and by providing mean-field estimates of electrode potentials that yield capacitance--voltage curves consistent with experiment. Our findings establish a rigorous foundation for a local theory relating electrostatic screening and Fermi-energy variations at metallic interfaces.

A pair of quantized spin-wave modes is driven by two-tone parallel pumping in a YIG microdisk. The nonlinear dynamics is experimentally investigated by probing the resulting steady state, which is found to critically depend on the chosen pair of modes, the detuning between the pump frequencies and the modes parametric resonance, as well as the temporal sequence of the two rf tones. A general theory of parametric excitation in confined structures based on magnetization normal modes is developed and quantitatively accounts for the observed dependence and non-commutative behaviors, which emerge from the interplay between the self and mutual nonlinear frequency shifts of the spin-wave modes. Owing to its high degree of external controllability and scalability to larger sets of modes, this dynamical system provides a model platform for exploring nonlinear phenomena and a promising route toward rf driven state mapping relevant to neuromorphic and unconventional computing.

### First-principles analysis of in-plane anomalous Hall effect using symmetry-adapted Wannier Hamiltonians and multipole decomposition

The in-plane anomalous Hall effect occurs when magnetization lies within the same plane as the electric field and Hall current, and requires magnetic point groups lacking rotational or mirror symmetries. While it is observed in both Weyl semimetals and elemental ferromagnets, the microscopic role of higher-order multipoles remains unclear. Here, we develop a microscopic framework that combines time-reversal-symmetric Wannier functions with a symmetry-adapted multipole basis to decompose the first-principles Wannier Hamiltonian into electric, magnetic, magnetic toroidal, and electric toroidal multipoles. This approach allows us to rotate the magnetization rank by rank and quantify how each multipole affects the conductivity. Applying this framework to body-centered cubic iron, we find that high-rank magnetic and magnetic toroidal multipoles contribute with magnitudes comparable to magnetic dipoles, while magnetic toroidal 16-poles act with the opposite sign. Furthermore, based on this multipole analysis, we apply uniaxial strain along the [103] direction to control the dominant multipoles contributing to the conductivity. The strain substantially modifies its angular dependence, demonstrating that multipole-resolved Hamiltonian engineering and magnetoelastic control serve as practical routes to predict and tune the in-plane anomalous Hall conductivity in simple ferromagnets.

Spintronics has emerged as a promising field for next-generation devices, offering functionalities beyond complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS). A critical challenge in spintronics is to develop systems that can efficiently generate spin currents and enable their long-distance transport. Here, we demonstrate a graphene (Gr)/heavy metal (HM) heterostructure system that combines strong charge-spin interconversion efficiency, induced by the spin Hall effect, with a long spin diffusion length. By employing an industry-friendly magnetron sputtering technique, we deposit HM layers onto few-layer Gr while minimizing structural damage. The proximity effect from the HM enhances the spin Hall angle of Gr while limiting the reduction in its spin diffusion length. Additionally, the spin Hall angle can be tuned via an applied gate voltage, offering high controllability of the system. Importantly, these properties are observed across heterostructures composed of different HMs, indicating the generality of this approach. Our findings establish Gr/HM heterostructures as a scalable and versatile platform for spin current generation, paving the way for advanced spintronic devices with high efficiency, long spin propagation, and straightforward fabrication processes.

We present a systematic computational study of the effect of uniaxial strain on the magnetic properties of GdRu$_2$Si$_2$, a centrosymmetric material known to host a field-induced skyrmion lattice (SkL). Using first-principles density functional theory, we first demonstrate the pronounced sensitivity of the exchange and anisotropy to specific structural distortions. These DFT-derived interactions are then integrated into a classical spin model to construct comprehensive magnetic phase diagrams under both compressive and tensile strain. Our key finding is that compressive strain ($\sim 2\%$) acts as an effective tuning parameter, substantially expanding the stability region of the $\vec Q_{100}$-driven topologically nontrivial phases. This results from the shifts in the critical magnetic fields and enhancement of the energy scale of the favored magnetic wave vector. In contrast, tensile strain induces a different magnetic ground-state by promoting a different magnetic ordering vector, $\vec Q_{110}$, leading to entirely distinct phase behavior. This work not only provides a quantitative understanding of the structural-magnetic coupling in GdRu$_2$Si$_2$ but also establishes strain engineering as a powerful approach to control and optimize topologically non-trivial magnetic phases in centrosymmetric magnets.

We reveal the higher energetic luminescence part of interlayer exciton ensembles in MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ heterostructures upon excitation by an optical Laguerre-Gaussian mode. The excitation is achieved with the help of a spatial light modulator giving rise to a ring-shaped distribution of interlayer excitons. A hyperspectral analysis of the exciton photoluminescence suggests that the excitation scheme allows the accumulation of high-energetic excitons in the rings' center. We discuss the mechanisms leading to such a distribution, including exciton-exciton interaction, phase-space filling, and an incomplete thermalization.

Transition metal carbides and nitrides (TMCNs), such as niobium carbide (NbC) and niobium nitride (NbN), are of great technological interest due to their exceptional hardness, high melting points, and thermal stability. While previous studies have focused on their groundstate properties (at 0 K), limited information exists on their mechanical behavior under realistic operational conditions involving elevated temperatures and the presence of defects. In this study, we employ ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations to investigate the effects of temperature (300 to 1500 K) and anionic vacancies on the mechanical properties of NbC and NbN in rocksalt (RS), zincblende (ZB), and wurtzite (WZ) structures. The results reveal a nonlinear decrease in elastic constants, bulk, shear, and Youngs moduli with both increasing temperature and defect concentration. Hardness and toughness analyses, based on Pughs ratio and Poisson ratio, show ductility and brittleness transitions that are sensitive to structure, defect level, and thermal effects. Furthermore, vacancy migration energies computed using the nudged elastic band (NEB) method demonstrate strong structural dependence, with RS exhibiting the highest barriers and WZ the lowest. These findings provide new insights into the defect and temperature interplay in NbC and NbN, offering guidelines for their optimization in high-temperature and wear-resistant applications.

While in pristine bilayer graphene the Berry curvature dipole (BCD), a necessary ingredient for the nonlinear anomalous Hall effect, is zero, uniaxial strain can give rise to finite BCD. We investigate this by using a tight-binding (TB) approach build on the Slater-Koster parameterization to capture lattice deformation effects often missed by continuum models. We demonstrate that the BCD's evolution with strain and doping is highly sensitive to the choice in parameterization, particularly when including the longer range interlayer skew hoppings. Additionally, out-of-plane compression enhances the response by broadening the Dirac cones. These findings benchmark low-energy continuum models and highlight the necessity of realistic tight-binding models for accurately predicting strain-engineered Hall effects in bilayer graphene.

Magnon torques, which can operate without involving moving electrons, could circumvent the Joule heating issue. In conventional magnon torque systems, the spin source layer with strong spin-orbit coupling is utilized to inject magnons, and the efficiency is limited by the inherent spin Hall conductivity of the spin source layer. In this work, we observe magnon torques in the Cr/NiO/ferromagnet heterostructure with the effective spin Hall conductivity of 2.45x10^5 hbar/(2eΩm), twice that of the best conventional magnon torque system. We demonstrate the magnon-torque-driven switching of a perpendicularly magnetized CoFeB layer at room temperature, with a switching power consumption density of 0.136 mW/μm^2. We find that the magnon torque originates from the orbital hybridization and interfacial inversion symmetry breaking at the Cr/NiO interface. Our findings not only significantly enhance the efficiency of magnon torques, but also provide key insights into the fundamental mechanisms of magnon injections.

We study ballistic electron transport through electrostatic barriers in AB-stacked bilayer graphene within a full four-band framework. A mode-resolved analysis reveals how propagating and evanescent channels couple across electrostatic interfaces and how channel selectivity governs transport at normal incidence. We show that, even when decoupled channels remain inactive, perfect transmission can occur at discrete energies due to phase matching of a single internal mode within an individual barrier. This effect is interpreted as a ghost quantum well, namely an effective cavity formed by internal phase coherence inside the barrier, without true bound states and without restoring coupling to decoupled channels. For single- and double-barrier geometries, we derive compact analytical expressions for the transmission and identify the corresponding resonance conditions. Extending the analysis to multibarrier structures using a transfer-matrix approach, we demonstrate how perfect resonances driven by internal phase matching coexist with Fabry-Perot-like resonances arising from inter-barrier interference. Our results provide a unified, channel-resolved description of tunnelling suppression and resonance-assisted transport in bilayer graphene barrier systems.

Optical spin orientation measured by time-resolved photoluminescence provides a powerful tool to probe the spin dynamics of excitons and charge carriers in perovskite semiconductors. The impact of alloy fluctuations on the spin dynamics of mixed-cation \MAFAPI{} perovskite single crystals is studied here experimentally. The optical orientation is measured under nonresonant excitation for crystals with $x = 0.1$, $0.4$, and $0.8$ at cryogenic temperatures and compared with data on \MAPI{} crystals. The high degree of exciton optical orientation of $75-80$\% for $x = 0.1$ and $0.8$ reduces to about 60\% for $x = 0.4$. A similar trend is observed for the carrier spin optical orientation. This behavior is attributed to enhanced scattering of free excitons and carriers in the alloys with increased compositional and structural disorder. From the Larmor spin precession measured from spin dynamics in an external magnetic field applied in the Voigt geometry, the electron and hole $g$-factors are evaluated. Their dependence on the band gap energy in \MAFAPI{} crystals follows the universal trend previously established for lead halide perovskites.

In recent years the intermetallic alloys of Fe and Sn have gained significant interest due to a rich variety of magnetic properties present in these materials. The crystal Fe3Sn2 is a frustrated ferromagnet, while the crystallographically similar FeSn, which differs only by the stacking sequence of its Fe-containining kagome and stanene layers, is an antiferromagnet. Thin-film growth techniques such as magnetron sputtering allow for these different stoichiometric compositions to be grown through adjustments of the rate of deposition of the individual Fe and Sn sources, while all other conditions remain constant. Here, we report the production of high quality epitaxial thin films of Fe$_3$Sn$_2$ and FeSn on sapphire with a Pt seed layer, as well as a mixed phase containing intergrowths of both crystals, all of which we have characterized using both X-ray and four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) methods. The resulting crystallographic phase content is compared to the results of magnetization measurements, with correspondence between the predicted ferromagnetic phase content and the resulting magnetization. Further magnetic properties of these films can then also be compared, leading to the discovery of a unique behavior in the temperature dependent coercivity within highly mixed phase alloys, a feature that is absent in either pure Fe3Sn2 and FeSn.

Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) play a crucial role in spintronic applications, particularly data storage and sensors. Especially as a non-volatile memory, MTJs have received substantial attention due to its CMOS compatibility, low power consumption, fast switching speed, and high endurance. In parallel, bio-resorbable electronics have emerged as a promising solution for systems requiring temporary operation and secure data disposal, especially in military, intelligence, and biomedical systems where devices must safely disintegrate under physiological conditions. In this study, we investigate the bio-resorbability of MTJ by analyzing the dissolution behavior of its nanometer-thick constituent layers in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution at pH 7.4, simulating physiological environments. The MTJ structures, composed of bio-resorbable materials, exhibit well-controlled degradation behaviors. Critically, as one of the ferromagnetic layers dissolves, binary information is irreversibly lost, within 10 hours of immersion. These findings highlight the potential of MTJs not only as high-performance memory elements but also as secure, transient data storage platforms. The ability to modify the dissolution lifetime by materials and thickness selection offers unique advantages for short-lived implantable devices, paving the way for integrating spintronic functionality into next-generation bioresorbable electronics.

Polar topological textures in low-dimensional ferroelectrics have emerged as a versatile platform for high-density information storage and neuromorphic computing. While low-order topological states, such as vortices and skyrmions, have been extensively studied, high-order polar topological families remain largely unexplored due to their higher energy requirements and limited stabilization methods. Here, using a BiFeO3 (BFO)-based multiferroic superlattice as a model system, we demonstrate a thermal-modulation strategy that stabilizes multi-order polar skyrmions and enables reversible tuning of their topological order through phase-field simulations. It was found that temperature modulation drives the system from polar solitons through 1π-, 2π-, 3π-, and 4π-skyrmion states, with closed heating-cooling path analyses revealing the widest thermal stability window for 2π-skyrmions (up to 600 K). Leveraging this robustness, 2% Sm doping in BFO lowers the transition temperatures, enabling room-temperature stabilization of 2π-skyrmions. These findings enrich the fundamental understanding of multi-order polar topologies and establish a tunable strategy for realizing variable-order topological configurations in practical memory devices.

Electron motion in spin-orbit torque devices inevitably leads to the Joule heating issue. Magnon torques can potentially circumvent this issue, as it enables the transport of spin angular momentum in insulating magnetic materials. In this work, we fabricate a sandwich structure composed of Hf/antiferromagnetic Cr2O3/ferromagnet and demonstrate that the magnon torque is strongly dependent on the crystalline structure of Cr2O3. Magnon torques are stronger when the Neel vector of Cr2O3 aligns parallel to the spin polarization generated in Hf, while they are suppressed when the Neel vector is perpendicular to the spin polarization. The magnon torque efficiency is estimated to be -0.134 using in-plane second harmonic Hall measurements. Using magnon torques, we achieve perpendicular magnetization switching of CoFeB, with a critical switching current density of 4.09 x 10^7 A/cm^2. Furthermore, the spin angular momentum loss due to the insertion of Cr2O3 is found to be lower than that of polycrystalline NiO. Our work highlights the role of antiferromagnet crystalline structures in controlling magnon torques, broadening the potential applications of magnon torques.

Noncollinear spin structures have attracted tremendous attention because they offer a versatile platform for spin control and manipulation, essential in spintronics. Realizing noncollinearity in ferrimagnetic insulators is of particular interest as they can be potentially utilized in low-damping spintronics with tunable magnetic order. Within the spinel-ferrite family, Zn and Al-substituted nickel ferrite (NiZAF) has emerged as an excellent choice for low-damping spintronics. However, realizing noncollinearity in such systems remains challenging. Here, we present evidence of noncollinear spin structure in the NiZAF thin films induced by the rare earth Dy-doping, utilizing the soft x-ray spectroscopy methods such as magnetic circular dichroism and x-ray resonant magnetic reflectivity (XRMR). In particular, XRMR reveals a spiral-type spin structure, which is attributed to the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, arising due to broken inversion symmetry by the Dy-induced local strain field as confirmed by our theoretical calculations. The realization of noncollinearity in the spinel-ferrite opens pathway to explore the possibility of chiral magnetic domains and topological spin textures exhibiting promise for oxide-based spintronics

Understanding microstructural evolution under extreme thermal conditions is essential for advancing metal additive manufacturing (AM). This work demonstrates the feasibility of employing micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) heating platforms for in-situ scanning electron microscopy (SEM) characterization of bulk-like samples during rapid thermal cycling. Using electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), we tracked the ferrite-to-austenite phase transformation in a pure iron specimen and confirmed that the sample surface temperature closely follows the MEMS temperature setpoint within device accuracy. Under vacuum conditions, stable heating and cooling rates of up to 1000 C/s were achieved with minimal power input and without compromising EBSD pattern quality. These findings establish MEMS-based heating as a robust approach for in-situ microstructural characterization of AM-relevant thermal processes in the SEM, enabling quantitative studies of thermally activated phenomena such as diffusion, phase transformations, and microstructural evolution under far-from-equilibrium conditions.

Hydrogen embrittlement in metals is strongly governed by hydrogen diffusion and trapping, yet predicting these effects in polycrystalline systems remains challenging. This work introduces a multiscale modeling framework that links atomistic energetics to continuum-scale transport. Migration barriers for bulk and grain-boundary environments, obtained from first-principles calculations, are used in kinetic Monte Carlo simulations to compute anisotropic effective diffusivities. These diffusivities are then incorporated into finite element models of polycrystalline microstructures, explicitly accounting for grain-boundary character and connectivity. The approach captures both fast-path and trapping effects without relying on empirical parameters and reproduces experimental trends for nickel, including the dependence of effective diffusivity on grain size and boundary type. This methodology provides a physically grounded route for predicting hydrogen transport in engineering alloys and can be extended to other materials and defect types.

Active learning (AL) plays a critical role in materials science, enabling applications such as the construction of machine-learning interatomic potentials for atomistic simulations and the operation of self-driving laboratories. Despite its widespread use, the reliability and effectiveness of AL workflows depend on implicit design assumptions that are rarely examined systematically. Here, we critically assess AL workflows deployed in materials science and investigate how key design choices, such as surrogate models, sampling strategies, uncertainty quantification and evaluation metrics, relate to their performance. By identifying common pitfalls and discussing practical mitigation strategies, we provide guidance to practitioners for the efficient design, assessment, and interpretation of AL workflows in materials science.
