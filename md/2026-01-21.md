- **TL;DR**: 在超净单层WSe₂中观察到电子和空穴维格纳晶体中的多分支激子Umklapp散射，揭示了极化子诱导的亮化机制，建立了维格纳晶体极化子作为新的准粒子范式。

Strong Coulomb interactions in two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors give rise to tightly bound excitons, exciton polarons, and correlated electronic phases such as Wigner crystals (WCs), yet their mutual interplay remains poorly understood. Here we report the observation of multi-branch excitonic Umklapp scattering in both electron and hole WCs realized in ultraclean monolayer WSe$_2$, exhibiting exceptionally high melting temperatures (T$_c$ $\approx$ 20-30 K). Robust Wigner crystallization activates multiple finite-momentum optical resonances, including quasilinearly dispersing, light-like excitons and exciton polarons, extending far beyond the single excitonic Umklapp feature reported previously. Helicity-resolved magneto-optical measurements reveal a pronounced valley dependence of the scattering processes. Combined experiment and theory identify a polaron-induced brightening mechanism in which exciton polarons transfer oscillator strength from bright zero-momentum states to otherwise dark finite-momentum states, explaining the emergence of multiple Umklapp branches where conventional exciton-WC scattering is ineffective. These results establish WC polarons as a new quasiparticle paradigm and introduce polaron-induced Umklapp scattering as a general route to accessing finite-momentum many-body excitations in 2D quantum materials.

- **TL;DR**: 实验首次成功实现Laughlin泵浦，利用表面声波技术清除累积电荷，直接测量量子霍尔电导，无需复杂数据拟合，并能提取极低的纵向电导。

The quantum Hall effect is a fascinating electrical transport phenomenon signified by precise quantization of Hall conductivity $σ_\mathrm{xy}$ and vanishing longitudinal conductivity $σ_\mathrm{xx}$. Laughlin proposed an elegant explanation in which adiabatic insertion of a flux tube pumps charge through the system. This analysis unveils the fundamental role of gauge invariance and provides a compelling argument about the fractional charge of fractional quantum Hall states. While it has been used extensively as a theoretical tool, a quantitative experimental investigation is lacking despite multiple attempts. Here we report successful realizations of Laughlin pumping in several integer and fractional quantum Hall states. One essential technical innovation is using surface acoustic waves to periodically clear the charges accumulated during the pumping process. Magnetic fluxes are inserted at a constant rate so there is no need to perform complicated data fitting. Furthermore, our setting can reliably extract $σ_\mathrm{xx}$ that is several orders of magnitude lower than the limit of conventional techniques. Effective energy gaps can be deduced from the temperature dependence of $σ_\mathrm{xx}$, which are drastically different from those provided by conventional transport data. This work not only brings a famous gedanken experiment to reality but also serves as a portal for many future investigations.

We present a theory of the emission spectrum of magnetoexcitons interacting with a $ν= 1$ quantum Hall state of massive Dirac fermions in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides in high magnetic fields. Using an ab initio-parametrized massive Dirac fermion model including valley and spin degrees of freedom, combined with exact diagonalization techniques, we show that interband emission from the massive Dirac Fermion magnetoexciton interacting with $ν= 1$ state directly probes intra-conduction-band excitations of the $ν= 1$. Many-body interactions with the filled massive Dirac fermion $ν= 1$ level yield a strong renormalization of the emission spectrum, including fully polarized emission, a pronounced redshift, and broadening relative to neutral and charged excitons. The calculated spectra are consistent with recent experiments [1-3], establishing magneto-spectroscopy as a probe of finite carrier densities in massive Dirac systems.

### Ratchet effect in lateral plasmonic crystal: Giant enhancement due to interference of "bright" and "dark" modes

- **TL;DR**: 该论文提出了一种横向等离子体晶体中棘轮效应的精确理论，揭示了亮暗等离子体模式干涉导致的直流光电流显著增强机制。

We develop a theory of the ratchet effect in a lateral plasmonic crystal (LPC) formed by a two dimensional electron gas under a periodic dual-grating gate. The system is driven by terahertz radiation, and the spatial asymmetry required for the generation of dc photocurrent is introduced by a phase shift between the radiation's near-field modulation and the static electron density profile. In contrast to the commonly used perturbative "minimal model" of the ratchet effect, which assumes weak density modulation, we solve the problem exactly with respect to the static gate-induced potential while treating the radiation field perturbatively. This approach reveals a dramatic enhancement of the plasmonic contribution to the ratchet current due to the interference of "bright" and "dark" plasmon modes, which are excited on an equal footing in the asymmetric LPC. Specifically, we predict a parametric growth of the plasmonic peak as compared with the Drude peak with increasing coupling, and the appearance of a dense super-resonant structure when the spacing between plasmonic sub-bands becomes larger than the damping rate. Hence, the dc response exhibits both resonant and super-resonant regimes observed in recent experiments on the radiation transmission through the LPC. The interplay of bright and dark modes, together with their interference, provides a powerful mechanism for controlling the magnitude and sign of the photocurrent by gate voltages and the radiation frequency.

- **TL;DR**: 研究空间对称性破缺对Kohn-Luttinger超导机制的影响，发现即使存在强对称性破缺，KL超导仍然普遍存在且具有定性普适行为。

We investigate how strongly broken spatial symmetries affect the Kohn--Luttinger (KL) mechanism, in which superconductivity emerges purely from repulsive interactions. While the original KL argument assumes continuous rotational symmetry, real materials possess only discrete point-group symmetries, raising a central question: can sufficiently strong symmetry breaking suppress or eliminate KL superconductivity? Using controlled perturbation theory and explicit two-dimensional models with Ising and Rashba spin--orbit coupling (SOC), we find that KL superconductivity is broadly robust and exhibits qualitatively universal behavior across models: the transition temperature $T_c$ is nonmonotonic in the symmetry-breaking field, shows a pronounced maximum at scales of the order of the Fermi energy, and decays exponentially toward zero at asymptotically large fields. However, the physical mechanisms determining this suppression may differ between models. Overall, these results demonstrate that KL-type superconductivity can persist across a wide class of spin--orbit-coupled systems.

### Developing a Machine-Learning Interatomic Potential for Non-Covalent Interactions in Proteins

- **TL;DR**: PANIP是一个基于NequIP框架的机器学习原子间势能模型，专门用于蛋白质片段间的非共价相互作用，通过多保真度主动学习从PDB数据库提取训练数据，在QM精度下以接近力场的计算成本预测蛋白质-配体结合能。

Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) enable efficient modeling of molecular interactions with quantum mechanical (QM) accuracy. However, constructing robust and representative training datasets that capture subtle, system-specific interaction motifs remains challenging. We introduce PANIP (PAirwise Non-covalent Interaction Potential), an ensemble MLIP model built upon the NequIP framework and trained on non-covalent interactions (NCIs) between protein-derived fragments. PANIP is trained using an automated multi-fidelity active learning (MFAL) workflow, in which a representative training subset, termed PDB-FRAGID (PDB Fragment Interaction Dataset), was distilled from an otherwise prohibitively large pool of fragment dimers extracted from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). PANIP retains ωB97X-D3BJ/def2-TZVPP-level accuracy and achieves mean absolute errors below 0.2 kcal/mol on out-of-distribution systems, demonstrating excellent transferability across diverse NCI motifs. Compared to the widely used ANI-2x potential, PANIP delivers substantially lower errors, particularly for charged and strongly interacting dimers. Coupled with a fragmentation-based energy decomposition scheme, PANIP estimates protein-ligand binding energies at near force-field computational cost yet QM-level accuracy, enabling its use as a fragment-based scoring function that rivals specialized docking scoring functions.

### Multi-Scale Negative Coupled Information Systems (MNCIS): A Unified Spectral Topology Framework for Stability in Turbulence, AI, and Biology

- **TL;DR**: 该论文提出了一个统一的多尺度负耦合信息系统（MNCIS）框架，通过自适应谱负耦合（ASNC）算子防止复杂动力系统中的谱间隙崩溃，并在流体力学、人工智能和生物物理三个领域验证了其有效性。

Complex dynamical systems frequently encounter a recurrent structural instability: the collapse of the spectral gap, driving the system toward a low-dimensional "Zero-Mode Attractor" (e.g., spectral pile-up or over-smoothing). Building upon recent global well-posedness estimates [Hou, arXiv:2601.00638], this work generalizes the Multi-Scale Negative Coupled Information System (MNCIS) framework. We postulate that global stability requires an active topological operator -- Adaptive Spectral Negative Coupling (ASNC) -- functioning as a state-dependent high-pass filter that penalizes entropy accumulation at spectral boundaries. We validate this unified framework via three implementations:(1) Hydrodynamics: In 3D Navier-Stokes turbulence ($N=256^3$), ASNC acts as a global-enstrophy adaptive sub-grid scale (SGS) model, stabilizing the inviscid limit and preserving the Kolmogorov $-5/3$ inertial range without artificial hyper-viscosity.(2) Artificial Intelligence: Addressing Over-smoothing in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), we implement ASNC as a parameter-free topological constraint. Unlike baselines (e.g., DeepGCNs) relying on dense residual connections to bypass signal decay, our framework enables the training of ultra-deep 64-layer networks without residual connections, maintaining perfectly stationary feature variance ($σ^2 \equiv 1.0$) on the ogbn-arxiv benchmark. (3) Biological Physics: In reaction-diffusion morphogenesis, it stabilizes Turing patterns against diffusive washout in high-entropy regimes. Our results suggest that the MNCIS framework provides a base-independent topological condition for distinguishing viable complex systems from those collapsing into thermal equilibrium, bridging physical stability and information persistence.

- **TL;DR**: 使用共振非弹性X射线散射在镍酸盐Pr4Ni3O8中首次观测到等离子体激元，发现其比铜酸盐更阻尼、速度更低，且随温度升高软化，揭示了镍酸盐独特的电荷屏蔽特性。

The discovery of nickelate superconductors has opened a new arena for studying the behavior of correlated electron liquids that give rise to unconventional superconductivity. While critical information about a material's charge dynamics is encoded in its plasmons, collective modes of the electron gas, these excitations have not yet been observed in nickelate materials. Here, we use resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) to detect plasmons in the metallic, low-valence nickelate Pr4Ni3O8. Although qualitatively similar to those in cuprates, the nickelate plasmons are more heavily damped and have a lower velocity than those in a cuprate at comparable doping, which we attribute to reduced electronic hopping and enhanced screening of the long-range Coulomb interactions. Furthermore, the plasmons in Pr4Ni3O8 soften with increasing temperature, in contrast to the cuprate, where plasmons remain at nearly fixed energy but become more strongly damped. Taken together, these results reveal a distinct charge-screening landscape in nickelates and place quantitative constraints on analogies to cuprates.

Nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers have been demonstrated as a useful tool in high pressure environments. However, the geometry and small working area of the diamond anvil cells (DACs) used to apply pressure present a challenge to effective delivery of microwave (mw) fields. We designed and characterized a novel slotted design for mw transmission to nitrogen-vacancy centers (NVs) in a diamond anvil cell via zero-field and in-field optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) measurements across pressures between 1 and 48 GPa. The mw fields experienced by NVs across the diamond culet was calculated from Rabi frequency and found to be higher and more uniform than those generated by an equivalent simple mw line, which will improve performance for wide-field, high-pressure measurements to probe spatial variations across samples under pressure.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究探讨了强关联无序系统中零偏压异常的特征，特别是在考虑引线影响后，该特征在平行耦合双量子点系统中仍然清晰可见。

The combination of disorder and interactions is known in many systems to produce a feature in the single-particle density of states, the shape and parameter dependence of which act as signatures of the underlying electronic state. Strong Coulomb repulsion gives rise to a host of novel phenomena, among these is a unique zero-bias anomaly. While understanding of the anomaly in bulk materials remains incomplete, a version of this anomaly can be found in an ensemble of two-site systems and hence has been predicted to be observable in parallel-coupled double quantum dots. However, prior work did not include the influence of the leads. Here we show that the presence of the leads results in changes to the projected stability diagrams but that the signature of the strongly-correlated zero-bias anomaly nonetheless remains clearly visible.

### Reentrant superconductivity and Stoner boundaries in twisted WSe$_2$

- **TL;DR**: 该研究通过矩阵随机相位近似方法分析扭曲WSe₂双层中自旋-谷不稳定性，发现van Hove奇异线附近的spin-valley有序态及其波动是重入超导的微观起源。

We investigate spin-valley instabilities and their connection to the reentrant superconducting states recently observed in the twisted bilayer dichalcogenide WSe$_2$ at a $5^o$ twist angle. Starting from an effective three-orbital faithful Wannier model for the spin-locked moiré bands, combined with orbital-dependent Hubbard interactions, we analyze the evolution of magnetic instabilities as a function of carrier density using the matrix random phase approximation (mRPA) approach. By computing the Stoner boundary lines from the spin-valley susceptibilities over the electric-field by hole filling phase diagram, we show that the spin-valley instabilities result in ordered states in the region close to the Lifshitz transition at the topmost moiré valence band, marked by crossing of the van Hove singularity in the density of states. These spin-valley ordered states are dominated by interorbital spin-valley-flips involving the $MM$ and $MX$ moiré orbitals and occur at different momenta in each side of the van Hove line, indicating a distinct spatial dependence of the spin-valley order parameter depending on the hole filling. Moreover, the corresponding Stoner boundaries exhibit strong fluctuations on its flanks, which can favor superconducting states in the regions close to the spin-valley-ordered ones. This mechanism provides a natural description for a reentrant superconducting dome consistent with the experimental results. As such, our results suggest spin-valley fluctuations near the van-Hove line as the microscopic origin of the reentrant superconductivity in twisted WSe$_2$.

- **TL;DR**: 开发了一个基于大语言模型（LLM）的智能体，通过Model Context Protocol（MCP）与AVEVA Process Simulation（APS）集成，使用自然语言与严格的过程模拟进行交互，实现流程分析、优化和自动流程图合成。

Modern process simulators enable detailed process design, simulation, and optimization; however, constructing and interpreting simulations is time-consuming and requires expert knowledge. This limits early exploration by inexperienced users. To address this, a large language model (LLM) agent is integrated with AVEVA Process Simulation (APS) via Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing natural language interaction with rigorous process simulations. An MCP server toolset enables the LLM to communicate programmatically with APS using Python, allowing it to execute complex simulation tasks from plain-language instructions. Two water-methanol separation case studies assess the framework across different task complexities and interaction modes. The first shows the agent autonomously analyzing flowsheets, finding improvement opportunities, and iteratively optimizing, extracting data, and presenting results clearly. The framework benefits both educational purposes, by translating technical concepts and demonstrating workflows, and experienced practitioners by automating data extraction, speeding routine tasks, and supporting brainstorming. The second case study assesses autonomous flowsheet synthesis through both a step-by-step dialogue and a single prompt, demonstrating its potential for novices and experts alike. The step-by-step mode gives reliable, guided construction suitable for educational contexts; the single-prompt mode constructs fast baseline flowsheets for later refinement. While current limitations such as oversimplification, calculation errors, and technical hiccups mean expert oversight is still needed, the framework's capabilities in analysis, optimization, and guided construction suggest LLM-based agents can become valuable collaborators.

We propose a novel level set-based topology optimization for micropolar solids subjected to thermo-mechanical loading. To capture the size effects, we have incorporated the microstructural length-scale information into the level set-based topology optimization method by adopting a micropolar theory. The proposed non-local topology optimization method can provide accurate topology optimization for size-dependent solids under thermo-mechanical loading. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method through a few representative two-dimensional benchmark problems. The numerical results reveal the substantial influence of underlying micro-structures, incorporated in the model through micropolar parameters, and temperature on topology optimization, highlighting the necessity of the proposed thermo-mechanical micropolar formulation for materials with pronounced non-local effects. For the numerical implementation of the proposed model, we have used open-source finite element libraries, \texttt{Gridap.jl}, and \texttt{GridapTopOpt.jl}, available in Julia, to ensure transparency and reproducibility of the reported computational results.

Berry curvature does not show itself in the relative phase correlation of wave-functions at different spatial points in a metal unless the fermions have closed trajectories in momentum space, for example those around isolated impurities. But these, just as the Bloch phase correlations, disappear at lengths larger than the diffusion length. If a quasi-two dimensional metal with Berry curvature has a set of domains, their boundaries necessarily carry chiral currents precluding back-ward scattering. The Berry induced phase coherence then persists over length scales of order the scale at which the chiral one-dimensional states scatter into the bulk states, which can be macroscopic. The conditions for their occurrence and the lengths and the orientation of such states are derived. These calculations are used to understand the remarkable aspects of a recent experiment in an anisotropic metal, reported to have loop-current order, with mean-free path of about 0.01 $μ$m which exhibits flux quantization in some transport properties over lengths of several $μ$m. %It is also shown that generating the appropriately oriented channels in the plane by the field applied is plausible.

Two-dimensional (2D) flakes of ReSe2 structure were grown by chemical vapor deposition and investigated at room temperature using Raman, photoluminescence, and absorption spectroscopies. The Raman spectra revealed eighteen phonon modes in the range of 100-300 cm-1 that were found in good agreement with the density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The thickness profiles of the ReSe2 flakes are in the range of 5-50 nm. The ReSe2 crystal structure and morphology were investigated using XRD, atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The energy dispersion spectroscopy confirmed the 1:2 elemental composition. The absorption spectra were obtained for ReSe2 flakes and found to exhibit excitonic peaks in the spectral region of 885 - 942 nm. These peaks are used to define the band gap of the material. The DFT calculations predicted an indirect bandgap of 0.88 eV for the bulk structure, while a direct bandgap of 1.26 eV was predicted for the monolayer.

### Guided spin wave in monolayer CrSBr: Localization and spin-orbit coupling from dipolar field

Spin-wave spectrum of monolayer CrSBr waveguides was studied by numerically diagonalizing the Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian derived from linearising the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. In contrast to its short-range counterparts, the long-range dipolar field acts statically as a confining potential for spin wave, while the dynamic part couples the spin and orbit degrees of freedom, thus giving rise to spin-orbit coupling for spin wave. Due to the inversion symmetry of the Hamiltonian and the spinor structure of the wave function, spin-wave eigenstates form doublets with definite parity. Micromagnetic simulation tallies well with numerical calculation. Our study on spin-wave eigenstates in CrSBr waveguides sheds light on the nature of exchange-dipole spin wave in ferromagnetic slabs. We confirm particularly that the robustness of the Damon-Eshbach mode is not derived from topology, but rather from the static dipolar field. Moreover, a thorough knowledge on spin wave in monolayer CrSBr itself represents a step forward to understanding the more complicated antiferromagnetic resonance in bulk CrSBr.

This yields a compact Bogoliubov--de Gennes (BdG) Hamiltonian $H_{\rm BdG}=ξ_{\mathbf{k}}τ_z+τ_{+}q+τ_{-}\,\overline{q}$ and keeps time-reversal symmetry, Altland-Zirnbauer classification, and topological diagnostics in the same variables. We introduce a quarteting field $Q\propto\mathrm{Sc}(q^2)$ and a minimal Ginzburg-Landau (GL) functional with covariant derivatives $(\nabla-2ie\mathbf{A})q$ and $(\nabla-4ie\mathbf{A})Q$. Analytically, a one-loop evaluation of the fluctuation bubble $Π(0)$ (with prefactors) gives a quantitative vestigial charge-$4e$ criterion $μ_{\rm eff}=μ-g^2Π(0)&lt;0$. Numerically, we verify: (i) a two-dimensional (2D) class-DIII lattice model whose $\mathbb{Z}_2$ index, computed directly from $q(\mathbf{k})$ using the matrix Pfaffian of an antisymmetric sewing matrix at time-reversal-invariant momenta (TRIM), matches helical edge spectra; (ii) a GL simulation of a pure-$Q$ vortex carrying $hc/4e$ flux within $\sim2\%$ and exhibiting $ξ_Q\propto\sqrt{η/|μ_{\rm eff}|}$; and (iii) a short-junction current-phase relation with a controlled window where the second harmonic dominates ($I_2\gg I_1$), together with doubled alternating-current (ac) Josephson emission and even-only Shapiro steps. The framework provides a compact, symmetry-faithful route from microscopic pairing to device-level charge-$4e$ signatures.

- **TL;DR**: 激光驱动HCl二聚体库仑爆炸的通道分辨研究：早期电离程度决定碎片化通道选择，高电离导致近同步四体解离，低电离导致顺序解离或三体碎片化。

We present a channel-resolved interpretation of laser-driven Coulomb explosion of the HCl dimer from an ensemble of trajectories. Three dominant outcomes are identified: a minor three-body channel and two four-body channels (sequential and near-simultaneous dissociation of both molecules). The key result is that pathway selection is strongly correlated with the degree of ionization during the laser interaction, which is in turn strongly modulated by laser-molecule orientation. Higher early-time ionization predisposes the system toward near-simultaneous four-body breakup, whereas lower ionization favors sequential and three-body fragmentation; for low-ionization cases, a fragment-resolved charge metric further differentiates three-body and sequential behavior. These charge-dependent trends consistently map onto experimentally accessible observables: the simultaneous mechanism dominates the high-energy tail of the kinetic energy release (KER) spectrum and populate distinct regions of the emission-angle distributions, while sequential events concentrate at lower KER. Overall, early-time charge evolution provides a unifying explanation for channel branching and for the channel-resolved fragmentation signatures.

- **TL;DR**: 提出使用Padé近似来减少Fisher零点、能量概率分布和矩生成函数方法中所需零点数量，降低计算成本，应用于二维Ising和XY模型验证有效性。

Fisher zeros play a central role in the theoretical understanding of phase transitions. However, their computation requires knowledge of the density of states, which limits their practical applicability. Alternative approaches based on the Energy Probability Distribution (EPD) and Moment Generating Function (MGF) alleviate the computational cost but suffer from convergence issues in the two-dimensional \textbf{anisotropic Heisenberg} model (XY model). In this work, we introduce a Padé approximation to systematically reduces the number of zeros required in the Fisher, EPD, and MGF formulations without loss of accuracy. Moreover, since the Fisher zeros formulation does not rely on a convergence algorithm, their combination with a Padé approximation enables a reliable analysis of the XY model while significantly reducing computational cost. Applications to the two-dimensional Ising and XY models demonstrate substantial reductions in polynomial degree and computation time while preserving accurate estimates of the critical temperature.

Entanglement entropy (EE) is a fundamental probe of quantum phases and critical phenomena, which was thought to reflect only bulk universality for a long time. Very recently, people realized that the microscopic geometry of the entanglement cut can induce distinct entanglement-edge modes, whose coupling to bulk critical fluctuations may alter the scaling of the EE. However, this perception is very qualitative and lacks quantitative consideration. Here, we investigate this problem through high-precision quantum Monte Carlo simulations combined with the analysis of scaling theory to build a quantitative understanding. By considering three distinct bipartitions corresponding to three surface criticality types, we reveal a striking dependence of the constant term γ on the microscopic cut at the quantum critical point. Notably, cuts that generate extra gapless edge modes yield a sign reversal in γ compared to those producing gapped edges. We explain this behavior via a modified scaling form that incorporates contributions from both bulk and surface critical modes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the derivative of EE robustly extracts the bulk critical point and exponent ν regardless of the cut geometry, providing a reliable diagnostic of bulk universality in the presence of strong surface effects. Our work for the first time establishes a direct quantitative connection between surface criticality and entanglement scaling, challenging the conventional view that EE solely reflects bulk properties and offering a refined framework for interpreting entanglement in systems with boundary-sensitive criticality.

Autonomous materials science, where active learning is used to navigate large compositional phase space, has emerged as a powerful vehicle to rapidly explore new materials. A crucial aspect of autonomous materials science is exploring new materials using as little data as possible. Gaussian process-based active learning allows effective charting of multi-dimensional parameter space with a limited number of training data, and thus is a common algorithmic choice for autonomous materials science. An integral part of the autonomous workflow is the application of kernel functions for quantifying similarities among measured data points. A recent theoretical breakthrough has shown that quantum kernel models can achieve similar performance with less training data than classical models. This signals the possible advantage of applying quantum kernel machine learning to autonomous materials discovery. In this work, we compare quantum and classical kernels for their utility in sequential phase space navigation for autonomous materials science. Specifically, we compute a quantum kernel and several classical kernels for x-ray diffraction patterns taken from an Fe-Ga-Pd ternary composition spread library. We conduct our study on both IonQ's Aria trapped ion quantum computer hardware and the corresponding classical noisy simulator. We experimentally verify that a quantum kernel model can outperform some classical kernel models. The results highlight the potential of quantum kernel machine learning methods for accelerating materials discovery and suggest complex x-ray diffraction data is a candidate for robust quantum kernel model advantage.

Transitions from reversible to irreversible or fluctuating states above a critical density and shear amplitude have been extensively studied in non-thermal cyclically sheared suspensions and amorphous solids. Here, we propose that the same type of reversible to irreversible transition occurs for a system of particles with competing short-range attraction and long-range repulsion, which can form crystals, stripes, and bubbles as the ratio of attraction to repulsion varies. By oscillating the strength of the attractive part of the potential, we find that the system can organize into either time-periodic states consisting of nondiffusive complex closed orbits, or into a diffusive fluctuating state. A critical point separates these states as a function of the maximum strength of the attraction, oscillation frequency, and particle density. We also find a re-entrant behavior of the reversible state as a function of the strength of the attraction and the oscillation frequency.

We explore the zero-phonon line of single photon emitters in helium-ion treated monolayer MoS$_2$, which are currently understood in terms of single sulfur-site vacancies. By comparing the linewidths of the zero-phonon line as extracted directly from optical spectra with values inferred from the first-order autocorrelation function of the photoluminescence, we quantify bounds of the homogeneous broadening and of phonon-assisted contributions. The results are discussed in terms of both the independent boson model and ab-initio results as computed from GW and Bethe-Salpeter equation approximations.

### Microscopic origin of orbital magnetization in chiral superconductors

Chiral superconductivity is a time reversal symmetry breaking superconducting phase that has attracted broad interest as a potential platform for topological quantum computation. A fundamental consequence of this symmetry breaking is orbital magnetization, yet a clear microscopic formulation of this quantity has remained elusive. This difficulty arises because Bogoliubov quasiparticles do not carry a definite electric charge, precluding a simple interpretation of orbital magnetization in terms of circulating quasiparticle currents. Moreover, superconductivity and ferromagnetism rarely coexist, and in the few materials where they do (e.g. uranium-based compounds), strong spin-orbit coupling obscures the orbital contribution to the magnetization. The recent report of chiral superconductivity in rhombohedral multilayer graphene, which has negligible spin-orbit coupling, therefore provides a unique opportunity to develop and test a microscopic theory of orbital magnetization in chiral superconductors. Here we develop such a theory, unifying the interband coherence effects underlying normal-state orbital magnetization with the intrinsic orbital moments of the Cooper-pair condensate. Applying our theory to rhombohedral tetralayer graphene, we find that the onset of superconductivity can either enhance or suppress the normal-state orbital magnetization, depending sensitively on the bandstructure. We further identify a generalized clapping mode corresponding to coherent fluctuations between the two opposite chiral windings of the p-wave order parameter, with a gap set by the sublattice winding form factor. This collective mode is unique to chiral superconductors and contributes to the orbital magnetization through its role in dressing the photon vertex. Experimental measurements of the orbital magnetization relative to the quarter-metal phase would provide a direct test of our theory.

By examining vertical excitations in CH+ at equilibrium and stretched geometries, adiabatic excitations in CH, and ground- and excited-state potential cuts of water, we demonstrate that the CIPSI-driven CC($P$;$Q$) method converges parent CC/EOMCC singles, doubles, and triples energetics from relatively inexpensive Hamiltonian diagonalizations in CI spaces smaller than the corresponding triples manifolds.

The exploration of quantum phenomena in complex materials such as moiré superlattices is limited by the O(N^3) scaling of conventional electronic structure methods. Here we introduce a high-performance tight-binding framework that reduces the complexity to O(N^1.5) by transforming the Hamiltonian into a real symmetric form and combining Sylvester's inertia law with LDL decomposition. This approach enables efficient band structure calculations for large systems: solving magic angle twisted bilayer graphene in minutes on a laptop and scaling to 1.5 million atoms within days on a workstation. We apply it to the previously inaccessible ultra-low twist-angle regime (less than 0.16 degree) with mechanical strain relaxation and find robust flat bands persisting down to 0.09 degree. Our framework bridges density functional theory accuracy with large-scale quantum simulation, opening a route to systematic data-driven exploration of mesoscale quantum materials.

Accurate optical constants are essential for modelling light propagation, absorption, and ultimately photovoltaic performance in state of the art perovskite solar cells and is especially important for multiple junction or tandem cells. However, available datasets for metal halide perovskites remain sparse, inconsistent in quality, and often suffer from unphysical sub bandgap extinction caused by surface roughness and limitations of conventional ellipsometry fits. Here, we present a comprehensive library of complex refractive indices (n,k) for a technologically relevant set of FA based lead perovskites, spanning bromide compositions from 0 to 100 percent, and mixed Pb Sn perovskites with Sn fractions from 0 to 60 %. Using state of the art fabrication protocols that yield high quality films, we combine variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements with highly sensitive sub bandgap probes, including photothermal deflection spectroscopy for neat lead based perovskites and Fourier transform photocurrent spectroscopy for Pb Sn alloys, to reconstruct fully zeroed dielectric functions across and below the band edge. The measured data are then stitched and recalculated via a Kramers Kronig consistent framework, ensuring physically accurate behaviour across the full spectral range. Finally, we introduce a transformation based interpolation scheme that preserves spectral shape and feature alignment, enabling reliable determination of (n,k) for any intermediate composition or band gap. This complete dataset and interpolation protocol provide a standardized foundation for optical modelling of perovskite and tandem solar cells, addressing longstanding data gaps and supporting accurate simulations of next generation photovoltaic architectures.

It has been observed in numerous experiments, simulations, and various theoretical treatments that the spreading of particles can be modeled by the continuous-time random walk. We consider two well-known cases, i.e., Gaussian displacements and discrete displacements, to compute the position distribution and demonstrate the emergence of exponential decay in the far tails when a bias is introduced. We further analyze the temporal rate function and the positional rate function to examine the convergence of the theoretical predictions. For Gaussian displacements, we further discuss the relationship between the position distributions with and without bias in different asymptotic limits.

This work investigates the electronic properties of twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) through computational calculations, with the aim of understanding the emergence of flat bands and conditions favorable for superconductivity close to the magic angle. This study utilizes a k\cdot p continuum model, and the low-energy Hamiltonians are derived from angle-dependent datasets provided by Carr et al. Using this model, the band structure, density of states (DoS), and Fermi velocity are systematically calculated across a range of twist angles. The calculations are performed by discretizing high-symmetry paths in the moire Brillouin zone for band structure calculations, uniformly sampling a square grid for DoS analysis, and employing finite-difference methods to evaluate the Fermi velocity near the Dirac points. The results identify a narrow magic-angle window around $θ\approx 0.98^\circ-1.00^\circ$, where the bands become nearly dispersionless, the DoS exhibits a sharp peak, and the Fermi velocity is strongly suppressed. This computational framework does not directly predict superconductivity, but rather establishes the electronic foundation for exploring flat-band physics and correlation-driven phenomena such as unconventional superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene.

A strong correlation between zero-temperature superfluid density ($ρ_{s0}$) and transition temperature ($T_c$) is considered as a hallmark of unconventional superconductivity. However, their relationship has yet to be unveiled in nickelates due to sample inhomogeneity. Here we perform local susceptometry on an infinite-layer nickelate superconductor $Nd_{0.8}Sr_{0.2}NiO_2$. The sample shows inhomogeneous superfluid density and $T_c$ on micron-scale. The spatial statistics for different scan areas reveal a linear dependence of local $T_c$ on $ρ_{s0}$ for $T_c$&gt;8 K and a sub-linear one for $T_c$&lt;8 K. Remarkably, the overall relationship is reminiscent of that reported in overdoped cuprate superconductors, hinting at a close connection between them.

Vibrational-encoded fluorescence spectro-microscopies are emerging as powerful tools for studying molecular vibrations with the unparalleled sensitivity of fluorescence spectroscopy. We recently described one such technique, termed bond-selective fluorescence-detected infrared-excited (BonFIRE) spectro-microscopy. Currently, prospects of BonFIRE towards rational molecular design are limited, but they have the potential to be assisted by computational tools. In this Perspective, we provide a brief overview of the theory of BonFIRE spectroscopy. We then describe a fully automated computational pipeline for calculating BonFIRE spectra, reproducing key features of experimental results. Finally, we highlight a few potential applications of computational methods for vibrational-encoded fluorescence spectro-microscopies and their broader implications for chemistry and biology.

We develop a self-consistent first-principles framework for determining the screened Coulomb interaction strength (U) based on constrained dynamical mean-field theory (cDMFT). Unlike conventional approaches, this method incorporates essential vertex corrections within the same embedded-DMFT formalism used for the electronic structure calculation. Using the cDMFT-derived interaction strengths as input to embedded DMFT yields spectral functions in excellent agreement with photoemission experiments across a wide range of materials, spanning 3d to 5d transition-metal compounds, including correlated metals, Mott insulators, altermagnets, and unconventional superconductors. This unified many-body framework establishes a systematic first-principles route for determining interaction strengths in correlated materials and substantially enhances the predictive power of DFT+DMFT and its extensions.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究通过角分辨光电子能谱揭示了CoxTaS2中3Q磁序在电子结构中的直接证据，发现了"倒墨西哥帽"色散和范霍夫奇点特征。

Magnetically intercalated transition metal dichalcogenides are emerging as a rich platform for exploring exotic quantum states in van der Waals magnets. Among them, CoxTaS2 has attracted intense interest following the recent discovery of a distinctive 3Q magnetic ground state and a pronounced anomalous Hall effect below a critical doping of x=1/3, both intimately tied to cobalt concentration. To date, direct signatures of this enigmatic 3Q magnetic order in the electronic structure remain elusive. Here we report a comprehensive doping dependent angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy study that unveils these long-sought fingerprints. Our data reveal an unexpected "inverse Mexican hat" dispersion along the K-M-K direction, accompanied by two van Hove singularities. These features are consistent with theoretical predictions for a 3Q magnetic order near three-quarters band filling on a cobalt triangular lattice. These results provide evidence of 3Q magnetic order in the electronic structure, establishing TMD van der Waals magnets as tunable materials to explore the interplay between magnetism and topology.

- **TL;DR**: 量子首次检测问题研究量子系统在重复测量下首次被观测到处于目标态的时间统计特性，揭示了测量反作用导致的独特统计行为。

The quantum first-detection problem concerns the statistics of the time at which a system, subject to repeated measurements, is observed in a prescribed target state for the first time. Unlike its classical counterpart, the measurement back action intrinsic to quantum mechanics may profoundly alter the system dynamics. Here we show that it induces a distinct change in the statistics of the first-detection time. For a quantum particle in one spatial dimension subject to stroboscopic measurements, we observe an algebraic decay of the probability of the first-detection time if the particle is free, an exponential decay in the presence of a confining potential, and a time-dependent crossover between these behaviors if the particle is partially confined. This crossover reflects the purely quantum nature of the detection process, which fundamentally distinguishes it from the first-passage problem in classical systems.

- **TL;DR**: 在NiFe/GeTe范德华异质结构中实现了巨大的阻尼类扭矩电导率，达到-(1.25±0.11)×10⁵ ħ/2e Ω⁻¹m⁻¹，这是所有FM/vdW界面中最高的，可与传统重金属系统媲美。

Recent observations of large unconventional spin-orbit torques in van der Waals (vdW) materials are driving intense interest for energy-efficient spintronic applications. A key limitation of ferromagnet (FM)/vdW heterostructures is their lower value of damping-like torque conductivity ($σ{\rm_{DL}^{y}}$) compared to the conventional heavy metal-based systems, limiting their prospects for commercial spintronic devices. Here, we report both a giant $σ{\rm_{DL}^{y}}$ of $-(1.25 \pm 0.11)\times 10^{5}~\hbar/ 2e~Ω^{-1}$m$^{-1}$ and an unconventional spin-orbit torque in a heterostructure comprising an FM (Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$) and the vdW material GeTe. The value of $σ{\rm_{DL}^{y}}$ represents the highest reported torque conductivity for any FM/vdW interface and is comparable to benchmark heavy metal heterostructures. First-principles calculations reveal that this substantial torque originates from the cooperative interplay of the spin Hall effect, orbital Hall effect, and orbital Rashba effect, assisted by interfacial charge transfer. These findings demonstrate the potential of carefully engineered vdW heterostructures to achieve highly efficient electrical manipulation of magnetization at room temperature, paving the way for next-generation low-power spintronic devices.

- **TL;DR**: 通过核磁共振研究揭示了RbMn₆Bi₅的复杂磁结构和涨落，发现其相图类似于铜基和铁基超导体，具有反铁磁涨落与超导相邻的特征

Quasi-one-dimensional RbMn$_{6}$Bi$_{5}$, the first pressure-induced ternary Mn-based superconductor, exhibits a phase diagram analogous to those of cuprate and iron-based superconductors, with superconductivity neighboring antiferromagnetic order. Here, we use $^{55}$Mn and $^{87}$Rb nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to unravel its magnetic structure and fluctuations. Above the Néel temperature ($T_{\rm N}$), strong antiferromagnetic fluctuations dominate, characteristic of a paramagnetic state with pronounced spin-lattice relaxation rate enhancement. Below $T_{\rm N}$, a first-order phase transition establishes a commensurate antiferromagnetic order, where Mn atoms at the pentagon corners exhibit distinct magnetic moments with different orientations, while the central Mn atom carries no magnetic moment. The complex magnetic architecture, revealed by zero-field and high-magnetic-field NMR spectra, contrasts with earlier neutron diffraction models proposing uniform spin density waves, instead supporting localized moments ordering with charge rearrangement. The proximity of robust antiferromagnetic fluctuations to the high-pressure superconducting phase suggests a potential role for magnetic excitations in mediating unconventional Cooper pairing, akin to paradigmatic high-$T_c$ systems. These findings provide critical insights into the interplay between geometric frustration, magnetic order, and superconductivity in manganese-based materials.

Branching ratios for fragmentation channels of important meta- and unstable species are essential for a molecular-level characterization of atmospheric chemistry. Here, the molecular product channels for the decomposition dynamics of the smallest Criegee intermediate, H$_2$COO, are quantitatively investigated. Using a high-quality, full-dimensional machine learned potential energy surface (CASPT2/aug-cc-pVTZ), the translational, rotational, and vibrational energy distributions of the CO$_2$+H$_2$, H$_2$O+CO, and HCO+OH fragmentation channels were analyzed to elucidate partitioning of the available energy. The CO$_2$ + H$_2$ product forms through two different pathways that bifurcate after formation of the OCH$_2$O intermediate. Along the direct pathway, CO$_2$ is preferentially vibrationally excited with H$_2$in its vibrational ground state, whereas for the indirect pathway going through formic acid, H$_2$ can populate levels with $v &gt; 0$. For all product channels passing through energized formic acid, the lifetime distributions are described by stretched exponentials with $β$ ranging from 1.1 to 1.7. This is a clear signature of non-RRKM effects and suggests that the explicit molecular dynamics needs to be followed for a quantitative and realistic description of the photodissociation dynamics.

We investigate the impact of magnetic-field-induced feedback on the dynamics of a Hindmarsh-Rose neuron model exhibiting a blue-sky catastrophe. By introducing a magnetic flux variable that couples nonlinearly to the membrane potential, we demonstrate that electromagnetic effects profoundly reshape neuronal firing patterns and bifurcation structure. Interspike-interval bifurcation analysis reveals a nonmonotonic dependence on the magnetic coupling strength, with weak coupling preserving regular spiking and bursting, intermediate coupling promoting chaotic bursting, and strong coupling yielding structured irregular dynamics. These transitions are quantitatively characterized using the largest Lyapunov exponent computed via the Wolf algorithm and supported by Poincaré sections and time-series analysis. Our results establish electromagnetic feedback as a robust and tunable mechanism for controlling instability and chaos in slow-fast neuronal systems.

Motivated by the recent progress in the moiré superlattice systems and spin-1/2 triangular lattice antiferromagnets, we revisit the triangular-lattice spin liquids and study their magnetic responses. While the magnetic responses on the ordered phases can be mundane, the orbital magnetic flux and the Zeeman coupling have synergetic effects on the internal gauge flux generations in the relevant spin liquid phases. The former was known to induce an internal U(1) gauge flux indirectly through the charge fluctuations and ring exchange, and thus could lead to the formation of a chiral spin liquid. The latter could spontaneously generate a uniform field-dependent internal gauge flux, driving a conically-ordered state. The competition and interplay between these two field effects are discussed through a generic spin-1/2 $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_χ$ model and with the experimental consequences. Our results could find applications in the moiré superlattice systems with the Hofstadter-Hubbard model as well as the triangular lattice antiferromagnets.

Tuning and probing spin-valley coupling is key to understanding correlated ground states in 2$\it{H}$-TaS$_2$. Its magnetically intercalated analogue, Co$_{1/3}$TaS$_2$, introduces additional degrees of freedom, including modified interlayer coupling and magnetism, to modulate spin-valley physics. Surface-sensitive probes like ARPES are essential for accessing surface spin texture, yet previous studies on 2$\it{H}$-TMDs have reported conflicting results regarding spin-polarized bands, leaving open whether these discrepancies are intrinsic or extrinsic. Here we performed spatially resolved spin-ARPES measurements on 2$\it{H}$-TaS$_2$ and Co$_{1/3}$TaS$_2$. Our results reveal robust spin-valley locking on both compounds. Importantly, Co intercalation enhances interlayer hybridization and introduces magnetism while preserving the TaS$_2$-derived spin texture. We further observe a spatial reversal of the out-of-plane spin polarization, which we attribute to different surface domains. This effect complicates quantifying spin textures and may underlie prior inconsistent observations. Our findings provide microscopic insight into how interlayer interactions and surface domains together govern spin-valley phenomena in layered TMDs.

### Stochastic dynamics from maximum entropy in action space

- **TL;DR**: 该论文提出了一种基于信息论的动作空间随机动力学框架，通过最大化动作和端点的联合分布的香农熵，得到类似玻尔兹曼分布的动作空间分布，统一了经典和相对论性随机过程。

We develop an information-theoretic formulation of stochastic dynamics in which the fundamental stochastic variable is the total action connecting spacetime points, rather than individual paths. By maximizing Shannon entropy over a joint distribution of actions and endpoints, subject to normalization and a constraint on the mean action, we obtain a Boltzmann-like distribution in action space. This framework reproduces the standard Brownian propagator in the nonrelativistic limit and naturally extends to relativistic regimes, where the Wiener construction fails to preserve Lorentz covariance. The approach bypasses functional integration over paths, makes the role of entropic degeneracy explicit through an action-space density of states, and provides a transparent connection between the principle of least action and statistical inference. We derive the density of states explicitly using large deviation theory, showing that it takes a Gaussian form centered at the minimal action, and rigorously justify the saddle-point approximation in the diffusive regime. The Markovian property of the resulting propagator is verified to hold via the Chapman--Kolmogorov equation, following from the additivity of the minimal action for free-particle dynamics. In the diffusive regime, the resulting dynamics are governed by a competition between extremization of the action and entropic effects, which can be interpreted in terms of an effective action free energy. Our results establish an unified, covariant, and information-based foundation for classical and relativistic stochastic processes.

We identify a previously unrecognized spin-lattice coupling that is allowed in the presence of broken inversion symmetry that can be considered as a lattice analogue to the electronic Rashba spin-orbit coupling. In the low-frequency regime with magnons integrated out, the interfacial spin-lattice coupling is shown to engender a kineo-elastic term in the phonon Lagrangian that couples the strain on the lattice to its velocity and thereby gives rise to a nonreciprocity in transverse phonon velocity. We further analyze the full magnon-phonon spectrum and uncover directional hybridization and absorption, leading to asymmetric phonon propagation lengths for opposite directions. Our results indicate that such interfacial spin-lattice coupling can serve as an efficient route to achieve nonreciprocal phonon propagation properties in magnetic heterostructures with strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling.

We solve the two-electron problem on a square lattice with $d$-wave altermagnetism, considering both on-site and nearest-neighbor attractive interactions. The altermagnetic spin-splitting in the single-particle dispersion naturally gives rise to a ground state of two-electron bound pairs with nonzero center-of-mass momentum. This finite-momentum pairing can be interpreted as a two-body mechanism underlying the recently proposed altermagnetism-induced Fulde--Ferrell--Larkin--Ovchinnikov (FFLO) superconducting state. Additionally, when the nearest-neighbor attraction is strong, the resulting finite-momentum bound pairs exhibit a mixture of both spin-singlet and spin-triplet characteristics, suggesting the possibility of unconventional superconductors, where spin-singlet and spin-triplet pairings coexist.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文提出了一种简化的范围分离调谐方案，用于改进G₀W₀和BSE计算的起始点，无需传统多步优化过程，即可获得准确的准粒子能量和光学性质。

The accuracy of one-shot $G_0W_0$ and the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) is well known to be highly sensitive to the choice of the starting-point eigensystem, typically obtained from mean-field theory. A highly effective method explored is the use of density functional approximation (DFA) with a range-separated hybrid (RSH) approach.
  In this work, we evaluate the performance of $G_0W_0$ in predicting ionization potentials and the BSE for describing neutral excitations, employing a recently proposed, broadly applicable, and computationally efficient range-separation tuning scheme [Singh \textit{et. al.}, Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters, 16, 32, 8198-8208, (2025)]. Our results demonstrate that this simplified tuning protocol provides an accurate starting point for many-body perturbation theory, thereby eliminating the need for conventional, multi-step optimally tuned RSH optimization procedure. The resulting quasiparticle energies from $G_0W_0$ closely reproduce reference ionization potentials, while BSE calculations based on the same tuned RSH orbitals yield quantitatively accurate optical absorption spectra and excitonic properties across a range of molecular systems and clusters.

- **TL;DR**: 本文提出了一种改进的在线温度选择方法，用于优化副本交换蒙特卡洛（RXMC）算法中的温度分布，通过重新参数化技术严格保证物理约束，实现均匀接受率和减少往返时间。

The replica-exchange Monte-Carlo (RXMC) method is a powerful Markov-chain Monte-Carlo algorithm for sampling from multi-modal distributions, which are challenging for conventional methods. The sampling efficiency of the RXMC method depends highly on the selection of the temperatures, and finding optimal temperatures remains a challenge. In this study, we propose a refined online temperature selection method by extending the gradient-based optimization framework proposed previously. Building upon the existing temperature update approach, we introduce a reparameterization technique to strictly enforce physical constraints, such as the monotonic ordering of inverse temperatures, which were not explicitly addressed in the original formulation. The proposed method defines the variance of acceptance rates between adjacent replicas as a loss function, estimates its gradient using differential information from the sampling process, and optimizes the temperatures via gradient descent. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through experiments on benchmark spin systems, including the two-dimensional ferromagnetic Ising model, the two-dimensional ferromagnetic XY model, and the three-dimensional Edwards-Anderson model. Our results show that the method successfully achieves uniform acceptance rates and reduces round-trip times across the temperature space. Furthermore, our proposed method offers a significant advantage over recently proposed policy gradient method that require careful hyperparameter tuning, while simultaneously preventing the constraint violations that destabilize optimization.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文提出了一种基于Jordan-Wigner变换的自洽场方法，将自旋系统映射到费米子表示，通过Thouless旋转吸收非局域弦算符，并利用随机相位近似显著提高了平均场精度。

Mapping spins to fermions via the Jordan-Wigner (JW) transformation can render mean-field (Hartree-Fock, HF) descriptions effective for strongly correlated spin systems. As established in recent work, the application of such approaches is not limited by the nonlocal structure of JW strings or by site ordering, because string operators can be absorbed into Thouless rotations of a Slater determinant, and the variational optimization of a unitary Lie-Algebraic similarity transformation removes any ordering dependence. Leveraging these ideas, we develop a self-consistent field (SCF) scheme that expresses the mean-field energy as a functional of the single-particle density matrix, providing an alternative to gradient-based optimization of Thouless parameters. We derive the analytic orbital Hessian to diagnose HF stability and compute ground-state correlation energy through the random-phase approximation (RPA). Benchmark results for the XXZ and J1-J2 model on one- and two-dimensional lattices demonstrate that RPA significantly improves mean-field accuracy.

Patterning of precipitates along dislocation lines arising from nonequilibrium segregation during ion irradiation is investigated in model binary alloys. Lattice kinetic Monte Carlo simulations reveal that the competition between solute advection by point defects to the dislocation and thermal diffusion along the dislocation can stabilize self-organized nanostructures with distinct morphologies, including tubes and quasi-periodic necklaces. The stabilization of nano-necklaces is rationalized by heavy-tail power-law distributions for solute redistribution along the dislocation due to advection.

We consider a correlated site percolation problem on a cubic lattice of size $L^3$, with $16\le L\le 512$. The sites of an initially full lattice are removed by a random walk of ${\cal N}=uL^3$ steps. When the parameter $u$ crosses a threshold $u_c=3.15$, a large system transitions between percolating and non-percolating states. We study the $L$-dependence of the mean mass (number of sites) $M_r$ of the $r$th largest cluster, as well as $r$-dependence of $M_r$ for various system sizes $L$ at $u_c$. We demonstrate that $M_r\sim L^{5/2}/r^{5/6}$ for moderate or large $L$ and $r\gg 1$, and also conclude that for {\em any} $r$ the fractal dimensions of the clusters are $5/2$.

Klein tunneling stands as a fundamental probe of relativistic quantum transport in two-dimensional materials. We investigate this phenomenon in quadratic band-touching systems, where the Hilbert-Schmidt quantum distance plays a central role in the underlying mechanism. By employing a generic parabolic model, we systematically disentangle the cooperative effects of intrinsic mass asymmetry and tunable quantum geometry. We demonstrate that mass asymmetry sets the overall transmission profile, including the angular distribution and the resonance channels. In contrast, we show that quantum geometry provides a universal parameter that modulates tunneling efficiency by tuning the quantum distance, while leaving the energy dispersion unchanged. Specifically, quantum geometry plays a dual role: it governs the overall transmission amplitude through pseudospin mismatch, while its interplay with Fabry-Perot interference induces observable shifts in resonance angles. Our findings reveal that incorporating quantum geometry alongside band structure is essential for a complete description of quantum transport.

Flat-band superconductors provide a regime in which kinetic energy is quenched, so that pairing is governed primarily by interactions and quantum geometry. We investigate characteristic superconducting length scales in all-flat-band systems under the assumptions of time-reversal symmetry and spatially-uniform pairing, focusing on the size of the lowest-lying two-body bound state, the average Cooper-pair size, and the zero-temperature coherence length in two-band Hubbard models. Using the Creutz ladder and the $χ$ lattice as representative examples, we show that both the two-body bound-state size and the many-body Cooper-pair size remain finite and small in the weak-coupling limit, being controlled by the quantum metric of the flat bands. By contrast, the coherence length exhibits qualitatively distinct behavior, diverging in the dilute limit and in the vicinity of insulating regimes. These results demonstrate that, in flat-band superconductors, the pair size and the coherence length are fundamentally distinct physical quantities and highlight the central role of band geometry in shaping superconducting length scales when kinetic energy is quenched.

- **TL;DR**: DeepHostGuest是一个几何深度学习框架，直接从实验解析的主客体结构学习可泛化的识别原理，准确预测结合构象和自由能，超越传统对接方法。

Predicting non-covalent host-guest recognition remains challenging due to the complex interplay of electrostatics, dispersion, and steric effects, and the limited transferability of existing docking approaches to synthetic supramolecular systems. Here we present DeepHostGuest, a geometric deep-learning framework that learns generalizable recognition principles directly from experimentally resolved host-guest structures. Hosts are encoded as electrostatic surfaces and guests as molecular graphs, enabling transferable learning across diverse supramolecular systems. DeepHostGuest achieves high-accuracy predictions (RMSD $\leq 2$ Angstrom for 80.8% of test cases), substantially outperforming classical docking without case-specific tuning. Notably, the method generalizes beyond its training domain to crystalline sponge systems, accurately capturing the binding of large amphiphilic molecules within metal-organic cages. Beyond predicting binding conformations, the structures generated by DeepHostGuest serve as a reliable basis for accurate binding free-energy calculations. Density Functional Theory (DFT)-calculated affinities correlate well with experiment, enabling structure-property relationships across 876 host-guest complexes spanning 34 host families. Interpretable feature analysis reveals that binding strength arises from a cooperative interplay of host polarity, guest hydrophobicity, and geometric complementarity, with distinct design regimes across supramolecular classes. Together, these results establish data-driven molecular recognition as a practical route to predictive supramolecular design, enabling high-throughput virtual screening and rational optimization of functional host-guest systems.

Although the classification of crystalline materials can be generally handled by momentum-space-based approaches, topological classification of aperiodic materials remains an outstanding challenge, as the absence of translational symmetry renders such conventional approaches inapplicable. Here, we present a numerically efficient real-space framework for classifying parity-based $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topology in aperiodic systems based on the spectral localizer framework and the direct computation of the sign of a Pfaffian associated with a large sparse skew-symmetric matrix. Unlike projector-based or momentum-space-based approaches, our method does not rely on translational symmetry, spectral gaps in the Hamiltonian's bulk, or gapped auxiliary operators such as spin projections, and instead provides a local, energy-resolved topological invariant accompanied by an intrinsic measure of topological protection. A central contribution of this work is the development of a scalable sparse factorization algorithm that enables the reliable determination of the Pfaffian's sign for large sparse matrices, making the approach practical to realistic physical materials. We apply this framework to identify the quantum spin Hall effect in quasicrystalline class AII systems, including gapless heterostructures, and to diagnose fragile topology in a large $C_2 \mathcal{T}$-symmetric photonic quasicrystal. Overall, our results demonstrate that the spectral localizer, combined with efficient sparse numerical methods, provides a unified and robust tool for diagnosing parity-based topological phases in aperiodic electronic, photonic, and acoustic materials where conventional band-theoretic indexes are inapplicable.

Understanding unconventional superconductivity (SC) driven by strong electronic correlations is a central challenge in condensed matter physics. In this work, we employ sign-problem-free quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations to systematically investigate a bilayer fermionic model featuring strong interlayer antiferromagnetic (AFM) exchange and on-site repulsive Hubbard interactions. This system serves as a prototypical model for realizing a symmetric mass generation (SMG) insulator. Our numerically exact results unambiguously demonstrate that robust superconducting pairing emerges upon doping the SMG phase. Remarkably, we find that the SC order is significantly enhanced by the repulsive Hubbard interaction. Given its potential relevance to the essential features of the high-$T_c$ superconductor $\mathrm{La}_{3}\mathrm{Ni}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{7}$ under pressure, our study establishes a new paradigm for superconductivity arising from a doped SMG parent state and provides key theoretical guidance for future experimental investigations.

The influence of oxygen stoichiometry on the uranium local environment is explored in epitaxial single crystal uranium oxide thin films grown by DC magnetron sputtering. Through post-growth annealing, the stoichiometry of as-grown UO$_{2}$ films are tuned over an approximate stoichiometry range of $0.07 \leq x \leq 0.20$, estimated with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements of the U$-4f$ and O$-1s$ peaks. The local structure of the thin films are then probed using extended X-ray absorption fine structure measurements at the U $L_{3}$ absorption edge. We observe both the evolution of the U local environment of as a function of oxidation in UO$_{2+x}$, and that the near stoichiometric UO$_{2}$ film replicates the local structure of bulk UO$_{2}$ material standards well. The series of stoichiometrically varied samples highlights the non-trivial transitional behaviour of the UO$_{2+x}$ oxygen sublattice with increasing oxygen content in this stoichiometric regime, while also demonstrating the efficacy of this thin film synthesis route for actinide studies beyond their established use as idealised surfaces, which could be readily adapted for further stoichiometrically tailored material studies and UO$_{2+x}$ device fabrication.

We present a unified description of symmetric two-state Markov relaxation and intrinsic entanglement dynamics based on thermo-field dynamics (TFD). A classical two-state Markov process is embedded into a dissipative two-level quantum system by identifying the Markov relaxation rate with the dissipation parameter in a von Neumann equation with a relaxation term. Using the reduced extended density matrix in the TFD formalism, we explicitly separate classical thermal mixing from intrinsic quantum entanglement. For a minimal exchange-like two-level subspace, we obtain a closed-form expression for the intrinsic entanglement component, $b_{qe}(t)=\frac{1}{4}e^{-λt}\sin^2(ωt)$, demonstrating that a single classical timescale controls the decay envelope of genuine entanglement. We further show that the extended entanglement entropy naturally decomposes into a classical Shannon-type contribution and a purely quantum entanglement contribution, clarifying how stochastic relaxation constrains entanglement loss in a minimal setting.

- **TL;DR**: 提出一种利用纵向驱动制备和认证铁磁体中自旋波模式高斯量子态的方法，无需单磁子源或探测器即可实现量子磁子学实验

We propose a method to prepare and certify Gaussian quantum states of the ferromagnetic resonance spin-wave modes in ferromagnets using a longitudinal drive. Contrary to quantum optics-based strategies, our approach harnesses a purely magnonic feature - the spin-wave nonlinearity - to generate magnon squeezing. This resource is used to prepare vacuum-squeezed states, as well as entangled states between modes of different magnets coupled via a microwave cavity. We propose methods to detect such states with classical methods, such as ferromagnetic resonance or local pickup coils, and quantify the required detection efficiency. We analytically solve the case of ellipsoidal yttrium iron garnet ferrimagnets, but our method applies to a vast range of shapes and sizes. Our work enables quantum magnonics experiments without single-magnon sources or detectors (qubits), thus bringing the quantum regime within reach of the wider magnonics community.

- **TL;DR**: 在s波超导体NaAlSi中发现条纹序与超导共存，条纹序表现为四倍晶格常数的单向电荷调制，并对超导相干峰强度施加周期性调制。

Here, we report a scanning tunneling microscopy study on an s-wave superconductor NaAlSi, revealing the coexistence of stripe order and superconductivity. This stripe order manifests as a unidirectional spatial charge modulation with a commensurate period of four times the lattice constant. This modulation undergoes a phase shift in the differential conductance maps under opposite bias voltages, while its period remains approximately constant over an energy range of $\pm$50 meV. These features suggest that this stripe is likely a static charge order. Furthermore, we find that the stripe order imposes a periodic modulation on the intensity of the superconducting coherence peaks. This work provides new perspectives on the intricate interplay between stripe order and s-wave superconductivity.

Modern cryopreservation exists at the convergence of diverse disciplines--materials science, physical chemistry, mechanical engineering, biological engineering, etc.--and emerging technologies often draw from many of these disciplines simultaneously. Thermodynamics, as one of the foundational theories underlying both physical and biological science, provides a framework through which to understand these interdisciplinary technologies, yet the full kit of requisite thermodynamic tools is not housed within any one discipline. This Chapter aims to articulate a foundational thermodynamic approach to the description, interrogation, and design of modern cryopreservation technologies, and to review the state of the art in emerging cryopreservation technologies through the lens of this approach. We focus in particular on the management of phase change across equilibrium-driven techniques (e.g., liquidus tracking, partial freezing, isochoric freezing), kinetics-driven techniques (e.g. supercooling, ice seeding), and transport-driven techniques (e.g. directional freezing, droplet approaches), and we hope to equip the reader with a self-consistent theoretical toolkit that enables meaningful comparison of these techniques from a thermodynamic perspective.

### An efficient treatment of heat-flux boundary conditions in GSIS for rarefied gas flows

- **TL;DR**: 提出一种在GSIS框架内高效处理热通量边界条件的方法，通过使用麦克斯韦分布估计入射增量，再通过边界条件获得反射贡献，避免动理学-宏观边界通量不匹配，显著减少确定壁面反射气体参数所需的迭代次数。

Heat-flux boundary conditions are challenging to implement efficiently in rarefied gas flow simulations because the wall-reflected gas temperature and density must be determined dynamically during the computation. This paper aims to tackle this problem within the general synthetic iterative scheme (GSIS), where the Boltzmann kinetic equation is solved deterministically in an outer loop and macroscopic synthetic equations are solved in an inner loop. To avoid kinetic-macroscopic boundary-flux mismatch and the resulting convergence bottlenecks, for the macroscopic boundary flux at every inner iteration, the incident increment is estimated using a Maxwellian distribution, and then the reflected contribution is obtained by boundary conditions consistent with those in the kinetic solver. In addition to retaining the fast-converging and asymptotic-preserving properties of GSIS, the proposed method significantly reduces the iterations required to determine the wall-reflected gas parameters. Numerical simulations of rarefied gas flows in and around a 3D nozzle, a 2D adiabatic cylinder, and a 2D annular heat-transfer configuration show good agreement with the direct simulation Monte Carlo method, while achieving substantial efficiency gains over conventional iterative schemes.

### Charge Order in the half-filled bond-Holstein Model

- **TL;DR**: 使用行列式量子蒙特卡洛研究二维方格子上半填充的"键-Holstein"模型，发现其电荷密度波相变临界温度显著高于传统"位点-Holstein"模型，并揭示了近邻电子排斥机制。

We use determinant quantum Monte Carlo to study the half-filled `bond-Holstein' model on a square lattice. We find that the model exhibits a charge-density-wave (CDW) phase transition with a critical temperature $T_\mathrm{cdw}$ considerably higher than that of the canonical `site-Holstein' model. Using a finite-size scaling analysis of the charge structure factor $S_{\rm cdw}$, we obtain $T_\mathrm{cdw}$ to greater than one percent accuracy. At the same time, local observables also show clear signatures consistent with the transition temperatures inferred from our scaling analysis. We attribute the enhanced CDW tendencies to a phonon-mediated nearest-neighbor electron repulsion that is directly proportional to the dimensionless electron-phonon coupling $λ$ in the atomic ($t\rightarrow 0$) limit. This behavior contrasts with the site-Holstein case, where the same limit yields only an on-site attraction. We supplement our analysis with results from several unsupervised machine learning methods, which not only confirm our estimates of $T_\mathrm{cdw}$ but also provide insight into the high-temperature crossover between a metallic and bipolaron liquid regime.

### Transition Metal Dichalcogenide MoS${}_2$: oxygen and fluorine functionalization for selective plasma processing

- **TL;DR**: 通过AIMD模拟发现，氧/氟功能化可将MoS₂的溅射能量阈值从~35eV降至~10eV，非正交撞击角度(~30°)进一步降低阈值，而低温可能增加阈值，为TMD的选择性硫族元素去除提供了关键控制参数。

Low-temperature plasma processing is a promising technique for tailoring the properties of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) because it allows for precise control of radical and ion energies and fluxes. For chalcogen substitution, a key challenge is to identify the ion energy window that enables selective chalcogen removal while preserving the metal lattice. Using ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD), we demonstrate that oxygen and fluorine functionalization through thermal chemisorption significantly lowers the sputtering energy threshold ($E_{sputt}$) of MoS${}_2$ from $\sim 35$ eV to $\sim 10$ eV. In addition, we find that a non-orthogonal impact angle $\sim 30{}^{\circ}$ reduces the sputtering energy threshold, while cryogenic-range TMD temperatures may increase. To explain the observed trends, a multi-step sputtering mechanism is proposed. Our results show that oxygen/fluorine functionalization, impact angle, and material temperature are key control parameters for selective, damage-free chalcogen removal in TMD processing.

- **TL;DR**: 提出WH统计框架，统一描述具有部分可区分性的粒子系统，通过三个参数（可区分性λ、排斥权重κ、内在排斥性γ）恢复传统统计并包含任意子等新现象。

Traditional statistical mechanics is constrained by the binary paradigms of identical/distinguishable and bosonic/fermionic particle statistics, leading to a fundamental logical gap in describing systems with partial distinguishability. We propose WH Statistics, a unified theoretical framework governed by three key parameters: continuous distinguishability λ, exclusion weight \k{appa}, and intrinsic exclusivity γ. By deriving the microstate count and entropy, we show that this framework naturally recovers the Bose-Einstein, Fermi-Dirac, and Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics, while also incorporating anyons and the classical hard-core (Langmuir) limit. We introduce a class of generalized quasiparticles, termed WHons, which exhibit exotic physical phenomena including non-monotonic degeneracy pressure peaks, Schottky-like specific heat anomalies, and tunable interference effects, driven by the interplay between fractional distinguishability and exclusion. This framework bridges the century-old discontinuity between quantum and classical exclusion principles, providing a powerful tool for investigating strongly correlated systems and programmable quantum matter.

Conventional Raman spectroscopy faces inherent limitations in detecting interlayer layer breathing (LB) vibrations with inherently weak electron-phonon coupling or Raman inactivity in two-dimensional materials, hindering insights into interfacial coupling and stacking dynamics. Here we demonstrate a universal plasmon-enhanced Raman spectroscopy strategy using gold or silver nanocavities to strongly enhance and detect LB modes in multilayer graphene, hBN, and their van der Waals heterostructures. Plasmonic nanocavities even modify the linear and circular polarization selection rules of the LB vibrations. By developing an electric-field-modulated interlayer bond polarizability model, we quantitatively explain the observed intensity profiles and reveal the synergistic roles of localized plasmonic field enhancement and interfacial polarizability modulation. This model successfully describes the behavior across different material systems and nanocavity geometries. This work not only overcomes traditional detection barriers but also provides a quantitative framework for probing interlayer interactions, offering a versatile platform for investigating hidden interfacial phonons and advancing the characterization of layered quantum materials.

### Synthesizing Strong-Coupling Kohn-Luttinger Superconductivity in 2D Van der Waals materials

The Kohn-Luttinger (KL) mechanism of pairing, which describes superconductivity emergent from repulsive interactions, typically yields Cooper pairs at high angular-momentum ($\ell &gt; 0$) and extremely low transition temperatures ($T_c$). Here, we reveal an inter-layer s-wave ($\ell=0$) KL superconductivity with greatly elevated $T_c$ in a multi-layer Hubbard model, which prototypes stacked two-dimensional (2D) electrons in layered van der Waals materials. By employing determinant quantum Monte Carlo and dynamical mean-field theory simulations, we show that a strong pairing attraction $V^{*}$, without the mediation of collective modes, can emerge between inter-layer electrons in the system. As inter-layer repulsion $U$ increases, $V^{*}$ evolves from a conventional KL relation of $V^{*} \propto -U^2$, to a linear strong-coupling scaling of $V^{*} \propto -U$, resulting in enhanced superconductivity at large $U$. This strong-coupling KL pairing is robust against changes in lattice geometries and dimensionalities, and it can persist, in the presence of a large remnant Coulomb repulsion $U^{*}$ between pairing electrons. Using \textit{ab initio} calculations, we propose a few 2D layered van der Waals materials that can potentially realize and control this unconventional superconductivity.

- **TL;DR**: onepot CORE是一个包含34亿分子的枚举化学空间，通过自动化合成平台和AI化学家实现按需合成，旨在解决药物发现中"合成"步骤的瓶颈。

The design-make-test-analyze cycle in early-stage drug discovery remains constrained primarily by the "make" step: small-molecule synthesis is slow, costly, and difficult to scale or automate across diverse chemotypes. Enumerated chemical spaces aim to reduce this bottleneck by predefining synthesizable regions of chemical space from available building blocks and reliable reactions, yet existing commercial spaces are still limited by long turnaround times, narrow reaction scope, and substantial manual decision-making in route selection and execution.
  Here we present the first version of onepot CORE, an enumerated chemical space containing 3.4B molecules and corresponding on-demand synthesis product enabled by an automated synthesis platform and an AI chemist, Phil, that designs, executes, and analyzes experiments. onepot CORE is constructed by (i) selecting a reaction set commonly used in medicinal chemistry, (ii) sourcing and curating building blocks from supplier catalogs, (iii) enumerating candidate products, and (iv) applying ML-based feasibility assessment to prioritize compounds for robust execution. In the current release, the space is supported by seven reactions.
  We describe an end-to-end workflow - from route selection and automated liquid handling through workup and purification. We further report validation across operational metrics (success rate, timelines, purity, and identity), including NMR confirmation for a representative set of synthesized compounds and assay suitability demonstrated using a series of DPP4 inhibitors. Collectively, onepot CORE illustrates a path toward faster, more reliable access to diverse small molecules, supporting accelerated discovery in pharmaceuticals and beyond.

Stochastic kinetic models describe systems across biology, chemistry, and physics where discrete events and small populations render deterministic approximations inadequate. Parameter inference and inverse design in these systems require optimizing over trajectories generated by the Stochastic Simulation Algorithm, but the discrete reaction events involved are inherently non-differentiable. We present an approach based on straight-through Gumbel-Softmax estimation that maintains exact stochastic simulations in the forward pass while approximating gradients through a continuous relaxation applied only in the backward pass. We demonstrate robust performance on parameter inference in stochastic gene expression, accurately recovering kinetic rates of telegraph promoter models from both moment statistics and full steady-state distributions across diverse and challenging parameter regimes. We further demonstrate the method's applicability to inverse design problems in stochastic thermodynamics, characterizing Pareto-optimal trade-offs between non-equilibrium currents and entropy production. The ability to efficiently differentiate through exact stochastic simulations provides a foundation for systematic inference and rational design across the many domains governed by continuous-time Markov dynamics.

Correlated materials with competing spin-orbit and crystal-field interactions can host composite spin-orbital magnons that are highly susceptible to structural and electronic perturbations, enabling control of magnetic dynamics beyond spin-only physics. Using Raman spectroscopy on Ca$_2$RuO$_4$, we show that the partial substitution of Ru by Mn reconstructs the magnon spectrum and leads to one-magnon modes that are hidden in the undoped state. We demonstrate that the transition-metal substitution activates otherwise symmetry-forbidden magnon modes through mirror-symmetry breaking of the underlying spin-orbital configuration. This effect can be theoretically explained by the local structural distortions induced in the RuO$_6$ octahedra near the dopant, that enable the observation of mixed-parity one-magnon modes. The uncovered mechanism demonstrates how spin-orbit-lattice entanglement can be exploited to control collective magnetic excitations in spin-orbit correlated materials.

This paper presents the first thermodynamic assessment of binary and pseudo-binary phase diagrams in the Ba--La--S and Ga--La--S systems by means of the CALPHAD method. Experimental phase diagram equilibrium data and thermodynamic properties available from the literature were critically reviewed and assessed using thermodynamic models for the Gibbs energies of individual phases. The associated solution model was used to describe the short-range ordering behavior of the liquid phases. To supplement the limited experimental data reported in the literature, ab initio molecular dynamics calculations were employed to derive mixing enthalpies of the liquid phases in the binary subsystems. The resulting phase diagrams and calculated thermodynamic properties show good agreement with available literature within the investigated compositional ranges of binary and pseudo-binary systems.

We establish a generalized work theorem for stochastic chemical reaction networks (CRNs). By using a compensated Poisson jump process, we identify a martingale structure in a generalized entropy defined relative to an auxiliary backward process and extend nonequilibrium work relations to processes stopped at bounded arbitrary times. Our results apply to discrete, mesoscopic chemical reaction networks and remain valid for singular initial conditions and state-dependent termination events. We show how martingale properties emerge directly from the structure of reaction propensities without assuming detailed balance. Stochastic simulations of a simple chemical kinetic proofreading network are used to explore the dependence of the exponentiated entropy production on initial conditions and model parameters, validating our new work theorem relationships. Our results provide new quantitative tools for analyzing biological circuits ranging from metabolic to gene regulation pathways.

Quantum dot-superconductor hybrids have been established as a suitable platform for realizing Kitaev chains hosting Majorana bound states. Implementing these structures in a qubit architecture is expected to result in coherence times that scale exponentially with the lengths of the chains. To scale to longer systems, the phase differences between all superconducting segments in the chain need to be controlled. While this control has been demonstrated by using an external magnetic flux, ideally it can be achieved with control over intrinsic system parameters. In this work, we investigate whether the relevant phase differences can be tuned through the spin degree of freedom in each QD, or the chemical potential of the discrete bound states in the hybrid sections. We confirm that both these tuning knobs allow for controlling the phase difference in the couplings between neighbouring QDs, bypassing the requirement to tune an external flux. However, we find that the amplitude of the phase shifts can deviate from a discrete $π$-shift. We introduce a spatial variation in the spin-orbit field as a possible mechanism to explain the observed behaviour and comment on the consequences for experimentally creating long Kitaev chains.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究通过高压角度依赖电输运测量，证实了Pr4Ni3O10单晶的各向异性超导性，其各向异性参数约为1.6，并揭示了其符合双带模型的三维超导机制。

Since the discovery of high-temperature superconductivity, studying the upper critical field and its anisotropy has been crucial for understanding superconducting mechanism and guiding applications. Here we perform in situ high-pressure angular-dependent electrical transport measurements on Pr4Ni3O10 single crystals using a custom diamond anvil cell (DAC) rotator and confirming its anisotropic superconductivity. The anisotropy parameter is approximately 1.6, decreasing with increasing temperature and approaches 1 near Tc. Comparing effective mass anisotropy and inter-block distance in cuprates and iron-based superconductors (FeSCs) reveals that Pr4Ni3O10 single crystals superconductors are consistent with a two-band model, where intralayer quantum confinement within the unit cell induces interlayer coherence, thereby leading to three-dimensional (3D) superconductivity. This study not only establishes the existence of anisotropic superconductivity in bulk Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates, but also provide critical insight into the role of dimensionality in high-temperature superconductivity.

- **TL;DR**: RONEB是一种自适应混合算法，结合了NEB的双端特性和Min-Mode Following方法的加速能力，显著减少了梯度调用次数，提高了过渡态搜索效率。

Accurate determination of transition states remains central to understanding reaction kinetics. Double-ended methods like the Nudged Elastic Band (NEB) ensure relevant transition states and paths, but incur high computational costs and suffer stagnation on flat or rough potential energy surfaces. Conversely, single-ended eigenmode-following techniques offer efficiency but cannot often be constrained between specific states. Here, we present the Reorienting Off-path Nudged Elastic Bands (RONEB), an adaptive hybrid algorithm that integrates the double ended nature of the NEB with the acceleration of single ended Min-Mode Following methods. RONEB provides stability based on the history of the path optimization, relative force triggering, and an alignment-based back-off penalty to dynamically decouple the climbing image from the elastic band constraints. We benchmark the method against the standard Climbing Image NEB (CI-NEB) across the Baker-Chan transition state test set using the PET-MAD machine-learned potential and the OptBench Pt(111) heptamer island surface diffusion set. A Bayesian analysis of the performance data quantifies a median reduction in gradient calls of 46.3% [95% CrI: -54.7%, -36.9%] relative to the baseline, while surface diffusion tests reveal a 28% reduction across 59 metallic rearrangement mechanisms. These results establish RONEB as a highly effective tool for high-throughput automated chemical discovery.

CP-PAW is a combined electronic structure and ab-initio molecular dynamics code to perform mixed quantum and classical simulations of atomistic condensed phase systems, such as solids, liquids, and molecular systems. As the name suggests, the CP-PAW code unifies the all-electron projector augmented-wave method with the Car-Parrinello approach to determine not only the electronic and nuclear ground state of condensed matter, but also to study their properties and dynamics. In addition to briefly outlining the underlying theory, the focus will be on unique aspects of CP-PAW and how to correctly employ them as a user. How to install CP-PAW using the new build system will also be briefly mentioned.

- **TL;DR**: 在单杂质安德森模型中，Lanczos系数的增长模式强烈依赖于耦合结构，可以从常数到线性增长，表明Lanczos系数不能可靠地用于系统可积性或混沌性的分类。

We study the Lanczos coefficients in a quadratic model given by an impurity interacting with a multi-mode field of fermions, also known as single impurity Anderson model. We analytically derive closed expressions for the Lanczos coefficients of Majorana fermion operators of the impurity for different structures of the coupling to the hybridisation band at zero temperature. While the model remains quadratic, we find that the growth of the Lanczos coefficients structurally depends strongly on the chosen coupling. Concretely, we find $(i)$ approximately constant, $(ii)$ exactly constant, $(iii)$ square root-like as well $(iv)$ linear growth in the same model. We further argue that in fact through suitably chosen couplings, essentially arbitrary Lanczos coefficients can be obtained in this model. These altogether evince the inadequacy of the Lanczos coefficients as a reliable criterion for classifying the integrability or chaoticity of the systems. Eventually, in the wide-band limit, we find exponential decay of autocorrelation functions in all the settings $(i)-(iv)$, which demonstrates the different structures of the Lanczos coefficients not being indicative of different physical behavior.

### Direct measurement of the Orderphobic Effect

- **TL;DR**: 实验首次演示并定量测量了Orderphobic效应——一种与一级相变相关的普遍涨落诱导力，类似于临界Casimir效应但适用于一级相变系统。

Fluctuation-induced forces, such as the Critical Casimir Effect (CCE), are fundamental mechanisms driving organization and self-assembly near second-order phase transitions. The existence of a comparable, universal force for systems undergoing a first-order transition has remained an unresolved fundamental question. The proposed Orderphobic Effect is one such potential mechanism. It arises from minimisation of the interfacial free energy between solutes that locally nucleate a disordered phase. Here, we report the first experimental demonstration and quantitative measurement of the Orderphobic Effect. Using a driven, non-equilibrium quasi-2D granular fluid undergoing a first-order order-disorder transition, we show that specifically designed solutes in an ordered phase nucleate a coexisting ``bubble'' of the disordered phase. By analysing its capillary fluctuations, we confirm that this phenomenon occurs due to the proximity to phase-coexistence, and we directly quantify the attractive force by measuring the interaction free energy between solutes. The observation of this general fluctuation-mediated force in a non-equilibrium steady state strongly supports its claimed universality. Our work establishes the Orderphobic Effect as the first-order equivalent to the CCE, providing a new, general route for controlling self-assembly and aggregation in soft matter and non-equilibrium systems.

Giant Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations (SdHO) with V-shaped minima are experimentally studied in a high-mobility two-dimensional electron gas based on GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures. A phenomenological model with two parameters (transport momentum relaxation time $τ_{\text{tr}}$ and quantum scattering time $τ_q$) is developed, accurately describing experimentally measured magnetoresistance over an unexpectedly wide range of magnetic fields (up to 3.5 T) and temperatures (from 2 K to 15 K). The model combines: (i) a quasiclassical density of states with a magnetic-field-dependent Gaussian broadening of Landau levels, (ii) a momentum relaxation time scaling with the density of states, and (iii) oscillations of the Fermi level at a fixed electron density. This model reproduces V-shaped oscillation minima with zero-resistance points, a smooth background of positive magnetoresistance, and enables the extraction of $τ_q$ and $τ_{\text{tr}}$ even in microstructures where ballistic and viscous effects dominate at low fields. As expected, the temperature dependence reveals that $τ_{\text{tr}}$ scales inversely with temperature due to acoustic phonon scattering, while $τ_q$ remains temperature-independent.

The recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in pressurized Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates stimulated intense research into their correlated electron physics. Establishing the diversity of ground states across different Ruddlesden-Popper phases is crucial for elucidating the superconducting mechanisms in these nickelates. Motivated by the recent report of superconductivity in hybrid 1212-type La5Ni3O11, we synthesized and investigated the long-range-ordered hybrid 1313-type La3Ni2O7. In contrast to its bilayer counterpart, the 1313-type La3Ni2O7 exhibits characteristic semiconducting behavior at ambient pressure, displaying a distinct anomaly at 170 K. This behavior is consistently evidenced by measurements of both magnetic susceptibility and specific heat. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy unambiguously indicates a spin-density-wave transition occurring at 170 K. High-pressure electrical transport measurements demonstrate the induction of metallization under pressure, yet reveal no discernible traces of superconductivity up to 65 GPa. Our findings establish hybrid 1313-type La3Ni2O7 as a new member of the Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate family exhibiting a distinct spin-density-wave transition, and offers a new platform for investigating the interplay among crystal structure, electronic orders, and superconductivity in hybrid nickelates.

Plasmonic nanoparticles generate strongly localized and enhanced light field through localized surface plasmon resonance, thereby playing a central role in plasmonics and nanophotonics. Because the optical properties of plasmonic nanoparticles are highly sensitive to their size and shape, nanoscale visualization of nanoparticle growth is crucial for detailed understanding of growth mechanisms and precise control of particle geometry. However, it is not possible to visualize the rapid growth dynamics using conventional imaging techniques. In this study, we demonstrate in-situ real-time observation of silver nanoparticle (AgNP) growth dynamics at the single-particle level using high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM). We employed a photoreduction method, which enables reliable control of AgNP formation by laser irradiation. By integrating a stand-alone tip-scan HS-AFM with an optical setup for photoreduction, we successfully captured real-time movies showing the nucleation and subsequent growth of AgNPs at the single-particle level. Furthermore, quantitative single-particle analysis revealed particle-to-particle variations in growth dynamics. The growth dynamics were further studied at different laser intensities, revealing intensity-dependent growth rates and the balance between nucleation and growth. This study establishes HS-AFM as a novel microscopic platform for in-situ visualization of plasmonic nanoparticle growth and will contribute to advances in plasmonics and materials science.

Artificial Intelligence is rapidly transforming materials science and engineering, offering powerful tools to navigate complexity, accelerate discovery, and optimize material design in ways previously unattainable. Driven by the accelerating pace of algorithmic advancements and increasing data availability, AI is becoming an essential competency for materials researchers. This review provides a comprehensive and structured overview of the current landscape, synthesizing recent advancements and methodologies for materials scientists seeking to effectively leverage these data-driven techniques. We survey the spectrum of machine learning approaches, from traditional algorithms to advanced deep learning architectures, including CNNs, GNNs, and Transformers, alongside emerging generative AI and probabilistic models such as Gaussian Processes for uncertainty quantification. The review also examines the pivotal role of data in this field, emphasizing how effective representation and featurization strategies, spanning compositional, structural, image-based, and language-inspired approaches, combined with appropriate preprocessing, fundamentally underpin the performance of machine learning models in materials research. Persistent challenges related to data quality, quantity, and standardization, which critically impact model development and application in materials science and engineering, are also addressed.

Quantifying non-stabilizerness (``magic'') in interacting fermionic systems remains a formidable challenge, particularly for extracting high order correlations from quantum Monte Carlo simulations. In this Letter, we establish the two-point stabilizer Rényi entropy (SRE) and its mutual counterpart as robust, computationally accessible probes for detecting magic in diverse fermionic phases. By deriving local estimators suitable for advanced numerical methods, we demonstrate that these metrics effectively characterize quantum phase transitions: in the one-dimensional spinless $t$-$V$ model, they sharply identify the Luttinger liquid to charge density wave transition, while in the two-dimensional honeycomb lattice via determinant quantum Monte Carlo, they faithfully capture the critical exponents of the Gross-Neveu-Ising universality class. Furthermore, extending our analysis to the fractional quantum Hall regime, we unveil a non-trivial spatial texture of magic in the Laughlin state, revealing signatures of short-range exclusion correlations. Our results validate the two-point SRE as a versatile and sensitive diagnostic, forging a novel link between quantum resource theory, critical phenomena, and topological order in strongly correlated matter.

The spin properties of excitons and charge carriers in CsPbBr$_3$ lead halide perovskite crystals are investigated by spin-dependent light scattering in magnetic fields up to 10 T. Spin-flip Raman scattering spectra measured under resonant excitation of exciton-polaritons show a rich variety of features provided by the Zeeman splittings of excitons and of electrons and holes interacting with the excitons. The magnitudes and anisotropies of their Landé $g$-factors are measured. A detailed consideration of the responsible mechanisms is presented and discussed in relation to the experimental data, in particular on the polarization properties of the Raman spectra. We consider several mechanisms for the combined spin-flip Raman scattering processes involving resident carriers and photoexcited excitons and suggest new ones, involving trions in the intermediate scattering state. A double electron spin-flip caused by the exciton interaction with two localized or donor-bound electrons is revealed. The spectral lines of Brillouin light scattering on exciton-polaritons shift in energy and become polarization-sensitive in magnetic field, evidencing the splitting of the exciton-polariton dispersion.

We investigate a nonideal, thermodynamically consistent Brusselator reaction-diffusion (RD) system that explicitly incorporates molecular interactions among species in both the diffusion process and the underlying chemical reaction network. Within this framework, we systematically revisit the Cross-Hohenberg classification of instabilities to assess the feasibility and characteristics of the various types of instability arising from the interplay between entropic and energetic contributions. Our analysis demonstrates that only type I and type III instabilities (the Cross-Hohenberg classification) can occur in this system; Energetic contributions do not explicitly generate instabilities, but may implicitly control their occurrence through their influence on the fixed-point (steady-state) concentrations. In cases where instabilities of different types coexist, we show that the resulting patterns are highly sensitive to the relative strengths of the competing instabilities.

### Theory of Correlated Hofstadter Spectrum in Magic-Angle Graphene

The magnetic-field-induced correlated Chern insulator (CCI) states in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) have been intensively studied in experiments, but a simple and clear understanding of their origin is still lacking. Here, we propose a unified theoretical framework for the CCI states in MATBG that successfully explains most experimental observations. The key insight of our theory is that, due to the very narrow bandwidth of MATBG, correlation-enhanced valley and spin Zeeman terms are critical for shaping the intricate Hofstadter spectrum, resulting in an interwoven, flavor-resolved (spin and valley) Hofstadter spectrum that can well describe the observed CCI states. Crucially, due to the Zeeman effect, the crossings between these flavor-polarized Hofstadter spectra are magnetic-field-dependent, causing certain CCI states to emerge only above a critical field. This is the main mechanism underlying the critical field phenomenon of the CCI states observed in experiments. Our theory provides a clear and unified physical picture for the correlated Hofstadter spectrum in MATBG.

Polycrystalline thin films of $\mathrm{Nb}_{1-x}\mathrm{U}_{x}$ solid solutions with $0.15\leq x \leq 0.40$ were prepared via d.c. magnetron sputtering at ambient conditions. X-ray characterisation of the samples revealed a systematic shift of the (110) Nb Bragg reflection with U concentration, consistent with substitutional replacement of the Nb by U. Superconductivity was observed in all samples below $2$ K. Analysis of the superconducting critical fields revealed a direct scaling of the spin-orbit scattering and transport scattering times, indicating Elliott-Yafet-type spin relaxation in the system. Magnetoresistivity measurements showed a feature in the range $4$ K $\leq T \leq30$ K suggesting a possible a complex interplay between electron-electron interaction and localisation physics.

We present the data-driven coupled-cluster deep network (DDCCNet), a family of multitask, physics-enhanced deep learning architectures designed to predict coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) amplitudes and correlation energies from lower-level electronic structure methods. The three DDCCNet variants (termed as v1, v2, and v3) progressively incorporate architectural refinements ranging from parallel subnetworks for t_1 and t_2 amplitudes to feature-partitioned blocks and physics-enhanced intermediate prediction layers that are structured in accordance with coupled-cluster equations to enhance physical consistency and multitask learning efficiency. These models jointly learn correlated amplitude patterns while embedding symmetry and orbital-level interactions directly into the network structure. Applied to methanol conformers, CO2 clusters, and small organic molecules, DDCCNet_v2 delivered the most accurate and transferable performance, achieving chemically precise correlation energies across diverse molecular systems. Collectively, DDCCNet establishes a scalable, physically grounded framework that unifies machine learning and ab initio theory for efficient, data-driven electronic structure prediction.

- **TL;DR**: SmMgAl11O19是一种弱交换、近单离子三角Kramers磁体，其低温响应主要由单离子物理主导，而非集体交换，表现出各向异性的低场关联行为而无长程有序。

We report magnetic susceptibility, isothermal magnetization, and specific-heat measurements on the rare-earth hexaaluminate SmMgAl$_{11}$O$_{19}$, where Sm$^{3+}$ realizes a strongly quenched Kramers doublet on a triangular lattice with an exceptionally weak net exchange scale. The Curie--Weiss analysis yields strongly reduced ground-doublet $g$ factors, $g_{ab}\simeq 0.65$ and $g_{c}\simeq 0.70$.
  This indicates that the low-temperature response is governed primarily by single-ion physics, with crystal-field splitting and $J$-multiplet mixing jointly renormalizing the Sm$^{3+}$ moment, rather than collective exchange. For $H \parallel c$, the specific heat shows no $λ$-type anomaly down to 0.35~K but evolves into a well-defined two-level Schottky peak whose gap grows linearly with field, yielding $g_c\simeq0.62$ and recovering nearly all of $R\ln2$ at high fields, thereby confirming an effective $S_{\mathrm{eff}}=\tfrac12$ Kramers doublet description for $T\lesssim10$~K.
  Together, these results establish SmMgAl$_{11}$O$_{19}$ as a weak-exchange, nearly single-ion triangular Kramers magnet in which frustration produce an anisotropic low-field correlated regime without inducing long-range order.

Barium titanate (BaTiO3) ceramics with a different controlled content of carbon were synthesized by spark-plasma sintering (SPS) at the temperature of 1100 C in vacuum under pressure. The concentration and distribution of carbon impurity inside the samples is estimated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The resistivity vs temperature and electric field dependences of the SPS ceramics with different carbon concentration have been studied. It is shown that their conduction is determined by the variable range hopping mechanism and obeys the Mott law. The density of localized states and localization radius of the electron wave function are determined. The difference in low-temperature resistivity of the SPS ceramics is caused by carbon concentration and connected with it variation of the dielectric permittivity. The relative dielectric permittivity of the SPS ceramics is colossal and reaches the values of 10^5 - 10^6 order. The larger carbon concentration is, the smaller the permittivity and resistivity are within the Mott hopping conduction temperature range. In the range from 250 K to 408 K one observes that the dielectric permittivity strongly increases forming a maximum in all samples, which may be related to the phase transition. Along with this, resistivity manifests a simultaneous sharp decrease. The decrease of resistivity along with the characteristic dependence of resistivity vs dielectric permittivity in the Mott conduction temperature range, evidences the validity of Heywang model for the description of SPS ceramics conduction mechanisms. The resistivity strongly decreases with increasing frequency in the AC regime, which agrees both with models of hopping conduction and effects based on the Maxwell-Wagner model. The studied SPS BaTiO3 ceramics are attractive for applications in energy storage and sensorics.

We study a family of lattice-gas systems defined on semiregular grids, obtained by projecting the vertices of three different geodesic icosahedra onto a spherical surface. By using couplings up to third neighbors we explore various interaction patterns, ranging from core-corona repulsion to square-well attraction and short-range attractive, long-range repulsive potentials. The relatively small number of sites in each grid ($\sim 100$) enables us to compute the exact statistical properties of the systems as a function of temperature and chemical potential by Wang-Landau sampling. For each case considered we highlight the existence of distinct low-temperature ``phases'', featuring, among others, regular-polyhedral, cluster-crystal, and worm-like structures. We highlight similarities and differences between these motifs and those observed on the triangular lattice under the same conditions. Finally, we discuss the relevance of our results for the bottom-up realization of spherical templates with desired functionalities.

We investigate the topological electronic properties of the $K_4$ crystal by constructing a tight-binding model. The bulk band structure hosts Weyl nodes with higher and conventional chiralities ($χ= \pm 2$ and $χ= \pm 1$) located at high-symmetry points in the Brillouin zone. Through analytical evaluation of the Berry curvature, we identify the positions and chiralities of these Weyl nodes. Furthermore, slab calculations for the (001) surface reveal Fermi arcs that connect Weyl nodes of opposite chirality, including those linking $χ= \pm 2$ nodes with pairs of $χ= \mp 1$ nodes. These results demonstrate that the $K_4$ crystal is a spinless Weyl semimetal featuring topologically protected surface states originating from multiple types of Weyl nodes.

We recently proposed a unified theoretical framework for superconductivity that broadens the applicability of Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory to both conventional and unconventional superconductors. Within this framework, superconductivity arises from the formation of a symmetry-broken superconducting configuration (SCC) generated by atomic perturbations of the normal conducting configuration (NCC). The SCC emerges through electron-phonon interaction and gives rise to distinct straight one-dimensional tunnels (SODTs) in the charge density difference of electrons and/or holes. These SODTs originate from regular and systematic atomic displacements between the SCC and NCC, a phenomenon revealed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. To further verify this framework, we performed DFT-based calculations for 12 hexagonal close-packed (hcp) elements (Be, Mg, Sc, Y, Ti, Zr, Hf, Tc, Re, Ru, Os, and Zn), 5 body-centered cubic (bcc) elements (V, Nb, Ta, Mo, and W), and the compound Nb3Sn. Our results indicate that all these materials exhibit superconductivity at 0 K and 0 GPa, as evidenced by the predicted SODTs. Notably, Mg, Sc, and Y are predicted to be superconducting under ambient pressure, a finding that awaits experimental confirmation.

Harnessing strong light-matter interactions to control chemical reactions in confined electromagnetic fields offers a promising route toward deepening our understanding of chemical dynamics at the collective quantum-mechanical level, with potential implications for future chemical synthesis paradigms. Achieving this goal, however, requires an in-depth mechanistic understanding of the underlying dynamical processes. As a step in this direction, we present a systematic and numerically exact quantum dynamical study of cooperative reaction dynamics inside an optical microcavity. Using a hierarchy of model systems with increasing complexity, we elucidate how cavity-modified reactivity emerges from-and is highly sensitive to-subtle structural and environmental variations. Our models consist of optically dark reactive molecules, each represented by a symmetric double well potential, coupled to infrared-active non-reactive intramolecular or solvent vibrational modes, as well as their respective dissipative environments. Our results demonstrate that cavity-induced rate modifications arise from a delicate interplay among mode hybridization in strong-coupling regimes, the dynamical balance of all participating energy exchange processes, and quantum interference between multiple fluctuation-dissipation-mediated reaction pathways enabled by collective cavity coupling. By continuously tuning a single system parameter or introducing molecular collectivity, we observe qualitatively distinct rate modification profiles as functions of the cavity frequency, including resonant rate enhancement, resonant rate suppression, hybridization-induced peak splitting, and, notably, asymmetric Fano-type line shapes in which enhancement peaks and suppression dips coexist within a narrow resonance window, highlighting the important role of quantum interference in cavity-modified chemical reactivity.

### Disentangling the Discrepancy Between Theoretical and Experimental Curie Temperatures in Ferroelectric PbTiO$_3$

Accurately predicting the Curie temperature ($T_c$) of ferroelectrics from first principles remains a major challenge, as theoretical estimates often fall significantly below experimental values. In this work, we investigate the origin of these discrepancies in the prototypical ferroelectric PbTiO$_3$ by performing extensive constant-pressure ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations and benchmarking them against classical molecular dynamics (MD) using machine learning force fields (MLFFs) derived from first-principles data. Our results show that the underestimation of $T_c$ primarily stems from the limitations of the exchange-correlation functional, rather than inaccuracies in the MLFF fitting. We uncover a critical interplay between finite-size effects and the range of interatomic interactions: although short-range MLFFs appear to yield better agreement with experimental $T_c$, this improvement results from a fortuitous cancellation of errors. Incorporating explicit long-range interactions improves accuracy for larger supercells but ultimately leads to lower predicted $T_c$ values. These findings highlight that accurate finite-temperature predictions require not only high-quality training data and sufficiently large simulation cells, but also the explicit treatment of long-range interactions and improved exchange-correlation functionals.

### When electrons meet ferroelastic domain walls in Strontium Titanate

Strontium titanate (SrTiO$_3$), famously described by Nobel laureate K. A. Müller as the "drosophila of solid-state physics", has been extensively investigated over the last seventy five years for its intricate coupling of structural, electronic, and dielectric properties and continues to serve as a foundational platform for advancing oxide electronics. In its pristine form, SrTiO$_3$ exhibits quantum paraelectric behavior below 35 K and undergoes an antiferrodistortive phase transition near 105 K. This transition generates ferroelastic twin domains separated by a dense network of domain walls, which function as nanoscale structural defects with far-reaching consequences. While the static influence of ferroelastic domain walls on carrier transport in electron-doped SrTiO$_3$ is well established, recent experimental results show that the emergence of polarity at these walls, combined with strain fields and inherent quantum fluctuations, induces correlated dynamical phenomena such as glass-like relaxations of electrons and memory effects. In this review, we highlight these recent advances, focusing on the subtle interplay between the emergence of nanoscale polar order, quantum fluctuations, and long-range strain fields. We propose that understanding charge carrier dynamics in the background of these complex ferroelastic domain wall landscapes offers a new paradigm for exploring electronic transport in the presence of local polar order and quantum fluctuations, with broad implications for correlated oxides.

Strategies for tuning structural and (opto-)electronic properties are fundamental to the rational design of functional materials. Here, we present a molecular design approach for precisely modulating the optoelectronic properties of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) through single-atom halogen substitution on $π$-extended anthracene linkers. Using a Wurster-type tetratopic amine (W-NH$_2$) and a series of anthracene-based dialdehydes bearing H, Cl, Br, or I at the 2-position, a family of imine-linked COFs, W-A-X (X = H, Cl, Br, I), was synthesized, all displaying well-ordered porous structures. The halogen substituent strongly influences framework formation, with brominated COFs forming substantially larger crystalline domains than their chloro- and iodo-functionalized analogues. UV-vis absorption and photoluminescence measurements reveal a systematic redshift across the series $(\mathrm{H &lt; Cl &lt; Br &lt; I})$, demonstrating that a single-atom modification effectively tunes the optical response. Time-dependent density functional theory calculations on both isolated fragments and extended COF models attribute these trends to halogen-induced changes in the COF band structure and provide a mechanistic understanding of how single-atom substitution influences the optoelectronic properties of the extended $π$-framework. Overall, this study establishes single-atom halogen substitution as a powerful and modular strategy for tailoring the structural and optical properties of anthracene-based COFs.

### Renewal theory for Brownian motion across a stochastically gated interface

Stochastically gated interfaces play an important role in a variety of cellular diffusion processes. Examples include intracellular transport via stochastically gated ion channels and pores in the plasma membrane of a cell, intercellular transport between cells coupled by stochastically gated gap junctions, and oxygen transport in insect respiration. Most studies of stochastically-gated interfaces are based on macroscopic models that track the particle concentration averaged with respect to different realisations of the gate dynamics. In this paper we use renewal theory to develop a probabilistic model of single-particle Brownian motion (BM) through a stochastically gated interface. We proceed by constructing a renewal equation for 1D BM with an interface at the origin, which effectively sews together a sequence of BMs on the half-line with a totally absorbing boundary at $x=0$. Each time the particle is absorbed, the stochastic process is immediately restarted according to the following rule: if the gate is closed then BM restarts on the same side of the interface, whereas if the gate is open then BM restarts on either side of the interface with equal probability. In order to ensure that diffusion restarts in a state that avoids immediate re-absorption. we assume that whenever the particle reaches the interface it is instantaneously shifted a distance $ε$ from the origin. We explicitly solve the renewal equation for $ε&gt;0$ and show how the solution of a corresponding forward Kolmogorov equation is recovered in the limit $ε\rightarrow 0$. However, the renewal equation provides a more general mathematical framework by explicitly separating the first passage time problem of detecting the gated interface (absorption) and the subsequent rule for restarting BM. We conclude by extending the theory to higher-dimensional interfaces.

Fractional Chern insulators are lattice analogs of fractional quantum Hall states that realize fractionalized quasiparticles without an external magnetic field. A key strategy to understand and design these phases is to map Chern bands onto Landau levels (LLs). Here, we introduce a universal framework that variationally decomposes Bloch bands into generalized LLs, providing a controlled and quantitative characterization of their effective LL nature. Applying this approach to twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ modeled by first-principles-derived moiré Hamiltonians, we find that the first moiré valence band is dominated by the generalized zeroth LL across a broad range of twist angles, facilitating the formation of Abelian fractional Chern insulators in the Jain sequences. The second moiré band, renormalized via Hartree-Fock calculations at hole filling $ν_h = 2$, is dominated by the generalized first LL at twist angles $θ= 2.45^\circ$ and $2.13^\circ$. At $θ= 2.45^\circ$, we find numerical evidence for a non-Abelian Moore--Read (MR) state at $ν_h = 5/2$, with consistent signatures in both the energy spectrum and the particle entanglement spectrum. Interpolation studies further demonstrate an adiabatic connection between this state and the MR state in the conventional first LL. In contrast, at $θ= 2.13^\circ$, a charge-density-wave state prevails in the competition with the MR state due to the larger bandwidth. Our variational mapping provides a theoretical framework for exploring exotic fractionalized phases, including non-Abelian states, in realistic systems.

Correlating structure with electronic functionality is central to the engineering of quantum materials and devices whose properties depend sensitively on disorder. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) offers high spatial resolution together with access to structural, electronic, and magnetic degrees of freedom. However, electrical transport measurements on functional quantum devices remain rare, particularly at liquid helium temperature. Here, we demonstrate electrical transport measurements of niobium nitride (NbN) devices inside a TEM using a continuous-flow liquid-helium-cooled sample holder. By optimizing a thermal radiation shield to limit radiation from the nearby pole pieces of the objective lens, we achieve an estimated base sample temperature of 8-9 K, as inferred from the superconducting transition temperatures of our devices. We find that both electron beam imaging and the magnetic field of the objective lens perturb the superconducting state, because the base sample temperature is close to the superconducting transition temperature of NbN. Finally, we perform calculations that underscore the importance of cryo-shielding for minimizing thermal radiation onto the device. This capability enables correlative low-temperature TEM studies, in which structural, spectroscopic, and electrical transport data can be obtained from the same device, thereby providing a platform for probing the microscopic origins of quantum phenomena.

Understanding the relationship between molecular structure and chemical reactivity or properties is fundamental to rational molecular design. Linear free energy relationships (LFERs), particularly Hammett analysis, have long served as powerful tools in organic chemistry. Recently, these approaches have been enhanced by incorporating computationally derived parameters, enabling broader applicability across diverse molecules and reactions. To facilitate and scale this process, we present DFTDescriptorPipeline, a fully automated workflow for extracting quantum chemical descriptors from Gaussian log files and constructing structure-property and structure-reactivity relationships using multivariate linear regression (MLR) models. We validate the workflow across four case studies, including photoswitchable molecules and catalytic reactions. In each case, the models provide interpretable results, demonstrating the versatility of this approach and its relevance to a wide range of chemical contexts. We anticipate that this platform will serve as a generalizable framework for integrating quantum chemical calculations into data-driven molecular design.

In modern technology, the optical readout of magnetic information is conventionally achieved by the magneto-optical Kerr effect, i.e., the polarization rotation of reflected light. The Kerr rotation is sensitive to time-reversal symmetry breaking and generally proportional to magnetization, enabling optical readout of the up and down spin states in ferromagnets. By contrast, antiferromagnets with a collinear antiparallel spin arrangement have long been considered inactive to such magneto-optical responses, because of Tt-symmetry (time-reversal T followed by translation t symmetry) and lack of macroscopic magnetization. Here, we report the observation of giant magneto-optical Kerr effect in a room-temperature antiferromagnetic insulator alpha-Fe2O3. In this compound, the up-down and down-up spin states induce the opposite sign of spontaneous Kerr effect, whose Kerr rotation angle turned out to be exceptionally large (~ 80 mdeg, comparable to typical ferromagnets). Our first-principles calculations successfully reproduce both the absolute magnitude and spectral shape of the Kerr rotation and ellipticity with remarkable accuracy, which unambiguously proves that it originates from a Tt-symmetry-broken collinear antiferromagnetic order, rather than magnetization. This compound hosts temperature-dependent transition between easy-plane and easy-axis antiferromagnetic states, and their contrasting behaviors are also investigated in detail. The present results demonstrate that even a simple collinear antiferromagnetic order can induce a giant magneto-optical Kerr effect, and highlight Tt-symmetry-broken antiferromagnets as a promising material platform for highly sensitive optical detection of up-down and down-up spin states.

AlN-GaN heterostructures are central to high-power and high-frequency electronics, including RF devices, power converters, and AI accelerators. An intermediate Al1-xGaxN (AlGaN) layer is often present, either unintentionally during growth or intentionally to induce a 2D electron gas, yet its impact on the interfacial thermal boundary conductance (TBC) remains unknown due to the lack of reliable measurement or modeling methods. Here, we report a first principles-based evaluation of the TBCs of AlN-AlGaN, AlGaN-GaN, and AlN-AlGaN-GaN interfaces over the full alloy range. This is realized by the development of accurate deep learning interatomic potentials based on first-principles simulations. Contrary to other material systems where mixed interlayers enhance thermal coupling, we find that an AlGaN interlayer markedly degrades TBC between GaN and AlN, explaining the observation in experiments. Finally, we show that if the Al composition is sigmoidally transitioned from 0 to 1 across the AlN-GaN interface, it can remarkably increase the TBC, compared to an abrupt or a linear transition. This work is expected to shed light on an accurate thermal analysis and electro-thermal co-design of future AlGaN-based devices.

We study the thermalization properties of a fully nonlinear lattice model originally derived from the two-dimensional cubic defocusing nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLS) using analytical and numerical methods. Our analysis reveals both ergodic and nonergodic regimes; importantly, we find broad parameter ranges where the dynamics is ergodic even though it lies outside the Gibbsian parameter regime (for both $D=0.25$ and $D=2$), and a higher-energy range where ergodicity breaks down. We observe that in a certain range of parameters, the system requires non-standard statistical descriptions, indicating a breakdown of conventional thermalization. We examine the influence of the nonlinear dispersion parameter $D$ on the system's behavior, showing that increasing $D$ enhances fluctuations and speeds up the crossover of $q(T)$ toward the $\sim 1/T$ scaling. By analyzing excursion times, probability density functions, and localization patterns, we characterize transitions between ergodic and nonergodic behavior. In long-time numerical simulations within the non-ergodic regime for $D&gt;1$, stable localization over two sites is observed, while $D&lt;1$ favors single-site localization in the high energy density regimes. Our results provide insights into the interplay between thermalization, localization, and non-standard statistical behavior in genuinely nonlinear systems.

We show that magnetism in moiré Mott-Wigner crystals can be induced by the collective vibration of electrons around their equilibrium positions (i.e., electronic phonons), even without spin interactions between electrons. Due to a geometric valley-orbit coupling from the Berry phase effect, the zero-point energy of electronic phonons reaches minimum when electrons are fully valley polarized. This leads to a spontaneous magnetization when below a critical temperature. We also propose to engineer the magnetism through the photoexcitation of chiral electronic phonons.

Nickelates represent an emerging class of superconductors that demand innovative approaches for structural and electronic phase modulations. Continuous control over superconductor-insulator transition (SIT) in nickelates remains particularly challenging, hindering both fundamental understanding and potential applications. Here, we demonstrate SIT in infinite-layer nickelate superconductors utilizing multiple techniques, including an ${operando}$ monitored reduction (OMR) method. OMR enables ultrawide-range continuous modulation of the Ni 3${d}$ orbital electron occupancy from ~3${d}^7$ to ~3${d}^9$. The 3${d}$ occupancy is calibrated through systematic synchrotron X-ray absorption (XAS), combined with scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) annular bright field (ABF) analysis of oxygen atoms. SIT is further modulated via ionic liquid gating and magnetic field. Strikingly different from cuprates, our Nernst effect measurements show that pairing initiates at the onset of the resistive drop. The subsequent emergence of the Meissner effect at zero resistance marks the establishment of global phase coherence. Angle-dependent magnetotransport within the transition temperature regime indicates a mixture of two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) superconducting characters, suggesting the observed SIT deviates from the canonical 2D model. Our results provide a unique perspective on the interplay of structural and electronic phase transitions in the infinite-layer nickelates across the oxygen content-magnetic field-temperature parameter space.

For quantum spin models defined on a two-dimensional lattice, we look for the best numbering of the lattice sites (a layout) that, at fixed bond dimension and other parameters of the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm, gives the lowest value of the variational energy, maximum entropy and truncation error. We consider the conjecture that the optimal layout is a Hamiltonian path, and that it optimizes a simply computable geometric cost function. Finding the minimum of such a function, which is a variant of the minimum linear arrangement problem, provides the DMRG with an efficient layout of the lattice and improves both accuracy and convergence time. We present applications to the antiferromagnetic and spin glass spin-1/2 models on the square and triangular lattices.

Rutile Sn$_{1-x}$Ge$_x$O$_{2}$ alloys are promising materials for high-power electronic applications due to their dopability and tunable ultra-wide band gaps. We use first-principles density functional theory and statistical mechanics to investigate the crystallographic, electronic, and thermodynamic properties of rutile $\text{Sn}_{1-x}\text{Ge}_x\text{O}_2$ alloys. We predict that the lattice parameters follow Vegard's law, while band gaps calculated with the hybrid HSE06 functional exhibit strong bowing, consistent with experiment. We also predict that the disordered phase has a large positive mixing enthalpy and a slight tendency for Ge-Sn clustering, indicated by weakly negative short-range order parameters. This large positive mixing enthalpy produces a miscibility gap with a critical temperature above 2300 K, implying that the high Ge and Sn solubilities observed in thin-film synthesis cannot be explained by the incoherent phase diagram alone. We demonstrate that coherency strain during epitaxial growth substantially alters phase stability. Calculations of the coherent spinodal show significant suppression of the miscibility gap, reducing the critical temperature to $\approx 900$ K. These coherent phase boundaries account for the experimentally observed high solubilities at typical growth temperatures. Our results indicate that coherency strain stabilizes these metastable alloys and enables bandgap engineering in this ultrawide-bandgap material system.

- **TL;DR**: 提出基于随机过程加性泛函的统一理论框架，用于计算周期和倾斜周期势中的有效输运系数，涵盖可逆和非平衡稳态。

We present a unified theoretical framework for effective transport in periodic and tilted periodic potentials based on additive functionals of stochastic processes. By systematically combining the Poisson equation, corrector construction, and martingale decomposition, we show that both the long-time drift and diffusion of overdamped Brownian motion can be derived within a single and transparent scheme. In the absence of external tilt, the formalism naturally recovers the classical Lifson-Jackson formula for the effective diffusion coefficient. When a constant bias is applied, breaking detailed balance and inducing a finite stationary current, the same approach yields the Stratonovich expressions for the effective drift and diffusion in tilted periodic potentials. Beyond one dimension, we demonstrate that the same additive-functional structure extends directly to two-dimensional and general N dimensional periodic diffusions, leading to the standard homogenized drift and diffusion tensor expressed in terms of vector-valued correctors. Our derivation highlights the central role of additive functionals in separating bounded microscopic corrections from unbounded macroscopic transport and clarifies the connection between reversible and nonequilibrium steady states. This work provides a conceptually unified and mathematically controlled route to transport coefficients in periodic media, with direct relevance to stochastic transport, soft matter, and nonequilibrium statistical physics.

The interplay between the curved spacetimes of general relativity and quantum mechanical systems is an active field of research. However, analysis of relativistic gravitation on extended quantum systems remains understudied. To this end, we study here the effects of a general relativistic curved spacetime on the topological phases of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model and Kitaev superconducting wire. We find that the topological states remain robust and well localized. In the topological insulator we find that the energy level of the topological state becomes shifted away from zero according to the gravitational redshift, breaking the system's chiral symmetry. In contrast, the Majorana zero mode of the topological superconductor remains at zero energy. Furthermore, within the topological superconductor, we identify the possibility of a gravitationally induced topological phase transition leading to the formation of a domain wall, shifting one of the boundary Majorana zero modes into the bulk.

In this work we explore the possibility of using sparse statistical modeling in condensed matter physics. The procedure is employed to two well known problems: elemental superconductors and heavy fermions, and was shown that in most cases performs better than other AI methods, such as machine or deep learning. More importantly, sparse modeling has two major advantages over other methods: the ability to deal with small data sets and in particular its interpretabilty. Namely, sparse modeling can provide insight into the calculation process and allow the users to give physical interpretation of their results. We argue that many other problems in condensed matter physics would benefit from these properties of sparse statistical modeling.

We investigate the deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) candidate in the extended hard-core Bose-Hubbard model on the kagome lattice, employing quantum Monte Carlo simulations to study the entanglement entropy and the $U(1)$ disorder operator. In stark contrast to findings in $J$-$Q$ models and other candidates, the universal logarithmic correction coefficients for both quantities are found to be {positive}, consistent with a unitary conformal field theory (CFT). Crucially, the current central charge $C_J$, extracted from the small-angle behavior of the disorder operator, is enhanced by a factor of approximately {4/3} compared to that of the conventional 3D $O(2)$ Wilson-Fisher fixed point. This enhancement {implies} a consistent explanation in the recently observed low-energy excitation spectrum at this DQCP, which features {two distinct linearly dispersing modes} with a velocity ratio of approximately three. Our results provide evidence that this quantum phase transition constitutes a genuine DQCP, characterized by coexisting fractionalized excitations that collectively modify its critical properties.

Magnesium is the lightest structural alloy, yet its practical use is limited by its low ductility. Recent studies suggest ductility enhancement in dilute Mg alloys may stem from favorable solute modification of &lt;c+a&gt; pyramidal I/II screw dislocation core energy difference, activating &lt;c+a&gt; slip via a double cross-slip mechanism. This work conducts large-scale DFT calculations, reaching ~6,000 atoms, of &lt;c+a&gt; dislocation energetics in Mg and Mg-Y/Zn alloys. We find that relative solute strengthening effects on pyramidal I and II screw dislocation glide are crucial for cross-slip enhancement in Mg-Y, in contrast to prior investigations, that find solute-mediated dislocation-core energy modification as the main driver. Our predictions align with single- and poly-crystal experimental results and also capture the transition from pyramidal II to I preferred slip in Mg-Y.

- **TL;DR**: 连续时间更新过程可产生混合离散-连续结构，其中宏观粒子分数占据离散状态；集体相互作用可在无记忆重置事件中保留记忆，出现一阶动力学相变

Stochastic renewal processes are ubiquitous across physics, biology, and the social sciences. Here, we show that continuous-time renewal dynamics can naturally produce a mixed discrete-continuous structure, with a macroscopic fraction of particles occupying a discrete state. For ensembles of continuous-time random walkers subject to Poissonian renewal resets, we develop an age-structured framework showing this discrete component corresponds to localization at the reset configuration. We next show that collective interactions can retain memory although all reset events are memoryless. Remarkably, the transition to collective memory is discontinuous, and we identify a first-order dynamical phase transition between weak collective bias, where the dynamics are stationary, to strong collective bias where the dynamics are nonstationary and display aging up to finite-size effects. We explicitly discuss ecological implications of our work, illustrating how continuous-time renewal dynamics shape macroscopic structure and collective organization with long-term memory.

Probabilistic computers replace logic gates with networks of interacting random variables, creating bidirectional systems that can back-derive inputs from outputs. Such architectures enable efficient generation of random samples, implementations of novel algorithms, and natural solutions to classically hard problems such as prime factorization. We present a new physical implementation for these networks: ferromagnetic disks whose magnetization switching process is triggered by current pulses, skewed by external magnetic fields, and randomized by ambient thermal noise. We show that geometry-dependent magnetostatic interactions between these magnetic cells lead to system behavior that emulates deterministic logic gates. Furthermore, by chaining multiple "gates," we achieve a highly accurate bidirectional one-bit full-adder, a proof of concept for complex multi-gate logic functions with reversible information flow. This analog magnetic probabilistic computer methodology improves on other implementations in speed, tunability, and energy efficiency, thereby enabling a powerful new pathway towards practical solution of classically hard problems.

We introduce equations of motion for a parity-violating fermionic mean-field theory (PV-FMFT): a numerically efficient fermionic mean-field theory based on parity-violating fermionic Gaussian states (PV-FGS). This work provides explicit equations of motion for studying the real- and imaginary-time evolution of spin-1/2 Hamiltonians with arbitrary geometries and interactions. We extend previous formulations of parity-preserving fermionic mean-field theory (PP-FMFT) by including fermionic displacement operators in the variational Ansatz. Unlike PP-FMFT, PV-FMFT can be applied to general spin-1/2 Hamiltonians, describe quenches from arbitrary initial spin-1/2 product states, and compute local and non-local observables in a straight-forward manner at the same modest computational cost as PP-FMFT -- scaling as $O(N^3)$ in the worst case for a system of $N$ spins or fermionic modes. We demonstrate that PV-FMFT can exactly capture the imaginary- and real-time dynamics of non-interacting spin-1/2 Hamiltonians. We then study the post quench-dynamics of the one- and two-dimensional Ising model in presence of longitudinal and transversal fields with PV-FMFT and compute the single site magnetization and correlation functions, and compare them against results from other state-of-the-art numerical approaches. In two-dimensional spin systems, we show that the employed spin-to-fermion mapping can break rotational symmetry within the PV-FMFT description, and we discuss the resulting consequences for the calculated correlation functions. Our work introduces PV-FMFT as a benchmark for other numerical techniques and quantum simulators, and it outlines both its capabilities and its limitations.

Nanocrystals (NCs) serve as versatile building blocks for the creation of functional materials, with NC self-assembly offering opportunities to enable novel material properties. Here, we demonstrate that PbS NCs functionalized with strongly negatively charged metal chalcogenide complex (MCC) ligands, such as $Sn_2S_6^{4-}$ and $AsS_4^{3-}$, can self-assemble into all-inorganic superlattices with both long-range superlattice translational and atomic-lattice orientational order. Structural characterizations reveal that the NCs adopt unexpected edge-to-edge alignment, and numerical simulation clarifies that orientational order is thermodynamically stabilized by many-body ion correlations originating from the dense electrolyte. Furthermore, we show that the superlattices of $Sn_2S_6^{4-}$-functionalized PbS NCs can be fully disassembled back into the colloidal state, which is highly unusual for orientationally attached superlattices with atomic-lattice alignment. The reversible oriented attachment of NCs, enabling their dynamic assembly and disassembly into effectively single-crystalline superstructures, offers a pathway toward designing reconfigurable materials with adaptive and controllable electronic and optoelectronic properties.

Component systems - ensembles of realizations built from a shared repertoire of modular parts - are ubiquitous in biological, ecological, technological, and socio-cultural domains. From genomes to texts, cities, and software, these systems exhibit statistical regularities that often meet the "bona fide" requirements of laws in the physical sciences. Here, we argue that the generality and simplicity of those laws are often due to basic combinatorial or sampling constraints, raising the question of whether such patterns are actually revealing system-specific mechanisms and how we might move beyond them. To this end, we first present a unifying mathematical framework, which allows us to compare modular systems in different fields and highlights the common "null" trends as well as the system-specific uniqueness, which, arguably, are signatures of the underlying generative dynamics. Next, we can exploit the framework with statistical mechanics and modern machine-learning tools for a twofold objective. (i) Explaining why the general regularities emerge, highlighting the constraints between them and the general principles at their origins, and (ii) "subtracting" them from data, which will isolate the informative features for inferring hidden system-specific generative processes, mechanistic and causal aspects.

This study explores how entanglement and quantum teleportation of magnons can be achieved in coupled spin chain systems. By utilizing different magnetic configurations, we show that parallel spin chains function like magnonic beam splitters, whereas anti-parallel chains produce two-magnon squeezing and strong entanglement. Combining these components, we design magnonic circuits capable of continuous-variable quantum entanglement and teleportation, supported by quantum Langevin simulations.

We present a method for performing a full graph expansion for light-matter systems, utilizing the linked-cluster theorem. This method enables us to explore $1/N$ corrections to the thermodynamic limit $N\to \infty$ in the number of particles, giving us access to the mesoscopic regime. While this regime is yet largely unexplored due to the challenges of studying it with established approaches, it incorporates intriguing features, such as entanglement between light and matter that vanishes in the thermodynamic limit. As a representative application, we calculate physical quantities of the low-energy regime for the paradigmatic Dicke-Ising chain in the paramagnetic normal phase by accompanying the graph expansion with both exact diagonalization (NLCE) and perturbation theory (\pcst), benchmarking our approach against other techniques. We investigate the ground-state energy density and photon density, showing a smooth transition from the microscopic to the macroscopic regime up to the thermodynamic limit. Around the quantum critical point, we extract the $1/N$ corrections to the ground-state energy density to obtain the critical point and critical exponent using extrapolation techniques.

The degree of electronic coupling between individual layers in few-layer van der Waals heterostructures offers a route to engineer their magnetic, electronic, and optical functionalities. Using state-of-the-art first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that the electronic coupling between two monolayers of CrSBr, an anisotropic two-dimensional magnetic semiconductor, is highly nonlinear and nonmonotonic with respect to their relative twist angle, exhibiting a pronounced maximum at the twin-stacking configuration. The coupling strength scales with both the degree of overlap of Br orbitals adjacent to the van der Waals gap and the cosine of half of the interlayer spin angle. This enhanced interlayer electronic coupling gives rise to excitons delocalized across the two layers with a strong polarization dependence that reflects the details of the interlayer spin alignment. Our results reveal a sensitive interplay between twist angle, magnetism, and excitonic properties in twin-stacked CrSBr bilayers, and they establish twin stacking as an effective route to engineering interlayer coupling and optical response in anisotropic two-dimensional magnets with rectangular lattices.

Clusters formed by fluctuations of two-dimensional (2D) directed interfaces around a threshold level have been extensively studied at equilibrium and in nonequilibrium steady states, but their coarsening dynamics remain poorly understood. Here, we numerically investigate this unexplored coarsening of clusters in 2D growing interfaces believed to belong to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class. Using a two-point spatial correlator, we demonstrate statistical time invariance of the evolving configurations and identify scaling forms shared across distinct models. We reveal a pronounced asymmetry in the growth of the largest clusters: one cluster emerges as a giant structure whose characteristic length exceeds the correlation length. Population-dependent scaling forms for the number densities of cluster areas are uncovered. These findings highlight new universal aspects of growing interfaces and suggest avenues for experimental verification.

The surface half-quantum Hall effect, a hallmark consequence of axion electrodynamics, can be induced by gapping out the surface states of topological insulators through surface magnetization, and has led to a variety of topological response phenomena observed in experiments. In this work, we investigate phonon dynamics originating from an acoustic analog - the surface phonon Hall viscosity - that can also occur at the surface of magnetic topological insulators. This surface phonon Hall viscosity stems from the Nieh-Yan action in the strain response of topological insulators, where strain acts as the effective vierbein field for the bulk low-energy massive Dirac fermions. Crucially, this viscosity term entangles phonon dynamics with surface magnetization. In magnetic topological insulator films, we find that this interaction causes acoustic phonons to become chiral when the magnetization at the top and bottom surfaces is parallel, and nonreciprocal when it is anti-parallel. We further discuss potential experimental signatures of phonon dynamics induced by surface phonon Hall viscosity, specifically the phonon thermal Hall effect and magnon-polarons. Surface phonon Hall viscosity provides a mechanism to control phonon chirality and nonreciprocity via surface magnetization configurations in magnetic topological insulator films.

Single-atom catalysts (SACs) maximize atom efficiency and exhibit unique electronic structures, yet realizing precise and scalable atomic dispersion remains a key challenge. Here, we report a non-equilibrium strategy for the scalable synthesis of SACs via ion implantation, enabling precise stabilization of metal atoms on diverse supports. Using an industrial-grade ion source, wafer-scale ion implantation with milliampere-level beam currents enables high-throughput fabrication of SACs, while the synergistic energy-mass effects stabilize isolated metal atoms in situ. A library of 36 SACs was constructed, and the resulting Pt/MoS2 exhibits outstanding hydrogen evolution performance with an overpotential of only 26 mV at 10 mA cm-2 and exceptional long-term stability, surpassing commercial Pt/C. This work demonstrates ion implantation as a versatile platform bridging fundamental SACs design and scalable manufacturing, providing new opportunities for high-performance catalysts in energy conversion applications.

We investigate the spectral properties of a doped one-dimensional excitonic insulator. Employing matrix-product-state-based methods, we compute the single-particle spectrum and optical conductivity in a correlated two-band model. Our numerical calculation reveals the emergence of a correlation-driven in-gap branch in the doped state. The origin of the in-gap branch is examined by decomposing the propagation dynamics of a single particle, elucidating that the doping-induced branch is associated with excitonic correlations. Our demonstrations suggest that the doping-induced branch can serve as an indicator of electron-hole correlations.

The domain structure of a MnSb$_2$Te$_4$ single crystal with a Curie temperature $T_C \approx 45~K$ was studied using the high-resolution Bitter decoration technique. Magnetotransport measurements confirm a soft ferromagnetic ordering with a coercive field of $ \sim 100$ Oe. We revealed the formation of a hierarchical domain structure characterized by two distinct spatial scales. These results indicate the existence of two magnetically weakly coupled subsystems -- surface and bulk. The observed sub-domain structure can be attributed to the formation of a ferromagnetic well due to an inhomogeneous distribution of $\mathrm{Mn_{Sb}}$ antisite defects, with an additional contribution from symmetry breaking in the near-surface layer.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文证明了大n极限下一般图上O(n)量子转子模型与量子球模型的临界行为相同，临界指数仅取决于图的谱维度d_s。

We show that the large $n$ limit of the $O(n)$ quantum rotor model defined on a general graph has the same critical behavior as the corresponding quantum spherical model and that the critical exponents depend solely on the spectral dimension $d_s$ of the graph. To this end, we employ a classical to quantum mapping and use known results for the large $n$ limit of the classical $O(n)$ model on graphs. Away from the critical point, we discuss the interplay between the Laplacian and the Adjacency matrix in the whole parameter plane of the quantum Hamiltonian. These results allow us to paint the full picture of the $O(n)$ quantum rotor model on graphs in the large $n$ limit.

We theoretically investigate loopless multiterminal hybrid superconducting devices at odd fermion parity with time-reversal symmetry. We find that the energy-phase relationship has a double minimum corresponding to opposite windings of the superconducting phases. Spin-orbit coupling adds multi-axial spin splittings, which contrasts with two-terminal devices where spin dependence is uniaxial. Capacitive shunting localizes quantum circuit states in the wells and exponentially suppresses their splitting. For weak spin-orbit strength, the system has a four-dimensional spin-chirality low-energy subspace which can be universally controlled with electric fields only.

- **TL;DR**: 开发了统一的INTERFACE力场参数化方法和pH分辨表面模型数据库，为氧化铝相提供最准确的原子尺度描述，实现跨pH值的表面电离和电荷调控模拟。

Alumina and aluminum oxyhydroxides underpin chemical-engineering technologies from heterogeneous catalysis, corrosion protection, functional coatings, energy-storage devices, to biomedical components. Yet molecular models that predictively connect phase structure, pH-dependent surface chemistry, electrolyte organization, and adsorption across operating conditions remain limited. Here we introduce a unified INTERFACE Force Field (IFF) parameterization together with a curated, ready-to-use pH-resolved surface model database that provides the most accurate and transferable atomistic description of major alumina phases to date. The framework covers a-Al2O3, g-Al2O3, boehmite, diaspore, and gibbsite using a single, physically interpretable parameter set that is directly compatible with CHARMM, AMBER, OPLS-AA, CVFF, and PCFF. Across structural, thermodynamic, mechanical, and interfacial benchmarks, simulations reproduce experimental reference data with more than 95 percent accuracy, exceeding existing force fields and the reliability of current density-functional approaches. A key advance is the first transferable treatment of surface ionization and charge regulation across alumina phases over a broad range of pH values, enabling simulations of realistic solid electrolyte interfaces without phase-specific reparameterization. Quantitative reliability is demonstrated by reproducing trends in zeta potentials and pH-dependent adsorption of a corrosion inhibitor at alumina-water interfaces. Predicted adsorption free energies and surface contact times correlate with experiments across more than an order of magnitude. Relative to ML-DFT workflows, the speed 100 to 1000 times faster, reaching system sizes and time scales inaccessible to quantum methods. The results establish a predictive computational platform to design alumina-containing functional materials under realistic process conditions.

- **TL;DR**: 在拓扑多带系统中，占据带会合并成一个有效单带，其总陈数为各占据带陈数之和，这导致在整数填充因子下出现分数陈绝缘体态，而非传统的1+ν'图像。

Most fractional quantum Hall states have been traditionally identified within a single energy band, such as the lowest Landau level or topological flat band. As more particles are introduced, they inevitably populate higher energy bands. Whether the inclusion of multiple topological bands leads to new physics remains an open question. Here, we propose a universal picture applicable at higher filling factors $ν\geq 1$ in bosonic systems: the occupied bands tend to coalesce into an effective single topological band characterized by a total Chern number $\vert C\vert$, the sum of the Chern number of all occupied lower topological flat bands. Using a Kekulé lattice model with two lower flat bands featuring a total Chern number $C=1$, regardless of their specific configurations, we identify the emergence of a $\frac{1}{2}$ fractional Chern insulator (FCI) state at integer filling factor $ν=1$, followed by the Jain sequence states $\frac{2}{3}$ and $\frac{3}{4}$ at filling $ν=\frac{4}{3}$ and $\frac{6}{4}$. That is a $ν+ν$ picture, rather than the generally expected $1+ν^{\prime}$ picture, where $ν^{\prime}$ is the permitted FCI filling factor in the single second topological flat band. Our findings deepen the understanding of FCI states and open avenues for discovering exotic fractional topological phases in multiband systems.

### Transition from conventional ferroelectricity to ion-conduction-like ferroelectricity

- **TL;DR**: 论文提出了一个通用模型，将铁电性分为I型和II型长位移铁电体，解释了从典型铁电性到长位移铁电性的演化与转变。

The cross-unitcell long displacements in some recent emergent ferroelectrics have actually challenged the classical definition of ferroelectricity, while the relative explorations are still in the early stage and even controversial. In this paper we provide a general model that gives the picture for the evolution and transition from typical ferroelectricity to long displacement ferroelectricity, which is classified into type-I and type-II. In particular, type-I with two switching modes of different barriers may switch between conventional ferroelectricity and ion-conduction-like ferroelectricity depending on various factors including electric field, boundaries, vacancies, temperature, etc.., which is demonstrated by first-principles calculations on γ-AlOOH and CuInP2S6 as two paradigmatic cases. Intriguingly, their polarizations are nonlocal since the boundaries also determine the switching mode and polarization direction, which can be different for the same given crystal structure. Such type-I can be evolved from conventional ferroelectricity as the migration barrier across unitcell is reduced, and will behave like type-II at elevated temperature as the conventional part becomes paraelectric. These unconventional behaviors can be applicable to various systems, and many previously unclarified phenomena can be well explained.

- **TL;DR**: 铂纳米线通过FEBID沉积后，热退火处理使电导率提高5个数量级，成为适用于毫开尔文温度纳米电子器件的理想材料

We investigated the electrical conductivity of platinum nanowires with heights ranging from 2 nm to 200 nm, deposited by focused electron beam induced deposition (FEBID). Post-deposition processing was employed to enhance the electrical conductivity of the platinum nanowires. Thermal annealing of as-deposited nanowires in air at 225$^{\circ}$C for 4 hours increased electrical conductance by up to five orders of magnitude. After annealing, 22.5 $\mathrm{μm}$-long nanowires with a height of 36 nm exhibited resistances of approximately 10 k$Ω$. This nanowire underwent a reduction in height to one-quarter of its original value, a reduction in width to one half, and a reduction in cross-sectional area by approximately one order of magnitude. The platinum-to-carbon weight ratio increased from 35:65 to 85:15. The electrical resistance decreased monotonically as temperature was lowered from room temperature to 100 mK, confirming that annealed FEBID platinum nanowires are promising building blocks for nanoelectronic devices operating at millikelvin temperatures.

### Altermagnetic phases and phase transitions in Lieb-$5$ Hubbard model

- **TL;DR**: 在Lieb-5晶格上的排斥Hubbard模型中发现了交变磁性（altermagnetism）有序，包括交变磁性孤立带金属相（AMIM）和交变磁性金属相（AMM），这些相由Hubbard相互作用和跳跃积分驱动，并在自旋轨道耦合和温度下保持稳定。

The emergence of altermagnetism, the collinear magnetic phase characterized by momentum-dependent spin-split bands but zero net magnetization, has fundamentally reshaped the classification of magnetic order. We propose an altermagnetic (AM) order in a repulsive Hubbard model on the Lieb-$5$ lattice. Considering only nearest-neighbor hoppings within the lattice, we show a phase transition from the nonmagnetic to a unique AM isolated band metal phase (AMIM), allowing clear identification of spin-split states. Additionally, the AM metallic phase (AMM) is also shown to appear as an intermediate phase during the transition from the normal metal to the AMIM in the presence of the diagonal hopping within each unit cell of the Lieb-$5$ lattice. The manifestation of distinct AM phases and the phase transitions, driven by Hubbard interaction and hopping integrals, have been explored in terms of spin-resolved band structure, spectral function, and the behavior of the AM order parameter. The stability of these AM phases against the spin-orbit coupling and temperature is also established.

- **TL;DR**: 研究在200纳米厚的悬浮铌酸锂薄膜中实现GHz频率Lamb波谐振腔，在单声子水平达到约6000的本征品质因数，并评估其作为量子声学器件的潜力。

Phononic nanodevices offer a promising route toward quantum technologies, as phonons combine strong confinement within matter with broad coupling capabilities to various quantum systems. In particular, the piezoelectric response of materials such as lithium niobate enables coupling between superconducting qubits and gigahertz-frequency phonons. However, bulk lithium niobate phononic devices typically rely on surface acoustic waves and are therefore inherently subject to leakage from the surface into the bulk substrate. Here, we explore the acoustic behavior of resonator cavities supporting GHz-frequency Lamb waves in a 200 nm-thick suspended lithium niobate layer. We characterize the acoustic response at both room and millikelvin temperatures. We find that our resonator cavities with strong confinement reach intrinsic quality factors of approximately 6000 at the single phonon level. We use the measured parameters of the resonators to model their coupling to a superconducting transmon qubit, allowing us to evaluate their potential as quantum acoustic devices.

- **TL;DR**: 研究通过NAP-XPS和DFT发现CO₂在473K以上可吸附到有缺陷的ZnS表面，锌空位是关键吸附位点，缺陷表面氧吸附为放热过程。

In this work, we investigate $CO_{2}$ activation on ZnS using Near Ambient-Pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements (NAP-XPS) and density functional theory calculations (DFT). Our NAP-XPS experiments reveal that $CO_{2}$ adsorbs onto a defective ZnS surface upon heating above $473 \ K$ in a $CO_{2}$ atmosphere (up to $0.55 \ mbar$). The $CO_{2}$ adsorption fingerprint is detectable even after cooling to room temperature under ultra-high vacuum. Our DFT calculations suggest that $CO_{2}$ adsorption is energetically favorable on ZnS surfaces containing zinc vacancies, highlighting defect sites as key adsorption centers. Additionally, oxygen adsorption on a defective ZnS surface is exothermic, in contrast to the endothermic behavior observed on a defect-free surface. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of defect-driven surface reactivity and may inform ZnS-based catalyst's design for $CO_{2}$ capture and reutilization.

Integer and fractional Chern insulators exhibit a nonzero quantized anomalous Hall conductivity due to a spontaneous breaking of time reversal symmetry. To identify nontrivial topology in their time-reversal symmetric many-body spectra, we introduce many-body Euler numbers as a counterpart to many-body Chern numbers. Exemplarily, we perform calculations in a topological Hubbard model that can realize Chern and fractional Chern insulating phases. Furthermore, we lay out a classification scheme to realize different topological phases in interacting systems using symmetry indicators in analogy to topological band theory.

- **TL;DR**: 提出一种基于散射边界条件的Kohn-Sham方程求解方法，用于高效模拟角分辨光电子能谱，可直接计算光电子矩阵元，在石墨烯和WSe₂中验证了准确性。

We introduce an efficient first-principles framework for simulating angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) by computing photoelectron states as solutions of the Kohn-Sham equation with scattering boundary conditions. This approach is formally equivalent to the Lippmann-Schwinger formalism but offers superior computational efficiency and direct integration with plane-wave or real-space density functional theory. By enabling direct calculation of photoemission matrix elements, our method bridges the gap between intrinsic electronic properties and experimental ARPES spectra. We demonstrate its accuracy through circular dichroism ARPES simulations for monolayer graphene and bulk $2H$-WSe$_2$, achieving excellent agreement with experimental data and highlighting the critical role of pseudopotentials in describing high-energy photoelectron scattering. Our results establish a robust and accessible route for quantitative ARPES modeling, paving the way for advanced studies of orbital textures, many-body effects, and time-resolved photoemission.

The coupling of spin and electronic degrees of freedom via the spin-orbit interaction (SOI) is an essential ingredient for many proposed future technologies. However, probing the strength and nature of SOI is a significant challenge, especially in heterostructures. Here, we consider the nonlinear Shubnikov-de Haas (NSdH) effect, a quantum oscillatory effect that occurs under conditions similar to those of the well-known SdH effect, but is second order in the applied electric field. We demonstrate that, unlike its linear counterpart, the NSdH effect is highly sensitive to the spin textures that arise from SOI. In particular, we show that the phase and beating of NSdH oscillations in nonlinear conductivities can clearly distinguish between different types of SOI. As a demonstration, we show how NSdH can distinguish between the linear and cubic Rashba couplings that are expected in germanium heterostructures. Our results establish the NSdH effect as a powerful and sensitive probe of SOI, offering a new framework for characterizing materials relevant to topology, spintronics, and solid-state quantum information technologies.

We studied transport of indirect excitons (IXs) and IX mediated spin transport in a MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ van der Waals heterostructure in magnetic fields up to 8 T. We observed the long-range IX transport and the long-range IX mediated spin transport in the magnetic fields. The IX transport and spin transport are characterized by the 1/e decay distances reaching $\sim$ 100 micrometers. The decay distance of the spin transport correlates with the decay distance of IX transport. These decay distances first increase and then decrease with increasing IX density for all studied magnetic fields. The long-range IX transport and the long-range spin transport in the magnetic fields are consistent with the similar long-range transport in zero magnetic field.

### Quantum theory of elastic strings and the thermal conductivity of glasses

- **TL;DR**: 该研究通过构建包含传播声子和扩展Volterra位错线的连续介质模型，解释了非晶固体中热导率的线性上升现象，并将位错分布与实验观测的玻色峰联系起来。

We study the thermal conductivity of amorphous solids by constructing a continuum model whose degrees of freedom are propagating vibrational modes (phonons) and extended Volterra dislocation line defects with their own vibrational degrees of freedom which do not propagate in space. Our working assumption is that these additional degrees of freedom account for the "boson peak" that is observed in glassy materials. This identification allows us to obtain the length distribution of dislocations from experimental data of the boson peak for each material, which we use as input to calculate the phonon self-energy in a quantum field theory framework using that the phonon-dislocation interaction is given by the Peach-Koehler force. The tail of the distribution for long dislocations is consistent with an $L^{-5}$ power law. Our results show that this power law yields a linear rise in the thermal conductivity, as observed in glasses at low temperatures. We then consider two approaches to describe thermal conductivity data quantitatively. In the simplest approach we only keep the low-frequency behavior of the phonon self-energy with one free parameter, plus an adjustable UV cutoff. In the more realistic approach we keep the full frequency dependence of the phonon self-energy as dictated by the phonon-dislocation interaction plus an additional contribution due to scattering with point defects, with a cutoff set by the typical interatomic spacing of the material. We obtain a satisfactory description of thermal conductivity data with both approaches. We conclude by discussing prospects to test the predictive power of this model.

In recent years, the planar Hall effect (PHE) has become a key probe of Berry curvature and the anomalous Hall effect (AHE). Threefold-symmetric signals under in-plane fields are often attributed to such quantum mechanisms. Here, we establish a purely classical origin for a three-fold-symmetric PHE. The idea is simple yet decisive: a third-order expansion of the Boltzmann equation in the magnetic field reveals that the threefold component originates from the relative positions of the mirror planes in the crystals with respect to the measurement setups. Remarkably, the threefold contribution should be ubiquitous because this symmetry condition can be realized across a broad range of crystals. Numerical estimates based on concrete models further show that its amplitude is comparable to that expected from the AHE.

Reproducibility of computational results remains a challenge in materials science, as simulation workflows and parameters are often reported only in unstructured text and tables. While literature data are valuable for validation and reuse, the lack of machine-readable workflow descriptions prevents large-scale curation and systematic comparison. Existing text-mining approaches are insufficient to extract complete computational workflows with their associated parameters. An ontology-driven, large language model (LLM)-assisted framework is introduced for the automated extraction and structuring of computational workflows from the literature. The approach focuses on density functional theory-based stacking fault energy (SFE) calculations in hexagonal close-packed magnesium and its binary alloys, and uses a multi-stage filtering strategy together with prompt-engineered LLM extraction applied to method sections and tables. Extracted information is unified into a canonical schema and aligned with established materials ontologies (CMSO, ASMO, and PLDO), enabling the construction of a knowledge graph using atomRDF. The resulting knowledge graph enables systematic comparison of reported SFE values and supports the structured reuse of computational protocols. While full computational reproducibility is still constrained by missing or implicit metadata, the framework provides a foundation for organizing and contextualizing published results in a semantically interoperable form, thereby improving transparency and reusability of computational materials data.

Twisted bilayer systems host a wealth of emergent phenomena, such as flat-band superconductivity, ferromagnetism, and ferroelectricity, arising from moiré superlattices and unconventional interlayer coupling. Despite their central role, direct and quantitative access to the out-of-plane atomic structure in these systems has remained elusive due to their nanoscale dimensions. Here, we introduce an automated dark-field electron tomography technique that enables three-dimensional structural analysis of atomically thin materials with sub-angstrom precision. Applying this method to twisted bilayer WSe$_2$, we uncover a significant expansion of the interlayer spacing compared to the bulk configuration, exceeding 0.1 angstrom, along with a remarkable temperature-driven interlayer decoupling unique to the twisted bilayer. Ultrafast measurement further reveals optically induced interlayer separation of ~0.2 angstrom on the picosecond timescale, attributed to transient exciton formation. These findings not only establish a powerful approach for visualizing hidden out-of-plane structures in atomically thin micro-flake materials, but also uncover the intrinsic fragility and dynamical tunability of interlayer coupling in moiré-engineered 2-dimensional materials.

Electron backscatter diffraction is one of the most prevalent techniques used for microstructural characterization. In recent years, there has been an increase in the use of data-driven methods to analyze raw Kikuchi patterns. However, most of these require user input and the interpretation of the data-derived features is often challenging and subject to \textit{informed interpretation}. By using a combination of principal component analysis, constrained non-negative matrix factorization, and a variational autoencoder along with information-theoretical considerations on a multimodal dataset, it is shown that a) automated decision on method-specific hyperparameters, here the number of components in principal component analysis, the number of components for constrained non-negative matrix factorization, and the selection of reference constraints; and b) latent space features can be mapped to physically-meaningful quantities. In addition, the recommended region-of-interest (ROI) size for optimal model performance is approximated automatically to be twice the characteristic grain size based on information content of the dataset. Implemented in a workflow, this allows for a transferable, dataset-specific autonomous data-driven phase and grain segmentation including grain boundary detection and the analysis of very-small-angle intra-grain variations to complement conventional electron backscatter analysis.

This work theoretically demonstrates that a spin qubit in a parabolic quantum wire driven by a bichromatic field exhibits a confinement-tunable synthetic gauge field, leading to novel Floquet topological phenomena. The study presents the underlying mechanism for topological protection of qubit states against time-periodic perturbations. The analysis reveals a confinement-induced topological Landau-Zener transition, marked by a shift from preserved symmetries to chiral interference patterns in Landau-Zener-St$\ddot{u}$ckelberg-Majorana interferometry. Notably, the emergence of non-Abelian geometric phases under cyclic evolution in curved confinement and phase-parameter space is identified, enabling holonomic quantum computation. Additionally, the prediction of unconventional Floquet-Bloch oscillations in the quasi-energy and resonance transition probability spectra as a function of the biharmonic phase indicates exotic properties, including fractal spectra and fractional Floquet tunneling. These phenomena provide direct evidence of coherent transport in the synthetic dimension. Collectively, these findings position quantum wire materials has a versatile platform for Floquet engineering, topological quantum control, and fault-tolerant quantum information processing.

- **TL;DR**: 通过调控铜氧化态增强CuOₓ基异质结中的轨道电流和自旋轨道转矩，效率比传统重金属高近10倍

Current-induced spin-orbit torque (SOT) plays a crucial role in the next-generation spin-orbitronics. Enhancing its efficiency is both fundamentally and practically interesting and remains a challenge to date. Recently, orbital counterparts of spin effects that do not rely on the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) have been found as an alternative mechanism to realize it. This work highlights the engineering of copper oxidation states for manipulating the orbital current and its torque in the CuO$_x$-based heterostructures. The orbital hybridization and thus the orbital-Rashba-Edelstein effect at the CuO$_x$/Cu interfaces are significantly enhanced by increasing the copper oxidation state, yielding a torque efficiency that is almost ten times larger than the conventional heavy metals. The Cu$_4$O$_3$/Cu interface, rather than the widely accepted CuO/Cu interface, is revealed to account for the enhanced SOT performance in the CuO$_x$-based heterostructures. In addition, the torque efficiency can be alternatively switched between high and low thresholds through the redox reaction. The current results establish an exotic and robust strategy for engineering the orbital current and SOT for spin-orbitronics, which applies to other weak-SOC materials.

- **TL;DR**: 开发了一种改进的垂直布里奇曼技术，结合高压液态封装和硒助熔剂，成功生长出低载流子密度、高质量的单相α-In₂Se₃单晶

Indium selenide (In$_2$Se$_3$) has garnered significant attention for its intriguing properties and applications in batteries, solar cells, photodetectors and ferroelectric devices. However, the controlled synthesis of single phase $α$-In$_2$Se$_3$ remains challenging owing to its complex phase diagram, presence of multiple polymorphs and the high volatility of selenium that induces non-stoichiometry and unintentional carrier doping. For ferroelectric α-In2Se3, minimizing the carrier density is essential because leakage current can obscure polarization switching. Here, we report the growth of $α$-In$_2$Se$_3$ single crystals using a unique approach, the Se-flux assisted modified vertical Bridgman technique combined with liquid encapsulation under high pressure. This approach creates a high-pressure, Se-rich environment that effectively minimizes Se-vaporization. Structural and compositional analysis using X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy confirm the formation of pure $α$-In$_2$Se$_3$ single crystals with 3R stacking. Furthermore, the crystals exhibit remarkably low carrier density of 1.5-3.2 $\times$ 10$^{16}$ cm$^{-3}$ at 300K$-$the lowest reported to date, reflecting a significant suppression of Se-vacancies relative to the conventional Bridgman or melt-grown crystals. Through transport and ARPES measurements on different batches of crystals, we also demonstrate that the amount of Se-flux plays a crucial role in controlling Se-vacancies. Our results thus establish this modified Bridgman method as an effective strategy for synthesizing large $α$-In$_2$Se$_3$ single crystals with reduced intrinsic defects. This technique can be broadly applied to grow other volatile chalcogenides with reduced defects and controlled stoichiometry.

Contact electrification give rise to charge accumulation at the interface when two materials are brought into contact with each other. The charge accumulation at the interface will diffuse to the interior of the conducting material if the dimensions of the contacting conducting material is of the order of an unknown critical length scale. This contact electrification induced interlayer charge transfer will modify the fundamental physical properties of both the contacting materials. This review first discusses the reported experimental evidence of flexoelectricity induced contact electrification and interlayer charge transfer in conducting thin film based heterostructures. The interlayer charge transfer creates a gradient of charge carrier in both the thin films constituting the heterostructure and also modifies the electron-electron interactions. Further, the interlayer charge transfer changes the electron-phonon coupling, spin-phonon coupling and magnetoelectronic coupling that give rise to new physical behavior, which did not exist prior to the interlayer charge transfer. The new physical behaviors from interlayer charge transfer and their mechanistic origins are reanalyzed and discussed, which include spin-Hall effect of charge carriers, topological Hall effect of magnetoelectronic electromagnon, inhomogeneous magnetoelectronic multiferroic effect, flexoelectronic proximity effect and topological spin texture. This review article presents a unified picture of current status and future directions that will provide the scientists a stepping stone for research in the field of flexoelectricity mediated contact electrification and interlayer charge transfer mediated behavior in the micro/nanoscale heterostructures of the conducting materials.

Molecular spins are a versatile platform for quantum sensing. Not only are the spin-bearing molecules themselves widely tunable, they are also capable of being used as sensors as crystals, films and in solution. Using thin-films offers the advantages of high doping ratios and the ability to control the thickness with nanometre precision, however they also introduce disorder to the system. High proximity sensing can also be realised by using micro- and nano-crystals, however in many solid-state systems this leads to a reduction in coherence. In this paper we combine room-temperature optically detected coherent control of molecular spins and microscopy to image the coherence properties of both thin-films and micro-crystals of pentacene doped p-terphenyl. In thin-films we find large amounts of variation in both the contrast and coherence times, leading to a variability in the magnetic field sensitivity of approximately 7.6 %. Applying the technique to micro-crystals shows much lower sensitivity variability (1.3 %), and we find no evidence of coherence loss toward the edge of the crystal. Finally we perform optically-detected coherent control on a nano-crystal, showing minimal loss in coherence and contrast compared to the bulk crystal, with a coherence time of 1.09 μs and a contrast of 25 %.

The quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulator is uniquely characterized by the topological Chern number C. Controlling the Chern number is a key step toward functional topological electronics and enables access to exotic quantum phases beyond the traditional quantum Hall physics. Here, we report a series of QAH insulators in twisted rhombohedral graphene family, in which the Chern number can be tuned through layer configuration, in-situ electrostatic doping, and displacement field. Specifically, in twisted monolayer-rhombohedral N-layer graphene, denoted as (1+N) L, we observe QAH states with C=N at moire filling v=1, where N=3,4,5 represents the layer number of rhombohedral graphene. These results are experimentally confirmed by quantized Hall resistance and the Streda formula. In twisted monolayer-trilayer graphene, we also observe states with |C|=3 at v=3, whose sign can be switched by either electrostatic doping or displacement field. Furthermore, in twisted Bernal bilayer-rhombohedral tetralayer graphene denoted as (2+4) L, we demonstrate a displacement-field-driven topological phase transition between two distinct QAH states with C=3 and C=4 at v=1. Our work establishes twisted rhombohedral graphene as a highly versatile, layer-engineered platform for designing and dynamically controlling high-Chern-number topological matters.

The use of polymer nanocomposites as gas barrier materials has seen increasing interest, including applications involving hydrogen transport and storage. Better understanding of gas transport through those polymeric systems requires 3D nanoscale detection of distributions and the possible trapping of gas molecules within nanoparticles and polymer/nanoparticle interfaces While atom probe tomography (APT) offers promising means for such nanoscale characterisation, its use for polymers has been mainly limited to thin organic layers deposited onto substrates or pre-fabricated metal needle shaped specimens. This work provides the very first application of APT to bulk polymer nanocomposites. Particularly, site specific atom probe sample preparation by Focused Ion Beam (FIB) liftout has been shown for the first time in a model system of hexagonal boron nanoparticles within a PVDF polymer matrix, using a variety of FIB workflows including Xe FIB, Ga FIB, cryogenic Ga FIB and deuterium charging. Mass spectra from the bulk polymer and the nanoparticle were collected using pulsed laser atom probe using standard conditions and compared. Several challenges encountered during this research including damage of the polymeric matrix during sample preparation were extensively discussed in this paper. Once those challenges have been resolved (e.g. by developing site specific sample preparation protocols), the application of APT to polymer nanocomposites can open new options for nanoscale characterisation of those systems.

We propose an electrically controlled protocol to detect weak Lorentz-violating (LV) backgrounds through the second-order shift photocurrent in noncentrosymmetric crystals. Using a spinful Rice--Mele model, we show that a stationary LV background induces a momentum-odd correction to the Bloch Hamiltonian, which generates an odd-in-field contribution to the shift current. This leads to a directional asymmetry, whereby the photocurrent distinguishes opposite orientations of an applied static field. The effect originates from an LV-induced deformation of the interband phase and can be isolated experimentally by comparing field-reversed configurations, with vanishing response at transverse orientations, providing an internal consistency check. Our results demonstrate that nonlinear optical responses offer a practical and symmetry-selective route for probing LV effects in solid-state systems.

The vibrational landscape of adsorbed molecules is central to understanding surface interactions at the atomic scale, influencing phenomena from catalysis to molecular electronics. Recent advances in atomic-scale tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) have enabled vibrational mapping of single molecules with sub-nanometer spatial resolution, providing unprecedented insights into molecule-surface interactions by confining light in plasmonic picocavities. Here, we exploit TERS in a cryogenic scanning tunneling microscope junction to perform Raman hyperspectral mapping of single iron phthalocyanine (FePc) molecules in three non-equivalent adsorption configurations on Ag surfaces. We explore the changes in the vibrational modes of FePc molecules adsorbed on two distinct silver crystal terminations with differing symmetry, Ag(111) and Ag(110), revealing how subtle variations in the adsorption geometry due to substrate anisotropy can strongly influence molecular vibrations, lifting the degeneracy of individual normal modes. Our findings not only demonstrate the first use of sub-nanometer TERS mapping across different symmetry configurations but also provide a deeper understanding of how site-specific vibrational properties are intimately linked to local atomic environments. This capability paves the way for precisely tailoring surface interactions and controlling chemical reactions at the atomic scale.

Porous nanocarbon materials are seen as potential excellent materials for hydrogen storage due to their high surface area, excellent cycling stability and favorable kinetics. This study employs Density Functional Theory (DFT) simulations to investigate key property of Li$^-$ and Na$^-$ modified PHE-graphene, including structural stability, electronic properties, and hydrogen storage capabilities. The results show that when each Li atom adsorbs six hydrogen molecules, the material reaches the maximum hydrogen adsorption gravimetric density of 15.20 wt%. Additionally, through Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations, we obtained the hydrogen weight ratios and adsorption enthalpy curves for Li- and Na-modified PHE under varying temperature and pressure conditions. These findings indicate that both Li- and Na-modified PHE-graphene are exceptional candidates for hydrogen storage materials, particularly in mobile applications.

Quantum dot - graphene hybrid materials have raised significant interest due to the unique synergy of the optical properties of colloidal quantum dots (QDs) and the transport properties of graphene. This stimulated the development of low-cost and up-scalable solution-processed strategies for hybrid materials with potential application in light harvesting and opto-electronic devices. Here we report a versatile covalent-linking based approach for the functionalization of reduced graphene oxide (rGO), to prepare a variety of QD-rGO hybrid dispersions with QDs of different size and composition (PbS, PbS/CdS and CdSe QDs), and shape (CdSe/CdS dot-in-rods). We achieved a well-controlled QD coverage of the rGO sheets by functionalizing the rGO surface with mercapto-silane linkers. A further spectroscopic investigation of near-infrared PbS QD-rGO materials demonstrates efficient electronic coupling between both materials. The QD photoluminescence emission quenching and exciton lifetime shortening up to 95%, together with subtle graphene Raman G-band shifts upon QD linking, supports electron transfer as the dominant relaxation pathway from the QD to the rGO. The use of core/shell PbS/CdS QDs allows tuning of the transfer efficiency from 94% for a 0.2 nm thin CdS shell, down to 30% for a 1.1 nm thick shell.

- **TL;DR**: CoRuFeSi是一种四元Heusler合金，具有室温下稳定的铁磁性、半金属性和显著的异常霍尔效应，其异常霍尔电导率约74 S/cm，主要由本征Berry曲率机制主导。

Quaternary Heusler alloys offer a versatile platform for engineering magnetic and topological transport phenomena through chemical flexibility and tunable disorder. Here, we report a comprehensive experimental and theoretical investigation of the magnetic, magnetotransport, and anomalous Hall properties of the quaternary Heusler alloy CoRuFeSi. The compound crystallizes in the LiMgPdSn-type structure with significant Co--Ru antisite disorder and exhibits soft ferromagnetism with a saturation magnetization of $4.21~μ_{\mathrm{B}}/\mathrm{f.u.}$ at low temperature and a Curie temperature well above room temperature. Hall measurements reveal a robust anomalous Hall effect persisting up to 300~K, with an anomalous Hall conductivity of $\sim 74$~S/cm that is nearly temperature independent. Scaling analysis demonstrates that the anomalous Hall response is dominated by the intrinsic Berry-curvature mechanism. First-principles calculations identify CoRuFeSi as a topologically nontrivial nodal-line semimetal in its ordered phase. Incorporation of experimentally relevant Co--Ru antisite disorder redistributes the Berry curvature and quantitatively reproduces the experimentally observed anomalous Hall conductivity, while preserving half-metallicity. These results establish CoRuFeSi as a disorder-tolerant half-metallic ferromagnet with a sizable intrinsic anomalous Hall effect at room temperature, highlighting its potential for spintronic and Hall-based device applications.

We present a comprehensive study of quantum dot (QD) coupling to various phononic modes in a phononic waveguide, combining multiband kp and configuration-interaction (CI) QD state simulations with finite-element waveguide mode modeling. We consider self-assembled Stranski-Krastanov InGaAs/GaAs as well as local droplet-etched GaAs/AlGaAs structures. Using kp-CI calculations, we quantify the strain and piezoelectric responses of InAs and GaAs QDs. By systematically isolating volumetric/shear deformation-potential and piezoelectric channels, we demonstrate how mode symmetries dictate distinct coupling mechanisms. We identify the dominant coupling channels and characterize their observable signatures in the QD response. We predict strong linear energy shifts under volumetric strain and quadratic behavior under shear strain, especially in GaAs QDs. The piezoelectric effect is dominated by polarizability, which also leads to a quadratic response. The simulations show energy modulations up to 0.7 meV for an acoustic wave with 0.1 nm amplitude. The quadratic response to shear strain and piezoelectric field leads to frequency doubling in the QD response to a mechanical wave and to non-harmonic time traces when linear and quadratic effects contribute to a similar degree. The deep understanding of QD-acoustic couplings opens pathways to the optimal design of QD and waveguide structures, as well as to improved engineering of acousto-optic quantum interfaces.

We report the magnetic and magnetotransport properties of the layered CaAl$_2$Si$_2$-type diluted magnetic semiconductor (Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$)(Cd$_{1-y}$Mn$_y$)$_2$As$_2$ over a broad Mn (spin) substitution range of $0.05 \le y \le 0.5$. K substitution introduces hole carriers, whereas Mn provides local moments, resulting in bulk ferromagnetism with Curie temperatures up to $\sim 17$ K. Intrinsic magnetic ordering is further supported by an anomalous Hall contribution and a specific-heat anomaly near $T_{\mathrm{C}}$. A key performance feature is a colossal negative magnetoresistance: for heavily Mn-doped compositions ($y \ge 0.3$), $\mathrm{MR}=[ρ(H)-ρ(0)]/ρ(0)$ reaches approximately $-100\%$ at 2 K and nearly saturates at a relatively low magnetic field of $\sim 0.35\,\mathrm{T}$. The combination of soft ferromagnetism, strong spin-charge coupling, and low-field MR saturation highlights (Ba,K)(Cd,Mn)$_2$As$_2$ as a promising bulk platform for low-temperature magnetoresistive functionalities.

We present a microscopic theory of the inverse chiral phonon Zeeman effect in noncentrosymmetric crystals. Within micropolar elasticity, coupled translational displacements and microrotations give rise to intrinsically chiral phonons, which generate an elliptically polarized internal magnetic field through dynamical piezoelectricity. In the high-frequency Floquet regime and under incomplete electronic screening, this field acts as an effective longitudinal Zeeman field on electronic spins, leading to spin polarization and band splitting. The results establish a purely lattice-driven mechanism for the inverse chiral phonon Zeeman effect in noncentrosymmetric crystals.

Halide perovskites have emerged as promising materials for next-generation photovoltaics, laser sources and X-ray detectors. There is intense debate as to whether some photoactive halide perovskites exhibit ferroelectric behaviour and whether it might be possible to utilise the bulk photovoltaic effect to enhance the performance of halide perovskite solar cells. Here, using low-dose scanning transmission electron microscopy, we discover the existence of ferroelastic twin boundaries in vapor-deposited CsPbI3 thin films, parallel to {110} and {112}. Remarkably, despite photoactive CsPbI3 being centrosymmetric and non-polar, we observe directly that Pb atoms shift at {110} twin boundaries driving a local ferroelectric-like polarisation. These polar twin walls form an intrinsic array of nanoscale functional interfaces, spaced ~30-50 nm apart, embedded within the non-polar perovskite lattice. In contrast, {112} twin boundaries remain non-polar but strongly suppress octahedral tilt and off-centre Cs atom displacements, revealing a different untapped ferroic degree of freedom. These discoveries together uncover previously hidden ferroic functionality in halide perovskite semiconductors, opening opportunities for enhanced conductivity and photovoltaic behaviour through domain wall engineering.

Ferroelectric materials such as BaTiO3 exhibit spontaneous polarization that can be reoriented by an external electric field, forming the basis of various memory, actuator, and sensor applications. The polarization switching behavior, however, is strongly influenced by mechanical boundary conditions due to the intrinsic electromechanical coupling in ferroelectrics. In this study, we employ a machine learning interatomic potential to investigate the effect of uniaxial compressive stress on polarization switching and domain wall evolution in the tetragonal phase of BaTiO3. This study revealed a critical stress about 120 MPa which 90 degree polarization switching occurs. Beyond the critical stress, larger supercells exhibit lower activation energies for polarization switching with 180-degree domain wall formation and weaker constraints from periodic boundary conditions, thereby facilitating domain-wall formation. Besides, Increasing compressive stress reduces both the remnant polarization and the coercive field, while a double hysteresis loop emerges at a stress level of 80 MPa. These findings provide atomistic insights into stress-controlled ferroelectric switching and highlight the crucial role of mechanical loading in designing reliable ferroelectric devices.

- **TL;DR**: 使用基于revPBE-D3泛函的ACE势能模型计算水的相图，通过OPES采样和Gibbs-Duhem积分方法，在100-500K和0-4GPa范围内重现了主要冰相（Ih、II、V、VI、VII）的稳定区域，与实验结果高度一致。

Water's phase diagram remains one of the most intricate and challenging benchmarks in molecular modeling. In this study, we compute the phase diagram of water using an Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE) potential trained on density-functional theory (DFT) calculations based on the revPBE-D3 exchange and correlation functional. We compute solid-liquid chemical potential differences and melting points using biased coexistence simulations with the On-the-Fly Probability Enhanced Sampling (OPES) method. Starting from these points, we trace coexistence lines using Gibbs-Duhem integration. This combination of methods allows us to consistently map pressure-temperature phase boundaries and reconstruct the full phase diagram between approximately 100-500 K and 0-4 GPa. The stability regions of the main ice polymorphs (Ih, II, V, VI, and VII) are reproduced in close agreement with experiments. As in earlier studies based on DFT, ice III is metastable and there are systematic shifts of coexistence lines with respect to experimental results. Our results demonstrate the capability of our general-purpose ACE potential to capture the complex phase behavior of water across wide thermodynamic conditions.

- **TL;DR**: 开发了用于多组分合金沉淀建模的机器学习原子间势（MLIPs）参数化方法和误差度量，应用于Mg-Nd合金，成功再现早期沉淀行为并揭示有序-无序与结构转变的竞争。

Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are routinely used to model diverse atomistic phenomena, yet parameterizing them to accurately capture solid-state phase transformations remains difficult. We present error metrics and data-generation schemes designed to streamline the parameterization of MLIPs for modeling precipitation in multi-component alloys. We developed an algorithm that enumerates symmetrically distinct transformation pathways connecting chemical decorations on different parent crystal structures. Additionally, we introduce the weighted Kendall-$τ$ coefficient and its semi-grand canonical generalization as metrics for quantifying MLIP accuracy in predicting low-temperature thermodynamics. We apply these approaches to parameterize an MLIP for a dilute Mg-Nd alloy. The resulting potential reproduces the complex early-stage precipitation behavior observed in experiment. Large-scale atomistic simulations reveal competition between order-disorder and structural transformations. Furthermore, these results suggest a continuous transition between high-symmetry hcp and bcc crystal structures during aging heat treatments.

- **TL;DR**: 基于LiYO2:Tb3+中相变诱导交叉弛豫激活的视觉发光温度计，通过结构相变实现从蓝到绿的明显颜色变化，具有高灵敏度和多模式测温能力。

The development of visual luminescent thermometers capable of exhibiting pronounced color changes in response to temperature variations requires the rational design of phosphors with high spectrally selective thermal sensitivity. In this work, we present a strategy based on phase-transition-induced activation of cross-relaxation processes in LiYO2:Tb3+. The monoclinic-to-tetragonal structural phase transition modifies the point symmetry of Tb3+ ions in the host lattice, enhances the Stark effect, and enables energetic resonance required for efficient cross relaxation. Consequently, emission originating from the 5D3 excited state is rapidly quenched relative to that from the 5D4 level above approximately 300 K, resulting in a distinct temperature-dependent color change of the emitted light from blue to green. This mechanism yields exceptionally high chromaticity-coordinate-based sensitivities, reaching SRx,max = 0.40% K-1 and SRy,max=0.72% K-1 at 410 K. Furthermore, phase-transition-driven modifications of the Tb3+ emission spectral profile enable the realization of a multimode luminescent thermometer with a maximum relative sensitivity of SRmax=13% K-1. The practical applicability of this system is demonstrated through an ON-OFF luminescent thermal switch and fully filter-free, dynamic two-dimensional thermal imaging using the blue and green channels of a standard digital camera, enabling intuitive visualization, remote readout, and temperature mapping under dynamic conditions.

Halide double perovskites are an interesting alternative to Pb-containing counterparts as active materials in optoelectronic devices. Low-dimensional double perovskites are fabricated by introducing large organic cations, resulting in organic/inorganic architectures with one or more inorganic octahedral layers separated by organic cations. Here, we synthesize layered double perovskites based on 3D Cs2AgBiBr6 that consist of double (2L) or single (1L) inorganic octahedral layers, using ammonium cations of different size and chemical structure. Temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy reveals phase transition signatures in both inorganic lattice and organic moieties by detecting variations in their vibrational modes. Changes in the conformational arrangement of the organic cations to an ordered state coincide with a phase transition in the 1L systems with the shortest ammonium moieties. Significant changes of photoluminescence intensity observed around the transition temperature suggest that optical properties may be deeply affected by the octahedral tilts emerging at the phase transition.

We report Beta-AlGaO/Ga2O3 tri-gate heterostructure MOSHEMTs incorporating a thin 5 nm Al2O3 gate oxide layer for improved gate control and reduced leakage. The devices were fabricated on AlGaO/GaO heterostructures grown by ozone MBE on Fe-doped Ga2O3 (010) substrates. The tri-gate MOSHEMTs, with 1 micron-wide fins and Lg=155 nm, exhibit a peak current-gain cut-off frequency fT=70 GHz and a power-gain cut-off frequency fMAX=55 GHz.The fT.L product of 10.85 GHz-micron is the highest among reported Ga2O3 FETs to date. The devices show Vth =-0.5 V, an on/off ratio 10^6 I=80 mA/mm, a peak gm=60 mS/mm, and a low gate leakage current of 10^(-10) mA/mm at Vgs=0.5 V. Passivation with a 100 nm ALD Al2O3 layer effectively removes DC/RF dispersion and maintains stable operation under pulsed IV and repeated RF measurements. These results demonstrate the potential of tri-gate AlGaO/GaO MOSHEMTs for next-generation high-frequency and high-power applications.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究通过光电子能谱测量新鲜制备的UxTey薄膜，系统分析了铀碲化物系列的电子结构演化，揭示了U-Te杂化和电荷转移效应的系统趋势。

Uranium tellurides span magnetic and superconducting ground states, yet systematic electronic-structure information across the U-Te series remains scarce. In this study, we perform photoemission measurements on freshly prepared UxTey thin films covering the range of bulk stoichiometries under ultra-high vacuum (10^-9 Pa), enabling clean surfaces and compositions matching bulk phases, including the celebrated UTe2. X-ray and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS/UPS) reveal consistent evolution of the U 4f and Te 3d core levels and valence states across the series, in good agreement with the limited bulk data. Supported by uniform ab initio calculations for all U-Te compounds, we identify systematic trends in U-Te hybridization and charge-transfer effects across the series. These results establish thin-film photoemission as a reliable route for mapping electronic-structure trends in tellurides of heavy elements with diverse electronic ground states.

- **TL;DR**: LAO/STO界面中发现的负U中心是固有特性而非人工结构，这些中心与可调控超导性共存且热稳定性好，对界面超导器件有重要影响。

The LaAlO3/SrTiO3 (LAO/STO) interface hosts a rich range of electronic phenomena, including unconventional electron pairing that in quantum dots gives rise to a negative effective charging energy U. Here, we show freestanding LAO/STO micro-membranes naturally hosting negative-U centers, where lateral confinement arises intrinsically, rather than from engineered nanostructures. These centers coexist with gate-tunable superconductivity and can remain stable upon thermal cycling from millikelvin temperatures to room temperature. Transport is in excellent agreement with calculations based on a negative-U Anderson model, and electrostatic simulations indicate characteristic center sizes of 20-80 nm. Our findings suggest that negative-U centers may arise from the intrinsic interfacial inhomogeneity typical of LAO/STO, and should therefore be considered a general feature of the LAO/STO interface. This could have important consequences for the microwave response of interfacial superconducting devices.

Atomic substitution provides a controlled route to engineer lattice dynamics in low-symmetry two-dimensional materials. Here, by combining polarization-resolved Raman spectroscopy and first-principles calculations, we investigate the evolution of phonon characteristics in CrSBr$_{1-x}$Cl$_{x}$ ($0 \leq x \leq \sim 0.5$) upon partial substitution of Br with Cl atoms. Progressive Cl substitution of Br induces systematic shifts of parent CrSBr out-of-plane $A_\textrm{g}$ phonon modes and activates additional Raman features. These features persist across different polarization configurations and excitation energies, reflecting substitution-induced symmetry lowering and local lattice perturbations. Explicit supercell phonon calculations combined with Raman $Γ$-density-of-states simulations identify these features as symmetry-lowered descendants of parent modes arising from alloy disorder. Complementary strain-dependent calculations reveal that anisotropic lattice compression plays a key role in renormalizing Cr-S dominated phonons. Under near-resonant excitation, stimulated Raman scattering-like amplification remains observable with increasing Cl content, highlighting the resilience of anisotropic electron-phonon coupling in this system.

The crystal structure of Rb$_2$Ru$_2$O$_7$.H$_2$O was determined by three-dimensional electron diffraction from the individual crystallites of a solid-state powder product. Rb$_2$Ru$_2$O$_7$.H$_2$O crystallizes in space group \textit{C}2/\textit{c} ($a=7.841(3)$ Å, $b=12.500(3)$ Å, $c=8.392(2)$ Å, $β=93.57(4)^\circ$, Z=4). The structure contains infinite chains that run normal to the (101) plane and consist of alternating RuO$_6$ octahedra and square-pyramidal RuO$_5$ units connected via shared O-O edges. Magnetic properties were measured on the bulk powder, showing a diamagnetic baseline from 300 to 60 K with a small Curie tail below 55 K. The magnetic moment, calculated from the 1.8 K isotherm, saturates at $M=4.4\times10^{-3}\,μ_\mathrm{B}\,\mathrm{Ru}^{-1}$, much less than would be expected for $S=1$ ruthenium. Bond-valence-sum analysis indicates high-valent Ru, and the near-diamagnetic response is consistent with the edge-sharing Ru-Ru motif, where weak direct Ru-Ru overlap yields a local singlet.

Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) field-effect transistors (FETs), with their atomically thin bodies, are promising candidates for future gate-all-around (GAA) nanoribbon architectures. While state-of-the-art Si GAA nanoribbon transistors feature channel widths in the tens of nanometers, most reported TMD-based FETs remain limited to micrometer-scale dimensions, limiting their relevance for ultra-scaled electronics. In this work, we investigate the channel width scaling in nanoribbon transistors based on monolayer MoS2 grown on 2-inch wafers, achieving widths of approximately 30-40 nm. Remarkably, nanoribbon width scaling enhances the on-current by 30-40%, reaching up to 700 uA/um for the smallest-width devices, while also improving the subthreshold slope (SS) to as low as 70 mV/dec. This enhancement is attributed to a stronger electric field at the nanoribbon edges without significant degradation from edge-related scattering. To further demonstrate the scalability of the nanoribbon device, we evaluate the variability of extremely scaled monolayer MoS2 nanoribbon transistor arrays featuring a contact pitch of 60 nm and an effective oxide thickness (EOT) of approximately 0.9 nm. Beyond MoS2, we extend the nanoribbon structure to WS2 n-type and WSe2 p-type FETs, demonstrating a viable path toward complementary monolayer TMD nanoribbon FETs for future ultra-scaled electronics.

Indium selenide (In2Se3), a layered chalcogenide with multiple polymorphs, is a promising material for optoelectronic and ferroelectric applications. However, achieving polymorph-pure thin films remains a major challenge due to the complex growth space. In this work, Bayesian Optimization (BO) is successfully leveraged to guide the molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growth of In2Se3 on Al2O3 substrates. By training a predictive Gaussian Process Regressor with sequential learning, we efficiently explored substrate temperature, indium flux, selenium flux, and cracker temperature, reducing experimental trials required for successful synthesis. A γ-In2Se3 film with 91% phase purity was achieved after fewer than ten trials. Attempts to isolate α-In2Se3 were limited by amorphous film formation at low temperatures, indicating that single-step co-deposition is unsuitable for crystalline α-In2Se3 on Al2O3. Overall, this study validates Bayesian Optimization as a powerful approach for phase-selective growth in complex materials systems.

The quantum geometric tensor (QGT), whose real and imaginary parts define the quantum metric and Berry curvature, encodes the intrinsic geometry of quantum states. While electronic QGT has been directly observed and linked to various phenomena like electron-phonon coupling, its bosonic analogue remains both theoretically and experimentally unexplored. We demonstrate that the dynamical structure factor directly encodes the full QGT throughout the Brillouin zone, establishing it as a sensitive probe of both quantum metric and Berry curvature. Applying this framework, we uncover clear geometric signatures in a twofold quadruple Weyl phonon in BaPtGe and the node-line magnon in Gd. Our results establish a general, direct route to measuring quantum geometry in bosonic systems, a crucial step toward elucidating its impact on condensed matter phenomena.

We present a novel application of our high-resolution capacitance dilatometer, specifically engineered for the precise characterization of quantum materials. These materials, which often appear as ultrathin, platelet-shaped crystals, are known for exotic phenomena such as superconductivity, topological order and quantum spin liquid. However, these crystals seldom reach macroscopic dimensions, making them unsuitable for conventional dilatometry techniques. By introducing a modified sample-mounting configuration, our design enables high-resolution measurements of thermal expansion and magnetostriction along in-plane crystallographic directions in samples with thicknesses well below 500 $μ$m. Validation measurements using a Quantum Design PPMS system confirm reliable performance for a 300 $μ$m-thick silver platelet, relatively hard ferromagnetic EuB$_6$ single crystals down to 50 $μ$m, and a 40 $μ$m-thin, soft AgCrS$_2$ single crystal. This advancement significantly broadens the applicability of capacitance dilatometry, providing a powerful platform for investigating emergent phenomena in reduced-dimensional quantum systems.

- **TL;DR**: 首次在具有磁结构一级相变的Gd₅Si₂Ge₂材料中研究旋转磁热效应，通过旋转磁场而非改变强度，利用样品形状依赖的自退磁效应获得显著磁热响应。

The rotating magnetocaloric effect (RMCE) induced by self-demagnetization has been investigated in the giant magnetocaloric effect (GMCE) material Gd$_5$Si$_2$Ge$_2$. This shape-dependent effect had thus far only been reported in pure Gd, marking this as the first analysis of the effect in a sample with a magnetostructural first-order phase transition. By rotating the applied magnetic field vector while keeping its intensity constant, the demagnetizing field within a high-aspect ratio sample changes significantly, resulting in a RMCE. We characterize RMCE by determining the adiabatic temperature change ($ΔT_{ad}^{rot}$) directly through temperature measurements, and the isothermal entropy change ($ΔS_M^{rot}$) via magnetometry and magnetostatic simulations. We obtain a remarkable maximum $ΔT_{ad}^{rot}$ of 1.77 K for a constant external field of 0.8 T, higher than that obtained under 1.0 T. The magnetostatic simulations not only corroborate the highly non-monotonous field-dependence of $|ΔS_{M}^{rot}|$, which reaches 95\% of its maximum value at 0.8 T, 6.12 J K$^{-1}$ kg$^{-1}$ for the experimentally measured shape, but also estimate a 35\% increase in the maximum $|ΔS_{M}^{rot}|$ up to 8.67 J K$^{-1}$ kg$^{-1}$ in a simulated shape with higher aspect ratio.

We explore the U-Ge phase diagram using thin film growth by co-deposition of U and Ge via d.c. magnetron sputtering. Using three different single crystal substrates - MgO, CaF$_2$ and SrTiO$_3$ - we have stabilised mixed phase films of mostly UGe$_3$ and UGe, with evidence of UGe$_2$ as well. At higher temperatures UO$_2$ forms as a consequence of gettering of oxygen from several types of substrate. Several UGe$_3$ dominated samples grown on MgO substrates have also been characterised electrically, showing residual resistivity ratios up to six.

The center of mass and helicity are two dynamic degrees of freedom of skyrmions. In this work, we study the current-driven skyrmion motion in frustrated altermagnets. Contrary to conventional wisdom, we find that the skyrmion helicity is not locked with the skyrmion Hall angle, but unidirectionally rotates with a global angular velocity proportional to the square of the current density. In addition, we find that the helicity rotation velocity is highly anisotropic, depending on the direction of current flows. We also observe helicity oscillation in the terahertz regimes, where the nonlinear mixing between the fast and slow modes generates a magnon frequency comb. Full atomistic spin dynamics simulations verify our theoretical predictions. Our results establish frustrated altermagnets as a promising platform for skyrmionics, THz technology, and frequency comb.

- **TL;DR**: CatMaster是一个基于大语言模型的智能代理系统，可将自然语言请求转化为完整的计算工作空间，自动化催化研究工作流程，减少手动脚本编写和记录工作。

Density functional theory (DFT) is widely used to connect atomic structure with catalytic behavior, but computational heterogeneous catalysis studies often require long workflows that are costly, iterative, and sensitive to setup choices. Besides the intrinsic cost and accuracy limits of first-principles calculations, practical workflow issues such as keeping references consistent, preparing many related inputs, recovering from failed runs on computing clusters, and maintaining a complete record of what was done, can slow down projects and make results difficult to reproduce or extend.
  Here we present CatMaster, a large-language-model (LLM)-driven agent system that turns natural language requests into complete calculation workspaces, including structures, inputs, outputs, logs, and a concise run record. CatMaster maintains a persistent project record of key facts, constraints, and file pointers to support inspection and restartability. It is paired with a multi-fidelity tool library that covers rapid surrogate relaxations and high-fidelity DFT calculations for validation when needed. We demonstrate CatMaster on four demonstrations of increasing complexity: an O2 spin-state check with remote execution, BCC Fe surface energies with a protocol-sensitivity study and CO adsorption site ranking, high-throughput Pt--Ni--Cu alloy screening for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) descriptors with surrogate-to-DFT validation, and a demonstration beyond the predefined tool set, including equation-of-state fitting for BCC Fe and CO-FeN4-graphene single-atom catalyst geometry preparation. By reducing manual scripting and bookkeeping while keeping the full evidence trail, CatMaster aims to help catalysis researchers focus on modeling choices and chemical interpretation rather than workflow management.

Hybrid superconductor--semiconductor platforms can host subgap electronic excitations such as Andreev bound states (ABSs); in topological regimes, a special zero-energy class, Majorana bound states (MBSs), can emerge. Here we report the growth of epitaxial Al films by molecular-beam epitaxy on $\mathrm{In_{0.75}Ga_{0.25}As}$ under near-room-temperature substrate conditions. Using a combination of AFM/SEM, cross-sectional TEM, and \emph{in situ} RHEED, we map how substrate temperature and Al deposition rate govern film morphology, continuity, and interface quality. We identify a growth window that yields continuous, superconducting Al films with an abrupt $\mathrm{Al}/\mathrm{In_{0.75}Ga_{0.25}As}$ interface and no detectable indium interdiffusion. We further investigate the thermal stability of these films under \emph{in situ} post-growth heating and \emph{ex situ} annealing following surface oxidation. For unoxidized Al, rapid surface diffusion triggers solid-state dewetting at approximately $165\,^\circ\mathrm{C}$, resulting in the formation of $\{111\}$-faceted Al islands. In contrast, the presence of a native oxide largely suppresses dewetting, with failure occurring only locally at surface defects. Annealing above the indium melting point ($156.6\,^\circ\mathrm{C}$) induces significant In surface migration in both cases, leading either to localized interfacial In inclusions beneath Al agglomerates or to uniform surface contamination at sites of localized layer breakdown. Together, these results define growth and annealing conditions for thermally robust epitaxial Al on III--V semiconductors and provide practical guidance for fabricating high-quality superconductor--semiconductor hybrid platforms for quantum devices.

- **TL;DR**: GPUTB-2是一个学习隐式保持正交性的哈密顿量的框架，通过直接在电子能带结构上训练，解决了LCAO基组非正交性带来的计算瓶颈，实现了高精度和大规模电子结构预测。

Although equivariant neural networks have become a cornerstone for learning electronic Hamiltonians, the intrinsic non-orthogonality of linear combinations of atomic orbitals (LCAO) basis sets poses a fundamental challenge. The computational cost of Hamiltonian orthogonalization scales as O(N^3), which severely hinders electronic structure calculations for large-scale systems containing hundreds of thousands to millions of atoms. To address this issue, we develop GPUTB-2, a framework that learns implicitly orthogonality-preserving Hamiltonians by training directly on electronic band structures. Benefiting from an E(3)-equivariant network accelerated by Gaunt tensor product and SO(2) tensor product layers, GPUTB-2 achieves significantly higher accuracy than GPUTB across multiple benchmark systems. Moreover, GPUTB-2 accurately predicts large-scale electronic structures, including transport properties of temperature-perturbed SnSe and the band structures of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene. By further integrating this framework with the linear-scaling quantum transport (LSQT) method, we investigate the electronic properties of million-atom amorphous graphene and uncover pressure-induced electronic structure transitions in more complex amorphous silicon. Together, these results establish GPUTB-2 as a high-accuracy and scalable approach for predicting orthogonal Hamiltonians.

### Near-atomic investigation on the elemental redistribution during co-precipitation of nano-sized kappa phase and B2 phase in an Al-alloyed lightweight steel

- **TL;DR**: 通过TKD-TEM、APT和DFT研究Fe-10Al-7Mn-6Ni-1C钢中κ和B2相共沉淀的元素再分布，发现两种共沉淀模式，B2相从NiAl型向FeAl型演化，提高相稳定性。

In the present study, correlative transmission Kikuchi diffraction transmission electron microscopy (TKD-TEM) measurements, atom probe tomography (APT), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations are used to reveal the elemental redistribution during co-precipitation of nanosized kappa and B2 phases in an FCC matrix of an Al alloyed Fe-10Al-7Mn-6Ni-1C (wt.%) steel. Upon ageing at 800 C for 15 min, two co-nanoprecipitation modes are observed: B2 forming together with kappa and B2 forming separately from kappa in the FCC matrix. APT reveals that the B2 precipitate next to kappa (referred to as B2I) is close to an FeAl type phase, while the isolated B2 precipitate (referred to as B2II) is close to a NiAl type phase. The kappa precipitates maintain a nearly constant Al content of approximately 18.4 at.% regardless of their precipitation position. DFT confirms that kappa may accommodate limited Ni substitution at Fe sites without losing structural stability, and that Fe Ni atomic exchange between kappa and B2 is thermodynamically favorable at 800 C. This exchange drives the B2 phase to evolve from a NiAl type towards an FeAl type, improving the stability of both phases during co-precipitation. These results provide understanding of kappa B2 interactions and offer insights for designing nanosized intermetallic strengthened microstructures in Al alloyed lightweight steels.

- **TL;DR**: 研究Ru含量对Au-Pd-Pt-Ru复合固溶体薄膜电化学性能和缺陷形成的影响，发现Ru含量增加导致晶格收缩、缺陷类型转变（从纳米孪晶到堆垛层错），并提高析氢反应活性。

Compositionally complex solid solutions (CCSSs) consist of a randomly mixed single phase with the potential to enhance electrocatalytic activity through their polyelemental surface atom arrangements. However, microstructural complexity originating from multiple principal elements influences local structure, chemistry, and lattice strain, which might also affect electrocatalytic activity. Here, we investigate the effect of Ru content on electrochemistry and defect formation in Au-Pd-Pt-Ru CCSS thin films. Such defects could provide active sites when terminating at the CCSS surface or modify surface composition through preferential segregation. A thin-film material library covering a wide composition range was fabricated by room-temperature combinatorial co-sputtering. High-throughput compositional, structural and functional characterization, including electron microscopy equipped with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and electrochemical screening, were used to correlate composition and microstructural features with catalytic activity. Three representative compositions selected from the library - Au68Pd13Pt15Ru4, Au27Pd24Pt23Ru26, and Au9Pd21Pt18Ru52 - were examined in detail. The three samples exhibit face-centered cubic structures, with lattice contraction occurring with increasing Ru content. In addition, with increasing Ru content, a transition from a high density of nanotwins to high-density, atomic-layer stacking faults was observed. Moreover, the hydrogen evolution reaction activity improves with higher Ru content. Atom probe tomography reveals local compositional fluctuations, including element-specific enrichment and depletion at grain boundaries. The findings provide a new insight into surface atom arrangement design in the CCSS electrocatalysts with enhanced performance.

- **TL;DR**: 利用嵌段共聚物的自组装能力结合压缩-膨胀循环，获得不同形态的CdSe量子点结构

We propose to use the self-assembly ability of a block copolymer combined with compression-expansion cycles to obtain CdSe quantum dots (QDs) structures of different morphology. The methodology proposed consists in transferring onto mica mixed Langmuir monolayers of QDs and the polymer poly (styrene-co-maleic anhydride) partial 2 buthoxy ethyl ester cumene terminated, PS-MA-BEE, previously sheared by 50 compression-expansion cycles. Results indicate that the shear stress takes out nanoparticles at the air-water interface from metastable states and promoted a new equilibrium state of the Langmuir monolayer, then it was transferred onto mica by the Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) methodology and the morphology of the LB films was analyzed by Atomic Force Microscopy and Transmission Electron Microscopy measurements. Our results show that when the amplitude strain increases the QDs domain size decreases and the LB film becomes more ordered. The dynamic of the monolayer relaxation after cycling involves at least three timescales which are related to the damping of surface fluctuation, raft rearrangement and component movements inside each raft. Brewster Angle Microscopy allowed visualizing in situ the raft rearrangement at the air-water interface.

- **TL;DR**: MoXY/WXY Janus双层材料通过异质结构的内建电场和能带调控，实现高效太阳能驱动水分解，预测STH效率达17.1%

Identifying materials that simultaneously straddle the water redox potentials and possess an intrinsic electric field is crucial for achieving high solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency. Using state-of-the-art first-principles calculations, including a range-separated hybrid functional and spin-orbit coupling, we investigate MoXY/WXY (X, Y = S, Se) Janus bilayers for overall water splitting. We find that the Se-Se interfaced heterobilayer is intrinsically capable of driving water splitting, while its S-S counterpart can meet the redox requirements through pH modulation. For both configurations, a remarkable STH efficiency of 17.1\% is predicted. Compared with homo-bilayers, hetero-bilayers benefit from the chemical potential difference between Mo and W, which generates a built-in electric field and promotes spatial separation of photogenerated carriers, suppressing recombination and overall enhancing hydrogen production. These results demonstrate the promise of Janus heterobilayers for efficient solar-driven water splitting.

Self-interstitials play a central role in governing the mechanical and anti-irradiation properties of refractory high-entropy alloys (RHEAs), however, the prediction of interstitial formation energies (Ef) is formidable due to the chemically complex environments in RHEAs. Herein, we develop a framework based on the tight-binding model to quantify the effects of complex alloying and lattice distortion on Ef. Our scheme reveals that Ef is jointly determined by the average d-band center of RHEAs and the d-band width of interstitial sites. Notably, the d-band width mainly depends on the interatomic hopping matrix and atomic size-determined coordination number, which together make the metallic bonding around interstitials in RHEAs resemble the distance-dependence law of van der Waals forces. By capturing d-band coupling character, our descriptor describes both interstitial configurations within a universal framework. Our model reveals a new physical picture of interstitial formation, providing a useful tool for the design of high-performance RHEAs.

- **TL;DR**: 提出动态多频显微镜(DMM)框架，结合多频激发与连续频率扫描，解决传统SPM技术局限性，实现高保真纳米尺度计量

Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM) is the primary tool for exploring nanoscale functionality, yet standard single-frequency operation is fundamentally limited, because the dynamic tip-sample interaction is mathematically underdetermined. While advanced methods such as Dual Amplitude Resonance Tracking (DART) and Band Excitation (BE) address this by tracking resonance, they face critical limitations: DART suffers from feedback instability on complex topographies, while Band Excitation is constrained by severe trade-offs between spectral resolution and acquisition speed. Here, we introduce Dynamic Multiband Microscopy (DMM), a general framework that bridges these gaps by combining multifrequency excitation with continuous frequency sweeping. We implement this within an automated experimental workflow that autonomously identifies and targets measurement points of interest. In combination with quantitative interferometric detection, this approach brings SPM to the fundamental limits of noise and spectral sensitivity. Validated on ferroelectric nanofibers, this platform enables simultaneous, crosstalk-free 3D polarization mapping, establishing a universal framework for autonomous, high-fidelity nanoscale metrology.

### Grain-Growth Stagnation from Vacancy-Diffusion-Limited Disconnection Climb

Grain growth in polycrystals typically stagnates at long times. We identify disconnection climb, limited by vacancy diffusion, as a fundamental microscopic mechanism underlying this behavior. Using a phase-field crystal framework extended to model vacancy diffusion, we resolve grain-boundary migration on diffusive time scales and show that disconnection climb rates correlate with the characteristic grain size at which growth arrests. These results link vacancy transport, disconnection dynamics, and microstructural evolution, establishing vacancy diffusion as a key governing factor.

- **TL;DR**: 利用干涉式矢量压电力显微镜技术，无需旋转样品即可同时绘制多晶铁电体的局部晶体取向和畴结构，实现高通量纳米级表征。

Ongoing advances in scanning probe microscopy techniques are continually expanding the possibilities for nanoscale characterization and correlated studies of functional materials. Here, we demonstrate how a recent extension of piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM), known as interferometric vector PFM, can be utilized for simultaneously mapping the local crystallographic orientations and the domain structure of distributed grains in uniaxial ferroelectric polycrystals. By shifting the laser beam position on the cantilever, direction-dependent piezoresponse signals are acquired analogous to classical vector PFM, but without the need to rotate the sample. Using polycrystalline ErMnO$_{3}$ as a model system, we demonstrate that the reconstructed piezoresponse vectors correlate one-to-one with the crystallographic orientations of the micrometer-sized grains, carrying grain-orientation and domain-related information. We establish a versatile approach for rapid, multimodal characterization of polycrystalline uniaxial ferroelectrics, enabling automated, high-throughput reconstruction of polarization and grain orientations with nanoscale precision.

A new approach for determining the binding energies of charged particles, such as ions and electrons, on dielectric surfaces in cryogenic liquids is introduced. The experimental technique outlined in this paper is employed to observe the buildup of charged particles on nonconductive surfaces using the electro-optic Kerr effect. The initial results of binding energy measurements on surfaces of deuterated tetraphenyl butadiene (dTPB)-coated and uncoated polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) in liquid nitrogen are presented. Under these conditions, the ions or electrons displayed binding energies of less than 1 meV. Although these findings were obtained in liquid nitrogen, the methodology is not limited to cryogenic liquids and is applicable to a wide variety of fluids, with no essential dependence on temperature.

- **TL;DR**: FeGa合金通过外延稳定化可将Ga含量从19%提升至30%，磁致伸缩系数达稀土材料SmFe2的两倍，但磁电开关性能受磁共振频率和阻尼影响。研究测量了高Ga含量FeGa薄膜的磁共振和材料参数，发现Gilbert阻尼随Ga浓度增加而降低，与磁弹耦合增强相关。

Iron gallium (FeGa) alloys are excellent rare-earth-free magnetostrictors. Through epitaxial stabilization, the disordered A2 alloy can be extended from 19% to 30% gallium resulting in a magnetostrictive coefficient almost twice than that which is seen in rare earth magnetostrictors like SmFe2. In a composite magnetoelectric structure, this makes epitaxially-stabilized iron gallium a key material for energy-efficient beyond CMOS technologies. The energy dissipation and speed of magnetoelectric switching, however, is affected by the magnetic resonance frequency and damping. Here we report the evolution of the ferromagnetic resonance and key materials parameters (magnetic anisotropy, magnetic damping, and magnetostriction coefficient) for 70 nm thick epitaxially-stabilized single crystal A2 FeGa films beyond 19% Ga. Using flip chip ferromagnetic resonance (1-14 GHz), we find that the Gilbert damping parameter spans the range of 0.09-0.16 and decreases as the Ga concentration increases. This correlates an increasing magnetoelastic coupling with a reduction in the Gilbert damping. We find that the effective damping is a mix of contributions from the intrinsic magnon-phonon scattering and other scattering/dissipation mechanisms, with the latter being dominant especially at high Ga composition. Our results provide insight into the mechanism of magnetic relaxation in metastable high magnetostriction materials and potential switching behavior of composite magnetoelectrics.

- **TL;DR**: 提出一种迭代方法，使用模拟菊池衍射图案来解析EBSD中重叠的衍射信号，通过动态模板匹配和图案相减识别次要相，无需已知相间取向关系或邻近实验图案。

In the technique of Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD), the accurate detection and identification of different phases existing in a sample is often limited by overlapping Kikuchi diffraction patterns originating from the extended probing volume of the individual EBSD map points measured in the scanning electron microscope (SEM). We present an iterative approach that uses simulated Kikuchi patterns to resolve several overlapping diffraction signals. For each measured EBSD pattern, our method first identifies the best-fit simulated Kikuchi pattern using dynamic template matching. This simulated, ideal reference pattern is then further processed to optimally match the experimental image, uncovering any underlying weaker signals after subtraction. Repeatedly utilizing dynamic template matching and pattern subtraction on residual signals of subsequent steps enables the identification of minor phases that might otherwise be missed from the probing volume of the EBSD map point. This method significantly improves phase detection in complex materials, addressing a key limitation of conventional EBSD analysis that conventionally assigns a single phase to each map point. The present method does not require a known orientation relationship between the phases of the overlapping patterns or close neighbor experimental patterns like previously published approaches.

- **TL;DR**: 本文通过连续介质模拟证明，在特定条件下，受主掺杂钙钛矿陶瓷中沿晶界的阳离子扩散活化能比值r可以大于1，即晶界扩散活化能高于体扩散活化能。

Faster diffusion of cations along grain boundaries is reported in the literature for a variety of acceptor-doped $AB\mathrm{O}_{3}$ perovskite-type oxides. The ratio $r$ of the activation enthalpy of grain-boundary diffusion ($ΔH^\mathrm{gb}$) to the activation enthalpy of bulk diffusion ($ΔH^\mathrm{b}$) is seen experimentally to lie in the range $0.7 &lt; r = ΔH^\mathrm{gb} / ΔH^\mathrm{b} &lt; 1.3$, albeit with substantial errors. In a previous publication [Parras and De Souza, Acta Mater. 195 (2020) 383] it was shown through a set of continuum simulations that cation-vacancy accumulation within negative space-charge layers at grain boundaries in acceptor-doped perovskites will give rise to faster grain-boundary diffusion of cations, with the associated values of $r$ approaching but not exceeding unity. In the present study, we demonstrate by means of continuum simulations that under certain conditions $r &gt; 1$ is achievable for faster cation diffusion along grain boundaries in an acceptor-doped perovskite ceramic. Diffusion profiles for a two-dimensional bicrystal geometry are obtained by solving, first, Poisson's equation, and subsequently, the diffusion equation. The specific case we consider is cation migration occurring by two related mechanisms, by isolated cation vacancies and by defect associates of cation and anion vacancies; the electric potential within the space-charge layers shifts the association equilibrium so that associate diffusion dominates in the bulk whereas isolated vacancy diffusion dominates within the space-charge layers. The conditions under which $r &gt; 1$ is observed are described, and issues with experimental confirmation are discussed.
