- **TL;DR**: 在超净二维材料中，电子粘度与欧姆耗散同等重要，电子传输呈现流体动力学特征。研究发现流体动力学电子流存在几何趋肤效应：尖锐障碍物局部增强电流，但在远离边缘的无障碍区域抑制电流。这为受限几何中的边缘增强和双峰电流分布提供了自然解释。

In ultra-clean 2d materials electron viscosity is as important as Ohmic dissipation and electron transport exhibits hydrodynamic features. Using a simple framework of Brinkman equations we find that hydrodynamic electron flows exhibit a geometric skin effect: sharp obstacles locally enhance the current suppressing it far from the edges where the flow is unobstructed. This effect arises within hydrodynamic transport with finite momentum relaxation and does not rely on ballistic dynamics. Our results provide a natural hydrodynamic interpretation of edge-enhanced and double-bump current profiles observed in constricted geometries. By comparing with recent scanning NV magnetometry experiments on gated graphene, we demonstrate that such flow patterns are consistent with viscous hydrodynamics shaped by geometry, clarifying the role of geometric effects in the interpretation of electronic flow experiments.

- **TL;DR**: 电场可诱导时间反演对称二维材料中的非线性反常能斯特效应，突破了单镜面对称限制，并可通过交变温度梯度驱动实现实验探测。

It's established that the nonlinear anomalous Nernst effect (NANE), originating from Berry curvature near the Fermi energy, is symmetry-permitted only when a single mirror symmetry exists in the transport plane of two-dimensional (2D) materials. Here, we show that an applied direct electric field can lift this symmetry constraint, enabling an electric-field-induced NANE emerge in time-reversal symmetric 2D systems with higher crystallographic symmetries. This electric-field-induced NANE arises from both Berry connection polarization, rooted in the electric-field-corrected Berry curvature, and the anomalous-velocity-modified nonequilibrium Fermi distribution function. Additionally, we propose an alternating temperature gradient as a driving force instead of the conventional steady one, ensuring experimental detection of NANE via second-harmonic measurement techniques. The behaviour of electric-field-induced NANE in the monolayer graphene has been theoretically and systematically investigated.

- **TL;DR**: 二维可调Dirac-Weyl半金属相：通过面内d波交变磁性在Dirac系统中实现，包含中心Dirac点和动量分离的Weyl点，通过旋转交变磁轴可连续调节Weyl点位置和边缘态连接性。

We demonstrate a tunable Dirac-Weyl semimetal phase in two dimensions, realized by introducing in-plane d-wave altermagnetism into a Dirac system. This phase hosts both a central Dirac point and momentumseparated Weyl points connected by Fermi line edge states. The Weyl point positions--and thus the edge-state connectivity--can be continuously tuned by rotating the altermagnetic axis. In contrast, out-of-plane altermagnetism gaps part of the bulk spectrum while preserving a single Dirac point accompanied by chiral edge modes, as evidenced by quantized edge polarization. Our findings provide a tunable platform for manipulating Dirac-Weyl physics and topological edge transport in two dimensions.

### Ferrichiral skyrmions with sublattice-resolved chirality in extended Kitaev model in triangular lattice

- **TL;DR**: 在三角晶格扩展Kitaev模型中，发现了一种新型铁手性斯格明子相，该相在零温、无外磁场和无DMI条件下出现，由纯阻挫交换相互作用驱动。

We study an extended Kitaev model on the triangular lattice in a limit where the symmetric off-diagonal bond-dependent and Heisenberg interactions together map onto an XXZ model, in addition to the Kitaev interaction. Within the previously identified $\mathbb{Z}_2$ vortex regime, we uncover a ferrichiral skyrmion phase characterized by a sublattice-resolved scalar chirality: two of the three sublattices carry unit skyrmion charge, while the third remains nonchiral. Using classical Monte Carlo simulations, we show that this ferrichiral skyrmion phase emerges at zero temperature and in the absence of both an external magnetic field and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, in sharp contrast to conventional skyrmion-hosting systems. The phase is stable over a wide parameter window and persists to relatively high temperatures. Our results reveal an unconventional route to skyrmion physics driven purely by frustrated exchange interactions and highlight the emergence of rich topological structures. Since both XXZ anisotropy and Kitaev interactions originate from the same spin-orbit-coupling mechanism, materials traditionally classified as XXZ magnets are expected to host finite Kitaev interactions as well. The potential for ferrichirality in these systems therefore warrants further investigation.

### Anisotropic Gyromagnetic Ratio and Orthogonal Einstein-de Haas Effect

- **TL;DR**: 该论文理论证明了正交爱因斯坦-德哈斯效应，即铁磁材料的旋转由垂直于旋转轴的磁化变化引起，这相当于各向异性的旋磁比。

We theoretically demonstrate an orthogonal Einstein-de Haas effect, where the rotation of ferromagnetic materials is caused by the change of magnetization in the direction orthogonal to the rotation axis. This amounts to an anisotropic gyromagnetic ratio. To reveal its microscopic origin, we treat the spin-orbit coupling as a perturbation, integrate out the electronic degree of freedom, and show that in collinear ferromagnets the phonon angular momentum admits a dipolar structure in the spin-order space due to the constraint of the spin group symmetry. The spin-flipping and spin-conserving parts of the spin-orbit coupling contribute differently to such a dipolar structure. All these features are exemplified in a lattice electron-phonon model with ferromagnetic order and $C_{1h}$ point group symmetry. Our work lays the ground for revealing the connection between phonon angular momentum and general spin-order configurations.

### Topological Protection by Local Support Symmetry and Destructive Interference

- **TL;DR**: 局部支撑对称性（仅作用于系统部分区域的对称性）可以保护整个系统的拓扑特征，即使存在对称性破缺耦合。

Conventionally, symmetry-protected topological phases and band crossings are protected by global symmetries acting on the entire system. Here, we show that symmetries preserved only on a partial region of a system, termed local support symmetries, can protect topological features of the full system, even in the presence of symmetry-breaking couplings. We establish a unified framework by deriving explicit conditions for such protection in both insulating and metallic phases and show that destructive interference of Bloch wave functions plays a key role. Using representative tight-binding models, we demonstrate band crossings and topological bands protected by local support crystalline and time-reversal symmetries, and further present a realistic material realization in a fluorinated biphenylene network, where a band crossing is protected by a local support C$_2$ symmetry.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文展示了超导二极管中临界电流的非易失性电切换，通过垂直磁场实现4倍调制和60%切换效率，为高密度超导集成电路提供低功耗方案。

Superconducting (SC) diodes are key passive building blocks for future SC electronics. However, realizing their active counterparts is essential for functional logic. Here, we demonstrate deterministic nonvolatile electrical switching of the critical current ($I_\text{c}$) in overlap crossbar SC junctions. By applying a minimal perpendicular magnetic field ($H_\text{z}$), $I_\text{c}$ is modulated by a factor of four with a large switching efficiency of 60\%, achieved at a significantly reduced excitation current density of $5\times10^5$~A/cm$^2$. We also uncover anomalous behaviors: an electrically switchable critical temperature and a non-monotonic $I_\text{c}$-$H_\textit{z}$ response. These observations are interpreted in terms of unique asymmetry involving isolated vortex injection, configuration and repulsion inherent to the junction geometry. Our device provides a scalable, low-power alternative to complex SQUID-based architectures, paving the way for high-density SC integrated circuits.

- **TL;DR**: 提出CLIP方法，通过课程学习和锚定扩展迁移策略，从反应主导区域逐步学习到完整时空动力学，实现反应扩散系统的参数推断和隐藏状态重建。

Reaction-diffusion (RD) systems provide fundamental models for understanding self-organized spatiotemporal patterns across diverse natural and engineered settings, but reliable parameter estimation remains challenging, particularly when observations are sparse, noisy, and restricted to a subset of state variables. Based on physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), a physics-guided Curriculum Learning Identification via PINNs (CLIP) method is introduced in this work, for joint parameter inference and hidden state reconstruction. Leveraging the physical separability of RD systems, the CLIP training progresses from reaction-dominated regimes to full spatiotemporal dynamics using curriculum learning and an anchored widening transfer strategy. Across three canonical reaction-diffusion benchmarks, CLIP achieves more accurate and robust identification than baseline methods. Furthermore, the CLIP framework is successfully applied to infer the dynamics of Min system in bacteria, where only membrane bound species are observed and key kinetic rates span multiple orders of magnitude. Moreover, ablation experiments and loss landscape analyses provide mechanistic evidence that the curriculum stages and anchored transfer enhance trainability and convergence.

- **TL;DR**: 开发了一种利用偏转器技术实现全2π立体角电子探测的ARPES方法，可在固定配置下测量整个布里渊区的电子结构，特别适用于时间分辨ARPES研究。

Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) provides a direct access to the electronic band structure of solid and molecular systems. The momentum range accessible by this technique depends directly on the photon energy used, and low-photon-energy sources are insufficient to photoemit electrons over the full Brillouin zone of most quantum materials. In addition, while electrons are emitted over a 2$π$ solid angle, conventional hemispherical analyzers only collect a small subset of those electrons. A previous work [RSI 92, 123907 (2021)] demonstrated that electrons emitted over a larger field-of-view can be acquired in one fixed configuration by accelerating them towards the analyzer with a bias voltage. Here, we extend this work by leveraging the deflector technology of novel ARPES hemispherical analyzers. We demonstrate the ability to detect all $2π$ photoemitted electrons in a fixed configuration for various materials such as gold, cuprates and transition-metal dichalcogenides. This approach is especially advantageous for time-resolved ARPES, as electron dynamics over a large momentum range can be accessed with identical measurement conditions.

### Entropic Efficiency of Bayesian Inference Protocols

- **TL;DR**: 该论文提出了一种基于信息增益与记忆擦除成本比率的推断效率度量，比较了顺序和并行两种测量范式，发现当充分利用系统-记忆相关性时，两种范式达到相同的最小擦除成本，但在存在未利用相关性时并行范式表现更好。

Inference is a versatile tool that underlies scientific discovery, machine learning, and everyday decision-making: it describes how an agent updates a probability distribution as partial information is acquired from multiple measurements, reducing ignorance about a system's latent state. We define an inferential efficiency as the ratio of information gain to cumulative memory erasure cost, with inefficiency arising from unexploited correlations between the measured system and memories, and/or between memories and environment (noise). Using this efficiency, we benchmark two limiting measurement paradigms: sequential, in which the same memory is exploited iteratively, and parallel, in which many memories are exploited simultaneously. In both cases, the minimal erasure cost reflects correlations across memories: temporal in sequential, spatial in parallel. Remarkably, when all system-memory correlations are exploited for inference, both paradigms attain the same minimal erasure cost, even in the presence of noise. Conversely, the parallel paradigm performs better in the presence of unexploited correlations, stemming from hidden memories' degrees of freedom. This approach provides a quantitative, physically grounded criterion to compare inference strategies, determine their efficiency, and link target information gains to their minimal entropic cost.

### Unraveling Surface Chemistry of irreversible reduction of iron oxides through the Time-Resolved APXPS and Chemometrics

- **TL;DR**: 该研究结合时间分辨环境压力X射线光电子能谱与化学计量学方法（PCA和MCR-ALS），分析Fe2O3还原过程的表面化学动力学，解决光谱重叠问题，揭示中间物种形成机制。

This work presents a study on the application of Time-Resolved Ambient Pressure X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (TR-APXPS) in association with chemometric techniques, specifically Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Multivariate Curve Resolution with Alternating Least Squares (MCR-ALS), to investigate the surface chemistry and dynamics of Fe2O3 reduction processes. The use of TR-APXPS allows for real-time monitoring of chemical changes at the surface of Iron oxides during reduction, providing valuable insights into the reaction mechanisms and kinetics involved. One key challenge in analyzing TR-APXPS data is the presence of overlapping peaks and complex spectral features, which can make accurate quantification and interpretation difficult. Traditional spectral fitting methods may struggle with these complexities and result in ambiguous or inaccurate results. However, the chemometric approaches are promising tools to overcome these challenges by extracting pure spectral profiles of individual chemical species and their temporal profiles from the complex and overlapping data. The results obtained from the TR-APXPS coupled with PCA and MCR-ALS analysis provide a detailed and precise understanding of the surface chemical changes during the Fe2O3 reduction. This includes identifying and following the formation of various intermediate species and their evolution over time, which permits later to establish correlations between surface chemistry and process conditions. The integration of both chemometric tools in TR-APXPS data analysis not only addresses the challenges associated with complex spectral features, but also contributes to a deeper understanding of the underlying chemical changes and their dynamics. The obtained results have significant implications for process optimization, material synthesis, and tailoring of material properties for specific applications.

### Erbium Probes of Magnetic Order in a Layered van der Waals Material

- **TL;DR**: 利用CrSBr中的Er3+缺陷作为原子尺度探针，通过电信波段光致发光光谱和温度依赖性共聚焦成像，从材料内部读取磁性信息，观察到超出体相相界的纳米尺度磁序。

There is growing interest in characterizing magnetic order and dynamics in two-dimensional magnets, yet most efforts to date rely on external probes that interrogate the sample from tens of nanometers away and inevitably average over that length scale. Here we use internal, lattice-embedded Er3+ defects in CrSBr as atomic-scale probes, accessing their telecom-band photoluminescence with spectroscopy and temperature-dependent confocal imaging to read out magnetism from within the material. At room temperature we observe narrow, long-lived photoluminescence (PL) lines in the telecom band, characteristic of erbium emitters. Upon cooling to 3 K and reheating, the Er3+ PL intensity and excited-state lifetime display pronounced thermal hysteresis with a minimum near 132 K, at the reported antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition of CrSBr. Remarkably, we observe magnetic signatures persisting over a broader temperature range than expected from bulk benchmarks, suggesting nanoscale magnetic order that locally survives beyond the nominal phase boundary. Further, a moderate in-plane field of 0.3 T shifts the PL minimum by +8 K, which we tentatively associate to field-biased ferromagnetic correlations.

### Emergent Random Spin Singlets in Disordered Spin-1/2 perovskite BaCu$_{1/3}$Ta$_{2/3}$O$_3$

- **TL;DR**: 在无序钙钛矿BaCu₁/₃Ta₂/₃O₃中，Cu和Ta随机占据晶格位置，形成局部无序但结构受限的磁交换路径，在0.1K以下未观察到磁有序或自旋冻结，表现出由有界随机交换耦合分布主导的量子基态。

We investigate the disordered perovskite BaCu$_{1/3}$Ta$_{2/3}$O$_3$, where Cu (spin-1/2) and Ta randomly occupy a pseudo-cubic lattice. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption spectroscopy establish the local nature of the disorder, revealing the presence of structurally constrained magnetic exchange paths. No magnetic ordering or spin freezing is observed down to 0.1 K. The low-temperature magnetic and thermodynamic behavior is captured by a broad but non-singular distribution $P(J)$ of exchange couplings $J$. These results open the possibility of realizing a disordered quantum ground state where the exchange randomness is broad yet intrinsically bounded, departing from the conventional infinite-randomness fixed point driven random-singlet phase.

### Intertwined Charge and Spin Density Waves in Trilayer Nickelate La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ Revealed by $^{139}$La NQR

- **TL;DR**: 使用核四极共振技术研究La₄Ni₃O₁₀中的密度波有序，发现133K附近存在一级相变，证实了非公度电荷密度波和自旋密度波的复杂相互作用。

The discovery of superconducting transitions in pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ and La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ has highlighted the pivotal role of density wave (DW) orders in nickelate superconductors. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the superconducting state, it is essential to elucidate the nature of the DW order. In this study, we utilized $^{139}$La nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) to investigate the charge density wave (CDW) and spin density wave (SDW) orders in both single-crystal and polycrystalline La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. Near $T_{\rm{DW}} \approx 133$ K, an abrupt change in both the linewidth and frequency of the La(2) site in the single-crystal sample provides compelling evidence for a first-order-like phase transition. The pronounced broadening of the NQR lines indicates the incommensurate nature of the DW order. Furthermore, the spin-lattice relaxation rate divided by temperature 1/$T_1$$T$ exhibits a strong enhancement at $T_{\rm{DW}}$, indicating the strong spin fluctuations above the first-order DW transition. These observations suggest an intricate interplay between incommensurate CDW and SDW orders. Our findings offer critical insights into the microscopic mechanisms of the DW state in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ and establish an essential framework for exploring the interplay between DW and superconducting phases in nickelate superconductors.

### Conformal Quantile Regression for Probabilistic Constitutive Modeling of Anisotropic Soft Materials

- **TL;DR**: 提出一个概率性数据驱动本构建模框架，通过保形分位数回归处理张量场不确定性，为各向异性软组织提供分布无关的预测不确定性量化。

Biological soft tissues exhibit substantial inter-subject variability, making the automation of constitutive material modeling essential for patient-specific analysis and design. Such materials are not only highly nonlinear but also display intrinsic stochasticity arising from their complex and heterogeneous microstructure. Despite recent advances in data-driven constitutive modeling, most existing approaches remain deterministic and fail to quantify predictive uncertainty, thereby limiting their reliability in downstream mechanical analyses. In this work, we propose a probabilistic, data-driven constitutive modeling framework for anisotropic soft materials that explicitly accounts for uncertainty through conformalized quantile regression applied to tensor-valued fields. The proposed framework is built upon a strain-invariant, polyconvex formulation that ensures thermodynamic consistency and promotes robust predictive performance, including in extrapolative regimes. A key advantage of the proposed approach is its simplicity: it can be applied in a plug-and-play manner to endow existing deterministic models with probabilistic predictions, while remaining distribution-free and requiring no assumptions on the underlying data distribution. Moreover, the method is straightforward to train, scalable to models with a large number of parameters, and avoids Monte Carlo sampling at inference, making it computationally efficient and well suited for uncertainty propagation in large-scale mechanical simulations. The proposed method is validated using several benchmark datasets synthesized and collected from the literature.

Predicting polymer glass transition temperatures (Tg) with first-principles fidelity has long remained out of reach, as cooling multi-thousand-atom systems over a broad temperature range at acceptable rates exceeds the computational limits of ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD). Here we employ a hybrid scheme that merges AIMD with accelerated on-the-fly (OTF) machine-learned force-field (MLFF) construction, enabling Tg prediction at quantum-mechanical accuracy with near-classical computational cost. The OTF protocol to construct MLFFs adaptively triggers first-principles calculations only when newly encountered configurations lie outside the current model's domain of confidence, allowing robust, parameter-free MLFFs to be built from merely 1000 AIMD-sampled configurations per polymer. These MLFFs are then utilized to perform long-time cooling simulations on amorphous supercells containing several thousand atoms. Applied across twelve polymers spanning aromatic, aliphatic, heteroatomic, and branched chemistries, the method yields predictions in excellent accord with experiment while reducing computational cost by approximately six orders of magnitude relative to AIMD. This work establishes a new paradigm for predictive polymer modeling, demonstrating that OTF-MLFFs provide a generalizable, accurate, and scalable route to simulating the thermophysical behavior of complex disordered materials at quantum-mechanical fidelity.

Phases with distinct thermodynamic properties must differ in their underlying distributions of microscopic structures. While ordered phases are readily distinguished by unit cells and space groups, the local structural basis differentiating amorphous phases is less apparent. Here, using a new probabilistic data-driven framework applied to molecular simulation data on water, we identify local collective variables that discriminate low-density and high-density amorphous (LDA and HDA) ices and characterize pressure-induced transitions between these phases. As expected, descriptors related to local density capably distinguish LDA and HDA; however, phase identity is surprisingly encoded within the first coordination shell. Furthermore, LDA transitions to HDA by a simple redistribution of LDA- and HDA-like environments with no evident intermediate structures, in accordance with a first-order-like transition that contrasts with the gradual evolution observed in other amorphous systems such as metallic glasses. These findings are robust across force fields, which themselves exhibit structural differences, and exemplify how other systems lacking obvious distinguishing features can be characterized.

### The Illusion of Simplicity: The Dramatic Failure of Koopmans Theorem for Antioxidants in Solvents -- The Ascorbic Acid Paradigm

- **TL;DR**: 该研究通过量子化学计算发现，溶剂环境会显著改变抗氧化剂（以维生素C为例）的化学反应性指数，而Koopmans定理在溶液中完全失效，必须采用包含溶剂效应的绝热计算。

Antioxidants operate in biological environments where solvent effects dramatically alter their redox properties. Using ascorbic acid (vitamin C) as a paradigmatic example, we present a comprehensive quantum-chemical investigation of its global chemical reactivity indices -- ionization potential, electron affinity, HOMO-LUMO gap, hardness, softness, electronegativity, electrophilicity, and electrodonating/accepting powers -- computed at the compound chemistry CBS-QB3 and various DFT levels in vacuo and across six solvents. The results demonstrate that solvation stabilizes charged species so strongly that reactivity indices shift by several electronvolts, following a roughly Born-like dependence on dielectric constant. Most importantly, we show unequivocally that Koopmans' theorem, often used to estimate these indices from orbital energies, fails catastrophically in solution: it predicts solvent-independent values that are qualitatively and quantitatively wrong, missing the essential physics of dielectric screening and geometric relaxation. We therefore conclude that Koopmans' theorem must be abandoned for antioxidant studies in condensed phases; adiabatic calculations with solvent are mandatory for meaningful predictions.

Molecular chirality interacting in a non-negligible manner with the spin angular momentum of subatomic particles, mainly electrons or photons, is the cause of a variety of spin-dependent filtering effects in quantum transport. Among them, spin-selective transport at room temperature is clearly one of the most promising properties in the quest for functional spintronic devices. In this context, two main effects have been experimentally investigated in the past 25 years and have attracted significant interest within the community: the so-called Electronic Magnetochiral Anisotropy (eMChA) and Chirality Induced Spin Selectivity (CISS). Despite extensive research, there is still a lack of consensus in the modeling of their microscopic mechanisms. As a consequence, it remains unclear whether the two are truly distinct or if they originate from a common physical cause. With the long-term goal of modelling the main different theories and to test them against the available experimental evidence, we programmed the core of an efficient kinetic Monte Carlo code. The current code models electron transport under an external voltage, distinguishes between $α$ and $β$ spin currents, and parametrizes molecules by their intrinsic electron mobility and the effective coupling between electron movement, spin and chirality. The code allows obtaining spin filtering values arising from the effective coupling between these three. We obtain an effect that vanishes at low voltages, with the asymmetry between positive and negative voltages typically found in electrical magnetochiral anisotropy experiments.

We introduce a tree tensor network (TTN) impurity solver that enables highly efficient and accurate real-time simulations of quantum impurity models. By decomposing a noninteracting bath Hamiltonian into a Cayley tree, the method provides a tensor network representation that naturally captures the multiscale entanglement structure intrinsic to impurity-bath systems. This geometry differs from conventional chain-based mappings and yields a substantial reduction of entanglement, allowing accurate ground-state properties and long-time dynamics to be captured at significantly lower bond dimensions. Benchmark calculations for the single-impurity Anderson model demonstrate that the TTN solver achieves markedly enhanced resolution of real-frequency spectral functions, without invoking analytic continuation. This impurity solver provides a balanced, scale-uniform description of impurity physics and offers a versatile approach for real-time dynamical mean-field theory and related applications involving quantum impurity models.

The general wave functions for the two-dimensional regular pentagonal quantum box and thin microstrip antenna are derived. As for the square, equilateral triangular, and circular disk-shaped boxes and antennas, there are two quantum nunbers $n$ and $m$. In those cases, $n\ge1 $ and $m\ge 0$ are both unlimited non-negative integers of any value. For the regular pentagon, only $n\ge1 $ is an unlimited positive quantum number, but $m_{\rm min}\le m\le 5$, where $m_{\rm min}=0$ for the pentagonal microstrip antenna with Neumann boundary conditions and $m_{\rm min}=1$ for the pentagonal quantum box with Dirichlet boundary conditions. Color-coded pictures of the wave functions for the regular pentagonal quantum box and microstrip antenna are presented for all allowed $m$ values and for $1\le n\le 2$ and for the microstrip antenna for all allowed $m$ values and $n=3$.

Oscillatory rarefied gas flows are frequently encountered in MEMS, and their efficient numerical simulation remains a major challenge due to the time dependent nature of the problem and the high dimensionality of the Boltzmann kinetic equation. Here, we address this challenge by focusing on the periodic steady state and solving the resulting problem using the frequency domain general synthetic iterative scheme (GSIS). The key idea of GSIS is to simultaneously solve the mesoscopic kinetic equation and the macroscopic synthetic equation. The kinetic equation provides high-order constitutive relations, beyond those given by the Newton law of viscosity and the Fourier law of heat conduction, to the synthetic equation. In turn, the synthetic equation, which converges to the periodic steady state much faster than the kinetic equation, boosts the evolution of the kinetic equation toward the periodic steady state. As a result, super convergence is achieved, together with an asymptotic preserving property that allows the use of coarse spatial grids. The analytical Fourier stability analysis and the Chapman-Enskog expansion, together with challenging numerical simulations, are employed to demonstrate the fast convergence and asymptotic-preserving properties of GSIS, revealing that it can be three orders of magnitude faster than conventional kinetic schemes in near continuum flow regimes.

Potassium niobate (KNbO3) is a prototypical perovskite ferroelectric with large electro-optic and nonlinear optical responses, high optical damage thresholds and a rich sequence of temperature-driven phase transformations, making it a promising platform for tunable photonic devices. In this work, we develop a thermodynamic model for the coupled ferroelectric and optical properties of KNbO3. By separating the total polarization into lattice and electronic contributions, the model provides a unified description of both the anisotropic ferroelectric and optical properties. The thermodynamic coefficients are determined by fitting to experimental measurements of the spontaneous polarization, dielectric susceptibilities, lattice parameters, and refractive indices. Without any further fitting, the model quantitatively predicts the temperature dependence of the electro-optic and piezoelectric coefficients in close agreement with experimental measurements. By utilizing the electronic polarization equation of motion, the model further captures the optical dispersion in the near infrared to visible spectrum. This work provides the thermodynamic foundation for future studies of coupled ferroelectric and optical phenomena in KNbO3.

We investigate an off-diagonal quasicrystal featuring simultaneous off-diagonal and diagonal quasiperiodic modulations. By analyzing the fractal dimension, we map out the delocalization-localization phase diagram. We demonstrate that delocalized and localized states can be distinguished via the Wigner distribution, while extended, critical, and localized phases are separated using the Wigner entropy. Furthermore, we explore the quantum thermodynamic properties, revealing that localized states facilitate the emergence of a quantum heater mode, alongside the appearance of a refrigerator mode. These findings enhance our understanding of localization phenomena and expand the thermodynamic applications of quasiperiodic systems.

- **TL;DR**: ChemNavigator是一个自主AI系统，通过假设驱动的探索发现有机光催化剂的结构-性能关系，自主推导出6个统计显著的设计规则，对应已知的有机电子结构原理。

The discovery of high-performance organic photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution remains limited by the vastness of chemical space and the reliance on human intuition for molecular design. Here we present ChemNavigator, an agentic AI system that autonomously derives structure-property relationships through hypothesis-driven exploration of organic photocatalyst candidates. The system integrates large language model reasoning with density functional tight binding calculations in a multi-agent architecture that mirrors the scientific method: formulating hypotheses, designing experiments, executing calculations, and validating findings through rigorous statistical analysis. Through iterative discovery cycles encompassing 200 molecules, ChemNavigator autonomously identified six statistically significant design rules governing frontier orbital energies, including the effects of ether linkages, carbonyl groups, extended conjugation, cyano groups, halogen substituents, and amine groups. Importantly, these rules correspond to established principles of organic electronic structure (resonance donation, inductive withdrawal, $π$-delocalization), demonstrating that the system can independently derive chemical knowledge without explicit programming. Notably, autonomous agentic reasoning extracted these six validated rules from a molecular library where previous ML approaches identified only carbonyl effects. Furthermore, the quantified effect sizes provide a prioritized ranking for synthetic chemists, while feature interaction analysis revealed diminishing returns when combining strategies, challenging additive assumptions in molecular design. This work demonstrates that agentic AI systems can autonomously derive interpretable, chemically grounded design principles, establishing a framework for AI-assisted materials discovery that complements rather than replaces chemical intuition.

We consider the minimal coupling of a Dirac semimetal Hamiltonian to a generic spin-texture in this work. A simple unitary transformation gauges away the spatial dependence in the exchange term, leading to the generation of effective corrections to the Dirac dispersion. A full function's worth of freedom is obtained as a result. Choosing different pitch vectors, we show that many forms of novel phenomena arise in such systems. For example, a linear pitch vector leads to the generation of type-I Weyl semimetal -- we observe the anomalous Hall effect and the chiral magnetic effect. The anomalous Hall coefficient requires a non-zero pitch vector whereas the CME is proportional to the exchange coupling. The band structure of the model in the presence of a magnetic field shows a Lifshitz transition. The introduction of a suitable time dependent pitch vector leads to the formation of nodal spheres in the Sambe space of effective Hamiltonians. This nodal sphere is robust to all orders in van-Vleck perturbation theory as proven explicitly.

Normalizing flows have recently demonstrated the ability to learn the Boltzmann distribution of the Hubbard model, opening new avenues for generative modeling in condensed matter physics. In this work, we investigate the steps required to extend such simulations to larger lattice sizes and lower temperatures, with a focus on enhancing stability and efficiency. Additionally, we present the scaling behavior of stochastic normalizing flows and non-equilibrium Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for this fermionic system.

- **TL;DR**: 在CaKAs₄Fe₄超导体中，通过STM观测发现即使在0.5Tc的低温下，也存在局域化的涡旋液滴区域，表明局部耗散起始温度远低于Tc。

Type-II superconductors under magnetic fields are in a quantum coherent non-dissipative state as long as vortices remain pinned. Dissipation appears when vortices depin, eventually driven by thermal fluctuations. This can be associated to a melting transition between a vortex solid and a vortex liquid. This transition is almost always observed very close to T$_c$ when probed by macroscopic experiments. However, it remains unclear how the vortex solid responds to thermal fluctuations at the scale of individual vortices far from the melting transition. Here we use scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) to visualize vortices in CaKAs$_4$Fe$_4$ (T$_c \approx$ 35 K). We find vortex liquid droplets-localized regions in space where vortices strongly fluctuate due to thermal exctiation-at temperatures as low as 0.5\,T$_c$. Our results show that the onset of dissipation at the local scale occurs at temperatures considerably below T$_c$ in type-II superconductors.

### Smooth Polar B-Splines with High-Order Regularity at the Origin

- **TL;DR**: 提出一种在单位圆盘上使用极坐标的平滑B样条离散化方法，修正了标准张量积B样条在原点处因坐标奇异性导致的规则性损失。

We introduce a smooth B-spline discretization in polar coordinates on the unit disc that corrects the loss of regularity present at the origin caused by the coordinate singularity in standard tensor-product B-spline formulations. The method constructs "smooth polar splines" via a Galerkin projection of harmonic polar functions $S_l^{-m}(r,θ) := r^l \sin(mθ)$ and $S_l^{m}(r,θ) := r^l \cos(mθ)$, derived from the polar representation of Cartesian monomials, onto the central tensor-product B-spline basis in the innermost radial region. The radial component reproduces $r^l$ exactly for $0 \le l \leq p$, where $p$ is the B-spline degree, satisfying the near-origin regularity condition. However, exact compatibility with $C^\infty$-regularity at the origin is recovered only in the limit $Δθ\to 0$, when the angular component resolves all angular harmonics accurately. The smooth polar splines are linear combinations of standard tensor-product B-splines and lie in the same function space, enabling mapping between the $C^\infty$-regular subspace and the original discretization space via an exact prolongation operator and a corresponding restriction operator acting on the discrete variables. They match standard tensor-product B-splines away from the origin, preserve orthogonality among the newly constructed origin-centered basis functions, and maintain local support and sparse matrices. This smoothness and locality improve the conditioning of mass and stiffness matrices, conserve charge, and reduce statistical errors in particle-in-cell simulations near the origin, while eliminating spurious eigenvalues in eigenvalue problems. The approach provides a robust, high-order, and efficient adaptation of tensor-product B-splines for polar coordinates in physics simulations.

There are conflicting predictions and reports on the character of the exciton Mott transition (EMT) in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides. It could be either a discontinuous or a continuous transition from the excitonic to the plasma phase, with important implications for devices such as photoswitches. To resolve the nature of the transition in monolayer WS$_2$, we study its ultrafast optical response upon resonant photoexcitation of the A exciton across a broad range of photoexcitation densities. In agreement with previously reported measurements we observe that the A exciton quenches gradually with increasing excitation density. However, a detailed lineshape analysis unveils an abrupt red shift in the transient peak positions of the A and B exciton resonances above an excitation density threshold. This is attributed to band gap renormalization arising from the formation of free charge carrier plasma, i.e., the EMT. The plasma phase decays with a time constant of 0.65 ps back into the excitonic state. The abrupt appearance of the plasma phase at the threshold density suggests that the EMT is a discontinuous and not a continuous transition. This work demonstrates how transient optical spectroscopy combined with lineshape analysis of two excitonic resonances simultaneously can be used to investigate the EMT in 2D materials.

We study the sum of first passage times along an arbitrary cycle made up of N&gt;2 states of a small physical system. We show that, if the system is at thermodynamic equilibrium, this sum follows the same probability distribution regardless of whether the cycle is explored clockwise or counterclockwise. Out of equilibrium, the distributions of clockwise and counterclockwise cyclic first passage times are related by a detailed fluctuation theorem. This result descends from a symmetry of clockwise and counterclockwise trajectories, which combines time reversal with swapping portions of the trajectories. We then relate the entropy produced along the cycle with the entropy production of the whole system using large deviation theory. Our results reveal a novel symmetry in stochastic systems, of potential broad applicability in non-equilibrium physics.

### General-order degenerate coupled-cluster theory

A size-extensive, converging, black-box coupled-cluster ($Δ$CC) ansatz is introduced that computes the energies and wave functions of stationary states from any degenerate or nondegenerate Slater-determinant references with any numbers of $α$- and $β$-spin electrons, any patterns of orbital occupancy, any spin multiplicities, and any spatial symmetries. For a nondegenerate reference, it is identical to the single-reference, projection coupled-cluster ansatz. For degenerate references, it is a natural coupled-cluster extension of degenerate RS perturbation ($Δ$MP) theory, and is closely related to, but distinct from Li and Paldus's state-universal multireference coupled-cluster (SUMRCC) theory. For ionized and electron-attached references, it can be viewed as a coupled-cluster Green's function, although the present theory is convergent toward the full-configuration-interaction (FCI) limits, while many-body Green's function (MBGF) theory generally is not. Its single-excitation instance is a projection (nonvariational) Hartree-Fock theory for a degenerate or nondegenerate reference as per the Thouless theorem, whose practical utility seems rather limited except for core ionizations, high-spin states, and possibly electron affinities. A determinant-based, general-order algorithm is implemented, generating $Δ$CC energies through connected octuple excitations, which are compared with the results from CI, equation-of-motion coupled-cluster (EOM-CC), and SUMRCC theories up to the FCI limits as well as from $Δ$MP and MBGF theories up to the 19th order. An algebraic, optimal-scaling, order-by-order algorithm is also computer-synthesized at the levels of single excitations only and of single and double excitations. The order of performance is: $Δ$CC $&gt;$ EOM-CC $&gt;$ CI at the same order or $Δ$CC $&gt;$ $Δ$MP $&gt;$ MBGF at the same cost scaling.

Understanding skyrmion-skyrmion interactions is crucial for effectively manipulating the motion of multiple skyrmions in racetrack and logic devices. However, the fundamental nature and microscopic origins of these interactions remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigate skyrmion-skyrmion interactions in chiral magnetic films and reveal that they possess intrinsic, anisotropic, and oscillatory characteristics. Specifically, we demonstrate that the attractive and repulsive forces between skyrmions oscillate with a well-defined period, akin to the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) coupling observed between two magnetic moments in metals. Our analysis uncovers the essential physics behind a previously unrecognized universal wavy tail in the skyrmion spin texture. Notably, the resulting RKKY-like interaction between skyrmions is universal for all tilted skyrmions, irrespective of whether the titled easy-axis is from an external field or a crystalline magnetic anisotropy. These findings introduce a novel physical principle for the design of skyrmion molecules or skyrmion superstructures, which hold significant potential for applications in skyrmion-based spintronics and neuromorphic computing.

### Quantum Hyperuniformity and Quantum Weight

Extending hyperuniformity from classical to quantum fluctuations in electron systems yields a framework that identifies quantum phase transitions and reveals underlying gap structures through the quantum weight. We study long-wavelength fluctuations of many-body ground states through the charge-density structure factor by incorporating intrinsic quantum fluctuations into hyperuniformity. Although charge fluctuations at zero temperature are generally suppressed by particle-number conservation, their long-wavelength scaling reveals distinct universal behaviors that define quantum hyperuniformity classes. By exemplifying the Aubry-Andre model, we find that gapped, gapless, and localized-critical-extended phases are sharply distinguished by the quantum hyperuniformity classes. Notably, at the critical point, multifractal wave functions generate anomalous scaling behavior. We further show that, in quantum-hyperuniform gapped phases, the quantum weight provides a quantitative measure of the gap size through a universal power-law scaling. Along with classical hyperuniformity, quantum hyperuniformity serves a direct fingerprint of quantum criticality and a practical probe of quantum phase transitions in aperiodic electron systems.

We combine $GW$ plus extended dynamical mean field theory ($GW$+EDMFT) with the density functional theory for superconductors (SCDFT) framework to study the electronic properties of LiTi$_2$O$_4$. Excellent agreement with experiment is obtained for the density of states, mass enhancement, Sommerfeld coefficient and superconducting $T_c$, if the dynamical nature of the screened Coulomb interaction is taken into account. Our results show that the coupling to collective charge fluctuations (plasmons) plays an important role in the pairing mechanism and explains the remarkably high $T_c$ of this moderately correlated spinel compound.

Machine learning models for functional materials design require precise and informative representations of material systems. Common representations encode atomic composition and bonding but often do not include local coordination environments across chemically diverse crystals. Recurring structural motifs provide a motif level description of crystalline solids and can serve as interpretable descriptors for structure property learning. To analyze the motif connectivity in materials, we construct a bipartite material motif network from 131,548 Materials Project entries, with materials and motifs as the two node sets. Edges connect materials to their constituent motifs and are weighted by motif distortion, which quantifies the strength of each material motif association. Network connectivity is analyzed to identify motif-defined material clusters that capture recurring local geometries relevant to structure property trends. Most shared motifs act as hubs that connect otherwise disconnected regions of the network, enabling motif guided screening by expanding from known motifs to nearby materials in the same neighborhoods. A network embedding step converts this weighted connectivity into vector representations of materials. Using these motif informed embeddings, property prediction yields a formation energy mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.157 eV per atom and a bandgap MAE of 0.601 eV. These results indicate that motif connectivity provides a compact, interpretable representation that complements existing descriptors for scalable screening and structure property modeling.

The fundamental thermodynamic origins of this sensitivity remains elusive. Here, by decomposing the Helmholtz free energy across three representative repulsive systems, we reveal a universal competition between energy and entropy that dictates the melting pathway. The energetic contribution consistently imparts convexity to the free energy, whereas entropy imparts concavity. A first-order transition occurs when concave entropy dominates; otherwise, the transition is continuous. Further decomposition shows that vibrational entropy drives the concave total entropic curvature, while the configurational entropy's curvature switches from convex (first-order) to concave (continuous), mirroring defect proliferation measured by Shannon entropy. The convexity of the energy is dominated by the inherent potential, with minimal vibrational influence. Finally, we predict and verify that the first-order transition becomes continuous at zero temperature, where entropic effects vanish. Our work establishes the curvature of different thermodynamic quantities as a fundamental principle for understanding the nature of two-dimensional melting.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文提出了一种称为CMET（完全修正相遇理论）的通用理论，用于描述多阶段反应扩散过程中的微观相关性，解决了传统质量作用定律的局限性。

Reaction-diffusion processes play an important role in a variety of physical, chemical, and biological systems. Conventionally, the kinetics of these processes are described by the law of mass action. However, there are various cases where these equations are insufficient. A fundamental challenge lies in accurately accounting for the microscopic correlations that inevitably arise in bimolecular reactions. While approaches to describe microscopic correlations in many specific cases exist, no general theory for multistage reactions has been established. In this article, we apply the quantum field theory approach to derive kinetic equations for general multistage reactive systems termed CMET (complete modified encounter theory). CMET can be formulated as a set of coupled partial differential equations that can be easily integrated numerically, thereby serving as a versatile tool for investigating reaction-diffusion processes. Across multiple case studies, we demonstrated that CMET reproduces the kinetics predicted by many other theories within their respective scopes of applicability.

The nonlinear Nernst and Seebeck effects (NNE and NSE) offer promising routes for thermoelectric energy conversion in non-magnetic systems. While intrinsic mechanisms such as the nonlinear Drude and Berry-curvature-dipole terms are well established, extrinsic contributions to thermoelectric responses arising from disorder-induced asymmetric scattering remain comparatively less explored, despite growing experimental evidence of their dominance. Here, we develop a unified semiclassical theory of NNE and NSE that incorporates skew scattering and side-jump processes, identifying four distinct extrinsic contributions to NNE and two for NSE. A systematic symmetry analysis shows that these responses are allowed in time-reversal-symmetric non-magnets, PT-symmetric antiferromagnets, and non-centrosymmetric magnetic systems such as altermagnets. As a case study, we demonstrate that ABA-stacked trilayer graphene hosts large nonlinear Nernst and Seebeck responses dominated by extrinsic scattering, in excellent agreement with recent experiments. Our results establish the microscopic origin of these effects and provide guiding principles for designing high-efficiency nonlinear thermoelectric devices.

- **TL;DR**: 在扭曲MoTe2双层结构中，通过泵浦-探测圆二色性测量发现，在空穴填充v=-4/3时存在具有时间反演对称性的分数拓扑绝缘体候选态，表现为零磁化窗口和一级相变。

The interplay among electronic correlation, topology, and time-reversal-symmetry (TRS) often leads to exotic quantum states of matter. Primary examples include the recently realized fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) in twisted MoTe2 bilayers (tMoTe2) and multilayer graphene aligned with hBN, where TRS is broken in partially filled flat moire Chern bands. Among the FCIs in tMoTe2, the most robust is at a hole filling of v = -2/3 per moire unit cell. Interestingly, transient optical sensing and more recent transport measurements revealed a correlated state at v = -4/3, twice the filling factor for the v = -2/3 FCI. Here, employing pump-probe circular dichroism (CD) measurements on tMoTe2 with twist angles = 3.9 degree and 3.7 degree, we find that the v = -4/3 state exhibits vanishing magnetization (m = 0) in finite windows of out-of-plane magnetic field less than ~2-4 mT, and a first order phase transition to + - m states at higher fields. This out-of-plane antiferromagnetic (AFM) like behavior is notably absent for all other correlated states and disappears for the v = -4/3 state at higher or lower twist angles = 4.0 degree and 3.3 degree. The observed magnetic signature at v = -4/3 is consistent with a predicted fractional topological insulator (FTI) with TRS, consisting of two copies of -2/3 FCIs with opposite chiralities. We support these findings with calculations in the interacting continuum model of tMoTe2. Our work presents a candidate for fractional topological insulators with TRS.

- **TL;DR**: CeSiI是一种新型可剥离范德华重费米子金属，在高压下通过抑制反铁磁序出现超导圆顶，成为首个范德华重费米子超导体，展现出非常规配对机制和量子临界行为。

CeSiI is a newly discovered exfoliable van der Waals (vdW) heavy-fermion metal featured by a long-range antiferromagnetic (AF) order (TN =7.5 K) inside the Kondo coherent state below T* = 50 K. To gain a more profound understanding of the intriguing physics of this material and to uncover novel phenomena driven by quantum criticality, it is imperative to construct the phase diagram of CeSiI detailing the evolutions of T* and TN as a function of external tuning parameters such as pressure (P).In this study, we employ high pressure as an effective tuning knob to investigate this system, thereby generating a comprehensive T-P phase diagram of CeSiI. This diagram is characterized by an unusual V-shaped nonmonotonic evolution of T*(P) and the emergence of a superconducting dome with Tcmax = 240 mK upon suppression of AF order at Pc = 6 GPa, coinciding with the minimum of T*(P).The close proximity of the superconductivity (SC) to the AF instability and an unusually large upper critical field Bc2(0) exceeding 4-7 times the Pauli paramagnetic limit, suggests an unconventional pairing mechanism in CeSiI. Further analyses of normal-state transport properties provide evidence of quantum criticality, i.e., non-Fermi-liquid behavior and divergence of quasiparticle effective mass near Pc = 7 GPa. Our findings not only establish CeSiI as the first vdW heavy-fermion superconductor but also highlight an unconventional nature for the Kondo coherent state at T* at ambient pressure, hence opening a new avenue to study the interplay of strong electron correlation, Kondo hybridization, magnetism, and unconventional SC in the vdW heavy-fermion systems.

Magnetic nanoparticles beyond the single-domain limit often develop vortex-like magnetization textures arising from the competition between exchange and magnetostatic energies. While such states are routinely studied using micromagnetic simulations, transparent analytical descriptions of vortex-mediated hysteresis and nucleation remain scarce. Here, we develop a semi-analytical minimal framework for vortex states in spherical magnetic nanoparticles. Guided by micromagnetic simulations, we introduce a parametrized vortex magnetization Ansatz based on hyperbolic functions that continuously interpolates between uniform and vortex states. In this way, we achieve a complexity reduction leading to a minimal Hamiltonian, which enables the efficient computation of magnetization curves and provides insight into vortex-mediated magnetization reversal. As an application, we derive analytical estimates for the critical vortex nucleation radius and field, recovering the functional form of Brown's classic result and extending it within a variational framework.

Continuous measurement of quantum systems provides a standard route to quantum trajectories through the successive acquisition of information which further results in measurement back-action. In this work, we harness this back-action as a resource for global $U(1)$ symmetry restoration where continuous measurement is combined with a $U(1)$-preserving unitary evolution. Starting from a $U(1)$ symmetry-broken initial state, we simulate quantum trajectories generated by continuous measurements of both global and local observables. We show that under global monitoring, states containing superpositions of distant charge sectors restore symmetry faster than those involving nearby sectors. We establish the universality of this behavior across different measurement protocols. Finally, we demonstrate that local monitoring can further accelerate symmetry restoration for certain states that relax slowly under global monitoring.

- **TL;DR**: cuGUGA是一个基于GPU加速的图形酉群方法(GUGA)配置相互作用(CI)求解器，在自旋适应的配置态函数(CSF)基中实现，通过动态规划实现常数时间CSF排序/反排序，在RTX 4090上相比CPU后端可获得约10倍加速。

We present cuGUGA, an operator-direct graphical unitary group approach (GUGA) configuration interaction (CI) solver in a spin-adapted configuration state function (CSF) basis. Dynamic-programming walk counts provide constant-time CSF ranking/unranking, and pretabulated segment factors enable constant-time evaluation of coupling coefficients. Two-electron contributions are organized through an intermediate-weight formulation that separates sparse generator enumeration from integral contraction and supports both dense and density-fitted/Cholesky backends. We further map the same primitives to GPUs by implementing the irregular DRT traversal and accumulation in custom CUDA kernels while delegating contractions to CUDA libraries. The implementation reproduces reference energies at the 10^{-11} Eh level and matches CPU/GPU sigma-vectors to 10^{-14}. On an RTX 4090, the GPU backend provides up to ~10x speedup over the CPU backend for smaller active spaces and multifold speedups on representative CASCI kernels. Speedup decreases as the active space grows because the workload becomes increasingly dominated by FP64 GEMM, which is not strongly accelerated on consumer GPUs. In addition, the cuGUGA CPU backend generally delivers &gt;2x speedup over PySCF's determinant backend and &gt;4x speedup over PySCF CSF backend.

Magnetic hopfions are three-dimensional topological solitons -- knotted, vortex-like spin configurations. In chiral magnets, hopfions can appear as isolated structures or they can be linked to skyrmion strings. Previous studies employed a sophisticated protocol and a special sample geometry to nucleate such hopfions linked to one or a few skyrmion strings. Here, we introduce an electric-current-assisted nucleation protocol that is simple and independent of the sample shape and size. The resulting hopfions exhibit extraordinary stability in the presence of both positive and negative magnetic fields, in perfect agreement with micromagnetic simulations. We also present a comprehensive framework for classifying hopfions, skyrmions, and merons by deriving the corresponding homotopy group.

Motivated by the objective of quantifying the energetic cost of accessing boundary phases through local control, we investigate here a simple, analytically tractable quantum impurity model. This model exhibits a rich boundary phase diagram, characterized by phases with different numbers of edge states. By considering a local quench protocol that drives the system out of equilibrium, we calculate exactly the resulting quantum work distribution across these phases. Our results show that the presence of edge states strongly alters this distribution. In particular, we analytically determine key fingerprints of these states both near the low-energy threshold and in the high-energy region.

Owing to strong electronic correlations, high-temperature superconductivity always exhibits intricate intertwinement with various competing electronic orders in phase diagrams, such as spin/charge density waves (S/CDWs). In cuprate superconductors,the intertwinement of superconductivity and CDW order could strongly affect the fundamental properties of superconductivity, such as the critical temperature(Tc) and critical magnetic field(Hc). Recent high-field transport measurements indicate that when quantum fluctuations become important at low temperatures and high magnetic fields, the CDW order also reshapes the vortex states, which leads to fragile superconductivity with extremely low critical current(Jc). Here, by performing comprehensive high-field transport measurements, the H-T phase diagram of vortex states is mapped to H = 33 T in a quasi-two-dimensional FeSe-based superconductor (TBA+)xFeSe with a zero-resistivity transition temperature above 40 K. Our results indicate that (TBA+)xFeSe is an extremely type II superconductor with significant thermal fluctuations.At low temperatures, high magnetic fields cause the vortex solid state to exhibit similar current-dependent zero-resistance behavior as the fragile superconductivity in cuprate superconductors with CDW order. When the vortex solid state is melted with increasing temperature, a superconducting regime with vortex-like phase fluctuations emerges as an intermediate state, which features finite longitudinal resistance and vanishing Hall resistance. At higher temperatures, a vortex liquid state with finite Hall resistance eventually appears due to thermal fluctuations. All these observations suggest exotic vortex states beyond the classical paradigm of vortex matter.

### Polarization Switching of Piezoelectric Films due to Proximity of Ferroelectric Nanoclusters

Using Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire thermodynamical approach and finite element modelling, we studied the influence of nanoclusters shape on the polarization switching and domain nucleation emerging in otherwise non-switchable piezoelectric films due to the proximity of ferroelectric nanoclusters. The boundary of the ferroelectric nanocluster embedded in the piezoelectric film is a compositionally graded layer. We analyzed the conditions, which allow switching the electric polarization of the piezoelectric AlN film at coercive field significantly lower than the electric breakdown field due to the proximity of ferroelectric Al1-xScxN clusters. Due to proximity effect, the spontaneous polarization switches in all elements of the nanopatterned film, and corresponding coercive fields can be reduced significantly in the presence of spike-like Al1-xScxN clusters. We also explored the underlaying physical mechanisms of the proximity effects in the piezoelectric films with ferroelectric nanoclusters. The internal field, which is depolarizing inside the piezoelectric film (due to the larger spontaneous polarization of AlN) and polarizing in the ferroelectric cluster (due to the smaller spontaneous polarization of Al1-xScxN), lowers the potential barrier in the clusters and facilitates the instant growth of nanodomains (emerging in the clusters) through the piezoelectric film. Since considered nanostructured materials can be created by implantation of Sc ions into AlN films, obtained theoretical results can be useful for creation of nanopatterned ferroelectrics by chemical engineering, with exciting prospects for previously unrealizable ferroelectric memory technologies.

- **TL;DR**: 开发新的训练工作流程解决CCSD(T)级别机器学习势能面训练不稳定的问题，通过主动学习、中间力标签和集成知识蒸馏技术，显著提升了水模型的稳定性，在多种性质上达到最先进水平。

In our previous work, we developed a CCSD(T)-level range-separated water force field that combines the power of physics-driven and machine learning models. However, it was found that expensive CCSD(T)/CBS calculations lead to limited number of QM data as well as the missing of force labels, both of which lead to training instability issues. Bulk properties show large variations that cannot be resolved by simply reducing the fitting error in small cluster QM dataset. Such instability in bulk phase simulation is a universal problem in the training of machine learning potentials (MLPs), and is particularly severe at CCSD(T) level of theory.In this work, using our range-separated water model as an example, we aim to overcome these limitations by developing a new training workflow. It is composed by several techniques including: 1. an active learning protocol that ensures more thorough sampling in different temperatures and densities; 2. an intermediate force label technique employing machine learning density functional; and 3. an ensemble knowledge distillation (EKD) method. These techniques significantly stabilize the resulting water model, consistently achieving sub-chemical accuracies in both cluster energies and experimental properties. Benchmarks are carried out for various properties including densities, radial distribution functions (RDFs), dielectric constants, diffusivity, and infrared spectra, all showing state-of-the-art (SOTA) performances and proving the effectiveness of the training protocol.

We theoretically investigate dispersion of plasma waves propagating in a lateral plasmonic crystal based on a two-dimensional electron system with grating gates. Two specific configurations are analyzed: a system with single grating gate having ungated gaps and a double-grating-gate system. We calculate the dispersion relations for the fundamental and several higher-order plasma modes, classifying them as either ${\it bright}$ or ${\it dark}$ excitations. At the boundaries of the Brillouin zones, the dispersion of both types of excitations is shown to be quadratic, justifying introduction of effective bright and dark plasmon masses. In the low-frequency limit, the plasmonic crystal spectrum exhibits an acoustic plasma mode characterized by a certain velocity. We demonstrate that the effective plasmon mass and acoustic velocity are highly sensitive to both the crystal geometry (specifically the lattice filling factor) and the gate voltages, enabling wide-range tunability.

The fuzzy sphere regularization provides a powerful framework for studying three-dimensional (3D) conformal field theories (CFTs) by mapping them onto numerically tractable lattice models on the spherical lowest Landau level. However, the system sizes accessible to this method have been limited by the exact diagonalization (ED). In this work, we transcend this limitation by combining the fuzzy sphere regularization with a sophisticated multi-target density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm. Focusing on the 3D Ising-type model on the spherical lowest Landau level, we calculate the 24 low-lying energies at a larger system size than previously feasible with ED. At criticality, we extract the scaling dimensions of six primary operators, and the results show significantly improved agreement with bootstrap benchmarks compared to previous ED results at smaller sizes. Our approach allows us to efficiently target multiple excited states in larger systems beyond the reach of exact diagonalization. This study establishes the fuzzy sphere regularization combined with advanced DMRG techniques as a powerful and general framework for precision physics in 3D CFTs.

Superconducting systems may display different types of nonequilibrium states depending on the specific constraints imposed for measurement. We probe current-voltage relations of three-dimensional superconducting films by allowing finite voltages to develop across their length. Our experiments reveal sharp features of negative differential conductance which highlight the validity of the principle of minimum entropy production at the critical current transition. We have observed dissipative states with resistances intermediate between those of superconducting and normal phases at zero applied magnetic field, indicating a phenomenon of phase coexistence under nonequilibrium conditions. The features of steady states reported here are not accessible in conventional transport experiments with current-biasing methods.

Emergent quasiparticles in solids often exhibit unique topological properties as a result of the complex interplay between charge, orbital, spin and lattice degrees of freedom. Among these quasiparticles, the polaron occupies a special place as the first known manifestation of the interaction between a fermion and a boson field. While polarons have been investigated for almost a century, whether these quasiparticles exhibit topological properties and why remain open questions. Here, we establish the universal symmetry principles governing the topology of polar textures in large polarons. Using a group-theoretic analysis, we identify four distinct classes of polar textures in time-reversal-invariant systems, and we show that they carry integer topological charges. We validate this classfication by performing state-of-the-art first-principles calculations of materials representative of each class. For these materials, we compute the fingerprints of polaron topology in Huang diffuse scattering, and propose ultrafast electron and X-ray scattering experiments to detect these quasiparticles.

We study the bimolecular nucleophilic substitution (S$_\mathrm{N}$2) reaction of 1-phenyl-2-trimethylsilylacetylene (PTA) under vibrational strong coupling (VSC) from the perspective of high-level ab initio quantum and polaritonic chemistry. Specifically, we address conflicting mechanistic proposals, cavity-induced electronic corrections under VSC and the relevance of a previously debated Si-C-stretching motion of PTA for vibrational polariton formation. We first provide computational evidence for a two-step mechanism based on density functional theory and high-level coupled cluster results, identify new encounter and products complexes and illustrate the relevance of diffuse basis functions for a qualitatively correct description of anionic reactive systems. We subsequently show that cavity-induced dipole fluctuation corrections of electronic energies can be significant on the level of cavity Born-Oppenheimer coupled cluster theory and discuss their qualitative impact on the proposed two-step mechanism taking into account cavity-induced molecular reorientation. We finally show that the Si-C-stretching contribution to the experimentally relevant double-peak feature of PTA exhibits a dominant dipole character, which renders it central for linear IR response and vibrational polariton formation despite the presence of CH$_3$-rocking contributions. The dipole character along the cleaving Si-C-bond is eventually shown to rationalize Rabi splittings throughout the proposed two-step mechanism. Our work refines the microscopic perspective on the S$_\mathrm{N}$2 reaction of PTA under VSC and highlights recent developments in ab initio polaritonic chemistry for the VSC regime.

Motivated by the unique dispersions close to the two dimensional band crossing in a topologically charged nodal surface semimetal (NSSM) spectrum, we perform theoretical analysis of quantum tunnelling through a junction consisting of such NSSM, an insulator and a s-wave superconductor (acronymed NSSM-I-SC junction). In particular, for excitation energies both more and less than the superconducting gap potential $Δ$ we probe the normal and Andreev conductance for different incident orientations and thereby find the tunnelling electrical conductance through the heterostructure. The present work considers only the thin barrier limit which witness the conductance G to oscillate periodically with frequency $π$ as a function of the barrier strength, both in high and low doping limit. Such periodic behavior is also observed while calculating the thermal conductance $κ$ through the junction. Novelty of this problem is that the behavior of these G or $κ$ with insulator width are, in many respect, different compared to that from a normal metal - insulator - superconductor (NIS) junction on graphene or silicene. The findings can thus motivate experimentalists to culture renewed control over electric or thermal transport on topological materials.

Magnetic skyrmions are topological quasiparticles potentially useful for memory and computing devices. Antiferromagnetic (AF) skyrmions present no transverse deflection, making them suitable candidates for data storage applications. After the discovery of skyrmions with length scales comparable to the lattice constant, several works presented quantum analogues of classical ferromagnetic skyrmions in spin systems. However, studies about quantum analogues of AF skyrmions are still lacking. Here, we explore the phases of the AF quantum spin-1/2 Heisenberg model with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions on the triangular lattice using the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm. We study the magnetization profile, spin structure factor and quantum entanglement of the resulting ground states to characterize the corresponding phases and signal the emergence of quantum AF skyrmions. Our results support that three-sublattice quantum antiferromagnetic skyrmion textures are stabilized in a wide range of magnetic fields.

- **TL;DR**: 通过共振驱动光学拉曼模式，在K₃C₆₀中实现室温光诱导超导，解释了实验中观察到的巨大共振增强效应。

Pump-probe experiments performed on $\mathrm{K}_3\mathrm{C}_{60}$ have unveiled both optical and transport signatures of metastable light-induced superconductivity up to room temperature, far above $T_c$. Recent experiments have uncovered that excitation in the vicinity of $50 ~\textrm{meV}$ enables the observation of high temperature light-induced superconductivity at significantly lower fluences. Inspired by these experiments we develop a mechanism which can explain such a giant resonant enhancement of light-induced superconductivity. Within a minimal non-linear Holstein model, we show that resonantly driving optical Raman modes leads to a time-dependent electron-phonon coupling. Such a coupling then modulates the effective electron-electron attraction, with the strongest modulations occurring when the drive is resonant with the phonon frequency. These dynamical modulations of the pairing interactions lead to Floquet-BCS instabilities at temperatures far exceeding equilibrium $T_c$, as observed in experiments. We conclude by discussing the implications of our general analysis on the $\mathrm{K}_3\mathrm{C}_{60}$ experiments specifically and suggesting experimental signatures of our mechanism.

- **TL;DR**: 开发3D卷积神经网络分类器，能高精度区分真实实验合成沸石与计算预测的沸石结构，准确率比传统方法高一个数量级

A suite of classifiers was developed to distinguish real, experimentally realized zeolites from computationally predicted zeolite like structures. Using 3D convolutional neural networks applied to volumetric distance grids, these classifiers achieve accuracies more than an order of magnitude higher than previous approaches based on geometric filters or other machine learning methods. The best-performing model differentiates among hypothetical zeolites and those that can be synthesized as silicates, as aluminophosphates, or as both. This four-class classifier attains a false negative rate of 3.4% and a false positive rate of 0.4%, misidentifying only 1,207 of over 330,000 hypothetical structures -- even though the hypothetical structures exhibit similar formation energies as real zeolites and chemically reasonable bond lengths and angles. We hypothesize that the ZeoNet representation captures essential structural features correlated with synthetic feasibility. In the absence of comprehensive physics-based criteria for synthesizability, the small subset of misclassified hypothetical structures likely represents promising candidates for future experimental synthesis.

Multiterminal Josephson junctions offer a powerful playground for exploring exotic superconducting and topological phenomena beyond the reach of conventional two-terminal devices. In this work, we present the direct spectroscopic observation of Cooper quartet resonances, a signature of correlated tunneling of two Cooper pairs across the device, in a graphene three-terminal Josephson junction (3TJJ). Using tunneling spectroscopy, we visualize how Andreev bound states (ABS) evolve across a two-dimensional superconducting phase space, controlled by the two independent phase differences in the 3TJJ. These measurements reveal sharp local minima in the differential conductance spectra locked in a specific phase condition of superconducting phase variables. The resulting quantized trajectories around the compact torus of the superconducting phase variables reveal an underlying topological winding in the multipair transport. To interpret our results, we develop a theoretical model that connects the observed quartet resonances to the coherent hybridization of multiple ABS branches, a hallmark of the rich pairing process enabled by multiterminal geometries. Our results highlight the potential of multiterminal superconducting devices to host engineered superconducting states and pave the way for new approaches to topological band structure design based on phase-controlled, higher-order superconducting transport.

- **TL;DR**: 提出一种基于局部衍射图相似度的聚类框架，用于从4D-STEM数据中识别晶体学不同区域，实现空间相干分割、数据压缩和定量结构-应变映射。

Four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) enables mapping of diffraction information with nanometer-scale spatial resolution, offering detailed insight into local structure, orientation, and strain. However, as data dimensionality and sampling density increase, particularly for in situ scanning diffraction experiments (5D-STEM), robust segmentation of spatially coherent regions becomes essential for efficient and physically meaningful analysis. Here, we introduce a clustering framework that identifies crystallographically distinct domains from 4D-STEM datasets. By using local diffraction-pattern similarity as a metric, the method extracts closed contours delineating regions of coherent structural behavior. This approach produces cluster-averaged diffraction patterns that improve signal-to-noise and reduce data volume by orders of magnitude, enabling rapid and accurate orientation, phase, and strain mapping. We demonstrate the applicability of this approach to in situ liquid-cell 4D-STEM data of gold nanoparticle growth. Our method provides a scalable and generalizable route for spatially coherent segmentation, data compression, and quantitative structure-strain mapping across diverse 4D-STEM modalities. The full analysis code and example workflows are publicly available to support reproducibility and reuse.

- **TL;DR**: 薄膜在弱相互作用基底上的生长呈现独特的粗糙-平滑生长模式：初期形成强岛状结构，粗糙度迅速增加达到峰值，随后下降并恢复平滑形态。

Thin film deposition on weakly interacting substrates exhibits a unique growth mode characterized by initially strong island formation and rapidly increasing roughness, which reaches a maximum and subsequently decreases as the film returns to a smooth morphology. Here we show this rough-to-smooth growth mode experimentally for two molecular systems with substantially different geometries, namely, the effectively spherical buckminsterfullerene (C$_{60}$) and the disk-like 1,4,5,8,9,11-hexaazatriphenylenehexacarbonitrile (HATCN). This growth mode is explained by a geometrical model that captures the basic mechanisms of multilayer island growth, island coalescence, and formation of a continuous film. Additionally, kinetic Monte Carlo simulations with minimal ingredients demonstrate that this mode generally occurs for weakly interacting substrates, providing quantitative estimates of parameters that characterize adsorbate-adsorbate and adsorbate-substrate interactions. Both the model and simulations accurately describe the experimental data and highlight the generic nature of the phenomenon, independently of the details of the interactions and the molecular flux, which opens up a path for controlling nanoscale film roughness.

We theoretically investigate signatures of exciton condensation and the underlying interband coherence in scanning tunneling microscopy. We consider both monolayer and bilayer condensates in the regime of a dilute condensate of tightly bound excitons. For monolayer condensates, interband coherence is directly encoded in spatially oscillating contributions to the tunneling conductance, which break the underlying lattice symmetry. We show how scanning tunneling microscopy allows one to extract the exciton wavefunction. For bilayer condensates, we show that the formation of the exciton insulator is signaled by the emergence of a characteristic peak in the tunneling conductance, which can be used to extract the (local) exciton density. Our results are based on analytical considerations using a systematic solution of the mean-field equations in powers of the exciton density as well as numerical calculations.

Chirality and topology are fundamental and ubiquitous in nature. Symmetry has proven to be a powerful tool for predicting topological phonons. However, to date, topological phonon emergent particles (EMPs) have not been systematically cataloged in material databases. Moreover, traditional symmetry methods are often inadequate for predicting chiral phonons, because realistic calculations can yield negative results even when symmetry analysis permits phonon chirality. Here, we first establish a complete symmetry-based classification: given any space group and Wyckoff positions (WYPOs) occupied by atoms, the number of occurrences of all (co-)irreducible representations ((co-)irreps) (that can host EMPs) can be unambiguously known without omission prior to expensive and parameter-dependent calculation. Moreover, whether a phonon mode (belonging to one (co-)irrep) is chiral can also be determined from the occupied WYPOs. We then perform a materials database investigation identifying over 25 million EMPs at high-symmetry points and along high-symmetry lines and computing the concrete value of phonon angular momentum for each mode. We demonstrate two main applications: identifying ideal materials with surface chirality momentum locking and identifying materials with giant phonon magnetic moment. All computational data are compiled into a website: http://phonon.nju.edu.cn, which is expected to stimulate future studies on topological and chiral phonons.

Predicting atomic-scale interfacial structures remains a central challenge in materials science due to their structural complexity and the difficulty of direct comparison between computational and experimental results. In this study, we present an efficient approach for interface structure prediction that integrates the Minima Hopping Method (MHM) with the state-of-the-art machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP), Allegro. We demonstrate that the MHM-Allegro approach provides a robust and computationally efficient route for predicting interfacial structures in the benchmark system SrTiO3 Sigma 3 (112)[110] tilt grain boundaries (GBs), consistently identifying the lowest-energy configurations across different stoichiometries. Furthermore, we introduce a strategy for constructing defect-representative training datasets without explicitly including defective configurations, achieving excellent extrapolative performance in interface predictions. The predictive capability is further validated through direct comparison with experimental observations of the SrTiO3 Sigma 5 (310)[001] GB, where the predicted atomic configurations show strong agreement with experimental measurements. This work represents a significant step toward bridging the gap between ab initio predictions and experimentally observed interfacial structures.

The physics of phase transitions in low-dimensional systems has long been a subject of significant research interest. Long-range magnetic order in the strict two-dimensional limit, whose discovery circumvented the Mermin-Wagner theorem, has rapidly emerged as a research focus. However, the demonstration of a non-trivial topological spin textures in two-dimensional limit has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate the out-of-plane electric field breaks inversion symmetry while simultaneously modulating the electronic band structure, enabling electrically tunable spin-orbit interaction for creation and manipulation of topological spin textures in monolayer CrI3. The realization of ideal two-dimensional topological spin textures may offer not only an experimental testbed for probing the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless mechanism, but also potential insights into unresolved quantum phenomena including superconductivity and superfluidity. Moreover, voltage-controlled spin-orbit interaction offers a novel pathway to engineer two-dimensional spin textures with tailored symmetries and topologies, while opening avenues for skyrmion-based next-generation information technologies.

Graphene/AlGaN/GaN heterostructures are proposed to investigate the drag and two-stream instability effects. In this study, graphene grown by chemical vapor deposition was transferred from copper onto the top of the standard AlGaN/GaN wafer, forming a heterostructure with two conducting layers separated by an AlGaN barrier layer. Contacts fabricated to the two-dimensional electron gas and graphene allowed us to study the drag current induced in graphene by passing the drive current through the two-dimensional electron gas. At low temperatures, the graphene drag current exhibited quantum oscillations as a function of the drive voltage. As temperature increases, quantum oscillations disappear, and the magnitude of the drag current increases. Graphene/AlGaN/GaN heterostructures are a promising platform for studying drag and two-stream instability effects, especially if the AlGaN barrier layer thickness can be reduced to a few nanometers.

The effect on the resistive switching (RS) mechanism in organic semiconductor (OSC), Poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT), due to the presence of the perforated bottom electrode (PBE) is investigated. The simulation shows a high local electric field at the edges of a patterned bottom electrode (BE), which can increase the probability of metal filament formation due to high current density, suggesting that the use of a PBE can assist the RS mechanism. RS involves switching from the high resistive state (HRS) to the low resistive state (LRS) known as the "SET" process at higher positive bias, and returning to HRS from LRS is known as the "RESET" process, which can be achieved at a negative bias. Various switching mechanisms are segregated from each other by the obtained current response to applied voltage. RS due to the formation of complete metal filaments between the top and bottom electrodes showed Ohm's law behaviour. On the other hand, a slope of approximately 2 in the log-log plot signifies that the space charge limited current (SCLC) dominates the device, and hence RS comes from incomplete metal filament formation or some changes in the P3HT polymer itself. Similarly, high current density can transform the molecular arrangement from crystalline to an amorphous state due to joule heating, which leads to an intermediate OFF state. The high current density joule heating RS are from HRS to LRS, which is opposite to the metal filament based RS, hence it is called an inverted RS. The optical images of the fresh device and after multiple cycles indicate the metal percolation inside the OSC responsible for the RS. EDX spectrum at LRS in a cross-sectional transmission electron microscope (TEM) confirms the top metal percolation through the OSC and touches the BE. Therefore, the metal filament formation is the fundamental reason for these observed switching behaviours in P3HT.

This study examines electrostatic screening effects in graphene using tight binding calculations under the BBC and modified BBC models, with sigmav ranging from 0.00 to 3.00. Our results demonstrate that the modified BBC potential decays, which effectively suppresses electron-electron interactions. Hopping integrals decrease by 65% over distance and shift 7% with sigmav, while on site energy rises linearly by 0.045 eV. A band gap opens for sigmav greater than or equal to 1.00. The density of states peaks near the Fermi level, with the low energy region largely unaffected. Graphene's low energy helical wave functions yield topological features like pseudospin momentum locking and a pi Berry phase, leading to distinct transport behavior. The model avoids the Coulomb singularity, offering insights for 2D screening engineering and topological device design.

Nanostructured transition metal oxides (TMO) are extensively explored materials for non-enzymatic glucose sensors. TMOs such as Iron oxides( α-Fe2O3, γ-Fe2O3, Fe3O4, etc.), NiO, CuO, Cr2O3, etc. have been utilized as electrocatalysts for glucose determination. Tremendous efforts have been put into identifying the impact of different morphologies of these materials on the glucose-sensing performance. The larger surface area of the flower and wire-shaped catalysts make them better performing amongst other morphologies. Interestingly, it is important to note that most of such studies are on standard Glassy Carbon electrodes. Further to enhance the Electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of the electrode, Carbon nanomaterials such as reduced Graphene Oxide (r-GO) and Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) are used as additives. Exfoliated Graphite paper electrodes offer better electrochemical characteristics than GCE electrodes due to their much larger ECSA. This study presents the non-enzymatic glucose sensing properties of NiO nanoflower-decorated Exfoliated Graphite electrodes. The amperometric detection of glucose shows a linear increase in current over a physiologically relevant wide range of 0-10 mM. The electrodes offer a better sensitivity of 304.12 microA per mM per cm square and a Limit Of Detection (LOD) of 100 microM. In addition, the electrodes showed high selectivity towards glucose in the presence of other interfering species such as Ascorbic acid, Fructose, Sucrose, and NaCl.

We theoretically elucidate the boundary conditions for phonon distribution functions of long-wavelength acoustic phonons at smooth crystal interfaces. We first derive boundary conditions that fully incorporate reflection, transmission, and mode conversion. We obtain these conditions for phonons from those for classical lattice vibrations, using the correspondence between the quantum and classical descriptions. This formulation provides a theoretical foundation for the acoustic mismatch model, widely used to analyze Kapitza resistance. We then refine the boundary conditions to include spatial dependence parallel to the interface. The refined form captures transverse shifts of elastic wave packets, analogous to the optical Imbert--Fedorov shift, and ensures conservation of total angular momentum. Consequently, circularly polarized phonons carrying spin angular momentum (SAM) generate phonon orbital angular momentum (OAM) at the interface. We analytically determine the spatial profile of this OAM and demonstrate that SAM and OAM are both involved in the interfacial diffusion of chiral phonons. Our theory provides concise boundary conditions for phonons, with applications ranging from heat transport to phonon angular momentum transport.

We report a comprehensive investigation of the physical properties of the Dirac semimetal compound EuAuBi single crystals, using neutron diffraction, magnetization, electrical transport, and specific heat measurements. EuAuBi crystallizes in a hexagonal structure with space group P63mc (No. 186). First-principles calculations using density functional theory characterize it as a Dirac semimetal, with a notable band-crossing in proximity to the Fermi level (EF ) along the Γ-A direction. The crystal exhibits three distinct magnetic phases at 4 K (TN1), 3.5 K (TN2), and 2.8 K (TN3)as observed from magnetic and specific heat measurements. However, zero-field neutron diffraction resolves only two magnetic phases: a commensurate antiferromagnetic phase and a canted antiferromagnetic phase. Field-dependent ac and dc magnetization measurements uncover field-induced non-trivial spin textures in the magnetic field range 1.5 to 3 T, manifested as a tilted plateau in the magnetization curves. The interplay between conduction carriers and these spin textures is further evidenced by unique features in the magnetic field-dependent longitudinal resistivity in the system. Finally, we present a comprehensive magnetic phase diagram of EuAuBi, highlighting diverse spin alignments present in the material. EuAuBi thus emerges as a rare material system in which both momentum-space and real-space Berry curvature effects may coexist, providing a unique opportunity to investigate their interplay.

Materials and devices used in space and advanced energy systems are continuously exposed to high-energy photons and particles, leading to gradual changes in their structural and electronic properties. Gamma-ray exposure is particularly critical because their strong penetrating power allows them to traverse conventional shielding and device packaging. Real-time monitoring of exposure-induced changes in compact, chip-integrated devices remains limited despite the availability of external radiation detectors. Atomically precise graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) present an attractive platform for probing such effects due to their structural uniformity, tunable electronic properties, and exceptional sensitivity of charge transport to even subtle lattice modifications. Here, we investigate the structural and electronic response of atomically precise GNRs under gamma irradiation. Nine-atom-wide armchair GNRs (9-AGNRs) were synthesized via a bottom-up on-surface approach, integrated into field-effect transistors (FETs), and characterized before and after exposure using Raman spectroscopy and electrical transport measurements. Raman spectroscopy indicates preservation of the primary GNR lattice structure, accompanied by subtle spectral changes suggestive of irradiation-induced oxidation or local lattice perturbations. While these measurements do not indicate severe structural damage, electrical transport measurements reveal a pronounced degradation in device performance, demonstrating the strong susceptibility of GNRFETs to gamma-ray exposure. This pronounced response may be attributed to Anderson localization of charge carriers, potentially arising from enhanced quantum interference in atomically narrow, quasi-one-dimensional GNRs. These results highlight the potential of GNR-based nanoelectronic devices for sensing and monitoring under extreme operational conditions.

We investigate the environmental stability of topological interface states (IFs) in two sandwich nanostructures, BNNR/AGNRH/BNNR and BNNR/AGNRH/NBNR, where AGNRH denotes an armchair graphene nanoribbon heterostructure and BNNR (NBNR) represents a boron nitride nanoribbon. The former corresponds to a same-topology configuration, whereas the latter realizes a reverse-topology configuration. Using a bulk boundary perturbation approach, we show that in BNNR/AGNRH/BNNR the IFs are destroyed by chirality breaking induced by symmetric BN environments at both interfaces. In contrast, the IFs in the reverse-topology structure remain robust against lateral interface interactions from BN atoms. Transport calculations further demonstrate that the surviving IFs in BNNR/AGNRH/NBNR exhibit the characteristic behavior of topological double quantum dots, with an enhanced interdot hopping strength compared with vacuum boundary conditions. These results reveal that BN environments can either suppress or reinforce topological interface states, depending critically on the topology of the surrounding nanoribbons.

This paper presents a full 3D Method of Moments (MoM) simulation for analysis of scattering from nano-scale chiral ribbon structures under optical vortex illumination to aim to investigate electromagnetic mechanism of circular dichroism (CD) and optical vortex dichroism (VD). Both twist and helical nano-ribbons are modeled as dispersive materials scatterer. CD and VD are evaluated quantitatively by differences in scattering power. Numerical results demonstrate that angular momentum of optical light induces dichroic response effectively.

Aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as normal alkanes, constitute a naturally abundant source of carbon atoms. Of special interest is the formation of cyclic and aromatic products from aliphatic reactants. Combining scanning tunneling microscopy and ab initio calculations, we investigate the thermal induced aromatization of linear n octane molecules on the catalytic Pt(111) surface and the reactions of intermolecular homocoupling between them at temperatures above 600 K. The cycloaromatization of individual n octane molecules requires bending the linear adsorbates prior to their dehydrogenation and the formation of an intramolecular C-C bond, yielding adsorbed benzene rings. In addition, the Pt(111) surface catalyzes a homocoupling reaction by initiating the formation of a C-C bond between the dehydrogenated methyl ends of the chemisorbed n octane molecules and then propagating along the carbon backbone in a zipper like fashion. Our findings provide molecular level insight into the heterogeneous catalytic processes underlying the generation of aromatic products and stable on surface polycyclic species.

One-dimensional kagome strip chains share much of the same frustrated structural motif as two-dimensional kagome antiferromagnets, making them valuable for deepening our understanding of kagome lattice magnetism. In this paper, we report the hydrothermal synthesis and detailed structural and property characterization of Na2Co3(AsO4)2(OH)2, a striped kagome system. The crystal structure was characterized using single crystal X-ray diffraction, which reveals that Na2Co3(AsO4)2(OH)2 crystallizes in the monoclinic crystal system C2/m. The structure features a one-dimensional kagome strip lattice built from Co2+ ions and undergoes an antiferromagnetic transition at TN = 14 K. The magnetic ground state at zero field was characterized using neutron powder diffraction. Below the magnetic transition, Na2Co3(AsO4)2(OH)2 orders into an antiferromagnetic structure with a k-vector (0.5, 0.5, 0.5). In the proposed model, the Co1 moment is predominantly confined to the ac-plane while the Co2 moment is primarily aligned along the b-axis. Two flat bands were observed in the inelastic neutron spectra below the magnetic transition at 5 and 10 meV. Inelastic neutron spectra were modeled with a Heisenberg Hamiltonian including three nearest-neighbor exchange interactions (J1, J2, J3) and strong single-ion anisotropy to stabilize the observed magnetic structure. Our study highlights the complexity of the Co2+-based kagome strip magnetic lattice compound Na2Co3(AsO4)2(OH)2, which provides an excellent platform to broaden our understanding of the frustrated kagome magnetic lattice space.

- **TL;DR**: PERLA是一个自主更新的钙钛矿太阳能电池活数据库，利用大语言模型和物理验证从文献中提取数据，解决了人工标注跟不上发表速度的瓶颈问题。

Scientific discovery is severely bottlenecked by the inability of manual curation to keep pace with exponential publication rates. This creates a widening knowledge gap. This is especially stark in photovoltaics, where the leading database for perovskite solar cells has been stagnant since 2021 despite massive ongoing research output. Here, we resolve this challenge by establishing an autonomous, self-updating living database (PERLA). Our pipeline integrates large language models with physics-aware validation to extract complex device data from the continuous literature stream, achieving human-level precision (&gt;90%) and eliminating annotator variance. By employing this system on the previously inaccessible post-2021 literature, we uncover critical evolutionary trends hidden by data lag: the field has decisively shifted toward inverted architectures employing self-assembled monolayers and formamidinium-rich compositions, driving a clear trajectory of sustained voltage loss reduction. PERLA transforms static publications into dynamic knowledge resources that enable data-driven discovery to operate at the speed of publication.

- **TL;DR**: FIRE框架通过结合高效构型采样和回放增强持续学习策略，实现了量子级精度的机器学习原子间势能，在固态电池界面系统中以10%的数据量获得数量级精度提升。

Atomistic modeling of solid-solid battery interfaces is essential for understanding electro-chemo-mechanical coupling, but the complex interfacial chemistry and heterogeneous environments pose major challenges for quantum-accurate, data-efficient modeling. Herein, we propose an approach of fine-tuning with integrated replay and efficiency (FIRE), a general framework for universal machine-learning interatomic potentials by combining efficient configurational sampling with a replay-argumented continual strategy, achieving quantum-level accuracy at moderate cost. Across six solid-solid battery interface systems, FIRE consistently achieves root-mean-square errors in energy below 1 meV/atom and in force near 20 meV/angstrom, marking an order-of-magnitude improvement over existing models while requiring only 10% of the original datasets. In addition, the fine-tuned model successfully reproduces key mechanical and electrochemical properties of the materials, in close agreement with experimental data. The FIRE offers a generalizable and data-efficient approach for developing accurate interatomic potentials across diverse materials, enabling predictive simulations beyond the reach of first-principles methods.

- **TL;DR**: 利用氧化物薄膜的机械不稳定性实现可调控的非线性纳米机电架构

Mechanical instabilities in thin solids offer a powerful route to engineer nonlinear responses, yet their controlled use in functional crystalline oxides has remained largely unexplored. Notably, by changing the aspect ratio of solids, the energy landscape around equilibrium can be modified to induce non-linearities under lateral stresses through non-lateral deformations. These nonlinear systems can develop multiple local energy minima where the system can settle and switch between states through the application of a driving force. Crucially, recent advances in oxide thin film growth have enabled the fabrication of freestanding oxide membranes, paving a viable path for their use in bistable architecture, particularly at the nanoscale. Here, we demonstrate that freestanding oxide membranes, such as SrTiO3 (STO) and BaTiO3 (BTO), relax into well-defined metastable buckling states when transferred onto lithographically defined cavities. The membrane deformation is determined by the interplay between built-in residual strain, bending stiffness, and cavity geometry, resulting in reproducible bistable states with distinct strain distributions. Using a combination of atomic force microscopy, in-contact Kelvin probe measurements, and finite-element modelling, we reveal that these mechanically locked states directly shape the electromechanical potential landscape of ferroelectric BaTiO3. We further demonstrate reversible snapthrough transitions between mechanically degenerate states, establishing complex oxides as deterministic, geometry-tunable building blocks for nonlinear nanoelectromechanical architectures. Our results illustrate a general strategy for exploiting mechanical instabilities to encode and manipulate functional responses in ultrathin crystalline membranes.

### Crystal Representation in the Reciprocal Space

- **TL;DR**: 提出一种在4D倒易空间表示晶体结构的新方法，使用笛卡尔坐标和散射因子，通过功率谱表示实现旋转不变性，解决了传统晶体表示缺乏一一对应的问题。

In crystallography, a structure is typically represented by the arrangement of atoms in the direct space. Furthermore, space group symmetry and Wyckoff site notations are applied to characterize crystal structures with only a few variables. While this representation is effective for data records and human learning, it lacks one-to-one correspondence between the crystal structure and its representation. This is problematic for many applications, such as crystal structure determination, comparison, and more recently, generative model learning. To address this issue, we propose to represent crystals in a four-dimensional (4D) reciprocal space featured by their Cartesian coordinates and scattering factors, which can naturally handle translation invariance and space group symmetry with the help of structure factors. In order to achieve rotational invariance, the 4D coordinates are then transformed into a power spectrum representation under the orthogonal spherical harmonic and radial basis. Hence, this representation captures both periodicity and symmetry of the crystal structure while also providing a continuous representation of the atomic positions and cell parameters in the direct space. Its effectiveness is demonstrated by applying it to several crystal structure matching and reconstruction tasks.

Amorphous grain boundary complexions have been shown to increase the plasticity of nanocrystalline alloys as compared to ordered grain boundaries. Here, the effect of an important structural descriptor, amorphous complexion thickness, on the plasticity and failure modes of nanocrystalline Cu-Zr is studied with in-situ compression testing, with over 50 micropillars tested. Two model materials were created that differ only in their complexion thickness, with one having a thicker complexion population than the other. The sample with thinner complexions was more likely to experience non-uniform plastic deformation in the form of localized plastic flow or shear banding. In contrast, the sample with thicker complexions displayed more homogeneous plasticity and higher damage tolerance; thicker amorphous complexions suppress localization by absorbing defects. This work demonstrates that increasing complexion thickness can be beneficial for stable plastic flow in nanocrystalline alloys, by improving resistance to strain localization and premature failure.

- **TL;DR**: 在TaCo2Te2中发现了一种非常规的Lifshitz相变，该相变仅在有限的温度窗口内出现，需要温度和磁场的协同调控，且不伴随结构或磁相变。

Magnetic-field-driven Lifshitz transitions are typically considered zero-temperature phenomena involving Fermi-surface reconstruction without symmetry breaking. Here, we report an unconventional Lifshitz transition in TaCo2Te2 that emerges exclusively within a narrow finite-temperature window under cooperative tuning by both temperature and magnetic field. Bulk-sensitive transport and thermoelectric measurements demonstrate continuous Fermi-surface renormalization at low temperatures, where the transition is sharply triggered by a critical magnetic field. Crucially, neutron diffraction reveals the absence of structural or magnetic phase transitions, while angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy shows no spectral anomalies in electronic structure without magnetic field. These observations constrain the mechanism to a Zeeman-driven process invisible to equilibrium probes, establishing a paradigm where Fermi-surface topology is jointly controlled by temperature and magnetic field.

We used density functional theories (DFT) to investigate the properties of Au2O and Au2O3-x (x = 00.08) to reveal their remarkable functionalities. Hybrid functional theories accurately estimate the band gap (Eg) of oxides, and the present hybrid functional calculations determined Eg values of 0.96 eV for Au2O and 2.86 eV for Au2O3, which is &gt;300% of the commonly accepted Eg of Au2O3 (0.85 eV). Moreover, we discovered spontaneous polarization (PS) in Au2O3, which is unusually large and advantageous for catalysis. The PS was retained even in 2-nm-thick Au2O3 nanosheets, similar to hyperferroelectric, generating a potential of 0.6 eV despite screening caused by surface reconstruction, which is a novel screening mechanism. Below a thickness of 0.8 nm, the PS vanished, and inversion symmetry emerged at 0.4 nm, suggesting a new approach to finding a paraelectric phase. Au2O was supersoft under shear distortion.

Spontaneous polarizations (PSs) of BaTiO3 and SrTiO3 under various conditions are calculated ab initio using different exchange-correlation functionals. The extensive theoretical sets of PS vs. ion positions are found to lie on a single curve, despite the chemical differences and the wide variations of PS and lattice parameters. This uncovers accurate simple analytical formulas of PS of SrTiO3-BaTiO3 system expressed by ion positions; a single formula predicts both macroscopic and atomic-scale PS of SrTiO3, BaTiO3 and SrTiO3-BaTiO alloys. The accuracy of the formula is demonstrated by the application to experiments, BaTiO3-SrTiO3 (-CaTiO3) alloys, Sr4Ti4O12 with PS // a-axis, a parallel domain, and a headon domain. In addition, the present results verify empirically that oxygen displacement is the primary identifier and the origin of PS of SrTiO3 and BaTiO3 and indicate that BaTiO3 and SrTiO3 may transforms into new state by an extremely large strain, e.g., -3%. Furthermore, the earlier prediction of headon domain without aid of defects was confirmed. The present procedures for finding formulas can be applied to other materials.

Crystallographic orientation analysis revealed that DyNi2 grew epitaxially on Ni, whereas NdNi2 does not. To elucidate the microscopic origin of this contrasting behavior, we constructed atomistic models of Ni/Rare-earth (RE)Ni2 interfaces with well-defined crystallographic alignment and performed first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT).
  The computed interfacial energies exhibit a clear correlation with lattice mismatch: larger mismatch leads to higher interfacial energy and reduced interface stability. Consequently, Ni/DyNi2 exhibits a significantly lower interfacial energy than Ni/NdNi2, consistent with experimental observations.
  A comparison between interfacial and strain energies for Ni/RENi2 (RE = Sc, Y, Nd, Gd, Dy, and Lu) reveals that the elemental dependence of interfacial stability is dominated by elastic strain rather than chemical bonding. Based on this insight, we developed a simple regression model using the absolute lattice mismatch as a descriptor, enabling qualitative predictions of stability for Ni/RENi2 interfaces with RE other than those examined in DFT.

A modification of classical nucleation theory is carried out as applied to solid solutions under irradiation, taking into account the influence of ballistic re-solution on the nucleation kinetics of pure unary (single-component) and stoichiometric binary precipitates. The effects of excessive point defects formed under steady irradiation conditions and operating alongside the ballistic re-solution mechanism are incorporated into the new model for a consistent description of the nucleation of incoherent and coherent particles. The developed model was applied to interpret the results of Nelson, Hudson and Mazey (NHM) tests, in which the stability of gamma' phase (Ni3Al) precipitates in diluted Ni-Al alloys under irradiation was studied.

On the base of a critical analysis of existing models for nucleation of new phase precipitates in metastable binary alloys, a new kinetic model of homogeneous nucleation and growth of alpha'-phase precipitates in Fe-Cr alloys was developed within the framework of the Reiss kinetic theory of binary nucleation. The model was further modified to account for the influence of ballistic re-solution on the kinetics of nucleation and growth of alpha' precipitates, following the general approach proposed in Part 1. The model was used for qualitative interpretation of the results of recent tests, in which the stability of alpha' precipitates in Fe-15Cr alloys under irradiation was studied.

Kagome materials are at the frontier of condensed matter physics. An ideal kagome lattice features only one geometrically frustrated flat band spanning the entire momentum space and a single Dirac cone at the Brillouin-zone corners. However, for the first time, here we observe unusual flat-band and Dirac physics in the newly discovered "322" kagome material Ni3In2S2 by combining high-resolution synchrotron- and laser-based angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with a micro-focused beam, scanning tunneling microscopy, and first-principles calculations. We resolve two distinct electronic flat-band states located in close proximity to the Fermi level: a robust Topological Surface Flat Band at ~40 meV below the Fermi level on the Sulfur-terminated surface, originating from weak topological insulator states, and a kagome lattice-derived flat band at ~100 meV binding energy with an ultranarrow bandwidth (~5 meV). Instead of the single Dirac cone, the Indium-terminated surface hosts a rare two-dimensional Dirac-node arc state, where the gapless Dirac nodes extend along an open one-dimensional line crossing the Brillouin-zone boundary, exhibiting sharp linear dispersion, exceptionally high Fermi velocity, and pronounced circular dichroism. These findings establish Ni3In2S2 as a unique topological kagome metal in which multiple flat-band states of different physical origin coexist with an unusual Dirac-node arc, opening an avenue for discovering flat-band--driven and topology-enabled quantum phenomena.

$α$-RuCl$_3$ is a candidate Kitaev material that exhibits zigzag antiferromagnetic ordering below 7 K. One contentious issue regarding this material is its bulk structure in the low-temperature phase. Recently, it has become generally accepted from experiments that the low- and high-temperature structures belong to the $R\bar{3}$ and $C2/m$ space groups, respectively. However, there was no theoretical study supporting the $R\bar{3}$-type structure as the low-temperature structure. In this study, we use constrained density functional theory to show that the $R\bar{3}$ structure is lower in energy than the $C2/m$ structure, in agreement with experimental observations. Then, we show that the conduction band minimum states are almost of the $J_\textrm{eff}=1/2$ and $m_\textrm{eff}=-1/2$ character, if we set the angular momentum quantization axis to be parallel to the Néel vector; this is the first analysis of the $J_\textrm{eff}$ picture for $α$-RuCl$_3$ from this perspective. In addition, we compute the anisotropic magnetic exchange parameters and $g$ factors of monolayer $α$-RuCl$_3$, thereby providing a comprehensive understanding of its magnetism. Our results demonstrate that both second-nearest-neighbor exchange interactions and magnetic moments not captured by the conventional atomic orbital projection method are necessary for accurate description of the magnetism in $α$-RuCl$_3$. Moreover, the calculated $g$ factors are in fairly good agreement with experimental measurements, especially the small anisotropy between their in-plane and out-of-plane components. Finally, we examine the effects of structural distortions from a perfect RuCl$_6$ octahedron, already present in bulk $α$-RuCl$_3$ without any external perturbation, on the magnetic properties.
