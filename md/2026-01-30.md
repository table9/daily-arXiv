- **TL;DR**: 在(1+1)D XXZ自旋链的无能隙相中发现了一种振幅(Higgs-like)模式，该模式出现在对称性保持的Luttinger液体基态上，而非传统自发对称性破缺背景。

We investigate the emergence of an amplitude (Higgs-like) mode in the gapless phase of the $(1+1)$D XXZ spin chain. Unlike conventional settings where amplitude modes arise from spontaneous symmetry breaking, here, we identify a symmetry-preserving underdamped excitation on top of a Luttinger-liquid ground state. Using nonequilibrium quench spectroscopy, we demonstrate that this mode manifests as oscillations of U(1)-symmetric observables following a sudden quench. By combining numerical simulations with Bethe-ansatz analyses, we trace its microscopic origin to specific families of string excitations. We further discuss experimental pathways to detect this mode in easy-plane quantum magnets and programmable quantum simulators. Our results showcase the utility of quantum quenches as a powerful tool to probe collective excitations, beyond the scope of linear response.

- **TL;DR**: 研究张量积希尔伯特空间上的晶格高阶形式对称性，发现非紧致对称性（如ℝ、ℤ）在低能下保持非拓扑性，而紧致对称性（如ℤₙ、U(1))通常变为拓扑对称性。

We study the lattice version of higher-form symmetries on tensor-product Hilbert spaces. Interestingly, at low energies, these symmetries may not flow to the topological higher-form symmetries familiar from relativistic quantum field theories, but instead to non-topological higher-form symmetries. We present concrete lattice models exhibiting this phenomenon. One particular model is an $\mathbb{R}$ generalization of the Kitaev honeycomb model featuring an $\mathbb{R}$ lattice 1-form symmetry. We show that its low-energy effective field theory is a gapless, non-relativistic theory with a non-topological $\mathbb{R}$ 1-form symmetry. In both the lattice model and the effective field theory, we demonstrate that the non-topological $\mathbb{R}$ 1-form symmetry is not robust against local perturbations. In contrast, we also study various modifications of the toric code and their low-energy effective field theories to demonstrate that the compact $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice 1-form symmetry does become topological at low energies unless the Hamiltonian is fine-tuned. Along the way, we clarify the rules for constructing low-energy effective field theories in the presence of multiple superselection sectors. Finally, we argue on general grounds that non-compact higher-form symmetries (such as $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{Z}$ 1-form symmetries) in lattice systems generically remain non-topological at low energies, whereas compact higher-form symmetries (such as $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ and $U(1)$ 1-form symmetries) generically become topological.

- **TL;DR**: 研究发现某些晶格结构（如kagome和Lieb晶格）能支持对无序具有异常强鲁棒性的非常规超导性，尽管其序参数具有符号变化特性。

Unconventional superconductivity is a desirable state of matter due to its potential for high transition temperatures $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ and associated favorable superconducting properties. However, the sign-changing nature of the order parameter of unconventional superconductors renders their condensates fragile to disorder, an inevitability in real materials. We uncover the generic properties of electronic band structures and associated Bloch weights able to support robust unconventional superconductivity. We demonstrate this property in several case studies of the kagome and Lieb lattices, showing how unconventional superconductors exhibit unusually weak $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ suppression by disorder, despite featuring fully compensated sign-changing order parameters. We contrast these results with those for unconventional superconductivity on the square and honeycomb lattices, which are unable to protect the condensates from disorder. Finally, we discuss material candidates for which this effect may be realized.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究揭示了爱因斯坦-德哈斯效应中自旋角动量在声子和刚体旋转之间的不对称分配：刚体旋转获得主要角动量，而声子吸收大部分动能。

We investigate spin angular momentum transfer in the Einstein-de Haas effect within prototypical magnetic crystals, focusing on its partition between phonons and rigid-body rotation. Using the Eckart frame to decouple local vibrations (phonons) from rigid-body rotation, we demonstrate that spin angular momentum is simultaneously transferred into both phonons and rigid-body rotation in an asymmetric way: rigid-body rotation acquires the dominant share of angular momentum, while phonons absorb most of the resulting kinetic energy. This divergent transfer of angular momentum and energy identifies phonons as direct and indispensable participants in the Einstein-de Haas dynamics. Furthermore, we find that pseudo-dipolar anisotropy and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction exert distinct control over the angular momentum transfer. Stronger pseudo-dipolar anisotropy increases the total amount of transferred angular momentum, whereas stronger Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction accelerates the transfer rate and increases the proportion of phonon angular momentum. Our work clarifies the microscopic picture of the Einstein-de Haas effect and enables targeted angular-momentum control in magneto-mechanical devices.

### Self-dual Higgs transitions: Toric code and beyond

- **TL;DR**: 提出SO(4)_{2,-2} Chern-Simons-Higgs理论作为拓扑码相变到平凡态的场论描述，并推广到SO(4)_{k,-k}系列理论

The toric code, when deformed in a way that preserves the self-duality $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry exchanging the electric and magnetic excitations, admits a transition to a topologically trivial state that spontaneously breaks the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. Numerically, this transition was found to be continuous, which makes it particularly enigmatic given the longstanding absence of a continuum field-theoretic description. In this work we propose such a continuum field theory for the transition dubbed the $SO(4)_{2,-2}$ Chern-Simons-Higgs (CSH) theory. We show that our field theory provides a natural "mean-field" understanding of the phase diagram. Moreover, it can be generalized to an entire series of theories, namely the $SO(4)_{k,-k}$ CSH theories, labeled by an integer $k$. For each $k&gt;2$, the theory describes an analogous transition involving different non-Abelian topological orders, such as the double Fibonacci order ($k=3$) and the $S_3$ quantum double ($k=4$). For $k=1$, we conjecture that the corresponding CSH transition is in fact infrared-dual to the $3d$ Ising transition, in close analogy with the particle-vortex duality of a complex scalar.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究首次系统计算了7300多种电子-声子配对超导体的临界磁场参数，发现大量Type-I超导体，并建立了结合DFT、Eliashberg理论和强耦合修正的理论框架，为AI驱动的超导体逆向设计提供基础。

Superconducting materials are of significant technological relevance for a broad range of applications, and intense research efforts aim at enhancing the critical temperature $T_{c}$. Intriguingly, while numerous studies have explored different computational and machine-learning routes to predict $T_{c}$, the fundamental role of the critical magnetic field has so far been overlooked. Here we open a new frontier in superconductor discovery by presenting a consistent computational database of critical fields $H_{c}$, $H_{c1}$, and $H_{c2}$ for over 7300 electron-phonon-paired superconductors covering distinct materials classes. A theoretical framework is developed that combines $α^2F(ω)$ spectral functions and highly accurate Fermi surfaces from density functional theory with clean-limit Eliashberg theory to obtain the coherence lengths, London penetration depths, and Ginzburg-Landau parameters. We discover an unexpectedly large number of Type-I superconductors and show that larger unit cells generically support higher critical fields and Type-II behavior. We identify the importance of going beyond BCS theory by including strong-coupling corrections to the superconducting gap and electron-phonon renormalizations of the effective mass for predictions of critical fields across materials. These results provide a framework for foundational AI models that realize the concept of inverse materials design for high-$T_{c}$ and high-critical-field superconductors.

We show that certain three-dimensional topological phases can act as acoustic diodes realizing nonlinear odd acoustoelastic effects. Beyond uncovering topologically-induced anomalous acoustic second-harmonic generation and rectification, we demonstrate how such nonlinear responses are uniquely captured by the momentum-space nonmetricity tensor in the quantum state Hilbert-space geometry. In addition to completing the classification of quantum geometric observables in the quadratic response regime, our findings reveal unexplored avenues for experimental realizations of acoustic diodes using effective $θ$ vacua of axion insulators adaptable for topological engineering applications.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种基于双弛豫时间近似的玻尔兹曼输运方程的半隐式Lax-Wendroff动力学格式，用于模拟固体材料中的声子输运，能够处理多尺度热传导现象。

A semi-implicit Lax-Wendroff kinetic scheme is developed for hydrodynamic phonon transport in solid materials based on the Boltzmann transport equation under the double relaxation time approximation, in which both the normal and resistive scattering processes are accounted. The trapezoidal and midpoint rules are adopted for the temporal integration of the scattering and migration terms under the framework of finite volume method, respectively. Instead of direct numerical interpolation, the kinetic equation is solved again when reconstructing the interfacial flux, in order to realize the coupling of phonon migration and scattering within a numerical time step. Specifically, the finite difference scheme is introduced and the second-order upwind or central schemes are used for the reconstruction of the interfacial distribution function and its spatial gradient. Consequently, the cell size and time step of the present method could be larger than the phonon mean free path and relaxation time in the limit of small Knudsen numbers. Numerical tests demonstrate that the present method can accurately capture multi-scale thermal conduction phenomena within different normal or resistive scattering rates.

- **TL;DR**: StochasticGW-GPU：基于GPU加速的随机GW代码，用于高效计算大体系准粒子能量，可处理数万电子体系

$\mathtt{StochasticGW}$ is a code for computing accurate Quasi-Particle (QP) energies of molecules and material systems in the GW approximation. $\mathtt{StochasticGW}$ utilizes the stochastic Resolution of the Identity (sROI) technique to enable a massively-parallel implementation with computational costs that scale semi-linearly with system size, allowing the method to access systems with tens of thousands of electrons. We introduce a new implementation, $\mathtt{StochasticGW-GPU}$, for which the main bottleneck steps have been ported to GPUs and which gives substantial performance improvements over previous versions of the code. We showcase the new code by computing band gaps of hydrogenated silicon clusters ($\textrm{S}\textrm{i}_{\textrm{x}}\textrm{H}_{\textrm{y}}$) containing up to 10001 atoms and 35144 electrons, and we obtain individual QP energies with a statistical precision of better than $\pm0.03$ eV with times-to-solution on the order of minutes.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文开发了一种用于随机相互作用Majorana费米子链中信息扰动的有效连续描述，基于对描述纠缠纯度和OTOC等"双副本"可观测量有效自旋链的路径积分的半经典处理。

We develop an effective continuum description for information scrambling in a chain of randomly interacting Majorana fermions. The approach is based on the semiclassical treatment of the path integral for an effective spin chain that describes "two-replica" observables such as the entanglement purity and the OTOC. This formalism gives exact results for the entanglement membrane and for operator spreading in the limit of weak interactions. In this limit there is a large crossover lengthscale between free and interacting behavior, and this large lengthscale allows for a continuum limit and a controlled saddle-point calculation. The formalism is also somewhat different from that known from random unitary circuits. The entanglement membrane emerges as a kind of bound state of two travelling waves, and shows an interesting unbinding phenomenon as the velocity of the entanglement membrane approaches the butterfly velocity.

- **TL;DR**: PMN-PT材料在MPB附近的场致铁电相变动力学行为与远离MPB的成分不同，电场历史对相变温度、延迟时间和极化强度有显著影响，材料能保留电场历史并加速铁电有序化。

The dynamical behavior of field-induced ferroelectric phase transitions in compositions of PbMg_{1/3}Nb_{2/3}O3(1-x)-PbTiO3(x), called PMN-PT, near the Morphotropic Phase Boundary (MPB) was investigated through several different external electrical field application protocols. Our results indicate that the phase transitions in PMN-PT compositions near the MPB behave differently than in compositions far below the MPB. We show that the electrical-field history has a notable impact on the field-induced transition temperature T_c, ZFC delay time tau_{ZFC}, and induced polarization P_c, gained/lost during field-induced phase transition. Moreover, we demonstrate that under certain field-temperature conditions PMN-PT can retain its electrical field history and use it to kinetically accelerate its ferroelectric ordering. An explanation for the key difference between the phase transition dynamics in compositions near and far from the MPB is proposed and contextualized within prior publications.

- **TL;DR**: 在1T-MoTe₂中通过高压实验研究超导性质，发现低压力区域符合BCS机制，但高压力区域存在超出常规BCS的配对贡献，且在2.17GPa下观察到非常规超导特征。

We performed the Te-nuclear magnetic resonance, the Mo-nuclear quadrupole resonance, and the AC susceptibility in the Weyl semimetal superconductor 1T-MoTe$_2$ at pressures up to 2.17~GPa. From the temperature and pressure dependence of the AC susceptibility, the superconducting transition temperature $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ and the upper critical field $H_{\mathrm{c2}}$ were estimated. The results deviate from the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg model but are well described by $H_{\mathrm{c2}}(T)=H_{\mathrm{c2}}(0)[1-T/T_{\mathrm{c}}]^α$. The latter fit yields $H_{\mathrm{c2}}(0)=1.50$~T, $T_{\mathrm{c}}=3.81$K, and $α=1.1$ at 2.17GPa, suggesting that the superconductivity lies in a strong-coupling regime. Since the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate divided by temperature, $1/T_1T$, follows the Korringa relation at ambient pressure, the increase in $1/T_1T$ with pressure up to approximately 0.7~GPa indicates an increase in the density of states (DOS), $N(E_\mathrm F)$. This trend mirrors the pressure dependence of $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ in the low-pressure region, consistent with the BCS mechanism. Above 0.7~GPa, however, $N(E_\mathrm F)$ slightly decreases while $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ continues to rise, suggesting an additional pairing contribution beyond the conventional BCS picture. In the 1T$^{\prime}$ phase at 2.17~GPa, the absence of a coherence peak in $1/T_1T$ around $T_{\mathrm c}$, accompanied by a two-step decrease just below $T_{\mathrm c}$, was observed, which may be a signature of unconventional superconductivity.

- **TL;DR**: 在非均匀铁磁体中，交换作用或各向异性的梯度不仅对畴壁施加净力，还会改变其有效质量，产生类似火箭效应的加速机制，为超快畴壁推进提供了新途径。

Domain wall motion underpins emerging spintronic technologies, such as high-speed racetrack devices and THz logic. Spatially non-uniform magnetic exchange and anisotropy in ferromagnets can pin or accelerate domain walls. In ferrimagnets, where Walker breakdown is suppressed, walls can approach the magnon speed. Here, we show that in non-uniform ferrimagnets such gradients not only exert a net force on the wall, but also modify its effective mass, enabling an entirely new acceleration mechanism. As a wall traverses regions of varying exchange or anisotropy, it can shed or gain mass leading to a "rocket effect" as in variable-mass systems. This phenomenon becomes increasingly pronounced as the wall approaches the magnon velocity, providing a natural route to ultrafast domain wall propulsion. The findings establish variable-mass domain walls as a new paradigm for efficient, high-velocity spintronics and THz-frequency magnetic technologies.

### Acquiring Human-Like Mechanics Intuition from Scarce Observations via Deep Reinforcement Learning

- **TL;DR**: 提出一个强化学习框架，通过跨相似观察的片段切换训练，仅需2-3个观察就能获得准确的力学直觉，并能泛化到远超训练数据的参数范围。

Humans can infer accurate mechanical outcomes from only a few observations, a capability known as mechanics intuition. The mechanisms behind such data-efficient learning remain unclear. Here, we propose a reinforcement learning framework in which an agent encodes continuous physical observation parameters into its state and is trained via episodic switching across closely related observations. With merely two or three observations, the agent acquires robust mechanics intuition that generalizes accurately over wide parameter ranges, substantially beyond the training data, as demonstrated on the brachistochrone and a large-deformation elastic plate. We explain this generalization through a unified theoretical view: it emerges when the learned value function enforces Bellman consistency across neighboring task parameters, rendering the Bellman residual stationary with respect to physical variations. This induces a smooth policy that captures a low-dimensional solution manifold underlying the continuum of tasks. Our work establishes episodic switching as a principled route to artificial mechanics intuition and offers a theoretical link to similar generalization abilities in biological learners.

### Better without U: Impact of Selective Hubbard U Correction on Foundational MLIPs

- **TL;DR**: fMLIPs训练数据中Hubbard U校正的不一致使用导致势能面不兼容，造成金属-氧/氟体系系统性欠结合甚至虚假排斥，提出简单原子位移校正方案

The training of foundational machine learning interatomic potentials (fMLIPs) relies on diverse databases with energies and forces calculated using ab initio methods. We show that fMLIPs trained on large datasets such as MPtrj, Alexandria, and OMat24 encode inconsistencies from the Materials Project's selective use of the Hubbard U correction, which is applied to certain transition metals only if O or F atoms are present in the simulation cell. This inconsistent use of +U creates two incompatible potential-energy surfaces (PES): a lower-energy GGA surface and a higher-energy GGA+U one. When trained on both, MLIPs interpolate between them, leading to systematic underbinding, or even spurious repulsion, between U-corrected metals and oxygen- or fluorine-containing species. Models such as MACE-OMAT and -MPA exhibit repulsion between U-corrected metals and their oxides, limiting their value for studying catalysis and oxidation. We link the severity of this pathology to the oxygen number density in U-corrected training configurations. This explains why OMAT-trained models are most affected and suggests the issue might worsen as expanding future datasets increasingly include configurations with low oxygen content, such as those generated through combinatorial exploration of multi-element or defect-containing systems.
  Our simple per-U-corrected-atom shift aligns PBE+U and PBE energies for identical structures, yielding a smoother PES compared to existing correction schemes, which target phase diagram accuracy. As a result, models trained on datasets with our shift applied exhibit smaller mean absolute errors for the adsorption energies of oxygen on U-corrected elemental slabs. Since datasets omitting +U entirely (e.g. MatPES, MP-ALOE) avoid these pathologies, we recommend excluding +U in future fMLIP datasets. For existing datasets, our post-hoc correction provides a low-cost improvement.

Rigidity percolation provides an important basis for understanding the onset of mechanical stability in disordered materials. While most studies on the triangular lattice have focused on static properties at fixed bond~(site) occupation probabilities, the dynamics of the rigidity transition remain less explored. In this work, we formulate a dynamic pebble game algorithm that monitors how rigid clusters emerge and evolve as bonds are added sequentially to an empty lattice, with computational efficiency comparable to the standard static pebble game. We uncover a previously overlooked temporal self-similarity exhibited in multiple quantities, including the cluster size changes and merged cluster sizes during bond addition, as well as the number of simultaneously merging clusters. We identify large-scale cascade events in which a single bond addition triggers the merger of an extensive number of clusters that scales with system size with inverse correlation-length exponent. Using an event-based ensemble approach, we obtain high-precision estimates of the critical point $p_c = 0.660\,277\,8(10)$, the inverse correlation-length exponent $1/ν= 0.850(3)$, and the fractal dimension $d_f = 1.850(2)$, representing substantial improvements over existing values.

- **TL;DR**: 研究人员开发了一个结合物理原理、扩散生成和分层筛选的加速材料发现框架，用于探索富电子化合物，发现了264个新的富电子化合物，其中13个是热力学稳定的电子化物。

Electrides are exotic compounds in which excess electrons occupy interstitial regions of the crystal lattice and serve as anions, exhibiting exceptional properties such as low work function, high electron mobility, and strong catalytic activity. Although they show promise for diverse applications, identifying new electrides remains challenging due to the difficulty of achieving energetically favorable electron localization in crystal cavities. Here, we present an accelerated materials discovery framework that combines physical principles, diffusion-based materials generation with hierarchical thermodynamic and electronic structure screening. Using this workflow, we systematically explored 1,510 binary and 6,654 ternary chemical compositions containing excess valence electrons from electropositive alkaline, alkaline-earth, and early transition metals, and then filtered them with a high throughput validation on both thermodynamical stability and electronic structure analysis. As a result, we have identified 264 new electron rich compounds within 0.05 eV/atom above the convex hull at the density functional theory (DFT) level, including 13 thermodynamically stable electrides. Our approach demonstrates a generalizable strategy for targeted materials discovery in a vast chemical space.

- **TL;DR**: 研究高熵合金超导体(TaNb)0.7(HfZrTi)0.5在不同退火条件下的磁通动力学，发现中间温度退火增强钉扎效应，高温退火导致两相共存现象。

We investigate flux dynamics in the high-entropy alloy superconductor (TaNb)0.7(HfZrTi)0.5 after annealing (as-cast, 500 °C, 550 °C, and 1000 °C) using a sensitive ac composite magnetoelectric method that measures the complex ac magnetostrictive coefficient (dλ/dH)ac. The resulting vortex phase diagrams show that intermediate annealing (500-550 °C) induces nanoscale clustering, enhances pinning, and produces a pronounced fishtail effect with successive elastic- and plastic-vortex-glass regimes. Flux-jump instabilities appear at 550 °C and persist at 1000 °C, indicating strong pinning and thermomagnetic instability in the low-temperature, low-field regime. Remarkably, the 1000 °C sample exhibits a two-step superconducting response-a double plateau or drop in dλ'/dH and two dissipation peaks in dλ''/dH-demonstrating the coexistence of two superconducting phases with distinct irreversibility and critical-field value. We further show that the resolvability of the two-step (dλ/dH)ac signature is governed by the topological connectivity of the phase-separated microstructure, which controls magnetic shielding between the TaNb-rich network and the (TaNb)0.7(HfZrTi)0.5 parent phase. These results establish a direct microstructure-vortex-state correlation and provide a route to tailoring flux pinning in chemically complex superconductors via thermal processing.

The sp${}^3$ dangling bond on the diamond surface plays a critical role in the performance and fabrication of diamond quantum technologies. For the former, the magnetic and electric properties of this defect can impede the performance of quantum sensors and computers. For the latter, the chemical properties of the dangling bond are integral to proposed methods for bottom-up fabrication of scalable diamond quantum devices. In pursuit of high performance and scalable diamond quantum technology, tunneling probe-based techniques offers the ability to create and modify the sp${}^3$ dangling bond with atomic-scale precision. However, these capabilities cannot be realised either deterministically or at scale without a means for identifying the sp${}^3$ dangling bond amidst the myriad of other defects on the diamond surface. Consequently, in this work we provide a comprehensive experimental and theoretical framework for STS-based characterisation of the sp${}^3$ defect on the H-terminated (100) diamond surface. This capability provides the foundation for future tunneling probe studies in the modification of dangling bonds.

Ising machines, which are dynamical systems designed to operate in a parallel and iterative manner, have emerged as a new paradigm for solving combinatorial optimization problems. Despite computational advantages, the quality of solutions depends heavily on the form of dynamics and tuning of parameters, which are in general set heuristically due to the lack of systematic insights. Here, we focus on optimal Ising machine design by analyzing phase diagrams of spin distributions in the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model. We find that that the ground state can be achieved in the phase where the spin distribution becomes binary, and optimal solutions are produced where the binary phase and gapless phase coexist. Our analysis shows that such coexistence phase region can be expanded by carefully placing a digitization operation, giving rise to a family of superior Ising machines, as illustrated by the proposed algorithm digCIM.

Simulating water from first principles remains a significant computational challenge due to the slow dynamics of the underlying system. Although machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLPs) can accelerate these simulations, they often fail to achieve the required level of accuracy for reliable uncertainty quantification. In this study, we use MACE - an equivariant graph neural network architecture that has been trained using an extensive RPBE-D3 database - to predict density isobars, diffusion constants, radial distribution functions, and melting points. Although equivariant MACE models are computationally more expensive than simpler architectures, such as kernel-based potentials (KbPs), their significantly lower total energy errors allow for reliable thermodynamic reweighting with minimal bias. Our results are consistent with those of previous studies using KbPs; however, equivariant models can be validated against the ground-truth density functional theory (DFT) ensemble, providing a critical advantage. These findings establish equivariant MLPs as robust and reliable tools for investigating the thermophysical properties of water with DFT-level accuracy.

We analyze the finite-size corrections to the crosscap overlap in the two-dimensional classical Ising model along its self-dual critical line. Using a fermionic formulation, we express the lattice crosscap overlap in terms of Bogoliubov angles and develop a contour-integral approach by analytically continuing the lattice momentum to the complex plane. This leads to a remarkably simple expression for the crosscap overlap, which demonstrates that the finite-size corrections decay exponentially with system size. We further derive an exact analytical formula for the corresponding decay constant and show that it is determined by the complex singularity structure of the Bogoliubov angle.

Amorphous solids exhibit structural short-range order despite lacking long-range crystalline order, with this structural descriptor found to be important for determining mechanical properties. Nanobeam electron diffraction offers a potential route for experimental characterization of structural short-range order, yet efforts to date have been primarily qualitative in nature. In this work, machine learning approaches based on transfer learning are used to enable quantitative analysis of nanobeam electron diffraction data from amorphous solids. A ResNet-18 model is trained on virtual diffraction patterns taken from different locations within simulated metallic glasses and amorphous grain boundary complexions in the Cu-Zr alloy system that were created with hybrid molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations. The disorder parameter is found to be a superior target structural descriptor compared to traditional Voronoi indices for this task. The model achieves a low validation mean absolute error across diffraction patterns corresponding to different interaction volumes, demonstrating excellent performance and potential transferability. Testing was performed using other simulated nanobeam electron diffraction data as well as experimental nanobeam electron diffraction patterns, showing that the model can reliably capture spatial variations in local structural state. As a whole, this framework is able to overcome the challenges in the quantitative experimental characterization of structural short-range order, enabling improved characterization of amorphous solids and the exploration of structure-property relationships.

- **TL;DR**: SOC在三角晶格磁体中并不总是破坏超固态，热涨落可以抵消SOC效应，使超固态在有限温度下稳定存在。

Geometrically frustrated triangular-lattice magnets provide fertile ground for realizing intriguing quantum phases such as spin supersolids. A common expectation is that spin-orbit coupling (SOC), which breaks continuous spin rotational symmetry, destabilizes these phases by gapping their low-energy modes. Revisiting this assumption, we map out the SOC-field phase diagram of a frustrated triangular-lattice magnet using spin-wave theory and infinite density-matrix renormalization group (iDMRG) simulations. We find that while infinitesimally weak SOC indeed drives a zero-temperature instability of the supersolid by opening a gap, certain supersolid states remain thermodynamically stable at non-zero temperatures. This reveals a previously unrecognized mechanism in which thermal fluctuations counteract SOC to stabilize supersolidity. The resulting finite-temperature supersolids retain key responses, including a giant magnetocaloric effect, highlighting their potential relevance to real materials. At larger SOC, the system transitions into distinct magnetic orders, including a skyrmion lattice, completing a unified phase diagram.

Twisted graphene provides a tunable platform for studying superconductivity in two dimensions. In the presence of electric currents and magnetic fields, vortices determine the phenomenological properties of the material. Related studies usually address bulk properties averaging over ensembles of vortices. Here, we employ a gate-defined Josephson junction as a single-vortex sensor, enabling direct access to individual vortex dynamical events. Our measurements reveal that, at elevated temperatures (T &gt; 100 mK), vortices enter the superconducting leads via classical thermal activation over energy barriers. At lower temperatures (T &lt; 90 mK), we observe macroscopic quantum tunneling through these barriers. The data are consistent with a sharp, first-order type quantum-to-classical transition. From our measurements, we extract vortex entry and exit energy barriers on the order of a few Kelvin and estimate the barrier thickness to be approximately 100 nm, corresponding to about one tenth of the device width.

One-dimensional (1D) moiré superlattices provide a new route to engineering reduced-dimensional electronic states in van der Waals materials, yet their electronic structure and microscopic origin remain largely unexplored. Here, we investigate the structural relaxation and electronic properties of a 1D moiré superlattice formed in twisted bilayer 1T$'$-WTe$_2$ using density functional theory calculations, complemented by high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy. We show that lattice relaxation strongly reconstructs the moiré stripes, leading to stacking-dependent stripe widths that are in excellent agreement with experimental observations. The relaxed structure hosts quasi-one-dimensional electronic bands near the Fermi level, characterized by strong dispersion along the stripe direction and nearly flat dispersion in the perpendicular direction. By comparing the full bilayer with isolated relaxed layers, we establish that these 1D electronic states are governed predominantly by an intralayer moiré potential induced by in-plane lattice relaxation, rather than by interlayer hybridization. We extract this position-dependent moiré potential directly from DFT calculations and construct an effective tight-binding model that reproduces both the band dispersion and the real-space localization of the electronic wave functions. Our results identify lattice relaxation as the key mechanism underlying 1D electronic states in 1D moiré superlattices. %and establish twisted bilayer WTe$_2$ as a promising platform for exploring emergent one-dimensional moiré physics. The framework developed here provides a unified theoretical basis for realizing and exploring one-dimensional moiré physics in a broad class of anisotropic two-dimensional materials.

Stochastic optimization of Neural Network Quantum States (NQS) in discrete Fock spaces is limited by sampling variance and slow mixing. We present a deterministic framework that optimizes a neural backflow ansatz within dynamically adaptive configuration subspaces, corrected by second-order perturbation theory. This approach eliminates Monte Carlo noise and, through a hybrid CPU-GPU implementation, exhibits sub-linear scaling with respect to subspace size. Benchmarks on bond dissociation in H2O and N2, and the strongly correlated chromium dimer Cr2, validate the method's accuracy and stability in large Hilbert spaces.

We investigate the $λ\ph^4+g\ph^6$ model using the renormalization group method and the $\ep$ expansion. This model is used in a situation where the coefficients $λ$, $g$ and the coefficient $τ$ of the term $τ\ph^2$ depend on two parameters $T$ and $P$, and there is a point ($T_c,P_c$) at which $τ$ and $λ$ are zero. This point is named the tricritical point. The description of a system depends on a trajectory that leads to the tricritical point on the plane ($T,P$). In the trajectories, when $λ$ goes to zero fast enough, the description is defined by the $\ph^6$ interaction and then the $\ph^4$ term can be considered as a composite operator. In this case, the logarithmic dimension is $d=3$, and the $\ep$ expansion is carried out in the dimension $d=3-2\ep$. The main exponents of the \textit{tricritical} model have been calculated in the third order of the $\ep$ expansion. Taking into account the $\ph^4$ interaction, we were able to calculate the value of the parameter that determines the required decrease rate in $λ$ to implement the tricritical behavior. The tricritical dimensions of the composite operators $\ph^k$ for $k=1, 2, 4, 6$ have been computed. The resulting values are compared to those known from a conformal field theory and non-perturbative renormalization group.

In this work, a ferroelectric field-effect transistor (FEFET) is systematically characterized and compared with an equivalent standard MOSFET with an equivalent oxide thickness. We show that these two devices, with a silicon channel, exhibit similar pristine state transfer characteristics but starkly different endurance characteristics. In contrast to the MOSFET, the FEFET shows a significant increase in sub-threshold swing in the first write pulse. Based on this, we reveal that this first write pulse (cycle 1) generates more than half of the total traps generated during the fatigue cycling in FEFETs. We call this the 'First Switch Effect'. Further, by polarizing a pristine FEFET step by step, we demonstrate a direct correlation between the switched polarization and interface trap density during the first switch. Through charge pumping measurements, we also observe that continued cycling generates traps more towards the bulk of the stack, away from the Si/SiO2 interface in FEFETs. We establish that: (1) the first switch effect leads to approximately 50% of the total trap density (Nit) near the Si/SiO2 interface until memory window closure; and (2) further bipolar cycling leads to trap generation both at and away from Si/SiO2 interface in FEFETs.

We have studied the magnetic properties of clinoatacamite Cu$_2$Cl(OH)$_3$, the parent compound of the quantum spin liquid candidate herbertsmithite and a longstanding puzzle among frustrated quantum magnets. As we reveal using density-functional theory, clinoatacamite belongs to the class of distorted kagome antiferromagnets with the kagome plane being embedded into a low-symmetry crystal structure. By means of thermodynamic measurements, muon spin rotation/relaxation as well as neutron diffraction on single crystals, we find a complex sequence of phases/regions below 18.1 K in zero magnetic field. We propose this complexity in multicritical clinoatacamite to arise from the competition of antiferromagnetic ordering modes from the underconstrained manifold of modes, which can lead to a metamagnetic texture in zero magnetic field.

Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) hold relevance for spin-triplet superconducting phases due to their inherent Ising spin-orbit coupling, but the majority of studies have so far focused on oversimplified models. In this work, we consider a TMD monolayer using a three-orbital model with anisotropic couplings and investigate the emergent superconducting properties when it is placed in proximity to a conventional spin-singlet $s$-wave superconductor. We find that the multiorbital nature of the TMDs lead to superconducting gaps not only at zero energy, but also at higher energies, so-called hybridization gaps, which exhibit a complex structure due to the anisotropic couplings, challenging their spectral measurement. Moreover, we find that the inherent Ising spin-orbit coupling induces a spin splitting and a spin polarization along the $z$-direction, which correlates with the emergence of mixed spin-triplet superconducting pairs. These spin-triplet pair correlations appear in the monolayer as a proximity-induced effect due to the impact of the Ising spin-orbit field on conventional spin-singlet $s$-wave superconductivity. Taking realistic parameters for a $\text{MoS}_2$ monolayer, we show that the Ising field is strong enough to induce spin-triplet pair correlations of the same magnitude as their spin-singlet counterparts. We also include Rashba spin-orbit coupling, naturally emerging in a heterostructure and find that it induces equal spin-triplet superconducting pairs that compete with the mixed spin-triplet pairs induced by the Ising spin-orbit coupling. Our findings help understand the superconducting properties of TMDs in proximity to conventional superconductors.

Magnonic frequency combs, characterized by a series of discrete frequency lines, have emerged as a promising frontier in magnon spintronics, with potential applications in advanced information processing and sensing technologies. Although the three-magnon scattering process is widely recognized as a fundamental mechanism for generating these combs, its experimental realization has remained challenging due to the high threshold power and strict conservation of momentum and energy. In this work, we propose a novel mechanism for the stimulated generation of magnonic frequency combs that overcomes these limitations. Our approach offers precise and efficient control over key comb properties, including spacing between spectral lines and the number of lines, marking a significant advancement in the field. We substantiate this mechanism through a robust combination of theoretical modeling, micromagnetic simulations, and experimental validation. This study not only demonstrates the feasibility of our method but also opens new pathways for integrating magnonic frequency combs into practical spintronic devices.

Machine learning (ML) force fields have emerged as a powerful tool for computing materials properties at finite temperatures, particularly in regimes where traditional phonon-based perturbation theories fail or cannot be extended beyond the harmonic approximation. These approaches offer accuracy comparable to ab initio molecular dynamics (MD), but at a fraction of the computational cost. However, their reliability critically depends on the quality and representativeness of the training data. In particular, static training datasets often lead to failure when the force field encounters previously unseen atomic configurations during MD simulations. In this work, we present a framework for dynamically training ML force fields and demonstrate its effectiveness across materials with varying degrees of anharmonicity, including cubic boron arsenide (c-BAs), silicon (Si), and tin selenide (SnSe). Our method builds on the conventional lattice dynamics expansion of total energy and incorporates Bayesian error estimation to guide adaptive data acquisition during simulation. Specifically, we show that trajectory-averaged Bayesian errors enable efficient and targeted exploration of the configuration space, significantly enhancing the robustness and transferability of the resulting force fields. We further demonstrate how Bayesian error estimation can be applied to determine the convergence of the dynamic training without requiring additional ab initio data. This proposed framework offers a practical and easily implementable scheme to improve the training process, which is the most critical step in developing reliable ML force fields.

Fewest-switches surface hopping (FSSH) is the most popular method for simulating photochemical processes of molecular systems. Recently, we have constructed long short-term memory (LSTM) networks as a propagator for electronic subsystems in FSSH dynamics simulations. The collective results on Tully's three models have been reproduced satisfactorily. In the present work, we develop an extended LSTM-FSSH framework to simulate realistic photochemical reactions. The input features of LSTM as well as the training procedure are redesigned to represent high-dimensional nuclear degrees of freedom in an effective way. Equivariant neural networks are integrated with LSTM to build adiabatic potential energy surfaces in ground and excited states. Photoisomerizations of $\mathrm{CH_2NH}$ and azobenzene are simulated, showing that our new proposed LSTM-FSSH method can produce excited-state lifetimes and product yields accurately in comparison with conventional FSSH simulations as reference. Only 10 reference trajectories are required for training LSTM networks, and then a trajectory ensemble can be generated with very efficient LSTM-FSSH dynamics simulations to obtain collective results.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究使用机器学习增强的经典密度泛函理论分析受限空间中的共沸混合物行为，发现共沸组成下孔隙吸附无选择性，这一现象在超临界区域依然存在。

Fluid mixtures that exhibit an azeotrope cannot be purified by simple bulk distillation. Consequently, there is strong motivation to understand the behavior of azeotropic mixtures under confinement. We address this problem using a machine-learning-enhanced classical density functional theory applied to a binary Lennard-Jones mixture that exhibits azeotropic phase behavior. As proof-of-principle of a "train once, learn many" strategy, our approach combines a neural functional trained on a single-component repulsive reference system with a mean-field treatment of attractive interactions, derived within the framework of hyperdensity functional theory (hyper-DFT). The theory faithfully describes capillary condensation and results from grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations. Moreover, by taking advantage of a known accurate equation of state, the theory we present well-describes bulk thermodynamics by construction. Exploiting the computational efficiency of hyper-DFT, we systematically evaluate adsorption selectivity across a wide range of compositions, pressures, temperatures, and wall-fluid affinities. In cases where the wall-fluid interaction is the same for both species, we find that the pore becomes completely unselective at the bulk azeotropic composition. Strikingly, this unselective point persists far from liquid-vapor coexistence, including in the supercritical regime. Analysis of the bulk equation of state across a wide range of thermodynamic state points shows that the azeotropic composition coincides with equal partial molar volumes and an extremum in the isothermal compressibility. A complementary thermodynamic analysis demonstrates that unselective adsorption corresponds to an aneotrope (a point of zero relative adsorption) and an extremum in the interfacial free energy. We also find that the two interfaces of the slit pore behave independently down to remarkably small slits.

Altermagnetism has attracted considerable interest, yet its associated spintronic phenomena have so far been largely confined to electronic systems. In this work, we uncover a universal symmetry-based strategy for realizing topological altermagnets with the magnonic quantum spin Hall effect, as evidenced by a nonzero spin Chern number and protected helical edge states. Moreover, we demonstrate that chiral magnon splitting in altermagnets gives rise to an intrinsically anisotropic, momentum-resolved thermal Hall response, sharply contrasting with those in ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, thus offering enhanced flexibility for selective manipulation. As a concrete material realization, first-principles calculations and Heisenberg-DM model analysis reveal that V$_2$WS$_4$ bilayer exhibits $d$-wave altermagnetism, integer spin Chern number with helical magnon edge states, and the nonzero momentum-locked thermal Hall conductivity. Our results establish a direct link between topological magnons and altermagnetism, opening new avenues for dissipationless magnonic devices.

Recent works have suggested that transient suppression of a charge density wave (CDW) by an ultra-short excitation can lead to an inversion of the CDW phase. We experimentally investigate the dynamics of the CDW in K$_{0.3}$MoO$_{3}$ by time resolved x-ray diffraction after excitation with optical pulses. Our results indicate a transient inversion of the CDW phase close to the surface that evolves into a highly disordered state in less than one picosecond. Numerical simulations solving the Ginzburg-Landau equation including disorder from strong pinning defects reproduce our main observations. Our findings highlight the critical role of disorder in schemes for coherent control in condensed matter systems.

In quantum critical metals, a plethora of different non-Fermi liquids arises depending on the nature of critical fluctuations coupled to Fermi surfaces. In this paper, we classify non-Fermi liquids that arise from q=0 critical fluctuations and characterize their universal superconducting fluctuations. The essential tool is the projective fixed points, which generalizes the notion of fixed points to fixed trajectories that take into account the incessant running of the Fermi momentum under the renormalization group flow. Based on the topology of bundles of projective fixed points, non-Fermi liquids are first grouped into seven superuniversality classes. Each superuniversality class includes multiple universality classes, which are further classified by the universal pairing interactions and emergent symmetries. Despite the pairing interaction generated by critical fluctuations, some non-Fermi liquids remain stable down to zero temperature due to the incoherence of excitations and the lack of scale invariance caused by Fermi momentum. Depending on the strength and span of the universal pairing interaction in momentum space, the emergent symmetry of non-Fermi liquids may or may not be lower than that of Fermi liquids. In non-Fermi liquids that become superconductors at low temperatures, the universal data of the parent metal determine the lower bound for the superconducting transition temperature and the associated pairing symmetry. In superuniversality classes that contain non-Fermi liquids prone to non-s-wave superconducting instabilities, the critical angular momentum above which pairing instability becomes inevitable is sensitive to the Fermi momentum, and the associated superconducting transition temperature oscillates as a function of the density. We use physical examples, as well as a toy model, to elucidate the universal low-energy physics of all superuniversality classes.

We study the thermodynamic performance of a periodic quantum Otto cycle operating on the single-impurity Anderson model. Using a decomposition of the time-evolution generator based on the principle of minimal dissipation, combined with the numerically exact hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) method, we analyze the operating regimes of the quantum thermal machine and investigate effects of Coulomb interactions, strong system-reservoir coupling, and energy level alignments. Our results show that Coulomb interaction can change the operating regimes and may lead to an enhancement of the efficiency.

The third and fourth density and acoustic virial coefficients of neon were determined at temperatures between 10 and 5000 K from first principles employing the path-integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) approach. For these calculations, we used the pair potential of Hellmann $\textit{et al.}$ [J. Chem. Phys. 154, 164304 (2021)], which is based on supermolecular $\textit{ab initio}$ calculations with basis sets of up to octuple-zeta quality and levels of theory up to coupled cluster with single, double, triple, quadruple, and perturbative pentuple excitations [CCSDTQ(P)]. The potential also accounts for relativistic, retardation, and post-Born$-$Oppenheimer effects and is provided with reliable uncertainty estimates. To incorporate nonadditive interactions, we developed a nonadditive three-body potential based on extensive supermolecular CCSD(T), CCSDT, and CCSDT(Q) calculations with basis sets of up to sextuple-zeta quality. This potential also accounts for relativistic effects. The very small nonadditive four-body contributions to the fourth virial coefficients were considered using a relatively simple nonadditive four-body potential based on supermolecular CCSD(T) calculations. We calculated the third and fourth density and third acoustic virial coefficients directly by PIMC and the fourth acoustic virial coefficient indirectly using thermodynamic relations between the density and acoustic virial coefficients. The uncertainties of the pair potential and those estimated for our nonadditive three-body potential were rigorously propagated in the PIMC calculations into uncertainties for the virial coefficients. These uncertainties are distinctly smaller than those of almost all of the corresponding experimental virial coefficient data.

Coupled excitable systems can generate a variety of patterns. In this work, we investigate coupled Chialvo maps in two dimensions under two types of nearest-neighbor couplings. One coupling produces ringlike patterns, while the other produces spirals. The rings expand with increasing coupling, whereas spirals evolve into turbulence and dissipate at stronger coupling. To quantify these patterns, we introduce an analogue of the discriminant of the velocity gradient tensor and examine the persistence of its sign. For ring-type patterns, the persistence decays more slowly than exponentially, often following a power law or stretched exponential. When spiral structures remain intact, persistence saturates asymptotically and can exhibit superposed periodic oscillations, suggesting complex exponents at early times. These behaviors highlight deep connections with the underlying dynamics.

We demonstrate a model-free data analysis framework that leverages escort-weighted Shannon Entropy and several divergence matrices to detect phase transitions in scattering and imaging datasets. By establishing a connection between physical entropy and informational entropy, this approach provides a sensitive method for identifying phase transitions without an explicit physical model or order parameter. We further show that pairwise divergence matrices, including Kullback-Leibler divergence, Jeffrey Divergence, Jensen-Shannon Divergence and antisymmetric Kullback-Leibler divergence, provide more comprehensive measures of statistical changes than scalar entropy alone. Our approach successfully detects the onset of both long- and short-range order in neutron and X-ray scattering data, as well as a non-trivial phase transition in magnetic skyrmion lattices observed through Lorentz-transition electron microscopy. These results establish a framework for automated, model-free analysis of experimental data with broad applications in materials science and condensed matter physics.

- **TL;DR**: 在铁磁-超导纳米线中，多畴态下的磁结构可以维持超导性，而单畴饱和态则抑制超导性，这种磁结构可控的超导性可用于量子计算和存储器件。

In a one-dimensional ferromagnet-superconductor nanowire, magnetism can suppress superconductivity except where the Zeeman field is suppressed, for example domain wall superconductivity (DWS) near magnetic domain walls or multi-domain-averaged superconductivity (MDAS) in multi-domain states where the net magnetization over the coherence length averages to nearly zero. Here we study full-shell InAs/EuS/Al nanowires using scanning SQUID magnetometry and transport, and find superconductivity in the Al shell only when the EuS is in a multi-domain state, consistent with both DWS and MDAS, and absent in the saturated single-domain state. Scanning SQUID magnetometry further shows that the EuS magnetic texture is position dependent and reconfigurable by small changes in external magnetic field, including moving a well-defined domain wall at $\approx$5.5 $μ$m/mT with sub-mT fields, implying that any associated localized superconducting region would likewise be movable. Such magnetic texture controlled superconductivity along a nanowire may be useful for topological qubits, Andreev spin qubits, superconducting logic, and memory devices.

- **TL;DR**: 研究微波功率对钇铁石榴石-分裂环谐振器系统中磁子-光子耦合的影响，发现非线性自旋波相互作用通过功率诱导的磁静态模式耗散抑制耦合

We investigate the microwave-power dependence of magnon-photon coupling in a yttrium iron garnet-sphere/split-ring-resonator hybrid system at room temperature and demonstrate that nonlinear spin-wave interactions suppress the coupling through power-induced dissipation of magnetostatic modes. At low microwave power, the modes exhibit pronounced level repulsion, evidencing strong coupling to the microwave field. As the power increases, however, magnon linewidth broadening progressively weakens the coupling and ultimately suppresses it entirely below a threshold external magnetic field. We show that this behavior originates from Suhl's first-order instability: magnetostatic modes, which couple to the resonator, parametrically excites two counter-propagating magnons at half its frequency, causing modes below the threshold external magnetic field to vanish. In contrast, magnon modes above the threshold field remain robust even at high power, as the instability criterion is not satisfied in that regime. These results reveal a well-defined nonlinear boundary for magnon-photon coupled systems and highlight a favorable regime for exploiting nonlinear magnonics for frequency conversion, switching, and other functional magnonic devices.

The evaluation of the electrostatic potential is fundamental to the study of condensed phase systems. We discuss the calculation of the relevant lattice summations by Ewald-type techniques. A model charge density is introduced, that cancels multipole moments of the crystalline charge distribution up to a desired order, for accelerating convergence of the Ewald sums. The method is applicable to calculations of bulk systems, employing arbitrary unit cells in a classical or quantum context, and with arbitrary basis functions to represent the charge density. The approach clarifies a decades-old implementation in the CRYSTAL code.

Excited-state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) is a fundamental photochemical process in which photoexcitation induces proton transfer within a molecule, leading to the formation of a tautomeric excited state. It was observed experimentally that the 3-hydroxychromone (3-HC) system exhibits two distinct proton-transfer time scales upon excitation to the lowest "bright" singlet excited state: an ultrafast component on the femtosecond time scale and a slower one on the picosecond time scale, largely insensitive to solvent effects. Up to now, the microscopic origin of the second time constant has only been hypothesised. Here, using mixed quantum-classical non-adiabatic dynamics simulations, we explicitly observe the two ESIPT time constants and we rationalise the origin of the second time scale by the presence of a competitive out-of-plane hydrogen torsional motion. Comprehensive analysis of the excited-state potential energy surfaces and nonadiabatic trajectories enables us to construct an explicit reaction network for 3-HC, delineating the interplay between canonical ESIPT and torsion-mediated pathways. This unified mechanistic framework reconciles the coexistence of ultrafast and slower ESIPT components, offering new insights into the non-adiabatic excited-state dynamics of the system.

Emissive metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have emerged as excellent candidates for next-generation optoelectronics due to their sharp color purity, inexpensive processing, and bandgap tunability. However, the development of violet and ultraviolet light-emitting MHPs has lagged behind due to challenges related to material and device stability, charge carrier transport, tunability into the ultraviolet spectrum, toxicity, and scalability. Here, we review the progress of both violet and ultraviolet MHP nanomaterials and light-emitting diodes, including materials synthesis and device fabrication across various crystal structures and dimensions (e.g., bulk thin films, 2D thin films, nanoplatelets, colloidal nanocrystals, and more) as well as lead-free platforms (e.g., rare-earth metal halide perovskites). By highlighting several pathways to continue the development of violet and ultraviolet light-emitting MHPs while also proposing tactics to overcome their outstanding challenges, we demonstrate the potential of state-of-the-art violet and ultraviolet MHP materials and devices for important applications in public health, 3D printing, nanofabrication, and more.

Nonlinear magnetic response driven by time-periodic magnetic fields offers a distinct route to probe spin-resolved quantum geometry beyond conventional electric-field-driven nonlinear effects. While linear magnetic responses depend on the Zeeman quantum geometric tensor, the influence of generalized spin-rotation quantum geometries on nonlinear responses has not been established. Here, we develop a microscopic quantum-kinetic framework to elucidate how the Zeeman and spin-rotation quantum geometric tensors govern nonlinear gyrotropic magnetic transport in two-dimensional systems. We derive second-order gyrotropic magnetic currents and reveal a distinct geometric separation: the off-diagonal sector is controlled by the Zeeman symplectic and metric connections, whereas the diagonal sector is dictated by the spin-rotation quantum metric and Berry curvature. This identifies the spin-rotation quantum geometric tensor as a fundamental geometric quantity unique to the nonlinear regime. Applying our theory to massless Dirac fermions, hexagonally warped topological insulator surface states, tilted massive Dirac fermions, and parity-time symmetric CuMnAs, we demonstrate how specific symmetries selectively activate conduction and displacement channels. Our findings link spin-resolved quantum geometry to nonlinear magnetic transport, offering design principles for engineering tailored nonlinear magnetic responses in optoelectronic and spintronic devices.

In this work, we present Multimodal Equivariant Inverse Design Network (MEIDNet), a framework that jointly learns structural information and materials properties through contrastive learning, while encoding structures via an equivariant graph neural network (EGNN). By combining generative inverse design with multimodal learning, our approach accelerates the exploration of chemical-structural space and facilitates the discovery of materials that satisfy predefined property targets. MEIDNet exhibits strong latent-space alignment with cosine similarity 0.96 by fusion of three modalities through cross-modal learning. Through implementation of curriculum learning strategies, MEIDNet achieves ~60 times higher learning efficiency than conventional training techniques. The potential of our multimodal approach is demonstrated by generating low-bandgap perovskite structures at a stable, unique, and novel (SUN) rate of 13.6 %, which are further validated by ab initio methods. Our inverse design framework demonstrates both scalability and adaptability, paving the way for the universal learning of chemical space across diverse modalities.

- **TL;DR**: 通过NMR、THz-Raman光谱和DFT计算，系统表征了TDBC染料与银纳米棱镜形成的plexciton结构，揭示了分子在金属表面的吸附构型和堆积几何

Plexcitonic assemblies are hybrid materials composed of a plasmonic nanoparticle and molecular or semiconducting emitters whose electronic transitions are strongly coupled to the plasmonic mode. This coupling hybridizes the system modes into upper and lower polariton branches. The strength of the interaction depends on the number of emitters and on their orientation and spatial arrangement relative to the metallic surface. These structural factors have profound consequences for the ensuing photoexcited dynamics. Despite the extensive spectroscopic work on plexcitonic systems, direct understanding of the molecular geometry at the metal interface remains limited. In this work, we present a comprehensive structural characterization of one of the most widely studied plexcitons formed by the cyanine dye 5,5',6,6'-tetrachloro-1,1'-diethyl-3,3'-di(4-sulfobutyl)-benzimidazolocarbocyanine (TDBC) and silver nanoprisms using a combination of NMR, THz-Raman spectroscopy, and DFT calculations. By comparing the signals from the monomeric and aggregated forms of TDBC with that of the plexciton, we identify shared spectral fingerprints that reveal how molecular packing is modified when the aggregate adsorbs on the silver surface. We observe Raman modes specific to plexciton systems, and identify NOESY cross-peaks in the aliphatic region, that along with THz-Raman modes in the 10-400 cm$^{-1}$ region are sensitive indicators of aggregation geometry and adsorption. We find that isolated TDBC monomers adopt an asymmetric conformation in which both sulfobutyl chains lie on the same side of the chromophore, while J-aggregates adopt a symmetric up-down alternation of the chains from molecule to molecule. This work establishes the molecular geometry of a prototypical TDBC-silver plexciton, providing a structural benchmark for understanding geometry-dependent photophysics in hybrid exciton-plasmon systems.

- **TL;DR**: RTDE方法在模拟驱动量子系统时，相比传统非平衡格林函数方法能更准确地捕捉相关效应和光谱结构，在计算效率和精度间取得良好平衡。

We present a systematic comparison of the real-time Dyson expansion (RTDE) with established non-equilibrium Green's function approaches for simulating driven, interacting quantum systems. Focusing on density matrix dynamics, time-off-diagonal Green's functions, and time-resolved photoemission spectra, we benchmark RTDE against fully self-consistent Kadanoff-Baym equation (KBE) calculations, the generalized Kadanoff-Baym ansatz (GKBA), and exact diagonalization for small systems using second order many-body perturbation theory. Using a driven two-band Hubbard model, we show that mean-field single particle density matrix trajectories provide a reliable baseline for RTDE across a broad range of interaction strengths and excited-carrier populations. Further, RTDE accurately captures correlation effects in the Green's functions, including long-lived oscillations and revivals that are strongly suppressed by the overdamping inherent to self-consistent KBE schemes. As a consequence, RTDE resolves rich non-equilibrium spectral structure in time-resolved photoemission, such as interaction- and population-dependent quasiparticle splittings and bandgap renormalization, which are largely washed out in self-consistent approaches, yet are present in the exact solutions. Our results demonstrate that RTDE bridges the gap between mean-field propagation and full two-time KBE simulations, retaining favorable linear scaling while capturing essential dynamical correlations relevant for ultrafast spectroscopy.

- **TL;DR**: NbOI₂作为范德华铁电材料，在中等红外激光驱动下产生高达16阶的高次谐波，转换效率高，为紧凑型量子光源开发提供新途径。

Layered NbOX$_2$ ($X=\mathrm{Cl,\,Br,\,I}$), a member of the van der Waals ferroelectric family, exhibits intrinsic ferroelectricity and pronounced nonlinear optical responses, making it a promising candidate for integrated nanophotonics applications. While previous studies have emphasized the material's strong second-order nonlinear responses, higher-order nonlinear responses are still mostly unexplored. This work systematically investigates NbOI$_2$ using high harmonic generation (HHG) spectroscopy. Driven by an intense mid-infrared laser field centered at $\sim4~μ\mathrm{m}$ wavelength, highly anisotropic odd- and even-order harmonics up to the 16th order are generated at a low peak intensity of $0.4~\mathrm{TW\,cm^{-2}}$, extending beyond the material's bandgap. Both bulk and flake forms of NbOI$_2$ display pronounced harmonic emission from the near-infrared to the deep-ultraviolet spectral region, with a notably high overall conversion efficiency compared to other known materials. Polarization-resolved measurements reveal that even-order harmonics remain aligned with the crystal polar axis regardless of the driving-field orientation, whereas odd-order harmonics are dynamically affected. First-principles calculations suggest that the flat valence band associated with Peierls dimerization enhances HHG efficiency through electron correlation. These findings provide fresh perspectives on HHG in van der Waals ferroelectric materials and facilitate the development of compact and tunable quantum light sources.

Confinement strongly influences electrochemical systems, where structural control has enabled advances in nanofluidics, sensing, and energy storage. In electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs), or supercapacitors, energy density is governed by the accessible surface area of porous electrodes. Continuum models, built on first-principles transport equations, have provided critical insight into electrolyte dynamics under confinement but have largely focused on pores with straight walls. In such geometries, a fundamental trade-off emerges: wider pores charge faster but store less energy, while narrower pores store more charge but charge slowly. Here, we apply perturbation analysis to the Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) equations for a single pore of gradually varying radius, focusing on the small potential and slender aspect ratio regime. Our analysis reveals that sloped pore walls induce an additional ionic flux, enabling simultaneous acceleration of charging and enhancement of charge storage. The theoretical predictions closely agree with direct numerical simulations while reducing computational cost by 5-6 orders of magnitude. We further propose a modified effective circuit representation that captures geometric variation along the pore and demonstrate how the framework can be integrated into pore-network models. This work establishes a scalable approach to link pore geometry with double-layer dynamics and offers new design principles for optimizing supercapacitor performance.

The S=2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the orthogonal dimer lattice is studied. The edges of the exact dimer and Neel-ordered phases in the ground state of the system are examined by the numerical diagonalization method. Our present results are discussed by combining them with previously obtained estimates for smaller-S cases. We find that an intermediate region between the exact dimer and Neel-ordered phases gradually widens as spin S is increased up to S=2.

- **TL;DR**: 二维Type-II半狄拉克费米子在电子-电子相互作用下表现出能谱演化：从低能各向异性狄拉克色散到高能回旋镖形状，态密度从线性变为1/3幂次方，物理特性呈现连续变化的临界指数。

Type-II semi-Dirac fermions in two dimensions have been proposed to describe topologically nontrivial low energy excitations in titanium/vanadium oxide heterostructures. These quasiparticles appear at the merger of three Dirac cones, resulting in a non-zero Berry phase. We find, by employing Hartree-Fock, renormalization group and RPA techniques, that the spectrum is very sensitive to long-range electron-electron interactions and can undergo a profound transformation. Specifically the quasiparticle spectrum evolves, driven by interactions, from anisotropic Dirac dispersion at the lowest energies, towards the characteristic type-II semi-Dirac boomerang shape as the energy increases. The corresponding density of states varies between linear and power one third ($ρ(\varepsilon) \sim |\varepsilon| \rightarrow |\varepsilon|^{1/3}$). The crossover scale is controlled by the interaction strength $α= e^2/(\hbar v)$, and the specifics of the effective interacting Hamiltonian. Our results imply that various physical characteristics exhibit critical behavior with continuously varying 'critical exponents'; for example Landau levels in a magnetic field vary with the energy scale: $|\varepsilon_n(B)|\sim (nB)^{1/2} \rightarrow (nB)^{3/4}, n=0,1,2,...$, and similarly for other observables.

Symmetry provides powerful non-perturbative constraints in quantum many-body systems. A prominent example is the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) anomaly -- a mixed 't Hooft anomaly between internal and translational symmetries that forbids a trivial symmetric gapped phase. In this work, we investigate lattice translation operators in systems with an LSM anomaly. We construct explicit lattice models in two and three spatial dimensions and show that, after gauging the full internal symmetry, translation becomes non-invertible and fuses into defects of the internal symmetry. The result is supported by the anomaly-inflow in view of topological field theory. Our work extends earlier one-dimensional observations to a unified higher-dimensional framework and clarifies their origin in mixed anomalies and higher-group structures, highlighting a coherent interplay between internal and crystalline symmetries.

### Transferable mechanism of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy switching by hole doping in V$X_2$ ($X$=Te, Se, S) monolayers

The ability to tune and switch magnetic anisotropy to a perpendicular orientation is a key challenge for implementing 2D magnets in spintronic devices. H-phase vanadium dichalcogenides V$X_2$ ($X$=Te, Se, S) are promising ferromagnetic semiconductors with large magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE). Recent work has shown that hole doping can switch their easy axis to out-of-plane, though the microscopic origin of this perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) remains unclear. Using density-functional-theory calculations, we demonstrate that the PMA enhancement arises from first-order spin-orbit coupling (SOC) acting on topmost degenerate valence states with nonzero orbital angular momentum projection ($m_l\ne 0$). In this case, the $\hat{L}_z\hat{S}_z$ term dominates for perpendicular magnetization, while in-plane orientations involve only weaker, second-order SOC contributions. The increased valence bandwidth leads to depletion of higher-energy states upon hole doping, stabilizing PMA. From this mechanism, we identify two transferable design principles for enhancing MAE under weak hole doping: (i) orbital degeneracy at the valence-band edge protected by point-group symmetry and (ii) finite SOC in the degenerate manifold. Notably, we identify multiple magnetic semiconductors that meet these criteria and display enhanced MAE under hole doping. Furthermore, we show that band engineering can strategically place these degenerate orbitals at the valence band edge, significantly boosting PMA when hole-doped. We also examine trends in VTe$_2$, VSe$_2$, and VS$_2$ to determine the influence of crystal-field splitting, exchange interaction, and orbital hybridization on the valence band edges. These results provide both a fundamental understanding of PMA switching upon hole doping and a transferable strategy for tuning magnetic anisotropy, essential for designing high-performance spintronic materials.

- **TL;DR**: 研究使用高压扭转模拟天体撞击条件，测试AMP在极端条件下的聚合与稳定性，发现未形成聚合物但产生多种有机化合物，证实天体撞击对早期地球RNA前生命化学的重要性。

The origin of life is yet a compelling scientific mystery that has sometimes been attributed to high-pressure impacts by small solar system bodies such as comets, meteoroids, asteroids, and transitional objects. High-pressure torsion (HPT) is an innovative method with which to simulate the extreme conditions of astronomical impacts and offers insights relevant to prebiotic chemistry. In the present study, we investigated the polymerization and stability of adenosine monophosphate (AMP), a key precursor to ribonucleic acid (RNA), in dry and hydrated conditions (10 wt% water) under 6 GPa at ambient and boiling water temperatures. Comprehensive analyses with the use of X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance, scanning electron microscopy, and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry revealed no evidence of polymerization, while AMP partly transformed to other organic compounds such as nucleobase-derived fragments of adenine, phosphoribose fragments, dehydrated adenosine, protonated adenosine, and oxidized adenosine. The torque measurements during HPT further highlight the mechanical behavior of AMP under extreme conditions. These findings suggest that, while HPT under the conditions tested does not facilitate polymerization, the formation of various compounds from AMP confirms the significance of astronomical impacts on the prebiotic chemistry of RNA on early Earth.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文研究了强关联电子系统中相互作用猝灭后的空间自组织现象，发现均匀非平衡动力学本质上是不稳定的，即使微小的空间涨落也会导致系统演化到非均匀状态。

Interaction quenches in strongly correlated electron systems provide a powerful route to probe nonequilibrium many-body dynamics. For the Hubbard model, nonequilibrium dynamical mean-field theory has revealed coherent post-quench oscillations, dynamical crossovers, and long-lived transient regimes. However, these studies are largely restricted to spatially homogeneous dynamics and therefore neglect the role of spatial structure formation during ultrafast evolution. Here we investigate interaction quenches in the half-filled Hubbard model using a real-space time-dependent Gutzwiller framework. We show that homogeneous nonequilibrium dynamics is generically unstable: even arbitrarily weak spatial fluctuations grow dynamically and drive the system toward intrinsically inhomogeneous states. Depending on the interaction strength, the post-quench evolution exhibits spatial differentiation, nucleation, and slow coarsening of Mott-like domains. Our results establish spatial self-organization as a generic feature of far-from-equilibrium correlated matter and reveal a fundamental limitation of spatially homogeneous nonequilibrium theories.

We investigate a single magnetic impurity in the presence of strong spin-orbit coupling and single-ion anisotropy. We show that at sufficiently strong coupling there exists a finite temperature window, before the moment is completely screened, where the magnetic anisotropy of the system flips: the hard-axis becomes the easy-axis or vice versa. We derive this rigorously for a single impurity using numerical renormalization group calculations as well as Nozieres' strong-coupling limit and discuss its relevance to heavy-fermion compounds which order magnetically along the hard-direction. We show that the coexistence of Curie-like response and Kondo fluctuations is stabilized along the initially hard direction leading to the anisotropy switch.

Large-scale computational surveys are increasingly used to map the landscape of stable crystalline materials. We report a high-throughput energy screening of inorganic crystals that enumerates binary and ternary compositions up to a specified unit-cell complexity, yielding 39 billion protostructures. Candidates predicted to lie on or near the convex hull are retained, and their degrees of freedom are explored via Latin hypercube sampling followed by relaxation with machine-learned interatomic potentials. The resulting dataset contains 81 million locally relaxed crystal structures spanning 4495 ternary phase diagrams constructed from elements ranging from lithium to bromine and contains 88,498 crystal prototypes not present in existing crystal-structure databases. The methods are validated both for three well-explored materials systems, Zr-Zn-N, Ti-Zn-N, and Hf-Zn-N, and by comparing with known data for structures resulting from the larger screening. The work provides a systematic map of low-energy compositional-structural space and a large, structured pool of candidates for downstream property evaluation and materials design.

- **TL;DR**: 提出ML-LCA框架，将上游机器学习辅助材料发现与下游生命周期评估整合，实现性能与可持续性的协同优化，而非传统的事后评估模式。

Artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed materials discovery, enabling rapid exploration of chemical space through generative models and surrogate screening. Yet current AI workflows optimize performance first, deferring sustainability to post synthesis assessment. This creates inefficiency by the time environmental burdens are quantified, resources have been invested in potentially unsustainable solutions. The disconnect between atomic scale design and lifecycle assessment (LCA) reflects fundamental challenges, data scarcity across heterogeneous sources, scale gaps from atoms to industrial systems, uncertainty in synthesis pathways, and the absence of frameworks that co-optimize performance with environmental impact. We propose to integrate upstream machine learning (ML) assisted materials discovery with downstream lifecycle assessment into a uniform ML-LCA environment. The framework ML-LCA integrates five components, information extraction for building materials-environment knowledge bases, harmonized databases linking properties to sustainability metrics, multi-scale models bridging atomic properties to lifecycle impacts, ensemble prediction of manufacturing pathways with uncertainty quantification, and uncertainty-aware optimization enabling simultaneous performance-sustainability navigation. Case studies spanning glass, cement, semiconductor photoresists, and polymers demonstrate both necessity and feasibility while identifying material-specific integration challenges. Realizing ML-LCA demands coordinated advances in data infrastructure, ex-ante assessment methodologies, multi-objective optimization, and regulatory alignment enabling the discovery of materials that are sustainable by design rather than by chance.

- **TL;DR**: 氢吸收显著改变不锈钢的电子和磁结构性质，形成纳米级不均匀区域，氢优先在这些区域附近聚集，但未发现与位错密度的直接关联。

Hydrogen absorption significantly alters the mechanical properties of steel. However, absorbed hydrogen also influences its electronic and magneto-structural properties, helping to interpret how hydrogen is incorporated. This study therefore investigates the influence of hydrogen incorporation on the electronic and magneto-structural properties of X2CrNi18-9 stainless steel in different microstructural states. Microstructural characterization included analytic electron microscopy mapping, X-ray diffraction and thermodynamic stability maps to evaluate grain size, dislocation density and chemical homogeneity. The electronic properties were characterized using the Seebeck coefficient, while the magneto-structural properties were investigated using diffuse neutron scattering and small-angle neutron scattering (SANS). Hydrogen incorporation showed clear changes in the Seebeck coefficients. Magnetic SANS in conjunction with diffuse neutron scattering indicates the existence of nanoscale inhomogeneities with the same fcc structure as the bulk, but with correlation lengths of a few nanometres. The size of these inhomogeneities increased with hydrogen incorporation, suggesting that hydrogen preferentially accumulates in their vicinity. However, no direct correlation between the electronic and magneto-structural properties and the dislocation density could be demonstrated. We suggest that studies such as these will lead in the medium term to the development of guidelines for material design to make steels more resistant to hydrogen.

We investigate the possibility of the emergence of ultra-complex conductivity diagrams in the nearly free electron approximation for metals with cubic symmetry. Estimates show that the emergence of such diagrams requires the Fermi level to fall into very narrow energy intervals within the conduction band. In our view, this circumstance is mostly due to the high symmetry and the simplest analytical form of the dispersion relations $ε({\bf p})$ under consideration.

Transition-metal dichalcogenides of the pyrite-marcasite family are model systems of crystal chemistry. A few of these show polymorphism. The theoretical ground state of CoSe2 is marcasite, but the material is typically synthesized in the pyrite structure. Polymorphism has been observed in nanoparticles and synthetic control of the polymorphs of CoSe2 has not been achieved. We have synthesized material libraries of the Fe1-xCoxSe2 series by combining combinatorial deposition and ex-situ selenization. The approach allows to efficiently explore substitution ranges and crystal structures that form for different synthesis conditions. We find that higher levels of Co content x within the marcasite structure are possible when synthesizing at low temperatures. At a synthesis temperature of only 250° C, we have successfully synthesized marcasite CoSe2 as the majority phase. Density functional theory simulations reveal that the two isomorphs of CoSe2 are extremely close in energy and that the orthorhombic phase is the energetic ground state. Our experimental and theoretical data show that the marcasite structure is the equilibrium phase of Fe1-xCoxSe2 in the entire composition range.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究分析了溶质粒子在两个间隙固溶体相之间热激活转移的动力学，建立了基于统计力学的速率定律，解释了金属氢化物充电在相变点附近急剧减慢的实验现象。

This work inspects the thermally activated transfer of solute particles across the interface between two interstitial solid solution phases that equilibrate internally by fast diffusion on conserved arrays of sites. When each phase is considered as an ergodic ensemble of particles, statistical mechanics predicts the occupancy of the transition states at equilibrium to depend on the barrier energy and on the chemical potentials and vacancy fractions in each of the phases. A rate law for the non-equilibrium interfacial transfer, based on a constant transition probability between activated states, naturally satisfies the principle of detailed balance. Contrary to Butler-Volmer-type laws, values of the particle chemical potentials enter explicitly rather than through their difference. This, along with the dependency on the vacancy fractions, implies here an exchange flux density that depends explicitly on the compositions at equilibrium. The results can explain experimental observations of a drastic slow-down in the charging of metal hydrides near phase transformations or miscibility-gap critical points.

Polaron formation in pump-probe experiments is an inherently non-equilibrium phenomenon, driven by the ultrafast coupled dynamics of electrons and phonons, and culminating in the emergence of a localized quasiparticle state. In this work, we present a first-principles quantum-kinetic theory of polaron formation that captures the real-time evolution of electronic and lattice degrees of freedom in presence of electron-phonon coupling. We implement this framework to investigate the ultrafast polaron formation in the prototypical polar insulator MgO. This approach allows us to determine the characteristic timescales of polaron localization and to identify its distinctive dynamical fingerprint. Our results establish clear and experimentally accessible criteria for identifying polaron formation in pump-probe experiments.

Superconducting resonators and qubits are limited by dielectric losses from surface oxides. Surface oxides are mitigated through various strategies such as the addition of a metal capping layer, surface passivation, and acid processing. In this study, we demonstrate the use of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) as a rapid characterization tool to study the effectiveness cap layers for niobium for further device fabrication. We non-destructively evaluate 17 capping layers to characterize their ability to prevent oxygen diffusion, and the effects of standard fabrication processes -- annealing, resist stripping, and acid cleaning. We downselect for resilient capping layers and test their microwave resonator performance.

Disorder is ubiquitous in quantum materials, and its interplay with topology can generate phases absent in the clean limit. Using the Haldane model as a minimal setting, we show that disorder not only shifts topological boundaries but also stabilizes a topological Anderson insulator (TAI) between trivial and Chern insulating regimes. Employing the local Chern marker as a real-space topological probe, we map the full phase diagram and demonstrate that the TAI forms a finite domain bounded by trivial and Anderson insulators. Multifractal analysis of low-energy eigenstates at the boundary reveals universal critical spectra, independent of whether disorder generates or destroys topology. These results place topology, localization, and criticality within a unified framework and provide clear benchmarks for real-space diagnostics of disordered topological phases.
