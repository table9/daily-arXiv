- **TL;DR**: 该研究通过路径积分分子动力学模拟和能量分解分析，将水/空气界面氢键强度、不对称性与实验可观测的再取向动力学和SFG光谱联系起来，建立了氢键强度与界面动力学的定量关系。

Path-integral molecular dynamics simulations and electronic structure-based energy decomposition analysis (EDA) are employed to connect hydrogen bond (H-bond) strength, its asymmetry, and the total delocalization energy at the water/air interface to experimentally measurable observables, such as the reorientation dynamics and the sum-frequency generation (SFG) spectrum. Using SFG spectra for distinct layers at the water/air interface, we validate the accuracy of our simulations and report a red-shift from the interface to bulk and a strongly bonded water peak at around 3250 cm$^{-1}$ in the layer closest to bulk. The reorientation dynamics of water molecules slow down from the interface to bulk, which correlates with the SFG results. From our EDA based on absolutely localized molecular orbitals, we observe a strong decline in total delocalization energy from bulk to the interface, as well as a decline in the strength of the strongest donor and acceptor interactions. The asymmetry between the two strongest interactions similarly rises towards the interface, while the importance of interactions from the outer solvation shells is greatly diminished and is lower than previously reported. Finally, we find that the strength of the strongest H-bond donor/acceptor is best correlated with the local minimum of the autocorrelation function resembling the L2 band librational motions. Following that, we propose a simple yet quantitative relationship between H-bond strength and the short-time reorientation dynamics at the water/air interface that could potentially be extended to predict H-bond strength in other hydrophobic systems from experimentally obtainable observables.

- **TL;DR**: 重新测定锶-87核四极矩，通过分子方法结合实验测量与高精度相对论计算，得到比当前公认值大10%的新结果。

The nuclear electric quadrupole moment (NQM) of $^{87}$Sr has recently been revisited using high-precision relativistic atomic calculations [B. Lu et al., Phys. Rev. A 100, 012504 (2019)], indicating that the currently accepted value should be revised and that their result may serve as a new reference. In the present work, we determine the NQM of $^{87}$Sr from the molecular method, by combining the experimentally measured nuclear quadrupole coupling constants (NQCCs) of SrO and SrS with highly accurate relativistic calculations of the electric field gradient (EFG) at the Sr nucleus. Electronic correlation is treated at the CCSD(T), CCSD-T and CCSD$\tilde{\text{T}}$ levels. The iterative T contribution of the latter, composite scheme was obtained using a newly implemented parallel scheme where the distributed memory tensor library Cyclops Tensor Framework (CTF) was made available to the DIRAC code for relativistic molecular calculations through TAPP, the new community standard for tensor operations. All correlated calculations are performed using the exact two-component molecular mean-field Hamiltonian (X2C$\mathrm{mmf}$). The Gaunt two-electron interaction is incorporated, an even-tempered optimized quadruple-$ζ$ quality basis set is employed, and vibrational corrections are accounted for. Our best result is $Q($$^{87}$Sr$) = 0.33666 \pm 0.00258$ b, which is about 10% larger than currently accepted standard value, while it is in excellent agreement with recent determinations [Y.-B. Tang, arXiv:2512.07603 [physics.atom-ph] (2025)].

- **TL;DR**: 提出结合虚时/实时时间依赖方法，用于计算开壳层体系的线性吸收光谱，基于电子附着和电离势EOMCC理论框架。

We present a combined imaginary-time/real-time time-dependent (TD) approach for evaluating linear absorption spectra of open-shell systems at the electron attachment (EA) and ionization potential (IP) equation-of-motion coupled-cluster (EOMCC) levels of theory and within the exact two-component relativistic framework. The absorption lineshape is given by the Fourier transform of the electric dipole autocorrelation function, which is obtained from a real-time simulation. Approximations of the lowest-energy EA- and IP-EOMCC eigenstates, which are required as initial states for the real-time simulation, are generated by propagating a Koopman EA/IP state in imaginary time. TD-EA/IP-EOMCC linear absorption spectra of open-shell atomic systems (Na, K, Rb, F, Cl, and Br) closely reproduce those obtained from standard TD-EA/IP procedures carried out in the frequency domain. We find that the existence of low-lying states with non-negligible overlap with the Koopman determinant impacts the length of the imaginary-time propagation required to obtain an initial state that produces correct absolute energies and peak height intensities in spectra extracted from the subsequent real-time TD-EA/IP-EOMCC calculations.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究通过分子动力学模拟揭示了纳米毛细管尺寸对多层二维方冰临界结晶压力的影响机制，建立了二维方冰与三维体相冰之间的关联。

Low-dimensional ice trapped in nanocapillaries is a fascinating phenomenon and is ubiquitous in our daily lives. As a decisive factor of the confinement effect, the size of nanocapillary significantly affects the critical crystallization pressure and crystalline structure, especially for multi-layered ices. By choosing square ice as a typical two-dimensional (2D) multi-layered ice pattern and using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we further unveil the variation mechanism of critical crystallization pressure with the nanocapillary size. The results show a strong dependence of the critical crystallization pressure on the size of the graphene sheet for monolayer, bilayer, and trilayer square ice. The quasi-macroscopic crystallization pressure, the actual pressure of water molecules, and the freezable region between them are all strongly dependent on the nanocapillary width. As the size of the capillary becomes larger in all three directions, the critical crystallization pressure converges to the true macroscopic crystallization pressure, which is very close to the value of the crystallization pressure for bulk ice. A direct correlation is established between 2D square ice and three-dimensional (3D) bulk ice by the critical crystallization pressure. There is an unfreezable threshold for crystallizing spontaneously in practice when the quasi-macroscopic crystallization pressure is equal to the actual pressure, which can explain the limit of nanocapillary width for multi-layered ice.

- **TL;DR**: H₃S硫氢化物在155 GPa下具有203 K的超导临界温度，但其相图细节仍不完整。研究通过路径积分分子动力学结合MACE神经网络势，揭示了Im3̄m和R3m相之间的铁电转变源于134 GPa的量子临界点，实验Tc峰值位于量子临界点上方的顺电区域，系统临界行为属于4D Ising普适类。

H$_3$S sulfur hydride has been widely investigated for its high superconducting critical temperature $T_c$ of 203 K at about $p_c = 155$ GPa. Despite being the precursor of superconducting hydrides, a detailed picture of its phase diagram in an extended temperature and pressure range is still missing. To determine it with inclusion of both thermal and quantum effects, we carry out path integral molecular dynamics combined to a MACE neural network potential trained on BLYP density functional theory configurations. The resulting H$_3$S phase diagram is characterized by the ferroelectric transition between the Im$\bar{3}$m and R3m phases, which originates from a quantum critical point (QCP) located at $p_\mathrm{QCP} \approx 134$ GPa. We show that the experimental $T_c$ peak falls into a paraelectric region of large nuclear quantum fluctuations above the ferroelectric QCP, as measured by local phonon Green's functions resolved in imaginary time, where fluctuating dipole moments are at play. We study the critical behavior of the system in the proximity of the QCP by a finite-size scaling analysis, showing that it belongs to the 4D Ising universality class. We finally discuss its implications for the superconducting state.

### Topological Defects from Quantum Reset Dynamics

- **TL;DR**: 量子重置导致量子相变淬火中缺陷密度从Kibble-Zurek标度向反Kibble-Zurek标度转变，出现局部最小值

We analyze mechanisms for universal out-of-equilibrium dynamics near criticality by exploring the effect of randomized quantum resetting (QR) under a finite-time quench across a quantum phase transition. Using the transverse-field Ising chain as a generic model and exploiting its exact solution, QR is found to cause a crossover of the scaling of the topological defect density with the time scale $τ$ of the quench, from Kibble-Zurek to anti-Kibble-Zurek scaling as $τ$ increases. This reflects a competition between non-adiabatic quench-driven excitations and QR, giving rise to local minima of the defect densities at optimal annealing times. These times and the corresponding local minima are shown to scale as universal power laws with the rate of QR. Additional results for the scaling of the mean excess energy suggest that a system driven across a quantum critical point exhibits the same scaling behavior under a linear quench with QR as with uncorrelated noise.

- **TL;DR**: 研究双曲格点到欧几里得格点的交叉模型，通过逐步引入欧几里得缺陷，发现边界物理在缺陷存在下保持稳健，而体性质受显著影响。

We study tight-binding models in the crossover from hyperbolic to Euclidean lattices, realized through the successive insertion of Euclidean defects into hyperbolic lattices. We analyze how the holographic two-point boundary correlation function and bulk density of states evolve as defects are gradually introduced. We find that bulk properties are strongly affected by the presence of Euclidean defects, whereas boundary observables remain remarkably robust even at high defect fractions. This robustness indicates that essential features of boundary physics on hyperbolic lattices, which capture aspects of AdS/CFT-like dualities in discrete systems, can be reproduced both experimentally and numerically without requiring perfectly hyperbolic lattices, thereby reducing the system size needed for implementation.

- **TL;DR**: 使用随机森林模型定量预测X射线光谱各向异性，基于晶体结构文件的局部几何和化学信息，在Materials Project的10,000多个过渡金属结构上训练，能准确预测光谱各向异性程度

Polarization analysis in x-ray spectroscopy provides an orientation dependent sensitivity to local bonding environments. For a cluster of atoms, polarization sensitivity is most often discussed through the lens of point group symmetries. However, this is a discrete, qualitative method of classifying clusters, and it does little to indicate the degree of spectral anisotropy. Here we adopt a random forest model for quantitative prediction of spectral anisotropy. Its input relies on simplified local geometric and chemical information that can be obtained from any crystal structure file. The model is trained on over 10,000 experimentally realized transition metal structures from the Materials Project, with the target being VtC-XES calculated using the real space Green's function code FEFF. We find that the model can strongly predict the degree of spectral anisotropy, with the primary factors being derived from the spatial moments of ligands in a cluster.

- **TL;DR**: 该调查提出了一种以流程为中心的视角，将AI与材料科学融合，从数据准备到实验平台接口构建端到端系统，强调代理式设计而非孤立模型，旨在实现真正的材料发现加速。

The convergence of artificial intelligence and materials science presents a transformative opportunity, but achieving true acceleration in discovery requires moving beyond task-isolated, fine-tuned models toward agentic systems that plan, act, and learn across the full discovery loop. This survey advances a unique pipeline-centric view that spans from corpus curation and pretraining, through domain adaptation and instruction tuning, to goal-conditioned agents interfacing with simulation and experimental platforms. Unlike prior reviews, we treat the entire process as an end-to-end system to be optimized for tangible discovery outcomes rather than proxy benchmarks. This perspective allows us to trace how upstream design choices-such as data curation and training objectives-can be aligned with downstream experimental success through effective credit assignment.
  To bridge communities and establish a shared frame of reference, we first present an integrated lens that aligns terminology, evaluation, and workflow stages across AI and materials science. We then analyze the field through two focused lenses: From the AI perspective, the survey details LLM strengths in pattern recognition, predictive analytics, and natural language processing for literature mining, materials characterization, and property prediction; from the materials science perspective, it highlights applications in materials design, process optimization, and the acceleration of computational workflows via integration with external tools (e.g., DFT, robotic labs). Finally, we contrast passive, reactive approaches with agentic design, cataloging current contributions while motivating systems that pursue long-horizon goals with autonomy, memory, and tool use. This survey charts a practical roadmap towards autonomous, safety-aware LLM agents aimed at discovering novel and useful materials.

### An Oscillation-Free Real Fluid Quasi-Conservative Finite Volume Method for Transcritical and Phase-Change Flows

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种新的真实流体准保守有限体积方法，用于模拟涉及冲击波的跨临界和相变流动，通过局部线性化状态方程消除压力振荡。

A new Real Fluid Quasi-Conservative (RFQC) finite volume method is developed to address the numerical simulation of real fluids involving shock waves in transcritical and phase-change flows. To eliminate the spurious pressure oscillations inherent in fully conservative schemes, we extend the classic five-equation quasi-conservative model, originally designed for two-phase flows, to real fluids governed by arbitrary equations of state (EoS). The RFQC method locally linearizes the real fluid EoS at each grid point and time step, constructing and evolving the frozen Grüneisen coefficient $Γ$ and the linearization remainder $E_0$ via two advection equations. At the end of each time step, the evolved $Γ$ and $E_0$ are utilized to reconstruct the oscillation-free pressure field, followed by a thermodynamic re-projection applied to the conserved variables. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that, in smooth regions, the energy conservation error of the RFQC method is a high-order term relative to the spatial reconstruction truncation error. In discontinuous regions, this error is determined by the entropy increase rate, thereby maintaining consistency with the inherent truncation error of shock-capturing methods. A series of numerical tests verifies that the method can robustly simulate complex flow processes with only minor energy conservation errors, including transcritical flows, phase transitions, and shock-interface interactions. The RFQC method is proven to be both accurate and robust in capturing shock waves and phase transitions.

### The Entropic Barrier around the Conical Intersection Seam

- **TL;DR**: 论文通过统计力学分析证明，圆锥交叉点附近存在无限自由能垒，导致混合量子-经典模拟无法采样到精确简并的几何结构，但依然能有效捕捉非绝热行为。

Conical intersections (CIs) are seen as the main mediators of nonadiabatic transitions; yet, mixed quantum-classical (MQC) simulations rarely, if ever, sample geometries with exactly degenerate electronic energies. Here we show that this behavior arises from a fundamental statistical-mechanical constraint. Using a linear vibronic coupling model, we derive the free energy along the adiabatic energy gap and demonstrate analytically that as the gap approaches zero, an infinite free-energy barrier arises around the CI seam. Molecular dynamics simulations of the methaniminium cation on the S$_1$ surface confirm this prediction: trajectories can approach regions with small adiabatic gaps, but never reach the CI seam, even if the CI corresponds to a region of lowest potential energy. These results clarify why MQC methods successfully capture nonadiabatic behavior without sampling exact degeneracies and agree with recent findings that classical trajectories can sense the presence of CIs without visiting them.

### Novel dynamical excitations and roton-based measurement of Cooper-pair momentum in a two-dimensional Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov superfluid on optical lattices

Determining the center-of-mass (COM) momentum of Cooper pairs in unconventional superconductors or superfluids is a topic of great interest in condensed matter physics and ultracold atomic gases. Theoretically, we investigate the dynamical excitations of a two-dimensional spin-polarized attractive Hubbard model on a square optical lattice under an effective Zeeman field by computing the density and spin dynamical structure factors, focusing on phase transition from a Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) superfluid to an Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) superfluid. In the FFLO superfluid, besides the phonon mode in the density channel, a low-energy bogolon mode emerges in the spin channel, which is associated with Bogoliubov quasiparticles on a Bogoliubov Fermi surface. Moreover, the dynamical excitations exhibit pronounced anisotropy in momentum space due to the finite COM momentum. At half filling, the roton mode around $[π,π]$ evolves from a point-like minimum into a ring structure shifted by the COM momentum across the BCS-FFLO transition, providing a roton-based protocol to extract the COM momentum. These predictions provide key insights for confirming the existence of FFLO superfluids and understanding their dynamical excitation spectra.

In order to solidify the usefulness of metadynamics in studying nucleation of crystals from supercooled liquids, we provide a specific procedure to calculate nucleation free energy barriers. After a pedagogical review of the important elements of classical nucleation theory and how metadynamics is used to find nucleation free energy barriers, we explain the benefits of local collective variables over more common global collective variables. We show how a metadynamics free energy barrier must be carefully postprocessed so that classical nucleation theory can be applied to calculate nucleation rates. We apply our procedure to a Yukawa plasma and show that a particular physically-motivated fit to metadynamics data reproduces low-temperature reference data, justifying the usefulness of metadynamics to predict nucleation rates and the nucleation critical temperature.

### On the Landauer formula in interfacial thermal transport

- **TL;DR**: 朗道尔公式不仅限于声子气体模型，适用于粒子和波描述的声子，只要传输函数定义良好

In this commentary, we clarify that the Landauer formula is not limited to the phonon gas model. It is fundamentally more general and applies to both particle- and wave-based descriptions of phonons, provided the transmission function is well defined. In the harmonic regime, the phonon transmission function and the resulting Landauer expression for heat current are exact. They can be rigorously derived using the atomistic Green's function method, which treats phonons as waves and does not require phonon dispersion in the interface region. In short, the Landauer framework remains valid for ideal, disordered, and defective interfaces, as long as an appropriate transmission function is used.

We study the presence of an external magnetic field, in combination with torsional strain, over the electron-phonon interactions in a type I Weyl semimetal. This particular superposition of field and strain, modeled in the continuum approximation by an effective gauge field, leads to an asymmetric pseudo-magnetic field at each Weyl node of opposite chirality. Therefore, we also studied the role of nodal asymmetry in the properties of the system by means of the Kadanoff-Wilson renormalization group and the corresponding flow equations. By solving those, we discuss the evolution of the coupling parameters of the theory, and analyze possible fixed points and lattice (Peierls) instabilities emerging from interactions between phonons with the chiral Landau level in the very strong pseudo-magnetic field regime.

- **TL;DR**: QUASAR是一个用于原子尺度模拟的通用自主系统，能够自主编排复杂多尺度工作流，包括密度泛函理论、机器学习势、分子动力学和蒙特卡洛模拟，旨在促进生产级科学发现。

The integration of large language models (LLMs) into materials science offers a transformative opportunity to streamline computational workflows, yet current agentic systems remain constrained by rigid tool-calling approaches and narrowly scoped agents. In this work, we introduce QUASAR, a universal autonomous system for atomistic simulation designed to facilitate production-grade scientific discovery. QUASAR autonomously orchestrates complex multi-scale workflows across diverse methods, including density functional theory, machine learning potentials, molecular dynamics, and Monte Carlo simulations. The system incorporates robust mechanisms for adaptive planning, context-efficient memory management, and hybrid knowledge retrieval to navigate real-world research scenarios without human intervention. We benchmark QUASAR against a series of three-tiered tasks, progressing from routine tasks to frontier research challenges such as photocatalyst screening and novel material assessment. These results suggest that QUASAR can function as a general atomistic reasoning system rather than a task-specific automation framework. They also provide initial evidence supporting the potential deployment of agentic AI as a component of computational chemistry research workflows, while identifying areas requiring further development.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种用于金属中电子-声子耦合过程的半隐式Lax-Wendroff格式，基于双温度动力学方程，能够有效捕捉从弹道到扩散区域的电子-声子耦合或热传导过程。

A semi-implicit Lax-Wendroff scheme is developed for electron-phonon coupling process in metals based on the two-temperature kinetic equations. The core of this method is to integrate the evolution information of physical equations into the numerical modeling process, which leads to that the time step or cell size is not limited by the relaxation time and mean free path. Specifically, the finite difference method is used to solve the kinetic model again when reconstructing the interfacial distribution function, through which the particle migration, scattering and electron-phonon coupling processes are coupled together within a single time step. Numerical tests demonstrate that this method could efficiently capture electron-phonon coupling or heat conduction processes from the ballistic to diffusive regimes. It provides a new tool for describing electron-phonon coupling or thermal management in microelectronic devices.

- **TL;DR**: FragmentFlow：一种分而治之的方法，通过训练生成模型预测反应核心原子的过渡态几何结构，然后将取代基片段重新连接到预测的核心上，从而解决大分子过渡态预测的分布偏移问题。

Transition states (TSs) are central to understanding and quantitatively predicting chemical reactivity and reaction mechanisms. Although traditional TS generation methods are computationally expensive, recent generative modeling approaches have enabled chemically meaningful TS prediction for relatively small molecules. However, these methods fail to generalize to practically relevant reaction substrates because of distribution shifts induced by increasing molecular sizes. Furthermore, TS geometries for larger molecules are not available at scale, making it infeasible to train generative models from scratch on such molecules. To address these challenges, we introduce FragmentFlow: a divide-and-conquer approach that trains a generative model to predict TS geometries for the reactive core atoms, which define the reaction mechanism. The full TS structure is then reconstructed by re-attaching substituent fragments to the predicted core. By operating on reactive cores, whose size and composition remain relatively invariant across molecular contexts, FragmentFlow mitigates distribution shifts in generative modeling. Evaluated on a new curated dataset of reactions involving reactants with up to 33 heavy atoms, FragmentFlow correctly identifies 90% of TSs while requiring 30% fewer saddle-point optimization steps than classical initialization schemes. These results point toward scalable TS generation for high-throughput reactivity studies.

- **TL;DR**: 提出一个双寿命唯象模型解释铜氧化物超导体的ARPES谱，区分前向散射与大角度散射，并获取费米面外的能隙函数信息

Several models of the strange-metal state of the cuprate superconductors postulate the existence of strong inelastic forward scattering of the electrons, but direct evidence of such scattering is missing. Here we show that angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) provides a unique tool which can address this issue. We propose a two-lifetime phenomenological model of the superconducting state of the cuprates and we show that it explains several salient low-energy features of the measured ARPES spectra. The model enables discrimination between forward- and large-angle scattering and, in addition, gives access to the magnitude of the gap function away from the Fermi surface.

- **TL;DR**: 论文通过OFC地震模型模拟，揭示了从临界行为（稳定指数）到准临界行为（指数大于3/2）的转变，该转变由耗散引起的记忆效应驱动，为自然界中观察到的尺度不变动力学提供了统一框架。

Scale-invariant avalanches -- with events of all sizes following power-law distributions -- are considered critical. Above the upper critical dimension of four, the mean-field solution with a robust $3/2$ size exponent describes the dynamics. In two and three dimensions, spatial constraints yield smaller yet robust exponent values governed by universality classes. However, both earthquake data and experiments often show exponent values larger than $3/2$, challenging those theoretical arguments based on critical behavior. Through extensive simulations in the classical OFC earthquake model, here we show a clear transition from the theoretical expected behavior of a robust exponent value, to a regime of quasi-critical dynamics with larger than $3/2$ exponents that depend on dissipation. While the first critical regime exhibits an inherently memoryless behavior, both the transition and the second regime are driven by memory effects provoked by the growth of avalanches over the traces left by previous events, due to dissipative mechanisms. The system hovers at a distance $d_{cp}$ from the critical point, and accounting for a power-law distribution of $d_{cp}$, validated by susceptibility measurements, captures the transition. This framework provides a unified description of both critical and quasi-critical behavior, and thus of the full spectrum of scale-free dynamics observed in nature.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一类开放费米子模型，其中二次Liouvillian具有可精确求解的高阶异常点，系统尺寸接近的异常点导致无间隙谱，多体扰动使其破裂并产生分数幂律标度

We propose a general class of open fermionic models where quadratic Liouvillians governing the dissipative dynamics feature exactly solvable higher-order exceptional points (EPs). Invoking the formalism of third quantization, we show that, among the multiple EPs of Liouvillian, an EP with its order approaching the system size arises as the quasisteady state of the system, leading to a gapless Liouvillian spectrum. By introducing perturbations, in the form of many-body quantum-jump processes, these higher-order EPs break down, leading to finite Liouvillian gaps with fractional power-law scalings. While the power-law scaling is a signature of the higher-order EP, its explicit form is sensitively dependent on the many-body perturbation. Finally, we discuss the steady-state approaching dynamic which can serve as detectable signals for the higher-order Liouvillian EPs.

Van Hove singularities (VHSs) amplify electronic correlations, providing a crucial platform for discovering novel quantum phase transitions. Here, we show that VHSs in multi-orbital systems can stabilize a variety of competing $\bm{Q}=0$ magnetic orders, including intrinsic altermagnetism emerging from spontaneous orbital antiferromagnetism. This intrinsic phase, in which antiparallel spins reside on distinct orbitals, is realized across all four 2D Bravais lattices. It is driven by orbital-resolved spin fluctuations enhanced by inter-orbital hopping and favors suppressed Hund's coupling $J_H$, strong inter-orbital hybridization, and filling near a VHS from quadratic band touching. Through Hubbard-$U$-$J_H$ phase diagrams we map several magnetic phase transitions: (i) ferrimagnet to $d$-wave extrinsic altermagnet, (ii) $d$-wave intrinsic altermagnet to ferromagnet, and (iii) $g$-wave extrinsic altermagnet to either $d$-wave extrinsic altermagnet or ferromagnet. Our work identifies VHSs as a generic route to altermagnetism in correlated materials.

### Gradient-expansion of the inhomogeneous electron-gas revisited

In the present work, we revisit the problem of the inhomogeneous electron gas under the influence of a weak external potential, which allows us to calculate the gradient corrections to the density functional within linear response, an approach known as the gradient expansion approximation. To obtain the exchange ($b_x$) and correlation ($b_{c}$) contributions to the coefficient $b_{xc}$, i.e., to the prefactor of the $q^2$ term of the proper-polarization function, we revisited all the previous calculations and expose misconceptions which led to incorrect conclusions. We used various ways to apply a necessary regularization to the singular Coulomb interaction potential. We found that the separate exchange ($b_x$) and correlation ($b_c$) contributions to the coefficient $b_{xc}$ have regularization-scheme dependent values even though the regulator is set to zero at the end of the calculation. This implies that it is impossible to define such a separation meaningfully. On the contrary, we found that when the regulator is set to zero at the end of the calculation, the combination $b_{xc}$ is regularization-scheme independent and, thus, has a unique value. We conclude that it is incorrect to separate those two terms when constructing a generalized-gradient-approximation (GGA) contribution to the density functional. This appears to be a common approach in most popular GGA functionals, where various constraints are applied to each contribution separately.

- **TL;DR**: 石墨烯涂层可显著降低α-Al2O3(0001)表面的氮气切向动量适应系数，从而减少稀薄大气环境中的气动阻力，效果在高温下增强且对实验相关缺陷密度保持稳定。

In rarefied atmospheric environments, where continuum fluid dynamics breaks down, aerodynamic drag is governed by gas-surface momentum exchange, making surface structure and chemistry key design knobs. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we show that coating the $α$-Al2O3(0001) surface with graphene markedly reduces the tangential momentum accommodation coefficient (TMAC) of N2, shifting scattering toward more specular reflection and thereby lowering drag; we further benchmark this response against graphite. The reduction strengthens up to 900 K. While structural defects can increase TMAC via defect-induced corrugation and local atomic and electronic rearrangements, graphene retains its performance at experimentally relevant defect densities.

Unraveling the interplay between density-wave (DW) instabilities and multi-orbital physics is critical for understanding superconductivity in Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates, yet intrinsic electronic features have been persistently obscured by material inhomogeneity and thus the multi-domain averaging effect. Here, we employ micro-focused angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy ($μ$-ARPES) on single-domain Pr$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ to disentangle the complex hierarchy of intrinsic and back-folded bands, explicitly identifying the electronic states driving the DW phase transition. We provide decisive spectroscopic evidence that the low-energy reconstruction is governed by inter-orbital nesting between the $α$ and $β$ bands. Specifically, we resolve a orbital-dependent gap of $\sim44$ meV on the $α$ pocket, a value quantitatively consistent with prior measurements, unifying previously conflicting experimental reports regarding the locus and magnitude of the DW gap. Furthermore, we reveal strong orbital-selective mass renormalization in the $d_{z^2}$ states and successfully resolve the long-sought intrinsic trilayer $β$-band splitting, establishing a critical lower bound for the outer-layer hopping. These results define a coherent microscopic fingerprint for the trilayer nickelates, identifying the specific nesting channels and correlation effects that underpin the phase diagram.

Phase transitions occur when a macroscopic number of local degrees of freedom coherently change their behavior. In ground states of quantum many-body systems, phase transitions due to quantum fluctuations are observed as non-analytic behaviors of order parameters, such as magnetization, as functions of a conjugate parameter, such as the magnetic field. However, as soon as thermal fluctuations are present, these effects are believed to disappear for local observables. We show that this is not necessarily the case: order parameters may still show non-analytic behaviors within their dynamics. With the example of the Ising model and using methods based on hydrodynamic fluctuations, we evaluate the exact order-parameter correlation time, in space-time directions of all velocities, in equilibrium states at nonzero temperature. We reveal non-analytic behaviors of spin correlation times as functions of the magnetic field, velocity, and temperature. As a function of the magnetic field, they occur at values that continuously approach that of the zero-temperature equilibrium transition point as the velocity is decreased and reach it within the light cone, where we obtain a new, temperature-independent logarithmic divergence characterizing the collective dynamics. Thus, collective effects induced by quantum fluctuations persist within the dynamics of local observables.

Quantum geometry plays a fundamental role across many branches of modern physics, yet its full characterization in nonequilibrium systems remains a challenge. Here, we propose a framework for quantum geometry in Floquet topological insulators by introducing a time-resolved quantum metric tensor, defined via the trace distance between micromotion operators in momentum-time space. For class A in two spatial dimensions, we find a general inequality linking the Floquet quantum metric tensor and the Floquet topology: the associated quantum volume is bounded below by the Floquet topological invariant. This relation is found to also hold in class AIII in one dimension, where the Floquet geometric tensor may be notably reduced due to time-reflection symmetry. This work will be useful in digesting the general aspects of quantum geometry in periodically driven systems in connection with their topological characterization.

"Addition-by-subtraction" coupled cluster (CC) approaches provide a promising approach to treating the difficult strong correlation problem by simplifying the standard CC equations. In a separate vein, linearized CC methods have drawn interest for their lower computational cost, increased parallelizability, and favorable properties for extension to the excited state--but the inclusion of ring/crossed-ring terms causes singularities even for single bond breaking. A linearized, addition-by-subtraction CC method called linearized ladder CCD (linLCCD) removes these terms to avoid divergences, but linLCCD under-estimates dynamical correlation. Herein we resolve this deficiency of linLCCD by introducing a linearized external coupled cluster perturbation theory that adds a second-order ring/crossed-ring correction back into a linLCCD reference wave function. Our resultant xlinCCD(2) method is regular and yields comparable results to linearized CCD in weakly-correlated regimes.

This work demonstrates that the convex hull of formation energies for solid compounds involving elements from hydrogen to uranium admits a remarkably simple description over the 92-dimensional space of chemical compositions, despite the enormous combinatorial complexity of possible atomic structures. By training an interpretable max-affine model directly on near-hull formation energies from the Materials Project density-functional theory (DFT) database, we find that the hull can be reconstructed to DFT accuracy using a polyhedron with only seven facets. These facets define seven chemically coherent materials classes, with just seven coefficients per element sufficing to capture the dominant energetic trends across composition space. Remarkably, this compact, composition-only representation generalizes far beyond bulk formation energies. Without retraining or structural input, the same model reproduces trends in DFT-calculated defect formation energies, captures experimentally observed elemental mixing correlations in high-entropy materials, and enables the construction and optimization of Pourbaix diagrams for electrochemical stability. Together, these results show that many materials properties governed by energy differences can be expressed as simple linear combinations of a small set of interpretable, element-specific parameters. The result is a bonding-geometry-free thermodynamic framework that unifies stability, defects, mixing, and electrochemistry, and enables rapid, interpretable screening across vast chemical spaces.

Langevin integrators based on operator splitting are widely used in molecular dynamics. This work examines Langevin splitting schemes from the perspective of their internal trajectories and observation points, complementing existing generator-based analyses. By exploiting merging, splitting, and cyclic permutation of elementary update operators, formally distinct schemes can be grouped according to identical or closely related trajectories. Accuracy differences arising from momentum updates and observation points are quantified for configurational sampling, free-energy estimates, and transition rates. While modern Langevin integrators are remarkably stable under standard simulation conditions, subtle but systematic biases emerge at large friction coefficients and time steps. These results clarify when accuracy differences between splitting schemes matter in practice and provide an intuitive framework for understanding observation effects.

Resolving where the density-wave gap opens in momentum space is essential for identifying the microscopic origin of the instability in layered nickelates. Using polarization-resolved electronic Raman scattering, we map the momentum selectivity of the spin-density-wave (SDW) gap in trilayer La4Ni3O10. We observe a SDW-induced redistribution of spectral weight on both the $α$ pocket at the Brillouin-zone centre and a portion of the $β$ pocket near the zone boundary, characterized by gap energies of approximately 55~meV. In contrast, no comparable spectral weight suppression is observed along the diagonal region of $β$ pockets, implying little or no gap opening. This gap topology contrasts sharply with that in La3Ni2O7, where anisotropic SDW gaps open solely on the $β$ pocket. Our results establish a distinct momentum-space gap topology between bilayer and trilayer nickelates, placing new constraints on the ordering wave vector and the mechanism of the density-wave instability relevant to superconductivity.

We derive a universal relation for the critical temperatures of the $q$-state Potts model based on the counting of domain-wall microstates. By balancing interface energy against configurational entropy, we show that the critical temperature is determined by the ratio of the coordination-dependent energy cost to the logarithm of a total multiplicity factor. This factor decomposes into a lattice-topological constant, representing a projection from an underlying orthogonal Euclidean space, and a term representing Markovian sampling in the $q$-dimensional state space. The framework recovers exact solutions for two-dimensional square, triangular, and honeycomb lattices and achieves sub-3\% accuracy for three-dimensional simple cubic, bcc, fcc, and diamond geometries. This approach unifies the Potts universality class into a single geometric classification, revealing that the phase transition is governed by the saturation of interface propagation through the lattice manifold and providing a predictive tool that characterizes the entire $q$-state family from a single topological calibration.

We investigate the transport properties of a triangular triple quantum dot (TTQD) system connected with two reservoirs under linear response regime. By employing the hierarchical equations of motion(HEOM), we compute the thermopower and thermoelectric figure of merit. The impact of interaction scheme among three quantum dots on the thermopower is thoroughly analyzed, while the thermoelectric current and spectral function throughout this process are also elaborated. Our results reveal that, under low-temperature conditions, the alleviation of the geometric blockade in the TTQD system leads to a significantly faster enhancement of the heat current compared to the electric current. This phenomenon consequently elevates the thermopower, resulting in a remarkably high thermoelectric figure of merit.

Collective excitations of Fractional Quantum Hall (FQH) liquids at long wavelengths are thought to be of a generally covariant geometric nature, governed by area-preserving diffeomorphisms ($\mathrm{SDiff}$). But current analyses rely solely on the corresponding perturbative $w_\infty$ Lie algebra. We argue this is insufficient: We identify a non-perturbative construction of the effective Maxwell-Chern-Simons quantum field theory which carries unitary $\mathrm{SDiff}$ equivariance. But this turns out to be non-differentiable, suggesting FQH excitation phenomenology beyond the $w_\infty$ algebra.

- **TL;DR**: 提出FluxNet框架，通过学习局部传输算子而非直接预测下一状态，保证离散守恒和状态边界约束，提升数据驱动PDE仿真的稳定性和物理一致性。

Autoregressive learning of time-stepping operators offers an effective approach to data-driven PDE simulation on grids. For conservation laws, however, long-horizon rollouts are often destabilized when learned updates violate global conservation and, in many applications, additional state bounds such as nonnegative mass and densities or concentrations constrained to [0,1]. Enforcing these coupled constraints via direct next-state regression remains difficult. We introduce a framework for learning conservative transport operators on regular grids, inspired by lattice Boltzmann-style discrete-velocity transport representations. Instead of predicting the next state, the model outputs local transport operators that update cells through neighborhood exchanges, guaranteeing discrete conservation by construction. For bounded quantities, we parameterize transport within a capacity-constrained feasible set, enforcing bounds structurally rather than by post-hoc clipping. We validate FluxNet on 1D convection-diffusion, 2D shallow water equations, 1D traffic flow, and 2D spinodal decomposition. Experiments on shallow-water equations and traffic flow show improved rollout stability and physical consistency over strong baselines. On phase-field spinodal decomposition, the method enables large time-steps with long-range transport, accelerating simulation while preserving microstructure evolution in both pointwise and statistical measures.

The coherence of superconductivity and its suppression near a quantum phase transition is governed by the interplay between local pairing and macroscopic phase coherence. Using scanning SQUID, we image the local susceptibility in a hybrid Josephson junction array. On a square lattice of narrow islands, we simultaneously access both the amplitude and spatial phase structure of sensitive superconducting states. We observe periodic phase patterns at commensurate magnetic fillings. At zero field the long-range phase coherence is strongest. At a finite field, smaller than one percent of flux quantum per unit cell, the system fragments into large regions of constant superconducting phase, as a function of the applied field. Our results provide the first direct measurement of long-range phase coherence in a Josephson junction array.

We provide a local probabilistic description of the limiting statistics of large preferential attachment trees in terms of the ordinary degree (number of neighbors) but augmented with information on leafdegree (number of neighbors that are leaves). The full description is the joint degree-leafdegree distribution $n_{k,\ell}$, which we derive from its associated multivariate generating function. From $n_{k,\ell}$ we obtain the leafdegree distribution, $m_{\ell}$, as well as the fraction of vertices that are protected (nonleaves with leafdegree zero) as a function of degree, $n_{k,0}$, among numerous other results. We also examine fluctuations and concentration of joint degree-leafdegree empirical counts $N_{k,\ell}$. Although our main findings pertain to the preferential attachment tree, the approach we present is highly generalizable and can characterize numerous existing models, in addition to facilitating the development of tractable new models. We further demonstrate the approach by analyzing $n_{k,\ell}$ in two other models: the random recursive tree, and a redirection-based model.

This dissertation explores various nonlinear responses that arise from the rich interplay between quantum geometry, disorder, magnetism and topology in quantum materials. In addition to presenting generalizations of quantum kinetic theory, Kubo formulas and semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory to the nonlinear response regime, we discuss several predictions of novel transport effects and physical insights that emerge from these developments.

- **TL;DR**: 通过热膨胀和热容研究Li2FeSiO4单晶，发现其在磁有序温度附近表现出从2D Ising行为到3D Ising行为的交叉转变，证实了该材料是准二维磁性体系。

We report thermal expansion and heat capacity studies on Li$_2$FeSiO$_4$ single crystals which enable us to investigate the critical behavior in the magnetically quasi-two-dimensional (2D) material. Pronounced $λ$-shaped anomalies at the magnetic ordering temperature $T_{\rm N}$ imply significant magneto-elastic coupling. Our analysis of both the thermal expansion and the specific heat data implies the crossover from 2D Ising-like behavior for $|(T-T_{\rm N})/T_{\rm N}|&gt;0.3$ to 3D Ising behavior \rev{below $\simeq 1.3\times T_{\rm N}$. The 2D-like behavior is further supported by density functional calculations which show minimal dispersion perpendicular to the crystallographic $ac$ planes of the layered structure, thereby indicating the 2D nature of magnetism at higher temperatures.} Our results extend the available model materials of quasi-2D magnetism to a high-spin $S=2$ system with tetrahedrally coordinated Fe$^{2+}$-ions, thereby illustrating how magnetic order evolves in a 2D Ising-like system with orbital degrees of freedom.

We present two new interatomic potentials for platinum (Pt) in angular-dependent potential (ADP) and modified Tersoff (MT) formats. Both potentials have been trained on a reference database of first-principles calculations without using experimental data. The properties of Pt predicted by the ADP and MT potentials agree better with DFT calculations and experimental data than the potentials available in the literature. Future applications of the MT model to mixed-bonding metal-covalent systems are discussed.

A distinctive identifier of nodal intrinsic topological superconductivity (ITS) would the appearance of an Andreev bound state on crystal surfaces parallel to the nodal axis, in the form of a topological quasiparticle surface band (QSB) appearing only for $T &lt; T_C$. Moreover, theory shows that specific QSB characteristics observable in tunneling to an s-wave superconductor can distinguish between chiral and non-chiral ITS order parameter $Δ_k$. To search for such phenomena in $\text{UTe}_2$, s-wave superconductive scan-tip scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) imaging was employed. It reveals an intense zero-energy Andreev conductance maximum at the $\text{UTe}_2$ (0-11) crystal termination. Development of the zero-energy Andreev conductance peak into two finite-energy particle-hole symmetric conductance maxima as the tunnel barrier is reduced, then signifies that $\text{UTe}_2$ superconductivity is non-chiral. Quasiparticle interference imaging (QPI) for an ITS material should be dominated by the QSB for energies within the superconductive energy gap $|E| \le Δ$, so that bulk $Δ(k)$ characteristics of the ITS can only be detected excursively. Again using a superconducting scan-tip, the in-gap quasiparticle interference patterns of the QSB of $\text{UTe}_2$ were visualized. Specifically, a band of Bogoliubov quasiparticles appears as a characteristic sextet $q_i$ :$i = 1-6$ of interference wavevectors showing that QSB dispersions $k(E)$ occur only for energies $|E| \le Δ_{max}$ and only within the range of Fermi momenta projected onto the (0-11) crystal surface. In combination, these phenomena are consistent with a bulk $Δ(k)$ exhibiting spin triplet, time-reversal conserving, odd-parity, a-axis nodal, $B_{3u}$ symmetry in $\text{UTe}_2$.

Topological classifications of quantum critical systems have recently attracted growing interest, as they go beyond the traditional paradigms of condensed matter and statistical physics. However, such classifications remain largely unexplored at critical points in aperiodic environments, particularly under quasiperiodic modulations. In this Letter, we uncover a novel class of topological quasiperiodic fixed points that are intermediate between the clean and infinite-randomness limits. By exactly solving the quasiperiodic cluster-Ising chain, we unambiguously demonstrate that all phase boundaries separating quasiperiodically modulated phases are governed by a new family of topological Ising-like fixed points unique to strongly modulated quasiperiodic systems: Despite exhibiting indistinguishable bulk critical properties, these fixed points host robust topological edge degeneracies and are therefore topologically distinct from previously recognized quasiperiodic universality classes, as further supported by complementary lattice simulations.

- **TL;DR**: 开发了一个统一的Python框架，包含三个交互式GUI，用于纳米流体系统的测量和分析，提高实验效率和可重复性。

Nanofluidic systems exploit nanometre-scale confinement in channels and pores to regulate ionic transport, enabling functionalities such as osmotic energy harvesting and neuromorphic ionic memory. Studying such confined transport requires both precise electrical instrumentation and careful data analysis, yet, in practice, measurements are still often taken with vendor software, exported as files, and processed later in separate environments. In this work, we bring these steps together in a unified Python-based framework built around three interoperable graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for nanochannel, nanopore and memristor experiments. The framework is organised into two functional parts, measurement and analysis. On the measurement side, two GUIs drive Keithley Source Meters to run continuous voltage sweeps and user-defined memristive pulse sequences, while providing live plots, configuration management and controlled shutdown routines. On the analysis side, a dedicated nanochannel and nanopore GUI reads raw I-V datasets, applies unit-consistent processing, extracts conductance and ion mobility, evaluates selectivity and osmotic power, and is complemented by a web-based calculator that performs the same mobility analysis without a local Python installation. All three GUIs are implemented in Python/Tkinter with modular plotting and logging layers so that flexible control sequences and physics-based post-processing share a common data format, improving reproducibility, timing stability and day-to-day efficiency in nanofluidic and electronic device studies.

- **TL;DR**: 通过高分辨率电子能量损失谱研究Bi-2212铜氧化物，发现其电荷激发在低动量下为高度阻尼的等离子体激元，在高动量下演化为非相干连续谱，支持Bi-2212为具有强阻尼电荷激发的非相干金属观点。

The strange metal remains one of the great unsolved problems for 21st century science. Since the early development of the marginal Fermi liquid phenomenology, it has been clear that progress requires detailed knowledge of the momentum- and frequency-dependent charge susceptibility, $χ(\mathbf{q},ω)$, particularly at large momenta. Electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS), performed in either reflection or transmission geometry, provides the most direct probe of $χ(\mathbf{q},ω)$. However, measurements over the past four decades have yielded conflicting results, with some studies reporting a dispersing RPA-like plasmon and others observing a strongly overdamped, incoherent response. Here we report a transmission EELS study of Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ (Bi-2212) that simultaneously achieves high energy resolution ($ΔE \approx 30$ meV) and high momentum resolution ($Δq \approx 0.01$ Å$^{-1}$). To address issues of reproducibility, measurements were repeated ten times on five different Bi-2212 flakes, benchmarked against aluminum, a well-characterized Fermi liquid, and quantitatively compared with prior studies spanning four decades. At momenta $q &lt; 0.15$ Å$^{-1}$, we observe a highly damped plasmon whose linewidth is comparable to its energy. At larger momenta, $q &gt; 0.15$ Å$^{-1}$, this excitation does not disperse but instead evolves into an incoherent continuum, with no evidence for the RPA-like dispersion reported in some earlier works. Comparison with recent RIXS measurements on Bi-based cuprates supports the view that Bi-2212 is an incoherent metal with strongly damped charge excitations.

The geometry and binding energy of excitons, set by electron-hole wavefunction distributions, are fundamental factors that underpin their many-body interactions and determine optoelectronic properties of semiconductors. However, in typical solid-state systems, these quantities are fixed by material composition and structure. Here we introduce a polarizable interlayer exciton hosted in a two-dimensional tetralayer heterostructure whose dipole length, in-plane radius, and binding energy can be continuously programmed in situ over a wide range, enabling direct control over the nature of excitonic many-body phase transitions. An out-of-plane electric field redistributes layer-hybridized electron-hole wavefunctions, realizing in situ control of exciton geometry through a strong quadratic Stark response. This tunability further regulates the nature of interaction-driven Mott transition, transforming it from gradual to abrupt. Our results establish exciton geometry as a continuously tunable materials parameter, opening routes to exciton-based quantum phase-transition simulators and guiding the design of emergent optoelectronic functionalities from programmable excitonic materials.

### Superstable Geometry in Triadic Percolation

- **TL;DR**: 该论文提出了一种通过分析超稳定循环几何结构来探测局部非线性阶数的方法，将三元渗流转化为由一维单峰映射控制的动力学问题。

Triadic percolation turns bond percolation into a dynamical problem governed by an effective one-dimensional unimodal map. We show that the geometry of superstable cycles provides a direct, map-agnostic probe of local nonlinearity: specifically, the distance from the map's maximum to a distinguished next-to-maximum point on the attracting $2^n$-cycle (which coincides with a preimage of the maximum at $2^n$-superstability) scales as $|Δp|^γ$ with $γ= 1/z$, where $z$ is the nonflat order of the maximum. This prediction is verified across canonical unimodal families and heterogeneous triadic ensembles, with Lyapunov spectra corroborating the one-dimensional reduction. A derivative condition on the activation kernel fixes the local nonlinearity order $z$ (and thus, under standard unimodal-map hypotheses, the associated $z$-logistic universality class) and gives conditions under which $z&gt;2$ can be realized. The diagnostic operates directly on orbit data under standard regularity assumptions, providing a practical tool to classify universality in higher-order networks.

Electron gases in low dimensional materials exhibit unconventional transport and optical phenomena due to reduced phase space, enhanced interactions, and strong sensitivity to lattice symmetry. While commonly realized in quantum confined systems and engineered heterostructures, such states are rare in naturally occurring materials. Hyperbolic materials provide a compelling alternative, as extreme lattice anisotropy can host unconventional electronic states and novel electron-phonon interactions. Here, we investigate the angle resolved polarized Raman (ARPR) response of MoOCl2, the first naturally occurring hyperbolic material whose hyperbolicity originates from a highly anisotropic electron gas. We observe pronounced polarization dependent Fano line shapes, revealing coherent coupling between phonons and an anisotropic electronic continuum. We characterize the directional response of this continuum, incorporating it into effective Raman tensors that quantitatively reproduce the ARPR measurements and capture the distinct Raman fingerprint of MoOCl2. Excitation energy and thickness dependent ARPR measurements further demonstrate a tunable quasi 1D electronic continuum with weak interlayer coupling, establishing MoOCl2 as a model system for Raman studies of electron-phonon coupling in hyperbolic materials

We evaluate electromagnetic-response observables in a half-filled Chern band, across a topological phase transition between a composite Fermi liquid (CFL) and a Fermi liquid (FL) phase. While a sharp gapped plasma mode exists deep in the CFL phase, we demonstrate that it is damped near the proposed continuous phase transition between CFL and FL. This plasmon-damping phenomenon originates from emergent gauge fields and a Dirac-fermion-like spectrum. Similar features also occur in other continuous deconfined topological phase transitions, such as the Laughlin to superfluid transition in a bosonic system. In particular, this damping behavior extends over a finite range across the phase boundary, and, hence, we expect it to persist even when the transition is weakly first-order. Furthermore, we analyze the behavior of the Drude weight, the wavevector-dependent conductivity, and the chiral mirror effect across these topological phase transitions.

Bimetallic catalysts provide new routes toward sustainable ammonia synthesis, but the structural dynamics controlling their performance under real-world conditions remain poorly understood. Here, we combine in situ gas-cell and multimodal electron microscopy to disentangle the temperature-, pressure-, and chemistry-dependent restructuring of AuRu catalysts, revealing pathways accessible only at atmospheric pressure. As synthesized, AuRu nanocatalysts are polycrystalline face-centered-cubic alloys with Au/Ru intermixing that phase-segregate into Au- and Ru-rich domains with elevated temperature (&gt;450 °C). Increased pressure (~1 atm in 3:1, hydrogen:nitrogen) unlocks pronounced faceting and internal nanovoid formation, which systematic gas-chemistry variation identifies as hydrogen-driven. Density functional theory-based interatomic potentials show that hydrogen can amplify Au/Ru diffusion asymmetry, promoting nanovoid formation via a gas-mediated Kirkendall mechanism. Together, these results bridge the pressure gap between traditional in situ electron microscopy and benchtop ammonia reactors, enabling resolution of distinct restructuring stimuli in multicomponent systems.

### Quantum Metric Length as a Fundamental Length Scale in Disordered Flat Band Materials

Our previous understanding of electronic transport in disordered systems was based on the assumption that there is a finite Fermi velocity for the relevant electrons. The Fermi velocity determines important length scales in disordered systems such as the diffusion length and the localization length. However, in disordered systems with vanishing or nearly vanishing Fermi velocity, it is uncertain what determines the important length scales in such systems. In this work, we use the 1D Lieb lattice with isolated flat bands as an example to show that the quantum metric length (QML) is a fundamental length scale in the ballistic, diffusive and localization regimes. The QML is defined through the Bloch state wave functions of the flat bands. In the ballistic regime with short junctions, the QML controls the finite energy transport properties. In the localization regime with long junctions, the localization length is determined by the QML and remarkably, independent of disorder strength over a wide range of disorder strength. We call this unconventional localization regime, the quantum metric localization regime. In the diffusive regime, we demonstrate that the diffusion coefficient is linearly proportional to the QML via the wave-packet dynamics numerically. Importantly, the numerical results are consistent with the analytical results obtained through the Bethe-Salpeter equation. We conclude that the QML is a fundamentally important length scale governing the properties of disordered flat band materials.

Dynamical correlations of quantum many-body systems are typically analyzed in the momentum space and frequency basis. However, quantum simulators operate more naturally in real space, real time settings. Here we analyze the real-space time-dependent van Hove spin correlations $G(r,t)$ of the 2D triangular antiferromagnet KYbSe$_2$ as obtained from high-resolution Fourier-transformed neutron spectroscopy. We compare this to $G(r,t)$ from five theoretical simulations of the well-established spin Hamiltonian. Our analysis reveals non-linear sub-ballistic low-temperature transport in KYbSe$_2$ which none of the current state-of-the-art numerical or field-theoretical methods reproduce. Our observation signals an emergent collective hydrodynamics, perhaps associated with the quantum critical phase of a quantum spin liquid, and provides an ideal benchmark for future quantum simulations.

Physical properties intermediate between constituents of alloys can be achieved as downward convex positive bowing, upward concave negative bowing, or zero bowing. Such bowing effects are essential for band gap engineering in semiconductor alloys. Upward band gap bowing effects are rather rare, hindering the exploration on half of the available physical property space of alloys. Part of the this being a rare event is related to the need to stabilize an alloy with low mixing enthalpy, so it does not phase separate. In this paper we find via density functional theory that one can satisfy the simultaneous conditions of negative mixing enthalpy and upward band gap bowing in four-component ABX3 halide perovskite alloys in the cubic perovskite structure. Such perovskite alloys have the B-site occupied by a mixture of group IVB and IIB elements that have the IVB-s and IIB-s states in the valence bands and conduction bands, respectively, leaving the delocalized s states strongly repel each other. This s-s repulsion leads to the upward band gap bowing and negative mixing enthalpies simultaneously. Remarkably, we identify a perovskite alloy that has a band gap much larger than all its components. Analogous trends of upward band gap bowing and negative mixing enthalpy also appear in the corresponding three-component and two-component ABX3 halide perovskite alloys. These observations of upward band gap bowing and negative mixing enthalpy will significantly accelerate the design of stable upward band gap bowing alloys in a broad range of material families.

Quantum geometry, encoded in the Berry curvature and quantum metric, has unified diverse anomalous transport phenomena in solids, yet a microscopic quantum-geometric theory of entropy transport for Bloch electrons is still lacking. We formulate an entropy continuity equation for noninteracting fermions driven by an electric field, starting from the von Neumann entropy, and obtain quantum-mechanical expressions for the entropy current density and entropy production rate. Introducing relaxation through a relaxation-time dissipator, we identify the quantum metric as the origin of the leading entropy production, providing a direct microscopic diagnostic of dissipation in both the extrinsic Drude response and an intrinsic nonlinear Ohmic contribution controlled by quantum metric. We further predict an entropy Hall effect arising from the Berry curvature and show that it obeys an Onsager reciprocal relation with the anomalous Nernst effect under a temperature gradient. Finally, we establish universal relations connecting entropy and charge currents under DC and AC driving, offering experimentally accessible probes of quantum geometry through nonequilibrium entropy flow.

Spin relaxometry using solid-state spin defects, such as the diamond nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center, probes dynamical processes by measuring how environmental fluctuations enhance the spin relaxation rate. In the weak-coupling limit, relaxation rates sample the transverse magnetic-noise power spectral density through a sensor-specific filter function, turning the defect into a local, frequency-selective noise spectrometer. This review bridges theory and experiment, clarifying how measured relaxation rates map onto noise spectra and how near-field geometry shapes the response. We highlight representative applications across condensed-matter physics, chemical and biological sensing, and relaxometry-based magnetic-resonance spectroscopy. We conclude with emerging opportunities and key challenges.

We derive an exact expression for the orbital magnetization of electrons with short-range interactions (such as density-density interactions) in terms of exact zero-frequency response functions of the zero-field system. The result applies to weakly and strongly correlated electrons at zero and finite temperature, provided that the local grand potential density only depends on local thermodynamic parameters. We benchmark the formula for non-interacting and weakly-coupled electrons. To zeroth and first orders in the interaction strength, it agrees with the modern theory of orbital magnetization and its recent generalization to self-consistent Hartree-Fock bands. Our work provides an exact framework of interacting orbital magnetization beyond mean-field treatments, and paves the way for quantitative studies of strongly correlated electrons in external magnetic fields.

We investigate the structural, mechanical, and thermoelectric properties of lead-free double halide perovskites Cs2TeX6 (X = Cl, Br, I) using first-principles calculations and semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory. The HSE06 band gap is incorporated using the scissor correction method along with PBE calculated electronic band structures including spin orbit coupling to accurately predict transport properties. The band gap values are 3.27, 2.50, and 1.55 eV for Cs2TeX6 (X = Cl, Br, I), respectively. The coexistence of heavy and light bands in the Cs2TeI6 band structure helps mitigate the trade-off between the Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity. Among these systems, Cs2TeI6 exhibits superior performance with a ZT of 1.97 at 800 K and an electronic concentration of 3.35 x 10^19 cm^-3. Such a high ZT at relatively low carrier concentration arises from high electrical conductivity combined with low lattice thermal conductivity. The lattice thermal conductivity of Cs2TeI6 is found to be 0.41 W m^-1 K^-1 at room temperature. This low lattice thermal conductivity is attributed to weak Te-I bonding and non-uniform out-of-phase displacement of Cs atoms. The presence of local TeX6 units together with weak bonds strongly resists heat conduction, leading to significant suppression of lattice thermal conductivity. In particular, transverse acoustic phonons and optical phonons play a key role in limiting lattice thermal conductivity. These results identify Cs2TeI6 as a promising candidate for high performance thermoelectric applications.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文重新审视了曼德博对经济物理学的贡献，强调接受数据的顽固特征，将模型作为直觉工具而非真理证明，关注尺度、间歇性和极端性作为经济波动的本质纹理。

This text revisits the origins of econophysics through the figure of Benoît Mandelbrot, not as the father of fractals, but as the instigator of a distinctive scientific posture. The guiding thread is methodological: accept the stubborn features of the data and use models as instruments for intuition rather than as axiomatic certificates of truth. In this perspective, scaling, intermittency and extremes are not peripheral imperfections around a well-behaved equilibrium; they are the very texture of economic and financial fluctuations. This naturally shifts attention from exogenous narratives to endogenous dynamics: interactions, feedback loops, and collective amplification mechanisms that can make systems intrinsically {\it fragile}. We argue that the importation of concepts from statistical physics -- criticality, disorder, emergence, multiplicative cascades -- should be read not as an artificial transposition but as a candid attempt to look for generic mechanisms compatible with empirical regularities observed across scales, from markets to macroeconomic aggregates.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究利用玻色子BdG系统的量子特性实现非厄米性，提出了一种无需耗散的稳态皮肤效应，在量子凝聚态系统中实现了非厄米皮肤效应。

Non-Hermitian systems have attracted significant theoretical interest due to their extreme properties. However, realizations have mostly been limited to classical applications or artificial setups. In this study, we focus on the quantum nature inherent in bosonic Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) systems, which from the perspective of spectral theory corresponds to non-Hermiticity. Based on this insight, we propose a steady-state skin effect in quantum condensed matter utilizing such BdG non-Hermiticity. Specifically, we introduce BdG quantum terms arising from parametric pumping to the edge states of an underlying bosonic Hermitian Chern insulator, thereby realizing non-Hermiticity without dissipation. This system design has the advantage of being largely independent of microscopic model details. Through analysis using non-equilibrium Green's functions, we find that under open boundary conditions, a steady state exhibiting the non-Hermitian skin effect is realized. The pronounced corner particle accumulation observed in this steady state shows quadrature anisotropy, which manifests the bosonic quantum nature. Our results bridge the gap between the fascinating mathematics of non-Hermitian matrices and practical quantum physical systems.

Understanding structure-property relationships in complex materials requires integrating complementary measurements across multiple length scales. Here we propose an interpretable "multimodal" machine learning framework that unifies heterogeneous analytical systems for end-to-end characterization, demonstrated on carbon nanotube (CNT) films whose properties are highly sensitive to microstructural variations. Quantitative morphology descriptors are extracted from SEM images via binarization, skeletonization, and network analysis, capturing curvature, orientation, intersection density, and void geometry. These SEM-derived features are fused with Raman indicators of crystallinity/defect states, specific surface area from gas adsorption, and electrical surface resistivity. Multi-dimensional visualization using radar plots and UMAP reveals clear clustering of CNT films according to crystallinity and entanglements. Regression models trained on the multimodal feature set show that nonlinear approaches, particularly XGBoost, achieve the best predictive accuracy under leave-one-out cross-validation. Feature-importance analysis further provides physically meaningful interpretations: surface resistivity is primarily governed by junction-to-junction transport length scales, crystallinity/defect-related metrics, and network connectivity, whereas specific surface area is dominated by intersection density and void size. The proposed multimodal machine learning framework offers a general strategy for data-driven, explainable characterization of complex materials.

### Renewal theory for a run-and-tumble particle with stochastic resetting and a sticky boundary

We consider a run-and-tumble particle (RTP) with stochastic resetting confined to the half line $[0,\infty)$ with a sticky boundary at $x=0$. In the bulk the RTP tumbles at a constant rate $α&gt;0$ between velocity states $\pm v$ with $v&gt;0$ and randomly resets to its initial position and orientation $(x_0,k_0)\in(\mathbb{R}^+,\pm)$. When the RTP reaches the target at $x=0$ it attaches to the boundary for a random waiting time before either detaching and continuing to navigate the bulk domain or (permanently) entering the target. These events are the analogs of adsorption, desorption, and absorption of a particle by a partially reactive surface in physical chemistry. We use renewal theory to characterize the particle trajectory in terms of successive binding events under two distinct desorption protocols: via resetting to $(x_0,k_0)$ and via continuous movement from $x=0$ with velocity $+v$. First we derive the nonequilibrum stationary state (NESS) in the case of no absorption and characterize the accumulation at the boundary. Second, we compute the mean first passage time (MFPT) statistics. In addition to observing the usual unimodal dependence of the MFPT on bulk resetting, both the NESS and MFPT strongly depend on the initial orientation $k_0$ and the desorption protocol. For instance, if the initial orientation is toward the boundary, we find that the desorption-induced resetting protocol can reduce the MFPT more effectively than the non-resetting desorption protocol. We also show how matching the desorption kinetics with the bulk resetting or tumbling rate introduces a trade-off between minimizing the adsorption and absorption times. In this setting we find that the desorption protocol which minimizes the absorption MFPT for a given set of parameters is almost always the opposite of that favored when desorption and bulk kinetics are not the same.

The band complex formed by multiple topological states has attracted extensive attention for the emergent properties produced by the interplay among the constituent states. Here, based on group theory analysis, we present a scheme for rapidly identifying the Weyl-Dirac nodal lines (a complex of Weyl and Dirac nodal lines) in bosonic systems. We find only 5 of the 230 space groups host Weyl-Dirac nodal line phonons. Notably, the Dirac nodal line resides along the high-symmetry line, whereas the Weyl nodal line is distributed on the high-symmetry plane and is interconnected with the Dirac nodal line, jointly forming a composite nodal network structure. Unlike traditional nodal nets, this nodal network exhibits markedly distinct surface states on different surfaces, which can be attributed to the fundamental differences in the topological properties between the Weyl and Dirac nodal lines. This unique property thus allows the material to present distinct surface states in a termination-selective manner. Furthermore, by first-principles calculations, we identify the materials NdRhO$_{3}$ and ZnSe$_{2}$O$_{5}$ as candidate examples to elaborate the Weyl-Dirac nodal line and their related topological features. Our work provides an insight for exploring and leveraging topological properties in systems with coexisting multiple topological states.

Collective electronic excitations, including plasmons, excitons, and intra- and interband transitions, play a central role in determining the dynamic screening, optical response, and energy transport properties of materials. Recent advances in momentum- and frequency-resolved spectroscopies, such as electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) and inelastic x-ray scattering (IXS), together with progress in first-principles many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) calculations, now allow collective excitations to be mapped with considerable precision across the Brillouin zone. This topical review surveys current developments in the representation and interpretation of both experimental and theoretical dielectric-response spectra. Particular emphasis is placed on recent ways of representing spectral band structures (SBS) of the direct and inverse dielectric functions, such as analytical approaches based on multipole-Padé approximants in momentum and frequency (MPA($\q$)), which provide a combined band-like description of the dispersion of the main collective excitations. We discuss how features observed in metals, semiconductors, and low dimensional systems reflect the interplay between electronic structure, screening strength, and local-field effects, and how post-processing procedures can improve the quantitative comparison between experiment and theory. Finally, we provide perspectives on open challenges and potential developments in quantitative dielectric-function analyses.

- **TL;DR**: 提出基于层次聚类生长过程的计算方法，高效求解自旋-3/2 Ising模型，避免了指数复杂度，成功应用于蜂窝晶格上的铁磁模型，再现了实验观测的关键特征。

We propose a computational methodology based on a hierarchical cluster growth process to solve spin-3/2 Ising models efficiently. The method circumvents the exponential complexity (\(4^{N}\)) of the canonical ensemble partition function by iteratively constructing finite magnetic clusters of size \(N_g\), where the effective spin state of a site in generation \(g+1\) is determined by the local magnetization of a cluster from generation \(g\). This approach, which shares conceptual ground with effective field theories, allows the study of systems of effectively very large size \(N = N_0 (N_g)^{g}\). We apply the formalism to the ferromagnetic spin-3/2 Ising model on a honeycomb lattice, modeling the monolayer CrI$_3$, a prototypical two-dimensional Ising magnet. The model, calibrated using the experimental transition temperature (\(T_{c} \simeq 45\) K), successfully reproduces key experimental features: the temperature dependence of the magnetization \(m(T)\), including its inflection point, and the broadened peak in the specific heat \(c_v(T)\). We also compute the entropy \(s(T)\), finding a finite residual value at low temperatures consistent with the system's double degeneracy. Our results demonstrate that this hierarchical cluster method provides a quantitatively accurate and computationally efficient framework for studying complex magnetic systems.

We study spin-resolved transport in a ballistic quantum dot with Rashba spin-orbit coupling, focusing on charge-to-spin conversion and spin Hall effect. In the regime where the dot size is comparable to the Fermi wavelength, we identify a clear crossover from weak localization to weak antilocalization as the Rashba coupling increases. This transition is accompanied by gate-tunable spin currents of Edelstein and spin Hall type, whose behavior reflects the underlying electron wavefunction interference. Notably, the Edelstein current shows an inflection point at the critical Rashba strength, signaling the crossover from weak localization to weak antilocalization. In the presence of an in-plane magnetic field we also report a transition in angular periodicity of the magnetoresistance -- from $π$ to $2π$ -- arising from the interplay between spin-orbit interaction and Zeeman coupling. These results establish a direct link between quantum coherence, charge-to-spin conversion, and geometric confinement in mesoscopic systems.

Incorporating Machine Learning (ML) into material property prediction has become a crucial step in accelerating materials discovery. A key challenge is the severe lack of training data, as many properties are too complicated to calculate with high-throughput first principles techniques. To address this, recent research has created experimental databases from information extracted from scientific literature. However, most existing experimental databases do not provide full atomic coordinate information, which prevents them from supporting advanced ML architectures such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). In this work, we propose to bridge this gap through an alignment process between experimental databases and Crystallographic Information Files (CIF) from the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD). Our approach enables the creation of a database that can fully leverage state-of-the-art model architectures for material property prediction. It also opens the door to utilizing transfer learning to improve prediction accuracy. To validate our approach, we align NEMAD with the ICSD and compare models trained on the resulting database to those trained on NEMAD originally. We demonstrate significant improvements in both Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Correct Classification Rate (CCR) in predicting the ordering temperatures and magnetic ground states of magnetic materials, respectively.

We introduce a one-dimensional non-Hermitian Kitaev chain with staggered imbalance in the $p$-wave superconducting pairing. By tuning the chemical potential and the pairing imbalance, we find that the eigenenergy spectrum undergoes real-to-complex transitions, and the spectral gap can change from a real to an imaginary line gap. The pairing imbalance significantly enlarges the parameter region supporting a topological superconducting phase. Remarkably, we show that a topologically nontrivial phase hosting Majorana zero modes can be induced by varying the pairing imbalance, even in the regime of strong chemical potential. The gap-closing points and phase boundaries are determined analytically, and the resulting phase diagrams are characterized by a nonzero topological invariant. Furthermore, we identify the existence of Majorana zero modes and finite-energy Majorana edge modes in this system. Our results reveal exotic phenomena arising from imbalanced pairing and establish a new platform for exploring topological superconductivity in non-Hermitian systems.

### Ferromagnetic Ferroelectricity due to Orbital Ordering

Realization of ferromagnetic ferroelectricity, combining two ferroic orders in a single phase, is the longstanding problem of great practical importance. One of the difficulties is that ferromagnetism alone cannot break inversion symmetry $\mathcal{I}$. Therefore, such a phase cannon be obtained by purely magnetic means. Here, we show how it can be designed by making orbital degrees of freedom active. The idea can be traced back to a basic principle of interatomic exchange, which states that an alternation of occupied orbitals along a bond (i.e., antiferro orbital order) favors ferromagnetic coupling. Moreover, the antiferro orbital order breaks $\mathcal{I}$, so that the bond becomes not simply ferromagnetic but also ferroelectric. Then, we formulate main principles governing the realization of such a state in solids, namely: (i) The magnetic atoms should not be located in inversion centers, as in the honeycomb lattice; (ii) The orbitals should be flexible enough to adjust they shape and minimize the energy of exchange interactions; (iii) This flexibility can be achieved by intraatomic interactions, which are responsible for Hund's second rule and compete with the crystal field splitting; (iv) For octahedrally coordinated transition-metal compounds, the most promising candidates appear to be iodides with a $d^{2}$ configuration and relatively weak $d$-$p$ hybridization. Such a situation is realized in the van der Walls compound VI$_3$, which we expect to be ferromagnetic ferroelectric.

Anti-Heusler alloys, being a new addition to the Heusler alloys family, exhibit atomic disorders, and almost all of them are reported as a re-entrant spin-glass system. Although such spin-glass feature is generally attributed to the inherent atomic disorder, a comprehensive and extensive investigation on the individual roles of different types of disorders in magnetic interactions remains lacking for any of the reported anti-Heusler systems. As an illustrative case, we have carried out an in-depth experimental as well as theoretical investigation of structural, magnetic, and transport properties of a polycrystalline anti-Heusler alloy, Al$_2$MnFe. While the major atomic disorder is found to be among Fe and Mn atoms, which are randomly distributed among the two octahedral sites, 4$a$ and 4$b$ (B2-type disorder), a relatively small fraction ($\sim$12\%) of Mn atoms also replace Al atoms at the tetrahedral 8$c$ site. Magnetically, the system undergoes two transitions: a paramagnetic to a ferromagnetic transition at $T_{\rm C}\sim$113~K, followed by a spin-glass phase transition below $T_{\rm f}\sim$20~K. Here, the magnetic moment is primarily confined to Mn atoms. Very interestingly, our theoretical analysis reveals that the ferromagnetic spin arrangement remains rather robust in spite of the 50\% disorder of moment-carrying Mn atoms between the two octahedral sites, but a much smaller ($\sim$12\%) cross-distribution of Mn atoms between octahedral and tetrahedral sites are sufficient to impose a reentrant spin-glass state at low temperature. Our analysis brings forth the importance of understanding the role of individual types of swap-disorder on magnetic properties in the anti-Heusler family of materials.

We present a fully atomistic approach to exciton-phonon coupling in semiconductor quantum dots that bridges microscopic electronic-structure calculations with non-Markovian open-quantum-system dynamics. On the example of an InAsP quantum dot embedded in an InP matrix, we compute single-particle states using an ab initio-parametrized tight-binding model, then obtain correlated many-body wave functions of neutral excitons, biexcitons, and charged trions via the configuration-interaction method. Using these correlated states, we compute the exciton-phonon coupling matrix elements. The resulting phonon spectral densities for different excitonic complexes are compared with the widely used analytical super-Ohmic form and reveal deviations at higher energies originating from the realistic dot geometry and atomistic wave functions, whereas configuration mixing is found to play only a minor role. Furthermore, we extract radiative lifetimes comparable to values experimentally measured. As a direct application, we simulate the emission brightness of a pulsed-driven quantum dot and demonstrate that the atomistically derived spectral density substantially broadens the region of efficient off-resonant excitation compared to the analytical model. The presented framework provides a nearly parameter-free route to simulate the non-Markovian open quantum dynamics in semiconductor quantum dots.

### Dynamic nuclear spin polarization in the fractional quantum Hall effect spin transitions

Experiments suggest that nuclear spins play a significant role in the quantum Hall effect (QHE) near integer and fractional QHE spin transitions, but many of these phenomena still remain to be understood. Here we study theoretically the dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) in the two-dimensional electron liquid near a quantum point contact (QPC) or a domain wall between spin polarized and unpolarized phases induced by electrostatic gating in the fractional QHE at a filling factor 2/3 and analyze the dependence of the spin transition on temperature and the magnitude of the flowing current. We demonstrate that nearly all nuclear spins in the QPC or in the domain wall can be polarized by the electric current. The Overhauser effective magnetic field from the DNP can be strong enough to induce (or modify) a phase transition between polarized and unpolarized phases. This changes the gate voltages and magnetic fields required for the spin transitions, and leads to the reconstruction of the boundary between two phases and a domain wall and a current path displacement. The spread of nuclear spin polarization and the domain wall displacement are strongly asymmetric with respect to the direction of the current flow. Equilibration due to hyperfine interactions and its role on the nuclear spin polarization, domain wall displacements and spin transitions is studied. Back and forth oscillatory transitions between polarized and unpolarized phases near a source contact are discussed. Hyperfine interactions of nuclear spins provide a route for observation and control of the parafermion zero modes that can be induced when the domain wall between the polarized and unpolarized regions is placed in the proximity of a superconductor

Machine learning (ML) can facilitate efficient thermoelectric (TE) material discovery essential to address the environmental crisis. However, ML models often suffer from poor experimental generalizability despite high metrics. This study presents a robust workflow, applied to the half-Heusler (hH) structural prototype, for figure of merit (zT) prediction, to improve the generalizability of ML models. To resolve challenges in dataset handling and feature filtering, we first introduce a rigorous PCA-based splitting method that ensures training and test sets are unbiased and representative of the full chemical space. We then integrate Bayesian hyperparameter optimization with k-best feature filtering across three architectures-Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks - while employing SISSO symbolic regression for physical insight and comparison. Using SHAP and SISSO analysis, we identify A-site dopant concentration (xA'), and A-site Heat of Vaporization (HVA) as the primary drivers of zT besides Temperature (T). Finally, a high-throughput screening of approximately 6.6x10^8 potential compositions, filtered by stability constraints, yielded several novel high-zT candidates. Breaking from the traditional focus of improving test RMSE/R^2 values of the models, this work shifts the attention on establishing the test set a true proxy for model generalizability and strengthening the often neglected modules of the existing ML workflows for the data-driven design of next-generation thermoelectric materials.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly emerging as a new paradigm of scientific discovery, namely data-driven science, across nearly all scientific disciplines. In materials science and engineering, AI has already begun to exert a transformative influence, making it both timely and necessary to examine its interaction with materials plasticity. In this study, we present a holistic survey of the convergence between AI and plasticity, highlighting state-of-the-art AI methodologies employed to discover, construct surrogate models for, and emulate the plastic behavior of materials. From a materials science perspective, we examine cause-and-effect relationships governing plastic deformation, including microstructural characterization and macroscopic responses described through plasticity constitutive models. From the perspective of AI methodology, we review a broad spectrum of applied approaches, ranging from frequentist techniques such as classical machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and physics-informed models to probabilistic frameworks that incorporate uncertainty quantification and generative AI methods. These data-driven approaches are discussed in the context of materials characterization and plasticity-related applications. The primary objective of this survey is to develop a comprehensive and well-organized taxonomy grounded in AI methodologies, with particular emphasis on distinguishing critical aspects of these techniques, including model architectures, data requirements, and predictive performance within the specific domain of materials plasticity. By doing so, this work aims to provide a clear road map for researchers and practitioners in the materials community, while offering deeper physical insight and intuition into the role of AI in advancing materials plasticity and characterization, an area of growing importance in the emerging AI-driven era.

The theory of inter-spin-subband electric dipole spin resonance in transition metal dichalcogenide heterobilayers is proposed. Our symmetry analysis demonstrates that, in contrast to monolayers, the reduced symmetry of heterobilayers enables coupling between conduction band spin subbands by an electric field. We establish the optical selection rules for all six high-symmetry stacking configurations. The microscopic mechanism of the effect is identified as the spin-orbit coupling induced mixing of Bloch states from different conduction bands, which generates a non-zero momentum matrix element between the spin-split states. It also leads to the linear-in-wavevector spin-dependent terms in the effective Hamiltonian, i.e., the Rashba effect. Our estimates show that the rate of electric-dipole spin-flip transitions exceeds by far that of the magnetic-dipole transitions in transition metal dichalcogenide heterobilayers.

- **TL;DR**: Ni2FeAl Heusler合金纳米颗粒具有高饱和磁化强度、大磁各向异性、高居里温度和中等磁熵变，是多种应用的潜在候选材料。

We present a comprehensive investigation of structural, magnetic and transport properties of Ni$_2$FeAl Heusler alloy nanoparticles (NPs) synthesized via template-less chemical route. The NPs exhibit high saturation magnetization of 3.02 $μ_ {\rm B}$/f.u. at 5~K, large magnetic anisotropy of 0.238 MJ/m$^3$, and a Curie temperature of 874~K. Magnetocaloric analysis reveals a magnetic entropy change of 3.1 J.kg$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ at 70 kOe. Low-temperature transport measurements show a weak resistivity upturn, following a $-T^{1/2}$ dependence, indicative of disorder-enhanced electron-electron interactions. First-principles calculations based on density functional theory yield a magneto-crystalline anisotropy energy of 0.987 MJ/m$^3$, consistent with experiment and demonstrate pronounced surface and finite-size effects through comparison of bulk and nanocluster geometries. The combination of high Curie temperature, sizable perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, and moderate spin polarization and magnetic entropy change make the Ni$_2$FeAl as promising candidate for various applications.

We examine nonlinear transport in a viscous two-dimensional electron fluid within narrow GaAs channels. The differential magnetoresistance shows nonmonotonic behavior, a signature of electron pairing in the hydrodynamic regime. Theoretical models that account for both the influence of these interactions on shear stress relaxation and viscosity changes from electron heating show good agreement with the data. The nonlinear regime thus reveals how such correlated states govern the hydrodynamic behavior of the electron fluid. Our findings establish the nonlinear transport regime as a powerful probe for dissecting the complex interplay of correlated electron states and momentum relaxation in the hydrodynamic flow of an electron fluid.

Mechanical and thermodynamic properties, including the influence of crystal defects, are critical for evaluating materials in engineering applications. Molecular dynamics simulations provide valuable insight into these mechanisms at the atomic scale. However, current practice often relies on fragmented scripts with inconsistent metadata and limited provenance, which hinders reproducibility, interoperability, and reuse. FAIR data principles and workflow-based approaches offer a path to address these limitations. We present reusable atomistic workflows that incorporate metadata annotation aligned with application ontologies, enabling automatic provenance capture and FAIR-compliant data outputs. The workflows cover key mechanical and thermodynamic quantities, including equation of state, elastic tensors, mechanical loading, thermal properties, defect formation energies, and nanoindentation. We demonstrate validation of structure-property relations such as the Hall-Petch effect and show that the workflows can be reused across different interatomic potentials and materials within a coherent semantic framework. The approach provides AI-ready simulation data, supports emerging agentic AI workflows, and establishes a generalizable blueprint for knowledge-based mechanical and thermodynamic simulations.

- **TL;DR**: 石墨烯参数振荡器在强非线性条件下通过非线性阻尼抑制振幅-频率噪声转换，实现了比杜芬振荡器更好的短期频率稳定性

High-frequency stability is crucial for the performance of graphene resonators in sensing and timekeeping applications. However, the extreme miniaturization and high mechanical compliance that make graphene attractive also render it highly susceptible to nonlinearities, degrading frequency stability. Here, we demonstrate that graphene parametric oscillators provide an alternative nonlinear operating regime, where short-term frequency stability can be enhanced despite strong nonlinearity. By operating graphene resonators in a phase-locked loop (PLL), we experimentally demonstrate that parametric oscillations in the post-bifurcation regime achieve lower Allan deviation at fast integration times than Duffing oscillations at identical amplitudes. This improvement originates from strong nonlinear damping inherent to parametric oscillators, which suppresses amplitude-to-frequency noise conversion at large amplitudes. A minimal theoretical model captures observed phase diffusion and identifies nonlinear damping as the dominant mechanism governing phase noise reduction. These results highlight the role of nonlinear dissipation in enabling precision sensing beyond conventional limits of graphene oscillators.

BaAl$_2$O$_4$ is a ferroelectric material that exhibits structural quantum criticality through chemical composition tuning. Although theoretical calculations and several diffraction experiments have suggested the involvement of a soft mode in its ferroelectric structural phase transition, direct experimental verification is still lacking. In this study, we successfully observed two soft modes of BaAl$_2$O$_4$ using x-ray inelastic scattering, providing direct experimental evidence for their role in the structural phase transition. Furthermore, we reveal that the soft modes at the M and K points are nearly degenerate in energy, indicating a delicate balance in which either mode could potentially freeze. The K-point mode simultaneously softens toward the transition temperature ($T_{\rm C}$) in a manner nearly identical to the M-point mode. However, the phase transition condenses only at the M point, with the M-point mode stabilizing as an acoustic mode in the low-temperature structure and the K-point mode hardening as temperature decreases.

Hybrid systems consisting of metal-fullerene composites exhibit intriguing properties but often suffer from thermal instability. With proper control, such instability can be harnessed to enable the formation of sophisticated nanostructures with nanometric precision. These self-organization phenomena are not limited to thermal stimulation alone but can also be triggered by other external stimuli. In this work, we investigate the morphological evolution of thin films composed of evaporated C60 and sputtered nickel mixtures, focusing on how external stimuli influence both their structural and electrical properties. Thin films were prepared under controlled deposition conditions, and their surface morphology was analyzed using advanced characterization techniques. Progressive changes in film morphology were observed as a function of composition and external treatment, highlighting the interplay between metallic and molecular components. In particular, it was observed that, due to the annealing treatment, the sample undergoes strong phase separation, with the formation of structures tens of microns in diameter and an increase in electrical resistance, exhibiting insulating behavior. These findings provide insights into the mechanisms governing hybrid thin film formation and suggest potential applications in electronic, optoelectronic, and energy-related devices.

- **TL;DR**: 通过设计多层膜中DMI符号的层间变化，使偶极场与DMI有效场平行排列，增强有效DMI，从而显著提升斯格明子的成核密度和稳定性

We demonstrate experimentally how the nucleation of skyrmions in an Ir, Co, and Pt based magnetic multilayer is affected by introducing a layer dependent sign for the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). In one stack, the bottom half of the stack is given a positive DMI and the top half a negative DMI, and as a result, the in-plane component of the dipolar field is aligned parallel to the effective field of the DMI in every layer, enhancing the effective DMI. We show that this enhanced DMI facilitates the nucleation and stability of skyrmions using both current-driven and laser-induced skyrmion nucleation. In the devices with an enhanced effective DMI, the density of nucleated skyrmions is greater by up to a factor 20 and skyrmions can be observed in stronger magnetic fields - suggesting that their stability is also improved. These results show that skyrmion nucleation depends strongly on the magnitude of the effective DMI in a magnetic multilayer and that the dipolar field within such a multilayer presents an effective route towards controlling the effective DMI, and thereby, the nucleation of chiral magnetic textures.

Machine learning enables rapid estimation of material parameters in solar cells via neural-network-based surrogate models. However, the reliability of extracted parameters depends on underlying assumptions such as the choice of one-dimensional drift-diffusion model and selection of free material parameters. To validate the inferred parameters, we perform predictive modeling of light-intensity-dependent current-voltage (JV) characteristics. Well-known physical effects, including the influence of external resistance and recombination dynamics on illumination-dependent device performance, are reflected in parameter estimation and prediction workflow. We show that correct treatment of dark shunt resistance and emphasizing shifted current (J + Jsc) during fitting enhances prediction accuracy at low to intermediate illumination level. Additionally, we analyze the information content of various input JV curve combinations, demonstrating that including at least one illuminated JV, preferably not under high illumination due to series resistance effects, is critical for reliable parameter estimation and device performance prediction.

Uranium dioxide has been widely used as a nuclear fuel in commercial light water reactors due to its high uranium density and chemical stability. However, its relatively low thermal conductivity is not optimal from the viewpoints of fuel integrity and safety margins, particularly during loss-of-coolant accidents. Although the development of accident-tolerant fuels with higher thermal conductivity is strongly desired, many potential uranium compounds remain unexplored due to constraints associated with handling radioactive materials. To efficiently screen promising uranium compounds with high thermal conductivity, past studies have leveraged machine-learning models to accelerate the discovery process. In this study, we experimentally examine the model's predictions by fabricating UCo and measuring its high-temperature thermophysical properties. Our results show that the thermal conductivity of UCo predicted by machine learning is in good agreement with the experimental measurements. Despite slight discrepancies, additional SHAP analysis suggests that the model's decision logic is consistent with known physical trends. Overall, this study fills a gap in reported thermophysical properties of UCo and provides experimental support for machine-learning-assisted screening of uranium compounds relevant to advanced fuel development.

The formation of two-dimensional metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) on an inert surface of a topological insulator (TI) is a pathway to engineer quantum materials with exotic properties. MOFs featuring ferromagnetically coupled metal atoms are theoretically predicted to induce an exchange gap in the TI surface band structure, potentially leading to a quantum anomalous Hall effect. However, achieving ordered MOFs on TI surfaces remains challenging due to the limited knowledge of self-assembly on these substrates. In this paper, we demonstrate self-assembly of Fe atoms and dicyanoanthracene (DCA) molecules into 2D MOFs on the Bi2Se3(0001) surface at room temperature, investigated via a combination of low-energy electron microscopy and diffraction (LEEM/LEED), scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and ab initio calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). Two competing Fe-DCA phases form. The first phase corresponds to a close-packed Fe1DCA3 structure. In contrast, the second phase exhibits a larger unit cell with no match to either known or DFT-calculated systems, indicating a more complex bonding environment. These findings advance the understanding of the growth of MOFs on a strong topological insulator surface and provide insights for designing MOFs/TI interfaces with tailored electronic and magnetic properties.

Engineering optical properties, such as luminescence purity and charge transfer, is crucial for harnessing the application potential of atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs). While electrostatic gating is widely applied to gain charge control in TMDC monolayers, charge transfer can also be engineered via coupling of TMDC monolayers at semiconductor III/V, organic, or van der Waals interfaces. This confers great advantages, such as ease in implementation and compatibility in device integration. Here, we shed light on the optical properties of many-particle complexes emerging at the GaInP/MoSe2 interface as a highly relevant material combination to manipulate the optical properties of TMDCs in integrated photonic devices. Our study verifies its nature as a type II hetero-interface, which bears the feasibility to display disorder-free photoluminescence. Through optical absorption measurements, we verify that the charged complexes acquire substantial oscillator strength. Furthermore, temperature-dependent photoluminescence, supported by a microscopic theory framework, evidences the suppression of the characteristic carrier recoil effect that was previously observed in the photoluminescence of trions in TMDCs. These phenomena allow us to identify the optical signatures at the TMDC-GaInP interface as Fermi polaron quasiparticle resonances, which are of high importance in researching Bose-Fermi mixtures in condensed matter systems.

### Triplet Envelope Functions for increasing machine learning interatomic potential efficiency and stability

Central to interatomic potential efficiency is the radial envelope function that enables linear scaling with computational cost by defining a local neighborhood of atoms. This has enabled MLIPs to revolutionize materials science over the past decade by providing DFT accuracy with linear scaling computational cost in molecular dynamics workflows. However, MLIPs still have a relatively high computational cost compared to empirical interatomic potentials, preventing them from transforming molecular dynamics workflows. A central issue is that MLIPs use relatively large cutoff radii, converging to 6A over the last few years. The large cutoffs prioritize accuracy of any material over efficiency in any particular region of phase space, capturing dispersion effects and low density materials at the expense of increased computational cost in higher density materials. Past work has aimed to address this with KNN graph sparsification, which, while significantly reducing cost, has the drawback of breaking energy conservation. In this work, we propose higher-order envelope functions that prune local atomic neighborhoods through physically inspired geometric functions to provide the memory and efficiency benefits of KNN graph sparsification while eliminating non-conservative energy dynamics. Through numerical experiments on solids and liquids with 5-8A cutoffs, we show that triplet envelope functions complement radial envelope functions by doubling training and inference speed, tripling memory efficiency, and increasing simulation stability while not impacting accuracy or data efficiency for the most common 6A cutoff. Moreover, experiments with 8A radial cutoffs show triplet envelope functions create a pathway to larger cutoff radii for efficiently and accurately modeling open structures with large interatomic distances, showing a promising new direction for engineering MLIP efficiency.

### Symmetry-restricted energy landscapes as a benchmark for machine learned interatomic potentials

Machine learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are becoming a standard method for DFT-level accurate molecular dynamics simulation and large-scale studies of crystal energetics. Increasingly popular are universal pre-trained potentials, also called foundation models, based one, e.g. the MACE, CHGNet, M3GNet, ORB, and SevenNet architectures. While there are many benchmarks of these models using validation errors and materials discovery tasks, their fidelity in reproducing the detailed features of potential energy surfaces (PES) is not understood to the same degree. We evaluate the accuracy of these potentials by systematically probing their predicted energy landscapes. Two-dimensional slices of the potential energy surface are constructed where the atomic positions are varied along selected Wyckoff degrees of freedom within a fixed crystal symmetry. This approach enables a direct, visual comparison of the interatomic potentials and DFT-calculated surfaces which reveals potential artifacts e.g., arising from unique local environments. Our analysis highlights the strengths and limitations of different potentials in capturing local minima, saddle points, and overall PES topology, offering insights into the physical accuracy of current pre-trained IAPs and providing benchmarks for future model development.

- **TL;DR**: 通过构建hBN/PbI2范德华异质结，将硼空位缺陷的荧光强度增强5-45倍，同时保持磁共振对比度，实现了量子传感性能的提升。

Spin defects in two-dimensional materials hold significant potential for quantum information technologies and sensing applications. The negatively charged boron vacancy (VB-) in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has attracted considerable attention as a quantum sensor due to its demonstrated sensitivity to temperature, magnetic fields, and pressure.1 However, its applications have thus far been limited by inherently dim photoluminescence (PL). By fabricating a van der Waals heterostructure with a sensitizing donor layer, lead iodide (PbI2), we effectively enhance the PL intensity from the VB- by 5-45x, while maintaining compatibility with other heterostructures and vdW optoelectronic platforms. The type-I band alignment at the heterojunction enables efficient exciton migration while suppressing back-electron transfer, and the strong spectral overlap between the PbI2 emission and defect absorption supports efficient fluorescence resonance energy transfer. Ab initio density functional theory (DFT) predicts a photon-ratcheting mechanism that boosts absorption and emission while maintaining magnetic resonance (ODMR) contrast through minimal hybridization. Experimentally, the heterostructure exhibits enhanced continuous-wave ODMR sensitivity and functions as a precise probe of external magnetic fields. This work establishes a proof-of-concept for amplifying weak defect signals in nanomaterials, highlighting a new strategy for engineering their optical and magnetic responses.

### Mechanics of incompatible asymmetric grain boundary migration

Grain boundary (GB) migration governs microstructure evolution and can mediate plastic deformation through sliding or shear coupling. Numerous experimental and numerical studies have reported a wide range of behaviors associated with boundary migration, such as defect emission or mode switching. Notably, recent studies have reported directionally asymmetric migration rates under symmetric loading, attributing this behavior to intrinsically asymmetric mobility; however, a mechanistic mesoscale explanation for this behavior remains lacking. In this work, we introduce a constitutive flow rule for grain-boundary eigendeformation within a multiphase-field framework, in which interfacial shear evolves in response to its mechanically conjugate driving force through the phase field Allen-Cahn equations. The formulation systematically employs regularized grain boundary shear kinematics informed by crystallography, and enables elastic compatibility to modulate boundary motion. Migration thresholds, residual back-stress, and apparent directional asymmetry appear naturally as emergent mechanical behavior. Simulations of symmetric and asymmetric tilt grain boundaries under mechanical, synthetic, and curvature-driven loading reveal persistent defect-like residuals following incompatible migration, transitions from planar motion to lamination at large inclinations, and even "ratcheting" behavior. These results provide a mechanically transparent explanation for behaviors such as effective mobility asymmetry and establish elastic compatibility as a constitutive mechanism in mesoscale models of boundary-mediated plasticity.

### Unbounded Systematic Error in Thin Film Conductivity Measurements

Electrical conductivity is the most fundamental charge transport parameter, and measurements of conductivity are a basic part of materials characterization for nearly all conducting materials. In thin films, conductivity is often measured in four bar architectures in which the current source and voltage measurement are spatially separated to eliminate systematic error due to contact resistance. Despite the apparent simplicity of these measurements, we demonstrate here that the four bar architecture is subject to significant systematic error arising from the finite conductivity of the metal electrodes. Remarkably, these systematic errors can in some cases become unbounded, producing arbitrarily high measured conductivity at modest true film conductivities, within the range relevant to emerging thin film thermoelectric materials such as conducting polymers. These unbounded errors, which can occur even in properly conducted four-point measurements of patterned films, likely explain literature reports of extremely high conductivities in conducting polymers, and can lead to anomalous scaling in temperature dependent studies, potentially leading to incorrect interpretation of the relevant charge transport mechanism. We characterize the device geometric factors that control these errors, which stand partially at odds with those required for accurate Seebeck coefficient measurements. Our analyses allow us to identify device architectures that provide small systematic errors for conductivity and Seebeck coefficient while still providing a low measurement resistance, critical to reducing noise in thermal voltage measurements. These findings provide important guidelines for accurate measurements in the growing field of thin-film thermoelectric materials.
