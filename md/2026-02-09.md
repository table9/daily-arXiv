- **TL;DR**: 提出一种温度依赖的电子电导率近似公式扩展（TAHM方法），通过热平均费米能级附近态密度涨落来估计电导率的温度依赖性，应用于多种代表性材料系统。

We present a temperature-dependent extension of the approximate electronic conductivity formula of Hindley and Mott that leverages time-averaged fluctuations of the electronic density of states obtained from ab initio molecular dynamics. By thermally averaging the square of the density of states near the Fermi level, we obtain an estimate of the temperature dependence of the conductivity. This approach termed the thermally-averaged Hindley-Mott (TAHM) method was applied to five representative systems: crystalline aluminum (c-Al), aluminum with a grain boundary (AlGB), a four-layer graphene-aluminum composite (Al-Gr), amorphous silicon (a-Si) and amorphous germanium-antimony-telluride (a-GST). The method reproduces the expected Bloch-Gruneisen decrease in conductivity for c-Al and AlGB. Generally, the reduction (increase) in conductivity for metallic (semiconducting) materials are reproduced. It captures microstructure-induced, thermally activated conduction in multilayer Al-Gr, a-Si and a-GST. Overall, the approach provides a computationally efficient link between time-dependent electronic structure and temperature-dependent transport, offering a simple and approximate tool for exploring electronic conductivity trends in complex and disordered materials.

- **TL;DR**: 研究硅在超快激光烧蚀中的非热材料动力学，通过大规模原子模拟揭示非热烧蚀机制，并构建激发依赖的硅相图

We investigate the non-thermal material dynamics of strongly excited silicon during ultra-fast laser ablation. In contrast to metals, silicon shows strongly excitation-dependent interatomic bonding strengths, which gives rise to a number of unique material dynamics like non-thermal melting, Coulomb explosions and altered carrier heat conduction due to charge carrier confinement. In this study, we report novel non-thermal ablation mechanisms in the ultra-fast single shot laser ablation of silicon and perform large scale massive multi-parallel simulations on experimentally achievable length scales with atomistic resolution. For this, we model the ultra-fast carrier dynamics utilizing the Thermal-Spike-Model coupled to Molecular Dynamics simulations and include the accompanied excitation-dependent nonthermal bonding strength manipulation by application of the excitation-dependent modified Tersoff Potential. Further, we present first results on the systematic construction of the excitation-dependent phase diagram of silicon by thermodynamic integration.

- **TL;DR**: 通过CrSb薄膜中Cr部分被Mn取代，实现了室温以上具有反常霍尔效应的反铁磁材料

Altermagnets are a promising class of materials for spintronic applications. However, compounds that simultaneously combine the symmetry required to support an anomalous Hall effect with good metallic conductivity and magnetic ordering temperatures well above room temperature remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that partial substitution of Cr by Mn in epitaxial CrSb(100) thin films provides a viable route to engineer the combined structural and magnetic symmetry necessary to enable an otherwise symmetry-forbidden anomalous Hall effect. By systematically exploring the magnetic phase diagram Cr$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$Sb thin films, we identify a pronounced anomalous Hall effect in Cr$_{0.75}$Mn$_{0.25}$Sb. Guided by Landau theory, we model the field-driven reorientation of the Néel vector and the resulting anomalous Hall response, achieving good qualitative agreement with the experimental observations.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究在NbTaTiV难熔复合浓缩合金中发现温度驱动的从螺位错到刃位错控制的塑性变形转变，实现了优异的高温强度保持

Refractory complex concentrated alloys (RCCAs) show promise for high-temperature applications but often lose strength due to screw-dislocation-controlled plasticity. We demonstrate a temperature-driven transition from screw- to edge-dislocation-controlled deformation in a single-phase NbTaTiV RCCA. Tensile tests from 298-1573 K reveal a pronounced intermediate-temperature strength plateau and yield strengths surpassing other ductile RCCAs and the Ni-based superalloy CMSX-4 above 1273 K. In-situ neutron diffraction, TEM, and molecular dynamics identify a crossover near ~900 K, where edge dislocation glide stabilized by V-induced lattice distortion dominates, enabling enhanced strength retention and a clear design strategy for ultrahigh-temperature applications.

- **TL;DR**: TPSC+方法解释Hubbard模型中压缩率最大值与赝能隙到金属态转变的关系，揭示赝能隙本质与SDW涨落机制

Qualitative changes in thermodynamic and single-particle properties characterize the transition between the pseudogapped electronic liquid and the Fermi liquid. Recent cold-atom experiments on a simulator of the Hubbard model with nearest-neighbor hoppings \cite{kendrick2025pseudogap} showed that the isothermal compressibility $κ(δ)$ has a maximum as a function of doping $δ$. Here we use the two-particle self-consistent plus (TPSC+) approach to explain these experiments and connect the maximum in $κ(δ)$ to the transformation of the single-particle spectrum from the pseudogapped to the metallic regime. This elucidates the nature of the pseudogap (PG). Specifically, the maximum in $κ(δ)$ practically coincides with the doping at which the precursor of the lower $(π,π)$ spin density wave (SDW) band at the antinodal point crosses the zero-frequency $ω=0$. The Knight shift, $χ_{sp}(0,0)(δ)$, as a function of doping, should also have a maximum. The maxima in both quantities should exist, at sufficiently low temperatures ($T$), in both the intermediate $U \approx U_{Mott}$ and weak $U &lt; U_{Mott}$ interaction limits. In both limits, the mechanism is critical thermal SDW fluctuations. At the antinodal pseudogap, the correlation length at $δ_{max}(T)$ can be small, controlled not by static but by dynamic critical thermal fluctuations. We also find that the SDW fluctuations are incommensurate at $δ=δ_{max}$. We predict that, at low $T$, the multiple peaks in the spin susceptibility in the incommensurate case lead to more than two SDW precursor peaks in the spectral function and density of states. By allowing access to parameter regimes relevant to cuprates-including further-neighbor hopping ($t', t''$) and low temperatures, our work provides a high-impact tool for further studies by the broader community.

- **TL;DR**: 三角晶格Hubbard模型在U→∞时支持由两个空穴和一个磁振子组成的紧束缚Cooper对（2h1m）超导态

We demonstrate that the infinite-$U$ triangular-lattice Hubbard model supports a superconducting state built from tightly bound Cooper pairs composed of two holes and one magnon ($2h1m$). Building on the seminal prediction of repulsively bound $2h1m$ states, we show that next-nearest-neighbor hopping $t_{2}$ coherently mixes symmetry-related configurations, stabilizing an $s$-wave bound state with substantial binding energy and a light effective mass. Large-scale DMRG calculations at finite doping identify a magnetization plateau corresponding to a gas of such bound states and quasi--long--range superconducting order with power-law $2h1m$ pair correlations. Our results establish a magnon-mediated superconducting mechanism driven by kinetic frustration, with immediate detectable signatures for moiré Hubbard materials and ultracold-atom simulators.

### Kohn-Sham density encoding rescues coupled cluster theory for strongly correlated molecules

- **TL;DR**: KS-CCSD(T)比HF-CCSD(T)在强关联系统中表现更好，这源于单粒子密度矩阵的差异而非KS轨道的性质，该方法能近乎化学精度地处理过渡金属二聚体和主族化合物

Coupled cluster theory with a Kohn-Sham reference (KS-CC) can dramatically outperform its Hartree-Fock counterpart for strongly correlated systems, but the origin of these improvements has remained unclear. Here we demonstrate that these improvements arise from differences in the one-particle density matrix that are encoded into the non-canonical Fock matrix and not from the nature of the KS orbitals, as is commonly assumed. Equipped with this insight, KS-CCSD(T) can be leveraged to achieve near-chemical-accuracy for electronic and thermochemical properties of transition-metal dimers and main-group compounds. Most strikingly, KS-CCSD(T) qualitatively recovers the entire Cr$_2$ potential energy surface, a notorious failure case for HF-CCSD(T) and single-reference density functional theory. We further introduce a density difference diagnostic that identifies multireference character and guides practitioners toward rational selections of optimal references at mean-field cost. These results establish KS-CCSD(T) as a practical route to treat strong correlation within the "gold standard" framework, and this has immediate implications for machine learning potential development and materials research, areas that heavily rely on KS-DFT for model-parameter fitting.

### Robust flat bands of the honeycomb wire network

- **TL;DR**: 周期性蜂窝状弹道导电通道网络普遍存在覆盖整个布里渊区的精确平带，这些平带与微观顶点散射无关，适用于任意横向模式数，并与色散带保持1:2的普遍比例。

We show that periodic honeycomb networks of ballistic conducting channels generically host exact flat bands spanning the entire Brillouin zone. These flat bands are independent of microscopic vertex scattering, persist for any number of transverse modes, and occur in a universal $1\colon 2$ ratio with dispersive bands. Their existence is enforced by local $D_3$ vertex symmetry and lattice translations. We construct compact localized states obeying a Bohr-Sommerfeld-type quantization condition and demonstrate that flat bands survive in realistic antidot lattices, establishing honeycomb wire networks as a robust flat band platform relevant to gated high-mobility 2D electron gases and molecule-patterned metallic surfaces.

### The Preservation Tradeoff: A Thermodynamic Bound in the Diminishing-Returns Regime

- **TL;DR**: 该论文建立了信息保存的热力学可行性条件，定义了保存刚度S_κ作为响应函数，推导出最优性条件，并证明在收益递减机制下，最优维护分配上限为50%，在平滑饱和子类中进一步限制在30-50%区间。

Thermodynamic systems that preserve information against thermal fluctuations face a tradeoff distinct from transmission (Shannon) or erasure (Landauer). We establish a feasibility condition for this preservation problem within a broad class of systems exhibiting diminishing returns in error suppression. By defining the preservation stiffness S_kappa, a response function analogous to magnetic susceptibility, we derive an optimality condition linking S_kappa to the resource odds. This identity provides a substrate-agnostic diagnostic: deviations reveal thermodynamic inefficiency or operation outside the smooth reliability regime. For systems in the diminishing-returns regime -- a class we argue is typical of physically realistic error-correction -- the optimal maintenance allocation is bounded above by 50%; for the physically significant subclass exhibiting smooth saturation, it is further constrained to a 30-50% band. We derive this regime from two independent physical principles -- Shannon's channel capacity and Landauer's erasure bound -- whose convergence on the same functional form constitutes our central theoretical contribution. We validate this framework against kinetic proofreading data in E. coli and protocol overhead in TCP/IP networks, and specify conditions under which the prediction is falsifiable.

### Thin-Film Stabilization and Magnetism in η-Carbide Type Iron Nitrides

- **TL;DR**: 该研究首次实现了η-氮化物Fe-W-N和Fe-Mo-N的薄膜合成，建立了相稳定性图谱，发现Fe3Mo3N基相具有更宽的稳定范围，并揭示了Fe富集可诱导铁磁性和交换偏置响应。

Transition-metal nitrides in η-carbide type structures exhibit unusual bonding motifs and proximity to magnetic instabilities. Yet they remain unexplored in thin-film form due to the difficulty of stabilizing nitrogen-poor ternaries among competing phases. Here, we report the thin-film synthesis and phase-stability mapping of the η-nitride systems Fe-W-N and Fe-Mo-N. Amorphous Fe-M-N (M = W, Mo) combinatorial libraries deposited by reactive co-sputtering crystallize upon rapid thermal annealing, enabling systematic identification of synthesis windows as a function of composition and annealing temperature. Using laboratory powder X-ray diffraction and synchrotron grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering, we establish that Fe3Mo3N-based η-carbide phases form over a substantially broader compositional and thermal range than W-based compositions, where η-structures are stabilized only when the films are Fe-rich. These trends are rationalized using mixed chemical-potential vs. composition phase diagrams that capture the narrow nitrogen chemical-potential stability of η-nitrides. Magnetic measurements reveal that ferromagnetism is induced in Fe-rich Fe3.54Mo2.46N with a small exchange-bias-like response that is absent in Fe3W3N-based compositions, highlighting the sensitivity of magnetic behavior to modest deviations from stoichiometry. This work establishes practical thin-film synthesis routes for η-nitride materials and demonstrates how composition can be tuned to access emergent magnetic phenomena in these complex nitrides.

- **TL;DR**: 研究一维自旋-1/2 XX链在横向磁场下的磁化行为，发现1/5和3/5磁化平台，磁化平台数量由全局周期性Q=5决定，与自旋费米子费米能级以上的激发能隙数量一致。

We study the elementary excitations and magnetization of a one-dimensional spin-1/2 XX chain comprising trimer-dimer units (the J1-J1-J2-J3-J2 topology) under a transverse magnetic field h. Using Green's function theory and the Jordan-Wigner transformation, we map the system onto spinless fermions and focus on antiferromagnetic (AFM) interactions. At zero temperature, distinct 1/5 and 3/5 magnetization plateaus emerge, determined by the global periodicity Q=5, with the number of plateaus matching the number of excitation gaps above the Fermi level of the spinless fermions. The magnetic phase diagram in the (h-Js) plane features a Luttinger liquid (LL) state, a gapless AFM state, two magnetization plateau states, and a fully polarized gapped magnetic state. The widths of the LL and gapless AFM phases are found to be proportional to the bandwidths gamma = |E(k=0)-E(k=pi)| of the corresponding elementary excitations, whereas the widths of the magnetization plateau states are governed by the excitation gaps. Our study opens new directions for exploring interacting trimer-dimer spin chains in quantum magnetism using experimental techniques such as neutron scattering, as well as theoretical and numerical approaches including quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) and density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) methods. Furthermore, we extend the Oshikawa-Yamanaka-Affleck (OYA) condition to generalized cluster chains, demonstrating that the allowed magnetization plateaus are governed by the global periodicity of the chain (e.g., Q=5 for a trimer-dimer chain), rather than by the local periodicity of individual units (Q=3 for a trimer or Q=2 for a dimer).

### Superconductivity of 30.4 K and its Reemergence under Pressure in Fe1.11Se Synthesized via Ion-exchange and De-intercalation Reaction

Binary stoichiometry FeSe (s-FeSe) is a well-known parent of high-temperature unconventional superconductors owing to its charge-neutral layer, highly tunable structure and electronic properties, and rich interplays among multiple electronic phases. Yet the s-FeSe synthesized via high-temperature equilibrium reactions bears the notorious interstitial Fe,where merely 3% of them is sufficient to kill the superconductivity. Here, we successfully synthesized a new non-stoichiometric Fe1.11Se single crystal with a superconducting onset temperature (Tconset) of 30.4 K through a hydrothermal ion-exchange and de-intercalation route. 11% interstitial Fe ions exceed the equilibrium phase diagram limit. Intriguingly, under physical pressure, the Tconset of exhibits a "V"-shaped evolution with a minimum at 2-2.6 GPa, and then upturning into a second superconducting region, reminiscent of the behaviors in FeSe intercalates. Furthermore, a pressure-induced possible magnetic order, previously only observed in pressurized s-FeSe, shows up. These results offer fresh insights into the role of interstitial Fe in governing superconducting and transport properties under non-equilibrium synthesis and tuning strategies.

- **TL;DR**: PIGSTA是一种后处理框架，通过分析卷积核修正有限珠子数带来的频率相关离散误差，显著改善核量子效应的收敛性

Nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) play an essential role in many atomistic systems, yet their explicit inclusion in molecular simulations remains challenging. Path-integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) provides a rigorous framework for incorporating NQEs, but its practical applicability is often limited by the slow and strongly system-dependent convergence with respect to the number of beads. Here we introduce path-integral generalized smoothed trajectory analysis (PIGSTA), a post-processing framework for the systematic incorporation of NQEs into atomistic simulations, using either classical or path-integral molecular dynamics trajectories. By applying analytically defined convolution kernels to simulation trajectories, PIGSTA corrects the frequency-dependent discretization error associated with a finite number of beads, without modifying the underlying dynamics. For harmonic systems, PIGSTA recovers the exact quantum-mechanical limit at any bead number, whereas standard PIMD becomes exact only in the infinite-bead limit. More generally, the method significantly improves the convergence of thermodynamic and structural observables at finite bead numbers and provides an internal, reference-free diagnostic of bead-number convergence based on the consistency of energy and force estimators. We assess PIGSTA for ambient liquid water and for the Zundel cation at ultralow temperature, representing a particularly demanding case for bead-number convergence. In both systems, PIGSTA reproduces the converged PIMD limit and enables physically consistent results at reduced bead numbers when convergence criteria are satisfied. Owing to its post-processing nature and negligible additional computational cost, PIGSTA offers a practical and broadly applicable approach for incorporating NQEs into atomistic simulations.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文展示了一种腔增强的InAs/InAlGaAs量子点单光子源，在电信C波段实现了创纪录的67.4ps低双激子衰减时间，并展示了高纯度的单光子发射和优化的双光子干涉可见度。

In this work we present a cavity-enhanced InAs/$\mathrm{In_{0.53}Al_{0.23}Ga_{0.24}As}$ quantum dot (QD) single-photon source in the telecom C-band with a record-low biexciton emitter decay time of \SI{67.4(2)}{ps} under resonant two-photon excitation (TPE). We observe strong multiphoton suppression associated with $g^{(2)}_\mathrm{X}(0) = 0.006(1)$ and $g^{(2)}_\mathrm{XX}(0) = 0.007(1)$ for the exciton (X) and biexciton (XX) emission, respectively. Due to a asymmetric Purcell enhancement of the XX-X cascade, the two-photon interference (TPI) visibility of XX photons under $π$-pulse excitation of $V_{\rm{TPI}} = 90(3)\%$ reaches the theoretical limit and clearly exceeds the $\sim60\%$ expected for standard XX-X cascades without photonic engineering. Furthermore, adding a second timed laser pulse coinciding with XX emission energy, we demonstrate stimulated TPE in the telecom C-Band. The result is an improved TPI visibility of the X photons of $V_{\rm{TPI}}=0.69(3)$ compared to TPE with $V_{\rm{TPI}}=0.61(4)$, with both being reduced compared to the theoretical values due to present dephasing effects. The advances presented in this work hold important promises for the implementation of advanced schemes of quantum communication using deterministic quantum light sources.

- **TL;DR**: 信息粒子通过信息引擎将信息熵转化为有效自推进速度/力，获得类主动运动。研究比较了自推进粒子(SPP)和Ornstein-Uhlenbeck(OU)信息粒子(OUIP)的动力学差异。

An information particle can acquire active-like motion through transforming the information entropy into effective self-propulsion velocity/force using the attached information engine. We consider an underdamped Brownian particle additionally driven by either a constant self-propulsion force or an information engine using Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) bath feedback control, such particles are called self-propelled particle (SPP) or OU information particle (OUIP). Compared to the widely-investigated SPP, the OUIP shows a significant different dynamical pattern, including two types of moving mode: a slow-speed diffusion mode and a high-speed traveling mode. The specific evolution of OUIP can be adjusted flexibly between such two modes through the inertial effect, thus acquiring a rich and non-trivial motion behavior. By tuning the strength of fluctuation of the OU bath, a wide range of net velocity can be achieved for OUIP. We highlight that OUIP could be an exceptional candidate for active agent.

We report detailed Raman spectroscopic and magnetic susceptibility studies on the spin-driven ferroelectric compounds Mn4Nb2O9 (MNO) and Mn4Ta2O9 (MTO). Both systems exhibit strong spin-phonon coupling below the short-range magnetic ordering temperature (T(sro)=223 K), followed by further renormalization of several Raman modes at the long-range magnetic ordering temperatures (TN = 120 K for MNO and 110 K for MTO). Pronounced anomalies in Raman mode frequencies and linewidths, along with the emergence of octahedral modes between Tsro and TN, indicate a possible low-symmetry structural transition, more evident in MNO and closely linked to magnetic ordering in MTO. Distinct low-temperature evolutions of Raman mode shift, linewidth, and integrated intensity in MNO and MTO highlight the role of the nonmagnetic B-site cation in tuning spin-lattice coupling, driven by differences in spin-orbit coupling and orbital hybridization between Nb5+ (4d) and Ta5+ (5d). By combining Raman spectroscopy with nuclear magnetic resonance, and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, we further show that Mn-based systems possess a more distorted local structure than their Co analogues, while their electronic structures differ despite comparable band gaps. These results provide a comprehensive understanding of spin-lattice coupling in Mn- and Co-based A4B2O9 magnetoelectric systems.

Built from higher-dimensional Clifford-algebra representations, spin-orbital Hamiltonians can be realized on both three- and four-coordinated lattices, giving rise to phases with 3 and 2 itinerant Majorana flavors. We demonstrate that these models host a rich set of gapless Majorana metals, characterized, in particular, by topological Fermi surfaces, nodal lines, and Weyl semimetal phases. We analyze the stability of these structures under physically motivated perturbations and identify generic splitting patterns and topological transitions driven by symmetry breaking and flavor mixing. This yields a unified organizing framework for three-dimensional Majorana metals in fractionalized spin liquids.

- **TL;DR**: 通过构建单层CuO₂平面异质结构，研究发现铜基超导体的d波超导性可以在完全孤立的单层CuO₂平面中存在，证明铜基超导本质上是二维现象。

One of the central questions in cuprate superconductivity is if superconductivity can exist in an isolated single CuO$_2$ plane without any interlayer coupling. There have been numerous experimental efforts to answer this question, but it still has not been clearly resolved. Here we present a heterostructure system with an isolated half-unit-cell La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ which has a single CuO$_2$ plane. Using in-situ angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we measured the electronic and gap structures of a single CuO$_2$ plane. We observed a \textit{d}-wave-like gap which closes somewhat above the bulk T$_c$. Moreover, almost identical gap properties are seen for both single CuO$_2$ plane and bulk. These observations lead us to the conclusion that the d-wave superconductivity of cuprates also exists in a single CuO$_2$ plane. Our results demonstrate that cuprate superconductivity is essentially a two-dimensional phenomenon and provide a platform to study cuprate superconductivity in a purely two-dimensional system.

The electrostatic interactions of phosphate groups and counter ions critically affect the structure, function and reactivity of DNA or RNA. We present a joint experimental-theoretical investigation of dimethyl phosphate (DMP-) in aqueous solution, an established model system of the sugar-phosphate backbone. Utilizing 31P-NMR spectroscopy as probe of phosphate-ion association, variations of Mg2+ and Ca2+ content exhibit a systematic shielding of the 31P chemical shift (δiso(31P)) with moderate temperature dependence. Enhanced sampling molecular dynamics (MD) and ab initio (GIAO-DF-LMP2) level of theory are used to reveal the microscopic mechanism. Simulations are performed for a configurational ensemble of DMP-ion geometries and their first solvation shells, demonstrating (i) the spatial convergence of changes of the nuclear shielding constant σiso(31P), (ii) the intramolecular geometric origin of short-timescale σiso(31P) fluctuations and (iii) an average shift of σiso(31P) of about 3-5 ppm upon contact ion pair formation with Mg2+ or Ca2+ ions. A quantitative analysis of δiso(31P) for varying ion content and temperature allows us to extract the temperature-dependent fraction of the contact ion pair species, indicating that solvent separated or free ion pairs are the energetically preferred species. The results impose boundary conditions for improvements of phosphate ion force fields and establish the interactions underlying the changes of δiso(31P).

We investigate the two-port scattering process in non-Hermitian dimer models via quantum measurements using external leads. We focus on two exemplary dimer models that preserve parity-time symmetry via spatial gain-loss balance and exhibit non-reciprocity due to directional hopping. The scattering matrix is constructed using the biorthogonality of the left and right scattering states of the Hamiltonian, allowing us to calculate the reflection and transmission probabilities. Our analysis compares the reflection and transmission coefficients derived from the left, right, and combined scattering states, revealing that, unlike in Hermitian systems, the non-Hermitian scattering process does not adhere to unitarity when considering only the right scattering states. Furthermore, non-Hermitian scattering can enhance the reflection and transmission probabilities, with distinct physical contributions arising independently from complex eigenvalues and the non-orthogonality of eigenstates. Our results clarify how biorthogonality restores generalized unitarity and identify distinct physical origins of enhanced transport in PT-symmetric and non-reciprocal dimers, providing new insights into quantum transport in non-Hermitian systems.

We formulate nonequilibrium thermodynamics in which intensive variables acquire operational meaning through measurement protocols consistent with local reciprocity. Using physical equilibrium as a reference, conjugate observables are constructed by continuously adjusting devices along the local tangent space of the statistical manifold. In this relativity of observation, Onsager reciprocity holds locally, allowing inference-based Lagrange multipliers to be directly measured. This provides a systematic method to extend operational definitions of intensive variables to nonequilibrium states, highlighting their context-dependent nature and offering a concrete experimental strategy.

- **TL;DR**: 通过扫描隧道光谱研究扭曲MoS₂中静电无序对电子结构的影响，发现MX和XM堆叠区域存在15 meV的能带起始能量差异，揭示了静电无序在莫尔材料中的关键作用。

Twisted transition-metal dichalcogenides host highly tunable moiré potentials, flat bands, and correlated electronic phases, yet the role of disorder in shaping these emergent properties remains largely unresolved. Using scanning tunneling spectroscopy, we investigate the impact of electrostatic disorder on the electronic structure of marginally twisted ($θ\approx 0.95^\circ$) bilayer MoS$_2$. Differences of 15 meV in the onset energies of the valence and conduction bands between MX- and XM-stacked regions are observed and are unexpected based on symmetry considerations. We further observe spatially correlated disorder in the band onset energy that is consistent with a background random charge density of a few $10^{11}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$. Continuum model calculations for twisted MoS$_2$ reveal dramatic changes in the low-energy moiré bands in response to an electric displacement field, in quantitative agreement with experiment. Moreover, the calculated local density of states including disorder broadening reproduces the experimental observations only when structural relaxation is taken into account. These results highlight the critical role of electrostatic disorder in determining the electronic structure of moiré materials at the nanoscale.

Spectroscopic measurements in model one-dimensional (1D) correlated systems offer insights for understanding their two-dimensional counterparts, which include the cuprate and iron pnictide/chalcogenide superconductors. A major challenge is the identification of such correlated systems with dominantly 1D physics. In this work, inelastic neutron scattering measurements on NaFe$_{0.53}$Cu$_{0.47}$As single crystal directly reveal quasi-1D spin excitations, resulting from atomic order that lead to magnetic Fe and nonmagnetic Cu chains. The dominant exchange interaction is antiferromagnetic along the chain ($SJ_{\rm \parallel}\approx90.1(3)$~meV), whereas the inter-chain couplings are much weaker ($SJ_{\rm \perp}\approx-2.4(1)$~meV and $SJ_{\rm c}\approx0.15(5)$~meV). The quasi-1D spin excitations in NaFe$_{0.53}$Cu$_{0.47}$As stem from both the Néel and stripe vectors, with Néel excitations sensitive to Fe impurities on the Cu site. The spin excitations in quasi-1D NaFe$_{0.53}$Cu$_{0.47}$As and quasi-2D FeSe exhibit a striking resemblance, suggesting a common origin for their coexistent stripe and Néel excitations. Our findings demonstrate magnetic dilution in NaFeAs leads to dimension reduction of its magnetic degree of freedom, presenting a strategy for discovering low-dimensional quantum materials.

We realize a superconductor-coupled quantum dot (QD) in an InSb nanosheet, a 2D platform promising for studies of topological superconductivity. The device consists of a superconductor-QD-superconductor junction, where a bottom bilayer gate defines the QD and allows tuning of its coupling to the superconducting leads. The QD exhibits large $g$-factors and strong spin-orbit coupling. Transport measurements reveal Coulomb diamond-shaped differential conductance features with even-odd alternating sizes and pronounced conductance lines associated with the superconducting gap, confirming a few-electron, superconductor-coupled regime. At an odd electron occupation, Kondo signatures emerge, including a zero-bias peak that splits with magnetic field and is logarithmically suppressed at elevated temperatures. We further observe a doublet-singlet quantum phase transition, manifested by a clear change of Andreev bound states from crossing to anticrossing as the coupling strength increases. These results underscore the rich physics of InSb nanosheet QDs and their promise for topological quantum devices.

Vibrational spectroscopy provides a powerful connection between molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and experiment, but its routine use in condensed-phase systems remains limited. We introduce mimyria, a modular and automated framework that orchestrates electronic-structure reference calculations, trains atom-resolved machine-learning response models, and generates IR and Raman spectra from MD trajectories within a unified workflow. We introduce the polarizability gradient tensor (PGT) as a novel atom-resolved machine-learning target property for Raman spectroscopy, complementing the established atomic polar tensor (APT) for IR spectroscopy. As a necessary prerequisite, we demonstrate how both PGTs and APTs can accurately be computed from electronic-structure theory, validate them across formally equivalent derivative formulations, and thereby benchmark their numerical consistency. We then employ machine learning as an efficient surrogate to represent the validated APT and PGT response functions on aqueous benchmark systems. We validate the trained models directly at the level of the spectrum against explicit ab initio reference calculations and find that IR and Raman spectra converge with surprisingly small training sets. Moreover, spectral agreement improves more rapidly than the root-mean-square error (RMSE). While RMSE is straightforward to compute, statistically converged reference spectra are generally impractical to obtain, motivating the need to relate model-level errors to observable-level accuracy. By connecting these complementary error measures, we provide practical guidelines and early-stopping criteria for achieving sufficient spectral fidelity. By integrating response-tensor learning, automated training, and spectral-domain validation into a unified workflow, mimyria enables data-efficient and quantitatively reliable vibrational spectroscopy.

We investigate the effects of chirality on phonon thermal transport in semiconducting chiral single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) using lattice dynamics combined with Boltzmann transport theory. We find that transverse acoustic and optical phonon modes, which are degenerate in nonchiral zigzag and armchair SWCNTs, are split in chiral SWCNTs, giving rise to finite phonon angular momentum associated with circular motion of individual atoms. This angular momentum is most efficiently generated in small-diameter nanotubes with intermediate chiral angles. Consequently, chiral SWCNTs are predicted to undergo thermally induced rigid-body rotation with an experimentally observable angular velocity via the thermal Einstein-de Haas effect.

We study how macroscopic observational constraints restrict admissible microscopic explanatory structures when no intrinsic order or dynamics is assumed a priori. Starting from an unordered collection of measurement outcomes, we formulate inference as a constrained large deviation problem, selecting probability assignments that minimize relative entropy with respect to a reference measure determined solely by the measurement setup. We show that among all microscopic structures compatible with a given macroscopic constraint, those rendering the observation statistically most typical are selected. As an explicit illustration, we demonstrate how ordered microscopic structures can emerge purely from inference under constraint, even when the reference measure is fully permutation symmetric. Order is thus not assumed but inferred, serving here only as an illustrative example of a broader class of relational explanatory hypotheses constrained by observation.

Antiperovskites share the same structure as perovskites, but allow completely different chemistries and nominal charge states of anions to be stabilized. This gives rise to many interesting phenomena, including septet superconductivity and topological crystalline insulating phases in these systems. Despite this, the work on the crystal structural trends in these compounds are more limited compared to perovskites. In this study, we consider the family of antiperovskite oxides with tetrel elements (Si, Ge, Sn, Pb) and alkaline earth metals (Ca, Sr, Ba), and perform a detailed study of their crystal structures using first principles density functional theory. We show how tolerance factor arguments can be constructed to predict their structure in a way parallel to the perovskites, and furthermore, how heterostructuring (or cation-order) can be used to induce ferroelectricity in these systems which may provide an experimental knob to modify electronic structure. We conclude by a discussion of the electronic structure of antiperovskites, and show that they display interesting trends not observed in regular perovskites, including significant antibonding interactions between face-center ions, which might need to be taken into account building effective electronic models of these compounds.

Chiral topological semimetals hosting multifold fermions and exotic surface states represent a frontier in topological materials research. Among them, noncentrosymmetric cubic B20 compounds-notably transition-metal silicides and germanides-offer a unique platform for realizing symmetry-protected topological phases and unconventional optoelectronic responses. Here, we report the physical properties of RhGe and CoGe single crystals with B20 structure in detail. Transport measurements reveal metallic behavior with characteristic Fermi-liquid scaling at low temperatures, while magnetization results confirm paramagnetism in both compounds. In addition, both of materials exhibit low carrier concentrations with small electronic specific heat coefficient, indicating their semimetal feature with weak electronic correlations. Such high-quality CoGe and RhGe single crystals provide a material platform to explore the evolution of multifold fermions and the instability of helicoid-arc surface states with spin-orbit coupling and surface environment in B20 material systems.

Wavefront dislocations (WDs) -- phase singularities observed in quasiparticle interference (QPI) experiments -- have been widely interpreted as the definitive real-space signatures of Berry phases in graphene-family systems. Here, we disentangle the roles of topological charge and pseudospin texture in WD experiments. By investigating various way of the annihilation of quadratic band touchings (QBTs) in bilayer graphene and magneto-spin-orbit graphene systems, we demonstrate that WD evolution is governed exclusively by changes in the underlying pseudospin winding, while remaining insensitive to the topological charge (i.e., vorticity) of the band touching itself. Our results imply that WD measures wavefunction pseudospin texture rather than a diagnostic of topological charge and provide solid-state platforms in which WD evolution can be engineered and observed.

- **TL;DR**: 论文提出了Tensor Network Dynamical Message Passing (TNDMP)框架，通过"易感诱导因子分解"理论，解决了流行病建模中精确模拟计算量大与近似方法忽略相关性的根本矛盾。

While epidemiological modeling is pivotal for informing public health strategies, a fundamental trade-off limits its predictive fidelity: exact stochastic simulations are often computationally intractable for large-scale systems, whereas efficient analytical approximations typically fail to account for essential short-range correlations and network loops. Here, we resolve this trade-off by introducing Tensor Network Dynamical Message Passing (TNDMP), a framework grounded in a rigorous property we term \textit{Susceptible-Induced Factorization}. This theoretical insight reveals that a susceptible node acts as a dynamical decoupler, factorizing the global evolution operator into localized components. Leveraging this, TNDMP provides a dual-mode algorithmic suite: an exact algorithm that computes local observables with minimal redundancy on tractable topologies and a scalable and tunable approximation for complex real-world networks. We demonstrate that widely adopted heuristics, such as Dynamical Message Passing (DMP) and Pair Approximation (PA), are mathematically recoverable as low-order limits of our framework. Numerical validation in synthetic and real-world networks confirms that TNDMP significantly outperforms existing methods to predict epidemic thresholds and steady states, offering a rigorous bridge between the efficiency of message passing and the accuracy of tensor network formalisms.

Antiferromagnetic kagome metal FeGe has attracted tremendous attention in condensed matter physics due to the charge density wave (CDW) being well below its magnetic transition temperature. Up to now, numerous works on kagome FeGe have been based on single crystal bulk, but its thin film form has still not been reported. Here, we achieved epitaxial growth of FeGe thin films on Al2O3 substrates using molecular beam epitaxy. Structural characterization with x-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy, and high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy reveals single phase with flat surface of kagome FeGe thin films. Moreover, a Néel temperature of 397 K and a rapid variation of Hall coefficient and magnetoresistance around 100 K, which might be related to the CDW, were revealed via transport measurements. The high quality kagome FeGe thin films are expected to provide a versatile platform to study the mechanism of CDW and explore the application of FeGe in antiferromagnetic spintronics.

Photoemission spectroscopy is a powerful technique for studying electronic structure and spin-state transitions, as it reveals changes in the orbital configuration accompanying a spin-state crossover. In this report, we combine excitation-energy-, temperature-, and geometry-dependent photoemission measurements to probe the electronic structure of LaCoO3 across its thermally driven spin-state transition. By systematically comparing valence-band spectra across a wide photon-energy window - from surface-sensitive soft x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (SXPS) to bulk-sensitive hard x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (HAXPES) - we identify the Co 3d-derived feature (A) along with the O 2p-dominated features (B and C), and explain their relative evolution in terms of photon-energy-dependent photo-ionization cross-section ratios. The thermally induced spin-state crossover is demonstrated using temperature-dependent SXPS valence-band spectra, which show a progressive suppression of the feature A with heating. Geometry-dependent HAXPES measurements further clarify how the signature of the spin-state transition in LaCoO3 is intricately linked to the orbital-selective response of the t2g and eg states. Additionally, angular-dependent photo-ionization cross-section analysis provides a consistent description of the polarization dependence observed in HAXPES. Finally, configuration-interaction analysis of the Co 2p core-level spectra reveals that LaCoO3 evolves from a predominantly low-spin ground state at low temperature to a mixed low-spin/high-spin configuration at elevated temperatures, with the high-spin fraction reaching about 30 percent at 400 K. The temperature evolution of the core-level line shape thus establishes Co 2p photoemission as a sensitive quantitative probe of spin-state transitions in LaCoO3.

We theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate optically tunable nonlinear mechanical damping in a cavity optomechanical system utilizing a partly resolved sideband regime. Optomechanical coupling provides a delayed nonlinear backaction to the mechanical modes, resulting in nonlinear mechanical damping. This optically induced nonlinear damping is observed in the frequency and time domains, and we show using both theory and experiment that it can be tuned via laser detuning. We also observe optically mediated cross-nonlinear damping between two mechanical modes: the amplitude of one mode modulates the damping of the other. The presented results show a fully tunable scheme of nonlinear mechanical damping that will be applicable to various non-trivial systems, governed by nonlinear, nonequilibrium, and non-Hermitian phenomena.

The Gibbs paradox is a conventional paradox in classical statistical mechanics, typically resolved by invoking quantum indistinguishability through the 1/N! correction. In this letter, we present a resolution within classical ensemble theory, which relies solely on the equal probability principle and does not invoke the 1/N! correction. Our resolution can be naturally interpretated from a purely informational perspective, where the Gibbs entropy is explicitly regarded as the Shannon entropy, quantifying ignorance rather than disorder. From this informational perspective, we also clarify the connection between information and extractable work in the gas mixing processes. Our work opens a new avenue to reconsider the role of information in statistical mechanics.

Vacancy-ordered halide double perovskites Cs$_2BX_6$ have recently attracted significant attention due to their intrinsically ultralow lattice thermal conductivity ($κ_{\mathrm{L}}$), which is highly desirable for thermal insulation and thermoelectric applications. In this work, we systematically investigate the anharmonic lattice dynamics and thermal transport properties of Cs$_2BX_6$ ($B$ = Zr, Pd, Sn, Te, Hf, and Pt; $X$ = Cl, Br, and I) using state-of-the-art first-principles calculations, based on a unified theory of thermal transport for crystals and glasses. All studied compounds are found to exhibit ultralow $κ_{\mathrm{L}}$ below 1.0~W\,m$^{-1}$\,K$^{-1}$ at room temperature and large derivation from the conventional $T^{-1}$ temperature dependence. Our analysis combining with machine-learning approach show that low sound velocities (1100 -- 1600~m\,s$^{-1}$), which originates from the intrinsically weak chemical bonding, play a crucial role in suppressing heat transport of the most compounds, instead of the strong scattering of rattling phonon modes expected from the large void in the structure. Furthermore, the influence of $B$ and $X$-site elements on phonon dispersion, anharmonicity, and scattering phase space is clarified. Our results provide microscopic insights into the origin of ultralow $κ_{\mathrm{L}}$ in Cs$_2BX_6$ and offer guiding principles for the rational design of halide-based materials with tailored thermal transport properties.

- **TL;DR**: 论文发现了一种4e拓扑超导体，通过结合电荷4e凝聚态和ℤ₃拓扑序，克服了传统Majorana平台的限制，能实现通用量子计算。

Topological superconductors (TSCs) provide a promising route to fault-tolerant quantum information processing. However, the canonical Majorana platform based on $2e$ TSCs remains computationally constrained. In this work, we find a $4e$ TSC that overcomes these constraints by combining a charge-$4e$ condensate with an Abelian chiral $\mathbb{Z}_3$ topological order in an intertwined fashion. Remarkably, this $4e$ TSC can be obtained by proliferating vortex-antivortex pairs in a stack of two $2e$ $p+ip$ TSCs, or by melting a $ν=2/3$ quantum Hall state. Specific to this TSC, the $hc/(4e)$ fluxes act as charge-conjugation defects in the topological order, whose braiding with anyons transmutes anyons into their antiparticles. This symmetry enrichment leads to $\mathbb{Z}_3$ parafermion zero modes trapped in the elementary vortex cores, which naturally encode qutrits. Braiding the parafermion defects alone generates the full many-qutrit Clifford group. We further show that a simple single-probe interferometric measurement enables topologically protected magic-state preparation, promoting Clifford operations to a universal gate set. Importantly, the non-Abelian excitations in the $4e$ TSC are confined to externally controlled defects, making them uniquely identifiable and amenable to controlled creation and motion with superconducting-circuit technology. Our results establish hierarchical electron aggregation as a complementary principle for engineering topological quantum matter with enhanced computational power.

Twisted bilayers, featuring interfacial ferroelectricity in the form of array of polar domains, combined with incommensurate two-dimensional layers in a single van der Waals heterostructures allows for generation of purely electrostatic moiré superlattice potentials in the latter. We study electronic and optoelectronic properties of such heterostructures composed of graphene stacked with the twisted ferroelectric bilayers and show that doping of graphene substantially affects mini-band structures because of screening of free carriers. We demonstrate that formation of van Hove singularities in density of states modifies linear and second-order responses of the structures leading to resonant absorption and linear photovoltaic effect, respectively. The latter is generated solely by a shift photocurrent, arising only with account of virtual optical transitions, whereas an injection photocurrent is forbidden by symmetry.

The Landauer principle establishes a fundamental lower bound on the energetic cost of the erasure of a one-bit memory in thermal equilibrium. Here, we experimentally demonstrate how this bound can be effectively circumvented by introducing a hysteresis in the feedback-generated virtual potential of a micro-resonator acting as the information bit. By tuning the hysteresis, we engineer a non-equilibrium steady state with an adjustable effective temperature, enabling erasure processes that consume over 20 percents below the Landauer bound. Our results reveal that the hysteresis acts as an embedded Maxwell demon, exploiting temporal and spatial information to reduce the system's entropy and the thermodynamic transformation cost. This approach provides a versatile platform for exploring the interplay between feedback, information, and energy in stochastic systems.

$Lu_2S_3$ material from the family of sesquisulfide hosts appears to be a promising low-phonon material for use as a laser gain medium allowing for a laser emission over a broad spectral range from ultraviolet to far mid-infrared wavelengths. In this paper, a praseodymium-ion doped $Lu_2S_3$ single crystal grown by micro-pulling down technique is investigated with focus on its spectroscopic properties. The Raman, excitation, and luminescence spectra are presented. By selective excitation of the main energy levels of $Pr^{3+}$-ions, 26 luminescence transitions of the $Pr:Lu_2S_3$ crystal spanning the 0.49 to 5.5 $μ$m wavelength range have been identified. The correct assignment of the observed luminescence spectra to the respective $Pr^{3+}$ energy-level transitions was confirmed by the calculation of the optimized squared reduced-matrix elements for the tensor operators U(k) and L + gS.

We theoretically investigate spin-valley-locked tunneling transport in a transition-metal dichalcogenide/ferromagnetic-insulator heterostructure under a perpendicular magnetic field, driven by the spin Seebeck effect. We demonstrate that spin-valley coupling together with the magnetic-field-induced valley-asymmetric Landau-level structure enables the generation of a valley-polarized spin current from valley-selective spin excitation. We compare the spin current and the valley-polarized spin current in the conduction and valence bands and clarify their distinct microscopic origins. We predict pronounced quantum oscillations of the valley-polarized spin current, providing a clear experimental signature of quantized valley states.

We consider the sixth-order convective-viscous Cahn-Hilliard equation, different from the standard fourth-order Cahn-Hilliard equation due to the modified expression for the thermodynamic potential. In such modified thermodynamic potential the coefficient at the square gradient term is order-parameter-dependent. It also contains the square of the Laplacian. This results in a sixth-order differential equation and additional nonlinear terms in the equation. We obtained several exact static- and traveling wave solutions and studied the dependence of solutions on the parameters of the system.

In this study, we report on the growth of ternary caesium lithium iodide ($Cs_2Li_3I_5$, CLI) bulk crystals, both undoped and doped with thallium (Tl) and indium (In), using the miniaturised vertical Bridgman method (mVB). X-ray Powder Diffraction (XRPD) confirmed the presence of the ternary CLI phase in all three crystals, with CLI : In appearing homogeneous structure-wise throughout the entire ingot. Measurements of radioluminescence (RL), photoluminescence emission (PL), photoluminescence excitation (PLE) spectra, and photoluminescence decay kinetics (PL decay) demonstrated that the primary luminescence centers originate from the matrix itself. When doped with thallium, the efficiency of the luminescence was significantly increased. Furthermore, CLI : Tl and CLI : In crystals exhibited emission spectra similar to those of their doped caesium iodide counterparts, CsI : Tl and CsI : In, respectively. The main component of the PL decay was 523 ns, 557 ns, and 554 ns for the undoped, Tl+-doped, and In+-doped crystals, respectively. It is worthy of note that only CLI : Tl exhibited a single exponential decay. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) measurements revealed two endothermic peaks corresponding to the eutectic and liquidus temperature for CLI and CLI : In, indicating that this ternary compound has a congruent melting behaviour. Finally, the melting point of CLI was estimated to be approximately 220 °C.

The emergence of the terahertz (THz) ratchet effect is a rapidly expanding field of research that utilizes broken spatial symmetry in low-dimensional materials to rectify alternating current (AC) induced by THz fields into direct current (DC). This mechanism is highly promising for next-generation, room-temperature terahertz applications, particularly in high-speed, sensitive detection and imaging. In this work, we explore a ratchet effect generated in two dimensional tellurene, a novel promising semiconductor material consisting of helical atomic chains, creating a structure with inherent chirality. As a key result, the DC circular ratchet current flowing in the chiral axis direction $c$ is determined by the helicity of the radiation and can be reversed by switching the helicity from right to left handed. The circular ratchet effect excited by THz laser radiation is demonstrated for room temperature. The effect is demonstrated at various gate voltages when the Fermi level lies in vicinity of the Weyl point in the conduction band, in the band gap, and in the valence band with almost parabolic energy dispersion. The results are described by the developed microscopic theory based on the Boltzmann kinetic equation approach.

### Second law of thermodynamics in closed quantum many-body systems

The second law of thermodynamics for adiabatic operations -- constraints on state transitions in closed systems under external control -- is one of the fundamental principles of thermodynamics. On the other hand, it is recently established that even pure quantum states can represent thermal equilibrium. However, pure quantum states do not satisfy the second law in that they are not passive, i.e., work can be extracted from them if arbitrary unitary operations are allowed. It therefore remains unresolved how quantum mechanics can be reconciled with thermodynamics. Here, based on our key quantum-mechanical notions of thermal equilibrium and adiabatic operations, we address the emergence of the second law for adiabatic operations in the thermodynamics limit. We first introduce infinite-observable macroscopic thermal equilibrium (iMATE); a quantum state, including pure states, is in iMATE if the expectation values of all additive observables agree with their equilibrium values. We also introduce a macroscopic operation as unitary evolution generated by a time-dependent additive Hamiltonian, which is regarded as corresponding to adiabatic operations. Employing these concepts, we show that no extensive work can be extracted from any quantum state in iMATE through any macroscopic operations. Furthermore, we introduce a quantum-mechanical form of entropy density such that it agrees with thermodynamic entropy density for any quantum state in iMATE. We then prove that for any initial state in iMATE, this entropy density cannot be decreased by any macroscopic operations, followed by a time-independent relaxation process. Our theory thus proves two different forms of the second law, by adopting macroscopically reasonable classes of observables, equilibrium states, and operations. We also discuss the time scales of macroscopic operations in these results.

In recent years, hybrid organic-inorganic metal halides have been at the forefront of materials research. Typically, the functional (e.g., optoelectronic) properties of hybrid halides are derived from the inorganic structural part, whereas the organic structural units can add extra advantages in terms of stability, rigidity, and processability. Here, we report the design, synthesis, and characterization of two new hybrid materials in which the outstanding photophysical properties originate from the organic structural part. The new compounds, (C15H16N)2CdCl4 and ((Br)C15H15N)2CdCl4, have 2D layered Ruddlesden-Poppertype perovskite structures. These hybrids are blue-white light emitters just like their corresponding pure organic salts, but with much improved emission efficiencies. Optical spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) studies confirm that photoemission comes from the trans-stilbene organic cations. The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) values of these new materials are among the highest known, 50.83 % and 26.60 % for (C15H16N)2CdCl4 and ((Br)C15H15N)2CdCl4, respectively. This is up to a 5-fold increase as compared to the light emission efficiency of the precursor salt C15H16NCl (PLQY of 10.33 %). Alongside their outstanding optical properties, their environmental and thermal stability allow their consideration for potential practical applications such as radiation detection. This work shows that hybrid metal halides can be compositionally and structurally engineered to have highly efficient photoemission originating from the organic components for fast scintillation applications.

We study Andreev-mediated transport and current fluctuations in interacting normal-superconducting quantum-dot systems. Using a generalized master equation based on real-time diagrammatics and full counting statistics, we compute the steady-state current, zero-frequency noise, and rate of entropy production in the large superconducting-gap limit. We show how Coulomb interactions modify Andreev-mediated transport by renormalizing resonant conditions and suppressing superconducting coherence, leading to a pronounced reduction of current precision even when average currents are only weakly affected. These effects are particularly evident at high temperatures, where conventional Coulomb-blockade features are thermally smeared while fluctuation properties remain highly sensitive. By analyzing thermodynamic uncertainty relations, we demonstrate that violations of the quantum bound present in the noninteracting regime are progressively reduced and eventually suppressed as interactions increase, whereas the recently proposed hybrid bound remains satisfied. Our results clarify how Coulomb interactions, and nonequilibrium fluctuations jointly determine transport properties in hybrid superconducting devices, and establish current precision as a robust benchmark for interacting Andreev transport beyond the noninteracting limit.

Ion implantation is a powerful approach for tuning the electrical properties of materials through controlled doping and defect engineering, with applications in thermoelectrics and microelectronics. Scandium nitride (ScN) is particularly sensitive to irradiation-induced disorder, with transport properties spanning several orders of magnitude and multiple conduction mechanisms involved. In this study, we investigate the evolution of electrical transport in epitaxial ScN thin films undergoing accumulated irradiation damage at an initial defect state. A phenomenological damage-accumulation model was successfully combined with temperature dependent resistivity and Hall effect measurements to elucidate the impact of defect buildup on electrical transport and to provide physically grounded, quantitative insight into the nature and accumulation of irradiation-induced defects. It reveals two distinct defects-generation regimes of electrically active defects. At low doses, direct-impact damage produces stable and isolated acceptor-type complex defects, (VSc-X) with VSc a scandium vacancy and X denoting residual impurities, leading to a gradual increase in resistivity. At higher doses, defect accumulation dominates through a multi-hit process, giving rise to point-defect buildup and carrier localization, resulting in hopping-dominated transport. This localized regime is thermally unstable and recovers upon low-temperature annealing. We further demonstrate that the residual defect landscape strongly influences both the critical dose for the metal-insulator transition and the localization strength: films grown on Al2O3 exhibit an earlier transition and weaker localization than those grown on MgO. These results highlight ion implantation as an effective route for engineering disorder-induced localization in ScN, with the initial film quality playing a decisive role.

We propose a set of optomagnonic logic elements based on the effect of optical magnetization switching via the non-thermal inverse Faraday effect induced by femtosecond laser pulses in nearly compensated iron-garnet film with uniaxial anisotropy. Two equilibrium states in such a film are separated by a potential barrier that might be overpassed if the femtosecond pulse fluence exceeds a threshold value, so that magnetization is reversed after the pulse action. The switching threshold depends strongly on the value of applied in-plane external magnetic field, and is different for the two initial magnetization states and two opposite optical pulse helicites. This makes it possible to perform optomagnonic non-thermal deterministic writing of a magnetic bit. Such switching mechanism can be used for realizing reconfigurable optomagnonic logic elements without thermal assistance. Logical operations are implemented by encoding inputs in the amplitude and helicity of the optical pulses, while outputs are written as the magnetization state. The study demonstrates a pathway towards heating-free optomagnonic logic and memory devices.

Cs$_2$KInI$_6$ is a promising lead-free halide double perovskite with a calculated direct band gap of 1.24 eV, ideal for solar cell applications. Our first-principles calculations reveal that its cubic phase (Fm$\bar{3}$m) is dynamically unstable. Using an accelerated machine learning approach, we identify 42 dynamically stable structures and further validate these findings using first principles calculations on 11 of these. The most stable phase has Cmc$2_1$ symmetry with 20 atoms/unit cell. It lies 41.9 meV/atom below the cubic reference but lacks octahedral cation coordination. The most stable perovskite-like structure has P$\bar{3}$ symmetry with 10 atoms/unit cell and low octahedral connectivity. Structure-property trade-offs are highlighted, with calculated distortions generally widening the band gap, shifting it from direct to indirect, and flattening the band edges. This work showcases the synergy of genetic algorithms, machine-learned potentials, and first-principles validation for discovering stable, complex materials.
