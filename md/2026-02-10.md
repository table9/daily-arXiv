- **TL;DR**: 研究通过结合高能X射线衍射显微镜和晶体塑性有限元模拟，探索了在保证晶粒平均响应预测准确性的前提下，如何最小化计算成本所需的模拟条件。

Combined high-energy X-ray diffraction microscopy (HEDM) and crystal plasticity finite element (CPFE) modeling studies have emerged as a preferred paradigm to shed insight into the evolution of elasticity and plasticity at the intragrain scale of polycrystals. In particular, far-field HEDM measures the deformation response of upwards of thousands of individual grains simultaneously in situ during mechanical loading, though measurements are primarily limited, however, to the average state of each grain -- i.e., the grain's full strain tensor, crystallographic orientation, spatial location and volume. CPFE is utilized to shed information on the intragrain deformation response, via the sub-discretization of each grain into many finite elements, though the direct point of comparison to HEDM remains the grain-averaged response. We thus seek to find the minimum simulation conditions necessary to provide consistent grain-averaged predictions in an attempt to limit computational cost. In this study, we perform a suite of simulations and systematically study the effects of mesh density and boundary conditions, and consider different materials. We discuss these results and show that accurate prediction of grain-averaged elastic strains in a given region of interest typically requires a mesh with 250 elements per grain on average and a buffer layer of at least three grains between the region of interest and the control surfaces.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究发现手性钙钛矿薄膜的圆二色性信号受到线性二色性和线性双折射效应的显著影响，晶体取向对CD光谱的正确解读至关重要。

Chiral perovskites owing to their broken mirror symmetry exhibit selective absorption of circularly polarized light manifesting a strong circular dichroism (CD). CD spectroscopy has been a key technique to understand chiral perovskites and how these semiconductors achieve chirality at the molecular level. However, there is a debate on whether the observed CD is intrinsic to the chiral crystal structures or is modulated by extrinsic phenomena particularly linear dichroism (LD) and linear birefringence (LB) effects. This work investigates the chiroptical properties of $(R-/S-\text{MBA})_2\mathrm{CuCl}_4$ (MBA = Methylbenzyl ammonium) series by thoroughly studying the contribution from LD and LB to the observed CD signals. The comparison of highly oriented and randomly oriented films exhibits notable LD and LB contributions to the observed CD, which are caused by orientation-dependent electric-field interactions and local anisotropy. Both randomly and highly oriented films exhibit distinct CD responses, with LD--LB effects largely dominating the CD in highly oriented films. This has been revealed by the obvious shift in the observed CD signals to the below-absorption-edge ($\sim 430$ nm) regime and broadening of features. Our findings demonstrate that careful consideration of crystal orientation and structural effects is necessary for appropriate interpretation of CD spectra in chiral perovskite thin films.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种用于非晶聚合物变形和失效行为的几何非线性连续介质力学理论，该模型能够捕捉冲击压缩、非弹性、熔化、分解和层裂等多种加载条件下的材料响应。

A geometrically nonlinear continuum mechanical theory is formulated for deformation and failure behaviors of amorphous polymers. The model seeks to capture material response over a range of loading rates, temperatures, and stress states encompassing shock compression, inelasticity, melting, decomposition, and spallation. Thermoelasticity, viscoelasticity, viscoplasticity, ductile failure with localized shear yielding, and brittle fracture with crazing can all emerge under this ensemble of intense loading conditions. Known prior theories have considered one or more, but not all, such physical mechanisms. The present coherent formulation invokes thermodynamics with internal state variables for dynamic molecular and network configurational changes affecting viscoelasticity and plastic deformation, and it uses order parameters for more abrupt structural changes across state-dependent glass-transition and shock-decomposition thresholds. A phase-field order parameter captures material degradation from ductile or brittle fracture, including evolving porosity from crazing. The theory is applied toward polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) under intense dynamic loading. The high-pressure equilibrium response, with shear strength and temperature over known ranges, is well represented along the principal Hugoniot to pressures far exceeding shock decomposition. Predicted release wave velocities agree with experiment. A semi-analytical solution for steady waves describes the relatively lower-pressure viscoelastic setting, providing insight into relaxation times. One-dimensional calculations assess suitability of the model for representing spall fracture strengths seen in experiments over a range of initial temperatures and loading rates.

The development of structural materials capable of sustained operation above 1200 °C is critical for next-generation energy and aerospace systems; however, Ni-based superalloys are fundamentally constrained by their melting temperatures, while conventional Nb-based refractory alloys are limited by modest specific strength and high cost. Here, we report on the design and mechanical performance of a cost-effective, non-equiatomic refractory complex concentrated alloy (RCCA), Nb45Ta15Ti20V20, engineered to overcome these limitations. Specifically, its specific strength surpasses wrought C-103 and rivals additively manufactured (AM) C-103 at temperatures up to 1300 °C while maintaining extensive room temperature tensile ductility (&gt;10 %). Coupled with a high melting point (~2167 °C), reduced density (8.67 g/cc), and a raw material cost of ~$130/kg compared to &gt;$500/kg for wrought C-103 and &gt;$2,500/kg for AM C-103, this alloy delivers superior specific strength-cost efficiency, highlighting the promise of non-equiatomic RCCAs as viable alternatives to commercial refractory alloys.

- **TL;DR**: MnSi中斯格明子晶格的磁激发在相变温度以上仍保持非互易特性，实验表明从斯格明子相到顺磁相的转变是平滑的。

The magnetic excitations of the skyrmion lattice in MnSi comprise a multitude of individual modes, which are non-reciprocal and thereby propagate unidirectionally. We report inelastic neutron scattering experiments for temperatures near and above the skyrmion-paramagnetic phase transition in the chiral magnet MnSi tracking the evolution from the skyrmion lattice towards the high-temperature paramagnetic state. Within the resolution of the triple-axis measurements the excitations vary smoothly across the skyrmion-paramagnetic boundary, and, the quasi-elastic paramagnetic signal under applied field retains the non-reciprocal character seen in the skyrmion phase even far above the critical temperature. Using a resolution-convolution our results are consistent with linear spin-wave theory.

Symbolic Regression (SR) enables the discovery of interpretable mathematical relationships from experimental and simulation data. These relationships are often coined descriptors which are defined as a fundamental materials property that is directly correlated to a desired or undesired functional property of the material. Although established approaches such as Sure Independence Screening and Sparsifying Operator (SISSO) have successfully identified low-dimensional descriptors within large feature spaces many existing SR tools integrate poorly with modern Python workflows, offer limited control over the symbolic search space, or struggle with the computational demands of large-scale studies. This paper introduces DISCOVER (Data-Informed Symbolic Combination of Operators for Variable Equation Regression), an open-source symbolic regression package developed to address these challenges through a modular, physics-motivated design. DISCOVER allows users to guide the symbolic search using domain knowledge, constrain the feature space explicitly, and take advantage of optional GPU acceleration to improve computational efficiency in data-intensive workflows, enabling reproducible and scalable SR workflows. The software is intended for applications in computational physics, computational chemistry, and materials science, where interpretability, physical consistency, and execution time are especially important, and it complements general-purpose SR frameworks by emphasizing the discovery of physically meaningful models.

- **TL;DR**: LatentChem：一种将化学推理从文本生成中解耦的潜在推理接口，让模型在连续潜在空间中进行多步推理，仅用语言输出最终结果，显著提升推理效率和性能。

Chemical large language models (LLMs) predominantly rely on explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) in natural language to perform complex reasoning. However, chemical reasoning is inherently continuous and structural, and forcing it into discrete linguistic tokens introduces a fundamental representation mismatch that constrains both efficiency and performance. We introduce LatentChem, a latent reasoning interface that decouples chemical computation from textual generation, enabling models to perform multi-step reasoning directly in continuous latent space while emitting language only for final outputs. Remarkably, we observe a consistent emergent behavior: when optimized solely for task success, models spontaneously internalize reasoning, progressively abandoning verbose textual derivations in favor of implicit latent computation. This shift is not merely stylistic but computationally advantageous. Across diverse chemical reasoning benchmarks, LatentChem achieves a 59.88\% non-tie win rate over strong CoT-based baselines on ChemCoTBench, while delivering a 10.84$\times$ average inference speedup. Our results provide empirical evidence that chemical reasoning is more naturally and effectively realized as continuous latent dynamics rather than discretized linguistic trajectories.

- **TL;DR**: 提出一种推挤随机行走模型，其中行走者可以推动多个障碍物，从而在高密度障碍环境中实现长距离穿透，更真实地模拟实验观测到的活性粒子在稠密介质中的相互作用。

We introduce the pushy random walk, where a walker can push multiple obstacles, thereby penetrating large distances in environments with finite obstacle density. This process gives a more realistic depiction of experimentally observed interactions of active particles in dense media. In one dimension, the walker carves out an obstacle-free cavity whose length grows subdiffusively over time. In two dimensions, increasing obstacle density drives a transition from free diffusion to localized behavior, where the walker is trapped within a cavity whose radius again grows subdiffusively with time.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究首次构建了PrFeAsO1-xFx铁基超导体的完整电子相图，发现超导区域呈圆顶状分布，最高Tc达52.3K，揭示了结构-性质关联和强超导涨落特征。

Establishing a complete electronic phase diagram for REFeAsO (RE = rare earth, RE1111) ironbased superconductors has remained experimentally challenging. Here, we report a systematic investigation of PrFeAsO1-xFx over the full nominal fluorine-doping range 0 to 1 and construct the first comprehensive electronic phase diagram for this system. The evolution from the nonsuperconducting parent compound to the fluorine-rich limit reveals a broad dome shaped superconducting region. Structural refinement demonstrates a systematic lattice contraction with increasing fluorine content (x), corroborated by Raman spectroscopy through softening of the Pr(A1g) phonon mode and hardening of the Fe(B1g) mode, confirming effective fluorine incorporation at the oxygen sites. The maximum superconducting transition temperature (Tc) reaches up to 52.3 K, approximately 5 K higher than previous reports for Pr1111. Magnetotransport measurements yield large upper critical fields Hc2(0) exceeding 100 T, while analysis of resistive transition broadening reveals thermally activated flux flow with a crossover from single-vortex to collective pinning regimes. Specific-heat measurements exhibit a reduced jump deltaC/γTc &lt; 1.43, reflecting strong superconducting fluctuations and multiband pairing. These results establish clear structure property correlations and provide a unified description of superconductivity across the entire doping range of the Pr1111 system.

- **TL;DR**: 量子电磁场涨落导致固体中额外的零点能，该能量与体积成正比，并产生可测量的量子几何力

We show that quantum fluctuations of electromagnetic fields induce an additional zero-point energy in solids, which scales with the volume. For insulators, the zero-point energy density is proportional to quantum fluctuation of electric polarization in the many-body ground state, a fundamental quantum geometric property of solids known as the quantum weight. Although the zero-point energy does not affect the dynamics of the electromagnetic fields, when the fields are produced by a superconducting LC circuit, the zero-point energy contributes to a repulsive force between the circuit and the material. In addition, since zero-point energy depends on the circuit's capacitor, it yields a measurable static force acting on the capacitor plates, which we call quantum geometric force. The proposed effects provide direct experimental access to the many-body quantum geometry and reveal a new macroscopic quantum effect in solids induced by vacuum fluctuation.

### The impact of spurious imaginary phonon modes on thermal properties of Metal-organic Frameworks

- **TL;DR**: 研究发现MOFs声子计算中的虚假虚频模式会显著影响热容估计，导致材料筛选排序错误，并提出了快速后处理校正方法。

Metal-organic Frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as potential candidates for direct air capture (DAC) of green house gases and water. Thermal properties of MOFs, such as their heat capacity, are used to determine the energy penalty associated with the adsorbent retrieval during the Temperature Swing Adsorption process. To aid exploration of the vast experimental design space of MOFs for such applications, computational methods like Density Functional Theory (DFT) or surrogate machine learning models trained on DFT data have been developed for obtaining phonon-derived heat capacities of MOFs. However, the high cost of explicit phonon computation in large and flexible nanoporous MOFs often necessitates the use of small supercells or lower convergence criteria which decrease predictive accuracy. These approximations often result in spurious imaginary phonon modes which are commonly ignored in practice. At present, there is no clear consensus in the literature on what magnitude of negative frequency or what fraction of imaginary modes can be considered acceptable. Here, we systematically demonstrate that spurious imaginary phonon modes can introduce substantial errors in heat capacity estimates, leading to incorrect ranking of MOFs in thermal-property-based screening. We further show that benchmarking machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) against DFT datasets containing spurious imaginary modes can misrepresent models that predict physically meaningful phonon spectra for dynamically stable MOFs. Finally, we introduce a simple, rapid post-processing workflow that can be applied to standard phonon calculations to effectively correct heat capacity estimates and account for spurious imaginary modes in MOFs.

- **TL;DR**: 首次结合ARPES和DFT研究Sr₃Ru₂O₇薄膜的低能电子能带结构，发现不同衬底应变导致费米面拓扑显著变化，并观察到平带特征可能形成van Hove奇点。

We report the first combined study of the low-energy electronic band structure of epitaxial Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ films using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and density functional theory (DFT). The complete Fermi-surface topography of the near-Fermi-level bands is determined from in-situ ARPES measurements. To investigate the effects of substrate-induced strain on the band structure, Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ thin films are epitaxially grown on SrTiO$_3$ (STO) and (LaAlO$_{3}$)$_{0.3}$(Sr$_{2}$TaAlO$_{6}$)$_{0.7}$ (LSAT) substrates using molecular beam epitaxy. The combination of the measured Fermi-surfaces along with the theoretical interpretation, clearly show dramatic changes in the Fermi surface topologies that result from the underlying strain states of the films on the two substrates. We find that the Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ films prepared on STO are tensile strained with tetragonal symmetry, whereas those grown on LSAT are compressively strained with orthorhombic symmetry. Within $\sim15~\text{meV}$ below the Fermi level, we observe two flat bands along $Γ$-$X$ in the orthorhombic phase and around $Γ$ in the tetragonal phase. These features could be favorable for van Hove singularities near the Fermi level, and highlight the emergence of magnetic instabilities in epitaxial Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ films.

diffpy.morph addresses a need to gain scientific insights from 1D scientific spectra in model independent ways. A powerful approach for this is to take differences between pairs of spectra and look for meaningful changes that might indicate underlying chemical, structural, or other modifications. The challenge is that the difference curve may contain uninteresting differences such as experimental inconsistencies and benign physical changes such as the effects of thermal expansion. diffpy.morph allows researchers to apply simple transformations, or "morphs", to one of the datasets to remove the unwanted differences revealing, when they are present, non-trivial differences. diffpy.morph is an open-source Python package available on the Python Package Index and conda-forge. Here, we describe its functionality and apply it to solve a range of experimental challenges on diffraction and PDF data from x-rays and neutrons, though we note that it may be applied to any 1D function in principle.

Various representation learning methods for molecular structures have been devised to accelerate data-driven chemistry. However, the representation capabilities of existing methods are essentially limited to atom-level information, which is not sufficient to describe real-world molecular physics. Although electron-level information can provide fundamental knowledge about chemical compounds beyond the atom-level information, obtaining the electron-level information in real-world molecules is computationally impractical and sometimes infeasible. We propose a method for learning electron-informed molecular representations without additional computation costs by transferring readily accessible electron-level information about small molecules to large molecules of our interest. The proposed method achieved state-of-the-art prediction accuracy on extensive benchmark datasets containing experimentally observed molecular physics. The source code for HEDMoL is available at https://github.com/ngs00/HEDMoL.

We investigate the six-state clock universality of the Ising model on the kagome lattice, considering antiferromagnetic nearest-neighbor (NN) and ferromagnetic next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) interactions. Our comprehensive study employs three approaches: the level-spectroscopy method, Monte Carlo simulations, and a machine-learning phase classification technique. In this system, we observe two Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transitions. We present a phase diagram consisting of three phases: the low-temperature ordered phase with sublattice magnetizations, the intermediate BKT phase, and the high-temperature disordered phase, as a function of the ratio of the NNN interaction to the NN interaction. We verify the six-state clock universality through the machine-learning study, which uses data from the six-state clock model on the kagome lattice for training.

- **TL;DR**: 量子限域效应和邻近效应可能诱导块体非超导金属（如贵金属和s区元素）在纳米尺度产生超导性，但仅在特定厚度窗口（约0.4-0.6nm）出现。

Elemental good metals, including noble metals (Cu, Ag, Au) and several $s$-block elements, do not exhibit superconductivity in bulk at ambient pressure, primarily due to weak electron--phonon coupling that fails to overcome Coulomb repulsion. In this perspective, we examine whether quantum confinement alone, or in combination with proximity effects, can induce an observable superconducting instability in metals that are non-superconducting in bulk form. We review recent theoretical progress and present a unified framework based on a confinement-generalized, isotropic one-band Eliashberg theory, in which the normal density of states becomes energy dependent and key material parameters ($E_F$, $λ$, and $μ^{*}$) acquire an explicit thickness dependence. By numerically solving the resulting Eliashberg equations using ab-initio or experimentally determined electron--phonon spectral functions $α^{2}F(Ω)$ and Coulomb pseudopotentials $μ^{*}$, and without introducing adjustable parameters, we compute the critical temperature $T_c$ as a function of film thickness for representative noble, alkali, and alkaline-earth metals. The theory predicts that superconductivity can emerge only in selected cases and within extremely narrow thickness windows, typically centered around sub-nanometer scales ($L \sim 0.4$--$0.6$~nm). We further discuss layered superconductor/normal-metal systems, where quantum confinement and proximity effects coexist. In these heterostructures, a substantial enhancement of the critical temperature is predicted, even when the constituent materials are non-superconducting or poor superconductors in bulk form.

### Microscopic origin of Rashba coupling from first principles: Layer-resolved orbital asymmetry in transition metal dichalcogenides

Spin-orbit coupling in two-dimensional materials gives rise to a Rashba spin splitting when inversion and mirror symmetries are broken, yet its microscopic origin and quantitative characterization in transition metal dichalcogenides remains incomplete. Both symmetries are broken in certain bilayer structures, enabling Rashba splittings in the absence of external electric fields. We determine this zero-field offset and the Rashba parameters that dictate the spin splitting in the linear regime. Surprisingly, the splitting is substantially smaller in bilayers than in monolayers at typical fields. This is clarified within a perturbative microscopic model, revealing that the spin splitting results from a competition between internal polarization and interlayer hybridization. We further introduce the orbital polarization imbalance as an order parameter that captures the asymmetry of the valence bands and determines the spin ordering of the Rashba-split states. Our results are both quantitative and qualitative, as they clarify the nature and origin of Rashba coupling in transition metal dichalcogenides.

Ensemble Density Functional Theory (EDFT) is a promising extension to Density Functional Theory (DFT) for calculating excited states. While Kohn-Sham eigenvalue differences underestimate gaps, EDFT has been shown to provide more accurate excitation energies in atoms, molecules and isolated model systems. However, it is unclear whether EDFT is capable of calculating band gaps of periodic systems -- and what an appropriate theoretical formulation would be to describe periodic systems. We explored how EDFT could calculate band gaps by estimating the thermodynamic limit with increasingly wide finite versions of the one-dimensional Kronig-Penney (KP) periodic model. We use Octopus, an ab initio, open-source, real-space DFT code, as in our previous work [R. J. Leano et al., Electron. Struct. 6, 035003 (2024)] in which we found with "particle in a box" models that EDFT can provide a reasonable effective mass correction for the homogeneous electron gas. Now, we use a periodic reference that is gapped. We find that the finite systems' Kohn-Sham gap approaches the same periodic limit for each of three ways of terminating the finite system, though the appropriate states corresponding to the valence band maximum and conduction band minimum have to be carefully identified in each case. Finally, our EDFT results, using a simple ensemblized LDA approximation, have a reasonable nonzero correction to the bandgap in the periodic limit. The results indicate that EDFT is promising for periodic systems, to motivate further work on developing a suitable formalism.

- **TL;DR**: 2009年Bernard等人通过放弃细致平衡条件、采用全局平衡原则，提出了事件链蒙特卡洛算法，实现了硬球系统的无拒绝确定性采样，开创了蒙特卡洛采样的新范式。

The seminal 2009 paper by Bernard, Krauth, and Wilson marked a paradigm shift in Monte Carlo sampling. By abandoning the restrictive condition of detailed balance in favor of the more fundamental principle of global balance, they introduced the Event-Chain Monte Carlo (ECMC) algorithm, which achieves rejection-free, deterministic sampling for hard spheres. This breakthrough demonstrated that persistent, directional dynamics could dramatically accelerate equilibration in dense particle systems. In this commentary, we review this foundational work and elucidate its underlying mechanism using the broader Event-Driven Monte Carlo (EDMC) framework developed in subsequent years. We show how the original hard-sphere concept naturally generalizes to continuous potentials and modern lifted Markov chain formalisms, transforming a surprising specific result into a powerful general class of sampling algorithms.

Transition Metal Complexes (TMCs) have wide-ranging practical utility in chemistry, with possible applications that range from catalysis to medicinal chemistry. The study of TMCs and their properties is thus a field rich with potential, one in which machine learning and computational approaches can offer a substantial aid. For this reason, appropriate and accessible datasets, collecting a wide range of information, are required in order to facilitate the effective analysis and investigation of such compounds. This paper contributes to the data modelling effort via the introduction of the transition metal quantum mechanics RDF (tmQM-RDF) dataset, a knowledge graph constructed using the Resource Description Framework (RDF) vocabulary which collects rich and detailed descriptions of approximately 50k TMCs. These descriptions are both qualitative and quantitative in nature, encompassing the compositional nature of TMCs in terms of their constituting ligands, as well as the entirety of their molecular graphs. An example of the power of the proposed representation is presented, showcasing how the information available in tmQM-RDF can be exploited for TMC manipulation tasks, achieving promising performance even with relatively simple probabilistic models.

- **TL;DR**: 提出基于流形的分数生成模型框架，用于连续自旋系统的生成建模，在64x64二维XY模型上准确捕捉BKT相变和热力学量，实现零样本泛化到不同晶格尺寸。

The application of generative modeling to many-body physics offers a promising pathway for analyzing high-dimensional state spaces of spin systems. However, unlike computer vision tasks where visual fidelity suffices, physical systems require the rigorous reproduction of higher-order statistical moments and thermodynamic quantities. While Score-Based Generative Models (SGMs) have emerged as a powerful tool, their standard formulation on Euclidean embedding space is ill-suited for continuous spin systems, where variables inherently reside on a manifold. In this work, we demonstrate that training on the Euclidean space compromises the model's ability to learn the target distribution as it prioritizes to learn the manifold constraints. We address this limitation by proposing the use of Manifold-Aware Score-Based Generative Modeling framework applied to the 64x64 2D XY model (a 4096-dimensional torus). We show that our method estimates the theoretical Boltzmann score with superior precision compared to standard diffusion models. Consequently, we successfully capture the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz Thouless (BKT) phase transition and accurately reproduce second-moment quantities, such as heat capacity without explicit feature engineering. Furthermore, we demonstrate zero-shot generalization to unseen lattice sizes, accurately recovering the physics of variable system scales without retraining. Since this approach bypasses domain-specific feature engineering, it remains intrinsically generalizable to other continuous spin systems.

Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnets have emerged as a critical class of quantum materials for next-generation, low-dimensional spintronic devices. In this study, we report a comprehensive study of the transport properties of the layered soft ferromagnet $\text{NbFeTe}_2$. We report the first observation of the topological Hall effect (THE) and the planar Hall effect (PHE) in metallic $\text{NbFeTe}_2$. THE signatures persist up to 45 K, while PHE remains evident well above Curie temperature ($T_C$). The observed negative longitudinal magnetoresistance, along with the PHE, provides strong evidence for a nontrivial electronic band structure. The coexistence of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and a substantial THE: two key properties that are highly desirable for future spintronics applications, makes monoclinic vdW ferromagnetic $\text{NbFeTe}_2$ a promising platform to advance spintronics applications.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究比较了Majorana/准Majorana束缚态与零能Andreev束缚态在光子辅助隧穿噪声上的差异，发现前者在特定直流偏压下出现符号反转，而后者始终为负值。

Photon-assisted tunneling arises under an ac bias, with the drive frequency setting the photon energy. The excess photon-assisted noise is defined as the difference between the shot noise under a combined dc and ac bias and that under a dc bias alone. We investigate this quantity in tunneling into Majorana or Andreev bound states, which are of great interest in the search for topological superconductors. Under a harmonic bias $V(t)=V_\mathrm{dc}[1-\cos(Ωt)]$, the excess photon-assisted noise exhibits distinct behaviors: for Majorana or quasi-Majorana bound states, it undergoes multiple sign reversals as $V_\mathrm{dc}$ increases and vanishes at nonzero integer values of $eV_\mathrm{dc}/Ω$ (with $e$ the elementary charge), whereas for zero-energy Andreev bound states--particularly those producing nearly quantized zero-bias conductance peaks--it remains strictly negative over the entire $V_\mathrm{dc}$ range.

Topological magnetic lattices offer a fertile ground for exploring fundamental physics and developing novel spintronic devices. However, current research is predominantly confined to single-Q topologies hosting uniform type of quasiparticle. The realization of exotic mixed-Q states, where distinct topological quasiparticles co-assemble into an ordered lattice, remains largely unexplored. Here, we propose a generic mechanism to order disordered mixed-Q topological magnetism into periodic lattice via moire engineering. By leveraging the synergy between spatially modulated interlayer coupling and intrinsic intralayer magnetic frustration, we demonstrate that moire potential can effectively regularize skyrmions, antiskyrmions, and magnetic bubbles into a hybrid lattice. Combining first-principles with atomistic spin simulations, we validate this mechanism in twisted bilayer CrGaTe3, identifying it as an exemplary platform for hosting these complex ordered textures. We systematically map the phase evolution as a function of twist angle and biaxial strain, unveiling the critical role of moire potential in stabilizing mixed-Q lattice. Our findings significantly advance the frontier of topological and moire spintronics.

We investigated the local Co 3d electronic structure of Na2BaCo(PO4)2 using polarization-dependent X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) in combination with full multiplet cluster calculations. We employed the line-fitting inverse partial fluorescence yield (IPFY) technique to obtain accurate XAS spectra from strong insulating materials. Our combined experimental and theoretical analysis reveals a very small effective trigonal distortion of only 11 meV in the CoO6 octahedra, indicating a close to ideal condition to render a ground state with the Jeff = 1/2 character. With our cluster model we were also able to simulate magnetic susceptibility measurements along different directions in the crystal. These findings highlight Na2BaCo(PO4)2 as a promising platform for exploring exotic magnetic phenomena associated with Jeff = 1/2 ground states on triangular lattices.

- **TL;DR**: 压缩感知技术应用于中子学蒙特卡洛模拟，通过重叠单元收集计数，实现高精度重建并大幅减少内存需求，2D/3D重建分别达到81.25%/96.25%的内存缩减。

Monte Carlo simulations of neutronic systems are computationally intensive and demand significant memory resources for high-fidelity modeling. Compressed sensing enables accurate reconstruction of signals from significantly fewer samples than traditional methods. The specific implementation of compressed sensing investigated here involves the use of overlapping cells to collect tallies. Increasing the number of samples improves the reconstruction accuracy, although the marginal gains diminish with more samples. Reconstruction quality is strongly influenced by the sparsity parameter used in basis pursuit denoising. Across the three test cases considered, memory reductions of up to 81.25% (96.25%) are demonstrated for 2D (3D) reconstructions, with select scenarios achieving reconstruction errors within 1 standard deviation of the corresponding high-fidelity reference results.

- **TL;DR**: DCM-net是一种基于机器学习的方法，用于构建任意分辨率的分布式电荷模型，能够准确模拟分子静电势的各向异性，超越传统点电荷表示。

A machine learning (ML) based equivariant neural network for constructing distributed charge models (DCMs) of arbitrary resolution, DCM-net, is presented. DCMs efficiently and accurately model the anisotropy of the molecular electrostatic potential (ESP) and go beyond the point charge representation used in conventional molecular mechanics (MM) energy functions. This is particularly relevant for capturing the conformational dependence of the ESP (internal polarization) and chemically relevant features such as lone pairs or σ-holes. Across conformational space, the learned charge positions from DCM-net are stable and continuous. Across the QM9 chemical space, two-charge-per-atom models achieve accuracies comparable to fitted atomic dipoles for previously unseen molecules (0.75 (kcal/mol)/e). Three- and four-charge-per-atom models reach accuracies competitive with atomistic multipole expansions up to quadrupole level (0.55 (kcal/mol)/e). Pronounced improvements of the ESP are found around O and F atoms, both of which are known to feature strongly anisotropic fields, and for aromatic systems. Across the QM9 reference data set, molecular dipole moments improve by 0.1 D compared with fitted monopoles. Transfer learning on dipeptides yields a 0.2 (kcal/mol)/e ESP improvement for unseen samples and a two-fold MAE reduction for molecular dipole moments versus fitted monopoles. Overall, DCM-net offers a fast and physically meaningful approach to generating distributed charge models for running pure ML or mixed ML/MM based molecular simulations. level (0.55 (kcal/mol)/e).

- **TL;DR**: 该论文实现了两种物理嵌入的通用逻辑操作，使用耦合量子通量参量管构建的2比特逻辑单元，其中基于动量的擦除翻转操作在性能和速度上显著优于基于亚稳态的受控擦除操作。

We present implementations of two physically-embedded computation-universal logical operations using a 2-bit logical unit composed of coupled quantum flux parametrons -- Josephson-junction superconducting circuits. To illustrate universality, we investigate NAND gates built from these two distinct elementary operations. On the one hand, Controlled Erasure (CE) is designed using fixed-point analysis and assumes that information must be stored in locally-metastable distributions. On the other, Erasure-Flip (EF) leverages momentum as a computational resource and significantly outperforms the metastable approach, simultaneously achieving higher fidelity and faster computational speed without incurring any additional energetic cost. Notably, the momentum degree of freedom allows the EF to achieve universality by using both nontrivial reversible and irreversible logic simultaneously in different logical subspaces. These results not only provide a practical, high-performance protocol ripe for experimental realization but also underscore the broader potential of momentum-based computing paradigms.

- **TL;DR**: 金封装能显著改善铌薄膜的超导性能，降低量子退相干，但也会影响薄膜的整体性质，包括降低临界电流和穿透深度。

Niobium metal occupies nearly 100\% of the volume of a typical 2D transmon device. While the aluminum Josephson junction is of utmost importance, maintaining quantum coherence across the entire device means that pair-breaking in Nb leads, capacitive pads, and readout resonators can be a major source of decoherence. The established contributors are surface oxides and hydroxides, as well as absorbed hydrogen and oxygen. Metal encapsulation of freshly grown surfaces with non-oxidizing metals, preferably without breaking the vacuum, is a successful strategy to mitigate these issues. While the positive effects of encapsulation are undeniable, it is important to understand its impact on the macroscopic behavior of niobium films. We present a comprehensive study of the bulk superconducting properties of Nb thin films encapsulated with gold and palladium/gold, and compare them to those of bare Nb films. Magneto-optical imaging, magnetization, resistivity, and London and Campbell penetration depth measurements reveal significant differences in encapsulated samples. Both sputtered, and epitaxial Au-capped films exhibit the highest residual resistivity ratio and superconducting transition temperature, as well as the lowest upper critical field, London penetration depth, and critical current. These results are in good agreement with the microscopic theory of anisotropic normal and superconducting states of Nb. We conclude that pair-breaking in the bulk of niobium films, driven by disorder throughout the film rather than just at the surface, is a significant source of quantum decoherence in transmons. We also conclude that gold capping not only passivates the surface but also affects the properties of the entire film, significantly reducing the scattering rate due to defects likely induced by surface diffusion if the film is not protected immediately after fabrication.

A quantum anomalous Hall system is predicted to realize topological superconductivity when proximity-coupled to an $s$-wave superconductor. A kagome magnet with chiral magnetic ordering exhibits the quantum anomalous Hall effect; however, superconducting proximity to an ordinary $s$-wave superconductor fails to induce pairing in the strong exchange coupling limit. In this work, we demonstrate that proximity coupling to a Rashba superconductor gives rise to topological superconducting phases characterized by odd Bogoliubov-de Gennes Chern numbers. We confirmed their consistency with the chiral central charge calculated based on the modular commutator. We also show that the magnetic ordering of kagome magnets is affected energetically by the proximity effect.

Deep generative models have shown promise for modeling metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), but existing approaches (1) rely on coarse-grained representations that assume fixed bond lengths and angles, and (2) neglect the MOF-adsorbate interactions, which are critical for downstream applications. We introduce AtomMOF, a scalable flow-based model built on an all-atom Diffusion Transformer that maps 2D molecular graphs of building blocks and adsorbates directly to equilibrium 3D structures without imposing structural constraints. We further present scaling laws for porous crystal generation, indicating predictable performance gains with increased model capacity, and introduce Feynman-Kac steering guided by machine-learned interatomic potentials to improve geometric validity and sampling stability. On the (MOF-only) BW dataset, AtomMOF increases the match rate by 35.00% and reduces RMSD by 32.64%. On the ODAC25 dataset (MOF-adsorbate), AtomMOF is substantially more sample-efficient than grand canonical Monte Carlo in recovering adsorption configurations and can identify candidates with lower adsorption energies than the reference dataset.

Increasing precision in the growth of superlattices sparks hope in applications that may arise from engineering layered structures. Heterostructuring and functionalization of magnetic oxides have been very popular due to their versatility and readiness for integration in modern electronics. In this study, we provide yet another example of this phenomenology by predicting that an insulating ferromagnetic state can be realized in superlattices of LaMnO$_3$ and SrTiO$_3$ oriented along the (111) direction. In strike contrast with respect to other orientations, these properties are not of extrinsic origin but arise from the interplay of structural order, strain and quantum confinement. The bandgap is shown to be either direct and indirect, depending on the precise composition, which can be explained in terms of the geometrical properties of (111)-oriented bilayers of LaMnO$_3$. The electronic structure shows narrow bands indicating localized $e_g$ states for all the investigated superlattices. These features and the analysis of the inter-atomic magnetic coupling suggest that the investigated superlattices behave as a Kugel-Khomskii material, at least for the explored compositions. Our results provide not only a new route to an insulating ferromagnet, but also novel insight into the intricate interplay between lattice symmetry, Hubbard physics and Hund's coupling to be exploited in next-generation spintronic applications.

- **TL;DR**: 开发了dewi-kadita开源Python库，实现三维Couzin区域模型，引入7个信息熵指标和海洋集群指数(OSI)来量化鱼群集体运动的有序性，并通过Numba加速计算。

Collective motion in fish schools exemplifies emergent self-organization in active matter systems, yet computational tools for simulating and analyzing these dynamics remain fragmented across research groups. We present dewi-kadita, an open-source Python library implementing the three-dimensional Couzin zone-based model with comprehensive entropy diagnostics tailored for marine collective behavior research. The library introduces seven information-theoretic metrics -- school cohesion entropy, polarization entropy, depth stratification entropy, angular momentum entropy, nearest-neighbor entropy, velocity correlation entropy, and school shape entropy -- that characterize distinct organizational features inaccessible to classical order parameters. These metrics combine into an Oceanic Schooling Index (OSI) providing a single scalar measure of collective disorder. Validation across four canonical configurations (swarm, torus, dynamic parallel, highly parallel) confirms correct reproduction of known phase behaviors: the swarm maintains disorder with polarization $P &lt; 0.1$ and OSI $\approx 0.71$, while the highly parallel state achieves $P = 0.998$ with OSI $= 0.24$ and velocity correlation entropy vanishing to zero. The entropy framework successfully discriminates the torus and dynamic parallel configurations that exhibit comparable order parameter magnitudes through different organizational mechanisms. Numba just-in-time (JIT) compilation accelerates pairwise interaction calculations by $10$--$100\times$, enabling simulations of $150$--$250$ agents over $1000$--$2000$ time steps within five minutes on standard workstation hardware. NetCDF4 output ensures interoperability with oceanographic analysis tools. The library addresses the need for standardized, reproducible infrastructure in collective behavior modeling analogous to established molecular dynamics codes.

Many molecules' vibrational frequencies are sensitive to intermolecular electric fields, enabling them to probe the field in complex molecular environments. However, it is often unclear whether the probe is responding to the local electric field or other types of intermolecular interactions, inhibiting interpretation of the frequency and effectiveness as probes. This is especially true of molecules whose vibrational frequencies blueshift instead of the more typical redshift in hydrogen bonding configurations. Here we computationally investigate the causes of redshifting versus blueshifting over a range of vibrational reporters. First, we apply adiabatic energy decomposition analysis to a paradigmatic set of probes, finding that redshifting only occurs when electrostatic interactions are strong enough to overcome the dominant and large blueshifting contribution of Pauli repulsion. Furthermore, we demonstrate that field inhomogeneity can further shift the frequency of many probes substantially to either reinforce or counteract the shift expected from a homogeneous field. We find that redshifting is reinforced by electric field inhomogeneity, otherwise field inhomogeneity further weakens the electrostatic contribution relative to Pauli repulsion, leading to blueshifting. Further calculations indicate that the probe's response to field inhomogeneity can be understood by considering the mass of the atoms involved in the stretching mode and sign of the electric field. In explaining the interplay of different intermolecular interactions and field inhomogeneity for many probes, our results should enable the use and interpretation of spectroscopic probes and their connection to electric fields in more complex systems.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究通过场论重整化群和微扰自举方法，在双环水平上计算了具有长程相互作用的O(n)自旋模型的临界行为，发现当σ&lt;2时短程Wilson-Fisher固定点变得不稳定，而长程固定点稳定存在，临界指数是ε、δ=2-σ和n的函数。

The establishment of the Wilson-Fisher fixed point (WFP) for $O(n)$ spin models in $d=4-ε$ dimensions stands as a cornerstone of the renormalization group (RG) theory for critical phenomena. However, when long-range (LR) interactions, algebraically decaying as $\propto 1/r^{d+σ}$, are introduced, the fate of the short-range WFP (SR-WFP) has remained a subject of intense debate since the 1970s. We employ two complementary techniques -- the standard field-theoretic RG and a perturbative bootstrap scheme, and perform the $ε$-expansion calculations up to the two-loop level. We show that, as long as $σ&lt;2$, the SR-WFP becomes unstable and a stable LR-WFP emerges, and, in the non-classical regime with $d/2 &lt; σ&lt; 2$, the critical exponents, including the anomalous dimension, are functions of $ε$, $δ=2-σ$ and $n$, which reduce to the exact results in the limiting cases $ε\to 0$, $δ\to 0$ or $n \to \infty$. Our $(4-ε)$-expansion calculations support the scenario that the threshold between the LR- and SR-WFP occurs strictly at $σ_*=2$, well consistent with the recent high-precision numerical study while different from the widely accepted Sak's criterion.

The interplay between magnetic fluctuations and superconductivity is fundamental for understanding unconventional high-temperature superconductors. In the recently discovered Ruddlesden-Popper phase nickelates-which achieve superconducting transition temperatures up to ~100 K-this connection has been theoretically predicted but experimentally unverified. Using compressively strained La2SmNi2O7 thin films, we report direct evidence for this interplay. We observe a characteristic 'Mexican hat'-shaped magnetoresistance, a signature of superconductivity coexisting with emergent antiferromagnetic (AFM) fluctuations. This distinctive feature arises from a competition between the magnetic field's suppression of AFM fluctuation-driven scattering and its suppression of superconducting fluctuations. We quantify these AFM fluctuations by a crossover field, B*, whose magnitude decreases with increasing temperature and vanishes near the superconducting onset-behavior contrasting sharply with that in high-Tc cuprates. Our results establish not merely coexistence, but also a direct and novel correlation between AFM instability and superconductivity in nickelates, offering crucial insight into their pairing mechanism.

### Theory of Integer Quantum Hall Effect in Irrational Magnetic Field

The conventional theory of the integer quantum Hall effect (IQHE) fails for irrational magnetic fields owing to the breakdown of magnetic translational symmetry. Here, based on the recently proposed incommensurate energy band (IEB) theory, we present a universal IQHE theory that does not rely on magnetic translation symmetry and is applicable to both rational and irrational magnetic fluxes. Using the square lattice as a paradigmatic example, we first show that the IEB framework provides a superior description of its energy spectrum in a magnetic field, as it explicitly reveals the momentum-space distribution of eigenstates. Key to our IQHE theory is that each gap in the IEB spectrum is intrinsically labeled by an integer pair (m,g), defined by the corresponding Bragg planes. When the Fermi energy lies within such a gap, the occupied electron states $N_{\text{occ}}$ is determined by the k-space volume enclosed by these Bragg planes, leading to the fundamental relation $N_{\text{occ}}/N_0 = m(φ/φ_0) + g$. Through Středa formula, this leads directly to the quantized Hall conductance $σ_{xy} = m e^2/h$ under arbitrary magnetic fields. Our work resolves the long-standing problem of IQHE under irrational flux, and establishes a new paradigm for IQHE.

This paper introduces ELAS3D-Xtal, a high-performance Fortran/OpenMP upgrade of the NIST ELAS3D voxel-based finite element solver for computing 3D elastic fields in polycrystals with defects. The code supports crystal anisotropy by precomputing rotated stiffness tensors from user-specified orientations and solves the equilibrium problem with a matrix-free, OpenMP-parallel preconditioned conjugate-gradient (PCG) method using a point-block Jacobi preconditioner. On a single shared-memory multicore PC, OpenMP threading accelerates the baseline CG solver by ~10X, while the block-preconditioned CG solver achieves 53-61X speedup relative to the serial CG baseline for meshes from 100^3 to 500^3 voxels (scaling to domains up to 800^3 voxels). Accuracy is validated against the analytical Eshelby inclusion solution. ELAS3D-Xtal also integrates microstructure construction, including statistically calibrated polycrystal generation via spatial filtering and parallel voxel-to-grain assignment, direct pore insertion from XCT centroid/radius data, and texture assignment. Full-field phase, orientation, and stress outputs are written in HDF5 to enable scalable post-processing and defect-mechanics workflows. Applications are demonstrated for (i) anisotropy-controlled defect-scale stress fields and (ii) LPBF SS316L microstructures with gas, lack-of-fusion, and keyhole pore morphologies.

- **TL;DR**: K₂ReCl₆的结构相变主要源于八面体旋转和倾斜，而非Jahn-Teller畸变，尽管其在强自旋轨道耦合极限下可能具有Jahn-Teller活性。

K$_2$ReCl$_6$ belongs to the antifluorite family and exhibits a sequence of structural transitions above the onset of magnetic order at $T_N$ = 12 K. Because of its 5d3 electronic configuration in an octahedral coordination, the ground state is a pure spin state without orbital degeneracy within the LS coupling scheme, but it can become Jahn-Teller active in the strong spin-orbit coupling limit described by the $jj$ coupling [S. Streltsov and D. I. Khomskii, Phys. Rev. X 10, 031043 (2020)]. While the structural transitions in K$_2$ReCl$_6$ are understood in terms of octahedral rotation and tilting, the possible impact of a Jahn-Teller distortion remains an open issue. We report on comprehensive crystalstructure studies by means of powder neutron and single-crystal x-ray diffraction on K$_2$ReCl$_6$ and on K$_2$SnCl$_6$. The latter material is used as a reference, because it exhibits the same sequence of structural transitions as K$_2$ReCl$_6$, but possesses a filled 4d shell ruling out a Jahn-Teller distortion. While the ReCl$_6$ octahedron in K$_2$ReCl$_6$ presents sizable distortions at intermediate temperatures, there is no such distortion persisting to low temperatures excluding a sizable Jahn-Teller effect. Studies on polycrystalline samples of Rb$_2$ReCl$_6$ and Cs$_2$ReCl$_6$, in which the structural transitions are suppressed due to the larger alkaline ionic radius, also do not find any indications for a Jahn-Teller distortion.

- **TL;DR**: 开发了一个用于描述拔牙部位骨组织形成的膜内骨化数学模型，重点关注血管生成、氧依赖效应和生长因子诱导的成纤维细胞凋亡，并通过有限元方法实现和验证。

The accurate modeling of biological processes allows to predict the spatio-temporal behavior of living tissues by computer-aided (in-silico) testing, a useful tool for the development of medical strategies, avoiding the expenses and potential ethical implications of in-vivo experimentation. A model for bone healing in mouth would be useful for selecting proper surgical techniques in dental procedures. In this paper, the formulation and implementation of a model for Intramembranous Ossification is presented aiming to describe the complex process of bone tissue formation in tooth extraction sites. The model consists in a mathematical description of the mechanisms in which different types of cells interact, synthesize and degrade extra-cellular matrices under the influence of biochemical factors. Special attention is given to angiogenesis, oxygen-dependent effects and growth factor-induced apoptosis of fibroblasts. Furthermore, considering the depth-dependent vascularization of mandibular bone and its influence on bone healing, a functional description of the cell distribution on the severed periodontal ligament (PDL) is proposed. The developed model was implemented using the finite element method (FEM) and successfully validated by simulating an animal in-vivo experiment on dogs reported in the literature. A good fit between model outcome and experimental data was obtained with a mean absolute error of 3.04%. The mathematical framework presented here may represent an important tool for the design of future in-vitro and in-vivo tests, as well as a precedent for future in-silico studies on osseointegration and mechanobiology.

We present a generalized extension of the recently developed electron/hole-transfer Dynamically-weighted State-Averaged Constrained CASSCF (eDSC/hDSC) method to model charge transfer in the presence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) for systems containing an odd number of electrons. Our approach incorporates complex-valued spinor orbitals and incorporates four electronic configurations in describing ground-excited state curve crossings between Kramers-restricted doublet states. The method achieves smooth potential energy surfaces and rapid self-consistent field (SCF) convergence across a wide range of spin-orbit coupling strengths, providing an efficient framework for investigating charge transfer processes in the presence of nontrivial spin degrees of freedom.

Entropy is critically examined as a fundamental concept in contemporary science and informatics. Although the typical Shannon entropy provides a proper framework for describing the canonical ensemble, it fails to represent adequately the microcanonical ensemble. This discrepancy manifests additionally in its inability to support a theoretical derivation of the Second Law of thermodynamics.

The bilayer nickelate superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ undergoes a density wave transition near 150 K that has attracted intensive scrutiny, yet its microscopic origin remains elusive. Here we report polarization-resolved electronic Raman scattering measurements on high-quality single crystals of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Below 150\,K, we observe a pronounced, symmetry-dependent redistribution of spectral weight in B$_{1g}$ and B$_{2g}$ channels, consistent with the formation of spin-density-wave (SDW) gaps. Quantitative analysis reveals momentum-selective SDW gap amplitudes, with intermediate-to-strong coupling near X/Y points of the Brillouin zone and weaker coupling along the diagonal direction, indicating an unconventional SDW driven by anisotropic electronic correlations. Our results establish the electronic character of the SDW in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, and provide a microscopic foundation for understanding the emergence of high-temperature superconductivity under pressure in nickelates.

Optical orientation of electron and hole spins by circularly polarized light is investigated for MAPbI$_3$ single crystals. The Hanle and polarization recovery effects measured in transverse and longitudinal magnetic fields, respectively, evidence the hyperfine interaction with nuclear spins as the main factor determining the spin dynamics of charge carriers at cryogenic temperatures. The parameters of the nuclear spin fluctuations within the carrier localization volume are evaluated. Dynamic polarization of the nuclear spins is demonstrated by the Overhauser field reaching 5 mT for acting on the electrons and -30 mT for acting on the holes.

The p-type transistor is an indispensable component of semiconductor technology, enabling complementary operation with n-channel transistors for computation, storage, and communication. Achieving both high robustness and high efficiency is highly desirable but challenging for p-type transistors due to limited semiconductors with reliable hole transport and their high activation energies. Here, we achieved a robust yet efficient p-type transistor by heterogeneously integrating an ultra-wide-bandgap semiconductor and a high-k dielectric layer through van der Waals integration. The p-type transistor employs a two-dimensional hole channel on hydrogenated diamond (bandgap 5.6 eV) combined with a high-k (30.5) SrTiO3 perovskite membrane. At room temperature, the transistor exhibits stable operation with a high on-current (~200 mA/mm), low subthreshold swing (70 mV/dec), high hole mobility (566 cm^2/Vs to 572 cm^2/Vs) and high on-off ratio (~10^9). Furthermore, tuning annealing temperature allows operation in either enhancement or depletion mode. The robust p-type transistor with high efficiency holds great potential for future power electronics, UV optoelectronics, and harsh-environment electronic applications.

We study the ground-state properties of a family of frustrated spin-1/2 Heisenberg models on two- and three-dimensional decorated lattices composed of connected star-shaped units. Each star is built from edge-sharing triangles with an antiferromagnetic interaction on the shared side and ferromagnetic interactions on the others. At a critical coupling ratio, the ideal star model - defined by equal ferromagnetic interactions - exhibits a macroscopically degenerate ground state, which we map onto a site percolation problem on the Lieb lattice. This mapping enables the calculation of exponential ground-state degeneracy and the corresponding residual entropy for square, triangular, honeycomb, and cubic lattices. Remarkably, the residual entropy remains high for all studied lattices, exceeding 60\% of the maximal value ln(2). Despite a gapless quadratic one-magnon spectrum, the low-temperature thermodynamics is governed by exponentially numerous gapped excitations. For a distorted-star variant of the model, the ground-state manifold is equivalent to that of decoupled ferromagnetic clusters, leading to exponential degeneracy with a lower, yet still substantial, residual entropy. At low temperature the system mimics a paramagnetic crystal of non-interacting spins with high spin value ($s=4$ for a square lattice). The obtained results establish a structural design principle for engineering quantum magnets with a high ground-state degeneracy, suggesting promising candidates for enhanced magnetocaloric cooling and quantum thermal machines.

Contrast variation small-angle neutron scattering (CV-SANS) has been widely employed for nano structural analysis of multicomponent systems. In CV-SANS experiments, scattering intensities of samples with different scattering co\ ntrasts are decomposed into partial scattering functions, corresponding to structure of each component and cross-correlation between different components, by singular value decomposition (SVD). However, the estimation of partial scattering functions with small absolute values often suffers from instability due to the significant differences in the singular values. In this paper, we propose a remedy for this instability by introducing the Tikhonov regularization, which ensures more stable reconstruction of the partial scattering functions.

We investigate a diabatization procedure that localizes charges (in real space) and localizes spins (in spin space) for open-shell systems that exhibit charge transfer in the presence of spin-orbit coupling. The procedure is applied to a two-state crossing between pairs of Kramers-restricted doublet states (which can also be considered effectively a four-state crossing). To generate the relevant electronic states, we employ the recently developed electron/hole-transfer Dynamically-weighted State-Averaged Constrained CASSCF (eDSC/hDSC) method that treats systems with an odd number of electrons. To generate the relevant diabatic states, we employ a two-step optimization over complex-unitary rotations that sequentially maximizes dipole and spin moments through iterative Jacobi sweeps; the resulting update rules are effectively equivalent to those of approximate joint diagonalization (AJD) applied to charge and spin. The method converges rapidly and yields smooth diabatic potential energy surfaces that preserve dipole and spin properties (e.g., a slowly varying pseudospin texture) along the reaction coordinate while maintaining time-reversal symmetry.

The Lorentz mirror model provides a clean setting to study macroscopic transport generated solely by quenched environmental randomness. We introduce a hierarchical version that admits an exact recursion for the distribution of left--right crossings, and prove normal transport: the mean conductance scales as (cross-section)/(length) for all length scales if $d\ge3$. A Gaussian approximation, supported by numerics, predicts that, in the marginal case $d=2$, this scaling acquires a logarithmic correction and that the variance-to-mean ratio of conductance converges to the universal value $2/3$ (the ``$2/3$ law'') for all $d\ge2$. We conjecture that both effects persist beyond the hierarchical setting. We finally provide numerical evidence for the $2/3$ law in the original Lorentz mirror model in $d=3$, and interpret it as a universal signature of normal transport induced by random current matching.

Unconventional superconductors with nearly degenerate pairing states are rare. CeRh$_2$As$_2$ has recently emerged as one of the few existing multi-phase superconductors. It exhibits a first-order phase transition between two distinct superconducting states when a magnetic field is applied along the crystallographic $c$-axis. While this behavior has been linked to locally broken inversion symmetry, a phase diagram based on a multi-component superconducting order parameter remains a possibility. Furthermore, superconductivity appears to coexist with an ordered state (phase I). Despite being the subject of many studies, little is known about the nature of the order parameters in both superconducting phases and phase I. Here, we use ultrasound-propagation measurements at low temperatures, in high magnetic fields and under hydrostatic pressure to address this issue. Our results strongly suggest that the superconducting order parameter in both phases is single-component, corroborating the role of local non-centrosymmetry in the development of multi-phase superconductivity in CeRh$_2$As$_2$. In addition, analysis of the elastic anomalies within the Landau framework of phase transitions strongly suggests the presence of an incommensurate magnetic order parameter in phase I.

We provide a theoretical description of diffusive charge and spin transport in hybrid devices containing altermagnets. Based on recently derived drift--diffusion equations for coupled charge and spin dynamics and general boundary conditions, our approach provides a unified description of the spin-splitter effect, i.e., the conversion of charge currents into spin currents, and its inverse in terms of experimentally accessible parameters. We analyze, analytically and numerically, the spin-splitter effect, demonstrating that an injected spin accumulation generates a measurable voltage difference across the transverse direction in the altermagnet. Motivated by a recent experiment, we also analyze a nonlocal spin-valve geometry in which an altermagnetic strip injects spin into a diffusive normal metal. We derive the resulting nonlocal voltage detected by a ferromagnetic electrode as a function of the relative orientation of the N'eel vector and the ferromagnetic polarization, accounting for the main experimental findings. For this setup, we further address spin precession during diffusive transport by analyzing the spin Hanle effect.

- **TL;DR**: 通过粒子群优化算法和第一性原理计算，在高压下预测了Mg-Ti-H三元氢化物结构，发现P4/nmm-MgTiH6在170 GPa下具有81.9 K的超导转变温度，超过液氮沸点。通过Zr/Hf替代Ti可进一步降低稳定压力并提高Tc至86 K。

Ternary hydrides have emerged as the primary focus of the new wave of research into superconducting hydrides. In this work, Mg-Ti-H ternary hydrides are explored under high pressures up to 300 GPa using the prediction method of the particle swarm optimization algorithm combined with first-principles calculations. Two new structures, $P4/nmm$-MgTiH$_6$ and $Pmm2$-Mg$_3$TiH$_6$, are identified to be thermodynamically stable at both 200 GPa and 300 GPa. Thermodynamically stable structures of Mg$_3$TiH$_{12}$ are also identified, whose space groups are $R3/m$ at 200 GPa and $Pm\bar{3}m$ at 300 GPa, respectively. Among these Mg-Ti-H structures, $P4/nmm$-MgTiH$_6$ achieves a record-high $T_\text{c}$ of 81.9 K at 170 GPa, exceeding the boiling point of liquid nitrogen. Such a high $T_\text{c}$ is primarily attributed to strong electron-phonon coupling (EPC) driven by low-frequency acoustic phonon modes, with the EPC strength reaching a large value of 1.54. The $T_\text{c}$ of $Pm\bar{3}m$-Mg$_3$TiH$_{12}$ is predicted to be 40 K at 300 GPa. Furthermore, element substitution of Zr(Hf) for Ti achieves considerable enhancement of superconducting properties in our predicted hydrogen-rich and high-symmetric crystal structures, i.e., $P4/nmm$-MgTiH$_6$ and $Pm\bar{3}m$-Mg$_3$TiH$_{12}$. The high pressure required for dynamical stability is lowered to 100 GPa in both $Pm\bar{3}m$-Mg$_3$ZrH$_{12}$ and $Pm\bar{3}m$-Mg$_3$HfH$_{12}$, and to 90 GPa and 120 GPa for $P4/nmm$-MgZrH$_6$ and $P4/nmm$-MgHfH$_6$, respectively. Particularly, the electronic structure near the Fermi level is significantly modified in the $P4/nmm$-MgHfH$_6$ phase, and pronounced softening of low-frequency acoustic phonon modes occurs. As a result, the EPC strength is enhanced to 1.72, leading to a higher $T_\text{c}$ of 86 K.

- **TL;DR**: ErPdPb单晶具有扭曲Kagome晶格结构，在2.2K以下表现出反铁磁有序，沿c轴显示1/3亚铁磁台阶，具有显著各向异性和高阻挫指数。

The kagome lattice, with its inherent geometric frustration, provides a rich platform for exploring intriguing magnetic phenomena and topological electronic structures. In reduced-symmetry structures, such as twisted kagome systems involving rare earth elements, additional anisotropy can arise, enabling intriguing properties including spin-ice states, magnetocaloric effects, noncollinear magnetic ordering, and anomalous Hall effect. Here, we report the synthesis of single crystals of ErPdPb, which features a twisted kagome lattice net of Er atoms within the hexagonal ZrNiAl-type structure, and we investigate its magnetic, electronic, and thermal properties. The material exhibits antiferromagnetic ordering below 2.2 K, consistently observed in magnetic, transport, and heat capacity measurements. Magnetization measurements reveal 1/3 metamagnetic steps along the c-axis below the Néel temperature, suggesting an Ising-spin-like state on the twisted kagome lattice. A pronounced anisotropy between in-plane and out-of-plane resistivity is observed throughout the temperature range of 1.8-300 K, and the compound exhibits a significant frustration index of 13.6 (12.7) along the c-axis (ab-plane). Heat capacity measurements show a broad hump at 2.2 K, with an additional increase below 0.5 K. The anisotropic magnetic properties are further explored through density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which suggest strong easy-axis anisotropy, consistent with experimental magnetic measurements and crystal-field model expectations, and quasi-one-dimensional bands and a spin-split saddle point at the zone center.

Radial asymmetry in a quadrupole mass filter (QMF), introduced by symmetric displacement of a diagonally opposite rod pair, modifies the confinement potential and alters the ion stability characteristics. In this work, the influence of such radial asymmetry on QMF operation in the second stability zone is investigated through simulations. Using an existing potential formulation for a radially asymmetric QMF, the stability diagram in the second stability zone is extracted for the first time, revealing a systematic shift of the stability apex with the asymmetry parameter. Radial asymmetry introduces additional multipole components, notably an octupole term whose magnitude scales with the asymmetry parameter and whose sign depends on the DC polarity applied to the displaced rods. Transmission simulations show that the transmission peak shifts in accordance with the displaced stability apex, while the resolution exhibits a strong dependence on both the asymmetry parameter and the DC polarity. Comparable maximum resolution is obtained for inward and outward displacements under suitable polarity configurations, with outward displacement providing higher transmission efficiency due to an increased effective aperture. These results demonstrate that controlled radial asymmetry provides an effective means to tailor the resolution and transmission characteristics of QMFs operating in the second stability zone.

We provide a link between response theory, pullback measures, and optimal fingerprinting method that paves the way for a) predicting the impact of acting forcings on time-dependent systems and b) attributing observed anomalies to acting forcings when the reference state in not time-independent. We first derive formulas for linear response theory for time-dependent Markov chains and diffusions processes. We discuss existence, uniqueness, and differentiability of the pullback measure under general (not necessarily slow or periodic) perturbations of the transition kernels. An explicit Green-Kubo-type formula for the linear response is derived. We analyze in detail the case of periodic reference dynamics, where the unperturbed pullback attractor is periodic but the response is generally not. Our formulas reduce to those of classic linear response if one considers a reference autonomous state. Finally, we show that our results allow for extending the theory of optimal fingerprinting for detection and attribution of climate change (or change in any complex system) for the case of time-dependent background state and for the case where the optimal solution is sought for multiple time slices at the same time. We provide strong numerical support for the findings by applying our theory to a modified version of the Ghil-Sellers energy balance model where we include explicit time dependence in the reference state as a result of natural forcings. We verify the accuracy of response theory in predicting the impact of increases of $CO_2$ in the temperature field even when we discretize the system using Markov state modelling approach. Additionally, we consider a more complex modelling scenario where a localized aerosol forcing is also included in the system and show that the optimal fingerprinting method developed here is able to attribute the climate change signal to the acting forcings.

- **TL;DR**: UTe₂中自旋三重态超导的核磁共振和磁化率测量显示，自旋三重态对的自旋构型与上临界场Hc₂密切相关，且存在各向异性的钉扎相互作用。

Spin-triplet superconductivity is an intriguing quantum coherent state with both spin and orbital degrees of freedom, which holds significant potential for future applications in quantum technology. However, how the spin of the triplet pairs responds to an external magnetic field remains poorly understood. This is mainly due to the absence of suitable spin-triplet superconductors. Here, we report results of Knight-shift and ac-susceptibility measurements on UTe$_2$. We demonstrate that the spin susceptibility, which slightly decreases compared to the normal-state value below the superconducting (SC) transition temperature $T_{\rm c}$, is rapidly restored and nearly recovers to the normal-state values around 5 T, well below the SC upper critical field $H_{c2}$ when the magnetic field is applied along the $c$ axis ($H \parallel c$). In addition, we found that $H_{\rm c2}$ of superconductivity becomes larger when the SC spin aligns with the magnetic field. By considering the results on $H \parallel b$, our results suggest the presence of a close relationship between the spin configuration of the triplet pair and $H_{\rm c2}$, as well as the anisotropic pinning interaction acting on the triplet pairs. These phenomena, which have never been observed in spin-singlet superconductors, represent characteristic features unique to spin-triplet superconductors. We discuss the similarities between superconductivity in UTe$_2$ and superfluid $^3$He, focusing on their spin-triplet pairing states.

Altermagnetic crystals resemble antiferromagnets in that they have no macroscopic magnetization, but unlike antiferromagnets they exhibit spin-split band structures. Here the transport properties of altermagnetic quantum dots and their antiferromagnetic twins are explored theoretically with the help of Landauer-Buttiker theory, symmetry considerations and tight-binding models. The influence of the symmetries of the quantum dots, their parent crystal lattices, their shapes and edges, lead arrangements and disorder on the anomalous Hall effect, the spin-Hall effect and spin filtering by the quantum dots are investigated.

- **TL;DR**: 研究六方InMnO3中希格斯样和戈德斯通样声子模式非线性耦合产生的声子频率梳，通过太赫兹脉冲驱动和参数调控实现可控频率梳生成。

We investigate the generation of phononic frequency combs arising from nonlinear coupling between Higgs-like and Goldstone-like phonon modes in hexagonal InMnO3. The Higgs-like mode, an infrared-active optical phonon, is resonantly driven by a short, high-electric field terahertz pulse, while the optically inactive Goldstone-like mode is indirectly excited through intrinsic nonlinear mode coupling. Using a nonlinear phononics model, we numerically solve the coupled equations of motion governing the lattice dynamics and analyze the resulting time- and frequency-domain responses. By systematically varying key drive and material parameters-including electric field amplitude, pulse width, driving frequency, and mode damping-we identify the conditions under which stable phononic frequency combs emerge. Our results reveal clear threshold behaviors for comb formation, tunability of comb spacing and spectral bandwidth through external control parameters, and a breakdown of coherent comb structure at high drive strengths or weak damping. These findings demonstrate how nonlinear Higgs-Goldstone interactions enable controllable phononic frequency comb generation and provide insight into ultrafast lattice dynamics in symmetry-broken materials.

Cooperative collective dynamics is a principal determinant of the ability of synthetic micromotors to perform specific functions. However, realizing controllable and predictable collective behavior in complex physiological environments remains a significant challenge. Here, we show that collections of enzyme-coated colloids can be designed as various chemical logic gates, which subsequently can be organized into functional logic circuits. These circuits take environmental information as input signals and process it to produce output chemical species needed to achieve specific goals. The chemical computation performed by the circuit endows the active colloidal system with the ability to sense its surroundings and autonomously coordinate its collective motion. The results of simulations of several examples are presented, where self-assembled colloidal circuits can identify invasive threats by their signals, produce and deliver chemicals to the targets to suppress their activity. The results of this work can aid in the design of experimental chemical logic circuits through micromotor self-assembly that autonomously respond to environmental cues to execute specific tasks.

- **TL;DR**: 提出一种处理具有高阶形式对称性的相互作用表面系统的变分方法，构建了基于闭合表面算子的二阶量子化哈密顿量，并推导出类似Gross-Pitaevskii方程的函数薛定谔方程。

We develop a variational method for interacting surface systems with higher-form global symmetries. As a natural extension of the conventional second-quantized Hamiltonian of interacting bosons, we explicitly construct a second-quantized Hamiltonian formulated in terms of a closed surface operator $\hatφ[C_p^{}]$ charged under a $p$-form global symmetry. Applying the variational principle, we derive a functional Schrödinger equation analogous to the Gross-Pitaevskii equation in conventional bosonic systems. In the absence of external forces, the variational equation admits a uniform solution that is uniquely determined by a microscopic interaction potential $U(ψ^*ψ)$ and the chemical potential. This uniform solution describes a uniform gas of bosonic surfaces. Using the obtained energy functional, we show that low-energy fluctuations contain a gapless $p$-form field $A_p^{}$ when the $p$-form global symmetry is $\mathrm{U}(1)$, whereas the $p$-form field becomes massive for discrete symmetries, whose low-energy limit is described by a $\mathrm{BF}$-type topological field theory. As a consequence, the system exhibits abelian topological order with anyonic surface excitations. In the presence of external forces, however, solving the functional equation in full generality remains challenging. We argue, however, that the problem reduces to solving the conventional Gross-Pitaevskii equation when external forces act separately on the center-of-mass and relative motions. In addition, we present analytic solutions for topological defects as analogs of vortex and domain-wall solutions in conventional bosonic systems. Finally, as a concrete microscopic model, we study a $\mathbb{Z}_N^{}$ lattice gauge theory and apply our variational method to this system.

Monoatomic chains with magnetic order in proximity of a s-wave superconductor can host Majorana edge modes. In this paper, we extend this idea to more complex spin-block chains such as the BaFe$_{2}$S$_{3}$ magnetic material that has a spin-ladder like structure. We investigate the topological phase diagram of such a system as function of the system parameters. We show that the coupling between chains within the ladder leads to the topological phase with a winding number larger than the sum of two single magnetic chains. Furthermore, strong coupling between chains leads to fractal-like substructure in the topological phase diagram. By investigating the real space properties of such a system and particularly its edge modes, we find that the system spectrum contains several in-gap states that we analyze in detail.

- **TL;DR**: 石墨烯量子霍尔边缘通道通过自旋翻转散射实现无耗散自旋输运，自旋极化率超过100%，可在无电荷电流情况下实现宏观距离自旋输运

The presence of edge channels in the quantum Hall regime leads to dissipationless charge transport over long distances. When graphene is interfaced with a magnetic material, the exchange interaction lifts the Landau levels spin degeneracy. This causes the presence of counterflowing edge channels with opposite spin polarization. We show theoretically that the spin-flip scattering between these edge channels enables a dissipationless spin transport with larger than 100% spin polarization of the charge current. It also allows the transport of spin over macroscopically long distances, even in the absence of an applied charge current.

Verification and validation of electronic structure codes are essential to ensure reliable and reproducible results in computational materials science. While density functional theory has been extensively benchmarked, systematic assessments of many-body perturbation theory methods such as the GW approximation have only recently emerged, most notably through the GW100 dataset. In this work, we assess the numerical accuracy and convergence behavior of the GW implementation in the yambo code using both the Godby-Needs plasmon-pole model and the recently introduced multipole approximation. Quasiparticle energies are compared against GW100 reference data to evaluate the performance, numerical stability, and consistency of these approaches.

Asymmetric exclusion process (TASEP) along a one-dimensional (1D) open channel sets the paradigm for 1D driven models and nonequilibrium phase transitions in open 1D models. Inspired by the phenomenologies of an open TASEP with Langmuir kinetics (Lk) and with finite resources, we study the stationary densities and phase transitions in a TASEP with Lk connected to a particle reservoir at its both ends. We calculate the stationary density profiles and the phase transitions. The resulting phase diagrams in the plane of the control parameters are significantly different from their counterparts in an open TASEP with Lk. In particular, some of the phases admissible in the open TASEP with Lk model are no longer possible. Intriguingly, our model that is closely related to a TASEP coupled with Lk on a ring with a point defect, admits more phases than the latter. Phenomenological implications of our results are discussed.

An impurity hosting a magnetic moment coupled to a conventional $s$-wave superconductor gives rise to so-called Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states with energies inside the superconducting gap. Depending on the coupling between the impurity and the superconductor, the system can have two distinct quantum ground states separated by a quantum phase transition (QPT). We investigate the interplay of two effects observed at the QPT. First, the tunneling supercurrent through the impurity reverses its sign at the QPT, denoted as a $π$-shift in the current-phase relation. Secondly, the local superconducting order parameter at the impurity site is suppressed and becomes negative at the QPT, generally termed a $π$-shift in the local superconducting order parameter. We find that both these effects are governed by the presence of the YSR state, however, they do not significantly depend or influence each other. In particular, we establish that the $π$-shift in the superconducting order parameter does not induce a $π$-shift in the tunneling Josephson current, nor can the Josephson current and its spatial behavior be used to directly probe the impurity-induced changes in the local superconducting order parameter, which occur on a length scale substantially shorter than the superconducting coherence length.

Even-denominator fractional quantum Hall states (FQHSs) fall outside the standard Laughlin's and Jain's odd-denominator hierarchy. In this work, we study the FQHS $ν=1/2$ in the lowest Landau level. The state is confined within a 70 nm-wide GaAs quantum well, where the electrons exhibit a bilayer-like charge distribution. Inter-layer interactions stabilize the $ν=1/2$ FQHS, which is predicted to host quasiparticles with charge e/4 - with either Abelian or non-Abelian topological order. Here, we report on shot-noise measurements of partitioned quasiparticles at $ν=1/2$, where charge partitioning is generated by a unique etch-defined quantum point contact. Our measurements were performed on two nominally identical devices, at two independent experimental setups. Analysis of shot noise in the weak-backscattering regime in each device reveals quasiparticles with charge e/4. These observations provide a clear benchmark for future studies aimed at probing the topological order of the $ν=1/2$ FQHS and its quasiparticles' exchange statistics.

Based on density functional theory (DFT), the formation energies of intrinsic vacancy defects (VC, VSi, and VSi+C) and oxygen-related defects (OC, OSi, OCVSi, and OSiVC) in 3C-SiC are systematically investigated. The results indicate that all defects considered, except for OC, possess neutral or negative charge states, thereby making them suitable for detection by positron annihilation spectroscopy (PAS). Furthermore, the electron and positron density distributions and positron annihilation lifetimes for the perfect 3C-SiC supercell and various defective configurations are computed. It is found that the OSi and OSiVC complexes act as effective positron trapping centers, leading to the formation of positron trapped states and a notable increase in annihilation lifetimes at the corresponding defect sites. In addition, coincidence Doppler broadening (CDB) spectra, along with the S and W parameters, are calculated for both intrinsic and oxygen-doped point defects (OC, OSi, OCVSi, and OSiVC). The analysis reveals that electron screening effects dominate the annihilation characteristics of the OSi defect, whereas positron localization induced by the vacancy is the predominant contributor in the case of OSiVC. This distinction results in clearly different momentum distributions of these two oxygen-related defects for different charge states. Overall, the PAS is demonstrated to be a powerful technique for distinguishing intrinsic vacancy-type defects and oxygen-doped composites in 3C-SiC. Combining the analysis of electron and positron density distributions, the electron localization and positron trapping behavior in defect systems with different charge states can be comprehensively understood. These first-principles results provide a solid theoretical foundation for identifying and characterizing the defects in oxygen-doped 3C-SiC by using PAS.

We derive the exact nonequilibrium steady state of a run-and-tumble particle (RTP) in $d$ dimensions confined in an isotropic harmonic trap $V(\mathbf r)=μr^{2}/2$, with $r=\|\mathbf r\|$. Rotational invariance reduces the problem to the stationary single-coordinate marginal $p_X(x)$, from which the radial distribution $p_R(r)$ and the full joint stationary density follow by explicit integral transforms. We first focus on a generalized trapped RTP in one dimension, where post-tumble velocities are drawn from an arbitrary distribution $W(v)$. Using a Kesten-type recursion, we represent its stationary position in terms of a stick-breaking (or Dirichlet) process, yielding closed-form expressions for its distribution and its moments. Specializing $W(v)$ to the projected velocity law of an isotropic RTP, we reconstruct $p_R(r)$ and the full joint distribution of all the coordinates in $d=1,2,3$. In $d=1$ and $d=2$, the radial law simplifies to a beta distribution, while in $d=3$, we derive closed-form expressions for $p_R(r)$ and the stationary joint distribution $P(x,y,z)$, which differ from a beta distribution. In all cases, we characterize a persistence-controlled shape transition at the turning surface $r=v_0/μ$, where $v_0$ is the self-propulsion speed. We further include thermal noise characterized by a diffusion coefficient $D&gt;0$, showing that the stationary law is a Gaussian convolution of the $D=0$ result, which regularizes turning-point singularities and controls the crossover between persistence- and diffusion-dominated regimes as $D \to 0$ and $D \to \infty$ respectively. All analytical predictions are systematically validated against numerical simulations.

Magnon confinement and trapping refer to the localization of magnons-quasiparticles that represent collective spin-wave excitations in magnetic materials-within specific regions or structures. This concept is essential in magnonics, a subfield of spintronics that leverages spin waves for processing and transmitting information. Compared to conventional electronics, magnonics offers lower power consumption and faster operation, making it a promising technology for future devices. Magnons can be confined using both static and dynamic methods, often relying on potential wells and barriers to restrict their free propagation and trap them in designated locations. In this review, we will explore the main strategies for magnon confinement and trapping, including: magnetic field inhomogeneities, spin textures (i.e. domain walls, vortices, skyrmions) nanostructured materials (i.e. nanowires, disks, and magnonic crystals), topological states, chiral magnons and flat band formation, induced by dipole-dipole interactions and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Microwave cavities and resonant magnetic fields, as well as spin-torque effects and Bose-Einstein condensation contribute to magnon localization. Furthermore, spin-wave edge and cavity modes have been observed in two-dimensional magnetic materials and twisted moiré superlattices at a specific twist angle. Magnon trapping has broad applications in computing and data processing, particularly in the development of magnonic crystals, waveguides, and memory elements. Additionally, magnon systems are being explored for quantum computing, where confinement can enhance the coupling between magnons and other quasiparticles in hybrid quantum systems. Precision control of magnons could lead to next-generation spintronic devices, offering improved efficiency and scalability.

Numerical simulations of critical lattice systems are fundamentally limited by critical slowing down, as long-range correlations are typically established through slow temporal equilibration. A physically constrained generative framework that replaces temporal relaxation with a spatial projection mechanism for critical systems is proposed. Using the two-dimensional Ising model at criticality as a benchmark, we introduce an energy-constrained kernel that synthesizes large-scale configurations from compact equilibrated seeds by enforcing Hamiltonian-level observables. The generated configurations are projected onto the nearest-neighbor energy manifold, ensuring thermodynamic consistency while retaining universal critical properties. We show that the resulting configurations reproduce scale-invariant spin correlations, Binder cumulants, and isotropic structure factors for lattice sizes exceeding 10,000, without iterative Monte Carlo equilibration. While not a strict renormalization group transformation, and motivated by renormalization ideas, the method provides a practical inverse mapping that retains universal features of criticality and enables efficient GPU-parallel generation of ultra-large critical ensembles.

We study how a uniform torsion background, modeling a continuous density of screw dislocations and induces effective spatial noncommutativity and reshapes the energy spectrum of a free quantum particle. Within the geometric theory of defects, the metric yields a first-order (magnetic-like) coupling in the transverse dynamics, equivalent to an effective magnetic field $B_{eff}$ proportional to $p_z Omega$, where $Omega$ encodes the torsion strength. In the strong-coupling (Landau) regime, the planar coordinates obey [x,y] != 0 and the spectrum organizes into Landau-like levels with a slight electric-field-driven tilt and a uniform shift. Thus, increasing $Omega$ drives the system continuously toward the familiar Landau problem in flat space, with torsion setting the noncommutativity scale and controlling the approach to the Landau limit.

Space-time materials are obtained by modulating a physical medium with a traveling-wave perturbation of one or several of its constitutive parameters, such as the density or the bulk modulus in the case of acoustic materials. When this modulation has the form of a moving and abrupt (subwavelength) transition between two parameter values, we refer to a spatio-temporal interface, which may be considered as a building block for more complex space-time materials. This work considers the problem interaction and scattering of acoustic waves with a single spatio-temporal interface, and a sequence of two interfaces forming a slab. Several regimes defined by the relation between the sound propagation velocities and the interface velocity (namely subsonic, intersonic, and supersonic regimes) are discussed. Analytical expressions for the frequency conversions and scattering coefficients are obtained, and compared with numerical simulations based on an equivalent FTFD squeme.

Nuclear quantum effects of protons on electronic excitations in hydrogen-bonded organic materials remains underexplored. In theoretical studies, modeling excitons in these extended systems is particularly difficult because they tend to have a large exciton binding energy and sometimes exhibit charge transfer character. We demonstrate how first-principles Green's function theory combined with the nuclear-electronic orbital method enables us to examine the nature of excitons in a prototypical organic solid of eumelanin, for which the extensive hydrogen bonds have been proposed to facilitate the formation of delocalized excitons. We investigate how the quantization of protons impacts electronic excitations. We discuss the extent to which the resulting proton quantum effects can be described as being derived from structure and how they induce molecular-level anisotropy for the excitons in the organic solid.

This paper addresses uphill transport (defined as a regime in which particle flow is opposite to the prescriptions of Fick's diffusion) in drift-diffusion particle transport constrained by volume exclusion. Firstly, we show that the stationary hydrodynamic limit of a multispecies, weakly asymmetric exclusion process (SHDL) naturally predicts precisely characterized uphill regimes in the space of external drivings.
  Then, with specific reference to systems of oppositely charged particles, we identify well-defined model hypotheses and extensions whereby the SHDL converges to the modified Poisson-Nernst-Planck model, thus bridging the gap between exclusion-based particle models and continuum descriptions commonly used in engineering. The merits and limitations of the models in describing the particle fluxes and predicting uphill transport conditions are investigated in detail with respect to the adopted approximations and simplifications.
  The results demonstrate the persistence of uphill transport phenomena across modeling scales, clarify the conditions under which they occur, and suggest that uphill transport may play a significant role in nanoscale electrolytes, confined ionic and iontronic devices, and membrane-based technologies.

In this work, we conduct a comprehensive first-principles investigation into the design and discovery of novel antimony oxychalcogenide monolayers Sb2X2O (X = S, Se) and Janus Sb2SSeO, examining their structural stability, elastic, electronic, optoelectronic, and photocatalytic properties. Our analysis confirms their thermodynamic and dynamical stability and reveals low cleavage energies, indicating strong feasibility for mechanical exfoliation. The excellent agreement between our HSE06-predicted bandgap of bulk Sb2S2O and experimental measurements further validates the employed computational framework. EWe also find that their optoelectronic responses can be efficiently tuned via biaxial strain, providing a viable route for device-specific property engineering. Favorable band alignments, strong optical absorption, efficient carrier transport, and relatively high dielectric constants collectively support their candidacy for overall water splitting under neutral conditions.These results establish a solid theoretical foundation for the rational design of Sb-based 2D nanostructures and highlight their potential in next-generation direction-dependent optoelectronic and sustainable energy-conversion applications.

Bayesian optimization (BO) is widely used for autonomous materials discovery, yet its classical sequential formulation is insufficient for design of experimental workflows that often combine parallel or batch synthesis with inherently serial characterization. Methods such as combinatorial spread libraries and printed libraries sample a defined low-D manifold in the chemical space of the system. Here, we introduce a time-aware framework for comparing sequential and manifold BO under experimentally realistic constraints. By explicitly modeling synthesis and characterization times, we define an effective experimental time metric that enables fair, time-normalized benchmarking of optimization strategies. Using numerical experiments in ternary and quaternary compositional spaces, we show that sequential BO remains optimal for short-term experiments or when batching provides no effective time advantage, whereas manifold BO becomes favorable once multiplexed synthesis enables faster accumulation of measurements. We identify a small set of physically interpretable parameters that govern the transition between these regimes. These results establish a general, experimentally grounded framework for selecting optimization strategies in self-driving laboratories and autonomous materials discovery workflows.

Motivated by earlier numerical evidence for a percolation-like transition in space-time jamming, we present an analytic description of the transient dynamics of the deterministic traffic model elementary cellular automaton rule 184 (ECA184). By exploiting the deterministic structure of the dynamics, we reformulate the problem in terms of a height function constructed directly from the initial condition, and obtain an equilibrium statistical mechanics-like description over the lattice configurations. This formulation allows macroscopic observables in space-time, such as the total jam delay and jam relaxation time, as well as microscopic jam statistics, to be expressed in terms of geometric properties of the height function. We thereby derive the associated scaling forms and recover the critical exponents previously observed in numerical studies. We discuss the physical implications of this space-time geometric approach.

We experimentally investigate charge transport in In-CrSb and In-CrSb-In proximity devices, which are formed as junctions between superconducting indium leads and thick single crystal flakes of altermagnet CrSb. For double In-CrSb-In junctions, the obtained $dV/dI(B)$ curves are mirrored in respect to zero field for two magnetic field sweep directions, which is characteristic behavior of a Josephson spin valve. Also, we demonstrate Josephson diode effect by direct measurement of the critical current for two opposite directions in external magnetic field. We interpret these observations as a joint effect of the spin-polarized topological surface states and the altermagnetic spin splitting of the bulk bands in CrSb. For a single In-CrSb interface, the superconducting gap oscillates in magnetic field for both field orientations, which strongly resembles the transition into the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state. The latter is based on finite-momentum Cooper pairing against a background of the Zeeman splitting, so it is fully compatible with the requirements for the Josephson diode effect.

Layered MA$_2$Z$_4$ compounds, structural relatives of MoS$_2$ discovered in 2020, exhibit rich magnetic behavior arising from reduced dimensionality, noncentrosymmetric lattice symmetries, and stacking-dependent exchange interactions. Here, we investigate Bernal-like stackings in H-phase MA$_2$Z$_4$ (M = Mn and Fe; A = Si; Z = N) monolayers and bilayers by combining first-principles spin-dependent relaxation energies with a localized-spin Heisenberg description. From density-functional calculations, we extract the dominant intralayer exchange couplings up to third-nearest neighbors and the leading interlayer exchanges up to second-nearest neighbors, enabling construction of an effective bilayer spin Hamiltonian. We first analyze interface-driven proximity effects within a ferromagnetic reference configuration, demonstrating how recovery of AB-type stacking and spin alignment--while varying only the transition-metal species--provides a route for selectively tuning magnetic order and symmetry breaking within the P$\bar{6}$m2 space group. Building on this microscopic understanding of the bonding environment, we then examine antiferromagnetic ordering tendencies in the coupled layers. Exact diagonalization of the resulting bilayer Hamiltonian reveals the magnetic ground state and low-lying excitation spectrum, showing that the interlayer exchange is not merely perturbative but competes directly with intralayer interactions in stabilizing the observed spin configurations. These results establish Bernal-stacked MA$_2$Z$_4$ bilayers as a platform in which stacking geometry and exchange hierarchy jointly govern magnetic reconstruction, offering a controlled pathway toward domain selection and spin-texture engineering in low-dimensional van der Waals materials.

We compute longitudinal magnetoelectric conductivity ($σ_{zz}$) and nonlinear electrochemical response (ECR), applying the semiclassical Boltzmann formalism, for three-dimensional nodal-ring semimetals (vortex nodal-rings and $\mathcal P \mathcal T$-symmetric nodal-rings) and three-band Hopf semimetals. While the nodal-curves of the former are taken to lie along the $k_z = 0$-plane, the nodal points of the latter harbour dipoles in their Berry-curvature (BC) profile, with the dipole's axis aligned along the $k_z$-axis. All these systems are topological and are unified on the aspect that their bands possess a vanishing Chern number. The linear response, $σ_{zz}$, is obtained from an exact solution when the systems are subjected to collinear electric and magnetic fields applied along the anisotropy axis, viz. $\boldsymbol{\hat z}$. The nonlinear part involves third-rank tensors representing second-order response coefficients, relating the electrical current to the combined effects of the gradient of the chemical potential and an external electric field. We analyse the similarities of the response arising from the vortex nodal-rings and the Hopf semimetals, which can be traced to the dipole-like sources in their BC fields.

This work is devoted to establishing the mechanisms of elastic oscillation influence on nucleation processes in metal melts. The method of physical modeling with low-temperature metallic alloys (Wood and Rose) and transparent organic media (salol, camphene, diphenylamine) was used. It was established that vibration and ultrasound significantly reduce the supercooling required to initiate crystallization. The effectiveness of the influence significantly increases for samples with solid substrates. The hypotheses about the influence through changes in melt viscosity and the exclusive role of cavitation were experimentally refuted. The transition from pre-cavitation to cavitation ultrasound regime is not accompanied by qualitative changes in the influence on nucleation. The mechanism of elastic oscillation influence is substantiated, which consists in mechanical impact on adsorbed crystal nuclei on the surfaces of solid substrates. Elastic oscillations increase the nucleation rate by creating growth steps (dislocations) on the surfaces of adsorbed nuclei as a result of mechanical friction of solid substrates and cavitation erosion. The results have fundamental significance for understanding the physical nature of metal crystallization and practical application for developing technologies for controlling structure formation.

Ultrathin complex-oxide membranes provide a powerful platform for strain engineering, interfacial control, and heterogeneous integration; however, their formation remains constrained by the availability and performance of suitable water-soluble sacrificial layers. This letter demonstrates that barium oxide (BaO) serves as a highly efficient and rapidly dissolving water-soluble sacrificial layer, enabling the epitaxial lift-off and transfer of ultrathin La$_{2/3}$Sr$_{1/3}$MnO$_3$ (LSMO) membranes onto SiO$_x$/Si substrates. LSMO membranes with a thickness of approximately 8 nm are released using a BaO sacrificial layer grown by molecular beam epitaxy, while high crystallinity is preserved and Ba interdiffusion is limited to a narrow interfacial region of approximately 0.5 nm. Post-transfer oxygen annealing at 600 ${}^\circ$C increases the Curie temperature ($T_C$) from 342 K to 346 K by eliminating Mn$^{2+}$ states associated with oxygen vacancies generated through oxygen extraction into the BaO layer. These results show that BaO provides a fast, scalable, and compositionally simple route for complex-oxide membrane release, while brief oxygen annealing is essential to restore the optimal Mn valence state and achieve the intrinsic high $T_C$.

Coherent phonon excitation offers a nonthermal route to control quantum phases of condensed matter. In this work, we employ first-principles calculations to investigate the phonon landscape of (TaSe4)2I in its charge-density-wave (CDW) phase. We identify nine symmetry-preserving Raman-active modes that can suppress the Gamma-Z direct gap to the meV scale and render the system globally gapless by generating Weyl nodes at generic k points. Among them, the 2.51 THz CDW amplitude mode A(18) directly weakens the Ta-chain tetramerization, approaching a transient restoration of the uniform-chain geometry. It is also the most efficient mode owing to its low frequency and a relatively small critical displacement dominated by Ta motions. Other Raman modes, dominated by Se vibrations, require significantly larger displacements to reach the Weyl-semimetallic regime and are generally less effective than A(18) at reducing the Ta-chain tetramerization. Furthermore, we explore nonlinear phonon-phonon interactions and find that the low-frequency infrared-active mode B3(7) (1.14 THz) exhibits strong anharmonic coupling with A(18), providing an indirect pathway to drive the system toward a Weyl-semimetallic regime. Our results provide predictive insight for ultrafast pump-probe experiments and present a generalizable framework for lattice-driven topological switching in quasi-one-dimensional quantum materials.

As the first experimentally discovered intrinsic magnetic topological insulator, MnBi2Te4 has attracted widespread attentions, providing a unique platform for the exploration of topological quantum phases, such as quantum anomalous Hall effect and axion insulator state. Despite the increasing number of potential factors affecting samples being identified, obtaining the high-quality device performance with desired topological quantum phases remains a challenge. In this work, by comparing the reflective magnetic circular dichroism (RMCD) of crystals with different defect densities that are characterized by atomically resolved scanning tunneling microscopy, we demonstrate that anti-site defects play an essential role in achieving ideal magnetic states. By measuring RMCD hysteresis loops with operando heating, we find that MnBi2Te4 few-layer samples are highly susceptible to thermal impact, even at temperature as low as 45°C. The magnetic behavior of heating-treated samples is akin to that of samples fabricated into devices, revealing the thermal impact on devices as well. Starting from few-layers with ideal layer-dependent magnetic order, thermal heating leads to the convergence of magnetization and transition fields between odd- and even-layers. The observed heating-induced magnetic evolution can serve as a valuable reference for assessing the sample quality or the density of anti-site defects. Our findings not only point out the long-standing hidden factor that arose controversies in MnBi2Te4, but also pave the way for controllably engineering the topological quantum phenomena.

- **TL;DR**: 开发了一种新型三金属CuNiFe阳极，通过室温一步电沉积制备，在碱性水电解中表现出优异活性和稳定性，同时显著提升CO2电解性能，并大幅降低环境足迹。

The transition to a green hydrogen economy demands robust, scalable, and sustainable anodes for alkaline water electrolysis operating at industrial current densities (&gt;1 A/cm2). However, achieving high activity and long-term stability under such conditions remains a formidable challenge with conventional catalysts. Here, we report a novel trimetallic CuNiFe anode fabricated through a rapid, single-step electrodeposition process at room temperature without organic additives. The catalyst exhibits an exceptionally low overpotential of &lt;270 mV at 100 mA cm(-2) and operates stably for over 500 hours at 1 A cm(-2) in 30 wt% KOH. In a practical anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEM-WE), the CuNiFe anode enables a current density of 2.5 A cm(-2) at only 2.5 V, with a voltage efficiency of 66.8%. Beyond water splitting, this anode also significantly enhances CO2 electrolysis, tripling the CO2 reduction current density and steering selectivity toward valuable multi-carbon products when paired with commercial copper cathodes. A cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment confirms that the CuNiFe anode reduces the carbon footprint by an order of magnitude and decreases environmental impacts by 40-60% across multiple categories compared to benchmark IrRuO2. Our work establishes a scalable, high-performance, and environmentally benign anode technology, paving the way for cost-effective electrochemical production of green hydrogen and carbon-neutral chemicals.

Understanding how nanocluster cocatalysts modify the electronic structure of III-nitride surfaces is central to the rational design of efficient photocatalytic interfaces. Here, we establish design principles for nanocluster cocatalysts on GaN-based semiconductors by systematically analyzing the spatially resolved electronic structure of GaN-, InGaN-, and ScGaN-based slabs decorated with six-atom elemental nanoclusters. Using a region-resolved projected local density of states (PLDOS) framework, we reveal that semiconductor-nanocluster interfaces operate as laterally heterogeneous electronic systems, in which nanocluster-covered regions govern charge injection and band bending, while uncovered nitride regions retain surface states that facilitate surface activation. We further show that cocatalyst effectiveness is controlled not only by hydrogen adsorption energy, but also by interfacial electrostatics, including band alignment, metal-induced gap-state suppression, and in-plane dipoles, with the semiconductor substrate defining the baseline electronic regime. Machine-learning regression models trained on physically motivated global and region-specific descriptors quantify the relative importance of these mechanisms and their correlation with hydrogen adsorption energetics. Together, this work provides transferable design principles for nanocluster cocatalysts on III-nitrides and a generalizable first-principles framework for studying spatially heterogeneous semiconductor-nanocluster interfaces.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文展示了反铁磁体表面会出现交变磁性，大幅扩展了具有交变磁性特征的材料候选范围，并通过表面诱导对称性破缺建立了实现二维交变磁性的途径。

We demonstrate the emergence of altermagnetism at the surfaces of antiferromagnets, vastly expanding the number of material candidates with altermagnetic characteristics and establishing a route to two-dimensional altermagnetism through surface-induced symmetry breaking. We do so by developing a surface spin group formalism that fully classifies all surface magnetic states and identifies altermagnetic surface spin groups that can arise at the surfaces of antiferromagnets. We use this formalism to identify over 140 antiferromagnetic entries from the MAGNDATA database with at least one altermagnetic surface, often times with multiple such surfaces in the same material. We illustrate this emergent phenomenon in a realistic Lieb lattice-based minimal model and present ab initio calculations on two representative material candidates, NaMnP and FeGe$_2$, exhibiting $d$-wave and $g$-wave surface altermagnetism, respectively. Our theory naturally resolves the contradiction of recent experimental reports of $d$-wave ARPES measurements on metallic Lieb lattice compounds that have been shown to be antiferromagnetic in the bulk. Hence, we establish a new paradigm for generating two-dimensional altermagnetism by functionalizing the abundant material class of collinear antiferromagnets as viable platforms for controlled surface altermagnetism, creating natural materials for future hybrid device implementation.

- **TL;DR**: 表面反演对称性破缺在中心对称共线反铁磁体表面产生非相对论性d波自旋劈裂，称为表面交变磁性，但需要同时破坏PT和tT对称性才能实现。

Broken inversion symmetry at the surfaces of centrosymmetric collinear antiferromagnets lifts the combined inversion and time-reversal symmetry ($PT$) and can generate nonrelativistic d-wave spin splitting, termed surface altermagnetism. Combining symmetry analysis with first-principles calculations, we show that surface inversion breaking, while necessary, is not sufficient for this effect. Surface altermagnetism emerges only when the surface termination simultaneously breaks both $PT$ and translation--time-reversal symmetry ($tT$), thereby inducing magnetic sublattice inequivalence between antiferromagnetically coupled surface moments. We demonstrate this mechanism explicitly for the G-type antiferromagnets V$_3$Al and BaMn$_2$Sb$_2$, and show that the same symmetry criterion applies broadly across distinct structural families of centrosymmetric antiferromagnets. These results establish a general, symmetry-based route to realizing robust, exchange-driven spin polarization at antiferromagnetic surfaces and interfaces.

Epitaxial growth of orthorhombic SnSe on cubic substrates is challenging due to lattice-symmetry mismatch and anisotropic bonding. Here we demonstrate that epitaxial films with sharp interfaces can be achieved for layered SnSe grown directly on on-axis and 4 degree miscut GaAs(001) substrates. The substrate miscut strongly influences the growth morphology, evolving from spirals on on-axis GaAs to a terraced structure on miscut GaAs. X-ray diffraction reveals that on-axis GaAs supports SnSe with two in-plane orientation variants, whereas the miscut substrate stabilizes a single orientation and introduces a small out-of-plane tilt. Accordingly, in-plane optical anisotropy is enhanced in the single variant film compared to the double variant, as determined by cross-polar reflectance. High-resolution TEM shows that the SnSe/GaAs interface is atomically abrupt and incoherent, characteristic of quasi-van der Waals epitaxy. We find a pronounced tendency for the zigzag edges of SnSe to align parallel to step edges on both substrates, and we show that step-skipping nucleation and layer growth on the miscut substrate leads to the additional tilt. These results establish direct SnSe/GaAs heteroepitaxy as a route to integrate anisotropic layered semiconductors with cubic platforms, and show that miscut substrates provide additional control over in-plane anisotropy.

Topological insulators and skyrmion-hosting, chiral magnetic multilayers are two well-explored areas of modern condensed matter physics, each offering unique advantages for spintronics applications. In this paper, we demonstrate the optimization process for the growth of a Bi$_2$Se$_3$/buffer/[Pt/CoB/Ru]$_{\times N}$ heterostructure that combines these two material classes: the Bi$_2$Se$_3$ epilayer was grown by molecular beam epitaxy before transfer under ultrahigh vacuum to a separate growth chamber where the polycrystalline metallic multilayer was sputter deposited. The structure of the samples was characterized by co-fitted X-ray and polarized neutron reflectometry measurements and scanning transmission electron microscopy. Polarized neutron models and standard magnetometry show that a buffer layer exceeding a critical thickness is required to obtain the desired uniform, perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in every magnetic layer in the multilayer. Samples with both Ta and Mo buffers were used requiring thicknesses of 1.5 and 0.9 nm respectively. In minimizing the Bi$_2$Se$_3$ terracing, buffered samples yield well-defined, out-of-plane, magnetic domains suitable for spin-orbit torque induced manipulation as determined by X-ray photoemission electron microscopy.

2D van der Waals ferroelectrics, particularly alpha-In2Se3, have emerged as an attractive building block for next-generation information storage technologies due to their moderate band gap and robust ferroelectricity stabilized by dipole locking. alpha-In2Se3 can adopt either the distorted zincblende or wurtzite structures; however, the wurtzite phase has yet to be experimental-ly validated, and its large-scale synthesis poses significant challenges. Here, we report an in-situ transport growth of centimeter-scale wurtzite type alpha-In2Se3 films directly on SiO2 substrates using a process combining pulsed laser deposition and chemical vapor deposition. We demonstrate that it is a narrow bandgap ferroelectric semiconductor, featuring a Curie tem-perature exceeding 620 K, a tunable bandgap (0.8-1.6 eV) modulated by charged domain walls, and a large optical absorption coefficient of 1.3 times 10 powers 6 per centemeter. Moreover, light absorption promotes the dynamic conductance range, linearity, and symmetry of the synapse devices, leading to a high recognition accuracy of 92.3 percent in a supervised pattern classification task for neuromorphic computing. Our findings demonstrate a ferroelectric polymorphism of In2Se3, highlighting its potential in ferroelectric synapses for neuromorphic computing.

- **TL;DR**: 通过臭氧处理聚合物电介质，氧原子能将碳原子氧化成一氧化碳，减少半导体烟灰形成，降低烟灰电导率，从而提升金属化薄膜电容器的自愈性能和可靠性。

Metalized-film capacitors (MFCs) employ polymer organic dielectrics like polypropylene (PP) and polyimide (PI), in which self-healing is seen as a key advantage. However, the performance of self-healing depends on specific chemical mechanisms involved. The formation of semiconductive carbonaceous soot represents a critical failure risk. This study investigates how oxygen atom impregnation through ozonation of the dielectric material tunes the composition and electrical conductivity of breakdown products in the PP and PI systems with aluminum-zinc electrodes. We revealed, at the atomistic level, that oxygen atoms tend to remove a fraction of carbon atoms from the semiconductive soot by oxidizing carbon into carbon monoxide in both polymers. In PP, oxygen fraction linearly increases gas mass fraction, thereby reducing soot fraction. In PI, the gas/soot ratio effect of oxygen content is less drastic, still clearly positive. The PP soot conductivity decreases uniformly as larger fractions of oxygen atoms are added. In turn, the PI conductivity drops to ~1500 S/m quickly. The PI soot exhibits narrower band gaps compared to that of PP. The oxygen fraction non-monotonically tailors band gaps, which generally increase. To summarize, ozonation enhances MFC reliability by increasing gas species fraction and reducing soot conductivity. We hereby provide numerical molecular-level insights to rationalize self-healing performance enhancement through polymer ozonation.

The Shastry-Sutherland lattice is a prototypical frustrated quantum magnet. It is notable for its exactly solvable dimer-singlet ground state and hosts a wealth of magnetic phenomena under external fields. Here, this work investigates the high-spin (S = 7/2) Eu-based magnet Eu2MgSi2O7 (EMSO) using low-temperature magnetothermal measurements and Monte Carlo simulations, revealing a giant magnetocaloric effect (MCE) in this Shastry-Sutherland compound. The entropy change peak value is found to be 55.0 J kg-1 K-1 under a field change of B = 0-4 T, approximately 1.5 times larger than the commercial Gd3Ga5O12 (GGG). Adiabatic demagnetization refrigeration achieves a lowest temperature of 151 mK, deeply into the sub-Kelvin regime. Furthermore, a distinctive cooling effect persists below about 1 T, a characteristic absent for conventional magnetic coolants. A dipolar Shastry-Sutherland model is introduced as a minimal model to describe this system; in particular, the experimentally revealed 1/3 magnetization pseudo-plateau can be ascribed to the presence of dipolar couplings between Eu2+ ions, further stabilized by the thermal fluctuations, explaining the persistent cooling effect. This work establishes EMSO as a novel platform for exploring the dipolar Shastry-Sutherland system and for sub-Kelvin adiabatic demagnetization refrigeration.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文发现，在Fe/Pt/W三层异质结构中，尽管Fe层轨道淬灭，但通过W层中的逆轨道霍尔效应实现了显著的太赫兹发射增强。

The inverse orbital Hall effect (IOHE) has recently attracted considerable attention as an emerging mechanism for terahertz (THz) emission based on ultrafast angular-momentum-to-charge conversion. Most experimental studies have focused on materials with strong spin-orbit coupling or pronounced orbital character, where sizable orbital Hall responses are expected. Elemental ferromagnets such as Fe are generally regarded as quenched orbital sources and are not expected to exhibit orbital-dominated THz emission. Here, we report a pronounced enhancement of THz emission in Fe/Pt/W trilayer heterostructures, despite the absence of detectable orbital contributions in the corresponding Fe/Pt and Fe/W bilayers. Thickness-dependent measurements reveal long-distance signal persistence, systematic delay accumulation, and pronounced pulse broadening with increasing W thickness. These features are inconsistent with diffusive spin transport and indicate that orbital angular momentum transport in the W layer, converted into charge current via the IOHE, becomes a dominant channel for THz emission in the trilayer configuration. Our results demonstrate that strong IOHE can emerge in heterostructures incorporating a quenched orbital ferromagnet, providing an effective route to enhance spintronic THz emitters through orbital Hall physics.

We investigate the lattice dynamics of CaWO$_4$, a promising host crystal for erbium-based quantum memories, using inelastic neutron scattering together with density-functional perturbation theory. The measured phonon dispersion along the (100), (001), and (101) reciprocal space direction reveals phonon bands extending up to 130 meV, with a gap between 60 and 80 meV, in good agreement with our calculations. From a symmetry analysis of the phonon eigenmodes, we identify eight Raman-active modes that can couple directly to the Er$^{3+}$ crystal-field operators, including a low-energy $B_g$ mode at 9.1 meV that is expected to play a dominant role in phonon-assisted spin-lattice relaxation. These results provide a microscopic description of the phonon bath in CaWO$_4$ and establish a basis for engineering phononic environments to mitigate the loss of stored quantum states and optimize Er-doped CaWO$_4$ for quantum-memory applications.

- **TL;DR**: ZrTe5在压力下经历电子结构重构，6 GPa附近出现结构相变，导致磁阻显著增强（达1400%），并在8 GPa时出现Tc=1.8K的超导性

We report a comprehensive investigation of the pressure effects on the magnetotransport properties of the topological material ZrTe5 within 1 to 8 GPa pressure range. With increasing pressure, the characteristic peak (Tp) in its electrical resistivity first shifts to higher temperature and then moves quickly towards the lower temperature before disappearing eventually at 6 GPa. Beyond 6 GPa, the system exhibits metallic behavior across the entire temperature range, and superconductivity emerges below Tc = 1.8 K at 8 GPa. Based on the systematic magnetotransport measurement under pressure, we demonstrate that the superconductivity occurs following a significant electronic structure modulation possibly due to pressure induced structural changes near 6 GPa, which coincides with dramatic enhancement of the magnetoresistance (MR) reaching up to 1400 percent. Our experimental results are substantiated by density functional theory calculations as the application of pressure drastically alters the density of states near the Fermi level. Notably, multiple hole pockets emerge at the Fermi level from 4 GPa onward, and their contributions are further enhanced with increasing pressure. The combined experimental and theoretical investigation reveals a comprehensive evolution of electronic structure of Dirac semimetal ZrTe5 under pressure and suggest a possible link between the Fermi surface reconstruction in the pressure range of structural transition and emergence of superconductivity

- **TL;DR**: 在MOFs中发现了一种介于晶态与非晶态之间的新结构状态，该状态保留面内长程有序但失去堆叠方向有序性，可通过热脱溶剂化制备高质量2D晶体

Solid materials are commonly classified as crystalline or amorphous based on the presence or absence of long-range order.Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), like other solids,also display markedly different properties and functions in these two phases. Here, we identify a previously unrecognized structural state that retains long-range in-plane translational order while losing order along the stacking direction. Hypothesized since 1941 but not experimentally verified, this intermediate phase emerges in a crystalline MOFs via controlled thermal desolvation, which selectively disrupts the intrinsically weak interlayer interactions while preserving macroscopic structural coherence. Although the resulting material appears amorphous under conventional characterization, systematic synchrotron PXRD, total X-ray scattering, and low-dose high resolution TEM reveal clear in-plane periodicity. This material spontaneously delaminates in water into uniform, high-quality two-dimensional crystalline nanosheets, forming stable colloidal suspensions and exhibiting superlubricity comparable to graphene - but at less than 0.1% of the production cost. Our discovery finds a missing link within the long-standing crystalline-amorphous dichotomy, while providing an inherently scalable route to high-quality 2D crystals, and offering a conceptual and practical advance in phase engineering.

Beta-Ti bcc-superalloys, comprising an A2 beta-Ti matrix reinforced by ordered intermetallic B2 beta-prime-TiFe precipitates, exhibit an unusual recrystallisation that occurs with no externally applied strain (i.e. no thermomechanical processing). Thermal ageing at 750 degrees Celsius for 72 h results in refinement of the grain size from 364 um to 30 um. This grain refinement is driven by discontinuous precipitation of beta-prime-TiFe lamellae with the beta-Ti matrix from grain/phase boundaries, which is associated with significant misorientation and increased dislocation density, attributed as precipitation induced recrystallisation (PIX).

- **TL;DR**: DBTTF与HATCN形成给体-受体复合物，产生新晶体结构和光学吸收带，电导率随混合比例呈非单调变化，所有混合比例均呈现n型行为（除纯DBTTF外），电导率受形态和结构有序性影响。

The formation of donor-acceptor complexes (DACs) between the electron donor Dibenzotetrathiafulvalene (DBTTF) and the acceptor Hexaaza\-triphenylene\-hexacarbo\-nitrile (HATCN) results in a new phase with a distinctly different crystal structure as well as new optical absorption bands below the energy gaps of the two pristine materials. X-ray scattering and atomic force microscopy provide detailed insights into the film structure and morphology by systematic variation of the mixing ratio from pristine DBTTF to pristine HATCN. The measured electrical conductivity of thin films depends in a highly non-monotonic manner on the composition of the mixture and shows significantly improved charge transport compared to the pristine films. The temperature-dependent conductivity, charge carrier concentration, and mobility were investigated across these compositions. Surprisingly, all compositions exhibited n-type behavior, except for pristine DBTTF. This behavior is explained by the electronic structure of the mixtures, as revealed by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy, which indicates that charge injection and transport occur via the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of the DAC and HATCN. Additionally, the observed electrical conductivity is strongly influenced by morphology and structural ordering of the films. These findings offer valuable insights for the design of advanced materials with enhanced electrical performance.

- **TL;DR**: NMRPeak是一个统一的多模态学习系统，通过整合谱图预测、分子检索和结构生成三个任务，解决了实验核磁共振谱图解析的自动化难题，显著提升了实验场景下的性能。

One-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is essential for molecular structure elucidation in organic synthesis, drug discovery, natural product characterization, and metabolomics, yet its interpretation remains heavily dependent on expert knowledge and difficult to scale. Although machine learning has been applied to NMR spectrum prediction, library retrieval, and structure generation, these tasks have evolved in isolation using simulated data and incompatible spectral representations, limiting their utility under real experimental scenarios.Here we present NMRPeak, a unified cross-modal learning system that integrates these three tasks through experimentally grounded design. We curate approximately 1.8 million experimental and simulated spectra to construct the largest benchmark for NMR-based structure elucidation and systematically quantify the distribution shift between these domains. We introduce a chemically-aware adaptive tokenizer that dynamically balances discretization granularity to preserve spectral semantics while controlling vocabulary size, and an assignment-free peak-aware similarity metric that enables direct comparison between predicted and experimental spectra. Through a unified molecule-to-spectrum paradigm and synergistic coupling of prediction, retrieval, and generation modules, NMRPeak achieves transformative performance on experimental benchmarks: it overcomes the longstanding simulation-to-experiment gap in spectrum prediction while delivering over 95% top-1 accuracy in molecular retrieval and approximately 75% top-1 accuracy in stereochemistry-aware de novo structure generation. These capabilities establish a foundation for automated, high-throughput molecular structure elucidation in organic synthesis, drug discovery, and chemical biology.

- **TL;DR**: 通过闪烧退火技术，在1秒内快速结晶PbZrO3薄膜，实现了63.5 J/cm³的高能量存储密度和优异的热稳定性（250°C下性能衰减&lt;3%）

Dielectric capacitors are essential for energy storage systems due to their high-power density and fast operation speed. However, optimizing energy storage density with concurrent thermal stability remains a substantial challenge. Here, we develop a flash annealing process with ultrafast heating and cooling rates of 1000 oC/s, which facilitates the rapid crystallization of PbZrO3 film within a mere second, while locking its high-temperature microstructure to room temperature. This produces compact films with sub-grain boundaries fraction of 36%, nanodomains of several nanometers, and negligible lead volatilization. These contribute to relaxor antiferroelectric film with a high breakdown strength (4800 kV/cm) and large polarization (70 uC/cm2). Consequently, we have achieved a high energy storage density of 63.5 J/cm3 and outstanding thermal stability with performance degradation less than 3% up to 250 oC. Our approach is extendable to ferroelectrics like Pb(Zr0.52Ti0.48)O3 and on wafer scale, providing on-chip nonlinear dielectric energy storage solutions with industrial scalability.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究通过理论、模拟和实验验证了吸收效应对3D电子衍射的影响，特别是在高原子序数材料中厚度接近消光距离时，吸收效应不可忽略。

The role of absorption in 3D electron diffraction is established through analytical theory, simulation, and dynamical refinement. A two-beam expression for the absorbed integrated intensity is derived, showing that for $t/ξ_g \ll 1$ reflections follow a uniform exponential decay set by the mean absorptive potential $U_0'$. Many-beam simulations demonstrate that neglecting absorption in dynamical refinement of integrated intensities incurs a residual that increases linearly with thickness and diverges near zone axes. Dynamical refinements were performed on CsPbBr$_3$, quartz, and borane, with the inclusion of absorption yielding an improvement in $R_{\mathrm{obs}}$ from $6.4$ to $5.3$ \% for CsPbBr$_3$ and negligible changes for quartz and borane. Absorption is therefore deemed negligible for routine refinement of integrated intensities except in high-$Z$ materials at thicknesses approaching $ξ_g$.
