- **TL;DR**: V2Ga5是一种准一维II型超导体（Tc=3.54K），在约10K以下表现出铁磁相关性，铁磁长程有序被超导转变抑制。

Superconductivity and ferromagnetism are generally competing ground states in $d$-electron systems, making their interplay of fundamental interest. We report a comprehensive study of high-quality single- and polycrystalline V$_2$Ga$_5$, a bulk type-II superconductor ($T_c = 3.54 \ K$) with a quasi-one-dimensional crystal structure, supplemented with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, suggesting possible proximity to ferromagnetic order. Below $T \approx 10 \ K$, magnetic susceptibility shows ZFC/FC splitting, along with saturation and hysteresis in $M(H)$. Moreover, electrical transport measurements reveal a magnetic-field-dependent resistivity upturn, while specific heat is enhanced in magnetic fields. DFT calculations show that the Fermi level in V$_2$Ga$_5$ is located at a peak in the density of states, with a small magnetic moment per unit cell comparable to the experimental value. Together, these results indicate the possibility that ferromagnetic correlations develop below $T \approx 10 \ K$, well above $T_c$, with long-range ferromagnetic order suppressed by the superconducting transition.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究建立了欠掺杂LSCO中线性温度与线性磁场普朗克行为的普适性，提出了基于自旋的微观机制来解释量子临界点附近的普朗克输运现象。

One of the long standing puzzles in strongly correlated materials is the microscopic origin of the quantum critical Planckian strange metal phase with universal linear in temperature scattering rate from which unconventional superconductivity directly emerges by lowering temperatures. Recently, the linear in temperature and linear in field resistivity have been simultaneously observed in high temperature cuprate superconductors, manifested by the universal field to temperature scaling in magnetoresistivity. To date, there has been a lack of coherent and unified understanding of these coexisting linear behaviors and their possible link to quantum criticality. In this work, we establish the universality in linear in temperature and linear in field Planckian behaviors in underdoped LSCO near optimal doping. Experimentally, we observe the linear in field Planckian scattering rate and its relation to its linear in temperature counterpart. Theoretically, we propose a spin based common microscopic mechanism based on Kondo-like charge fluctuations near local quantum criticality of heavy fermion formulated tJ model subject to a Zeeman term. Similar to frequency to temperature scaling near quantum criticality, we find the magnetic field here effectively introduces a Zeeman energy, reminiscent of an external energy in the quantum critical regime, leading to field to temperature scaling. Our analytically predicted universal field to temperature scaling in isotropic scattering rate and the relation between the linear in temperature and linear in field Planckian coefficients, unifies these two phenomena over an extended doping range, pointing toward a unified quantum-critical origin of Planckian transport in cuprates.

- **TL;DR**: PE-ALD制备的NbN超导薄膜具有异常均匀的空间特性，即使接近超导-绝缘转变厚度仍保持高均匀性，适合高动能电感应用。

Due to their high kinetic inductance, highly disordered superconducting thin films are a potential hardware for the realization of compact, low-noise elements in cryoelectronic applications. However, high disorder typically results in structural defects that cause spatial inhomogeneity of the superconducting order parameter, thereby impairing the film's properties. Here, we employ scanning tunneling microscopy to demonstrate that NbN thin films fabricated by plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PE-ALD) exhibit unusual spatial homogeneity, even at thicknesses approaching the superconductor-insulator transition. Tunneling spectra acquired across the sample surface show only small variations of the order parameter with a standard deviation of 2-3%, on length scales that significantly exceed the film's grain size. At the same time, the films achieve a relatively high sheet resistance (up to 1400 Ohm) and, consequently, a high sheet kinetic inductance (up to approximately 200 pH), making them well-suited for applications.

- **TL;DR**: 弱垂直相关无序通过调制层间隧穿振幅，导致铜氧化物超导体出现多通道c轴电动力学响应，解释了多种c轴异常现象。

Cuprate superconductors display robust in-plane electronic correlations but exceptionally fragile interlayer coherence. We suggest that even weak vertically correlated disorder (arising from interstitial-oxygen staging, twin boundaries, extended strain fields, or defect-pinned charge textures) can impose a layer-dependent modulation of the interlayer tunneling amplitude t(z). Because the bare interlayer coupling is intrinsically small, such modulations generate an effectively multichannel c-axis electrodynamic response, consistent with multi-component Josephson plasma resonances, nonmonotonic c-axis resistivity, redistribution of bilayer magnetic spectral weight, and field-enhanced vertical CDW correlations. We propose a phenomenological framework in which the organization of disorder, rather than its magnitude, governs the effective interlayer coupling and its electrodynamic signatures. This viewpoint unifies diverse c-axis anomalies across several cuprate families, suggesting that controlling vertical disorder correlations offers a viable pathway for tuning dimensionality and interlayer coherence in high-Tc superconductors.

### Generalized Kramers-Wannier Self-Duality in Hopf-Ising Models

- **TL;DR**: 该论文基于半单Hopf代数构建了广义1+1d Ising模型，实现了非阿贝尔群规范对称性的推广，并构造了广义Kramers-Wannier对偶算子，在自对偶点表现为非可逆对称性。

The Kramers-Wannier transformation of the 1+1d transverse-field Ising model exchanges the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases and, at criticality, manifests as a non-invertible symmetry. Extending such self-duality symmetries beyond gauging of abelian groups in tensor-product Hilbert spaces has, however, remained challenging. In this work, we construct a generalized 1+1d Ising model based on a finite-dimensional semisimple Hopf algebra $H$ that enjoys an anomaly-free non-invertible symmetry $\mathrm{Rep}(H)$. We provide an intuitive diagrammatic formulation of both the Hamiltonian and the symmetry operators using a non-(co)commutative generalization of ZX-calculus built from Hopf-algebraic data. When $H$ is self-dual, we further construct a generalized Kramers-Wannier duality operator that exchanges the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases and becomes a non-invertible symmetry at the self-dual point. This enlarged symmetry mixes with lattice translation and, in the infrared, flows to a weakly integral fusion category given by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ extension of $\mathrm{Rep}(H)$. Specializing to the Kac-Paljutkin algebra $H_8$, the smallest self-dual Hopf algebra beyond abelian group algebras, we numerically study the phase diagram and identify four of the six $\mathrm{Rep}(H_8)$-symmetric gapped phases, separated by Ising critical lines and meeting at a multicritical point. We also realize all six $\mathrm{Rep}(H_8)$-symmetric gapped phases on the lattice via the $H$-comodule algebra formalism, in agreement with the module-category classification of $\mathrm{Rep}(H_8)$. Our results provide a unified Hopf-algebraic framework for non-invertible symmetries, dualities, and the tensor product lattice models that realize them.

- **TL;DR**: 提出一种噪声平衡稀疏网格插值方法，用于构建多尺度模拟中的代理模型，有效处理蒙特卡洛数据的采样噪声和高维问题。

Multiscale simulations utilizing high-fidelity, microscopic Monte Carlo models to provide the nonlinear response for continuum models can easily become computationally intractable. Surrogate models for the high-fidelity Monte Carlo models can overcome this but come with some challenges. One such challenges arise by the sampling noise in the underlying Monte Carlo data, which leads to uncontrolled errors possibly corrupting the surrogate even though it would be highly accurate in the case of noise-free data. Another challenge arises by the 'curse of dimensionality' when the response depends on many macro-variables. These points are addressed by a novel noise-balanced sparse grids interpolation approach which, in a quasi-optimal fashion, controls the amount of Monte Carlo sampling for each data point. The approach is complemented by a multilevel on-the-fly construction during the multiscale simulation. Besides its efficiency, a particularly appealing feature is the ease of use of the approach with only a single hyperparameter controlling the whole surrogate construction - from the surrogate's accuracy with guaranteed convergence to which data needs to be created with which accuracy. The approach is demonstrated on challenging examples from heterogeneous catalysis, coupling microscopic kinetic Monte Carlo models into macroscopic reactor simulations.

- **TL;DR**: 研究在20K低温下使用光谱-发光方法分析氢气和氮气饱和的C60单晶，首次报道了基于C60的新物质的低温光致发光特性

Single crystals of C$_{60}$ saturated with molecular hydrogen and nitrogen were studied using the spectral-luminescent method of registration in the quantum counting mode at a low temperature of 20 K. Previously, it was found that the temperature limit of the adsorption crossover (the transition from the diffusion mechanism of intercalation - physisorption to chemical interaction - chemisorption) for fullerite C$_{60}$ in an H$_{2}$ atmosphere is about 525 K, and in an N$_{2}$ atmosphere 695 K, respectively. At saturation temperatures above those indicated, the process of chemical interaction of impurity molecules and the fullerite matrix occurs with the formation of new compounds. Therefore, saturation was carried out at temperatures of 570 K for hydrogen and 720 K for nitrogen under a pressure of 30 atm. For the first time, the results of registration of photoluminescent radiation at low temperatures from new substances based on fullerite C60 are presented. A mixture of weakly saturated fulleranes C$_{60}$H$_{X}$ was obtained by saturation of hydrogen from the gas phase at a temperature close to the sorption crossover temperature, and their low-temperature photoluminescence was identified for the first time. The analysis of the "blue" shift of the beginning of the spectrum of such radiation allowed us to more accurately attribute the obtained material to the initial segment of the fullerane series. The presence of radiation of the azafullerene dimer (biazafullerene) (C$_{59}$N)$_{2}$ in the spectra of the reaction products of C$_{60}$ with N$_{2}$ was also detected. It was shown that for polycrystalline samples of C$_{60}$ saturated in a nitrogen atmosphere, the characteristic luminescence of biazafullerene with a maximum at 1.53 eV determines the intensity and shape of the entire short-wave part of the emission spectrum of the complex of synthesized substances.

We present a non-perturbative approach to correlation functions and polyspectra of locally non-Gaussian fields and develop a simple semi-perturbative framework that does not rely on the local expansion. As an example, we apply it to locally non-Gaussian fields possessing exponential tails and derive some exact analytic results in the strongly non-Gaussian limit.

- **TL;DR**: α-T₃晶格中衬底缺陷线产生受拓扑保护的单向界面手性态，在垂直磁场下研究这些态如何受α参数调控，为基于α-T₃相的谷滤波器件设计提供理论依据。

The sublattice-symmetry breaking in the $α-T_3$ lattice leads to a bandgap opening. A defect line in the substrate on which the $α-T_3$ lattice is deposited can be viewed as a topological change in the substrate that induces translational in-plane symmetry breaking, resulting in mid-gap states. These topologically protected states are confined along the defect line and exhibit preferential directional motion, with different signs for the different Dirac valleys. Within this context, we investigate how these unidirectional interface chiral states are affected in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field and how they can be tuned by varying the controlling system parameter $α$. The latter tunes the $α-T_3$ structure from a honeycomb-like lattice ($α=0$) to a dice lattice ($α=1$). Our theoretical framework is based on the continuum approximation described by a $3\times 3$ matrix Hamiltonian with a sublattice symmetry-breaking term given by $Δ(x) diag(1,\quad -1,\quad 1)$, assuming $Δ(x)$ as a kink-like mass potential profile. Results for dispersion relations and wavefunction distributions for different $α$ parameters and magnetic field amplitudes are discussed. We demonstrate lifting of Landau levels degeneracy and of valley degeneracy. Our findings pave the way for proposing valley filter devices based on any evolutionary stage between the honeycomb-like and dice lattice structures of the $α-T_3$ phase, controlled by external fields.

### Semiclassical Routes to the $α$-RuCl$_3$ Scattering Continuum via Model Meta$-$Analysis

$α$-RuCl$_3$ is a leading material for proximate Kitaev magnetism. We address the origin of the broad, $Γ$-point centered excitation continuum observed by inelastic neutron scattering at elevated temperatures in this compound. Using stochastic Landau-Lifshitz dynamics augmented with quantum-equivalent corrections, we reproduce the temperature-dependent dynamical spin structure factor across both the correlated and conventional paramagnetic regimes. A meta-analysis of 38 published exchange parameter sets identifies those most consistent with the full temperature evolution. A Bayesian optimization procedure is used to derive parameters that capture the low-energy star-like momentum dependence and the overall bandwidth of the continuum. Rescaling temperatures by the Curie--Weiss scale produces a collapse of spectral measures, demonstrating that the high-$T$ dynamics are governed by correlated paramagnetism below $θ_{\mathrm{CW}}$ rather than by the Kitaev crossover to fractionalized excitations. Complementary 24-site exact diagonalization clarifies finite-size systematics at low temperature and the proximity to zigzag/incommensurate ordering. Beyond $α$-RuCl$_3$, our simulation pipeline provides a reproducible, data-driven framework to infer effective spin models in magnets that exhibit broad continua.

### Quantum critical behavior of cuprate superconductors observed by inelastic X-ray scattering

- **TL;DR**: 通过高分辨率RIXS研究La2-xSrxCuO4，发现量子临界标度行为，证实了铜氧化物超导体中存在量子临界点(QCP)，该QCP属于O(4)对称性普适类。

Progress toward a complete understanding of cuprate superconductors has been hindered by their intricate phase diagram, potentially linked to a quantum critical point (QCP). However, conclusive evidence for the QCP is lacking, as the presumed QCP is buried under the superconducting dome, disguising its presence. Here, we use high-resolution resonant inelastic X-ray scattering to examine the dynamical charge-charge correlation in La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ and uncover the quantum critical scaling, a key feature required for a QCP. Specifically, \djh{we observed that the inverse correlation lengths for various dopings and temperatures collapsed onto a universal scaling curve, yielding a critical exponent $ν$ of $0.74 \pm 0.08$. The non-negativity of this exponent confirms the presence of a QCP. Remarkably, the value of $ν$ suggests that while the QCP is manifested through the charge-density wave, other orders also participate, such that the QCP appears to belong to the universality class characterized by the O(4) symmetry, reminiscent of the microscopic SO(4) symmetry in the Hubbard model at half-filling. Further analysis indicates that the QCP is highly dissipative with a short quasi-particle lifetime, reflecting the intertwined quantum fluctuations due to its being buried inside the superconducting state.

### A web of exact mappings from RK models to spin chains

We study Rokhsar-Kivelson (RK) dimer and spin ice models realizing $U(1)$-lattice gauge theories in a wide class of quasi-one-dimensional settings, which define a setup for the study of few quantum strings (closed electric field lines) interacting with themselves and each other. We discover a large collection of mappings of these models onto three quantum chains: the spin-1/2 XXZ chain, a spin-1 chain, and a kinetically constrained fermion chain whose configurations are best described in terms of tilings of a rectangular strip. We show that the twist of boundary conditions in the chains maps onto the transverse momentum of the electric field string, and their Drude weight to the inverse of the string mass per unit length. We numerically determine the phase diagrams for these spin chains, employing DMRG simulations and find global similarities but also many interesting new features in comparison to the full 2D problems. For example, the spin-1 chain we obtain features a continuous family of degenerate ground states at its RK point analogous to a Bloch sphere, but without an underlying microscopic global $SU(2)$ symmetry. We also argue for the existence of a (stable) Landau-forbidden gapless critical point away from the RK point in one of the models we study using bosonization and numerics. This is surprising given that the full 2D problem is generically gapped away from the RK point. The same model also displays extensively many local conserved quantities which fragment the Hilbert space, arising as a consequence of destructive resonances between the electric field lines. Our findings highlight spin-chain mappings as a potent technique for the exploration of unusual dynamics, exotic criticality, and low-energy physics in lattice gauge theories.

We present a detailed benchmark comparing two state-of-the-art phase-field implementations for simulating alloy solidification under experimentally relevant conditions. The study investigates the directional solidification of Al-3wt%Cu under additive manufacturing conditions and SCN-0.46wt% camphor under microgravity conditions from National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) DECLIC-DSI-R experiments. Both codes, one employing finite-difference discretization with uniform mesh and GPU-acceleration and the other one employing finite-element discretization with adaptive-mesh and CPU-parallelization, solve the same quantitative phase-field formulation that incorporates an anti-trapping current for the solidification of dilute alloys. We evaluate the predictions of each code for dendritic morphology, primary spacing, and tip dynamics in both 2D and 3D, as well as their numerical convergence and computational performance. While existing benchmark problems have primarily focused on simplified or small-scale simulations, they do not reflect the computational and modeling challenges posed by employing experimentally relevant time and length scales. Our results provide a practical framework for assessing phase-field code performance as well as validating and facilitating their application in integrated computational materials engineering (ICME) workflows that require integration with realistic experimental data.

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is fundamental for molecular structure elucidation, yet interpreting spectra at scale remains time-consuming and highly expertise-dependent. While recent spectrum-as-language modeling and retrieval-based methods have shown promise, they rely heavily on large corpora of computed spectra and exhibit notable performance drops when applied to experimental measurements. To address these issues, we build NMRSpec, a large-scale corpus of experimental $^1$H and $^{13}$C spectra mined from chemical literature, and propose NMRTrans, which models spectra as unordered peak sets and aligns the model's inductive bias with the physical nature of NMR. To our best knowledge, NMRTrans is the first NMR Transformer trained solely on large-scale experimental spectra and achieves state-of-the-art performance on experimental benchmarks, improving Top-10 Accuracy over the strongest baseline by +17.82 points (61.15% vs. 43.33%), and underscoring the importance of experimental data and structure-aware architectures for reliable NMR structure elucidation.

- **TL;DR**: 本文回顾并扩展了谐波约束Vicsek模型，通过引入各向异性约束来解释野外观察到的蚊群集体行为，包括强相关性、尺度自由行为和幂律等特征。

As collective states of animal groups go, swarms of midge insects pose a number of puzzling questions. Their ordering polarization parameter is quite small and the insects are weakly coupled among themselves but strongly coupled to the swarm. In laboratory studies (free of external perturbations), the correlation length is small, whereas midge swarms exhibit strong correlations, scale free behavior and power laws for correlation length, susceptibility and correlation time in field studies. Data for the dynamic correlation function versus time collapse to a single curve only for small values of time scaled with the correlation time. Is there a theory that explains these disparate observations? Among the existing theories, whodunnit? Here we review and discuss several models proposed in the literature and extend our own one, the harmonically confined Vicsek model, to anisotropic confinement. Numerical simulations of the latter produce elongated swarm shapes and values of the static critical exponents between those of the two dimensional and isotropic three dimensional models. The new values agree better with those measured in natural swarms.

In this work, we numerically investigate linear thermal noise in a four-terminal system with a finite Berry curvature dipole (BCD) using the nonequilibrium Green's function formalism. By comparing with the semiclassical results for bulk systems, we establish a one-to-one correspondence between terminal-resolved linear noise in multi-terminal systems and direction-resolved noise in bulk transport. Specifically, the auto-correlation function scales as $2 k_B T$ when the driving field is perpendicular to the BCD and vanishes when they are parallel, whereas the cross-correlation scales as $k_B T$. Both the auto- and cross-correlation functions exhibit pronounced peaks near the band edges, consistent with BCD-induced features. In addition, the linear thermal noise increases approximately linearly with $T$ at low temperatures and is suppressed by dephasing effect at high temperatures. Our work bridges semiclassical bulk theory and quantum multi-terminal theory for linear thermal noise, highlighting the symmetry(geometry)-selection rule in quantum transport.

Rechargeable aqueous zinc-ion batteries (RAZIBs) attract considerable scientific and commercial interest for deployment in grid-scale energy storage due to higher safety and lower manufacturing cost when compared to lithium-ion batteries. However, currently studied cathode materials suffer from severe capacity fade when cycling at rates appropriate for grid-scale applications ($&lt;$ C/2), which hampers the commercialization of RAZIBs. To address the present limitation on cathode material availability, more than 2000 previously synthesized oxides, chalcogenides, Prussian blue analogues, and polyanion materials were computationally screened for the discovery of highly stable RAZIB cathode materials. The structural, electrochemical, and chemical properties of the materials were respectively evaluated through an investigation of the available Zn$^{2+}$ percolation paths in the crystal structure, the stability of the material in aqueous media under RAZIB operation conditions, and the attained transition metal oxidation state during cycling. The transition metal oxidation state and intercalating ion coordination environment were determined to govern the magnitude of the calculated intercalation potential, with this finding directly supporting the development of batteries with high operation potentials. Finally, 10 previously unexplored materials were identified with leading metrics for operation as RAZIB cathode materials, such as high Zn$^{2+}$ (de)intercalation potential, electrochemical stability, theoretical gravimetric capacity, and energy density, being here proposed for experimental testing. The materials identified in this study demonstrate a guide for advancing the available cathode materials for RAZIB, and help expedite the establishment of RAZIB as a commercially viable technology for grid-scale energy storage.

The undoped Kondo necklace in 1D is a paradigmatic and well understood model of a Kondo insulator. This work performs the first large-scale study of the 1D Anderson-lattice underlying the Kondo necklace with quasi-exact numerical methods, comparing this with the perturbative effective 1D Kondo-necklace model derived from the former. This study is based on an exact mapping of the Anderson model to one of a superconducting pairing layer connected to a metallic reservoir which is valid in arbitrary spatial dimensions, thereby linking the previously disparate areas of reservoir-enhanced superconductivity, following Kivelson's pioneering proposals, and that of periodic Kondo-systems. Our work reveals that below the length-scales on which the insulating state sets in, which can be very large, superconducting and density-density correlations are degenerate and may both appear to approach an almost ordered state, to a degree that far exceeds that of any isolated 1D pairing layer with short-range interactions. We trace these effects to the effective extended-range coupling that the metallic layer mediates within the pairing layer. These results translate directly to the appearance of near-long-range magnetic order at intermediate scales in the Kondo-systems, and explain the strong renormalization of the RKKY-coupling that we effectively observe, in terms of the back-action of the pairing layer onto the metallic layer. The effects we predict could be tested either by local probes of quasi-1D heavy fermion compounds such as CeCo$_2$Ga$_8$, in engineered chains of ad-atoms or in ultracold atomic gases.

- **TL;DR**: EuRhAl4Si2材料中发现了原子级尖锐的一维磁孤子，这是由高度受挫的交换相互作用与磁各向异性竞争产生的拓扑自旋纹理。

Topological spin textures are hallmark manifestations of competing interactions in magnetic matter. Their effective description by nonlinear field theories reflects an energetic frustration that destabilizes uniform order while selecting finite-size, topologically nontrivial configurations as stationary states. Among the most extreme realizations are atomically-sharp domain wall excitations, namely one-dimensional (1D) magnetic solitons, which represent the ultimate scaling limit of magnetic textures. Such solitons may emerge in magnetic systems where effective exchange interactions compete directly with uniaxial magnetic anisotropy. Here we show that the square-net rare earth compound EuRhAl$_{4}$Si$_{2}$ realizes a very susceptible regime where the magnetic anisotropy competes with highly frustrated exchange interactions stabilizing a rare ferrimagnetic $\uparrow\uparrow\downarrow$ state that, under applied magnetic field, supports the formation of atomically-sharp soliton defects. We confirm the bulk response of the 1D magnetic solitons via magnetization and electrical transport measurements. We establish both the zero- and in-field $\uparrow\uparrow\downarrow$ order via neutron diffraction, while magnetic force microscopy visualizes its real-space evolution into a stripe-like array. To elucidate the microscopic origin of the soliton, we relate the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY)-driven exchange interactions and the magnetic anisotropy through density functional theory, and we construct an effective 1D $J_{1}$-$J_{2}$-$K$ model whose atomistic spin dynamics simulations reproduce the observed soliton states as a function of external field. Our results demonstrate that EuRhAl$_{4}$Si$_{2}$ hosts atomically-sharp, field-driven 1D magnetic solitons, providing a new platform for studying 1D topological excitations at the atomic length scale.

We investigate ion pairing dynamics in electrolytes driven far from equilibrium using molecular simulations and nonequilibrium rate theory. Focusing on 0.5 M $\mathrm{LiPF_6}$ in water and acetonitrile under uniform electric fields, we compute transition path theory observables including reactive fluxes and mean first-passage times of ion pairing. Moreover, we introduce a dynamical proxy of free-ion population, where its field-induced change is strongly correlated with the nonlinear enhancement of conductivity, yielding an increase of $40 \ \%$ at 50 mV/Å in acetonitrile, compared to less than $10 \ \%$ in aqueous electrolytes. Further kinetic analysis elucidates that Onsager's classical theory substantially overestimates field-induced enhancement of ion pair dissociation in molecular electrolytes. This discrepancy arises from solvent-mediated dynamical pathways and field-induced dielectric decrement that suppress ion pair dissociation within explicit solvents, highlighting that a faithful description of molecular details is essential. Our results provide a molecular interpretation of nonlinear electrolyte transport beyond continuum theories and establish a general framework for quantifying nonequilibrium reaction kinetics in condensed phase systems.

Thermodynamic cycles are idealized processes that can convert heat into work or produce heat flow against a temperature gradient with the input of work. They remain an active area of research in modern stochastic thermodynamics. In particular, cyclic active heat engines have been shown to display a rich phenomenology, such as ``violations'' of the Carnot bound on efficiency and an improved performance in comparison to their passive counterparts. We introduce the concept of cyclic active refrigerators using a previously derived second law for cyclic active systems. We show that for cyclic active refrigerators, a naive definition of the coefficient of performance can exceed the bound set by the standard second law for passive refrigerators. We also show that cyclic active systems can behave like a Maxwell's demon, with heat flowing from the cold to the hot reservoir without any work input. Beyond this phase, cyclic active systems can enter a hybrid phase, functioning as both a heat engine and a refrigerator simultaneously. Our results are obtained with two models that involve active Brownian particles, a simpler one that allows for analytical results and a more realistic one that is analyzed through numerical simulations.

We investigate fractional edge modes in moire fractional quantum anomalous Hall states, focusing on the role of lattice momentum conservation and umklapp scattering. For the hierarchical nu=2/3 state, we show that, for a class of microscopic edge realizations, moire-enabled umklapp processes can stabilize the Kane-Fisher-Polchinski fixed point even in the absence of disorder.Our results illustrate how lattice momentum constraints can qualitatively reshape the interaction structure and low-energy behavior of fractional edge modes. The study of Umklapp processes in edge reconstruction serves as a crucial bridge to understanding thermal and electrical transport in the hierarchical fractional quantum anomalous Hall states found in lattice systems of quantum simulators.

A family of ferrimagnets (CoV2O4, GdCo, TbCo) exhibits out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy when strained compressively and in-plane magnetic anisotropy when strained expansively (or vice versa). If such a ferrimagnetic thin film is placed on top of a topological insulator (TI) thin film and its magnetic anisotropy is modulated with strain, then interfacial exchange coupling between the ferrimagnet (FM) and the underlying TI will modulate the surface current flowing through the latter. If the strain is varied continuously, the current will also vary continuously and if the strain alternates in time, the current will also alternate with the frequency of the strain modulation, as long as the frequency is not so high that the period is smaller than the switching time of the FM. If the strain is generated with a gate voltage by integrating a piezoelectric underneath the FM/TI stack, then that can implement a transconductance amplifier or a synapse for neuromorphic computation.

The understanding of the mechanisms responsible for superconductivity in strongly correlated systems is an interesting and important subject in condensed matter physics. Several theoretical proposals were considered for these systems. The Coulomb interaction between electrons allow a new approach to study this problem. In this paper, we use a usual Hubbard model with a local repulsive interaction to describe a 2D system. The system of equations are solved using the Green's functions method, within a Hubbard-I mean field approximation, which allows to treat the strong interaction limit. We consider both cases of attractive and repulsive interactions and obtain the zero temperature phase diagram of the model. Our results show, in the repulsive case, the existence of a superconducting ground state mediated by the kinetic electronic energy and described by a non-local order parameter. A minimum value of the repulsive interaction $U_{min}$ is required to create a pairing state. At finite temperatures, for strong interactions, the critical temperature $T_c$ shows a saturation similar to the Bose-Einstein condensation observed for strong attractive interactions.

A multicomponent second-order Møller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) method is derived and implemented within the constrained nuclear-electronic orbital (cNEO) framework from a multicomponent generalization of the Hylleraas functional. The cNEO-MP2 method includes electronic-nuclear and nuclear correlation in the calculation of vibrationally averaged molecular properties, and is the first post Hartree-Fock wavefunction-based cNEO method. Nuclear quantum effects like vibrational averaging, isotopic effects, and zero-point energy can be captured in a single calculation or geometry optimization with cNEO-MP2, eliminating the need to perform costly subsequent calculations to determine higher order force constants as required with many existing methods used to determine vibrational effects upon molecular properties. The cNEO-MP2 method is benchmarked on a test set of diatomic and small polyatomic molecules and ions. Herein, we present internuclear distances, bond angles, potential energy surfaces, and vibrational frequencies calculated with the cNEO-MP2 method to demonstrate that it correctly captures the effects of nuclear vibrational motion upon molecular properties.

### Thermodynamic Optimization of Sensory Adaptation via Game-Theoretic Path Integrals

- **TL;DR**: 提出基于变分自由能原理的场论框架，将感觉适应解释为生物体与环境间的随机微分博弈，揭示了适应动力学与模型参考自适应控制的数学等价性。

Biological sensory systems, from \textit{E.~coli} chemotaxis to sensory neurons in \textit{C.~elegans}, achieve reliable adaptation over wide dynamic ranges despite operating in strongly noisy and overdamped regimes. Here, we present a field-theoretic framework in which sensory adaptation emerges from a variational free-energy principle, formulated as a stochastic differential game between an organism and its environment. Using an Onsager--Machlup path-integral formalism, we show that the resulting adaptive dynamics are mathematically equivalent to a class of model reference adaptive control schemes and can be interpreted as a dynamic renormalization of the system's Green's function. Within this framework, the phasic overshoot commonly observed in sensory responses arises naturally from an effective inertia ($m^* \approx τγ$) generated by memory-dissipation coupling, rather than from biochemical fine-tuning. Quantitative fits to experimental data across species yield $R^2 &gt; 0.88$, and indicate that adaptive sensory processing operates within a narrow thermodynamically optimal regime bounded by signal-to-noise and stability constraints.

### Dispersive detection of a charge qubit with a broadband high-impedance quantum-Hall plasmon resonator

Cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) provides strong light-matter interactions that can be used for manipulating and detecting quantum states. The interaction can be enhanced by increasing the resonator's impedance, while approaching the quantum impedance ($h/e^2$) remains challenging. Edge plasmons emergent as chiral bosonic modes in the quantum Hall channels provide high quantized impedance of $h/ νe^2$ that can exceed 10 k$Ω$ for the Landau-level filling factor $ν\leq 2$, well beyond the impedance of free space. Here, we apply such a high-impedance plasmon mode in a quantum-Hall plasmon resonator to demonstrate dispersive detection of a nearby charge qubit formed in a double quantum dot. The phase shift in microwave transmission through the plasmon resonator follows the dispersive shift associated with the qubit state in agreement with the cQED theory. The high impedance allows us to perform dispersive detection of qubit spectroscopy with a plasmon resonator having a broad bandwidth. Leveraging these topological edge modes, our results establish two-dimensional topological insulators as a new platform of cQED.

### Connection between $GW$ and Extended Coupled Cluster

Coupled-cluster (CC) theory and Green's function many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) have long evolved as distinct yet complementary frameworks for describing electronic correlation. While CC methods employ exponential wavefunction parametrizations that guarantee size extensivity and systematic improvability, Green's function approaches such as the $GW$ approximation describe quasiparticle and optical excitations through diagrammatic resummations. Recent analyses have established a formal correspondence between these frameworks: the $GW$ approximation is equivalent to an equation-of-motion (EOM) treatment of the direct-ring coupled-cluster doubles (drCCD) method. Within this context, the extended CC (ECC) ansatz offers a unified framework connecting CC and MBPT. This formulation bridges CC-based and Green's function-based methods, providing novel avenues for incorporating vertex corrections within a CC framework that keep a positive semi-definite self-energy and lead to potentially systematically improvable Green's function approaches.

### Interplay of ion availability and mobility in the loss of cation selectivity for CaCl\textsubscript{2} in negatively charged nanopores: molecular dynamics using scaled-charge models

Ion transport through charged nanopores is commonly interpreted in terms of electrical double layer structure, leading to the expectation of cation-selective conduction in negatively charged pores. This picture can break down for multivalent electrolytes, where strong ion-urface correlations and charge inversion modify transport behavior. Here, we study NaCl and CaCl$_2$ conduction through negatively charged silica nanopores using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations with scaled-charge ion models. By separating concentration and velocity contributions to the radial particle current density, we connect static adsorption to dynamic perm-selectivity. While NaCl exhibits conventional cation selectivity, CaCl$_2$ shows nearly bulk-like or even anion-favored transport due to Ca$^{2+}$ immobilization near the surface and dominant Cl$^-$ conduction in the pore interior following charge inversion. Although this qualitative mechanism is robust, its detailed manifestation depends sensitively on the balance of ion-surface and ion-water interactions encoded in the force field.

### Ferroelectric Quantum Point Contact in Twisted Transition Metal Dichalcogenides

In twisted transition metal dichalcogenides (tTMDs), atomic reconstruction gives rise to moiré domains with alternating ferroelectric polarization, whose domain size and overall electric dipole moment are tunable by an out-of-plane electric field. Previous transport measurements in Hall bar devices have successfully demonstrated the overall ferroelectric behavior of tTMDs from a collective ensemble of ferroelectric moiré domains. To locally probe a single ferroelectric moiré domain, we fabricate and study mesoscopic quantum transport via a gate-defined twisted molybdenum disulfide (tMoS2) quantum point contact (QPC). The local property of a single moiré domain is invulnerable to long-range disorder and twist-angle inhomogeneity, resulting in an unusually long conductance plateau with large electrical hysteresis. The comparison between local and global measurements confirms that antiferroelectricity can emerge from alternating polarization of individual ferroelectric domains. Using a QPC as a single charge sensor, we characterize the nature and time scale of different domain evolution mechanisms with single atomic dipole resolution. Our findings shed new light on the microscopic ferroelectric behavior and dynamics within a single tTMD moiré domain, paving the way toward more advanced ferroelectric quantum devices with tunable local Hamiltonian, such as ferroelectric tTMD quantum dots (QDs).

### Self-pinning mechanism for grain boundary stabilization

Previous research focused on two different mechanisms of microstructure stabilization in alloys: thermodynamic stabilization by reducing the grain boundary (GB) free energy and kinetic stabilization by suppressing the GB mobility by solute drag or embedded pinning particles. Here, we propose a new GB stabilization mechanism, called self-pinning, in which the segregation atmosphere of a moving GB spontaneously breaks into solute-rich clusters, which produce a strong pinning effect in addition to the free energy reduction resulting from the segregation. The cluster formation is caused by strong solute-solute attraction at GBs, leading to a first-order transformation between solute-lean and solute-rich GB phases. The effect is demonstrated by kinetic Monte Carlo simulations capturing segregation thermodynamics, GB dynamics, and solute diffusion. The self-pinning provides an intrinsic stabilization mechanism for suppressing grain growth that couples thermodynamics and kinetics. The mechanism obviates the need for pre-existing second phase inclusions, refocusing the alloy design on GB phase behavior.

Despite the great success Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KS-DFT) has achieved, the delocalization error remains a major challenge for commonly used density functional approximations (DFAs), resulting in systematic errors in ionization energies, electron affinities, band structures, and charge distributions. A recently developed localized orbital scaling correction (LOSC) method, namely linear response LOSC (lrLOSC), addresses these challenges by incorporating a functional correction that includes the screening effect and orbital localization within the LOSC framework. The method has been shown to provide accurate descriptions of bulk systems and core-level binding energies in small molecular systems. In this work, we extend the applicability of lrLOSC to a broader range of molecular systems, spanning various sizes, with a focus on the corrections to valence orbital energies and total energies. To enable the calculation of large chemical systems, we developed an efficient implementation of lrLOSC with computational costs comparable to standard KS-DFT calculations. Numerical results show that, while screening provides modest improvements for small molecules, it becomes critical for achieving high accuracy in larger molecules, from linear to three-dimensional systems. With the screening effect well captured in a unified way, lrLOSC provides accurate descriptions for a wide range of chemical systems, including organic molecular systems of varying sizes and transition-metal oxide complexes, establishing it as a powerful tool for enhancing the reliability of computational simulations of chemical systems.

The aim of this paper is to offer an analytic theory of the shear banding instability in amorphous solids that are subjected to athermal quasi-static shear. To this aim we derive nonlinear equations for the displacement field, including the consequences of plastic deformation on the mechanical response of amorphous solids. The plastic events collectively induce distributed dipoles that are responsible for screening effects and the creation of typical length-scales that are absent in classical elasticity theory. The nonlinear theory exposes an instability that results in the creation of shear bands. By solving the weakly nonlinear amplitude equation we present analytic expressions for the displacement fields that is associated with shear bands, explaining the role of the elastic moduli that determine the width of a shear band from ductile to brittle characteristics. We derive an energy functional whose Hessian possesses an eigenvalue that goes to zero at the shear-banding instability, providing a prediction for the critical value of the accumulated stress that results in an instability.

The dispersion of Rashba-split heavy-hole subbands in GaAs two-dimensional hole gases (2DHGs) is difficult to access experimentally because strong heavy-hole-light-hole mixing produces non-parabolicity and breaks the usual correspondence between carrier density and Fermi wave vector. Here we use low-field magnetotransport (B &lt; 1 T) to reconstruct the dispersions of the two spin-orbit-split heavy-hole branches (HH-, HH+) in undoped (100) GaAs/AlGaAs single heterojunction 2DHGs operated in an accumulation-mode field-effect geometry. The dopant-free devices sustain out-of-plane electric fields up to 26 kV/cm while maintaining mobilities up to 84 m$^2$/Vs and exhibiting a spin-orbit polarization as large as 36%. Fourier analysis of Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations resolves the individual HH-/HH+ subband densities; fitting the temperature dependence of the corresponding Fourier amplitudes yields both branch-resolved SdH effective masses over the same magnetic field window. SdH regimes in which reliable subband parameters can be extracted are delineated. Over 2DHG densities (0.76-1.9) $\times$ 10$^{15}$ /m$^2$, the HH- mass is nearly density independent ($\approx 0.34m_e$), implying a near-parabolic HH- dispersion below the first LH+/HH- anticrossing, whereas HH+ exhibits strong non-parabolicity with an effective mass that increases with density. Combining the extracted dispersions yields a transport-based determination of the spin-orbit splitting energy $Δ_\text{HH}$ between HH and HH+ as a function of in-plane wave vector. Parameter-free Luttinger-model calculations reproduce the qualitative trends but underestimate both masses by a common factor $\approx$ 2, suggesting a many-body renormalization of the heavy-hole mass in this strongly asymmetric regime.

We demonstrate control of helimagnetic order in biaxially strained SrFeO3 thin films using neutron diffraction and resonant soft x-ray scattering. SrFeO3, a negative charge-transfer oxide, exhibits a complex magnetic phase diagram that includes multi-q spin structures. Tensile epitaxial strain produces a pronounced shortening of the helimagnetic ordering length and a tilting of the magnetic ordering vector. We interpret this behavior in terms of chemical expansion: lattice dilation under tensile strain lowers the energetic cost of oxygen vacancies, leading to an expanded unit cell that modifies Fe-O hybridization and enhances superexchange relative to double exchange. These results reveal how epitaxial strain can indirectly tune helimagnetism through defect-driven chemical expansion, highlighting the strong coupling between lattice, chemistry, and magnetic order in transition-metal oxides. Our findings establish chemical expansion as an effective mechanism for engineering complex magnetic textures in oxide thin films, with implications for spintronic, magnonic, and quantum information applications.

The convergence of self-consistent field equations in mean-field nuclear-electronic orbital methods strongly depends on the choice of initial guesses for quantum nuclei. Although several such guesses have been proposed in the literature, a systematic comparison of their performance as well as attempts of constructing novel approximations based on model tasks of quantum mechanics were not reported to date. In this work, we address both issues by introducing novel nuclear initial guesses derived from the analytical solutions of the three-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator and benchmarking them against existing approaches. We demonstrate that the isotropic variant of our guess outperforms existing approximations in nuclear-electronic orbital density functional theory calculations employing a simultaneous self-consistent field convergence protocol. Although our guess requires the computation of partial Hessians, we demonstrate that these can be evaluated with low-cost methods without affecting the accuracy of resulting protonic density matrices. Our results demonstrate that the proposed guess is robust and efficient and could provide a route to improved convergence in mean-field nuclear-electronic orbital computations.

A theory of structure is formulated for systems of many structureless classical particles with stable local interactions in Euclidean space. Such systems are shown to have their structure in thermodynamic equilibrium determined exactly by a random field of fine local descriptions and approximately by coarsenings thereof. The degree of order in the local cluster consisting of a particle and its neighbors is identified as a universal source of coarse local descriptions and characterized by expressing the behavior of configurational entropy in local microscopic terms. A local measure of the angular redundancy in neighboring particle positions is found to satisfy this characterization and thereby established as a valid local order quantifier. A precise relationship between order and symmetry is obtained by bounding this quantifier sharply from below by a simple function of the local point group and the largest stabilizer under its action on the set of bond pairs. The marginal distribution of the quantifier is given in closed form for highly coordinated particles with broadly distributed bond angles. Applications are made to the ideal gas, perfect crystal, and simple liquid.

Open quantum systems are often described by a Lindblad master equation, which relies on a set of approximations, most importantly the rotating-wave approximation which is only valid for weak damping. In the Lindblad setting, dissipative processes are described through jump operators, distinguishing between absorption and emission of photons. This enables the simple identification of emitted photons which provides a straightforward way to obtain the radiation statistics. Outside the rotating-wave limit, the Lindblad approach does not work. Open quantum systems can then be described by, e.g., the quantum Langevin equation. However, in this framework the number of emitted photons is not easily accessible. In this work, we point out how to obtain the photon counting statistics from a quantum Langevin equation and provide an expression for the photon current operator, for arbitrary systems coupled to linear environments. As an example, we employ the method to study the radiation statistics of a damped harmonic oscillator at finite temperature beyond the rotating-wave approximation. We show that even outside the rotating-wave limit, the most important contribution to the radiation statistics can be captured by an effective Lindblad equation, thus extending the range of possible applications of the Lindblad framework.

Two-dimensional magnetic semiconductors provide a unique materials platform in which long-range magnetic order coexists with strongly bound excitons. Because excitonic states and magnetic moments originate from the same electronic orbitals and are coupled through intrinsic exchange interactions, optical excitations in these systems exhibit pronounced sensitivity to magnetic order. Recent experiments have revealed unusually strong magneto-optical responses, as well as direct coupling between excitons and magnons, establishing new routes for controlling light-matter interactions with spin degrees of freedom. This Review surveys key developments in the field, focusing on representative material systems, experimental signatures of exciton-magnetism coupling, and the theoretical frameworks used to describe these phenomena. We conclude with perspectives on how this rapidly evolving field could enable next-generation optoelectronic and quantum technologies leveraging the coupled dynamics of light, charge, and spin.

Binding energies (BEs) of adsorbates on interstellar dust grains critically control adsorption, desorption, diffusion, and surface reactivity, and therefore strongly influence astrochemical models of star- and planet-forming regions. While recent computational studies increasingly report full distributions of BEs rather than single representative values, these distributions are typically derived for either bare grain surfaces or thick water-ice mantles. In this work, we bridge these regimes by systematically investigating the BE distributions of water on partially and fully ice-covered dust grain surfaces.
  We employ machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) based on graph neural networks to model water adsorption on graphene and on the Mg-terminated (010) surface of forsterite, representing carbonaceous and silicate grains, respectively. The models enable extensive sampling of adsorption sites on water clusters, monolayers, and bilayers generated under both crystalline (thermally processed) and amorphous (low-temperature) growth conditions. At submonolayer coverage, the chemical nature of the underlying grain strongly affects both ice morphology and binding energies, with Mg-O interactions on silicate surfaces producing particularly deep binding sites. From monolayer coverage onward, adsorption on both substrates is dominated by hydrogen bonding within the ice, reducing the influence of the grain material.
  Across all coverages, amorphous ice structures systematically shift the BE distributions toward stronger binding compared to crystalline ice, introducing highly stable defect and pocket sites. These results demonstrate that BE distributions in the submonolayer to few-layer ice regime are broad and highly surface dependent, and they provide physically motivated input for next-generation astrochemical models incorporating surface heterogeneity.

### Scaling and Universality at Noise-Affected Non-Equilibrium Spin Correlation Functions

We investigate scaling and universality in nonequilibrium spin correlation functions in the presence of uncorrelated noise. In the absence of noise, spin correlation functions exhibit a crossover from monotonic decay at fast sweep velocities to oscillatory behavior at slow sweeps. We show that, under a stochastically driven field, the critical sweep velocity at which the spin correlation functions undergo an abrupt change decreases with increasing noise strength and scales linearly with the square of the noise intensity. Remarkably, when the noise intensity and sweep velocity are comparable, the excitation probability becomes locked to pk = 1/2 over a finite momentum window, signaling the emergence of noise-induced maximally mixed modes. This gives rise to a highly oscillatory region in the dynamical phase diagram, whose threshold sweep velocity increases with noise and likewise exhibits quadratic scaling with the noise strength. Finally, we identify a universal scaling function under which all boundary sweep-velocity curves collapse onto a single universal curve.

### Pseudorotation and N-body Forces in an Optical Matter System

Isomerization in molecular systems almost invariably occurs through 3-dimensional motion due to the nature of chemical bonding. Pseudorotation is an unusual type of isomerization that occurs in some high symmetry systems that gives the appearance of rigid-body rotation yet only involves atom rearrangements. This paper demonstrates that pseudorotation occurs in 2-dimensions in an optical matter (OM) system of metal nanoparticle constituents. The difference in dimensionality of the dynamics arises from the electrodynamic field-interference nature of optical binding vs. quantum mechanical bonding in polyatomic molecules. The 8-nanoparticle OM "kite" structure we study in experiments and simulations has D2 (D2h) symmetry and a D4 symmetric transition state. The mechanism for pseudorotation involves correlated motion of all 8 nanoparticles with smooth (continuous) evolution of their interactions and without particles jumping in or out of the OM array. While the OM kite structure only occurs with 10% probability vs. other OM isomers, its rate of pseudorotation is rapid relative to transitions to other structural isomers (e.g., "teardrop"). The other isomers have structures that lie on a trigonal lattice with inter-particle separations at distances that enhance field interference and induced polarizations. Even though the kite isomer has inter-particle separations that would manifest destructive interference on a particle pair (i.e., 2-body) basis, the kite structure is the slowest to rearrange into any other isomer. We show that the unusual structure and dynamics of the kite optical matter system result from N-body interactions and forces demonstrating that N-body effects are important in this class of active matter and presumably more generally.

- **TL;DR**: 利用低损耗EELS研究二维moiré金纳米晶超晶格的等离子体激发，发现电子束激发光学探针无法探测的垂直极化模式，EELS与光学光谱提供互补信息。

Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) has been established as a powerful analytical technique for investigating the oxidation state, band structure, and dielectric properties of materials with exceptional spatial resolution. Inspired by twisted 2D materials, we utilize low-loss EELS to examine the plasmonic excitations in 2D moiré Au nanocrystal superlattices (NCSLs) formed by liquid-air interface self-assembly using a double-dipping method. This approach produces stacked hexagonal layers that can be twisted, forming moiré patterns in NCSLs whose twist angles are precisely measured via scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). Low-loss EELS effectively mitigates challenges arising from fabrication-induced non-uniformity and reveals a blue shift in plasmonic excitation when comparing single-layer, double-layer, and twisted configurations. This sharply contrasts with the optical spectroscopy measurements, which show an overall red shift relative to the EELS data. The high spatial resolution of STEM-EELS further demonstrates that twist-induced symmetry breaking strongly influences plasmonic behavior. Coupled dipole modeling explains the observed discrepancies: the electron beam excites out-of-plane polarization modes unavailable to optical probes, while optical measurements average over ensembles. Our findings highlight that EELS provides complementary information to optical spectroscopy for understanding how structural arrangements at the nanoscale influence collective electronic properties, advancing the design of plasmonic metamaterials.

Biological machines like molecular motors and enzymes operate in dynamic cycles representable as stochastic flows on networks. Current stochastic dynamics describes such flows on fixed networks. Here, we develop a scalable approach to network design in which local transition rates can be systematically varied to achieve global dynamical objectives. It is based on the fluctuation-response duality in the recent Caliber Force Theory -- a path-entropy variational formalism for nonequilibria. This approach scales efficiently with network complexity and gives new insights, for example revealing the transition from timing- to branching-dominated fluctuations in a kinesin motor model.

This work investigates the Floquet dynamics of electrons and excitons (particle-hole pairs) in a Dirac material referred to as Kekulé-distorted graphene. Specifically, we examine the role played by a high frequency driving electromagnetic field on the tunneling and blocking by a potential barrier on both the charged single particles as well as the neutral composite particles. We demonstrate that the small effective masses of the electron and hole for the energy spectrum of this Kekulé distorted graphene leads to practically almost perfect transmission across a symmetric potential barrier for any angle of incidence of impinging excitons. However, this unexpected Klein paradox for excitons does not hold for the single-particle electrons. The reduced total transmission of electron due to Kekulé distortion is more suppressed due to irradiation. Additionally, we calculate and investigate the exciton binding energy since the quantum tunneling of a bound electron-hole pair across a potential barrier is governed by its mass measured in the center of mass and binding energy of the composite pair. Thus, irradiation with circularly polarized light fundamentally modifies exciton formation, coherence and transport properties, thereby producing unusual topological behaviors. These behaviors are unlike conventional Dirac materials. Possible technical applications of the results arising from our investigation include valleytronics due to the folding of the valleys, thereby making intervalley coupling feasible. Other practical applications include optoelectronics due to Floquet tuning of energy spectrum and transport properties.

The antiferroaxial state is emerging as an important ferroic order in condensed matter systems. Here, we establish antiferroaxial altermagnetism as a broadly prevalent, generic, and microscopically grounded multiferroic mechanism, in which antiferroaxial counter-rotating distortions both induce altermagnetism and enable its deterministic and reversible switching. Within a unified Landau-theory and symmetry framework, we identify a symmetry-allowed trilinear invariant coupling the antiferroaxial order, the Néel vector, and the altermagnetic order, and derive general symmetry criteria for its occurrence. This coupling locks the induced altermagnetism to the antiferroaxial order, so that reversing the latter reverses the spin splitting and associated time-reversal-odd responses, such as anomalous Hall conductivity. We provide a practical spin group dictionary mapping Néel-vector representations to the resulting $d$-, $g$-, and $i$-wave antiferroaxial altermagnetism, validate the mechanism with ligand-rotation tight-binding models and first-principles calculations, and identify many candidate materials by screening the MAGNDATA and C2DB databases. Our results elevate antiferroaxiality to a universal ferroic control knob for structurally programmable altermagnetic spintronics.

### Stochastic synthesis-degradation processes: first-passage properties and connections with resetting

Processes controlled by stochastic synthesis and degradation (SSD) are widespread in biology but their reaction kinetics are not well understood. Using methods borrowed from the theory of resetting processes, we determine the first-passage properties of a collection of independent particles that are synthesized and degraded at constant rates, and follow an arbitrary diffusive process in space. At equal synthesis and degradation rates, the mean reaction time with a target site can be minimized as in stochastic resetting, and a $CV$-criterion is derived. When the degradation rate is held fixed and the synthesis costs are taken into account, an optimal synthesis rate is obtained. In bounded domains, despite particle degradation, SSD improves the mean search time compared to a single non-degrading particle if the synthesis rate exceeds a critical value. The latter obeys a universal relation. We illustrate these findings with Brownian diffusion on the infinite line and in an interval.

Non-reciprocal systems exhibit extreme sensitivity to boundary conditions, typically manifesting as the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) under open boundaries. By bridging the boundaries with a tunable impurity bond, one can access intermediate regimes where scale-free localization (SFL) can emerge. Here, we investigate the competition between such boundary coupling and quasiperiodic disorder in a non-reciprocal lattice. Our analyses reveal a quasiperiodicity-induced breakdown of the SFL regime, which evolves into either the NHSE or an extended regime, depending on boundary conditions. These results uncover the crucial role of quasiperiodicity in non-Hermitian systems.

We report on nonlinear spin-wave dynamics in magnonic Fabry-Pérot resonators composed of yttrium iron garnet (YIG) films coupled to CoFeB nanostripes. Using super-Nyquist sampling magneto-optical Kerr effect microscopy and micromagnetic simulations, we observe a systematic downshift of the spin-wave transmission gaps as the excitation power increases. This nonlinear behavior occurs at low power levels, reduced by a strong spatial concentration of spin waves within the resonator. The resulting power-dependent transmission enables neuron-like activation behavior and frequency-selective nonlinear spin-wave absorption. Our results highlight magnonic Fabry-Pérot resonators as compact low-power nonlinear elements for neuromorphic magnonic computing architectures.

In the present work, we experimentally realize CoVGe for the first time and investigate its structural, magnetic, and transport properties, supported by theoretical calculations. The material crystallizes in a cubic structure and exhibits a very low magnetic moment of 0.13 μB per formula unit at 5 K. The temperature dependence of electrical resistivity suggests half-metallic behaviour. Magnetoresistance shows a positive, non-saturating linear field dependence at low temperature that gradually weakens with increasing temperature. The combination of low magnetic moment and unusual magnetotransport behaviour positions CoVGe as a promising platform for exploring spin-dependent transport in Heusler-based materials.

Many biological processes involve numerous coupled degrees of freedom, yet free-energy estimation is often restricted to one-dimensional profiles to mitigate the high computational cost of multidimensional sampling. In this work, we extend Fokker--Planck Score Learning (FPSL) to efficiently reconstruct two-dimensional free-energy landscapes from non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations using different types of collective variables. We show that explicitly modeling orthogonal degrees of freedom reveals insights hidden in one-dimensional projections at negligible computational overhead. Additionally, exploiting symmetries in the underlying landscape enhances reconstruction accuracy, while regularization techniques ensure numerical robustness in sparsely sampled regions. We validate our approach on three distinct systems: the conformational dynamics of alanine dipeptide, as well as coarse-grained and all-atom models of solute permeation through lipid bilayers. We demonstrate that, because FPSL learns a smooth score function rather than histogram-based densities, it overcomes the exponential scaling of grid-based methods, establishing it as a data-efficient and scalable tool for multidimensional free-energy estimation.

Magnetic topological insulators have received significant interest due to their dissipationless edge states, which promise advances in energy-efficient electronic transport. However, the magnetic topological insulator state has typically been found in ferromagnets (FMs) that suffer from low magnetic ordering temperatures and stray fields. Identifying an antiferromagnetic topological insulator that exhibits the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) with a relatively high Néel temperature has been a longstanding challenge. Here, we focus on the recently discovered van der Waals (vdW) antiferromagnet (AFM) UOTe, which not only features a high Néel temperature (\(\sim\)150K) but also exhibits intriguing Kondo interaction and topological characteristics. Our systematic analysis of the layer-dependent topological phases based on \textit{ab} initio computations predicts the two-layer UOTe film to be an ideal 2D AFM Chern insulator in which the Hall conductivity is quantized with a fully compensated spin magnetization. By applying an in-plane strain or electric field, we show how the itinerancy of U-5f electrons can be manipulated to trigger a transition between the nontrivial ($C = 1$) and trivial ($C = 0$) phases. Interestingly, the 3-layer UOTe film is found to have zero charge conductance but it hosts a quantized spin Hall conductivity (SHC) with finite magneto-electric coupling, suggesting the presence of an axion insulator-like state. The unique magnetic structure of UOTe supports a layer-tunable topology in which films with an odd number of layers are axion-like insulators, while films with an even number of layers are Chern insulators, and the bulk material is a Dirac semimetal. Our study offers a new intrinsic AFM materials platform for realizing correlated topological phases for next-generation spintronics applications and fundamental science studies.

Reciprocity is a fundamental symmetry present in many natural phenomena and engineered systems. Distinct situations where this symmetry is broken are typically grouped under the umbrella term "nonreciprocity", colloquially defined by: the action of A on B $\neq$ the action of B on A. In this review, we elucidate what nonreciprocity is by providing an introduction to its most salient classes: nonvariational dynamics, violations of Newton's third law, broken detailed balance, nonreciprocal responses and nonreciprocity of arbitrary linear operators. Next, we point out where to find these manifestations of non-reciprocity, from ensembles of particles with field mediated interactions to synthetic neural networks and open quantum systems. Given this breadth of contexts and the lack of an all-encompassing definition, it makes it all the more intriguing that some general conclusions can be gathered, when distinct definitions of nonreciprocity overlap. We explore what these universal consequences are with a special emphasis on collective phenomena that arise in nonreciprocal many-body systems. The topics covered include nonreciprocal phase transitions and non-normal amplification of noise and perturbations. We conclude with some open questions.

- **TL;DR**: 研究两种新型柱状双卤化物钙钛矿Cs₂AgPdCl₅和Cs₂AgPtCl₅的热电性能，发现它们在低掺杂浓度下可获得高热电优值(zT)，其中Cs₂AgPdCl₅的p型zT可达1.30，主要得益于低晶格热导率和有利的电子结构。

We investigate the thermoelectric properties of two newly synthesized columnar double halide perovskites Cs$_2$AgPdCl$_5$ and Cs$_2$AgPtCl$_5$. These materials accommodate a distorted local polyhedral architecture with tetrahedral symmetry compared to traditional double halide perovskites. By employing density functional theory along with the semiclassical transport model, we have analyzed the electronic and transport properties of these materials. Our results show that at 800 K, the largest figure of merit ($zT$) is 1.30 (0.86) for p-type (n-type) Cs$_2$AgPdCl$_5$ and 0.87 for n-type Cs$_2$AgPtCl$_5$ at doping concentrations of $1.94 \times 10^{20}$ ($3.76 \times 10^{19}$) cm$^{-3}$ and $3.52 \times 10^{19}$ cm$^{-3}$, respectively. Remarkably, a very low doping concentration is required to achieve a high $zT$, setting these materials apart from others in this field. Our calculations demonstrate that Cs$_2$AgPdCl$_5$ benefits from the presence of conduction and valence band valleys near the band edges; however, the flat bands present in the valence band of Cs$_2$AgPtCl$_5$ do not improve its thermoelectric performance. Among these systems, hole doping in Cs$_2$AgPdCl$_5$ has shown remarkable thermoelectric performance. Interestingly, the local octahedral distortions present in these perovskites contribute to a marked reduction in the lattice thermal conductivity to 0.27 W/mK in Cs$_2$AgPtCl$_5$ and 0.20 W/mK in Cs$_2$AgPdCl$_5$ by causing enhanced phonon scattering, further improving the thermoelectric figure of merit. This drop in thermal conductivity, combined with the favorable electronic properties, underscores the potential use of these materials for applications in highly efficient thermoelectric devices.

Reliable and precise etching of silicon nanostructures with ultra-high aspect ratios is required in many fields. Metal assisted chemical etching (MacEtch) in vapor is a plasma-free etching method that attracts considerable attention owing to the ability to create smooth, high aspect ratio nanostructures. MacEtch understanding and applications are limited by low fidelity and inconsistent pattern transfer from the catalyst layer to the silicon substrate. The locally constrained electrochemical interactions at the catalyst site make MacEtch particularly sensitive to catalyst contamination reducing the reaction rate and pinning the catalyst during etching. Removing contaminants is essential to improve pattern transfer for reliable processes on a larger area and higher aspect ratio. Physically separating the main source of carbon - the resist - from the catalyst with a sacrificial and functional interlayer solves this issue. The interlayer separates the resist and the catalyst and allows for thorough cleaning of the substrate before catalyst deposition. The resulting clean catalyst has improved stability, quality and reproducibility, enabling reliable fabrication of dense (50% patterned area) high aspect ratio (&gt;250:1) nanostructures. Two different interlayer materials (Cr and Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$) and two patterning approaches are presented, showcasing etching of various high aspect ratio nanostructures, such as X-ray Optics.

- **TL;DR**: 提出一种计算铁磁和交变磁体中反常霍尔电导率随倾斜角变化的方法，以SrRuO₃为例，发现倾斜角对AHC的影响在电子带宽中心区域最显著，并研究了Weyl点的演化。

We present a simple methodology to compute the anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) as a function of the canting angles in ferromagnets and altermagnets, starting from a nonmagnetic Hamiltonian obtained from first-principles calculations that preserves the full symmetry of the crystal structure. Magnetism is introduced by including on-site spin splitting, spin-orbit coupling, and spin-canting angles. As a representative material, we study SrRuO$_3$, which supports spin canting and exhibits a sign change of the AHC. In the ferromagnetic phase, the low-energy AHC is found to be close to zero at the Fermi level, in agreement with experimental observations. We show that the dependence of the AHC on the relevant physical parameters is most pronounced in the central region of the electronic bandwidth. We determine the symmetry-allowed components of the AHC for different magnetic orders in the large family of transition-metal perovskite ABO$_3$ compounds with space group $62$, including the spontaneous in-plane anomalous Hall effect. Within density functional theory, we evaluate the range of spin-canting angles in SrRuO$_3$ and demonstrate that it is suppressed as electronic correlations increase. By analyzing the AHC as a function of the canting angle, we find that the collinear magnetic configurations contribute most to the AHC, while spin canting plays a secondary role in determining its magnitude in non-collinear ferromagnets and altermagnets. However, canting can become relevant and induce a sign change of the AHC when the collinear magnetic state exhibits an AHC close to zero. Finally, we investigate the locations of Weyl points in the Brillouin zone and their evolution as a function of the canting angle.

- **TL;DR**: 论文使用2尺度收敛框架严格分析离子晶体中宏观极化的定义问题，证明不同晶胞选择会导致不同的体极化和表面电荷密度，但电场和能量保持不变。

Ionic crystals, such as solid electrolytes and complex oxides, are central to modern technologies for energy storage, sensing, actuation, and other functional applications. An important fundamental issue in the atomic and quantum-scale modeling of these materials is defining the macroscopic polarization. In a periodic crystal, the usual definition of the polarization as the first moment of the charge density in a unit cell is found to depend qualitatively - allowing even a change in the sign - and quantitatively on the choice of unit cell.
  We examine this issue using a rigorous approach based on the framework of 2-scale convergence. By examining the continuum limit of when the lattice spacing is much smaller than the characteristic dimensions of the body, we show that the 2-scale limit provides both a bulk polarization as well as a surface charge density supported on the boundary of the body. Further, different choices of the periodic unit cell of the body lead to correspondingly different partial unit cells at the boundary; these choices give to different bulk polarization and surface charges but compensate such that the electric field and energy are independent of the choice of unit cell.

- **TL;DR**: 首次报道高质量自支撑InAsSb纳米旗的生长及其电子特性，展示了比InAs和InSb更大的朗德g因子和可比的迁移率，具有表面费米能级钉扎特性，有望用于量子应用。

The present work reports, for the first time, the growth of high-quality free-standing InAsSb nanoflags and their electronic properties. Different growth conditions have been explored, and zinc-blende InAsSb nanoflags of various composition have been obtained. In particular, InAs0.77Sb0.23 nanoflags are on average (2000+-180) nm long, (640+-50) nm wide, and (130+-30) nm thick. We show that these nanoflags have a Landé g-factor larger than InAs and InSb and a mobility comparable to those of the best performing InAs and InSb nanoflags. Besides, we show evidence for a surface Fermi level pinning in the conductance band of these InAs0.77Sb0.23 nanoflags, similar to the well-known behavior of InAs. This promises to make InAsSb easy to couple to superconductors, while keeping or improving many of the features that make InSb an interesting material for quantum applications.

We present a curated dataset of planar displacement fields from eight fatigue crack growth experiments obtained via full-field digital image correlation (DIC). The dataset covers multiple aerospace-grade aluminium alloys, specimen geometries, material orientations, and load configurations, providing a diverse experimental basis for data-driven fracture mechanics research. Crack tip locations are consistently annotated using an iterative correction procedure applied to all measurements, and fracture mechanical descriptors like stress-intensity factors are provided as additional labels. The dataset comprises 8,794 unique experimentally observed displacement fields and a total of 70,352 supervised samples generated through standardized interpolation and augmentation. DIC data is provided as uniformly interpolated displacement grids at three standardized resolutions 28 x 28, 64 x 64, and 128 x 128 pixels, each available in three dataset sizes to support scalable use cases ranging from educational applications to high-capacity model development. Accompanying metadata and a Python interface facilitate filtering, loading, and integration into reproducible machine learning and fracture mechanics workflows.

### Scalable Solar-Blind Imaging Enabled by Single-Crystalline Beta-Ga2O3 Membranes on Silicon Backplanes

Ultrawide-bandgap semiconductors are attractive for solar-blind ultraviolet (UV) detection owing to their intrinsically low noise and high spectral selectivity, yet their deployment in large-area, high-density electronic imaging systems remains limited by a fundamental trade-off between material quality, device speed, and compatibility with high-density planar silicon readout circuits. Here, we report a membrane-enabled integration platform based on transferable single-crystalline beta-Ga2O3 that overcomes these constraints at the system level. By exploiting the weak interplanar bonding of beta-Ga2O3 (100) plane, we obtain wafer-scale freestanding single-crystalline membranes that enable vertically integrated photodiodes with sub-microsecond, non-persistent photoresponse and high UV-visible rejection. Crucially, we introduce a stitching-based membrane assembly strategy that decouples array resolution from the size of the source single-crystalline substrate, allowing high-resolution photodetector arrays to be integrated onto silicon thin-film-transistor backplanes. The modular assembled active-matrix UV imaging arrays exhibit uniform solar-blind response without image lag, in stark contrast to arrays based on amorphous or polycrystalline films. Beyond beta-Ga2O3, this membrane-enabled and stitching-based modular integration strategy provides a general route toward high-speed, high-resolution electronic imaging systems using transferable single-crystalline semiconductors.

### Long-range electrostatics in atomistic machine learning: a physical perspective

The inclusion of long-range electrostatics in atomistic machine learning (ML) is receiving increasing attention for achieving quantum-mechanical accuracy in predicting a wide range of molecular and material properties. However, there is still no general prescription on how long-range physical effects should be incorporated into the model while preserving well-established locality principles underlying most transferable ML representations. Here, we provide a physical perspective on the problem, by discussing how distinct contributions to the system's electrostatics can be captured through the adoption of different learning paradigms. Specifically, we discern between local charge models, which rely either on explicit charge-density decompositions or implicit auxiliary variables, and models where a notion of nonlocality is deliberately introduced, either via self-consistent procedures or by using nonlocal descriptors and learning architectures. We further address the related aspect of incorporating finite-field effects through the coupling with the system's polarization, relevant for the application of an external electric bias. We conclude by discussing the implications for the simulation of electrochemical interfaces, where long-range electrostatics are essential to capture the interplay between charge redistribution, interfacial dynamics, and ionic screening, and for ionic transport phenomena, which, although less explored, appear far less sensitive to their inclusion.
